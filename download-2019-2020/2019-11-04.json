(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>The week got off on the front-foot for markets, with gratitude to the usually reserved US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who projected a November timeline for the Phase 1 deal, a Huawei waiver announcement due soon (seeing a bid in Huawei US-listed suppliers) and that the US may not need to slap auto tariffs on the EU. There were also constructive comments out of Chinese publications which saw new ATHs in the SPX (resistance at 3085), bear steepening in the Treasury curve, assisting the greenback whilst bullion prices edged lower (yet remaining above 1,500) and helping the crude benchmarks get off on the front foot as they threat the top end of their multi-week ranges. Sprint (S) traded ~1% lower after it reported a loss per share of USD 0.07, deeper than the street consensus for a loss of USD 0.02. Revenue also fell short, printing USD 7.8bln (Exp. 8.17bln). It also noted it expects the deal with T-Mobile (TMUS) to close in early 2020, who also traded lower on Monday. Bausch Health (BHC) traded higher on revenue beats and an increase in its FY revenue view, albeit in line with expectations. Sysco (SYY) traded marginally lower; EPS beat expectations by USD 0.02 and revenue’s missed by USD 200mln. Under Armour (UAA) also reported figures although it was largely overlooked given the recent federal investigation into the company. Nonetheless, it reported EPS beats and revenue came in line with street estimates. S&amp;P 500 0.4% at 3078, NASDAQ-100 0.6% at 8211, Dow Jones 0.4% at 27463.</p><p>The TPLEX bear steepened on Monday following the positive risk sentiment, in addition to a stronger dollar and a large slate of issuance seeing investors pare back their debt holdings. US Commerce Secretary Ross gave promising comments on the US-China and EU auto-tariff fronts, reducing haven demand. Additionally, participants are facing a large amount of debt issuance, both from corporates and sovereigns, with the Treasury refunding auctions in the 3-year, 10-year and 30-year scheduled this week, and the ramp-up in corporate supply, where ten IG issuers came to the dollar market on Monday. Treasuries headed lower throughout the day, catching steam from some block sales - 20k in the TYZ9 and 8k in the USZ9 – and by settlement yields were approximately 6bps higher at the long end, with the 2-year higher by just half of that. T-note futures (Z9) settled 14 ticks lower at 129-18+.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Earnings: Allergan, Microchip Technology, Newmont Goldcorp, Regeneron, Associated British Foods, Imperial Brands, Telefonica, Pandora.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US MARKET WRAP: </strong>The<strong> </strong>week got off on the front-foot for markets, with gratitude to the usually reserved US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who projected a November timeline for the Phase 1 deal, a Huawei waiver announcement due soon (seeing a bid in Huawei US-listed suppliers) and that the US may not need to slap auto tariffs on the EU. There were also constructive comments out of Chinese publications which saw new ATHs in the SPX (resistance at 3085), bear steepening in the Treasury curve, assisting the greenback whilst bullion prices edged lower (yet remaining above 1,500) and helping the crude benchmarks get off on the front foot as they threat the top end of their multi-week ranges.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE WAR:</strong> Weekend commentary has been constructive. China on Friday said there was a \"consensus in principle,\" and after the APEC meeting in mid-November was cancelled (where Presidents Trump and Xi were to sign the much anticipated Phase One part of the trade deal), officials seem to be making progress to find an alternative venue for the confab between the two leaders, with some suggestion that the meeting could take place in Iowa; Trump late Friday said both sides were discussing locations, \"but I like to get deals done first.\" Reuters reported that it was not immediately clear whether China would agree to sign the trade deal in the US. In another sign of apparent movement, on Sunday US Commerce Secretary Ross said licenses for US companies to sell components to China’s Huawei will come \"very shortly,\" and added that there was no reason a trade deal could not be on track to be signed in November. On the location, SCMP reported China is open to various options of where to sign a trade deal with the US, but it will be careful to avoid giving too many concessions, according to sources.</p><p><strong>* US/EU TRADE WAR: </strong>The constructive trade narrative was buttressed further on news that the US sees no need to slap tariffs on EU autos by 14 November deadline.</p><p><strong>* FED SPEAKERS: </strong>Fed's Kashkari, a dove who will vote on monetary policy in 2020, said the balance of risks are were still tilted to the downside, and repeated his argument that monpol has been too tight during recovery. Kashkari said he was concerned about the trend in inflation expectations and repeated his view that forward guidance might play role in helping. On future policy, Kashkari said that negative rates cannot be ruled out as a tool. On potential future moves, Kashkari seemed to indicate he was data dependent, and also noted that the Fed does not know where neutral rate exactly is, but Kashkari thinks rates are around neutral and somewhat accommodative. Elsewhere, he observed that wage growth net of inflation was now positive, which is a very positive thing. Aftermarket, traders will be keeping an ear out for remarks by non-voter Daly.</p><p><strong>* PBOC:</strong> China's central bank will on 5th November conduct MLF operations; key will be whether the PBOC rolls the CNY 403.5bln that matures, and whether it lowers the rate of its operation. UBS thinks it is highly likely that it rolls over the maturing MLFs, however, and the chance of an MLF rate cut is low it says. \"While monetary policy can aid economic growth via lowering borrowing costs, if the lower interest rate cannot be effectively passed to the real economy, it doesn’t make much sense for the PBOC to lower the MLF rate too fast or too aggressively,\" UBS explains, \"maybe that's why PBOC has recently switched to a less dovish tone even though the Chinese economy remains under substantial downward pressure,\" adding that transmission effectiveness might be a key concern for policymakers before they decide to ease further.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS (IR/TU/NK): </strong>Iran’s Energy Authority announced the operation of 30 new centrifuges is now underway, adding they were driven to take these steps by Washington’s wrong policies, whilst they never intended to go ahead with it. This was later followed by the US imposing fresh Iranian sanctions on nine individuals and one entity related to Iran. In Turkey, the head of the defence industry announced the second delivery of the Russian S-400 missile system is planned for 2020 but could be delayed due to technology sharing and production talks, a move likely to raise concern in the US. Since the US removed the country from its F-35 programme, it announced it is now evaluating a Russian offer for fighter jets. Middle Eastern later reported that President Erdogan’s trip to the US is still not certain as it evaluates the pros and cons, adding “we should all understand that this was an invitation extended by Trump.&nbsp; Turkey didn’t ask for a visit”. Over in North Korea, Yonhap reported working level talks with the US could take place in mid-November or December.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.4% at 3078, NASDAQ-100 0.6% at 8211, Dow Jones 0.4% at 27463.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.1%, Consumer Staples -0.9%, Energy 3.2%, Financials 0.9%, Health Care -0.3%, Industrials 1.2%, Information Technology 0.6%, Materials 0.8%, Telecommunication Services 0.4%, Utilities -1.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFCS:</strong> Huawei suppliers (MU, WDC) caught a bid as US Commerce Secretary ross announced licenses for US companies to sell to Huawei will be coming shortly. McDonald’s (MCD) traded in the red following the removal of its CEO after he was involved in a consensual relationship with an employee, which the board deemed to violate company policy and demonstrated poor judgement. Its McDonald’s USA President became the successor immediately. Under Armour (UAA) an underperformer today as it is being investigated by Federal authorities over its accounting practices, in a probe which is examining whether the UAA shifted sales from quarter to quarter to seem healthier, according to WSJ citing people familiar with the matter; UAA announced it is cooperating with authorities. Uber (UBER) had its lawsuit dismissed by a Manhattan judge which challenged a NYC law which limits the number of licenses for ride-hailing services. Homebuilders (KBH, PHM, TOL, LEN) traded lower after PHM and KBH were downgraded to neutral from buy at Seaport Global, also a rise in treasury yields could also be a factor. Boeing (BA) traded higher despite source reports from NYT that the analysis of its 737 MAX jet led to a precautionary investigation of its 737 NG jet from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>Stryker (SYK) traded in the red today as it announced it is to acquire Wright Medical (WMGI) for USD 30.75/shr, valued at USD 4.1bln. The announcement followed reports from over the weekend that WMGI hired advisors for a sale, where it stated SYK, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Smith and Nephew (SNN) were potential suitors. Google's (GOOG) plan to acquire Fitbit (FIT) for USD 2.1bln reportedly stoked fresh fear on Capitol Hill. Iberiabank (IBKC) and First Horizon (FHN) announced the two are to combine in an all stock merger of equals, under First Horizon’s name.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Sprint (S) traded ~1% lower after it reported a loss per share of USD 0.07, deeper than the street consensus for a loss of USD 0.02. Revenue also fell short, printing USD 7.8bln (Exp. 8.17bln). It also noted it expects the deal with T-Mobile (TMUS) to close in early 2020, who also traded lower on Monday. Bausch Health (BHC) traded higher on revenue beats and an increase in its FY revenue view, albeit in line with expectations. Sysco (SYY) traded marginally lower; EPS beat expectations by USD 0.02 and revenue’s missed by USD 200mln. Under Armour (UAA) also reported figures although it was largely overlooked given the recent federal investigation into the company. Nonetheless, it reported EPS beats and revenue came in line with street estimates</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.34 HIGHER AT USD 56.54/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 0.44 HIGHER AT USD 62.13/BBL: </strong>Crude markets bounced higher as the temperamental beast, that is US-China trade sentiment, began the week on the hopeful side. Optimistic comments from US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross saw equity indices reach new highs, something that energy traders took their cues from. Saudi Arabia announced it would be boosting its OSPs for December, further indication of a tight physical market, Citigroup analysts note; the bank also see the tape action as a “buy the news” reaction to the recovery in Saudi’s production in October pushing back on the narrative of a capped oil market. Elsewhere, Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh expects further OPEC cuts to be agreed at the 5th/6th December OPEC meeting, adding that the group and its allies are already discussing the possibility of deeper cuts, too. The latest expectations for US energy inventories see crude stocks building 2.7mln bbls, whilst the the products are both seen drawing, distillates by 0.6mln bbls and gasoline by 1.7mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 14 TICKS LOWER AT 129-18+: </strong>The TPLEX bear steepened on Monday following the positive risk sentiment, in addition to a stronger dollar and a large slate of issuance seeing investors pare back their debt holdings. US Commerce Secretary Ross gave promising comments on the US-China and EU auto-tariff fronts, reducing haven demand. Additionally, participants are facing a large amount of debt issuance, both from corporates and sovereigns, with the Treasury refunding auctions in the 3-year, 10-year and 30-year scheduled this week, and the ramp-up in corporate supply, where ten IG issuers came to the dollar market on Monday. Treasuries headed lower throughout the day, catching steam from some block sales - 20k in the TYZ9 and 8k in the USZ9 – and by settlement yields were approximately 6bps higher at the long end, with the 2-year higher by just half of that.</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong> The US Treasury will auction USD 84bln in a new 3-year (USD 38bln, Tuesday), a new 10-year (USD 27bln, Wednesday) and a new 30-year (USD 19bln, Thursday). According to UBS, at next week's mid-month settlement, around USD 89bln of cash flows come due (excluding SOMA holdings, but including around USD 61bln of redemptions and around USD 28bln of coupons will fall due).</p><p><strong>* 3-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> SocGen's analysts say the 3-year auction has set up, from a RV perspective, and is trading cheap in both asset swap and on the curve versus 2s and 5s notes. Additionally, on an outright basis, SG believes the sector looks cheap given that the current 3s WI is trading above the stop-out rate of the last three auctions. SocGen says that with the Treasury yields near the higher-end of the recent range, and a lack of clear catalysts for a sustained rise in yields from here, it expects buyers of Treasuries to materialise. But SocGen does state, however, that with relatively high dealer holdings in the front part of the curve, demand for the paper will depend on foreigners and investment funds. Overall, the bank says it is positive on the auction.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> DXY traded firmer today with durable goods and NY ISM failing to provide any impetus to the buck, however the positive China trade rhetoric saw outflows of both JPY and CHF, likely leading to Monday’s bid in the Dollar index which breached the 200dma (97.465) to the upside from morning lows at 97.164, to see highs of 97.569 towards the tail end of the session. GBP traded on the backfoot to start the week, likely driven by USD strength, paring back some of last week’s gains, however the latest ICM poll put the Conservatives and Labour party differential at 7pts, narrower than the latest YouGov poll which had them at a 12pt gap, and Brexit Party’s Nigel Farage confirmed he is to contest 600 seats at this General Election as UK PM Johnson rejected his leave alliance, both potentially adding uncertainty to the conservatives hopes of reaching a majority government; Cable gradually lost ground through session heading back towards the 1.29 handle, where there is chunky option expiry at tomorrow. EUR held a similar story to Sterling where EURGBP traded relatively flat, but EURUSD traded lower on the dollar strength. The single currency shrugged off this mornings final Markit Manufacturing PMI data which ticked up to 45.9 from the 45.7, although IHS did note the report signalled a sustained weakness in output, new orders and purchasing, while job shedding accelerated to sharpest since start of 2013. Havens traded weaker today on positive trade updates from both China and the EU, USDJPY traded within the 50 and 200dma, which is 107.73 and 109.2 respectively, with participants eyeing these figures on any further risk updates. XAU remained above the 1500 level, falling from highs of 1514 to lows of 1504; CHF also lost ground against the Buck, Sterling and Euro. In EMFX, ZAR was a clear outperformer on its relief rally following days of weakness last week on its budget and utility concerns, pricing in an expected downgrade in South Africa’s outlook to negative, which subsequentially happened, although it did affirm the nation at Baa3, avoiding junk status. TRY underperformed its EM peers on further concerns as it announced it is looking to purchase a second Russian S-400 missile system, a move unlikely to please the US. Turkey’s inflation came in softer than expected, much to the CBRT’s delight, as it looks to normalise its economy by getting inflation back to its 5% target. MXN &amp; BRL also weaker today likely driven by USD strength, with the former unreactive to Banxico’s Deputy Governor Guzman comments, who stated he forecasts Mexico's economy to recover gradually in 2020, core inflation to continue to fall in the coming months, adding the bank forecasts general and core inflation will converge to its 3% target in H2 20.</p>",

Optimistic comments from US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross saw equity indices reach new highs, something that energy traders took their cues from. Saudi Arabia announced it would be boosting its OSPs for December, further indication of a tight physical market, Citigroup analysts note; the bank also see the tape action as a “buy the news” reaction to the recovery in Saudi’s production in October pushing back on the narrative of a capped oil market. Elsewhere, Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh expects further OPEC cuts to be agreed at the 5th/6th December OPEC meeting, adding that the group and its allies are already discussing the possibility of deeper cuts, too. The latest expectations for US energy inventories see crude stocks building 2.7mln bbls, whilst the the products are both seen drawing, distillates by 0.6mln bbls and gasoline by 1.7mln bbls.</li></ul>",

The index is currently just shy of 97.400 within a 97.427-164 range having digested slightly weaker than forecast factory orders and dovish commentary from 2020 Fed voter Kashkari.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>The G10 laggards amidst heightened risk appetite on the back of bullish US payrolls tallies, more optimism surrounding Phase 1 of the US-China trade accord and hopes that Washington will push back or even pull pending EU, Japanese and SK auto tariffs. Usd/Jpy has rebounded from circa 108.20 to 108.60 or so, while Usd/Chf is meandering between 0.9854-90 and Eur/Chf is hovering above 1.1000. Elsewhere, Sterling remains anxious and prone to pre-UK GE jitters as Parliament votes for a new HoC Speaker and polls indicate that the opposition Labour Party is closing the gap to PM Johnson’s Tories. Cable is only just keeping afloat on the 1.2900 handle and the Pound containing losses vs the Euro ahead of 0.8650 as the single currency gleans a degree of comfort from marginally firmer than preliminary French, German and pan Eurozone manufacturing PMIs plus a more pronounced bounce in Sentix economic sentiment, with Eur/Usd underpinned between 1.1144-75 parameters.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD</strong></p><p>Not quite zeroes from heroes, but the non-US Dollars lost impetus over the course of Monday’s session, and the Kiwi and Aussie especially after headlines broke revealing that India would not be adding its signature to the RCEP deal even though Australia’s Trade Minister believed that the nation would keep dialogue going. Nzd/Usd has retreated to sub-0.6420 from around 0.6465 and Aud/Usd to 0.6900 vs 0.6925 at best, with the latter also treading cautiously into the RBA policy meeting, while Usd/Cad continues to straddle 1.3150.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A lively start to the week for the likes of the Rand and Lira, with the former sharply outperforming and extending relied gains following Friday’s ratings review by Moody’s that refrained from cutting more than SA’s outlook. Conversely, the latter only managed a fleeting upturn when Turkish inflation data showed a further downturn towards target on the prospect of more CBRT easing and investor jitters about US/international relations given plans for a 2nd delivery of the Russian S-400 missile system, as media outlets suggest President Erdogan’s US visit remains uncertain. Usd/Zar now eyeing 14.7300 to the downside whereas Usd/Try currently nestles near 5.7300.</p>",

US Commerce Secretary Ross, over the weekend signalled optimistic China developments whilst noting that US may not need to impose auto tariffs later this month on the EU, Japan and South Korea, following positive conversations with these countries. DAX and Euro Stoxx indices are at fresh YTD highs, with the latter at its highest levels since early 2018. As expected, European auto names, including Fiat Chrysler (+4.0%), Peugeot (+4.9%), Daimler (+2.2%) and Volkswagen (+2.5%) are driving gains amid Ross’ comments. More broadly, sector performance is reflective of the market’s risk-on sentiment; Materials (+1.6%), Consumer Discretionary (+1.2%), Tech (+1.1%), Energy (+1.7%) and Financials (+1.6%) are all on the performing well, with the latter two aided by higher yields and crude prices from Friday’s late-doors rally. Meanwhile, the more defensive Utilities (+0.1%), Consumer Staples (Unch.) and Health Care (+0.5%) sectors are laggards. In terms of specific movers; strong earnings from Ryanair (+6.6%), Siemens Healthineers (+7.0%) and Telefonica Deutschland (+1.6%) has seen their respective stock prices advance. Wirecard (+3.7%) trades higher with the prospect of EUR 200mln in additional share buybacks providing some reprieve from the recent FT-induced declines. Finally, UK gambling stocks fell sharply (William Hill -6.9%, GVC -10%) amid pre-market reports via The Guardian that UK MPs are demanding an overhaul of gambling laws which would see online casinos subject to the a maximum stakes limit similar to the GBP 2 imposed on fixed-odds betting terminals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>UK Brexit Party Leader Farage said he won’t stand as a PM candidate in the upcoming general election on December 12th.

However, cross-currents also favoured the Kiwi as Aud/Nzd retreated through 1.0750 and the Aussie lost traction vs its US rival on the 0.6900 handle following disappointing retail sales data on the eve of the RBA’s policy meeting – full preview available via the Research Suite. Elsewhere, the Rand is breathing a big sigh of relief after Moody’s SA ratings review on Friday as the agency resisted any temptation to go beyond the widely anticipated outlook downgrade to negative. Usd/Zar has reversed further from recent highs in response and back below the psychological 15.0000 level to test bids/support at 14.7500.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY </strong>- The safe-havens have receded in line with risk-on sentiment prompted by the hefty US payroll beats and rising global trade optimism amidst latest positive updates on US-China Phase 1 alongside talks between the US, EU, Japan and South Korea that could culminate in auto tariffs being rolled over or even removed altogether. The Franc is also digesting even more dovish remarks than normal from SNB chief Jordan and latest weekly Swiss sight deposits showing a hefty rise in domestic bank accounts, as Usd/Chf hovers above 0.9875 and Eur/Chf over 1.1025, while the Yen and crosses are also elevated, with Usd/Jpy eyeing 108.50.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/EUR</strong> - All softer vs the Greenback as the DXY holds above 97.000 and Friday’s 97.107 post-NFP low, as the Loonie continues to reflect on the BoC’s rather concerned outlook and pivots 1.3150, while Cable strives to keep its head above 1.2900 ahead of the UK election and the Pound lags against a relatively resilient Euro after some signs of stabilisation in the core and pan Eurozone manufacturing PMIs. Note also, Sentix sentiment improved substantially and Eur/Usd may be benefiting from expiry hedging given 1 bn running off between 1.1155-60.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Choppy trade in Usd/Try within 5.7075-6800 parameters after another slowdown in Turkish CPI and reports that the second batch of S-400 missiles from Russia may be delayed, with the Lira testing 200 DMA resistance, but not quite breaching the technical marker.</p><p><strong>Moody’s affirmed South Africa at BAA3; Outlook cut to Negative from Stable.

Short covering clearly contributed to the relatively strong recovery and perhaps technical buying or cash related support as 10-year yields defended -35 bp and 70 bp respectively. However, <strong>USTs</strong> remain soft and the curve steeper post-NFP and in advance of more US releases ahead of Fed’s Daly, with new ECB President Lagarde filling the void in between.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Crude markets are firmer on the first trading session of the week following overnight consolidation from Friday’s late-door gains, with impetus derived from the overall risk sentiment and in wake of of comments from the Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh who expects further cuts to be agreed at the 5th/6th December OPEC meeting (in-fitting with some of the recent sources reports ahead of the meeting, although the magnitude of the touted cuts is unknown). <strong>WTI Dec’ 19 futures</strong> have moved above last Friday’s USD 56.43/bbl high, as has <strong>Brent Jan’ 20</strong> futures, which also eclipsed the USD 62.00/bbl level. Elsewhere, COT data released last Friday showed that speculators increased their net long in ICE Brent by 45.6k lots over the last reporting week, leaving them with a net long of 253,999 lots as of last Tuesday. “This is the largest weekly increase since early September, and also takes the net spec position back to levels seen in September” notes ING, who point out that “the increase was predominantly driven by fresh longs, rather than shorts coming in to cover.” Turning to metals; <strong>gold</strong> prices are subdued, despite the risk on moves being seen across equities and bonds. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile is similarly uneventful – CFTC data from last Friday revealed that speculators have increased gross longs by 11,514 lots over the week, and covered 11,949 shorts, amid recent gains in the markets risk tone.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia have confirmed that Saudi Aramco is to be publicly floated, currently no indication on the timing, price or magnitude of the IPO. Reports note scepticism that Aramco will achieve its USD 2trl valuation, likely to be closer to USD 1.5trl. Stake offered could be between 1-3% valued at USD 15-60bln.

US Commerce Secretary Ross, over the weekend signalled optimistic China developments whilst noting that US may not need to impose auto tariffs later this month on the EU, Japan and South Korea, following positive conversations with these countries. DAX and Euro Stoxx indices are at fresh YTD highs, with the latter at its highest levels since early 2018. As expected, European auto names, including Fiat Chrysler (+4.0%), Peugeot (+4.9%), Daimler (+2.2%) and Volkswagen (+2.5%) are driving gains amid Ross’ comments. More broadly, sector performance is reflective of the market’s risk-on sentiment; Materials (+1.6%), Consumer Discretionary (+1.2%), Tech (+1.1%), Energy (+1.7%) and Financials (+1.6%) are all on the performing well, with the latter two aided by higher yields and crude prices from Friday’s late-doors rally. Meanwhile, the more defensive Utilities (+0.1%), Consumer Staples (Unch.) and Health Care (+0.5%) sectors are laggards. In terms of specific movers; strong earnings from Ryanair (+6.6%), Siemens Healthineers (+7.0%) and Telefonica Deutschland (+1.6%) has seen their respective stock prices advance. Wirecard (+3.7%) trades higher with the prospect of EUR 200mln in additional share buybacks providing some reprieve from the recent FT-induced declines. Finally, UK gambling stocks fell sharply (William Hill -6.9%, GVC -10%) amid pre-market reports via The Guardian that UK MPs are demanding an overhaul of gambling laws which would see online casinos subject to the a maximum stakes limit similar to the GBP 2 imposed on fixed-odds betting terminals.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/ZAR </strong>- The Kiwi is head and shoulders above its G10 counterparts in wake of news that NZ and China will enhance their FTA, with Nzd/Usd extending gains through 0.6450 at one stage even though the latest NZ Treasury report paints a rather bleak picture of the domestic economy as Q2 GDP was weaker than expected and business activity remained depressed during the 3 months to September.

        "content": "<p>In keeping with core counterparts, UK debt and STIR contracts have been unable to withstand the overall upbeat risk tone that started with better than expected US jobs data on Friday (headline numbers) and has been supplemented by more positive global trade vibes, as the US and China continue to cross Ts and dot Is on Phase 1, while pending EU, Japanese and SK auto tariffs may also be averted following positive talks according to US Commerce Secretary Ross. Looking at early Liffe price action, Gilts attempted to regroup alongside Bunds but only managed to rebound 8 ticks from initial levels before succumbing to more pronounced selling and hitting a deeper 131.87 low vs their previous 132.30 close. However, the 10 year benchmarks have subsequently reclaimed big figure status, tentatively, while the 3 month strip is also trying to pare losses from -3.5 ticks at worst ahead of the upcoming construction PMI.</p>",

Furthermore, the Brexit related headlines have all but died out with attention for <strong>GBP</strong> now centred on next month’s election and the power broking attempts, although UK PM Johnson has rejected Brexit Party Leader Farage's offer of forming a Leave alliance despite the latter planning to contest every seat if they cannot form a pact. Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY-crosses</strong> were kept afloat by the positive risk tone but with gains capped amid the lack of Japanese participants, while antipodeans also benefitted from the risk appetite coupled with a stronger CNY post-fix, although <strong>AUD</strong> lagged its trans-Tasman counterpart following a pullback in <strong>AUD/NZD</strong> from resistance around 1.0750 and after weaker than expected Retail Sales data.</p><p><strong>Australian Retail Sales (Sep) M/M 0.2% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.4%).

Furthermore, a continued decline in the latest Baker Hughes rig count added to the bullish catalyst for prices, although the rally has since lost some steam with prices marginally pulling back to below the USD 56.00/bbl level. <strong>Gold</strong> prices were flat amid a similar uneventful session for the greenback, while <strong>copper</strong> prices only mildly benefitted from the broad positive risk tone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia have confirmed that Saudi Aramco is to be publicly floated, currently no indication on the timing, price or magnitude of the IPO.

ASX 200 (+0.3%) was lifted by outperformance in the mining related stocks due to the trade optimism and after the recent rally in oil prices, but with gains in the index limited by weakness in the largest weighted financials sector after Big 4 bank Westpac reported a decline in its FY profit. Hang Seng (+1.4%) and Shanghai Comp.

ASX 200 (+0.3%) is lifted by outperformance in the mining related stocks due to the trade optimism and after the recent rally in oil prices, but with gains in the index limited by weakness in the largest weighted financials sector after Big 4 bank Westpac reported a decline in its FY profits. Hang Seng (+1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) are also positive with the trade optimism turned up a notch after the recent top-level call with even White House Trade Adviser and China-hawk Navarro noting that the sides had good talks, and US President Trump also suggested Iowa as a potential location for the signing of the phase 1 deal. Furthermore, strength in oil names contribute to the outperformance in Hong Kong although gains in the mainland are somewhat restricted by further PBoC liquidity inaction, while Japanese markets remained closed today for Culture Day.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is uneventful which is archetypal of the post-FOMC lull and alongside a similar humdrum tone in its major counterparts with EUR/USD and GBP/USD little changed at the 1.1100 and 1.2900 handles respectively.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Brexit related headlines have all but died out with attention for GBP now centred on next month’s election and the power broking attempts, although UK PM Johnson has rejected Brexit Party Leader Farage's offer of forming a Leave alliance despite the latter planning to contest every seat if they cannot form a pact in the next 2 weeks. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are kept afloat by the positive risk tone but with gains capped amid the lack of Japanese participants, while antipodeans also benefit from the risk appetite coupled with a stronger CNY post-fix although AUD lags its trans-Tasman counterpart following a pullback in AUD/NZD from resistance around 1.0750 and after weaker than expected Retail Sales data.</p>",
