Furthermore, it was also reported that the DUP is said to be split 7-3 in favour of UK PM Johnson's Brexit deal which was refuted a DUP source who stated it is “nonsense” to suggest the party’s MPs are split on whether or not to back the Brexit plans.

Ambassadors later confirmed that there will not be a deal made tonight although talks will continue through the night and they have been told that all issues have been agreed except for VAT, while several ambassadors told Barnier they were concerned the treaty text had not been finalised which makes endorsement by EU leaders at the summit very difficult.

Speakers: Fed’s Evans, Bowman, Williams, ECB’s Coeure. <strong>Earnings: </strong>MS, PM, UNP, ERIC, TSM.</li></ul><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The<strong> </strong>latest Brexit draft is said to include agreement on a level playing field, customs arrangements and Northern Irish (DUP) consent, although VAT provisions had not yet been agreed upon by the UK. Sources reported there would not be a deal on Wednesday evening, too, with discussions continuing. Of course any final deal faces the hurdle of support of the DUP and the Brexiteers for when it goes for a vote in UK parliament – earlier reports of DUP support were denied by the DUP but the latest suggest a compromise had been found, with currently no DUP members denying such. In regard to the Brexiteers, who have been reported to be taking a softer stance to the deal this time around, ERG Chair Steve Baker said great progress had been made, but added just now it is not 100% clear that the group would vote for the deal, reiterating they now need to see the final text.</p><p><strong>* US RETAIL SALES: </strong>Retail sales declined for the first time in 7 months, headline M/M fell by 0.3%, missing expectations for a 0.3% gain. However, the prior reading was revised higher, offsetting some worries. But the overall gist is that it was a rather soft report. However, given many have been looking at retail sales for a gauge on the health of the consumer, which is the key driver of US (and subsequently, global) growth, the report has some cautious, despite going against the grain of recent data like the University of Michigan’s confidence gauge, as well as the IBM/TIPP consumer survey. Core retail sales (ex-autos) also declined, falling 0.1%, against an expected rise of 0.2%. Unit sales increased by 1.1%, however the 1% decline in auto sales offset the gain, and core sales were hit by a 1% fall in building materials. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that retail sales are more prone to being revised higher rather than lower, and September’s figures are prime candidates to be moved higher. The heavily watched control measure, which feeds into GDP, rose 6.9% in Q3, a slower pace than Q2’s 7.9%. However, PM note “this can’t be sustained, given nominal income growth, after tax, of about 4.5%. The fourth quarter, therefore, likely will see a further slowdown in sales growth”.</p><p><strong>* BUSINESS INVENTORIES: </strong>US Business inventories (Aug) were flat. The 0.2% rise in wholesale inventories was offset by a 0.1% fall in both manufacturing and retail inventories, resulting in a flat reading and the business inventories to sales ratio at 1.4 for the 4th consecutive month. Oxford economics highlight “Following a large 0.9ppt detraction from GDP growth in Q2, inventories are expected to impose a more moderate drag in Q3. Our real GDP growth tracker for Q3 stands at 1.2% (annualized) following this morning’s data”.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>US President Trump said the US/China trade deal is being papered, but the deal probably won't be signed until he meets China President Xi at the Chile APEC Summit on November 16/17 November (as had been previously touted); Trump later said that the Phase 1 part was moving along “rapidly”. Also of note, the US is now to require all foreign missions to notify the state department of all meetings with US institutes, as the US aims to achieve reciprocal treatments for US diplomats in China.</p><p><strong>* HONG KONG: </strong>Overnight, China threatened \"strong countermeasures\" if the US followed through with legislation to support pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. The news follows the US House passing a Bill that would sanction officials that were judged to be \"responsible for undermining fundamental freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong\"; the legislation would also be subject to an annual review of whether HK is autonomous enough from Beijing to justify its special trading status under US law. The Senate would be required to rubber stamp the Bill - reports have suggested growing support in the Senate for the bill- and it would then need to be signed by US President Trump before it becomes law. HK Leader Carrie Lam noted that she would not tolerate calls for independence, adding she expects Q3 to enter a technical recession in Q3. On the situation, SCMP write that “many Hongkongers hate their own country so much they don’t understand inviting Washington’s intervention will encourage Beijing to impose even tougher control over the city\"</p><p><strong>* FED</strong>: <strong>Fed’s Evans</strong> (voter, dovish) said that he has not fully made up his mind on a potential rate cut in October. However, he caveated that he is keeping an open mind to arguments supporting further rate cuts, but that policy was probably in a good place after the two rate cuts. Evans argued that proactively cutting rates in response to downside risks when rates are low provides further buffer for economy and helps absorb shocks, and added that the Fed would act aggressively if faced with imminent downturn. On QE, Evans said that the Fed will not partake in QE until short term rates are at zero. On the Fed’s recent OMOs in the short end of the treasury curve market, Evans said that it was not QE (in line with other Fed speaker comments) but did say that the Fed may struggle with reserve issues longer than it would like. F<strong>ed’s Brainard (Voter) </strong>mainly spoke about digital currencies, however she did note that there is strong preference to address the effective lower bound with existing tools, adding that negative rates are unattractive for the US.</p><p><strong>* ECB</strong>: <strong>ECB's Chief Economist Lane</strong> said that the Eurozone is facing a more extended slowdown than previously expected and, as such, a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will be necessary for a prolonged period of time. Lane added that the convergence of inflation towards the inflation aim has recently slowed and partly reversed but maintained that the ECB’s monetary policy measures remain effective in fostering a reacceleration of growth and, thereby, inflation convergence. Lane commented that the more fiscal policy contributes to boosting long-term growth potential and providing cyclical stabilisation, the quicker will be the effects of monetary policy interventions on the economy and inflation. <strong>ECB's Knot</strong> (Hawk) called for more symmetric band around the inflation target and longer horizon for achieving it. <strong>ECB's Weidmann</strong> (Hawk) said it is important for central banks to stick to a narrow interpretation of its mandate, adding that more fiscal support is not needed unless the situation worsens, but if so, additional fiscal spending is possible in Germany.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN FISCAL SPENDING: </strong>There were sources reports earlier in the session that German officials noted a shift in the CDU fiscal stance, where it may drop the balanced budget goal in the event the downturn deepens, in addition to softening opposition towards fiscal stimulus and the government was preparing for this if GDP were impacted. The sources report saw Bund and DAX futures dip modestly and some fleeted Euro strength, however, a CDU/CSU member later said it would be sticking to its black zero balanced budget policy, essentially rebuffing the reports.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 -0.2% at 2990, NASDAQ-100 -0.3% at 7920, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.1% at 27002</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 0.4%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.1%, Energy&nbsp; -1.5%, Financials&nbsp; -0.2%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.1%, Industrials&nbsp; 0%, Information Technology&nbsp; -0.7%, Materials&nbsp; 0.3%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.2%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.2%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), McKesson (MCK), AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) all outperformed after the WSJ report that revealed favourable opioid litigation settlement proposals. In earnings, Bank of America (BAC) opened higher on strong trading revenue and growth in its NII; Abbott Laboratories (ABT) reported in line earnings seeing it open lower but constructive guidance saw it reverse losses; United Airlines (UAL) was bid on an EPS beat and raised guidance; JB Hunt (JBHT) outperformed on strong Q3 revenue; Progressive (PGR) trade lower on a miss on Revenue; PNC Financial (PNC) pared gains post earnings beats amid cautious outlook comments and NII/NIM pressures; BNY Mellon (BK) posted a beat on EPS; Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR) missed on top and bottom line estimates, whilst Tradeweb (TW) beat. Elsewhere, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) dipped on its USD 930bln bid for Achillion Pharma (ACHN). Workday (WDAY) tanked lower post its analyst day presentation, where pessimism grew on its subscription growth. MGM Resorts (MGM) was lower as it entered a USD 4.25bln JV leaseback transaction with Blackstone (BX) for Bellagio property. United Health (UNH) was an outperformer as it pared back some of its post-earnings surge. VMWare (VMW) suffered on a PT cut at Morgan Stanley, who cut several high multiple software names, including Slack (WORK) which also tumbled. Costco (COST) opened lower on a downgrade at Northcoast, although did pare back through the session. International Paper (IP) was firm on chatter of activist interest.</p><p>* <strong>PBOC:</strong> Conducted a 1-year MLF at an unchanged rate of 3.3%, injecting 200bln yuan. It received attention since the central bank usually only conducts operations when MLF mature, however, there was no maturing MLF on the day. UBS says that expectations onshore that the PBOC will follow the Fed's 25bp September cut in the next MLF operation will be disappointed, arguing that if the PBoC is really going to cut the MLF rate, a more suitable time might be in December, given that two batches of MLF will be due (6th December and 14th December). UBS notes that the PBOC has already stated the timeline that the percentage of new loans linked to loan prime rate (LPR) must be at least 30%, 50% and 80% by September 2019, December 2019 and March 2020 respectively, and says that prior to the LPR-linked loans reaching a substantial percentage of the new loans, it makes little sense to cut the MLF rate in a rush, since it would not effectively help lower the lending rate to the real economy.</p><p><strong>* CANADA CPI: </strong>Headline CPI M/M declined by 0.1% this month; core CPI M/M maintained its prior month pace of a 0.1% gain. Core Y/Y metric also maintained its pace of 1.9%, missing expectations for a pickup to 2.1%. Despite the fall and a slowing of pace in Y/Y, the BoC metrics, an average of the Core, Median and Trimmed measures ticked up from 2.0% last month to 2.06%, suggesting the fall in headline CPI was not so worrisome, given the BOC’s 2% target. RBC highlights that the dip was driven by a fall in airline fares which was expected to decline this month anyway due to seasonal factors. However, the reduction in prices was larger than predicted. RBC notes that almost 60% of the CPI basket was growing at or above 2% in comparison to last September, however, the BoC remains concerned that slow global growth and US/China trade tensions could seep into the Canadian economy, and eventually impact Canadian inflation. RBC adds that as inflation is not rising aggressively, it leaves room for flexible monetary policy in the event of a downturn, but there is not much downward pressure either, and therefore, there is no rush for an adjustment. Current market pricing sees only 18.75bp worth of cuts by the end of 2020, which narrowed after the data from 20bp.</p><p>* <strong>FED BEIGE BOOK:</strong> US economy expanded at a slightly to modest pace since the prior report as business activity varied across the country. Household spending was solid on balance, the housing market conditions changed little. Contacts in some districts suggested persistent trade tensions and slower global growth weighed on activity; manufacturing activity continued to edge lower and agricultural conditions deteriorated further. The early impact of the General Motors (GM) strike was limited. Business contacts mostly expected economic expansion to continue but many lowered their growth outlooks in the 6- to 12-month period. Employment rose slightly amid persistent labour shortages, wages rose moderately in most districts, pace of price increases was modest. A number of districts reported manufacturers reduced headcount because orders have been soft, and some cut workers hours rather than reducing staff levels.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 0.55 HIGHER AT USD 53.36/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.68 HIGHER AT USD 59.42/BBL: </strong>Crude<strong> </strong>futures made gains despite a dampened risk appetite across other assets. Citigroup analysts note moderate volume ahead of the delayed US energy inventories, where expectations see crude stocks +2.9mln, distillates -2.4mln bbls, gasoline -1.2mln bbls and Genscape forecast Cushing stocks +0.72mln bbls; API reports after the bell on Wednesday ahead of the official EIA release on Thursday. Elsewhere, Kazakstan's Kashagan oil field output has declined due to unplanned maintenance - production reportedly fell to 294k BPD from 365k BPD in early October. TASS reported that Russian oil production stood at 11.23mln BPD in the first half of October, down 19.7k BPD from September.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) SETTLED 7+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-31+:</strong> The TPLEX ultimately settled firmer after a choppy session. Haven flows were price supportive as the buck weakened whilst gold firmed – participants were cautious ahead of an official Brexit deal announcement, in addition to a disappointing US retail sales report, which caused some concern on the resilient consumer segment. At settlement the curve had steepened slightly with the 30-year yield little changed, whilst the 2-year yield fell ~3.5bps.</p><p><strong>* BOK</strong>: The Bank of Korea cut its 7-day deposit rate by 25bps to 1.25%, as was expected; there were two hawkish dissents (the dissents may have surprised some who had expected just one dissent), however, these were largely mitigated by dovish remarks from the Governor, who hinted at further rate cuts ahead. The BOK's statement justifies the rate cut on the back of downgrading growth and inflation projections. Analysts at SocGen concluded that the BOK maintained a neutral stance after the cut, and it sees one further rate cut in Q1 2020; SocGen also reiterates its view that the timing of the next cut will hinge on incoming data and the state of global economic conditions.</p><p><strong>* FX: GBP </strong>traded firmer today<strong> </strong>as key Brexit hurdles were agreed upon between the EU and UK, however an agreement on VAT is yet to be seen. However, even with a deal in close sight, it still must be accepted in the HoC with eyes on the DUP and ERG to see if they will agree or not. GBPUSD rallied from lows of 1.2658 to highs of 1.2875, although upside was capped as sources state a deal is not expected tonight. A surprise contraction in US Retail Sales saw <strong>USD</strong> weaken, with EURUSD moving from the low 1.1020s to highs just shy of the 1.1080 mark, although Brexit related Sterling appreciation may have also been lending EUR a hand. <strong>CAD</strong> saw volatile trade, as headline CPI was soft however it was offset by an uptick in the BoC watched, trimmed, median and core metrics, USDCAD hovered either side of 1.32 handle today in a range of 1.3184 – 1.3228, remaining beneath the key level heading into Asia. <strong>Havens</strong> were slightly firmer, although more as a function of dollar weakness than as a result of broader market sentiment. A weaker than expected PBoC Yuan fixing had <strong>CNH</strong>, <strong>AUD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong> on the ropes early on, with the latter underperforming on the back of dovish comments from RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand (who said hinted at the prospect of and need for lower rates), despite firmer than expected CPI. However, later in the session saw the moves partially reversed on the back of a weakening buck; which also saw EMFX gain. <strong>TRY</strong> was firmer, despite the bill gaining momentum in the US Congress towards the imposition of sanctions on the country for its incursions into Syria. <strong>ZAR</strong> was weaker as state-funded Eskom struggled to meet it power output obligations.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>",

However, EC President Tusk contends that the painfully long wait pouring over a relentless stream of claims and counterclaims could soon be over with a ‘deadline’ around 21.30-22.30BST when we may know when Brexit is likely at least (inferring the date of a further Article 50 extension if not October 31). Back to Sterling, Cable is holding around 1.2800 vs a low just above 1.2650 (and circa 1.2855 high), while Eur/Gbp has tested 0.8600 compared to peaks beyond 0.8700 at one stage.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Dollar is slipping across the board in wake of weak US retail sales data, but maybe more on the back of relative strength in rival currencies and latest comments from President Trump suggesting that Phase 1 of the trade accord with China is being written and likely to be signed with his Chinese counterpart in Chile at the middle of November. The <strong>DXY</strong> is hovering nearer the bottom of a 98.108-424 range with little traction gleaned from an upbeat NAHB survey.</p><p><strong>NOK/NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The major underperformers amidst swings in broad risk sentiment and ongoing geopolitical tensions, but also bearish technical and respective Central Bank policy stances that range from on hold-pause-further easing. Eur/Nok rallied to new record highs just shy of 10.1700, while Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd slipped through 0.6250 and 0.6730 respectively before the Norwegian Crown, Kiwi and Aussie all found some underlying bids. Note, however, Aud/Usd and Aud/Nzd should derive some fresh impetus from Aussie jobs data overnight.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The Loonie had more top-tier Canadian data to digest, but soft CPI was countered somewhat by an uptick in the BoC’s average median, trimmed and core metrics, not to mention the disappointing US consumption figures noted above and a rebound in crude prices pre-API. Hence, Usd/Cad did not deviate far from 1.3200 or 1.3233-1.3195 parameters.</p><p><strong>EUR/TRY/ZAR</strong></p><p>The single currency has consolidated gains above 1.1000 and between 1.1023-60 confines with underlying support forged from more talk about Germany mulling fiscal stimulus at the expense of its ‘black zero’ policy if the economic downturn deepens. Similarly, the Lira has weathered more Turkish sanctions and international condemnation over its Syrian offensive to recover from 5.9300+ lows and probe towards 5.8750, but the Rand remains under pressure within 15.0500-14.8740 bounds following Eskom cutting power output for fear of irreparable damage.</p>",

Given the associated rally in Sterling since the start of the week, the FTSE 100 (-0.1%) modestly underperforms. Looking ahead, traders will be eyeing earnings from US heavy weights Netflix, IBM, Bank of America and PayPal, US Retail sales data and a slate of Fed, ECB and BoE speak. In terms of the sectors; Materials (-0.8%) and Financials (-0.4%) are laggards, with the former pressured by a decline in base metal prices and a fall in yields (as bonds rebound off yesterday’s lows) pressuring the former. Conversely, Health Care (+0.5%) is an outperformer, with Roche (+0.4%) providing support after solid earnings. In terms of other notable movers; Asos (+20.1%) shares shot higher at the open after strong earnings; the Co. reported pretax earnings and revenue that exceeded forecasts. Meanwhile, disappointing numbers kept shares of ASML (-0.6%), TomTom (-5.0%) and Wacker Chemie (-1.4%) on the back foot. Elsewhere, Infineon (-1.4%) shares were under pressure following a broker downgrade at SocGen.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP -</strong> The Pound’s almost interminable and total dependence on Brexit developments continues, with only a token nod to mixed/softer elements via UK CPI and PPI metrics, before returning to headline and screen watch amidst dwindling hopes that a deal can be found in time for the looming ‘deadline’. In short, prospects of a compromise on the Irish backstop and compatible customs arrange for the border looks set to be dashed at the final hour by ongoing DUP resistance, and in stark contrast to the mood late yesterday when negotiations were said to be close to draft stage. Accordingly, Cable has reversed further from around 1.2800 to just above 1.2650 before picking up again and Eur/Gbp rebounded to circa 0.8720 vs 0.8628 or so at one stage.</p><p><strong>NOK/NZD -</strong> The other G10 underperformers, as the Norwegian Krona plunges to fresh ytd lows under 10.1350 and not far from weakest levels on record on a mixture of bearish technical impulses, less supportive Norges Bank policy vibes and perhaps more data reflection/retrospection following September’s trade balance swinging from surplus to shortfall. Conversely, the Kiwi has pulled back from 0.6300+ recovery highs towards 0.6260 even though NZ CPI was a tad firmer than forecast, as subsequent comments from RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand reaffirmed that there is scope for more easing as the economy is still prone to contagion from external shocks.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR/CAD/AUD -</strong> The safe-haven Yen and Franc (plus Gold on the commodity side) have pared some losses due to the aforementioned dampened Brexit/broader risk sentiment and have both returned to range trade mode awaiting more unfolding news on top of anything else on the US-China and geopolitical front. Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf are meandering between 108.86-60 and 0.9990-62 parameters respectively, while the Euro and Loonie are also relatively contained after the former reclaimed 1.1000+ status and latter rebounded through 1.3200. Eur/Usd is currently just under 1.1050 and some tech levels close by (50 DMA at 1.1040 and a 1.1055 Fib), with decent option expiries also keeping the headline pair in check (1.1025 in 1.1 bn, 1.1050-60 in 1.2 bn and 1.3 bn at the 1.1075 strike), while Usd/Cad is consolidating back over the big figure in the run up to Canadian inflation data. Elsewhere, the Aussie is also on the defensive into data (labour report tomorrow) within a 0.6755-25 band, albeit holding up a bit better than its Antipodean peer on favourable crosswinds as Aud/Nzd bounces firmly (1.0750+ at present).</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> The Rand and Lira are trying to withstand another bout of selling pressure in wake of more negative factors in the form of Eskom cutting power supply and more sanctions against Turkey from the US. Usd/Zar and Usd/Try have been up at 15.0500 and 5.9310, but the latter is now sub-5.9000 after probable state bank intervention.</p><p><strong>New Zealand CPI (Q3) Q/Q 0.7% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.6%). (Newswires) New Zealand CPI (Q3) Y/Y 1.5% vs. Exp. 1.4% (Prev. 1.7%)</strong></p><p>RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand said we remain vulnerable to external shocks and lower rates may still be needed to achieve targets, while he added the domestic economy is in a good place and it is a reasonable prospect for rates to go lower. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Some consolidation has seen debt futures drift from recovery highs of 172.29, 132.84 and 130.07+ for the 10 year German, UK and US benchmarks, but they all retain gains and varying degrees of safe-haven premium given renewed Brexit no deal risk, heightened geopolitical tensions and residual uncertainty about US-China trade pact Phase 1. Ahead, US retail sales may provide an interlude from all the above along with Central Bank speakers, but probably not for long.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent futures</strong> are mixed/flat with little by way of fresh catalysts for the complex as eyes remain on any US-Sino and Brexit developments alongside geopolitical news-flow. The former resides just around the 53/bbl mark after having traded on either side of the level during APAC trade, whilst its Brent counterpart trades just below the 59/bbl level as Brexit optimism spurred some gains in energy futures. In terms of production figures, TASS reported that Russian oil output in the first half of October stood at 11.23mln BPD, which is 19.7k BPD less than September levels. On the geopolitical front, the Trump Administration said that China's Cosco tankers carrying Iranian oil that shut off transponders are engaging in \"dangerous behaviour\", according to senior US officials. The announcement itself did little to sway prices but it’s worth keeping in mind future implications/impact it may have on trade talks. As a reminder, tonight will see the release of the weekly API crude inventory data. Looking at metals, gold is relatively flat within a tight range below the 1500/oz mark, albeit the yellow metal is supported by the latest Brexit sources which stated that the UK and EU are reportedly at an impasse. Meanwhile, copper is underperforming with the red metal back below the 2.60/lb mark despite seemingly bullish supply side developments with copper disruption and lower Rio Tinto copper output. ING highlights that MMG has halted almost 90% of mining capacity at its Peruvian Las Bambas mine (400k tpa) whilst Chilean mineworkers at its Carmen de Andacollo (60K tpa) have been on strike for the past two days. Further reports also stated that Antofagasta’s Antucoya (72k tpa) Chillean mine will see strikes amid a row.</p><p>CME raised NatGas Henry Hub futures margins by 10% to USD 2200 per contract from USD 2000.

In terms of the sectors; Materials (-0.8%) and Financials (-0.4%) are laggards, with the former pressured by a decline in base metal prices and a fall in yields (as bonds rebound off yesterday’s lows) pressuring the former. Conversely, Health Care (+0.5%) is an outperformer, with Roche (+0.4%) providing support after solid earnings. In terms of other notable movers; Asos (+20.1%) shares shot higher at the open after strong earnings; the Co. reported pretax earnings and revenue that exceeded forecasts. Meanwhile, disappointing numbers kept shares of ASML (-0.6%), TomTom (-5.0%) and Wacker Chemie (-1.4%) on the back foot. Elsewhere, Infineon (-1.4%) shares were under pressure following a broker downgrade at SocGen.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - The Pound’s almost interminable and total dependence on Brexit developments continues, with only a token nod to mixed/softer elements via UK CPI and PPI metrics, before returning to headline and screen watch amidst dwindling hopes that a deal can be found in time for the looming ‘deadline’. In short, prospects of a compromise on the Irish backstop and compatible customs arrange for the border looks set to be dashed at the final hour by ongoing DUP resistance, and in stark contrast to the mood late yesterday when negotiations were said to be close to draft stage. Accordingly, Cable has reversed further from around 1.2800 to just above 1.2650 before picking up again and Eur/Gbp rebounded to circa 0.8720 vs 0.8628 or so at one stage.</p><p><strong>NOK/NZD</strong> - The other G10 underperformers, as the Norwegian Krona plunges to fresh ytd lows under 10.1350 and not far from weakest levels on record on a mixture of bearish technical impulses, less supportive Norges Bank policy vibes and perhaps more data reflection/retrospection following September’s trade balance swinging from surplus to shortfall. Conversely, the Kiwi has pulled back from 0.6300+ recovery highs towards 0.6260 even though NZ CPI was a tad firmer than forecast, as subsequent comments from RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand reaffirmed that there is scope for more easing as the economy is still prone to contagion from external shocks.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR/CAD/AUD</strong> - The safe-haven Yen and Franc (plus Gold on the commodity side) have pared some losses due to the aforementioned dampened Brexit/broader risk sentiment and have both returned to range trade mode awaiting more unfolding news on top of anything else on the US-China and geopolitical front. Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf are meandering between 108.86-60 and 0.9990-62 parameters respectively, while the Euro and Loonie are also relatively contained after the former reclaimed 1.1000+ status and latter rebounded through 1.3200. Eur/Usd is currently just under 1.1050 and some tech levels close by (50 DMA at 1.1040 and a 1.1055 Fib), with decent option expiries also keeping the headline pair in check (1.1025 in 1.1 bn, 1.1050-60 in 1.2 bn and 1.3 bn at the 1.1075 strike), while Usd/Cad is consolidating back over the big figure in the run up to Canadian inflation data. Elsewhere, the Aussie is also on the defensive into data (labour report tomorrow) within a 0.6755-25 band, albeit holding up a bit better than its Antipodean peer on favourable crosswinds as Aud/Nzd bounces firmly (1.0750+ at present).</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Rand and Lira are trying to withstand another bout of selling pressure in wake of more negative factors in the form of Eskom cutting power supply and more sanctions against Turkey from the US. Usd/Zar and Usd/Try have been up at 15.0500 and 5.9310, but the latter is now sub-5.9000 after probable state bank intervention.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Some consolidation has seen debt futures drift from recovery highs of 172.29, 132.84 and 130.07+ for the 10 year <strong>German</strong>, <strong>UK</strong> and US benchmarks, but they all retain gains and varying degrees of safe-haven premium given renewed Brexit no deal risk, heightened geopolitical tensions and residual uncertainty about US-China trade pact Phase 1. Ahead, US retail sales may provide an interlude from all the above along with Central Bank speakers, but probably not for long.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are mixed/flat with little by way of fresh catalysts for the complex as eyes remain on any US-Sino and Brexit developments alongside geopolitical news-flow. The former resides just around the 53/bbl mark after having traded on either side of the level during APAC trade, whilst its Brent counterpart trades just below the 59/bbl level as Brexit optimism spurred some gains in energy futures. In terms of production figures, TASS reported that Russian oil output in the first half of October stood at 11.23mln BPD, which is 19.7k BPD less than September levels. On the geopolitical front, the Trump Administration said that China's Cosco tankers carrying Iranian oil that shut off transponders are engaging in \"dangerous behaviour\", according to senior US officials. The announcement itself did little to sway prices but it’s worth keeping in mind future implications/impact it may have on trade talks. As a reminder, tonight will see the release of the weekly API crude inventory data. Looking at metals, <strong>gold</strong> is relatively flat within a tight range below the 1500/oz mark, albeit the yellow metal is supported by the latest Brexit sources which stated that the UK and EU are reportedly at an impasse. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> is underperforming with the red metal back below the 2.60/lb mark despite seemingly bullish supply side developments with copper disruption and lower Rio Tinto copper output. ING highlights that MMG has halted almost 90% of mining capacity at its Peruvian Las Bambas mine (400k tpa) whilst Chilean mineworkers at its Carmen de Andacollo (60K tpa) have been on strike for the past two days. Further reports also stated that Antofagasta’s Antucoya (72k tpa) Chillean mine will see strikes amid a row.</p>",

Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf are meandering between 108.86-60 and 0.9990-62 parameters respectively, while the Euro and Loonie are also relatively contained after the former reclaimed 1.1000+ status and latter rebounded through 1.3200. Eur/Usd is currently just under 1.1050 and some tech levels close by (50 DMA at 1.1040 and a 1.1055 Fib), with decent option expiries also keeping the headline pair in check (1.1025 in 1.1 bn, 1.1050-60 in 1.2 bn and 1.3 bn at the 1.1075 strike), while Usd/Cad is consolidating back over the big figure in the run up to Canadian inflation data. Elsewhere, the Aussie is also on the defensive into data (labour report tomorrow) within a 0.6755-25 band, albeit holding up a bit better than its Antipodean peer on favourable crosswinds as Aud/Nzd bounces firmly (1.0750+ at present).</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Rand and Lira are trying to withstand another bout of selling pressure in wake of more negative factors in the form of Eskom cutting power supply and more sanctions against Turkey from the US. Usd/Zar and Usd/Try have been up at 15.0500 and 5.9310, but the latter is now sub-5.9000 after probable state bank intervention.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>THE LATEST: </strong>Most recently, EU Chief Brexit negotiator Barnier has told the EU Commission that he is optimistic on the prospect of achieving a deal today, reported RTE’s Connelly. However, seperate reports alleged that the EU see a Brexit deal as impossible unless the UK moves, with talks said to have reached an impasse amid DUP resistance to further concessions on the UK side, sources said. This follows overnight reports that the DUP saying “gaps” remain before they will support any fresh Brexit agreement following a meeting with PM Johnson. Additionally, they will not back a Brexit deal if UK PM Johnson makes more concessions to the EU according to a source; and that they are ruling out a customs border down the Irish Sea (which is precisely the compromise thought to have been made by UK PM Johnson). Separate reports later noted the DUP was said to be asking for billions for Northern Ireland for them to accept PM Johnson's deal, although the party has denied such claims. Prior to these developments, the EU and UK had reportedly been closing in on a draft Brexit deal, with a tentative deadline of 13.00 BST being set for the agreement on a draft text. Sources noted the fate of any Brexit deal is said to hinge on whether or not there are any more concessions from London. The deal being negotiated by Johnson is not just facing resistance from the DUP; last night reports suggested that a large split has opened up among Tory Eurosceptic ERG group on whether or not to back PM Johnson's Brexit plan. However, the official line from these groups remains a wait and see approach, with the ERG interestingly noting they will not definitely vote with the DUP.</p><p>This mixed commentary has resulted in Sterling being very volatile this morning, with Cable having reached a high of 1.2789 and a low of 1.2657 for the session thus far.</p><p><strong>DEAL, NO DEAL, OR DELAY: </strong>This morning, government sources said the chances of a Brexit deal are low, given that the DUP seem unlikely to support anything that is negotiable with the EU. The official UK government position is that it will leave on 31 October with or without a deal, but remains legally bound by the recently passed Benn Act, which mandates the government to ask for an extension should no deal have been achieved by 19 October. On this, UK Brexit Secretary Barclay told the Brexit committee that PM Johnson will write a delay letter in the event a deal is not achieved by Saturday. The EU has said that it is willing to give the UK an extension to the Brexit deadline, should it provide time for a general election or second referendum. Whether or not a deal can be reached at this week’s European Council Summit on 17-18 October is the first hurdle for the UK government; should a deal not materialise it will have to send a letter to the EU requesting an extension on Saturday. Although DUP resistance to further UK concessions appears to be a road block, should a deal be reached by the end of the week, it would go to parliament for approval on Saturday. If voted down, again, the UK government would be mandated to ask for an extension. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>LOOKING AHEAD:</strong></p><p><i>(Today)</i></p><ul><li>13.00 BST: Tentative deadline for the draft text of a deal to be agreed upon, EU Brexit Negotiator Barnier is due to brief EU ambassadors.</li><li>16.00 BST: UK Government Cabinet meeting.</li><li>19.30 BST: UK PM Johnson to meet with the 1922 Committee.</li></ul><p><i>(Later in the week)</i></p><ul><li>17 Oct – 18 Oct: EU Council Summit Meeting.</li><li>19 Oct: Special Parliamentary Sitting; if a deal at EU Council Summit, will be voted on. &nbsp;</li></ul>",

Nonetheless, <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> has slightly retreated from near 5-month highs as it remains unclear whether Johnson will have Parliamentary support for any prospective deal. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses gave back some of their risk-fuelled advances after China’s firm response to the Hong Kong interference which alongside a weaker than expected CNY fix, weighed on antipodeans and forced <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> to give back the spoils from firmer than expected CPI, while RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand also contributed to the NZD reversal as he suggested there is reasonable prospects for further rate cuts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>New Zealand CPI (Q3) Q/Q 0.7% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.6%). (Newswires) New Zealand CPI (Q3) Y/Y 1.5% vs. Exp. 1.4% (Prev. 1.7%)</strong></p><p>RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand said we remain vulnerable to external shocks and lower rates may still be needed to achieve targets, while he added the domestic economy is in a good place and it is a reasonable prospect for rates to go lower. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were uneventful overnight in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures languished just below the USD 53.00/bbl level after taking a breather from the prior day’s choppy price action in which uplift from the positive risk sentiment contended with the pressure from US-China trade concerns and IMF global growth downgrade, with focus for the complex now shifting to the holiday-delayed inventory reports including APIs due after-hours today. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> attempted to nurse some of its recent losses but still has much ground to recover after its recent hefty losses where it slipped from resistance shy of the USD 1500/oz as the rally in stocks weighed on safe-havens, while <strong>copper</strong> also mirrored the lacklustre tone across the complex and underperformance in its largest purchaser China.</p><p>CME raised NatGas Henry Hub futures margins by 10% to USD 2200 per contract from USD 2000. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong> <strong>US State Department official said the US is planning to raise sanctions on Turkey if a resolution to the crisis is not found,</strong> while it was also reported that US Senator Graham will introduce a bill on Thursday sanctioning Turkey for Syria incursion and that US prosecutors charged Turkey's Halkbank in regards to alleged Iran sanctions violations. (Newswires)</p><p>US Defense official said the US wants China to improve the enforcement of North Korea sanctions and take other measure to make North Korea more cooperative in talks. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>T-notes sold off throughout the session since the US equity cash open, as it took a leg lower on reports that the UK and EU are close to a draft deal, which saw global debt sell off. At settlement, yields were approximately 1bp higher across the curve, with the long end almost 2bp higher. On the overnight repo operations, NY Fed accepted (USD) 67.6bln out of the 75bln offered, however demand was expected to be high as today was coupon settlement day, additionally, the Fed has now begun purchasing T-Bills at an initial clip of USD 60bln a month, as it announced last week. US T-Notes (Z9) settled 14+ ticks lower at 129.24+.</p><p><strong>Fed's Daly (non-voter, dove)</strong> said the US economy and policy accommodation is currently in a good place, while Daly added that she is watching for any changes to domestic momentum or headwinds for the economy.

USD/JPY and JPY-crosses gave back some of their risk-fuelled advances after China’s firm response to the Hong Kong interference which alongside a weaker than expected CNY fix, weighed on antipodeans and forced NZD/USD to give back the spoils from firmer than expected CPI, while RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand also contributed to the NZD reversal as he suggested there is reasonable prospects for further rate cuts.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as they track the recent declines in T-notes with safe-haven demand subdued by the rally in stocks and with the BoJ also only in the market for T-bills.&nbsp;</p>",
