The tone, however, was of caution in thin trading conditions, amid punchy rhetoric from US President Trump regarding China on late Thursday, as well as underwhelming earnings from AMZN and AAPL, which were in contrast to GOOG, FB, MSFT results earlier in the week. Tesla (TSLA) announced it has reduced the cost of its China-made Model 3 by 10% to qualify for subsidies. During hours CEO Musk Tweeted in his opinion that the stock is currently too high, although it was initially unclear whether or not he was hacked as the post was followed with a string of peculiar tweets afterwards.

Rates had been heading lower overnight, with one desk noting passive month-end index-linked purchasing. However, as the US session got underway the gains were gradually reversed, despite wider risk off amid a cocktail of anti-China rhetoric and disappointing AMZN/AAPL earnings. A slightly better than expected headline ISM manufacturing managed provide some support to the risk tone, nudging T-Notes lower somewhat, although moves were very contained. On the supply front, corporate issuance cooled to end the week following the Boeing jumbo USD 25bln deal on Thursday, although investors may be cautious about bidding rates lower ahead of next week’s Treasury refunding announcement (May 6th), where the Treasury will explain how it plans to funds its ballooning deficit (it will likely launch the much touted 20-year Bond); furthermore, with corporates emerging from the other side of earnings, companies will be likely to flood the pipeline with debt offerings as many look to pay off short term credit facilities that have been maxed out amid the economy standstill. Elsewhere, the NY Fed announced it would be tapering its Treasury purchases to USD 8bln per day for next week from this week’s USD 10bln – note that the pace of the tapering has been declining in recent weeks, where last week it cut to USD 10bln from USD 15bln per day. By settlement, yields were little changed, 2s +1bps at 0.20%, 10s +1bps at 0.63%, and 30s unchanged at 1.27%. US T-note futures (M0) settled 6 ticks lower at 138-28.</p>",
