Desks have noted the resilience of US stocks while those in China, for instance, saw significant downside. From there, losses were gradually pared, helped along by some constructive remarks from NIH Director Fauci on Moderna’s (MRNA) hopeful COVID vaccine. Stock futures ticked higher, gravitating towards its 5dma, where it was happy to stay after the Europeans left for the week. In the latter part of the US day, stock futures made a run for the session high, which some attributed to news that the White House was to launch a huge testing initiative. and a late surge took the ES back to HOD. Yields were lower along the Treasury curve, with a modest flattening bias. The crude complex is still suffering losses, however, with some desk mindful of what US/China tensions will mean for the world’s largest crude importer from the demand-side of the equation. The dollar is green for a second day, and ends the week in the red; the broader (approx.) 99-101 range is still intact. Action was thinner in the latter part of the session as players left early for the long weekend (desk hours and market closures <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/notice-due-to-the-upcoming-uk-bank-holiday-and-us-memorial-day-holiday-on-monday-25th-may-the-desk-will-be-running-a-reduced-service-alongside-the-subsequent-market-closures-22-05-2020\">here</a>).</p><h2><strong>VACCINE</strong></h2><p><strong>MRNA/GILD: </strong>NIH Dr. Fauci, speaking to NPR, said that having looked at the Moderna (MRNA) data itself, it was quite promising, though he acknowledged that the full data had not been peer reviewed; still, he is “cautiously optimistic” that the vaccine could be ready to deploy at the end of 2020 or early 2021. Fauci confirmed the data would be peer reviewed within weeks. To recap, on Monday the Phase 1 MRNA vaccine results were described by Moderna to be positive, which saw risk appetite emboldened. However, on Tuesday, a STAT News article highlighting the scientific limits of the announcement, such as the small 8-person sample size, making it near impossible to draw conclusions at this stage. Later, Fauci on Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir stated that the study was statistically significant, although the results were modest, adding we can build on the success of remdesivir. Elsewhere, US doctors and others are calling for the data that convinced health regulators to authorise emergency use of Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir to be released.</p><p><strong>TESTING: </strong>US will reportedly test experimental coronavirus vaccines in 100k people or more, adding the vaccine candidate from Oxford University may be tested side by side with Moderna's (MRNA) from July, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK) and Sanofi (SAN FP), vaccines could be added in the summer.</p><p><strong>HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE: </strong>Hydroxycholoroquine test results published in The Lancet journal, across 96k patients, showed that there was no significant difference in COVID patients treated with the drug, according to Washington Post. David Maron, director of preventive cardiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said that “these findings provide absolutely no reason for optimism that these drugs might be useful in the prevention or treatment of covid-19”. It showed that patients were more likely to suffer irregular heart-beat rhythms. The former top FDA official said it is now time to revoke the emergency FDA authorisation for the drug. Reminder, the use of hydroxychloroquine saw a warning from the FDA and the NIH did not recommend using the drug.</p><p><strong>OXFORD UNIVERSITY: </strong>AstraZeneca (AZN LN) and Oxford University are to start Phase II/III human trials for COVID-19 vaccine. The next study will enrol up to 10.26k adults and children and involve a number of partners across the country.</p><h2><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></h2><p><strong>CHINA NPC: </strong>China Premier Li Keqiang announced Beijing would scrap its growth target this year and introduced national security law which allows it to bypass Hong Kong's lawmakers, which pro-democracy activists fear it could mean the effective end of Hong Kong’s autonomy. In terms of the economic metrics, it abandoned its 2020 GDP target due to the COVID19 pandemic and uncertainties. It is, however, targeting a fiscal deficit of 3.6%/GDP (from 2.8% in 2019), which some analysts have taken as a sign that China does not intend to significantly ramp up fiscal stimulus. China aims to create 9mln jobs in 2020 (it’s 2019 target was 11mln), and joblessness will be capped at 6%. China also fixed the quota on local-government special bond issuance at CNY 3.75trln (prev. CNY 2.15trln). It will debut 1trln of special treasury bonds in 2020, and transfer CNY 2trln raised from the bigger 2020 budget deficit and special anti-coronavirus treasury bonds to local governments, Reuters reported. These local government bonds could be used to fund infrastructure projects, while special treasury bonds could be used to support firms and regions hit by the outbreak. A Reuters calculation suggests these fiscal measures are worth about 4.1% of china's GDP.</p><p><strong>NATIONAL SECURITY LAW: </strong>The security law, which weighed on sentiment, could allow China to bypass lawmakers in Hong Kong thus still having some control of the country which goes against the “one country, two systems” principle, which has in the past led to widespread protests. The law has also faced criticism from the US where President Trump stated the US would have a very strong reaction, while the Senate introduced a bill that would sanction Chinese officials and entities who enforce the new national security laws. The NPC Committee says as far as they know, the Hong Kong legislation is ready, which will be passed in the next meeting of the NPC Standing Committee, which could be passed into law after resolutions are voted on May 28th, according to Global Times. Following the law, White House Economic Adviser Hassett noted that the developments in Hong Kong will be very bad for the Chinese economy.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>ECB MINUTES: </strong>The account of the ECB's April meeting passed with little fanfare, with the main takeaway being that the Governing Council is \"fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition by as much as necessary and for as long as needed\"; a line that concluded the policy statement last month. In terms of the current stock of actions, however, \"the view was widely shared that the Governing Council’s monetary policy measures taken in March, and reinforced by decisions taken on the collateral framework in April, had provided forceful monetary accommodation\". That said (and in-fitting with communications from the Bank), it was judged that monetary policy alone could not address some of the Eurozone's issues and fiscal authorities needed to play their role in combating the crisis. As such, any developments on the Eurozone Recovery Fund could play a key role in shaping the narrative ahead of the ECB's next meeting on the 4th June. Also at the June meeting, market participants will be presented with the latest round of staff economic projections, ahead of which, the account revealed that \"it was generally considered that, of the three scenarios presented, the 'mild' scenario was probably already too optimistic\". Overall, the account provided little in the way of fresh insight into the current train of thought on the Governing Council, however, given the apparent lack of dissent among policymakers, it appears that the beginning of Lagarde's tenure is a more united one than the end of Draghi's.</p><p><strong>BOE: </strong>BoE Deputy Governor Ramsden says it is possible BoE will do more QE at the June meeting or subsequently. He joined Bailey, Haldane and Tenreyo on NIRP commentary, stating it is reasonable to have an open mind on negative rates but it is complex. Ramsden added there is plenty of headroom for conventional QE Gilt purchases. He noted the UK economic upturn will be less sharp than downturn, adding indicators suggests Q2 GDP could fall slightly less than BoE's May scenario, but it is still early days. The Deputy Governor does not see a case for purchase of linkers or Gilts maturing under 3yrs.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>T-Note futures (M0) settle 3 ticks higher at 139-05</strong></p><p>The TPLEX bull-flattened to end the week as participants withdrew risk exposure ahead of the long weekend, rising US-China tensions over Hong Kong, and disappointing China growth/stimulus targets. By settlement, 2s unchanged at 0.17% and 30s -3bps at 1.37%. Yields made their lows overnight, alongside equity futures, on the tails of the lacklustre China deficit target and lack of concrete GDP target. Additionally, China continues to move ahead with its Hong Kong security law – seeing the Hang Seng Index trade with losses over 7% – which amplifies the already strained Sino-US relations. However, as the US session came into the horizon, equity futures and yields began to climb back higher finding support from Fauci comments – the overnight US 10-year low stood at just below 63bp and currently stands at 66bp – and after the US equity open, yields traded rangebound through till settlement. Corporate issuance was light today as activity quiets down going into the holiday weekend. Meanwhile, the Fed’s week-ahead Treasury/TIPS purchase schedule, which again cut daily purchases to USD 5bln per day (prev. 6bln), failed to alter the dial in price action. Note, UST June futures are now entering their roll period, with First Intention next Thursday evening (May 28th) – based on June/September OI, the process is already 25% complete – thus an element of book squaring is likely to be seen in the tape action in the coming sessions. Furthermore, as month-end rebalancing approaches, the Bloomberg Barclays UST Aggregate index is due to extend by 0.12-years (vs 12-month average of 0.08-year), thus supporting USTs into June.</p><p>NY FED: The NY Fed cut its Treasuries/TIPS purchases to USD 20bln a week from USD 30bln; USD 5bln per day for next week (prev.

The losses came overnight in APAC trade as sentiment got knocked after China/US tensions deteriorated and the announced Chinese budget deficit target was less than some had expected, in addition to the lack of a specific GDP target. Furthermore, with Hong Kong tensions back in the limelight, and an impressive six-day rally in crude, many longs are likely to close positions to limit their risk exposure over the long weekend. Elsewhere today, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said OPEC+ members must remain committed to production cuts despite signs oil demand is starting to recover; “there are tentative signs of recovery and we believe the worst is behind us.” Meanwhile, the latest US Baker Hughes rig count (w/e 22nd May) saw oil rigs -21 at 237, nat gas. unchanged at 79, and total rigs -21 at 318 – note that Y/Y, total rigs have fallen by 665.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.2% at 2,955, NDX +0.4% at 9,414, DJIA -0.0% at 24,465.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Energy -0.6%, materials -0.2%, industrials -0.2%, consumer discretionary -0.2%, consumer staples +0.3%, healthcare +0.2%, financials -0.3%, IT +0.4%, telecoms +0.5%, utilities +1.1%</p><p><strong>EUROPE CLOSES: EURO STOXX 50 (+0.1%) at 2907, FTSE 100 (-0.4%) at 5991, DAX (+0.1%) at 11,051, CAC 40 (+0.1%) at 4451, IBEX 35 (+0.1%) at 6693, FTSE MIB (+1.3%) at 17,305, SMI (-1.1%) at 9684</strong></p><p><strong>NVIDIA: </strong>Nvidia (NVDA) overall saw a solid report, beating on top and bottom line, authorizing a USD 7.24bln share repurchase programme while maintaining its dividend commitment.&nbsp; Data Center revenue also topped estimates. Its gaming revenue also beat, although was still down Q/Q &amp; Y/Y; perhaps disappointing some given the large increase in other gaming names. GM was slightly lower than expected. NVDA saw choppy trade after its release but trade higher as the market recovers from overnight lows. Overall a solid report, although analysts suggest given the run NVDA has seen recently perhaps the figures were not enough to continue the trend further. UBS raised its PT on the name to USD 400 from USD 330 noting how the how the relationship of its GPU and CPU performance overall is becoming decoupled, which the desk suggests “NVDA can bring more flexible computing solutions to customers on a massive scale”.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Deere (DE) beat on EPS and revenue but it expects global equipment sales to fall 30-40% this year. Foot Locker (FL) missed on EPS and revenue while SSS also fared worse and it temporarily suspended its dividend. Alibaba (BABA) beat on EPS and revenue driven by an increase in online purchases during lockdown, while MAU’s rose to 846mln and annual active users rose to 726mln. BABA is keeping a close eye on the US Senator Bill on Chinese Co.’s. Hewlett Packard (HPE) missed on EPS and revenue; announced a cost cutting plan to save USD 1bln by 2022. Intuit (INTU) missed on EPS and revenue after the IRS tax filing deadline hampered its business as it caused millions of filings to shift to later in the season.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>eBay’s (EBAY) classified advertisement business reportedly received a bid from Germany’s Axel Springer (SPR GY), backed by KKR (KKR), according to FT sources. Note, initial reports that the business was for sale (back in February), suggested the unit could be worth as much as USD 10bln. General Motors (GM) reportedly delayed the resumption of the second shift at three of its truck plants in North America that were initially scheduled for Monday. Meanwhile, separate reports noted a shortage of parts in Mexico is hampering its plans to increase production of its pickup trucks. Amazon (AMZN) plans to hire 50k workers in India. IBM (IBM) is reportedly set to cut an unspecified number of jobs, the first reduction of workers under its new CEO. Lululemon (LULU) announced it has reopened over 150 retail locations and plans to open 200 more over the next two weeks while stores will have new safety/cleansing guidelines. BestBuy (BBY) announced it plans to reopen roughly 600 stores to the public by June 13th. KKR (KKR) took a stake in US Foods (USFD). Irish authorities have submitted draft decision of probe into Twitter (TWTR) to EU states; has sent prelim draft to Facebook (FB) owned Whatsapp; says making progress in three other investigations relating to FB.</p><h2><strong>WEEKLY FX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>CURRENCY MARKETS BEHOLDEN TO BREWING ANGST BETWEEN BEIJING AND WASHINGTON</strong></p><p><strong>USD: </strong>Friday’s Dollar-G10 standings and directional moves provide a pretty accurate picture of the mood as a whole if not the complete story given intermittent deviations and distractions from the main theme driving sentiment in the form of a further deterioration in US-China relations regarding COVID-19, but expanding to encompass a host of other contentious issues. On that note, the latest intervention from Beijing at the NPC to pass legislation against perceived national security threats in Hong Kong has irked Washington to the degree of condemnation and China’s Foreign Ministry has threatened to retaliate if the US tries to oppress the country via sanctions. The simmering tensions and potential risk to trade, military and all existing pacts between the 2 nations has dampened sentiment after an optimistic start to the week forged on global economies reopening and daily rates of coronavirus infections/fatalities continuing to slow, in the main. Hence, the DXY is back in the ascendency from lowly beginnings and towards the upper end of 100.470-99.001 extremes, albeit unable to reclaim 100.000 after more data and survey-based evidence of the fallout from the global pandemic, like weekly jobless claims for the May NFP reporting period pushing the total since the outbreak up to almost 40 mn. For the record, Fed rhetoric including several speeches from chair Powell was largely consistent with guidance at the last policy meeting and reaffirmed via the minutes, but the clear message remains that while more stimulus is likely to be needed (monetary and fiscal), NIRP is not on the current agenda given mixed assessments about the effectiveness of negative rates.</p><p><strong>AUD, CAD, NZD: </strong>The commodity bloc has been volatile amidst swings in underlying prices and overall sentiment, but with some specific and independent inputs via macro releases and Central Bank commentary. In short, the hard data has been bad, though not unexpected, but the RBA and RBNZ have both intimated there is more in the tool-kit if required including additional QE, rate cuts and other more liquidity focused measures, just not on the very near term agenda as they shift to a wait-and-see stance. Meanwhile, the Loonie has been mostly supported by the strengthening recovery in crude that reached a crescendo over the June WTI contract expiry in start contrast to the previous front month, but has waned into the long US (and UK) holiday weekend, and a sharp slide in retail sales (akin to elsewhere, and for Australia a record drop) has undermined the Cad as well. Back down under, the Aussie also had to acknowledge, if not accept a Fitch outlook downgrade from stable to negative that could see the sovereign lose its top-notch AAA ratings status, in theory, on top of higher export tariffs on key goods to China.</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP: </strong>The Euro and Pound have also witnessed very choppy trading conditions with Eur/Usd reaching dizzy 1.1000+ heights on a combination of encouraging Eurozone preliminary PMIs (pan indices more so than German or French) and follow-through from the big 2 finally agreeing that joint EU debt should contribute towards the financing of the Eur500 bn rescue fund. However, the headline pair is back below 1.0900 vs a circa 1.0800 low awaiting final approval for the fiscal support next week amidst more ECB pledges that additional QE will be delivered (and perhaps as soon as June) if required, and with full use of APP/PEPP flexibility irrespective of the German legal ruling on proportionality. Elsewhere, the bearish seasonal spell is still casting shadows over Sterling, with Cable down below 1.2100 and Eur/Gbp up to almost 0.9000 at one stage, but the Pound also had to digest dire UK jobs, retail sales and benign inflation vs improvements in PMI plus dovish BoE rhetoric from Haldane in particular, but also other MPC members like Tenreyro and Governor Bailey all not ruling out NIRP even though the concept of sub-zero rates is complex.</p><p><strong>SCANDI, EM: </strong>Aside from the aforementioned oil renaissance that lasted until today, bullish technical impulses have carried the Swedish and Norwegian Crowns to fresh pinnacles vs the Euro, and EMs remain on course to register net gains against the Dollar irrespective of a mixed end to the week. Retracement and ongoing corrections from record or multi-year troughs have prompted more short covering, while the Brl has benefited from ramped up intervention. However, 50 bp rate cuts have hampered the Try and Zar to varying degrees and the Rub has been undermined by dovish CBR remarks from the Governor intimating at the prospect of full point ease in June, in stark contrast to the Idr that took an unexpected 40 bp reduction from the RBI effectively in stride. Last, but by no means least, the Yuan has depreciated on the rising acrimony between China and the US noted above, with Usd/Cnh over 7.1600 earlier and within a whisker of March highs around 7.1650 after the NPC omitted to set an official 2020 GDP target, as speculated, but still worrying in terms of the global economy given 2nd wave virus risks.</p>",

By settlement, 2s unchanged at 0.17% and 30s -3bps at 1.37%. Yields made their lows overnight, alongside equity futures, on the tails of the lacklustre China deficit target and lack of concrete GDP target. Additionally, China continues to move ahead with its Hong Kong security law – seeing the Hang Seng Index trade with losses over 7% – which amplifies the already strained Sino-US relations. However, as the US session came into the horizon, equity futures and yields began to climb back higher finding support from Fauci comments – the overnight US 10-year low stood at just below 63bp and currently stands at 66bp – and after the US equity open, yields traded rangebound through till settlement. Corporate issuance was light today as activity quiets down going into the holiday weekend. Meanwhile, the Fed’s week-ahead Treasury/TIPS purchase schedule, which again cut daily purchases to USD 5bln per day (prev. 6bln), failed to alter the dial in price action. Note, UST June futures are now entering their roll period, with First Intention next Thursday evening (May 28th) – based on June/September OI, the process is already 25% complete – thus an element of book squaring is likely to be seen in the tape action in the coming sessions. Furthermore, as month-end rebalancing approaches, the Bloomberg Barclays UST Aggregate index is due to extend by 0.12-years (vs 12-month average of 0.08-year), thus supporting USTs into June.</p>",

The losses came overnight in APAC trade as sentiment got knocked after China/US tensions deteriorated and the announced Chinese budget deficit target was less than some had expected, in addition to the lack of a specific GDP target. Furthermore, with Hong Kong tensions back in the limelight, and an impressive six-day rally in crude, many longs are likely to close positions to limit their risk exposure over the long weekend. Elsewhere today, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said OPEC+ members must remain committed to production cuts despite signs oil demand is starting to recover; “there are tentative signs of recovery and we believe the worst is behind us.” Meanwhile, the latest US Baker Hughes rig count (w/e 22nd May) saw oil rigs -21 at 237, nat gas. unchanged at 79, and total rigs -21 at 318 – note that Y/Y, total rigs have fallen by 665.</p>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: currency markets beholden to brewing angst between Beijing and Washington",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Friday’s Dollar-G10 standings and directional moves provide a pretty accurate picture of the mood as a whole if not the complete story given intermittent deviations and distractions from the main theme driving sentiment in the form of a further deterioration in US-China relations regarding COVID-19, but expanding to encompass a host of other contentious issues. On that note, the latest intervention from Beijing at the NPC to pass legislation against perceived national security threats in Hong Kong has irked Washington to the degree of condemnation and China’s Foreign Ministry has threatened to retaliate if the US tries to oppress the country via sanctions. The simmering tensions and potential risk to trade, military and all existing pacts between the 2 nations has dampened sentiment after an optimistic start to the week forged on global economies reopening and daily rates of coronavirus infections/fatalities continuing to slow, in the main. Hence, the <strong>DXY</strong> is back in the ascendency from lowly beginnings and towards the upper end of 100.470-99.001 extremes, albeit unable to reclaim 100.000 after more data and survey-based evidence of the fallout from the global pandemic, like weekly jobless claims for the May NFP reporting period pushing the total since the outbreak up to almost 40 mn. For the record, Fed rhetoric including several speeches from chair Powell was largely consistent with guidance at the last policy meeting and reaffirmed via the minutes, but the clear message remains that while more stimulus is likely to be needed (monetary and fiscal), NIRP is not on the current agenda given mixed assessments about the effectiveness of negative rates.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The commodity bloc has been volatile amidst swings in underlying prices and overall sentiment, but with some specific and independent inputs via macro releases and Central Bank commentary. In short, the hard data has been bad, though not unexpected, but the RBA and RBNZ have both intimated there is more in the tool-kit if required including additional QE, rate cuts and other more liquidity focused measures, just not on the very near term agenda as they shift to a wait-and-see stance. Meanwhile, the Loonie has been mostly supported by the strengthening recovery in crude that reached a crescendo over the June WTI contract expiry in start contrast to the previous front month, but has waned into the long US (and UK) holiday weekend, and a sharp slide in retail sales (akin to elsewhere, and for Australia a record drop) has undermined the Cad as well. Back down under, the Aussie also had to acknowledge, if not accept a Fitch outlook downgrade from stable to negative that could see the sovereign lose its top-notch AAA ratings status, in theory, on top of higher export tariffs on key goods to China.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>The Euro and Pound have also witnessed very choppy trading conditions with Eur/Usd reaching dizzy 1.1000+ heights on a combination of encouraging Eurozone preliminary PMIs (pan indices more so than German or French) and follow-through from the big 2 finally agreeing that joint EU debt should contribute towards the financing of the Eur500 bn rescue fund. However, the headline pair is back below 1.0900 vs a circa 1.0800 low awaiting final approval for the fiscal support next week amidst more ECB pledges that additional QE will be delivered (and perhaps as soon as June) if required, and with full use of APP/PEPP flexibility irrespective of the German legal ruling on proportionality. Elsewhere, the bearish seasonal spell is still casting shadows over Sterling, with Cable down below 1.2100 and Eur/Gbp up to almost 0.9000 at one stage, but the Pound also had to digest dire UK jobs, retail sales and benign inflation vs improvements in PMI plus dovish BoE rhetoric from Haldane in particular, but also other MPC members like Tenreyro and Governor Bailey all not ruling out NIRP even though the concept of sub-zero rates is complex.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>Aside from the aforementioned oil renaissance that lasted until today, bullish technical impulses have carried the Swedish and Norwegian Crowns to fresh pinnacles vs the Euro, and EMs remain on course to register net gains against the Dollar irrespective of a mixed end to the week. Retracement and ongoing corrections from record or multi-year troughs have prompted more short covering, while the Brl has benefited from ramped up intervention. However, 50 bp rate cuts have hampered the Try and Zar to varying degrees and the Rub has been undermined by dovish CBR remarks from the Governor intimating at the prospect of full point ease in June, in stark contrast to the Idr that took an unexpected 40 bp reduction from the RBI effectively in stride. Last, but by no means least, the Yuan has depreciated on the rising acrimony between China and the US noted above, with Usd/Cnh over 7.1600 earlier and within a whisker of March highs around 7.1650 after the NPC omitted to set an official 2020 GDP target, as speculated, but still worrying in terms of the global economy given 2nd wave virus risks.</p>",

In the pre-market, some positive commentary from the NIH’s Fauci saw futures pare losses, though sentiment still remains fragile. Most sectors open in the red, although Real Estate is positive while defensives, Staples and Utilities, are flat; as is Technology. Energy underperforms amid a fall in oil prices, and Financials are also lower. Treasuries are bull-flattening, the dollar is up for a second day, putting pressure on EMFX and risk sensitive currencies, and even oil is taking its cues from the risk complex today despite bullish inventory data over the last two weeks. The ECB minutes saw little new information; reiterated its pledge to increase the size and adjust the composition of its PEPP if required. Ahead, the NY Fed will announce next week's asset purchase schedule at 1400 EDT/1900 BST (<a href=\"US%20equities%20have%20opened%20in%20the%20red,%20following%20the%20leads%20in%20Europe%20and%20Asia,%20after%20risk-off%20themes%20developed%20overnight;%20China%20announced%20a%20security%20law%20that%20could%20allow%20it%20to%20bypass%20lawmakers%20in%20Hong%20Kong.%20In%20the%20pre-market,%20some%20positive%20commentary%20from%20the%20NIH’s%20Fauci%20saw%20futures%20pare%20losses,%20though%20sentiment%20still%20remains%20fragile.%20STICK%20SECTORS%20HERE.%20Treasuries%20are%20bull-flattening,%20the%20dollar%20is%20up%20for%20a%20second%20day,%20putting%20pressure%20on%20EMFX%20and%20risk%20sensitive%20currencies,%20and%20even%20oil%20is%20taking%20its%20cues%20from%20the%20risk%20complex%20today%20despite%20bullish%20inventory%20data%20over%20the%20last%20two%20weeks.%20The%20ECB%20minutes%20saw%20little%20new%20information;%20reiterated%20its%20pledge%20to%20increase%20the%20size%20and%20adjust%20the%20composition%20of%20its%20PEPP%20if%20required.%20Ahead,%20the%20NY%20Fed%20will%20announce%20next%20week's%20asset%20purchase%20schedule%20at%201400%20EDT/1900%20BST%20(preview);%20we%20expect%20liquidity%20conditions%20to%20tail-off%20in%20the%20afternoon%20as%20US%20and%20UK%20players%20eye%20a%20long-weekend.\">preview</a>); we expect liquidity conditions to tail-off in the afternoon as US and UK players eye a long-weekend.</p><p><strong>NOTICE: </strong>Due to the upcoming UK bank holiday and US Memorial Day holiday on Monday 25th May, the desk will be running a reduced service alongside the subsequent market closures.

Its gaming revenue also beat, although was still down Q/Q &amp; Y/Y; perhaps disappointing some given the large increase in other gaming names. GM was slightly lower than expected. NVDA saw choppy trade after its release but trade higher as the market recovers from overnight lows. Overall a solid report, although analysts suggest given the run NVDA has seen recently perhaps the figures were not enough to continue the trend further. UBS raised its PT on the name to USD 400 from USD 330 noting how the how the relationship of its GPU and CPU performance overall is becoming decoupled, which the desk suggests “NVDA can bring more flexible computing solutions to customers on a massive scale”.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Deere (DE) beat on EPS and revenue but it expects global equipment sales to fall 30-40% this year. Foot Locker (FL) missed on EPS and revenue while SSS also fared worse and it temporarily suspended its dividend. Alibaba (BABA) beat on EPS and revenue driven by an increase in online purchases during lockdown, while MAU’s rose to 846mln and annual active users rose to 726mln. BABA is keeping a close eye on the US Senator Bill on Chinese Co.’s. Hewlett Packard (HPE) missed on EPS and revenue; announced a cost cutting plan to save USD 1bln by 2022. Intuit (INTU) missed on EPS and revenue after the IRS tax filing deadline hampered its business as it caused millions of filings to shift to later in the season.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>US doctors and others are calling for the data that convinced health regulators to authorise emergency use of Gilead’s (GILD) remdesivir to be released. Amazon (AMZN) plans to hire 50k workers in India. IBM (IBM) is reportedly set to cut an unspecified number of jobs, the first reduction of workers under its new CEO. Lululemon (LULU) announced it has reopened over 150 retail locations and plans to open 200 more over the next two weeks while stores will have new safety/cleansing guidelines.

Nomura's quants think the improvement in sentiment will not take a breather, although points out that technically foreseeable risk-off phases tend to not last too long: \"Bearish investors that had been counting on a stock market double dip already appear to be backing out of the trades they had made on that assumption, and it seems that few investors are attempting to chase the market down,\" the bank says, \"it may make sense for now to buy whatever dips come along and wait to see what happens.\" Nomura says that CTAs seem reticent to tweak positions much, and NDX futures are the only US equity futures where CTAs have already gone back to accumulating longs. \"Given that the NASDAQ 100 is the only US stock market index in a clear uptrend, we soon expect to see CTAs plainly building up their net long position again, perhaps even next week although possibly not until 5 June.\" Growth and momentum appear to be the preferred strategies, the quants say, given that 10-year yields are beneath what it calls the 'trigger line' of 0.84% and US economic surprises are not yet improving, investors seem to be sticking with momentum for a lack of better alternatives. Nomura sees global macro hedge funds actively staking out new positions, premised on a main scenario in which the US-China stand-off intensifies. \"This leaves hedge funds fairly neutrally positioned with regard to US-China risk; a flare-up in the stand-off still stands as a tail risk, however, and should this risk materialise, these hedge funds could end up taking a punch that is difficult to roll with.\" Meanwhile, CTA exposure to China-related equity futures (total for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) is essentially flat, Nomura says, and it sees no increase in technically driven downside trades. \"However, if we look at the relative performance of cyclicals over defensives in cash equity markets, we find that the pick-up in the performance of cyclicals has been weak in Asia, and what this suggests to us that that the market thinks the US economy will recover more quickly than the economies of Asia.\"</p><p><strong>CHINA NATIONAL SECURITY LAW:</strong> The security law, which weighed on sentiment, could allow China to bypass lawmakers in Hong Kong thus still having some control of the country which goes against the “one country, two systems” principle, which has in the past led to widespread protests. The law has also faced criticism from the US where President Trump stated the US would have a very strong reaction, while the Senate introduced a bill that would sanction Chinese officials and entities who enforce the new national security laws.</p>",

(-1.4%)</strong> were lower amid the start of China’s Two Sessions conclave where the Government Work Report refrained from setting an economic growth target but pledged to reduce tax and fee burdens for companies by CNY 2.5tln this year and use several tools to keep liquidity ample. Furthermore, the losses in Hong Kong were exacerbated after China’s attempts to tighten its grip on the Special Administrative Region through a new national security law, and is likely to stoke further unrest for the region which had already been mired by months of protests since the middle of last year. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively uninspired with only mild upside seen despite the downbeat risk tone and upside in T-notes, while the conclusion of the BoJ’s emergency meeting and announcement of a new lending scheme also failed to spur any meaningful price action.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day.

Back to Europe, peripheries fare better than the core markets, whilst the FTSE 100 (-0.9%) and SMI (-1.4%) lag European peers, albeit the former weighed on by energy, materials and financials and the latter more-so on catch-up play. Sectors are red across the board but do not reflect a clear risk tone as specific sectors take hits on Hong Kong woes - with Financials and Energy underperforming, the latter amid price action in the complex and the former dragged by a lower yield environment alongside Hong Kong-exposed banks plumbing the depths; HSBC (-5.4%) and Standard Chartered (-4.0%). The wide US-China implication and downbeat sentiment prompts materials sector to trade on a poor footing. Fears of protests also see luxury names on the backfoot; LVMH (-1.2%), Kering (-1.2%), Richemont (-3.1%), Swatch (-1.1%) hold onto losses. In terms of other individual movers: Burberry (+1.8%) holds onto gains after the Co. said it can weather the pandemic with a strong balance sheet and protected liquidity.

Moreover, confirmation that Beijing is not setting an official 2020 growth target and the NPC drafting legislation on national security for Hong Kong have ruffled the Yuan, with the latter also adding yet another point of dispute to the increasingly long list jeopardising already strained relations between the 2 nations. In terms of the wider repercussions, risk sentiment has deteriorated further to the benefit of the Greenback above all rivals bar the Yen, as the DXY extends its rebound from recent lows and at least 2 close scrapes with the 99.000 level to a 99.838 high, and still seemingly on the up.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/EUR/GBP/NZD -</strong> No surprise to see the Aussie bearing the brunt of the latest Washington-Beijing spat, especially as the Hong Kong Dollar is pegged, but Aud/Usd and Aud/Nzd have also retreated in response to Fitch downgrading the sovereign’s triple A ratings outlook to negative from stable. The former is now hovering nearer 0.6500 from 0.6600+ yesterday and the latter is down through 1.0700 compared to a 1.0830 apex earlier in the week, as the Kiwi manages to stay within sight of 0.6100 against its US counterpart following comments from NZ Finance Minister Robertson about formative discussions on the topic of helicopter money. Meanwhile, the Euro has handed back more gains vs the Buck after its fleeting or false break over the 1.1000 mark on Thursday and has been back under the round number below, but not quite far enough to stir hefty option expiry interest between 1.0885-75 in 2.8 bn. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost its oil prop and trying to contain declines through 1.400 ahead of Canadian retail sales data, and on that very note Cable is straddling 1.2200 and the Eur/Gbp cross 0.8950 after weaker than expected UK consumption rattled Sterling somewhat more than equally bad public sector finances and tripped some stops in the former at 1.2180. However, underlying bids said to be sitting from 1.2160 to 1.2150 have not been troubled so far.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong> - As noted above, the Yen is marginally outperforming vs the Greenback, albeit still rangebound either side of 107.50 and only retaining an element of safe-haven premium after no shocks from the inter-schedule BoJ meeting or more recent joint statement from Governor Kuroda and Japanese Finance Minister Aso expanding on the rationale behind new bank lending provisions. Conversely, Usd/Chf remains elevated on the 0.9700 handle, but the Franc is still unwinding losses relative to the Euro and probing 1.0600 ahead of the ECB minutes (full preview available via the headline feed) and next Monday’s Swiss bank sight deposit balance update.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Aside from broad depreciation on risk aversion, the Indian Rupiah got an unexpected 40 bp RBI rate cut to contend with, though Usd/Idr has reversed after a knee-jerk jump to trade lower on the day.</p><p>Fitch revised Australia’s Outlook from Stable to Negative, affirmed rating at AAA. (Newswires)</p><p>New Zealand Finance Minister Robertson said helicopter money is being discussed but not at a level where we have details how it will work, while he added they are keen to make sure fiscal policy remains with the government. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p><strong>Core bonds</strong> have lost momentum coinciding with a grinding recovery in EU stocks that suggests normal inverse asset correlations have comeback in to play at least partially, and of course the debt/equity trade-off is likely to become more compelling into month end, especially as portfolio rebalancing rears again. On that note, one major bank notes an especially lengthy duration extension for <strong>US Treasuries</strong> that could keep the complex afloat and the curve continue to flatten. However, Bunds have drifted back from 173.52 at best and <strong>Gilts</strong> from 138.99 ahead of ECB minutes and a blank US agenda into the long holiday weekend that also sees UK markets shut on May 25.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI </strong>and<strong> Brent </strong>front month futures experience substantial intraday losses as sentiment takes a hit from developments regarding the Hong Kong legislations as well as wider implications such as escalating trade tensions with the US and souring sentiment with the UK. As such, clear risk aversion is seen – with WTI and Brent July around USD 31.50/bbl and 34/bbl, down around 7% and 5% respectively and with current bases at USD 30.70/bbl and USD 33.50/bbl respectively. <strong>Spot gold</strong> sees haven demand, residing towards the top-end of its USD 1725-38/oz current range. <strong>Copper</strong> prices gapped lower below USD 2.4/lb and holds onto sentiment-driven losses, with some also attributing the downside to China refraining from assigning a GDP target.</p>",

It is, however, targeting a fiscal deficit of 3.6%/GDP (from 2.8% in 2019), which some analysts have taken as a sign that China does not intend to significantly ramp up fiscal stimulus. China aims to create 9mln jobs in 2020 (it’s 2019 target was 11mln), and joblessness will be capped at 6%. China also fixed the quota on local-government special bond issuance at CNY 3.75trln (prev. CNY 2.15trln).

Nomura's quants think the improvement in sentiment will not take a breather, although points out that technically foreseeable risk-off phases tend to not last too long: \"Bearish investors that had been counting on a stock market double dip already appear to be backing out of the trades they had made on that assumption, and it seems that few investors are attempting to chase the market down,\" the bank says, \"it may make sense for now to buy whatever dips come along and wait to see what happens.\" Nomura says that CTAs seem reticent to tweak positions much, and NDX futures are the only US equity futures where CTAs have already gone back to accumulating longs. \"Given that the NASDAQ 100 is the only US stock market index in a clear uptrend, we soon expect to see CTAs plainly building up their net long position again, perhaps even next week although possibly not until 5 June.\" Growth and momentum appear to be the preferred strategies, the quants say, given that 10-year yields are beneath what it calls the 'trigger line' of 0.84% and US economic surprises are not yet improving, investors seem to be sticking with momentum for a lack of better alternatives. Nomura sees global macro hedge funds actively staking out new positions, premised on a main scenario in which the US-China stand-off intensifies. \"This leaves hedge funds fairly neutrally positioned with regard to US-China risk; a flare-up in the stand-off still stands as a tail risk, however, and should this risk materialise, these hedge funds could end up taking a punch that is difficult to roll with.\" Meanwhile, CTA exposure to China-related equity futures (total for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) is essentially flat, Nomura says, and it sees no increase in technically driven downside trades. \"However, if we look at the relative performance of cyclicals over defensives in cash equity markets, we find that the pick-up in the performance of cyclicals has been weak in Asia, and what this suggests to us that that the market thinks the US economy will recover more quickly than the economies of Asia.\"</p><p><strong>LONG-WEEKEND NOTICE: It is worth noting that there are long-weekends for US and UK players, and accordingly liquidity conditions may tail off in the latter part of the day, and on Monday. Due to the upcoming UK bank holiday and US Memorial Day holiday on Monday 25th May, the desk will be running a reduced service alongside the subsequent market closures. On Sunday May 24th the Asia-Pacific service will open at its regular time of 2200BST/1600CDT with the European service also opening at its regular time of 0630BST/0030CDT on Monday 25th May given that European markets will be open for trade. The European service will run to 1800BST, upon which the desk will close. Note, there will be no US service thereafter for that session due to US market closures. The service will then re-open later that evening on May 25th at 2200BST for the beginning of the Asia-Pacific session with full coverage to resume thereafter on Tuesday May 26th. In terms of market opening hours: In the UK, all UK products are closed; in Europe there is regular trading; in the US, Friday 22nd May 2020 floor trade early close at 1200CDT/1800BST, and on Monday 25th May 2020 it is closed.

        "subject": "PRIMER: ECB April Minutes due to be released Friday 22nd May at 1230BST/0630CDT ",
        "content": "<p>The latest policy announcement from the ECB saw policymakers opt to stand pat on rates once again with the general train of thought at the Bank being that delving deeper into negative territory at this stage would provide little in the way of stimulus for the Eurozone. Instead, the Governing Council opted to sweeten the terms of the existing TLTROIII operations and launch a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) with the view of supporting liquidity conditions in the euro area. Those hoping for an expansion of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) were left somewhat disappointed with the current envelope left at a size of EUR 750bln, whilst the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue to run at a monthly pace of EUR 20bln. That said, the Governing Council was explicit in informing market participants that it “is fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed”; any further clarity on this front will be of interest to participants. At the accompanying press conference, Lagarde provided a relatively cautious introductory statement, as expected, whilst stopping short of specific forecasts on the macro outlook; staff economic projections are not due until the June meeting; analysts will be eyeing the account for any further qualitative comments by policymakers on the Eurozone’s growth outlook. Lagarde took every opportunity to remind those watching that the Governing Council will be there to help support the Eurozone economy, however policy will need to be carried out in a coordinated manner with fiscal authorities. Heading into the announcement some desks had speculated about the possibility of yield curve control (YCC), on which, Lagarde stated, the combination of tools the ECB is currently using enables it to operate across the entire curve; but noted the ECB will use all the flexibility that it has. Elsewhere, despite some slightly incoherent responses during the Q&amp;A segment (in a bid to avoid any faux paus such as that seen in March), the press conference wasn’t too much of a game-changer for the narrative surrounding the Bank’s current course of action.</p>",

Market contacts also flag up technical resistance nearby between 173.42-48 ahead of 173.60, but Bunds look set to bide some time pending Friday’s EU cash bourse opens to see whether more safe-haven premium is warranted or debt and equities diverge again. Ahead, ECB minutes and a speech from chief economist Lane are scheduled and could provide a distraction amidst the ongoing COVID-19 vigil with detrimental repercussions on the US-China relationship front.</p>",

In addition, Vice Chair Clarida noted that actions so far are buying some time for the US economy and seemed to be advocating for Yield Curve Control which he suggested is a natural complement to calendar based forward guidance, while Fed’s Williams and Bostic both added to the recent rhetoric against negative rates. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was subdued after the recent slip from resistance at 1.1000 and with participants looking ahead to the ECB Minutes later today, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> remained choppy following the weakest GfK Consumer Confidence reading in over a decade. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were underwhelmed by the BoJ’s widely anticipated announcement and due to the subdued risk tone which kept antipodeans in the lurch, with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> also hampered by the sovereign outlook cut by Fitch.</p><p>Fitch revised Australia’s Outlook from Stable to Negative, affirmed rating at AAA.

The T-note had seen some modest weakness heading into the US session as equity futures came off their lows, although soon strengthened again as US-China tensions hit risk appetite amid China moving ahead with its plans for a new Hong Kong security bill. Later in the afternoon, Fed Chair Clarida noted that some form of YCC, alongside forward guidance, was worth looking into (echoing the minutes), although the market reaction was muted. On the issuance front, the Treasury 10-year TIPS auction saw weak demand, tailing by 4bps, an indication of market participants not being concerned of inflation rising. On the corporate front, AT&amp;T launched the fourth largest IG offering of the year, raising USD 12bln across five tranches (7s, 11s, 21s, 31s, 40s). T-note (M0) futures settled 0.5 ticks lower at 139-02.</p><p><strong>Fed Chair Powell (Neutral)</strong> said downturn has been sudden and severe and suggested they will not rest until the economy is on road to recovery, although he expects that to be soon. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Clarida (Voter, Neutral)</strong> said actions so far are buying some time for the US economy through looser financial conditions and that the Fed will do more if necessary. Clarida also said they do not intend to return to Standard Economic Projections (SEP) at the June meeting but added the committee may return at some point to the discussion around the pace and composition of asset purchases. Furthermore, Clarida suggested that Yield Curve Control is a natural complement to calendar based forward guidance, while he added that other central banks are deploying YCC and it makes sense to be briefed on how it is working. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Bostic (Non-Voter, Dove)</strong> said he is not a fan of negative rates and there is still relief money available, while he added banks should be preserving as much capital as possible. (Newswires)</p><p>NEC Director Kudlow said the Fed has done a good job and agrees with Powell that we do not need negative rates, while he noted liquidity is more important. (Newswires)</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian indices weakened as markets digested today's key events including the BoJ off-schedule meeting and start of China's NPC where it omitted a GDP growth target for this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as uncertainties surrounding economy and trade. ASX 200 (-0.8%) declined with energy names pressured by an aggressive pullback in oil prices and with sentiment subdued after Fitch revised its outlook on Australia’s sovereign rating to negative from stable, while Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) suffered the ill-effects of a firmer currency despite the BoJ’s announcement of a new measure to boost lending to small and mid-sized businesses impacted by the coronavirus in which it set aside JPY 75tln for its new loan programme but which was widely anticipated. Hang Seng (-4.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%) were lower amid the start of China’s Two Sessions conclave where the Government Work Report refrained from setting an economic growth target but pledged to reduce tax and fee burdens for companies by CNY 2.5tln this year and use several tools to keep liquidity ample. Furthermore, the losses in Hong Kong were exacerbated after China’s attempts to tighten its grip on the Special Administrative Region through a new national security law, and is likely to stoke further unrest for the region which had already been mired by months of protests since the middle of last year. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively uninspired with only mild upside seen despite the downbeat risk tone and upside in T-notes, while the conclusion of the BoJ’s emergency meeting and announcement of a new lending scheme also failed to spur any meaningful price action.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are weaker as markets digest today's key events including the BoJ off-schedule meeting and start of China's NPC where it omitted a GDP growth target for this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as uncertainties surrounding economy and trade. ASX 200 (-0.4%) is marginally lower with energy names pressured by a pullback in oil prices and with sentiment subdued after Fitch revised its outlook on Australia’s sovereign rating to negative from stable, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) suffers the ill-effects of a firmer currency despite the BoJ’s announcement of a new measure to boost lending to small and mid-sized businesses impacted by the coronavirus in which it set aside JPY 75tln for its new loan programme but which was widely anticipated. Hang Seng (-3.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) are lower amid the start of China’s Two Sessions conclave where the Government Work Report refrained from setting an economic growth target but pledged to reduce tax and fee burdens for companies by CNY 2.5tln this year and use several tools to keep liquidity ample. Furthermore, the losses in Hong Kong are exacerbated after China’s attempts to tighten its grip on the Special Administrative Region through a new national security law which officially bans all activities aimed at toppling the central government and foreign influence on Hong Kong affairs, which is expected to stoke further unrest in Hong Kong which has already been mired by months of protests since the middle of last year.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is marginally higher and back above the 99.50 level as the negative risk tone spurs safe haven flows, while the plethora of Fed commentary also continues in which Fed Chair Powell suggested they will not rest until the economy is on the road to recovery but expects that to be soon. In addition, Vice Chair Clarida noted that actions so far are buying some time for the US economy and seemed to be advocating for Yield Curve Control which he suggested is a natural complement to calendar based forward guidance, while Fed’s Williams and Bostic both added to the recent rhetoric against negative rates. EUR/USD is subdued after the recent slip from resistance at 1.1000 and with participants looking ahead to the ECB Minutes later today, while GBP/USD remains choppy following the weakest GfK Consumer Confidence reading in over a decade. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were underwhelmed by the BoJ’s widely anticipated announcement and due to the subdued risk tone which kept antipodeans in the lurch, with AUD/USD also hampered by the sovereign outlook cut by Fitch.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with price action uninspired despite the downbeat risk tone and upside in T-notes, while the conclusion of the BoJ’s emergency meeting and announcement of a new lending scheme also failed to spur bids.</p>",
