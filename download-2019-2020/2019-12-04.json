A mixed set of US data failed to deter the rebound in equity bourses and the sell-off in havens, where US ADP reported a frail 67k jobs added in November, casting shadows for Friday’s NFP, where analysts expect 180k jobs added; meanwhile, the headline miss in ISM non-manufacturing (53.9 vs. exp. 54.5) was supported somewhat by the more progressive subcomponents, putting fears of an equally dismal report as the manufacturing figures at bay. Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Larry Page and Co-Founder Sergey Brin are to step down from the company, with Google CEO, Sundar Pichai to become CEO of Alphabet, also. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) was a top performer in the DJIA as the co reaffirmed its Baby Powder is safe and free from Asbestos following another third-party investigation into the FDA’s report, which found zero trace of Asbestos, although the FDA since said it sticks to its findings. Boeing (BA) traded marginally firmer today, with gains likely capped after United Airlines (UAL) announced an order for 50 Airbus (AIR FP, EADSY) A321XLR jets, which enables the airline to start replacing and retire its existing Boeing (BA) fleet. Mastercard (MA) was firmer after it announced a 21% increase to its dividend and authorised a USD 8bln share repurchase programme. Expedia (EXPE) rallied following a management shakeup which saw its CEO and CFO step down from their roles due to a strategy disagreement between the board and senior management. S&amp;P 500 +0.63% at 3113, NASDAQ-100 +0.51% at 8297, Dow Jones +0.53% at 27650.</p><p>The reversal to a more optimistic outlook on US-China trade saw the TPLEX sell-off on Wednesday, paring back somewhat of Tuesday’s strong bid. The sell-off saw some additional pressure after the release of the non-manufacturing ISMs, where participants weren’t dissuaded by the headline miss (sub-components fared better), with the T-Note continuing to move lower after the release. The curve bear-steepened, but not to the same magnitude as yesterday’s bull-flattening; 2s10s rose by 2bps to approximately 20bps, as the 2-year yield rose by 5.2bps whilst the 7-/10-/30-year yields rose collectively by 7.2bps. T-note (z9) futures settled 18 ticks lower at 129-13.</p>",

A mixed set of US data failed to deter the rebound in equity bourses and the sell-off in havens, where US ADP reported a frail 67k jobs added in November, casting shadows for Friday’s NFP, where analysts expect 180k jobs added; meanwhile, the headline miss in ISM non-manufacturing (53.9 vs. exp. 54.5) was supported somewhat by the more progressive subcomponents, putting fears of an equally dismal report as the manufacturing figures at bay. Out of the US, the BoC left rates unchanged, although took a markedly more optimistic tone on the shape of the Canadian economy, making the CAD an outperformer, slightly underperforming the strong bid in cable, where desks noted a cocktail of short-covering and stop tripping heading closer towards the UK election on December 12th. Crude surged as it took its cues from risk sentiment, in addition to a deeper than expected draw in crude stocks; note that OPEC+ minister began arriving in Vienna ahead of Friday’s official meeting, where there is some disparity of whether cuts will be deepened or simply rolled-over. Thursday’s schedule lacks much potential market risk, although trade headlines still dominate, meanwhile, participants can expect some commentary out of the lower level OPEC+ meetings.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>The latest source reports allege the US and China are moving closer to a trade deal despite recent “heated rhetoric”. After market close yesterday, the US House approved a bill that would sanction Chinese officials for their involvement in the oppression of Uighur Muslims in Xinjang, which resulted in China again summoning the US Ambassador to Beijing for “stern representations”. Moreover, China this morning responded to yesterday’s indications by that the US is prepared to implement 15th December tariffs should a Phase 1 deal not materialise in time by warning China would respond with retaliatory tariffs, while such an outcome would seriously disrupt ongoing negotiations, said sources. Sources added that Beijing and Washington are still wrangling over known sticking points, including the magnitude of tariff rollbacks and Chinese purchases of US agricultural products, echoing comments from Commerce Secretary Ross last night, who added the date of the deal is less important than getting a proper deal. In his second day at the NATO Summit in London, the US President struck a less hawkish tone and reverted back to the usual vague language; discussions with China are going “very well”, and “we will see what happens” etc.</p><p><strong>* BOC REVIEW:</strong> The BOC kept rates unchanged at 1.75%, though the comments within the statement were more hawkish than some had anticipated, with the central bank striking an optimistic tone. The BOC is clearly still cognizant of the risks global trade tensions present to the Canadian economy, though the central bank's updated statement did note that there was \"nascent evidence that the global economy is stabilizing.\" It also reiterated that future monetary policy decisions would be guided by the adverse impact of trade conflicts against the sources of resilience within the Canadian economy; it added that its October projection for global economic growth appears to be intact, still expected to edge higher over the next few year. On the consumer and housing sectors, which are key to the Bank's assessment of the outlook, the BOC was upbeat, stating that Q3 consumer spending expanded moderately, housing investment also a source of strength supported via both population growth and low mortgage rules. On inflation, the BOC notes CPI remains at target, and is consistent with the economy operating near capacity; the BOC expects inflation to temporarily rise in the months' ahead. On growth, the BOC intimated that underlying details of the Q3 GDP report were more positive than the headline alone suggested, and it also noted the stronger than expected rise in business investment. \"Labour markets have been very strong, inflation has been locked right around the 2% target, and wage growth has strengthened into the end of the year,\" Canadian bank RBC said, \"while growth headwinds remain, the bank is balancing these risks against those associated with re-inflating household credit growth (largely via recovery in housing markets) from levels that the BoC has argued are already worryingly high.\" RBC also argues that the global growth backdrop remains highly uncertain, and given the limited slack in the economy, there may be more scope for downside than upside growth surprises going forward. \"Still, today's rate statement, and recent economic data flow, has at the very least made a near-term rate cut look less likely.\"</p><p><strong>* US NON-MANUFACTURING ISM: </strong>ISM Non-manufacturing PMI data came in at 53.9, below street expectations for 54.5, and below the prior 54.7 reading. This follows ISM Manufacturing PMI data earlier in the week, which also disappointed, raising some concerns over the US economy ahead of next week’s Fed meeting. “The headline index usually just tracks the rate of growth of core retail sales by a month or so, and should be hovering around the 57 mark” notes Pantheon Macro, explaining that the shortfall, which emerged in early summer, is likely due to the trade war, firstly because of the cost of tariffs on Chinese imports and also because of the uncertainty over trade policy. New Orders rose to 57.1 from 55.6 and the Employment Index rose to 55.5 from 53.7. Prices Paid was also firmer, at 58.5, but Business Activity dropped to 51.6, below expectations for 56.1 and the prior reading of 57, the lowest reading since January 2010. Pantheon caution that the Business Activity component is “much more volatile than the headline”. Regarding the employment component, the consultancy notes that “it is now consistent, if sustained, with payroll growth close to 200K early next year”, although they caveat that other leading indicators that they follow for employment are much weaker than this and so they cannot be sure of the sustainability of this upturn.</p><p><strong>* US ADP: </strong>According to the ADP's measure of payrolls, 67k jobs were added to the US economy in November - short of the 145k consensus, and missing even the most pessimistic forecast (range was between 120-188k); Capital Economics says the data presents downside risks to its 170k forecast, though does note that the official payrolls data will be boosted by an approximately 50k rise in auto sector employment after GM workers returned from strike -- the ADP's data did not include this effect. \"This report adds to signs that the labour market is still losing momentum, suggesting that incomes growth and thus real consumption growth will slow a little further in the near term,\" Capital Economics writes, \"but it would take a much sharper downturn in employment growth to raise recession fears and prompt the Fed into additional rate cuts.\"</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLED USD 2.33 HIGHER AT USD 58.43/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLED USD 2.18 HIGHER AT USD 63.00/BBL: </strong>Crude markets were on the front foot on Wednesday, having been supported overnight by bullish API data, finding further impetus in the morning on reports of the US and China approaching a deal despite “heated rhetoric” and then making further strides after the crude cash open. Moreover, EIA Inventory Data, which saw headline crude stocks post a larger than expected draw of 4.856mln bbls, above the 1.7mln expected. However, the distillate and gasoline subcomponents saw larger than expected builds and capped data related gains. WTI prices rose from overnight lows around the USD 56.40/bbl level to north of USD 58.50/bbl. There was also a stream of OPEC related news throughout the day; Saudi Arabia is reportedly threatening to increase production to its quota level, rather than keeping production at its current lower than required levels, due growing frustration with OPEC member not showing sufficient compliance with the deal, although the news was only good for short-lived negative ticks across the crude complex. Elsewhere; the Venezuelan Oil Minister said that an OPEC rollover is most likely, Energy Journalist Reza Zandi said that Iran will back the proposal for the deepest cuts, as it would like to maximize revenue and the Iraqi Oil Minister said that, in Iraq’s opinion, the present agreement should be extended for the whole of 2020. The Iraqi Oil Minister in response to source reports that a 400k BPD production cut was under discussion, stated this figure was “pulled out of the air”. Although he noted last night that a 400k BPD cut is not final, whilst adding a 1.2mln BPD cut is not enough, adding all members should share the burden. Consensus among OPEC ministers seems to be that a deeper cut will \"be harder to pull off this time\", observed Energy Intel's Bakr, speaking of the upcoming meeting. Tomorrow at 10:00 GMT, the JMMC will meet, followed by OPEC at 14:00 GMT. The Kuwaiti Oil Minister commented that oil prices between USD 60-70/bbl is appropriate for both producers and consumers.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>North Korea said the use of armed forces against the DPRK would be a horrible thing for the US, while the US and NK can turn into an all-out armed conflict at any moment, even by accident. NATO issued a joint statement saying that Russia's aggressive actions constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security and NATO will continue to address Russia's deployment of new intermediate range missiles in a \"measured\" way. Elsewhere, US President Trump and Turkish President Erdogan reportedly had a very productive chat on the side-lines of NATO. Note: Trump has recently threatened tariffs against the country and said that “you cannot be in NATO and buy Russian missiles”, in reference to its latest S-400 missile defence purchase.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED 18 TICKS LOWER AT 129-13:</strong> The reversal to a more optimistic outlook on US-China trade saw the TPLEX sell-off on Wednesday, paring back somewhat of Tuesday’s strong bid. The sell-off saw some additional pressure after the release of the non-manufacturing ISMs, where participants weren’t dissuaded by the headline miss (sub-components fared better), with the T-Note continuing to move lower after the release. The curve bear-steepened, but not to the same magnitude as yesterday’s bull-flattening; 2s10s rose by 2bps to approximately 20bps, as the 2-year yield rose by 5.2bps whilst the 7-/10-/30-year yields rose collectively by 7.2bps.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 +0.63% at 3113, NASDAQ-100 +0.51% at 8297, Dow Jones +0.53% at 27650.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Larry Page and Co-Founder Sergey Brin are to step down from the company, with Google CEO, Sundar Pichai to become CEO of Alphabet, also. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) was a top performer in the DJIA as the co reaffirmed its Baby Powder is safe and free from Asbestos following another third-party investigation into the FDA’s report, which found zero trace of Asbestos, although the FDA since said it sticks to its findings. Boeing (BA) traded marginally firmer today, with gains likely capped after United Airlines (UAL) announced an order for 50 Airbus (AIR FP, EADSY) A321XLR jets, which enables the airline to start replacing and retire its existing Boeing (BA) fleet. Mastercard (MA) was firmer after it announced a 21% increase to its dividend and authorised a USD 8bln share repurchase programme. Expedia (EXPE)&nbsp;rallied following a management shakeup which saw its CEO and CFO step down from their roles due to a strategy disagreement between the board and senior management. Microchip (MCHP)&nbsp;put a boost to the Semiconductor space (SOX) as it narrowed its guidance above the midpoint of analyst expectations. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) caught a bid on receiving FDA breakthrough therapy designation for its Orencia. Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) traded&nbsp;higher after an upgrade to Conviction Buy from Outperform at Raymond James. Instructure (INST)&nbsp;was hit after it agreed to be acquired by ThomaBravo for USD 47.60/share, beneath Tuesday’s closing price of USD 52.96. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU, FCA IM) took a late-session hit on reports it is said to be in talks with Italian authorities due to its auditing where Italy is claiming it undervalued Chrysler by USD 5.6bln in 2014 and could be liable for a USD 1.5bln exit tax. Meanwhile in Europe, Kering (KER FP) is reportedly said to be holding exploratory talks for an acquisition of Moncler (MONC IM), according to sources who add a deal may not necessarily occur; this would mark further consolidation in the luxury retail sector following LVMH (MC FP) acquiring Tiffany (TIF).</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Last night a few earnings from Cloud companies, which appeared strong from headlines however their guidance was rather soft. Salesforce (CRM)&nbsp;traded lower despite a beat on top and bottom lines, although its Q4 guidance was beneath street expectations, however its FY20 view was stronger than expected. Workday (WDAY) traded lower despite EPS and revenue beats as it provided FY21 subscription revenue below expectations. Elsewhere, Campbell Soup (CPB) reported figures which beat top and bottom line estimates, however it cut its FY20 revenue growth forecast, which saw the co trade relatively flat in pre-market, but did trade higher throughout the session.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>USD traded flat heading into&nbsp;the Asia session, where DXY traded in a range of 97.41-97.79. DXY caught a bid on source reports that, despite the recent rhetoric&nbsp;between the US and China, talks are going well. The update saw strength into CNH which saw lows&nbsp;in USDCNH just beneath 7.05 from highs of 7.08. A sell off in havens was also observed, JPY, XAU and CHF were all weaker on the day. The positive reports set the tone for the day which continued to push USDJPY higher throughout&nbsp;the session back towards the 109 handle, where it remains a few pips shy as the US session comes to a close. XAU sold off from&nbsp;1484 to 1472 at the lows, paring some of Tuesday’s rally. GBP performed well yet again with desks noting short covering and stop tripping given the lack of fundamental catalysts, with a slight boost being seen after upward revisions for November Services and Composite PMIs. Cable broke through 1.30 in the morning and continued its rally throughout the day and initially breached 1.31, a level it flirted with throughout the rest of the session. CAD was another strong performer as it benefitted from both a hawkish statement from the BOC and rising oil prices. USDCAD breached 1.3250 to the downside where the Loonie continued its strength throughout the session to breach 1.32 briefly, a level it consolidated around in the tail end of the session. In EMFX, BRL, ZAR and MXN traded firmer against the buck on the broader risk appetite, however, TRY traded weaker despite reports that President Erdogan and Trump held a productive meeting on the sidelines of the NATO summit following Trump’s announcement that the US was considering sanctions on Turkey.</p>",

Moreover, EIA Inventory Data, which saw headline crude stocks post a larger than expected draw of 4.856mln bbls, above the 1.7mln expected. However, the distillate and gasoline subcomponents saw larger than expected builds and capped data related gains. WTI prices rose from overnight lows around the USD 56.40/bbl level to north of USD 58.50/bbl. There was also a stream of OPEC related news throughout the day; Saudi Arabia is reportedly threatening to increase production to its quota level, rather than keeping production at its current lower than required levels, due growing frustration with OPEC member not showing sufficient compliance with the deal, although the news was only good for short-lived negative ticks across the crude complex. Elsewhere; the Venezuelan Oil Minister said that an OPEC rollover is most likely, Energy Journalist Reza Zandi said that Iran will back the proposal for the deepest cuts, as it would like to maximize revenue and the Iraqi Oil Minister said that, in Iraq’s opinion, the present agreement should be extended for the whole of 2020. The Iraqi Oil Minister in response to source reports that a 400k BPD production cut was under discussion, stated this figure was “pulled out of the air”. Although he noted last night that a 400k BPD cut is not final, whilst adding a 1.2mln BPD cut is not enough, adding all members should share the burden. Consensus among OPEC ministers seems to be that a deeper cut will \"be harder to pull off this time\", observed Energy Intel's Bakr, speaking of the upcoming meeting. Tomorrow at 10:00 GMT, the JMMC will meet, followed by OPEC at 14:00 GMT. The Kuwaiti Oil Minister commented that oil prices between USD 60-70/bbl is appropriate for both producers and consumers.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Sterling jubilant, Loonie underpinned and Dollar takes another dive ",
        "content": "<p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>A stellar performance by Sterling on the day heading into the European close, more on the back of short-covering and stop-tripping as opposed to fresh fundamental catalysts, with little reaction to the slight upward revisions for the November Services and Composite PMIs. GBP/USD took out reported barriers at 1.3013 and continued to gain ground above the 1.3000 mark and its 100 WMA (1.3048) before eclipsing the psychological 1.3100 which also coincides with the pair’s 200 WMA. Cable is poised to end the European session at the top of its current (and impressive) 1.2993-3110 intraday range. Meanwhile, EUR/USD moved largely in tandem with the Buck but with gains capped as the EUR/GBP cross fell and remained below 0.8500. EUR/USD is set to end the EU session towards the top of its intraday range having breached 1.1100 to the upside to a high of 1.1107 (vs. low 1.0879).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Another day of losses for the Dollar amid an array of difference factors. DXY initially saw upside on unsourced trade headlines which highlighted progress between US and China despite recent rhetoric. However, gains where short-lived with GBP strength wiping out upside in the USD. Further, ADP data (ahead of Payrolls this Friday) significantly missed expectations with the prior modestly revised lower. Last but not least, ISM non-manufacturing data also printed substantially below forecasts and prompted the DXY’s decline to session lows; which has since crawled off lows but nonetheless heads into the end of the EU session around the 97.50 mark (and below its 200 DMA) having fluctuated within a 97.43-79 intraday range.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD,</strong></p><p>The Antipodeans head into the EU close well-off lows and in modest positive territory, but largely aided by a softer Dollar and the aforementioned trade headlines. The region took a hit overnight and during early EU hours after Aussie GDP QQ growth missed analyst forecasts. Desks mention that the most concerning aspect of the release is the representation of a fifth consecutive quarter which private demand contracted or was flat. Westpac believes that the RBA will be disappointed with the figure and believes that the Central Bank and the Government will have to revise growth expectations. AUD/USD gains further ground above its 21 and 100 DMAs (both residing around 0.6817) and looks to end the European day marginally in the green and towards the top of today’s 0.6813-6854 parameter. The Kiwi outperformed its Aussie counterpart and rose without the weight of downbeat data on its shoulders. NZD/USD heads into the EU close further above 0.6500 ahead of its 200 DMA at 0.6544 – having traded within a 0.6503-39 band. Meanwhile, CAD remains firmer ahead of the EU close in light of the BoC’s hawkish hold coupled with a more upbeat domestic and global economic assessment and with little in the way of a dovish pushback. Further for the Loonie, energy prices rose in excess of USD 2/bbl at time for writing, thus underpinning the oil-rich nation’s currency. USD/CAD is poised to end the session towards the bottom of today’s 1.3219-98 range having taken out its 200 and 21 DMAs (1.3279 and 1.3255 respectively) and briefly dipping below its 100 DMA at 1.3225.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>Both set to end the session relatively flat intraday, having nursed earlier losses which emanated from source reports that US and China are edging closer to a deal despite recent rhetoric – albeit it’s worth nothing that this was not confirmed by any US or Chinese officials. USD/JPY heads towards session-end around the middle of today’s 108.43-79 range with tailwinds from a weaker Buck, and similarly USD/CHF fell back below its 100 DMA (0.9887) having found a base just above 0.9850 and heads into the EU close little changed.</p>",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: BoC Policy announcement due at 1500GMT/1000EST",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>RATES LIKELY UNCHANGED:&nbsp;</strong>At its previous meeting, the BoC said it mulled an ‘insurance’ rate cut, and although it ultimately decided against it on financial stability grounds, though the central bank said it would monitor risks. Money market pricing does not foresee an insurance rate cut this week, pricing in just a 2% chance rates will be lowered from the current 1.75%, with around an 80% probability that rates will be lowered by the end of next year. However, desks are still cognizant of the possibility of an 'insurance' rate cut, given signs the labour market may be cooling, and some GDP growth trackers are running beneath current BOC economic forecasts.</li><li><strong>JOBS DATA:</strong>&nbsp;The BoC has indicated that future policy moves will hinge on the resilience of the Canadian economy, with an emphasis on consumer spending and the housing sector. Canadian bank RBC still judges the labour market as healthy, which it argues will be crucial for both the consumer and housing sectors, and although the headline within the jobs report unexpectedly dropped, the bank notes that there was little sign of deterioration in the report, as the jobless rate remains low, while wage growth continues at a solid clip.</li><li><strong>GDP DATA:</strong>&nbsp;The October/Q3 GDP data was also encouraging; despite the headline missing the street’s view, it still printed in line with the BOC’s forecasts in October, and under the bonnet, the details were also decent, with no overt signs that global trade tensions were severely impacting the Canadian economy; RBC points out that net exports subtracted about half a percent from top-line GDP growth, but despite trade worries, business investment bounced back 9.5% (after a decline of 7.0% in Q2). And while consumer spending growth was lacklustre at 1.6%, residential investment jumped by 13.3%, meaning the consumer sector is still significantly contributing to growth in Q3 vs H1 2019.</li><li><strong>BOCSPEAK:&nbsp;</strong>BoC Deputy Governor Wilkins had suggested (on the 19th&nbsp;November) that there was still policy room to manoeuvre on rates, while the BoC also had other options, such as forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases to help weather any economic storms; however, Wilkins' remarks were counteracted by those from Governor Poloz (on 21st&nbsp;November), who suggested that monetary conditions were about right, given the current situation, and the economy was in a good place – while some desks have framed this as hawkish, it does not seem too different to his October remarks, where he said that “the Canadian economy is demonstrating resilience overall.”</li><li><strong>BOC’S TONE:&nbsp;</strong>Canadian Bank TD Securities argues, therefore, that the Bank is likely to maintain that the outlook is evolving as expected, and the risks around their forecasts will still be roughly balanced; TD is also expecting the BoC to place a heavy emphasis on data dependence. The bank also says that the rate decision is not likely to be as important as the tone of the central bank, and states that anyone looking for a hawkish pivot will be disappointed, as it does not expect much change in either the forward looking language or the BoC’s characterization of the economy. \"Overall, we still expect them to describe the outlook as evolving in line with their forecast from October. Ongoing trade and geopolitical uncertainty will warrant yet another mention as they are central to the Bank's outlook, though we expect they will continue to point to housing activity and fiscal stimulus as sources of support domestically,\" TD writes, \"they are also likely to describe the labour market as a source of strength, despite the pull back in October, and the concluding paragraph will probably be shorter than it was in October, but should hit most of the same beats: the current level of rates will be considered appropriate, but with a heavy emphasis on data dependence.\" Crucially, TD says, it expects the BOC to describe the balance of risk around the forecast as 'roughly balanced'.</li></ul>",

Hang Seng (-1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%)</strong> were dampened by the increased trade pessimism after President Trump’s comments and with Global Times suggesting the US appears to be back-pedalling in trade talks. The US House’s overwhelming support for the Uighur human rights bill demanding sanctions on Chinese officials, which it passed through 407-1 vote, also contributed to the bilateral tensions and spurred resolute opposition from China which will respond depending on how the situation develops. Nonetheless, losses in the mainland have been stemmed after strong Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI numbers added to the country’s recent flurry of strong activity data and as Chinese press op-ed suggested the PBoC are expected to cut RRR in Q1. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher after the recent gains in T-notes due to safe-haven bids, but with prices off their best levels after failing to hold above the 153.00 level and with the lack of BoJ presence in the market contributing to the mild overnight retracement.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Meanwhile, the Eur has been moving at the whim of the Buck and largely shrugged off upward revisions to the pan-European services and composite numbers – with the GDP tracker suggesting growth of 0.1% in Q4 for the EZ.

Elsewhere, the latest batch of comments from the Iraqi oil minister continues to support prices; an additional 400k bpd cut for OPEC+ is apparently in circulation but not final, while the Saudi’s also reportedly prefer deeper cuts, although this contradicts sources reports seen last month. “If all members were compliant with the [current] deal this may be the case, however, with a number of members falling well short in cutting output, including Iraq, other members may be reluctant to cut further” says ING, who goes on to conclude that “reassurance of stronger compliance will likely be needed before other members agree to deeper cuts.” Moreover, yesterday saw the OPEC+ Joint Technical Committee meet in Vienna ahead of the full ministerial meetings on Thursday and Friday and they reportedly did not discuss deeper cuts. Reports did suggest that the Joint Technical Committee is considering Russia’s request to exclude condensate from its oil production cuts, which has been rising as of late in line with the country’s rising gas output and has been cited as the reason for the country’s poor OPEC+ compliance.

Elsewhere, <strong>iron ore prices</strong> found further impetus after data showed that shipments from Brazil had dropped since the last week; prices have been underpinned in recent days by the news that Vale, the world’s largest miner of Iron Ore, cut its production outlook and production at its Brutucu mine has been halted due to safety issues regarding a nearby dam.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Sterling rose to the top of the G10 ranks in early EU hours following a relatively sideways APAC session in which GBP/USD meandered on either side of 1.3000. The pair gained momentum after tripping stops at 1.3013 and advanced to a current intraday high of 1.3063 (ahead of its 200 WMA around 1.3100) before waning off highs and back below its 100 WMA at 1.3048. News-flow has been light for Sterling, with the currency little influenced by a revision higher to its November services and composite PMI metrics. That said, IHS noted that the PMI figures point to a GBP contraction of ~0.1% in the Q4, but the December numbers are yet to be released. Meanwhile, the Eur has been moving at the whim of the Buck and largely shrugged off upward revisions to the pan-European services and composite numbers – with the GDP tracker suggesting growth of 0.1% in Q4 for the EZ. IHS did warn that the services sectors are poised for its weakest QQ expansion for fives years, “hinting strongly that the slowdown continues to spread”. EUR/USD moved into negative territory and back below its 100 DMA (1.1069) after hitting an intraday peak 1.1088, with little EU-specific data/speakers left on the docket.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY, JPY</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and Index has recouped earlier losses with upside coinciding with constructive trade headlines from sources, prompting the DXY to rebound off its 200 DMA at 97.63 back to yesterday’s closing levels around 97.75. Meanwhile, USD/JPY ekes mild losses amid the aforementioned headlines with the pair back above the 108.50 mark (coincides with its 50 DMA), to a high of 108.80 ahead of the rough figure. Traders will be eyeing any trade/geopolitical headlines with NATO summit day 2 underway and US President Trump’s presser scheduled for 15:30GMT.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>Both lower on the day, but more-so the Aussie on the back of disappointing GDP figures with the QQ metric showing growth of only 0.4%, down from the prior of 0.5%. Analysts mention that the most concerning aspect of the release is the representation of a fifth consecutive quarter which private demand contracted or was flat. Westpac notes that the RBA will be disappointed with the figure and believes that the Central Bank and the Government will have to revisit their growth forecasts. AUD/USD climbed off lows in wake of optimistic US-China trade headlines, but gains remain capped due to the overnight data. The pair remains in the red around the middle of its 0.6813-0.6846 band having briefly dipped below its 100 DMA at 0.6816. The Kiwi piggybacks on the Aussie’s losses and hovers just above the 0.65 mark, off highs of 0.6530.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Market narrative, once again, remains focused on the ongoing US-China trade saga; most recent updates are significantly more positive via source reports intimating that the two sides are, in-spite of the heated rhetoric, moving closer to a deal. Note, US President Trump is due to give a press conference at around 15:30 GMT today on NATO. As a result of this, the debt complex is subdued across the board at present with Bunds modestly beneath their opening value and below the 173.0 handle; technicians note that, aside from psychological figures, there is very little in the way of resistance through the 172.0 handle. Trade aside, this morning has also seen the release of final EZ PMIs which showed the German and EZ metrics revised slightly higher; however, data this morning has been overshadowed by the aforementioned trade news flow. Turning to the UK, focus remains on next week’s general election - as such the PMIs were largely overlooked. Earlier in the session (and before the trade headlines) UK debt came under pressure as GBP/USD took out stops around the 1.3013 mark to the upside. Stateside, apart from trade headlines, focus will be on the ISM Non-Manufacturing prints and whether a firm picture can be illustrated for the services sector, also on the docket are comments from Fed’s Quarles. In terms of current performance USTs are similarly subdued in-line with their European counterparts.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets extended on declines as global risk appetite remains sapped by the turbulent trade climate following comments by US President Trump that it is probably better to wait until after the 2020 Presidential Election for a China deal and warned the EU has to shape up or things will get very tough, but later suggested they will be able to work something out on trade. ASX 200 (-1.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) are lower with pressure in the trade-related sectors resulting in Australia’s continued underperformance which was also not helped by a miss in quarterly GDP growth, while the Japanese benchmark tracked the recent slide in USD/JPY and with reports noting the GPIF’s move to end stock lending could rattle markets. Hang Seng (-1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) are dampened by the increased trade pessimism after President Trump’s comments and with Global Times suggesting the US appears to be backpedalling in trade talks. The US House’s overwhelming support for the Uighur human rights bill demanding sanctions on Chinese officials, which it passed through 407-1 vote, also contributes to the bilateral tensions and spurred resolute opposition from China which will respond depending on how the situation develops. However, losses in the mainland have been stemmed after strong Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI numbers adds to the country’s recent flurry of strong activity data.</p><p>In FX market, the DXY remains firmly below the 98.00 level as the US faces trade battles across several fronts and with President Trump also plagued by issues closer to home after the House Intelligence Committee approved the report that found evidence of overwhelming misconduct and obstruction regarding his conduct with Ukraine. The recent weakness in the greenback has benefited its transatlantic peers in which EUR/USD holds onto its spoils after having broken through the 5- to 100-DMA levels and with GBP/USD eyeing the 1.3000 handle. Elsewhere, USD/JPY tests the prior day’s lows near 108.50 amid the broad risk averse tone, while antipodeans have marginally pulled back due to their high beta statuses and weaker PBoC reference rate setting, as well as the miss in Australian quarterly GDP.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher after the recent gains in T-notes due to safe-haven bids, but with prices off their best levels after failing to hold above the 153.00 level and with the lack of BoJ presence in the market contributing to the mild overnight retracement.</p>",

Ross also stated that US has more ammo left against China and President Trump has made it clear that he is under no time pressure to get a deal done, but added there is always a chance of a breakthrough that could impact the Dec 15 tariffs and reiterated the US will eventually get something done on trade with China. Furthermore, Ross later stated that several things are still needed to close a trade deal with China including details on products and quantities to be bought by China. (Newswires)</p><p>US is still going ahead with December 15th China tariffs, although reports noted one caveat is if a Phase One deal gets on paper or something else positive happens President Trump could choose not to impose them according to trade sources. (FBN)</p><p>China Global Times tweeted that US appears to be backpedalling in trade talks and tariff hike threats will have zero effect on China's stance \"because Chinese officials have long prepared for even the worst scenario\", according to an expert close to MOFCOM.
