As such, the narrative focused more on the fundamentals (ISM, ADP, and final PMIs), coming off a more-than-expected market friendly Iowa caucus result. The Emini S&amp;P rose in the European morning, and the consolidated throughout US trade around 10 points away from record high levels. Note: Managed Healthcare (UNH, HUM, CNC, ANTM) was bid - whilst China stimulus and accommodative Fed policy lines the backdrop. Energy (XOP) spiked alongside a relief rally in the oil markets – desks note the crude complex has for the most part likely fully priced in the coronavirus concerns now. SPX +1.13% at 3335, NDX +0.36% at 9367, DJI +1.68% at 29,291.</p><p>With risk sentiment supported following reports of potential virus vaccines, the Treasury curve bear-steepened. Some desks noted that CFTC positioning data alluded to a large build-up of longs, in the latest week, and if the reports about vaccinations prove to be correct, the rates complex could see a sharp reversal following the recent rally. Another observation some analysts have noted is that, while US equities and USDJPY has reversed last week's virus-induced losses, Treasuries are yet to follow suit (as are Brent prices, which are more focussed on the demand loss from China as a result of the outbreak). With that said, some suggest that the moves seen on Tuesday, where US 10-year yields settled 7bps higher, may have been more of a function of China injecting liquidity, rather than any specific positive development on the virus front, after all, as Rabobank explains, the injection of liquidity does not address any of the fundamental concerns about the virus, and so it does not see the backup in yields as the beginning of a rotation out of bonds. Meanwhile, the Treasury’s Quarterly refunding report didn't rock the boat too much; 20-year bond will be issued in H1 2020, participants support initial size between USD 10-13bln. Elsewhere, it left auction sizes unchanged (2s @ USD 40bln, 3s @ USD 38bln, 5s at USD 41bln, 7s @ USD 32bln, 10s @ USD 27bln and re-openings at USD 24bln, 30s @ USD 19bln with re-openings at USD 16bln). And elsewhere, bill supply seen rising modestly over next several weeks, peaking in March, and then declining in April, the Treasury said. US T-note (H0) settled 11 ticks lower at 130-17+.</p>",

Speakers: ECB’s Lagarde, de Guindos; Fed’s Kaplan; RBA’s Lowe; EU trade Commissioner Hogan. Auctions: Japanese 2049 JGBs. Earnings: FCA IM, SAN FP, FP FP, ATVI, BIDU, BMY, CI, EL, K, MSI, PM, TWTR, REGN</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP</strong>: Market sentiment was supported as Europeans entered, with reports of treatments for the Coronavirus in the works – despite WHO saying there had been no known effective therapeutics. As such, the narrative focused more on the fundamentals (ISM, ADP, and final PMIs), coming off a more-than-expected market friendly Iowa caucus result. The Emini S&amp;P rose in the European morning, and the consolidated throughout US trade around 10 points away from record high levels. Note: Managed Healthcare (UNH, HUM, CNC, ANTM) was bid - whilst China stimulus and accommodative Fed policy lines the backdrop. Energy (XOP) spiked alongside a relief rally in the oil markets – desks note the crude complex has for the most part likely fully priced in the coronavirus concerns now. Elsewhere, the Treasury curve bear-steepened, supported by better risk appetite and decent US data. The dollar also firmed, though the Aussie struggled to cling on to overnight gains.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>Multiple reports suggesting that a coronavirus treatment may be near has helped risk sentiment. Chinese media reported that Zhejiang University has found an effective drug treatment; analysts noted that there have been similar reports of late, though each has been followed up by clarifications that the drugs have not been clinically trialled, and it would be months before regulatory approval can be achieved. Meanwhile in the UK, Sky News reported that scientists leading the UK's research into a vaccine claimed a significant breakthrough by reducing a part of the normal development time from \"two to three years to just 14 days\"; the scientist added that it will be in animal models by the beginning of next week, and the next phase will be to move from early animal testing into the first human studies, which could happen in \"months\", with the report adding that the vaccine will be too late for this current outbreak but it will be crucial if there is another one. Citi's analysts have highlighted two key trends: the rate of recoveries are now fast outpacing deaths, and the daily rate of increase in virus cases has started to slow, which it says is contributing traders' easing concerns about any immediate spread (of course, the bank continues to note the unknowns, and indeed, the policy impacts, with upcoming data and central bank decisions over the coming week likely to add colour on that front).</p><p><strong>* ISM NON-MANUFACTURING (JAN): </strong>The headline was a touch above the consensus (55.5 against an expected 55.0), the highest since August 2019; business activity hit a one-year high, and there was improvement in new orders, although the employment sub-index pared. Oxford Economics said non-manufacturing activity is expected to maintain healthy momentum in 2020, although it believes that cooler employment trends, cautious business investment and softer consumer spending momentum will underpin a more modest pace of expansion relative to 2019. \"Coupled with our call for sluggish manufacturing this year, we forecast that the economy will grow at a sub-potential pace of 1.6% in 2020,\" the consultancy adds (note: the Fed projects growth of 2.0% this year).</p><p><strong>* US ADP PAYROLLS (JAN): </strong>The ADP's gauge of payrolls surprised to the upside in January, printing 291k against an expected 156k. Analysts provided the usual caveats about how, although the better-than-expected data will bolster expectations of a beat in the official NFP data on Friday, the accuracy and exact correlation of the two data sets gives reasons to be cautious. Capital Economics explains that this scepticism is doubled every January, because firms tend to purge names from the payroll at the start of the year – even though those people may not have done and paid work for that firm for several months. \"That distortion occasionally used to generate very weak readings at the start of the year but, in this case, it looks like the ADP could have over-compensated with an adjustment,\" CapEco says. Meanwhile, the ADP itself suggested that mild winter weather provided a significant boost to the January employment gain and adds that underlying job growth is close to +125k monthly pace, which is consistent with low and stable unemployment.</p><p><strong>* IOWA: </strong>While the market was closely eying the progress of Bernie Sanders (who some desks have described as a market-unfriendly candidate), it was Pete Buttigieg that emerged the leader from the partial count. Buttigieg's policy stance leans liberal, though he has managed to avoid getting into the detail of his policies. Polls currently suggest that a race between Buttigieg and US President Trump would be close. The market reaction after the IOWA partial results announcement was muted, and was not the sharp risk-off that some feared that a Sanders lead might result in. However, the centrist (and 'market friendly) former VP Biden had a poor showing, raising risks that the Democrat nominee for President will not be a centrist. Nevertheless, some have suggested that the impact of Iowa might be more muted in terms of the impact on national-level polling, with the confusion around the winner and vote count.</p><p><strong>* US TRADE DATA: </strong>The US trade deficit rose to USD 48.9bln in December (from an upwardly-revised USD 43.7bln), as was flagged by the advanced goods data, and was due to falling imports. \"The trade war hit to business capex and, especially, the imposition of tariffs on an array of Chinese consumer goods, on September 1st, are likely to blame for the import collapse,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, \"firms appear to have met demand by running down inventory, but that can’t go on forever, and imports have now begun to mean-revert.\" PM notes that at the same time, exporters are struggling, with non-oil exports ex-aircraft falling at a 7.2% annualized rate in Q4. \"Some of the likely surge in imports in Q1 will be offset by an inventory rebuild but overall we think the joint contribution of net trade and inventories will be negative, in contrast to the +0.4 percentage point contribution in Q4.\"</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Daly (non-voter) said that the economic impact of coronavirus has been limited, and was likely temporary; she does not expect it to have a material impact on the economy, which she sees as growing around 2.0%, though she did note that it was another uncertainty. The policy stance is appropriate, Daly said, and the labour market appears as though it has more room to run. On surging stock prices, Daly suggested it could be a reflection of optimism in 2020, adding that the Fed has taught people that expansions do not die of old age.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The EU is reportedly taking aim at the City of London, with reports suggesting it could re-write regulatory rules post-Brexit, a move aimed at weakening London's dominance as a finance hub. A re-writing of the rules would remove concessions that have been granted to the UK. While Gilts and UK stocks (including the LSE LN, which could lose out to DB1 GY) were stable, sterling saw pronounced downside.</p><p><strong>* CANADA TRADE DATA: </strong>Canada's trade deficit narrowed by more than expected (to CAD 400mln against an expected 610mln, and a prior deficit of 1.2bln, which was revised higher). Capital Economics said the data confirms net trade was a larger drag on the economy in Q4, but the sharp rebound in export volumes implies that monthly GDP growth picked-up at the end of 2019. \"That will provide a decent handover to the first quarter and supports our forecast that quarterly GDP growth will rebound strongly in early 2020.\"</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>After the RBA's less dovish than expected statement on Tuesday, RBA Governor Lowe reiterated an upbeat view of the economy in his 'year ahead' outlook speech, and signalled \"hope\" that rates would remain unchanged in 2020, flagging \"costs\" associated with lower rates that could stoke financial stability concerns. However, despite Lowe focusing on the RBA's 'above potential' growth forecast for 2020, the details of the speech appeared to reveal that the RBA has likely downgraded its 'year-average' 2020 growth forecasts from 2.75% to around 2.25-2.50%, according to Goldman Sachs, which says that the apparent shift in emphasis on the year-ended growth rate suggests the RBA is focused on 'looking through' growth disruptions in early 2020 (which weigh on the year-average rate). The RBA will update its economic projections in Friday's release of the SOMP.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB Chief Economist <strong>Lane</strong> said low rates were helping Germany to get through period of slower growth; he believes future rates will be higher because of easier policy now, and said he sees improvement in inflation in coming years, but not all the way to ECB's target. Looking ahead, Lane said with the recovery, the maximum achievable interest rate could be 2% to 3%, and the new normal for ECB rates will be \"positive but low\". ECB President <strong>Lagarde</strong> says GDP growth last quarter was weak, but in line with ECB expectations; says short-term uncertainties relate to global risk (trade, geopolitics), and that ECB forward guidance on rates and asset purchases acts as an effective automatic stabiliser. ECB's <strong>de Cos</strong> said the central bank should adopt a specific inflation target of 2%, rather than what he describes as its current \"more complicated\" formulation; de Cos says that this would help to clarify that the ECB is concerned with inflation both under and overshooting its target.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.13% at 3335, NDX +0.36% at 9367, DJI +1.68% at 29,291.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Tesla’s (TSLA) formidable rally gave back some of its gains on Wednesday, taking the share price towards USD 700; note, the automaker was also downgraded at Canaccord. Take-Two (TTW) sold-off amid an executive departure. Albemarle (ALB) was down Baird downgraded it to Neutral after a strong YTD move, citing its correlation to Tesla. Managed Healthcare stocks (UNH, HUM, CNC, ANTM) were bid, catching tailwinds from strong Humana earnings, perhaps also to Sanders’ not leading the Iowa Caucus, and perhaps even the lack of any healthcare measures announced by US President Trump at his State of The Union address. Nike (NKE) underperformed as it announced the coronavirus-related store closures would have a material impact. Additionally, there was wider underperformance in growth stocks, particularly software (NOW, INTU, PAYC, FISV, ADBE, DLR).</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Disney (DIS) traded lower, despite a decent earnings report, with above expected Disney+ subscribers. Merck (MRK) was offered after it missed on revenue; the Co also announced it would be spinning off its Women's Health, Trusted Legacy Brands, and Biosimilars into a separate, publicly-traded company. Ford (F) slid lower after a disappointing results and FY20 guidance. Snap (SNAP) was hit amid disappointing Revenue and lacklustre guidance. Microchip (MCHP) buoyed semiconductors after a stellar earnings report and guidance; meanwhile, KLA-Tencor (KLAC) weighed on the group after widening guidance to account for the coronavirus. Gilead (GILD) was hit on a below-expected profit forecast, failing to make gains on reports it is developing a coronavirus treatment (perhaps due to the WHO announcing they had seen no effective treatments). Other stocks that suffered after earnings included Fiserv (FISV), Seagate Technology (STX), Chipotle (CMG), Spotify (SPOT), whilst stocks that caught a bid included Coty (COTY), Capri (CPRI), Unum (UNM), Cerner (CERN), Chubb (CB).</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLES USD 1.14 HIGHER AT USD 50.75; BRENT (J0) SETTLES USD 1.32 HIGHER AT USD 55.28: </strong>The oil benchmarks saw a relief rally on Wednesday, in sympathy with equity markets, amid growing confidence of treatments for the coronavirus. Given that the crude market has failed to join the risk appetite in recent sessions - perhaps partly at fault to OPEC+ “mixed” response to the coronavirus - it appears the oil market has priced in the coronavirus impact for now, although that’s not to say further Chinese demand downgrades could not change that (Russia has reportedly been protesting against deeper cuts, though analysts note that they have seen this dance before; Russia has previously taken a protest position against OPEC cuts, though has fallen into line when deals have been announced). In pre-settlement trade, the crude complex came under pressure, after the Global Times reported that China's oil demand could in Q1 2020 see its first Y/Y decline since 2009 due to coronavirus; could reduce 200k BPD off demand, according to an insider. Additionally, the OPEC JTC has not yet come to a recommendation on supply cuts at the end of its two-day technical meeting, which has now become a three day meeting. Meanwhile, the EIA weekly inventory report supported the bid, where crude printed +3.4mln, a larger than expected build, but smaller than the private inventory data indicated, whilst the products both printed draws too; crude production dipped by 100k BPD to 12.9mln BPD.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (H0) SETTLED 11 TICKS LOWER AT 130-17+: </strong>With risk sentiment supported following reports of potential virus vaccines, the Treasury curve bear-steepened. Some desks noted that CFTC positioning data alluded to a large build-up of longs, in the latest week, and if the reports about vaccinations prove to be correct, the rates complex could see a sharp reversal following the recent rally. Another observation some analysts have noted is that, while US equities and USDJPY has reversed last week's virus-induced losses, Treasuries are yet to follow suit (as are Brent prices, which are more focussed on the demand loss from China as a result of the outbreak). With that said, some suggest that the moves seen on Tuesday, where US 10-year yields settled 7bps higher, may have been more of a function of China injecting liquidity, rather than any specific positive development on the virus front, after all, as Rabobank explains, the injection of liquidity does not address any of the fundamental concerns about the virus, and so it does not see the backup in yields as the beginning of a rotation out of bonds. Meanwhile,<strong> </strong>the Treasury’s Quarterly refunding report didn't rock the boat too much; 20-year bond will be issued in H1 2020, participants support initial size between USD 10-13bln. Elsewhere, it left auction sizes unchanged (2s @ USD 40bln, 3s @ USD 38bln, 5s at USD 41bln, 7s @ USD 32bln, 10s @ USD 27bln and re-openings at USD 24bln, 30s @ USD 19bln with re-openings at USD 16bln). And elsewhere, bill supply seen rising modestly over next several weeks, peaking in March, and then declining in April, the Treasury said.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP</strong>: The USD is firmer amid decent payrolls data from the ADP, raising hopes of a blockbuster NFP reading on Friday; ISM non-manufacturing data also saw a small upside surprise in January, but to a lesser magnitude than its non-manufacturing counterpart. That USD strength contributed to some paring of the <strong>AUD</strong>'s gains, though AUDNZD remains above 1.04 heading into Asia. The <strong>CNY</strong> and <strong>CNH</strong> are both higher against the USD and back beneath 7.00 after optimism about a potential cure for the coronavirus. Despite the better risk sentiment, <strong>XAU</strong> added to gains, while the <strong>ZAR</strong> is flat, having been stronger earlier in the session; the <strong>RUB</strong> is faring better, tracking oil prices higher; <strong>LatAm FX</strong> was also higher, though the <strong>BRL</strong> less so ahead of the BCB rate decision after the market close, where it is expected to fire a 25bps rate cut. The <strong>GBP</strong> traded heavy, with sources suggesting the EU is mulling a regulatory re-write post-Brexit to diminish the role of the City of London; UK equities and Gilts, however, were not as affected by the news. Havens <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong> were negative against the USD, with the yen eying 109, though the Swissy downside was a little more marked, flirting with 0.9750. <strong>CAD</strong> saw some strength after BOC deputy governor Wilkins said Canada must look past monetary policy for growth, though struggled to cling to gains amid USD strength.</p><p><strong>* SGD:</strong> The Singapore central bank unexpectedly released a statement which said there was \"sufficient room within the policy band to accommodate an easing of the SGD Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER) in line with the weakening of economic conditions as a result of 2019-nCoV,\" resulting in USDSGD seeing its largest daily gain since February 2018, and dragged the entire USD/Asia complex.</p>",

Given that the crude market has failed to join the risk appetite in recent sessions - perhaps partly at fault to OPEC+ “mixed” response to the coronavirus - it appears the oil market has priced in the coronavirus impact for now, although that’s not to say further Chinese demand downgrades could not change that (Russia has reportedly been protesting against deeper cuts, though analysts note that they have seen this dance before; Russia has previously taken a protest position against OPEC cuts, though has fallen into line when deals have been announced). In pre-settlement trade, the crude complex came under pressure, after the Global Times reported that China's oil demand could in Q1 2020 see its first Y/Y decline since 2009 due to coronavirus; could reduce 200k BPD off demand, according to an insider. Additionally, the OPEC JTC has not yet come to a recommendation on supply cuts at the end of its two-day technical meeting, which has now become a three day meeting. Meanwhile, the EIA weekly inventory report supported the bid, where crude printed +3.4mln, a larger than expected build, but smaller than the private inventory data indicated, whilst the products both printed draws too; crude production dipped by 100k BPD to 12.9mln BPD.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Buck has been bid for the bulk of the midweek EU session, initially amidst weakness in safe-haven counterparts on reports of breakthroughs in medical efforts to find a vaccine against China’s nCoV outbreak and then via a stonking pre-NFP jobs proxy from the ADP. In short, private payrolls were predicted to print +156k, but almost doubled consensus and far outweighed a minor back month downgrade to put a positive spin on Friday’s BLS report even though the services ISM revealed a slower pace of employment growth and some labour resource difficulties. The Greenback subsequently gleaned more traction as other G10 currency peers succumbed to increased selling pressure, like the Pound, with the index extending gains above 98.000 through a Fib retracement mark and now eyeing another relating to its fall from 2019 high to Q4 low last year at 98.402.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>The Franc has been under fire following more mainly dovish SNB rhetoric via chair Jordan, but also as broad risk sentiment picked up in part due to the aforementioned Chinese news on progress towards finding a cure to the virus. Usd/Chf hit rebound highs close to 0.9750 before waning, while Eur/Chf slipped from around 1.0730 to just shy of 1.0700 at one stage and not really responding to a decent recovery in Swiss consumer sentiment, albeit still negative. On that note, the Euro largely shrugged off mixed Eurozone services PMIs, but gradually pared back from best levels against the Dollar circa 1.1047 to a fraction below 1.1000 as its G10 rival rallied between 97.899-98.322 parameters, thus far. However, the single currency also seemed to suffer in sympathy with Sterling as Cable relinquished 1.3000+ status and Eur/Gbp bounced to a minor new pre-UK services PMI peak in wake of reports implying that the EU has targeted MiFID 2 as a means to penalise UK financial firms post-Brexit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY/NZD</strong></p><p>Also victims of overall Buck strength, as the Loonie failed to derive any traction from a narrower than expected Canadian trade gap given less encouraging internal details, while the Yen was undermined by the general upturn in risk sentiment and Kiwi was undermined by inconclusive NZ jobs data and unfavourable cross-winds. Usd/Cad retested 1.3300 or so lows after almost triggering buy stops said to be sitting at 1.3260 when crude prices were embarking on their recovery and is now looking for independent direction from BoC’s Wilkins, Usd/Jpy extended to 109.84 from 109.31 and Nzd/Usd topped out at 0.6502 and is currently nearer 0.6475.</p><p><strong>AUD/SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The major outperformers, as Aud/Usd remains elevated close to 0.6750 and Aud/Nzd over 1.0400 following further on hold for now guidance from RBA Governor Lowe, while Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok are both nearer their lows than highs in wake of a firm rebound in Sweden’s services PMI rather than disappointing ip data, albeit with a hefty helping hand from the broad risk revival that also boosted oil.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Although the WHO has played down talk of a fix quick for China’s spreading health issue, the Yuan remains well above recent troughs and several regional currencies are trying to maintain positive momentum despite specific bearish factors. However, the Real will be eyeing the upcoming BCB policy verdict and tone of the accompanying statement for near term impetus given expectations for a 25 bp ease that would match the BoT earlier, but was against consensus for no change. Conversely, the NBP stuck to the no move script, while the Zar and Rub remain relatively firm/resilient on Brent’s strength and union proposals for Eskom receiving support from the SA Government.</p>",

Thereafter, prices clambered off worst levels before piggybacking on the virus headlines which, if true, could significantly improve the demand outlook for the complex. Elsewhere, OPEC’s JTC will convene for the second day of discussions later today after the technical committee reportedly did not discuss production cuts yesterday but will revisit the topic, according to delegates who noted it studied between 200-400k BPD impact on oil demand from the coronavirus. Reports also note that OPEC numbers suggest a circa 400k BPD demand impact for around six months from the coronavirus, although these forecasts are highly contingent on how long the epidemic lasts alongside any prolonged effects. Analysts at ING note that a 500k BPD of additional OPEC cuts in Q1 and a rollover of current cuts in Q2 (through to end-June) should be almost enough to balance the oil market, assuming the OPEC figures are correct and factoring in supply disruptions in Libya. Next up, traders will be eyeing the weekly DoEs with headline crude forecast to print a build of 2.831mln barrels, according to Reuters Estimates. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> conformed to the overall risk appetite as prices briefly dipped below 1550/oz before encountering stops just below the figure. <strong>Copper</strong> continues yesterday’s sentiment-led rebound as the red metal almost wipes out a bulk of last week’s losses.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is holding up firm in the face of a marked pick-up in sentiment surrounding China’s coronavirus based on media headlines suggesting that scientists and researchers may be closer to finding a vaccine than previously anticipated. The reports have boosted the <strong>YUAN </strong>for obvious reasons, with Usd/Cnh retreating from around 7.0100 to sub-6.9750 and below the 200 DMA (6.9905) not to mention the PBoC’s 6.9823 overnight Usd/Cny mid-point fix. However, the Greenback is forging gains at the expense of safer havens, like the <strong>YEN, EURO, SWISS FRANC </strong>and <strong>GOLD</strong>, with the <strong>DXY </strong>clinging to 98.000 and on course to keep its head above a key Fib retracement level (98.011), barring any bad miss via ADP, final Markit PMIs and/or the non-manufacturing ISM.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR/XAU</strong></p><p>As noted above, all weaker vs the Buck and overall on a broad unwind of FTQ premium/positioning, as Usd/Jpy climbs further above 109.50, Usd/Chf reclaims 0.9700+ status, Eur/Usd retreats from near 1.1050 to just under 1.1025 and Usd/Xau retests support circa Usd 1550/oz after briefly tripping stops on a break of Tuesday’s low (Usd 1549) to trade a whisker below Usd 1548.</p><p><strong>AUD/GBP/NOK/SEK/NZD/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie has extended post-RBA gains with the aid of commentary from Governor Lowe reinforcing a wait-and-see stance on top of the more encouraging Chinese outbreak news. Aud/Usd has now climbed firmly back above 0.6750 to revisit late January peaks (0.6777), while Aud/Nzd has rebounded over 1.0400 to the detriment of Nzd/Usd that has not been able to regain a sure grip on the 0.6500 handle in wake of somewhat mixed NZ jobs data. Conversely, another handsome UK PMI beat vs consensus has boosted Sterling across board, as Cable hovers close to best levels of the wtd (1.3070) and Eur/Gbp sub-0.8450 following rather contrasting Eurozone services PMIs. Elsewhere, the Scandi Crowns have rebounded alongside risk appetite and the Norwegian Krona especially fuelled by a strong recovery in crude prices whereas its Swedish counterpart is being partially hampered by poor hard data offsetting an upbeat services PMI. Similarly, the Loonie is not deriving that much from the aforementioned bounce in oil ahead of Canadian trade data and a speech from BoC’s Wilkins, albeit with Usd/Cad nearer the base of a 1.3299-62 band.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Most regional currencies have tracked Yuan and high-beta peer appreciation, but the SGD and THB have both been subject to dovish MAS and Thai CB vibes in the form of guidance and an unexpected 25 bp ease respectively, while the Try is still on the defensive due to geopolitical factors. Conversely, SA Government backing for COSATU proposals to cut Eskom debt has given the Zar an extra fillip.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.9%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp.

The State of the Union Address also failed to spur price action with President Trump championing the US economy and employment in an opportunity to make his case for re-election. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> were lacklustre with the latter giving back some of the spoils as it retreated closer towards 1.3000. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses remained elevated due to the risk appetite, while antipodeans were relatively indecisive with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> choppy after comments from RBA Governor Lowe that the board continues to discuss merits of further monetary stimulus but also noted that the economy is still passing through a gentle turning point and that the board is balancing risks of further cuts vs. costs of very low rates.

Lowe also stated that recent inflation and jobs data show things are gradually moving in right direction and that he can see the case for further easing but added there are risks and the benefits currently do not outweigh risks which could change. Furthermore, Lowe commented that rates could come down but is hoping it will not happen and suggested they are getting closer to the crossing point where low rates become a risk.

Jordan also stated they are keeping to negative interest rates and currency interventions if needed although the bank would pose no concerns about removing negative rates if the situation called for it. Furthermore, he added that CHF is highly valued and that the Bank has the room to move rates lower.

Furthermore, the OPEC+ JTC reportedly did not discuss production cuts yesterday but will revisit the topic today and a larger than expected build in headline private inventories added to the bearish factors. Nonetheless, the energy complex has nursed losses overnight and <strong>WTI</strong> reclaimed the USD 50.00/bbl level amid the broad appetite for risk which was also the driver for outperformance in copper, while gold prices benefitted from short-covering and a bounce off support at USD 1550/oz.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks (w/e 31st Jan) +4.18mln (exp. +2.8mln, prev. -4.3mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>OPEC+ JTC reportedly did not discuss production cuts yesterday but will revisit the topic today, according to delegates who noted it studied between 200-400k BPD impact on oil demand from the coronavirus.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>Canadian court dismissed the aboriginal groups challenge to block the Transmountain pipeline construction, allowing the project to go forward although the aboriginal group have 60 days to appeal the decision.

The selling of the T-Note was clear sailing throughout the session as participants cited several factors: coronavirus fears abating with China pledging economic stimulus, preliminary polls for the more moderate Buttigieg surprised higher in the Iowa caucus, fallout from Monday’s strong ISM Manufacturing print in the US and the above consensus Factory Orders print, and position unwinding ahead of the Treasury refunding announcement on Wednesday (exp. USD 38bln 3-years, USD 27bln 10-years and USD 19bln 30-years). This proverbial cocktail of factors saw the most pronounced steepening in the front-to-belly (2s5s +2bps, 2s10s +2bps, 2s30s +1.5bps), helping the 10-year yield rise back above 1.60%, after concerns of it breaking though 1.50%. US T-note (H0) settled 22 ticks lower at 130-28+.</p><p>US President Trump said America's future is bright and the economy is the best it has ever been in the State of the Union Address. President Trump added that there has been more than 7mln jobs created in the US and Unemployment has reached the lowest in 50 years since he has been President, while he added that companies are returning to the US and tariff strategy on China worked.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are positive across the board as the global risk recovery continues into the region which had underpinned the major indices on Wall St and pushed the Nasdaq to a fresh record high. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.6%) are both higher as they take impetus from their peers stateside with tech and commodity-related sectors outperforming in Australia but with gains limited by resistance at the 7000 level and with gold miners suffering as investors shun safe-havens, while gains in Tokyo have been exacerbated by a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.5%) trade with firm gains as the bargain hunting resumes in the mainland, unfazed by softer Caixin Services and Composite PMIs, continued increases in the number of coronavirus cases and the PBoC skipping open market operations in which it noted that current liquidity is ample and can fully meet market demand.</p><p>The DXY is steady at the 98.00 level and was unmoved by the long-delayed and incomplete (62% of precincts) Iowa Caucus results which showed Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders pulling ahead at 26.9% and 25.1% respectively, followed by Warren at 18.3% and Biden in 4th place at 15.6%. The State of the Union Address also failed to spur markets with President Trump boasting on the US economy and employment in an opportunity to make his case for re-election. EUR/USD and GBP/USD are lacklustre with the latter giving back some of the spoils from the firmer than expected Construction PMI data as it retreats towards the 1.3000 level to the downside. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses remain elevated due to the risk appetite, while antipodeans are relatively flat with AUD/USD indecisive after comments from RBA Governor Lowe that the board continues to discuss merits of further monetary stimulus but also noted that the economy is still passing through a gentle turning point and that the board is balancing risks of further cuts vs. costs of very low rates. Elsewhere, SGD lost about a point against the greenback following an update from the MAS which stated that policy stance remains unchanged although there is sufficient room within the policy band for SGD Nominal Effective Exchange Rate easing.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as they extend on this week’s pullback from the 153.00 level and amid spillover selling from USTs which retreated below 131.00 as the gains across stocks sapped safe-haven demand.</p>",
