The Treasury curve seems to be taking influence from EGBs, where yields continue to fall as traders continue to cite the recent dovish ECB chatter, and see IMF’s Lagarde as a dovish continuity candidate for the central bank’s top job. There are also the familiar concerns about global growth and secular stagnation being cited. Crude is higher, despite a lower draw for headline crude stocks than was implied by Tuesday’s API data. Broadcom (AVGO) underperformed whilst Symantec (SYMC) surged on the open after reports that Broadcom was close to acquiring Symantec, though CNBC said terms were yet to be agreed. Tesla (TSLA) gained after reporting stronger than expected Q2 production and delivery figures AMC on Tuesday. Walmart (WMT) opened lower after reports emerged that its US ecommerce operations would impact its FY EPS by over USD 1bln negatively. Merck (MRK) benefitted from a Buy initiation at Mizuho. Meanwhile, Boeing (BA) set aside USD 100mln for victims of the 737 Max crashes. T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) caught a bid in later trade on reports DoJ approval for their merger could come as early as next week. Ford (F) traded higher amid reporting Q2 US vehicle sales, with weaker total sales but strong truck sales.

It was confirmed today that Italy will not face disciplinary procedures by the EU due to its high debt levels, which helped BTPs. EGB’s have also been very well supported by dovish ECB remarks, as well as the prospect of Christine Lagarde heading the central bank after Draghi’s departure. Treasury trade had a thin feel to it, ahead of the July 4th market holiday on Thursday; the curve bull-flattened, with yields falling across the curve, despite strength in equities. US 10-year yields made further ground under 2.00%, with the US curve seeing yields fall to two-and-a-half year lows. There was also some influence from US President Trump’s nomination of Christopher Waller and Judy Shelton to the Fed Board of Governors; both are considered dovish candidates.

The Treasury curve seems to be taking influence from EGBs, where yields continue to fall as traders continue to cite the recent dovish ECB chatter, and see IMF’s Lagarde as a dovish continuity candidate for the central bank’s top job. There are also the familiar concerns about global growth and secular stagnation being cited. Crude is higher, despite a lower draw for headline crude stocks than was implied by Tuesday’s API data.</p><p><strong>* LAGARDE:</strong>&nbsp;Desks continue to size-up the implications of IMF’s Lagarde taking the helm at the central bank, and the general run of opinions is that she’d be a dovish, continuity-candidate to replace Draghi. The IMF’s most recent Article IV on the Euro area warned of a “precarious central forecast” and found that a downgrade of the inflation outlook could require even more accommodation from the central bank. Desks have taken this as a suggestion that Lagarde appears to have already backed lower rates and QE2. “Under her leadership the IMF has generally seemed to take a more 'Anglo-Saxon' as opposed to 'Germanic' view on monetary policy issues, largely in line with previous Fed chairs Bernanke and Yellen, as well as current ECB President Draghi and BoJ Governor Kuroda,” UBS said, “for investors, this means that further asset purchases by the ECB should very much be expected, with Draghi probably raising the issuer limit to 50% in September.” UBS thinks that the picture is less clear on negative rates, but says it may create an additional incentive for Draghi to push through tiering and further rate cut before his terms ends.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong>&nbsp;ECB's Villeroy said the central bank should watch various measures of inflation, which are not always coherent; and he also said that the ECB was in no way out of ammunition, and monetary policy will continue to remain supportive.</p><p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Nikkei reported that various tech companies are looking to move production out of China, including PC makers such as HP (HPE), Microsoft (MSFT), and Dell (DELL), as well as game console and smart speaker producers such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Sony (SNE), Nintendo, and Microsoft.</p><p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>Crude prices were on a rally through European trade and into the US session, before data showed crude inventories drew down by less than was implied by Tuesday’s API data. EIA reported US crude inventories drawing 1mln bbls, less than expected and well below the API reported 5mln bbl draw; gasoline stocks also drew less than expected at 1.6mln bbls and distillates reported a surprise build of 1.4mln bbls; Cushing stocks built by 0.7mln bbls. Production was also reported to have risen by 100k to 12.2mln BPD. Analysts noted that the gains earlier on were most likely due to some consolidation from the heavy losses on Tuesday as the market digests the OPEC+ meeting outcome. Later trade did see prices move modestly higher, where analysts noted that crude + products still showed a net draw. In regard to the OPEC+ deal, Citigroup’s analysts said “the more supportive take, which we’d favour, is that the ongoing limits will contribute to a 3Q supply/demand deficit that may be on the order of 0.8mln BPD, drawing down inventories and supporting an eventual cycle of buying.”</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong> Iranian President Rouhani said that Iran will increase uranium enrichment beyond the 3.67% level after July 7th and uranium will be enriched to whatever levels are necessary, adding that if the remaining signatories of the nuclear deal do not fulfil their promises, the Arak nuclear reactor will return to prior activities. Rouhani clarified that if the other signatories return to their commitments Iran will reduce its enriched uranium beneath the prior cap of 300kg.</p><p><strong>* US ADP PAYROLLS:</strong>&nbsp;The headline missed expectations again, printing 102k in June against the Street’s view for 140k. Pantheon Macroeconomics explains that the ADP figure is generated by a model which incorporates data from firms which use ADP’s payroll processing services but also includes the previous month’s official measure, because payrolls tend to mean-revert. The consultancy says that May’s modest 90K increase in private payrolls, therefore, constrained the June ADP measure., and notes that the official numbers, however, are based only on survey data for the reference month, so Friday’s nonfarm payrolls data should be stronger than ADP suggests. “The bigger picture here is that payroll growth had to slow this year because the economy is no longer being boosted by last year’s tax cuts,” Pantheon writes, “more recently, however, payroll growth has been unusually sluggish as a result of the hit to business confidence from the drop in stock prices in Q4. But the key private sector survey measures of hiring, notably the ISM surveys and the NFIB survey, have substantially recovered.” Pantheon looks for job gains of 175K per month in Q3, and sees the June figure (released Friday) around +160K.</p><p><strong>* US NON-MANUFACTURING ISM:</strong>&nbsp;The headline fell by more than the consensus had expected, to 55.1. The composition of the report was soft, as the business activity, new orders, and employment components all pulled back, but still remain above 50.0. The drop in the ISM non-manufacturing index in June underlines that the economic slowdown underway goes well beyond tariff uncertainty, Capital Economics says. “A weighted average of the two ISM surveys is now consistent with economic growth slowing to just 1.0% annualised; we don’t expect growth to be quite that weak in the second quarter but, with momentum clearly fading, it won’t be long before the Fed begins cutting interest rates,” the consultancy said.</p><p><strong>* US TRADE BALANCE:</strong>&nbsp;The trade deficit widened by more than expected in April, to USD 55.5bln from USD 51.2bln, making it the largest monthly deficit seen this year. “The data point to modest downside risk to our Q2 real GDP growth forecast of 2%,” Oxford Economics says, “encouragingly, exports and imports both rebounded from the prior month’s drop and annual momentum firmed to -1.4% Y/Y and 3.6% Y/Y, respectively; in real terms.” But Oxford Economics says that trade flows remain moribund due to the dampening effects of protectionism, dissipating fiscal stimulus, and softer global growth. It also says that a stronger dollar and domestic capacity constraints, however, will keep imports growing faster than exports, further widening the deficit in 2019.</p><p><strong>* US FACTORY ORDERS:</strong>&nbsp;Fell by more than expected (-0.7% vs expected -0.5%).</p><p><strong>* TREASURIES:</strong> The European fixed income environment was influential; EGB yields were lower, with Italian BTPs particularly standing out, as the 10-year rate differential vs Bunds declined to around 200bps, as Italian 10-year yields dropped by over 20bps. It was confirmed today that Italy will not face disciplinary procedures by the EU due to its high debt levels, which helped BTPs. EGB’s have also been very well supported by dovish ECB remarks, as well as the prospect of Christine Lagarde heading the central bank after Draghi’s departure. Treasury trade had a thin feel to it, ahead of the July 4th market holiday on Thursday; the curve bull-flattened, with yields falling across the curve, despite strength in equities.

There was also some influence from US President Trump’s nomination of Christopher Waller and Judy Shelton to the Fed Board of Governors; both are considered dovish candidates.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed’s Mester (non-voter, hawk) spoke again on Wednesday, giving similar comments to those she gave on Tuesday, expressing her patient and data dependent stance as why she is not currently in favour of a rate cut, whilst acknowledging the global growth uncertainties. Mester said a deterioration of the US consumer sector would gain her attention.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.8% AT 2996, NASDAQ-100 0.7% AT 7858, DOW JONES 0.7% AT 26963.

Ford (F) traded higher amid reporting Q2 US vehicle sales, with weaker total sales but strong truck sales.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong>&nbsp;trades slightly firmer ahead of Thursday’s Independence Day holiday.&nbsp;<strong>EUR</strong>&nbsp;trades flat/slightly negative ahead of the US Independence Day holiday. Heavy option expiries kept EUR near the 1.13 figure, and there was a gradual drift lower after the NY cut, with traders attributing the downside to dovish ECB expectations.&nbsp;<strong>JPY</strong>:&nbsp;The BOJ adjusted its Rinban operation, trimming purchases at the mid- and long-end of the JGB curve and increasing purchases at the short-end, which analysts say is designed to steepen the JGB curve, and help support bank profitability. The result was narrowing yield differentials, helping to support the JPY against the USD.&nbsp;<strong>GBP</strong>:&nbsp;The probability of a BOE rate cut has risen again, amid another slate of weak data out of the UK, and accordingly, GBP is lower, sub-1.26 with next support seen around the psychological 1.2550 and 1.25 marks.&nbsp;<strong>AUD</strong>:&nbsp;Aussie shorts continued to cover after the RBA cut rates on Tuesday, while the ‘favourable’ G20 outcome was also being cited for AUD strength (given Australia’s trade relationship with China), and the currency sits above 0.70 heading into retail sales data, due overnight.&nbsp;<strong>SEK</strong>:&nbsp;Driven by a slightly weaker EUR, and a hawkish Riksbank, which kept rates and the rate trajectory unchanged, though hinted that the path could be revised lower later in the year. Nordea suggested the decision was hawkish given that CPIF forecast was lowered, but the rate path was not. The bank also notes that the dovish Fed and ECB stance has had less of an impact on the Riksbank so far.&nbsp;<strong>BRL:</strong> There has been renewed optimism on Pension Reform, after the pension committee was to meet with coordinators to outline a voting schedule. There is a suggestion that if parties agree, a vote could come very soon, which desks say would offer support to the BRL, especially given recent reports that there are the votes to drive through reform. However, a government official later said the Pension Committee report would likely not be ready today.</p>",

The result was narrowing yield differentials, helping to support the JPY against the USD. <strong>GBP: </strong>The probability of a BOE rate cut has risen again, amid another slate of weak data out of the UK, and accordingly, GBP is lower, sub-1.26 with next support seen around the psychological 1.2550 and 1.25 marks. <strong>AUD: </strong>Aussie shorts continued to cover after the RBA cut rates on Tuesday, while the ‘favourable’ G20 outcome was also being cited for AUD strength (given Australia’s trade relationship with China), and the currency sits above 0.70 heading into retail sales data, due overnight. <strong>SEK: </strong>Driven by a slightly weaker EUR, and a hawkish Riksbank, which kept rates and the rate trajectory unchanged, though hinted that the path could be revised lower later in the year. Nordea suggested the decision was hawkish given that CPIF forecast was lowered, but the rate path was not. The bank also notes that the dovish Fed and ECB stance has had less of an impact on the Riksbank so far. <strong>BRL:</strong> There has been renewed optimism on Pension Reform, after the pension committee was to meet with coordinators to outline a voting schedule. There is a suggestion that if parties agree, a vote could come very soon, which desks say would offer support to the BRL, especially given recent reports that there are the votes to drive through reform. However, a government official later said the Pension Committee report would likely not be ready today.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars have both overcome overnight dips on the back of sub-forecast Chinese Caixin services and composite PMIs following reports that Beijing is considering purchasing a reduced amount of US agricultural products in acknowledgement of the agreement to resume trade talks. Aud/Usd has reclaimed 0.7000+ status, but remains capped below the pre-RBA high, while Nzd/Usd has not quite managed to revisit 0.6700 as the Aud/Nzd cross holds firmly above 1.0450. However, the Aussie may yet be hampered by decent expiry options sitting between 0.6985-0.7000 (1 bn) into the NY cut.</p><p><strong>JPY/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Yen and Swedish Crown are vying for position as the next best major, as Usd/Jpy consolidates within a 107.92-54 range after the latest safe-haven move through 108.00 and the headline pair now looks likely to remain contained by hefty expiry interest spanning 107.00-10 (3 bn) through 107.65-80 (1 bn) to 108.00 (2.2 bn). Meanwhile, Eur/Sek has pared some losses after a test of Fib support under 10.5000 in wake of the Riksbank policy meeting that stuck rigidly to previous (April) guidance in terms of the rate path and likely timing of the next hike, as growth and inflation assessments were deemed to be unchanged in the interim period.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Mostly better than expected Eurozone PMIs and an almost glowing review of Italy’s 2019 and 2020 finances, according to EU officials citing Government analysis have propped up the single currency to an extent, with Eur/Usd trading in a tight 1.1294-69 band. Moreover, option expiries appear influential given as much as 4.7 bn running off from 1.1290 to 1.1300 vs strong technical support in the form of the 100 DMA at 1.1260.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound remains rooted to the base of the G10 ranks and another dismal UK PMI has rattled Sterling sentiment, as the services sector only just escaped contraction and the composite fell through 50 to signal negative Q2 GDP, albeit very marginal. Cable held above 1.2550, but partly due to a lethargic Dollar as the <strong>DXY </strong>continues to straddle the 200 DMA in a confined 96.873-662 range, while Eur/Gbp edged back up towards 0.9000 and recent highs only a few pips shy of the round number.</p><p><strong>TRY</strong></p><p>The Lira has maintained its recovery momentum in wake of broadly in line and softer Turkish CPI data that offset subsequent news that tax on retail FX transactions could be doubled to 0.2% and President Erdogan may be given the green light to hike levies further. Usd/Try currently around the middle of 5.6645-6090 bounds.</p>",

Indeed, the 2-5 year spread has actually inverted, while 10 year cash has now fallen further below the BoE bank rate, as the future tests resistance around new contract highs within a 131.97-84 range vs yesterday’s 131.57 close. Note, Bunds recently inched a tad closer 174.00 when setting a marginal intraday and ATH Eurex peak for the Sep19 future at 173.88, but have eased back a tad amidst largely firmer than forecast Eurozone services PMIs, and on that note the UK survey is out before a trio of BoE MPC members are scheduled to speak.</p>",

This could come via a pull-back in equities and/or relative weakness in the upcoming Eurozone services PMIs, although in truth the impetus seems compelling in itself and the pause may just be a bout of consolidation. Also ahead, Eur4 bn Bobl issuance, ECB’s de Galhau and a packed US agenda, partly due to tomorrow’s US Independence Day holiday.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> was steady with only a minimal pullback seen from its post-G20 highs as it bides its time heading into the shortened trading day on Wall St. later and tomorrow’s Independence Day holiday, as well as the latest NFP jobs data near the end of the week. As such, <strong>EUR/USD</strong> and <strong>GBP/USD</strong> remained subdued beneath the 1.1300 and 1.2600 handles respectively with the latter dampened from recent comments by BoE Governor Carney who expects considerably weaker growth for Q2, while it was also reported that UK PM candidate Jeremy Hunt admitted a no-deal Brexit could cause as much damage as the 2008 financial crisis but still vowed to crash out of Europe if necessary. Elsewhere, the mostly risk-averse tone spurred flows into safe haven <strong>JPY</strong> and dragged <strong>USD/JPY</strong> towards the 107.50 level to the downside, while antipodeans were stable in which <strong>AUD/USD</strong> proceeded sideways as the disappointing Chinese PMI releases were counterbalanced by a record trade surplus and better than expected building approvals data.</p><p>Australian Trade Balance (AUD)(May) 5745.0M vs. Exp. 5250.0M (Prev. 4871.0M); record high.

This was the worst performance in oil since May 31st which analysts attributed as a “sell the fact” scenario following the widely anticipated extension agreement and prompted OPEC Secretary General Barkindo to label the price slump as an anomaly, while a larger than expected API draw also failed to provide any meaningful support. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were firmer on safe-haven demand and on a continued breakthrough from the USD 1400/oz level but stopped shy of its 6-year highs, while <strong>copper</strong> languished amid the risk averse tone and underperformance in its largest buyer China.</p><p><strong>API Weekly Crude Inventories -5.0mln vs. Exp. -3.0mln (Prev. -7.6mln).

Once again, the T-Note took cues from EGBs, which have seen yields fall to fresh lows, with traders chewing the fat over the weak economic backdrop, and the dovish comments from a noted hawk (ECB's Knot) on Monday. In afternoon trade, IMF’s Lagarde emerged as the front-runner for the ECB top job, which added a bid in the fixed income space, as the candidate is viewed as less hawkish than other names that were in the frame. A bout of risk-off in the afternoon also sent the T-Note to HOD, after geopolitical tensions (around the same time, it was announced that US VP Pence had cancelled an appearance, the Russian President met his defence minister, while there were also reports that the EU Security Committee was meeting, leading to speculation that we could be on the cusp of some sort of geopolitical escalation; however, a White House official deflated the panic, stating that there was no national security angle). The T-Note remained near highs at settlement. US T-note (U9) futures settled 14+ higher at 128-04+.</p><p>US President Trump says he intends to nominate Executive VP and Director of Research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Christopher Waller and US Executive Director at the European Bank for Reconstruction and&nbsp;Development Judy Shelton to the Fed board.

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) were mixed with Australia led higher by gold miners as the precious metal resumed its advances but with upside capped by financials amid concerns of tighter margins due to the lower rate environment and as energy names suffered the brunt of a near-5% drop in crude, while sentiment in Tokyo caved in from the weight of a firmer currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) were downbeat with underperformance in the mainland after another PBoC liquidity drain and disappointing Chinese data in which Caixin Services PMI missed estimates to print a 4-month low and Composite PMI deteriorated to its weakest since October 2016. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked the gains in T-notes which saw the US 10yr Treasury yield drop to its lowest since 2016, with demand also underpinned by the downbeat risk sentiment and BoJ presence in the market.</p>",

As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD are subdued beneath the 1.1300 and 1.2600 handles respectively with the latter dampened from recent comments by BoE Governor Carney who expects considerably weaker growth for Q2, while it was also reported that UK PM candidate Jeremy Hunt admitted a no-deal Brexit could cause as much damage as the 2008 financial crisis but still vowed to crash out of Europe if necessary. Elsewhere, the mostly risk averse tone has spurred flows into safe haven JPY with USD/JPY now eyeing the 107.50 level to the downside, while antipodeans are steady with AUD/USD sideways as the disappointing Chinese PMI releases are counterbalanced by higher than expected trade surplus and building approvals data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track the gains in T-notes which saw the US 10yr Treasury yield drop to its lowest since 2016, with demand for bonds underpinned by the downbeat risk sentiment and BoJ presence in the market.</p>",
