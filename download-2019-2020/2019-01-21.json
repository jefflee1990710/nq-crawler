(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May said the right way to rule out a no deal is for the house to approve a deal and that the EU is unlikely to extend Article 50 without UK having a plan, while she is to hold further Brexit meetings this week and acknowledged their approach has changed since the first vote. Furthermore, UK PM May said a 2nd referendum could strengthen the hands of nationalists and doesn&#39;t believe there is a majority for one, while she added the UK will not reopen the Belfast agreement and that she is exploring the nature of any movement on the backstop that would secure the support of Parliament. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conservative Party lawmaker Rudd warned PM May she could face dozens of ministerial resignations next week if Tory MPs are banned from voting for a plan that helps stop a no-deal Brexit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Chief Negotiator Barnier said the Withdrawal Agreement including the Irish backstop, is &ldquo;the best deal possible&rdquo; for the UK in the Brexit negotiations, while he also dismissed reports of a bilateral arrangement between the UK and Ireland. (RTE)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poland&#39;s Foreign Minister suggested the Irish backstop should be limited to five years, although Irish Deputy PM Coveney stated that the Withdrawal Agreement is not up for renegotiation and dismissed the call by the Polish Foreign Minister for a five-year limit on the backstop as not reflecting the EU position. (Newswires/RTE)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cross-Channel freight trade &#39;could drop by 87%&#39; under &#39;no-deal&#39; Brexit according to reports which cited documents from the Border Force showing freight trade may operate at as little as 13% of its current capacity for 6 months.

The PM defended her position once again and acknowledged that the government&rsquo;s approach has changed since the first vote. She warned that the only two ways to rule out a no deal scenario are to either extend Article 50, which would betray the results of the referendum as it would mean revoking the decision of the UK leaving the EU, or return to Brussels and renegotiate a deal which ensures an ordinarily exit from the block. She also appeared sceptical over the existence in Parliament of majority for a second referendum and warned that this option could strengthen the hands of nationalists. May made clear that the government will not reopen the Good Friday Agreement and she will seek input from Parliament and voices outside the government on the next phase of negotiations. During her initial statement, she scrapped the GBP 65 application fee for EU citizens to register in Britain. Looking ahead, a number of amendments are expected to be tabled between now and next Tuesday 29 January which will be selected by the Speaker and voted on by the Commons on that date. So far, the Cooper and the Grive amendments have been put forward; the former is aimed at giving Parliament power to extend Article 50 while the latter gives parliament the power to hold &ldquo;indicative votes&rdquo; on Brexit options (such as a Norway or Canada-style).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* IMF </strong>cut global growth forecasts for 2019 to 3.5% and for 2020 to 3.6% as well as Euro-area growth forecasts for 2019 to 1.6% from 1.9%. However, it maintained US growth forecasts for 2019 at 2.5% and for 2020 at 1.8%. The IMF highlighted that risks to global growth have tilted to the downside and further escalation of trade tensions remains a key source of risk to outlook. A top economist noted that China growth is slowing as expected, though nothing dramatic is happening at this point; he highlighted that tax cuts and loosening of RRR cushioned the impact of tariffs and therefore their forecasts for China remain unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Turkish President Erdogan said that he and US President Trump will take measures on steel import tariffs from Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Further advances for the buck and on course to notch a 5th consecutive session of gains supported by the release of IMF&rsquo;s global growth outlook in which forecasts were cut while citing further downside risks due to trade tensions. As investors sought the Dollar amidst thinned liquidity and trade woes, DXY pushed higher to an intraday peak of 96.440 (vs. low 96.200) ahead of the psychological 96.500 and its 50 DMA at 96.600. The index then consolidated just above 96.300 following PM May&rsquo;s statement to Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, EUR: </strong>Cable remained within an intraday range of 1.2830-2910 as PM May&rsquo;s statement failed to provide anything substantially new in addressing The House of Commons. Sterling showed some initial weakness after the PM announced the EU is unlikely to extend Article 50 without the UK having a plan settled. Nonetheless cable pushed towards the top end of the range, around 1.2900, after PM May stressed the only way to rule out a no deal is to find an agreement. She also reached out to Parliament and voices outside the government for consultations on negotiating a mandate for the next phase. Meanwhile, the EUR succumbed to the firmer buck as EUR/USD gave up earlier gains to trade flat on the day and closer to the bottom of a 1.1360-1400 range, below its 50 DMA at 1.1379.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD:</strong> The trade-sensitive Aussie and Kiwi remain on the backfoot following IMF&rsquo;s global growth downgrade alongside a firmer greenback as both currencies hovered near the bottom of today&rsquo;s intraday range vs. the buck. AUD/USD breached its 100 DMA at 0.7173 and temporary slid further below 0.7150 to a session low of 0.7142. In regard to the Kiwi underperformance, Citi FX notes that the recent downside is &ldquo;probably more a function of a position flush-out than it is any shifts in underlying prospects&rdquo;, NZD/USD receded further below the 0.6750 level printed session lows just under 0.6720 ahead of the psychological 0.6700 and its 100 DMA at 0.6685. Elsewhere, the Loonie failed to gain impetus from the rising oil prices and yielded to the stronger Dollar with USD/CAD reclaiming the 1.3300 handle to the upside, but then failing to sustain that level sitting around 1.3290 in an intraday range of 1.3250-3317 ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.3341.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>A relatively docile day for the for the Yen following initial upside from disappointing Chinese growth numbers while USD/JPY traded within a tight 109.50-80 range while the absence of US participants drained liquidity. Elsewhere the Franc remained weak with stand-out news flow to affect the Swiss currency, EUR/CHF stabilised nearer to the top of a 1.1300-1.1350 range and similarly USD/CHF closer the top of the intraday range with speculation of potential SNB intervention taking place.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; Further advances for the buck and on course to notch a 5th consecutive session of gains supported by the release of IMF&rsquo;s global growth outlook in which forecasts were cut while citing further downside risks due to trade tensions. As investors sought the Dollar amidst thinned liquidity and trade woes, DXY pushed higher to an intraday peak of 96.440 (vs. low 96.200) ahead of the psychological 96.500 and its 50 DMA at 96.600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP, EUR </strong>&ndash; The Pound is poised to end the day little changed as earlier upside was erased on the back of a rising buck, while PM May&rsquo;s statement is yet to provide the Sterling with a clear direction, though not much is expected in way of a realistic and timely strategy. The Premier is scheduled to deliver her statement at 15:30 GMT with focus on any amendments tabled by MPs amid weekend reports that MPs will attempt to stop a no-deal scenarios post-statement. Two amendments to be aware of are the Cooper and Grieve amendments, the former is aimed at giving parliament power to extend Article 50 while the latter gives parliament the power to hold &ldquo;indicative votes&rdquo; on Brexit options (such as a Norway or Canada-style).&nbsp; Cable remained tentative below its 100 DMA at 1.2868 and within an intraday range of 1.2830-2900. Meanwhile, the EUR succumbed to the firmer buck as EUR/USD gave up earlier gains to trade flat on the day and closer to the bottom of a 1.1360-1400 range, below its 50 DMA at 1.1379.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong> &ndash; The trade-sensitive Aussie and Kiwi remain on the backfoot following IMF&rsquo;s global growth downgrade alongside a firmer greenback as both currencies hovered near the bottom of today&rsquo;s intraday range vs. the buck. AUD/USD breached its 100 DMA at 0.7173 and slid further below 0.7150 to a session low of 0.7142. In regard to the Kiwi underperformance, Citi FX notes that the recent downside is &ldquo;probably more a function of a position flush-out than it is any shifts in underlying prospects&rdquo;, NZD/USD receded further below the 0.6750 level printed session lows just under 0.6720 ahead of the psychological 0.6700 and its 100 DMA at 0.6685. Elsewhere, the Loonie failed to gain impetus from the rising oil prices and yielded to the stronger Dollar with USD/CAD reclaiming the 1.3300 handle to the upside in an intraday range of 1.3250-3317 ahead of its 50 DMA at 1.3341.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY, CHF </strong>&ndash; A relatively docile day for the for the Yen following initial upside from disappointing Chinese growth numbers while USD/JPY traded within a tight 109.50-80 range while the absence of US participants drained liquidity. Elsewhere the Franc remained weak with stand-out news flow to affect the Swiss currency, EUR/CHF stabilised nearer to the top of a 1.1300-1.1350 range and similarly USD/CHF closer the top of the intraday range with speculation of potential SNB intervention taking place.</p>\r\n",

FTSE MIB (-0.6%) is the underperforming index, weighed on by Telecom Italia (-1.9%) after the Co&rsquo;s proposal to confer all network assets into a separate company has been opposed by the communications regulator. Meanwhile, UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 (+0.3%) outperforms on currency effects and as the Pound awaits PM May&rsquo;s Brexit &ldquo;Plan B&rdquo;. Sectors are similarly in the red, with underperformance seen in Telecom names; where the aforementioned Telecom Italia is amongst those weighing on the sector. Other notable movers include William Hill (-2.6%) after the Co. state their full year operating profit for 2018 is expected to decrease from 2017&rsquo;s level. Separately, Henkel (-5.3%) are towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after guiding FY19 EPS lower to mid-single digits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Little changed and closer to the top of a 96.200-380 range following a relatively rangebound Asia-Pac session, with little reaction to the confirmation by USTR Lightihzer regarding little progress in intellectual property issues in US-Sino trade talks, while US President Trump dismissed the WSJ report about US mulling to lift China tariffs to move forward dialogue. Liquidity in the markets will likely be thin as US participants are away on MLK day, while State-side data remains scarce as the US government has been shut for almost a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, EUR &ndash; More angst for the Pound as PM May heads to the Commons later (around 15:30 GMT) to pitch her so-called &ldquo;Plan B&rdquo; with little expected in regard to a realistic strategy. Downing Street denied weekend reports that the Premier is looking to tweak the Good Friday agreement with Ireland to break the Brexit deadlock, while the Irish European Foreign Affairs Minister stated Ireland will not take part in bilateral talks and dialogue between EU and the UK, in turn pouring cold water on the Handelsblatt report from last week that the EU are ready to make further concessions on the backstop if the initiative comes from Ireland. Going back to May&rsquo;s statement, there were reports over the weekend that MPs are to ambush the Premier with amendments aimed at stopping a no-deal scenario. Two amendments to be aware of are the Cooper and Grieve amendments, the former is aimed at giving parliament power to extend Article 50 while the latter gives parliament the power to hold &ldquo;indicative votes&rdquo; on Brexit options (such as a Norway or Canada-style).&nbsp; GBP/USD current resides nearer to the bottom of a 1.2831-1.2900 range, below its 100 DMA at 1.2891 and around its 200 HMA at 1.2844. Meanwhile, the EUR remains firmer, albeit marginally as EUR/USD straddles around its 50 DMA at 1.1379 and closer to the middle of a 1.1361-1.1400 range ahead of the ECB interest rate decision on Thursday, while EUR 1.2bln in option expiries rest at strike 1.1400 for today&rsquo;s NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY, CHF &ndash; Mixed trade for the &ldquo;safe-haven&rdquo; currencies with the Yen slightly firmer upon the release of Chinese GDP which printed the slowest annual growth in almost three-decades, though this was widely expected by analysts amid the ongoing US-China trade disputes. USD/JPY resides in the middle of a 109.50-80 range, while the absence of US participants will drain liquidity. Elsewhere, further suspicious activity in the weakening Franc as EUR/CHF stabilises nearer to the top of a 1.1300-1.1350 range and similarly USD/CHF closer the top of the intraday range with speculation of potential SNB intervention taking place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD, NZD &ndash; The Kiwi underperforms in the G10 FX space as the currency is poised for its 6th consecutive session of losses amidst the backdrop of a global growth slowdown. NZD/USD extends losses below 0.6750 ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s NZ inflation release. Elsewhere, the Loonie is also on the backfoot as the decline in oil pressures the Canadian currency as USD/CAD breached its 50, 100 and 200 HMA&rsquo;s to the upside to settle just under 1.3290.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilt futures have kicked off the week on the front foot and outperform their peers ahead of PM May&rsquo;s amendable Brexit Plan B presentation, with Ireland refusing bilateral negotiations and speculation abound that the PM has abandoned cross-party efforts and has instead laid her focus on deal-making with Brussels. The 10-year UK benchmark trades with gains of over 30 ticks and is in close proximity to session highs of 122.81 as speculation also continues to mount about the possibility of an Article 50 extension, a move the Government has refused to rule out (yet).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German 10-year futures underperform their UK counterparts but are in the green by just under 10 ticks. This comes after Germany posted softer than expected PPI figures. On a technical standpoint 10-year Bund traders are eyeing the 164.34 January 18th high as the next level to the upside as resistance.

Separately, China produced 3.86mln BPD for December which is a 2.85% increase Y/Y; however, 2018 domestic output decreased to 3.8mln BPD vs. Prev. 3.85mln BPD.

Elsewhere, China&rsquo;s primary aluminium output increased for the second month to a record in high in December of over 3mln tonnes; in contrast China&rsquo;s daily average steel output in December fell to the lowest level since March, due to weaker profit margins.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; Little changed and closer to the top of a 96.200-380 range following a relatively rangebound Asia-Pac session, with little reaction to the confirmation by USTR Lightihzer regarding little progress in intellectual property issues in US-Sino trade talks, while US President Trump dismissed the WSJ report about US mulling to lift China tariffs to move forward dialogue. Liquidity in the markets will likely be thin as US participants are away on MLK day, while State-side data remains scarce as the US government has been shut for almost a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP, EUR </strong>&ndash; More angst for the Pound as PM May heads to the Commons later (around 15:30 GMT) to pitch her so-called &ldquo;Plan B&rdquo; with little expected in regard to a realistic strategy. Downing Street denied weekend reports that the Premier is looking to tweak the Good Friday agreement with Ireland to break the Brexit deadlock, while the Irish European Foreign Affairs Minister stated Ireland will not take part in bilateral talks and dialogue between EU and the UK, in turn pouring cold water on the Handelsblatt report from last week that the EU are ready to make further concessions on the backstop if the initiative comes from Ireland. Going back to May&rsquo;s statement, there were reports over the weekend that MPs are to ambush the Premier with amendments aimed at stopping a no-deal scenario. Two amendments to be aware of are the Cooper and Grieve amendments, the former is aimed at giving parliament power to extend Article 50 while the latter gives parliament the power to hold &ldquo;indicative votes&rdquo; on Brexit options (such as a Norway or Canada-style). &nbsp;GBP/USD current resides nearer to the bottom of a 1.2831-1.2900 range, below its 100 DMA at 1.2891 and around its 200 HMA at 1.2844. Meanwhile, the EUR remains firmer, albeit marginally as EUR/USD straddles around its 50 DMA at 1.1379 and closer to the middle of a 1.1361-1.1400 range ahead of the ECB interest rate decision on Thursday, while EUR 1.2bln in option expiries rest at strike 1.1400 for today&rsquo;s NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong> &ndash; Mixed trade for the &ldquo;safe-haven&rdquo; currencies with the Yen slightly firmer upon the release of Chinese GDP which printed the slowest annual growth in almost three-decades, though this was widely expected by analysts amid the ongoing US-China trade disputes. USD/JPY resides in the middle of a 109.50-80 range, while the absence of US participants will drain liquidity. Elsewhere, further suspicious activity in the weakening Franc as EUR/CHF stabilises nearer to the top of a 1.1300-1.1350 range and similarly USD/CHF closer the top of the intraday range with speculation of potential SNB intervention taking place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD, NZD </strong>&ndash; The Kiwi underperforms in the G10 FX space as the currency is poised for its 6th consecutive session of losses amidst the backdrop of a global growth slowdown. NZD/USD extends losses below 0.6750 ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s NZ inflation release. Elsewhere, the Loonie is also on the backfoot as the decline in oil pressures the Canadian currency as USD/CAD breached its 50, 100 and 200 HMA&rsquo;s to the upside to settle just under 1.3290.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) were both positive from the open as they benefitted from the US-China trade optimism, but then pulled-back from their highs heading into the Chinese data and after US Trade Representative Lighthizer noted there was little progress made with China regarding intellectual property theft. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) had a relatively tepid open on caution prior to the key data releases and after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations, although Chinese markets later breathed a sigh of relief from the inline GDP numbers, as well as better than expected Industrial Production and Retail Sales data. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded relatively flat with demand subdued amid the gains in riskier assets and with downside also limited by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 1tln of JGBs in maturities spread across the curve.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) were both positive from the open as they benefitted from the US-China trade optimism, but then pulled-back from their highs heading into the Chinese data and after US Trade Representative Lighthizer noted there was little progress made with China regarding intellectual property theft. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) saw a relatively tepid start on tentativeness prior to the key releases and after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations, although later saw mild relief from the inline GDP numbers, as well as better than expected Industrial Production and Retail Sales data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets struggle for firm direction with the US celebrating the long-weekend due to Martin Luther King Jr. Day which has kept DXY rangebound above the 96.00 level, while its major counterparts are mixed with EUR/USD attempting to recover some of its recent losses and with GBP/USD marginally slipping past Friday&rsquo;s lows ahead of PM May&rsquo;s &lsquo;Plan B&rsquo; deadline today. Furthermore, it was reported that PM May is considering amending the Good Friday Agreement to break the deadlock and that she held a conference call with the Cabinet in an effort to find a solution to the backstop issue, although a source noted the conversation was light on specifics and that there were no actual solutions proposed during the call. Elsewhere, high-beta currencies and USD/JPY trade indecisive although have found some mild solace in the aftermath of the Chinese data deluge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively flat with demand subdued amid the gains in riskier assets, although losses are stemmed and prices are off last week&rsquo;s lows amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 1tln of JGBs with maturities across the curve.</p>\r\n",
