CAD strengthened despite a dovish BOC, which some attributed to positioning going into the event skewing the price reaction after a less dovish than expected outcome, while USD weakness and oil strength supported the Loonie. The Aussie remains higher after GDP data overnight, touching 0.68.

Chipmakers in particular were buoyed with Microchip Technology (MCHP) raising sales guidance slightly; Citi noted that the CEO has a solid track record of calling the bottom and a well-respected macro read on the overall economy. Micron (MU) were higher after reports suggested Micron’s CEO visited China with the potential intention to increase shipments to the nation; RBC notes this should be a net positive for the name, and a potential negative for its competitors in Korea. Apple (AAPL) opened higher on the news that the company is mulling the release of a cheaper iPhone to attract EM and Chinese consumers. Starbucks (SBUX) and Tyson Foods (TSN) both cut guidance, and subsequently tanked in premarket trade. Merck &amp; Co. (MRK) shares slumped despite its Keytruda with the combination of Inlyta receiving approval from the EC. Navistar (NAV) shot higher after the co. beat on Q2 result forecasts. Tapestry (TPR) rose after the co’s CEO Luis stepped down. Roku (ROKU) were supported after the co. had its PT raised at DA Davidson. Kerig Dr Pepper (KDP) reversed early downside, despite the lowering its net sales outlook. Schlumberger (SLB) saw some upside on CEO comments; in which he said he sees international margin growth of over 5%. Fortive (FTV) traded higher in the pre-market after the co. announced its intention to separate into two independent companies, however shares fell 4.5% as trade progressed.&nbsp; Notable companies seeing upside on positive broker moves include; Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and TripAdvisor (TRIP).</p><p><strong>*</strong> <strong>WTI FUTURES (V) SETTLE USD 2.32 HIGHER AT USD 56.26/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (X9) SETTLE USD 2.44 HIGHER AT USD 60.70BBL: </strong>Energy prices rose firmly higher on Wednesday, in a move that partly took its cues from risk appetite but then caught traction after breaking through resistance levels. Russian Energy Minister Novak eased some supply concerns after announcing that Russia’s September production would fall from August’s level of 11.29mln bbls (a rise from July’s 11.15mln), which had raised some speculation if the OPEC+ kingpin would deviate further towards its production limit in an ominous signal to future supply cuts. Also of note, Canada’s Federal Court of Appeal has agreed to hear 6 challenges to trans mountain oil pipeline approval which relate to the consultation with indigenous people. Some of the tape action could also be attributed to the upcoming (delayed) US energy inventories, with the API reporting after the US equity close; current expectations see crude stocks drawing 2.5mln bbls, distillates building 0.5mln and gasoline drawing 1.5mln.</p><p><strong>*HONG KONG:</strong> The city's leader Carrie Lam formally announced the withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill, which sparked three-months of protests, SCMP reported. The withdrawal of the bull meets one of the five key demand protestors had imposed. While there is an argument that handling the protests may strengthen its hand (given the human rights angle disappears), some traders were sceptical, suggesting the moves were designed to ensure there were no protests over the 70th anniversary of the PRC, on 1st October.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB chief economist <strong>Lane</strong> avoided comments on monetary policy; however, talking about ECB's toolkit, says a package of measures (negative rates, forward guidance, APP, TLTRO) mutually reinforces monetary policy. He also suggested that most recent data points to mediocre inflation outcomes, below the ECB's preferred level, while falling inflation expectation was a live issue in discussions. Lane also noted that slack within the Eurozone remains extensive. ECB's <strong>Rehn</strong> (dove) said that easing measures work as a package, with significant complementary parts across their differing instruments. ECB's Muller (hawk) said high costs, and low profits at banks, says that their resilience to a downturn would be limited, even if capital ratios have improved.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed's <strong>Williams</strong> (Voter) said he was ready to act as appropriate to support the economy and a return to 2% inflation, calling on the Fed to be flexible. He suggested that the US economy was in a good place, but he was focused on persistently low inflation, and dis-inflationary pressures from abroad. In balanced comments, Williams said Fed's policy actions and communications have helped to loosen financial conditions, and should help his number one goal of sustaining the expansion, though also said that recent revisions to GDP and payrolls suggests a somewhat less robust momentum in the US economy. Williams also said he was not ready say what action is 'appropriate' at the September FOMC, adding that he'd need to see more economic data, while geopolitical uncertainties also influence his decision making. On the economy, Williams is looking for an above-trend rate of expansion at 2.0-2.5% this year, despite the trade uncertainties. Fed's <strong>Rosengren</strong> (voter, hawk) late on Tuesday said he saw no immediate need to loosen monetary policy, in a sign that he will likely dissent again at the 18th September FOMC. The comments were in contrast to those of Fed's <strong>Bullard</strong> (voter, dove), who has backed a 50bps rate cut to realign rates with market expectations - Bullard has previously called for rate cuts to help bring the US Treasury curve out of inversion. Fed's <strong>Kaplan</strong> (Dovish, Non-Voter) said the US economic picture was mixed: manufacturing was uncertain, and the consumer is strong. Kaplan said that if the Fed waits to see weakness in the consumer, then it is most probably already too late to act. He also said he is watching whether weakness intensifies. Kaplan also said the Fed staying where it is, above the Treasury curve, would generate distortions, and as such, would lead to challenges; he added that the downward move in the curve has been stimulative.</p><p><strong>* BEIGE BOOK:</strong> Fed’s Beige Book states US Economy appeared to expand at a modest pace, majority of businesses remained optimistic about the near-term outlook even though concerns on tariffs and trade uncertainty did continue. Impact of tariffs on pricing was mixed, however some districts did anticipate effects would not be felt for a few months. Consumer spending, a heavily watched metric by various Fed members, was mixed although auto sales for most districts did grow at a modest pace. Manufacturing activity was down from the prior release with employment in manufacturing being flat to lower. Overall employment grew at a modest pace and the pace of wage growth on balance remained modest to moderate. On the housing market, new home construction remained flat, but home sales remained constrained in the majority of districts due to low inventory levels.</p><p><strong>* US JULY TRADE:</strong> the international trade deficit narrowed to 54.0bln in July, from 55.5bln, as exports rose. However, Capital Economics said that it still leaves net trade on track to be nothing worse than a small drag on GDP growth in Q3, \"but that drag is likely to intensify further ahead thanks to the continued weakness of global demand and the latest rise in tariffs.\" On a political note, US/China July trade deficit widened to USD 32.78bln in July from USD 29.97bln in June.</p><p><strong>* PBOC:</strong> China's Cabinet said it would implement broad Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) cuts, and targeted RRR cuts \"in time,\" and will maintain prudent monetary policy and will fine-tune policy in a pre-emptive way, according to state media.</p><p><strong>* BOC:</strong> The central bank held rates at 1.75%, as was expected; the statement retained language on the accommodative stance of monetary policy remaining \"appropriate,\" although there was no mention of future policy moves. The Bank noted that US-China trade conflict had escalated, world trade was contracting, and business investment has weakened. The BOC also seemed to dismiss the strength of incoming data, attributing it to temporary factors (both on Q2 growth, and inflation at target; while it said that the Canada’s economy is operating close to potential, the Bank said it expects economic activity to slow in the second half of the year. The BOC also noted that commodity prices have drifted down, as concerns about global growth prospects have increased, though it removed the reference from the statement that it was monitoring the energy sector. It also said that, while housing activity has regained strength more quickly than expected, increased housing activity might contribute to high household indebtedness. NOTE: BoC Deputy Governor Schembri will deliver his Economic Progress Report on Thursday. In a delayed reaction to the data, USDCAD fell, apparently in a sign that the decision may have been more hawkish than anticipated. However, Scotiabank cautioned that the reaction might be more about position covering, in anticipation of a more dovish statement than was delivered, which had markets swinging too far in the opposite direction.</p><p><strong>* CHINA LOCAL GOVT ASSET SALE:</strong> China's local governments are selling assets to make up for revenue losses, Caixin reported. Governments of Guangdong, southwestern Sichuan and north-eastern Liaoning provinces are seeking to sell state-owned assets to support the implementing of tax cuts, as China's sweeping measures to cut taxes and fees amid slowing economic growth are putting pressure on local government budgets. The report said that the assets considered for sale will be idle state-owned assets, as well as those operating inefficiently over the long term. The Sichuan government plans to select and auction certain investments held by state-owned property companies.</p><p><strong>* CHINA PMI:</strong> The Caixin China Composite PMI (which covers both manufacturing and services) showed that, overall Chinese business activity rose further during August, the report said. Though modest, the rate of growth was the quickest recorded since April, with the Composite Output Index rising from 50.9 in July to 51.6. \"China’s economy showed clear signs of a recovery in August, especially in the employment sector,\" CEBM Group said, noting that counter cyclical policies have taken effect gradually. \"However, the Sino-US trade conflict remained a drag, and business confidence remained depressed,\" but still \"there’s no need to be too pessimistic about China’s economy, with the launch of a series of policies to promote high-quality growth.\" The Caixin services PMI meanwhile, rose to 52.1 from 51.6.</p><p><strong>* EZ PMI:</strong> The final Eurozone Composite Output Index came in at 51.9 (vs the flash 51.8, and July's final: 51.5); the services index came in at 53.5 (vs flash 53.4, and July's final 53.2). The reading is consistent with GDP growth of 0.2% in Q3, Markit said, assuming no substantial change in September's data. However, official data suggests growth might be even weaker than that, the survey compiler said. \"The picture remains very mixed both by sector and country, highlighting how downside risks persist.\" Markit notes that the manufacturing downturn, fuelled by deteriorating exports which are most intensely felt in Germany, continues to be offset by resilient growth in the service sector, which in turn, is being propped up to a large extent by solid consumer spending in domestic markets. \"The big question is how long this divergence can persist before the weakness of the manufacturing sector spreads to services and households,\" Markit said, \"with jobs growth waning to the slowest since early-2016 a deteriorating labour market looks set to be a key transmission mechanism by which the trade-led downturn infects the wider economy.\" It also points out that business optimism of the coming year fell sharply in the services sector, at the joint-lowest level in six years, which Markit says suggests that companies are already braced for tougher times ahead. \"We therefore expect to see renewed stimulus from the ECB in September as the central bank seeks to revive demand and stem the spreading malaise.\"</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK lawmakers voted to block a no deal Brexit, with the legislation now heading to the upper house to be voted on, where the prevailing wisdom is that it is likely to pass, although it is worth noting that there will be attempts to filibuster. UK PM Johnson has, in response, asked lawmakers to back a general election on 15th October, although UK opposition leader Corbyn stuck to his familiar line, that he will only back elections once no deal Brexit has been enshrined in law.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> BoE Governor Carney (Neutral) said preparations for a no deal Brexit means BoE assessment of worst-case Brexit scenario has become less severe. Looking through underlying trend, Carney's judgment is that economy is growing very weakly, close to zero, and he said that it stands to reason that if there was more time to prepare for Brexit then more would be accomplished. In the event of a no-deal, Carney said it is likely that the economy would slow, the GBP would fall and inflation would rise. In a worse case scenario, Carney sees a rise in unemployment to 7% with inflation peaking at 5.25%. He also added that the Financial Policy Committee might consider cutting banks' counter-cyclical buffer in the even of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p><strong>* UK PMI:</strong> The services PMI fell to 50.6 in August, from 51.4, against an expected 51.0. The UK all-sector output index fell to 49.7, which Markit says is consistent with a quarterly growth decline of 0.1%. Markit noted that falling manufacturing and construction output joined by near-stagnant service sector, business optimism and new orders deteriorated, while employment stalls, and selling prices rise at slower rate, despite higher costs. \"The likelihood of the UK falling into recession has increased after PMI surveys indicated a contraction of business activity in August,\" the survey compiler said, \"the survey also indicated that companies' margins are being squeezed via price competition, as selling prices rose at the slowest rate for over three years despite costs rising sharply due to the falling pound.\" The all-sector PMI is now at a level that would normally be associated with looser monetary policy. \"Such weak PMI readings have in fact never been seen before in over 20 years of history in the absence of either recent or imminent stimulus such as rate cuts or quantitative easing,\" Markit said, adding that in its view, \"even if a no-deal Brexit is avoided, the uncertainty relating to the UK’s trading position with the EU will spill into 2020, dampening demand, exports and investment,\" and accordingly, it \"remains unconvinced that the BOE will be in any position to hike interest rates at least until 2021, and the deteriorating data flow raises the possibility that, whatever happens in terms of Brexit, the next interest rate could be a cut.\"</p><p><strong>* AUSTRALIA Q2 GDP:</strong> +0.5% Q/Q, matching Q1 after an upward revision to the prior, with the Y/Y rate falling to 1.4%, a pace of growth last seen in the financial crisis, and crucially, below the RBA's 1.7% forecast. However, ING says we should not be focussing on the Y/Y rate: \"At only 1.4% Y/Y, a decrease from the 1.7% rate recorded in 1Q19, you might be tempted to paint a dim picture of Australian economic growth as measured by the latest 2Q GDP release, but that would be missing the point,\" ING writes, noting that the Y/Y tell us only what happened a year ago, not about what just happened; a year ago, Australian GDP was being buoyed by a pick up in government spending and some reasonably supportive net export figures. \"The more pertinent number is the Q/Q increase, which at 0.5%, is the same as in 1Q19, and on an annualised basis equates to a growth rate of 1.9%,\" and even by just maintaining this pace of quarterly growth for the rest of the year, Australian GDP will rise to 2.0% YoY by the end of 4Q19, the bank says, \"That might not sound too impressive, but given the weak trade and commodity backdrop, this is actually not a bad result.\"&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>US Envoy for Iran Brian Hook said there will be more sanctions coming on Iran and the US is not looking to grant any exceptions or waivers; adding that there is no concrete proposal of any credit line for Iran, or if there will be one (one of the proposals laid out by France was a credit line to allow for oil money). Previously the French had said that for their proposals with Iran to salvage the nuclear deal to be effective, there would need to be a resumption of oil waivers from the US.&nbsp; In aggregate, with the Iran-set deadline for the nuclear deal on Thursday, this non-compliance from the US seemingly sets the path for Iran to initiate its third reduction in commitments, which it has assured will be more pronounced than the prior two. Iran’s President Rouhani announced in late trade that its third step involves the development of centrifuges, which is used to enrich uranium. US President Trump also provided some rhetoric, saying Iran wants to talk and make a deal, US will not drop sanctions on Iran, and when asked if he would meet Iranian President Rouhani at the UN General Assembly, said anything is possible.</p><p><strong>* BOJ:</strong> Overnight, board member Kataoka stated that additional easing was required, and it is important for the central bank to take pre-emptive action.</p><p><strong>* RIKSBANK PREVIEW: </strong>In terms of Thursday's rate decision, rates expected to be left unchanged at -0.25%, and focus will be on any changes to the rate path; both domestic and international factors point to the Bank’s rate guidance being altered from their current hawkish path, as such this is the decisions focus point. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22696/download\">Click here to read our full preview</a>.</p>",

Russian Energy Minister Novak eased some supply concerns after announcing that Russia’s September production would fall from August’s level of 11.29mln bbls (a rise from July’s 11.15mln), which had raised some speculation if the OPEC+ kingpin would deviate further towards its production limit in an ominous signal to future supply cuts. Also of note, Canada’s Federal Court of Appeal has agreed to hear 6 challenges to trans mountain oil pipeline approval which relate to the consultation with indigenous people. Some of the tape action could also be attributed to the upcoming (delayed) US energy inventories, with the API reporting after the US equity close; current expectations see crude stocks drawing 2.5mln bbls, distillates building 0.5mln and gasoline drawing 1.5mln.</p>",

However, chart hurdles may also have dampened some of the anti-no Brexit deal euphoria alongside another UK PMI miss that prompted IHS/Market to project -0.1% Q3 GDP that would constitute a technical recession, with resistance at 1.2232 in Cable respected even though the Greenback remained soft in its own right (<strong>DXY </strong>extending its pull-back from 99.300+ 2019 highs to sub-98.500) and the aforementioned big figure in the Eur/Gbp cross holding.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency has extended gains vs the Buck beyond 1.1000 and some way in advance of a decent 1.2 bn option expiry at the strike, as better than expected Eurozone PMIs and Italy’s official Government coalition formation helped the Euro take advantage of the Dollar’s ongoing demise.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/NZD</strong></p><p>All firmer vs their US counterpart as the Aussie inches closer to 0.6800 in wake of above forecast Caixin non-manufacturing and composite Chinese PMIs that overshadowed in line Australian GDP, while the Loonie overcame resistance at 1.3300 with the aid of the BoC that held rates and maintained that current monetary policy is appropriate rather than shifting to a more dovish stance. Note, however, the accompanying statement did highlight heightened US-China trade tensions that has adversely impacted global trade and business investment, and Usd/Cad pared losses ahead of 1.3250 and the end of August low (1.3248), awaiting the latest Economic Progress Report tomorrow. Back down under, the Kiwi remained rooted around 0.6350 as Aud/Nzd hovered nearer the top of its 1.0705-1.0670 range.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Scandinavian Crowns both benefited from a broad upturn in risk sentiment that filtered through to crude prices, with Eur/Sek pivoting 10.7500 and Eur/Nok consolidating below 10.0000 within 9.9610-9935 parameters, and the latter also acknowledging faster Swedish services sector activity ahead of Thursday’s Riksbank policy meeting.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the traditional safe-haven currencies, with the Franc bid and outperforming instead of the Yen following typically dovish comments from BoJ dissenter Kataoka, while the SNB stays conspicuously silent ahead of respective policy convenes later this month. Usd/Chf is poised just above 0.9800 and Eur/Chf not far from 1.0800, while Usd/Jpy is back over 106.00.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Regional currencies are generally riding high vs a still softening Dollar amidst dovish Fed rhetoric from Bullard and Kaplan in contrast to others, with Usd/Zar convincingly down through 15.0000 and Usd/Try under 5.7000. Meanwhile, Usd/Ars has declined on a combination of ongoing intervention including capital controls, but with extra impetus from Fitch after a ratings upgrade.</p>",

Aud/Usd just pulled up shy of the 0.6800 mark with the added impetus of China’s Caixin services/composite PMIs surpassing expectations and not too ruffled by Aussie GDP data confirming forecasts for a slowdown in growth to GFC levels. Nzd/Usd continues to lag around 0.6350 as the Aud/Nzd cross holds above 1.0650, but Eur/Usd is back on the 1.1000 handle following a run of firmer than expected Eurozone services PMIs and ahead of more ECB speakers.

UK’s FTSE 100 (+0.3%) marginally lags its peers amid unfavourable Sterling action to exporters after the UK Parliament approved a motion to seize control of Parliamentary time in an attempt to block a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, Italy’s FTSE MIB (+1.5%) is led by constructive developments in Italian politics, after the 5SM’s online vote of grassroot members showed a backing for the formation of a 5SM/PD coalition, thus eliminating the risk of political limbo. Sectors are in a sea of green with substantial outperformance in consumer discretionary names as luxury stocks soar on optimistic Hong Kong news. Kering (+3.7%), Richemont (+3.5%), Swatch (+3.2%) all reside near the top of the Stoxx 600. In terms of individual movers, Thales (+6.4%) shares spiked higher at the open after posting an improvement in earnings, meanwhile Mediaset (+2.1%) shareholders approved the merger of its Italian and Spanish units to compete with the likes of Netflix. On the flip side, Barratt Developments (-1.4%) shares fell post-earnings, whilst Deutsche Telekom (-0.1%) is subdued amid reports that Illinois has joined the lawsuit aimed at blocked a merger between T-Mobile (of which Deutsche Telekom owns 63% of) and Sprint.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - The Pound remains at the top of the G10 ranks after MPs voted in favour of a no Brexit deal blocking motion last night, with Cable breaching technical resistance in the form of the 21 DMA at 1.2144 and Eur/Gbp extending its reversal through 0.9100 and pivoting 0.9050. However, Sterling lost some momentum after the UK services PMI completed a set of misses vs consensus and IHS/Markit conjects that the slowdown in the sector combined with more pronounced contraction in manufacturing and construction indicates that GDP is likely to slip 0.1% q/q in Q3. If confirmed this would mean a technical recession and Cable is waning just ahead of 1.2200 having eclipsed Monday’s 1.2175 high and Fib resistance around the same level, or 1.2176 to be precise.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/EUR/SEK</strong> - The next best majors and all benefiting from further Greenback weakness post yesterday’s sub-50 US manufacturing ISM (DXY down to 98.571) on top of a broad upturn in risk sentiment on the aforementioned positive Brexit developments, Italy’s 5-Star approving its tie-up with the PD party and Hong Kong’s CE Lam withdrawing the extradition bill. Aud/Usd just pulled up shy of the 0.6800 mark with the added impetus of China’s Caixin services/composite PMIs surpassing expectations and not too ruffled by Aussie GDP data confirming forecasts for a slowdown in growth to GFC levels. Nzd/Usd continues to lag around 0.6350 as the Aud/Nzd cross holds above 1.0650, but Eur/Usd is back on the 1.1000 handle following a run of firmer than expected Eurozone services PMIs and ahead of more ECB speakers.

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound remains at the top of the G10 ranks after MPs voted in favour of a no Brexit deal blocking motion last night, with Cable breaching technical resistance in the form of the 21 DMA at 1.2144 and Eur/Gbp extending its reversal through 0.9100 and pivoting 0.9050. However, Sterling lost some momentum after the UK services PMI completed a set of misses vs consensus and IHS/Markit conjects that the slowdown in the sector combined with more pronounced contraction in manufacturing and construction indicates that GDP is likely to slip 0.1% q/q in Q3. If confirmed this would mean a technical recession and Cable is waning just ahead of 1.2200 having eclipsed Monday’s 1.2175 high and Fib resistance around the same level, or 1.2176 to be precise.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/EUR/SEK</strong></p><p>The next best majors and all benefiting from further Greenback weakness post yesterday’s sub-50 US manufacturing ISM (<strong>DXY </strong>down to 98.571) on top of a broad upturn in risk sentiment on the aforementioned positive Brexit developments, Italy’s 5-Star approving its tie-up with the PD party and Hong Kong’s CE Lam withdrawing the extradition bill. Aud/Usd just pulled up shy of the 0.6800 mark with the added impetus of China’s Caixin services/composite PMIs surpassing expectations and not too ruffled by Aussie GDP data confirming forecasts for a slowdown in growth to GFC levels. Nzd/Usd continues to lag around 0.6350 as the Aud/Nzd cross holds above 1.0650, but Eur/Usd is back on the 1.1000 handle following a run of firmer than expected Eurozone services PMIs and ahead of more ECB speakers. Nevertheless, the Swedish Krona is outperforming on the back of an even stronger services PMI print and not perturbed by Nordea revising its Riksbank rate outlook from unchanged through 2020 to a 25 bp ease in December this year on the eve of this month’s policy meeting, with Eur/Sek straddling 10.7500.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>Also firmer vs the Greenback, but a bit more contained as the Loonie faces resistance around 1.3300 in the run up to Canadian trade data and the BoC, while the Franc is ever wary that too much appreciation will not be tolerated and is fading into 0.9840 with Eur/Chf meandering between 1.0825-60.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>Safe-haven unwinding has undermined the Yen, to an extent, as Usd/Jpy rebounds from sub-106.00 yet again, but hefty option expiries layered from 106.30-40, through 106.50-60 to 106.75-85 (5.5 bn in total) could keep the headline pair in check from a high circa 106.30 so far.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Broad gains vs the Greenback, with the Rand and Lira still leading the way, but perhaps some respite in store for the Ars in wake of an upgrade from Fitch to CC from RD for Argentina late on Tuesday.</p>",

        "content": "<p>With markets on the front foot this morning, following yesterday’s weak US ISM Manufacturing data induced sell-off, Nomura note that the market continues to swing between bouts of optimism and pessimism. With more important US macroeconomic data prints coming out later in the week, the bank say that investors should assume that market movements in the coming days are likely to be event-driven, as fundamentals focussed investors adjust their macro outlook. As the bank has continued to argue in recent weeks, its model suggests that fundamentals investors have been bullish on stocks due to a strong macroeconomic backdrop. Despite yesterday’s poor ISM Manufacturing reading<strong>, </strong>the model suggests that, for now at least, global macro hedge funds are still holding long on US equities. Nomura do however note some downside risk for US equities, and give 3 main reasons;</p><p>1) Although the argument has been made that last month's sell-off was mostly a technical phenomenon powered by systematic trading, the irregular pattern of deterioration the bank observed in its proprietary gauge of investor sentiment is suggestive of selling prompted by some sort of change on the fundamentals front, raising the risk of a repeat in September.</p><p>2) The bank argues that CTAs could start shorting US equities the next time the market goes risk-off. Although CTAs' immediate investment decisions may be technically driven, over the medium term, momentum-chasing positions tend to not stray too far from what fundamentals can support. On which note; should ISM manufacturing PMI come to in at 49.1 again for September, the bank’s estimates indicate that the position index we calculate for CTAs' net position in S&amp;P 500 futures ought to move to a more “short” position. Moreover, should S&amp;P 500 drop below 2,860 or so, CTAs would be likely to go back to exiting longs, in which event, CTAs may even go beyond clearing out the entirety of their net long position and shift to shorting.</p><p>3) Finally, the bank thinks that equity risk premium may have to increase; dividend yields (dividend divided by share price), the bank argues, have become dissociated from US manufacturing momentum, suggesting that either that prices have not fallen far enough, or that the market's expected rate of return is parked at a low level.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Overview</strong></p><ul><li>The UK Government lost a vote which has allowed Parliament to take control of the Parliamentary agenda, specifically securing the suspension of a rule which stated that only the government can create new laws. This vote followed on from PM Johnson losing his acting majority of one as Phillip Lee defected to the Liberal Democrats.</li></ul><p><strong>In Detail</strong></p><ul><li>In European hours, during a speech by PM Johnson, Tory MP Phillip Lee defected to the Liberal Democrats as such the Government lost their working majority of one. On this, it is worth highlighting that the majority was shaky at best as under former PM May’s government, members frequently defied party consensus (including Johnson himself).</li><li>House of Commons members seeking to stop a no-deal Brexit won a motion by 328 votes vs. 301 against, for the suspension of a Commons rule which stated that only the government can create new laws. This motion passed with the assistance of 21 Tory rebels (including former Chancellor Hammond) and subsequently government sources have confirmed that they will be removed from the Conservative party.</li></ul><p><strong>EU Rhetoric</strong></p><ul><li>EU Diplomats have reportedly stated that as Johnson has lost his majority it is futile for continue discussions, as they cannot be sure that whatever comes out of it will ever be translated into reality. As a reminder, the EU stance has been that if they are to provide an extension they need a clear roadmap of the UK’s reasons for doing so and the next steps, as long as there is evidence that the extension will result in progress.</li></ul><p><strong>Today’s Benn Bill/General Election</strong></p><ul><li>At around 1500BST MPs will see the presentation of the Benn bill, which aims to legally prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal, by calling for a Brexit extension until 31st January 2020 in the event that a Brexit agreement has not been passed by the 19th of October; except in the scenario that MPs vote for a no-deal Brexit. In the event that Europe agrees to this extension, the PM must immediately accept it and if an alternative date is proposed then Commons will have two days to reject this otherwise Johnson must accept it.</li><li>General consensus is that there is likely going to be a majority in favour of the Benn bill.</li><li>On the bill, reports indicate that 17 Labour MPs are planning to amend it by calling for the most recent version of former PM May’s deal to be placed before parliament. For reference, on its third passing through Parliament on March 29th May’s bill was rejected by 344 votes to 286.</li><li>In the event this bill passes the Commons it will then be rushed through the House of Lords and written into law prior to next week’s suspension of parliament. After which, UK PM Johnson is to call for a general election which under the Fixed Term Parliament Act requires a 2/3 majority in the commons. Regarding its passage through the House of Lords, reports have indicated that loyalists to the PM in the Lords have tabled 90 amendments to the oppositions motion in an attempt to significantly delay its passage.</li><li>Opposition party narrative has firmly stated that Corbyn would not provide the necessary support for a general election, until another Article 50 extension has been secured. Subsequently, recent reports indicate that the Labour party are not planning to prevent a vote on a snap election from happening, so if Johnson brings one forward it will go ahead. Though other reports have indicated that Labour will not back a general election on the PM’s terms.</li></ul><p><strong>Alternative Election Routes</strong></p><ul><li>Notwithstanding the aforementioned reports, in the event that Johnson cannot achieve a 2/3 majority for a general election there are a number of alternative methods available.</li><li>Some reports have suggested that the need for a majority can be avoided by Johnson passing a bill that says “notwithstanding the FTPA, we will have a general election on XX date”.</li><li>A no-confidence motion may be passed in the government; somewhat unlikely in the event that the Benn bill passes as the opposition would have secured their initial aims and as prior reports indicate this is seen as a last resort by the opposition due to their lack of conviction in securing a majority. Furthermore, such a motion would be unlikely to be supported by Tory rebels at this stage.</li><li>Finally, PM Johnson could theoretically call a no-confidence motion in his own government and order his party to abstain in the vote to ensure it passes.</li></ul><p><strong>Today’s Indicative Schedule</strong></p><ul><li>12:00BST – Prime Minister's Questions (PM Johnson debut)</li><li>13:00BST – Chancellor Javid will present the spending review (TBC)</li><li>15:00BST (Approx.) – The Benn bill to force a delay to Brexit will be introduced and all stages of the bill must be undertaken in the House of Commons today</li><li>19:00BST (Approx.) – Vote on the Benn bill</li><li>19:00BST onwards – If this passes, there could be a vote on a general election today (with a 90 minute debate for this on the parliamentary agenda for the day)</li></ul>",

ASX 200 (-0.6%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (+0.1%)</strong> were mixed with broad weakness seen across Australia’s sectors as participants digested GDP figures which showed growth slowed to its weakest since the GFC as expected and with a cut at next month’s RBA meeting seen as a coin flip. In terms of sectors, the top-weighted financial industry was among the laggards, although gold miners bucked the trend on recent strength in the precious metal. The Japanese benchmark was indecisive but pared opening losses as it found mild support from favourable currency moves, while <strong>Hang Seng (+1.0%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%)</strong> were positive after Chinese Caixin Services PMI topped estimates to print a 3-month high with Hong Kong the outperformer amid declines in money market rates and with a surge in WH Group after China announced incentives to support the pork industry including waiving highway transportation fees. However, gains in the mainland were restricted amid a continued PBoC liquidity drain and ongoing trade uncertainty after President Trump reiterated China will get a tougher deal if he wins the 2020 elections and was said to be angered by China's tariff retaliation that he wanted to double the tariffs but resorted to a 5% hike after consultations. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lacklustre amid the indecision in Japan and a lack of BoJ presence in the market, which saw prices retrace some of the recent gains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 60bln.

As such, its major counterparts held on to recent gains although further upside in <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was restricted amid expectations for a stimulus package at next week’s ECB meeting, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> reclaimed the 1.2100 handle after Parliament approved the motion to seize control of Parliamentary time in an attempt to block a no deal which prompted the government to respond with an election motion as anticipated.

However, prices since came off their highs, likely a function of the large slate of corporate issuance – 21 IG deals – but desks noted a large chunk of said issuance is expected to swap, providing a limit to the fade. At settlement the curve was generally steeper with the 2s30s widening by over 3bps, although the 5-year yield fell by just under 4.5bps which was slightly more than the 2-year yield’s decline. US T-note (U9) futures settled 13 ticks higher at 132-04.</p><p><strong>Fed's Bullard (Voter, Dovish)</strong> said a 50bps cut would align the Fed with market expectations and that the policy rate is too high, while he suggested it is better to get to the right point now rather than in small steps and that aggressive action is needed given the fall in yields as well as trade impact. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Rosengren (Voter, Hawkish Dissenter)</strong> said no immediate Fed action is needed if data stays on track but added the Fed should cut rates aggressively if risks materialize. Rosengren also commented that US economic conditions are relatively benign and that trade disruption, as well as global economic weakness pose risks to US economy although he suggested that elevated risks have not become a reality and it is a good time to watch incoming data carefully.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets eventually traded mostly higher as the headwinds from Wall St, where the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA snapped a 3-day win streak due to ongoing trade uncertainty and weak ISM Manufacturing, was eventually counterbalanced as data from the region provided some encouragement. ASX 200 (-0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) were mixed with broad weakness seen across Australia’s sectors as participants digested GDP figures which showed growth slowed to its weakest since the GFC as expected and with a cut at next month’s RBA meeting seen as a coin flip. In terms of sectors, the top-weighted financial industry was among the laggards after ASIC commenced proceedings against some mid-cap lenders for unfair contract terms to small businesses, although gold miners bucked the trend on recent strength in the precious metal. Elsewhere, the Japanese benchmark was indecisive but pared opening losses as it found mild support from favourable currency moves, while Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) were positive after Chinese Caixin Services PMI topped estimates to print a 3-month high with Hong Kong the outperformer amid declines in money market rates and with a surge in WH Group after China announced incentives to support the pork industry including waiving highway transportation fees. However, gains in the mainland were restricted amid a continued PBoC liquidity drain and ongoing trade uncertainty after President Trump reiterated China will get a tougher deal if he wins the 2020 elections and was said to be angered by China's tariff retaliation that he wanted to double the tariffs but resorted to a 5% hike after consultations. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lacklustre amid the indecision in Japan and a lack of BoJ presence in the market, which saw prices retrace some of the recent gains.</p>",

However, gains in the mainland were restricted amid a continued PBoC liquidity drain and ongoing trade uncertainty as President Trump reiterated China will get a tougher deal if he wins the 2020 elections and was said to be angered by China's tariff retaliation that he wanted to double the tariffs but resorted to a 5% hike after consultations.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY slipped back below the 99.00 level after recent data showed the manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in 3 years, with renewed criticism by US President Trump on the Fed and signs of a shift in tone from Fed’s Bullard towards a 50bps cut, providing no favours for the greenback. As such, its major counterparts hold on to recent gains although further upside in EUR/USD is restricted amid expectations for a stimulus package at next week’s ECB meeting with policymakers said to be leaning towards a rate cut, tiering and reinforced guidance, while GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.2100 handle after Parliament approved the motion to seize control of Parliamentary time in an attempt to block a no deal which prompted the government to respond by tabling an election motion as expected. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is choppy but is off lows to test 106.00 to the upside and antipodeans are also firmer due to the broad USD weakness and stronger PBoC reference rate setting, as well as the inline Australian GDP and Chinese Caixin Services PMI beat.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lacklustre amid the indecision in Japan and a lack of BoJ presence in the market, which saw prices retrace some of the recent gains.</p>",
