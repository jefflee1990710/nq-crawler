Fed also lowered Interest on excess reserves to 1.55% from Prev. 1.8% and stated “it will continue to monitor incoming information as it assesses the appropriate path\" for the FFR target range which was a slight tweak from the previous statement that from \"will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion\".</p><p>Fed repeated labour market is strong and economic growth is rising at a moderate rate, while it also affirmed that job gains have been solid and unemployment has remained low. Fed also repeated that household spending has been rising at a strong pace and inflation is still running beneath 2%.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell said the cut was an insurance against ongoing risks and believes monetary policy is in a good place, while he added current stance of monetary policy likely to remain appropriate and that policy is not on a pre-set course. Powell also commented he sees the risk to the outlook as having moved in a positive direction and that it would take a material reassessment in the outlook for the Fed to change its policy stance, while he added the Fed is not thinking about raising interest rates right now and needs to see a significant rise in inflation before considering rate hikes. (Newswires) Note: The dollar initially rallied after the Fed rate decision, where a statement tweak was interpreted as the Fed now in pause. However, through the course of Powell’s press conference, the USD was offered, with DXY moving into negative territory again after Chair Powell signalled that rate hikes were not on the table, leaving the bias for monetary policy to be on hold/lower.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said Chinese agricultural purchases will take some time to scale up to USD 40bln-50bln annual target and stated he is not at the point of making recommendation to President Trump on disposition of December 15th tariffs on Chinese goods. Mnuchin added he is encouraged by the Chinese Vice Commerce Minister's comments on planned market opening and that there no trips planned to Beijing for in-person talks although phone calls have been productive and will continue, while a later reported cited Mnuchin stating that a China deal will likely be signed in November.

It was later reported that China offered Macau as an alternative for the APEC summit, while the White House said there is no secondary site at the moment for the APEC summit and that the timeline for US-China trade deal does not change. (Newswires/Twitter/Fox)</p><p>Chinese Commerce Ministry affiliated expert said the cancellation of APEC summit in Chile is not a big obstacle for China and the US to sign a trade deal, as long as they reach one.

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>US stocks gained and the S&amp;P 500 was propelled to fresh record highs after the Fed delivered a 25bps rate cut as expected, while focus was also on earnings with the major indices getting a further lift after-hour from better than expected results from Apple and Facebook. General Electric (GE) also surged after beating top and bottom line estimates, providing relief to investors, in addition to constructive guidance for its FCF. Amgen (AMGN) was little changed despite beating on top and bottom, with firmer guidance, too. WellCare Health (WCG) traded higher after beating earnings estimates and reporting strong growth in its Medicare unit, boosting its pending acquirer Centene (CNC). AMD (AMD) sold off after reporting an in-line earnings report with lacklustre Q4 revenue guidance. Yum! Brands (YUM) dipped after missing its EPS estimate as its GrubHub (GRUB) investment and Pizza Hut unit dragged on it; GRUB bounced on the day following Tuesday’s nosedive. Molson Coors (TAP) underperformed on misses and announcement of “revitalisation” plan. Some other stocks getting a lift on earnings included Mattel (MAT), Garmin (GRMN), Southern Co (SO) and Concho Resources (CXO), conversely, some earnings induced losers included Molina Healthcare (MOH), C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW), McKesson (MCK), Edison International (EIX), Public Storage (PSA), TE Connectivity (TEL), IQVIA (IQV) and Hess (HES). S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 3047, NASDAQ-100 0.4% at 8083, Dow Jones 0.4% at 27188.</p><p>The curve bull-flattened after the Fed cut rates by 25bps, as expected; yields fell across the curve by between 4-7bps at settlement. The Fed chair seemed to suggest that the prospect of rate hikes was not on the table (he said he'd need to see significant surge in inflation before they were up for discussion, a scenario he did not envisage. After the rate decision, the probability of further easing this year was pretty much unchanged at just over 20%; the implied easing through the end of 2020 was also little changed (currently 32bps of easing is priced to the end of next year, it was around 55bps before today's 25bps rate cut); markets are now not pricing the next full rate cut until the July meeting. T-note futures (Z9) settled 7 ticks higher at 129-15+.</p>",

Hawkish dissent from George and Rosengren, again, although Bullard did not repeat his call for a deeper rate cut. The statement saw the Fed tweak its language on future rate moves, now stating it will \"continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate,\" (from \"will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion\" - a line that the market had taken to meet that the door to further cuts was open); the tweak was very subtle, which analysts said gives the Fed more policy optionality on future moves. Additionally, much of the language on the economy was left unchanged: labour markets still remain \"strong\"; economic growth was rising at a \"moderate rate\"; business fixed investment and exports \"remain weak\"; job gains have been \"solid\"; household spending was rising at a \"strong pace\"; inflation still running below 2%). The statement was generally as expected, and immediately, may be a sign that the so-called mid-cycle adjustment was over, with the Fed now re-entering data dependency. The market reaction was hawkish, but moderate, while pricing for future rate cuts also diminished.</p><p><strong>* PRESS CONFERENCE: </strong>Powell believes monetary policy is now in a good place, and the current stance of monetary policy was likely to remain appropriate, and that the risks to the outlook have moved in a positive direction (he cited US/China, as well as Brexit; noting that there is plenty of risk left, but they had subsided, and this might offer support to business investment ahead, which he did not see weakening further). Policy, however, was not on a pre-set course, and Fed would be prepared to adjust if there was a material change to the its outlook. Powell said the Fed was not currently mulling rate hikes, adding that inflation would need to significantly rise before rate hikes were on the table (the comment lead to positive ticks in the equity complex to session highs). The Fed chair said the rate cut was insurance against ongoing risks, and the accommodation provided so far will significant support the economy - the full impact would be realised over time, given the lag in monetary policy. The consumer sector was driving growth, and he noted it had been resilient this year. Overall, Powell seemed generally encouraged by the economy, repeating most of the Fed's outlook within the statement, but added that the Fed is mindful that continued below target inflation might lead to a slide in inflation expectations (he sees no risks of a significant move higher), and that weakness in global growth and trade still poses ongoing risks. All in all, and taken in combination with the statement, it indicates that the Fed's mid-cycle adjustment is over, and the Fed is now in a data-dependent approach to policy.</p><p><strong>* APEC SUMMIT:</strong> Chile cancelled the APEC summit scheduled for mid-November, where US President Trump and his Chinese counterpart were due to formally sign the Phase One trade agreement between the two nations. The summit was cancelled amid ongoing protests in Chile. Nevertheless, it still raises the question of when the nations' leaders will sign the Phase One -- there were some loose reports that China had offered a Macau summit, though nothing concrete has come of this. Indeed, a Global Times tweet noted that \"if China and the US were to sign an interim trade deal, as they appear to do so, and top leaders of the two countries were to meet for a signing ceremony, it would be in a neutral third-party country.\"</p><p><strong>* TSY SEC MNUCHIN</strong>: US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said Chinese agricultural purchases will take some time to scale up to a rate of between USD 40bln-50bln annual target, as Trump laid out in his Phase One deal. Crucially, Mnuchin added that, at this point, he was not making a recommendation to President Trump on the disposition of tariffs, due to come into effect on 15th December; Mnuchin did, however, say that he was encouraged by Chinese Vice Commerce Minister's comments on planned market openings. Mnuchin said that, as yet, no trips were planned to Beijing for in-person talks, phone calls have been productive and will continue. Mnuchin also stated the deal with China will likely be signed in November, in an interview with NYT.</p><p><strong>* US ADP: </strong>The ADP's gauge of private payrolls showed 125k against an expected 120k, though the previous was revised lower to 93k from 135k; some analysts noted that this confirmed that there was a significant slowdown in jobs growth over the last few months; Capital Economics said it is all the more striking because, due to methodological differences, this measure was not affected by the 50k striking workers at GM. \"Looking at the ADP breakdown, manufacturing employment – which includes the auto sector – declined by only 4k, illustrating that the near 50k GM workers were counted (unless the rest of the manufacturing sector had an unbelievably strong month),\" since the ADP counts workers who were simply on the payroll list, whereas the official non-farm payroll survey only counts workers who were paid during the survey period. The implications is that if those 50k are taken away from the ADP tally, the data will have printed 75k - slightly beneath the 80k private payrolls expected in Friday's Employment Situation Report. CapEco notes that this does not allow for the broader impact along supply chains, with workers at other firms being furloughed. \"For that reason, we estimate that payrolls increased by only 25k; of course, now the GM strike is over, payrolls will bounce back in November, but the broader story is that employment growth is trending lower, matching the drop off in GDP growth.\" The consultancy says that assuming that the downward trend in employment and activity growth continues, it is expecting the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday, as well as at its December meeting, \"even if the Fed tries to downplay expectations of the latter in the FOMC statement due later today.\"</p><p><strong>* US Q3 GDP: </strong>US GDP in Q3 was better than expected, falling to 1.9% Y/Y from 2.0%, against an expected 1.6%. Consumer spending remained buoyant (2.9% vs a prior 4.6% in Q2; real disposable income improved to 2.9%), and offset some of the weakness in business investment (down 3.0% vs down 1.0% in Q2 - likely on the drags from weak global growth, rising trade protectionism, elevated policy uncertainty, a strong dollar, and depressed energy activity), Oxford Economics observed, but with the US economy no longer fiscally insulated, and businesses feeling the pinch from squeezed profit margins, economic momentum is poised to slow into 2020. Core PCE inflation was up one-tenth to 1.7% Y/Y; OxEco said that the persistent inflation undershoots, weakened inflation expectations and concerning softness in US economic activity together bolster the case for further Fed easing in 2019. Looking ahead, the consultancy sees GDP momentum softening from 2.0% Y/Y in Q3 to 1.6% next year as global headwinds, lingering policy uncertainty and squeezed profits erode employment growth and confidence, and in turn, constrain consumers outlays growth.</p><p><strong>* US TREASURY REFUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT: </strong>Coupon sizes were left unchanged in the quarter, as many had expected. Quarterly refunding is expected at USD 84bln, to raise USD 23.5bln of new cash, refunding USD 60.5bln maturing securities. The Treasury said it is monitoring Fed's recent T-bill purchases, noting that it was possible that scarcity could develop in the T-bill market if Treasury maintains its current coupon issuance sizes. Wells Fargo's analysts said there was an implicit suggestion that the Fed deal with this scarcity issue by widening the scope of its purchases to include short-dated coupon securities, and idea that WFC says makes sense. The Treasury is also exploring new products, like a 1-year-SOFR-linked floater, a 20-year bond, and a 50-year bond, with the Treasury recommending an initial annual issuance size of a 20-year of around USD 140 billion, or 22% of 10-year or greater maturity issuance, which could grow over time. The TBAC also suggested that auctioning the 20-year in the third week of the month, settling it at month-end, and having it mature on the 15th of the month; WFC said this also seemed reasonable.</p><p><strong>* BOC: </strong>The BOC held rates at 1.75%, as was expected. However, it tweaked the conclusion of its statement, and also noted heightened concerns about the outlook for growth. The Bank's new conclusion stated that \"in considering the appropriate path for monetary policy, the Bank will be monitoring the extent to which the global slowdown spreads beyond manufacturing and investment,\" Adding that the \"Governing Council is mindful that the resilience of Canada’s economy will be increasingly tested as trade conflicts and uncertainty persists,\" and \"it will pay close attention to the sources of resilience in the Canadian economy – notably consumer spending and housing activity – as well as to fiscal policy developments.\" Within its forecasts, the BOC upgraded its 2019 GDP on the back of decent incoming data; but as expected, its 2020 and 2021 growth projections were cut. In wake of the rate decision and MPR, pricing for a December rate cut rose, with the implied probability of a cut running at around 40% vs under 10% before the announcement. At the press conference Governor Poloz confirmed that the GC had discussed the appropriateness of 'insurance cuts'; ultimately, the Bank decided against that strategy, however, Poloz did note that stricter mortgage rules could present financial stability risks from cutting rates was lower in the past.</p><p><strong>* BCB PREV: </strong>Brazil's central bank is expected to cut its Selic rate by 50bps to 5.00%, following the deceleration in inflation and the approval of pension reform. It is also expected to signal a further 50bps rate cut at its December confab, with money markets pricing in a 4.5% terminal Selic rate. However, some have warned that the BCB may be constrained in lowering rates further since the government's progress on further reforms is likely to be slow.</p><p><strong>* AUSSIE CPI: </strong>Was generally in line, with Q/Q at 0.5% and the Y/Y ticking up to 1.7% (though the later still beneath the RBA's target band, and analysts think next week's SOMP will continue to see a return to the mid-point remaining elusive). RBA governor Lowe overnight downplayed the significance of CPI, arguing that the Australian approach to inflation targeting together with the RBA's broad mandate are better suited to this changing world than are more rigid arrangements, whilst also reiterating that the central bank is prepared to use this flexibility to achieve its objectives in a way that limits financial imbalances, adding that there is more judgement involved than in an approach to monetary policy that mechanically sets interest rates so that forecast inflation is at the target in two years' time. UBS said that these 'new' comments argued against history repeating, with inflation alone seemingly no longer sufficient for another rate cut, at least not at the November meeting next week.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY CPI: </strong>Germany CPI printed 1.1% Y/Y in October (prev. 1.2%). Pantheon Macroeconomics said that the downtrend in German headline inflation appears over, and it looks for a rise ahead, at least insofar as goes energy inflation, which will be driven higher into year-end by base effects.</p><p><strong>* SOUTH AFRICA BUDGET: </strong>The medium-term budget saw growth forecasts slashed, and deficit forecasts widened, as expected. On Friday, Moody's is to review South Africa's Baa3/stable rating, the nation's sole remaining investment grade credit rating, which if lost might trigger ZAR 20bln of outflows, the IMF has estimated. However, many expect Moody's to adjust its outlook to negative from stable if fiscal metrics continue to deteriorate, before downgrading the sovereign, (NOTE: There is a chance Moody's could itself defer its decision, as it elected to do on the last two occasions it was due to provide an update) and analysts are generally of the view that today's announcement will make it more likely that the outlook will be revised on Friday.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 3047, NASDAQ-100 0.4% at 8083, Dow Jones 0.4% at 27188</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.6%, Consumer Staples 0.5%, Energy -2.1%, Financials -0.1%, Health Care 0.8%, Industrials 0.3%, Information Technology 0.6%, Materials 0%, Telecommunication Services 0.2%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.9%</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> General Electric (GE) surged after beating top and bottom line estimates, providing relief to investors, in addition to constructive guidance for its FCF. Amgen (AMGN) was little changed despite beating on top and bottom, with firmer guidance, too. WellCare Health (WCG) traded higher after beating earnings estimates and reporting strong growth in its Medicare unit, boosting its pending acquirer Centene (CNC). AMD (AMD) sold off after reporting an in-line earnings report with lacklustre Q4 revenue guidance. Yum! Brands (YUM) dipped after missing its EPS estimate as its GrubHub (GRUB) investment and Pizza Hut unit dragged on it; GRUB bounced on the day following Tuesday’s nosedive. Molson Coors (TAP) underperformed on misses and announcement of “revitalisation” plan. Some other stocks getting a lift on earnings included Mattel (MAT), Garmin (GRMN), Southern Co (SO) and Concho Resources (CXO), conversely, some earnings induced losers included Molina Healthcare (MOH), C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW), McKesson (MCK), Edison International (EIX), Public Storage (PSA), TE Connectivity (TEL), IQVIA (IQV) and Hess (HES).</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Fiat Chrysler Activision Blizzard (ATVI) made gains amid the growing strength of its new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) traded at the top of the DJIA amid third-party tests suggesting its talcum powder does not contain asbestos, as the FDA believes. Biogen (BIIB) made gains on an FDA approval for an MS treatment. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) edged higher ahead of a formal Peugeot (UG FP) merger deal announcement due soon, although unions have already begun expressing concerns. Duopoly Boeing (BA) and Airbus (AIR FP, EADSY) took a hit as the latter disappointed on earnings. Elsewhere, NY Post reported that Tiffany’s (TIF) met with LVMH (MC FP) executives and presented a USD 14.5bln offer, which saw some initial downside in shares albeit, the majority of the moves pared back shortly after. Alibaba (BABA) gained on source reports that it is eyeing a Hong Kong listing as early as November to raise up to USD 15bln.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.48 LOWER AT USD 55.06/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 0.99 LOWER AT USD 60.24/BBL: </strong>Crude benchmarks drifted lower through the session, with a bearish EIA report and hampered risk appetite weighing on the complex. The EIA reported a 5.7mln bbl build in crude stocks (exp +0.49mln, and in contrast to the API reported draw) with production remaining at record highs of 12.6mln BPD, Cushing built 1.57mln bbls, distillates drew less than expected, although gasoline drew more than expected and refinery utilisation rose larger than expected.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 129-15+. </strong>The curve bull-flattened after the Fed cut rates by 25bps, as expected; yields fell across the curve by between 4-7bps at settlement. The Fed chair seemed to suggest that the prospect of rate hikes was not on the table (he said he'd need to see significant surge in inflation before they were up for discussion, a scenario he did not envisage. After the rate decision, the probability of further easing this year was pretty much unchanged at just over 20%; the implied easing through the end of 2020 was also little changed (currently 32bps of easing is priced to the end of next year, it was around 55bps before today's 25bps rate cut); markets are now not pricing the next full rate cut until the July meeting.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP</strong>: <strong>USD:</strong> The dollar initially rallied after the Fed rate decision, where a statement tweak was interpreted as the Fed now in pause. However, through the course of Powell’s press conference, the USD was offered, with DXY moving into negative territory again after Chair Powell signalled that rate hikes were not on the table, leaving the bias for monetary policy to be on hold/lower. <strong>XAU</strong> whipsawed, and is higher, though ultimately has failed to top USD 1500, despite a small decline in real rates, while 2s10s rebounded from lows sub-16bps. <strong>JPY</strong> is mixed, up against the USD (slightly) but down against the EUR and AUD (antipodes firmer on the day, with Aussie CPI data overnight providing little for the RBA to be dovish about). <strong>CAD</strong> fell after the BOC left rates unchanged, and warned about risks (the implication is that these risks may eventually compel the BOC to trim rates). <strong>ZAR</strong> underperformer after its budget announcement, where growth forecasts were cut, and deficit projections were raised. <strong>TRY</strong> traded firmer today continuing to regain ground despite a house bill passing which looks to impose sanctions on Turkey for the offensive on Syria. Also of note, Turkish intel showed that the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from the Syrian border is not yet complete. <strong>MXN</strong> weakened throughout the session against the buck, however any weakness was reversed in Powell’s presser sending USDMXN back towards 19.10. <strong>BRL</strong> traded in a tight range today although headed into its Selic rate decision marginally firmer against the buck driven by dollar weakness back beneath the 4.00 handle. Tonight, the BCB are expected to cut its Selic rate for the third consecutive meeting, where consensus looks for another 50bps cut.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> With an election now booked for 12th December, Brexit newsflow is set to slow down as the campaigning gets underway. Whether or not Brexit uncertainty can finally be put to bed largely depends on whether one party can win a definitive majority, and so pursue their Brexit policy unhindered – for now, the Conservatives are favourites, although this can quickly change.

Policy, however, was not on a pre-set course, and Fed would be prepared to adjust if there was a material change to the its outlook. Powell said the Fed was not currently mulling rate hikes, adding that inflation would need to significantly rise before rate hikes were on the table (the comment lead to positive ticks in the equity complex to session highs). The Fed chair said the rate cut was insurance against ongoing risks, and the accommodation provided so far will significant support the economy - the full impact would be realised over time, given the lag in monetary policy. The consumer sector was driving growth, and he noted it had been resilient this year. Overall, Powell seemed generally encouraged by the economy, repeating most of the Fed's outlook within the statement, but added that the Fed is mindful that continued below target inflation might lead to a slide in inflation expectations (he sees no risks of a significant move higher), and that weakness in global growth and trade still poses ongoing risks. All in all, and taken in combination with the statement, it indicates that the Fed's mid-cycle adjustment is over, and the Fed is now in a data-dependent approach to policy.</p>",

The statement saw the Fed tweak its language on future rate moves, now stating it will \"continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate,\" (from \"will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion\" - a line that the market had taken to meet that the door to further cuts was open); the tweak was very subtle, which analysts said gives the Fed more policy optionality on future moves. Additionally, much of the language on the economy was left unchanged: labour markets still remain \"strong\"; economic growth was rising at a \"moderate rate\"; business fixed investment and exports \"remain weak\"; job gains have been \"solid\"; household spending was rising at a \"strong pace\"; inflation still running below 2%). The statement was generally as expected, and immediately, may be a sign that the so-called mid-cycle adjustment was over, with the Fed now re-entering data dependency -- we now look to Chair Powell's remarks for confirmation (1430 EDT/1830 GMT). The market reaction was hawkish, but moderate, while pricing for future rate cuts also diminished.&nbsp;</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Dollar pops as GDP tops forecasts, Loonie loses on BoC and Rand retreats on SA budget - next up FOMC",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar and Index have recouped losses ahead of the FOMC’s latest policy decision (full preview in the Research Suite of the RANsquawk website) with strength derived from the above-forecast headline GDP metric which propped the Index to fresh intraday highs of 97.76, ahead of its 100 DMA at 97.84 (vs. low 97.57). Analysts at Wells Fargo believe that the Q3 GDP performance was anticipated by most Fed officials and will not impact their decision later today. Meanwhile, the ADP national employment figures did little to sway the Buck as headline topped estimates, but the prior was revised considerably lower in the run up to Friday’s labour market report . Overall, DXY is poised to end the EU session little changed as traders eye the main event of the day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>Weaker in wake of the BoC’s latest monetary policy decision in which rates were maintained but a less optimistic outlook was adopted and warned that Canada’s resilience will increasingly be tested given the persisting trade conflicts and uncertainty. The MPR itself saw upward revisions revision to Q3 and end-2019 CPI and GDP growth forecasts whilst the end-2020 figures saw marginal cuts. All-in-all, participants focused on the overall downbeat statement which prompted USD/CAD to rise from around 1.3090 to 1.3160, having breached its 200 WMA at 1.3103. Next up, BoC Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins will partake in the post-meeting presser with traders on the lookout for more clarity on the next potential move, as this was not mentioned in the statement itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AUD, NZD</p><p>Following the US GDP metrics, the Aussie gave up most of its CPI-induced gains and drifted back towards the 0.6850 (ahead of its 100 DMA at 0.6848) mark having touched an intra-day peak at 0.6875. Meanwhile its Kiwi counterpart traded in tandem and is set to end the EU session around the 0.6350 mark with all eyes on FOMC for further action. Looking ahead, the region will see the release of Aussie housing data and NZ business outlook, with the former likely to garner some attention given recent RBA Board Members’ rhetoric and ahead of next week’s Central Bank Decision, with Deputy Governor Debelle previously noting that the housing market has a pervasive impact on the Aussie economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR, JPY</strong></p><p>Ultimately flat with focus on FOMC for fresh movement. Cable stabilised around 1.2875 having earlier retested yesterday’s high (1.2905) as focus now steers away from Brexit headlines and onto UK election developments after UK lawmakers approved the election bill for an election on December 12th. EUR/USD remained within a tight band just above the 1.1100 market with little action derived from the in-line German CPI metric and comments from incoming ECB President Lagarde who, just like her predecessor, called on fiscal policy to aid stem the EZ slowdown. Finally, JPY saw short-lived strength amid reports that Chile has suspended its hosting of the APEC summit in November which was initially perceived as risk-negative, although ultimately this does not signal a breakdown in US-China relations. USD/JPY immediately reversed the move and is ultimately flat just under 109.00 having traded in a 108.80-95 range ahead of its 200 DMA at 108.05.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The South African Rand stands as the EM laggard in light of a largely downbeat medium-term budget unveiled by the government which cut SA GDP growth forecasts from 2019 through to 2022, highlighted a wider 2019/20 budget deficit and also noted of increased risk of sovereign credit rating downgrades since the February budget ahead of Moody’s review on Friday. Moody’s remains the country’s sole investment grade credit rating (Baa3/Stable), which if lost could trigger outflows of around ZAR 20bln, according to IMF estimates. USD/ZAR recoiled from ~14.6000 to a high of 15.0700 having topped its 50 DMA at 14.9405. Meanwhile, the Turkish Lira shrugged off a House bill on hefty sanctions against the country over its Syria offensive, purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile system and the Armenian genocide in 1915. Further, the Turkish President noted that intel shows that Kurdish forces have not yet withdrawn from the border, thus rebuking Russia’s claims yesterday. On monetary policy, Erdogan stated that interest rates will be dropping to single digits from the current 14%, albeit a time frame was not specified. USD/TRY is set to end the EU session relatively flat having reversed earlier gains and having traded in a 5.7200-7700 band.</p>",

Parliament rejected an amendment proposed by Labour that would have moved the date of the election forward by three days and is set to dissolve on November 6th. Proposals for lowering the voting age or allowing EU citizens to vote were not selected by the deputy speaker for debate. The bill will today move to the House of Lords and is expected to be approved without any issues. Separately, UK PM Johnson has restored the whip to 10 of the 21 rebels who voted for the Benn Act (the law that forced the PM to ask for a three-month extension from the EU).</p><p><strong>* CAN THE CONSERVATIVES WIN A MAJORITY? </strong>The Conservative Party is currently leading in national polling, with latest polling giving them a 13-16% lead over the main opposition Labour party. However, polling can be inaccurate, and the levels of support indicated by current polls could change significantly by the time the election arrives, as happened in 2017. Indeed, back in 2017, the Conservatives were forecast to win 366 MPs on election day, but only managed 314 (12 short of a majority), while Labour won 266 seats, 59 more than projected. Nordea flag that many current Conservative seats are at risk; “several of (the) 317 seats (won in the 2017 election) came from constituencies which could prove difficult for the Conservatives to defend” says the bank. They give the example of the Conservatives strong performance in Scotland in 2017, but note that “popular leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, resigned following disputes with BoJo on his Brexit policy… Therefore, the Conservatives will likely lose some seats here”. Moreover, Nordea makes the point that a sitting government has never been able to keep (or gain on) an absolute majority when consumer confidence has been as low as it is now. On the other hand, the bank thinks there are still reasons for the Conservatives to be optimistic; firstly, opposition Labour Leader Corbyn is notoriously unpopular – recent data shows only approximately 15% of the public see him as their preferred Prime Minster to Johnson’s 35-40% (although Corbyn’s popularity ahead of the 2017 election was at similar levels). Secondly, as many have argued, Johnson can present his deal to the public as a way out of the Brexit impasse, amidst widespread appetite to “get Brexit done”. Indeed, with Brexit set to dominate the discussion at the coming election, factors that may have swung elections in the past (i.e. concerns over the current state of the economy) could take more of a back seat – meaning that the ruling Conservatives could be somewhat more insulated from the soft performance of the UK economy than they would otherwise. Current pricing on the Betfair betting exchange implies a 50/50 chance of a Conservative outright majority.</p><p><strong>* WHAT NEXT FOR BREXIT?</strong> It all depends on how the election goes. If current UK PM Johnson’s ruling Conservative Party win a majority, they should have no problems getting Johnson’s Brexit deal through parliament, meaning the UK should leave with Johnson’s deal by January 31st. If the Labour Party wins a majority, they have pledged to renegotiate a new deal with the EU, that would likely involve a Customs Union and greater alignment in areas such as environmental standards and workers rights. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to unilaterally revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit, while the Brexit Party will pursue a no deal Brexit (what they call a clean break Brexit). Clearly, a majority for any party would break the deadlock for any party would break the deadlock, as a party could pursue its Brexit policy unimpinged. However, Brexit uncertainty is set to continue should the election return a hung parliament. In this instance, Parliament may again be quarrelling over another extension to avoid no deal on 31 January.</p>",

Thus, the consumer staples sector outperforms. On the flip side, Spain’s IBEX (-1.2%) underperforms largely on the back of Santander (-5.9%) post-earnings with NII deteriorating from the prior quarter, hence the financial sector is hit. In terms of European M&amp;A, the French index is propped up by Peugeot (+6.0%) after the company and Italy’s Fiat Chrysler (+9.2%) commenced merger talks for a combined entity worth around USD 50bln, although sources noted that there is no guarantee that the two will reach a deal. Other earnings related large-cap movers include Standard Chartered (+2.5%), Bayer (+1.9%), Airbus (+1.7%), Volkswagen (+1.4%), and Credit Suisse (-2.5%).

Chair Powell is largely expected to keep the statement relatively unchanged from the prior meeting and focus will be on whether the Committee signals that it is now on pause, or whether the door to further cuts remains open.</p><p>GBP, EUR - Sterling and the Single currency remain little changed on the day thus far and above 1.1100 and 1.2850 respectively against the Greenback. Cable retested yesterday’s high at 1.2905 as focus steers away from Brexit headlines and onto UK election developments after UK lawmakers approved the election bill by 438 vs. 20 for an election on December 12th, with the last Parliamentary sitting on November 5th before dissolution. Meanwhile, EUR/USD has pulled back from intraday highs after testing its 100 DMA at around 1.1125 with the Single Currency little swayed by modest CPI cooling in German States, as expected looking at the forecasts for the national reading as a proxy. Ahead, incoming ECB President Lagarde is set to speak at 1800GMT alongside the Fed rate decision, with the latter likely to take centre stage.&nbsp;</p><p>AUD, NZD, CAD, JPY - All modestly firmer on the back of an overall softer USD, although the Aussie is underpinned by in-line CPI readings overnight which, coupled with RBA Governor Lowe’s reiterations yesterday, backs the case for the Central Bank to stand pat on its Cash Rate at next week’s meeting. AUD/USD rebounded from its 100 DMA at 0.6850 whilst upside in its Kiwi counterpart is somewhat capped as the AUD/NZD cross reclaimed 1.08+ status post-Aussie CPI. Elsewhere, the Loonie treads water around 1.3075 ahead of the BoC’s monetary policy decision today at 1400GMT (full preview available on the Research Suite of the RANsquawk website) with rates expected to be maintained and the Bank to remain upbeat given the incoming data; Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins will partake in the post-meeting presser at 1515GMT. It’s worth keeping in mind that around USD 850mln of USD/CAD options will expire at strikes 1.3100-10. Finally, the JPY remained within a tight intraday band (108.80-90), again with eyes on risk events and Dollar action with the pair eyeing a 2.1bln in options expiring at the psychological 109.00 ahead of its 200 DMA 109.05.</p><p>South Africa's State Utility Eskom says no loadshedding is expected today and there is a low probability of loadshedding this week</p><p><strong>Australian CPI (Q3) Q/Q 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.6%). </strong>(Newswires)</p><p><strong>Australian CPI (Q3) Y/Y 1.7% vs. Exp. 1.7% (Prev. 1.6%)</strong></p><p>Australian RBA Trimmed Mean CPI (Q3) Q/Q 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.4%)</p><p>Australian RBA Trimmed Mean CPI (Q3) Y/Y 1.6% vs. Exp. 1.6% (Prev. 1.6%)</p><p>Turkish President Erdogan says that interest rates will drop to single digits., currently the CBRT’s policy rate is 14%. (Newswires)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>A tentative and generally uninspiring session thus far for the fixed income complex. This morning has seen the release of data points of note out of Germany with unemployment metrics not substantially deviating from expectations and the state CPIs, unsurprisingly, printing slightly softer than prev. ahead of the mainland figure later today which is seen softer than September’s reading. In terms of price action, Bunds have stayed within a 30 tick range for the session thus far as, data aside, newsflow has been relatively quiet. UK debt has been supported this morning as the UK begins preparation for a December 12th General Election which sees Parliament dissolved on the 6th November. As such, gilts trade towards the top of the days range above the 132.0 mark; slightly further out the October 28th high lies at 132.31. Of note, the ECB has today resumed its APP which, in September, the ECB stated would occur at a EUR 20bln a month for an indefinite time period. This was expected to support the bond market, particularly in the periphery, though little in the way of an impact can be discerned in today’s price action; note, today does also see the introduction of the ECB’s tiered rate system. The small magnitude of today’s moves is due to focus remaining firmly on today’s FOMC rate decision, where expectations are for a 25bp cut and focus will once again be on the Bank’s guidance for the next meetings and any dissenters.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Crude prices are rangebound, </strong>in uneventful trade as the market awaits coming risk events in form of this evening’s FOMC meeting and EIA Inventory data. The latter is likely to settle some confusion surrounding last night’s API release; initial reports suggested a slightly higher than expected build of 590k bbls, later other sources suggested a draw of 1.7mln bbls and the major newswires were quiet on the subject. For now, WTI Dec’ 19 futures are bound by USD 55.15/bbl – USD 55.60/bbl parameters, whilst Brent is rangebound between USD 60.95/bbl – USD 61.35/bbl. In terms of metals; <strong>Gold</strong> is nudging slightly higher but, for now, has been unable to recoup much of the losses made this week, as trade remains tentative ahead of the Fed. Copper is a touch lower, but holds on to decent gains made in recent weeks. “Recent price strength in the metal has primarily been driven by disruptions and concerns over supply from Chile, coupled with a pullback in the US dollar index” notes ING, but they caveat that “underlying concerns over demand with the poorer macro backdrop is still the key theme for the market, despite this short-term noise”.</p><p><strong>API Energy Inventories Crude +0.59mln (exp. +0.5mln, Prev. +4.51mln),</strong> although other social media reports suggested contradicting figures of a 1.7mln bbl drawdown to crude inventories and newswires have not confirmed any figures.

This was expected to support the bond market, particularly in the periphery, though little in the way of an impact can be discerned in today’s price action; note, today does also see the introduction of the ECB’s tiered rate system. The small magnitude of today’s moves is due to focus remaining firmly on today’s FOMC rate decision, where expectations are for a 25bp cut and focus will once again be on the Bank’s guidance for the next meetings and any dissenters.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Crude</strong> prices are rangebound, in uneventful trade as the market awaits coming risk events in form of this evening’s FOMC meeting and EIA Inventory data. The latter is likely to settle some confusion surrounding last night’s API release; initial reports suggested a slightly higher than expected build of 590k bbls, later other sources suggested a draw of 1.7mln bbls and the major newswires were quiet on the subject. For now, <strong>WTI</strong> Dec’ 19 futures are bound by USD 55.15/bbl – USD 55.60/bbl parameters, whilst <strong>Brent</strong> is rangebound between USD 60.95/bbl – USD 61.35/bbl. In terms of metals; Gold is nudging slightly higher but, for now, has been unable to recoup much of the losses made this week, as trade remains tentative ahead of the Fed. <strong>Copper</strong> is a touch lower, but holds on to decent gains made in recent weeks. “Recent price strength in the metal has primarily been driven by disruptions and concerns over supply from Chile, coupled with a pullback in the US dollar index” notes ING, but they caveat that “underlying concerns over demand with the poorer macro backdrop is still the key theme for the market, despite this short-term noise”.</p>",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p><p>Modestly softer but off intraday lows of 97.585 with the broad Dollar and Index biding its time ahead of the advanced US GDP, ADP and more importantly the FOMC’s latest monetary policy decision (at 1800GMT due to the UK clock change) with markets pricing in almost a 100% chance of a 25bps cut to 1.50-1.75% (full preview available on the Research Suite of the RANsquawk website). Chair Powell is largely expected to keep the statement relatively unchanged from the prior meeting and focus will be on whether the Committee signals that it is now on pause, or whether the door to further cuts remains open.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>GBP, EUR</p><p>Sterling and the Single currency remain little changed on the day thus far and above 1.1100 and 1.2850 respectively against the Greenback. Cable retested yesterday’s high at 1.2905 as focus steers away from Brexit headlines and onto UK election developments after UK lawmakers approved the election bill by 438 vs. 20 for an election on December 12th, with the last Parliamentary sitting on November 5th before dissolution. Meanwhile, EUR/USD has pulled back from intraday highs after testing its 100 DMA at around 1.1125 with the Single Currency little swayed by modest CPI cooling in German States, as expected looking at the forecasts for the national reading as a proxy. Ahead, incoming ECB President Lagarde is set to speak at 1800GMT alongside the Fed rate decision, with the latter likely to take centre stage.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AUD, NZD, CAD, JPY</p><p>All modestly firmer on the back of an overall softer USD, although the Aussie is underpinned by in-line CPI readings overnight which, coupled with RBA Governor Lowe’s reiterations yesterday, backs the case for the Central Bank to stand pat on its Cash Rate at next week’s meeting. AUD/USD rebounded from its 100 DMA at 0.6850 whilst upside in its Kiwi counterpart is somewhat capped as the AUD/NZD cross reclaimed 1.08+ status post-Aussie CPI. Elsewhere, the Loonie treads water around 1.3075 ahead of the BoC’s monetary policy decision today at 1400GMT (full preview available on the Research Suite of the RANsquawk website) with rates expected to be maintained and the Bank to remain upbeat given the incoming data; Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins will partake in the post-meeting presser at 1515GMT. It’s worth keeping in mind that around USD 850mln of USD/CAD options will expire at strikes 1.3100-10. Finally, the JPY remained within a tight intraday band (108.80-90), again with eyes on risk events and Dollar action with the pair eyeing a 2.1bln in options expiring at the psychological 109.00 ahead of its 200 DMA 109.05.</p>",

The (small) lion’s share of the move came in the European session when major equity bourses began their trundle lower in anticipation of key risk events. There was a ramp up of corporate issuance on Tuesday, with ten issuers scheduled to hit the primary IG market - including a USD 4bln M&amp;A bond from Danaher (DHR) - potentially providing resistance to the wider debt complex. At settlement the curve was fractionally flatter with the 10-year yield down 1.8bps and the 2-year yield down 0.8bps, with participants now looking towards the FOMC on Wednesday. US T-notes (Z9) settled 3+ ticks higher at 129-08+. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mulvaney's aide Robert Blair is expected to testify in impeachment probe on Friday. (Newswires)</p>",

ASX 200 (-0.8%) was dragged by early underperformance in consumer staples amid losses in Woolworths despite reporting stronger revenue figures, as it also flagged a AUD 200mln-300mln impact related to the remediation for thousands of underpaid workers, while Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) mirrored a lacklustre currency but with declines cushioned by firm Retail Sales data which printed its highest growth since 2014 due to front-loading of purchases before the sales tax hike. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) conformed to the downbeat tone following an additional CNY 200bln liquidity drain and after a US official triggered doubts on whether the US-China phase 1 deal would be ready in time for the Chile APEC meeting. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher with prices supported by the risk averse tone and with the BoJ present in the long-end of the market, although upside was limited as the central bank kick-started its 2-day policy meeting.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly negative after the cautious tone rolled over from Wall St, with global sentiment dampened by mixed US-China trade rhetoric and tentativeness ahead of today’s FOMC. ASX 200 (-0.6%) is lower with Consumer Staples leading the broad sector declines for the index amid losses in Woolworths despite reporting stronger revenue figures, as it also flagged a AUD 200mln-300mln impact related to the remediation for thousands of underpaid workers, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4% ) mirrors a lacklustre currency but with declines cushioned by firm Retail Sales data which printed its highest since 2014 due to front-loading of purchases before the sales tax hike. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) conform to the downbeat tone across the region following an additional CNY 200bln liquidity drain and after a US official triggered doubts on whether a deal will be signed at the Chile APEC meeting, although the official also noted progress is being made and that if a deal is not signed it does not mean the talks have fallen apart, just that more time is needed.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady as it continues to bide time ahead of today’s FOMC with markets pricing in over 95% chance of the Fed lowering rates by 25bps to 1.50%-1.75%. The greenback’s transatlantic counterparts are also uneventful as EUR/USD holds on to recent gains back above the 1.1100 level and GBP/USD has stabilized after lawmakers approved UK PM Johnson’s bill for an election to be held on December 12th, with betting markets suggesting a 50-50 chance on whether the PM can achieve a majority government at the polls. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are lacklustre amid the cautious risk tone and antipodeans are choppy with early pressure in AUD/USD briefly reversed after inline Australian CPI data which, alongside the recent reiterations by RBA Governor Lowe, suggest a lack of urgency to cut rates again at next week’s meeting. TRY was also active overnight with mild weakness in the currency amid pressure from lawmakers stateside as the US House voted in favour of legislation seeking to impose sanctions on Turkey for its offensive in Syria and for a resolution recognizing Armenian genocide which is seen as a rebuke of Turkey.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices supported by the risk averse tone and with the BoJ also present in the long-end of the market, although gains are limited as the central bank kicks start its 2-day policy meeting.</p>",
