Officials did caveat, however, that progress is being still being made and if a deal is not signed in Chile it does not mean the talks have fallen apart, just that more time is needed.

While market pricing and the analyst consensus are looking for a rate cut, some have warned that there may be enough for the Fed to pause at this meeting. The FOMC will publish its rate decision on 31st October 2019 at 1800 GMT/1400 EDT. Post-meeting press conference with Fed Chair Powell scheduled for 1830 GMT/1430 EDT.

The earlier amendment for a date change to the 9th December, was rejected which now sends the UK to the polls on the 12th. Labour argued that the 9th would allow university students to vote where they are registered, but Conservatives did not believe that the 9th provided enough time to pass the bill through. Recent polling has seen labour slacking recently with the latest YouGov poll putting them at 22% and Conservatives at 37%. The FT tracker, which combines the polls, has conservatives leading with 35%, followed by labour at 25%, Lib Dems at 18%, Brexit Party at 11% and SNP/PC at 4%. However, the % of national votes do not necessarily translate into the seats acquired unless that individual seat is won, therefore eyeing the trend of polls may be more appropriate.</p><p><strong>* US CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: </strong>Consumer confidence fell in October, from a prior revised 126.3 to 125.9, missing expectations for a rise to 128. The print was within analyst expectations, however. which ranged from lows of 120 to highs of 132. The differentials between jobs plentiful and jobs hard to get picked up from 33.2 to 35.1, auguring well for the US jobless rate. Some analysts also note that, the UoM’s Sentiment gauge for October also ticked lower, missing expectations, a potential concern since consumer confidence has now fallen for three consecutive months. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that the trend is now probably declining and it expects “slowing payroll growth gradually to depress consumers’ sentiment through the late fall and winter, but it’s hard to expect it to plunge as long as the stock market is resilient and gas prices are low”. The consultancy also notes that the declining trend is not surprising due to the ongoing trade war, adding that consumers have not yet directly reacted to the tariffs on consumer goods.</p><p><strong>* US PENDING HOME SALES:</strong> Pending home sales rose by 1.5% in September, exceeding the consensus 0.9%; On a Y/Y basis, pending home sales are running at a clip of 6.3%, the strongest rate in four years. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that the rising trend in the index means that the hit to existing home sales from last year’s capping of state and local tax deductions has now reversed; the rebound in sales is tracking the upturn in mortgage demand, which Pantheon suggests points to new cycle highs for home sales over the next few months.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>EU's Dombrovskis said that the European Commission is not considering an option of asking Italy to amend its 2020 budget. One week ago, sources noted that the European Commission had asked Italy for “clarifications” over its 2020 budget, as such, one would assume concerns have been addressed (for now).</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 -0.1% at 3037, NASDAQ-100 -0.8% at 8048, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.1% at 27071</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -0.6%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0%, Energy&nbsp; 0.4%, Financials&nbsp; 0.3%, Health Care&nbsp; 1.2%, Industrials&nbsp; 0.4%, Information Technology&nbsp; -0.9%, Materials&nbsp; 0.7%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -1%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.1%</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Alphabet (GOOGL) weighed on tech and wider indices after a disappointing Q3 EPS figure, with its Other Bets segment’s profitability falling further. Health care titans Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) supported the sector after stellar earnings reports and guidance. Grubhub (GRUB) lost close to half its market cap after grim guidance and admittance to a struggling business model, also weighing on competitor Uber (UBER). Beyond Meat (BYND) lost a fifth of its market cap despite a forecast beating earnings report as investors raised concerns on its stretched valuation. T-Mobile (TMUS) came under pressure following a miss on revenue, with the Sprint (S) merger question still an overhang. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) spiked after beating top and bottom line estimates and raising its dividend by 50%, although the wider SOX sector traded subdued as the wider tech sector came under pressure. General Motors (GM) opened firmer after strong Q3 earnings, despite lower than expected guidance in wake of the UAW strike. Shopify (SHOP) opened lower after a surprise loss-per-share. Mastercard (MA) edged higher, where it beat consensus estimates but did warn of higher operating expenses going forward. Also surging on earnings were Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), Xerox (XRX), National Oilwell (NOV), Leggett &amp; Platt (LEG) Leidos (LDOS), HCA Healthcare (HCA), Incyte (INCY), Ingersoll-Rand (IR), Marsh &amp; McLennan (MMC) and Kellogg (K). Conversely, IPG Photonics (IPGP), Waters (WAT), A. O. Smith (AOS), Corning (GLW), SBA Communications (SBAC), Peabody Energy (BTU) were under pressure from their earnings reports.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) had a late day spike into the green after the WSJ reported it was in talks with Peugeot (UG FP) for a USD 50bln merger. Tesla (TSLA) sold off on its 10-Q filing where investors scrutinised its reporting, particularly the decline in quarterly domestic sales; Roth downgraded the stock to Sell citing warranty adjustments as a large driver of the margin beat, something that is unsustainable. Mirati Therapeutics (MRTX) spiked on a positive data from tumour treatment, MRTX849. PG&amp;E (PCG) pared some of its heavy losses as it restored power to more customers. Walmart (WMT) was the victim of Amazon’s (AMZN) free grocery delivery for Prime members announcement. Apache (APA) traded higher after a Sector Weight initiation at KeyBanc, citing an improving growth story.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.27 LOWER AT USD 55.54/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLED USD 0.02 LOWER AT USD 61.23/BBL: </strong>The crude complex mirrored equities in US trading hours, rising with the latter after US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin comments re. looser bank rules spurred risk sentiment. However, the complex has failed to fully recover from overnight/European morning losses and is still marginally lower on the day. Citi posit that the market may have already priced in a build in US commercial crude stocks for last week, but caveat that there could yet be further reaction as the actual data is reported. Others have noted continued Russian reluctance amid ongoing discussion on whether OPEC+ producers will be able to agree on deeper production cuts at the group’s next summit December 5th to 6th in Vienna. The Saudis appear ready to reduce output further, notes Citi, but they caveat that these positions are quite similar to a year ago, when a similar dance led to a last-minute agreement to cut for 2019, with Russia allowed to phase in compliance gradually. The bank cautions that there’s no guarantee of a repeat, but wouldn’t rule out a similar outcome for 2020, although slowing US production growth is a complicating factor for any decision making. Ahead of the API US energy inventory data on Tuesday evening and official EIA release on Wednesday, crude stocks are seen building 0.5mln bbls, gasoline drawing 2.4mln bbls and distillates drawing 2.4mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) SETTLED 3+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-08+. </strong>Albeit<strong> </strong>thin ranges, the TPLEX made headway as investors grew cautious amid talk of a delay to the US-China Phase 1 deal. The (small) lion’s share of the move came in the European session when major equity bourses began their trundle lower in anticipation of key risk events. There was a ramp up of corporate issuance on Tuesday, with ten issuers scheduled to hit the primary IG market - including a USD 4bln M&amp;A bond from Danaher (DHR) - potentially providing resistance to the wider debt complex. At settlement the curve was fractionally flatter with the 10-year yield down 1.8bps and the 2-year yield down 0.8bps, with participants now looking towards the FOMC on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:DXY&nbsp;</strong>saw choppy trade today where it initially traded firmer in the morning as GBP and EUR declined, however the gains were shortlived as the buck reversed its climb which was further boosted by weaker Consumer Confidence data which eventually saw DXY hit lows of 97.606 from highs of 97.93 as participants now await tomorrow’s Fed interest rate decision and Friday’s NFP report.&nbsp;<strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong>traded sideways today as UK is heading to the polls with tonight's early election bill passing. GBPUSD topped out at the psychological 1.29 level and sold off back to 1.2850 in the later half of trade, where desks note the level seemed rather stable in the morning, potentially magnetising the cross back to it. &nbsp;<strong>Havens,</strong>&nbsp;traded relatively flat today although caught a slight bid once it was announced that China and the US may not sign a deal at the Chile meeting, although the whole release of the report did state that the two still expect to sign it here, USDJPY traded in tight ranges today from 109.06 at the highs as the cross found resistance at the 200dma (109.05) to 108.78 at the lows.&nbsp;<strong>CHF</strong>&nbsp;traded flat against USD, GBP and EUR.&nbsp;<strong>XAU&nbsp;</strong>remains beneath the 1500 level on Tuesday also. Flanking the G10 rankings are&nbsp;<strong>AUD</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>Scandis</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>CAD</strong>; the former firmer despite reiterative comments from RBA Governor Lower reinforcing a readiness to cut the OCR again if needed, the Scandis weighed on by shifts in Norges Bank and Riksbank policy outlooks beyond normalisation cycles and the latter lower on falling WTI prices and ahead of tomorrow’s BoC meeting.&nbsp;<strong>NZD&nbsp;</strong>is flat and lags its antipodean counterpart following warnings from the NZ Treasury about S&amp;P downgrading its positive ratings outlook due to higher budget spending. In&nbsp;<strong>EMFX</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>ZAR</strong>&nbsp;is weaker but trying to stage a recovery, after plans unveiled to rescue Eskom failed to highlight debt restructuring, but subsequent statements from the Finance Minister did pledge to ensure no default.&nbsp;<strong>ARS</strong>&nbsp;is slightly lower, after making decent gains yesterday following yesterday’s imposition of capital controls.&nbsp;</p>",

However, the complex has failed to fully recover from overnight/European morning losses and is still marginally lower on the day. Citi posit that the market may have already priced in a build in US commercial crude stocks for last week, but caveat that there could yet be further reaction as the actual data is reported. Others have noted continued Russian reluctance amid ongoing discussion on whether OPEC+ producers will be able to agree on deeper production cuts at the group’s next summit December 5th to 6th in Vienna. The Saudis appear ready to reduce output further, notes Citi, but they caveat that these positions are quite similar to a year ago, when a similar dance led to a last-minute agreement to cut for 2019, with Russia allowed to phase in compliance gradually. The bank cautions that there’s no guarantee of a repeat, but wouldn’t rule out a similar outcome for 2020, although slowing US production growth is a complicating factor for any decision making. Ahead of the API US energy inventory data on Tuesday evening and official EIA release on Wednesday, crude stocks are seen building 0.5mln bbls, gasoline drawing 2.4mln bbls and distillates drawing 2.4mln bbls.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "BREXIT UPDATE: Johnson's fourth election vote set to pass, but could be scuppered by hostile amendments",
        "content": "<p><strong>* THE LATEST:</strong> Last night, the UK Parliament rejected PM Johnson's FTPA motion for an early election as expected, with 299 MP's voting in favour, short of the two-thirds (434) majority needed. Immediately after, UK PM Johnson gave notice that he will introduce a short bill for an election on December 12th, which would only require a simple majority but could be subject to amendments. Reportedly, Labour will back the government's bill to hold an election in early December regardless of the date, while the Liberal Democrats, have also indicated they will support the bill, as long as the government fulfils three conditions including ruling out no deal (fulfilled now there is an extension in place), dropping the WAB (note: the Lib Dems are an anti-Brexit party and, according to hypothetical polling, their support looks set to decline if the UK actually leaves the EU) and “setting the date in stone”. Hence, the bill looks set to pass and an early December election a done deal.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* AMENDMENTS:</strong> Midday Tuesday, UK lawmakers voted in favour of the Creasy amendment to the government's early election bill, which allows further amendments. The passing of this amendment opens the door to further amendments of the government's early election bill: Labour and the SNP are now pushing amendments to allow 16/17 year-olds and EU nationals to vote in the election (these two groups tend to lean heavily left/pro-remain). However, current expectations are that these amendments will not garner enough votes - the Lib Dems appear to have made a \"pact\" of sort with the government along the lines of the government dropping the WAB (ensuring the UK doesn't leave the EU before an election, which favours the Lib Dems) and compromising on the date of the election to hold it slightly earlier in exchange for the Lib Dems not backing any \"hostile amendments\" such as those detailed above. It is unclear how groups such as the DUP will vote. There is also an argument that logistically it will be impossible to register all of those extra voters prior in time for a December general election. However, if such amendments were to pass, the government has said it will pull the early election bill in its entirety, and may return to pushing for the passing of WAB. In terms of the amendment to the election's date, government sources indicated that it is willing to compromise and may accept an amendment that moves the date of the election forward one day to the 11th of December, a date which Labour has also indicated it will support.&nbsp;</p><p>With the opposition on board, the government's bill is expected to pass the House of Commons today, and could move to the House of Lords tomorrow, meaning the government could have secured an election by as soon as Thursday. For reference, the latest polling from YouGov gives the Conservative Party a commanding lead at 36%, Labour at 23%, Liberal Democrats at 18% and the Brexit Party at 12%. It is worth noting however, that translating national polling figures into parliamentary seats is difficult given the UK's first past the post system; a commonly used example is UKIP in the 2017 election; over 3 million voted for the party yet it won one seat in parliament.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* TODAY’S TIMINGS:</strong></p><p>16:30GMT onwards: Second Reading Vote for the government one-line bill for an election on December 12th.</p><p>18:30GMT onwards: Final vote on the bill.</p><p>Note: MP's will be denied individual votes on amendments in the scenario that there are too many, they will instead be put together into combined votes.</p>",

However, it is unclear if they will have the numbers to pass such an amendment - the Lib Dems appear to have made a \"pact\" of sort with the government along the lines of the government dropping the WAB (ensuring the UK doesnt leave the EU before an election, which favours the Lib Dems) and compromising on the date of the election to hold it slightly earlier in exchange for the Lib Dems not backing any \"hostile amendments\" such as those detailed above. It is unclear how groups such as the DUP will vote. There is also an argument that logistically it will be impossible to register all of those extra voters prior in time for a December general election. If such amendments was to pass however, the government is likely to pull the early election bill in its entirety, and may return to pushing for the passing of WAB.</li></ul>",

Also potentially weighing on the index is some negative news for Tesla (TSLA); the Co. says its 2019 capex is to be slightly below USD 1.5bln. Conversely, Dow (YM) Dec' 19 futures have nudged higher, with strong earnings from pharmaceutical components Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) acting as supportive - decent performance in these names is also helping prop up the health care sector, which for now is an out-performer.

Bourses are broadly in the red and remain choppy with no clear underperformer, albeit the region remains cautious ahead of this week’s risk events. Sectors are mostly in negative territory with the exception of Healthcare, which is buoyed by Fresenius SE (+4.5%) and Fresenius Medical Care (+5.8%) after earnings topped analyst estimates. On the flip side, the energy sector bears the brunt of softer energy prices coupled with overall downbeat numbers from oil-giant BP (-2.2%) who reported a 41% drop in Q3 net profits due to lower upstream earnings, softer oil prices, maintenance and weather impacts. Individual movers are largely earnings orientated, Grifols (+3.2%) benefit following firm earnings coupled with a EUR 5.3bln refinancing programme whilst to the downside, Stora Enso (-8%) shares plumbed the depths after disappointing earnings in which the Co. cited weak Q4 demand, thus peers Smurfit Kappa (-0.5%) and Mondi (-0.3%) initial fell in sympathy but has since trimmed losses. Finally, Swedbank (-3.8%) sunk after Estonian Financial Inspector and Sweden’s FSA opened sanctioning cases regarding the Co’s alleged money laundering.

Ahead, US housing data and APIs as the clock ticks down to the start of the Fed policy meeting and business end of the week.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> are softer this morning but once again not by any significant magnitude trading with losses of less that USD 1/bbl at present. News flow for the session thus far has again been light though this is likely to pick up from tomorrow via data and Central Bank meetings, including FOMC. For the rest of the session the main highlight will be tonight’s APIs which previously printed a build of 4.51mln and was notably not corroborated by the subsequent EIA metrics showing a draw of 1.69mln. Elsewhere, source reports note that Saudi Aramco is to announce the price range on November 17th and begin an IPO subscription on December 4th, aiming to trade on the Saudi Market from December 11th. Further, Nigeria’s new Energy Minister was on the wires this morning, albeit provided little by way of new substance. Elsewhere, gold prices remain tentative within a tight range, as is usually the case ahead of the Fed’s monetary policy meeting; however, the metal has just seen a modest sell off. Meanwhile, copper trimmed some of yesterday’s losses, again on the lookout for risk events. Finally, Dalian iron ore futures ended the day lower by 1.7% amid China demand woes.</p><p>Saudi Aramco is to reportedly announce price range on November 17th, start subscription for IPO on December 4th and trade on the Saudi stock market on December 11th, sources state.

Bourses are broadly in the red and remain choppy with no clear underperformer, albeit the region remains cautious ahead of this week’s risk events. Sectors are mostly in negative territory with the exception of Healthcare, which is buoyed by Fresenius SE (+4.5%) and Fresenius Medical Care (+5.8%) after earnings topped analyst estimates. On the flip side, the energy sector bears the brunt of softer energy prices coupled with overall downbeat numbers from oil-giant BP (-2.2%) who reported a 41% drop in Q3 net profits due to lower upstream earnings, softer oil prices, maintenance and weather impacts. Individual movers are largely earnings orientated, Grifols (+3.2%) benefit following firm earnings coupled with a EUR 5.3bln refinancing programme whilst to the downside, Stora Enso (-8%) shares plumbed the depths after disappointing earnings in which the Co. cited weak Q4 demand, thus peers Smurfit Kappa (-0.5%) and Mondi (-0.3%) initial fell in sympathy but has since trimmed losses. Finally, Swedbank (-3.8%) sunk after Estonian Financial Inspector and Sweden’s FSA opened sanctioning cases regarding the Co’s alleged money laundering. Looking ahead to US earnings, Dow listed Merck &amp; Co (2.1% weighting) and Pfzier (0.9% weighting) which may have follow-through effects to European peers.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - The Pound is looking precarious after the latest Parliament rejection of a motion to hold a GE on December 12 and ongoing wrangle to find an alternative date that might garner enough backing between Downing Street and those opposition parties that are likely to vote in favour of a snap poll. Cable has drifted back from 1.2850+ peaks towards 1.2800 and Monday’s low after slipping under Fib support at 1.2819, while Eur/Gbp has bounced from around 0.8622 to 0.8650 awaiting further developments and PM Johnson’s 4th attempt via a simple majority one-line bill with amendments.</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - Sterling weakness and some contagion has nudged the DXY a tad closer to 98.000 ahead of more US data and day 1 of the October FOMC meeting that is widely expected to culminate in a 3rd 25 bp rate cut, but probably highlight ongoing divergence between Fed policy-makers resulting in less clarity over forward guidance.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/NZD/CAD</strong> - All softer vs the Greenback, as the single currency remains top heavy around 1.1100, but underpinned ahead of Fib support at 1.1065, while the Franc continues to pivot 0.9950, Kiwi straddles 0.6350 and Loonie meander either side of 1.3050.</p><p><strong>AUD/JPY</strong> - Bucking the overall trend, albeit marginally and also largely rangebound awaiting this week’s big events that kick off from Wednesday. The Aussie is still outpacing is US and NZ peers as Aud/Usd hovers around 0.6850 and Aud/Nzd just shy of 1.0800, but not deriving much impetus via comments from RBA Governor Lowe broadly reaffirming the on hold for now with an easing bias stance. However, looming CPI data could well be influential ahead of housing metrics on Thursday and PPI the following day. Elsewhere, the Yen has pared some losses from a test of 200 DMA support at 109.06 and decent option expiry interest from 109.00 to 109.10 (1.6 bn) even though Japan Post Insurance is eyeing less JGB holdings in the October-March period.</p><p><strong>NOK</strong> - The Norwegian Crown is underperforming and only just holding off fresh record lows vs the Euro circa 10.2575 amidst softer crude prices and Norges Bank rhetoric underlining that rates are likely to remain unchanged for the entire forecast horizon, or coming period to quote Nicolaisen verbatim.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Rand has rapidly depreciated in wake of outlines of the SA Government’s plan for Eskom that did not include debt restructuring and propelled Usd/Zar up sharply towards 14.7200 vs near 14.5300 at one stage.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>A solid enough uptake for UK linkers may have been discounted given ongoing Brexit uncertainly and potential inflation implications, but the recovery in debt markets was already gathering more momentum regardless.

News flow for the session thus far has again been light though this is likely to pick up from tomorrow via data and Central Bank meetings, including FOMC. For the rest of the session the main highlight will be tonight’s APIs which previously printed a build of 4.51mln and was notably not corroborated by the subsequent EIA metrics showing a draw of 1.69mln. Elsewhere, source reports note that Saudi Aramco is to announce the price range on November 17th and begin an IPO subscription on December 4th, aiming to trade on the Saudi Market from December 11th. Further, Nigeria’s new Energy Minister was on the wires this morning, albeit provided little by way of new substance. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices initially remained within a tight range, although the yellow metal experienced some selling pressure in recent trade with little by way of immediate fundamental catalysts. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> trimmed some of yesterday’s losses, again on the lookout for risk events. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> futures ended the day lower by 1.7% amid China demand woes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Elsewhere, Sterling is similarly unfazed by PM Johnson’s 3rd failure to tee up a pre-Xmas election and perhaps comforted by his official acceptance of the latest Brextension to January 31 next year, awaiting the outcome of his 4th attempt later today. In the interim, BoE mortgage lending, approvals and consumer credit are scheduled before the DMO’s Gbp1.1 bn 2028 linker auction and an appearance at the CFA by BoE Governor Carney that comes with no published text and is unlikely to contain much in the way of new policy guidance as per comments from Tenreyro yesterday.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as the region attempts to sustain the impetus from Wall St where the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ 100 notched record highs after US-China trade optimism was further fuelled by comments from US President Trump that suggested a signing of the phase 1 deal could be ahead of schedule. ASX 200 (+0.1%) was lifted at the open although some of the gains were later faded amid losses in commodity stocks due to lower oil prices and after the precious metal gave up the USD 1500/oz level, while Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) briefly reclaimed the 23000 milestone for the first time in over a year as it benefits from a more favourable currency. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) are the laggards despite the current backdrop of heightened trade optimism, with participants digesting a slew of earnings and after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations which resulted to a substantial CNY 250bln liquidity drain.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat and has stuck to within the thin range from the prior US session with a non-committal tone seen as we approach closer to this week’s blockbuster risk events stateside, while its major counterparts are also uneventful with EUR/USD treading water around 1.1100 and with GBP/USD partially reversing some of the support from the EU’s approval of the 3-month Brexit “flextension”. Furthermore, UK PM Johnson’s request for an election was rejected by Parliament as expected, but he will attempt again with one-line bill today to change the law and get around the two-thirds majority needed for an early election. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses hold on to recent gains amid the mostly positive risk tone and after softer than expected Tokyo inflation despite this month’s sales tax increase, while antipodeans are firmer as they benefit from their high-beta properties and after the PBoC strengthened the CNY reference rate setting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs tracked the losses in T-notes amid gains in stocks and with the Japanese benchmark at a yearly high, while demand for JGBs is also subdued ahead of a 2yr JGB auction later.</p>",
