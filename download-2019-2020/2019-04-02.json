However, the official went on to say that it is unlikely that China would agree to a trade agreement enforcement mechanism with unilateral US right to retaliation unless all US tariffs on Chinese goods are first withdrawn, adding that progress needs to be made this week by negotiators on both sides in regards to the enforcement mechanism and tariff removal, elevating the sense of urgency. Elsewhere, US President Trump again threatened to shut the southern border between US and Mexico. US NEC Director Kudlow said the US is looking at ways to allow freight passage if the border does shut, showing the US’ concerns of a trade impact. There was concern from the Republican party too, where Senate Republican Leader McConnell said that shutting the border could have a catastrophic impact on the US economy.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May said the UK needs a further extension of Article 50 process, and that would end when a deal has been passed. She said she will reach out to UK opposition leader Corbyn to try and put together a unified approach which she can present to the EU next week, with the aim of having legislation completed by May 22nd (some would consider this a short extension). If an agreement with Labour cannot be reached,. She would agree to a set of arrangements to be put to the House, and pledged to abide by the decision of the House. May said that some in her Cabinet were frustrated with Brexit delay, and would prefer to leave with no deal, although May said leaving with a deal would be best. There is a suggestion that May's approach is pivoting towards a soft-Brexit (some in her Cabinet and her party prefer a no deal), and some note that it appears May has abandon her plans to pass the Brexit deal with Tory/DUP votes. A senior EU official said that the WA would need to be approved by MPs next week - if the UK doesn’t participate EP elections - because otherwise a short extension is “not imaginable” as it would “jeopardise” elections. UK PM May spokesperson says UK is setting a course where we hope it won't be necessary to participate in the EU Parliament elections; it is possible to cancel participation right up to the day of those elections. Responding to May’s speech, opposition leader Corbyn welcomed talks, and said Parliament must be able to vote to prevent UK crashing out of the EU, adding he would bring a no confidence vote against the Govt if a majority cannot be achieved in Parliament.</p><p><strong>* US DURABLE GOODS: </strong>Durable goods orders for February declined 1.6% M/M, slightly better than the expected decline of 1.8%; January’s initially reported 0.3% M/M rise was revised lower to a 0.1%. Looking beneath the headline figure, a nosedive in aircraft orders was a key drag on the data, however, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics note, “these numbers are so volatile that they are best ignored month-to-month; the data certainly have nothing to say about the implications of the recent disasters on the medium-term outlook for Boeing, which dominates the aircraft component.” The more focused on non-defence capital goods ex-aircraft component saw a 0.1% decline, where the January figure was revised up by 1ppt to a rise of 0.9%. The consultancy adds that the fall is expected following the turn lower for the ISM orders index at the end of 2018, “the ISM orders index appears now to have stabilized, averting a disaster, but orders likely need to soften a bit further given the previous decline.”</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLED $0.99 HIGHER AT $62.58; BRENT (M9) SETTLED $0.36 HIGHER AT $69.37. </strong>The positive momentum from Monday’s rally has carried over into Tuesday, particularly WTI, in the backdrop of tightening oil supply and ahead of API inventory data. Russian Energy Minister Novak fed the OPEC+ supply cut narrative today saying that Russia’s production levels would be in-line with the proposed output cuts by the end of the month. The narrowing of the WTI/Brent Arb supports the view of the market seeing a draw in crude and its products from US energy inventories, where expectations for the API’s after the US equity close today see crude drawing 0.4mln bbls, distillates 0.5mln bbls and gasoline 1.5mln bbls; Genscape sees the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub building by 141K.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.00% at 2867, NDX +0.28% at 7500, DJI -0.30% at 16180. SECTORS: Energy -0.70%, Materials +0.40%, Industrials -0.06%, Cons Discretionary -0.02%, Cons Staples -0.84%, Healthcare -0.24%, Financials -0.01%, Tech +0.30%, Telecoms +0.40%, Utilities +0.11%, Communications +0.54%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Delta Air Lines (DAL) surged on Tuesday after it forecasted a strong Q1, causing other airlines to follow suit including American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL). DowDuPont (DWDP) traded at the top of the Dow Jones index after its Dow (DOW) unit completed its spin off to become a publicly traded company, Dow surged on its first day of trading. Facebook (FB) opened higher with thanks to a Deutsche Bank analyst noting that it could unlock USD 10bln of annual revenue from Instagram shopping. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) gave a disappointing earnings report and guidance seeing it suffer losses of double digits, weighing on CVS (CVS) and other healthcare stocks. Wingstop (WING) and Alcoa (AA) nosedived following downgrades at Guggenheim and Credit Suisse respectively. Conversely, Qorvo (QRVO) and Quest Diagnostics (DGX) both benefitted from upgrades at Keybanc and Jefferies respectively. Netflix (NFLX) came under pressure from a neutral initiation at Rosenblatt.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 5 TICKS HIGHER AT 123-24+. </strong>Action was rangebound and horizontal, with a bias higher with risk-sentiment cooling after Monday’s PMI/ISM inspired bounce. The complex managed to look through the US data; after UK PM May’s remarks, which points to a softer form of Brexit, Treasuries saw small downside as US stocks saw positive ticks. Major curve spreads were relatively unchanged at settlement.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> GBP rose into positive territory after UK PM May's address, and also supported the EUR, which had hit a fresh YTD low on Tuesday. A vague risk-off feel after Monday's chipper mood saw EMFX pressured, as the USD generally remained strong through the session (though flirts with flat as the APAC day comes into view). In EMFX, the ZAR was unable to hold on to gains after Moody's affirmed the sovereign at Baa3 (keeping it at IG - the only IG rating it has); and Fitch affirmed the US at AAA, though there was little follow through despite the warnings on higher deficits at this stage in the cycle. The AUD and NZD were hit (dovish RBA, weak NZIER confidence, respectively). The JPY, meanwhile, couldn't break above its 200dma (around 111.45). Commodity FX (NOK and RUB) couldn't managed to carve out gains, despite Brent seeing fresh 2019 highs.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Dovish tweaks to the RBA's statement put the Aussie on the defensive, and analysts have argued that the moves open the door to potential rate cuts in the future. The statement previously stated that \"the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time,\" was changed to \"the Board judged that it was appropriate to hold the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting. The Board will continue to monitor developments and set monetary policy to support sustainable growth in the economy and achieve the inflation target over time.\" The folks at UBS have argued that while the former says that policy is appropriately set to hit the central bank's targets, the new guidance says that they are open to moving rates to hit their targets. UBS also notes that this came amid the RBA also softening its growth view. Some have questioned why the Aussie hasn't been skewered today, and the answer probably lies in the Aussie Budget, unveiled post-RBA, which will see chunky tax cuts, while the govt is also foreseeing a lift in wage growth; the Budget comes ahead of elections, and as such, some analysts are sceptical that the govt will be able to deliver. However, with that, along with iron ore prices firming as producers scale back production amid cyclones in Western Australia; optimism about China, and the nascent recovery in manufacturing could also provide support in the months ahead, even though China is taking a harder line with the Aussies than they are the Kiwis.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> It appears UK PM May has given up on relying on \"support\" from the DUP and Brexiteers within her own party, instead pursuing talks with the opposition to try and engineer a Brexit deal. However, there is still a chance that the PM's deal could be presented again (in a different form, most likely) offering Brexiteers one last chance to back the 'hardest' of all Brexit options seemingly on the table. The other options that seems to be gaining support among lawmakers are the Customs Union, which is not appealing to Brexiteers since it would not allow the UK to start trade negotiations with other nations. PM May's new approach may be limited, however, JPMorgan said, with the bank doubtful that her request will get very far. May's approach is not without risks (analyst Helen Thomas identified the risks: Labour support will likely come at a price, including a potential election/referendum; the Brexiteers themselves could come after her with no confidence motions against the government in Parliament; May could lose support for her own deal; remainers could unite on a course of action contrary to May's/Conservative objectives). The default position remains that the UK leaves on 12 April without a deal, if May cannot next week convince EU to extend the A50 process; however, some sources have suggested that the EC would be prepared to accept an extension, perhaps even beyond the European Parliament elections, if the UK agreed to participate, and agreed to other conditions.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>GBP rose into positive territory after UK PM May's address, and also supported the EUR, which had hit a fresh YTD low on Tuesday. A vague risk-off feel after Monday's chipper mood saw EMFX pressured, as the USD generally remained strong through the session (though flirts with flat as the APAC day comes into view). In EMFX, the ZAR was unable to hold on to gains after Moody's affirmed the sovereign at Baa3 (keeping it at IG - the only IG rating it has); and Fitch affirmed the US at AAA, though there was little follow through despite the warnings on higher deficits at this stage in the cycle. The AUD and NZD were hit (dovish RBA, weak NZIER confidence, respectively). The JPY, meanwhile, couldn't break above its 200dma (around 111.45). Commodity FX (NOK and RUB) couldn't managed to carve out gains, despite Brent seeing fresh 2019 highs.</p><p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Dovish tweaks to the RBA's statement put the Aussie on the defensive, and analysts have argued that the moves open the door to potential rate cuts in the future. The statement previously stated that \"the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time,\" was changed to \"the Board judged that it was appropriate to hold the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting. The Board will continue to monitor developments and set monetary policy to support sustainable growth in the economy and achieve the inflation target over time.\" The folks at UBS have argued that while the former says that policy is appropriately set to hit the central bank's targets, the new guidance says that they are open to moving rates to hit their targets. UBS also notes that this came amid the RBA also softening its growth view. Some have questioned why the Aussie hasn't been skewered today, and the answer probably lies in the Aussie Budget, unveiled post-RBA, which will see chunky tax cuts, while the govt is also foreseeing a lift in wage growth; the Budget comes ahead of elections, and as such, some analysts are sceptical that the govt will be able to deliver. However, with that, along with iron ore prices firming as producers scale back production amid cyclones in Western Australia; optimism about China, and the nascent recovery in manufacturing could also provide support in the months ahead, even though China is taking a harder line with the Aussies than they are the Kiwis.</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>It appears UK PM May has given up on relying on \"support\" from the DUP and Brexiteers within her own party, instead pursuing talks with the opposition to try and engineer a Brexit deal. However, there is still a chance that the PM's deal could be presented again (in a different form, most likely) offering rexiteers one last chance to back the 'hardest' of all Brexit options seemingly on the table. The other options that seems to be gaining support among lawmakers are the Customs Union, which is not appealing to Brexiteers since it would not allow the UK to start trade negotiations with other nations. PM May's new approach may be limited, however, JPMorgan said, with the bank doubtful that her request will get very far. May's approach is not without risks (analyst Helen Thomas identified the risks: Labour support will likely come at a price, including a potential election/referendum; the Brexiteers themself could come after her with no confidence motions against the government in Parliament; May could lose support for her own deal; remainers could unite on a course of action contrary to May's/Conservative objectives). The default position remains that the UK leaves on 12 April without a deal, if May cannot next week convince EU to extend the A50 process; however, some sources have suggested that the EC would be prepared to accept an extension, perhaps even beyond the European Parliament elections, if the UK agreed to participate, and agreed to other conditions.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Greenback looks set to forge more ground vs its major counterparts after a stellar NY ISM embellished Monday’s better than forecast US manufacturing survey, while weakness elsewhere also provided impetus. Indeed, the Buck is firmer across the G10 board and the DXY is nudging highs of the day at 97.494, with another close above the 97.245 Fib (76.4% retracement from 2019 high to 95.735 March low) boding well for further gains through 97.500 and towards the 97.711 ytd best.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/GBP</strong></p><p>Still at the bottom of the G10 pile, but the Kiwi is now the biggest loser having slipped under 0.6750 vs its US peer and through 1.0450 against the Aussie that is trying to find a base vs the Usd around 0.7065. To recap, the RBA tweaked its forward guidance overnight via a more data-dependent and active approach towards adjusting the Cash Rate Target to support the economy having previously contended that keeping the benchmark low is consistent with maintaining sound growth. However, a relatively expansive Budget with tax cuts aimed at the lower to middle income workers will also help take some of the strain, and the focus down under switches back to the Nzd for the latest GDT auction (revealing an uptick in dairy prices, but softer WMP) hot on the heels of a downbeat Q1 NZIER business survey. Meanwhile, Cable is clinging to the 1.3000 handle amidst speculation that UK PM May could make a statement after the latest Brexit Cabinet crisis meeting (although a Downing Street source has downplayed the reports) and a cross-party group of MPs prepare to present a bill to rule out no deal on April 12. This all follows yet another round of blank IVs last night and warnings from the EU that there is absolutely no room for renegotiating the WA.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>As above, some changes in the ranks, but the Loonie and single currency are weakest of the bunch on USMCA jitters that also hit the Mexican Peso after US House Speaker Pelosi laid down criteria before the deal can be signed off and Eurozone/US growth divergence respectively. Usd/Cad is edging back up towards 1.3350 and Eur/Usd is seriously testing Fib support sub-1.1200 around 1.1187-86, with 1.1177 (low for the year so far) next in sight for sellers. Meanwhile, the Franc remains near the base of a 1.0000-0.9984 range and Usd/Jpy midway between 111.30-45 trading parameters.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Another temporary prop for the Zar vs more pain for the Try as the US suspended F-35s to Turkey, with Moody’s publishing its latest SA credit review (expected last Friday) and keeping the Baa3 rating alongside a stable outlook (latter was at risk of a downgrade, according to some). The Rand rallied over 14.8000 at one stage in response, but was subsequently overwhelmed by broader Usd strength, while the Lira weakened to 5.6330+ at worst.</p>",

The RBA maintained rates as widely expected, but alongside an ongoing neutral policy stance there was a tweak to the accompanying statement suggesting that keeping the status quo may not be enough to support growth as it has for the past 2 ½ years. Instead, data and developments will be monitored to see if the Cash Rate requires an adjustment. Note, little reaction to the pre-election Budget despite a significant rise in the projected 2019/2020 surplus vs December’s forecast and a proposed Aud158 bn tax cut package as the Government also acknowledged the emergence of genuine and clear downside risks that might impact an otherwise sound domestic economy. Elsewhere, Nzd/Usd has fallen in sympathy from circa 0.6804 to 0.6768, but also independently in response to a marked deterioration in Q1 NZIER sentiment, while Cable has retreated further from 1.3100+ highs due to UK-specific factors as yet another round of IVs in the HoC found no common ground on any of the 4 alternative Brexit strategies put forward, albeit with the CU motion moving a lot closer gaining a majority. Cable has pared some losses from a 1.3025 low and Eur/Gbp has eased back from a whisker under 0.8600 on a firmer than forecast UK construction PMI, though still sub-50. Technically, 1.3030 is daily chart support for Cable and the 200 DMA is 1.2977, while flow-wise a hefty 1.2 bn option expiry between 1.3045-55 may cap a firmer rebound, as could 1 bn rolling off in Aud/Usd at the 0.7100 strike.</p><p><strong>CAD/EUR/CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All weaker vs the Greenback, as the <strong>DXY</strong> edges closer towards 97.500 and ytd peaks in wake of yesterday’s upbeat US manufacturing PMI and profiting from the demise of major rivals. Usd/Cad remains above 1.3300 after Monday’s disappointing Canadian PMI, while the single currency is struggling to keep hold of the 1.1200 handle where a hefty option expiry sits (1 bn) and has dipped just a few pips short of key Fib support (1.1187/6) protecting the 2019 low at 1.1177. Elsewhere, slightly above consensus Swiss CPI has not held the Franc recover vs the Buck within a par-0.9984 range, but it is holding just above 1.1200 against the Euro. Usd/Jpy has nudged up towards 111.50 and the 200 DMA (111.48) after its recent range break and clearance of chart resistance, but may yet be drawn back to the 111.00-20 region given 2.4 bn expiries.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira continues to underperform regional counterparts on political grounds and renewed Turkish-US tensions following the latter’s decision to suspend deliveries of F-35 jets, with Usd/Try back up near the upper end of a 5.6125-5.4775 range.</p>",

Following the rejection of all four options, Conservative Remainer MP Boles (one of the architects of the indicative vote plan) left the party.</p><p><strong>*WHAT’S NEXT: </strong>The next steps are unclear thus far. UK PM May will meet her cabinet later today (potentially 0900BST) for talks on the next steps and MPs penciled in talks for April 3rd which could be used to re-discuss different Brexit plans.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/e27a6b79-e0d7-4dbe-8f0b-0223e49e6bca.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FIVE POTENTIAL FUTURE SCENARIOS:</strong></p><p><strong>(1) Parliament tries to force May's hand by agreeing an alternative Brexit plan:</strong> Speaker Bercow expected to choose options that did well at the previous indicative votes (customs union, second referendum). Risks: no majority prevails again; could be pointless if May presents her deal again in the wake, and it that passes.</p><p><strong>(2) May brings her deal back:</strong> Talks continue to convince the dissenting Tories and DUP lawmakers (34 and 10 respectively), although it seems unlikely. However, May is pitting her deal against options which are unpopular to many Tories (A Norway model, or second referendum); but many of her Party would likely prefer a no deal.</p><p><strong>(3) MPs vote for a second referendum (a confirmatory referendum on any deal agreed by Parliament):</strong> This was motion that garnered most support at last week’s indicative votes, though failed to generate a majority. Has opposition support, and still an option to be used as an amendment in future legislation. Limited Conservative support. Could be divisive for the country.</p><p><strong>(4) No deal: </strong>Parliament fails to agree and the default remains the UK will leave the EU on 12 April, despite lawmakers having ruled-out this scenario in multiple votes previously. Unless a credible plan is presented to the EU by 10/Apr, there is a risk that some may be reluctant to accept any extension request, and therefore, an exit could happen by accident.</p><p><strong>(5) May tries to call an election:</strong>This has been hinted before as a warning to back May; opposition has already called for an election. Could lead to the EU granting a longer extension, and the UK participating in EU Parliament elections 23-26 May.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback mildly benefitted from a subdued tone across its major counterparts in which <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> stuck at 3-week lows near 1.1200 where a large option expiry for today’s New York cut resides. <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> fell below the 1.3100 handle after Parliament rejected all motions in the indicative votes, although Motion C which calls for a Customs Union only lost by a tight margin of 3 votes (273 vs. 276). Following the results, there was said to be increased cabinet consensus to reluctantly accept a customs union if PM May's deal loses during a final round run-off in indicative votes expected for Thursday, although others were said to demand PM May issue an ultimatum to the EU to improve the backstop or it will be a no-deal on April 12th. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was driven by risk sentiment, while antipodeans were pressured with <strong>NZD</strong> dampened by weak NZIER Business Confidence. <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was choppy overnight with the pair only briefly supported by strong Building Approvals figures as participants awaited the RBA which was eventually met with some indecision as the central bank kept rates unchanged as expected and kept to a neutral tone. This initially saw a knee-jerk reaction to the upside for <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> as some dovish bets were disappointed, although the currency then retreated to pre-announcement levels and further below as markets eventually digested parts of the statement concerning increased downside risks for the global economy and that the RBA will set policy to support growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RBA kept the Cash Rate Target unchanged at 1.50% as expected</strong> and reiterated that low rates are supporting the economy and that the labour market remains strong, while inflation remains low and stable.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were lacklustre and remained near its lowest levels in over 3 weeks amid a firmer greenback and as safe-havens were shunned, while <strong>copper</strong> was steady and took a breather from recent advances despite the risk appetite and <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> futures hitting a record intraday high.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>US official said US is considering additional sanctions on Iran, aiming at parts of the economy that have not been hit before and reiterates previous goal to get Iran oil exports as close to zero as possible.

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>US</p><p>Risk-on was the theme after China PMI data reassured that the country has seen a stabilisation in the manufacturing sector, and combined with a chipper ISM manufacturing report out of the US, the stage was set for yields to rise. In fact, it appears yields are set for the biggest-single day rise in around three-months (2s yields +5.3bps at settle, 5s yields +6.9bps, 10s yields +8.2bps, 30s yields +7bps). Major curves bear-steepened modestly (1.2bps to 2.6bps), though 10s30s saw some small narrowing. The much-watched 3m/10yr spread moved back into positive territory with reassuring global growth signs (ex-EZ PMIs); while this spread is only a symptom of a much larger cause, analysts seem to be more generally buying-into the argument presented by some Fed officials of late, which suggested that structural factors have diminished the recession signal, though the growth concerns remain valid. US T-note futures (M9) settled 19+ ticks lower at 123-19+.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as the regional bourses sustain the global rally and pick up the bullish baton from Wall St where sentiment was underpinned and growth fears were eased by strong PMI data from US and China. ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) are positive with tech, energy and financials leading the upside in Australia and with price action in the Japanese benchmark mainly currency-driven. Furthermore, participants await any dovish clues from the RBA, as well as the Federal Budget which is seen as a platform for upcoming elections and is expected to include income tax cuts, billions for infrastructure spending and its first surplus in 12 years of AUD 4.1bln. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) remain upbeat after the recent data recovery and amid optimism ahead of this week’s US-China trade talks in Washington, while outperformance is seen in gambling names following the better than expected Macau gaming revenue figures.</p><p>In FX markets, price action is relatively quiet ahead of upcoming risk events although the greenback slightly benefits from a subdued tone in its counterparts with EUR/USD stuck at 3-week lows near 1.1200 where a large option expiry for today’s New York cut resides. GBP/USD was pressured after Parliament rejected all motions in the indicative votes although Motion C which calls for a Customs Union only lost by a tight margin of 3 votes (273 vs. 276). Following the results, there was said to be increased cabinet consensus to reluctantly accept a customs union if PM May's deal loses during a final round run-off in indicative votes expected for Thursday, although others were said to demand PM May issue an ultimatum to the EU to improve the backstop or it will be a no-deal on April 12th. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is driven by risk sentiment, while antipodeans are flat with NZD dampened by weak NZIER Business Confidence and with AUD only briefly supported by strong Building Approvals figures as it bides it’s time on RBA and Budget Day.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower on spill-over selling from USTs as the positive risk tone continues to dampen safe-haven demand, while participants also look ahead to a 10yr JGB auction later.</p>",
