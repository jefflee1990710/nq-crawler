Risk<strong> </strong>appetite rebounded to start the week after the US Treasury issued a statement on the weekend to walk back reports that it was considering limiting equity flows into Chinese Cos and delisting ADRs. The announcement, alongside stronger than expected Chinese NBS &amp; Caixin PMIs, provided as tailwinds to major equity futures, particularly as US participants arrived at their desks, although held near highs through till the close. Progressive comments out of the Middle East helped ease the geopolitical risk premium in the crude complex, which underperformed. The T-Note had a rangebound session, in the short end, the Fed’s latest O/N repo was undersubscribed and the Fed announced it would be cutting back its offering to USD 75bln from USD 100bln for Tuesday’s operation.</p><p><strong>* CHINA PORTFOLIO FLOWS: </strong>In a carefully worded response, a US Treasury official said there were \"no current plans\" to limit US investments in Chinese companies or plans to limit Chinese firms' listing on US exchanges. However, desks noted that the denial of the story was very carefully worded, and did not rule out all of the options stated in Friday's report (delisting Chinese companies from US exchanges, imposing limits on investment in Chinese markets by US funds, capping the value of Chinese firms included in indices managed by US funds). While it could merely be a negotiating tactic employed by the US ahead of talks with top Chinese officials (scheduled for 10/11 October), and there could be legal challenges that prevent such a policy from becoming a reality, SocGen said that the caveat that \"no current plans\" can be seen as a warning to investors, and signal that considerations to open a new front in the trade war must not be taken lightly. Friday's report also comes amid last week's reports that the US might not extend temporary waivers for US companies to continue supply China telecoms giant Huawei. Reports have previously suggested that, at the request of China, Trump delayed boosting tariffs from 25% to 30%, which were due to kick on on 1st October, until the 15th October; next week's talks will, no doubt, be key in determining whether the US will go ahead with that plan.</p><p><strong>* CHINA MANUFACTURING PMI:</strong> Both the NBS (official) and Caixin (unofficial) PMI data beat expectations, with the former coming in at 49.8 in September (fifth consecutive sub-50 headline), from 49.5, which also stood as the consensus expectation; the latter to 51.4 in September, from 50.4, versus consensus 50.2. For the official data, new orders rose above 50, and although new export orders index increased, it remains below the 50.0 mark; the imports sub-index ticked up by a smaller magnitude. Pantheon Macroeconomics said it was possible that the Caixin gauge is picking up something that the official version is missing: \"The Caixin PMI is more weighted towards smaller and private firms. On our reading of the industrial profits data in recent months, private firms appear to be recovering while state-owned enterprises remain in the doldrums. We aren’t convinced, however, that the private sector recovery is sustainable yet; monetary conditions remain too tight.\" Pantheon also notes that the details within the Caixin survey concur with the official gauge in terms of the trend of new orders and new new export orders, though seem to suggest a less weak outlook on foreign demand.</p><p><strong>* CHINA NONMANUFACTURING PMI:</strong> While there was an upside surprise for the manufacturing gauges, the NBS (official) non-manufacturing data surprised to the downside, falling to 53.7 in September, from 53.8, below the consensus 53.9. Construction tumbled after the August jump, posing the question whether infrastructure spending will be enough to offset weaker investment in the private sector and a property market being cooled by policymakers (Pantheon Macroeconomics is sceptical). The services index picked up, though is off June's level; additionally, thee are some arguments why further downside could lie ahead: Pantheon points out that in recent months, the Caixin services PMI has weakened to the low side of its wide range of the past couple of years, while weakness in manufacturing will likely also prove a drag.</p><p><strong>* CHICAGO PMI: </strong>The headline came in at 47.1 in September, missing the consensus 50.2, and falling from the prior 50.4. Many desks had noted that August's rise was always a little chunky and had expected some correction in today's data. \"The index tends to run a few points below the national ISM index, and the September reading is consistent with a modest increase in the ISM to about 50, from 49.1 in August,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said. Looking ahead, the consultancy says that under normal circumstances, \"the rebound in China’s Caixin PMI would point clearly to a rebound in the Chicago PMI and ISM surveys, but the trade war has forced a substantial wedge between the state of China’s manufacturing business and that of its US equivalent.\" Pantheon argues that it would be surprised to see substantial further downside in the US numbers, but a recovery does not seem to be in the cards yet, given the absence of any meaningful progress towards a trade deal, and the widening of the tariff net.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN CPI: </strong>German<strong> </strong>CPI was unchanged in September (expected rise of 0.1% M/M), and the Y/Y rate edged lower to 1.2% (from 1.4%, expected 1.3%); the harmonised measure declined by 0.1% M/M, matching the pace of the prior, and the harmonised Y/Y figure fell to 0.9% from 1.0%. \"German headline inflation is losing more momentum,\" ING says, \"and seems to be on its way to what ECB President Draghi would call a re-anchoring at lower levels.\" The downside was a result of lower food and energy prices. ING notes, however, that where the data is available, core inflation measures remained relatively stable.</p><p><strong>* RBA PREVIEW: </strong>There is just shy of an 80% probability that the RBA will cut its cash rate by 25bps to 0.75% at the conclusion of its policy meeting overnight. Recently, analysts have noted that, while unemployment has ticked up, the RBA is now only two or three cuts away from the ZLB, so will want to use the rate channel carefully, until it has decided what and how other extraordinary measures (QE) can be employed. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22889/download\">Click here to read full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Outgoing President Draghi in an FT interview once again called on fiscal authorities to up efforts, warning that extraordinary monetary stimulus would be here to stay without fiscal support, and monetary policy would work only slowly, with side effects. Analysts said Draghi's interview showed 1) Draghi's acknowledges the reduced efficacy of monetary policy, 2) the suggestion of policy coordination - this is a debate that will be heard more in the months ahead, with potentially significant implications. ECB's Visco on the weekend said recent expansionary measures were necessary to counter the risk of a return to deflation, adding that the the ECB must counter the significant risk that the economic slowdown and the low level of inflation translate into a permanent reduction in inflation expectations, or a re-emergence of the threat of deflation.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 1.84 LOWER AT USD 54.07/BBL; BRENT (Z9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 1.13 LOWER AT USD 60.78/BBL: </strong>Crude<strong> </strong>benchmarks drifted lower throughout the session amidst a combination of Saudi supply reassurances, easing Middle East tension and month-end factors at play. OPEC's Secretary General said that Saudi Arabia has restored production back to levels seen before attacks on oil facilities in mid-September. While oil prices have given back gains in wake of the attack on Saudi energy facilities on 14th September, desks are again warning of complacency. The Saudi's have used spare capacity in other parts of the country that were not affected by the strikes to raise output, and the speed of the response might suggest it has used all available spare capacity, leaving the nation's supply vulnerable to future attacks, especially in light of weekend news where Houthi rebels reportedly have captured a number of Saudi soldiers in an attack (note: rebels announced the unconditional release of 350 prisoners, including three Saudi Arabians, days after the Yemeni group claimed to have captured thousands of Saudi troops following an incursion into Saudi Arabia, according to Houthi-run Al Masirah TV). The latest OPEC survey indicated its September oil output declining 750k BPD M/M to 28.9mln BPD; Saudi production seen falling 700k BPD to average 9.05mln BPD; Iraq lowers production after pledge to boost compliance; Nigeria raises output slightly. The latest US energy inventory expectations (barrels) see crude stocks +1.1mln bbls, distillates -1.7mln bbls and gasoline +1mln bbls.</p><p><strong>*US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 2+ LOWER AT 130-10: </strong>The<strong> </strong>T-Note<strong> </strong>pared losses throughout the US session, after a sell-off prior to the European equity open following stronger than expected Chinese PMIs and a White House pushback on a financial trade war, although a stronger greenback and disappointing Chicago PMI gave way to the bid; quarter-end flows/factors were also in the backdrop. By settlement the TPLEX was little changed with yields fractionally lower (<1bps).</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM Johnson has again pledged to take the UK out of the EU on 31st October and emphasised that he would not break the law in the process of doing so. There had been some concern that the scandal-plagued Johnson would ignore the spirit of the 'Benn Law', which would essentially require a request to the EU to extend Article 50 in the event an exit deal has not been secured by 19th October. Meanwhile, DUP leader Foster on the weekend said that her party would consider agreeing to the Irish backstop, if it were time limited (previously, the DUP's view was that even a temporary backstop was unacceptable); however, intraday, Foster stated that she never said the DUP would accept a time limited backstop, it said it would look at it, adding that this was a key difference.</p><p><strong>* AUSTRIA ELECTIONS: </strong>The conservative People's Party, led by former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, has won a clear victory in the weekend's general election, taking 38% of the vote (against 31% in his previous victory). However, the People's Party's former coalition partners, Freedom Party took only 17.3%, a sharp decline. Despite Kurz victory, he still does not have a parliamentary majority; his options include renewing the alliance with the Freedom Party (who were the source of the scandal that led to fresh elections) but others are urging he evaluate other options. A three-way pact with the Greens (which received 12.4% of the vote) and the liberal pro-business Neos party (7.4%) is considered far more likely than a grand coalition with the Social Democrats (21.5%), BBC reported, adding that coalition talks are widely expected to be difficult, and may last for weeks.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Over the weekend, Saudi Crown Prince reiterated the attacks on Aramco’s oil facilities were an act of war by Iran, however it would be much better to resolve the situation through political means, hoping military action will not be necessary. Following this, an Iranian government spokesman said they are prepared for dialogue with the Saudis if they change their behaviour and stop the war in Yemen. Concerns however remain, as Iran’s Oil Minister Zanganeh urged its oil industry to be on full alert against physical and cyber threats. The Yemeni Houthis claimed to have captured thousands of Saudi troops, following the Saudi attacks, although Al Jazeera reported that the Houthi rebels released 350 prisoners, however only three were from Saudi. Elsewhere, the US imposed election related sanctions on two Russians related to the Internet Research Agency by targeting 3 entities; 1 vessel and 3 aircrafts.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0.5% at 2977, NASDAQ-100 0.9% at 7749, Dow Jones 0.4% at 26917</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.8%, Consumer Staples 0.5%, Energy -0.8%, Financials -0.1%, Health Care 0.9%, Industrials 0.2%, Information Technology 1%, Materials 0.7%, Telecommunication Services 0.4%, Utilities 0.1%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) had its Pt raised at JPMorgan on improved volume forecasts, trading at the top of the Dow. Chinese ADRs (BIDU, JD, BABA) were outperformers after the White House denied reports from Friday that it was considering delisting them from US stock exchanges. Merck (MRK) traded higher after reporting strong survival rates from its ovarian cancer treatment, Lynparza, which it collaborated with AstraZeneca (AZN LN, AZN) on. Amgen (AMGN) opened on the back foot after disappointing data from its tumour treatment, AMG 510. American Airlines (AAL) opened higher amid a positive mention in Barron’s publication, who cited “take-off” potential provided Boeing (BA) 737 MAX returns; however, Boeing (BA) was at the bottom of the Dow following reports in the WSJ that its engineers bypassed safety procedures for software updates. Sempra Energy (SRE) was an outperformer on its USD 3.59bln Peruvian asset sale. NetApp (NTAP) printed losses with gratitude to reports Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS was developing its own network devices. Newell Brands (NWL) benefitted from an upgrade at SunTrust, as did Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) from an upgrade at Wedbush. Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP) traded lower after a downgrade at Citi.</p><p><strong>* AUGUST SIA SEMICONDUCTOR DATA: </strong>Total semiconductor revenue (Aug) -12.7% y/y, +9.4% M/M. SIA expects 2019 semiconductors to fall 11.8% y/y, RBC believe they are overly bearish, although they do still forecast a decline.</p><p>Segments:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discrete/Opto/Sensors: +6% y/y (20% of market)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analog: -8% y/y (13% of market)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Micro IC: +4% y/y (16% of market)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logic: -3% y/y (26% of market)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Memory: -36% y/y (26% of market)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The data showed total semiconductor revenues fell by 12.7% y/y, memory revenue fell by 36% y/y, which is in line with the average monthly y/y decline. RBC highlight that given the decreases they believe downside from now on will be limited and believe that NAND prices have bottomed. On Friday, following earnings from Micron, RBC also noted that the message they portrayed was that the NAND is improving, however questions still remained for DRAM. RBC adds if data centre spending returns to growth (the desk believes Q4 should be healthy) memory prices could rebound, especially due to the supply chain disruption which has been observed this year.&nbsp; The desk concludes “results were as expected while we continue to see declines in memory. We think we're at/near the bottom in terms of pricing and stick with our same view from earlier this year. Looking forward we'll focus on data centre and smartphone trends to provide a view into the health of end-demand in Q4.”</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: DXY</strong> traded above the 99 handle throughout the session seeing highs of 99.46 as it traded into month end. DXY currently trades off session highs amid a major US bank indicating a weaker buy signal signal, than initial estimates, for USD at month end vs all currencies aside form the Yen. Data was light today for the US ahead of tomorrow’s ISM manufacturing data, however the Chicago PMI came in beneath all analyst expectations, adding a potential headwind to gains in DXY. <strong>EUR</strong> traded lower to start the week following poor German CPI reading however it picked back up ahead of the NY cut where the cross held hefty option expiries at the 1.09 level. Havens on the backfoot today as US China concerns were put to rest as officials denied reports, they were looking to delist Chinese companies from the US stock exchange. <strong>XAU</strong> a notable underperformer as it falls beneath the 1500 level to lows of 1465; <strong>CHF</strong> also an underperformer as it traded lower against the buck, euro and pound. <strong>USDJPY</strong> also firmer today amid safe haven outflows and hefty option expiries at 1.08. <strong>Cable</strong> hovered around the 1.23 handle and headed into the Asia session relatively flat against the buck, despite UK GDP remaining in contraction and a worse than expected current account deficit. Sterling however found some support as it was confirmed UK PM Johnson could present the EU with a “concrete proposal” on Thursday. The antipodes traded lower with <strong>AUD</strong> awaiting the RBA rate decision overnight and <strong>NZD</strong> taking its queue following a poor NBNZ business outlook. The <strong>Lira</strong> outperformed its EMFX peers as it was reported the US is considering actively re-including Turkey in its F-35 programme and the updated central bank forecasts, who now see 2019 inflation at 12% (Prev. 15.9%), 2020 inflation at 8.5% and 6.0% in 2021, signalling a more normal economy as the central bank aims to reduce inflation back to its target of 5%.</p>",

OPEC's Secretary General said that Saudi Arabia has restored production back to levels seen before attacks on oil facilities in mid-September. While oil prices have given back gains in wake of the attack on Saudi energy facilities on 14th September, desks are again warning of complacency. The Saudi's have used spare capacity in other parts of the country that were not affected by the strikes to raise output, and the speed of the response might suggest it has used all available spare capacity, leaving the nation's supply vulnerable to future attacks, especially in light of weekend news where Houthi rebels reportedly have captured a number of Saudi soldiers in an attack (note: rebels announced the unconditional release of 350 prisoners, including three Saudi Arabians, days after the Yemeni group claimed to have captured thousands of Saudi troops following an incursion into Saudi Arabia, according to Houthi-run Al Masirah TV). The latest OPEC survey indicated its September oil output declining 750k BPD M/M to 28.9mln BPD; Saudi production seen falling 700k BPD to average 9.05mln BPD; Iraq lowers production after pledge to boost compliance; Nigeria raises output slightly. The latest US energy inventory expectations (barrels) see crude stocks +1.1mln bbls, distillates -1.7mln bbls and gasoline +1mln bbls.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar has lost some of its month and quarter end rebalancing bid as the final portfolio weighting from one prominent US bank indicates a weaker buy signal vs all rival currencies aside from the Yen that also had Japanese half fiscal year end positioning/flows to contend with. The <strong>DXY </strong>was also undermined by a much weaker than forecast and sub-50 Chicago PMI that hardly bodes well for Tuesday’s Markit survey or the official ISM release following a headline contraction in the latter last time, with the index pulling up just short of 99.500 after posting a fresh 2019 high at 99.463 earlier.</p><p><strong>CHF/NZD/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Franc has fallen to the bottom of the major ranks without much in the way of an obvious bearish catalyst, although the latest Swiss KOF survey was pretty weak and rise in sight deposits smacks of more direct currency action, while the Kiwi has managed to pare some losses following a deterioration in NBNZ business expectations overnight as 0.6250 vs the Greenback was tested, but not breached. Similarly, the Euro regrouped after hitting new ytd lows against the Buck when breaking below 1.0900 to 1.0885, as bids said to be sitting at 1.0880 were left unfilled along with decent option expiry interest between that level and 1.0870 (2 bn). In fact, Eur/Usd subsequently reclaimed the 1.0900 handle in time for 2.3 bn expiries at the strike, and with the single currency recovering from fix-related selling just under 1.0950 and a few pips above 0.8900 to sub-0.8850 in Sterling cross terms along the way, plus soft Eurozone inflation inputs from Germany and Spain.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling has outperformed G10 counterparts for the most part having survived bouts of early EU session selling, and irrespective of UK data that confirmed a q/q GDP contraction in Q2 alongside a worse than expected current account deficit, weak BoE consumer credit, mortgage lending and approvals data. The main driver seemed to be short covering/profit taking after recent Pound declines, but Cable may also have benefited from technical buying as MA support held below 1.2300 and reports suggested that PM Johnson could present the EU with a substantial new Brexit offer on Wednesday or Thursday.</p><p><strong>JPY/AUD</strong></p><p>Even though seasonals were apparently negative for the Yen as noted above, Usd/Jpy was remarkably sticky around the 108.00 level where decent option expiries sat (1.2 bn from the big figure to 108.05) and relatively rangebound within 107.75-108.10 confines, while the Aussie gleaned some traction from Chinese Caixin and official manufacturing PMIs before succumbing to pre-RBA jitters when 0.6750 was breached and Aud/Usd’s 3 week trough around 0.6739 was tested.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/TRY</strong></p><p>All deriving degrees of support from macro impulses, with the Loonie pivoting 1.3250, Norwegian Krona briefly crossing 9.8900 vs the Euro and Lira up through 5.6400 in wake of Canadian PPI, retail sales and trade data respectively. However, the Try was not overly impressed with the latest Turkish Economic plan, while the Cad and Nok had one eye on soft crude prices, while the&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>largely shrugged off Riksbank comments underlining turn of the year rate hike guidance as it meandered between 10.7330-10.6950 vs the Eur.</p>",

For the official data, new orders rose above 50, and although new export orders index increased, it remains below the 50.0 mark; the imports sub-index ticked up by a smaller magnitude. Pantheon Macroeconomics said it was possible that the Caixin gauge is picking up something that the official version is missing: \"The Caixin PMI is more weighted towards smaller and private firms. On our reading of the industrial profits data in recent months, private firms appear to be recovering while state-owned enterprises remain in the doldrums. We aren’t convinced, however, that the private sector recovery is sustainable yet; monetary conditions remain too tight.\" Pantheon also notes that the details within the Caixin survey concur with the official gauge in terms of the trend of new orders and new new export orders, though seem to suggest a less weak outlook on foreign demand.</p><p><strong>CHINA NON-MANUFACTURING PMI:</strong> While there was an upside surprise for the manufacturing gauges, the NBS (official) non-manufacturing data surprised to the downside, falling to 53.7 in September, from 53.8, below the consensus 53.9. Construction tumbled after the August jump, posing the question whether infrastructure spending will be enough to offset weaker investment in the private sector and a property market being cooled by policymakers (Pantheon Macroeconomics is sceptical). The services index picked up, though is off June's level; additionally, the are some arguments why further downside could lie ahead: Pantheon points out that in recent months, the Caixin services PMI has weakened to the low side of its wide range of the past couple of years, while weakness in manufacturing will likely also prove a drag.</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p><strong>Three House committees subpoenaed US Secretary of State Pompeo to supply documents relating to administration's dealings with Ukraine</strong>.

The sectors are mixed and unreflective of any definitive risk tone. In terms of individual movers; GlaxoSmithKline (+1.0%) are up on the news that the Co’s Phase 3 PRIMA trial for Zejula is the first study which illustrated a significant benefit, which, according to GSK, justifies the earlier acquisition of Tesaro for approximately USD 4.1bln. Saint Gobain (+2.4%) caught a bid on reports that the Co. announced the sale of their construction glass business in Korea.

Elsewhere, BBVA (+1.0%) is higher on the news that the bank may sell EUR 5bln of bad loans to Deutsche Bank (+0.4%). Finally, Whitbread (-5.1%) is under pressure after being downgraded at Barclays.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP -</strong> Contrasting fortunes for the Kiwi and Pound at the start of the final session of September and Q3, as the former props up the G10 table in wake of a downbeat NBNZ business survey, but the latter shrugs off broadly soft UK data and outperforms in corrective trade following recent weakness. Nzd/Usd is hovering near the base of a 0.6303-0.6250 range, while Cable reclaims 1.2300+ status and Sterling also recoups losses vs the Euro after a test of resistance at 0.8900, but no clean break and a subsequent cross reversal down towards 0.8865. However, the Gbp is on tenterhooks awaiting further political developments and latest moves by opposition party Remainers to request another Brextension rather than risk a no deal departure on October 31.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK -</strong> Marginal divergence between the Scandi Crowns as in line Norwegian retail sales keeps Eur/Nok rooted towards the bottom of 9.9450-9.9180 parameters in contrast to Eur/Sek that is nudging 10.7350 compared to lows of around 10.7060 following recent disappointing Swedish consumption and consumer sentiment reads.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/EUR/AUD/CHF -</strong> All weaker against a generally firm Greenback, as the DXY holds above 99.000 in a relatively narrow 99.047-216 range, with the Yen paring gains between 107.75-108.00 and flanked by decent option expiries at 107.50 (1.5 bn) and 108.00-05 (1.2 bn), while the Loonie meanders from 1.3225-47 ahead of Canadian PPI data. Elsewhere, the single currency has faded into 1.0950 amidst soft Eurozone inflation updates from Germany’s states and Spain, but Eur/Usd may derive underlying support from a hefty expiry at the 1.0900 strike (2.3 bn) and the fact that the big figure fended off several attempts to the downside last week. Similarly, the Aussie is keeping afloat around 0.6750 and within 1.0740-1.0800 extremes vs its Antipodean rival on the back of a better than expected Caixin Chinese manufacturing PMI and with the jury out on tomorrow’s RBA policy verdict (full preview available in the Research Suite), but the Franc is lagging across the board after a marked decline in the Swiss KOF indicator and downward revision to the previous print. Usd/Chf currently just shy of 0.9950 and Eur/Chf is straddling 1.0850 with latest weekly sight deposits suggesting more intervention.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Bucking the broad trend of losses vs the Dollar, Turkey’s Lira has climbed over 5.6500 after trade data showing a smaller deficit and typically upbeat comments/forecasts from the Finance Minister, bar a sharp downgrade to 2019 GDP.</p><p>BoJ Summary of Opinions state BoJ must maintain current powerful monetary easing and momentum for hitting price goal sustained, BoJ can leave policy steady for now, must mull whether additional easing is needed, putting all options on the table. When considering the outlook for the output gap, inflation expectations, and various leading indicators of prices, the inflation momentum seems to be lost, and thus<strong> it is necessary to take additional easing measures pre-emptively. Besides additional easing, the Bank should strengthen its commitment and enhance further coordination of fiscal and monetary policy.

Additionally, following last Friday’s reports of Saudi Arabia agreeing to a partial ceasefire in Yemen, the Iran backed Yemeni Houthis reportedly offered to release 350 prisoners, 3 of whom are Saudis. Separately, an Iranian Government Spokesman said that they are prepared for a dialogue with Saudi Arabia if they alter their behaviour and stop the war in Yemen, following reports that Iranian President Rouhani had received a letter from Saudi Arabia.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>Major European bourses (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.3%) are mostly higher, but consolidating within recent ranges ahead of this week’s slate of important macroeconomic data releases, following a mixed AsiaPac session, in which sentiment was initially downbeat on recent negative US/China trade reports that the US was mulling China portfolio flows limits and the delisting of Chinese stocks from US exchanges; although there are no current plans to do so according to a Treasury Official. The sectors are mixed and unreflective of any definitive risk tone. In terms of individual movers; GlaxoSmithKline (+1.0%) are up on the news that the Co’s Phase 3 PRIMA trial for Zejula is the first study which illustrated a significant benefit, which, according to GSK, justifies the earlier acquisition of Tesaro for approximately USD 4.1bln. Saint Gobain (+2.4%) caught a bid on reports that the Co. announced the sale of their construction glass business in Korea. Separately, Ab InBev (-0.2%) are lower, despite the co’s APAC Budweiser unit opening at HKD 27.40/shr, which is above the initial IPO price of HKD 27.0/shr, before extending gains to over 28.0/shr. Elsewhere, BBVA (+1.0%) is higher on the news that the bank may sell EUR 5bln of bad loans to Deutsche Bank (+0.4%). Finally, Whitbread (-5.1%) is under pressure after being downgraded at Barclays.</p><p>FX</p><p>NZD/GBP - Contrasting fortunes for the Kiwi and Pound at the start of the final session of September and Q3, as the former props up the G10 table in wake of a downbeat NBNZ business survey, but the latter shrugs off broadly soft UK data and outperforms in corrective trade following recent weakness. Nzd/Usd is hovering near the base of a 0.6303-0.6250 range, while Cable reclaims 1.2300+ status and Sterling also recoups losses vs the Euro after a test of resistance at 0.8900, but no clean break and a subsequent cross reversal down towards 0.8865. However, the Gbp is on tenterhooks awaiting further political developments and latest moves by opposition party Remainers to request another Brextension rather than risk a no deal departure on October 31.</p><p>NOK/SEK - Marginal divergence between the Scandi Crowns as in line Norwegian retail sales keeps Eur/Nok rooted towards the bottom of 9.9450-9.9180 parameters in contrast to Eur/Sek that is nudging 10.7350 compared to lows of around 10.7060 following recent disappointing Swedish consumption and consumer sentiment reads.</p><p>JPY/CAD/EUR/AUD/CHF - All weaker against a generally firm Greenback, as the DXY holds above 99.000 in a relatively narrow 99.047-216 range, with the Yen paring gains between 107.75-108.00 and flanked by decent option expiries at 107.50 (1.5 bn) and 108.00-05 (1.2 bn), while the Loonie meanders from 1.3225-47 ahead of Canadian PPI data. Elsewhere, the single currency has faded into 1.0950 amidst soft Eurozone inflation updates from Germany’s states and Spain, but Eur/Usd may derive underlying support from a hefty expiry at the 1.0900 strike (2.3 bn) and the fact that the big figure fended off several attempts to the downside last week. Similarly, the Aussie is keeping afloat around 0.6750 and within 1.0740-1.0800 extremes vs its Antipodean rival on the back of a better than expected Caixin Chinese manufacturing PMI and with the jury out on tomorrow’s RBA policy verdict (full preview available in the Research Suite), but the Franc is lagging across the board after a marked decline in the Swiss KOF indicator and downward revision to the previous print. Usd/Chf currently just shy of 0.9950 and Eur/Chf is straddling 1.0850 with latest weekly sight deposits suggesting more intervention.</p><p>EM - Bucking the broad trend of losses vs the Dollar, Turkey’s Lira has climbed over 5.6500 after trade data showing a smaller deficit and typically upbeat comments/forecasts from the Finance Minister, bar a sharp downgrade to 2019 GDP.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>No range breaks and less volatility following the remaining German state CPIs and UK data that largely missed consensus, but once again is overshadowed by the uncertain political/Brexit backdrop as the clock ticks down to October 31. Hence, Gilts continue to carry a no deal or further extension premium, with residual support from BoE Saunders and hold up better than bond peers that are all pivoting round numbers, at 134.00, 174.00 and 130-00 in the respective 10 year futures approaching the end of the month, Q3 and Japanese fiscal half year, with Chinese holidays, PMIs and NFP all due as the last quarter of 2019 kicks off.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Crude futures</strong> are lower, but well within recent ranges, as the market mostly shrugs off recent news flow; Russian oil output for the month of September is lower than in August, according to sources, at 11.24mln BDP (vs 11.29mln BDP). Additionally, following last Friday’s reports of Saudi Arabia agreeing to a partial ceasefire in Yemen, the Iran backed Yemeni Houthis reportedly offered to release 350 prisoners, 3 of whom are Saudis. Separately, an Iranian Government Spokesman said that they are prepared for a dialogue with Saudi Arabia if they alter their behaviour and stop the war in Yemen, following reports that Iranian President Rouhani had received a letter from Saudi Arabia. Spot <strong>Gold</strong> is lower, in line with the modestly better risk tone, and is back below the USD 1500/oz mark, an area which has been a solid base since mid-August. Separately, <strong>Copper </strong>prices are higher, after Chinese Caixin Manufacturing surprised to the upside, easing demand concerns in the red metals biggest market, although some of the forward-looking sub-components were more disappointing</p>",

        "content": "<p>Nomura says global stock market sentiment appears to be undergoing a spontaneous cooldown, that the bank’s model sees lasting from 20 September until 9 October. Cyclically speaking, the banks suggests, this cooldown may make the market react more strongly to negative news.</p><p>Nomura observes that, as the risk rally has abated, trend-chasing CTAs have reduced the pace of their net buying of equity futures. Equity indices have recently moved down towards the breakeven lines that the bank’s model estimate exist at around 2,970 for the S&amp;P 500, 26,680 for the DJIA, and 12,300 for the DAX, which has taken some of the momentum behind CTA buying. Moreover, the bank argues that CTAs are already exiting long positions in NASDAQ 100 futures, seeing as the index has now fallen below the trigger line that they estimate exists at around 7,750. With other hedge funds buying stocks at a slower pace now, they think conditions could soon prompt CTAs to begin paring their net long positions in S&amp;P 500 futures and DJIA futures. In addition, the bank argues that conditions are conducive to profit-taking on equity longs by major short-term traders (CTAs and global macro hedge funds). “Global macro hedge funds are… closing out short positions in US bonds. For now at least, it seems that they are hitting the reset button on trades they had made premised on a rising stock market and rising bond yields”.</p><p>Taking a broader view; Nomura found a pattern in the cumulative change in CTAs' relative exposure to equities and bonds for each year in the period 2009 until 2018; the average pattern in the total sample shows that CTAs tend to ramp up their buying of equity futures towards the end of each year. Based on the correlation between this relative exposure and the OECD composite leading indicator, the bank then split the data sample into high-growth years and low-growth years; in years in which the OECD composite leading indicator spent the first half of the year trending consistently downward (as is the case this year), buying of bond futures tends to pick up towards the end of the year. Nomura acknowledge that the stock market could easily take a more positive tone if progress is made in the US-China talks and a resolution to the trade war starts to look more likely, in which case, they would expect the stock market to buck the historical trend. Conversely, a failure to wrap up the US-China tension would make it more likely that CTAs' current buying of stocks and selling of bonds will ultimately amount to no more than a seasonal phenomenon.</p>",

OVP will now start coalition talks regarding with whom to govern over the next 5 years. OVP’s former coalition partner SPO took a hit in the polls, getting around 22%, and look set to lose roughly 20 seats, while support for the right-wing populists FPO fell to 16%. The Greens, conversely, made a comeback, bouncing back to win 14% of the vote after its worst performance in two decades in the 2017 election. Postal votes, which make up 17% of the total, are yet to be counted, but are unlikely to change anything at the top given Kurz’ large lead.</p><p><strong>* POSSIBLE COALITIONS:</strong> ING flag that the incumbent OVP may want to jump into the pro-climate movement by entering into a coalition with the greens, despite the fact that the party has greater similarities with the more right wing/populist FPO Party, with whom they could also form a government. However, OVP and the Greens differ in their stances on the EU, migration and the environment; for example, the Greens want a CO2 tax while OVP is in favour of CO2 import tariffs. Should the two successfully form a coalition; expect more climate-focused investments, say ING. After the 2002 elections, OVP held lengthy discussions with the Greens but failed to form a coalition and ended up in a coalition with FPO, and there is always the possibility that history could repeat itself. Should the end result be an OVP/FPO coalition, ING expect to see more of the same of what we have seen over the last two years, eg, some more traditional fiscal stimulus.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Volumes and losses have picked up markedly following a relatively measured and gradual retreat from opening Eurex highs, with market contacts noting stops on a break of overnight lows at 174.20 then more pronounced selling once Friday’s 174.05 intraday trough gave way. The 10 year German benchmark is currently just off a 173.77 base having breached chart support below 174.00 at 173.90 and piercing the next downside technical target of 173.84, with 173.59-57 holding for now. In terms of fundamental/macro drivers, German retail sales were better than forecast, like China’s headline Caixin manufacturing PMI, while US officials continue to backpedal on reports about restricting Chinese portfolio investments. However, weak Eurozone inflation data and an indifferent start to month/quarter end by EU stocks in contrast to UK debt/STIRs appears to have helped the core bond stop the rot for now at least.</p>",

Meanwhile, <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.5%)</strong> was subdued throughout the session as heavyweight Softbank fell over 2% amid the ongoing concerns surrounding WeWork after CEO Neumann left his position following the failed IPO. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.4%)</strong> nursed the initial losses which emanated from continuing disarray in Hong Kong as protesters clash with police for yet another week, with further protests planned for China’s 70th anniversary of Communist rule tomorrow. Losses in Hong Kong later pared amid gains in large-cap energy names and as AB InBev’s Budweiser APAC soared over 5% at its debut today, which was seen as a litmus test for the IPO environment in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, <strong>Shanghai Comp (-0.4%)</strong> received a short-lived boost after the Chinese Caixin Manufacturing metric topped estimates with new orders quickening to 18-month highs and production expanding at fastest pace since August 2018, signalling a recovery in the manufacturing sector. However, the index failed to hold onto gains as trade concerns weighed on the one-year outlook and new export business continued to decline. Furthermore, the PBoC skipped open market operations today which resulted in a modest net daily drain of CNY 20bln ahead of the Mainland’s absence for the remainder of the week due to the National Week Holiday.</p><p><strong>Reports suggested that the White House is mulling limits on portfolio flows into China, there is no timeline set for capital restrictions.&nbsp; Officials also considering delisting Chinese stocks from US stock exchanges but is unclear what mechanism the US could use to enforce such a policy. However, a US Treasury official stated that there are no current plans to stop Chinese firms from listing on US exchanges. Further, China Global Times noted that the listing of Chinese companies in the US is not just beneficial to China, but also to US investors and “after all, it is US consumers and investors that will bear the costs.”</strong></p><p>US President Trump said that patience is needed to ensure the trade deal with China is a great one.

Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> was uneventful under 108.00, albeit the pair remains above its 100 DMA (107.80) and failed to react to the somewhat dovish BoJ Summary of Opinions and optimistic Japanese Retail sales, although it’s worth noting today’s options at 107.50 (1.5bln) and 108.00 (950mln) ahead of the NY cut. Finally, the <strong>Kiwi</strong> fell to session lows on poor business data which showed a deterioration in business outlook, whilst its <strong>Aussie</strong> counterpart felt short-lived reprieve on the China Caixin PMI, albeit <strong>AUD/USD</strong> later pared gains and dipped into the red amid the cautious tone of the release and ahead of the RBA Monetary Policy decision tomorrow with money markets pricing in a 75% change of a 25bps cut to the Cash Rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>BoJ Summary of Opinions state BoJ must maintain current powerful monetary easing and momentum for hitting price goal sustained, BoJ can leave policy steady for now, must mull whether additional easing is needed, putting all options on the table.

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Hang Seng climbs off lows on Budweiser APAC euphoria, Kiwi underperforms as business outlook worsens",
        "content": "<p>Asian equities kicked the week off mostly softer following a negative lead from Wall Street on Friday in which major bourses fell deeper into the red amid reports which suggested that the White House is mulling limits on portfolio flows into China, however a US Treasury official later noted that there are no current plans in regards to this. ASX 200 (+0.1%) turned green as Nufarm shares rose in excess of 25% after the Co. reported an increase in revenue alongside the sale of its South American unit to Sumitomo. Meanwhile, Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) is subdued with the index weighed on by heavyweight Softbank amid the ongoing concerns surrounding WeWork after CEO Neumann left the post following the failed IPO. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch) nursed the earlier losses which emanated from continuing disarray in Hong Kong as protesters clash with police for yet another week, with further protests planned for China’s 70th anniversary of Communist rule tomorrow. Losses in Hong Kong later pared amid gains in large-cap energy names and as AB InBev’s Budweiser APAC soared over 2% at its debut today, which was seen as a litmus test for the IPO environment in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Shanghai Comp (-0.2%) climbed off lows and received a short-lived boost after the Chinese Caixin Manufacturing metric topped estimates with new orders quickening to 18-month highs and production expanding at fastest pace since August 2018, signalling a recovery in the manufacturing sector, albeit trade concerns weighed on the one-year outlook and new export business continued to decline. Furthermore, the PBoC skipped open market operations today which resulted in a modest net daily drain of CNY 20bln ahead of the Mainland’s absence for the remainder of the week due to the National Week Holiday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY gained some traction during the session following its retreated back towards the 99.00 mark in US trade on Friday. EUR/USD and GBP/USD remain flat under the 1.0950 and 1.2300 levels respectively, although the former rests between options at strikes 1.0900 (2.3bln) and 1.0975 (990mln) ahead of today’s NY cut, whilst the latter will be keeping a close eye on developments in Westminster as oppositions leaders meet today to find a way to bring forward the date when PM Johnson is required to ask Brussels for an Article 50 extension under the Benn Act, which currently stands at October 19th. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is unchanged under 108.00, albeit the pair remains above its 100 DMA (107.80) with little reaction to the BoJ Summary of Opinions and Japanese Retail sales, although it’s worth noting options at 107.50 (1.5bln) and 108.00 (950mln) ahead of the NY cut. Finally, the Kiwi fell to session lows on poor business data which showed a deterioration in business outlook, whilst its Aussie counterpart felt short-lived reprieve on the China Caixin PMI, albeit AUD/USD pared gains amid the cautious tone of the release.</p>",
