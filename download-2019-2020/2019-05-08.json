McDonalds (MCD) finished the session in the green, buoyed after reports emerged that the fast-food co. are to settle a long running dispute with its Indian business partner.

SPX -0.2% at 2980, NDX -0.3% at 7618, DJI +0.0% at 25968.</p><p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened in Wednesday trade, with most of the action in the belly. The complex started out the day on the front foot, underpinned by trade anxiety. And while punchy trade rhetoric and geopolitical developments kept a floor under prices, there was downside in wake of a weak 10-year auction, where the US sold 10-year paper in a very soft auction, which saw the largest tail since August 2017, and the lowest cover ratio since March 2008; indirects performance was also the weakest since April 2018, giving rise to the usual (unverified) rumours that China was staying on the sidelines as trade tensions gain prominence; a Jeffries analyst also suggested that the auction may have been soft due to the 10s complex coming so far so quickly suggesting there may be limited upside. A heavy slate of corporate supply was also cited as a reason for the TPLEX weakness. The US will on Thursday sell 30s, completing the week's supply; SocGen holds a neutral/slightly negative outlook for the upcoming 30y auction. US T-notes (M9) futures settled 9+ ticks lower at 123-24</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT:</strong> Equities down, Dollar up, Treasuries down, Crude up.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> US confirms Friday tariff hikes, China may retaliate, May to discuss future with 1922 Committee next week, US wants nuke deal with Iran, German IP data rebounds, weak US 10-year Auction</p><p><strong>* COMING UP:</strong> CH CPI Data, NO Rate Decision, US Initial Jobless Claims, US Wholesales and Inventory Data</p><p><strong>* THURSDAY’S EARNINGS:</strong> Europe; UniCredit, Deutsche Telekom, Rheinmetall, ArcelorMital, HeidelbergCement, BT</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>US President Trump is not backing away from his tariff threats, and the US will raise tariffs on USD 200bln worth of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, effective Friday. The USTR will establish a process to seek exclusions for certain products from additional tariffs, the filing stated. Trump declared that he'd be happy with an additional USD 100bln in the Treasury's coffers. US had accused china of backtracking on commitments made in trade talks; overnight, China state media reported that China will not make concessions in trade talks, with the contention seemingly remaining around an enforcement mechanism. However, there was a silver lining, the People's Daily said, and China still has \"full confidence\" that it can overcome challenges in the trade talks, which are set to resume on Thursday with a (smaller) China trade delegation, including Vice Premier Liu He, in Washington on Thursday. Trump also added that China is 'coming to the U.S. to make a deal,' and this was followed by comments from the White House Press Secretary that the US has received indication that China wants to make a trade deal. In response, China's Global Times editor tweeted that China is fully prepared for an escalated trade war, and it is a new strategy of China to engage in trade talks while fighting a trade war, adding that he believes China bets on the fact Chinese politics is more powerful than US politics, and the trade war will be decided by domestic politics eventually. Later, China's Commerce Ministry said it may take countermeasures on US tariff moves, adding that escalating trade frictions are not in anyone's interest, and it deeply regretted the US' plans.</p><p><strong>* CHINA: </strong>Ahead of the trade talks, data overnight showed China's trade surplus fell in April, with exports putting in a disappointing performance (adding further to concerns about global growth) while imports surprisingly put in a better-than-expected showing (which is a positive sign for China domestic growth, and confirming signals in PMI data).</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Pressure continues to be heaped on UK PM May, as cross-party talks fail to yet yield any breakthrough. Tory local associations have confirmed that they will hold a vote of confidence in UK PM May, to take place on 15 June. May was also reportedly told by Conservative MPs that she had until 16:00 BST to outline her resignation plans, and if she refused then the executive would have the power to change leadership election rules, which would essentially allow backbenchers to hold another confidence vote in an attempt to oust the PM. However, May's spokesperson later said that she will not be setting out a timetable for her departure, even if Brexit isn’t delivered, despite 1922 Committee's demands. It was later confirmed that May had agreed to meet and discuss her future with the executive of the 1922 committee new week, effectively buying herself one more week. Either way, analysts remind us that May is unlikely to announce her departure exclusively to the Committee, given that such an announcement is something that is usually made to the nation.</p><p>* <strong>GERMAN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DATA: </strong>Germany industrial production data rose 0.5% M/M in April, offering hope that next week's prelim GDP data for Q1 may have a more positive spin than recent survey data has suggested; the data was driven by rebounds in the construction segment. However, looking ahead, survey data still signals challenges ahead. German Q1 GDP is likely to be supported by inventory replenishing in Q1, after the drop in Q418. Goldman Sachs said the upside surprise is encouraging, and its economists have found that this report 1) is one of the most valuable leading indicators for near-term activity in the Euro area, and 2) has a high beta to Chinese growth, making it a key gauge to track China spill overs to Europe.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Barkin (Non-voter, Hawkish) said it is hard to have a recession with unemployment and inflation this low and that he sees the economy on a strong course.</p><p>* <strong>ECB: </strong>ECB President Draghi said that pressure on nominal wages is increasing while changing the inflation target can damage credibility.</p><p><strong>* RBNZ REVIEW: </strong>Going into the meeting, there was a 40% chance that the RBNZ would cut its OCR, which the central bank ended up doing, cutting the cash rate to a new record low 1.50%, and it explained that the move was based on concerns over slower growth is failing to lift inflation to target. Growth projections were cut: Q1 now seen at 0.4% Q/Q vs previous forecast of 0.8% Q/Q; 2019 growth seen at 2.0%, cut from 2.7%; \"This is well below the RBNZ's estimates of potential growth and so the central bank is forecasting domestic inflation to dip over coming quarters,\" HSBC says. The RBNZ now sees the cash rate falling to lows of around 1.36% (in Q3 2020 -- this forecast is a quarter average, and so there MAY be further rate cuts; another key development is the lowering of the rate path, which was lowered by 50bps over the horizon), and it describes the rate outlook as \"more balanced.\" But the RBNZ argued that its action will help support growth from H219. In his press conference, Governor Orr intimated that the Bank is now in a position to \"absorb the data\", which HSBC suggests opens the door to another possible rate cut, though the RBNZ's forecasts suggest that they might not be in a rush to do so (at the presser, Orr said that, for now, the RBNZ had \"done enough\"). \"With a strong near-term lift in economic momentum looking unlikely, based on timely indicators, we think the RBNZ's concerns over the strength of economic growth are unlikely to be assuaged over coming months. We expect one further 25bp cut in August,\" HSBC writes. Elsewhere, the statement also referred to downside risks in NZ's trading partners, which could also add to the case for looser policy ahead.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL: </strong>The focus was Iran, after the US said it would be imposing further sanctions on Iran \"very soon,\" and commenting on Iran's statement that it would dial back on commitments made under the 2015 nuclear deal, the White House said Iran's decision was akin to nuclear blackmail with Europe, adding that anyone violating sanctions on Iran will be found and held accountable. Additionally, the US said it would not grant any more sanctions waivers to any buyers of Iranian oil. The US did leave an out, however, saying that it wanted to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran, which if successful, will be presented to Congress to ratify it as a treaty.</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.72 HIGHER AT USD 62.12/BBL; BRENT (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.49 HIGHER AT USD 70.37/BBL</strong>. The crude complex went into Wednesday on the backfoot, catalysed by a bearish API inventory report and renewed trade war tensions, before reversing course later in the session following the official US energy inventories painting a more bullish picture. Prices were evidently supported by the DoE reporting crude stocks surprise drawing by 4mln bbls, a 1.2mln bbl build was expected and contrary to the API reported 2.8mln bbl build; gasoline stocks drew greater than expected; distillates drew less than expected; and the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub reported a build of 0.82mln bbls. The DoE also reported weekly crude production falling from its all-time highs of 12.3mln BPD down to 12.2mln BPD. Iranian tensions were still a concern, with the US’s Special Envoy for Iran Brian Hook reiterating the US’s hard-line stance; that the US will not grant any more sanction waivers for those who buy Iranian crude and subsequently adding that he believes the global oil market has already priced in Iranian oil exports falling to zero. It is worth noting that this bearish stance is expected from the Trump administration who is seeking lower oil prices.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.2% at 2880, NDX -0.3% at 7618, DJI +0.0% at 25968. SECTORS: Communications +0.1%, Cons Discretionary -0.1%, Cons Staples -0.1%, Energy -0.0%, Financials -0.3%, Healthcare +0.1%, Industrials +0.0%, Materials -0.1%, Tech -0.2%, Telecoms -0.4%, Utilities -1.4%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>EA (EA) opened higher after reporting earnings that beat on the top line and an upbeat outlook for the full year; TakeTwo (TTWO) moved higher in sympathy, despite a US Senator mulling a ban of video game ‘loot boxes’ and ‘pay to win’ features. McDonalds (MCD) finished the session in the green, buoyed after reports emerged that the fast-food co. are to settle a long running dispute with its Indian business partner. TripAdvisor (TRIP) shares fell as the company missed analyst revenue expectations. Western Union (WU) opened lower after the payments technology co. missed on both top and bottom line estimates. Mylan (MYL) was buoyed by a number of broker upgrades. Coty (COTY) dropped after reporting revenue that missed expectations. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) shares tumbled after the energy co. posted a surprise Q1 loss, despite beating revenue expectations. Lyft (LYFT) took a battering after the ride hailing co. reported Q1 losses significantly higher than analysts had expected. Zayo (ZAYO) shares jumped higher pre-market after news emerged that Digital Colony and EQT Partners were to acquire it for USD 35 per share. The utilities sector came under pressure as defensive stocks suffered amidst a strong day for cyclicals and following a spate of disappointing earnings from stocks including Atmos Energy (ATO), Dominion (D) and Entergy (ETR). Intel (INTC) finished the day with a flurry of volatility, initially moving higher on product announcements before reversing the gains to finish lower after the chipmaker reduced 3 year revenue guidance.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTES (M9) FUTURES SETTLE 9+ TICKS LOWER AT 123-24: </strong>The Treasury curve bear-steepened in Wednesday trade, with most of the action in the belly. The complex started out the day on the front foot, underpinned by trade anxiety. And while punchy trade rhetoric and geopolitical developments kept a floor under prices, there was downside in wake of a weak 10-year auction, where the US sold 10-year paper in a very soft auction, which saw the largest tail since August 2017, and the lowest cover ratio since March 2008; indirects performance was also the weakest since April 2018, giving rise to the usual (unverified) rumours that China was staying on the sidelines as trade tensions gain prominence; a Jeffries analyst also suggested that the auction may have been soft due to the 10s complex coming so far so quickly suggesting there may be limited upside. A heavy slate of corporate supply was also cited as a reason for the TPLEX weakness. The US will on Thursday sell 30s, completing the week's supply; SocGen holds a neutral/slightly negative outlook for the upcoming 30y auction.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong>; The DXY retained its bid tone (though we are almost flat heading into APAC trade) amid ongoing trade related jitters, with the most meaningful upside move coming in the aftermath of comments from the Chinese Commerce Ministry, saying China may retaliate against US sanction. <strong>JPY</strong> also benefitted from safe haven flows amid the ongoing trade uncertainty, and is consolidating around the 110.00 mark. <strong>EUR</strong> was on the front foot as German Industrial Output surprised to the upside offering hopes of a positive Q1 GDP print next week; the single currency has veered little away from the 1.12 area. <strong>GBP </strong>weakened as hopes for a cross-party deal faded (some suggests talks could collapse tonight) and pressure continues to be heaped on UK PM May to step down from her back benchers. The pair lingers around 1.30 heading into APAC. <strong>NZD </strong>was lower in the aftermath of the RBNZ rate cut, but quickly parred losses on upgrades to the Kiwi’s TWI forecast and Governor Orr erred toward a patient data dependent approach moving forward, though many analysts see further cuts ahead.<strong> AUD </strong>lost ground vs USD amid ongoing trade jitters, though seems magnetic to the 0.70 level.<strong> </strong>Conversely,<strong> CAD </strong>was also weaker against the USD, though did see a brief pop higher after housing data beat to the upside, and crude gained; trades flat around 1.3475 at the end of NY trade.&nbsp;</p>",

The complex started out the day on the front foot, underpinned by trade anxiety. And while punchy trade rhetoric and geopolitical developments kept a floor under prices, there was downside in wake of a weak 10-year auction, where the US sold 10-year paper in a very soft auction, which saw the largest tail since August 2017, and the lowest cover ratio since March 2008; indirects performance was also the weakest since April 2018, giving rise to the usual (unverified) rumours that China was staying on the sidelines as trade tensions gain prominence; a Jeffries analyst also suggested that the auction may have been soft due to the 10s complex coming so far so quickly suggesting there may be limited upside. A heavy slate of corporate supply was also cited as a reason for the TPLEX weakness. The US will on Thursday sell 30s, completing the week's supply; SocGen holds a neutral/slightly negative outlook for the upcoming 30y auction.</p>",

Prices were evidently supported by the DoE reporting crude stocks surprise drawing by 4mln bbls, a 1.2mln bbl build was expected and contrary to the API reported 2.8mln bbl build; gasoline stocks drew greater than expected; distillates drew less than expected; and the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub reported a build of 0.82mln bbls. The DoE also reported weekly crude production falling from its all-time highs of 12.3mln BPD down to 12.2mln BPD. Iranian tensions were still a concern, with the US’s Special Envoy for Iran Brian Hook reiterating the US’s hard-line stance; that the US will not grant any more sanction waivers for those who buy Iranian crude and subsequently adding that he believes the global oil market has already priced in Iranian oil exports falling to zero. It is worth noting that this bearish stance is expected from the Trump administration who is seeking lower oil prices.</p>",

In short, the pressure on UK PM May to set out a timetable for her tenure to end has intensified, and ahead of the next round of cross-party talks the bar appears to remain high for a compromise agreement even though yesterday’s discussions are said to have been constructive. Meanwhile, the Norwegian Crown retreated relatively sharply in wake of weak manufacturing production data vs a comparatively steady Euro as the cross hit 9.8370 from around 9.7800 at one stage.</p><p><strong>NZD</strong></p><p>Another major laggard/underperformer, but well off overnight lows vs the Usd forged on the back of the RBNZ’s ¼ point ease and more dovish rate path within a 0.6530-0.6605 range, as the accompanying statement also included upgrades to the Kiwi’s TWI forecast for mid-next year and Governor Orr erred towards a one and done stance pending data and economic developments after the policy meeting. Indeed, the Nzd also clawed back losses against the <strong>AUD</strong> as the cross reversed circa 100 pips from 1.0720 and the Aussie marginally extended its decline vs the Greenback to just under 0.7000 amidst ongoing jitters ahead of the next round of US-China trade negotiations – more on this below.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The broad Dollar remains underpinned, albeit not across the board, with the DXY near the top of its 97.611-409 range on the aforementioned heightened US-China tensions exacerbated by reports providing more clarity about the catalyst for recent events and President Trump’s renewed tariff threats. In short, an exclusive piece via sources suggests that China backpedalled on numerous legal clauses within the proposed trade accord, and Washington has now issued a formal notice for higher tariffs on Usd200 bn Chinese goods, to take effect from Friday if negotiations break down again (due to start tomorrow and end the next day).</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>All relatively/marginally firm vs the Buck, as Usd/Jpy pivots 110.00 and stays south of key technical levels, like a 110.44 Fib and 110.31 cloud base, but after a close shave with the latter on knee-jerk reaction to another Trump tweet confirming that Chinese VP Lui He will be part of the delegation arriving for talks. Usd/Chf was capped around 1.0200 and Eur/Chf straddled 1.1400, while the single currency was largely glued to 1.1200 vs the Usd amidst conflicting Eurozone impulses (better than forecast German data vs more Italian political scandal and expansive budget banter). Last, but not least the Loonie derived temporary impetus from a bigger than expected rise in Canadian housing starts to probe above 1.3450 before returning to the middle of 1.3486-46 trading parameters.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>More pain for the Lira and another 6.2000 test by Usd/Try as Turkey’s opposition party retaliated to AKP’s successful appeal to rerun the Istanbul election by insisting that if the mandate of ousted Mayor Imamoglu is revoked, then the Election Board must annul Erdoghan's Presidential mandate, so tit-for-tat. Conversely, the Rand unwound political premium ahead of SA voting that closes at 8.00 PM London/9.00 local), with Usd/Zar down to 14.3082 at one stage vs 14.4577 at the other extreme, and the Real also rallied on perceived positive pension reform political manoeuvres, as Usd/Brl hugs the bottom of a 3.9775-9285 band.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-1.2%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp.

Sentiment deteriorated as China reportedly backtracked on legal issues throughout text of proposed US trade agreement, affecting nearly every chapter. Furthermore, the sources stated that China looked for changes in the text of intellectual property protection and theft, technology transfer, financial service access and competition policy. Nonetheless, DAX (-0.3%) whilst in negative territory is modestly firmer than its peers, buoyed by optimistic German industrial output, whilst heavyweight Siemens (+4.7%) alongside Wirecard (+2.4%) also underpinned the index amid optimistic earnings, with the latter upgrading guidance. Sectors are relatively mixed with no stand-out out/underperformers. In terms of individual movers, Imperial Brands (-4.6%) shares fell despite optimistic earnings as its e-cigarette sales in the US were disappointing.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY - </strong>A relatively constrained 97.589-409 range in the index is fairly reflective of the tentative tone in currencies ahead of the pivotal and potentially game-changing talks in Washington between top level US and Chinese trade negotiators as sourced headlines intimate that China retracted legal pledges in virtually all sections of the proposal document. Looking at a breakdown of the basket, the Dollar is mixed vs major counterparts with the safer-havens outperforming in contrast to high betas, predictably.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD - </strong>The Kiwi has been the most volatile G10 unit for obvious reasons, with a swoon to circa 0.6530 lows vs its US peer and 1.0720 against the Aussie in the immediate aftermath of the 25 bp RBNZ rate cut that was rated as roughly 50-50 in terms of probability and was accompanied by a lower projected profile going forward. However, Nzd/Usd and Aud/Nzd have both reversed course rather sharply to around 0.6590 and 1.0640 respectively as RBNZ Governor Orr revealed in the post-meeting press conference and subsequent comments that the outlook appears more balanced than prior to the ease, with the Bank now inclined to monitor data as it unfolds. Meanwhile, Aud/Usd is sitting tight within a 0.7025-00 post-on hold RBA range and awaiting the SOMP on Friday in addition to the aforementioned US-China trade situation.</p><p><strong>GBP - </strong>Sterling remains vulnerable amidst the overall cautious risk environment and on Brexit uncertainty, as talks continue between the Conservative and Labour Parties, and while UK PM May battles to fend off latest leadership challenges. Indeed, Cable is now testing support ahead of 1.3000, such as the 30 DMA and a Fib (1.3036/1.3021), with Eur/Gbp nudging higher towards 0.8600 and the Pound not gleaning any support from firm Halifax house prices or decent BRC and Barclaycard retail surveys.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY - </strong>As noted above, the Franc and Yen are both benefiting from risk-off flows, as Usd/Chf retreats from 1.0200+ to revisit recent lows near 1.0170 and Eur/Chf slips back below 1.1400. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy is just hovering around 110.00 after breaching Fib and daily support at 110.44 and 110.31 respectively, and a dip to 109.90, with stops said to be sitting between 109.75-70.</p><p><strong>EUR - </strong>The single currency remains resilient either side of 1.1200 and 30 DMA resistance at 1.1224 vs Fib support at 1.1186 and lows seen earlier this week around 1.1160. A decent beat vs consensus in German ip has provided some traction against more Italian fiscal largesse.</p><p><strong>NOK - </strong>In contrast to the above, weak Norwegian manufacturing output has undermined the Nok and pushed the Eur cross back over 9.8000 vs Eur/Sek that remains sub-10.7500.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RBNZ cut the OCR by 25bps to 1.50% as expected with the decision reached by consensus</strong>. RBNZ said lower OCR is needed to support employment and inflation policy, while it added that outlook for employment growth is more subdued and that uncertainty about global outlook and trade concerns remain. <strong>RBNZ also lowered its OCR forecast</strong> to 1.38% for June 2020 from 1.81% and lowered September 2020 forecast to 1.36% from 1.88% but <strong>raised forecast for June 2020 TWI NZD</strong> to 72.8% from 71.9%. RBNZ Governor Orr commented at the press conference that he thinks the RBNZ are in a good position to observe data as situation unfolds and suggested that outlook seems more balanced looking ahead than before the cut. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>It’s not quite a safety flight (yet), but Gilts continue to head an increasingly firm rally and just hit 128.16 (+62 ticks), as Bunds reach 166.38 (+30 ticks) and US Treasuries 124-03 (+2+ ticks). To recap, renewed US-China trade tensions alongside ongoing Brexit uncertainty are prompting the latest bout of safe-haven positioning with the back-stop of a broad shift in global CB policy towards neutral-easing from normalisation. Technically, the German 10 year bond is now inching closer to 166.42 ahead of the 166.75 contract peak, while Gilts are approaching 127.21 before 128.37 and their US equivalent is just 1 tick away from the nearest upside chart objective. Conversely, the Italian benchmark has now fallen through its nearest support at 129.65 to expose 129.01 and then 128.50.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Choppy trade in the energy complex with Brent and WTI futures straddling just above USD 69.40/bbl and USD 61/bbl</strong> respectively amid the release of details regarding the deterioration of US-Sino trade discussions. The release of the a wider-than-forecast build in API stocks did little to sway prices in the immediate aftermath as the sector was overshadowed supply woes emanating from Libyan and Iranian tensions, Venezuelan sanctions and scope for OPEC to curb output till year-end.&nbsp; Yesterday also saw the release of the EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook which showed a raise in 2019 global oil demand expectations by 20K to 1.38mln, whilst 2020 demand forecasts were increased by 80K. Elsewhere, China’s trade balance showed that the country imported a record 10.7mln BPD of crude in April, +11%Y/Y and +15% M/M, albeit, ING notes that the strong oil numbers were likely due to heavy stockpiling ahead of Iranian waiver expiries. From a technical point, the benchmarks remain above their respective 50 and 200 DMAs (WTI: 60.95 and 60.75; Brent: 69.29 and 69.16 respectively, having formed a golden cross yesterday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gold (+0.3%)</strong> largely benefits from the safe-haven flows amid the step-backs in US-China trade discussions and as US are set to hike tariffs on USD 200bln worth of Chinese goods at 12:01 ET tomorrow. Meanwhile, copper came off highs after sources reported that China’s backtracking in talks affected every chapter in the trade accord. The red metal did gain some impetus during Asia-Pac hours as imports from China topped estimates. Finally, iron ore prices rose to near five-year highs on supply woes after Vale, the worlds largest iron ore producer, lowered its production forecasts for the base metal.</p><p><strong>US API weekly crude stocks (29 Apr) 2.81M vs. Exp. 1.2M (Prev. +6.8M).</strong> (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>Australia's Pilbara Port notes that throughput shipments in April have declined 1% Y/Y.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>Major European bourses have given up early gains [Eurostoxx 50 -0.3%] following on from a mostly downbeat Asia-Pac session, as sources released details regarding the break-down in US-China trade talks. Sentiment deteriorated as China reportedly backtracked on legal issues throughout text of proposed US trade agreement, affecting nearly every chapter. Furthermore, the sources stated that China looked for changes in the text of intellectual property protection and theft, technology transfer, financial service access and competition policy. Nonetheless, DAX (Unch) still outperforms its peers, buoyed by optimistic German industrial output, whilst heavyweight Siemens (+4.2%) alongside Wirecard (+2.4%) also underpinned the index amid optimistic earnings, with the latter upgrading guidance. Sectors are relatively mixed with no stand-out out/underperformers. In terms of individual movers, Imperial Brands (-4.8%) shares fell despite optimistic earnings as its e-cigarette sales in the US were disappointing.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>DXY - A relatively constrained 97.589-409 range in the index is fairly reflective of the tentative tone in currencies ahead of the pivotal and potentially game-changing talks in Washington between top level US and Chinese trade negotiators as sourced headlines intimate that China retracted legal pledges in virtually all sections of the proposal document. Looking at a breakdown of the basket, the Dollar is mixed vs major counterparts with the safer-havens outperforming in contrast to high betas, predictably.</p><p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi has been the most volatile G10 unit for obvious reasons, with a swoon to circa 0.6530 lows vs its US peer and 1.0720 against the Aussie in the immediate aftermath of the 25 bp RBNZ rate cut that was rated as roughly 50-50 in terms of probability and was accompanied by a lower projected profile going forward. However, Nzd/Usd and Aud/Nzd have both reversed course rather sharply to around 0.6590 and 1.0640 respectively as RBNZ Governor Orr revealed in the post-meeting press conference and subsequent comments that the outlook appears more balanced than prior to the ease, with the Bank now inclined to monitor data as it unfolds. Meanwhile, Aud/Usd is sitting tight within a 0.7025-00 post-on hold RBA range and awaiting the SOMP on Friday in addition to the aforementioned US-China trade situation.</p><p>GBP - Sterling remains vulnerable amidst the overall cautious risk environment and on Brexit uncertainty, as talks continue between the Conservative and Labour Parties, and while UK PM May battles to fend off latest leadership challenges. Indeed, Cable is now testing support ahead of 1.3000, such as the 30 DMA and a Fib (1.3036/1.3021), with Eur/Gbp nudging higher towards 0.8600 and the Pound not gleaning any support from firm Halifax house prices or decent BRC and Barclaycard retail surveys.</p><p>CHF/JPY - As noted above, the Franc and Yen are both benefiting from risk-off flows, as Usd/Chf retreats from 1.0200+ to revisit recent lows near 1.0170 and Eur/Chf slips back below 1.1400. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy is just hovering around 110.00 after breaching Fib and daily support at 110.44 and 110.31 respectively, and a dip to 109.90, with stops said to be sitting between 109.75-70.</p><p>EUR - The single currency remains resilient either side of 1.1200 and 30 DMA resistance at 1.1224 vs Fib support at 1.1186 and lows seen earlier this week around 1.1160. A decent beat vs consensus in German ip has provided some traction against more Italian fiscal largesse.</p><p>NOK - In contrast to the above, weak Norwegian manufacturing output has undermined the Nok and pushed the Eur cross back over 9.8000 vs Eur/Sek that remains sub-10.7500.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It’s not quite a safety flight (yet), but Gilts continue to head an increasingly firm rally and just hit 128.16 (+62 ticks), as Bunds reach 166.38 (+30 ticks) and US Treasuries 124-03 (+2+ ticks). To recap, renewed US-China trade tensions alongside ongoing Brexit uncertainty are prompting the latest bout of safe-haven positioning with the back-stop of a broad shift in global CB policy towards neutral-easing from normalisation. Technically, the German 10 year bond is now inching closer to 166.42 ahead of the 166.75 contract peak, while Gilts are approaching 127.21 before 128.37 and their US equivalent is just 1 tick away from the nearest upside chart objective. Conversely, the Italian benchmark has now fallen through its nearest support at 129.65 to expose 129.01 and then 128.50.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Choppy trade in the energy complex with Brent and WTI futures straddling just above USD 69.50/bbl and USD 61/bbl respectively amid the release of details regarding the deterioration of US-Sino trade discussions. The release of the a wider-than-forecast build in API stocks did little to sway prices in the immediate aftermath as the sector was overshadowed supply woes emanating from Libyan and Iranian tensions, Venezuelan sanctions and scope for OPEC to curb output till year-end.&nbsp; Yesterday also saw the release of the EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook which showed a raise in 2019 global oil demand expectations by 20K to 1.38mln, whilst 2020 demand forecasts were increased by 80K. Elsewhere, China’s trade balance showed that the country imported a record 10.7mln BPD of crude in April, +11%Y/Y and +15% M/M, albeit, ING notes that the strong oil numbers were likely due to heavy stockpiling ahead of Iranian waiver expiries. From a technical point, the benchmarks remain above their respective 50 and 200 DMAs (WTI: 60.95 and 60.75; Brent: 69.29 and 69.16 respectively, having formed a golden cross yesterday.</p><p>Gold (+0.2%) largely benefits from the safe-haven flows amid the step-backs in US-China trade discussions and as US are set to hike tariffs on USD 200bln worth of Chinese goods at 12:01 ET tomorrow. Meanwhile, copper came off highs after sources reported that China’s backtracking in talks affected every chapter in the trade accord. The red metal did gain some impetus during Asia-Pac hours as imports from China topped estimates. Finally, iron ore prices rose to near five-year highs on supply woes after Vale, the worlds largest iron ore producer, lowered its production forecasts for the base metal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

This was in in sharp contrast to yesterday’s rumours that PM May resigned which her spokesperson denied any knowledge of, and the government also suggested cross-party talks were constructive. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> broke below 110.00 as the risk averse tone underpinned safe-haven JPY and antipodeans were mixed with <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> pressured after the RBNZ cut rates by 25bps and lowered its forecasts for the future OCR path. However, <strong>NZD</strong> has since recouped the majority of the losses given that a cut was expected and the central banks raised its TWI NZD forecast, while some also suggested position squaring prior to the Chinese data and RBNZ press conference where Governor Orr suggested RBNZ are in a good position to observe data and that the outlook ahead now seems more balanced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RBNZ cut the OCR by 25bps to 1.50% as expected with the decision reached by consensus</strong>. RBNZ said lower OCR is needed to support employment and inflation policy, while it added that outlook for employment growth is more subdued and that uncertainty about global outlook and trade concerns remain. <strong>RBNZ also lowered its OCR forecast</strong> to 1.38% for June 2020 from 1.81% and lowered September 2020 forecast to 1.36% from 1.88% but <strong>raised forecast for June 2020 TWI NZD</strong> to 72.8% from 71.9%. RBNZ Governor Orr commented at the press conference that he thinks the RBNZ are in a good position to observe data as situation unfolds and suggested that outlook seems more balanced looking ahead than before the cut.

The US sold USD 38bln of 3-year notes, in a weak offering, which tailed by 0.7bps, and cover a touch softer than recent averages; direct bidders ended-up taking their largest share of a 3s auction since 2014.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are negative across the board as ongoing US-China trade uncertainty continues to take its toll on risk sentiment which resulted to heavy losses on Wall St and underperformance in the trade-sensitive sectors such as tech, industrials and materials, while looming Chinese trade data further adds to the cautiousness. ASX 200 (-0.4%) is led lower by weakness in tech, as well as disappointing corporate updates including CSR which missed on FY earnings and with Treasury Wine Estates shares down by around 6% after a US hedge fund suggested the Co. was overvalued by more than 50% and was conducting practices to inflate its sales figures. Nikkei 225 (-1.5%) is weighed by currency strength and with index heavyweight Fast Retailing subdued after a decline in April same store sales. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) conform to the downbeat tone due to the US-China trade tensions despite confirmation that Premier Liu He will travel to Washington for trade talks this week, as some reports noted the possibility of an escalation is seriously increasing and with Chinese media also suggesting China is not afraid to fight and will do so if necessary.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY eased back below the 97.50 level overnight amid mixed trade in its major counterparts in which EUR/USD just about reclaimed the 1.1200 handle to the upside, while GBP/USD rebounded from support around 1.3050 as the tone of the reports provide some relief with PM May reportedly to stay in office until the Conservative party conference in September after setting a new summer deadline to finalize Brexit talks. This was in in sharp contrast to yesterday’s rumours that PM May resigned which her spokesperson denied any knowledge of, and the government also suggested cross-party talks were constructive. Elsewhere, USD/JPY attempts a breakdown of the 110.00 level as the risk averse tone underpins safe-haven JPY and antipodeans are mixed ahead of the China trade data with NZD/USD pressured after the RBNZ cut rates by 25bps and lowered its forecasts for the future OCR path. However, NZD has since recouped the majority of the losses given that a cut was expected and the central banks raised its TWI NZD forecast, while some also suggested position squaring ahead of the Chinese data and RBNZ press conference.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are mildly higher due to the risk averse sentiment in the region but with gains restricted ahead of a 10yr auction later.</p>",
