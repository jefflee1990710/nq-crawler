Several favoured keeping rates unchanged, saying baseline economic projection had changed very little and that uncertainties would not derail the expansion. A couple of policymakers preferred a 50bp cut and stressed that forward guidance might also be needed. A couple said a rate cut might be too much insurance and could leave policy with less scope for future shocks. A few said markets see more future accommodation than they see as appropriate, might need to better align market expectations with their expectations. Generally, more concerned about risks associated with trade, geopolitics and global economy. Although readings on labour markets and overall economy is strong a clearer picture emerged on weakness on investment, factories and exports. Several suggested the consideration of an SRF as part of monetary policy. Few noted the possibility of resuming trend growth of balance sheet to stabilise the reserves. Policymakers agreed recent money market developments implied they should soon talk about the appropriate level of reserve balances.

Risk appetite was buoyed beforehand on earlier reports: China is reportedly open to a partial trade deal despite the tech blacklist, adding China would accept a limited deal as long as no more tariffs are imposed by the US, including the two rounds of higher duties set to come into effect later this month and in December. China would offer non-core concessions, such as the continued purchases of agricultural products, however the region would not give in on any sticking points such as IP theft and large-scale state subsidies. If these are not offered, it goes against the views of the US delegation who all want a large-scale deal, and not an interim one. The Chinese also reportedly offered to purchase an extra USD 10bln of US agricultural goods a year to ease the trade war as they further look for an interim deal - the 10bln offer will boost annual soybean purchases to 30mln tonnes from 20mln - the report also notes that Vice Premier Lie He is coming to the table with real offers and that the Chinese are ready to de-escalate, according to people briefed on the matter. Elsewhere, in response to yesterday’s US visa ban on those related to the oppression of the Uighur Muslims, where the Chinese embassy said it violates international relations and undermines Chinas interest, reports unsurprisingly announce that China may reportedly restrict US visas with anti-Chinese links. The initial US visa ban had nothing to do with the trade talks, the US has said, but the Chinese are sceptical.</p><p><strong>* FOMC MINUTES: </strong>Most policymakers believed a 25bp cut was needed due to the economic outlook, risk management and inflation objectives; several noted statistical models of recession in medium term increased notably. Several policymakers favoured keeping rates unchanged, saying the baseline economic projection had changed very little and that uncertainties would not derail the expansion. A couple of policymakers preferred a 50bp cut and stressed that forward guidance might also be needed, and on the flip side, a couple said a rate cut might be too much insurance and could leave policy with less scope for future shocks. Reminder, Rosengren and George were the hawkish dissenters at the September meeting, whilst Bullard voted for a 50bps cut.&nbsp; A few said markets see more future accommodation than they see as appropriate and might need to better align market expectations with their expectations; currently markets forecast 33.3bps (just over 1) of cuts by the end of 2019, and 76.8bp (just over 3) worth of cuts worth by the end of 2020. The FOMC are generally more concerned about risks associated with trade, geopolitics and global economy. Adding, although readings on labour markets and overall economy is strong, a clearer picture emerged on weakness on investment, factories and exports. On reserves, several suggested the consideration of an SRF as part of monetary policy; a few noted the possibility of resuming trend growth of balance sheet to stabilise the reserves, and policymakers agreed recent money market developments implied they should soon talk about the appropriate level of reserve balances.</p><p><strong>* SYRIA/TURKEY: </strong>Turkey launched an offensive, operation “Peace Spring”, into Northern Syria, following the US’ withdrawal from the region earlier in the week. The region is currently being held by Kurdish forces, who are holding thousands of ISIS forces. There has also been reports that the Kurds have fired artillery back into Turkish towns close to the Syrian border. Later in the session the Turkish Defence Ministry reported its troops had entered Northern Syria and begun their ground operations. The Turkish offensive has sparked international condemnation, with the UK, France and Germany vowing to call a UN Security council move. Earlier reports suggested that the attack had been coordinated with the Russians, however, a Senior Russian Lawmaker said that the offensive into Syria could be “construed” as a violation of Syria's sovereignty, adding that Russia is in Syria for \"different reasons\". US President Trump, who has faced widespread criticism from within his party over the decision to remove troops from the region, doubled down with familiar arguments, citing his desire to pull the US out of “endless wars” and arguing that entering the Middle East in the first place had been a mistake.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed Chair Powell spoke at a Fed listens event, mainly avoiding direct policy comments. Powell said the Fed's \"protection\" from short-term political pressure makes it important to \"clearly explain\" policy; repeats that economy is in a good place with strong job market, adding it is important to keep inflation around the 2% target so there is room to adjust policy whilst keeping expectations anchored.</p><p>* <strong>JOLTS: </strong>Job openings in August slowed to 7.041mln from 7.174mln, missing expectations for 7.191mln openings; marking a third consecutive monthly decline. Blackrock’s Rieder notes that this latest report raises the possibility that the measure has peaked for the cycle. The quit rate also fell, which Rieder sees as a signal of employee confidence in securing an improved work position as diminishing; the decline in vacancies to unemployed ratio for a fifth month also a troubling sign.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 13+ TICKS AT 131-09: </strong>The TPLEX drifted lower through the session as risk appetite improved in reaction to (somewhat) progressive developments out of the Chinese delegation, who showed interest in making some progress in talks. The September meeting FOMC minutes had a muted reaction on the Treasury curve with market pricing for future cuts little changed. By settlement yields were higher by 4.5bps across the entire curve. The 10-year Treasury auction held-up decent, stopping through the WI by 0.1bps and covered 2.43x, above the six-auction average of 2.38x, although indirects took a haircut off their average.</p><p><strong>* 30-YEAR BOND AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>US to sell USD 16bln of 30-year bonds on 10th October 2019 at 1300 EDT/1800 BST. SocGen's analysts, who hold a negative bias going into the auction, say the 30-year sector is trading rich in asset swap versus older 30s; the bank argues that demand has been falling in the long-end noting that seven of the last 10 auctions have tailed, while cover ratios averages have also been edging lower. SocGen says this indicates that investors have been staying away from long-end auctions. Additionally, 30s yields are currently trading near all-time lows seen in August, which may also turn-off buyers.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 0.04 LOWER AT USD 52.59/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.08 HIGHER AT USD 58.32/BBL: </strong>Energy markets sold off in the tail end after being bid all session - alongside major equity bourses - on the back of some progressive rumblings from the Chinese delegation ahead of the trade talks, in addition to Turkey’s offensive in Syria. Oil benchmarks were volatile on the EIA inventory data release as crude stocks printed a 2.9mln bbl build (less than the API report but exceeding the expected 1.4mln bbl build) alongside a 200k BPD increase in US production to a record 12.6mln BPD. The products were price supportive with gasoline and distillates drawing more than expected, although refining utilisation declined by 0.7% (exp. +0.3%) for a fourth consecutive decline, alluding to weak user demand for products. The geopolitical risk premium rose on Wednesday as the Turkish armed forces launched its operation “Peace Spring” in Syria, providing a new front for oil participants to monitor in the Middle East when evaluating supply risks. Elsewhere, OPEC has raised Nigeria’s production limit target to 1.774mln BPD (prev. 1.685mln BPD), although Nigeria has not been compliant with the supply cuts thus far - Reuters latest survey had Nigeria’s production at 1.95mln BPD at the end of September.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Early in the EU session, reports indicated that the EU was prepared to make a significant concession in a new Brexit deal offer to the UK; supposedly they would allow for the provision of a mechanism for the Northern Ireland assembly to leave a new Irish backstop after a number of years, with discussions for a 2025 timeframe. These reports resulted in immediate upside for Sterling. However, it was subsequently rebuffed as journalists highlighted that Downing Street has previously made it clear that they will not accept a Northern Ireland only backstop, which is essentially what this proposal entails. Additionally, EU sources noted they are not about to make a bold new offer and DUP made it very clear that the reported deal is a non-starter; they do not see it as an improved offer. Resultantly, Sterling reverting back to pre-announcement levels, and little has changed on the Brexit front. UK PM Johnson will be meeting Irish PM Varadkar on Friday, a meeting which is being seen by many as a last chance for the EU and UK to come to an agreement. Given the gulf between the two sides positions, any breakthrough is seen as unlikely. The EU has expressed willingness to grant the UK another A50 extension to allow for time for a general election/second referendum, with an extension until next June being touted. Despite reiterating a willingness to continue negotiating until the last minute, any incentive for the EU to make further concessions is weak given that UK law mandates that the PM request an extension should he fail to secure a deal by the 19th, desks note.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 0.9% at 2919, NASDAQ-100 1.1% at 7691, Dow Jones 0.7% at 26346,</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.9%, Consumer Staples 0.8%, Energy 1.1%, Financials 1%, Health Care 0.7%, Industrials 0.9%, Information Technology 1.5%, Materials 1%, Telecommunication Services 0.4%, Utilities 0.5%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Netflix (NFLX) were hit after PT cuts at both Rosenblatt and Moness Crespi with the former anticipating a Q4 subscriber guidance being more conservative ahead of competition from Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL), and the latter lowering its Q3 estimates and FY19/20 subscriber estimates due to a weaker macro environment and an “increasingly fierce competition”. American Airlines (AAL) traded higher; the airline announced it will extend the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX cancellations through to middle of January, expecting it to resume to service from January 16th. Following the move AAL, narrowed its Total Revenue per Available Seat Mile (TRASM) to 1.5-2.5% from 1-3% y/y. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) were lower after it has to pay USD 9bln in punitive damages in a trail over risk of male breast growth related to its Risperdal drug. Semiconductors (SOX) were higher today after TSMC (TSM) September sales increased 7.6% y/y, although note, M/M the figures did fall. LVMH (MC FP) reported its earnings after the European close where revenue beat expectations, noting EU, US and Asia performed strong despite the difficult backdrop in Hong Kong.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The news that China is open to a “mini deal” with the US, which triggered risk on during early European hours, saw havens come under pressure; <strong>USDJPY</strong> rose from the low 107.20s to just shy of the 107.50 mark, while <strong>EURCHF</strong> broke back above 1.09, before advancing to 1.0930. <strong>XAU </strong>was hit less hard and managed to hold within yesterday evening’s USD 1505-1515/oz parameters. <strong>DXY </strong>initially traded lower on the news sending the buck to similar lows seen yesterday, just beneath 98.90. The DXY clawed back initial losses throughout the remainder of the session and headed into Asia trade relatively unchanged; <strong>CNH</strong> was firmer against the greenback. <strong>GBP </strong>had its own roller-coaster journey, spiking from the low 1.2200s to just shy of 1.2300 on reports that the EU were ready to make a new Brexit offer (essentially a time limited NI only backstop) before retracing the entire move after the EU denied the reports and it became clear that, even if true, the DUP/Brexiteer wing of the party would never accept the offer anyway. In EMFX, <strong>TRY</strong> among underperformers as Syrian tensions escalate with operation “peace spring” underway, pushing USDTRY to multi-month highs. On the flipside, <strong>ZAR</strong> outperformed although failed to breach the 15.0 handle to the downside against the buck amid<strong> </strong>an improved business confidence data (92.4 from 89.1); <strong>MXN </strong>also firmer as headline and core inflation metrics picked up.</p>",

Oil benchmarks were volatile on the EIA inventory data release as crude stocks printed a 2.9mln bbl build (less than the API report but exceeding the expected 1.4mln bbl build) alongside a 200k BPD increase in US production to a record 12.6mln BPD. The products were price supportive with gasoline and distillates drawing more than expected, although refining utilisation declined by 0.7% (exp. +0.3%) for a fourth consecutive decline, alluding to weak user demand for products. The geopolitical risk premium rose on Wednesday as the Turkish armed forces launched its operation “Peace Spring” in Syria, providing a new front for oil participants to monitor in the Middle East when evaluating supply risks. Elsewhere, OPEC has raised Nigeria’s production limit target to 1.774mln BPD (prev. 1.685mln BPD), although Nigeria has not been compliant with the supply cuts thus far - Reuters latest survey had Nigeria’s production at 1.95mln BPD at the end of September.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY:&nbsp;</strong>The Treasury will this week auction a new 3-year note (USD 38bln, Tue), a 10-year re-opening (USD 24bln, Wed), and a 30-year bond re-opening (USD 16bln, Thu). Excluding SOMA holdings, there will be around USD 26bln of cash flows this week (around USD 24bln of redemptions, and USD 2bln of coupons).</p><p><strong>* 10-YEAR NOTE PREVIEW:</strong>&nbsp;Societe Generale's analysts say the 10-year sector has been set-up for auction from a relative value perspective, and argues that the current 10 trades fair in asset swap compared to previous 10-year auction cycles, though is cheap on the curve versus 5s and 30s. SocGen thinks that on an outright basis the 10-year part of the curve appears rich, with the current WI trading beneath all stop-out rates since August 2016. The bank also notes that the bull-steepening of the 2s10s part of the curve since the last auction cycles signals that, although the sector has cheapened on a relative value basis, it is expensive outright. Additionally, dealer holdings in the 7-11-year bucket is high, suggesting that the success of the auction will hinge on the participation of investment funds and foreigners. Finally, the bank says it holds a negative bias into this auction, though says that the fact that 10s trades special in repo might support demand.</p><p><strong>* RECENT 10-YEAR NOTE AUCTION HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>Tail: (Prev. -0.3bps, 6-auction avg. -0.5bps)</li><li>High Yield: (Prev. 1.739%, 6-auction avg. 2.072%)</li><li>Bid-to-Cover: (Prev. 2.46x, 6-auction avg. 2.38x)</li><li>Dealers: (Prev. 24.7%, 6-auction avg. 26.2%)</li><li>Directs: (Prev. 12.7%, 6-auction avg. 12.7%)</li><li>Indirects: (Prev. 62.6%, 6-auction avg. 61.1%)</li></ul>",

In truth, a lot of the early EU news revolved around Brexit and an apparent major concession from Brussels on the Irish backstop giving unilateral veto powers of withdrawal from the border arrangements that were given short shrift by the DUP before being promptly denied by an EU diplomatic source. However, broad risk sentiment was given another and more pronounced/sustained boost by reports that Beijing is amenable to returning from Washington with a partial trade deal and is pledging to increase its US agri purchases even though Chinese tech firms have been blacklisted.</p><p><strong>EUR/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The improvement in risk appetite noted above kept the single, Kiwi and Aussie elevated on the eve of the latest round of US-China trade negotiations, but Eur/Usd is still finding 1.1000 a tough hurdle to overcome if not an impenetrable level with major chart resistance protecting the big figure, like the 21 DMA and a Fib (1.0993 and 1.0994 respectively). Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd consolidated on the 0.6300 handle and between 0.6725-50, albeit both drifting from best levels as geopolitical factors tempered the general mood. In short, Turkey’s planned military operations in Northern Syria started and compounded Lira weakness with Usd/<strong>TRY </strong>edging up over 5.8750 at one stage.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A real whippy Wednesday for Sterling on the aforementioned Irish customs union claims and swift rebuttals, with Cable effectively back to where in began within a circa 1.2200-90 band and Eur/Gbp rebounding from 0.8940 towards 0.9000 awaiting further developments and acknowledging statements from EU’s Juncker and Barnier, as the former is not excluding a deal, but latter underlines that the situation remains in stalemate.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY/NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All weaker and somewhat out of kilter with the overall trend, as the Franc retreat further from recent lows through 0.9950 and Yen almost returns to 107.45 vs just above 107.00 at one stage. However, the Norwegian and Swedish Kronas are also underperforming despite risk-on flows elsewhere, with Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek extending gains on a mixture of negative technical, macro and Central Bank vibes to 10.0750+ and 10.9320+ before drifting back.</p>",

He judged that vulnerability in the financial system are moderate overall, and that households were in good shape.&nbsp;</li><li>Powell reiterated global developments pose risks to a positive outlook in the US. The Fed chair also noted that the policy actions were providing support to the outlook, reiterating policy is never on a pre-set course, and it will change as appropriate, taking meetings one-by-one.&nbsp;</li><li>Powell maintained the Fed’s language on the outlook that it will act ‘as appropriate’ to support growth, a strong job market and for inflation to return to its 2% goal.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NZD/CNH/AUD/EUR/GBP/CAD</strong></p><p>All firmer vs the Greenback amidst a broad revival in risk appetite spurred mainly by reports that China is still willing to negotiate a partial trade accord with the US even though Washington has blacklisted Chinese tech companies. Meanwhile, sentiment was also boosted on the Brexit front with the EU said to be preparing a significant Irish backstop offer to the UK, but the euphoria relatively short-lived given that the DUP reiterated its opposition to a double majority NI veto compromise regardless of any set timeframe and subsequent EU sources denied any major concession in the offing. The Antipodean Dollars are outperforming close to 0.6750 and above 0.6300 respectively, while the offshore Yuan has bounced from recent lows through 7.1300, Euro consolidates between 1.0950-90 and Loonie pares more losses around the 1.3300 handle. However, the Pound has been pulled from pillar to post due to the initial Stormont climbdown by Brussels boost and ensuing fall from grace on the rejection before complete retraction or blank denial. Indeed, Cable has reversed from just shy of 1.2300 back towards circa 1.2200 lows, albeit still holding above fib support at 1.2197 and Tuesday’s 1.2195 base, as Eur/Gbp remains capped ahead of 0.9000.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Understandably, the safe-haven Yen and Franc are underperforming in wake of latest US-Sino trade news, embellished by Beijing sweetening the mood ahead of talks with a pledge to buy an additional Usd10 bn agri goods per annum, with Usd/Jpy rebounding to 107.40 from a few pips under 107.00 and Usd/Chf easing back from the psychological 0.9900 level.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the overall upturn in sentiment and firmer crude prices, Scandi Crowns continue to depreciate on a combination of bearish chart and fundamental impulses, with Eur/Nok climbing further above 10.0000 and Eur/Sek crossing fresh decade highs over 10.9200 following NIER Swedish GDP and CPIF forecast downgrades.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Usd/Try also remains on an upward trajectory as the Lira braces for imminent Turkish military incursions across the border with Syria and investor/international reverberations. The pair is currently hovering near the upper end of 5.8455-8180 parameters after false reports implying that Turkish forces have already started operations, but troops are seemingly poised to strike.</p>",

Developments since weekend;</li><li>Over the weekend, a report alleged that China is narrowing scope for a trade deal with the US, with Chinese officials this week expected to come with an offer that doesn’t include anything on industrial policy or subsidies. The report noted that China see US President Trump’s hand as weakened due to his domestic impeachment related problems.</li><li>On Monday, separate reports alleged that China will not to budge on IP laws and government subsidies, which are key US demands. Moreover, the US added a further eight Chinese tech companies to its trade blacklist for their involvement in the persecution of the Uighurs.</li><li>On Tuesday, it was reported that Chinese officials were toning down expectations for the talks, with a source stating the delegation is already planning to cut short its stay by one night. Also on Tuesday, the US put visa bans on individuals related to persecution of China’s Uyghur community. China denounced the decision and said it would respond.</li><li>As such, this latest report appears in fitting with recent commentary, in that it suggests that China is not willing to make concession on issues such as IP, Industrial subsidies or policies. The positive reaction appears to be more related to the fact that, despite recent escalations by the US (the US had been refraining from attacking China over its treatment of the Uyghars until yesterday), China is still be willing to do a “mini deal”. Heading into the talks, market expectations have been set much lower by the recent negative developments, with participants looking for a something closer to a tentative truce. In that vein, a “mini deal” would exceed expectations, however, US President Trump has repeatedly insisted that the US wants a full deal.</li></ul>",

Elsewhere <strong>gold</strong> remained flat above 1500/oz whilst <strong>copper</strong> traded choppy after the red metal fell back below its 50 DMA (2.5850/lb) amid trade jitters.</p><p><strong>EIA cuts its forecasts for 2019 world oil demand growth by 50k BPD to 840k BPD y/y increase</strong>, cuts 2020 by 100k BPD and now sees 1.3mln BPD y/y increase.

Purchases of treasury bills to resolve the recent technical issues will not materially affect monetary policy stance.</strong> Powell also noted that jobs and inflation picture is favourable, sees continued economic expansion, a strong labour market and inflation near 2% goal as most likely outlook, reiterates global development pose risks to a favourable outlook in the US. The Fed Chair said the economy feels sustainable, no aspect is booming, and economy is not hot. Powell reaffirmed recent comments from Fed members, stating that the Fed will assess outlook on a meeting by meeting basis, policy is never on a pre-set course and it will change as appropriate.

He believes downside risks to the economy are stronger than the upside risks; consumer is benefiting from a strong labour market; he is looking for 2% growth in 2020 and is still optimistic on the US outlook, economy is good. Evans added that the repo-market pressures have now subsided and that the extension of operations to November 4th are helpful.

        "content": "<p>Asian stocks tracked losses on Wall Street which saw the DJIA decline over 300 points, as optimism surrounding US-China trade talks diminished further after the US imposed Visa bans on Chinese individuals related to the abuse of China's Uighur community, which the Chinese Embassy said undermines China’s interests. Stocks in Asia then showed a mild recovery amid an indecisive risk tone ahead of this week’s key risk events. ASX 200 (-0.8%) is pressured by losses in large-cap miners, whilst Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) is dragged lower by chipmakers following downside in US peers, although the index pared some losses amid favourable JPY action. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp (+0.1%) are choppy with gains in the Hong Kong capped by Real Estate stocks as the ongoing anti-government protests continue to impact the domestic housing market, whilst Mainland China is buoyed by industrial and machinery names on the back of favourable base metal prices. As a reminder, South Korean markets are closed due to a public holiday</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In FX markets, DXY climbed off lows but remain within a narrow parameter (99.08-14) after the Buck was ultimately little changed by Fed Chair Powell largely sticking to the script, which comes ahead of the Fed Chair’s final appearance for the week and the FOMC minutes later today. EUR/USD and GBP/USD trade sideways with little by way on fresh catalysts, whilst the latest reports notes of further potential Tory resignations over a no-deal Brexit. Elsewhere, JPY was initially firmer after the aforementioned US Visa ban on China soured sentiment, albeit USD/JPY recovered off worst levels after sentiment was somewhat choppy with the pair now above the 107.00 mark where over USD 2bln in options are to expire at today’s NY cut. Antipodeans are modestly firmer after initially seeing downside as Westpac Aussie Consumer Confidence fell to levels last seen in July 2015. AUD/USD remains sub 0.6750 ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6778, whilst NZD/USD is back above 0.6300 and eyes its 50 DMA at 0.6372. Finally, USD/CNH saw upside throughout yesterday’s session amid the seemingly deteriorating relationship between US and China heading into tomorrow’s trade discussions. USD/CNH reached a high of 7.1672 before drifting lower amid a stable PBoC CNY fix.</p>",
