Wang Yi added that he hopes both sides can take more \"enthusiastic\" measures and reduce both negative language and actions in the trade dispute, and that if everyone does this, talks will yield results in addition to resuming. Earlier in the session, China’s Commerce ministry announced the two largest economies were in close communications and are preparing for making progress on trade talk in October with the details still being discussed. The initial comments were market positive however gains were limited as a US official announced the US is unlikely to extend temporary waivers to US companies to supply Huawei which dampened market sentiment. US NEC Director Kudlow tried to boost the tone by showing the recent moves from china in commodity markets are very positive.</p><p><strong>* US FINAL Q2 GDP: </strong>The final look at US GDP in Q2 was unrevised at 2.0%, in line with the consensus; the core PCE print was revised higher, however, to 1.9% from 1.7%; Pantheon Macroeconomics said \"the key point here is that the new data make it even more clear that the very modest 1.1% increase in the first quarter was a fluke, triggered by a number of one-time factors,\" adding that \"the trend rate is near 2%, and we think Q3 is on course for 2.2-2.4%. The Fed’s new forecasts show core PCE inflation at 1.9% Y/Y in Q4 this year and next; those numbers are too low.\"</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's Clarida (voter) says rising wages were not putting upward pressure on inflation; inflation was running close to the Fed's target, and inflation expectations were consistent with price stability. Clarida also said neutral rates were falling, and this could limit the central bank's scope at the zero-lower bound. Fed's Kaplan (non-voter) spoke again on Thursday and stated that the odds of a recession within next year were relatively low, adding that he felt that the US could skate through a fragile period of global growth. Kaplan said that the repo problems seen recently show the need for more liquidity and were not a sign of broader stress; Kaplan stressed that the overnight funding market was running smoothly. Kaplan said he sees current policy settings on the margin of being a little accommodative, and he was agnostic on whether or not more cuts are required.</p><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 10+ HIGHER AT 130-09: </strong>After Wednesday's bear-steepening on trade optimism, the curve bull-flattened overnight, with desks suggesting the 'impeachment' story remaining influential and that Trump’s off-the-cuff remark on a China trade deal seems to be have been just that, lacking much rationale for the optimism. The US sold USD 32bln in 7-year notes, stopping through the WI by 0.5bps, a notable rebound from the prior 2bps tail; it was a decent auction, printing an above average B/C ratio of 2.49x, with dealers taking below average and indirects taking a chunky 65.2%. By settlement</p><p><strong>REPO:</strong> The Fed conducted both its upsized o/n repo operation and its 14-day term repo operation on Thursday, with the former undersubscribed at USD 50bln worth of bids (Fed had upped its offer to USD 100bln from USD 75bln), and the latter oversubscribed at USD 72.75bln (Fed had upped its offer to USD 60bln from USD 30bln). The NY Fed announced it would be maintaining the same size of its operations for Friday’s operations, again both the o/n repo and 14-day term repo. It is worth noting that as we head into quarter-end there is more likely to be season factors a foot in the money markets, putting strain on rates. The folks over at ING highlight that the SOFR/fed funds basis trade has become the new trade for rates, with participants betting on SOFR rising further higher and away from fed funds. The SOFR on Thursday rose to 2.01%, with the EFFR at 1.9%, remaining within the Fed’s 1.75% to 2% target range.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL:</strong> The Pentagon announced it is to deploy one patriot battery, four sentinel radars and 200 support personnel to Saudi Arabia and added that the US is looking for contribution from other countries, also; declaring additional material on further readiness for potential deployment, including more patriots and THAAD missile defence systems. Earlier in the session the UN nuclear watchdog announced that Iran has begun enriching uranium with some advanced centrifuges. Iran had previously announced it would use centrifuges to enrich uranium as another step back away from the 2015 nuclear deal, these latest reports support the claims. Elsewhere, US Secretary of State Pompeo said the US has concluded that Syria’s Assad government used chlorine as a chemical weapon on 19th May 2019, and as of such, the US has sanctioned two Russian entities for providing fuel to Syria.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 0.08 LOWER AT USD 56.41/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.31 HIGHER AT USD 61.74:</strong> Oil prices spiked higher – reversing its losses - in the late session after the Pentagon announced it was to send missiles and sentinel radars to bolster the Saudi defence forces. Benchmarks were previously on the backfoot on Thursday where they mainly tracked risk appetite across other markets (equities). Not providing any tailwinds was reassurance from OPEC Secretary General Barkindo that Saudi Arabia has almost restored output to that of before the Aramco attacks. Energy analysts at Citigroup highlight how prices remain a couple of dollars from their levels prior to the Aramco attack, which leads them to believe the market is undervalued, citing the baseline supply/demand deficit, Saudi production losses, vulnerability of infrastructure and potential for further geopolitical tension/conflict, although Citi caveats that it can’t ignore tape action and how the Aramco attack served as a selling opportunity.</p><p><strong>* US POLLING:</strong> A Quinnipiac national poll found that while more than half of voters disapprove of his job performance, only 37% of voters say that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57% he should not be impeached (the poll was conducted 19-23 September, before House Speaker Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry). 218 of the 435 House Representatives are required to back impeachment proceedings, and then two-thirds of the Senate, representing a high bar. There are concerns that the President may use diversionary tactics, such as ratcheting up pressure in Asia or the Middle East, in response.</p><p><strong>US 2020 ELECTIONS: </strong>Meanwhile, the Quinnipiac poll showed that Democrat nominee Warren is polling numerically ahead of Biden, though within the margin of error, the first time that a candidate other than Biden has had the numerical lead in the primary since Quinnipiac began asking the question in March. Traders consider Warren's health care policies would present downside risks to health care stocks since she endorses 'Medicare for all'.</p><p><strong>* EURO MONEY SUPPLY: </strong>M3 rose to 5.7% Y/Y in August, from 5.1% in July; some suggest this could mean that recession fears are overblown, given that the rise has been underpinned by M1, as overnight deposits held by non-financial firms continued to recover. Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that the M1 is unequivocally bullish for GDP growth in the next six-to-nine months, especially in H1 next year, but does concede that real M1 growth will be curbed in Q4 by rising inflation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 -0.2% AT 2978, NASDAQ-100 -0.4% AT 7772, DOW JONES -0.3% AT 26891,</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.6%, Consumer Staples 0.5%, Energy -1.3%, Financials -0.4%, Health Care -0.6%, Industrials 0.1%, Information Technology 0%, Materials -0.2%, Telecommunication Services -0.8%, Utilities 0.5%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Accenture (ACN) reported mixed earnings and traded lower, Conagra Brands (CAG) traded higher on its earnings report. Carnival (CCL) sunk today after poor guidance, however its EPS &amp; revenues beat. Beyond Meat (BYND) traded higher after McDonald’s (MCD) announced it would sell its ‘PLT’ burger in select Canadian stores, however gains were capped as Nestle (NESN SW) announced a new plant-based burger themselves. Baidu (BIDU) were higher as it sold it’s stake in C-Trip (CTRP) as it was looking to raise USD 1bln, CTRP traded lower. Whirlpool (WHR) benefitted from a broker upgrade at JP Morgan, as did Boston Beer (SAM) following an upgrade at BMO. Abbvie (ABBV) also higher after an upgrade at Citi. DXC Technology (DXC) were hit after Wells Fargo cut its price target in the name. Facebook (FB) won dismissal of an investor lawsuit accusing them of deceiving investors about the likely impact of a privacy breach on its stock price; investors will have a chance to refile their case. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) were hit after it provided poor data on its NKTR-214 in TNBC. Centene (CNE) were lower after it sold its Medicaid plan to Anthem (ANTM). General Motors (GM) strengthened in the later session on reports it was close to striking a deal, as soon as this week, with the UAW; Tesla (TSLA) was the other automaker to catch a bid after a leaked email from CEO Musk revealed optimism on a record deliveries quarter.</p><p><strong>BANXICO CUTS RATES BY 25BPS TO 7.75% AS EXPECTED: </strong>Move was not unanimous (two voted for a 50bps cut). Says balance of risks continues to have a downside bias, although economic activity in previous quarters remains stagnant, it is expected to recover slightly over the rest of the year. Marked uncertainty still persists about up and downward risks that might influence inflation. Says it is paying special attention to uncertainty, pass through of the exchange rate on prices, and relative monetary policy with the Fed. Says it is particularly important to maintain prudent monpol that encourages investment certainty. Reiterates it is necessary to attend to the deterioration of state oil firm, and sovereign ratings, and to meet fiscal goals. Noted uncertainties around USMCA passing in Congress.</p><p><strong>FX WRAP – USD: </strong>After the DXY closed above 99.00 on Wednesday, for the first time since May 2017, desks are questioning whether the USD is being supported by month/quarter-end factors, or whether traders are adding fresh longs (the former seems more likely, according to SocGen, given the increases in USD speculative longs has not correlated with EU/US rate differentials; additionally, the USD funding pressures seen in recent sessions may have prompted some to hedge positions earlier into month/quarter-end). There was some profit-taking reported in pre-market US trade, although the DXY made fresh highs in the tail end of the session.</p><p><strong>EUR / GBP:</strong> The single currency was subject to heavy option expiries, with 6bln expiring in EURUSD at the 1.10 handle, however the cross traded beneath that at the NY cut. EURUSD printed a fresh 28mth low at 1.0910 today as the greenback led the way, the cross now eyes the psychological 1.09 handle and a fib at 1.0864. Cable traded lower today amid ongoing Brexit uncertainties and USD strength, the cross found support at 1.2300 printing lows of 1.2303.</p><p><strong>HAVENS:</strong> USDJPY gradually rose throughout the session however weakness in the JPY was further observed in the tail end of the session following some positive commentary from the Chinese on the trade front. XAU traded just above the 1500 handle for most of the session however tested the level to the downside on the late session trade updates.</p><p><strong>Antipodes:</strong> NZD an outperformer today; Governor Orr spoke saying NZ is in a sound position to seize opportunities and manage challenges associated with low global interest rates, adding he was confident that rates will remain low for a number of years providing a great environment for investment. AUDUSD flat heading into the Asia session as support was kept in the currency from optimistic China trade updates.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> MXN, BRL &amp; ZAR weaker today against the buck amid broad USD strength. MXN saw some initial strength on the rate decision where rates were cut by 25bps but as some had expected a 50bp cut, the Peso initially strengthened however moves gradually pared back. BCB raised its 2019 GDP forecasts today however BCB stated that given the benign inflation outlook it should allow for further monetary stimulus; BCB cut rates by 50bp at their latest meeting. USDZAR higher today taking its queues from gains in the greenback with the cross trading in a 14.93-15.08. range.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BREXIT: </strong>Headline risk has returned, but as many analysts have been pointing out, little has ultimately changed; PM Johnson has dared the opposition to call a confidence motion, and subsequently elections, but the opposition have shied away, insisting Johnson must extend Article 50 first, as required by the 'Benn Law', a course Johnson has already ruled out. EU sources stated the chances of a deal have been described as nil, although Johnson carry’s on his usual tone that there is a good chance of getting a deal. UK MPs rejected a motion to provide a 3-day recess next week for the conservative party conference, however a spokesman did say the conference will occur as scheduled.</p><p><strong>* UK CONSUMER SENTIMENT: </strong>The YouGov/CEBR monthly gauge of consumer sentiment fell to 103.4 in September from 104.0 in August, the lowest level since May 2013 on increased worries about job security, the impact of trade tensions and political uncertainty will have on individuals' finances.</p><p><strong>* AUSSIE JOB VACANCIES: </strong>Data overnight showed annualised job vacancies declined 1.9% Y/Y in the three months to August 2019, the first annual fall since February quarter 2014. ANZ said that the falling vacancies in the last six months represented a convergence with job advertisement data, which have been weakening for some time. IT also noted that weakness in both leading indicators is a strong signal that employment growth could slow in the near term. \"This is concerning because unemployment has been rising despite strong employment growth in recent months,\" ANZ said.</p><p><strong>GERMANY GFK: </strong>While the headline rebound is welcomed (9.9 vs expected 9.6 vs prior 9.7), desks note that the series is not a good predictor of German retail sales or consumer spending. Additionally, the details were mixed, with 'expectations' and 'willingness-to-buy' up, though 'income expectations' fell.</p><p><strong>* RBNZ: </strong>RBNZ Governor Orr said NZ was in a sound position to seize the opportunities, and manage challenges associated with global low interest rate environment. The Governor also said that his current view was that we are unlikely to require the use of unconventional monetary policy measures, though he is confident that rates will remain low for a number of years, providing a great environment for investment.</p>",

Benchmarks were previously on the backfoot on Thursday where they mainly tracked risk appetite across other markets (equities). Not providing any tailwinds was reassurance from OPEC Secretary General Barkindo that Saudi Arabia has almost restored output to that of before the Aramco attacks. Energy analysts at Citigroup highlight how prices remain a couple of dollars from their levels prior to the Aramco attack, which leads them to believe the market is undervalued, citing the baseline supply/demand deficit, Saudi production losses, vulnerability of infrastructure and potential for further geopolitical tension/conflict, although Citi caveats that it can’t ignore tape action and how the Aramco attack served as a selling opportunity.</li></ul>",

It is widely expected to cut rates, with 14 of the 16 analysts surveyed by Reuters looking for a 25bp cut, taking the key lending rate to 7.75%; the other two analysts see a 50bp cut.</p><p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p><p>Banxico’s recent statement, minutes, and outlook reports have come across rather dovish, citing both a downturn in the global and domestic outlook, and hinting to an aggressive easing programme in the future. However, inflation has remained stable, above the bank’s target of 3.0%, and therefore, the bank needs to be careful not to spur inflationary pressures which will send CPI further above target; CPI has remained stable following the recent 25bps surprise cut.</p><p><strong>PREVIOUS MEETING/MINUTES:</strong></p><p>At the previous meeting the Banxico surprised participants with a 25bps cut taking the key lending rate to 8.0%, when markets were looking for rates to remain unchanged at 8.25%. The decision was almost unanimous, though one member on the board voted to keep rates unchanged, citing persistent core inflation. The statement cited balance of risks for growth is still tilted to the downside. However, inflation remained stable above the banks 3% target (Aug CPI: 3.16%), much lower than the December 2017 peak of 6.77%. The minutes of that meeting portrayed a very dovish message, that some members said the economic deceleration has been larger than expected, with one member describing the Mexican economy “on verge of a recession,” adding the current monetary policy stance is highly restrictive.</p><p><strong>FX:</strong></p><p>The prior statement mentioned that if the economy requires an adjustment in the real exchange rate, it will help this to happen in an orderly manner, in order to prevent any second-round effects. TD Securities notes that FX may be vulnerable should the Banxico’s tone sound overly dovish, adding, Peso performance has been stable relative to market-based valuation metrics, although it is now testing best valuation levels since May, due to easing at the Federal Reserve.</p><p><strong>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK:</strong></p><p>The latest economic outlook stated global economic activity decelerated further in the first half of 2019, with weakness evident in the case of both emerging and advanced economics. The outlook pointed out at sectoral level, industrial output (especially manufacturing) has been severely affected by trade tensions. Banxico highlights growth being hindered by external and especially domestic factors, with weaker domestic employment and labour costs increasing at a faster pace than productivity, and as such, cut its 2019 and 2020 guidance to 0.2-0.7% and 1.5-2.5%, respectively. Banxico expects core inflation to decline in the coming months, adding an achievement of its inflation goal in H2 2020 is feasible.</p><p><strong>FEDERAL RESERVE:</strong></p><p>The statement also noted it would continue to monitor the relative monetary policy stance of the US, where the FOMC recently cut rates by 25bp but, according to the dot plots, only 7 of the 17 board members forecast another rate cut in 2019. The close monitoring of US interest rate policies suggest Banxico will follow suit of its US counterpart, however, any future guidance will be of note; Rabobank forecasts a further 25bps by end of 2019, and 200bp by end of 2020, taking the rate to 5.5%. The bank does note that if the Fed were too continue easing, this may have to be adjusted. TD Securities see some risk that the market pricing forecasts may be too aggressive in the short term, however it remains dependent on flexibility provided by the Fed’s easing path.</p><p><strong>PEMEX:</strong></p><p>The Banxico’s latest outlook also highlighted concerns surrounding PEMEX, with doubts expressed regarding viability of reaching oil output and reserves; with markets participating additional downgrades to PEMEX; therefore any potential comments on PEMEX will be of note, however Finance Minister Herrera announced the government will provide PEMEX with USD 5bln to strengthen the financial conditions of the state owned oil company.</p>",

Last month's auction was soft, tailing and seeing the weakest cover ratio since 7-year auctions resumed in 2009. Meanwhile, the bank observes that the current WI is trading above last month's stop-out rate, which could provide support for the auction. SocGen also says that any quarter-end purchases, along with month-end extension demand, could also be positive for the auction. In terms of the bias going into the auction, SocGen says it holds a neutral view.</p><p>* PREVIOUS AND 6 AUCTION AVERAGES</p><ul><li><strong>High Yield:</strong> (Prev. 1.489%, six-auction average 2.033%)</li><li><strong>Tail:</strong> (Prev. 2bps, six-auction average 0.8bps)</li><li><strong>Bid-to-Cover:</strong> (Prev. 2.16x, six-auction average 2.37x)</li><li><strong>Dealers:</strong> (Prev. 33.8%, six-auction average 24.1%)</li><li><strong>Directs:</strong> (Prev. 16.1%, six-auction average 17.9%)</li><li><strong>Indirects:</strong> (Prev. 50.2%, six-auction average 58.0%)</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Index has faded earlier gains and is now set to end the EU session flat and just below the 99.00 mark after eclipsing recent highs of 99.10. Downside in the index coincided with the US market entrance. DXY is poised to end the session flat after having fluctuated within a 98.83-99.13 intra-day band ahead of its YTD high at 99.37. Data-wise, little sustained reaction was experienced after mixed final GDP, PCE Prices, initial jobless claims and adv goods trade balance metrics. In terms of commentary WH Economic Advisor Kudlow stated the domestic economy has reached a turning point back up, although this did little to influence the Index with markets still awaiting any details on the impeachment front. Tomorrow’s State-side calendar sees Core PCE, Durable Goods, University of Michigan (final), Fed’s Quarles (voter) and Harker (non-voter), albeit the latter will be speaking on economic outlook at the Shadow Open Committee.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NZD, AUD</strong></p><p>Kiwi remains the marked G10 outperformer and NZD/USD has reclaimed a 0.63+ status as the Buck eased, although the bulk of the support emanated from RBNZ Governor Orr who struck an optimistic tone on the domestic economy whilst highlighting that unconventional policy tools are not currently necessary, which is likely to have also influenced some short covering. Meanwhile its Aussie counterpart has been kept afloat from this European morning’s more constructive and less resilient tone from China’s MOFCOM. NZD/USD is on track to end the EU session near session highs having thus far fluctuated within a 0.6267-6327 range whilst AUD/USD is poised to end the session in the green having visited intraday lows of 0.6750 and a high of 0.6780.</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP</strong></p><p>Euro is set to end the EU session with flat and Sterling with modest losses. Cable earlier tested 1.2300 to the downside as DXY printed fresh weekly highs and amid Brexit angst as the UK PM remains resilient to an extension, whilst rhetoric from the EU is also less optimistic as most diplomats believe another delay will only increase the chances of no-deal in the future. Meanwhile, MPs have voted to reject a three-day recess next week, which would have allowed the Tories to hold their annual Party Conference, although a spokesperson noted that the conference will go ahead as usual. GBP/USD is back below the 1.2350 mark and its 21 DMA at 1.2346 having fluctuated between at 1.2300-80 intraday band. Elsewhere, the Euro was at the whim of the Dollar which saw EUR/USD at a fresh YTD and 28-month low of 1.0923 ahead of the psychological 1.0900 and a Fib at 1.0864.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>Again, influenced by the Dollar. The safe havens look set to end the EU session modestly firmer/flat. USD/JPY hovers around 107.50 and remained within am intraday band of 107.40-79 whilst USD/CHF climbed off lows of 0.9910 (vs. high 0.9950) but looks to end the session little changed intraday.</p>",

(-0.9%)</strong> were both underpinned at the open following the encouraging trade rhetoric from US President Trump who also stated that China is making large agricultural purchases and that there is a good chance we'll make a trade deal with China which is getting closer and closer. However, the advances in the region later waned considering Trump’s tendency to flip flop on trade discussions and as US impeachment concerns lingered, while the PBoC’s open market operations also resulted to a considerable CNY 100bln net drain in liquidity. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower following the bear steepening in the US and after the BoJ reduced its purchase amounts of 5yr-10yr JGBs for today’s Rinban operations.</p><p><strong>PBoC injected a CNY 20bln via 14-day reverse repos</strong> for a net daily drain of CNY 100bln. (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 7.0729 vs. Exp. 7.0947</strong> (Prev. 7.0724)</p><p><strong>Japanese PM Abe said US President Trump agreed the US won’t impose Section 232 tariffs on Japan while talks are underway</strong>, while Abe also believes the trade agreement with US will lead to further economic growth for Japan and contribute to the global economy. There were also comments from Japan Minister of Economy Trade and Industry Sugawara that he will negotiate firmly and get results in scrapping US tariffs on Japan autos.

Furthermore, Kaplan said the odds of a recession within next 12 months are relatively low and that repo problems last week show a need for more liquidity but are not sign of broader stress. (Newswires)</p><p>An adviser to Ukraine's President said President Trump's insistence for the two leaders to discuss a possible investigation into Joe Biden was a precondition for their July 25 phone call, while it was also reported the Whistleblower's complaint against US President Trump has been declassified and could be releases as early as Thursday morning according to sources.

(Newswires) Subsequently, Government sources are already conceding defeat on this afternoon's conference recess motion, according to The Times' Swinford. (Twitter)</p><p>Chances of the UK and EU agreeing on a deal being described as nil by sources in the EU, according to BBC's Adler. (Twitter)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p><strong>Major European Indices (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.5%) are higher</strong>, following a more mixed AsiaPac lead, as the market digests the latest trade developments; China’s MOFCOM sounded constructive, saying the two sides are “closely communicating and preparing for making trade talk progress in October” (reminder; US President Trump yesterday hinted that a deal could come sooner than we think). Moreover, a stumbling block for the potential US/Japan trade deal seems to have been averted; USTR Lighthizer said it is not the intention of the US to put tariffs on Japanese auto exports. However, on the EU/US front, the WTO look set to rule that the US can sanction up to USD 8bln worth of EU goods over Airbus (AIR FP) aid, sources said. It is also worth noting that Eurozone broad money supply increased more than forecast. ING note that it considered one of the best leading indicators for the eurozone economy, and as such, could be lending some support to sentiment (though EURUSD is just off YTD lows). Sectors are mostly higher, lead by Tech (+1.3%), and Energy (+1.3%), with Telecoms and Financials (+0.2) the laggards for now. In terms of stock specific movers; ABN Amro (-10.0%) shares took a tumble, as the company joined the ranks of other notable European banks in that it is now being investigated by public prosecutors over potential money laundering violations. Imperial Brands (-10.6%) issued negative outlook, expressing concerns over its next generation of products. British American Tobacco (-1.3%) moved lower in sympathy, and US tobacco names may not escape the session unscathed, not least given Imperial Brands specifically names US action on vaping products as resulting in a notable slowdown of vapour product growth. Pearson (-18.1%) sunk after the co. provided disappointing guidance. Wirecard (+2.3%) was bid premarket, after SocGen initiated the company at a Buy premarket. Ericsson (-0.7%) managed to reverse the majority of what was initially substantial losses as the broader market advanced, on the co. provided guidance for Q3 provisions in relation to investigations State-side, and sees costs at SEK 12bln. Finally, airlines were under pressure after IAG (-3.5%) issued a profit warning.</p><p><strong>Airbus (AIR FP) has reportedly been hit by a series of cyber attacks on its suppliers, with hackers searching for technical secrets, security sources say; a link to China is suspected. </strong>(AFP)</p><p><strong>Beyond Meat (BYMD)</strong> – <strong>McDonalds (MCD)</strong> are to test the Co’s new plant-based burger in Canada. <i>Beyond Meat are around 10% higher in pre-market trade</i>.

(WSJ)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY - </strong>Marginally firmer on the day thus far with the index topping yesterday’s high (99.06) in a continuation of recent strength, whilst an optimistic tone from China’s MOFCOM regarding October trade talks in Washington did little to stem the Buck’s rise. DXY has breached its 12 Sept high at 99.10 with its YTD high at 99.37. Next up on the docket State-side, the final metrics US GDP and PCE prices, weekly initial jobless claims and a slew of Fed speaks including Kaplan (non-voter), Bullard (voter, dissenter), Calrida (voter), Daly (non-voter), Kashkari (non-voter) and Barkin (non-voter). In terms of US politics, participants will also be eyeing the potential release of the whistleblower’s complaint against US President Trump in regard to the controversial phone call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, which some members of congress described as “troubling”.</p><p><strong>NZD, AUD - </strong>All firmer, with outperformance in the Kiwi following comments from RBNZ Governor Orr who struck an optimistic tone on the domestic economy whilst highlighting that unconventional policy tools are not currently necessary. NZD/USD reached a 0.63+ status overnight, albeit remains off highs (0.6310) at around 0.6290 after kicking the session off at 0.6270. Meanwhile, its Aussie counterpart remains buoyed by the optimistic US/China trade tone after the US President said a deal with China could happen “sooner than you think”, whilst rhetoric from China was remained constructive ahead of trade talks in Washington next month. AUD/USD trades north of 0.6750 with little by way of immediate technical levels in play.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR - </strong>Both softer on the day with Cable the underperformer amid a firmer Buck coupled with Brexit angst as the UK PM remains resilient to a Brexit extension, whilst rhetoric from the EU is also less optimistic as most diplomats believe another delay will only increase the chances of No Deal down the line, according to Sun's Nick Gutteridge. GBP/USD has tested 1.2300 to the downside after breaching a barrage of support levels between 1.2346-50 with the next level to the downside touted at 1.2233 (9th Sept low). The Euro is marginally softer, down from highs of 1.0965 due to a firmer Dollar as the pair moves closer to its YTD low of 1.0924. In terms of levels to the downside, below the psychological 1.0900 mark, the pair sees a strong Fib level at 1.0864 ahead of support at 1.0850.

Moreover, a stumbling block for the potential US/Japan trade deal seems to have been averted; USTR Lighthizer said it is not the intention of the US to put tariffs on Japanese auto exports. However, on the EU/US front, the WTO look set to rule that the US can sanction up to USD 8bln worth of EU goods over Airbus (AIR FP) aid, sources said. It is also worth noting that Eurozone broad money supply increased more than forecast. ING note that it considered one of the best leading indicators for the eurozone economy, and as such, could be lending some support to sentiment (though EURUSD is just off YTD lows). Sectors are mostly higher, lead by Tech (+1.3%), and Energy (+1.3%), with Telecoms and Financials (+0.2) the laggards for now. In terms of stock specific movers; ABN Amro (-10.0%) shares took a tumble, as the company joined the ranks of other notable European banks in that it is now being investigated by public prosecutors over potential money laundering violations. Imperial Brands (-10.6%) issued negative outlook, expressing concerns over its next generation of products. British American Tobacco (-1.3%) moved lower in sympathy, and US tobacco names may not escape the session unscathed, not least given Imperial Brands specifically names US action on vaping products as resulting in a notable slowdown of vapour product growth. Pearson (-18.1%) sunk after the co. provided disappointing guidance. Wirecard (+2.3%) was bid premarket, after SocGen initiated the company at a Buy premarket. Ericsson (-0.7%) managed to reverse the majority of what was initially substantial losses as the broader market advanced, on the co. provided guidance for Q3 provisions in relation to investigations State-side, and sees costs at SEK 12bln. Finally, airlines were under pressure after IAG (-3.5%) issued a profit warning.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>DXY - Marginally firmer on the day thus far with the index topping yesterday’s high (99.06) in a continuation of recent strength, whilst an optimistic tone from China’s MOFCOM regarding October trade talks in Washington did little to stem the Buck’s rise. DXY has breached its 12 Sept high at 99.10 with its YTD high at 99.37. Next up on the docket State-side, the final metrics US GDP and PCE prices, weekly initial jobless claims and a slew of Fed speaks including Kaplan (non-voter), Bullard (voter, dissenter), Calrida (voter), Daly (non-voter), Kashkari (non-voter) and Barkin (non-voter). In terms of US politics, participants will also be eyeing the potential release of the whistleblower’s complaint against US President Trump in regard to the controversial phone call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, which some members of congress described as “troubling”.</p><p>NZD, AUD - All firmer, with outperformance in the Kiwi following comments from RBNZ Governor Orr who struck an optimistic tone on the domestic economy whilst highlighting that unconventional policy tools are not currently necessary. NZD/USD reached a 0.63+ status overnight, albeit remains off highs (0.6310) at around 0.6290 after kicking the session off at 0.6270. Meanwhile, its Aussie counterpart remains buoyed by the optimistic US/China trade tone after the US President said a deal with China could happen “sooner than you think”, whilst rhetoric from China was remained constructive ahead of trade talks in Washington next month. AUD/USD trades north of 0.6750 with little by way of immediate technical levels in play.</p><p>GBP, EUR - Both softer on the day with Cable the underperformer amid a firmer Buck coupled with Brexit angst as the UK PM remains resilient to a Brexit extension, whilst rhetoric from the EU is also less optimistic as most diplomats believe another delay will only increase the chances of No Deal down the line, according to Sun's Nick Gutteridge. GBP/USD has tested 1.2300 to the downside after breaching a barrage of support levels between 1.2346-50 with the next level to the downside touted at 1.2233 (9th Sept low). The Euro is marginally softer, down from highs of 1.0965 due to a firmer Dollar as the pair moves closer to its YTD low of 1.0924. In terms of levels to the downside, below the psychological 1.0900 mark, the pair sees a strong Fib level at 1.0864 ahead of support at 1.0850.

The China comments in question don’t really change the narrative and as there has been no notable data, aside from German GfK which printed marginally firmer, bonds are fairly lacklustre ahead of this afternoon’s packed speaker slate and US data. On the UK side, after yesterday’s return of Parliament, Gilts are awaiting further clarity on the next steps for UK Politics; recess for Tory Conference, Benn Bill, no-confidence votes and elections all potential announcement to watch out for. While comments out of the EU have been negative with one source describing the chances of achieving a deal as zero. As such, UK debt is a touch firmer and just shy of its session high at 133.93; in yield terms, if the upside continues then 0.493% (yesterday’s low) may come into play. Stateside, a number of notable speakers including Bullard and Clarida scheduled for just after the day’s main data release of GDP (Final), PCE Prices and Jobless Claims amongst other metrics. USTs are slightly stronger though not especially so as trade remains tentative moving into US hours as the declassification of the Whistle Blower report and indications that the impeachment proceedings has the necessary majority of 218 within the House. In terms of the curve, it is experiencing some mild bull flattening this morning with the 2/10 spread a touch narrower.</p>",

However, the advances in the region later waned considering Trump’s tendency to flip flop on trade discussions and as US impeachment concerns lingered, while the PBoC’s open market operations also resulted to a considerable CNY 100bln net drain in liquidity. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower following the bear steepening in the US and after the BoJ reduced its purchase amounts of 5yr-10yr JGBs for today’s Rinban operations.</p><p><strong>PBoC injected a CNY 20bln via 14-day reverse repos</strong> for a net daily drain of CNY 100bln. (Newswires) <strong>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 7.0729 vs. Exp. 7.0947</strong> (Prev. 7.0724)</p><p><strong>US President Trump said China is making large agricultural purchases including beef and pork, while he also commented there is a good chance that we'll make a trade deal with China which is getting closer and closer</strong>.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said cars are not included in the agreement with Japan but the two sides are to discuss it and stated that it is not in the intentions of the US to put Section 232 tariffs on Japan</strong>. Furthermore, Lighthizer stated that once the deal has been implemented, over 90% of US food and agricultural products exported into Japan will be duty free or receive preferential tariff access and <strong>that talks on a phase 2 agreement will start at the end of April/beginning of May next year.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Japanese PM Abe said US President Trump agreed the US won’t impose Section 232 tariffs on Japan while talks are underway</strong>, while Abe also believes the trade agreement with US will lead to further economic growth for Japan and contribute to the global economy. There were also comments from Japan Minister of Economy Trade and Industry Sugawara that he will negotiate firmly and get results in scrapping US tariffs on Japan autos. (Newswires)</p><p>UK/EU</p><p><strong>UK PM Johnson said he will not request a Brexit extension even if conditions of the Benn bill are met</strong>, while he also <strong>stated that changing the Irish backstop is under serious negotiation</strong> and replied yes when asked if he thinks the EU will move on the Irish backstop. (Newswires/ITV)</p><p><strong>UK House of Commons Leader Rees-Mogg said Parliament will be asked on Thursday to approve adjournment motion next week for the Tory Party Conference</strong> and that the government will then hold general debate on principles of democracy. (Newswires)</p><p>UK Government warned that if the opposition did not take up a vote of no confidence last night, they will assume parliament is behind the Brexit plan where UK PM Johnson does not rule out a second prorogation in order to achieve it, although UK opposition Labour Party leader Corbyn refused to table a no confidence motion in the government.

(Newswires/WSJ)</p><p>FX</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> retreated beneath the 99.00 level although still retained most the prior day’s gains spurred by rising US yields and broad weakness across its major counterparts in which <strong>EUR/USD </strong>slipped below the 1.1000 handle. <strong>GBP/USD</strong> was also on the backfoot despite the reopening of Parliament as UK PM Johnson remained defiant and continued to push unsuccessfully for a no-confidence vote to trigger an election, while he also reiterated he will not request a Brexit extension even if the conditions of the Benn bill are met. However, both aforementioned pairs have since nursed some of the losses overnight as they found mild reprieve from the pullback in the USD. Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> and JPY-crosses were mixed with price action largely a function of their base currencies and antipodeans were initially subdued by recent weakness across the commodities complex, although <strong>NZD/USD</strong> later found support from optimistic comments by RBNZ Governor Orr that New Zealand is in a sound position to seize opportunities and that the RBNZ is unlikely to require the use of unconventional monetary policy measures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RBNZ Governor Orr </strong>said New Zealand is in a sound position to seize the opportunities and manage challenges related to global low interest rate environment, while he <strong>added the current view is we are unlikely to require unconventional monetary policy tools and is confident rates will remain low for a number of years</strong> providing a great environment for investment. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were uneventful during Asia hours in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures traded flat as it consolidated from the prior day’s choppy moves in which early downside from this week’s bearish oil inventory reports and Saudi’s restored capacity, was later reversed as trade hopes spurred risk appetite. Elsewhere, <strong>gold prices</strong> languished after the prior day’s slump in which it briefly tested a breakdown of the USD 1500/oz level amid a double whammy from a stronger greenback and lack of safe-haven demand, while copper flatlined as risk momentum began to wane overnight.</p><p><strong>OPEC Secretary General Barkindo</strong> said the oil market has been struck by uncertainty over past few months but added we expect robust long-term oil demand growth. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The Treasury curve has bear-steepened, with major curve spreads generally wider, and yields up across the curve. Yields rose in afternoon trade on optimism about progress on US/China trade talks, after US President Trump said a China trade deal was possible, while transcripts released by the White House do not show a clear point the Democrats can impeach US President Trump on. A soft 5-year auction, which tailed 0.9bps, with sponsorship below average; in wake of the poor auction, yields continued to rise, helping the curve steepen. US T-note futures (Z9) settled 24+ ticks lower at 129-30+.</p><p><strong>Fed's Kaplan (non-voter, dove)</strong> said he feels current policy setting is on the margin of being a little accommodative, while he is agnostic on whether or not more cuts are required and is keeping an open mind. Furthermore, Kaplan said the odds of a recession within next 12 months are relatively low and that repo problems last week show a need for more liquidity but are not sign of broader stress. (Newswires)</p><p>An adviser to Ukraine's President said President Trump's insistence for the two leaders to discuss a possible investigation into Joe Biden was a precondition for their July 25 phone call, while it was also reported the Whistleblower's complaint against US President Trump has been declassified and could be releases as early as Thursday morning according to sources.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat mixed as the region struggles to maintain the momentum from US where President Trump ignited trade hopes after he suggested a deal with China could happen 'sooner than you think', while the US and Japan also reached a first stage trade agreement. ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) were higher at the open although the optimism in Australia later faded amid losses in commodity related sectors especially gold miners after the precious metal slumped to briefly test the USD 1500/oz level, while the Japanese benchmark is positive but with gains capped as participants reflect on the limited US-Japan trade pact which didn’t involve autos although the US was said to have agreed to not impose Section 232 tariffs on Japan while talks are underway. Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) were both underpinned at the open following the encouraging trade rhetoric from US President Trump who also stated that China is making large agricultural purchases and that there is a good chance we'll make a trade deal with China which is getting closer and closer. However, the advances in the region later waned considering Trump’s tendency to flip flop on trade discussions and as US impeachment concerns lingered, while the PBoC’s open market operations resulted to a considerable CNY 100bln net drain in liquidity today.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY marginally retreated back below the 99.00 level although holds on to most the prior day’s gains spurred by rising US yields and broad weakness across its major counterparts in which EUR/USD slipped below the 1.1000 handle. GBP/USD was also on the backfoot despite the reopening of Parliament as UK PM Johnson remained defiant and continued to push unsuccessfully for a no-confidence vote to trigger an election, while he also reiterated he will not request a Brexit extension even if the conditions of the Benn bill are met. However, both aforementioned pairs have since nursed some of the losses overnight as they found reprieve from the pullback in the USD. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are mixed with price action largely a function of their base currencies and antipodeans were initially subdued by recent weakness across the commodities complex, although NZD/USD later found support from optimistic comments by RBNZ Governor Orr that New Zealand is in a sound position to seize the opportunities amid global low interest rate environment and that the RBNZ is unlikely to require the use of unconventional monetary policy measures.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower following the bear steepening in the US and after the BoJ reduced its purchase amounts of 5yr-10yr JGBs for today’s Rinban operations.&nbsp;</p>",
