Minutes noted that System Open Market Account manager suggested that repo operation be made a backstop by raising the min-rate as conditions have improved in the funding markets and FOMC saw no risk that the EFFR would move below the target range when an IOER hike was raised. A few participants suggested the balance sheet could be used to reinforce forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate through purchases of Treasury securities on a scale necessary to keep yields at short- to medium-term maturities capped at specified levels for a period of time.</p><p>FOMC Minutes stated that some commented the Committee could make its forward guidance for the path for the federal funds rate more explicit. For example, the Committee could adopt outcome-based forward guidance that would specify macroeconomic outcomes—such as a certain level of the unemployment rate or of the inflation rate—that must be achieved before it would consider raising the target rate. Furthermore, respondents to Desk surveys attached almost no probability to the FOMC implementing negative policy rates.</p><p>Several also said the FOMC may need to provide further clarity regarding its intentions for asset purchases as uncertainty about the evolution of the purchases could increase over time. A number of participants emphasized that regulators should encourage banks to prepare for possible downside scenarios by further limiting payouts to shareholders, thereby preserving loss-absorbing capital.

The USD printed its third day of losses amid the constructive risk tone, though its moves are also influenced by the EUR’s recent rally, as the bloc gets its act together with regards to virus relief. Oil was higher, supported by bullish inventory data. Yields were lower across the Treasury curve, and the supply of new 20-year bonds was decent. The Fed’s meeting minutes added little new information to the narrative, although the Fed impresses it still has scope to tweak programmes and tighten forward guidance; there was also the now customary call on fiscal authorities to help out with the heavy lifting. Lowe’s (LOW) saw a solid beat on EPS and revenue while SSS smashed analyst expectations, rising 12.3% (exp. +3.44%). LOW also noted that its strong sales are continuing into May. Target (TGT) also saw top and bottom-line beats with firmer comp sales than expected (+10.8%, exp. +7.5%) driven by a 141% rise in e-commerce; OM’s beat, GM’s missed.

As US players arrived, the curve was bear-steepening moderately, perhaps due to corporate supply and pre-20-year auction hedging, with the complex content to look through moves in equity markets. However, buying action was seen in wake of reports that the Senate had passed a bill that aimed at increasing oversight of Chinese companies, which could require Chinese firms listed in the US to de-list from US exchanges, and required companies to certify no government control. The story, while not a law yet, reinforces the tensions between US/China. The new 20-year auction was decent, although tailed 0.7bps, though there is no recent auction history to compare the metrics. Last week, analysts had modelled a high yield of 1.26bps, and the stop-out level was 4bps richer than that. Cover was decent at 2.53x when compared to similar auctions, while indirect participation was also encouraging (as seen in the recent 10s and 30s auction), suggesting that there is still foreign demand for USTs even at these low yields. T-note (M0) futures settled 7 ticks higher at 139-02+.</p>",

The Monday story gave hopes that a second wave can be avoided, and stocks rallied; but Tuesday’s update dragged stocks lower. Authers says “the episode tells us there is more room for the market to rise, if people can be given an excuse,” and “it also shows the depth of desire for someone to come up with a vaccine that can short-circuit what looks like being at least another 12-months of nervousness, fear, ever more fractious politics, and a sluggish economy — and that the current price is based on some bearish assumptions.” Crucially, he argues that the episode demonstrates that, given so few precedents to guide traders, and given the trading community are not scientific experts, it is ‘rival narratives’ which is driving stock price action. The piece is definitely worth a read, and highlights three/four narratives which have been ‘abused’ by markets: “It’s Just A Flu” (used as a justification for minimizing the entire pandemic); “Herd Immunity” (to justify carrying on with economic activity as usual, and risking lives); “Flatten the Curve” (to justify continuing with tight lockdown measures even when they have served their purpose); and possibly “A Vaccine Will Cure Everything.”</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>CHINESE STOCK LISTINGS: </strong>The<strong> </strong>US Senate passed a bill aimed at increasing oversight of Chinese companies; could require Chinese firms listed in the US to de-list from US exchanges and requires companies to certify no government control. Note that the bill will now go to the House for a vote. Analysts have been closely watching US/China headlines for signs that harsh rhetoric is backed with legislative actions; any laws that underpin a restricting of portfolio flows is being seen as quite a negative. The passing of this bill suggests that some of the heated rhetoric is being backed up by action, and the desk is watching for further developments and details. The announcement saw downside in NQ June ’20 futures, and more acute losses in Chinese ADRs such as BIDU, JD, BABA, TME, NTES, TCOM.</p><p><strong>TAIWAN:</strong> China has urged US to cut official ties with Taiwan and to stop upgrading substantive relations, interfering in China's internal affairs and to stop undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as US/China relations. This comes as US' relationship with Taiwan is seen as a threat to China; reports noted that US is attempting to squeeze Huawei via Taiwan's TSMC, which was seen as a restriction to China's influence over Taiwan.&nbsp; Meanwhile, at her inauguration speech, \"anti-China\" President Tsai said China would never leave any room for “Taiwan independence”. China's Foreign Ministry later stated China will take necessary countermeasures on US' wrong behaviours (regarding Taiwan), adding the US must bear the consequences. China added US actions on Taiwan violates the promise it made and sent the wrong signal to the Taiwan independence forces.</p><h2><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></h2><p><strong>STIMULUS WATCH: </strong>Ahead of the NPC this week (our full preview of the NPC event can be <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24535/download?code=9o9AJWcr9Jp2luZCucYf\">found here</a>), analyst expectations for more stimulus from the Chinese government are building, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3bab2257-aaae-4d4c-82af-6654b0b82961\">FT reports</a>. One analyst said “the NPC will send a clear signal on the level of economic stimulus in the coming months,” and the stimulus “is going to be a strong one, but a runaway building boom is unlikely to happen given the long-term damage it does to the economy.” Meanwhile, there is focus on remarks from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which have suggested that central banks will need to ramp-up QE to prevent a sharp rise in bond yields, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/jpmorgan-joins-goldman-saying-more-qe-needed-to-cap-bond-yields\">Bloomberg reported</a>, stating that the level of expected increase in supply this year (around USD 2.1trln) is offsetting the USD 1.9trln demand for bonds by USD 200bln, implying upward pressure on yields and that more issuance adds to the case for higher rates and steeper curves.</p><p><strong>AUSTRALIA/CHINA: </strong>With tensions rising between the two nations after Australia’s push to examine whether the coronavirus came from China, it has seen a deterioration in relations between the two which saw China put tariffs on Australian barley. China Global Times wrote today that China has the power to hurt the Australian economy, but it will not fire the first shot. China hopes Australia can release more goodwill and take more measures to repair its relationship with its largest trading partner.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>BOE: </strong>Governor Bailey once again noted how the bank does not rule out negative rates on principle. The Governor added the BoE is keen to observe how the economy has responded to recent cuts, adding we will review the purchase of risky assets, noting having tools to act rapidly is important. Further on NIRP, he noted the financial system structure of other countries with negative rates is important (note, Tenreyo recently noted how she believes they are positive in Europe). Bailey later added there are mixed reviews on NIRP, says there are good reasons to think pass through would be different. Bailey also noted that the challenge currently is getting inflation to return to target.</p><p><strong>FED MINUTES</strong>: The Fed’s meeting minutes from the April confab came in largely as expected, with policymakers pledging to act as appropriate to support the recovery, and rates will be left at low levels until participants are convinced that the recovery is on track. The FOMC also noted actions taken by the Fed has helped improve market functioning. There was no explicit mention of negative rates, although a Desk Survey was cited that suggested respondents saw no probability of NIRP. Yield curve control was alluded to, with a few participants noted that yield curve control could be used to reinforce forward guidance via capping short- to medium-term yields at specified levels. On fiscal stimulus, it repeated that greater fiscal support may be necessary if the downturn persists. There was also a nudge at banks, with a number of participants emphasising that regulators should encourage banks to prepare for possible downside scenarios by further limiting payouts to shareholders. The Committee could make forward guidance more explicit, the minutes suggested, by perhaps adopting out-come based guidance or calendar-based guidance, which could specify certain unemployment rate of inflation targets. These minutes were always expected to be a bit of a stale, non-event, and the market reaction has generally confirmed that hypothesis. Accordingly, it is safe to assume that the minutes and recent commentary suggests that the Fed is leaving policy where it is until it sees the recovery emerging, and still has tools to both add/tweak. In future communications, it is also worth keeping an eye on the tone of the FOMC participants' view on formalising its current QE programme, some analysts said.</p><p><strong>FED SPEAK: Fed's Kaplan</strong> (voter) mentioned how consumer activity cannot be legislated nor stimulated, stating we need to invest in testing, so consumers feel safe. Kaplan thinks the Fed and fiscal authorities will need to do more. His comments on fiscal action and more monetary action are in line with other Fed officials, notably Powell. Powell has previously said the Fed could further help companies with liquidity issues for a while, but over time, more fiscal help will be needed – a strong hint to fiscal policymakers as they debate the next tranche of stimulus. Powell on the weekend said at least three-to-six more months of government support would be required. Bullard (non-voter, dove) also spoke very much reiterating previous comments but added that a virus resurgence is unlikely to derail recovery efforts.</p><p><strong>SARB:</strong> The SARB is expected to cut rates by 50bps to 50-year low 3.75%, though there is a risk it will cut by a larger magnitude. There have been calls for the SARB to buy government bonds in primary markets, though it is expected to lean against this political pressure for now. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-sarb-rate-decision-due-around-1400-bst-on-thursday-21st-may-2020-expected-to-cut-50bps-could-be-more-will-likely-lean-back-against-direct-government-bond-purchases-20-05-2020\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p><strong>CBRT:</strong> All 15 analysts polled by Reuters expect the Central Bank to implement another cut to the Weekly Repo Rate, currently at 8.75%. However, as is usually the case, economists are split over the magnitude of the reduction – with the range varying between 100-50bps and the median pointing to the lower end. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-cbrt-rate-decision-on-thursday-21st-at-12-00bst-expectations-are-for-a-50bps-cut-to-8-25-forecast-range-50-100bps-cut-20-05-2020\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p>T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 139-02+</p><p>Treasury yields fell across the curve by between 1-3bps and major curve spreads are mixed at settlement. As US players arrived, the curve was bear-steepening moderately, perhaps due to corporate supply and pre-20-year auction hedging, with the complex content to look through moves in equity markets. However, buying action was seen in wake of reports that the Senate had passed a bill that aimed at increasing oversight of Chinese companies, which could require Chinese firms listed in the US to de-list from US exchanges, and required companies to certify no government control.

Following the WTI June contract expiry, which saw the front-month spread move into backwardation and went by relatively smoothly when compared to the May contract’s historic final few trading sessions, the front-month spread has returned into contango, albeit considerably less steep than the “super contango” seen before, supporting the thesis of a tightening physical market. That notion rings true post this week’s US inventory data, which saw a draw in the private release on Tuesday, supported the energy complex overnight, and was confirmed by the EIA data today. Crude stocks fell by 5mln bbls, marking the second consecutive draw, while the key Cushing hub saw its stocks draw by 5.6mln bbls, a trend which is critical for allowing nearby WTI holders to avoid another break down of the futures market amid storage capacity concerns. The EIA also reported distillates and gasoline both built by 3.8mln and 2.8mln each respectively, while refinery utilisation rose by 1.5%; crude production fell by 100k BPD to 11.5mln BPD. Elsewhere, OPEC Secretary-General Barkindo spoke today saying that oil supply and demand fundamentals are gradually converging. Dallas Fed’s Kaplan said he thinks oil well shut-ins are at their peak and said that a lot would come back by the year-end.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.7% at 2972, NDX +2% at 9485, DJIA +1.5% at 24,576</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Energy +3.8%, Financials +2.2%, Technology +2.1%, Industrials +1.8%, Communications +1.8%, Materials +1.6%, Discretionary +1.4%, Staples +1.1%, Real Estate +0.9%, Utilities +0.5%, Health Care +0.1%.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Lowe’s (LOW) saw a solid beat on EPS and revenue while SSS smashed analyst expectations, rising 12.3% (exp. +3.44%).

The consultancy believes this increase makes sense as lockdown measures start to ease and given the prior months report was surveyed in the middle of lockdown. “The headline index continues to signal severe weakness in retail sales, which is exactly the right message for Q2 as a whole” which points to a slow process of lifting lockdowns and a small recovery in retail sales growth by the middle of Q2. Pantheon also highlights that the data is particularly sensitive to turning points in changes in activity which will likely be seen in tomorrow’s PMI, “headlines will look great, but that doesn’t mean activity has returned to normal” the consultancy concludes.</p><p><strong>CANADA CPI (APR.):</strong> Canadian consumer prices declined 0.7% M/M in April, a little deeper than the expected decline of 0.6%; the Y/Y measure printed -0.2% against an expected -0.1%; the three core BOC measures declined by 3bps to 1.8%. Capital Economics argues that with energy prices enjoying a rebound, headline inflation is unlikely to fall much further below these levels, and explains that core inflation was little changed in the months due to items like clothing and electricity; \"these were discarded as outliers in the three core measures, while StatsCan was unable to calculate prices for some other heavily-affected components like airfares and travel tours and so simply imputed that, despite the complete collapse in demand for those services, prices moved in line with the overall CPI index,\" CapEco says. Quirks have meant that only one of the three core measures declined (common measure fell to 1.6% from 1.7%, the trimmed and median were unchanged at 2.0% and 1.8% respectively). \"We had assumed that inflation for many goods and services would plummet amid essentially zero demand, but StatsCan’s method for imputing these prices means we may have to revisit our core inflation forecasts,\" CapEco says, \"Nevertheless, we doubt an average of the three measures will be returning to over 2% again any time soon.\"</p><h2><strong>FX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>USD, EUR:</strong> The dollar saw a third consecutive day of declines, with DXY finding support around the 99-figure. After 99.00 was hit the USD bounced back from the lows some reprieve was seen although the buck remained lower on the day given the overall positive risk sentiment as economies continue to reopen. There was nothing to concern USD traders within the FOMC meeting minutes, which largely reiterates the Fed’s stance, and hints at YCC/more explicit guidance ahead. The EUR has continued to rise since the Franco-German EU recovery fund proposal, and also supported by firmer risk sentiment detracting the Buck’s appeal. EURUSD extended on gains, finding resistance at 1.10 from the 1.08 low at the beginning of the week. JPMorgan notes this sort of price action has been typical and remains biased towards a short USD stance, at least for now. The desk suggests 1.1000/20 is key, and a break above it would put more pressure on shorts. JPM also notes asset managers were buyers of EUR yesterday and, if this persists against a backdrop of still ample spec shorts, it would consider revisiting a tactical long position.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Despite a falling dollar and positive risk sentiment, GBP saw downside amid continued rhetoric from the MPC that negative rates are in the toolkit, even though they might not be seen in the immediate term. Meanwhile, CPI data was softer than expected in April, slowing to 0.8% Y/Y (exp. 0.9%, prev. 1.5% Y/Y), while the M/M print declined by 0.2%, slightly deeper than the expected -0.1% print. BOE Governor Bailey noted the current challenge is getting inflation to return to the bank’s target. ING writes that the risk of no extension to the transition period appears a quite strong bearish argument and the desk expects GBP to re-enter a depreciation trend soon.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD:</strong> Antipodeans traded firmer, although AUD lagged NZD amid the deterioration of the relationship with China; a Global Times piece suggested that China has the power to “hurt” the Australian economy but it will not fire the first shot,&nbsp; hoping Australia can release more goodwill and take more measures to repair its relationship with its largest trading partner. TD Securities said the AUD looks like it is closest to either a potential breakout or backslide, and the desk eyes the end-April high of 0.6570, a level which broke today, suggesting a sustained move beyond this level would make the argument that we are to head lower soon rather difficult. TD says “at 3.4 standard deviations above our high frequency fair value estimate of 0.6300, the AUD looks very stretched at these levels. Even on a good day, that would leave us reluctant to embrace a rally from here.”</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie rose today in line with risk sentiment, rising crude prices, and a falling USD. CPI was the focus, although there was little price action in the aftermath; the BOC’s core metrics only ticked down modestly. USDCAD has stuck around 1.39 for the majority of the session; Scotiabank “look for choppy range trading to extend and, as such, feel that scope for additional CAD gains beyond the 1.3850/1.39 zone is limited for now.”</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The Yen firmed against a falling dollar despite a decent approach to risk elsewhere, although moves were thin trading within the 107.34-107.98 parameters. Technicians at Citi see a potential of USDJPY in danger of breaking higher, suggesting “the pattern now looks like an inverted head and shoulders with a neckline at 107.63 – we could see a move to 109.40.”</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>Emerging Market FX was generally firmer against the dollar today, apart from TRY heading into tomorrow’s CBRT decision. MXN, RUB &amp; ZAR (SARB tomorrow too) saw solid gains with the former two benefitting from the continued inventory draws being seen in the US driving oil higher, suggesting supply woes are starting to abate. Meanwhile, the ZAR cleared 18.00 to the downside against the buck and continues to extend beyond the figure at pixel time amid firmer than expected (and the prior) retail sales. MUFG highlights that EMFX countries are struggling to contain the coronavirus as well as DM economies. Meanwhile, MUFG sees a risk of a second wave greater in the US than Europe given Trump’s optimism to reopen the economy quickly, and if that were to happen will see a less likely chance of travel restrictions being eased to the South America countries</p>",

As US players arrived, the curve was bear-steepening moderately, perhaps due to corporate supply and pre-20-year auction hedging, with the complex content to look through moves in equity markets. However, buying action was seen in wake of reports that the Senate had passed a bill that aimed at increasing oversight of Chinese companies, which could require Chinese firms listed in the US to de-list from US exchanges, and required companies to certify no government control. The story, while not a law yet, reinforces the tensions between US/China. The new 20-year auction was decent, although tailed 0.7bps, though there is no recent auction history to compare the metrics. Last week, analysts had modelled a high yield of 1.26bps, and the stop-out level was 4bps richer than that. Cover was decent at 2.53x when compared to similar auctions, while indirect participation was also encouraging (as seen in the recent 10s and 30s auction), suggesting that there is still foreign demand for USTs even at these low yields.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

Following the WTI June contract expiry, which saw the front-month spread move into backwardation and went by relatively smoothly when compared to the May contract’s historic final few trading sessions, the front-month spread has returned into contango, albeit considerably less steep than the “super contango” seen before, supporting the thesis of a tightening physical market. That notion rings true post this week’s US inventory data, which saw a draw in the private release on Tuesday, supported the energy complex overnight, and was confirmed by the EIA data today. Crude stocks fell by 5mln bbls, marking the second consecutive draw, while the key Cushing hub saw its stocks draw by 5.6mln bbls, a trend which is critical for allowing nearby WTI holders to avoid another break down of the futures market amid storage capacity concerns. The EIA also reported distillates and gasoline both built by 3.8mln and 2.8mln each respectively, while refinery utilisation rose by 1.5%; crude production fell by 100k BPD to 11.5mln BPD. Elsewhere, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo spoke today saying that oil supply and demand fundamentals are gradually converging. Dallas Fed’s Kaplan said he thinks oil well shut-ins are at their peak and said that a lot would come back by the year-end.</p>",

The FOMC also noted actions taken by the Fed has helped improve market functioning. There was no explicit mention of negative rates, although a Desk Survey was cited that suggested respondents saw no probability of NIRP. Yield curve control was alluded to, with a few participants noted that yield curve control could be used to reinforce forward guidance via capping short- to medium-term yields at specified levels. On fiscal stimulus, it repeated that greater fiscal support may be necessary if the downturn persists. There was also a nudge at banks, with a number of participants emphasising that regulators should encourage banks to prepare for possible downside scenarios by further limiting payouts to shareholders. The Committee could make forward guidance more explicit, the minutes suggested, by perhaps adopting out-come based guidance or calendar-based guidance, which could specify certain unemployment rate of inflation targets.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ANALYSIS: </strong>These minutes were always expected to be a bit of a stale, non-event, and the market reaction has generally confirmed that hypothesis. Accordingly, it is safe to assume that the minutes and recent commentary suggest that the Fed is leaving policy where it is until it sees the recovery emerging, and still has tools to both add/tweak. In future communications, it is also worth keeping an eye on the tone of the FOMC participants view on formalising its current QE programme, some analysts said.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "",
        "reaction_details": "",
        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p>The minutes to the Fed’s April meeting are unlikely to be a game changer, given that the confab itself was considered a ‘holding meeting’, and there have been many Fed speakers in the three weeks that have followed, making the minutes somewhat stale (not that Fed speakers have been saying much, except they will do everything within their mandate to support the economy through this unprecedented times). And that is likely to be the underlying theme of the minutes. Elsewhere, however, we will be on the lookout for commentary on negative rates – which does not carry much favour among Fed members, though is something that they are seemingly keeping in the toolbox in case it is needed in the future – as well as any commentary on yield curve control, which analysts expect the Fed to pivot to in the months ahead to bolster its pledge to keep short-term yields anchored at historic lows for the foreseeable future. Additionally, there will likely be another call on fiscal authorities to help with the heavy lifting. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FOMC APRIL MEETING RECAP:</strong> The Fed’s 30th April rate decision was as expected; the federal funds rate target and the interest on excess reserves were left unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and 0.10% respectively. The Fed reiterated its commitment to keep rates at current low levels until the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its inflation and labour market goals. One key omission from its statement was references to specific amounts of asset purchases (previously it indicated that it would buy “at least” USD 500bln of Treasuries and at least USD 200bln of MBS); instead, it said it would purchase in amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, which might be taken as a pledge for limitless QE until the central bank is confident that its mandates can be met – in his press conference, Chair Powell said the Fed was waiting to see how economic conditions unfold before committing. Some traders were disappointed by the lack of explicit forward guidance within the statement; Powell reiterated that rates would remain low until the economy has ‘weathered’ the COVID impact, echoing the statement. He provided what has become customary warnings about the impending collapse of economic metrics in Q2, as a result of the virus, but thinks that Q3 might see ‘substantial growth’. The Fed chair also emphasised a willingness to do more if required. And in terms of the outlook, Powell identified medium-term risks: the virus and bringing it under control; the possibility of damage to the productive capacity of the economy; the global dimension, where negative data abroad can weigh on the US; Powell believes that the Fed has the policies to address these, but not perfectly. Another key omission was clues about yield curve control; analysts believe that the Fed will need to eventually implement a Japan/Australia style yield curve control policy that keeps a lid on shorter-dated Treasury yields – this policy would be the strong arm to bolster the central bank’s guidance that rates will be kept low. This policy is expected to be hinted at in the months ahead, likely from June, as the Fed gains more clarity on how the virus will play out. Additionally, desks believe that the Fed will continue to taper its (what has been front-loaded) asset purchases (currently running at an average clip of around USD 50bln/week) to something like USD 60-80bln per month (NOTE: this publication is released before the NY Fed update on Friday afternoon, where it may again lower the pace of purchases). However, don’t expect any updates until the aforementioned clarity can be seen; for what it is worth, Powell emphasised that the Fed would not be removing the punch bowl too quickly, or any time soon. One theme that has been in vogue in recent days is negative rates, after some Federal Funds Futures contracts rose above par, signalling a non-zero probability of negative rates ahead; Powell and Co. have heavily leaned-back against this policy tool next week; analysts are of the view that the tool would only be used if the Fed had exhausted all other options. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>POWELL SENATE TESTIMONY: </strong>Fed chair Powell repeated his pledge to maintain rates at near-zero levels until the economy had weathered the crisis, and emphasise that the passage of the CARES Act was critical to the Fed’s ability to expand credit programmes to help support the economy, and as a result of these actions, market function has improved. Elsewhere, there was little of note, in terms of new developments, within Powell’s remarks; the Fed is continuing to look into ways to accommodate additional borrowers, and is particularly looking at extending borrowing to states with low populations, the Fed chair told lawmakers. He also said that he expects the central bank’s balance sheet to gradually shrink over time; what matters is the size of the balance sheet relative to the size of the US economy, and the balance sheet does not yet raise financial stability concerns; however, analysts have viewed the balance sheet debate is a debate for another post-pandemic day. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>FISCAL ACTION: </strong>Powell has previously said the Fed could further help companies with liquidity issues for a while, but over time, more fiscal help will be needed – a strong hint to fiscal policymakers as they debate the next tranche of stimulus. Powell on the weekend said at least three-to-six more months of government support would be required. The Fed chair seems to be arguing that further support is crucial to any recovery, and that if policymakers are careful about how the economy is reopened, and people take these social distancing measures forward, then the recovery can begin fairly soon, and job losses seen since mid-March may prove to be temporary; he also argued that, assuming there is no second wave of the coronavirus, the economy will begin to recover steadily through the second half of this year. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES: </strong>Fed chair Powell has pushed-back heavily against the idea of negative rates, citing the mixed evidence that exists on its efficacy. However, it is worth noting that a lot of Powell’s language has clearly been structured to leave the option open to the Fed in the future, and other Fed participants (like Kashkari) have also retained this optionality. Such an approach seems sensible, analysts argue; the Fed would be able to exhaust other policy options first before resorting to more aggressive policies. The message, therefore, seems to be that negative rates are not on the radar in the near-term, but the market and policymakers seem to be retaining a non-zero chance of seeing them next year.</p>",

Pantheon also highlights that the data is particularly sensitive to turning points in changes in activity which will likely be seen in tomorrow’s PMI, “headlines will look great, but that doesn’t mean activity has returned to normal” the consultancy concludes.&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>20-YEAR ANNOUNCEMENT: </strong>The 20-year supply will be the first since 1986. At its quarterly refunding announcement, the US Treasury said it would finally issue its new 20-year maturities on 20th May, for a size of USD 20bln. The size was bigger than anticipated (USD 12-14bln was touted), and with heavier supply at the long-end of the curve, combined with no announcement of a 4- or 6-year tenor, resulted in sharp curve steepening in the wake of the announcement.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>20-YEAR SECTOR: </strong>UBS estimates that the market has cheapened the 20-year sector, noting that the sector was cheap versus 10s30s curve as well, although now seems fair; hence, UBS says, it is cheap outright. “In general, we think the sector has already been cheap due to less liquidity and the fact that the Fed owns a large portion of the issues in the 20-year sector so its future purchases are limited.” UBS argues that, given where the 3.375% May 2044 bond is trading, fair value for the 20-year issue is implied at around 1.27%; If we assume 1-2bps of liquidity premia for the new issue, the issue is likely to trade at 1.26%, the bank writes, speculating that the issue should see strong demand since a lot of indexers and Asset Liability Management hedgers will need to buy it. “You can pick-up a lot of yield as the steepest part of 10s30s curve (around 70bps) where fair value is actually 10s20s curve (60bps),” UBS says, noting that the 30-year bond has a duration of 23-years, and comparatively, the 20-year will have a duration of 17.6yrs (5.4yrs shorter), and therefore, it makes more sense to extend duration with a 20-year than a 30- year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HOW THE AUCTION MIGHT PERFORM: </strong>Analysts at BMO note that takedown seen at the recent 10s and 30s auctions is an encouraging detail for Wednesday's 20-year sale, and points to a solid first auction for the new bond. And the sale may garner decent foreign demand, given that the return in Treasuries hedged back into yen is attractive, and recent reports have highlighted that 10s were once again popular among Japanese investors; what will be notable is whether the positive FX hedged yield Japanese investors can earn in the 10-year sector can translate to 20s, BMO says.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AFTER THE AUCTION: </strong>Post-auction on Wednesday May 20th, into month-end, UBS recommends a 10s20s curve flatteners, arguing that we are likely to see larger than normal index extension for the end of month rebalancing due to heavy long-end issuance this month.\"</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Fed’s Kaplan keeps Dollar capped and BoE suppresses Sterling",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Nothing new or untoward from current FOMC voter Kaplan, but assertions along the lines of Fed chair Powell about the need for more monetary and fiscal stimulus applied a bit more pressure on the Greenback, with the <strong>DXY</strong> breaching support just ahead of 99.000 at 99.097 (May 8 low). However, the Buck’s broader and deeper retreat was largely due to dwindling safe-haven demand amidst another upturn in risk sentiment and oil’s ongoing resurgence that persisted after the June WTI contract expiry with assistance from OPEC Secretary General Barkindo claiming that supply and demand fundamentals are gradually rebalancing.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Having brushed off weaker than forecast UK CPI and other price data, the Pound was not quite as dismissive of BoE testimony given further references to NIRP not being ruled out among various options and tools under consideration by the MPC that may have to respond swiftly to provide additional economic support. Indeed, Sterling failed to take full advantage of the floundering Dollar as Cable stalled ahead of 1.2300 and Eur/Gbp rebounded from the low 0.8900 zone to circa 0.8970.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has extended post-RBNZ Governor Orr gains to 0.6150+ and 1.0715 vs its US and Aussie counterparts respectively, even though the latter has managed to scale 0.6570 and peer over 0.6600. To recap, the Nzd drew extra momentum from Orr wading in to the negative rate debate and remarking that it is not likely at the current juncture, but could be in contention ‘a lot later’, while the Aud was rocked by a record drop in retail sales and the threat of wider Chinese export tariffs ahead of May PMIs.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/CAD/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All benefiting at the Greenback’s expense, with the Franc back above 0.9650, Euro within a whisker of 1.1000, Loonie consolidating around 1.3875 and Yen rebounding to 107.50+ from just under 108.00 at one stage on Tuesday. The single currency is also gleaning support from latest signs of recovery from COVID-19 on the physical and economic side, while bolstered by the prospect of Eur500 bn fiscal support assuming the rescue fund is signed off next week. Elsewhere, the Cad is only marginally weaker despite deflationary Canadian CPI and the Jpy appears to be encouraged by the fact that multiple lows held again yesterday, not to mention the 200 DMA.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The Swedish Krona has been outperforming relative to its Scandinavian peer for the most part, but both are on course to post gains vs the Euro as they maintain upward trajectories towards 10.5000 and 11.0000 on the grounds of less dovish Riksbank and Norges Bank stances compared to the ECB. Meanwhile, more pronounced appreciation or retracement vs the Usd has been the midweek session theme for EMs, with even the Brl on the front foot irrespective of coronavirus contagion spiralling. Elsewhere, the Zar has cleared another psychological hurdle at 18.0000 in contrast to the Try that is treading more cautiously into the CBRT regardless of the fact that Turkish and SA benchmark rates are both expected to be cut by 50 bp.</p>",

Ahead, the expectation is that the SARB’s key rate will remain unchanged until Q3 2021. Analysts see the South African economy contracting by 6.5% in 2020, but are optimistic that growth will pick up to 2.9% in 2021.</li><li><strong>POTENTIALLY BIGGER MOVE: </strong>BNP Paribas is looking for a cut of 75-100bps at the May meeting, arguing that the SARB would likely prefer to front load any reductions in anticipation of more substantial economic pressures ahead, and says that “strong deflation in fuel prices and collapsing demand are unlikely to outweigh a weaker ZAR and its limited pass-through to CPI, averaging a 17-year low of 2.8% in 2020, breaching the lower bound of the SARB’s 3- 6% target.”</li><li><strong>QE:</strong> The SARB has been buying bonds in secondary markets to assist the government’s COVID Response efforts, and its holdings have now risen to ZAR 20.6bln; desks will be paying attention to any commentary hinting at more support ahead of South Africa's 24th June budget, where the government is expected to announce further support measures. Recently, there has been calls from the ruling ANC party for the SARB to enter primary markets to support the government as the deficit ticks higher -- some policy makers have argued that money printing would lead to higher inflation and weaken the currency --although analysts expect that, for now, the normally conservative central bank will lean back against these calls.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: All 15 analysts polled by Reuters expect the Central Bank to implement another cut to the Weekly Repo Rate, currently at 8.75%. However, as is usually the case, economists are split over the magnitude of the reduction – with the range varying between 100-50bps and the median pointing to the lower end.</p><p><strong>PRIOR MEETING:</strong> The Central Bank has cut a cumulative 1525bps since July 2019. At the most recent confab, the CBRT opted to reduce its Weekly Repo Rate by 100bps, at the top of analysts’ forecast range – taking real rates deeper into negative territory. Notably, the Central Bank assessed that risks to its year-end inflation forecasts are to the downside, whilst stating that economic activity started to weaken in mid-March due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on external trade, tourism, and domestic demand. On the Lira, the Bank repeated the softer currency effect on inflation is offset by weaker oil prices, net-net a favourable impact. The Bank reaffirmed its “cautious monetary stance” and said it will be determined considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend, but emphasised that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.</p><p><strong>RESERVES AND LIRA</strong>: Depleting reserves has been a major factor behind the Lira’s recent weakness, with USD reserves dwindling as the Central Bank attempts to defend the Try from further depreciation. These woes prompted USD/TRY to reach all-time highs at 7.2690, surpassing the 7.2350 peak set at the height of the previous Lira crisis. As such swap lines have been requested by the CBRT, with little support from the ECB, and Fed, whilst reports of lines intstigated with the BoE and BoJ were also refuted. However, it was reported that the line with Qatar has been expanded three-fold to USD 15bln. However, desks worry about the inflation outlook given the Lira’s fragility and rising oil prices.</p><p><strong>DATA</strong>: In terms of data, Apr CPI YY dipped to 10.94% from 11.86%, while the CBRT also lowered its end-year forecast to 9.38% from 9.76% - in-fitting with efforts to get inflation back to target. Credit Suisse believes another rate cut is warranted in the near term given the current environment, and “the risk to our three-month policy rate forecast of 7.50% is firmly to the downside”, the Swiss bank says.</p>",

Capital Economics argues that with energy prices enjoying a rebound, headline inflation is unlikely to fall much further below these levels, and explains that core inflation was little changed in the months due to items like clothing and electricity; \"these were discarded as outliers in the three core measures, while StatsCan was unable to calculate prices for some other heavily-affected components like air fares and travel tours and so simply imputed that, despite the complete collapse in demand for those services, prices moved in line with the overall CPI index,\" CapEco says. Quirks have meant that only one of the three core measures declined (common measure fell to 1.6% from 1.7%, the trimmed and median were unchanged at 2.0% and 1.8% respectively). \"We had assumed that inflation for many goods and services would plummet amid essentially zero demand, but StatsCan’s method for imputing these prices means we may have to revisit our core inflation forecasts,\" CapEco says, \"Nevertheless, we doubt an average of the three measures will be returning to over 2% again any time soon.\"</p>",

LOW suggested it saw strong sales continue into May. China’s PBOC left both 1- and 5-year LPR rates unchanged, while investors await this week’s NPC; RBNZ governor Orr cooled talk on negative rates. Data showed European inflation below estimates, and some analysts suggestions about deflation ahead; a similar theme is seen in the UK inflation data. Ahead: <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-fomc-april-2020-meeting-minutes-to-be-released-at-1400-edt-1900-bst-20-05-2020\">FOMC minutes</a>, <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-us-to-sell-usd-20bln-of-new-20-year-bonds-at-1300-edt-1800-bst-20-05-2020\">20-year bond auction</a> are the main events that stand out; we continue to track further <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/china-s-foreign-ministry-says-china-will-take-necessary-countermeasures-on-us-wrong-behaviours-regarding-taiwan-adds-us-must-bear-the-consequences-20-05-2020\">prickly US/China headlines</a>, and news flow on vaccines/treatments (see below).</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> All sectors open in positive territory with Energy and Industrials leading the gains after leading losses yesterday. The crude complex supporting the former after last night’s private inventory crude &amp; cushing draw. While Industrials are benefiting from gains in Airlines (DAL, UAL, LUV, AAL). Defensives are the laggards today as overall risk sentiment is positive, with Real Estate, Health Care, Utilities the relative underperformers albeit still with slight gains.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Lowe’s (LOW) saw a solid beat on EPS and revenue while SSS smashed analyst expectations, rising 12.3% (exp. +3.44%). LOW also noted that its strong sales are continuing into May. Target (TGT) also saw top and bottom-line beats with firmer comp sales than expected (+10.8%, exp. +7.5%) driven by a 141% rise in e-commerce; OM’s beat, GM’s missed. Analog Devices (ADI) beat on EPS while revenue was in line, while its guidance was firmer than expected; OM’s beat, GM’s missed. Royal Caribbean (RCL) missed on EPS, and saw a slight revenue beat.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) has reportedly accelerated its plan to move iPhone production to India and Vietnam as it looks to diversify manufacturing risks away from China amid souring US/China relations, according to DigiTimes citing supply chain sources. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) announced it will stop selling its talcum powder in the US and Canada, but it will continue to sell the product outside of North America. Casinos (BYD, PENN, LVS, WYNN, MGM, CZR) in Louisiana, and Mississippi are set to reopen this weekend, while Las Vegas looks set to reopen in June. Google (GOOG) and Dell (DELL) launched a hybrid storage solution to offer simplified management of private and public cloud storage. Roku (ROKU) and AT&amp;T’s (T) WarnerMedia are reportedly aiming for a deal to get HBO Max streaming service on Roku’s platform, but it will not appear on Amazon’s (AMZN) firestick until May 27th, according to Variety. Haliburton (HAL) cut its dividend, Northrop Grumman (NOC) raised its dividend.</p><p><strong>ES LEVELS:</strong> The Emini S&amp;P 500 saw overnight lows around 2,908, following the late sell-off on Wall Street, though has managed to rise to 2,950, which is key area from a valuation perspective (consensus FY20 expected EPS 138 x 21.4 p/e; FY21 EPS expected 163 x 18.1 p/e). Beneath, desks are continuing to watch 2,930 (61.8% Feb hi-Mar lo) and the region around 2,922-24, 2,900-10 psychological level, and then Monday’s low around 2,850. To the topside, the weekly high 2,976.25, and then the 200dma at 2,997.</p><p><strong>GROWTH VS VALUE: </strong>Shares of fast-growing companies are racing past their value counterparts, on pace to outperform the latter by the widest margin since the dot-com era, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/growth-stocks-outperforming-value-by-widest-margin-in-decades-11589904864\">WSJ reports</a>. Goldman Sachs thinks the extreme current valuation gap between the most expensive and least expensive stocks will most likely be closed when an improving economic environment causes the low valuation stocks to ‘catch up’ to the current market leaders.</p><p><strong>LESSONS FROM MODERNA: </strong>An interesting <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-05-20/moderna-vaccine-fiasco-shows-power-of-stock-market-narratives\">observation</a> was made by Bloomberg’s market commentator John Authers; recapping this week’s price action, he observes that on Monday Moderna (MRNA) gave an upbeat assessment on the performance of its COVID drug, it then sold shares on Tuesday, and then late on Tuesday, a medical journal said Moderna did not produce data critical to assessing vaccine. The Monday story gave hopes that a second wave can be avoided, and stocks rallied; but Tuesday’s update dragged stocks lower. Authers says “the episode tells us there is more room for the market to rise, if people can be given an excuse,” and “it also shows the depth of desire for someone to come up with a vaccine that can short-circuit what looks like being at least another 12-months of nervousness, fear, ever more fractious politics, and a sluggish economy — and that the current price is based on some bearish assumptions.” Crucially, he argues that the episode demonstrates that, given so few precedents to guide traders, and given the trading community are not scientific experts, it is ‘rival narratives’ which is driving stock price action. The piece is definitely worth a read, and highlights three/four narratives which have been ‘abused’ by markets: “It’s Just A Flu” (used as a justification for minimizing the entire pandemic); “Herd Immunity” (to justify carrying on with economic activity as usual, and risking lives); “Flatten the Curve” (to justify continuing with tight lockdown measures even when they have served their purpose); and possibly “A Vaccine Will Cure Everything.”</p>",

Powell has previously said the Fed could further help companies with liquidity issues for a while, but over time, more fiscal help will be needed – a strong hint to fiscal policymakers as they debate the next tranche of stimulus. Powell on the weekend said at least three-to-six more months of government support would be required. The Fed chair seems to be arguing that further support is crucial to any recovery, and that if policymakers are careful about how the economy is reopened, and people take these social distancing measures forward, then the recovery can begin fairly soon, and job losses seen since mid-March may prove to be temporary; he also argued that, assuming there is no second wave of the coronavirus, the economy will begin to recover steadily through the second half of this year. &nbsp;</p>",

The Monday story gave hopes that a second wave can be avoided, and stocks rallied; but Tuesday’s update dragged stocks lower. Authers says “the episode tells us there is more room for the market to rise, if people can be given an excuse,” and “it also shows the depth of desire for someone to come up with a vaccine that can short-circuit what looks like being at least another 12-months of nervousness, fear, ever more fractious politics, and a sluggish economy — and that the current price is based on some bearish assumptions.” Crucially, he argues that the episode demonstrates that, given so few precedents to guide traders, and given the trading community are not scientific experts, it is ‘rival narratives’ which is driving stock price action.

One analyst said “the NPC will send a clear signal on the level of economic stimulus in the coming months,” and the stimulus “is going to be a strong one, but a runaway building boom is unlikely to happen given the long-term damage it does to the economy.” Meanwhile, there is focus on remarks from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which have suggested that central banks will need to ramp-up QE to prevent a sharp rise in bond yields, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/jpmorgan-joins-goldman-saying-more-qe-needed-to-cap-bond-yields\">Bloomberg reported</a>, stating that the level of expected increase in supply this year (around USD 2.1trln) is offsetting the USD 1.9trln demand for bonds by USD 200bln, implying upward pressure on yields, and that more issuance adds to the case for higher rates and steeper curves.</p><p><strong>US 20-YEAR BOND AUCTION AT 1PM EDT: </strong>The 20-year supply will be the first since 1986. At its quarterly refunding announcement, the US Treasury said it would finally issue its new 20-year maturities on 20th May, for a size of USD 20bln. The size was bigger than anticipated (USD 12-14bln was touted), and with heavier supply at the long-end of the curve, combined with no announcement of a 4- or 6-year tenor, resulted in sharp curve steepening in the wake of the announcement.<strong> </strong>Analysts at BMO note that takedown seen at the recent 10s and 30s auctions is an encouraging detail for Wednesday's 20-year sale, and points to a solid first auction for the new bond. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-us-to-sell-usd-20bln-of-new-20-year-bonds-at-1300-edt-1800-bst-20-05-2020\">Click here for preview</a>.</p><p><strong>APRIL FOMC MEETING MINUTES AT 2PM EDT: </strong>The minutes to the Feb’s April meeting are unlikely to be a game changer, given that the confab itself was considered a ‘holding meeting’, and there have been many Fed speakers in the three weeks that have followed, making the minutes somewhat stale (not that Fed speakers have been saying much, except they will do everything within their mandate to support the economy through this unprecedented times. And that is likely to be the underlying theme of the minutes. Elsewhere, however, we will be on the lookout for commentary on negative rates – which does not carry much favour among Fed members, though is something that they are seemingly keeping in the toolbox in case it is needed in the future – as well as any commentary on yield curve control, which analysts expect the Fed to pivot to in the months ahead to bolster its pledge to keep short-term yields anchored at historic lows for the foreseeable future. Additionally, there will likely be another call on fiscal authorities to help with the heavy lifting. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-fomc-april-2020-meeting-minutes-to-be-released-at-1400-edt-1900-bst-20-05-2020\">Click here for preview</a>.</p>",

The size was bigger than anticipated (USD 12-14bln was touted), and with heavier supply at the long-end of the curve, combined with no announcement of a 4- or 6-year tenor, resulted in sharp curve steepening in the wake of the announcement.<strong> </strong>Analysts at BMO note that takedown seen at the recent 10s and 30s auctions is an encouraging detail for Wednesday's 20-year sale, and points to a solid first auction for the new bond. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-us-to-sell-usd-20bln-of-new-20-year-bonds-at-1300-edt-1800-bst-20-05-2020\">Click here for preview</a>.</p><p><strong>APRIL FOMC MEETING MINUTES AT 2PM EDT: </strong>The minutes to the Feb’s April meeting are unlikely to be a game changer, given that the confab itself was considered a ‘holding meeting’, and there have been many Fed speakers in the three weeks that have followed, making the minutes somewhat stale (not that Fed speakers have been saying much, except they will do everything within their mandate to support the economy through this unprecedented times. And that is likely to be the underlying theme of the minutes. Elsewhere, however, we will be on the lookout for commentary on negative rates – which does not carry much favour among Fed members, though is something that they are seemingly keeping in the toolbox in case it is needed in the future – as well as any commentary on yield curve control, which analysts expect the Fed to pivot to in the months ahead to bolster its pledge to keep short-term yields anchored at historic lows for the foreseeable future. Additionally, there will likely be another call on fiscal authorities to help with the heavy lifting. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-fomc-april-2020-meeting-minutes-to-be-released-at-1400-edt-1900-bst-20-05-2020\">Click here for preview</a>.</p>",

However, weakness was seen in Fujifilm on reports its Avigan drug was not showing apparent efficacy as a coronavirus treatment and earnings releases were also a catalyst for price action with both Sharp and Mitsubishi Motors suffering from weaker results in which the latter posted a full-year loss. <strong>Hang Seng (U/C) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp.

That being said, US equity futures grind higher and nurse the losses seen following yesterday’s Moderna disappointment. Sectors are mixed with clear outperformance seen in defensives vs. cyclicals ex-IT, reflecting more risk-aversion-heavy trade. The breakdown also paints a similar picture with Healthcare the outperformer whilst Autos, Banks, and Travel &amp; Leisure all reside towards the bottom. In terms of individual movers, Fiat Chrysler (-3.2%) shares were halted amid doubts raised about the Co’s USD 6bln dividend following talks for a 3yr long EUR 6.3bln loan facility, with sources stating that Italy could look into Fiat Chrysler’s planned pay-out, with Peugeot (-3.4%) also lower in sympathy.

Hence, the Kiwi remains some distance ahead of the chasing G10 pack on the 0.6100 handle vs its US counterpart and closer to 1.0700 against the Aussie that is still hampered by deteriorating trade relations with China and a stark reality check on the retail side as sales slumped in April by more than double the magnitude of the prior month’s rise. In response, Aud/Usd has slipped back under 0.6550 after another test and rejection of recent highs around 0.6570 and now eyeing May PMIs for further direction.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR -</strong> The Franc and Euro are both holding gains relative to a broadly soft Dollar, as the DXY continues to pivot 99.500 ahead of FOMC minutes after little new from Fed chair Powell in testimony yesterday, but perhaps more impetus via his opening remarks at an event on Thursday. Eur/Usd is establishing a firm base above 1.0900 and decent option expiry interest between 109.30-35 (1 bn), while Usd/Chf straddles 0.9700 and Eur/Chf rotates either side of 1.0600 following its sharp spike from near 1.0500 multi-year lows in wake of Germany and France reaching agreement on a common EU debt funded COVID-19 rescue package.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY/GBP -</strong> All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback as the Loonie maintains momentum within 1.3960-16 parameters with ongoing assistance from firm crude prices awaiting Canadian CPI, while the Yen has pared more losses following a 3rd test of resistance just above 108.00, but crucially from a technical perspective no further approach towards the 200 DMA. Next up, Japanese trade data tomorrow before the BoJ’s bank lending inter-schedule policy meeting on Friday. In contrast, Sterling has succumbed to more ‘sell in May’ and chart-inspired downside pressure with stops, albeit light so far, tripped at 1.2225 in Cable that represents one side of in inverse head and shoulders formation, but the Pound has regained some poise post-soft UK inflation data and pre-BoE testimony to a TSC.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM -</strong> Somewhat contrasting fortunes for the Scandinavian Crowns as Eur/Sek resumes its bearish tendencies towards 10.5500, but Eur/Nok rebounds from sub-10.9000 in wake of the Riksbank’s latest FSR and a Norges Bank economist survey both highlighting the adverse impact and risks related to the coronavirus. Meanwhile, the Turkish Lira looks apprehensive in the run up to tomorrow’s CBRT rate decision even though the Bank’s swap line to Qatar has been boosted by Usd10 bn to Usd15 bn, but the SA Rand is heading back down with more purpose after breaching a prior May peak ahead of retail sales and the SARB on Thursday with another 50 bp ease seemingly priced in.</p><p>Australia Preliminary Retail Sales for April fell 17.9% vs. Prev. increase of 8.5%, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. ABS stated this was the largest seasonally adjusted decline on record with turnover in clothing, footwear, personal accessories, cafes, restaurants and takeaways around half the level of April last year, while&nbsp; the food retailing industry, which increased strongly in March, slipped 17.1% since then. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>UK debt remains relatively resilient vs peers, but in truth trade is choppy and turnover lacklustre with prices well within recent ranges awaiting a clear break or definitive change of direction. Markets are still weighing up the economic benefits of COVID-19 restrictions being gradually removed against the risk of another flare up or so-called 2nd wave without the back-stop of a reliable cure or vaccine. Nevertheless, <strong>Gilts</strong> just edged a slender new Liffe peak at 137.83 and <strong>Bunds</strong> are back in mild positive territory vs 29 ticks below par at one stage and an even deeper base on Tuesday (172.26 vs 172.51 low so far today). Meanwhile, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> have reverted to marginal bull-flattening mode even though 20 year supply looms, and perhaps taking cues from the very short end amidst further recalibration along the FFF strip to unwind negative rate expectations.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent </strong>front-month crude futures trade choppy and swing between gains and losses. WTI June expired yesterday whilst holding up above USD 30.0/bbl at USD 32.50/bbl, whilst June/July settled in backwardation – which some suggested show a clear significantly shift in sentiment MM. That being said, short-covering and low vol/open interest may have also influenced the June price action. Underlying fundamentals seem to be broadly improving, but “poor refinery margins suggest that this strength is unlikely to be sustainable in the near term.” ING says, “. We would need to see strength in refinery margins in order to persuade refiners to increase utilisation rates, but at current levels, there seems little incentive for them to do so.” On the geopolitical front, Iranian Navy said it will continue with its activities in the Persian Gulf despite US warnings, reported via ISNA, which follows remarks by the US navy that \"Armed vessels approaching within 100 meters of a US naval vessel may be interpreted as a threat\". Private inventories yesterday printed a headline draw of 4.84mln barrels. Investors will be eyeing the DoEs for confirmation. Elsewhere in the States, North Dakota’s oil and gas regulators will be meeting today to discuss mandated cuts, albeit little is expected from the meeting and the State only pumps ~1.4mln BPD vs. Texas’ 5mln BPD. In terms of metals, <strong>spot gold</strong> trades modestly firmer around USD 1750/oz and seems to be deriving strength from a weaker Dollar amid light news flow in early European trade. <strong>Copper</strong> similarly remains little changed within a tight intraday band.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks (w/e 15th May) -4.8mln (exp. +1.2mln, prev. -0.7mln)</strong></p><p>Russia has resumed oil production exports to North Korea, according to Interfax/ (Ifx)</p><p>Standard Chartered raised its gold price forecast to USD 1689/oz for 2020 and sees prices averaging USD 1750/oz In Q4.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>A choppy and overall mixed session thus far in the European equity space [Eurostoxx 50 +0.3%], with little conviction amid light news flow and despite a mostly positive APAC handover. That being said, US equity futures grind higher and nurse the losses seen following yesterday’s Moderna disappointment. Sectors are mixed with clear outperformance seen in defensives vs. cyclicals ex-IT, reflecting more risk-aversion-heavy trade. The breakdown also paints a similar picture with Healthcare the outperformer whilst Autos, Banks, and Travel &amp; Leisure all reside towards the bottom. In terms of individual movers, Fiat Chrysler (-3.2%) shares were halted amid doubts raised about the Co’s USD 6bln dividend following talks for a 3yr long EUR 6.3bln loan facility, with sources stating that Italy could look into Fiat Chrysler’s planned pay-out, with Peugeot (-3.4%) also lower in sympathy. On the flip-side Marks &amp; Spencer (+4.5%) sees post-earnings gains after revenue printed in-line with forecasts. Fresenius SE (+3.9%) holds onto gains on the back of a broker upgrade at Morgan Stanley.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>NZD/AUD - Hot on the heels of RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand’s wait-and-see policy guidance on Tuesday, Governor Orr has echoed sentiments overnight by stating that negative rates are not on the current agenda, but an option for consideration much later. Hence, the Kiwi remains some distance ahead of the chasing G10 pack on the 0.6100 handle vs its US counterpart and closer to 1.0700 against the Aussie that is still hampered by deteriorating trade relations with China and a stark reality check on the retail side as sales slumped in April by more than double the magnitude of the prior month’s rise. In response, Aud/Usd has slipped back under 0.6550 after another test and rejection of recent highs around 0.6570 and now eyeing May PMIs for further direction.</p><p>CHF/EUR - The Franc and Euro are both holding gains relative to a broadly soft Dollar, as the DXY continues to pivot 99.500 ahead of FOMC minutes after little new from Fed chair Powell in testimony yesterday, but perhaps more impetus via his opening remarks at an event on Thursday. Eur/Usd is establishing a firm base above 1.0900 and decent option expiry interest between 109.30-35 (1 bn), while Usd/Chf straddles 0.9700 and Eur/Chf rotates either side of 1.0600 following its sharp spike from near 1.0500 multi-year lows in wake of Germany and France reaching agreement on a common EU debt funded COVID-19 rescue package.</p><p>CAD/JPY/GBP - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback as the Loonie maintains momentum within 1.3960-16 parameters with ongoing assistance from firm crude prices awaiting Canadian CPI, while the Yen has pared more losses following a 3rd test of resistance just above 108.00, but crucially from a technical perspective no further approach towards the 200 DMA. Next up, Japanese trade data tomorrow before the BoJ’s bank lending inter-schedule policy meeting on Friday. In contrast, Sterling has succumbed to more ‘sell in May’ and chart-inspired downside pressure with stops, albeit light so far, tripped at 1.2225 in Cable that represents one side of in inverse head and shoulders formation, but the Pound has regained some poise post-soft UK inflation data and pre-BoE testimony to a TSC.</p><p>SCANDI/EM - Somewhat contrasting fortunes for the Scandinavian Crowns as Eur/Sek resumes its bearish tendencies towards 10.5500, but Eur/Nok rebounds from sub-10.9000 in wake of the Riksbank’s latest FSR and a Norges Bank economist survey both highlighting the adverse impact and risks related to the coronavirus. Meanwhile, the Turkish Lira looks apprehensive in the run up to tomorrow’s CBRT rate decision even though the Bank’s swap line to Qatar has been boosted by Usd10 bn to Usd15 bn, but the SA Rand is heading back down with more purpose after breaching a prior May peak ahead of retail sales and the SARB on Thursday with another 50 bp ease seemingly priced in..</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>UK debt remains relatively resilient vs peers, but in truth trade is choppy and turnover lacklustre with prices well within recent ranges awaiting a clear break or definitive change of direction. Markets are still weighing up the economic benefits of COVID-19 restrictions being gradually removed against the risk of another flare up or so called 2nd wave without the back-stop of a reliable cure or vaccine. Nevertheless, Gilts just edged a slender new Liffe peak at 137.83 and Bunds are back in mild positive territory vs 29 ticks below par at one stage and an even deeper base on Tuesday (172.26 vs 172.51 low so far today). Meanwhile, US Treasuries have reverted to marginal bull-flattening mode even though 20 year supply looms, and perhaps taking cues from the very short end amidst further recalibration along the FFF strip to unwind negative rate expectations.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month crude futures trade choppy and swing between gains and losses. <strong>WTI</strong> June expired yesterday whilst holding up above USD 30.0/bbl at USD 32.50/bbl, whilst June/July settled in backwardation – which some suggested show a clear significantly shift in sentiment MM. That being said, short-covering and low vol/open interest may have also influenced the June price action. Underlying fundamentals seem to be broadly improving, but “poor refinery margins suggest that this strength is unlikely to be sustainable in the near term.” ING says, “. We would need to see strength in refinery margins in order to persuade refiners to increase utilisation rates, but at current levels, there seems little incentive for them to do so.” On the geopolitical front, Iranian Navy said it will continue with its activities in the Persian Gulf despite US warnings, reported via ISNA, which follows remarks by the US navy that \"Armed vessels approaching within 100 meters of a US naval vessel may be interpreted as a threat\". Private inventories yesterday printed a headline draw of 4.84mln barrels. Investors will be eyeing the DoEs for confirmation. Elsewhere in the States, North Dakota’s oil and gas regulators will be meeting today to discuss mandated cuts, albeit little is expected from the meeting and the State only pumps ~1.4mln BPD vs. Texas’ 5mln BPD. In terms of metals, spot gold trades modestly firmer around USD 1750/oz and seems to be deriving strength from a weaker Dollar amid light news flow in early European trade. Copper similarly remains little changed within a tight intraday band.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p>The minutes to the Feb’s April meeting are unlikely to be a game changer, given that the confab itself was considered a ‘holding meeting’, and there have been many Fed speakers in the three weeks that have followed, making the minutes somewhat stale (not that Fed speakers have been saying much, except they will do everything within their mandate to support the economy through this unprecedented times. And that is likely to be the underlying theme of the minutes. Elsewhere, however, we will be on the lookout for commentary on negative rates – which does not carry much favour among Fed members, though is something that they are seemingly keeping in the toolbox in case it is needed in the future – as well as any commentary on yield curve control, which analysts expect the Fed to pivot to in the months ahead to bolster its pledge to keep short-term yields anchored at historic lows for the foreseeable future. Additionally, there will likely be another call on fiscal authorities to help with the heavy lifting. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FOMC APRIL MEETING RECAP:</strong> The Fed’s 30th April rate decision was as expected; the federal funds rate target and the interest on excess reserves were left unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and 0.10% respectively. The Fed reiterated its commitment to keep rates at current low levels until the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its inflation and labour market goals. One key omission from its statement was references to specific amounts of asset purchases (previously it indicated that it would buy “at least” USD 500bln of Treasuries and at least USD 200bln of MBS); instead, it said it would purchase in amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, which might be taken as a pledge for limitless QE until the central bank is confident that its mandates can be met – in his press conference, Chair Powell said the Fed was waiting to see how economic conditions unfold before committing. Some traders were disappointed by the lack of explicit forward guidance within the statement; Powell reiterated that rates would remain low until the economy has ‘weathered’ the COVID impact, echoing the statement. He provided what has become customary warnings about the impending collapse of economic metrics in Q2, as a result of the virus, but thinks that Q3 might see ‘substantial growth’. The Fed chair also emphasised a willingness to do more if required. And in terms of the outlook, Powell identified medium-term risks: the virus and bringing it under control; the possibility of damage to the productive capacity of the economy; the global dimension, where negative data abroad can weigh on the US; Powell believes that the Fed has the policies to address these, but not perfectly. Another key omission was clues about yield curve control; analysts believe that the Fed will need to eventually implement a Japan/Australia style yield curve control policy that keeps a lid on shorter-dated Treasury yields – this policy would be the strong arm to bolster the central bank’s guidance that rates will be kept low. This policy is expected to be hinted at in the months ahead, likely from June, as the Fed gains more clarity on how the virus will play out. Additionally, desks believe that the Fed will continue to taper its (what has been front-loaded) asset purchases (currently running at an average clip of around USD 50bln/week) to something like USD 60-80bln per month (NOTE: this publication is released before the NY Fed update on Friday afternoon, where it may again lower the pace of purchases). However, don’t expect any updates until the aforementioned clarity can be seen; for what it is worth, Powell emphasised that the Fed would not be removing the punch bowl too quickly, or any time soon. One theme that has been in vogue in recent days is negative rates, after some Federal Funds Futures contracts rose above par, signalling a non-zero probability of negative rates ahead; Powell and Co. have heavily leaned-back against this policy tool next week; analysts are of the view that the tool would only be used if the Fed had exhausted all other options. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>POWELL SENATE TESTIMONY: </strong>Fed chair Powell repeated his pledge to maintain rates at near-zero levels until the economy had weathered the crisis, and emphasise that the passage of the CARES Act was critical to the Fed’s ability to expand credit programmes to help support the economy, and as a result of these actions, market function has improved. Elsewhere, there was little of note, in terms of new developments, within Powell’s remarks; the Fed is continuing to look into ways to accommodate additional borrowers, and is particularly looking at extending borrowing to states with low populations, the Fed chair told lawmakers. He also said that he expects the central bank’s balance sheet to gradually shrink over time; what matters is the size of the balance sheet relative to the size of the US economy, and the balance sheet does not yet raise financial stability concerns; however, analysts have viewed the balance sheet debate is a debate for another post-pandemic day. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>FISCAL ACTION: </strong>Powell has previously said the Fed could further help companies with liquidity issues for a while, but over time, more fiscal help will be needed – a strong hint to fiscal policymakers as they debate the next tranche of stimulus. Powell on the weekend said at least three-to-six more months of government support would be required. The Fed chair seems to be arguing that further support is crucial to any recovery, and that if policymakers are careful about how the economy is reopened, and people take these social distancing measures forward, then the recovery can begin fairly soon, and job losses seen since mid-March may prove to be temporary; he also argued that, assuming there is no second wave of the coronavirus, the economy will begin to recover steadily through the second half of this year. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES: </strong>Fed chair Powell has pushed-back heavily against the idea of negative rates, citing the mixed evidence that exists on its efficacy. However, it is worth noting that a lot of Powell’s language has clearly been structured to leave the option open to the Fed in the future, and other Fed participants (like Kashkari) have also retained this optionality. Such an approach seems sensible, analysts argue; the Fed would be able to exhaust other policy options first before resorting to more aggressive policies. The message, therefore, seems to be that negative rates are not on the radar in the near-term, but the market and policymakers seem to be retaining a non-zero chance of seeing them next year.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>20-YEAR ANNOUNCEMENT: </strong>The 20-year supply will be the first since 1986. At its quarterly refunding announcement, the US Treasury said it would finally issue its new 20-year maturities on 20th May, for a size of USD 20bln. The size was bigger than anticipated (USD 12-14bln was touted), and with heavier supply at the long-end of the curve, combined with no announcement of a 4- or 6-year tenor, resulted in sharp curve steepening in the wake of the announcement.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>20-YEAR SECTOR: </strong>UBS estimates that the market has cheapened the 20-year sector, noting that the sector was cheap versus 10s30s curve as well, although now seems fair; hence, UBS says, it is cheap outright. “In general, we think the sector has already been cheap due to less liquidity and the fact that the Fed owns a large portion of the issues in the 20-year sector so its future purchases are limited.” UBS argues that, given where the 3.375% May 2044 bond is trading, fair value for the 20-year issue is implied at around 1.27%; If we assume 1-2bps of liquidity premia for the new issue, the issue is likely to trade at 1.26%, the bank writes, speculating that the issue should see strong demand since a lot of indexers and Asset Liability Management hedgers will need to buy it. “You can pick-up a lot of yield as the steepest part of 10s30s curve (around 70bps) where fair value is actually 10s20s curve (60bps),” UBS says, noting that the 30-year bond has a duration of 23-years, and comparatively, the 20-year will have a duration of 17.6yrs (5.4yrs shorter), and therefore, it makes more sense to extend duration with a 20-year than a 30- year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HOW THE AUCTION MIGHT PERFORM: </strong>Analysts at BMO note that takedown seen at the recent 10s and 30s auctions is an encouraging detail for Wednesday's 20-year sale, and points to a solid first auction for the new bond. And the sale may garner decent foreign demand, given that the return in Treasuries hedged back into yen is attractive, and recent reports have highlighted that 10s were once again popular among Japanese investors; what will be notable is whether the positive FX hedged yield Japanese investors can earn in the 10-year sector can translate to 20s, BMO says.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AFTER THE AUCTION: </strong>Post-auction on Wednesday May 20th, into month-end, UBS recommends a 10s20s curve flatteners, arguing that we are likely to see larger than normal index extension for the end of month rebalancing due to heavy long-end issuance this month.\"</p>",

However, as US participants returned, hedge fund reallocation flows were said by one desk to have continued to exert pressure on USTs, creating somewhat of a tug-of-war with buyers in Asia.

However, weakness was seen in Fujifilm on reports its Avigan drug was not showing apparent efficacy as a coronavirus treatment and earnings releases were also a catalyst for price action with both Sharp and Mitsubishi Motors suffering from weaker results in which the latter posted a full-year loss. Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) mirrored the choppy trade after the PBoC kept its Loan Prime Rates unchanged as expected and following the verbal jousting between the world’s 2 largest economies, in which the Chinese Foreign Ministry responded to US President Trump’s letter to the WHO and claimed it was an attempt to mislead the public to smear China and tries to shift blame of its own \"incompetent\" response. Finally, 10yr JGBs attempted to nurse the prior day’s losses following the recent rebound in T-notes and following stronger results at the 20yr JGB auction although the gains were eventually reversed amid outperformance in Japanese stocks.</p>",

Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are kept afloat amid anticipation of looming BoJ support later this week, and atipodeans are also mildly higher after a firmer than expected reference rate setting by the PBoC and following comments by RBNZ Governor Orr who noted they are prepared to go negative but not at this time and a lot later.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs nurse the prior day’s losses following the recent rebound in T-notes and anticipation of BoJ support later this week, but with gains capped amid the the outperformance in Japanese stocks and ahead of a 20yr auction.</p>",
