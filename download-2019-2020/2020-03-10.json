(CNBC)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Markets staged a rebound from yesterday’s heavy sell-off as US President Trump stated he is considering cutting or postponing payroll tax, alongside suggestions Saudi and Russia could meet soon. The announcement aided a risk on environment throughout the EU session and saw ES (H0) futures hit limit up, prior to the US cash open. However, gains reversed as CNBC reported the White House is not ready to roll out specific economic proposals in response to the coronavirus, where inside officials were stunned by his announcement. Although, in flip-flop trade, risk assets caught a bid in the final hour of cash trade as US President Trump emerged from a meeting with Capitol Hill and seems as if he is to continue pushing for a payroll tax cut/deferral, meanwhile both Democrats and Republicans agreed on the urgency for a bipartisan agreement, however some senators held mixed opinions on the economic stimulus package. Energy stocks (XOP, XLE) found a rebound with oil prices following the turmoil on Monday, participants are still generally cautious on the group given the demand and supply backdrop, however. The move higher in yields also sore somewhat of a rebound in Financials (BKX, XLF), although strength was faded somewhat. Tesla (TSLA) and Wynn (WYNN) were some of the names that spiked higher on the open amid reprieve from recent selling – note Tesla also announced the production of its one millionth car. SPX +4.9% at 2882, NDX +5.3% at 8372, DJI +4.9% at 25018.</p><p>The TPLEX bear steepened amid a (dead-cat?) bounce back in the equity complex, although yields were off their highs by settlement in another wide-ranging day, particularly in the long-end. Note that US equity futures hit their 5% limit ups in the pre-market alongside rising rates, before drifting lower, which Treasuries found a bid on the back of, as desks noted real money behind equity and oil sales. However, the risk aversion found its limit at the tail-end of European trade and yields then rose again, although not as high as earlier in the session. Note that there was some knee-jerk selling pressure in the belly of the curve after the 3-year Treasury auction tailed by 2.7bps, with a weaker than average B/C ratio, seeing Dealers takedown a larger than usual portion of the offering – coming ahead of the 10-year and 30-year auctions on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. By settlement, the 2-year yield had risen 15bps, 10-year yield +25bps, and 30-year yield +30bps. US T-note futures (H0) settled 1 point 24 ticks lower at 137-17+.</p>",

The announcement aided a risk on environment throughout the EU session and saw ES (H0) futures hit limit up, prior to the US cash open. However, gains reversed as CNBC reported the White House is not ready to roll out specific economic proposals in response to the coronavirus, where inside officials were stunned by his announcement. Although, in flip-flop trade, risk assets caught a bid in the final hour of cash trade as US President Trump emerged from a meeting with Capitol Hill and seems as if he is to continue pushing for a payroll tax cut/deferral, meanwhile both Democrats and Republicans agreed on the urgency for a bipartisan agreement, however some senators held mixed opinions on the economic stimulus package. Sources stated the two options would be to waive the payroll tax through to year-end or to make the cut permanent.&nbsp; Energy prices saw a slight reversal from yesterday with Brent around USD 37/bbl at settlement from lows yesterday of USD 31.02/bbl as OPEC delegates downplay the Saudi v Russia price war, reassuring us it is still too early to give up the alliance. The energy rebound saw an initial 20-30% gain in the worst-hit energy names yesterday (OXY, MRO), however on the open the gains slumped, and MRO headed back towards unchanged levels. The Treasury curve saw yields rise, albeit off highs, with the 30-year reclaiming the 1% figure, however, the rest of the curve remains well beneath. DXY benefitted from the overnight trump comments although remains off highs heading into Asia trade with participants eyeing a 17:30 ET press briefing from VP Pence for any potential details on the potential tax cuts/deferral.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLED USD 3.23 HIGHER AT USD 34.66/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 2.86 HIGHER AT USD 37.22/BBL: </strong>Energy prices overnight experienced some underlying support from OPEC delegates downplaying the expanding rift between Saudi and Russia, as they noted it is too early to give up on the alliance. That being said, Saudi Aramco’s CEO stated that it will supply its customers with 12.3mln BPD of oil starting April 1st – a number higher than the touted step-by-step increase as per sources, which noted the Kingdom could raise output to 11mln BPD before further ramping production. As such, energy futures came under belated pressure at the time. Contracts then found mild reprieve amidst comments from the Russian Energy Minister who noted Moscow does not rule out join action with OPEC, despite also stating that Russian companies may boost oil output by up to 300k BPD and has potential to increase by 500k BPD – in fitting with comments from Russia’s Rosneft yesterday. Novak also noted of the next joint meeting to take place in May/June; OPEC’s website has scheduled this for June 10th. Shortly after, Saudi Energy Minister said he fails to see the wisdom in holding the OPEC meeting in June only to demonstrate failures in dealing with the ongoing crisis. Russia’s Kremlin remained optimistic and noted that a return to OPEC discussions with Saudi is still a possibility and noted volatility in oil prices will likely continue for a while, but this was expected and accounted for. Sources also stated that the Russian Energy Ministry has called a meeting with Russian oil companies for Wednesday which is expected to discuss future co-operation with OPEC, timings unknown. Amidst the backdrop of an OPEC+ break-up, the Iraq oil minister stated that he is in contact with other OPEC+ members to discuss ways to stop the collapse in oil prices. The weekly US energy inventories would normally draw investors’ attention, although given the environment, are unlikely to cause much stir, nonetheless, the private inventory report is due later on Tuesday ahead of the EIA release on Wednesday, current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks +2.3mln, gasoline -2.5mln and distillates -1.9mln.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19 RESPONSE: </strong>The<strong> </strong>White House is not ready to roll out specific economic proposals in its response to the widening impact of the coronavirus outbreak, according to admin officials cited by CNBC, which put pressure on risk assets. CNBC noted that a lot will depend on how the administration’s ideas were digested by Senate Republicans at their meeting on the Hill on Tuesday, where its possible details could be revealed at 17:30 EDT in the Task Force, although highlighted that anything involving spending or taxes will require congressional action, thus removing the immediacy of such policy. Note that Trump briefly spoke to reporters after the meeting and failed to provide any details, resorting to rhetoric that the meeting was “great” and work was being done. President Trump said overnight that he will speak about possible payroll tax relief with Congress and is working with industries including airline and cruise ship industries. However, an NY Times report suggested that Trump and advisers are considering using, as just one option under review, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a vehicle to deliver funds to stimulate the economy. A WSJ reporter also said the administration has been discussing a possible 90-day suspension of payroll tax. Meanwhile as the outbreak deepens in the US, NY Governor Cuomo announced the establishment of a containment area in part of the New York suburb, New Rochelle, to stop the virus spread, where National Guard will be deployed in the area which will last two weeks, including school closures. Furthermore, Washington state is mulling mandatory measures to contain COVID-19, according to Governor Inslee, who expects a dramatic rise in cases without \"real action\". In Europe, ECB President Lagarde demanded an imminent fiscal reaction in her call with EU leaders, meanwhile EU Commission Chief Von Der Leyen stated an investment fund will be set up to tackle the virus, which will see as much as EUR 25bln. Over in France, President Macron stated EU leaders agreed to take all measures required to avoid instability and a spokesperson noted the EU budgetary measures are needed in response to the coronavirus and the EU must give signal it is ready to act and that a response cannot only be a monetary one. German Parliament is to reportedly make up to EUR 1bln in additional funds available for the coronavirus, according to DPA News citing the CDU head, meanwhile separate reports suggested Germany is weighing bank capital reliefs. Italy has reportedly suspended payments on mortgages across the whole country and is looking at a EUR 16bln stimulus package and raising the deficit target to just under 3%, from 2.2%; sources last night suggested it could be increased to 2.8%.</p><p><strong>* CASE UPDATE: </strong>US CDC reported 696 cases (prev. 462), 25 deaths (prev. 19) - as of March 9th at 16:00. Italian death toll rises to 631 from 463 on Monday; total cases at 10,149 (prev. 9172). Spain reports 1622 total coronavirus cases (prev. 1204).</p><p><strong>* UK BUDGET PREVIEW:</strong> Ever since gaining a commanding 80-seat majority in the December 2019 election, expectations have mounted over the government opening-up the spending taps to help boost investment post-Brexit. However, the recent outbreak of COVID19 has shifted the UK fiscal outlook and as such, this week’s update from newly-appointed Chancellor Sunak will likely be geared more towards tackling the fallout of the virus. Note, the budget will be presented on Wednesday alongside a limited set of OBR forecasts, with an additional set of OBR forecasts to be published on Friday. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24048/download\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 1 POINT 24 TICKS LOWER AT 137-17+. </strong>The TPLEX bear steepened amid a (dead-cat?) bounce back in the equity complex, although yields were off their highs by settlement in another wide-ranging day, particularly in the long-end. Note that US equity futures hit their 5% limit ups in the pre-market alongside rising rates, before drifting lower, which Treasuries found a bid on the back of, as desks noted real money behind equity and oil sales. However, the risk aversion found its limit at the tail-end of European trade and yields then rose again, although not as high as earlier in the session. Note that there was some knee-jerk selling pressure in the belly of the curve after the 3-year Treasury auction tailed by 2.7bps, with a weaker than average B/C ratio, seeing Dealers takedown a larger than usual portion of the offering – coming ahead of the 10-year and 30-year auctions on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. By settlement, the 2-year yield had risen 15bps, 10-year yield +25bps, and 30-year yield +30bps.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +3.6% at 2845, NDX +3.96% at 8263, DJI +3.5% at 24,684; <strong>SECTORS:</strong> Technology +6.6%, Financials +6%, Consumer Discretionary +5.4%, Industrials +5.2%, Real Estate +5%, Energy +5%, Communication Svs. +4.53%, Materials +3.9%, Health Care +3.5%, Consumer Staples +2.9%, Utilities +1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Energy stocks (XOP, XLE) found a rebound with oil prices following the turmoil on Monday, participants are still generally cautious on the group given the demand and supply backdrop, however. The move higher in yields also sore somewhat of a rebound in Financials (BKX, XLF), although strength was faded somewhat. Tesla (TSLA) and Wynn (WYNN) were some of the names that spiked higher on the open amid reprieve from recent selling – note Tesla also announced the production of its one millionth car. Cypress Semiconductor (CY) surged by close to 50% after it passed a US regulatory hurdle for its proposed merger with Infineon (IFX GY). Occidental (OXY) found a second round of strength as investors warmed to it slashing its dividend to USD 0.11/shr from 0.79 as well as cutting its capex guide by a couple of billion. Airlines (AAL, UAL, DAL) were bid following comments from Trump that the administration would be supporting the industry, as well as cruise companies (CCL, RCL, NCLH). Dick’s (DKS) surged after a strong quarter. COVID-19 “beneficiaries” (ZM, GILD, VZ, WMT, CLX, PTON) were offered as participants pared recent moves somewhat.</p><p><strong>* NORGES BANK Q1 REGIONAL NETWORK REPORT: </strong>Typically, the survey is heavily incorporated in the next Norges Bank rate decision which is on March 19th. However, while the remarks are still of note the main survey period being January 27th to February 14th makes them less so; as the period will not entirely incorporate the scale of the coronavirus. Nonetheless, the Networks contacts highlight that activity growth has continued to decline throughout winter and they expect growth to continue to drop for the next 6-months. More notably, the Bank elected to undertake an additional phone survey between March 4th-6th which is not included in the published figures, in this additional survey the latest information is suggesting that the virus will weigh on activity in the Norwegian business sector ahead; with a third of participants revising their growth outlook down in recent weeks. Looking ahead to next week’s rate decision, where a number of banks have recently changed their call from an unchanged meeting to a cut, given the ongoing headwinds the virus presents, soft domestic CPI in February which is in contrast to January’s surprisingly strong number and the knock-on impact of the recent sell-off in oil prices. Note, currently the Norges Bank’s rate path sees the rate left unchanged at 1.5% for the entirety of the period; albeit, with a very mild hiking bias incorporated.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> The dollar saw hefty gains today following the prior day sell off taking its cues from stimulus package ideas, higher yields and an outflow of havens (JPY, CHF) as markets saw a risk-friendly tone; a bounce from yesterday’s decline. <strong>USDJPY</strong> reclaimed 105.50 from lows of 102, meanwhile, <strong>EURCHF</strong> reclaimed 1.06, just. <strong>XAU</strong> also saw the same direction as other havens amid the improved risk appetite which saw the precious metal consolidate around the 1650 handle heading into overnight trade. <strong>GBP</strong> traded lower ahead of the budget tomorrow, meanwhile <strong>EUR</strong> took ques from a firmer dollar; Italy cases continue to rocket. <strong>AUD &amp; NZD</strong> lower against the buck with the former undermined by a downbeat NAB business survey, meanwhile NZD likely impacted by dovish commentary from Governor Orr who suggested negative rates or ZIRP cannot be ruled out, noting the steps being considered includes forward guidance, negative rates and rates swaps. However, the Governor noted zero bound for rates is far from the most likely outcome. <strong>EMFX</strong> was generally firmer across the board in a reversal from yesterday’s price action. <strong>RUB </strong>retraced some of the heavy declines from Monday as oil saw a bounce while the CBR announced pre-emptive measures where it will sell foreign currency to lower market volatility and it will conduct RUB 500bln worth of repo operations and increase currency swap operations limit to USD 5bln today. <strong>KRW</strong> also firmer as it takes measures to fight off the coronavirus where the BoK noted it will actively use all available tools to stabilise markets, noting it is paying close attention to FX, adding it will use loans and open market operations to support SME’s.</p>",

Note that US equity futures hit their 5% limit ups in the pre-market alongside rising rates, before drifting lower, which Treasuries found a bid on the back of, as desks noted real money behind equity and oil sales. However, the risk aversion found its limit at the tail-end of European trade and yields then rose again, although not as high as earlier in the session. Note that there was some knee-jerk selling pressure in the belly of the curve after the 3-year Treasury auction tailed by 2.7bps, with a weaker than average B/C ratio, seeing Dealers takedown a larger than usual portion of the offering – coming ahead of the 10-year and 30-year auctions on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. By settlement, the 2-year yield had risen 15bps, 10-year yield +25bps, and 30-year yield +30bps.</p>",

That being said, Saudi Aramco’s CEO stated that it will supply its customers with 12.3mln BPD of oil starting April 1st – a number higher than the touted step-by-step increase as per sources, which noted the Kingdom could raise output to 11mln BPD before further ramping production. As such, energy futures came under belated pressure at the time. Contracts then found mild reprieve amidst comments from the Russian Energy Minister who noted Moscow does not rule out join action with OPEC, despite also stating that Russian companies may boost oil output by up to 300k BPD and has potential to increase by 500k BPD – in fitting with comments from Russia’s Rosneft yesterday. Novak also noted of the next joint meeting to take place in May/June; OPEC’s website has scheduled this for June 10th. Shortly after, Saudi Energy Minister said he fails to see the wisdom in holding the OPEC meeting in June only to demonstrate failures in dealing with the ongoing crisis. Russia’s Kremlin remained optimistic and noted that a return to OPEC discussions with Saudi is still a possibility and noted volatility in oil prices will likely continue for a while, but this was expected and accounted for. Sources also stated that the Russian Energy Ministry has called a meeting with Russian oil companies for Wednesday which is expected to discuss future co-operation with OPEC, timings unknown. Amidst the backdrop of an OPEC+ break-up, the Iraq oil minister stated that he is in contact with other OPEC+ members to discuss ways to stop the collapse in oil prices. The weekly US energy inventories would normally draw investors’ attention, although given the environment, are unlikely to cause much stir, nonetheless, the private inventory report is due later on Tuesday ahead of the EIA release on Wednesday, current expectations (bbls) see crude stocks +2.3mln, gasoline -2.5mln and distillates -1.9mln.</li></ul>",

However, the index has not been able to sustain recovery momentum above 96.000 and from a technical perspective a ‘close’ below 95.879 (minor Fib retracement from 2020 high) would be destructive.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Scandinavian Crowns are still holding net gains vs G10 rivals, but some distance from best levels as the risk revival runs out of steam, with Eur/Nok nudging back above 10.9000 and Eur/Sek eyeing 10.8000 vs sub-10.7300/10.7200 respectively at one stage. The Norwegian Crown is still being propped by the aforementioned rebound in oil rather than any bearish impulses via hefty CPI misses against consensus and a regional survey flagging downside economic growth and activity, without taking into account the worst of the hit from nCoV. Meanwhile, Riksbank comments continue err on the side of unconventional policy instead of returning to NIRP and little sign on any emergency inter-meeting move.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/AUD/CHF/NZD/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>The Yen remains the major laggard amidst unwinding safe-haven positioning, albeit well above lows circa 105.25 amidst the late EU wobble in risk, but Cable is now extending its retreat from 1.3200 peaks through 1.2950 on pre-UK budget caution and persistent jitters over the prospect of a hard Brexit. Elsewhere, the Aussie has been undermined by a downbeat NAB business survey and the Franc is caught between pillar and post as a safe-haven prone to SNB intervention next Thursday or before if it becomes more than highly valued in the run up to the next official quarterly policy review. On that note, RBNZ chat about ZIRP or even negative rates as a lower bound in preference to alternative stimulus from Governor Orr have been taken on board by the Kiwi and the Euro awaits this week’s ECB meeting with new Staff forecasts to see what the GC might do to mitigate the growing COVID-19 threat that could be coordinated with EU fiscal measures. Finally on the major stage, an element of stabilisation in crude has cushioned the Loonie from deeper post-BoC rate cut losses and a breach of 1.3700.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>More volatile trade for regional currencies, though not as choppy and ultimately bad as yesterday as the Rouble regains over 3.5% vs the Buck alongside Brent and others are propped by direct intervention. However, the Mxn and Czk are underperforming awaiting a presser from Mexico’s Finance Minister and after the CNB opened the door for a cut in March.</p>",

The meeting takes place against a backdrop of severe economic uncertainty in which the full extent of the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown. However, containment efforts across the continent have certainly impaired economic activity and as such, heightened calls for stimulus from the Governing Council. It remains to be seen whether the ECB will adopt a wait-and-see approach or unveil supportive measures, which could include rate reductions, expansion of the APP, adjustments to tiering thresholds, sweetening of the terms of existing TLTROs, financing measures for SMEs.</p>",

Overnight, APAC bourses reflected a similarly conciliatory tone as stocks recovered following a mixed open – with desks pointing to hopes of US stimulus announcements in the form of payroll tax relief. European bourses got off to a shaky start with futures erasing a chunk of its overnight gains ahead of the cash open before reversing course to fresh session highs at the time of writing. The Italian bourse is conforming to the broad gains in the region despite Italy’s country-wide lockdown. The index remains buoyed by a raft of Italian stimulus including a ramp-up in measures to EUR 10bln from EUR 7.5bln. Meanwhile, sectors trade in positive territory and reflect a “risk-on” mood as cyclicals fare better than defensive. The energy sector outperforms following the prior session’s hefty losses and as the oil complex rebounds, with similar action seen in financials. Stoxx 600 movers largely reflect an inverse of yesterday. Oil giants Shell (+12.5%), Total (+9.0%) and BP (+8.5%) amongst the top gainers. On that front, Exane BNP remains of the view that cash dividends will continue to see support despite yesterday’s sharp sell-off in oil and energy names, with preferred names remaining BP, Total and Equinor. In terms of more micro-movers, Deutsche Post (+6.3%) shares are supported amid an increase in YY Q4 revenue and a reaffirmance of its 2022 guidance. Italian-listed Diasorin (+17.4%) rose to the top of the FTSE MIB as the Co. completed its studies regarding a launch of coronavirus tests by end-March.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NOK/JPY -</strong> Still flanking the G10 ranks, but the Norwegian Krona is now in pole position and Yen at the back of the pack in contrast to Monday when oil prices were tanking and risk aversion rife. Eur/Nok has recoiled further from nigh on 11.0000 to sub-10.7550 at one stage and almost oblivious to significantly weaker than expected inflation data or a downbeat regional survey even before the full extent of the coronavirus contagion has been taken into consideration. Conversely, Usd/Jpy has rebounded from near 101.00 yesterday to just over 105.00 as broad sentiment stabilises alongside crude, despite more exchanges between Saudi Arabia and Russia on the supply front.</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The Dollar has benefited from the relative calm in financial markets, partly instilled by US pledges via President Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to unveil big fiscal support measures, which in turn have flipped Treasuries back into bear steepening mode and eroded some appeal from safer currency and other havens. Hence, the DXY has pared losses from yesterday’s new 94.650 ytd base and briefly topped 96.000 within a 96.006-95.199 range.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/GBP/NZD/AUD -</strong> All softer vs the Greenback due to the aforementioned turnaround in mood from extreme depression, with the Franc below 0.9300 again, Euro sub-1.1400, Cable under 1.3100 and Antipodeans losing a degree of their yield appeal from 0.6600+ and 0.6350+ respectively overnight. The Aussie also had drops in NAB business conditions and confidence to digest, while the Kiwi is absorbing comments from RBNZ Governor Orr indicating that there is more room to reduce the OCR (to zero or even negative if needed) rather than resorting to unconventional policy easing.</p><p><strong>CAD/SEK</strong> -The Loonie is deriving some comfort from oil finding a base (for the time being at least) between 1.3706-1.3608 extremes vs its US counterpart and the Swedish Crown has regrouped amidst more Riksbank guidance steering away from a reversal in the repo rate in favour of QE if it need to take emergency policy action.

Furthermore, Orr suggested need to be considered and realistic as to how effective rate changes will be in buffering the economy and that they will continue to use conventional policy until it is exhausted such as when OCR reaches 0%.

Gilts, Bunds and US Treasuries are all in the region of 1 ¾ to 2 points adrift as oil prices bounce and more Governments commit funds to help fight the economic impact of VOVID-19 alongside ongoing efforts to stop the outbreak reaching pandemic proportions, like Italy’s nationwide lock down.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>A day of respite, consolidation and potential short covering in the energy markets following yesterday’s violent Saudi-induced sell-off. </strong>WTI front month futures found an overnight base at ~USD 30/bbl and Brent April contracts touched APAC lows of just under USD 33.50/bbl – ahead of Saudi-fuelled lows around USD 27.40/bbl and USD 31.45/bbl respectively. Prices could also be experiencing some underlying support from OPEC delegates downplaying the expanding rift between Saudi and Russia, as they noted it is too early to give up on the alliance. That being said, Saudi Aramco’s CEO stated that it will supply its customers with 12.3mln BPD of oil starting April 1st – a number higher than the touted step-by-step increase as per sources, which noted the Kingdom could raise output to 11mln BPD before ramping production. As such, energy futures came under belated pressure and have been pushed to session lows of USD 30.20/bbl for WTI and USD 35.00/bbl for Brent, but nonetheless remain in positive territory following the gap higher at the reopen of electronic trade. Prices then found mild reprieve amidst comments from the Russian Energy Minister as he noted Moscow does not rule out join action with OPEC, despite also noting that Russian companies may boost oil output by up to 300k BPD and has potential to increase by 500k BPD – in fitting with comments from Russia’s Rosneft yesterday. Novak also noted of the next joint meeting to take place in May/June; OPEC’s website has scheduled this for June 10th. Sources stated that Russian Energy Ministry has called a meeting with Russian oil companies for tomorrow which is expected to discuss future co-operation with OPEC. Elsewhere, it’s worth noting that the monthly<strong> EIA STEO has been delayed to tomorrow</strong> to incorporate the recent oil market events. Onto metals, <strong>spot gold</strong> remains under pressure amid the overall risk tone in the market and as the Buck recoups some of its recent losses, with the yellow metal still above 1650/oz but notably below the USD 1680/oz overnight high. <strong>Copper prices</strong> meanwhile rebound with a vengeance after the prior session’s aggressive downside amid the risk tone and APAC stimulus measures (specifically from Japan), with the red metal back on a 2.5/lb handle.</p><p><strong>Saudi Aramco CEO said the Co. will supply customers with 12.3mln BPD in April.

Italian-listed Diasorin (+17.4%) rose to the top of the FTSE MIB as the Co. completed its studies regarding a launch of coronavirus tests by end-March.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>NOK/JPY - Still flanking the G10 ranks, but the Norwegian Krona is now in pole position and Yen at the back of the pack in contrast to Monday when oil prices were tanking and risk aversion rife. Eur/Nok has recoiled further from nigh on 11.0000 to sub-10.7550 at one stage and almost oblivious to significantly weaker than expected inflation data or a downbeat regional survey even before the full extent of the coronavirus contagion has been taken into consideration. Conversely, Usd/Jpy has rebounded from near 101.00 yesterday to just over 105.00 as broad sentiment stabilises alongside crude, despite more exchanges between Saudi Arabia and Russia on the supply front.</p><p>USD - The Dollar has benefited from the relative calm in financial markets, partly instilled by US pledges via President Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to unveil big fiscal support measures, which in turn have flipped Treasuries back into bear steepening mode and eroded some appeal from safer currency and other havens. Hence, the DXY has pared losses from yesterday’s new 94.650 ytd base and briefly topped 96.000 within a 96.006-95.199 range.</p><p>CHF/EUR/GBP/NZD/AUD - All softer vs the Greenback due to the aforementioned turnaround in mood from extreme depression, with the Franc below 0.9300 again, Euro sub-1.1400, Cable under 1.3100 and Antipodeans losing a degree of their yield appeal from 0.6600+ and 0.6350+ respectively overnight. The Aussie also had drops in NAB business conditions and confidence to digest, while the Kiwi is absorbing comments from RBNZ Governor Orr indicating that there is more room to reduce the OCR (to zero or even negative if needed) rather than resorting to unconventional policy easing.</p><p>CAD/SEK - The Loonie is deriving some comfort from oil finding a base (for the time being at least) between 1.3706-1.3608 extremes vs its US counterpart and the Swedish Crown has regrouped amidst more Riksbank guidance steering away from a reversal in the repo rate in favour of QE if it need to take emergency policy action. Eur/Sek hovering around 10.7200 from 10.8100+ earlier and like the Nok cross not unduly bothered about data (household consumption).</p><p>EM - Respite after the rout, and with the Rouble not just gleaning traction from Brent clawing back outsize declines, but also the CBR’s intervention to stop the Rub depreciating in line with other regional Central Banks and bodies attempting to stem the tide.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Rather mixed UK auction results have not really altered the current trend of core debt unwinding more of Monday’s huge safe-haven gains and yield compression amidst long end outperformance in recognition of the general revival in risk sentiment. Gilts, Bunds and US Treasuries are all in the region of 1 ¾ to 2 points adrift as oil prices bounce and more Governments commit funds to help fight the economic impact of COVID-19 alongside ongoing efforts to stop the outbreak reaching pandemic proportions, like Italy’s nationwide lock down. However, all is far from normal in the bond and financial markets as Russia pulls its regular weekly OFZ auction for Wednesday due to unstable conditions. Ahead, the more routine API inventory update for crude and other products.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>A day of respite, consolidation and potential short covering in the energy markets following yesterday’s violent Saudi-induced sell-off. <strong>WTI</strong> front month futures found an overnight base at ~USD 30/bbl and <strong>Brent</strong> April contracts touched APAC lows of just under USD 33.50/bbl – ahead of Saudi-fuelled lows around USD 27.40/bbl and USD 31.45/bbl respectively. Prices could also be experiencing some underlying support from OPEC delegates downplaying the expanding rift between Saudi and Russia, as they noted it is too early to give up on the alliance. That being said, Saudi Aramco’s CEO stated that it will supply its customers with 12.3mln BPD of oil starting April 1st – a number higher than the touted step-by-step increase as per sources, which noted the Kingdom could raise output to 11mln BPD before ramping production. As such, energy futures came under belated pressure and have been pushed to session lows of USD 30.20/bbl for WTI and USD 35.00/bbl for Brent, but nonetheless remain in positive territory following the gap higher at the reopen of electronic trade. Prices then found mild reprieve amidst comments from the Russian Energy Minister as he noted Moscow does not rule out join action with OPEC, despite also noting that Russian companies may boost oil output by up to 300k BPD and has potential to increase by 500k BPD – in fitting with comments from Russia’s Rosneft yesterday. Novak also noted of the next joint meeting to take place in May/June; OPEC’s website has scheduled this for June 10th. Sources stated that Russian Energy Ministry has called a meeting with Russian oil companies for tomorrow which is expected to discuss future co-operation with OPEC. Elsewhere, it’s worth noting that the monthly EIA STEO has been delayed to tomorrow to incorporate the recent oil market events. Onto metals, spot <strong>gold</strong> remains under pressure amid the overall risk tone in the market and as the Buck recoups some of its recent losses, with the yellow metal still above 1650/oz but notably below the USD 1680/oz overnight high. <strong>Copper</strong> prices meanwhile rebound with a vengeance after the prior session’s aggressive downside amid the risk tone and APAC stimulus measures (specifically from Japan), with the red metal back on a 2.5/lb handle.</p>",

Eur/Nok has recoiled further from nigh on 11.0000 to sub-10.7550 at one stage and almost oblivious to significantly weaker than expected inflation data or a downbeat regional survey even before the full extent of the coronavirus contagion has been taken into consideration. Conversely, Usd/Jpy has rebounded from near 101.00 yesterday to just over 105.00 as broad sentiment stabilises alongside crude, despite more exchanges between Saudi Arabia and Russia on the supply front.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Dollar has benefited from the relative calm in financial markets, partly instilled by US pledges via President Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to unveil big fiscal support measures, which in turn have flipped Treasuries back into bear steepening mode and eroded some appeal from safer currency and other havens. Hence, the <strong>DXY </strong>has pared losses from yesterday’s new 94.650 ytd base and briefly topped 96.000 within a 96.006-95.199 range.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/GBP/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>All softer vs the Greenback due to the aforementioned turnaround in mood from extreme depression, with the Franc below 0.9300 again, Euro sub-1.1400, Cable under 1.3100 and Antipodeans losing a degree of their yield appeal from 0.6600+ and 0.6350+ respectively overnight. The Aussie also had drops in NAB business conditions and confidence to digest, while the Kiwi is absorbing comments from RBNZ Governor Orr indicating that there is more room to reduce the OCR (to zero or even negative if needed) rather than resorting to unconventional policy easing.</p><p><strong>CAD/SEK</strong></p><p>The Loonie is deriving some comfort from oil finding a base (for the time being at least) between 1.3706-1.3608 extremes vs its US counterpart and the Swedish Crown has regrouped amidst more Riksbank guidance steering away from a reversal in the repo rate in favour of QE if it need to take emergency policy action. Eur/Sek hovering around 10.7200 from 10.8100+ earlier and like the Nok cross not unduly bothered about data (household consumption).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Respite after the rout, and with the Rouble not just gleaning traction from Brent clawing back outsize declines, but also the CBR’s intervention to stop the Rub depreciating in line with other regional Central Banks and bodies attempting to stem the tide.</p>",

By settlement, 2-year yield had fallen 21bps while the 30-year had fallen by 38bps to 0.840%, but above its lows of 0.702%. US T-note futures (H0) settled 1 point 8 ticks higher at 139.09+.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are somewhat mixed as markets begin to pick up the pieces from the recent oil-triggered devastation after Saudi instigated an oil price war following the OPEC+ breakdown, which resulted to losses of over 7% among most major US indices for the worst performance on Wall St. since 2008. Nonetheless, US equity futures found some reprieve overnight despite briefly dipping into bear market territory with the rebound helped by hopes of measures as President Trump is set to discuss pay roll tax relief with congress and will hold a press conference on economic measures to respond to the coronavirus which he suggested will be major steps, while Japanese Finance Minister Aso said the government is to announce a 2nd package of steps on coronavirus on Tuesday afternoon and that the G7 agreed to take fiscal as well as monetary steps as appropriate. ASX 200 (+1.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.2%) are mixed in which the former shrugged off opening losses of around 4% led by the recovery in the energy sector, while the Japanese benchmark remains constrained by the recent currency flows. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) are indecisive after continued PBoC liquidity inaction and a further reduction in China’s additional coronavirus cases with price action relatively rangebound amid the market stabilization in the region.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY trades higher and is back above the 95.00 level after rebounding from 18-month lows. This resurgence in the greenback has translated to a further pullback in its transatlantic counterparts in which GBP/USD retreated to test support at 1.3050 and with EUR/USD dispirited after several failed attempts to break through resistance ahead of 1.1500 and the single currency now struggles to hold above 1.1400. In terms of the latest coronavirus-related news from the continent, Italian PM Conte has declared a nationwide lockdown and announced all public gatherings are to be banned, while the closure of schools and universities all over the country was extended to April 3rd. Elsewhere, USD/JPY nursed losses to trade at the 103.00 handle as BoJ officials reiterate they will not hesitate to take additional steps although the pair still has far to go after a 3-week slide brought on by safe-haven currency flows, while antipodeans are uneventful with only mild pressure seen amid soft Australian Business Survey data, mixed Chinese inflation figures and a weaker CNY reference rate.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs have slipped below 155.00 as it tracks the pullback in USTs after the recent safe-haven surge and as equity markets begin to stabilize, while demand has also been sapped with participants looking ahead to the 5yr JGB auction results due later.</p>",
