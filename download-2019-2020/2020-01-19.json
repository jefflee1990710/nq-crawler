Boeing (BA) sold off after ABC reported its 737 flight computers could not talk to each other at the start up in a test flight, although it is unclear how long the fix will take. Boeing responded noting they are working on fixing the latest software issue with the FAA. Tesla (TSLA) also saw downside after reports it is being reviewed by the US Auto Safety Agency to seek an investigation into 500k vehicles for sudden unintended acceleration, according to a government document. Alphabet (GOOGL) surpassed USD 1trln market cap just before yesterday’s close and continued its gain driving outperformance in its Sector. Energy was a large underperformer following a decline in natgas prices which weighed on producers EQT Corp. (EQT), Chesapeake (CHK), and to a lesser extent, Exxon Mobil (XOM). Qualcomm (QCOM) saw an upgrade from Citi, who boosted its forecasts on the name as the “long awaited 5G ramp begins to take shape”. On the earnings front, truckers were sold off after poor earnings from JB Hunt (JBHT) and Expeditor (EXPD), where the latter also reported poor guidance. Meanwhile, State Street (STT) had strong figures and Citizens Financial (CFG) benefited from a dividend increase, and Regions Financial (RF) was hit on a slight miss on earnings, and a decline in NIM. SPX +0.34% at 3,328, NDX +0.53% at 9,174, DJI +0.17% at 29,348.</p><p>T-Notes sold off as the US session got underway, with a new US 20-year bond unveiling, strengthening US Dollar and decent housing data weighing on duration. The 10-year yield found resistance at just below 1.85%, before retreating somewhat in the latter end of the session. Note that the long bond saw the most selling pressure earlier in the session on the back of the US Treasury announcing it would be increasing its maturity offerings with a new 20-year bond, to launch in 2020. By settlement, the Treasury curve was steeper, with the 2-year yield little changed whilst the 30-year yield was 3bps higher. More broadly, the T-Note future settled little changed on the week, where participants digested a slew of factors, including another strong week of corporate issuance, the Phase 1 deal signing and a mixed bag of data (lacklustre CPI against firm retail sales), all in the background of US equity bourses continuing to push to new all-time-highs. US T-note futures (H0) settled 3+ ticks lower at 129-01+.</p>",
