Gold however had its haven status questioned as the precious metal plunged over USD 70 at one point paring a large amount of the recent gains and now trades around USD 1575. Markets found ease with comments from Fed Chair Powell who noted the coronavirus as an \"evolving risk\" and noted the central bank's willingness to use its tools as appropriate to support the economy which then saw money markets price in almost 4 25bps cut by year-end, heavily weighing on the dollar. In the last few minutes of cash equity trade, the SPX saw wild swings as the market imbalance narrowed from over 3bln on the sell side to around 200mln, which saw a 30point jump to see the index reclaim the 2900 figure, meanwhile NDX hit saw last minute gains and closed higher. Note, month end flows were also likely to be at play, as well as participants cautious to hold risk exposure over the weekend.</p><p><strong>* US PERSONAL INCOME, SPENDING, PCE (JAN):</strong> Personal income topped the consensus (0.6% vs 0.3%), though spending missed expectations (0.1% vs 0.2%). Pantheon Macroeconomics said this is old news, before COVID-19 dominated the agenda. PM said the jump in income was a catch-up after a below-trend 0.1% increase in December. \"The monthly numbers are noisy but the trend is rising by about 4% Y/Y. it has slowed over the past year, though, and likely will take something of a hit over the next few months as payroll growth suffers due to coronavirus fears.\" Consumer spending was depressed for a third month in the last four, weighed by the utility energy component. \"Eventually, this component will rebound substantially, but in the meantime, it is making consumption look weaker than it really is,\" PM argues. Meanwhile, the 0.1% increase in the core PCE deflator was \"puzzlingly small,\" PM wrote; the Y/Y rate rose a tenth to 1.6%; \"further gains are coming over the next couple of months as favorable base effects from last year drop out of the calculation,\" PM says, \"the Fed won’t care even if the Y/Y rate jumps back to the target; the coronavirus story is way more important.\"</p><p><strong>* FED CHAIR POWELL: </strong>made an unannounced statement where he reiterated the Fed will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy, while noting fundamentals for the economy remain strong but COVID-19 poses evolving risks and the Fed is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook. A classic dovish reaction was seen across major assets, although the commentary is in fitting with the Fed's guidance, given the current conditions participants have been eyeing to see if the Fed would step in to help support the economy as the coronavirus continues to weigh on global markets, with money markets pricing in almost four 25bps cuts after the speech. The biggest change in these remarks would be the \"evolving risk\" of the coronavirus, which could lead some to believe the Fed is identifying a material change to the outlook.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19:</strong> The coronavirus continues to weigh on global markets as cases continue to rise with the WHO raising its global risk level of the virus to \"very high\" from \"high\", previously, whilst noting much of the global community is not yet ready to implement measures that have contained the virus in China. The US CDC announced there are 61 confirmed cases (prev. 60), with 44 of those from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, while VP/COVID-19 Czar Pence noted there is only one American still in Hospital. In response to the virus, sources via WaPo stated officials are to discuss tax cuts and other emergency measures to help tackle the outbreak, where sources also noted they are considering ramping up pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates. As the virus spreads in Europe, Eurogroup Head Centeno noted they stand ready to act if the coronavirus becomes less temporary, calling on EU states to act in a coronated manner if there were too be a response. In Latin America, Mexico and Brazil reported cases, with local Brazilian press suggesting there are over 200 suspected cases of the Virus in the country.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's <strong>Bullard</strong> (dovish, non-voter) leaned back against expectations that the central bank needs to cut rates. Bullard said US rate cuts were \"a possibility\" if the coronavirus intensified, but that was not his base case. He did add that if the virus intensified to a global 'pandemic' with health impacts approaching seasonal Flu impacts, the Fed might react (note: the WHO currently classifies the outbreak as an 'epidemic'). Bullard suggested that investors and policymakers were wise to worry about a global pandemic, but he believes that the possibility is still small. Bullard's base case is that policy is in a good place, with insurance cuts from last year helping to buffer against shocks. And he sees the economic impacts of outbreak to be noticeable in China, but on a smaller scale elsewhere with temporary global supply chain disruptions, noting that the fact that cases have stabilised in China signals that other public health authorities should be able to also contain the virus. Fed's <strong>Kaplan</strong> (neutral, voter) added little new info of note. Kaplan said he was watching credit spreads and liquidity, and reiterated that it is too soon to comment on what the Fed will do amid the market downturn, though did acknowledge that if global growth slowed, it would have at least some spill over onto the US.</p><p><strong>* US CHICAGO FED:</strong> The headline rose to 49.0 (cons 46.0) from 42.9. The data series has been choppy in recent months, given that Boeing has its HQ in Chicago. Pantheon Macroeconomics said the PMI was now overshooting relative to the aircraft orders numbers, so it expects a correction in the next couple of months, even without the coronavirus. \"The Chicago PMI is not a reliable guide to the national ISM manufacturing index, due Monday, where we expect to see a modest dip,\" and \"the big hit from the coronavirus will come in next month’s PMI and Fed surveys.\"</p><p><strong>* US ADVANCED GOODS TRADE BALANCE:</strong> The advanced goods trade deficit narrowed to USD 65.5bln in January (prev. USD 68.7bln), largely on the back of a 1.0% M/M decline in goods exports being outpaced by the 2.2% decline in imports. \"At face value, this suggests exports are on course for growth of around 2% annualised in the first quarter, with imports broadly unchanged,\" Capital Economics says, \"but the January trade data are clearly also old news at this stage, and data from early-reporting Asian economies suggest that US trade with China will fall sharply in February.\" CapEco says that US tourism exports will probably receive an additional hit from the grounding of flights from China in recent weeks. \"On balance, we’re still assuming net trade will be broadly neutral for first-quarter GDP growth, with a coronavirus-driven slowdown in domestic demand the far bigger risk.\"</p><p><strong>* CANADA GDP:</strong> Ahead of Wednesday's BOC confab, money markets are implying a 64% chance that the BOC will lower rates from the current 1.75% level, with the heavy rate cut pricing a result of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus weighing on the global economy, which would hit the Canadian economy by extension. This week, analysts were closely watching that Q4/December GDP data for any signs that the slowdown in growth had become persistent - a condition that BOC governor Poloz said he'd need to see before he could justify any rate cuts. That data, however, was in line with market expectations (as well as the BOC forecasts) at 0.3%, alluding to stability more than persistent downside, and would usually be expended to diminish the chances of a rate cut. However, Canadian bank RBC states that growing fears about the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak abroad, and another bout of disruptions to rail transportation from anti-pipeline protests means that growth will likely remain weak, at least for the first half of 2020. And RBC says that it continues to look for the BOC to cut rates at least once in the months ahead. NOTE: it is a statement-only affair, but Governor Poloz will be delivering remarks the day after the meeting.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's <strong>Weidmann</strong> (hawk) cautioned against Germany undermining the its so-called debt brake, arguing that previous fiscal surpluses do provide some leeway. Like many other central bankers, Weidmann seems to be in wait and see mode regarding the COVID19 impact on the economy (and ECB policy), stating that the effect on prices was far from clear, noting supply shocks tend to be generally inflationary, but the virus might result in a demand shock, and therefore the picture was uncertain. Talking about rates more generally, Weidmann suggested that the Governing Council believes that policy has not reached the reversal rate yet.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLES USD 2.33 LOWER AT USD 44.76/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLES USD 2.06 LOWER AT USD 49.67/BBL: </strong>The crude benchmarks ended the week as they spent it, going down, and heavily, leaving prices on front month futures at levels not seen since the December 2018 market downturn. The COVID-19 outbreak continues to remove the bid from risk assets with Friday’s price action predominantly drifting lower throughout the session, indiscriminate to each negative virus update. In what would in “more normal” market conditions be considered a bullish supply update, participants largely disregarded sources reports that multiple OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, are leaning in favour of a deeper oil output reduction with discussions of a 1mln BPD cut vs. previous suggestion of 0.6mln BPD, ahead of the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna on March 5th and 6th; note that desks have been noting that continued OPEC support/cuts are almost expected, thus priced in, amid the declining global growth scenario. Elsewhere, all five North Sea Brent crude streams, which underpin the dated Brent benchmark, will load fewer cargoes in April than March, as according to a programme. The Department of Energy announced that the US will sell 12mln barrels of crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in compliance with the 2015 Budget Act. The latest US Baker Hughes rig count (w/e 28th Feb) showed: Oil -1 at 678, Natural Gas unchanged at 110 and Total -1 at 790.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLE 1 POINT &amp; 13 TICKSD HIGHER AT 134-27. </strong>Another big rip higher in the TPLEX, the largest such this week, led by the short end as virus concerns move the market’s expectations towards Fed accommodation, in addition to haven and month-end flows. The move higher came across the whole session, and found some additional pressure in the tail-end on the back of Powell’s remarks that the virus is an “evolving risk”, which some are alluding to as a shoe-in to a potential “material change to the outlook”. The rates market certainly believes the Fed won’t hold back, with 95bps of rate cuts now priced in for 2020, with 50bps expected for the March FOMC meeting – accompanied by excessive volume in rates futures. Additionally, desks draw attention to month-end rebalancing likely exacerbating the bid into duration from index buyers. While in the background, the virus continues to spread, impacting global supply chains and continuing investor appetite for Treasuries. At the US equity cash close the entire curve had bull steepened significantly, the 2-year yield was down 19bps and the 30-year a relatively “meagre” 10bps, with the 10-year yield down 13.5bps to 1.165%, off its all-time-low of 1.116%.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.82% at 2954, NDQ +0.30% at 8462, DJIA -1.4% at 25,409</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Further equity volatility to end the week due to the evolving COVID-19 situation. The further falling of yields continued to weigh on financials (BKX, XLF). Lower energy prices weighed on the sector (XLE, XOP) – meanwhile, Occidental (OXY) reported a disappointing quarter but decent production guidance and EOG Resources (EOG) missed on Revenue but boosted its dividend. Lower gold prices weighed on gold miners (NEM, LK, GOLD). Emerson (EMR) took a hit on warning of COVID-19 effecting its sales. Trade Desk (TTD) surged on strong earnings and guidance. Wayfair (W) tumbled lower on a larger than expected loss. Foot Locker (FL) made strong gains after a decent quarter. Gilead (GILD) pared some of its recent strength amid a downgrade at DZ Bank and announcing a takeover offer for Forty Seven (FTSV), which surged. Dell (DELL) posted decent top and bottom line figures although was offered amid weakness in its datacentre unit. Mylan (MYL) sold off after disappointing earnings and COVID-19 business impact warnings. Autodesk (ADSK) traded firmer after a strong quarter, although guidance was more or less inline. Live Nation (LYV) was another gainer after a decent quarter. PG&amp;E (PCG) traded lower after California regulators increased its wildfire fine.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN CPI:</strong> The data highlight for the Eurozone next week comes in the form of the bloc’s latest inflation metrics, with headline Y/Y CPI forecast to fall to 1.2% from 1.4%, and the super-core measure is set to rise modestly to 1.2% from 1.1%. In terms of regional inputs ahead of the EZ-wide release, Y/Y CPI in Germany remained at 1.7%; ING highlights that inflation was mainly supported by higher prices for food and alcohol. However, the Dutch Bank cautioned that the recent declines in oil prices will weigh on inflation in the coming months. Elsewhere, the French reading slipped to 1.4% from 1.5% and Spanish CPI slipped to a meagre 0.8% from a prior of 1.1%. From a policy perspective, Nordea’s analysts argue that “inflation is not the most important factor to the ECB these days”, adding that “any near-term easing will be due to weaker activity indicators following the coronavirus spread”. Additionally, given the ongoing strategic review at the Bank, with the inflation target a key pillar of focus, the parameters for which the Bank will be target inflation are somewhat opaque.</p><p><strong>WEEKLY FX WRAP:</strong> coronavirus captures all the attention and crushes risk appetite</p><p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Dollar is defying the usual month end net selling for portfolio rebalancing signals and staging a spirited comeback from fresh wtd lows set earlier on Friday’s session, but the DXY remains on course for a significant fall within a 99.657-98.019 range. Collapsing US Treasury yields amidst rampant Fed rate cut expectations and the ongoing spread of China’s nCoV epidemic has been the overriding and overwhelming theme for the Greenback, but with the severe deterioration in broad risk sentiment resulting in the Buck losing more ground relative to the traditional safe haven currencies than it has amassed against high beta, activity, cyclical and commodity based counterparts.</p><p><strong>* JPY/CHF/XAU:</strong> As noted above, risk aversion has dominated proceedings from the outset this week and the scramble into perceived safer havens has been pretty unrelenting, but the Yen has emerged as the ultimate of that ilk as Usd/Jpy extends its retreat from around 111.68 to circa 107.90, ahead of a recently scheduled presser from Japan’s PM Abe at 9.00GMT tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Franc has flitted between pillar and post, with Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf trading from 0.9815 to 0.9610 and 1.0670 to 1.0585 respectively, though gradually shrugging off verbal SNB intervention to attract investor demand and capital inflows. Conversely, Gold has now lost Usd1600/oz+ status having rallied to within 10 Bucks or so of Usd1700 when it became apparent that COVID-19 was spreading even further beyond the epicentre and source at the start of the week.</p><p><strong>* EUR/CAD/GBP/AUD/NZD:</strong> All ending Friday’s EU session on the back foot, but this hardly covers the full story as general US Dollar weakness before the aforementioned late rebound propped up the Euro, Loonie, Pound, Aussie and Kiwi at various stages. However, Eur/Usd topped out just above 1.1050 on a combination of technical and fundamental factors given the mounting pile of coronavirus cases in Italy and across the continent, while Usd/Cad bottomed around 1.3220 amidst the meltdown in crude prices and rebounded through 1.3450 at one stage. Elsewhere, Cable has been volatile in a rough 2+ big figure range and intermittently distracted by Brexit developments as the EU laid out its trade mandate followed by UK PM Johnson setting his stall and the two sides remaining divided on key red lines, like fishing rights. In contrast, pretty one-way traffic ensued in Eur/Gbp from sub-0.8350 to circa 0.8575 as the usual RHS orders for month end built up, while Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd have both been undermined by renewed and reinstated near term RBA and RBNZ easing just ahead of the former’s March policy meeting next week and the latter’s on the 23rd.</p><p><strong>* SCANDI/EM:</strong> Notwithstanding bouts of respite and consolidation, it has been a traumatic week for the Scandinavian Crowns and EM currencies, irrespective of any positives on paper or official attempts to stop the rot (run). Moreover, the Lira and Rouble have both had heightened Turkey-Russia conflict over Idlib in Syria to contend with, while the Rand only took fleeting solace from the SA budget that still leaves the nation susceptible to losing its last IG credit rating when Moody’s delivers its verdict towards the end of next month (assuming it does not decide to review the outlook sooner of course). Elsewhere, the SK Won suffered as nCoV cases and fatalities continued to increase, but the Yuan has actually pared declines from under 7.0000 as the WHO maintained a bullish assessment of China’s efforts to contain the outbreak, albeit upgrading the COVID-19 threat level to very high and another incremental step towards pandemic. More PBoC and Chinese Government policies to support the economy, companies and financial institutions also helped the Renminbi, but PMIs loom over the weekend and could highlight the extent of the fall-out, thus far. Turning to Latam, the Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso were not immune to the deadly virus or general risk rout that overshadowed BCB intervention and Banxico commentary along with data.</p>",

The COVID-19 outbreak continues to remove the bid from risk assets with Friday’s price action predominantly drifting lower throughout the session, indiscriminate to each negative virus update. In what would in “more normal” market conditions be considered a bullish supply update, participants largely disregarded sources reports that multiple OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, are leaning in favour of a deeper oil output reduction with discussions of a 1mln BPD cut vs. previous suggestion of 0.6mln BPD, ahead of the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna on March 5th and 6th; note that desks have been noting that continued OPEC support/cuts are almost expected, thus priced in, amid the declining global growth scenario. Elsewhere, all five North Sea Brent crude streams, which underpin the dated Brent benchmark, will load fewer cargoes in April than March, as according to a programme. The Department of Energy announced that the US will sell 12mln barrels of crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in compliance with the 2015 Budget Act. The latest US Baker Hughes rig count (w/e 28th Feb) showed: Oil -1 at 678, Natural Gas unchanged at 110 and Total -1 at 790.</li></ul>",

Collapsing US Treasury yields amidst rampant Fed rate cut expectations and the ongoing spread of China’s nCoV epidemic has been the overriding and overwhelming theme for the Greenback, but with the severe deterioration in broad risk sentiment resulting in the Buck losing more ground relative to the traditional safe haven currencies than it has amassed against high beta, activity, cyclical and commodity based counterparts.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/XAU&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, risk aversion has dominated proceedings from the outset this week and the scramble into perceived safer havens has been pretty unrelenting, but the Yen has emerged as the ultimate of that ilk as Usd/Jpy extends its retreat from around 111.68 to circa 107.90, ahead of a recently scheduled presser from Japan’s PM Abe at 9.00GMT tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Franc has flitted between pillar and post, with Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf trading from 0.9815 to 0.9610 and 1.0670 to 1.0585 respectively, though gradually shrugging off verbal SNB intervention to attract investor demand and capital inflows. Conversely, Gold has now lost Usd1600/oz+ status having rallied to within 10 Bucks or so of Usd1700 when it became apparent that COVID-19 was spreading even further beyond the epicentre and source at the start of the week.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/GBP/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>All ending Friday’s EU session on the back foot, but this hardly covers the full story as general US Dollar weakness before the aforementioned late rebound propped up the Euro, Loonie, Pound, Aussie and Kiwi at various stages. However, Eur/Usd topped out just above 1.1050 on a combination of technical and fundamental factors given the mounting pile of coronavirus cases in Italy and across the continent, while Usd/Cad bottomed around 1.3220 amidst the meltdown in crude prices and rebounded through 1.3450 at one stage. Elsewhere, Cable has been volatile in a rough 2+ big figure range and intermittently distracted by Brexit developments as the EU laid out its trade mandate followed by UK PM Johnson setting his stall and the two sides remaining divided on key red lines, like fishing rights. In contrast, pretty one-way traffic ensued in Eur/Gbp from sub-0.8350 to circa 0.8575 as the usual RHS orders for month end built up, while Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd have both been undermined by renewed and reinstated near term RBA and RBNZ easing just ahead of the former’s March policy meeting next week and the latter’s on the 23rd.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding bouts of respite and consolidation, it has been a traumatic week for the Scandinavian Crowns and EM currencies, irrespective of any positives on paper or official attempts to stop the rot (run). Moreover, the Lira and Rouble have both had heightened Turkey-Russia conflict over Idlib in Syria to contend with, while the Rand only took fleeting solace from the SA budget that still leaves the nation susceptible to losing its last IG credit rating when Moody’s delivers its verdict towards the end of next month (assuming it does not decide to review the outlook sooner of course). Elsewhere, the SK Won suffered as nCoV cases and fatalities continued to increase, but the Yuan has actually pared declines from under 7.0000 as the WHO maintained a bullish assessment of China’s efforts to contain the outbreak, albeit upgrading the COVID-19 threat level to very high and another incremental step towards pandemic. More PBoC and Chinese Government policies to support the economy, companies and financial institutions also helped the Renminbi, but PMIs loom over the weekend and could highlight the extent of the fall-out, thus far. Turning to Latam, the Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso were not immune to the deadly virus or general risk rout that overshadowed BCB intervention and Banxico commentary along with data.</p>",

(Twitter)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>Another grim session thus far for European equities (Eurostoxx 50 -4.2%) as the selling pressure facing global stocks shows no signs of letting up. Since yesterday’s close there hasn’t been much in the way of a notable pickup in coronavirus-related outbreaks with the newsflow running largely at the same clip as it has done for the past few sessions as various nations such as New Zealand, Lithuania, Nigeria and Belarus all report their first cases. The current market narrative is having to contend with many of the same issues it has throughout the week, with the uncertainty surrounding coronavirus clearly top of the list of investor concerns, whilst a lack of meaningful policy response from either fiscal or monetary authorities has only added to the current apprehension. Additionally, geopolitical unrest between Turkey and Russia as well as focus on who US President Trump’s opponent in the 2020 White House race could be (Sanders would naturally be seen as a negative) have added to the bearish impulses. All of this has triggered a serious re-reassessment of valuations (mainly US) that many had questioned on the way up in recent months, however, it remains to be seen how far the current slump will extend as the ongoing drip-feed of disappointing corporate updates continues to suppress investor appetite. In terms of the breakdown for Europe this morning, selling across the 10 key sectors has been relatively broad-based once again, with travel names continuing to be a prime target for selling pressure after IAG (-2.5%) warned that, amid COVID-19 the Co. could not forecast 2020 profits. Furthermore, for the sector, easyJet (U/C) shares are also seen lower after warning of softening demand amid the virus outbreak. Elsewhere to the downside, Lagardere (-10.1%) sit at the foot of the Stoxx 600 post-earnings, Commerzbank (-4.1%) are seen lower in a disappointing yield-environment for the financial sector whilst also being urged to make deep cuts and overhaul its business model. Such is the extent of the selling, despite opening with gains of 3.3%, shares in Thyssenkrupp (-4.7%) eventually fell victim to the bloodbath in Europe. One of the few success stories thus far is Rolls-Royce (+6.1%) after announcing it will be incurring no further costs from the Trent 10000 issues.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR/XAU -</strong> It’s seems when push really comes to shove and risk aversion intensifies to the point of full blown mass exodus levels, the Yen becomes the default destination and accordingly Usd/Jpy alongside crosses are collapsing at pace. The headline pair is now probing bids near 108.50 and a break could expose the 200 DMA (circa 108.42) with inverse bearish repercussions for the DXY that is already looking increasingly precarious a fraction above the 98.000 handle having already breached a 50% retracement level on the charts at 98.134. Meanwhile, the Franc is also attracting capital fleeing from high beta, activity and cyclical counterparts, as Usd/Chf hovers closer to the bottom of a 0.9695-10 range and Eur/Chf retreats through 1.0650 even though the single currency continues to proffer from the Dollar’s demise amidst ever declining US Treasury yields and curve flattening. However, Eur/Usd has run in to some resistance around 1.1050 where option expiry interest in 1.4 bn resides and extends to 1.1060. Elsewhere, Gold has not benefited from the safety-flight perhaps oddly or perversely, as Xau/Usd consolidates below Usd1650/oz and holdings are liquidated to free up cash over month end and for other funding needs.</p><p><strong>GBP -</strong> The Pound is not renowned for any safe-haven properties and still has residual RHS month end Eur/Gbp demand to contend with as the cross straddles 0.8550, but Cable is clinging to 1.2900 due to Buck underperformance and braced for the UK-EU trade off to begin.</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK -</strong> Having displayed varying degrees of resilience in the face of an escalating FTQ, the Loonie, Aussie and Kiwi have all succumbed to the inevitable or reality, with Usd/Cad topping 1.3450 ahead of Canadian GDP and PPI, Aud/Usd struggling above Fib support circa 0.6513 protecting 0.6500 and Nzd/Usd now south of 0.6350 amidst renewed calls for RBA and RBNZ easing in response to nCoV. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns are sinking as sentiment sours and local data is shrugged off, such as Swedish Q4 GDP that was bang in line with consensus anyway, and Norwegian Krona falls additionally in sympathy with crude. Eur/Nok hit fresh record highs over 10.4300 and Eur/Sek almost touched 10.7000 before some paring back.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Deeper declines and depreciation de rigour, but the Rouble and Lira are still prone to inverse moves on oil prices while anxiously eyeing events in Syria’s Idlib where attempts to mediate between Turkey and Russia are ongoing following a further escalation in military strikes. Elsewhere, intervention is becoming more commonplace in an effort to stop runs on various currencies that have plunged to all-time lows</p><p>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/USD: 1.0900 (2.2BLN), 1.0920-35 (1.1BLN), <strong>1.0950 (1.6BLN), 1.0975-80 (1.1BLN),</strong> 1.1000 (732M), <strong>1.1050-60 (1.4BLN)</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/JPY: <strong>119.95-120.05 (1.3BLN)</strong></p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It would be far too premature if not profligate to even venture the notion that the tide may be turning given recent history, but some element of calm amidst the risk storm has evolved over the course of the EU am session.

However, it could yet prove to be a freaky Friday and final trading day of February with a raft of data scheduled and USTs still underpinned by a lengthy month end extension.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>WTI and Brent prices are once again experiencing a significant sell-off this morning with WTI having breached the USD 45/bbl mark and crude well below USD 50/bbl at worst, with losses just shy of USD 2/bbl at present. Focus does, as has been the case all week, remain almost exclusively on the coronavirus with multiple new cases being reported as well as the implementation of emergency or lockdown procedures in some regions. Overnight, prices did briefly see support of reports that Saudi Arabia are looking for a 1mln BPD production cut, and they would be responsible for the majority of such a reduction; while the price support was fleeting, these comments are notable given that such a level would be almost double the figure recommended by the JTC (600k BPD) (Note, similar reports were echoed ahead of the US entrance to market). Next week sees the OPEC meeting where all eyes will be on firstly if production cuts are announced and then, assuming they are announced, the magnitude of reductions; ING posit that 600k would likely be sufficient to maintain market balance at present into Q2 but, in the event that Libyan supply returns earlier than expected cuts of the 1mln magnitude would be required. Elsewhere, geopolitical tensions over Syrian between Russia and Turkey have significantly flared up during the session, with Russia sending frigates to the area and the UN to host an emergency meeting, at Turkey’s request, on this later. While not currently appearing to have an impact on commodity prices, it could well become a focus point if the situation deteriorates further. Moving to metals, where spot gold isn’t able to benefit from the continued sell-off markets are seeing, as such the yellow metal is down by circa USD 10/oz at present; however, it is worth caveating that spot gold prices are still well-elevated vs. recent levels and it does appear that today’s lack of support for the metal is at the expense of a significantly bolstered JPY.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is reportedly seeking a cut of 1mln BPD, according to sources cited by the FT, Saudi would account for a bulk of the newly proposed cuts.

The headline pair is now probing bids near 108.50 and a break could expose the 200 DMA (circa 108.42) with inverse bearish repercussions for the <strong>DXY</strong> that is already looking increasingly precarious a fraction above the 98.000 handle having already breached a 50% retracement level on the charts at 98.134. Meanwhile, the Franc is also attracting capital fleeing from high beta, activity and cyclical counterparts, as Usd/Chf hovers closer to the bottom of a 0.9695-10 range and Eur/Chf retreats through 1.0650 even though the single currency continues to proffer from the Dollar’s demise amidst ever declining US Treasury yields and curve flattening. However, Eur/Usd has run in to some resistance around 1.1050 where option expiry interest in 1.4 bn resides and extends to 1.1060. Elsewhere, Gold has not benefited from the safety-flight perhaps oddly or perversely, as Xau/Usd consolidates below Usd1650/oz and holdings are liquidated to free up cash over month end and for other funding needs.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Pound is not renowned for any safe-haven properties and still has residual RHS month end Eur/Gbp demand to contend with as the cross straddles 0.8550, but Cable is clinging to 1.2900 due to Buck underperformance and braced for the UK-EU trade off to begin.</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Having displayed varying degrees of resilience in the face of an escalating FTQ, the Loonie, Aussie and Kiwi have all succumbed to the inevitable or reality, with Usd/Cad topping 1.3450 ahead of Canadian GDP and PPI, Aud/Usd struggling above Fib support circa 0.6513 protecting 0.6500 and Nzd/Usd now south of 0.6350 amidst renewed calls for RBA and RBNZ easing in response to nCoV. Similarly, the Scandi Crowns are sinking as sentiment sours and local data is shrugged off, such as Swedish Q4 GDP that was bang in line with consensus anyway, and Norwegian Krona falls additionally in sympathy with crude. Eur/Nok hit fresh record highs over 10.4300 and Eur/Sek almost touched 10.7000 before some paring back.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Deeper declines and depreciation de rigour, but the Rouble and Lira are still prone to inverse moves on oil prices while anxiously eyeing events in Syria’s Idlib where attempts to mediate between Turkey and Russia are ongoing following a further escalation in military strikes. Elsewhere, intervention is becoming more commonplace in an effort to stop runs on various currencies that have plunged to all time lows.</p>",

Indeed, the 10 year German benchmark has been as high as 177.38 even though the Dax has pared some downside towards 12k from sub-11.8k at one stage alongside further gains in US Treasuries amidst reports of heavy clips going through quick order. Bunds also deriving upside momentum from renewed selling in BTPs as Italian assets bear the brunt of the EU angst from China’s nCoV on top of the worst health contagion. Moreover, month end durations favour USTs especially and pre-weekend positioning could spill-over to core Europe. Ahead, a packed end to the month in terms of data, and more Central Bank rhetoric, but the overriding focus is risk on COVID-19 and the aforementioned heightened geopolitical tensions.</p>",

Dow and S&amp;P posted their worst day since February 2018 as the three major indices dipped into correction territory. This performance reverberated into APAC markets as ASX 200 (-3.0%) opened sharply lower and held onto the losses, and again with mining and financials posting heavy losses. Nikkei 225 (-4.5%) fell deeper into correction territory and also saw another day of underperformance in manufacturing, autos and financials, whilst also being weighed on by a firmer JPY. KOSPI (-3.4%) bore the brunt of yesterday’s BoK surprise hold coupled with total virus cases in South Korea topping 2k as the index gave up its 2k handle, and with heavyweights Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motors lower to the tune of 2-5% amid supply chain woes, and with the latter suspending production at its No2 plant in South Korea after a worker tested positive for the virus. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.8%) conform to the global stock rout, with the former also in correction zone and again pressured by the usual suspects – oil giants, entertainment and financials stocks, whilst the latter initially scraped off lows before extending losses, as the total deaths in the country showed an increase vs. yesterday, although the rate of new cases continues its recent downtrend.

The index later gained some traction and topped 98.500, primarily driven by losses in other G10s. As such, EUR/USD experienced modest weakness and drifted below the 1.1000 mark after having fluctuated on either side of the level in early trade, and with sizeable option expiries scattered ahead of today’s NY cut, including almost EUR 2bln at strike 1.0950, and around EUR 1.4bln between 1.0980-1.1000. GBP/USD flatlined just below 1.2900 throughout the session before succumbing to USD strength. Antipodeans were pressured with the Aussie faring slightly better than its Kiwi counterpart after the AUD/NZD cross rebounded off support at 1.0400 and extended gains to levels north of 1.0450, prompting the NZD/USD to breach 0.6300 to the downside at the time. AUD and NZD saw more pronounced downside thereafter as risk aversion materialised further across the market and with increased talk of dovish RBNZ calls also weighing on the latter. NZD/USD saw some mild support at 0.6250 but the first confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand took the Kiwi below the psychological level. AUD/USD meanwhile traded choppy above 0.6550 before joining the Kiwi on its downwards trajectory, with some citing the AUD/JPY breach below 72.000 as a potential catalyst. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses trickled lower as the safe-haven currency remained underpinned by the risk-tone. USD/JPY slipped below 109.50, its 100 DMA (~109.20) and then 109.00 to an overnight base of ~108.90. Finally, KRW came under renewed pressure as the region continues to tackle the economic prospects of rising virus cases and stacking travel advisories against the country.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>WTI and Brent front month continued to bleed during APAC trade as the coronavirus theme continues to weigh on the demand side of the equation. Prices saw modest fleeting upside on source reports that Saudi Arabia is reportedly seeking a 1mln BPD cut at next week’s meeting, deeper than the JTC-recommended 600k BPD reduction. Nonetheless, WTI Apr’20 futures slipped below USD 46/bbl whilst its Brent counterpart briefly fell under USD 50.50/bbl. Elsewhere, spot gold was choppy but ultimately saw losses despite the risk aversion as the yellow metal drifted below 1650/oz with an overnight base found ~1635/oz, with some highlighting month-end factors whilst others cited profit taking. In terms of base metals, copper prices and Dalian iron ore futures saw significant losses given the bleak risk tone and dampened demand prospects on coronavirus.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is reportedly seeking a cut of 1mln BPD, according to sources cited by the FT, Saudi would account for a bulk of the newly proposed cuts. (Newswires) OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said OPEC+ are showing renewed commitment to reaching the accord, noted next week's meeting is to go ahead as scheduled.

(BBC) Turkish President Erdogan held and emergency meeting before his office said that Turkey will hit “all regime targets” in retaliation. (Newswires) Turkey is to retaliate in kind against Syrian government after Turkish soldiers were killed in Idlib, according to a Turkish official cited by Anadolu. (Newswires) US State Department says they stand by their NATO ally Turkey. (Newswires)</p><p>Israeli military helicopters over the Golan Heights have attacked a number of positions near Quneitra in southern Syria, according to SANA cited by ELINT News. (Twitter)</p><p>US * US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLE 3+ TICKS HIGHER AT 133-14. It was another choppy session for the TPLEX, which has ultimately seen yields in the shorter part of the curve fall by around 4.5bps, while the longer end was down by just under 1bps, at settlement; the shape of the curve, however, was steeper to the tune of 1-3bps. It was, of course, COVID19 headlines that were dictating the action, and the curve was influencing the FX space via the rate differential channel, which subsequently saw the USD come under pressure, particularly against the JPY. The US sold 7-year notes in an unspectacular auction, which tailed by 1.4bps, though cover had firmed versus recent averages. For now, Fed officials seem to be comfortable monitoring the risks, although markets seem to be somewhat less patient, and have priced in nearly three rate cuts through the end of this year. Analysts have said that whether this transpires on not will likely depend on the speed of the normalisation, and what actions US corporates could take in response (cutting guidance has been seen, but some have warned they may be far more worried by job cuts).</p><p>Fed's Evans (non-voter, dove) regarding monetary policy, said we only have so much ammunition but if circumstances require additional accommodation, we do have that capacity, adds policy is pretty well positioned for the risks that we have seen coming. Fed's Evans said looking for real economic impact from the coronavirus is the first thing to be considered, it is too early to tell if its growth forecast will be cut, and that it is going to take some time for the effects to show.

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Red across the board in Asia as stocks continued bleeding from virus contagion ",
        "content": "<p>Asian stocks trade lower across the board following the bloodbath on Wall Street which saw the Dow plummet almost 1200 points, S&amp;P break below the 3000 mark and the Nasdaq zero in on the 8500 level. Dow and S&amp;P posted their worst day since February 2018 as the three major indices dipped into correction territory. This performance reverberated into APAC markets as ASX 200 (-3.0%) opened sharply lower and holds onto the losses, and again with mining and financials posting heavy losses. Nikkei 225 (-3.4%) also sees another day of underperformance in manufacturing, autos and financials, whilst also being weighed on by a firmer JPY. KOSPI (-2.3%) bears the brunt of yesterday’s BoK surprise hold coupled with total virus cases in South Korea topping 2k, and with heavyweights Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motors lower to the tune of 2-3% amid supply chain woes. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.6%) conform to the global stock rout, with the former again pressured by the usual suspects – Oil giants, entertainment and financials, whilst the latter scraped off lows but ultimately trades lower as the total deaths in the country showed an increase vs. yesterday, although the rate of new cases continues its recent downtrend.</p><p>In FX, DXY was uneventful under the 98.500 mark and around the prior session’s lows for a large part of the session after tracking US yields lower. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD relatively flat intraday, with the former trading on either side of 1.1000 whilst Cable flatlines just below 1.2900. Antipodeans are pressured with the Aussie faring better than its Kiwi counterpart after the AUD/NZD cross rebounded off support at 1.0400 and extended gains, prompting the NZD/USD to breach 0.6300 to the downside to find a current base at 0.6275. AUD/USD meanwhile trade choppy above 0.6550 after gleaning support from a weaker USD. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses trickle lower as the safe-haven currency remains underpinned by the risk-tone. USD/JPY dipped below 109.50 as it eyes its 100 DMA (~109.20) for support. Finally, KRW came under renewed pressure following some USD-induced reprieve yesterday as the region continues to tackle the economic prospects of rising virus cases and stacking travel advisories against the country.</p>",
