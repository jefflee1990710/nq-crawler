Furthermore, US President Trump said he will hold a summit with Chinese President XI in Washington if there is a deal and that he will discuss tariffs with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, while he cited tariffs as well as IP theft when asked about sticking points. (Newswires)</p><p>Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said we have currently made good progress in trade discussions, while US Trade Representative Lighthizer also noted that plenty of headway was made and the US has a good partner in China's Vice Premier Liu He but added there are still major, major issues remaining. (Newswires)</p><p>RBI cut the Repurchase Rate and Reverse Repo Rate by 25bps each to 6.00% and 5.75% as expected. The central bank maintained a neutral stance although one member wanted to change stance to “accommodative”, while the RBI said output gap remains negative and domestic economy is facing headwinds on a global front. (Newswires)</p><p>Fitch affirmed India at BBB-, Outlook Stable. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>UK House of Lords reportedly will try to get the second reading of the Cooper-Letwin completed tonight and the remaining stages on Monday, according to The Times' Esther Webber. (Twitter)</p><p>A letter from UK PM May's government to EU's Tusk requesting for an A50 extension is being drafted, with current debate in Cabinet on how long the extension should be. (The Guardian)</p><p>EU Commission’s Katainen said a hard Brexit is becoming increasingly possible as we do not know what the alternatives are, while he added if there is no WA then that means there are few options available. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB Minutes noted that concerns were voiced regarding the effect of persistently low rates on bank profitability &amp; intermediation, while it added that growth returning to potential through the projection horizon may be optimistic. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>US President Trump said he is giving Mexico a 1yr warning and that if that does not stop the illegal drugs coming in, US will tariff Mexican goods including cars and close the border. President Trump later commented that there would be a 25% tariff on car imports from Mexico if he decides to apply tariffs but also said that Mexico has done good regarding the border during past 4 days, while he added that he did not say the border would stay open for a year but that he would place tariffs first. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Harker (non-voter, dove) said he does not see a rate cut this year or next year and is still in \"wait and see mode\", while he expects one rate hike \"at most\" in 2019 and one in 2020. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Mester (non-voter, hawk) said she is biased to keeping rates where they are or moving them up a bit despite downside risks, while she added that it is possible FFR may need to move higher if the economy performs in line with Fed scenarios but also commented it is possible that the Fed is done with hikes for this cycle. (Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump confirmed he has recommended Herman Cain to the Fed board. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Constellation Brands (STZ) outperformed on Thursday after reporting a beat on top and bottom line estimates as well as announcing the divesting of some of its wine and spirits assets, investors looked over its gloomy guidance. Tesla (TSLA) nosedived after disappointing results from its Q1 deliveries. Facebook (FB) caught a bid on the open following an upgrade at Guggenheim. Boeing (BA) benefitted from a note at Morgan Stanley saying that the worst case scenario is “off the table”; Morgan Stanley also caused Micron (MU) to dip lower, citing street estimates as too optimistic. Cowen analysts gave tailwinds to Netflix (NFLX), citing it as in a prime spot, and also Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), citing partnerships and digitalisation that will fuel growth. Office Depot (ODP) fell off a cliff on the back of a disappointing earnings outlook. Take-Two (TTWO) came under pressure as investors didn’t take to kindly to the announcement it would launch its Borderlands 3 videogame exclusively on the Epic Games store. SPX +0.21% at 2879, NDX -0.06% at 7541, DJI +0.64% at 26385.</p><p>According to the CME’s Fedwatch tool, the implied chance of a rate cut in 2019 still stands at over 50%. While this has certainly edged lower from periods in the last month where the chance was around 75% (implied by money market pricing), it still seems at odds with comments from Fed officials, who have generally been upbeat about the economy while acknowledging its slowing; many others have noted that as the tax-cut high fizzles out, growth was always expected to normalise. But there is still a lack of high profile Fed officials talking about cuts. Mester and Harker today both intimated the next move could be higher (non-voters). Perhaps the pricing is a result of comments from nominee Moore, who this week called for an immediate 50bps rate cut, and NEC director Kudlow, who echoed Moore’s remarks; then there is Trump's own preference for lower rates, and the criticism he often fires in the direction of the Fed. The latest on the Fed BOG, is that Trump is mulling nominating Herman Cain, who is a fan of former Fed chair Greenspan. Tomorrow’s payrolls data will be an important catalyst, but for different reasons than the Street may report: SocGen’s strategist Kit Juckes argues that a weak number could put the cat among the pigeons without telling us anything new, while a strong number wouldn’t be surprising unless it challenged the conclusions from other indicators. The key, Juckes says, is whether we are in an intra-cycle turn, like in 2016, or whether we are at the start of the end of the cycle; Juckes says he is in the latter camp, though notes that in 2006, the S&amp;P 500 didn’t peak till later in the year, while IG CDS didn’t reach its tightest until 2007, suggesting there could be more juice in this market. In terms of the curve, action was very thin ahead of payrolls on Friday, and at settlement, curve spreads were a touch narrower. US T-Note futures (M9) settled 1+ higher at 123-17+.</p>",

However, the narrative of the two super-states making progress was maintained, with Commerce official Myron Brilliant stating that talks were in the “end-game” but a final deal had still not been reached. President Trump recycled his regular optimism saying that talks were “coming along well” and that the deal must be a great one, otherwise the US will not be doing it. More specifically and as expected, Trump said the deal must include action on IP theft and technology transfers, as well as adding that China will be purchasing a lot of products from the US. Elsewhere,<i> </i>fears of an imminent shutting of the US-Mexico border were put at ease, where Trump said he would be giving his southern neighbour a one year period to stop the inflow of illegal drugs into the US, and if Trump is still not satisfied he said he would initiate tariffs on goods – including cars – before escalating into a full border shutdown. A Mexican ambassador to the US later said that the country wants to cooperate with the US on immigration issues.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW: Nonfarm Payrolls (March 2019)</strong> are expected to revert to a more trend-like pace in March, following the sub-par Feb data (which was<strong> </strong>likely on idiosyncratic effects, analysts say). The jobless rate is seen remaining at 3.8%. Wage growth is seen moderating<strong> </strong>a touch, though would still be consistent with the recent pick-up. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21539/download\">Click here for the full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS:</strong> Initial jobless claims fell to a new cycle low at 202k. \"This is a very welcome surprise, coming hot on the heels of significant downward revisions to claims which suggested that the trend was flat rather than rising, as prior data suggested,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said. \"One week does not prove anything, but if this reading—the lowest since December 1969—is repeated, it would suggest that the trend is still falling.\" However, the consultancy says it is struggling with the idea given the slowdown in economic growth. \"Note, though, that the data over the next few weeks, and perhaps this week’s number, are subject to distortions caused by the shifting date of Easter from year to year. As always, the trend is more important than single weekly numbers.\" News that Western forces were deploying more capital towards Tripoli shows provides an ominous signal that a conflict may be imminent.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Mester (non-voter) </strong>said it is possible that the FFR may need to move higher if the economy performs in line with Fed scenarios, but also says it is possible that the Fed is done with hikes for this cycle; she caveated this by saying she was biased to keeping rates on hold or moving them higher despite downside risks. Mester sees economic weakness in Q1 likely as temporary, however notes Europe and China are slowing. <strong>Fed's Harker (non-voter)</strong> said he is still in a \"wait and see mode\" and expects one rate hike \"at most\" in 2019 and one in 2020, but does not see a cut in either. He said he is paying attention to risks from the business investment outlook, global growth, trade developments, and the yield curve. On the US outlook, Harker said the US jobless rate is likely to fall to 3.5% this year before ticking up a few tenths of a point; he sees inflation averaging just above 2% in 2019 and 2020, which he does not believe to be a red flag.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (K9) SETTLE USD 0.36 LOWER AT USD 62.10; BRENT (M9) SETTLES USD 0.09 HIGHER AT USD 69.40. </strong>The crude complex failed to give up recent gains on Thursday, seemingly shrugging off the large build in US crude inventories, however Brent did perform better than its American counterpart, which traded rather flat. Some analysts have attributed the part closure of the key Houston shipping channel as a factor in preventing transportation of crude, hence leading to natural rises in crude stocks, given some fuel for bulls hoping this may be temporary. Elsewhere, unintentional supply constraint is looming over the Libya region again, where Eastern Libyan forces are said to be moving west towards Tripoli, “While an attempt to unify control of the country and potentially bring stability, we note that accomplishing this at the end of a gun also presents risks of ongoing conflict with crude oil production also in doubt,” analyst at Citigroup note. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.21% at 2879, NDX -0.06% at 7541, DJI +0.64% at 26385. SECTORS: Energy +0.85%, Materials +1.00%, Industrials +0.61%, Communications -0.99%, Cons Discretionary +0.71%, Cons Staples +0.37%, Healthcare -0.24%, Financials +0.49%, Tech -0.44%, Telecoms +0.66%, Utilities -0.38%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Constellation<strong> </strong>Brands<strong> </strong>(STZ) outperformed on Thursday after reporting a beat on top and bottom line estimates as well as announcing the divesting of some of its wine and spirits assets, investors looked over its gloomy guidance. Tesla (TSLA) nosedived after disappointing results from its Q1 deliveries. Facebook (FB) caught a bid on the open following an upgrade at Guggenheim. Boeing (BA) benefitted from a note at Morgan Stanley saying that the worst case scenario is “off the table”; Morgan Stanley also caused Micron (MU) to dip lower, citing street estimates as too optimistic. Cowen analysts gave tailwinds to Netflix (NFLX), citing it as in a prime spot, and also Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), citing partnerships and digitalisation that will fuel growth. Office Depot (ODP) fell off a cliff on the back of a disappointing earnings outlook. Take-Two (TTWO) came under pressure as investors didn’t take to kindly to the announcement it would launch its Borderlands 3 videogame exclusively on the Epic Games store.</p><p><strong>* US T-Note futures (M9) settle 1+ higher at 123-17+. </strong>According to the CME’s Fedwatch tool, the implied chance of a rate cut in 2019 still stands at over 50%. While this has certainly edged lower from periods in the last month where the chance was around 75% (implied by money market pricing), it still seems at odds with comments from Fed officials, who have generally been upbeat about the economy while acknowledging its slowing; many others have noted that as the tax-cut high fizzles out, growth was always expected to normalise. But there is still a lack of high profile Fed officials talking about cuts. Mester and Harker today both intimated the next move could be higher (non-voters). Perhaps the pricing is a result of comments from nominee Moore, who this week called for an immediate 50bps rate cut, and NEC director Kudlow, who echoed Moore’s remarks; then there is Trump's own preference for lower rates, and the criticism he often fires in the direction of the Fed. The latest on the Fed BOG, is that Trump is mulling nominating Herman Cain, who is a fan of former Fed chair Greenspan. Tomorrow’s payrolls data will be an important catalyst, but for different reasons than the Street may report: SocGen’s strategist Kit Juckes argues that a weak number could put the cat among the pigeons without telling us anything new, while a strong number wouldn’t be surprising unless it challenged the conclusions from other indicators. The key, Juckes says, is whether we are in an intra-cycle turn, like in 2016, or whether we are at the start of the end of the cycle; Juckes says he is in the latter camp, though notes that in 2006, the S&amp;P 500 didn’t peak till later in the year, while IG CDS didn’t reach its tightest until 2007, suggesting there could be more juice in this market. In terms of the curve, action was very thin ahead of payrolls on Friday, and at settlement, curve spreads were a touch narrower.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> Beware of news reports on slow market days that purport to offer firm reasons for market moves, while over exaggerating price moves. For instance, most of the FX wraps coming through to the desk have talked about a bloody day for the EUR following another dreadful report out of Germany which shows the manufacturing sector is in recession; at pixel time, the EUR is down around one-tenth of a percent. Nevertheless, it gave the USD a bid bias, though even that is up by around 0.25% as we head into Asia trade, and the buck was also support by a cautious risk environment ahead of the US jobs report on Friday. The pound did see a reasonable move – down around 0.7%; talks between the govt and opposition have not yielded any results yet, while talk of a long-extension and no deal is gaining traction. EMFX was a beneficiary of quiet trade, though the RUB was lower again as oil moved negative in later trade and talk of new sanctions from the US picked-up. the INR was also weaker, taking its cue from RBI rate cuts and possibly more looser policy ahead.&nbsp; The Aussie was up, with iron ore prices once again providing some support.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>According to the CME’s Fedwatch tool, the implied chance of a rate cut in 2019 still stands at over 50%. While this has certainly edged lower from periods in the last month where the chance was around 75% (implied by money market pricing), it still seems at odds with comments from Fed officials, who have generally been upbeat about the economy while acknowledging its slowing; many others have noted that as the tax-cut high fizzles out, growth was always expected to normalise. But there is still a lack of high profile Fed officials talking about cuts. Mester and Harker today both intimated the next move could be higher (non-voters). Perhaps the pricing is a result of comments from nominee Moore, who this week called for an immediate 50bps rate cut, and NEC director Kudlow, who echoed Moore’s remarks; then there is Trump's own preference for lower rates, and the criticism he often fires in the direction of the Fed. The latest on the Fed BOG, is that Trump is mulling nominating Herman Cain, who is a fan of former Fed chair Greenspan. Tomorrow’s payrolls data will be an important catalyst, but for different reasons than the Street may report: SocGen’s strategist Kit Juckes argues that a weak number could put the cat among the pigeons without telling us anything new, while a strong number wouldn’t be surprising unless it challenged the conclusions from other indicators. The key, Juckes says, is whether we are in an intra-cycle turn, like in 2016, or whether we are at the start of the end of the cycle; Juckes says he is in the latter camp, though notes that in 2006, the S&amp;P 500 didn’t peak till later in the year, while IG CDS didn’t reach its tightest until 2007, suggesting there could be more juice in this market. In terms of the curve, action was very thin ahead of payrolls on Friday, and at settlement, curve spreads were a touch narrower.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Usd/G10 pairings are still relatively rangebound, but the Greenback has forged firmer gains vs several currency counterparts in wake of weekly claims data showing a decline to 202k from a revised 212k previously and vs an expected 216k. Although the week in question does not feed into the survey for the March BLS report due on Friday, the DXY gleaned some encouragement after Wednesday’s sub-forecast ADP tally and slowdown in the ISM non-manufacturing jobs component to grind off a near 97.000 base and probe above 97.300. Note, our full NFP primer is now available via the headline feed and Research Suite.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP</strong></p><p>Ending the EU session as biggest losers having revisited recent highs just shy of 0.6800 and 1.3200 vs the Usd at various stages, but now eyeing this week’s lows sub-0.6750 and 1.3100 respectively. The Kiwi may have rattled by reports that a date for the eagerly-awaited Trump-Xi meeting to seal a trade deal is unlikely to be announced as soon as today, but also underperformed vs the <strong>AUD</strong> that is normally more sensitive to Chinese/global macro factors. However, Aud/Usd is holding up quite well on the 0.7100 handle amidst a major bank trade recommendation to go long of Aud/Nzd at market (1.0500 at the time and 1.0525 currently) with a profit target of 1.0900 and stop at 1.03000.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>All on the back foot against the aforementioned bouncing Buck, albeit to varying degrees as Usd/Jpy extends the topside of its hitherto tight rage to just over 111.62 and into decent option expiries between 111.50-60 having breached the 200 DMA (111.49) a bit more convincingly. Similarly, the Loonie slipped to fresh lows vs its US peer near 1.3370 and only got a fleeting lift from firmer Canadian Ivey PMIs (SA and NSA), while the single currency and Franc both flirted with big figures at 1.1200 and parity, while Eur/Chf meandered just above 1.1200. Note, the Eur was not helped by more poor German data and another 2019 GDP forecast downgrade, along with more reports about the Italian Government revising its growth estimates for this year and conceding that the deficit will likely be 2.3-2.4% vs 2.04%.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>At last some positive news for the Try, as crude prices pulled back and S&amp;P contended that Turkey’s rating is not under threat at present. In response, or sheer relief the Lira rebounded through 5.6000 vs the Dollar, in contrast to weakness in the Rouble that was undermined by a warning from the same ratings agency about a cut if the US imposes harsh and widespread sanctions on Russia. Usd/Rub back above 65.5500 and up to 65.6030 at one stage. Elsewhere, Usd/Inr is also firmer after the RBI cut its benchmark repo and reverse repo by ¼ point while maintaining a neutral stance.</p>",

Elsewhere, spot gold (+0.1) trades lacklustre as markets are tentative ahead of the ECB minutes, US-China trade talks and NFP. It is also worth noting that investors are pulling money out of gold ETFs with around USD 153mln removed out of the USD 10bln VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF over the last five days. Meanwhile, copper (-0.3%) succumbs to the cautious risk tone but remains above its 100 WMA of just under USD 2.90/lb. Finally, Dalian iron ore futures saw its best day in seven-weeks, extending its record-breaking rally, as supply-side woes (largely from cyclones in Western Australia) and a pick-up in demand (steel mills replenishing stocks) boosted the base metal to a new peak of USD 103.49/tonne.</p><p>CME lowered NatGas Henry Hub futures margins by 10.8% to USD 1650/contract.

Finally, Dalian <strong>iron</strong> ore futures saw its best day in seven-weeks, extending its record-breaking rally, as supply-side woes (largely from cyclones in Western Australia) and a pick-up in demand (steel mills replenishing stocks) boosted the base metal to a new peak of USD 103.49/tonne.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Dollar index is holding around the 97.000 level within an extremely narrow 97.013-120 range, and symptomatic of the listless tone in the G10 currency markets overall after choppy trade from Monday through Wednesday amidst fluctuating risk on, off and on again sentiment. However, today and Friday offer some prospect of more decisive moves or at least price action if not clear direction, with the ECB Minutes, Fed speakers and NFP on the agenda.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound is a marginal outperformer as UK Parliament passed another motion to avoid a no deal Brexit and request that PM May go back to the EU seeking a further A 50 extension if no alternative is found to the WA by April 12 or May 22 (assuming no sudden change of heart and the current proposal with Brussels is accepted as the better of evils vs a CU). Cable has rebounded from yesterday’s sub or circa 1.3120 lows to retest 1.3200, but not quite as near the big figure this time as 21/30 DMA convergence around 1.3165 continues to exert some gravitational influence. Similarly, Eur/Gbp has retreated through 0.8550 towards 0.8500 again, though has not managed to get as close as it did on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR</strong></p><p>Both firmer vs the Greenback, albeit fractionally given the relatively constrained trade noted above, with the Jpy inching higher within a 111.50-35 band and potentially capped by decent option expiry interest from 111.50-60 (1.3 bn) and the 200DMA (111.49). Meanwhile, the single currency continues to meet resistance around 1.1250 and has not been helped by abysmal German industrial orders data or confirmation that the country’s group of Economic Institutes has become the latest to slash the 2019 GDP to under 1%.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>All underperforming, but again in context only marginally. Indeed, the Franc is meandering between 0.9987-72, Kiwi hovering from 0.6800 to 0.6773 and Aussie just keeping its head above 0.7100, and at this stage not looking likely to arouse expiry interest at 0.7140-50 in 1 bn. For choice, the Loonie is lagging against the backdrop of softer crude prices and back below 1.3350 ahead of Canada’s Ivey PMI.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Literally no respite for the Lira it seems, as economic, fiscal and political issues continue to weigh on the currency and Turkish assets in general. Indeed, Usd/Try has nudged up to 5.6600 again after Wednesday’s mixed inflation data and another hike in swap limits, as investors eye next week’s Economic Program conscious of the fact that the CBRT may not be able to loosen its grip on the monetary policy reins given that headline CPI remains so high.</p>",

Hence, Gilts have resumed Liffe mainly on the back foot between 129.28-50 vs their previous 128.47 settlement price, with only minor traction coming from the post-German data rebound in Bunds (which incidentally gathered a bit more momentum earlier when the 10 year benchmark reached 165.57), while the Short Sterling strip has been 3 ticks adrift, though now 0.5-2 ticks offside.</p>",

The hard data effectively confirms weakness flagged in the corresponding PMI and has lifted Bunds to a 165.51 high from 165.28 initially and a 165.19 base vs yesterday’s 165.40 close, while the equivalent cash yield is flirting with parity or fractionally negative terrain again. It remains to be seen whether the Dax and other EU bourses also acknowledge the poor industrial orders release and retreat further than already anticipated via futures. Ahead, hefty supply via Spain and France may warrant some concession, but ECB minutes could be Thursday’s major regional highlight if more details about TLTRO3 and forward guidance is revealed.</p>",

The usual suspects -- optimism about the prospects of a China/US trade deal, less chance of no deal Brexit, decent services PMIs out of china and Europe, and a decent retail sales report out of the latter -- were cited, and the TPLEX was happy to look through a sub-par ADP report, and a mixed non-manufacturing ISM.

US T-note futures (M9) settled 8+ lower at 123-16.</p><p><strong>US administration officials are said to have studied border closing options regarding the US/Mexico border in which options include a partial shutdown</strong>, while there were comments from White House spokeswoman Schlapp that progress has been made on the Mexico border issue.

ASX 200 (-0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) were subdued with broad weakness seen across all sectors in Australia as the post-budget euphoria faded and profit-taking set in following a 7-day win streak, while the Japanese benchmark was indecisive amid a choppy currency. Elsewhere, Chinese markets were mixed ahead of an extended weekend in which the Hang Seng (-0.4%) stalled after it briefly rose above 30k for the first time since June last year, while the Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) was boosted on hopes US and China are nearing a trade deal and with reports also suggesting a Trump-Xi meeting date to sign off on a deal could be announced as early as today. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as prices tracked the recent weakness in T-notes and as Japanese stock markets held above water for most the session, while mixed results at the 30yr auction also failed to spur demand.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade cautious with the region tentative ahead of the looming risk events and after a positive lead from Wall St. where US-China trade optimism kept stocks afloat despite poor ISM &amp; ADP data. ASX 200 (-0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) are mixed with broad weakness seen across all sectors in Australia as the post-budget euphoria fades and profit taking sets in following a 7-day win streak, while the Japanese benchmark is higher but with gains limited amid a choppy currency. Elsewhere, Chinese markets are also varied ahead of an extended weekend with the Hang Seng (-0.4%) stalling after it briefly rose above 30k for the first time since June last year, while the Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) is boosted on hopes US and China are nearing a trade deal and with reports suggesting a Trump-Xi meeting date to sign off on a deal could be announced as early as today.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is softer and eyes the 97.00 level to the downside in the wake of the prior day’s double whammy of poor data including a 19-month low US ISM Non-Manufacturing and with ADP Employment also falling short of estimates ahead of the upcoming Non-Farm Payrolls. The subdued USD has benefitted its major counterparts, although upside is limited by a lack of fresh catalysts with EUR/USD oscillating within the prior day’s tight range, while GBP/USD was mildly supported after MPs voted to approve the Cooper-Letwin bill which seeks to avert the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal on April 12th. The bill which just about passed by the tightest possible margin of 1 vote (313 ayes vs. 312 noes), requires UK PM May to seek an extension of Article 50 to prevent a no-deal Brexit and will now go to the House of Lords, while MPs had also rejected Amendment 1 which was tabled by Brexiteers and would have restricted the Brexit date to before May 22nd. Elsewhere, risk sensitive currencies AUD, NZD and JPY are indecisive amid a similar overnight sentiment and due to lack of data releases, while the PBoC took a swipe at the greenback and strengthened its fix accordingly.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower with prices tracking the recent weakness in T-notes and as Japanese stock markets just about held above water, while participants are also sidelined ahead of a 30yr auction later.</p>",
