Risk appetite - as measured by equities, yields and crude - hit its lows in European trade before gradually clawing back into the US session; note that XAU kept its bid, whilst the DX rose back above 99.00. Cisco (CSCO) weighed on the tech sector after its report which saw poor Q3 guidance. Applied Materials (AMAT) however rose 3% following EPS and revenue beats and decent guidance, which expects to see strong double-digit growth in its semiconductor business this year. MGM (MGM) fell 5% after a heavy miss on EPS and a withdrawal of guidance as its CEO announced they are to stepdown from the company. Kraft Heinz (KHC) were hit after its figures where it’s CFO reported supply chain costs, costs of commodities and unfavourable currencies will have a 210mln negative impact on its 2020 EBITDA. SPX -0.16% at 3374, DJIA -0.43% at 29,423, NDX -0.2% at 9596.</p><p>Treasuries settled modestly bid after coming off their highs found overnight. The TPLEX found a leg higher on the sudden spike higher in nCoV cases and deaths reported out of China due to the altering of their methodology. However, yields found their lows in early European trade, alongside risk appetite, paring back most of the prior move lower through the session. A couple of factors were being cited for the reversal, one being that some drew attention to the increased reported cases being a technical adjustment that is more backward looking, supporting the thesis that China now has the virus well contained. Others cited the Gilt sell-off in the UK, following Chancellor Javid announcing his resignation, as weighing on the TPLEX and EGBs. Additionally, a slew of IG corporate issuance, including a jumbo USD 9.25bln 6-parter from Carrier Global, in addition to anticipation of the 30-year Bond auction, weighed on Fixed Income heading into the US session. The 30-year Bond auction gave some impetus behind the underlying’s bid in the later part of the session, stopping through the 2.061% WI by 0.7bps to mark the lowest ever 30-year auction, covered by 2.43x (vs six-auction avg. 2.32), while the takedown indicated strong demand as both directs and indirects took more than their averages as dealers took less. The strong auction saw the entire curve flatten by settlement, with the 30-year yield lower by 2bps and the 2yr unchanged. US T-note futures (H20) settled 2+ ticks higher at 130-24+.</p>",

Of Michigan (Prelim.), Import &amp; Export Prices, Industrial Production, Business Inventories; German GDP (Flash); Baker Hughes US Rig Count; WTI March OPEX. <strong>Speakers:</strong> Fed’s Mester.<strong> Earnings: </strong>WDI GY; AZN LN, RBS LN.</li></ul><p><strong>* MARKETS WRAP:</strong> Tape action on Thursday was essentially a paring back of the risk-off flows seen overnight after an unexpectedly large jump in reported coronavirus cases and deaths, where China cited a methodological change for the ramp higher. Risk appetite - as measured by equities, yields and crude - hit its lows in European trade before gradually clawing back into the US session; note that XAU kept its bid, whilst the DX rose back above 99.00. Some, of the bullish nature, drew attention to the nCoV case rises being merely a technical adjustment, as well as rather backwards-looking, alluding to the perceived containment of the virus by China. Note that the NY Fed cut its repo operations on both the overnight and term repo operations, coming at a time when recent terms have been oversubscribed, although it maintained its T-bill purchases at a clip of USD 60bln for the month ahead. Cable had a strong rally, despite some initial weakness on Chancellor Javid's surprise resignation. Looking ahead, participants now await the latest update on new cases/deaths out of China, where on the thesis that last night's big case rise was a technical glitch, expectations are for a much more modest report. On the data front, we will receive the preliminary UoM survey and US retail sales to attain insight into the US economy.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>The number of new cases from the coronavirus outbreak saw an unprecedented spike overnight after Chinese authorities revised standards used to count the infections. China's Hubei province reported 14,840 new coronavirus cases (under the tweaked standards) and 242 additional deaths as of February 12th, in which 13332 of the cases were made by clinical diagnosis. Reports noted Hubei authorities began using CT scans to test and diagnose patients amid shortages of RNA test kits, and today’s numbers included cases diagnosed through CT scans for the first time. That said, a Shanghai Health Commission Official noted that the methodology for coronavirus diagnosis has not changed in areas outside the Hubei province. Thus the number infected could be even more pronounced than reported. In light of this, Chinese President Xi attempted to reassure the public by stating that the country will maintain the momentum in the development of the Chinese economy, and will “definitely” be able to minimise impact from the virus outbreak, adding that the country will strive to achieve development targets for 2020. Meanwhile, US administration sources believe, as cited by FBN’s Lawrence, that China is under-reporting the number of cases by at least 100k in China, and that it is \"severely\" under-reporting the number of deaths. The sources added that the scientists working on how the coronavirus spreads are having difficulty getting to the site on where the first case appeared, which could help scientists determine if spreads by contact or also airborne. US NEC Director Kudlow later said the US is quite disappointed in China’s nCoV response; does not appear to be good transparency, he added. Amid the outbreak, analysts at HSBC have cut their Q1 Chinese GDP growth forecasts to 4.1% from 5.8%, with the FY forecast reduced to 5.3% from 5.8%. US Energy Secretary Brouillette said there has been some slowing down of Chinese energy purchases, although the impact from the nCoV is marginal so far, adding that if China's demand is cut by 500k BPD, there will be no dramatic market impact.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* UK CABINET: </strong>In a surprise turn of events, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid resigned amid an uproar against PM Johnson, where Javid refused to fire many of his Treasury advisors, as Johnson had requested as part of his Cabinet shuffle. Briefly after, Johnson appointed the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, to the position – commentators note Sunak as a choice which would give Johnson more control over the Treasury and therefore spending ability. The initial announcement saw cable weakness, although the move swiftly reversed course, supporting a strong rally in sterling.</p><p><strong>* US CPI (JAN): </strong>Printed 0.1% M/M, down from 0.2%, which was also the prior, whilst the Y/Y rose to 2.5% from 2.3% (vs. exp. 2.4%). The core M/M rose to 0.2% from 0.1% as expected, while the core Y/Y held at 2.3%, which had been expected to fall to 2.2%. Real weekly earnings rose by 0.1% as expected, after the prior month’s 0.1% decline. Capital Economics says that the stability of core CPI supports its view that the Fed will not be raising rates for the foreseeable future. The consultancy highlights that the 15-month high headline figure was entirely a result of base effects, noting the more meagre M/M rise falling victim to falling energy prices. The core CPI has been stable at just north of 2% for a few years, with steady growth in unit labour costs, suggesting to CapEco that it will continue that trend over the coming quarters, extrapolating that core PCE (the Fed’s preferred inflation measure) will remain “stuck firmly” below the Fed’s 2% target.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Little in the way of official commentary, but the Fed nominees Shelton and Waller faced questions in the Senate. Waller said he would cut interest rates to zero, and would look to using forward guidance during the next downturn, although would not want to use negative rates in any future downturn. Shelton, the more controversial nominees given her strong support for President Trump and previous policy commentary, said she would never support negative interest rates and would very reluctantly support QE.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB’s Panetta says the protection of the environment could be considered as a secondary objective as part of the strategic review. This morning, ECB’s de Cos stated monetary policy will continue to be highly accommodative for a prolonged period of time and that a low-for-long rate environment could be spurring excessive risk-taking by some financial intermediaries.</p><p><strong>* IEA MONTHLY REPORT: </strong>Cuts 2020 oil demand growth forecast by 365k BPD to 825k BPD citing coronavirus, the lowest since 2011. Sees Q1 global oil demand falling by 435k BPD Y/Y, the first quarterly contraction in more than 10 years. Global oil production fell by 815k BPD to 100.5mln BPD in January M/M, citing Libyan outages and reduced UAE output. OPEC crude production in January fell to 28.86mln BPD from 29.44mln BPD in December. Q1 demand for OPEC crude is set to fall to 27.2mln BPD. Non-OPEC output in January increased by 2.1mln BPD Y/Y while OPEC output contracted by a similar amount. Comparing to the other two monthly reports, OPEC downgraded their 2020 demand forecast by 230k BPD due to the coronavirus, which was in-fitting with the EIA’s assessment where they cut their respective forecast by 310k BPD. OPEC report also noted that OPEC oil lost market share yet again, whilst the EIA STEO highlighted that US crude production is poised to rise further this year.&nbsp; Both reports also expected US 2020 production to rise (OPEC MOMR 13.12mln BPD; EIA STEO 13.2mln BPD) – current US record production stands at 13.0mln BPD.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLES USD 0.25 HIGHER AT USD 51.42/BBL; BRENT (J0) SETTLES USD 0.55 HIGHER AT USD 56.34/BBL. </strong>The crude complex was modestly firmer on Thursday thanks to a reversal in risk appetite. The benchmarks traded in the red during the Asia session following the nCoV updates, although found a bid as US participants came to the scene, coinciding with a move higher in equity futures. The strength appeared predominantly a function of appetite/demand, whilst the Kremlin said Russia has not yet decided on further oil cuts with OPEC and said it would announce a position on the deal in due course (keeping participants waiting, again). However, some have drawn attention to the operational difficulties at Exxon’s (XOM) Baton Rouge, Louisiana refinery (500k BPD), one of the US’ largest, as perhaps providing some support to the energy markets, although the correlation of the tape action to wider risk assets draws some scepticism on the claim.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H20) SETTLED 2+ TICKS HIGHER AT 130-24+: </strong>Treasuries settled modestly bid after coming off their highs found overnight. The TPLEX found a leg higher on the sudden spike higher in nCoV cases and deaths reported out of China due to the altering of their methodology. However, yields found their lows in early European trade, alongside risk appetite, paring back most of the prior move lower through the session. A couple of factors were being cited for the reversal, one being that some drew attention to the increased reported cases being a technical adjustment that is more backward looking, supporting the thesis that China now has the virus well contained. Others cited the Gilt sell-off in the UK, following Chancellor Javid announcing his resignation, as weighing on the TPLEX and EGBs. Additionally, a slew of IG corporate issuance, including a jumbo USD 9.25bln 6-parter from Carrier Global, in addition to anticipation of the 30-year Bond auction, weighed on Fixed Income heading into the US session. The 30-year Bond auction gave some impetus behind the underlying’s bid in the later part of the session, stopping through the 2.061% WI by 0.7bps to mark the lowest ever 30-year auction, covered by 2.43x (vs six-auction avg. 2.32), while the takedown indicated strong demand as both directs and indirects took more than their averages as dealers took less. The strong auction saw the entire curve flatten by settlement, with the 30-year yield lower by 2bps and the 2yr unchanged.</p><p><strong>* NY FED REPO SCHEDULE: </strong>In the latest NY Fed month ahead schedule, it cut its O/N Repo Operations limit to USD 100bln (starting Friday, prev. 120bln); cut Tuesday and Thursday Term repo operations to USD 25bln (prev. 30bln) for February and again to USD 20bln for March. The NY FED also maintained its monthly treasury bill purchases at USD 60bln through the middle of March.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS:</strong> SPX -0.16% at 3374, DJIA -0.43% at 29,423, NDX -0.2% at 9596. <strong>SECTORS</strong>: Cons Disc -0.24%, Cons Stpl +0.55%, Energy -0.45%, Financials -0.04%, Health -0.54%, Industrials -0.69%, Materials -0.38%, Real Estate +0.5%, Technology -0.3%, Communication Svs +0.15%, Utilities +1%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Cisco (CSCO) weighed on the tech sector after its report which saw poor Q3 guidance. Applied Materials (AMAT) however rose 3% following EPS and revenue beats and decent guidance, which expects to see strong double-digit growth in its semiconductor business this year. MGM (MGM) fell 5% after a heavy miss on EPS and a withdrawal of guidance as its CEO announced they are to stepdown from the company. Kraft Heinz (KHC) were hit after its figures where it’s CFO reported supply chain costs, costs of commodities and unfavourable currencies will have a 210mln negative impact on its 2020 EBITDA.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> A US court granted Amazon (AMZN) a temporary halt to the DoD JEDI USD 10bln cloud contract with Microsoft (MSFT) following Amazon’s suit. The headline saw immediate weakness in MSFT shares and slight upside in AMZN, however AMZN gains were short-lived as it tracked the broader market sell off heading into the tail end of US cash trade. Elsewhere, Foxconn (2354 TT) announced that reports regarding its China plant resumption is not factual. The recent reports suggested it reopened its China plant but only 10% came back to work, other reports noted its Shenzhen facility had now been allowed to reopen, with China production expected to return to 50% in February, and 80% in March. DigiTimes reported Apple (AAPL) demand for Taiwan Semiconductors (TSMC) 5nm A14 chips is likely to be high to support Apple’s 5G devices. The publication also reported it is likely to stick with its plans to unveil its next-generation iPhone in September as normal despite the potential delay to the release of its cheaper model due to the coronavirus, although it suggested Apple suppliers (QRVO, Avago) have begun full production of device components for the iPhone SE 2. Southwest Airlines (LUV) announced it is proactively removing the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX jet from its flight schedule through August 10th. Tesla (TSLA) ended firmer despite initial reports that it is recalling 15k Model X SUV’s and that it received a subpoena from the SEC. TSLA announced a USD 2bln stock offering which initially added to the weakness, however as investors digested the stock offering, TSLA surged wiping out pre-market losses and closed ~4% higher on the day. In M&amp;A, T-Mobile (TMUS) parent, Deutsche Telekom (DTE GY), announced it is looking to renegotiate the merger terms between TMUS and Sprint (S), given the poor performance in Sprint, recently.</p><p><strong>* BANXICO: </strong>The central bank cut its interest rate by 25bps as expected, making it the for the 5th consecutive rate cut. The decision this time was however unanimous, despite Esquivel opting for a 50bp rate cut at the last two meetings. On growth, Banxico noted balance of risks remain tilted to the downside and that 2020 GDP is expected to grow less than expected, and Governor De Leon announced it would be downgrading its economic growth forecast in the next quarterly report. On inflation, the bank noted that headline and core inflation are expected to be moderately higher than previous forecasts, thus heading further away from its 3% inflation target, however the bank noted that lower energy prices due to the coronavirus is a downside inflation risk.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: EUR</strong> continued its demise with EURUSD breaking yesterday’s low and key fib level at 109.64, to continue its fall through 108.50. The fall comes amid a lack of a fresh catalyst but continues to be taking its cue from familiar arguments: weak EU data, improved conditions for a carry trade and German political woes. <strong>USD</strong> hovered around the 99.00 figure throughout the session with US CPI doing little to sway price action. The buck, however, fell beneath the key figure in overnight trade as <strong>JPY</strong> caught a bid as the coronavirus cases increased drastically in the Hubei province, although the greenback clawed back gains and ended firmer on the day. <strong>USDJPY</strong> dropped to lows of 109.63 throughout the session after the nCoV developments as the cross saw one-way trade, before residing at 109.80 through the tail end of the session. <strong>GBP</strong> saw choppy trade, sterling traded firmer in the morning but the resignation of Chancellor Javid saw initial downside, although the losses were quickly faded and Cable continued its rally throughout the rest of the session before calming at the 1.3050 with some suggestions that the new appointee, Rishi Sunak, is more disposed to fiscal spending. Technical factors also at play as Cable crossed its 15 and 21 dma, at 1.3012 and 1.3028, respectively, before finding resistance at the 50dma at 1.3071. <strong>XAU</strong> traded firmer up to the 1575 handle once again following the large jump in coronavirus cases overnight which saw <strong>Antipodes</strong> give up some of the prior day gains, failing to pare as other risk assets did. <strong>EMFX </strong>was generally weaker against the buck with weakness particularly seen in <strong>RUB</strong>. Strength, however, was seen in BRL following central bank intervention to stem the recent Real losses. <strong>TRY</strong> traded relatively flat against the buck amid decent Turkish industrial production data. The Banxico rate decision saw little in way of MXN price action, although <strong>USDMXN</strong> fell gradually towards the tail end of the session despite a dovish outlook, although the decision saw Esquivel, who previously opted for a 50bp cut, join the 25bp camp. The statement also expressed concerns on inflation running away from target, which could lead members to lean less dovish in the future. Note, SocGen heading into the announcement highlighted that current market pricing is currently the most aggressive across the globe with over 100bps worth of easing priced in over the next 12 months.</p>",

The TPLEX found a leg higher on the sudden spike higher in nCoV cases and deaths reported out of China due to the altering of their methodology. However, yields found their lows in early European trade, alongside risk appetite, paring back most of the prior move lower through the session. A couple of factors were being cited for the reversal, one being that some drew attention to the increased reported cases being a technical adjustment that is more backward looking, supporting the thesis that China now has the virus well contained. Others cited the Gilt sell-off in the UK, following Chancellor Javid announcing his resignation, as weighing on the TPLEX and EGBs. Additionally, a slew of IG corporate issuance, including a jumbo USD 9.25bln 6-parter from Carrier Global, in addition to anticipation of the 30-year Bond auction, weighed on Fixed Income heading into the US session. The 30-year Bond auction gave some impetus behind the underlying’s bid in the later part of the session, stopping through the 2.061% WI by 0.7bps to mark the lowest ever 30-year auction, covered by 2.43x (vs six-auction avg. 2.32), while the takedown indicated strong demand as both directs and indirects took more than their averages as dealers took less. The strong auction saw the entire curve flatten by settlement, with the 30-year yield lower by 2bps and the 2yr unchanged.&nbsp;</p>",

The benchmarks traded in the red during the Asia session following the nCoV updates, although found a bid as US participants came to the scene, coinciding with a move higher in equity futures. The strength appeared predominantly a function of appetite/demand, whilst the Kremlin said Russia has not yet decided on further oil cuts with OPEC and said it would announce a position on the deal in due course (keeping participants waiting, again). However, some have drawn attention to the operational difficulties at Exxon’s (XOM) Baton Rouge, Louisiana refinery (500k BPD), one of the US’ largest, as perhaps providing some support to the energy markets, although the correlation of the tape action to wider risk assets draws some scepticism on the claim.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>IEA MONTHLY REPORT: </strong>Cuts 2020 oil demand growth forecast by 365k BPD to 825k BPD citing coronavirus, the lowest since 2011. Sees Q1 global oil demand falling by 435k BPD Y/Y, the first quarterly contraction in more than 10 years. Global oil production fell by 815k BPD to 100.5mln BPD in January M/M, citing Libyan outages and reduced UAE output. OPEC crude production in January fell to 28.86mln BPD from 29.44mln BPD in December. Q1 demand for OPEC crude is set to fall to 27.2mln BPD. Non-OPEC output in January increased by 2.1mln BPD Y/Y while OPEC output contracted by a similar amount. Comparing to the other two monthly reports, OPEC downgraded their 2020 demand forecast by 230k BPD due to the coronavirus, which was in-fitting with the EIA’s assessment where they cut their respective forecast by 310k BPD. OPEC report also noted that OPEC oil lost market share yet again, whilst the EIA STEO highlighted that US crude production is poised to rise further this year.&nbsp; Both reports also expected US 2020 production to rise (OPEC MOMR 13.12mln BPD; EIA STEO 13.2mln BPD) – current US record production stands at 13.0mln BPD.</li></ul>",

Inflation has recently ticked up above the mid-point of its target range, however the recent fall in oil prices may help with the core figures.&nbsp;</p><p>EXPECTATIONS:</p><ul><li>At its previous meeting, only one member, Esquivel, opted for a 50bp rate cut, where Heath only voted for a 25bps cut, despite previously sitting in the 50bp camp with Esquivel. TD highlight that despite this “we actually see an increasing risk that a 50bp rate cut is considered as there appears to be more room now to do so than at any point in the easing cycle”. The desk however sees the bank moving at a steady rate of cuts but expects markets to be more surprised by Banxico dovishness, due to current rate pricing, which TD believes is substantially underpricing Banxico’s easing cycle. SocGen highlight that current market pricing is currently the most aggressive across the globe with over 100bps worth of easing priced in over the next 12 months.</li></ul><p>RECENT DATA:</p><ul><li>Consumer prices were up from 2.8% Y/Y to 3.2% January, missing the Street's 3.3% view, although slightly above the banks 3% target. Non-core inflation drove prices higher, mainly due to higher goods prices, and despite the stability of the MXN in Q4. \"The main driver here was the processed food and tobacco components, hit by higher IEPS taxes,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \"these pressures will ease soon”. Services was relatively unchanged, with the effects of the new minimum wage earlier in the month, as well as consumer inertia, perhaps easing some of the Banxico's fears; Pantheon writes that Mexico’s inflation is under control, despite January's headline increase, which was mainly due to by one-off factors, and it expects the underlying trend to ease gradually towards Banxico’s 3% target in Q2. \"Domestic inflation pressures remain subdued, and the MXN's rebound since August supports our forecast of a benign core inflation picture over the next three-to-six months,\" PM writes, \"moreover, the recent fall in oil prices will help to keep noncore pressures in check during Q2, and accordingly, we think Banxico will continue to cut interest rates over the first half of the year.\"</li></ul><p>MINUTES/ RECENT COMMENTARY:</p><ul><li>The latest minutes saw all board members expecting weakness in the economy in Q4, noting it is still stagnant. On inflation, the majority believed that core inflation has been persistent and that upside for inflation has appeared, which could potentially make it a challenge to attain its 3% target for 2020 following the increase in its minimum wage.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>Not quite as dramatic or constructive as BoE super Thursday, but certainly a return to winning ways after last week’s disappointing penultimate trading session when Brexit qualms returned to plague the Pound. Indeed, Cable has rebounded strongly to eclipse 1.3050 and test last Tuesday’s 1.3070 peak ahead of 1.3081 Fib resistance after a knee-jerk blip on news that Sajid Javid rejected the offer to remain as UK Chancellor in PM Johnson’s new cabinet due to the contingent demand that he returned to the role without any of his advisers. By all accounts, Johnson and Javid had a heated exchange before the latter quit and the former quickly appointed Rishi Sunak said to be the man favoured by Downing Street strategist Dominic Cummings and someone more disposed to fiscal spending. In stark contrast, the Euro has endured a rough ride as a key Fib gave way at 1.0864 and 1.0850 barriers vs the Dollar were subsequently breached to leave Eur/Gbp dangling precariously above 0.8300. The single currency continues to weaken on a combination of bearish factors, including carry trades, downbeat economic indicators and obviously ever increasing technical.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>The other major outperformer even though risk sentiment via stocks and similar high-beta or sensitive assets appeared to abate over the course of the (EU) day and the Greenback retained a firm underlying bid overall. Usd/Jpy has been skirting the base of a 110.09-109.63 range for the most part despite the <strong>DXY </strong>holding a relatively tight line around 99.000 and actually notching a fresh 99.105 peak, mainly at the expense of G10 rivals and the bulk of EMs.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>All softer vs the Buck, with the Franc slipping closeogyr to 0.9800, but still on an upward trajectory against the aforementioned depreciating Euro as 1.0600 approaches (to possibly arouse SNB interest). Meanwhile, the non-US Dollars have slipped from best levels within 1.3240-70, 0.6745-08 and 0.6466-29 respective ranges for the Loonie, Aussie and Kiwi, but have been cushioned by BoC, RBA and RBNZ commentary essentially underscoring steady near term rate outlooks and comparatively upbeat economic assessments, barring severe fall-out from China’s nCoV.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Choppy trade for many regional currencies and mostly losses vs the Usd, but the Cnh and Cny displayed some resilience after the overnight revelations regarding the vastly higher Hubei infection tally using new methodology. Elsewhere, the Try and Zar gleaned traction to varied extent from decent Turkish ip and SA mining production updates, but the Brl really managed to stop the rot via the BCB announcing an FX swap auction after the Real slumped to new all time lows. Ahead, Banxico rate call for the Mxn to digest and a 25 bp cut widely expected, so guidance key for Peso direction.</p>",

Although the rebound had stalled amid source reports US administration officials believe that China is understating cases by over 100k. Most sectors opened in negative territory, apart from Real Estate and Utilities, due to the defensive nature of the sectors. Real Estate lead gains boosted by earnings from Iron Mountain (IRM) who outperformed in the SPX at the open. Materials also opened higher. On the flip side, Cyclicals underperformed which saw Industrials and Technology the laggards, with Industrials weighed on by earnings from Huntington Ingalls (HII) and Waste Management (WM), while Cisco (CSCO) losses weighed on Technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

UBS sees the headline picking up to 2.4%, a notable pick-up from the 1.7% seen in September. However, the bank says that falling oil prices mean the January reading will likely be the peak, and then sees CPI inflation easing towards around 1.6% by April. UBS sees the core measure staying in a 2.2-2.3% range through the Summer. In contrast, however, the bank sees the core PCE gauge of inflation, the Fed's preferred measure, picking up a bit more strongly than core CPI, moving towards 1.9% in February before easing in the Spring. Nonetheless, the Fed has stressed in recent commentary its aversion to any rate hikes unless inflation was to sustainably sit above its target, so how much sway the print will have on near-term Fed policy remains limited.</li></ul>",

Nonetheless, <strong>ASX 200 (+0.2%)</strong> remained afloat with a slew of earnings the main driver for the biggest movers in the index including Big 4 bank NAB and with TPG Telecom bolstered after the federal court approved its merger with Vodafone Hutchison Australia, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.1%)</strong> succumbed to the flows into the JPY and as participants also digested quarterly results. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.3%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%)</strong> were subdued amid uncertainty following the surge in confirmed cases and although some suggested the number would have been less than the prior day without the adjustments, the number of new fatalities more than doubled. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy amid the cautious risk tone and after the BoJ’s presence in the market for over JPY 1.2tln of JGBs heavily concentrated in 1yr-10yr maturities, did little to spur demand for the benchmark.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

Bourses are firmly in the red, with the FTSE 100 (-1.7%) underperforming regional peers amid a slew of factors including losses in large-cap miners, oil giants and heavyweight financials. Market contacts highlighted notable selling program triggered for Eurostoxx 50 futures and a technical break below yesterday’s low in the DAX exacerbated downside. Sectors are largely lower but reflect risk aversion as defensive fare modestly better than cyclicals, with materials and energy sectors underperforming amid price action in their respective complexes. Back to the FTSE, Barclays (-2.0%) shares fell post-earnings after the Co. noted that it would be challenging to reach a 2020 ROTE of over 10%, while UK regulators opened a probe into CEO Staley’s link to Jeffrey Epstein. Meanwhile, miners bear the brunt of declines across the base metal markets – with Antofagasta (-1.7%), Glencore (-1.9%) and BHP (-0.8%) all lower. Similarly, oil giants feel downward pressure from the price action in the energy complex, albeit BP (-2.9%) and Shell (-3.0%) also trade ex-div today. Elsewhere, SMI-heavyweight Nestle (-2.3%) shares fell after missing revenue and organic sales growth forecasts whilst also halting the production of its low-sugar brand due to coronavirus’ impact. Note: Nestle has ~19% weighting in the SMI and ~3.2% weighing in the Stoxx600. Credit Suisse (-0.7%) shares fell with the broader market after initially seeing some reprieve from earnings after posting a 69% jump in annual net profit despite the spying scandal. Other earnings-related movers include Orange (+1.9%), Centrica (-16%), Zurich Insurance (+0.7%), Clariant (+4.9%) and Pernod Ricard (+1.7%)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/XAU/DXY </strong>- The traditional safe-havens are back in demand and outperforming, as revised classification standards used to determine whether an individual has contracted the coronavirus at the source in Hubei has hugely inflated the number of confirmed cases and reignited concerns about the overall tally and contagion, especially if the new methodology is rolled out to other provinces. In response, the Yen is back above 110.00, the Franc is nearer 0.9750 than 0.9800 and Gold is back up around Usd 1575/oz from circa Usd 1560 at one stage yesterday, while the Dollar has pulled back accordingly.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR </strong>- Sterling remains relatively resilient in the face of the downturn in broad risk sentiment, albeit partly due to the Greenback losing momentum, as noted above, and the Euro continuing to depreciate amidst weak fundamentals and more outflows against currencies that are costlier to fund. However, Cable is still capped ahead of 1.3000 and the 10 DMA (1.2984 today) that was matched, but not surpassed and Eur/Gbp has not spiralled down through 0.8400 as Eur/Usd holds just above key Fib support (1.0864), for now at least.</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The DXY has slipped a bit further from Wednesday’s new multi-month high (99.052 to 98.852) on the aforementioned deterioration in risk appetite that has boosted the Jpy, Chf and Xau, though the index and Buck overall remains underpinned ahead of US CPI, weekly claims and more Fed speak via Williams. Technically, 99.249 forms nearest chart resistance, while support resides down at 98.544.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/AUD/NOK/SEK </strong>- The Loonie has lost its crude prop, but is gleaning enough support to hold around 1.3250 after comments from BoC Governor Poloz reiterating the cons of looser monetary policy and claiming that Canada’s economy is in a good place, while the Kiwi is consolidating off post-RBNZ peaks circa 0.6450 following Deputy Governor Hawkesby underlining a genuine neutral stance and the Aussie is acknowledging RBA Governor Lowe reiterating a wait-and-see bias given no rush to get inflation back to target as Aud/Usd meanders in the low 0.6700+ area and Aud/Nzd pivots 1.0425. Ahead, NZ manufacturing PMI and food prices. Elsewhere, the Norwegian Crown is naturally more attune to a dip in oil prices, but its Swedish peer is also wary about a return to risk aversion.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Widespread declines vs the Dollar including the Yuan for obvious reasons, but also the Lira even though Turkish ip beat consensus and the Rand regardless of a more pronounced recovery in SA mining production. Similary, the Mexican Peso is on the back foot awaiting the anticipated 25 bp Banxico rate cut later today.</p><p><strong>Bank of Canada Governor Poloz</strong> said the Canadian economy is in a pretty good place and suggested that lowering rates could increase risks from higher debt levels. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>RBA Governor Lowe</strong> said outlook in Australia is improving but added that coronavirus is having an uncertain impact and noted that Chinese policy stimulus will be good for Australia. Furthermore, RBA Governor Lowe said low interest rates are working and are going to take time, while he added they are not obsessed with getting inflation back to target in a hurry. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>RBNZ Assistant Governor Hawkesby</strong> said the RBNZ has a genuine neutral bias but is open to review that in light of developments, while he added that the impact from coronavirus expected to be modest but will review it if travel restrictions are prolonged or virus is more widespread. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It remains to be seen whether the latest bounce in bonds lasts or extends beyond recent peaks that are proving impervious, but the current revival has been more compelling in outright price terms given that Bunds reached 174.64, <strong>Gilts</strong> 134.32 and 10 year <strong>US T-notes</strong> 131-05+ before topping out. In contrast, EU equities have pared some declines ahead of the US open and data that may divert attention from all things China virus outbreak related for a while, then the 30 year auctions and a speech from Fed’s Williams.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI </strong>and<strong> Brent </strong>front-month futures have erased a bulk of the prior session’s gains, with prices south of 51/bbl and 55.50/bbl respectively, as the unexpected jump in coronavirus cases sparked risked aversion, while no sense of urgency from Russia regarding output action also adds to the bearish narrative. Further on the OPEC front, Kremlin stated that Moscow has not yet decided on further action with OPEC on oil cuts, adding that it will announce a deal in due course – as a reminder, the Russian Energy Ministry met with domestic oil producers yesterday with some comments alluding to most Russian companies wanting the cuts to be continued for one more quarter.

Bourses are firmly in the red, with the FTSE 100 (-1.7%) underperforming regional peers amid a slew of factors including losses in large-cap miners, oil giants and heavyweight financials. Market contacts highlighted notable selling program triggered for Eurostoxx 50 futures and a technical break below yesterday’s low in the DAX exacerbated downside. Sectors are largely lower but reflect risk aversion as defensive fare modestly better than cyclicals, with materials and energy sectors underperforming amid price action in their respective complexes. Back to the FTSE, Barclays (-2.0%) shares fell post-earnings after the Co. noted that it would be challenging to reach a 2020 ROTE of over 10%, while UK regulators opened a probe into CEO Staley’s link to Jeffrey Epstein. Meanwhile, miners bear the brunt of declines across the base metal markets – with Antofagasta (-1.7%), Glencore (-1.9%) and BHP (-0.8%) all lower. Similarly, oil giants feel downward pressure from the price action in the energy complex, albeit BP (-2.9%) and Shell (-3.0%) also trade ex-div today. Elsewhere, SMI-heavyweight Nestle (-2.3%) shares fell after missing revenue and organic sales growth forecasts whilst also halting the production of its low-sugar brand due to coronavirus’ impact. Note: Nestle has ~19% weighting in the SMI and ~3.2% weighing in the Stoxx600. Credit Suisse (-0.7%) shares fell with the broader market after initially seeing some reprieve from earnings after posting a 69% jump in annual net profit despite the spying scandal. Other earnings-related movers include Orange (+1.9%), Centrica (-16%), Zurich Insurance (+0.7%), Clariant (+4.9%) and Pernod Ricard (+1.7%)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/XAU/DXY </strong>- The traditional safe-havens are back in demand and outperforming, as revised classification standards used to determine whether an individual has contracted the coronavirus at the source in Hubei has hugely inflated the number of confirmed cases and reignited concerns about the overall tally and contagion, especially if the new methodology is rolled out to other provinces. In response, the Yen is back above 110.00, the Franc is nearer 0.9750 than 0.9800 and Gold is back up around Usd 1575/oz from circa Usd 1560 at one stage yesterday, while the Dollar has pulled back accordingly.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR </strong>- Sterling remains relatively resilient in the face of the downturn in broad risk sentiment, albeit partly due to the Greenback losing momentum, as noted above, and the Euro continuing to depreciate amidst weak fundamentals and more outflows against currencies that are costlier to fund. However, Cable is still capped ahead of 1.3000 and the 10 DMA (1.2984 today) that was matched, but not surpassed and Eur/Gbp has not spiralled down through 0.8400 as Eur/Usd holds just above key Fib support (1.0864), for now at least.</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The DXY has slipped a bit further from Wednesday’s new multi-month high (99.052 to 98.852) on the aforementioned deterioration in risk appetite that has boosted the Jpy, Chf and Xau, though the index and Buck overall remains underpinned ahead of US CPI, weekly claims and more Fed speak via Williams.

Further on the OPEC front, Kremlin stated that Moscow has not yet decided on further action with OPEC on oil cuts, adding that it will announce a deal in due course – as a reminder, the Russian Energy Ministry met with domestic oil producers yesterday with some comments alluding to most Russian companies wanting the cuts to be continued for one more quarter.

Similar to Tuesday, the majority of the move happened in the overnight session, before finding its floor in early European trade. Desks note the selling was lead by real money as dealers sought concession ahead of the 10-year auction, in what was, more broadly, the most expensive since October. Nonetheless, the USD 27bln refunding auction was fairly decent, stopping through the 1.623% WI by 0.1bps, covered 2.58x (vs. six-auction average 2.41x), and dealers didn’t have to take down as much as usual, with both directs and indirects taking more than average. How much higher the 10-year yield can move in the near term remains up to debate, there are suggestions of algos/programme sellers “lurking” above 1.64% on the 10-year yield, a level which heavy gamma hedging took place last week, a level which could be tested if expectations move closer to that of a v-shaped recovery in the global economy post the coronavirus. By settlement, yields were higher across the curve with the 10-year yield at 1.63%, seeing the 2s10s widen by just under 1.5bps. US T-note futures (H20) settled 10 ticks lower at 130-22.</p><p>US Federal Budget (USD)(Jan) -33.0B vs. Exp. -11.5B (Prev. -13.3B). (Newswires)</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade cautious as the euphoria from the record highs on Wall St, where participants found solace from hopes of a slowdown in the coronavirus outbreak, was soured by a significant jump in the number of additional cases at the epicentre of the outbreak. The Hubei province reported 14840 new coronavirus cases and 242 more deaths as of February 12th in which 13332 of the cases were made by clinical diagnosis and with the latest figures under revised standards. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.2%) remains afloat with a slew of earnings the main driver for the biggest movers in the index including Big 4 bank NAB and with TPG Telecom bolstered after the federal court approved its merger with Vodafone Hutchison Australia, while Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) treads water under the weight of the flows into the JPY and as participants also digest quarterly results. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) are subdued amid uncertainty following the surge in confirmed cases and although some suggested the number would have been less than the prior day without the adjustments, the number of new fatalities more than doubled.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY stalled after printing fresh 3-month highs above the 99.00 level where it met resistance to provide some much needed reprieve for EUR/USD which languishes firmly below the 1.0900 handle after the recent dismal Industrial Production data, while GBP/USD is uneventful near the 1.2950 level and sandwiched in between a cluster of Hourly-MA levels. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slipped below 110.00 and antipodeans were also pressured as markets were spooked on the announcement of the surge in coronavirus cases, although the relevant pairs are off their lows as the uncertainty spurs broad cautiousness. In addition, there were comments from RBA Governor Lowe who continued to suggest a lack of urgency to loosen policy as he noted that low interest rates are working but will take time and that they are not obsessed with getting inflation back to target in a hurry.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are choppy amid the cautious risk tone and with the BoJ’s presence in the market for over JPY 1.2tln of JGBs heavily concentrated in 1yr-10yr maturities, doing little to spur demand for the benchmark.</p>",
