Trump announced a “deal” on intellectual property, financial services, and big agricultural purchases (for which China is said to purchase between USD 40bln-50bln of Ags.); adding that the sides had “agreed” on FX issues and made “progress” on tech transfers. Negotiations on Phase two are said to begin after Phase one is signed. The Trump administration is to delay the implementation of the October 15th tariffs, but has not yet made a decision on the December tariffs. Trump said US is working on enforcement currently, there is a provision for such, adding that “we are close to ending the trade war”. In regard to a signing, Trump said it could happen with Chinese President Xi at the APEC meeting in Chile next month, but caveated that he doesn’t think the deal will fall apart over the next few weeks, but a possibility it would (it is hard to infer whether this is typical give and take Trump commentary, or an ominous indication). Elsewhere under the hood, there was no decisions on the Huawei issue this time around – that will be included in the next phase; some IP aspects are said to be agreed in Phase two also; Hong Kong was discussed, where Trump played down the issue, saying things would sort themselves out in the region; Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the US would be evaluating whether to rescind the currency manipulation designation on China. Trump after said that the Fed should still cut rates despite the deal, with the situation “more important” than the Federal Reserve. CNN reported that the Chinese delegation had invited USTR Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and their teams for further talks in China ahead of the APEC summit in Chile next month.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The meeting between EU negotiator Barnier and UK Brexit Secretary Barclay was framed as “constructive”, and that the two sides were working towards a deal. This later resulted in Barnier receiving the green light from the EU27 for intensified negotiations. The positive updates saw Cable continue its rally to highs above 1.27. However, some had caveated the “tunnel” with the light at the end of this tunnel, being rather small and that it should not be qualified as a breakthrough. Barnier told the EU 27, that the UK had agreed to accept a solution to replace the backstop and that it cannot form a customs border on the Island of Ireland, sources stated. Other sources said that Northern Ireland would effectively stay in the EU customs union, but for purposes of trade, to be within the UK’s customs union. Some had questioned whether the ERG or DUP would be willing to accept this deal, making the parliamentary maths somewhat complicated,&nbsp; however, the DUP’s Foster said it recognised the need to be flexible, and to look at specific solutions, but if N.Ireland were to be trapped within the customs union, it would not have the DUP’s support. Buzzfeed reported that the so-called ‘UK Spartans’ (ERG) were up for a deal, and were willing to take a ‘pragmatic look’ at a compromise along the lines of which had been suggested today, but adding their priority is to leave with or without a deal.</p><p><strong>* FED PURCHASES: </strong>As Fed chair Powell had suggested earlier in the week,<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>Fed announced that it will begin purchases of Treasury Bills from October 15th (also the next US coupon settlement date) at an initial pace of USD 60bln per month, beginning with the mid-October to mid-November period, and to occur until at least Q2 2020, in addition to current reinvestments from principle payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Fed declared these upcoming purchases as purely technical measures, which it would adjust as needed and not a monetary policy stance change (echoing comments from Fed Chair Powell who emphasized the approaching measures were not QE). The overnight repo and term repo operations were also announced to be extended “at least through January.” Desks noted that the potential for communications mismanagement with participants already expecting an October rate cut, the sudden balance sheet growth resumption could indeed be digested as new QE – exactly what Powell stressed it wasn’t. However, the purchases are focused on the short-end of the curve to address “technical” issues in the funding markets, whereas previously, QE has not been term discriminative, with the intention of supressing yields across the curve to stimulate borrowing and investment in the wider economy.</p><p><strong>* CANADA SEPTEMBER JOBS REPORT: </strong>It was another solid performance, with 53.7k jobs being added, eclipsing the 10k forecast; the gains were led by full-time jobs, rising 70k, with part-time jobs falling by 16.3k. Wages rose to a clip of 4.3% Y/Y from 3.8%. The jobless rate fell by 0.2ppts to 5.5%, however, the participation rate eased to 65.7% (from 65.8%). Canadian bank RBC observes that the labour force is growing at its fastest pace in more than a decade, helping sustain job growth late in the economic cycle. Wage growth, which was previously the missing link in a strong labour market backdrop, has picked up momentum too, \"The combination of expanding employment and rising wages has provided some insulation for consumers, some of whom have faced higher debt servicing costs after rate hikes in 2017 and 2018,\" the bank writes, \"today’s data suggest the BoC doesn’t need to rush to undo those earlier rate hikes, even as other central banks are opting for additional accommodation.\" BOC's Deputy Governor Schembri recently noted a \"solid starting point,\" including a strong labour market, gives the economy welcome resilience to \"possible negative economic developments.\" RBC says \"those developments are hard to ignore, though, with mounting signs of a slowdown in Europe and some concerning survey data out of the US,\" adding that this \"could still make for a cautious tone from the BoC on 30th October, even if the labour market continues to point to a resilient domestic economy.\"</p><p><strong>* US OCTOBER UNI. OF MICHIGAN: </strong>It was a solid report, with the headline outside the top end of the forecast range (96.0 versus consensus 92.0, prior 93.2); additionally, expectations and conditions all improved on the prior, against expectations of a fall. \"This is a pleasant surprise, but the next few months will be a real test of consumers' resolve, as the first broad tariffs on consumer goods work through at the retail level and payroll growth slows to just 50K or so,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics says, \"more immediately, the October headline index was lifted mostly by a 4.9-point increase in the current conditions component, which has been underperforming relative to the pace of layoffs, as captured by the jobless claims numbers.\" Pantheon says the increase appears to be a correction rather than the start of a renewed uptrend. Meanwhile, the inflation expectations component fell in the month, but remains within ranges. Overall, Pantheon says, consumers are still happy by historical standards, but it says it would be surprised to see the current numbers sustained through the remainder of the fall and winter.</p><p><strong>* ECB</strong>: Sources said that the ECB would run out of German bonds to buy in just over a year if it followed capital key. Policymakers reportedly would rather bend the capital key rather than change issuer limits, the report said, noting that the past practice of flexibility on capital key could give the central bank more than a year to buy bunds. Policymakers reportedly have little appetite to significantly raise the share of private debt in QE. ECB’s Villeroy said the central bank must maintain accommodative monetary policy in the face of a slowdown and weak inflation, adding it is very desirable for budgetary policy to extend past monetary support everywhere in Europe. Villeroy said the September meeting was behind us, and the decisions were legitimately made, and attention must now look forward. Meanwhile, ECB's Kazmir said the Eurozone budget deal was a disappointment, and describes it as a 'mere band aid'.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed’s Rosengren (Voter, Hawk, Dissenter) reiterated that he does not see a case to cut rates, calling for patience, as the economy still continues to do well, but if the economy does call for it, he would support it. Rosengren said the question remains whether the resilience of the US consumer, which he said is not itself a certain, can continue to offset the negative effects of the trade wars and slower global growth. Fed's Kashkari (2020 voter, dove) said the time to provide a shock with a 50bps cut had passed – he had previously been in favour of such action.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 26+ TICKS AT 129-28: </strong>At settlement on Friday (and as we await an update on Trump/Liu He talks), yields are up across the curve by between around 7-10bps on optimism that a partial trade deal between US and China has removed some near-term risk facing the global economy. Additionally, in Europe, there are also hopes of a Brexit breakthrough on the cards; in both stories, however, analysts are cautious (the thin China trade deal, as reported, still has a number of outstanding issues, including intellectual property, market access, industrial subsidies, tech transfers; while the Brexit issues of the Stormont lock and the customs border still appear to be issues). The Fed announced it would enter the market to buy bills, seeing the curve steepen, though reiterated it was not QE, and was not part of its monetary policy. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed, with 2s5s and 2s10s wider by around 2bps, though 2s30s, 5s10s, 5s30s, 10s30s have narrowed.</p><p><strong>* IEA MONTHLY REPORT:</strong> The IEA was the last of the energy agency troika to report a cut in its 2019 oil demand growth, cutting by 100k BPD to 1mln BPD, also cutting its 2020 forecast by the same magnitude to 1.2mln BPD; the IEA sees further stock draws as likely in the tail end of this year, but production growth in the US, Brazil and Norway in 2020 should counter this, placing a larger burden on OPEC. As a reminder, this week, OPEC lowered their oil demand growth forecast for 2019 by slightly less than EIA in its STEO, released on Tuesday, cutting it by 0.04mln bpd to EIA’s 0.05mln bpd cut. OPEC’s forecast for 2019 oil demand growth remains higher than EIA’s, at 0.98mln bpd vs. 0.84mln bpd.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 1.15 HIGHER AT USD 54.70/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 1.41 HIGHER AT USD 60.51/BBL: </strong>Oil prices traded on the front-foot, ultimately ending the week higher, thanks to the gravitation towards a US-China trade agreement that would at least some form of near term “truce”, although the official announcement and conclusion of the talks will be critical in deciding the market’s next direction. The missile attack on an Iranian oil tanker (details thin) - carrying 1mln bbls - in Saudi Arabia’s waters also struck a bullish undertone on the elevation of supply concerns; Citi’s analysts suspect an internal explosion in a partially filled tank rather than an external missile attack, given the lack of visible damage above the ship’s decks. Meanwhile, the 150k BPD capacity Buzzard North Sea oilfield still remains closed with operation CNOOC saying there still remains no timeline for a resumption. The latest Baker Hughes rig count showed US oil rigs +2 at 712, US nat gas rigs -1 at 143 and total US rigs +1 at 856.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS (TURKEY/SYRIA, HK): </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced that Trump is to sign an executive order allowing \"very significant\" primary and secondary tariffs on Turkey, but is not going ahead with tariffs as of yet, although he put Turkish financial institutions on notice. The situation in Turkey continues to deteriorate, reports of intensive Turkish air raids on areas in north-east Syria, with the US believing the incursion is not to end any time soon. There were also reports in Newsweek that the Turkish had accidentally shelled US Special Forces in its attacks. Last night, US President Trump reiterated his hard stance on Turkey, although he provided three possible options, the most extreme being to “send in thousands of troops and win militarily” with the other two options being to hit Turkey financially with sanctions, or to mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds. Although, House GOP’s announced it will introduce sanctions against Turkey, and France confirms that at next week’s EU summit, sanctions on Turkey will be on the table. Over in Hong Kong, reports suggest the protestors are considering whether to scale back on vandalism and violence as it risks pushing away more moderate supporters.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 1.1% at 2970, NASDAQ-100 1.3% at 7844, Dow Jones 1.2% at 26817</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 1.2%, Consumer Staples -0.1%, Energy 1.4%, Financials 1.3%, Health Care 0.8%, Industrials 2%, Information Technology 1.5%, Materials 1.9%, Telecommunication Services 1%, Utilities -0.4%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Apple (AAPL) made new all-time highs on positive risk sentiment; trade sensitive stocks outperformed in general. Fastenal (FAST) rallied after beating on both top and bottom lines. Match (MTCH) traded red as IAC (IAC) proposed a full separation of MTCH from its remaining businesses, IAC was in the black. Newmont Gold (NEM) underperformed as gold prices sold-off on a positive risk appetite. Uber (UBER) firmed amid acquiring a majority ownership in Cornershop, a move into online grocery deliveries in South America. General Motors (GM) traded higher as it urged the UAW to agree to around the clock bargaining to resolve the strike. GM also proposed a new offer to UAW on Oct. 7th where it would increase compensation through wages and lump sum payments, and for temporary workers the offer also would create a clear path to permanent employment plus a ratification bonus. Walmart (WMT) announced its Chief Executive in the US, Greg Foran, will depart the company early next year and is to be replaced by the head of its Sam’s club chain unit, John Furner. A couple of stories for Boeing (BA): the International Air Safety Panel has faulted the FAA review of Boeing’s 737 MAX Jet safety system that was later tied to the two crashes that killed 346 people. Elsewhere, United Airlines (UAL) joined others in delaying the return of the 737 MAX jet to January from December. Roku (ROKU) made gains following an upgrade at RBC, Square (SQ) also benefitting from an upgrade at Susquehanna.</p><p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP:</strong></p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> The Pound has enjoyed a stellar end to the week, with initial traction coming from UK data on Thursday as an unexpected m/m GDP contraction was compensated by upgrades to prior prints, but the mood really improved after a so called ‘last ditch’ meeting between PM Johnson and his Irish counterpart Varadkar to try and resolve difference on the backstop or rather alternative customs arrangements for the North/South border. In short, the talks were deemed to be productive and the joint takeaway was that a pathway towards a possible deal had been laid. Cable catapulted further from sub-1.2200 weekly lows, while Eur/Gbp pulled back from 0.9000+ 1 month peaks before the moves extended in advance of Friday’s convene between Britain’s Brexit Minister Barclay and his EU peer Barnier that was also constructive enough for the latter to emerge from a full briefing with member states with the go ahead to enter intensive discussions. Cable subsequently climbed to just over 1.2700 before fading and hovering around a key Fib level (1.2670 represents a 50% retracement of the ytd move from high to low), while Eur/Gbp hit a base only pips off 0.8700 awaiting further developments from the intensified if not quite tunnel phase of negotiations.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong>: The Loonie finally broke out of a relatively narrow range and its vigil on broad risk sentiment/oil prices/Greenback moves on the back of a significantly stronger than anticipated Canadian jobs report that revealed bumper rise in payrolls that would have been even higher without a decline in part-timers and came with a healthy looking acceleration in average earnings (unlike last Friday’s US NFP). Although some alluded to the pre-election boost in Government hiring as a mitigating factor, Usd/Cad tested the water south of 1.3200 having breached the prior October low compared to highs of 1.3345 at one stage.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CNH</strong>: US-China trade deal optimism or even euphoria has propelled the Aussie and Kiwi from circa 0.6710 and 0.6280 vs their US rival to 0.6809 (Fib and September 20 high) and almost 0.6350 respectively amidst positively positive commentary from several principle players involved in the Washington showdown and even the Global Times Editor who is not always as enthused or bullish than others. Indeed, he claimed that the status may be better than the media is expecting, while President Trump teased that good things are happening, all helping the Yuan pare losses from 7.1650+ to 7.0800 or even better and more in line with the official Usd/CNY PBoC mid-point fixing (7.0727).</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency has also proffered from rising risk appetite, a sharp rebound in global bond yields and less dovish ECB vibes via the September policy meeting minutes and sourced stories. Eur/Usd took a while to clear resistance ahead of 1.1000, like the 21 DMA and a Fib level before stalling multiple times into more upside chart points above the big figure (like 1.1021), but eventually breached 1.1050 on its way to 1.1062 and 1.1054/55 (55 DMA and another Fib).</p><p><strong>USD/CHF/JPY/XAU:</strong> The usual or traditional safe-havens have all endured tough weeks, largely on the aforementioned upbeat market morale fostered by the US-Sino trade and Brexit bandwagon, but also on other factors, like soft US PPI data and FOMC minutes maintaining guidance for more policy action to sustain economic growth, as statistical models point to a greater recession risk. Meanwhile, the NY Fed rolled out more balance sheet expansion as signalled by Fed chair Powell to start on October 15 (Usd 60 bn/month through Q2 next year at least) in time for the next coupon payments and to avoid the potential repeat of the recent repo squeeze, so a technical round of asset buying, not QE!. DXY down to a new weekly low at 98.188 vs 99.247 at the other extreme, Usd/Chf close to parity from not far off 0.9900, Usd/Jpy through 108.50 Japanese exporter offers compared to a low circa 100 pips belo and Gold hovering around Usd 1474/oz vs circa Usd 1516 at best.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/TRY:</strong> Volatile trade for the Scandi Crowns with initial weakness post-weak PMIs and less hawkish Riksbank and Norges Bank policy perceptions compounded by bearish technical impulses, but the general upturn in risk sentiment and inflation data (Swedish metrics above consensus and Norwegian mixed) prompted a retreat in Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok. Conversely, downturns in Usd/Try were shallow and short-lived as the Lira lamented Turkey’s military offensive in Northern Syria and the international outcry that included more US sanctions and could see the EU follow suit at next week’s summit.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* IEA MONTHLY REPORT:</strong> The IEA was the last of the energy agency troika to report a cut in its 2019 oil demand growth, cutting by 100k BPD to 1mln BPD, also cutting its 2020 forecast by the same magnitude to 1.2mln BPD; the IEA sees further stock draws as likely in the tail end of this year, but production growth in the US, Brazil and Norway in 2020 should counter this, placing a larger burden on OPEC. As a reminder, this week, OPEC lowered their oil demand growth forecast for 2019 by slightly less than EIA in its STEO, released on Tuesday, cutting it by 0.04mln bpd to EIA’s 0.05mln bpd cut. OPEC’s forecast for 2019 oil demand growth remains higher than EIA’s, at 0.98mln bpd vs. 0.84mln bpd.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD AT USD /BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD AT USD /BBL: </strong>Oil prices traded on the front-foot, ultimately ending the week higher, thanks to the gravitation towards a US-China trade agreement that would at least some form of near term “truce”, although the official announcement and conclusion of the talks will be critical in deciding the market’s next direction. The missile attack on an Iranian oil tanker (details thin) - carrying 1mln bbls - in Saudi Arabia’s waters also struck a bullish undertone on the elevation of supply concerns; Citi’s analysts suspect an internal explosion in a partially filled tank rather than an external missile attack, given the lack of visible damage above the ship’s decks. Meanwhile, the 150k BPD capacity Buzzard North Sea oilfield still remains closed with operation CNOOC saying there still remains no timeline for a resumption. The latest Baker Hughes rig count showed US oil rigs +2 at 712, US nat gas rigs -1 at 143 and total US rigs +1 at 856.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound has enjoyed a stellar end to the week, with initial traction coming from UK data on Thursday as an unexpected m/m GDP contraction was compensated by upgrades to prior prints, but the mood really improved after a so called ‘last ditch’ meeting between PM Johnson and his Irish counterpart Varadkar to try and resolve difference on the backstop or rather alternative customs arrangements for the North/South border. In short, the talks were deemed to be productive and the joint takeaway was that a pathway towards a possible deal had been laid. Cable catapulted further from sub-1.2200 weekly lows, while Eur/Gbp pulled back from 0.9000+ 1 month peaks before the moves extended in advance of Friday’s convene between Britain’s Brexit Minister Barclay and his EU peer Barnier that was also constructive enough for the latter to emerge from a full briefing with member states with the go ahead to enter intensive discussions. Cable subsequently climbed to just over 1.2700 before fading and hovering around a key Fib level (1.2670 represents a 50% retracement of the ytd move from high to low), while Eur/Gbp hit a base only pips off 0.8700 awaiting further developments from the intensified if not quite tunnel phase of negotiations.</p><p><strong>CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Loonie finally broke out of a relatively narrow range and its vigil on broad risk sentiment/oil prices/Greenback moves on the back of a significantly stronger than anticipated Canadian jobs report that revealed bumper rise in payrolls that would have been even higher without a decline in part-timers and came with a healthy looking acceleration in average earnings (unlike last Friday’s US NFP). Although some alluded to the pre-election boost in Government hiring as a mitigating factor, Usd/Cad tested the water south of 1.3200 having breached the prior October low compared to highs of 1.3345 at one stage.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CNH</strong></p><p>US-China trade deal optimism or even euphoria has propelled the Aussie and Kiwi from circa 0.6710 and 0.6280 vs their US rival to 0.6809 (Fib and September 20 high) and almost 0.6350 respectively amidst positively positive commentary from several principle players involved in the Washington showdown and even the Global Times Editor who is not always as enthused or bullish than others. Indeed, he claimed that the status may be better than the media is expecting, while President Trump teased that good things are happening, all helping the Yuan pare losses from 7.1650+ to 7.0800 or even better and more in line with the official Usd/<strong>CNY </strong>PBoC mid-point fixing (7.0727).</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency has also proffered from rising risk appetite, a sharp rebound in global bond yields and less dovish ECB vibes via the September policy meeting minutes and sourced stories. Eur/Usd took a while to clear resistance ahead of 1.1000, like the 21 DMA and a Fib level before stalling multiple times into more upside chart points above the big figure (like 1.1021), but eventually breached 1.1050 on its way to 1.1062 and 1.1054/55 (55 DMA and another Fib).</p><p><strong>USD/CHF/JPY/XAU</strong></p><p>The usual or traditional safe-havens have all endured tough weeks, largely on the aforementioned upbeat market morale fostered by the US-Sino trade and Brexit bandwagon, but also on other factors, like soft US PPI data and FOMC minutes maintaining guidance for more policy action to sustain economic growth, as statistical models point to a greater recession risk. Meanwhile, the NY Fed rolled out more balance sheet expansion as signalled by Fed chair Powell to start on October 15 (Usd 60 bn/month through Q2 next year at least) in time for the next coupon payments and to avoid the potential repeat of the recent repo squeeze, so a technical round of asset buying, not QE!. DXY down to a new weekly low at 98.188 vs 99.247 at the other extreme, Usd/Chf close to parity from not far off 0.9900, Usd/Jpy through 108.50 Japanese exporter offers compared to a low circa 100 pips belo and Gold hovering around Usd 1474/oz vs circa Usd 1516 at best.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/TRY</strong></p><p>Volatile trade for the Scandi Crowns with initial weakness post-weak PMIs and less hawkish Riksbank and Norges Bank policy perceptions compounded by bearish technical impulses, but the general upturn in risk sentiment and inflation data (Swedish metrics above consensus and Norwegian mixed) prompted a retreat in Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok. Conversely, downturns in Usd/Try were shallow and short-lived as the Lira lamented Turkey’s military offensive in Northern Syria and the international outcry that included more US sanctions and could see the EU follow suit at next week’s summit.</p>",

Sectors clearly illustrate the mornings heavy newsflow. With IT the notable outperformer following SAP (+7.6%) reporting earnings which were above Prev. and news that the CEO is to step down with immediate effect being well received. Also, firmer this morning are energy names following an Iranian tanker incident this morning, which is outlined in the Commodity section below. However, consumer discretionary names are suffering on the back of Hugo Boss (-13.3%) cutting their FY19 EBIT target citing persistent macroeconomic uncertainties; alongside, a number of downgrades at brokerages. Elsewhere, the FTSE 100 is this morning’s clear laggard given the recent upside in Sterling on positive Irish/UK PM comments regarding Brexit. However, in-spite of the index’s weakness the upbeat Brexit commentary has lent support to politically sensitive Co’s such as housebuilders and banks; although most recent comments from EU Council President Tusk have brought yet more urgency into the talks stating if there are no sufficient proposals today then he will have to announce there is no chance for a deal at next week’s summit.</p><p>International Air Safety Panel have faulted the FAA for their certification of the <strong>Boeing (BA)</strong> 737 Max; FAA failed to sufficiently assess the MCAS system, did not sufficiently consider now design features of the craft, some regulations are out of date. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>AUD - Aud/Usd has extended gains beyond 0.6750 and through the 50 DMA (0.6778) to within a whisker of 0.6800 on a wave of US-China trade optimism after day one of talks in Washington and generally positive updates from both sides on the status of trade negotiations thus far.</p><p>GBP - Yet another white knuckle ride for Sterling after a more pronounced short squeeze on Irish backstop breakthrough hype inspired by Thursday’s meeting between UK PM Johnson and Ireland’s Varadkar, and the latest catalyst came via EU’s Tusk rather Britain’s Brexit Minister Barclay or EU kingpin Barnier that have now completed their rendezvous to discuss the situation. In short, Tusk said the deadline for alternative border/customs proposals is today and as yet they have not been submitted, prompting an abrupt/sharp Pound plunge, but then revived bullish momentum by noting that promising signs from the Irish PM mean a deal can still be done. In terms of market moves, Cable collapsed to almost 1.2400 before regrouping and flying back up to 1.2500+ awaiting the debriefing from Barnier to EU states and fading just short of 1.2550, while Eur/Gbp has whipsawed between 0.8867-0.8789 and is poised just above 0.8800, but below the 200 DMA (0.8830).</p><p>NZD/EUR/CAD - All firmer vs a flagging Greenback (DXY only just holding above 98.500), with the Kiwi piggy-backing its Antipodean counterpart and climbing towards 0.6350, Euro consolidating above 1.1000 and Loonie maintaining a bid over 1.3300 ahead of Canadian jobs data and as oil prices rally in wake of an Iranian tanker missile attack . Back to Eur/Usd, decent option expiries at the 1.1000 strike may figure (1.4 bn), while tech levels could also influence trade/direction given Fibs at 1.1021 and 1.1055 and DMAs at 1.1054 and 1.0987 (55 and 21 respectively).</p><p>CHF/JPY - More safe-haven unwinding has nudged the Franc a bit nearer parity vs the Dollar and a test of 1.1000 against the single currency, while the Yen has slipped under 108.00 to expose September’s peak a fraction below 108.50.</p><p>EM - The Cnh is also anticipating good news from the President Trump-VP Lui He date at the White House that will officially close the latest round of talks, with the offshore Yuan hovering around 7.0900, but the Try has retreated in wake of US sanctions over Turkey’s military actions in Syria awaiting the EU’s response at next week’s summit – Lira back down towards 5.8750.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Core bonds have lost all and more of their earlier recovery momentum, with Gilts leading the latest leg down on the Brexit bandwagon and premise that the EU may also have deemed latest developments worthy of pursuing efforts to forge a deal. Indeed, Barnier’s meeting with Barclay is said to have been constructive following along the same line as Johnson and Varadkar on Thursday when the 2 PMs declared that there is a path towards reaching agreement/compromise on Irish border checks. The 10 year UK benchmark has been down to 132.54, dragging Bunds back under 173.00 and the T-note to 130-15+, breaching Fib support (130-17) and very close aligning/clustered downside chart levels (130-14, 13, 12) that could exacerbate the retracement if broken. Ahead, a few NA data/survey releases and Fed speakers ahead of the long US holiday weekend.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Brent and WTI</strong> have been lifted this morning to gains of over USD 1/bbl at best on the back of early geopolitical newsflow that a <strong>Iranian tanker was on fire after a explosion near Saudi’s Jeddah port</strong> which led to heavy tanker damage and reports that oil was leaking into the Red Sea. TankerTrackers believe this tanker could be the SINOPA tanker which was on route to Syria and had a cargo of 1mln barrels on board. Subsequently, <strong>newsflow noted that the explosion was due to missiles</strong> and there were some reports that this originated from Saudi Arabia; however, Iran’s National Tanker Co. have denied reports that they said the missiles originated from Saudi Arabia though the Foreign Ministry confirm two hits on the tanker. The updates evidently led to a crude bid on further geopolitical tensions, particularly as reports note this is the 3rd Iranian tanker to be hit in around 6-months in this area; focus now turns to clarity on where the missiles originated from. Separately, today’s IEA report marked the end of the monthly trio where they cut their demand forecast form 2019 in stead with the other two reports. In terms of metals, spot gold was lifted above the USD 1500/oz mark on the middle-east geopolitical premium with the upcoming US-China trade talks also in focus; although it has since dropped back below.</p><p><strong>IEA Monthly Report:</strong> 2019 oil demand forecast cut to 1mln bpd from 1.1mln bpd, 2020 cut to 1.2mln bpd from 1.3mln bpd.

Back to Eur/Usd, decent option expiries at the 1.1000 strike may figure (1.4 bn), while tech levels could also influence trade/direction given Fibs at 1.1021 and 1.1055 and DMAs at 1.1054 and 1.0987 (55 and 21 respectively).</p><p>CHF/JPY - More safe-haven unwinding has nudged the Franc a bit nearer parity vs the Dollar and a test of 1.1000 against the single currency, while the Yen has slipped under 108.00 to expose September’s peak a fraction below 108.50.</p><p>EM - The Cnh is also anticipating good news from the President Trump-VP Lui He date at the White House that will officially close the latest round of talks, with the offshore Yuan hovering around 7.0900, but the Try has retreated in wake of US sanctions over Turkey’s military actions in Syria awaiting the EU’s response at next week’s summit – Lira back down towards 5.8750.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Core bonds have lost all and more of their earlier recovery momentum, with Gilts leading the latest leg down on the Brexit bandwagon and premise that the EU may also have deemed latest developments worthy of pursuing efforts to forge a deal. Indeed, Barnier’s meeting with Barclay is said to have been constructive following along the same line as Johnson and Varadkar on Thursday when the 2 PMs declared that there is a path towards reaching agreement/compromise on Irish border checks. The 10 year UK benchmark has been down to 132.54, dragging Bunds back under 173.00 and the T-note to 130-15+, breaching Fib support (130-17) and very close aligning/clustered downside chart levels (130-14, 13, 12) that could exacerbate the retracement if broken. Ahead, a few NA data/survey releases and Fed speakers ahead of the long US holiday weekend.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Brent and WTI have been lifted this morning to gains of over USD 1/bbl at best on the back of early geopolitical newsflow that a Iranian tanker was on fire after an explosion near Saudi’s Jeddah port which led to heavy tanker damage and reports that oil was leaking into the Red Sea. TankerTrackers believe this tanker could be the SINOPA tanker which was on route to Syria and had a cargo of 1mln barrels on board. Subsequently, newsflow noted that the explosion was due to missiles and there were some reports that this originated from Saudi Arabia; however, Iran’s National Tanker Co. have denied reports that they said the missiles originated from Saudi Arabia though the Foreign Ministry confirm two hits on the tanker. The updates evidently led to a crude bid on further geopolitical tensions, particularly as reports note this is the 3rd Iranian tanker to be hit in around 6-months in this area; focus now turns to clarity on where the missiles originated from. Separately, today’s IEA report marked the end of the monthly trio where they cut their demand forecast form 2019 in stead with the other two reports. In terms of metals, spot gold was lifted above the USD 1500/oz mark on the middle-east geopolitical premium with the upcoming US-China trade talks also in focus; although it has since dropped back below.</p>",

Consolidation and short covering has been exacerbated by an element of safe-haven demand following reports of an Iranian oil tanker missile attack, while Turkey’s ongoing military offensive also warrants attention given the threat of escalation and further international retaliation in the form of sanctions, or worse. Looking at Eurex price action in more detail, Bunds have rebounded 41 ticks, but remain toppy just ahead of 173.00, which was Thursday’s close.</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) is supported by energy and mining names, whilst Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) feels tailwind for a weaker Yen. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.4%) outperformed as heavyweight financials and oil-related stocks bolster the index amid a high-yield and firmer oil price environment. Meanwhile, Shanghai Comp (Unch) swings between gains and losses with the mainland remains on-guard as sticking points remain between the two largest economies.</p><p>In FX markets, DXY held onto a bulk of the prior day’s losses which emanated from optimism surrounding US-Sino trade talks, with dialogue to continue today. The Index meanders around yesterday’s low (99.62) ahead of the psychological 99.50 and its 50 DMA at 99.38. EUR/USD and GBP/USD are largely moving in tandem with the Greenback, with the former retaining its 1.1000+ statusm, although today’s NY cut sees over 1bln expiring at 1.1000 and around 1.5bln at 1.0950. Meanwhile, GBP/USD remains north of 1.2400 amid hopes of a Brexit deal after the Irish PM said an arrangement is possible by Halloween. This saw Cable take out its 50 and 100 DMAs (1.2264 and 1.2407 respectively) to the upside before peaking at 1.2469 and stabilising sub-1.2450. Elsewhere, USD/JPY saw marginal upticks heading into the Tokyo fix after President Trump stated that China had been “very nice”. The pair briefly breached 108.00 to the upside before drifting back below the figure. CNH also saw some strength heading into the Tokyo fix, albeit marginal and short-lived. Finally, AUD/USD is modestly firmer amid relief that the Chinese delegation will be staying for Day 2 of talks. AUD/USD trades just below its 50 DMA (0.67778) whilst NZD/USD traded sideways as it failed to capitalise on trade optimism following disappointing September electronic card retail sales.</p>",
