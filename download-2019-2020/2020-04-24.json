The fundamental backdrop hasn’t changed drastically since Thursday’s remdesivir trial “flop” report, although a Reuters report that US remdesivir trials were running ahead of schedule did provide some support, although gains had been made before then. It appeared to be more that risk has clawed its way back. The SPX now sits above 2830; Credit Suisse has recently cited that any sustained move above 2836 would curtail its thoughts of a near-term top, and instead open the door to a test of 2879/83, and potentially even as far as 2934. However, many are cautious on whether major indices have much room left to run, with heat areas such as energy and HY debt posing near-term threats. TD’s analyst notes, that while the VIX/VIX3M relationship has moved back into contango at least for now - a precondition for turning bullish - the analyst still believes a second equity bottom will be made. Internally today, Tech/Growth had started the session as the underperformer, where INTC and GOOG weighed on the NDQ, and at the same time value plays such as energy were outperforming - no doubt supported by Mnuchin’s mentioning of potential stakes in US oil companies, in addition to firmer oil prices. Meanwhile, yields were slightly lower, with the TPLEX catching a bid in the late session as the Fed cut its USTs/TIPS purchases schedule to 10bln/day from 15bln/day, a less pronounced cut than previous weeks.</p><h2><strong>VIRUS CASE COUNT</strong></h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Thursday (via state official health departments) against Wednesday:</strong></i></p><ul><li><strong>US: </strong>cases +4.5% at 865,585 (Prev. 828,411); death toll +5.3% at 48,816 (prev. 46,379)</li><li><strong>NEW YORK</strong>: cases +3.1% at 271,590 (prev. +2.4% at 263,460); death toll rises 1.2% to 15,941 (prev. +2.9% at 15,740)</li><li><strong>ITALY:</strong> cases at +1.6% at 192,994 (prev. +1.4% at 189,973); death toll +420 (+1.6%) to 25,969 (Prev. +1.6% at 25,549)</li><li><strong>FRANCE: </strong>cases +1.5% 122,577 (prev. +1.4% 120,804) death toll +1.8% at 22,245 (prev. +2.4% at 21,856)</li><li><strong>UK:</strong> cases rise to 143,464 (prev. 138,078), death toll rises to 19,506 (prev. 18,738); deaths rise by 684 (+4.10%) vs. yesterday's increase of 616 (+3.52%)</li><li><strong>CANADA: </strong>cases rise to 42,750 (prev. 40,824), death toll rise to 2,197 (prev. 2,028)</li></ul><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLES UP USD 0.44 AT USD 16.94/BBL; WTI (N0) SETTLES USD 0.22 LOWER AT USD 21.22/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLES UP USD 0.11 at 21.44/bbl; BRENT (N0) SETTLES UP 0.02 AT 24.81.BBL/BBL</strong></p><p>Oil futures made the most of their gains in the European session, alongside US equity futures, before finding their highs and moving sideways through till settlement. Again, oil prices have been moving on their own accord, seemingly not nudging to incremental news flow. However, the Angolan Petroleum Minister said that OPEC++ production cuts are not sufficient to balance the oil market, and producers may be called to take further drastic measures. The comment on the market imbalance echoes a vast number of analysts, including IEA Chief Birol, who has stressed a number of times that the actions taken by OPEC++ are not enough to balance the demand drop. Meanwhile, US President Trump said he believes Saudi and Russia could make further production cuts and that it would be a natural process going ahead; Trump also quipped that Texas, Oklahoma and Canada are all cutting production. Note, the US Oil Fund (USO) saw another portfolio re-allocation where it now may allocate 20% of its portfolio in June contracts (prev. 20%), 40% in July futures (Prev. 50%), 20% in August (Prev. 20%) and 20% in September (Prev. 10%). The latest Baker Hughes Rig Count data saw oil rigs -60 at 378, nat gas -4 at 85, total -64 at 465.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>After the US House (and Trump) passed the coronavirus relief bill, as expected, talks are on the way for Stimulus v4. House Speaker Pelosi stated they will be ready soon with the next bill to fight coronavirus, following comments from Senate Minority Leader Schumer that momentum is growing for Congressional relief package for state and local governments. Later, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on the energy sector said it can be assumed that one option is the government taking stakes in energy companies, noting several options are being examined. Trump also floated the idea of the government purchasing fuel in the US in advance, as well as airline tickets. Mnuchin also suggested one component was to look at providing a lending facility for the energy industry, however no conclusion has been made. On the next round of stimulus, there are three key features desks will be looking for in the next round of stimulus: relief for state and local governments (a Democrat demand they wanted in the v3.5 stimulus bill); infrastructure spending (Trump has touted a USD 2trln figure previously, while Democrats have expressed some interest in recent weeks); and additionally, support for US energy companies, which are facing stress as oil prices slide.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p><strong>ITALY: </strong>Ahead of Italy’s rating agency update tonight from S&amp;P; the Bank of Italy has reportedly been purchasing Italian government bonds on behalf of the ECB and the purchases have been slightly higher than the recent days average. Italian yields had seen a turn lower recently, which is likely explained by these latest increased bank purchases. HSBC notes that Italian government debt is currently rated two notches above junk, but the sovereign has a negative outlook at Moody’s, and any downgrade on Friday would put it just a notch above junk. Meanwhile, Moody’s already rates Italy a notch above junk. Earlier in the week, the ECB took steps to mitigate the effects of potential sovereign downgrades, where the Central Bank will now allow for some junk debt to be accepted as collateral, where those who met the minim credit quality requirements on April 7th, will still be eligible in the event of a rating downgrade, as long as it remains or at above credit quality step 5, or BB.</p><h2><strong>EM</strong></h2><p><strong>BRAZIL:</strong> Ahead of tonight’s press conference with President Bolsonaro, Justice Minister Moro submitted his resignation after Bolsonaro attempted to impose a Federal Policy change. Sources yesterday noted the Minister attempted to resign then, although it was apparently rejected. However, Moro today noted that after the Federal Police Chief was fired, it was a clear sign that the President wanted him gone too, shortly followed with his official resignation. The BRL hit fresh record lows against the buck today as it is a further sign of political turmoil amid COVID-19 after the health minister was sacked recently amid differences with the President. Note, the BCB entered the market with multiple spot USD auctions today to help the BRL recover from record lows.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>CBR: </strong>Russia’s central bank cuts its key policy rate by 50bps to 5.50%, in line with the consensus. Its statement released alongside the rate decision flagged up the potential for further easing ahead. The bank also sees GDP contracting by between 4-6% in 2020, though sees a recovery in 2021. Some desks think that there could be further downside to this view given that fiscal support is likely to be limited; this may bolster the case for the CBR to take further action ahead.&nbsp; “The central bank has acted cautiously over the past month amid the collapse in oil prices and slump in the RUB but the statement suggested that policymakers are becoming increasingly concerned about the hit to the economy from the efforts to contain the virus,” Capital Economics said, “this, combined with the disinflationary effect of weaker economic activity and the recent stabilisation in financial markets, supported the CBR’s decision to cut interest rates.”&nbsp; In her press conference, CBR Governor Nabiullina reiterated the themes of the statement, stating that the central bank would try and keep the neutral rate between 5-6%, but emphasied that there is scope for a further lowering of the policy rate, possibly by another 100bps, while also reiterating that the central bank might take additional steps to support the economy.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>T-NOTES (M0) SETTLED 3 TICKS HIGHER AT 139-03+.</strong></p><p>Choppy day for the Treasury complex, albeit in tight ranges with the 10-year yield bouncing between 58/62bps, before moving lower on the updated Fed purchases schedule. As risk appetite rose in the European session, T-Notes and Bunds were offered from their highs overnight. However, after the US cash equity open gains were pared in equities/oil and yields were anchored from rising any further; note that relatively less corporate issuance likely also supported the Treasury curve. Then later, yields broke out of their range to the downside as investors digested the less pronounced cut in Fed asset purchases of USD 10bln/day from 35bln/day (read below). By settlement, 2s unchanged at 0.22, 10s -2bps at 0.59, and 30s -3bps at 1.17%. Meanwhile, Short end rates were supported after the 3-month USD LIBOR posted a chunky 10bps fall, supporting front pack Eurodollars and seeing swap spreads and FRA-OIS tighten.</p><p><strong>FED PURCHASES:</strong> The NY Fed has cut its Treasuries/TIPS purchases to USD 10bln per day for next week (prev. USD 15bln). In the wake of the announcement, the TPLEX has found strength, seeing the 10-year yield come from its recent highs of 61bps to dip below its recent range and sub-60bps. The strength is likely due to the fact that the magnitude of the cut is less pronounced, where the aggregate amount was cut by a third, while last week the total was cut in half, leading participants to begin assessing whether they have reached a near-term equilibrium. More broadly, the market is now examining how the Fed will convert its current, unprecedented scale of asset purchases into a more tranquil programme, to something that resembles prior QE programmes; this will be a key topic of discussion at next week’s FOMC meeting.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +1.4% at 2837, NDX +1.7% at 8788, DJI +1.1% at 23,775</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Information Technology +2.1%, Communications +1.9%, Materials +1.6%, Health Care +1.4%, Consumer Discretionary +1.4%, Financials +1.4%, Consumer Staples +1.1%, Industrials +0.8%, Utilities +0.6%, Real Estate +0.3%, Energy +0.2%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Alphabet Inc (GOOG) is reportedly planning to cut marketing budgets as much as 50%, according to CNBC citing an internal document. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) will be asked to provide clarity from the House Judiciary Committee to whether or not it misled Congress in a sworn testimony after a WSJ report highlighted the co’s use of third-party data to develop products. Gilead Sciences (GILD) report yesterday that its first trial in China “flopped” is “not correct”, according to a doctor who helped with the study, who added his interpretation does not match with the headline. Note, a research note from Citi notes the report will likely curb the enthusiasm, but the analyst believes the success of the drug is at 50:50. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. (LLY) announced it expects to start human testing for its experimental COVID-19 treatment as soon as next month that uses antibodies from those who have recovered from the disease, according to WSJ. Boeing Company (BA) is reportedly going to cut production of its 787 Dreamliner by roughly half and is set to announce job cuts in its Q1 earnings next week, according to people familiar with the matter. Elsewhere, WSJ reports that the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to delay the return of its 737 MAX jet until at least late summer or early fall. Initial goal was for mid-year. AT&amp;T (T) CEO is to step down on July 1st, where John Stankey will replace him. Boeing (BA) and Embraer (ERJ) deal reportedly hit a snag over the implementation, with both seeking a breakthrough ahead of tonight’s deadline. Facebook (FB) is to roll out a free calling service for up to 50 people, weighing on Zoom Video (ZM).</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Intel (INTC) beat on EPS and revenue, while announced it maintained its dividend, Q2 guidance fell short of expectations and it saw strong DCG and CCG revenues. INTC trade lower however amid a worry that the strong figures will not last as it has seen a boost in business from COVID-19. Verizon (VZ) beat on EPS although missed on revenue while cut its FY20 EPS view and withdrew its revenue forecast. American Express (AXP) beat on EPS, missed on revenue. Its loan loss provisions increased to 2.6bln (exp. 1.3bln), while it committed to no layoffs amid COVID-19 throughout FY20. Capital One Financial (COF) saw a loss per share while revenue was in line with expectations. Its provision for credit losses increased to USD 5.4bln, almost a 200% increase.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>UNI OF MICHIGAN (APR): </strong>Headline sentiment picked up from the prelim survey reading to 71.8 from 71.0, beating expectations for a decline to 68. The increase is welcomed, and a positive sign for consumer confidence, although it is worth noting the level is still at levels not seen since 2011.Oxford Economics highlights that the m/m drop is the largest on record, while also noting the deterioration&nbsp; in consumer attitudes will produce a record fall in Q2 consumer spending. However, given the small change from the preliminary report it suggests consumers remain the same/slightly better than the beginning of the month. Looking ahead, OxEco highlights the reopening of economies and easing of lockdowns will be the driver for sentiment. Elsewhere In the report, Expectations remained relatively unchanged at 70.1, while conditions rose to 74.3 from 72.4 in the preliminary report. Inflation expectations remain unchanged at 2.1% for the 1-year metric, and 2.5% for the 4-year.</p><p><strong>DURABLE GOODS:</strong> Headline durable goods fell 14.4% in March, deeper than the -11.9% consensus view. It was the second biggest monthly fall and can be attributed to the collapse in transportation orders. Oxford Economics says that this might suggest that the worst of the coronavirus crisis has yet to fully materialise, since global and domestic demand has virtually dried up. One surprising element in the release was core capital goods orders, which rose +0.1% in the month; OxEco does not think it can be sustained, however, while core shipments fell by 0.2%. Oxford Economics says that, ahead of next week's advance Q1 GDP data (street looks for -4.1%), \"these data affirm our view that business equipment spending will contract in Q1 before collapsing in Q2.\" And looking ahead, the consultancy thinks that COVID-19 will deal a severe blow to US businesses due to suppressed global and domestic demand, broken supply chains, depressed oil prices, tighter financial conditions and elevated uncertainty. \"This will translate into some of the largest pullbacks in capital spending of all time.\"</p><h2><strong>WEEKLY FOREX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> The DXY looks fairly comfortable on the 100.000 handle amidst relatively contained Dollar ranges vs G10 counterparts, but some distance from best levels forged earlier on Friday when the index got close to matching its 100.931 mtd peak, at 100.860. In fact, several Usd/major pairings have been quite restrained all week, and exemplified by the Yen rotating around 107.50 for the most part within 108.03-107.29 parameters as it battled the Buck for prime safe-haven status. From a fundamental perspective, the Greenback has managed to absorb a string of downbeat US data and survey news, like initial claims, Markit PMIs and durable goods with the aid of more Government fiscal stimulus and moves to lift lockdown in various states after President Trump’s decision to suspend WHO funding and high hopes for Gilead’s Remdesivir anti-coronavirus drug were dashed at the first randomised clinical trial hurdle.</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>Another gritty if not fully convincing comeback by the Euro following an abject German Ifo survey hot on the heels of flash PMIs that were anything but, and especially on the services side that dragged composite readings down dramatically. Eur/Usd is trying to retain 1.0800+ status from the low 1.0700 area, but remains off Thursday’s recovery high and could be susceptible to more downside press if S&amp;P delivers a downbeat review of Italy’s credit rating later. On that note, flagging BTPs appear to have been revived by above average BoI buying for the ECB and the latter has also prepared for potential sovereign downgrades via fallen angel collateral loosening to include junk bonds as lows as BB in exchange for funding. However, the single currency is still waiting for the EU to settle differences on a joint nCoV recovery fund after no resolution this week and the issue to be hotly debated again on May 6.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Despite top-tier UK data, bleak PMIs, equally stark appraisals of the outlook from several BoE members and the resumption of trade talks with the EU leaving no deal as a distinct possibility or risk, Pound moves have been rather removed or detached from economic and Brexit dynamics. Instead, Cable has been trading off Dollar and broad risk gyrations with a technical focus from 1.2513 and 1.2248, while Eur/Gbp has spent the bulk of its time pivoting the 200 DMA (0.8737) inside a wider 0.8864-0.8696 band.</p><p><strong>CHF:</strong> The Franc has been betwixt and between yet again, with net depreciation vs the Buck irrespective of swings in risk sentiment in contrast to appreciation against the Euro and the cross rooted near 1.0500 in wake of increasing Swiss sight deposits.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/NOK/RUB/MXN: </strong>A real white-knuckle ride for the commodity-based currencies and those contingent on oil in particular after tumultuous and historic moves in front month WTI before the May contract expiry. To cut a long story short, the global supply glut ahead of OPEC+ output cuts and storage facilities already brimming full left longs high and dry with no option other than bailing out, and prices plunged more than 300% to around minus Usd 40/brl at one point. However, following some spill-over to June and along the curve, calm has subsequently returned to a degree, providing the likes of the Loonie, Norwegian Krona, Russian Rouble and Mexican Peso with some respite. Indeed, the relief was evident for the Rub and Mxn via 50 bp CBR and Banxico easing both digested relatively well even though the latter was unexpected and inter-regular policy meeting. Similarly, dovish RBNZ guidance ahead of the official May confab only intermittently ruffled the Kiwi, while the Aussie derived traction from some encouraging data in the form of preliminary retail sales and trade (former boosted by COVID-19 stockpiling to new record levels and latter showing a significantly wider surplus as exports rebounded 3 times more than imports from prior month declines).</p><p><strong>SEK:</strong> The Swedish Crown has displayed resilience in the face or rising cases and fatalities amidst the ongoing global pandemic alongside data and sentiment indicators highlighting the fallout, and expectations that the Riksbank will remain resolute in terms of preserving ZIRP rather than resorting to NIRP again kept the Sek afloat even when the Bank rolled out enhanced QE to incorporate municipal bonds.</p><p><strong>EM:</strong> Aside from overall risk, global and sundry factors, the Lira had to contend with a full point CBRT rate cut vs -50 bp consensus, but coped well and only briefly slipped through 7.0000 with the assistance of further Turkish bank intervention and the Central Bank upping FX swap limits to 30% from 20% only a few hours before the aggressive ease. Conversely, the Rand was undermined by concerns over the SA Government’s ability to fund its 10%/GDP coronavirus economic plan and whether plans to re-open the country may be premature, while more political turmoil pushed the Real to deeper all time lows after Brazil’s Justice Minister resigned in protest against the President’s sacking of the Federal Police Chief.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Choppy day for the Treasury complex, albeit in tight ranges with the 10-year yield bouncing between 58/62bps, before moving lower on the updated Fed purchases schedule. As risk appetite rose in the European session, T-Notes and Bunds were offered from their highs overnight. However, after the US cash equity open gains were pared in equities/oil and yields were anchored from rising any further; note that relatively less corporate issuance likely also supported the Treasury curve. Then later, yields broke out of their range to the downside as investors digested the less pronounced cut in Fed asset purchases of USD 10bln/day from 35bln/day (read below). By settlement, 2s unchanged at 0.22, 10s -2bps at 0.59, and 30s -3bps at 1.17%. Meanwhile, Short end rates were supported after the 3-month USD LIBOR posted a chunky 10bps fall, supporting front pack Eurodollars and seeing swap spreads and FRA-OIS tighten. &nbsp;</p><p>FED PURCHASES: The NY Fed has cut its Treasuries/TIPS purchases to USD 10bln per day for next week (prev. USD 15bln). In the wake of the announcement, the TPLEX has found strength, seeing the 10-year yield come from its recent highs of 61bps to dip below its recent range and sub-60bps. The strength is likely due to the fact that the magnitude of the cut is less pronounced, where the aggregate amount was cut by a third, while last week the total was cut in half, leading participants to begin assessing whether they have reached a near-term equilibrium. More broadly, the market is now examining how the Fed will convert its current, unprecedented scale of asset purchases into a more tranquil programme, to something that resembles prior QE programmes; this will be a key topic of discussion at next week’s FOMC meeting. &nbsp;</p>",

Again, oil prices have been moving on their own accord, seemingly not nudging to incremental news flow. However, the Angolan Petroleum Minister said that OPEC++ production cuts are not sufficient to balance the oil market, and producers may be called to take further drastic measures. The comment on the market imbalance echoes a vast number of analysts, including IEA Chief Birol, who has stressed a number of times that the actions taken by OPEC++ are not enough to balance the demand drop. Meanwhile, US President Trump said he believes Saudi and Russia could make further production cuts and that it would be a natural process going ahead; Trump also quipped that Texas, Oklahoma and Canada are all cutting production. Note, the US Oil Fund (USO) saw another portfolio re-allcoation where it now may allocate 20% of its portfolio in June contracts (prev. 20%), 40% in July futures (Prev. 50%), 20% in August (Prev. 20%) and 20% in September (Prev. 10%). The latest Baker Hughes Rig Count data saw oil rigs -60 at 378, nat gas -4 at 85, total -64 at 465</p>",

The increase is welcomed, and a positive sign for consumer confidence, although it is worth noting the level is still at levels not seen since 2011.Oxford Economics highlights that the m/m drop is the largest on record, while also noting the deterioration &nbsp;in consumer attitudes will produce a record fall in Q2 consumer spending. However, given the small change from the preliminary report it suggests consumers remain the same/slightly better than the beginning of the month. Looking ahead, OxEco highlights the reopening of economies and easing of lockdowns will be the driver for sentiment. Elsewhere In the report, Expectations remained relatively unchanged at 70.1, while conditions rose to 74.3 from 72.4 in the preliminary report. Inflation expectations remain unchanged at 2.1% for the 1-year metric, and 2.5% for the 4-year.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY </strong>looks fairly comfortable on the 100.000 handle amidst relatively contained Dollar ranges vs G10 counterparts, but some distance from best levels forged earlier on Friday when the index got close to matching its 100.931 mtd peak, at 100.860. In fact, several Usd/major pairings have been quite restrained all week, and exemplified by the Yen rotating around 107.50 for the most part within 108.03-107.29 parameters as it battled the Buck for prime safe-haven status. From a fundamental perspective, the Greenback has managed to absorb a string of downbeat US data and survey news, like initial claims, Markit PMIs and durable goods with the aid of more Government fiscal stimulus and moves to lift lockdown in various states after President Trump’s decision to suspend WHO funding and high hopes for Gilead’s Remdesivir anti-coronavirus drug were dashed at the first randomised clinical trial hurdle.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>Another gritty if not fully convincing comeback by the Euro following an abject German Ifo survey hot on the heels of flash PMIs that were anything but, and especially on the services side that dragged composite readings down dramatically. Eur/Usd is trying to retain 1.0800+ status from the low 1.0700 area, but remains off Thursday’s recovery high and could be susceptible to more downside press if S&amp;P delivers a downbeat review of Italy’s credit rating later. On that note, flagging BTPs appear to have been revived by above average BoI buying for the ECB and the latter has also prepared for potential sovereign downgrades via fallen angel collateral loosening to include junk bonds as lows as BB in exchange for funding. However, the single currency is still waiting for the EU to settle differences on a joint nCoV recovery fund after no resolution this week and the issue to be hotly debated again on May 6.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Despite top-tier UK data, bleak PMIs, equally stark appraisals of the outlook from several BoE members and the resumption of trade talks with the EU leaving no deal as a distinct possibility or risk, Pound moves have been rather removed or detached from economic and Brexit dynamics. Instead, Cable has been trading off Dollar and broad risk gyrations with a technical focus from 1.2513 and 1.2248, while Eur/Gbp has spent the bulk of its time pivoting the 200 DMA (0.8737) inside a wider 0.8864-0.8696 band.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>The Franc has been betwixt and between yet again, with net depreciation vs the Buck irrespective of swings in risk sentiment in contrast to appreciation against the Euro and the cross rooted near 1.0500 in wake of increasing Swiss sight deposits.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/NOK/RUB/MXN</strong></p><p>A real white-knuckle ride for the commodity-based currencies and those contingent on oil in particular after tumultuous and historic moves in front month WTI before the May contract expiry. To cut a long story short, the global supply glut ahead of OPEC+ output cuts and storage facilities already brimming full left longs high and dry with no option other than bailing out, and prices plunged more than 300% to around minus Usd 40/brl at one point. However, following some spill-over to June and along the curve, calm has subsequently returned to a degree, providing the likes of the Loonie, Norwegian Krona, Russian Rouble and Mexican Peso with some respite. Indeed, the relief was evident for the Rub and Mxn via 50 bp CBR and Banxico easing both digested relatively well even though the latter was unexpected and inter-regular policy meeting. Similarly, dovish RBNZ guidance ahead of the official May confab only intermittently ruffled the Kiwi, while the Aussie derived traction from some encouraging data in the form of preliminary retail sales and trade (former boosted by COVID-19 stockpiling to new record levels and latter showing a significantly wider surplus as exports rebounded 3 times more than imports from prior month declines).</p><p><strong>SEK</strong></p><p>The Swedish Crown has displayed resilience in the face or rising cases and fatalities amidst the ongoing global pandemic alongside data and sentiment indicators highlighting the fallout, and expectations that the Riksbank will remain resolute in terms of preserving ZIRP rather than resorting to NIRP again kept the Sek afloat even when the Bank rolled out enhanced QE to incorporate municipal bonds.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Aside from overall risk, global and sundry factors, the Lira had to contend with a full point CBRT rate cut vs -50 bp consensus, but coped well and only briefly slipped through 7.0000 with the assistance of further Turkish bank intervention and the Central Bank upping FX swap limits to 30% from 20% only a few hours before the aggressive ease. Conversely, the Rand was undermined by concerns over the SA Government’s ability to fund its 10%/GDP coronavirus economic plan and whether plans to re-open the country may be premature, while more political turmoil pushed the Real to deeper all time lows after Brazil’s Justice Minister resigned in protest against the President’s sacking of the Federal Police Chief.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>MACRO: </strong>A transatlantic divergence is being seen across equity futures this morning; US futures have pared overnight weakness while European futures remain in the red; the latest passing of the stimulus bill could be providing some support, although it was largely expected. Value names are leading the bid, with NQ the relative underperformer (INTC and GOOG adding downside). Yields are little changed on the Treasury curve (10s -bps at 60bps), although a 10bps fall in 3-month USD LIBOR today is supporting white pack Eurodollars. The dollar and gold are roughly flat.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>The Energy sector continues to outperform amid the rise in oil prices, with Materials performing well yet gain after Freeport McMoran (FCX) posted earnings.&nbsp;On the downside, Utilities and Communication Services underperform with the latter weighed on by Google (GOOG) after reports it is to cut marketing budgets by 50%. Utilities likely being weighed on by First Energy (FE) after earnings.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Alphabet Inc (GOOG) is reportedly planning to cut marketing budgets as much as 50%, an internal document shows. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) will be asked to provide clarity from the House Judiciary Committee as to whether or not it misled Congress in a sworn testimony after a report highlighting the co’s use of third-party data to develop products. Gilead Sciences (GILD) reports yesterday that its first Remdesivir trial in China “flopped” was “not correct”, according to a doctor who helped with the study, adding that his interpretation does not match with the headline. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. (LLY) announced it expects to start human testing for its experimental COVID-19 treatment as soon as next month that uses antibodies from those who have recovered from the disease. Boeing Company (BA) is reportedly going to cut 787 production by roughly half and is set to announce job cuts in its Q1 earnings next week, according to people familiar with the matter. Elsewhere, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to delay the return of its 737 MAX jet until at least late summer or early fall; the initial goal was for mid-year.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Intel (INTC) beat on EPS and revenue, and announced it was maintaining its dividend; Q2 guidance fell short of expectations, which was attributed for the downside in afterhours trade, though it saw strong DCG and CCG revenues. Verizon (VZ) beat on EPS although missed on revenue while cut its FY20 EPS view and withdrew its revenue forecast. American Express (AXP) beat on EPS, missed on revenue; loan loss provisions increased to USD 2.6bln (exp. 1.3bln), while it committed to no layoffs amid COVID-19 throughout FY20. Capital One Financial (COF) saw a loss per share while revenue was in line with expectations. Its provision for credit losses increased to USD 5.4bln, almost a 200% increase.</p><p><strong>SENSITIVITY TO TREATMENT: </strong>The ES seems to have recovered from its overnight lows of 2755 to around the 2800 figure, which had acted as support after yesterday’s “remdesivir flop” and Eurogroup failure – the latter likely leading to underperformance in Europe today. Yesterday’s sell-off, as well as last Friday’s gain (after the positive Chicago Remdisivir results), are both indicative of the market’s sensitivity to major updates regarding treatment of the virus, something which will shape the ability of the global economy to normalise. Whereas markets have been happy to look past recent dismal data amid the retracement, they are evidently jittery to indications of lack of treatment, or a medium/long term solution to COVID-19.</p><p><strong>BANK OF AMERICA FLOWSHOW: </strong>Equity funds saw USD 7.3bln of outflows in the week through April 22nd; US USD 1.7bln outflows, EU USD 0.7bln outflows, EM USD 7.4bln outflows. Bond funds saw USD 10.7bln of inflows: IG USD 5.9bln inflows, HY USD 4.3bln inflows, govt/Treasury inflows of USD 2bln. BofA highlight a new bearish consensus, but notes that fewer are looking for a retest of the lows, adding the new consensus is to: A) “buy what the Fed buy”, B) Deflationary trading range in stocks, C) To own quality/growth such as tech and health care. D) Avoid government “ghettos” (EU, EM, Energy and financials).&nbsp;</p>",

(-1.0%)</strong> conformed to the regional glum amid weak financial earnings from the likes of China Life Insurance and Ping An Insurance, while the PBoC’s CNY 56.1bln 1-Year Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility and respective 20bps rate cut failed to spur upside given that the injection was less than the CNY 267.4bln maturing and with the rate cut inline with the recent similar reductions in the 1-year MLF and PBoC Loan Prime Rate. The biggest losses in the region were seen in the <strong>Philippines PSEi (-2.2%)</strong> after President Duterte extended the lockdown for the national capital region to May 15th and warned the country was running out of funds which the Finance Secretary suggested was not the case, while India’s <strong>NIFTY Index (-1.2%)</strong> also slumped with financials pressured following the decision by Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund to wind up six of its credit funds in India. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the downbeat overnight risk tone and following recent source reports that suggested the BoJ could consider unlimited bond buying at next week’s policy meeting. Furthermore, the BoJ were present in the market today for a total of JPY 180bln of JGBs concentrated in the long to super-long end, while the Chinese 10yr yield also dropped to its lowest in 10yrs as markets had widely anticipated the PBoC’s TMLF actions.</p><p>PBoC conducted CNY 56.1bln through 1-Year Targeted MLF at rate of 2.95% vs. Prev. 3.15%.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>The downbeat APAC sentiment intensified as European players entered the fray (Euro Stoxx 50 -0.8%), </strong>with the failure of EU leaders to agree on a recovery package coupled with the Gilead Remdesivir pessimistic reports prompting an unwinding of recent gains. That being said, US equity futures outperform Europe after the latest coronavirus bill made smooth passage through the House. European bourses see broad-based losses, but have clambered off lows, albeit Spain’s IBEX (-1.3%) sees more pronounced downside after the country’s hopes for a grant and a joint EU debt issuance were dashed out the window at yesterday’s EU Summit. Sectors are in the red with the exception of Consumer Staples (amid Nestle earnings) and feature Energy as the laggard given the pullback in the complex. The breakdown also paints a downbeat picture as Oil &amp; Gas, Banks, Autos, and Travel &amp; Leisure all post losses of over 2%. Nestle’s (+3.0%) numbers see shares on a firmer footing after organic revenue topped estimates, FY20 was maintained and the Co. is exploring options for its Yinlu Peanut Milk and Canned Rice Porridge businesses in China, including a potential sale. The group expects continued improvement in organic sales growth and underlying trading operating profit margin and sees underlying EPS to increase in constant currency. As Nestle carries a 16.3% weighing in the SMI (+0.3%), the Swiss index fares better than its regional peers. Other movers are largely earnings-oriented: Air Liquide (+0.4%), Casino (-0.4%), Saint Gobain (-3.6%) and Sanofi (-0.6%); the latter conforming to the broad losses across health names induced by Gilead (-0.8% pre-mkt), despite a boost to earnings from COVID-19 stockpiling and an increase in Business EPS. Although Italy’s DiaSorin (+2.5%) bucks the trend on the back of its competitor’s failure in the COVID-19 antibody market. Signify (+14.3%) leads the gains the Stoxx 600 after announcing a strong cash position against the backdrop of the pandemic.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR/GBP - </strong>The single currency has pared some losses vs the Dollar after falling to fresh mtd lows and through a key Fib retracement level (1.0757), but remains weak overall following no breakthrough on an EU-wide fiscal recovery fund and yet more evidence of the fallout from COVID-19 via the keenly watched Ifo survey, as all metrics missed consensus and the institute described the mood of German businesses as ‘catastrophic’. Moreover, firms are said to be more pessimistic about the outlook for coming months than ever, while Germany’s IAB Labour Market Research group believes that unemployment could rise in excess of 3 mln this year. However, Eur/Usd is clinging to 1.0760, while Eur/Gbp holds above 0.8700 amidst a pull-back in the Pound from Thursday’s recovery peaks in wake of weak UK retail sales data and a broadly firmer Greenback, in part on the demise of others. Indeed, Cable has tested 1.2300 as the DXY rebounds from post-US jobless claims and Markit PMI lows to notch a new recent high at 100.860, closer to April’s best so far (100.931 on April 6).</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD/JPY - </strong>All softer vs the Buck, but off worst levels as aversion and disappointment over the failure of Gilead’s Remdesivir coronavirus treatment at clinical trial abates. The Loonie is holding the bulk of it’s crude induced momentum on the 1.4000 handle alongside oil, while the Aussie is pivoting 0.6350 after failing to sustain 0.6400+ status yesterday and Kiwi is hovering close to 0.6000. Elsewhere, the Yen has returned to tight confines between 107.75-55 following knee-jerk depreciation on no holds barred BoJ QE with little independent impetus from in line Japanese inflation data overnight.</p><p><strong>SCANDI - </strong>Somewhat mixed fortunes for the Crowns, as Eur/Sek maintains a downward bias close to 10.8500 ahead of the Riksbank policy meeting on the grounds that the repo rate looks set rigid regardless of more adverse nCoV contagion highlighted by the Swedish Finance Ministry downgrading its already recessionary assessment of Q2 GDP. Conversely, Eur/Nok is back up near 11.5000 as Stats Norway slashed its 2020 growth forecast with the entire economy already in contraction over Q1.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Aside from the ongoing vigil for the Rouble in terms of tracking Brent, the looming CBR rate verdict will be in focus along with the post-meeting press conference amidst expectations that the benchmark will be lowered to 5.5% from 6%. Usd/Rub roughly flat in the run up circa 74.6750.</p><p>Mexico Central Bank Governor said will hold usual meeting on May 14th despite this week's off-schedule cut and central bank will continue to evaluate as well as take actions it deems necessary, while he added the challenge is overcoming the short-term crisis and it will be important to provide liquidity and financing to those that need it as economy gradually returns to normal. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>It’s far too early to presume and the broad risk-off theme remains the same, but a rebound in EU stocks and Eurozone periphery bonds has sapped strength from the core, with <strong>Bunds</strong> off best levels, <strong>Gilts </strong>almost erasing all their gains and 10 year T-notes flat. No obvious or new catalysts behind the partial change in sentiment, so pre-US open and weekend positioning is probably at play awaiting US data and final Michigan sentiment before late ratings reviews for Italy and the UK from S&amp;P that could have repercussions for both sovereigns in the current debt and financially sensitive environment.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>front month futures have yielded their gains seen in the APAC session, with both benchmarks extending losses as the final session of the week goes underway, but the complex has seen a recent pickup in-line with a improving overall risk tone. WTI posted +40% gains over the last two days as geopolitical risk premium pricing was induced by a ramp-up in US-Iranian tensions, while some argue prices were squeezed higher amid liquidation-only restrictions by some brokers. Again, there is little by way of any fresh fundamental developments to support a sustained move higher, but a relief rally may have been due given the recent detrimental losses across the complex. In terms of OPEC, despite reports of Algeria and Kuwait following the lead from Saudi to cut output early, desks believe this will do very little in the short term to offset the surplus in the market. ING analysts believe that “there is more downside risk to prices in the short term.” WTI futures rose to a whisker away from USD 18.00/bbl before receding to a current intraday low at USD 15.64/bbl, whilst its Brent counterpart printed an intraday roof at USD 22.70/bbl and base at USD 20.50/bbl thus far. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> retraces some of its recent gains, but prices remain comfortably above USD 1700/oz at the time writing. The yellow metal is pressured by the rising Buck and sits within a USD 1721-31 intraday band, with much of the session spent at the lower end of this. <strong>Copper</strong> prices see similar price action amid the overall risk aversion across the market, alongside Dollar woes. The red metal threatens a break below USD 2.3/lb vs. yesterday’s 2.3505/lb high.</p><p>CME raised crude oil NYMEX margins by 17.6% to USD 10000/contract from USD 8500/contract, raised NY Harbor heating oil margins by 15.9% to USD 6200/contract from USD 5350/contract, raised RBOB gasoline futures margins by 11.1% to USD 9000/contract from USD 8100/contract and raised London spot silver margins by 9.4% to USD 8750/contract from USD 8000/contract. (Newswires)</p><p>Russia has cut Urals oil exports from sea ports by 43% for May vs. April, ahead of the OPEC+ schedule; Baltic ports -38%, Novorossiisk -55%, according to a schedule.

European bourses see broad-based losses, but have clambered off lows, albeit Spain’s IBEX (-1.3%) sees more pronounced downside after the country’s hopes for a grant and a joint EU debt issuance were dashed out the window at yesterday’s EU Summit. Sectors are in the red with the exception of Consumer Staples (amid Nestle earnings) and feature Energy as the laggard given the pullback in the complex. The breakdown also paints a downbeat picture as Oil &amp; Gas, Banks, Autos, and Travel &amp; Leisure all post losses of over 2%. Nestle’s (+3.0%) numbers see shares on a firmer footing after organic revenue topped estimates, FY20 was maintained and the Co. is exploring options for its Yinlu Peanut Milk and Canned Rice Porridge businesses in China, including a potential sale. The group expects continued improvement in organic sales growth and underlying trading operating profit margin and sees underlying EPS to increase in constant currency. As Nestle carries a 16.3% weighing in the SMI (+0.3%), the Swiss index fares better than its regional peers. Other movers are largely earnings-oriented: Air Liquide (+0.4%), Casino (-0.4%), Saint Gobain (-3.6%) and Sanofi (-0.6%); the latter conforming to the broad losses across health names induced by Gilead (-0.8% pre-mkt), despite a boost to earnings from COVID-19 stockpiling and an increase in Business EPS. Although Italy’s DiaSorin (+2.5%) bucks the trend on the back of its competitor’s failure in the COVID-19 antibody market. Signify (+14.3%) leads the gains the Stoxx 600 after announcing a strong cash position against the backdrop of the pandemic.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>EUR/GBP - The single currency has pared some losses vs the Dollar after falling to fresh mtd lows and through a key Fib retracement level (1.0757), but remains weak overall following no breakthrough on an EU-wide fiscal recovery fund and yet more evidence of the fallout from COVID-19 via the keenly watched Ifo survey, as all metrics missed consensus and the institute described the mood of German businesses as ‘catastrophic’. Moreover, firms are said to be more pessimistic about the outlook for coming months than ever, while Germany’s IAB Labour Market Research group believes that unemployment could rise in excess of 3 mln this year. However, Eur/Usd is clinging to 1.0760, while Eur/Gbp holds above 0.8700 amidst a pull-back in the Pound from Thursday’s recovery peaks in wake of weak UK retail sales data and a broadly firmer Greenback, in part on the demise of others. Indeed, Cable has tested 1.2300 as the DXY rebounds from post-US jobless claims and Markit PMI lows to notch a new recent high at 100.860, closer to April’s best so far (100.931 on April 6).</p><p>CAD/AUD/NZD/JPY - All softer vs the Buck, but off worst levels as aversion and disappointment over the failure of Gilead’s Remdesivir coronavirus treatment at clinical trial abates. The Loonie is holding the bulk of it’s crude induced momentum on the 1.4000 handle alongside oil, while the Aussie is pivoting 0.6350 after failing to sustain 0.6400+ status yesterday and Kiwi is hovering close to 0.6000. Elsewhere, the Yen has returned to tight confines between 107.75-55 following knee-jerk depreciation on no holds barred BoJ QE with little independent impetus from in line Japanese inflation data overnight.</p><p>SCANDI - Somewhat mixed fortunes for the Crowns, as Eur/Sek maintains a downward bias close to 10.8500 ahead of the Riksbank policy meeting on the grounds that the repo rate looks set rigid regardless of more adverse nCoV contagion highlighted by the Swedish Finance Ministry downgrading its already recessionary assessment of Q2 GDP. Conversely, Eur/Nok is back up near 11.5000 as Stats Norway slashed its 2020 growth forecast with the entire economy already in contraction over Q1.</p><p>EM - The Rouble currency sees solace from an unsurprising 50bps rate cut by the CBR, and despite dovish rhetoric the statement, Usd/Rub moved in tandem with the recovery in energy markets post-decision. The pair dips below 74.5000 vs. ~74.6750 in the run-up to the decision – with eyes now turning to the post-meeting press conference at 1300BST.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It’s far too early to presume and the broad risk-off theme remains the same, but a rebound in EU stocks and Eurozone periphery bonds has sapped strength from the core, with <strong>Bunds</strong> off best levels, <strong>Gilts</strong> almost erasing all their gains and 10 year <strong>T-notes</strong> flat. No obvious or new catalysts behind the partial change in sentiment, so pre-US open and weekend positioning is probably at play awaiting US data and final Michigan sentiment before late ratings reviews for Italy and the UK from S&amp;P that could have repercussions for both sovereigns in the current debt and financially sensitive environment..</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front month futures have yielded their gains seen in the APAC session, with both benchmarks extending losses as the final session of the week goes underway, but the complex has seen a recent pickup in-line with a improving overall risk tone. <strong>WTI</strong> posted +40% gains over the last two days as geopolitical risk premium pricing was induced by a ramp-up in US-Iranian tensions, while some argue prices were squeezed higher amid liquidation-only restrictions by some brokers. Again, there is little by way of any fresh fundamental developments to support a sustained move higher, but a relief rally may have been due given the recent detrimental losses across the complex. In terms of OPEC, despite reports of Algeria and Kuwait following the lead from Saudi to cut output early, desks believe this will do very little in the short term to offset the surplus in the market. ING analysts believe that “there is more downside risk to prices in the short term.” <strong>WTI</strong> futures rose to a whisker away from USD 18.00/bbl before receding to a current intraday low at USD 15.64/bbl, whilst its <strong>Brent</strong> counterpart printed an intraday roof at USD 22.70/bbl and base at USD 20.50/bbl thus far. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> retraces some of its recent gains, but prices remain comfortably above USD 1700/oz at the time writing. The yellow metal is pressured by the rising Buck and sits within a USD 1721-31 intraday band, with much of the session spent at the lower end of this. <strong>Copper</strong> prices see similar price action amid the overall risk aversion across the market, alongside Dollar woes. The red metal threatens a break below USD 2.3/lb vs. yesterday’s 2.3505/lb high.</p>",

However, after a brief set-back to 137.22 fresh highs for the month were posted at 137.45 alongside Bunds that extended their rally to 172.87 amidst stops and a weak start to the last session of the week for cash equities before some consolidation across the board. On that note, 3 month contracts remain relatively lacklustre, albeit following a firm rebound yesterday, with the STIR strip narrowly mixed and fractionally flatter for choice post-weak on balance retail sales data.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets traded mostly negative following the lacklustre handover from US where the major indices retraced their initial oil-inspired gains</strong> as sentiment soured following weak data and with anti-viral hopes dashed by disappointing results for Gilead's Remdesivir drug in a clinical trial. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.5%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-0.9%)</strong> were mixed with energy front-running the gains in Australia after similar outperformance of the sector stateside due to the continued rebound in oil and as state governments are set to begin releasing a list of projects next week to spur the rebound in the domestic economy, while sentiment in Tokyo was subdued as exporters suffered from recent adverse currency flows and ongoing COVID-19 disruptions. <strong>Hang Seng (-0.4%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%)</strong> conformed to the regional glum amid weak financial earnings from the likes of China Life Insurance and Ping An Insurance, while the PBoC’s CNY 56.1bln 1-Year Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility and respective 20bps rate cut failed to spur upside given that the injection was less than the CNY 267.4bln maturing and with the rate cut inline with the recent similar reductions in the 1-year MLF and PBoC Loan Prime Rate. The biggest losses in the region were seen in the <strong>Philippines PSEi (-2.2%)</strong> after President Duterte extended the lockdown for the national capital region to May 15th and warned the country was running out of funds which the Finance Secretary suggested was not the case, while India’s <strong>NIFTY Index (-1.2%)</strong> also slumped with financials pressured following the decision by Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund to wind up six of its credit funds in India. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the downbeat overnight risk tone and following recent source reports that suggested the BoJ could consider unlimited bond buying at next week’s policy meeting. Furthermore, the BoJ were present in the market today for a total of JPY 180bln of JGBs concentrated in the long to super-long end, while the Chinese 10yr yield also dropped to its lowest in 10yrs as markets had widely anticipated the PBoC’s TMLF actions.</p><p>PBoC conducted CNY 56.1bln through 1-Year Targeted MLF at rate of 2.95% vs. Prev. 3.15%.

Furthermore, she added <strong>the Commission will explore innovative financial instruments in the next budget and that the recovery investment will be front-loaded</strong>, while the recovery fund is to mobilise EUR 1trln worth of recovery investment.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were mixed overnight in which oil prices continued the rebound from the historic declines earlier in the week on bargain buying and as the geopolitical risk narrative remains intact following sabre-rattling between US and Iran with the IRGC Chief warning Tehran will give a crushing response to any US threat within the Gulf and that US warships will be destroyed if they threaten Iranian ships. As such, WTI crude futures extended on gains overnight but with upside eventually capped by resistance just shy of the USD 18.00/bbl level and amid the risk-averse tone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Elsewhere, gold prices were subdued owing to a firmer USD although the precious metal remained north of the USD 1700/oz, while copper languished due to the soured overnight sentiment.</p><p>CME raised crude oil NYMEX margins by 17.6% to USD 10000/contract from USD 8500/contract, raised NY Harbor heating oil margins by 15.9% to USD 6200/contract from USD 5350/contract, raised RBOB gasoline futures margins by 11.1% to USD 9000/contract from USD 8100/contract and raised London spot silver margins by 9.4% to USD 8750/contract from USD 8000/contract.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>T-Notes were firmer amid a paring of risk appetite after reports of poor results from a trial for Gilead’s COVID treatment Remdesivir. Treasuries, from the long-end, had already caught a bid heading into the US cash equity open after reports that the BoJ is to announce limitless asset purchases had accentuated the support for sovereigns on both sides of the Atlantic. As the Fed wrapped up its UST purchases for the day, yields began to rise higher in lieu of firmer equities and oil, as well as a corporate supply dump and 5-year TIPS auction. However, the negative Remdesivir update brought yields down to lows later in the session, as well as the lack of progress out of Europe in financing their virus response. Note that throughout the session, from the 5-year sector and inwards, yields saw little changes, with primarily the long-end gyrating; by settlement, 2s +1bps at 0.22%, 5s unchanged at 0.37%, 10s -1.5bps at 0.60%, 30s -3bps at 1.19%. Meanwhile, in short rates, another several bps decline in 3-month USD LIBOR supported white pack Eurodollar futures again, with the FRA-OIS spread declining further. T-notes (M0) settled 1 tick lower at 139-00+.</p><p>Fed announced temporary easing of rules around bank access to intraday Fed credit in which it is suspending uncollateralised intraday credit limits and overdraft fees for primary credit banks. Fed also streamlined the process for seeking collateralized credit for secondary credit institutions and noted that the moves should encourage regular use of intraday credit by healthy institutions and not meaningfully increase credit risk to reserve banks. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed said it is working to widen access to paycheck protection program liquidity facility to include non-depository institutions such as community development financial institutions and will announce changes shortly on widened access to PPP facility. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed said it will release \"substantial amounts\" of information on a monthly basis about participants in its crisis facilities such as names of borrowers and amounts, while it will publish all of its programme information at least every 30 days without redactions. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said they are mulling a lending facility for struggling oil firms</strong> and that investment grade drillers should look to the Fed, while it was also reported that Mnuchin will require companies critical to national security to offer equity to the government if they seek some of the USD 17bln of virus relief. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>White House Economic Adviser Kudlow said it is critical that aid be put to work ASAP and that China will be held accountable for coronavirus at some point</strong>, while he reiterated that May will be a transition month in the fight against the virus. Furthermore, Kudlow said he expects a big rebound for the US economy if it reopens during next few weeks and that he supports the need for an infrastructure bill. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mostly negative following the lacklustre handover from US where the major indices retraced their initial oil-inspired gains as sentiment soured following weak data and with anti-viral hopes dashed by poor results of Gilead's Remdesivir drug in a clinical trial. ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) were mixed with energy front-running the gains in Australia after similar outperformance of the sector stateside due to the continued rebound in oil and as state governments are set to begin releasing a list of projects next week to spur the rebound in the domestic economy, while sentiment in Tokyo was subdued as exporters suffered from recent adverse currency flows and ongoing COVID-19 disruptions. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) conformed to the regional glum amid weak financial earnings from the likes of China Life Insurance and Ping An Insurance, while the PBoC’s CNY 56.1bln 1-Year Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility and respective 20bps rate cut failed to spur upside given that the injection was less than the CNY 267.4bln maturing and with the rate cut inline with the recent similar reductions in the 1-year MLF and PBoC Loan Prime Rate. The biggest losses in the region were seen in the Philippines PSEi (-2.2%) after President Duterte extended the lockdown for the national capital region to May 15th and warned the country was running out of funds which the Finance Secretary suggested was not the case, while India’s NIFTY Index (-1.2%) also slumped with financials pressured following the decision by Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund to wind up six of its credit funds in India. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the downbeat overnight risk tone and following recent source reports that suggested the BoJ could consider unlimited bond buying at next week’s policy meeting. Furthermore, the BoJ were present in the market today for a total of JPY 180bln of JGBs concentrated in the long to super-long end, while the Chinese 10yr yield also dropped to its lowest in 10yrs as markets had widely anticipated the PBoC’s TMLF actions.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade subdued following the lacklustre handover from US where the major indices retraced their initial oil-inspired gains as sentiment soured following weak data and with anti-viral hopes dashed by poor results of Gilead's Remdesivir drug in a clinical trial. ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) are mixed with energy front-running the gains in Australia after similar outperformance of the sector stateside due to the continued rebound in oil prices and as state governments are set to begin releasing a list of projects next week to spur the rebound in the domestic economy, while sentiment in Tokyo is subdued as exporters suffer from recent adverse currency flows and ongoing COVID-19 disruptions. Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) conform to the regional glum amid weak financial earnings from the likes of China Life Insurance and Ping An Insurance, while the PBoC’s CNY 56.1bln 1-Year Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility and respective 20bps rate cut failed to spur upside given that the injection was less than the CNY 267.4bln maturing and with the rate cut inline with the recent similar reductions in the 1-year MLF and PBoC Loan Prime Rate.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is firmer overnight and back above the 100.50 level as the soured risk tone helped the safe haven claw back the lost ground from the aftermath of weak PMI data and a larger than expected surge in unemployment benefit claimants which suggested more than 26mln jobs have been lost so far from coronavirus pandemic. EUR/USD languishes at the prior day’s lows beneath the 108.00 handle after discussions between the bloc’s leaders ended without an agreement on the recovery package, while GBP/USD is stuck around 1.2350 and clustered around numerous MA levels ranging from the 5-hour to 100-hour moving averages. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY/JPY crosses consolidate amid the subdued risk appetite and commodity linked currencies AUD, NZD and CAD also retraced some of their oil-fuelled gains.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid the soured overnight tone and following recent source reports that suggested the BoJ could consider unlimited bond buying at next week’s policy meeting. Furthermore, the BoJ are present in the market today for a total of JPY 180bln of JGBs concentrated in the long to super-long end, while the Chinese 10yr yield also dropped to its lowest in 10yrs as markets had widely anticipated the PBoC TMLF actions.</p>",
