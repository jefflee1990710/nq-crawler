The rise in crude prices was welcomed, although desks seem to suggest that Wednesday’s buying seems to be more a function of bargain hunting rather than any change to the overarching narrative. US Senators passing the so-called Stimulus Bill v3.5 was also said to have helped, with talk of a further stimulus bill to come (although the GOP does not seem to be fully behind it); attention will be on any infrastructure spending packages, after US President Trump recently floated a USD 2trln infrastructure ‘plan’. Apple Inc. (AAPL) will likely delay the release of its iPhone SE Plus to H2 21 from H1 21, according to 9to5Mac citing a report from TF Securities.

Sycamore Partners are looking to terminate its deal with L Brand (LB) on Victoria’s Secret. SPX +2.3% at 2799, NDX +3.1% at 8665, DJIA +2% at 23,476.</p><p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened amid the bounceback in risk appetite, lead by crude oil futures. After the 10-year yield fell below 0.55% on Tuesday, it today grinded back above 0.60%; at settlement, short end yields were relatively unchanged (2s around 0.21%), while long-end yields were up around 6bps (30s +6bps around 1.22%). The more constructive risk appetite coincided with raised dollar issuance, including several foreign issuers – such as the BoE (USD 2bln) and Mexico (USD 3bln) – which supported the swap spread compression seen on the session with a handful expected to swap. Meanwhile, other rates spreads compressed, too. The supportive risk tone saw credit default spread indices continue to move lower. At the same time, nearby Eurodollar contracts caught a bid as USD LIBOR posted further declines (the rest of the packs sold off in a steepener, similar to USTs), supporting a narrowing of FRA/LIBOR-OIS spreads; USD 3-month LIBOR-OIS sits around 90bps, down from its March peak of just beneath 140bps. T-notes (M0) settled 11 ticks lower at 139-01+.</p>",

The rise in crude prices was welcomed, although desks seem to suggest that Wednesday’s buying seems to be more a function of bargain hunting rather than any change to the overarching narrative. US Senators passing the so-called Stimulus Bill v3.5 was also said to have helped, with talk of a further stimulus bill to come (although the GOP does not seem to be fully behind it); attention will be on any infrastructure spending packages, after US President Trump recently floated a USD 2trln infrastructure ‘plan’. Equities are green, with all eleven sectors positive; strategy-wise, growth and momentum baskets have performed well, along with quality names. In credit, HYG outperformed investment grade; the Treasury curve bear-steepened with yields 1-6bps higher across the curve; gold ­– which some desks have said is back to trading as a function of real rates – higher; the DXY is slightly better than neutral, though its performance isn’t too much to sing home about. One interesting area is EMFX, which did start the US day mostly positive, but has succumbed to the buck strength over the course of the session.</p><h2><strong>VIRUS CASE COUNT</strong></h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Wednesday (via state official health departments) against Tuesday:</strong></i></p><ul><li><strong>US</strong>: Cases +3.4% at 802,583 (prev. +4% at 776,093); death toll +6.7% at 44,575 (prev. +6.8% 41,758)</li><li><strong>NEW YORK</strong>: Cases +2.4% at 257,216 (Prev.+1.7% at 251,690); death toll +474 (Prev. +3.4% (+481) to 14,828)</li><li><strong>ITALY: </strong>Cases +1.83% at 187,327 (prev. +1.5% at 183,957); death toll +1.76% 25,083 (prev. +2.2% at 24,648)</li><li><strong>UK: </strong>Cases rise to 133,495 (prev. 129,044), death toll rises to 18,100 (prev. 17,337); deaths rise by 759 (+4.4%) vs. yesterday's increase of 823 (+5.02%)</li><li><strong>CANADA: </strong>Cases rise to 38,932 (prev. 37,382), death toll rises to 1,871 (prev. 1,728)<strong>.</strong></li></ul><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI and Brent </strong>June<strong> </strong>futures both bounced firmly off their lows from Tuesday - albeit only a partial retrace - and brought wider cross-asset risk appetite along with them, as the energy complex battles extreme volatility. The fundamental backdrop remains little changed, and how much information one can gauge out of today’s rally remains for debate. Citi’s analysts believe the bid is most likely “traders grabbing a perceived bargain, rather than any expectation that the surplus is disappearing or that the problem of finding a place to physically store the excess has been solved.” The energy complex also found some support after the EIA released inventories that were, relatively, more bullish than expectations: crude +15mln (exp. 15.2mln), Cushing +4.8mln, gasoline +1mln (exp. +3.6mln), distillates +7.9mln (exp. +2.8mln). While better than expected, the results are still chunky and reside in the upper quartiles of W/W changes, reflective of the supply drought and storage issues. Production fell slightly to 12.2mln BPD (-100k BPD), although that figure will likely need to come down markedly to provide some balance to the market. Meanwhile, the closely followed USO ETF reported it would carry out an 8-to-1 reverse stock split amid the price declines; additionally, it would be increasing its portfolio allocation further out the futures curve, to now include September expiry too.</p><p><strong>OPEC:&nbsp;</strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak said global demand for crude has fallen by 20-30mln BPD and we are currently are at the bottom of the global oil demand decline. Novak says oil output cuts may total between 15-20mln BPD in May, which will help the situation. The Iranian Oil Minister said 100% compliance is seen from the start of May. Meanwhile, Nigeria will reportedly cut its output amid a lack of storage. IEA’s Birol has urged OPEC+ to cut output as soon as possible and recommended the group considers further cuts. Journalist Reza Zandi, citing a source, said that the decision to hold an extraordinary OPEC+ meeting had not been finalised yet; no date has been set yet, including the suggested date of May 10th; added that, logically, “another OPEC meeting might be organised at a date that could lead to a solution.”</p><p><strong>WHITE HOUSE:&nbsp;</strong>Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the administration is looking at different plans to support US oil prices – expressing that he believes oil will reach USD 30/bbl by August. The announcement follows from Trump’s tweet yesterday, where he indicated government support would be ensuing for the US Oil &amp; Gas sector.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>STIMULUS:</strong> As expected, the Senate unanimously passed the stimulus bill (version 3.5), a USD 500bln stimulus package, much of which will help prevent small businesses from closing and shedding jobs; the House will likely follow suit on Thursday, House Speaker Pelosi said so much today. From an economic perspective, keeping the jobless rate as low as possible will help to ensure that the eventual recovery is quicker; from a fiscal perspective, the implication is that the budget deficit will likely top 20% this year; and from the market’s perspective, there will be attention on how quickly these funds can get into the economy (UBS says that if the small business schemes are ‘running out of money’ it is a good sign those funds are filtering through). Democrats have framed v. 3.5 as an “interim measure” and have called on Congress to prepare another bill of similar size and ambition to the CARES Act. However, Republicans have endorsed a more cautious approach due to the amount of debt that the US is accumulating, which some Republicans have said is a major concern – as virus attention recedes, Republicans are likely to take a more hawkish tone on deficit spending. Looking ahead, the next point of focus is on infrastructure stimulus, which has already been talked up by US President Trump. Trump is open to a package including fiscal relief for states and local governments, and given that the Democrats wanted this relief in the current Bill, it seems it will be a bargaining chip for Trump in negotiations around infrastructure spending. Previously, Trump has touted a USD 2trln figure for infrastructure.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>ECB: </strong>The ECB held a call today to discuss whether or not junk debt should be able to be used as collateral. The call occurred amid concerns some of the worst-hit victims from COVID-19 could see a debt rating downgrade to junk, therefore their debt would not be able to be purchased by the ECB to support them. The decision allows for some junk debt to be accepted, where those who met the minim credit quality requirements on April 7th, will still be eligible in the event of a rating downgrade, as long as it remains or at above credit quality step 5, or BB. The move comes ahead of Friday’s sovereign rating on Italy by S&amp;P, who currently have Italy two notches above IG with a negative outlook. Moody’s already rates Italy a notch above junk.&nbsp; The ECB already accepts Greek debt as part of its easing programme, which is already rated junk. Currently, the rules state that Italy would have to be downgraded at each S&amp;P, Moody’s, Fitch and DBRS for its debt to be excluded.</p><p><strong>CBRT: </strong>The Turkish Central Bank opted to cut its Weekly Repo Rate by 100bps to 8.75% – at the top of analysts’ forecasts – taking real rates deeper into negative territory. Notably, the central bank assessed that risks to its year-end inflation forecasts are to the downside, adding that economic activity had started to weaken in mid-March due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. On the Lira, the CBRT reiterated the impact of a soft currency’s effect on inflation is being offset by weaker oil prices, net/net a favourable impact. The Bank reaffirmed its “cautious monetary stance” and said it will be determined considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend, but emphasised that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. Desks note of three reasons which could’ve led to a deeper cut: 1) Looser global policies, 2) additional support to mitigate tail risks to growth, and 3) negative output gap affecting inflation. Analysts at ING said that the CBRT “does not signal that this is the final move of the cutting cycle”, but others argue that a sizeable rate hike may be on the agenda in the near future amid the CBRT’s dwindling reserves situation.</p><h2><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></h2><p><strong>IRAN:</strong> US President Trump announced he has directed the US Navy to “shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,” adding to the tensions between the two nations. US Secretary of State also noted that Iran needs to be held accountable for its militarily organization (IRGC) and for looking to launch a satellite. Elsewhere, in North Korea, a senior pentagon official noted he had no reason to believe Kim Jong Un was not still at the helm.</p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>The EU27 are poised to sign off on the plans concocted by EZ finance ministers on Thursday, and brainstorm on a long-term recovery plan. Leaders have signalled a general will for a larger coordinated fiscal response, albeit views seem to differ.

After the 10-year yield fell below 0.55% on Tuesday, it today grinded back above 0.60%; at settlement, short end yields were relatively unchanged (2s around 0.21%), while long-end yields were up around 6bps (30s +6bps around 1.22%). The more constructive risk appetite coincided with raised dollar issuance, including several foreign issuers – such as the BoE (USD 2bln) and Mexico (USD 3bln) – which supported the swap spread compression seen on the session with a handful expected to swap. Meanwhile, other rates spreads compressed, too. The supportive risk tone saw credit default spread indices continue to move lower. At the same time, nearby Eurodollar contracts caught a bid as USD LIBOR posted further declines (the rest of the packs sold off in a steepener, similar to USTs), supporting a narrowing of FRA/LIBOR-OIS spreads; USD 3-month LIBOR-OIS sits around 90bps, down from its March peak of just beneath 140bps.</p><p><strong>BANK ISSUANCE:</strong> BofA launched a USD 3bln 11-year NC10, similar to JPM last week, although they are the only two large US banks to issue debt post-earnings reports, a period that usually sees more activity. Note that banks have been making large credit provisions, as documented in Q1 reports, where the lack of debt raising being carried out is likely indicative of the group being well capitalised (for now), with the credit provisions being supportive enough to allow them to be patient until credit spreads narrow further to their pre-March blowup levels.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +2.3% at 2799, NDX +3.1% at 8665, DJIA +2% at 23,476.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> IT +3.9%, Energy +3.6%, Communications +3.3%, Utilities +2.95%, Materials +2.1%, Consumer Discretionary +2%, Real Estate +1.9%, Health Care +1.6%, Industrials +1.15%, Financials +1.1%, Consumer Staples +1.1%</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple Inc. (AAPL) will likely delay the release of its iPhone SE Plus to H2 21 from H1 21, according to 9to5Mac citing a report from TF Securities. Expedia Group (EXPE) is reportedly in advanced talks to sell a stake to Apollo (APO) and Silver Lake, according to WSJ sources, which note the deal is likely to total USD 1bln.&nbsp; Activision Blizzard (ATVI) March videogame sales hit its highest level in 10 years amid lockdowns in place. Boeing Company (BA) announced it is making key changes to help create a greater cross-company integration. It has formed a new group, Enterprise Operation, which consolidates key operations. Sycamore Partners are looking to terminate its deal with L Brand (LB) on Victoria’s Secret.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Netflix (NFLX) earnings were mixed, with EPS a miss and revenue a slight beat. Its global net additions however were solid rising to 15.77mln from 9.6mln, while it expects Q2 additions to be at 7.5mln, firmer than the expected 4.15mln. Q2 EPS and Revenue guidance came in beneath analyst expectations. Its regional breakdown was also solid, beating expectations in each region. Texas Instruments (TXN) beat on EPS and revenue, while guidance saw a wide margin. Delta Airlines (DAL) reported beat on loss per share, while revenue fell short; DAL also expects to finish June burning USD 50mln a day, down from USD 100mln a day currently. AT&amp;T (T) EPS and revenue missed, although it maintained its dividend commitment. Postpaid phone net additions at 163k. Chipotle (CMG) beat on top and bottom line, March comp. sales -16%. Biogen (BIIB) beat on top and bottom line and sees the completion of US filing in Q3 on its Alzheimer’s drug Aducanumab. Snap (SNAP) missed on EPS, beat on revenue, while DAU’s rose 20% to 229mln.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>CANADA CPI (MAR): </strong>Inflation slowed Y/Y to 0.9% from 2.2%, deeper than the expected 1.2%, while M/M saw CPI decline 0.6%, deeper than the expected fall of 0.4%. An average of the three BoC core measures ticked lower to 1.83% in March from 1.97%, moving further away from the BoC’s 2% target. Core CPI, however, maintained a 0.1% pace M/M, while Y/Y slowed to 1.6% from 1.8%. Reductions in prices in COVID-19 hit sectos included airlines, rental vehicles, and accommodation. Energy prices obviously weighed also. RBC notes that inflation is likely to slow significantly over the coming months, which could be a positive for consumers, but it depends upon the availability of these goods given social distancing measures in place. Although, the desk notes purchasing power in households will likely rise once these measures are eased.</p><p><strong>EZ CONSUMER CONFIDENCE (APR.):</strong> Consumer Confidence fell to -22.7, a fresh record decline deeper than the expected fall of -19.6. The data excludes Italy, the worst hit country in the Eurozone, therefore the actual level of consumer confidence might actually be even worse than the data implies. Capital Economics highlights that consumption fell more sharply than implied by the data and also highlight that the data simply assumes that Italy fell in line with other EU nations. On consumption, CapEco suspects spending has fallen by 20-30% since the middle of March, noting spending in travel, restaurants, and hospitality has almost completely stopped, while the Bank of France announced bank card payments halved in late March. The consultancy now forecasts a 3.5% GDP contraction in Q1, and a 20% contraction in Q2 in the eurozone.</p><p><strong>INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS PRIMER: This</strong> week’s initial jobless claims will coincide with the survey period for the BLS’ Employment Situation Report. Claims printed 5.245mln in the week ending April 11th; analysts had expected 5.105mln, from a revised 6.61mln. Oxford Economics said the data now appears to have reached a “vertiginous plateau.” Oxford Economics says that while it now appears that we have passed the peak in layoffs, “jobless claims are poised to remain extraordinarily high in coming weeks as the economy plunges deeper into a recession”. Since the latest report, the PPP funds had been depleted and congress have only just come to an agreement on the funding, with the house set to vote on the bill tomorrow (likely to pass). However, given this week there was no funding for the programme, desks have noted there could perhaps be some upside risk to the figure. Oxford Economics now anticipates the official nonfarm payrolls data for April will show a loss of 24 million jobs and the unemployment rate spiking to 14%, while the participation rate will fall beneath 60%. “While some jobs will be recouped as activity rebounds, we don’t expect the economy to reach the February 2020 level of employment until early 2022.”</p><h2><strong>FOREX</strong></h2><p><strong>USD / EUR: </strong>The dollar firmed today continuing gains despite risk sentiment improving (desks have noted the inverse relationship of late). The gains likely stem from a weaker euro ahead of the ECB’s call on whether junk-rated debt will be able to be used as collateral, Thursday’s crunch European Summit, and Friday’s rating review of Italy. Focussing on Thursday’s meeting, Italian PM Conte has warmed to ESM credit lines while a coronabond plan is still premature; if Italy fails to win concessions, it could be particularly negative for the government, with Citi’s analysts suggesting that government stability might be at risl.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> USDJPY traded within a tight 40pip range today and currently is flat against the greenback. In the months ahead, UBS expect USDJPY to head towards 100-102 levels given improved dollar liquidity across the globe. However, the desk highlights that although USD liquidity appears to have improved, FRA-OIS spread indicates we are still not yet back at “normal” levels. The return to normality depends on when lockdown restrictions are eased to see the return of corporate cash flows. A break of 100 to the downside is being blocked by subdued global growth, and thus UBS believe this could keep USDJPY between a 100-105 level in H2 20 and early 2021.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX:</strong> The Loonie and Ruble seemed to benefit the most from today’s bounce of lows in the crude complex although NOK and MXN failed to reap the same rewards. ING is sceptical on CAD, given 10% of its GDP relies on the energy sector and worries it may be hit with a lag while it notes its stimulus plan will hardly avoid a sharp downturn. The desk holds USDCAD target at 1.45 in the upcoming weeks.<strong> </strong>The MXN<strong> </strong>continues to underperform after the Banxico’s emergency 50bp rate cut on Tuesday, which has likely offset any potential benefit from the oil move today. The Norwegian Krone also failed to benefit from the reversal in oil prices; TD securities highlights that EURNOK momentum stalled despite a break of 11.50/55 resistance, and states that FX purchases from Norges bank remain supportive, but spec positioning remains light and therefore hold a bias to purchase dips in EURNOK, although TD are cautious of a bounce in risk.</p><p><strong>Cyclicals: (AUD/NZD/GBP):</strong> With an improvement in risk appetite AUD has appreciated against the buck (which is slightly firmer, still). The cross reclaimed 0.63 to the upside to highs of 0.6350 before consolidating. Retail sales were solid overnight reflecting the increase in stockpiling amid COVID-19. Although retail sales were decent, HSBC notes price action in Aussie today has been dictated by the combination of rising equities and short positioning.</p><p><strong>GBP: </strong>Some note that the pound has traded as an oil proxy in recent sessions, although not today and cable is back above 1.2350; recently desks have had a 1.2350-12650 playbook with a bias of selling rallies. SocGen suggests that Thursday's PMI data could find buyers of EURGBP on any relative disappointment in UK PMIs vs EZ counterparts, and there is a fair chance of this occurring since the UK went on lockdown after Germany, France and Italy.</p><p><strong>NZD: </strong>A different story for the Kiwi than Aussie and Sterling, NZD trades lower against the buck despite the risk-friendly sentiment on Wednesday. Perhaps a follow on from prior day losses spurred by further dovish commentary from the RBNZ which perhaps hints further easing is coming.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> Overall EMFX was weaker against the buck, apart from the RUB which appreciated with the price of oil. TRY relatively unchanged against the buck despite a deeper than expected rate cut from the CBRT which took its repo rate to 8.75% from 9.75%, which was at the top of the expected range, median was looking for a 50bp cut. ZAR traded marginally weaker amid CPI data which cooled to 0.3% from 1.0% M/M, while the Y/Y print slowed to 4.1% from 4.6%.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>USD / EUR: </strong>The dollar firmed today continuing gains despite risk sentiment improving (desks have noted the inverse relationship of late). The gains likely stem from a weaker euro ahead of the ECB’s call on whether junk rated debt will be able to be used as collateral, Thursday’s crunch European Summit, and Friday’s rating review of Italy. Focussing on Thursday’s meeting, Italian PM Conte has warmed to ESM credit lines while a coronabond plan is still premature; if Italy fails to win concessions, it could be particularly negative for the government, with Citi’s analysts suggesting that government stability might be at risl.</li><li><strong>JPY:</strong> USDJPY traded within a tight 40pip range today and currently is flat against the greenback. In the months ahead, UBS expect USDJPY to head towards 100-102 levels given improved dollar liquidity across the globe. However, the desk highlights that although USD liquidity appears to have improved, FRA-OIS spread indicates we are still not yet back at “normal” levels. The return to normality depends on when lockdown restrictions are eased to see the return of corporate cash flows. A break of 100 to the downside is being blocked by subdued global growth, and thus UBS believe this could keep USDJPY between a 100-105 level in H2 20 and early 2021.</li><li><strong>COMMODITY FX:</strong> The Loonie and Ruble seemed to benefit the most from today’s bounce of lows in the crude complex although NOK and MXN failed to reap the same rewards. ING is sceptical on CAD, given 10% of its GDP relies on the energy sector and worries it may be hit with a lag while it notes its stimulus plan will hardly avoid a sharp downturn. The desk holds USDCAD target at 1.45 in the upcoming weeks.<strong> </strong>The MXN<strong> </strong>continues to underperform after the Banxico’s emergency 50bp rate cut on Tuesday, which has likely offset any potential benefit from the oil move today. The Norwegian Krone also failed to benefit from the reversal in oil prices; TD securities highlights that EURNOK momentum stalled despite a break of 11.50/55 resistance, and states that FX purchases from Norges bank remain supportive, but spec positioning remains light and therefore hold a bias to purchase dips in EURNOK, although TD are cautious of a bounce in risk.</li><li><strong>Cyclicals: (AUD/NZD/GBP):</strong> With an improvement in risk appetite AUD has appreciated against the buck (which is slightly firmer, still). The cross reclaimed 0.63 to the upside to highs of 0.6350 before consolidating. Retail sales were solid overnight reflecting the increase in stock piling amid COVID-19. Although retail sales were decent, HSBC notes price action in Aussie today has been dictated by the combination of rising equities and short positioning.</li><li><strong>GBP: </strong>Some note that the pound has traded as an oil proxy in recent sessions, although not today, and cable is back above 1.2350; recently desks have had a 1.2350-12650 playbook with a bias of selling rallies. SocGen suggests that Thursday's PMI data could find buyers of EURGBP on any relative disappointment in UK PMIs vs EZ counterparts, and there is a fair chance of this occurring since the UK went on lockdown after Germany, France and Italy.</li><li><strong>NZD: </strong>A different story for the Kiwi than Aussie and Sterling, NZD trades lower against the buck despite the risk friendly sentiment on Wednesday. Perhaps a follow on from prior day losses spurred by further dovish commentary from the RBNZ which perhaps hints further easing is coming.</li><li><strong>EMFX:</strong> Overall EMFX was weaker against the buck, apart from the RUB which appreciated with the price of oil. TRY relatively unchanged against the buck despite a deeper than expected rate cut from the CBRT which took its repo rate to 8.75% from 9.75%, which was at the top of the expected range, median was looking for a 50bp cut. ZAR traded marginally weaker amid CPI data which cooled to 0.3% from 1.0% M/M, while the Y/Y print slowed to 4.1% from 4.6%.</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>The Treasury curve bear-steepened amid the bounce back in risk appetite, lead by crude oil futures. After the 10-year yield fell below 0.55% on Tuesday, it today grinded back above 0.60%; at settlement, short end yields were relatively unchanged (2s around 0.21%), while long-end yields were up around 6bps (30s +6bps around 1.22%). The more constructive risk appetite coincided with raised dollar issuance, including several foreign issuers – such as the BoE (USD 2bln) and Mexico (USD 3bln) – which supported the swap spread compression seen on the session with a handful expected to swap. Meanwhile, other rates spreads compressed, too. The supportive risk tone saw credit default spread indices continue to move lower. At the same time, nearby Eurodollar contracts caught a bid as USD LIBOR posted further declines (the rest of the packs sold off in a steepener, similar to USTs), supporting a narrowing of FRA/LIBOR-OIS spreads; USD 3-month LIBOR-OIS sits around 90bps, down from its March peak of just beneath 140bps.</li><li><strong>BANK ISSUANCE:</strong> BofA launched a USD 3bln 11-year NC10, similar to JPM last week, although they are the only two large US banks to issue debt post-earnings reports, a period that usually sees more activity. Note that banks have been making large credit provisions, as documented in Q1 reports, where the lack of debt raising being carried out is likely indicative of the group being well capitalised (for now), with the credit provisions being supportive enough to allow them to be patient until credit spreads narrow further to their pre-March blowup levels.</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>WTI and Brent&nbsp;</strong>Junefutures both bounced firmly off their lows from Tuesday - albeit only a partial retrace - and brought wider cross-asset risk appetite along with them. The fundamental backdrop remains little changed, and how much information one can gauge out of today’s rally is debatable. Citi’s analysts believe the bid is most likely “traders grabbing a perceived bargain, rather than any expectation that the surplus is disappearing or that the problem of finding a place to physically store the excess has been solved.” The energy complex also found some support after the EIA released inventories that were, relatively, more bullish than expectations: crude +15mln (exp. 15.2mln), Cushing +4.8mln, gasoline +1mln (exp. +3.6mln), distillates +7.9mln (exp. +2.8mln). While better than expected, the results are still chunky and reside in the upper quartiles of W/W changes, reflective of the supply drought and storage issues. Production fell slightly to 12.2mln BPD (-100k BPD), although that figure will likely need to come down markedly to provide some balance to the market. Meanwhile, the closely followed USO ETF reported it would carry out an 8-to-1 reverse stock split amid the price declines; additionally, it would be increasing its portfolio allocation further out the futures curve, to now include September expiry too.</li><li><strong>OPEC:&nbsp;</strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak said global demand for crude has fallen by 20-30mln BPD and we are currently are at the bottom of the global oil demand decline. Novak says oil output cuts may total between 15-20mln BPD in May, which will help the situation. The Iranian Oil Minister said 100% compliance is seen from the start of May. Meanwhile, Nigeria will reportedly cut its output amid a lack of storage. IEA’s Birol has urged OPEC+ to cut output as soon as possible and recommended the group consider further cuts. Journalist Reza Zandi, citing a source, said that the decision to hold an extraordinary OPEC+ meeting had not been finalised yet; no date has been set yet, including the suggested date of May 10th; added that, logically, “another OPEC meeting might be organised at a date that could lead to a solution.”</li><li><strong>WHITE HOUSE:&nbsp;</strong>Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the administration is looking at different plans to support US oil prices – expressing that he believes oil will reach USD 30/bbl by August. The announcement follows from Trump’s tweet yesterday, where he indicated government support would be ensuing for the US Oil &amp; Gas sector.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/CAD/GBP/NZD/RUB/ZAR</strong></p><p>A considerably better day for most currencies inextricably linked to the fortunes of oil and other commodities, with the Aussie also belatedly boosted by a record rise in retail sales even though stocking up for COVID-19 inflated the unprecedented level of consumer demand. Aud/Usd rebounded to around 0.6350 on a mixture of short covering and stops, but the pair has pared back since towards the 0.6300 handle in advance of April PMIs. Meanwhile, the Loonie hardly flinched in the face of weaker than forecast Canadian CPI data as crude prices rebounded further from extreme lows on a combination of consolidation and supportive verbal intervention from Russia and the US, with Usd/Cad more than 100 pips down from highs over 1.4230 at one stage. Elsewhere, the Pound staged an impressive comeback from Tuesday’s lows, but topped out ahead of 1.2400 vs its US counterpart amidst few if any fresh UK specific drivers as was the case when Sterling suffered heavy losses in preceding sessions. Back down under, the Kiwi latched on to its Antipodean peer’s coattails and popped above 0.6000 before losing momentum and altitude with Nzd/Usd now sub-0.5950 and Aud/Nzd testing 1.0600. In the EM space, respite for the Rouble as Brent reclaims Usd 20/brl-plus status vs a fraction below Usd 16 at worst, as Usd/Rub hovers close to the bottom end of 77.6750-75.8200 parameters, while the Rand has bounced from 19.0600 or so on a broader recovery in risk sentiment that has become increasingly correlated with the mood in oil markets rather than remaining weak on the back of softer than expected SA inflation metrics. However, headline CPI is now beneath the midpoint of the SARB’s 3-6% target range and could presage more easing irrespective of the benchmark rate already residing at an all time low.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>All giving up ground to the Greenback in late trade as the <strong>DXY </strong>regains composure amidst bear re-steepening along the US Treasury curve and retrieves 100.000+ territory compared to 99.881 at the other end of the spectrum. Eur/Usd is losing sight of 1.0850 following a miss in Eurozone consumer confidence, Usd/Chf is looking firmer within a 0.9718-0.9669 band and Usd/Jpy is edging closer to 108.00 than 107.50.</p><p><strong>NOK/MXN/BRL/TRY</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Crown and Mexican Peso have lost impetus from the aforementioned crude revival, while the Brazilian Real is succumbing to catch-up selling following yesterday’s national holiday, but the Turkish Lira is just keeping its head above 7.0000 despite the CBRT slashing rates by 100 bp vs consensus for -1/2 point (though in range of estimates) and delivering a dovish assessment of the inflation outlook (risks skewed to the downside of year end projections) with the aid of local bank Usd/Try selling. Note also, ahead of the policy meeting FX swap limits were raised to 30% from 20% and this capped gains towards the touted line in the sand psychological level.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*OVERVIEW</strong>: The EU27 are poised to sign off on the plans concocted by EZ finance ministers, and brainstorm on a long-term recovery plan. Leaders have signalled a general will for a larger coordinated fiscal response, albeit views seem to differ. Officials noted that the North fears that their financial positions will be contaminated by debt mutualisation in the future due to decisions taken by the South. The European Council is expected to discuss the size of a European Recovery Fund alongside other financing tools. The virtual meeting will be chaired by EU Council President Michel, although the lack of detailed proposals could see another impasse or delay in talks.</p><p><strong>*EU RECOVERY FUND</strong>: The Council President said the Fund should be established as soon as possible to kick-start economy once lockdown measures are eased, but officials note of a large divide between member states on the size and whether it should consist of only grants or solely loans. Consensus on a Recovery Fund this week has been heavily downplayed, with officials pointing to more clarity in June or July. In terms of the nuances, Spain is to propose a EUR 1.5tln recovery fund backed by perpetual bonds to finance the recovery of the worst-hit countries in grants and not loans, to avoid rising debt. France has backed the principals in Spain’s proposal but noted a physical meeting will be needed for a formal decision, potentially before Summer – President Macron previously said there is no choice but to set up a joint EUR 400bln recovery fund. Sources said the European Commission is reportedly seeking EUR 320bln to finance the regional recovery.</p><p><strong>*EUROGROUP FALLOUT</strong>: At the Eurogroup meeting, Finance Ministers agreed on a EUR 540bln rescue package which consists of:</p><ul><li><strong>ESM CREDIT LINE (up to 2% of Euro Area GDP):</strong> This will be immediately available for member states with “light” conditionality. The size could be up to USD 240bln should all countries tap the maximum available. This also opens the door to Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) by the ECB, which allows the Central Bank to purchase unlimited debt from the worst-hit regions, albeit some analysts have suggested that the OMT programme has already been made redundant by the ECB's new PEPP.</li><li><strong>FIRMING EIB ACTIVITIES (up to 1.6% of Euro Area GDP):</strong> The European Investment Bank could support EUR 200bln of company financings, with emphasis on SMEs.</li><li><strong>SHORT-TIME WORK SCHEME (0.8% of Euro Area GDP):</strong> The EUR 100bln scheme was drafted to aid protect jobs and workers hit by the pandemic in the form of loans on “favourable” terms.</li></ul><p><strong>*CORONABOND</strong>: The common debt issuances pursued namely by Spain and Italy was not included in the Eurogroup’s draft document after experiencing pushback by several larger members, vehemently from Austria, Germany and Netherlands. However, Italy seems to be erring towards a compromise on the issue. Italian PM Conte, at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, signalled open-mindedness towards the ESM credit line and an alternative fund as a substitute to Eurobonds. Desks note that this should reduce tail risks for a roadblock.</p><p><strong>*ITALY’S DILEMMA: </strong>PM Conte set a high bar for success in negotiations for a post-virus response as domestic pressure builds at the epicentre of the European outbreak. Desks note that the PM will need a win to confine the rising Eurosceptics whilst fending off opposition parties waiting to muster support from any failures. Despite Conte’s more recent sanguine tone regarding a Coronabond compromise, participants believe the PM could be tempted to walk away from the table, having had battled for weeks on a Euro-wide debt instrument. Meanwhile, domestic pushback could arise from a compromise of just ESM lines – potentially paving a way for a change in government. It’s also worth noting that S&amp;P will be reviewing Italy’s sovereign debt on Friday; the agency will be eyeing the outcome of negotiations. Credit Suisse believes that the survival of the Euro could be at risk if EU leaders fail to understand the difficultly in Italy’s economical and political landscapes.</p>",

        "subject": "US EQUITY OPEN NOTE: Indices and sectors open in the green rebounding from prior day losses ",
        "content": "<p><strong>MACRO: </strong>Sentiment has improved somewhat with equities trading higher in Europe and gains following in the US. Oil prices – which have been dictating the action in recent sessions – have partially rebounded, with the crude complex off worst levels; upside was seen after US President Trump announced he directed the US Navy to “shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea”, adding to geopolitical tensions between the two sides. The US stimulus bill also passed last night, which may be contributing, although it was widely expected. Some desks believe it is just a technical bounce being seen this morning. Elsewhere, USD is slightly softer but DXY remains above 100, while yields are higher, albeit flat in the short end with the curve bear-steepening.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>All sectors trade are in positive territory, with Energy outperforming as oil rises off its recent lows. Cyclicals, Tech and Materials, also performing well expressing a risk friendly environment while defensives, Staples and Health Care and at the bottom of the pack, albeit still in positive territory.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple Inc. (AAPL) will likely delay the release of its iPhone SE Plus to H2 21 from H1 21, according to 9to5Mac citing a report from TF Securities. Expedia Group (EXPE) is reportedly in advanced talks to sell a stake to Apollo (APO) and Silver Lake, according to WSJ sources, which note the deal is likely to total USD 1bln.&nbsp; Activision Blizzard (ATVI) March videogame sales hit its highest level in 10 years amid lockdowns in place. Boeing Company (BA) announced it is making key changes to help create a greater cross-company integration. It has formed a new group, Enterprise Operation, which consolidates key operations.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Netflix (NFLX) earnings were mixed, with EPS a miss and revenue a slight beat. Its global net additions however were solid rising to 15.77mln from 9.6mln, while it expects Q2 additions to be at 7.5mln, firmer than the expected 4.15mln. Q2 EPS and Revenue guidance came in beneath analyst expectations. Its regional breakdown was also solid, beating expectations in each region. Texas Instruments (TXN) beat on EPS and revenue, while guidance saw a wide margin. Delta Airlines (DAL) reported beat on loss per share, while revenue fell short; DAL also expects to finish June burning USD 50mln a day, down from USD 100mln a day currently. AT&amp;T (T) EPS and revenue missed, although it maintained its dividend commitment. Postpaid phone net additions at 163k. Chipotle (CMG) beat on top and bottom line, March comp. sales -16%. Biogen (BIIB) beat on top and bottom line and sees the completion of US filing in Q3 on its Alzheimer’s drug Aducanumab. Snap (SNAP) missed on EPS, beat on revenue, while DAU’s rose 20% to 229mln.</p><p><strong>US STIMULUS V. 3.5:</strong> As expected, the Senate unanimously passed the so-called stimulus bill version 3.5, a USD 500bln stimulus package, much of which will help prevent small businesses from closing and shedding jobs; the House will likely follow suit on Thursday. From an economic perspective, keeping the jobless rate as low as possible will help to ensure that the eventual recovery is quicker; from a fiscal perspective, the implication is that the budget deficit will likely top 20% this year; and from the market's perspective, there will be attention on how quickly these funds can get into the economy (UBS says that if the small business schemes are 'running out of money' it is a good sign those funds are filtering through. Looking ahead, the next point of focus is on infrastructure stimulus, which has already been talked up by US President Trump. Trump is open to a package including fiscal relief for states and local governments, and given that the Democrats wanted this relief in the current Bill, it seems it will be a bargaining chip for Trump in negotiations around infrastructure spending. Previously, Trump has touted a USD 2trln figure for infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SHAKE-OUT:</strong> Nomura's quants explain Tuesday's downside in equities as an expected shake-out of long positions. The bank says it appears that CTAs have halted adding to longs in NASDAQ 100 futures, and Nomura says the focus is now whether NDX can remain above the 'trigger line' of 8,180. Technically, it thinks CTAs may look to add longs towards month-end, providing that trigger line is not breached, but if such an upside attempt were to fail to squeeze some investors out of shorts or convince others to stake out fresh longs, Nomura expects CTA buying pressure may fizzle out in May. \"This would imply a need to brace for selling in tune with the “sell in May” adage.\" Meanwhile, the funds that appear the least interested in buying have been fundamentally-focused. \"In particular, the global heavyweights among macro hedge funds are still bearish on equities, and we suspect that global macro hedge funds will remain bearish until there is some reason to believe that DM economies are on their way to finding a floor.\" If economic indicators bottom, the bank's quants think global macro hedge funds might have to make an emergency rush to exit shorts; \"however, our impression is that there is not much impetus among global macro hedge funds to rethink their current strategies just now.\"</p>",

However, Republicans have endorsed a more cautious approach due to the amount of debt that the US is accumulating, which some Republicans have said is a major concern.</li><li>Looking ahead, the next point of focus is on infrastructure stimulus, which has already been talked up by US President Trump. Trump is open to a package including fiscal relief for states and local governments, and given that the Democrats wanted this relief in the current Bill, it seems it will be a bargaining chip for Trump in negotiations around infrastructure spending. Previously, Trump has touted a USD 2trln figure for infrastructure.</li></ul>",

(+0.6%)</strong> conformed to the subdued global risk tone but with losses in the mainland limited by anticipation of further support after Chinese President Xi pledged stronger macro policy tools to soften the epidemic fallout and the State Council noted that China will boost targeted assistance to those in need, as well as small businesses.

Sectors see broad-based gains, albeit energy lags as the complex remains under pressure from storage scarcity. In term of the breakdown, Tech names lead the gains following earnings from STMicroelectronics (+6.2%), whilst the sector also sees tailwinds from Texas Instruments (+3.0% pre-mkt), with the former, despite misses on its metrics, noted that Q1 was exited with stable net financial position, over USD 2.5bln in liquidity and available credit facilities above USD 1bln. Looking at other movers, Roche (+1.7%) is supported post earnings in which it topped estimates and pharma sales rose 7% YY. The Co. also stated that Clinical Phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Actemra/Roactemra in severe COVID-19 pneumonia is ongoing in several countries, with results expected in early summer, adding there is capacity for a rapid increase of production. On the flip side, Credit Suisse (+0.4%) is hampered vs. the region after it stated it is to take an additional EUR 900mln loan loss provisions in Q1. Finally, other earnings-related movers include Akzo Nobel (+7.9%), Ericsson (+6.4%) and Kering (-5.42), the latter reported a decline in Gucci sales of 23.2% YY.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD -</strong> Another swing in broad risk sentiment amidst less pronounced pressure on oil and other commodities has aided the latest Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie recovery, but with the former also benefiting from a short squeeze in wake of a record rise in retail sales per preliminary data for March. Aud/Usd took some time to digest the release and acknowledge the fact that stock-piling for COVID-19 boosted consumption, but subsequently breached 0.6300 on the way to circa 0.6350 with stops tripped above 0.6325 and macro fund offers over 0.6340 absorbed along the way. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd retested 0.6000, albeit with a lag as Aud/Nzd rebounded from sub-1.0550 to around 1.0580, and Usd/Cad has retreated between 1.4237-1.4139 parameters on the aforementioned relative stability in crude prices ahead of Canadian CPI.</p><p><strong>GBP/SEK/NOK&nbsp; -</strong> Sterling has unwound some of its recent underperformance on technical rather than fundamental grounds given Cable remaining above the 30 DMA (1.2257) and revisiting 1.2300+ levels, while Eur/Gbp has reversed towards 0.8800 as the DXY meanders within a tight band on the 100.000 handle and single currency continues to straddle 1.0850. Similarly, the Scandis are seeing some reprieve from oil and pandemic risk aversion, with Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek both off highs near 11.5950 and 10.9700 respectively and the Swedish Krona weighing up more unconventional Riksbank easing in the form of municipal QE in the run up to next week’s official policy meeting.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF - </strong>All sticking to pretty narrow and well trodden recent confines vs the Dollar, as the Yen flits from 107.86 to 107.52, Euro hovers below 1.0900 and above 1.0800 amidst decent option expiry interest at the former (1.5 bn) and 1.0825 (1 bn), and Franc pivots 0.9700.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Softer than expected SA CPI has not hindered the Rand amidst the overall upturn in risk appetite, but the Lira is treading more cautiously into the CBRT even though the Central Bank has already lifted FX swap limit transactions to 30% from 20% in what may be an effort to keep Usd/Try under 7.0000 in the event that rates are cut again, as widely expected, but perhaps more than the -50 bp consensus. On that note, the Mexican Peso seems to have taken Banxico’s emergency ½ point ease in stride or at least lubricated by the less fractious state of trade in crude markets.</p><p>Australian Retail Sales (Mar P) 8.2% (Prev. 0.5%); largest increase on record. ABS said the March sales data indicated unprecedented demand for food retailing industry.

However, Spanish <strong>Bonos </strong>are now encountering the same kind of issuance pressure that Italian <strong>BTPs</strong> suffered yesterday ahead of the 2030 syndicated pricing and final terms even though investor demand has exceeded previous record levels.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent front month futures remain choppy, </strong>but ultimately mixed this morning, with WTI swinging between gains and losses whilst Brent remained in the red for the entirety of the session thus far. Yesterday, OPEC Delegates discussed the oil market crisis within a conference call; although the call was reportedly not designed to make a new oil decision and they were said to consider a May 10th meeting for further production cuts. Furthermore, Saudi, UAE, and Kuwait did not take part in the call and a delegate noted that OPEC+ members will be unable to start production cuts earlier because April's oil production is already committed for export contracts. Meanwhile, the Iraq Energy Minister said OPEC+ could take additional steps to absorb the oil surplus but added that taking further measures by producer countries depends on global market development and compliance by other OPEC+ and other non-member producers with the oil cut deal. Russia again downplayed the gravitas of the oil market situation. Elsewhere, the fallout from the Texas Railroad Commission meeting saw two out of three Texas Oil and Gas regulators stated they are not ready to vote on oil output cuts today and they are to revisit the issue on May 5th. Sticking with North America, sources stated that producers in Alberta, Canada have reportedly already voluntarily cut 400k-700k BPD, according to Energy Intel. The contracts saw further downside as EU trade got underway, with WTI June resided under USD 11/bbl whilst Brent held onto losses of over 10% and eyed USD 17/bbl to the downside; however, since then we have recovered somewhat in what has been choppy trade for the complex but, ultimately, are in proximity to the lows – particularly for WTI, which ekes mild gains at the time of writing. Looking at the metals market, <strong>spot gold</strong> benefits from the Dollar pullback and reclaimed its USD 1700/oz handle. While <strong>copper</strong> trades subdued around USD 2.25/bbl, with miner Antofagasta stating that Q1 copper production rose almost 5% YY.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks +13.2mln vs. Exp. +15.2mln (Prev. +13.1mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>CME will permit listing of negative oil options from today.

That being said, some desks see a sizeable rate hike on the agenda in the near future amid the CBRT’s dwindling reserves situation.</li><li>In the middle of March, the CBRT conducted an intra-meeting 100bps rate cut and undertook measures to ease liquidity conditions, including 1-year swap auctions – a move amounting to an effective rate cut between 200-250bps, analysts said; additional liquidity measures were also announced at the end of March to cushion the COVID-19 burden. The Bank today also raised the FX-Lira swap market transaction limit to 30% from 20%.</li><li>The central bank signalled tolerance of a weaker Lira, as USDTRY meanders close to 7.00, with inflationary repercussions countered by the slump in oil prices. Annual inflation ticked lower to 11.86% in March from 12.37% in February, albeit real rates remain negative. The central bank’s April survey saw its year-end CPI view lowered to 9.76% from 9.98%, with the USDTRY forecast upped to 6.9277 from 6.5117, while the Repo Rate view in 12-months was reduced to 8.66% from 9.14%.</li><li>Analysts at Credit Suisse believe further FX interventions and capital flow restrictions are needed to keep both real rates low and the TRY rate under control to alleviate strains on corporate and bank balance sheets should the pronounced currency weakness materialise.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>Another swing in broad risk sentiment amidst less pronounced pressure on oil and other commodities has aided the latest Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie recovery, but with the former also benefiting from a short squeeze in wake of a record rise in retail sales per preliminary data for March. Aud/Usd took some time to digest the release and acknowledge the fact that stock-piling for COVID-19 boosted consumption, but subsequently breached 0.6300 on the way to circa 0.6350 with stops tripped above 0.6325 and macro fund offers over 0.6340 absorbed along the way. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd retested 0.6000, albeit with a lag as Aud/Nzd rebounded from sub-1.0550 to around 1.0580, and Usd/Cad has retreated between 1.4237-1.4139 parameters on the aforementioned relative stability in crude prices ahead of Canadian CPI.</p><p><strong>GBP/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>Sterling has unwound some of its recent underperformance on technical rather than fundamental grounds given Cable remaining above the 30 DMA (1.2257) and revisiting 1.2300+ levels, while Eur/Gbp has reversed towards 0.8800 as the <strong>DXY</strong> meanders within a tight band on the 100.000 handle and single currency continues to straddle 1.0850. Similarly, the Scandis are seeing some reprieve from oil and pandemic risk aversion, with Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek both off highs near 11.5950 and 10.9700 respectively and the Swedish Krona weighing up more unconventional Riksbank easing in the form of municipal QE in the run up to next week’s official policy meeting.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>All sticking to pretty narrow and well trodden recent confines vs the Dollar, as the Yen flits from 107.86 to 107.52, Euro hovers below 1.0900 and above 1.0800 amidst decent option expiry interest at the former (1.5 bn) and 1.0825 (1 bn), and Franc pivots 0.9700.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Softer than expected SA CPI has not hindered the Rand amidst the overall upturn in risk appetite, but the Lira is treading more cautiously into the CBRT even though the Central Bank has already lifted FX swap limit transactions to 30% from 20% in what may be an effort to keep Usd/Try under 7.0000 in the event that rates are cut again, as widely expected, but perhaps more than the -50 bp consensus. On that note, the Mexican Peso seems to have taken Banxico’s emergency ½ point ease in stride or at least lubricated by the less fractious state of trade in crude markets.</p>",

Furthermore, Texas oil regulators failed to agree on a vote on production in which they postponed the issue to next month and the latest private inventory report failed to support prices given the elevated stockpiles despite printing a narrower than expected build. As such, WTI crude futures fluctuated between gains and losses during Asia trade and Brent crude underperformed as it slipped below the USD 17.00/bbl level to narrow the spread. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were rangebound amid an uneventful greenback and with prices contained below this week’s resistance at USD 1700/oz, while <strong>copper</strong> was also subdued by the lacklustre risk appetite.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks +13.2mln vs. Exp. +15.2mln (Prev. +13.1mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>CME will permit listing of negative oil options from today.

(Newswires/Argus)</p><p><strong>Iraq Energy Minister said OPEC+ could take additional steps to absorb the oil surplus </strong>but added that taking further measures by producer countries depends on global market development and compliance by other OPEC+ and other non-member producers with the oil cut deal.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX continued to flatten amid the wave of risk-off induced by falling oil prices. Similar to recent sessions, the bid in duration came in European trade, as the 10-year yield breached 0.60% to the downside, but lost pace as the US arrived, seeing the benchmark move in a channel of 0.54-0.58%. Meanwhile, the front/belly of the UST curve was more hesitant, although 5-year yields edged to new record lows at 0.301%. By settlement, 2s were unchanged at 0.20%, 5s -2bps at 0.34%, 10s -5bps at 0.58%, 30s -7bps at 1.17%. The falling oil prices set the negative risk tone today. Participants in the Fixed Income complex are also likely driving prices higher as they revaluate/downgrade their inflation expectations, as fears of oil price woes becoming more sustained grow louder. In rates, the nearby Eurodollar (M0) contract outperformed the rest of the pack, coinciding with an approximate 5bps fall in 3-month USD LIBOR, keeping T-Bill/Eurodollar spreads (TEDs) contained, as well as other spreads, such as FRA-OIS, which saw some pressure on Monday. T-notes (M0) settled 9 ticks higher at 139-12+.</p><p>US President Trump reiterated he will issue a temporary suspension of immigration and stated the measure will be in effect for 60 days then will be evaluated after, while he added it will apply to those seeking permanent residency and that the executive order on immigration will probably be signed today.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets extended on losses as the subdued tone rolled over once again from Wall St where sentiment was pressured by the continued oil market rout in which WTI June contract prices briefly slipped to single digits and with underperformance in tech amid President Trump’s plans for an immigration ban given the sector’s reliance on foreign talent. ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.5%) were weaker with Australia dragged lower by the mining related sectors and as corporate updates trickled in with Beach Energy also suffering from softer quarterly production, while the Japanese benchmark briefly fell below 19k as the recent detrimental currency flows reverberated across exporter names. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) conformed to the subdued global risk tone but with losses in the mainland limited by anticipation of further support after Chinese President Xi pledged stronger macro policy tools to soften the epidemic fallout and the State Council noted that China will boost targeted assistance to those in need, as well as small businesses. Finally, 10yr JGBs advanced as the took advantage of the weakness in stocks and amid the BoJ’s presence in the market today for JPY 710bln of JGBs heavily concentrated in 3yr-10yr maturities.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets are lower across the board as the subdued tone rolls over once again from Wall St where sentiment was dampened by the continued oil market rout in which WTI June contract prices briefly slipped to single digits and with underperformance in tech amid President Trump’s planned immigration ban, considering the sector’s reliance on foreign talent. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) are weaker with Australia dragged lower by the mining related sectors and as corporate updates trickle in with Beach Energy also suffering from weaker quarterly production, while the Japanese benchmark briefly fell below 19k as the recent detrimental currency flows reverberates across exporter names. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) conform to the subdued global risk tone but with losses in the mainland limited by anticipation of further support after Chinese President Xi said China will use stronger macro policy tools to soften the epidemic fallout and the State Council noted that China will boost targeted assistance to those in need and small businesses.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is rangebound above the 100.00 level to hold on to the recent safe-haven gains and as the events in Washington D.C. did little to spur price action including the Senate’s passage of the new USD 480bln coronavirus relief bill as expected which the House are set to vote on this Thursday, while US President Trump reiterated to issue a temporary suspension on immigration which will likely be signed today and be in effect for at least 60 days. EUR/USD is flat around 1.0850 ahead of a potential emergency call by the ECB on Wednesday evening where it could discuss junk bonds as collateral and GBP/USD languishes below 1.2300 amid the current glum outlook with BoE's Haldane suggesting H1 is likely to be \"very ugly\" for the economy. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are mostly subdued by the lack of risk appetite and antipodeans were lifted in which AUD/USD surged through 0.6300 and NZD/USD approached 0.6000 before retracing the majority of the gains, while HKD remained firmer at the strong end of the trading range against USD despite intervention by the HKMA which sold HKD for a 2nd consecutive day in an effort to defend the peg.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they benefit from the weakness in stocks and amid the BoJ’s presence in the market today for JPY 710bln of JGBs heavily concentrated in 3yr-10yr maturities.</p>",
