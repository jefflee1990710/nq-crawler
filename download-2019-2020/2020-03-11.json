The virus continues to boil with WHO officially labelling it as a pandemic on Wednesday, and rapid growth rates in countries such as Italy amplify concerns of a delayed, similar outbreak in the US, where officials move closer to ramped fiscal stimulus. The monetary and fiscal powers came together in the UK with the BoE cutting its benchmark rate by 50bps and announcing other liquidity measures, to be followed a few hours later by the UK Budget unveiling fresh fiscal stimulus. Energy sector (XOP, XLE) saw chunky declines on Wednesday, after the dead cat bounce on Tuesday, particularly shale names such as Apache (APA), Noble (NBL) and Occidental (OXY). DXC (DXC) opened higher as entered a USD 5bln asset sale to pay off debt. Boeing (BA) saw some chunky losses as it announced a halt of hiring, with potential for further job cuts later on, additionally it announced it would be planning a full draw-down of its USD 13.8bln loan as a precaution, which could come as early as Friday. Hilton Worldwide (HLT) was offered as it withdrew guidance due to virus uncertainty; other holiday-related stocks suffered too such as casinos (WYNN, LVS, MLCO, CZR), cruise liners (RCL, NCLH, CCL) and airlines (AAL, DAL, UAL, LUV). SPX -4.89% at 2741, NDX -4.37% at 8006, DJI -5.86% at 23,553.</p><p>A choppy session for the TPLEX as duration came to somewhat of a roadblock as equities sold off. Despite the returning risk aversion, after Tuesday’s dead-cat bounce, the belly to long-end of the curve failed to catch a bid. Desks noted the likely profit taking after recent sessions of strong flight-to-quality, particularly RP-type selling the long-end, with bonds failing to perform as an equity hedge as positions become overstretched. Note that participants took advantage of the back up in yields at the 10-year Treasury auction, which stopped through the 0.854% WI by 0.5bps, although did see dealers take a larger than average takedown as well as being covered less than average, but nonetheless did provide a short-lived paring of the steepener, before selling re-emerged into the settlement, where the 10-year yield had risen around 6bps to 0.810%, 2s10s +6.5bps, 2s30s +8.5bps. US T-note futures (h0) settled 13 ticks lower at 137-04+.</p>",

The virus continues to boil with WHO officially labelling it as a pandemic on Wednesday, and rapid growth rates in countries such as Italy amplify concerns of a delayed, similar outbreak in the US, where officials move closer to ramped fiscal stimulus. The monetary and fiscal powers came together in the UK with the BoE cutting its benchmark rate by 50bps and announcing other liquidity measures, to be followed a few hours later by the UK Budget unveiling fresh fiscal stimulus. As duration longs have become extended in recent sessions with rates approaching the zero-lower bound, a slew of profit-taking was exhibited on Wednesday. Additionally, the Fed ramped up its repo operations (again), while its o/n operations saw further demand - note that Boeing, Wynn and Hilton announced they would be drawing down their credit lines, while Blackrock advised its companies to draw on theirs, in a further signal of funding demand ramping up amid supply chain difficulties. Oil's Tuesday rally was shortlived as the offer returned amid reports Saudi was poised to ramp up its production, diminishing hopes of a short-term supply agreement. Data continues to sit in the back seat although US CPI (Feb) did print firmer, for what it's worth. Participants now look towards Trump's statement to be made later on Wednesday (20:00 EDT), where he is likely to declare a national emergency and further travel restrictions. On Thursday, the ECB meeting will draw attention with concerns on how much ammo the bank has left to give.</p><p><strong>* BOE EMERGENCY RATE CUT: </strong>The BoE have become the latest G7 central bank to lower rates, coming to market with an emergency 50bps reduction in the Bank Rate from 0.75% to 0.25%; the MPC were not due to deliver their upcoming policy announcement until March 26th. Note, markets had fully priced in a 25bps cut at the upcoming meeting with a circa 40% probability of a deeper reduction of 50bps. Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 was cited as the main driving force behind the move with the MPC looking \"to help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove sharp and large, but should be temporary\". In terms of other measures, the MPC refrained from expanding gilt or corporate purchases at this stage, potentially, leaning in favour of using them later down the line if required given that room to the downside is particularly limited for rates. Elsewhere, policymakers opted to offer a new term-funding scheme with additional incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises. The scheme will offer four-year funding over the next 12 months and be carried out at a rate at, or very close to the Bank rate. Additionally, the FPC cut the UK's counter-cyclical buffer to 0.0% vs. Prev. 1.0% (was due to reach 2.0% by December 2020) in a move that will release support of up to GBP 190bln to businesses. In terms of the fallout of the decision, the measures will have to be taken in the context of measures unveiled in today's budget. However, ING conclude that given the demand impact on businesses, the rate reduction will likely do little to offset the cashflow damage from COVID-19, as such, targeted measures that help banks keep credit flowing will likely be deemed more relevant. At the follow-up press conference, current Governor Carney was quick to reassure markets that the MPC could lower rates to close to but above the 0% mark, note, incoming-Governor Bailey said last week that the base rate could be lowered to 0.1% if needs be. It remains to be seen whether or not the MPC would come to market with a 15bps reduction, however, given that historically, movements have occurred in 25bps increments, the market might see a further reduction to 0.1% as piecemeal. With this in mind, Pantheon Macro look for rates to remain at current levels until Q2 2021. Therefore, the next move from the Bank could instead be geared more towards gilt and corporate purchases, which could also explain why both were maintained at current levels today.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLED USD 1.38 LOWER AT USD 32.98/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 1.43 LOWER AT USD 35.79/BBL: </strong>Oil prices again sold off on Wednesday as OPEC taps look set to turn up. Saudi Aramco has received a directive from the Energy Ministry to increase maximum sustainable capacity from 12mln BPD to 13mln BPD, with oil production capacity to be raised to 13mln BPD as soon as possible. This follows Wednesday’s Aramco announcement that it will be supplying customers with 12.3mln BPD starting April 1st – the timeframe for 13mln BPD output is unclear thus far. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia has asked government departments to submit proposals for 20-30% cuts to their budgets, according to sources. This alludes to the Kingdom readying for a longer period of low energy prices to balance its books. Meanwhile, Russia has shown no signs of caving in – the Finance Ministry highlighted that Moscow is better prepared than any other country with oil revenues. That said, Energy Minister Novak stated that dialogue with OPEC will continue and representatives will be present at the March 19th JTC meeting. Later, Russian Deputy Energy Minister Sorokin said OPEC+ could not cut output indefinitely, where OPEC+ asked Russia to cut by an additional 300k BPD but said it would be technically challenging. UAE has also become the latest producer to increase output, with ADNOC stating that they are in a position to supply markets with 4mln BPD in April and will accelerate to 5mln BPD capacity target, brought forward from 2030. In light of recent events, Algeria’s Energy Minister said intense discussion are being held with OPEC and non-OPEC producers to stabilize the market. Elsewhere, the EIA report caused little market reaction, largely confirming the private data release, where crude stocks (bbls) built more than expected at 7.7mln, gasoline drew 5mln and distillates drew 6.4mln, both deeper than expected, whilst crude production dipped by 100k BPD to 13.0mln BPD.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19 RESPONSE: </strong>The<strong> </strong>WHO declared the coronavirus as a Pandemic as global cases continue to rise. During the UK budget, UK Chancellor Sunuk announced a USD 7bln coronavirus package<strong> </strong>to assist with tackling the virus, meanwhile the BoE reduced its CCyB to 0% to free up liquidity while it also announced a new term funding scheme to assist smaller businesses. Across to Europe, Italian PM Conte announced the Government has set aside a total of EUR 25bln to assist the economy, up from the EUR 16bln touted yesterday. For this to go ahead, the Economy Minister will ask the cabinet to increase its 2020 deficit spending to EUR 20bln, with the cabinet to approve on Friday virus measures worth EUR 12bln. The 2020 deficit levels will depend on how much is spent, he says, noting it is premature to make forecasts. To finance the package the Economy Minister stated some measures could be financed via EU funds, taking the pressure off of Italian public accounts. Meanwhile, Conte did not rule out even tighter restrictive measures, following the lock down. Looking ahead, US President Trump is to hold a press briefing at 20:00 ET / 00:00 GMT which will cover economics and health care.</p><p><strong>* UK BUDGET: </strong>Following the monetary loosening from the BoE earlier in the session, Chancellor Sunak's debut budget provided a further stimulus injection into the UK economy as the nation attempts to insulate itself from the fallout of COVID-19. Chancellor Sunak announced a \"three point plan\" to help combat the impact of the virus which will see the government spend GBP 5bln to support the NHS, GBP 7bln to support the self-employed and businesses and a further GBP 18bln of fiscal loosening to help support the economy in 2020; a grand total of GBP 30bln. Furthermore, Sunak vowed to do whatever it takes to help support the economy and provide further measures if needed. Ahead of the release, analysts had speculated over whether or not Sunak would abandon the Conservative's fiscal framework, which would have allowed himself more leeway in providing support. However, the Chancellor noted that today's budget will meet current fiscal rules with a review of the framework to be carried out by Autumn. That said, the Chancellor certainly exceeded expectations for fiscal support and also announced an increase in infrastructure spending of more than GBP 600bln over the course of the next five years; an ambition that was aided today by the BoE's decision to lower rates and therefore borrowing costs for the UK. In terms of assessing the impact of the budget on the UK economy, Pantheon Macro notes that the measures today will not prevent UK GDP from \"falling sharply\" over the next couple of months. However, the consultancy suggests that it will likely improve the chances that the UK economy rebounds in H2. On the borrowing front, today's figures are slightly opaque given that projections are predicated on OBR assumptions that do not factor in the impact of the virus, which, once factored in later down the line will almost inevitably mean that borrowing as a percentage of GDP in 2020/21 will be higher than currently envisaged. As such, a fiscal tightening in 2022/23 will likely be required in order to abide by the current fiscal framework. Overall, Chancellor Sunak appears to have gone above-and-beyond market expectations on the easing front, which, allied with earlier action from the BoE will have assuaged some concerns over the UK's economic readiness to deal with COVID-19, however, with the extent of the virus still unknown, further easing cannot be ruled out at this stage.</p><p><strong>* ECB PREVIEW: </strong>Surveyed analysts expect the Bank to stand pat on rates this time around, however, market pricing currently assigns a 100% probability of a 10bps reduction to the deposit rate with a further 10bps priced in by September. The meeting takes place against a backdrop of severe economic uncertainty in which the full extent of the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown. However, containment efforts across the continent have certainly impaired economic activity and as such, heightened calls for stimulus from the Governing Council. It remains to be seen whether the ECB will adopt a wait-and-see approach or unveil supportive measures, which could include rate reductions, expansion of the APP, adjustments to tiering thresholds, sweetening of the terms of existing TLTROs, financing measures for SMEs. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24046/download\">Click here for link.</a></p><p><strong>* US CPI: </strong>CPI Y/Y rose more than expected at 2.3%, although the pace slowed from the prior 2.5% while the M/M figure maintained a 0.1% increase, above expectations for a flat print. Core CPI for February printed in line with expectations for a 0.2% rise, maintaining January’s pace, while Y/Y picked up to 2.4% from 2.2% and 0.1% above expectations; Pantheon Macroeconomics expect core inflation to slow over the next few months. The consultancy highlights the headline was depressed by a drop in gasoline prices with a bigger drop to come next month. To conclude PM note core inflation was trending solidly ahead of COVID-19, although travel related costs are expected to drop give the fall in air fares from a slump in demand while and oil prices, while the falling cost of distribution of goods will push prices on a variety of items over the upcoming months, although some of the strength in rentals and perhaps health care services will persist.</p><p><strong>* BOJ:</strong> Multiple source reports hit which initially suggested the Bank is to keep purchasing ETFs at the current pace of JPY 100bln in order to continue to support the stock market, at least until March 31st, which would initially rebuff prior day sources that the figure could be raised. However, later sources stated the BoJ is likely to ease monetary policy next week to prevent market volatility from affecting business sentiment, with increasing ETF purchases seen among the likely options. The sources noted that there is no consensus yet, the plan is preliminary and subject to change as board are yet to discuss the next steps.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>The situation in Idlib resurfaces today after Turkish President Erdogan stated that the ceasefire agreed with Russia has been violated on the ground. Although the violations are “small” the Turkish President has urged Russia to take measures over the breach of the week-long ceasefire and reiterated that Ankara will respond heavily, with its harshest retaliation yet, if its military observation posts in the region come under attack. Analysts have previously noted that the ceasefire, under which Turkey and Russia also agreed to establish a secure corridor along a key east-west highway in Idlib and hold joint patrols on it as of March 15, seems as fragile as the prior attempts. Furthermore, the Turkish President stated that Turkey will keep the EU border open to migrants until EU keep promises under 2016 deal, comments which arose after Turkey and EU failed to come to an agreement.</p><p><strong>* RBA’s DEBELLE: </strong>The Deputy Governor noted last night there are scenarios where QE by the Bank would have to be considered, stating that it would consider forward guidance and keeping bond yields low. During his speech he said “If you’re thinking about trying to keep the front end of the risk-free curve low for a period of time then that’s more analogous to an interest-rate reduction”. Debelle also noted it is easier to think about it in terms of price, rather than quantity when asked about potential bond purchases. As the Bank runs out of policy room with its cash rate at 0.5%, 25bps above its lower bound, participants have been expecting some form of QE. The comments on yields and “price rather than quantity” suggests to analysts that QE from the Central Bank could be more focused on Yield Curve Control, similar to the BoJ, instead of large bond buys.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 13 TICKS LOWER AT 137-04+. </strong>A choppy session for the TPLEX as duration came to somewhat of a roadblock as equities sold off. Despite the returning risk aversion, after Tuesday’s dead-cat bounce, the belly to long-end of the curve failed to catch a bid. Desks noted the likely profit taking after recent sessions of strong flight-to-quality, particularly RP-type selling the long-end, with bonds failing to perform as an equity hedge as positions become overstretched. Note that participants took advantage of the back up in yields at the 10-year Treasury auction, which stopped through the 0.854% WI by 0.5bps, although did see dealers take a larger than average takedown as well as being covered less than average, but nonetheless did provide a short-lived paring of the steepener, before selling re-emerged into the settlement, where the 10-year yield had risen around 6bps to 0.810%, 2s10s +6.5bps, 2s30s +8.5bps.</p><p><strong>* REPO OPERATIONS: </strong>NY Fed will offer at least USD 175bln (Prev. 150bln) in the o/n repo operations. NY Fed maintained the term operations at USD 45bln, and announced it will offer three one-month operations of USD 50bln.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -4.89% at 2741, NDX -4.37% at 8006, DJI -5.86% at 23,553. <strong>Sectors: </strong>Industrials -5.95%, Financials –5.52%, Energy -5.46%, Real Estate -5.44%, Consumer Discretionary -5.36%, Utilities -5.1%, Consumer Staples -4.89%, Materials -4.76%, Technology -4.7%, Communication Svs. -4.33%, Health Care -3.91%.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Energy sector (XOP, XLE) saw chunky declines on Wednesday, after the dead cat bounce on Tuesday, particularly shale names such as Apache (APA), Noble (NBL) and Occidental (OXY). DXC (DXC) opened higher as entered a USD 5bln asset sale to pay off debt. Boeing (BA) saw some chunky losses as it announced a halt of hiring, with potential for further job cuts later on, additionally it announced it would be planning a full draw-down of its USD 13.8bln loan as a precaution, which could come as early as Friday. Hilton Worldwide (HLT) was offered as it withdrew guidance due to virus uncertainty; other holiday-related stocks suffered too such as casinos (WYNN, LVS, MLCO, CZR), cruise liners (RCL, NCLH, CCL) and airlines (AAL, DAL, UAL, LUV) – note that previously names most exposed to China saw the brunt of the selling, although now as the virus becomes that of a pandemic, the selling seems less discriminate now. Furthermore, the declining sentiment weighed on financials (WFC, JPM, BAC, C). Conversely, some COVID-19 beneficiaries such as Gilead (GILD) and Zoom Technologies (ZM), although not all were up (CLX, WMT, TGT, VZ). Cloudera (CLDR) traded higher after an impressive earnings report. PepsiCo (PEP) traded lower, albeit less so than the market, following it announcing it is to acquire Rockstar energy drinks for USD 3.85bln. Apple (AAPL) was under pressure by a PT cut at BofA.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong>&nbsp;saw a similar story as it continued to rebound from two-year lows as yields continue to reverse, although gains in the greenback were less pronounced than prior days as risk appetite soured with US equities entering into a bear market coincided with haven appreciation.&nbsp;<strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong>saw a volatile day amid the emergency rate cut and release of the UK budget, GBP saw initial weakness but quickly reversed as the stimulus measures provided by the BOE should be positive for companies given the reduction in CCyB and the introduction of the term funding scheme, although GBP gains reversed course and traded weaker against both the buck and EUR to end the day.&nbsp;<strong>EUR</strong>&nbsp;was flat against the greenback but firmer against Stirling ahead of the ECB decision tomorrow, which is to be accompanied with a statement from the ECB’s Bank Supervision Arm outlining ways to support the sector, according to sources. Meanwhile, Italy further increased the allocated size of its coronavirus stimulus package to EUR 25bln, with EUR 12bln to be accepted on Friday by the Cabinet. Haven currencies (ex-gold) were bid, with&nbsp;<strong>EURCHF</strong>&nbsp;back beneath the touted SNB eyed 1.06 figure and&nbsp;<strong>USDJPY</strong>&nbsp;saw lows of 104.10 in late trade and remained beneath 105 heading into ASIA-PAC trade.&nbsp;<strong>Antipodes</strong>&nbsp;were mixed,&nbsp;<strong>AUD</strong>&nbsp;traded lower amid the broader risk appetite while comments from RBA’s Debelle seemed to suggest Yield Curve Control is an option for QE, while&nbsp;<strong>NZD</strong>&nbsp;traded firmer against the dollar amid firmer electric card retail sales data.&nbsp;<strong>EMFX</strong>&nbsp;sold off amid the broader risk appetite;&nbsp;<strong>RUB &amp; MXN</strong>&nbsp;underperformed as oil prices fell further on further reports that Saudi is to increase oil production even further to 13mln BPD and&nbsp;<strong>ZAR</strong>&nbsp;was hit on continued loadshedding concerns from Eskom.&nbsp;</p>",

Desks noted the likely profit taking after recent sessions of strong flight-to-quality, particularly RP-type selling the long-end, with bonds failing to perform as an equity hedge as positions become overstretched. Note that participants took advantage of the back up in yields at the 10-year Treasury auction, which stopped through the 0.854% WI by 0.5bps, although did see dealers take a larger than average takedown as well as being covered less than average, but nonetheless did provide a short-lived paring of the steepener, before selling re-emerged into the settlement, where the 10-year yield had risen around 6bps to 0.810%, 2s10s +6.5bps, 2s30s +8.5bps.</li><li><strong>REPO:</strong> NY Fed will offer at least USD 175bln (Prev. 150bln) in the o/n repo operations.

Saudi Aramco has received a directive from the Energy Ministry to increase maximum sustainable capacity from 12mln BPD to 13mln BPD, with oil production capacity to be raised to 13mln BPD as soon as possible. This follows Wednesday’s Aramco announcement that it will be supplying customers with 12.3mln BPD starting April 1st – the timeframe for 13mln BPD output is unclear thus far. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia has asked government departments to submit proposals for 20-30% cuts to their budgets, according to sources. This alludes to the Kingdom readying for a longer period of low energy prices to balance its books. Meanwhile, Russia has shown no signs of caving in – the Finance Ministry highlighted that Moscow is better prepared than any other country with oil revenues. That said, Energy Minister Novak stated that dialogue with OPEC will continue and representatives will be present at the March 19th JTC meeting. Later, Russian Deputy Energy Minister Sorokin said OPEC+ could not cut output indefinitely, where OPEC+ asked Russia to cut by an additional 300k BPD but said it would be technically challenging. UAE has also become the latest producer to increase output, with ADNOC stating that they are in a position to supply markets with 4mln BPD in April and will accelerate to 5mln BPD capacity target, brought forward from 2030. In light of recent events, Algeria’s Energy Minister said intense discussion are being held with OPEC and non-OPEC producers to stabilize the market. Elsewhere, the EIA report caused little market reaction, largely confirming the private data release, where crude stocks (bbls) built more than expected at 7.7mln, gasoline drew 5mln and distillates drew 6.4mln, both deeper than expected, whilst crude production dipped by 100k BPD to 13.0mln BPD.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar has been largely side-lined given more eye-catching events elsewhere, but the <strong>DXY</strong> is holding above the 96.000 handle and extending recovery gains in late EU trade to 96.624 vs 95.909 at worst on the premise or proviso that a US fiscal package to combat COVID-19 will be forthcoming at some stage following disappointment that nothing real/tangible emerged yesterday. For the record, US inflation was slightly firmer than expected on a y/y basis in headline and core terms, but did not prompt much in the way of a response, partly as the data coincided with the start of the UK budget and the overriding focus remains on nCoV, contagion and attempts to contain the epidemic/economic fallout. Back to the index, 96.650 represents Fib resistance.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The stage was already set for UK markets given a busy midweek session for scheduled events, but the BoE upstaged data and the Budget in many ways by announcing a 50 bp rate cut ahead of the Liffe and FTSE opens. Moreover, the accompanying statement included details of a new TFSME plus a coordinated full point reduction in the CCYB for banks to 0%, while incumbent Governor Carney and his impending replacement Bailey both underlined that the pre-March MPC policy meeting measures were part of a wider multi-pronged strategy designed to counter the adverse impact of the coronavirus concocted with the Treasury. This arguably upped the ante and anticipation for new Chancellor Sunak to open the fiscal spigot, with the Pound rapidly regaining composure ahead of the aforementioned economic indicators and unruffled by flat monthly GDP vs +0.1% forecast accordingly. However, Sunak mainly stuck to the script aside from freezing fuel duties and Cable relinquished 1.2900+ status again more on the Greenback’s revival, while Eur/Gbp remained closer to the base of a circa 0.8840-0.8716 range.</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The major outperformers and most resilient to the Buck’s comeback, as the Yen maintained 105.00+ territory on underlying safe-haven grounds and Kiwi managed to keep sight of 0.6300 due to supportive <strong>AUD</strong>/Nzd flows following RBA warnings about virus knock-on effects that might warrant unconventional policy action and/or reinforcing dovish guidance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/EUR</strong></p><p>All mixed vs the Dollar after forging early gains, with the Franc retesting 0.9400, Loonie back under 1.3700 against the backdrop of retreating crude prices and Euro eyeing support around 1.1250 after losing grip of 1.1300 and breaching a decent option expiry at the big figure (1 bn).</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>Still no sign of the Riksbank rushing to join global peers with stimulus, so the Sek is deriving support and a cushion against bouts of risk aversion in contrast to the Nok and Rub that are also prone if not dependent on the fortunes of oil. Meanwhile, the Try is still vulnerable to a breakdown of relations with the US and Russia over arms and Syria, but did get a fleeting fillip from a smaller than expected Turkish current account gap.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Sentiment has recovered from the downbeat tone in the APAC regions as futures resurfaced into positive territory following the surprise BoE rate reduction in a bid to cushion the impacts of the virus outbreak.</strong> Cash markets also opened higher to the tune of ~2% [Eurostoxx 50 +1.8%] with broad-based gains seen across the board, but with UK’s FTSE choppy and moving from the top gainer to the laggard on Sterling action ahead of the UK budget unveiling later today (Full preview available on the Newsquawk Research Suite). Sectors are mostly in the green with the exception of the energy sector given the decline in prices in the oil complex whilst financials lead the gains. Unsurprisingly, UK banks have received a tailwind from the BoE cut - with Barclays (+1.5%), Lloyds (+2.0%), Standard Chartered (+3.3%) and HSBC (+1.6%) all in firm positive territory. However, analysts at Goldman Sachs see the announcement of the New Term Funding Scheme as a positive for smaller banks and negative for larger banks as it reduces the latter’s potential hedge from mortgage pricing. Elsewhere, Adidas (-6.4%) shares plumbed the depths post-earnings after noting that the virus outbreak had a material negative impact on China revenues – which are expected to be between EUR 0.8-1.0bln below the prior year’s levels. Similarly, Puma (-3.3%) also issued a negative warning regarding virus impacts, as such these cautious comments have brought down the likes of Kering (-0.7%) and Richemont (-1.1%) in sympathy. Other earnings-related movers include Clas Ohlson (-4.4%) and Mediaset (-0.1%). Meanwhile State-side, desks note US democratic candidate Sanders’ poor performance on Super Tuesday is a mild positive for stocks, although Biden could eventually prove to be a headwind to stocks as the market would prefer a second Trump term.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP - </strong>Not the biggest net mover by any means, but the Pound has been among the liveliest majors following the pre-Liffe, UK Budget and timetabled March MPC policy meeting ½ point rate cut. The emergency action induced all round Sterling weakness akin to the Dollar’s post-50 bp FOMC ease decline last Tuesday, as Cable recoiled from 1.2900+ to sub-1.2850 and Eur/Gbp jumped to circa 0.8840 from just under 0.8800. However, as the BoE statement and subsequent presser underscored the coordinated nature of measures taken, including funding for SMEs and a 1% reduction in counter-cyclical buffers for banks to zero, and fiscal loosening to come from the Chancellor, Cable and the cross retraced all and more of their initial moves while largely if not totalling shrugging off data in the form of January GDP, IP and output plus trade.</p><p><strong>NZD/JPY/AUD/EUR/CAD/NOK - </strong>All firmer vs the Greenback, as the DXY fades alongside recovering risk sentiment partly due to the lack of anything material from the US in terms of major steps to counter the adverse economic/social impact of COVID-19, not to mention a degree of disappointment that President Trump was conspicuously absent from the official White House event. The Kiwi is currently top G10 performer, albeit consolidating gains on the 0.6300 handle with the aid of favourable Aud/Nzd tailwinds as the Aussie lags in wake of dovish sounding remarks from RBA Assistant Governor Debelle (underlining QE and forward guidance as potential anti-nCoV contagion tools). Aud/Usd is pivoting 0.6500 and the cross is hovering just above 1.0300, both some distance from recent peaks. Elsewhere, the Yen has pared losses between 105.67-104.11 parameters on the aforementioned flagging risk appetite after Tuesday’s part revival as the Japanese Government prepares supplementary budget initiatives, but the Euro has retreated further from Monday’s near 1.1500 highs to straddle 1.1300 awaiting tomorrow’s ECB meet and the bloc’s fiscal response to the coronavirus. Conversely, the Loonie continues to nurse losses around 1.3700 in the run up to Canadian Q4 cap u that is due alongside US CPI, but also eyeing crude prices like the Norwegian Krona and Russian Rouble that are losing momentum due to crude topping out – Eur/Nok back above 10.8500 and Usd/Rub over 71.5000 again.</p><p><strong>RBA Deputy Governor Debelle</strong> said coronavirus is causing large increase in risk aversion and uncertainty, while he added the global economy will be materially weaker in Q1 and period ahead but also noted lower interest rates will help offset demand shock from virus. Furthermore, Debelle also stated that there are scenarios where QE would have to be considered and that they would also consider forward guidance as well as keeping bond yields low. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Another very volatile first half for EU debt, with German bonds lagging initially and BTPs leading the chorus cheering comments from ECB President Largarde promising decisive monetary and fiscal injections to help prevent COVID-19 turning into a repeat of the GFC. However, Gilts grabbed the spotlight on their return to Liffe and adopted a defensive position post-BoE rate cut and SME lending scheme, awaiting a big budget splurge from 12.30GMT. Conversely, US Treasuries have held a firm underlying bid for the most part overnight and still erring towards risk sentiment souring after a let down in terms of specifics and a final roll out of US Government ‘steps’ to cushion the nCoV blow. In terms of tops and bottoms, Bunds have been up to 177.91 and down to 176.55 vs Tuesday’s 177.59 close, Gilts 137.57-136.82 vs 137.95, 10 year USTs 138-19-137-07 vs 137-20 and BTPs 144.88-142.74 vs 142.60.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Another wild ride so far in the energy complex with WTI and Brent front month-futures sliding </strong>from overnight highs in wake of further supply prospects and the readying from major oil producers for a prolonged period of low energy prices. Saudi Aramco has received a directive from the Energy Ministry to increase maximum sustainable capacity from 12mln BPD to 13mln BPD, with oil production capacity to be raised to 13mln BPD as soon as possible. This follows yesterday’s Aramco announcement that it will be supplying customers with 12.3mln BPD starting April 1st – the timeframe for 13mln BPD output is unclear thus far. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia has asked government departments to submit proposals for 20-30% cuts to their budgets, according to sources. This alludes to the Kingdom readying for a longer period of low energy prices to balance its books. Meanwhile, Russia has shown no signs of caving in – the Finance Ministry highlighted that Moscow is better prepared than any other country with oil revenues. That said, Energy Minister Novak stated that dialogue with OPEC will continue and representatives will be present at the March 19th JTC meeting.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>Sentiment has recovered from the downbeat tone in the APAC regions as futures resurfaced into positive territory following the surprise BoE rate reduction in a bid to cushion the impacts of the virus outbreak. Cash markets also opened higher to the tune of ~2% [Eurostoxx 50 +1.8%] with broad-based gains seen across the board, but with UK’s FTSE choppy and moving from the top gainer to the laggard on Sterling action ahead of the UK budget unveiling later today (Full preview available on the Newsquawk Research Suite). Sectors are mostly in the green with the exception of the energy sector given the decline in prices in the oil complex whilst financials lead the gains. Unsurprisingly, UK banks have received a tailwind from the BoE cut - with Barclays (+1.5%), Lloyds (+2.0%), Standard Chartered (+3.3%) and HSBC (+1.6%) all in firm positive territory. However, analysts at Goldman Sachs see the announcement of the New Term Funding Scheme as a positive for smaller banks and negative for larger banks as it reduces the latter’s potential hedge from mortgage pricing. Elsewhere, Adidas (-6.4%) shares plumbed the depths post-earnings after noting that the virus outbreak had a material negative impact on China revenues – which are expected to be between EUR 0.8-1.0bln below the prior year’s levels. Similarly, Puma (-3.3%) also issued a negative warning regarding virus impacts, as such these cautious comments have brought down the likes of Kering (-0.7%) and Richemont (-1.1%) in sympathy. Other earnings-related movers include Clas Ohlson (-4.4%) and Mediaset (-0.1%). Meanwhile State-side, desks note US democratic candidate Sanders’ poor performance on Super Tuesday is a mild positive for stocks, although Biden could eventually prove to be a headwind to stocks as the market would prefer a second Trump term.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>GBP - Not the biggest net mover by any means, but the Pound has been among the liveliest majors following the pre-Liffe, UK Budget and timetabled March MPC policy meeting ½ point rate cut. The emergency action induced all round Sterling weakness akin to the Dollar’s post-50 bp FOMC ease decline last Tuesday, as Cable recoiled from 1.2900+ to sub-1.2850 and Eur/Gbp jumped to circa 0.8840 from just under 0.8800. However, as the BoE statement and subsequent presser underscored the coordinated nature of measures taken, including funding for SMEs and a 1% reduction in counter-cyclical buffers for banks to zero, and fiscal loosening to come from the Chancellor, Cable and the cross retraced all and more of their initial moves while largely if not totalling shrugging off data in the form of January GDP, IP and output plus trade.</p><p>NZD/JPY/AUD/EUR/CAD/NOK - All firmer vs the Greenback, as the DXY fades alongside recovering risk sentiment partly due to the lack of anything material from the US in terms of major steps to counter the adverse economic/social impact of COVID-19, not to mention a degree of disappointment that President Trump was conspicuously absent from the official White House event. The Kiwi is currently top G10 performer, albeit consolidating gains on the 0.6300 handle with the aid of favourable Aud/Nzd tailwinds as the Aussie lags in wake of dovish sounding remarks from RBA Assistant Governor Debelle (underlining QE and forward guidance as potential anti-nCoV contagion tools). Aud/Usd is pivoting 0.6500 and the cross is hovering just above 1.0300, both some distance from recent peaks. Elsewhere, the Yen has pared losses between 105.67-104.11 parameters on the aforementioned flagging risk appetite after Tuesday’s part revival as the Japanese Government prepares supplementary budget initiatives, but the Euro has retreated further from Monday’s near 1.1500 highs to straddle 1.1300 awaiting tomorrow’s ECB meet and the bloc’s fiscal response to the coronavirus. Conversely, the Loonie continues to nurse losses around 1.3700 in the run up to Canadian Q4 cap u that is due alongside US CPI, but also eyeing crude prices like the Norwegian Krona and Russian Rouble that are losing momentum due to crude topping out – Eur/Nok back above 10.8500 and Usd/Rub over 71.5000 again.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Another very volatile first half for EU debt, with German bonds lagging initially and BTPs leading the chorus cheering comments from ECB President Largarde promising decisive monetary and fiscal injections to help prevent COVID-19 turning into a repeat of the GFC. However, Gilts grabbed the spotlight on their return to Liffe and adopted a defensive position post-BoE rate cut and SME lending scheme, awaiting a big budget splurge from 12.30GMT. Conversely, US Treasuries have held a firm underlying bid for the most part overnight and still erring towards risk sentiment souring after a let down in terms of specifics and a final roll out of US Government ‘steps’ to cushion the nCoV blow. In terms of tops and bottoms, Bunds have been up to 177.91 and down to 176.55 vs Tuesday’s 177.59 close, Gilts 137.57-136.82 vs 137.95, 10 year USTs 138-19-137-07 vs 137-20 and BTPs 144.88-142.74 vs 142.60.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Another wild ride so far in the energy complex with <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front month-futures sliding from overnight highs in wake of further supply prospects and the readying from major oil producers for a prolonged period of low energy prices. <strong>Saudi Aramco has received a directive from the Energy Ministry to increase maximum sustainable capacity from 12mln BPD to 13mln BPD, with oil production capacity to be raised to 13mln BPD as soon as possible</strong>. This follows yesterday’s Aramco announcement that it will be supplying customers with 12.3mln BPD starting April 1st – the timeframe for 13mln BPD output is unclear thus far. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia has asked government departments to submit proposals for 20-30% cuts to their budgets, according to sources. This alludes to the Kingdom readying for a longer period of low energy prices to balance its books. Meanwhile, Russia has shown no signs of caving in – the Finance Ministry highlighted that Moscow is better prepared than any other country with oil revenues. That said, Energy Minister Novak stated that dialogue with OPEC will continue and representatives will be present at the March 19th JTC meeting. UAE has also become the latest producer to increase output, with ADNOC stating that they are in a position to supply markets with 4mln BPD in April and will accelerate to 5mln BPD capacity target, brought forward from 2030. As mentioned above, the contracts have wiped up overnight gains with <strong>WTI</strong> Apr’20 slipping from USD 36.28/bbl to a current low of ~USD 33.08/bbl whilst <strong>Brent</strong> Apr’20 similarly declined from a high of USD 39.60 to a low of ~USD 35.73/bbl.

The emergency action induced all round Sterling weakness akin to the Dollar’s post-50 bp FOMC ease decline last Tuesday, as Cable recoiled from 1.2900+ to sub-1.2850 and Eur/Gbp jumped to circa 0.8840 from just under 0.8800. However, as the BoE statement and subsequent presser underscored the coordinated nature of measures taken, including funding for SMEs and a 1% reduction in counter-cyclical buffers for banks to zero, and fiscal loosening to come from the Chancellor, Cable and the cross retraced all and more of their initial moves while largely if not totalling shrugging off data in the form of January GDP, IP and output plus trade.</p><p><strong>NZD/JPY/AUD/EUR/CAD/NOK</strong></p><p>All firmer vs the Greenback, as the <strong>DXY </strong>fades alongside recovering risk sentiment partly due to the lack of anything material from the US in terms of major steps to counter the adverse economic/social impact of COVID-19, not to mention a degree of disappointment that President Trump was conspicuously absent from the official White House event. The Kiwi is currently top G10 performer, albeit consolidating gains on the 0.6300 handle with the aid of favourable Aud/Nzd tailwinds as the Aussie lags in wake of dovish sounding remarks from RBA Assistant Governor Debelle (underlining QE and forward guidance as potential anti-nCoV contagion tools). Aud/Usd is pivoting 0.6500 and the cross is hovering just above 1.0300, both some distance from recent peaks. Elsewhere, the Yen has pared losses between 105.67-104.11 parameters on the aforementioned flagging risk appetite after Tuesday’s part revival as the Japanese Government prepares supplementary budget initiatives, but the Euro has retreated further from Monday’s near 1.1500 highs to straddle 1.1300 awaiting tomorrow’s ECB meet and the bloc’s fiscal response to the coronavirus. Conversely, the Loonie continues to nurse losses around 1.3700 in the run up to Canadian Q4 cap u that is due alongside US CPI, but also eyeing crude prices like the Norwegian Krona and Russian Rouble that are losing momentum due to crude topping out – Eur/Nok back above 10.8500 and Usd/Rub over 71.5000 again.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The BoE have become the latest G7 central bank to lower rates, coming to market with an emergency&nbsp;50bps reduction in the Bank Rate from 0.75% to 0.25%; the MPC were not due to deliver their upcoming policy announcement until March 26th. Note, markets had fully priced in a 25bps cut at the upcoming meeting with a circa 40% probability of a deeper reduction&nbsp;of 50bps. Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 was cited as the main driving force behind the move with the MPC looking \"to help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove sharp and large, but should be temporary\". In terms of other measures, the MPC refrained from expanding gilt or corporate&nbsp;purchases at this stage, potentially, leaning in favour of using them later down the line if required given that room to the downside is particularly limited for rates. Elsewhere, policymakers opted to offer a new term-funding scheme with additional incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises. The scheme will offer four-year funding over the next 12 months and be carried out at a rate at, or very close to the Bank rate. Additionally, the FPC cut the UK's counter-cyclical buffer to 0.0% vs. Prev. 1.0% (was due to reach 2.0% by December 2020) in a move that will release support of up to GBP 190bln to businesses. In terms of the fallout of the decision, the measures will have to be taken in the context of measures unveiled in today's budget. However, ING conclude that given the demand impact on businesses, the rate reduction will likely do little to offset the cashflow&nbsp;damage from COVID-19, as such, targeted measures that help banks keep credit flowing will likely be deemed more relevant. Looking ahead, from a rate perspective, incoming-Governor Bailey said last week that the base rate could be lowered to 0.1% if needs be. It remains to be seen whether or not the MPC would come to market with a 15bps reduction, however, given that historically, movements have occurred in 25bps increments, the market might see a further reduction to 0.1% as piecemeal. With this in mind, Pantheon Macro look for rates to remain at current levels until Q2 2021. Therefore, the next move from the Bank could instead be geared more towards gilt and corporate purchases, which could also explain why both were maintained at current levels today.&nbsp;</p>",

Furthermore, another firm victory by Biden at the Democrat Primaries was largely ignored by the greenback with former VP Biden so far projected to win Idaho, Missouri, Mississippi and the key battleground of Michigan which was the largest among the states for contention in terms of delegates. The pullback in <strong>USD</strong> provided some much-needed reprieve for its major counterparts including <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> which reclaimed the 1.1300 handle before breaching several shorter-term MA levels including its 5-Day moving average of 1.1323, and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> rose back above 1.2900 although upside was capped heading into today’s Budget announcement which is expected to flag the end of austerity with a jump in borrowing and GBP 100bln boost to infrastructure spending.

Note that US equity futures hit their 5% limit ups in the pre-market alongside rising rates, before drifting lower, which Treasuries found a bid on the back of, as desks noted real money behind equity and oil sales. However, the risk aversion found its limit at the tail-end of European trade and yields then rose again, although not as high as earlier in the session. Note that there was some knee-jerk selling pressure in the belly of the curve after the 3-year Treasury auction tailed by 2.7bps, with a weaker than average B/C ratio, seeing Dealers takedown a larger than usual portion of the offering – coming ahead of the 10-year and 30-year auctions on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. By settlement, the 2-year yield had risen 15bps, 10-year yield +25bps, and 30-year yield +30bps.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac stocks are mixed as the prior session’s firm rebound on Wall St that was spurred by stimulus hopes, has failed to resonate across the region with US equity futures also pulling back after the White House press conference provided very little details regarding economic measures, although downside is also stemmed as focus shifts to the Democrat primaries where mainstream candidate and former VP Biden is set for another decisive victory in the Presidential nomination race. ASX 200 (-2.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.4%) are lower with the former dragged by heavy losses in gold miners and its largest weighted financials sector, while the Japanese benchmark extends its retreat from the 20k level as USD/JPY oscillates back below 105.00. Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) are indecisive amid a lack of fresh catalysts and as the PBoC continues to withhold from liquidity operations, while the latest update from mainland China showed a slight pick-up in the number of additional coronavirus cases and related deaths although this was only marginal and in-fitting with the stabilization narrative.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly weaker as it gives back some of the prior day’s spoils although it remains above the 96.00 level following the recent rebound in yields and with price action hanging on stimulus package hopes which have yet to transpire. Furthermore, another firm victory by Biden at the Democrat primaries was largely ignored by the greenback with the former VP so far projected to win Missouri, Mississippi and the key battleground of Michigan which was the largest among the states for contention today in terms of delegates and which Sanders labelled as the most important state where he had hoped to replicate his shock win against Hillary Clinton in 2016. The mild pullback in USD has provided some much-needed reprieve for its major counterparts including EUR/USD which has reclaimed the 1.1300 handle to reside by its 5-Day moving average of 1.1323, and with GBP/USD back above 1.2900 although upside is capped heading into today’s Budget announcement which is expected to flag the end of austerity with a jump in borrowing and GBP 100bln boost to infrastructure spending. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is choppy around the 105.00 level and antipodeans nurse losses but with price action restricted by a lack of tier-1 data and following a weaker CNY reference rate setting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are slightly higher amid weakness in Tokyo stocks and following the swings in T-notes, while the BoJ are also present in the market today for JPY 430bln of JGBs mainly concentred in the belly.</p>",
