International Business Machines (IBM) reported mixed results; EPS beat whilst revenue was a little weak, however, the co. reported decent gains in its Cloud and Cognitive Solutions division. eBay Inc. (EBAY) beat on top and bottom lines. Danaher Corp. (DHR) beat on top and bottom lines. Honeywell Int'l Inc. (HON) raised EPS and revenue growth guidance. Dover Corp (DOV) beat on bottom line, raised guidance slightly. Philip Morris International (PM) posted a big top and bottom-line beat. Union Pacific Corp (UNP) beat on EPS. Ally Financial (ALLY) posted a big bottom line beat. Blackstone Group Inc (BX) beat on revenue. East West Bancorp (EWBC) posted a decent revenue beat. TSMC (TSM) posted strong revenue growth. Notable stocks down after posting disappointing earnings; Netflix (NFLX) missed new subscriber expectations with US subscribers declining for first time since late 2011. Analysts blamed the miss on a weaker Q2 content slate, although, desks also flagged price-related churn. UnitedHealth (UNH) fell after the CEO hinted that the co. could miss revenue guidance for FY19; adj. revenue now guided at or slightly below USD 233bln-235bln (exp. USD 244bln). United Rentals (URI) lowered guidance. Alliance Data (ADS) missed on top and bottom lines. Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI) revised lower EPS view. Genuine Parts (GPC) missed on top and bottom lines. Kinder Morgan (KMI) posted a large revenue miss. M&amp;T Bank Corp. (MTB) posted an EPS miss. Snap-On Inc (SNA) posted slight revenue miss. United Rentals, Inc. (URI) lowered/narrowed FY top and bottom-line guidance. Crown Holdings Inc (CCK) lowered EPS view. Sonoco Products Co. (SON) missed on top and bottom lines. Watsco (WSO) also missed on top and bottom lines. The Communications Services sector was under pressure as Netflix (NFLX) sunk after a poor earnings release. United Health Group Inc. (UNH) reversed premarket gains to move lower after the CEO hinted that revenue may miss guidance. Apple (AAPL) moved higher after being upgraded at Raymond James, who have high hopes for 5G iPhone sales. Facebook (FB) was under pressure after reports of scepticism towards the co.’s Libra cryptocurrency project from G7 ministers. Micron (MU) moved higher after Barclays and BAML raised their target prices for the co. Qualcomm (QCOM) fell after the co. was fined by the EU for abusing its market power. In similar but unrelated news, Alphabet (GOOG) shares were also under pressure after the co. was fined by the Russian government for not agreeing to filter traffic. Amarin Corp (AMRN) fell after the co. announced a USD 400mln stock deal to fund a heart drug. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell after Mizuho cut its rating on the co., citing limited upside in H2. T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) both sunk after reports emerged that the DoJ may block the merger. Tiffany &amp; Co (TIF) fell after Wells Fargo cut its profit target for the co. Circor International (CIR) shares jumped higher after the co. reached a deal to sell one of its loss-making units. S&amp;P 500 0.4% at 2995, NASDAQ-100 0.2% at 7904, Dow Jones 0% at 27223.</p><p>Treasuries reversed earlier losses in a late session rally, induced by dovish Fed speak and geopolitics. The T-plex had been gradually drifting lower throughout the Asian and European session before more selling was initiated after a strong Philly Fed index, assisted by a 13k+ block sale in the TYU9. However, the selling bottomed out going into the European equity close and losses began gradually paring back. A mixed 10-year TIPS auction didn’t buck the trend, tailing 1.8bps with a 2.45x B/C (prev. 2.99x), but had a decent takedown with indirects taking 64.3%. The tailwinds accelerated just prior to settlement as Fed’s Williams (voter) announced the need to provide accommodation, not leaving any uncertainty. At settlement the curve had bull flattened, with the 2s10s widening over 3bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 9 ticks higher at 127-20+.</p>",

The dovish Fed speak saw both equities and Treasuries rally in tandem. Geopolitical tensions also remain at the forefront: The US took 'defensive action' against an Iranian drone, keeping tensions high; earlier it was reported Iran offered a deal to the US in return for lifting sanctions; however, crude markets still traded lower on the day. The US held a call with China earlier, with traders watching for signs of progress that would lead to a face-to-face meeting in Beijing; however, Mnuchin said there had been no change in US policy as yet; more details are awaited.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed’s Williams (Voter) </strong>surprised the market with an extra dovish rendition; he said it is better to take preventative measures on rates than to wait for a disaster to unfold; the long-run neutral rate for US interest rates is 0.5%. On policy, Williams said policy makers must move more quickly to vaccinate the economy and add monetary stimulus when rates are close to zero and that lower-for-longer rates foster good financial conditions, allow stimulus to pick up steam and inflation to rise. He also added that says standard inflation targeting approach may anchor inflation expectations too low and that research shows that when neutral rates are low, you should not \"keep your powder dry\". However, he did caveat that lower for longer rates brings risks of asset price bubbles and excessive credit creation. On inflation, Williams commented that promising temporarily higher inflation after rates touch zero can offset nearly all of the negative effects of low rates and that if inflation gets stuck below the goal, expectations may push inflation lower, and reduce Fed's effectiveness. Williams’ comments triggered a classic dovish reaction; stocks and treasuries advanced whilst DXY fell, and money market pricing for July shifted to price a 66.9% chance of a 50bps rate cut. Fed's Clarida (Voter) said on FBN that the US economy is in a good place, but uncertainties have increased, and he noted inflation has been coming in soft and that you don't want to wait until the data turns decisively, showing a similar rhetoric to Williams.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Overnight, a WSJ report claimed US/China<strong> </strong>trade talks are stalling over US Huawei restrictions. US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin walked back on these claims in an early interview on CNBC, saying he and USTR Lighthizer would later have call with the Chinese and denied Huawei was a sticking point. However, commentary from the China’s Global Times publication (widely thought of as a “mouth-piece” of the Chinese State) claimed that trade talks face difficulties as “differences persist” and US officials continue to use \"bullying tactics\" by threatening more tariffs. Elsewhere,<strong> </strong>Japanese trade data showed a greater than expected fall in exports, adding to mounting evidence of a slowdown in global trade.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>US President Trump announced that the US took defensive action against an Iranian drone and destroyed it after it refused to stand down as it approached the USS Boxer; in an attack that echoes the downing of the US drone previously. A Pentagon official said earlier on Thursday that the US is not forming a military coalition against Iran, although does want a multinational maritime push to “shine a light” on the Persian Gulf to deter attacks, caveating that this won’t happen overnight and may take months. The official added that the US has received signs of interest to escort ships through the Strait of Hormuz. There were some dovish reports on the Iranian side earlier too, where the Guardian reported that it had made a 'substantial' nuclear offer in return for the US lifting sanctions, but the article notes this was likely to be a non-starter in Washington. Iranian President Rouhani said in a phone call with French President Macron that Iran is determined to leave all doors open to save the nuclear deal. Separately in the earlier session, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard announced that they had stopped a foreign oil tanker in the Straight of Hormuz’s Larak Island, accusing it of fuel smuggling (the same tanker that they had previously said they escorted for repairs).</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Source reports today revealed that ECB staff have begun studying a potential revamp of its inflation goal, which could be akin to price level targeting. Such a move could facilitate easing for longer. The report said that staff are questioning the appropriateness of the current inflation target mandate, which targets inflation at 'below, but close to 2%'. Note: ECB President Draghi, who is known to favour \"symmetrical\" target (which would greater flexibility to allow inflation to be either above or below a specific 2% goal; this would allow the ECB to keep inflation above 2% for a while to re-anchor inflation expectations). The report saw the 5Y5Y inflation swap forward increase to 1.3%, for the first time in almost a month (this is the ECB’s preferred gauge for inflation expectations).</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The Burt-Benn amendment, which makes it more difficult to implement a no deal Brexit through prorogation, was passed by a margin of 315 to 274, essentially making it more difficult for any future prime minister to walk the UK into a no deal Brexit without the backing of parliament. In an interview conducted back in May, but aired on Wednesday evening, EU Brexit negotiator Barnier signalled that the EU may be willing to consider alternatives to the Irish backstop plan (an arrangement that has been rejected by both PM candidates); Barnier also reiterated that the only way for the UK to leave EU in an orderly manner was Theresa May’s deal (which Boris Johnson, the bookies favourite to win the PM job, has already declared as ‘dead’). Elsewhere, The UK OBR said that the UK will fall into a recession in the event of a no deal Brexit, warning of a GBP 30bln hit to the economy. OxEco find this to be slightly pessimistic, due to the high estimates of some trade barriers and a cautious view of the likely policy response but they do not rule out the serious economic challenges which would arise in the event of a no deal Brexit. Later in the session EC President Von Der Leyen reiterated her view that if the UK offer reasonable grounds for a Brexit extension, she will happily listen.</p><p><strong>* US PHILLY FED INDEX:</strong> The Philly Fed index surged back to 21.8 in July (exp. 5.0), up from 0.3 in June (a figure which was largely dismissed due to the survey being conducted in the week the US was mulling Mexico sanctions). Pantheon Macroeconomics comments that the “gratifying” rebound doesn’t ensure a rebound in the ISM index but does increase the likelihood. The consultancy notes the strong readings across the board for the sub-indices, caveating that they would be surprised for this to continue, given the survey’s volatile nature, but nonetheless it is promising given the disappointing H1 for the index. PM go as far to say that given the string of promising data recently, low rates aren’t needed, “and that a 50bp easing on 7/31 would be a mistake.”</p><p><strong>* SARB REVIEW: </strong>As expected, the SARB cut rates by 25bps to 6.5%. However, a more hawkish than expected the SARB emphasised that it wanted CPI to stay at 4.5% (in the middle of the target range) and warned that upside risks to inflation may still be significant (which some desks took as a warning over the possibility of a ZAR sell off on Eskom, fiscal, or credit rating related risks). Moreover, Gov. Kganyago added that the MPC did not even discuss a 50bp rate move, rather just a 25bps cut with a pause, with any further moves to be data dependent. Prior to the meeting, markets had been pricing a further 25bps by the year end, with some analysts even calling for a 50bps or higher move this meeting; as such, ZAR strengthened. Given the SARB’s current inflation outlook and preference for mid-target CPI, IFI analysts do not see the SARB cutting rates again in 2019 (or in 2020), unless there is another reduction in the inflation outlook.</p><p><strong>* BANK OF KOREA: </strong>The BOK cut rates by 25bps to 1.50%, with one dissenter, calling for rates to be left unchanged. The move was expected, although the timing will have been a surprise to at least half of analysts surveyed. The statement was dovish, and central bank cut its growth and inflation projections. The BOK also added Japan trade to its list of risks, after Japan slapped trade restrictions on South Korean semis. Looking ahead, there could be further easing on the way, after Governor Lee said that rates had not hit the ‘effective lower bound’. SocGen’s analysts now expect two more policy rate cuts, one in 4Q19 and the other in 1Q20, arguing that the August meeting might be too soon, especially since the Governor did not guide on any imminent adjustments. Capital Economics also believe further easing is likely, and note that the looser policy plus a turnaround in the tech sector should help support growth, but highlight the weak global growth is to hamper exports.</p><p><strong>* TURKEY:</strong> US President Trump said he was not looking at sanctions on Turkey at the minute following its purchases of the Russian air defence system, although just 45 minutes later, he said that the US is looking at Turkey sanctions but has not yet made a decision.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLE 9 TICKS HIGHER AT 127-20+: </strong>Treasuries reversed earlier losses in a late session rally, induced by dovish Fed speak and geopolitics. The T-plex had been gradually drifting lower throughout the Asian and European session before more selling was initiated after a strong Philly Fed index, assisted by a 13k+ block sale in the TYU9. However, the selling bottomed out going into the European equity close and losses began gradually paring back. A mixed 10-year TIPS auction didn’t buck the trend, tailing 1.8bps with a 2.45x B/C (prev. 2.99x), but had a decent takedown with indirects taking 64.3%. The tailwinds accelerated just prior to settlement as Fed’s Williams (voter) announced the need to provide accommodation, not leaving any uncertainty. At settlement the curve had bull flattened, with the 2s10s widening over 3bps.</p><p><strong>* WTI (U9) SETTLES USD 1.50 LOWER AT USD 55.42/BBL; BRENT (U9) SETTLES USD 1.73 LOWER AT USD 61.93/BBL: </strong>Crude futures had been finding some (modest) support in the early session before reversing course for a third day of losses. Prices were firmer earlier amid Iran Revolutionary Guards claiming they had seized the foreign tanker previously reported as missing, but gains were lacklustre and as the US session progressed crude benchmarks gave way to the downside. Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak said that production will rise in the second half of July to the OPEC+ agreed levels, coming as the disruption from the contaminated oil dissipates. Citigroup’s energy analysts note that the market is dipping lower as the Gulf of Mexico comes back to production (currently only 19% is left to come back online) in comparison to what it gained when production was shutting down, “reinforcing the current bearish sentiment.” However just before settlement, geopolitical tensions were eased slightly as the Pentagon said the US is not forming a military coalition against Iran, and reports in the Guardian stated Iran has made a 'substantial' nuclear offer in return for US lifting sanctions, but is unlikely to be warmed by the Trump administration. However, as Trump announced the US shot down an Iranian drone some losses were pared.</p><p>* <strong>S&amp;P 500 0.4% at 2995, NASDAQ-100 0.2% at 7904, Dow Jones 0% at 27223, SECTORS; </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary -0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples 0.8%, S&amp;P 500 Energy 0%, S&amp;P 500 Financials 0.8%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care 0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials 0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology 0.8%, S&amp;P 500 Materials 0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.9%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities 0.8%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Notable<strong> </strong>stocks<strong> </strong>up after posting stronger than expected earnings; <strong>Morgan Stanley (MS) </strong>beat on top and bottom lines, solid IB revenue (mixed in other divisions). <strong>International Business Machines (IBM)</strong> reported mixed results; EPS beat whilst revenue was a little weak, however, the co. reported decent gains in its Cloud and Cognitive Solutions division. eBay Inc. (EBAY) beat on top and bottom lines. Danaher Corp. (DHR) beat on top and bottom lines. Honeywell Int'l Inc. (HON) raised EPS and revenue growth guidance.

Ally Financial (ALLY) posted a big bottom line beat. Blackstone Group Inc (BX) beat on revenue. East West Bancorp (EWBC) posted a decent revenue beat. TSMC (TSM) posted strong revenue growth. Notable<strong> </strong>stocks<strong> </strong>down after posting disappointing earnings; <strong>Netflix (NFLX) </strong>missed new subscriber expectations with US subscribers declining for first time since late 2011. Analysts blamed the miss on a weaker Q2 content slate, although, desks also flagged price-related churn. <strong>UnitedHealth (UNH)</strong> fell after the CEO hinted that the co. could miss revenue guidance for FY19; adj. revenue now guided at or slightly below USD 233bln-235bln (exp. USD 244bln). United Rentals (URI) lowered guidance. Alliance Data (ADS) missed on top and bottom lines. Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI) revised lower EPS view.

United Rentals, Inc. (URI) lowered/narrowed FY top and bottom-line guidance. Crown Holdings Inc (CCK) lowered EPS view. Sonoco Products Co. (SON) missed on top and bottom lines. Watsco (WSO) also missed on top and bottom lines.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>The Communications Services sector was under pressure as Netflix (NFLX) sunk after a poor earnings release. United Health Group Inc. (UNH) reversed premarket gains to move lower after the CEO hinted that revenue may miss guidance. Apple (AAPL) moved higher after being upgraded at Raymond James, who have high hopes for 5G iPhone sales. Facebook (FB) was under pressure after reports of scepticism towards the co.’s Libra cryptocurrency project from G7 ministers. Micron (MU) moved higher after Barclays and BAML raised their target prices for the co. Qualcomm (QCOM) fell after the co. was fined by the EU for abusing its market power. In similar but unrelated news, Alphabet (GOOG) shares were also under pressure after the co. was fined by the Russian government for not agreeing to filter traffic. Amarin Corp (AMRN) fell after the co. announced a USD 400mln stock deal to fund a heart drug. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell after Mizuho cut its rating on the co., citing limited upside in H2. T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) both sunk after reports emerged that the DoJ may block the merger. Tiffany &amp; Co (TIF) fell after Wells Fargo cut its profit target for the co. Circor International (CIR) shares jumped higher after the co. reached a deal to sell one of its loss-making units.</p><p><strong>* ITALIAN TENSIONS:&nbsp;</strong>Analysts at ING are keeping an eye for any escalation in tensions within the government coalition, after the Five Star voted for new EC president Von Der Leyen, but The League did not. It is another sign that the already faltering coalition may soon break down, ING warns, adding that at this stage, it is fair to assume that markets should prepare for more Italy-induced volatility in rates and FX markets; \"Along with a dovish ECB, this may be a temper EURUSD upside in the coming months. As if on cue, 5Star leader &amp; Deputy PM Di Maio this morning said that the government cannot carry on if the League keeps threatening constant crises. Later, League leader &amp; Deputy PM Salvini said that if the continuing with the current government no longer makes sense then there should be election, but also added that he does not see the government changing at the moment.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> was under pressure, falling back beneath its 200dma, after dovish comments from Fed’s Williams. <strong>XAU</strong> subsequently caught a bid, moving to six-year highs. In the same vein, <strong>JPY</strong>, which had been firmer overnight on poor Japanese trade data, rallied; USDJPY, which had been as high as 108.00 on the day, moved as low as 107.30. <strong>EUR</strong> which had taken a hit after dovish ECB sources reports, pared losses on the weakening buck; EURUSD, which had come close to testing 1.1200, moved as high as 1.1280. <strong>GBP </strong>was the outperformer;<strong> </strong>surging on a combination of the weakening buck and increased optimism that parliament would be able to act to prevent a no deal Brexit. Next best was<strong> AUD,</strong> which was supported by a strong jobs report, which cooled RBA easing expectations. <strong>CAD</strong>, although stronger vs the buck, underperformed its G10 counterparts as the crude complex sunk. <strong>EMFX</strong> was firmer as the buck faded; <strong>ZAR</strong> strengthened in the aftermath of the SARB’s 0.25% rate cut; accompanying statement and inflation forecasts raised doubts about future easing. <strong>TRY</strong> shot higher on US President Trump comments that he was not considering sanction on the country, allaying fears, dropping to around 5.6000 from 5.7000 (reminder: Turkey were last night dropped from the US’s F-35 programme), while <strong>BRL</strong> and <strong>MXN</strong> also rallied.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> Lacklustre corporate earnings has also been cited as one of the factors keeping the buck on the defensive, despite the hattrick of data surprises of late (NFP beat, core CPI firm, retail sales solid), DXY did not manage to rise above 97.50, which technicians say would have challenged the ‘weak USD’ thesis.</p><p><strong>* CAD:</strong> The decline in oil prices is offsetting the support provided by USD weakness. The BOC retained a neutral bias at its recent policy meeting, and the FOMC is expected to cut rates later this month; while the CAD has benefited from this dynamic, desks warn that a soft risk environment (geopolitics, trade tensions, lacklustre corporate earnings in the US thus far) could make CAD trading a function of the overall macro environment.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Has risen above its 100dma after the latest jobs data, where the performance of full-time jobs gains was encouraging. Money markets’ expectations of RBA easing cooled after the data (still expect around 18bps of easing through to the end of the year). Given the labour market is a key input into the RBA’s policymaking, some are now expecting the Bank to be in wait and see mode, assessing how further data comes in, given some unclear signals within labour market data. Technicians will be focusing on the 200dma above us.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> The yen is back beneath 108 vs the USD; trade data overnight highlighted the negative impact of global trade wars, with both imports and exports missing expectations (at -5.2% and -6.7% Y/Y respectively). Further yen strength will do little to ease the situation, so some desks are on the look out for FX warnings from Japanese policymakers. Trade tensions, geopolitics (and general softness in risk assets) is also supporting the JPY. Technicians note that the failure to top 108.50/80, and then the fall back below 108.00 are bearish developments; rate differentials and overall risk sentiment will be the influencing factors.</p>",

Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak said that production will rise in the second half of July to the OPEC+ agreed levels, coming as the disruption from the contaminated oil dissipates. Citigroup’s energy analysts note that the market is dipping lower as the Gulf of Mexico comes back to production (currently only 19% is left to come back online) in comparison to what it gained when production was shutting down, “reinforcing the current bearish sentiment.”</p>",

The index was threatening to extend Wednesday’s post-US housing data declines through 97.000 before bouncing relatively firmly within 97.044-268 parameters and remained resilient when the roller-coaster ride of conflicting pre-FOMC macro inputs continued with a hefty LEI miss.</p><p><strong>AUD/GBP</strong></p><p>Vying for top spot in the major league all day, and both due to encouraging data (Aussie jobs and UK retail sales) in part. Aud/Usd inched closer to 0.7050 again after crossing back over 0.7000 and breaching the 100 DMA (0.7018), while Cable got to within a few pips of 1.2500 after sliding to a new 2019 low under 1.2400 only yesterday. Note, the Pound also derived momentum through 1.2450 and a Fib retracement level circa 1.2458, but did not extend gains after Parliament passed a preventative prorogue motion to hinder any attempt to push a no deal Brexit through by the new PM, suggesting some buy rumour/sell fact positioning.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi touched 0.6750 vs the Buck, but lagged its Antipodean counterpart after the aforementioned labour report as Aud/Nzd held above 1.0400, albeit just between 1.0403-45 boundaries, but the Loonie lagged alongside a deeper reversal in crude prices, with Usd/Cad back up towards 1.3100 where large offers sit having tested similarly substantial bids touted at 1.3000 recently. Note, a healthy looking 30.4k rise in Canadian ADP payrolls was largely shrugged aside, perhaps due to the usual time lag vs the official jobs release.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR</strong></p><p>The Yen staved off pressure around 108.00 vs the Greenback to retain the bulk of its safe-haven gains with the aid of more option expiry interest (2 bn up to 108.50) and with Japanese trade data showing a bigger decline in exports to compound concerns about the country’s spat with South Korea, plus global tariff tensions more generally. Similarly, the single currency survived another attempt to snuff out bids at 1.1200 against the Buck in wake of sourced reports suggesting that ECB staff may be looking at an inflation mandate revamp that would allow monetary accommodation to last even longer. However, Eur/Usd upside was capped below 1.1250 amidst a myriad of option expiries spanning 1.1190-1.1275 (circa 7 bn in total).</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A trio of regional Central Banks (BoK, BI and SARB) all cut rates by 25 bp, but not all in line with expectations or at least an overwhelming consensus. However, the Rand strengthened after a widely tipped ¼ point SA ease as the accompanying statement and inflation forecasts raised doubts about the model flagging a further reduction before the end of 2019. Indeed, Usd/Zar retreated sharply from around 14.0380 to almost 13.8800, while Usd/Krw and Usd/Idr traded somewhat mixed near 1175.50 and 13955 respectively.</p>",

Furthermore, the IT sector could also be feeling some pressure amid comments from TSMC post-earnings as the chip-giant expects a global semiconductor contraction this year. On the flip side, healthcare names (+1.5%) outperform as pharma heavyweight Novartis (+5.0%) rose to the top of the Stoxx 600 amid guidance upgrades in which FY 19 operating guidance was raised to “double digits to mid-teens” from “high single digits” and net sales guidance is now expected to be in the “mid to high single digits” compared to a prior view of “mid-single digits”.&nbsp; Subsequently, shares in Roche (+1.3%) moved higher in tandem and thus Switzerland’s SMI (+0.9%) outperforms vs. its EU peers. In terms of individual movers, Germany’s Hochtief (-9.8%) fell to the foot of the pan-European index as its Asia-Pac division reported a decline in revenues, whilst easyJet (+4.8%) and Ubisoft shares are supported on the back of earnings. Looking ahead, British American Tobacco (+3.9%) and Imperial Brands (+1.2%) are awaiting numbers from US competitor Philip Morris.</p><p>UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH) reported Q2 19 (USD): Adj EPS 3.60 (exp. 3.45), Revenue 60.6bln (exp. 60.58bln); raises EPS guidance. (Newswires) shares +0.2% pre-market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP</strong> - The Pound had already extended its rebound from midweek lows (and a fresh sub-1.2400 ytd trough vs the Usd) on a combination of positive sounding EU remarks about the Irish backstop, technical buying and short covering, but got an additional boost via UK retail sales data that confounded expectations for a 3rd consecutive monthly decline in consumption. For the record, the ONS reported a 1% rise in sales vs consensus for a 0.3% fall on the back of non-food items and 2nd hand goods, and Cable climbed towards 1.2500 in response, while Eur/Gbp retreated further from circa 0.9050 at one stage on Wednesday to 0.9000 before Sterling momentum waned somewhat ahead of a vote in Parliament on a bill to prevent its suspension and force through no Brexit deal.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong> - The Aussie is the current G10 outperformer, and also partly due to bullish macro news, albeit not quite so apparent from the headline Aussie payrolls tally released overnight. However, internals were encouraging as permanent placements rose 21.1k (vs +10k forecast for full and part-time jobs combined) and underemployment eased. Aud/Usd subsequently reclaimed the 0.7000 handle and is back above the 100 DMA (0.7018) eyeing this week’s prior high just shy of 0.7050, but still below 1.0450 against the Kiwi that is benefiting from ongoing Greenback weakness. Indeed, Nzd/Usd is holding firm within a 0.6730-46 range as the DXY only just keeps its head above 97.000 following yesterday’s US housing data misses.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR</strong> - The Yen and Franc are back in demand on safe-haven grounds as US-China trade angst intensifies after the latest stall in negotiations on Huawei concessions, with Usd/Jpy down through 108.00 and seemingly capped ahead of more decent option expiries at or above the big figure (1.5 bn up to 108.15 and 1 bn from 108.30 to 108.50). Similarly, Usd/Chf has pulled back from around 0.9900 and Eur/Chf is under 1.1100 even though the single currency remains heavy on attempts to clear 1.1250 vs the Dollar and embroiled in tightly stacked expiries. Indeed, some 7 bn roll off between 1.1190 and 1.1275, as Eur/Usd breaks below a tight range to retest 1.1200 amidst reports that the ECB staff are looking at a revision to the inflation target.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Rand is also in a bind vs the Buck, with Usd/Zar straddling 14.0000 ahead of the SARB policy verdict that is expected to deliver a 25 bp cut in line with BoK and BI moves in the run up.</p><p>Notable Option Expiries - EUR/USD: <strong>1.1190-1.1200 (1.1BLN), 1.1215-30 (2BLN), 1.1235 (2BLN), 1.1245-50 (1BLN), 1.1260 -75 (1BLN</strong>), 1.1310 (501M)</p><p>- USD/JPY: <strong>108.00-15 (1.4BLN), 108.30-50 (1BLN)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It’s becoming a recurring theme and pattern as the debt market recovery rally continues, with buyers pausing for breath ahead of the US open, but also acknowledging fundamental and technical impulses, like the unexpected UK retail excesses. However, <strong>Gilts</strong> only slipped to a slender Liffe session low at 131.25 in a token gesture and <strong>Bunds</strong> were only marginally down in sympathy before latest geopolitical headline broke and both EU benchmarks picked up the bit again. Indeed, the 10 German bond just posted a fresh Eurex peak at 173.54 (through 173.46) amidst wire reports that the ECB may be mulling a change to its price mandate) and its UK peer has rebounded to 131.52 in kind. Nevertheless, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> remain muted and the curve steady vs more pronounced bull-flattening at one stage overnight into weekly claims, Philly Fed, LEI and 10 year TIPS supply, with Fed’s Bostic and Williams also on tap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are marginally firmer following yesterday’s decline in the complex with prices currently above 57/bbl and 64/bbl respectively. Comments from Iranian Revolutionary Guard aided the benchmarks climb over the round figures, which stated they have stopped a foreign oil tanker in Lark Island in the Gulf. On the OPEC+ front, Russia’s Energy Minister acknowledged that Russian production will be increased to levels agreed in the accord. Meanwhile, <strong>gold</strong> prices are marginally softer and little influenced by the declining Buck as investors lock in profits following the yellow metal’s recent surge. Elsewhere, <strong>copper</strong> prices are little changed above the 2.7/lb whilst <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> continued to decline as market participants reassess the base metal’s outlook given the rising shipments to China from Australia coupled with the Dalian Commodity Exchange’s higher transaction fees in all iron ore futures contracts.</p><p><strong>Iran Revolutionary Guard say they have stopped a foreign oil tanker in Lark Island in the Gulf, according to local TV.

However, Gilts only slipped to a slender Liffe session low at 131.25 in a token gesture and Bunds were only marginally down in sympathy before latest geopolitical headline broke and both EU benchmarks picked up the bit again. Indeed, the 10 German bond just posted a fresh Eurex peak at 173.54 (through 173.46) amidst wire reports that the ECB may be mulling a change to its price mandate) and its UK peer has rebounded to 131.52 in kind. Nevertheless, US Treasuries remain muted and the curve steady vs more pronounced bull-flattening at one stage overnight into weekly claims, Philly Fed, LEI and 10 year TIPS supply, with Fed’s Bostic and Williams also on tap.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound had already extended its rebound from midweek lows (and a fresh sub-1.2400 ytd trough vs the Usd) on a combination of positive sounding EU remarks about the Irish backstop, technical buying and short covering, but got an additional boost via UK retail sales data that confounded expectations for a 3rd consecutive monthly decline in consumption. For the record, the ONS reported a 1% rise in sales vs consensus for a 0.3% fall on the back of non-food items and 2nd hand goods, and Cable climbed towards 1.2500 in response, while Eur/Gbp retreated further from circa 0.9050 at one stage on Wednesday to 0.9000 before Sterling momentum waned somewhat ahead of a vote in Parliament on a bill to prevent its suspension and force through no Brexit deal.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie is the current G10 outperformer, and also partly due to bullish macro news, albeit not quite so apparent from the headline Aussie payrolls tally released overnight. However, internals were encouraging as permanent placements rose 21.1k (vs +10k forecast for full and part-time jobs combined) and underemployment eased. Aud/Usd subsequently reclaimed the 0.7000 handle and is back above the 100 DMA (0.7018) eyeing this week’s prior high just shy of 0.7050, but still below 1.0450 against the Kiwi that is benefiting from ongoing Greenback weakness. Indeed, Nzd/Usd is holding firm within a 0.6730-46 range as the <strong>DXY</strong> only just keeps its head above 97.000 following yesterday’s US housing data misses.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Yen and Franc are back in demand on safe-haven grounds as US-China trade angst intensifies after the latest stall in negotiations on Huawei concessions, with Usd/Jpy down through 108.00 and seemingly capped ahead of more decent option expiries at or above the big figure (1.5 bn up to 108.15 and 1 bn from 108.30 to 108.50). Similarly, Usd/Chf has pulled back from around 0.9900 and Eur/Chf is under 1.1100 even though the single currency remains heavy on attempts to clear 1.1250 vs the Dollar and embroiled in tightly stacked expiries. Indeed, some 7 bn roll off between 1.1190 and 1.1275, as Eur/Usd meanders between 1.1245-25.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Rand is also in a bind vs the Buck, with Usd/Zar straddling 14.0000 ahead of the SARB policy verdict that is expected to deliver a 25 bp cut in line with BoK and BI moves in the run up.</p>",

BoK Governor Lee said the decision was not unanimous as board member Lee Il-Houng dissented and that they have some policy room left, while the BoK also downgraded 2019 South Korean growth forecast to 2.2% from 2.5% and 2019 inflation forecast to 0.7% from 1.1%.

(Times)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>The <strong>greenback</strong> traded subdued overnight as it took a breather from recent gains and amid declines in US yields, which its major counterparts only marginally benefitted from as <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was contained by a cluster of option expiries at 1.1215-1.1235 and although <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> has recovered from the prior day’s brief slip to below the 1.2400 handle, ongoing Brexit uncertainty has limited the upside. Elsewhere, <strong>KRW</strong> was only briefly pressured by the surprise rate cut by the BoK, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was subdued by the downbeat risk tone and antipodeans were mixed with outperformance in <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> which benefitted from a surge in Full-Time jobs despite headline Employment Change missing estimates and the Unemployment Rate remaining at 5.2%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Australian Employment (Jun) 0.5k vs. Exp. 10.0k (Prev. 42.3k).

The report did little to halt the slide in oil prices which some attributed to stockpiles in total being net bearish as crude and products combined were at a build, while the risk averse tone and more constructive reports regarding Iran added to the tipping factors. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was steady with only a mild pullback seen from resistance at USD 1430/oz and <strong>copper</strong> prices reflected the broad downbeat sentiment overnight. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>US President Trump is reportedly to allow Senator Paul to open the backchannel with Iran representatives, while there were separate comments Iran’s Foreign Minister Zarif that US travel restrictions on Iranian diplomats in New York are basically inhuman and are not a friendly action. Furthermore, Zarif said Iran could close the Strait of Hormuz but does not want to and that the British seizure of its tanker is \"piracy\", while he added Iran is not going to build nuclear weapons. (Newswires/Politico)</p><p><strong>US is to suspend and begin the process to formally remove Turkey from the F-35 programme according to the Pentagon</strong>, while Turkey urged the US to correct mistake of removing it from the F-35 program which it says will irreparably damage relations according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The T-Plex traded choppy out of Asia and into the European session before marching higher as US traders came to their desks. Risk sentiment was hampered heading into the US session as equity index futures headed south, while the T-Note was also taking cues from EGBs. Some desks attributed the upside in Treasury in pre-market to comments from ECB’s Coeure, who again said that the bank was ready to act if needed, likely providing some tailwinds; shortly afterwards, US June Housing Starts and Building Permits data missed expectations widely, adding to the Treasury bid. Bank of America’s disappointing on its NIM, just as some other major banks have, further cemented the ominous outlook for financials (which has been a drag on the SPX today), in addition to some disappointing earnings from CSX helped accelerate the risk sell-off. A ho-hum Fed Beige Book failed to move the dial, and at settlement the curve had bull flattened, with 2s10s narrowing by just under 3bps, as the 2-year yield fell by around 2bps, whilst the 10-year yields eased by around 5bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 14 ticks higher at 127-11+.</p><p><strong>Fed Beige Book stated activity is expanding at a ‘moderate pace’ which is little changed from prior period and that the outlook is generally positive over coming months despite trade related uncertainty</strong>. The Beige Book added that compensation grew at a modest pace in which some contacts reported significant increases in entry level wages although the rate of price inflation was ‘stable to down slightly’, while some saw delayed business investment and labour markets remained tight with contacts across the country experiencing difficulties filling open positions. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's George (Voter, Hawkish)</strong> said downside risks to the economy come from trade uncertainty as well as slowing global growth, and that she is prepared to adjust her view of monetary policy should downside risks materialise. Furthermore, George said the natural rate of unemployment might be lower and the labour market is not generating much pricing pressure, while she added that she is prepared to be flexible but doesn’t yet see the case for a cut in interest rates later this month. (Newswires/WSJ)</p><p><strong>US House voted to table the impeachment resolution against President Trump which effectively kills the measure for now.</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>US House Speaker Pelosi reportedly would like to see a deal by the end of the week if Congress is going to pass a spending a debt limit package before the August recess. (Politico)</p><p>Senior US Democratic Lawmaker said the Democrats have made constructive proposals on the USMCA trade deal following the meeting with USTR Lighthizer but are still awaiting response from Lighthizer.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are negative as the risk averse tone rolls over from Wall St where all major indices declined for a 2nd consecutive day amid mixed earnings, in which the S&amp;P 500 gave back the 3k level and with futures pressured after-market following disappointing Netflix results which missed on revenue as well as global subscriber growth and posted its first ever decline in net US subscribers. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.6%) are lower with the energy sector leading the declines in Australia after further pressure in oil prices and reduced quarterly revenue updates from Santos and Woodside Petroleum, while the Japanese benchmark underperforms from a double whammy of a stronger currency and wider then expected decline in Exports. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) are dragged lower by weakness in the blue-chip oil names and amid ongoing trade uncertainty with US-China talks said to have stalled as the Trump administration determines how to respond to Beijing’s demands of easing restrictions on Huawei.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback is subdued overnight as it takes a breather from recent gains and amid declines in yields, which its major counterparts have only marginally benefitted from as EUR/USD is contained by a cluster of option expiries at 1.1215-1.1235 and although GBP/USD has recovered from the prior day’s brief slip to below the 1.2400 handle, ongoing Brexit uncertainty has restricted further upside. In terms of the latest developments, UK House of Lords backed an attempt to prevent the next PM from shutting down Parliament in order to force a no-deal which is said to pave the way for a major showdown at the Commons today and with some Cabinet Ministers to potentially step down to vote in favour of the amendment to the Northern Ireland Bill, while there were also comments from PM candidate Johnson which suggested an attempt to prorogue parliament prior to the Brexit deadline cannot be dismissed. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is subdued by the downbeat risk tone and antipodeans are mixed with outperformance in AUD/USD despite varied jobs data in which Employment Change missed estimates at 500 vs. Exp. 10k and Unemployment Rate remained at 5.2%, as Full-Time jobs surged by 21.1k.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track the upside in T-notes and with prices also underpinned by safe-haven demand.&nbsp;</p>",
