        "content": "<p><strong>CORONAVIRUS UPDATE / RESPONSES</strong></p><p>US CDC said COVID-19 cases rose to 140,904 (prev. 122,653, +15%) and the death toll increased to 2,405 (prev. 2,112). In other news a US Senior Treasury official said the IRS has started to process the direct payments to eligible Americans which will begin being deposited on April 17th, while it was also reported that the US Congress was looking at additional measures it could take with House Democrats discussing increasing payments to low and middle-income earners. (Newswires/Fox Business News)</p><p>Italy COVID-19 cases rose to 101,739 (prev. 97,689) and death toll increased to 11,591 (prev. 10,779). There were also reports the Italian government will be extending lockdown measures until \"Easter April 12th\" according to the Health Minister. (Newswires)</p><p>UK COVID-19 cases rose to 22,141 (prev. 19,522) and death toll rose to 1,408 (prev. 1,228), while UK Chief Scientific Advisor believes UK is tracking along the same path as France and believes hospital admissions will worsen, but have no accelerated, rising by 1,000 per day. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>UK PM Johnson spokesman said Brexit transition period finishes at the end of this year and more continuous discussions are taking place rather than set round, while he is not aware of any imminent new lockdown measures. (Newswires)</p><p>Bank of England said it will continue to offer the contingent term repo facility (CTRF) weekly through April in which it will hold a 1-month term CTRF operation each week with the final operation for May 1st, while it added that it will continue to monitor conditions and is ready to take further action if need be. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Saudi Energy Ministry official stated that the Kingdom plans to increase crude oil exports from May by around 600k BPD to a total of 10.6mln BPD, with the increase in exports due to displacing crude with NatGas and a fall in local demand. (Newswires)</p><p>Russian President Putin and US President Trump agreed to hold talks in the oil market at a Ministerial level, according to the Kremlin. (Newswires)</p><p>Trafigura said oil demand could fall by over 30mln BPD in April, which if so, sees global crude storage hitting capacity after one month, while it expects global refinery cuts to reach 12-13mln BPD in a few weeks' time. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>US is expected to renew sanctions waivers allowing Russian, Chinese and European companies to continue non-proliferation work at Iranian nuclear sites, according to sources. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Fed's Bullard (non-voter, dove) said model estimate of unemployment could be between 10-42%, while he stated that pandemic relief will help Americans pay their bills and that interest rates will probably stay low for quite a while. Furthermore, Bullard stated the US is taking on more debt but at lower rates and that the US can carry about 10% more debt which is not ideal but the US can handle it. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Bostic (non-voter) said the Fed is looking to see in the coming weeks whether its existing programmes will prove adequate. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Stocks made gains to start the week, reversing some weakness from the European session. Stimulus via China (reverse repo rate cut), Australia (wage subsidies) and hints of Japan stimulus are welcome, though don’t lift the virus. US House speaker Pelosi is already discussing the fourth wave of support, though some Republicans have questioned the need at this stage; Treasury Sec. Mnuchin said the current bill should support Americans for 8-12 weeks. The oil market continues to diverge from stocks as the complex faces a supply glut with no horizon in sight and a drop off in demand. The Fed’s asset purchases continue to support the Treasury market, while corporate supply continues to set records, although lower rates didn’t dissuade USD strength. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) opened higher as it announced its new lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate which it looks to begin human clinical trials by September for. Abbott (ABT) surged after it received FDA approval for one of its COVID-19 tests which it will now ramp production for. Cruise liners (CCL, RCL, NCLH) failed to benefit from the equity rally, where the group failed to receive aid from the latest US stimulus bill. However, airlines (AAL, UAL, DAL) failed to enjoy the rally too, despite a significant portion of the bill provided for the industry, although they are yet to receive such. Energy stocks (XLE, XOP) were the sector “least” in the green as crude prices continued to make new lows. SPX +3.29% at 2,625, NDX +3.96% at 7,889, DJIA +3.19% at 22,327.</p><p>The TPLEX bull-steepened despite firmer risk appetite and corporate supply. The T-Note reached its highs not long after the US cash equity open as the Fed continued its ramped-up asset purchases, completing its belly purchases earlier on. However, another deluge of corporate supply to start the week, including Oracle (ORCL) with a USD 20bln 6-parter from the 5-year up to the 40-year maturity, weighed somewhat on duration in the latter part of the session; IFR noted there are at least 12 High Grade primary issuers on Monday for a week that looks set to break records again. Furthermore, the repo operations continue to see minimal demand with the GC rate still trading close to zero, while the reverse repo operation sees continued blockbuster demand, supporting the lack of collateral supply thesis and thus the bull-steepener on Monday. By settlement, 2s -3bps at 0.22%, 10s -6.5bps at 0.68%, 30s -3.5bps 1.30%; front-end bills have risen back into positive territory after moving into negative for the first time ever last week; 3-month USD Libor-OIS remains wide at 136bps. T-note (M0) futures settled 18 ticks higher at 138-26+.</p>",

The Fed’s asset purchases continue to support the Treasury market, while corporate supply continues to set records, although lower rates didn’t dissuade USD strength.</p><h2>CASE COUNT</h2><p><strong>WORLDWIDE CASES 772,025, DEATHS 37,019, RECOVERED 160,243.</strong></p><p>Figures provided as of Monday (via worldometer website) against Friday:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>US </strong>total cases 158,550 (prev. 100,037), death toll 2,938 (prev. 1,536).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ITALY </strong>total cases 101,739 (prev. 86,498), death toll 11,591 (prev. 9,134).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SPAIN </strong>total cases 85,195 (prev. 64,059), death toll 7,340 (prev. 4,934).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>CHINA </strong>total cases 81,470 (prev. 81,340), death toll 3,304 (prev. 3,292).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>GERMANY </strong>total cases 63,929 (prev. 50,178), death toll 560 (prev. 338).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>FRANCE </strong>total cases 44,550 (prev. 32,964), death toll 3,024 (prev. 1,995).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>UK </strong>total cases 22,141 (prev. 14,543), death toll 1,408 (prev. 759).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SWITZERLAND </strong>total cases 15,760 (prev. 12,928), death toll 348 (prev. 231).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NETHERLANDS </strong>total cases 11,750 (prev. 8,603), death toll 864 (prev. 546).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SOUTH KOREA </strong>total cases 9,661 (prev. 9,332), death toll 158 (prev. 139).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>CANADA </strong>total cases 7,297 (prev. 4,610), death toll 67 (prev. 53).</p><p><i>Note figures are provided via </i><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\"><i>worldometers</i></a><i> thus there may be some discrepancies on figures provided against those stated from individual states.</i></p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>US Senior Treasury official told FBN's Lawrence that the IRS has started to process the direct payments to eligible Americans, which will begin being deposited on April 17th. Treasury Sec. Mnuchin said earlier in the session that he believes the current package should last between two to three months, for which the Trump administration will return to Congress after to seek further stimulus. Note that House Speaker Pelosi has been calling for work on a new round of stimulus already. Meanwhile, Fox reports also suggested that Banks were scrambling to meet Friday’s deadline to provide loans to small businesses; follows Mnuchin announcing the programme would be ready by then.</p><p><strong>RESTRICTIONS: </strong>US President Trump announced to extend Federal guidelines on COVID-19 until April 30th and that he sees deaths peaking in 2 weeks, while he hopes the April 30th guidelines do not have to be extended further.<strong> </strong>Trump also tweeted that he was giving consideration to quarantine developing hot spots including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and that a decision will be made one way or another shortly. However, Trump later stated a quarantine will not be necessary and instead instructed the CDC to issue a strong travel warning in which it urged people in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential travel for 2 weeks.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>FED'S BULLARD</strong> (non-voter, dove) said interest rates will probably stay low for quite a while, noting the US is taking on more debt, but at lower rates; said the US can carry about 10% more debt and that it is not ideal, but the US can handle it. The St. Louis President said that model estimate of unemployment could be between 10-42%; firms have two ways to handle crisis: 1) shut down, and send people to the unemployment line, or 2) get loans from the relief aid, which helps businesses retain staff, allowing more seamless transition when the economy restarts.</p><p><strong>ECB'S DE GUINDOS</strong> said that the joint issuance of Euro bonds is an instrument to combat COVID-19, however, it is not the only one and not the most effective. Meanwhile, the spokesperson for <strong>European Commission President Von der Leyen</strong> inferred strongly that the fight to secure <strong>coronabonds</strong> is not worth it given passions involved and that's why her emphasis is on leveraging the EU budget, AFP reported.</p><p><strong>PBOC:</strong> China's central bank cut its rate on its 7-day reverse repos by 20bps to 2.20%, the largest move in around five-years, and the third reduction since November; it was also an unexpected move. No official explanation was provided for the move; PBOC advisor Ma Jun said the move was in consideration of Chinese companies returning to work, and the global virus situation causing a deterioration in the external economic environment, and Jun said that the PBOC still had ample room to cut the rate further. Some analysts also suggested that the move may be in coordination with the G20, which last week pledged to add USD 5trln in stimulus to support economies amid coronavirus, given China was the only major economy that had not yet implemented large-scale easing measures, and analysts also speculate that Chinese authorities might take similar action with regards to its medium-term lending facility (MLF) rate and Loan Prime Rate (LPR) later this month.</p><h2>REST OF WORLD</h2><p><strong>AUSSIE STIMULUS:</strong> Australia announced a wage subsidy worth AUD 130bln (around 6.5% of its annual GDP) which will be paid over a 6-month horizon. While the details are somewhat vague, the size of the support was larger than expected; Goldman Sachs estimated it would take the size of the Aussie stimulus to around 10% of GDP.</p><p><strong>JAPAN STIMULUS:</strong> Japan's ruling party has proposed a JPY 60trln stimulus package which could include direct government spending of around JPY 20trln. The proposals will be submitted to PM Abe on Tuesday. Japan will also ramp up government bond issuance by USD JPY 16trln to fund virus stimulus, sources said, with the maturity issuance will be increase excluding 40yr bonds, I/L and liquidity supplying bonds; 6-mth Treasury Discount Bills could be issued, sources added. On Saturday, PM Abe said that the government will compile a stimulus package in about ten days, which will include cash pay-outs to households and a scheme for private institutions to lend to some businesses at 0% interest rate. Elsewhere, Japan's cabinet secretary has said that the country could be moving towards a 'national emergency' declaration.</p><p><strong>EUROPEAN RESTRICTIONS:</strong> Italian government will be extending lockdown measures until \"Easter April 12th\", according to Health Minister. Meanwhile, the Deputy Health Minister, in Ansa, sees the Italy virus peak occurring in 7-10 days.</p><p><strong>GERMANY</strong> is asking companies to suspend dividends in exchange for COVID-19 aid. Meanwhile, regulator Bafin, is also recommending dividends and share buybacks not to take place until at least October – inline with the ECB’s call and some other European fiscal authorities.</p><p><strong>UK:</strong> It was reported by The Telegraph that the European People's Party has called for an extension of EU-UK trade negotiations due to the coronavirus; any extension request must arise from the UK, could be presented at the June conference as a joint decision. However, a spokesperson for PM Johnson later said that the Brexit transition period will end at the end of this year, where more continuous discussions are taking place rather than set rounds. Elsewhere, the spokesperson said he is not aware of any imminent new lockdown measures.</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 1.42 LOWER AT USD 20.09/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 1.53 LOWER AT USD 26.42/BBL</strong></p><p><strong>Brent futures led losses to take the benchmarks to levels not seen in 20 years</strong>. The benchmarks failed to benefit from firmer equities and instead drifted lower throughout the session, with WTI flirting beneath the USD 20/bbl figure, seeing contango deepen with the May/June WTI calendar spread close to USD 4/bbl. Selling pressure was felt amid the Saudi Energy Ministry saying the Kingdom plans to increase crude oil exports from May by around 600k BPD to a total of 10.6mln BPD, saying the increase in exports is due to displacing crude with NatGas and a fall in local demand - further indication the Kingdom is serious about the price war. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin and US President Trump held a call on Monday where they reportedly agreed to hold talks about the oil market at the ministerial level. Meanwhile, the dismal oil outlook continues to exhibit itself: Exxon (XOM) Baton Rouge, Louisiana refinery (500k BPD) is cutting output; India’s Hindustan Petroleum Co invoked a 2mln bbl force majeure of oil loadings from Iraq; North Sea crude stream schedules show further declines in volumes; European April refinery runs have reportedly been cut by 1.3mln BPD, ahead of deeper cuts; Trafigura sees oil demand falling by over 30mln BPD in April. A note by Goldman has also gained a lot of attention, which counterintuitively, suggests there could be a severe oil price inflation shock, reasoning that the large oil market shutdown approaching will lead to large and persistent ramifications to oil supply.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 18 TICKS HIGHER AT 138-26+.</strong></p><p><strong>The TPLEX bull-steepened despite firmer risk appetite and corporate supply. </strong>The T-Note reached its highs not long after the US cash equity open as the Fed continued its ramped-up asset purchases, completing its belly purchases earlier on. However, another deluge of corporate supply to start the week, including Oracle (ORCL) with a USD 20bln 6-parter from the 5-year up to the 40-year maturity, weighed somewhat on duration in the latter part of the session; IFR noted there are at least 12 High Grade primary issuers on Monday for a week that looks set to break records again. Furthermore, the repo operations continue to see minimal demand with the GC rate still trading close to zero, while the reverse repo operation sees continued blockbuster demand, supporting the lack of collateral supply thesis and thus the bull-steepener on Monday. By settlement, 2s -3bps at 0.22%, 10s -6.5bps at 0.68%, 30s -3.5bps 1.30%; front-end bills have risen back into positive territory after moving into negative for the first time ever last week; 3-month USD Libor-OIS remains wide at 136bps.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +3.29% at 2,625, NDX +3.96% at 7,889, DJIA +3.19% at 22,327.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Health +4.67%, Technology +4.23%, Cons Stpl +3.9%, Utilities +3.7%, Communication Svs +3.58%, Materials +3.25%, Real Estate +2.73%, Cons Disc +2.19%, Financials +2.01%, Industrials +1.51%, Energy +1.03%.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) opened higher as it announced its new lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate which it looks to begin human clinical trials by September for. Abbott (ABT) surged after it received FDA approval for one of its COVID-19 tests which it will now ramp production for. Cruise liners (CCL, RCL, NCLH) failed to benefit from the equity rally, where the group failed to receive aid from the latest US stimulus bill. However, airlines (AAL, UAL, DAL) failed to enjoy the rally too, despite a significant portion of the bill provided for the industry, although they are yet to receive such. Energy stocks (XLE, XOP) were the sector “least” in the green as crude prices continued to make new lows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>FOREX WRAP: </strong>Risk-sensitive FX came under pressure with the USD bid. Some analysts have made the case that Asia is now taking its cues from the European and North American case count/death tolls to judge the stabilisation in the global economy, and that relative growth will more likely be the driver of FX, rather than rate differentials.</p><p><strong>USD: </strong>After falling almost 4% last week, profit-taking in the buck has paused amid the soft global risk tone. Analysts have suggested that the dollar may see upside given its role as the global reserve currency makes it a countercyclical hedge, CBA said, adding that it expects the dollar to reassert itself as a one of the strongest currencies; deterioration in global econonomic outlook was likely to offset the high liklihood of the US falling into a recession. Others have asked whether the 102.99 high from 20/March is the peak - much will depend on how the virus plays out (estimates that the disruption could be seen for longer have today injected caution into trade), as well as forward-looking metrics, like some of the components within ISM data to be released this week; while the weekly jobless claims will garner more attention than Friday's monthly employment situation report. Either way, Trump's hope for normalisation by Easter appear to be hopeful at best. Meanwhile, month-end factors are likely also playing a role on Monday, with bank-models signalling the greenback is a buy into the last trading days of the month.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling is lower on Monday following a downgrade at Fitch, which cited the impact on budgets from coronavirus stimulus measures, as well as continued uncertainty over Brexit. The UK's chief medical officer may also have contributed, after she said believes it will be two-to-three months before the government can truly assess whether the virus has been quashed - it could be as much as 6-months, however.</p><p><strong>CNY:</strong> PBOC unexpectedly cut its one-week repo rates, and there are expectations that it could lwoer its MLF and LPR rates by the same 20bps magnitude later this month. More immediately, Citi thinks China is on the verge of announcing a massive stimulus package, where the government will have to rely on investment policy tools to support growth; Citi sees a big push in both traditional and new infrastructure investment as highly probable. On Friday, Xinhua reported that China will increase its fiscal deficit as a share of GDP, and issue special sovereign debt while allowing local governments to sell more infrastructure bonds as part of a package to stabilise the economy; the comments came after Wednesday's Politburo meeting.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> Government announced larger than expected subsidies for worker wages, and is faring better than its Antipodean counterpart.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> While the USD sell-off paused on Monday, some analysts still believe that easing USD funding stress could result in the weakness resuming, with Citi's analysts writing that a move in USDJPY towards 104.50-105 and possibly 99-101 is on the cards.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX:</strong> Crude has slumped to the lowest in nearly two decades; WTI fell to below USD 20/bbl, while its Brent counterpart has a 23-handle, piling pressure onto commodity currencies, particularly RUB after Saudi Arabia Friday said it was not in talks with Russia to balance oil markets, despite pressure from the US to stabilise the crude complex. CAD has also been hit by the BOC dragging rates to the lower bound on Friday, and launching QE</p><p><strong>MXN:</strong> S&amp;P's downgrade from last week is still making its presence felt, while domestically, the spread of the virus within Mexico is also causing concerns. Desks are expecting further rate cuts from the Banxico at its May meeting -- perhaps sooner -- with over 75bps of easing priced in through August.</p><p><strong>ZAR:</strong> The rand topped 18.00 and found new record lows against the dollar, underperforming the EM space after the nation lost its final investment grade rating on Friday when Moody's cut it to junk. There is now the potential for flows out of South African bonds markets; analysts are split as to what level of forced selling will be, with estimates ranging from USD 4-11bln+. With that said, the SARB's announcement last week that it would begin buying government bonds may limit the flows. Additionally, the rebalancing of the World Government Bond Index has been pushed back to the end of April, which may delay some of the forced selling.</p><p><strong>KRW:</strong> The won remained around the 1,225 mark despite authorities outlining further fiscal stimulus measures and a second supplementary budget.</p><p><strong>CHF: </strong>Weekly sight deposit data were up CHF 11.6bln in the week through 27th March, the largest weekly rise since 2015.</p>",

The benchmarks failed to benefit from firmer equities and instead drifted lower throughout the session, with WTI flirting beneath the USD 20/bbl figure, seeing contango deepen with the May/June WTI calendar spread close to USD 4/bbl. Selling pressure was felt amid the Saudi Energy Ministry saying the Kingdom plans to increase crude oil exports from May by around 600k BPD to a total of 10.6mln BPD, saying the increase in exports is due to displacing crude with NatGas and a fall in local demand - further indication the Kingdom is serious about the price war. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin and US President Trump held a call on Monday where they reportedly agreed to hold talks about the oil market at the ministerial level. Meanwhile, the dismal oil outlook continues to exhibit itself: Exxon (XOM) Baton Rouge, Louisiana refinery (500k BPD) is cutting output; India’s Hindustan Petroleum Co invoked a 2mln bbl force majeure of oil loadings from Iraq; North Sea crude stream schedules show further declines in volumes; European April refinery runs have reportedly been cut by 1.3mln BPD, ahead of deeper cuts; Trafigura sees oil demand falling by over 30mln BPD in April. A note by Goldman has also gained a lot of attention, which counterintuitively, suggests there could be a severe oil price inflation shock, reasoning that the large oil market shutdown approaching will lead to large and persistent ramifications to oil supply.</li></ul>",

Saxony's data has been running above national data over the last few months. Food prices rose in the month, and Pantheon sees inflation here remaining elevated in the months ahead as consumers shift their spending towards such products. The core rate was also firm in Saxony. Meanwhile, clothing and household appliances saw downside, perhaps due to discounting, while inflation in transportation and package holidays slipped; inflation in hotels and restaurants was unchanged. \"These datapoints are a bit odd given the collapse in activity in some of the key hospitality services sectors at the back-end of the month, but it’s likely that firms didn’t have a chance to adjust prices,\" Pantheon writes, \"this could be a trend through the lockdown—in Germany and elsewhere—but need to see the April report to be sure.\" The consultancy says that one thing is certain: the 'normal' CPI basket will be difficult to compile next month.</li><li>The implication is that the regional data present risks of a small dip in German inflation today, Pantheon believes, but less than the consensus expects.</li></ul>",

In addition, President Trump recently announced to extend federal guidelines on coronavirus until April 30th and NIH’s Fauci projected a possible 100k-200k deaths. The risk appetite was dampened across most the regional bourses with losses in <strong>Nikkei 225 (-1.6%)</strong> exacerbated by the flows into the JPY and with notable weakness seen in Softbank shares after a Co.-backed satellite start-up filed for bankruptcy, while <strong>ASX 200 (+7%)</strong> bucked the trend on stimulus measures with the government to announce support for employers and employees today. Furthermore, the Australian Banking Association said banks are to permit businesses with up to AUD 10mln in loan facilities to defer repayments up to 6 months which will apply to AUD 100bln of business loans, and regulator APRA announced the deferral of capital reform implementation by 1 year. <strong>Hang Seng (-1.3%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%)</strong> were downbeat despite PBoC efforts in which it injected liquidity through repos for the first time since mid-Feb and lowered the 7-Day Reverse Repo rate by 20bps. Improved earnings including China’s largest banks did little to spur risk appetite amid the broad cautiousness and with press reports suggesting 100mln jobs could be at risk from the coronavirus fallout, while participants also await this week’s upcoming key data including the latest Chinese PMI numbers. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher and briefly approached the 153.00 level amid the subdued risk appetite and after recent comments by PM Abe who vowed an unprecedented economic package which will include fiscal and monetary stimulus, while prices also tracked T-notes which gapped higher at the open to briefly test resistance at 139.00.</p><p><strong>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 7-Day Reverse Repos and cut the associated rate by 20bps to 2.20%.</strong></p><p><strong>PBoC set USD/CNY mid-point at 7.0447 vs. Exp. 7.0448 (Prev. 7.0427</strong>)</p><p>PBoC Adviser Ma Jun said timing of reverse repo cut was in consideration of domestic work resumption, global virus situation and deterioration of external economic environment, while he added that China has plenty of room to adjust monetary policy.

(Newswires) Japan's Ruling Party Policy Chief says the council are to formalise proposals for economic package which will be submitted to PM Abe on Tuesday - package expected to total 16-17% of GDP.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>A choppy session in the equity space with European futures fully paring its pre-market gains and then some, whilst cash markets move in tandem (Eurostoxx 50 -0.5%).</strong> APAC bouses closed the trading day mostly lower, whilst US equity futures reversed earlier upside of almost 1.5% having opened lower by some 1.8%. Stocks in general lack conviction as coronavirus uncertainty feels counterforce (in the short-term at least) from month and quarter-end rebalancing – which models thus far see outflows from Treasuries and inflows into stocks. Back to Europe, major bourses see broad-based losses, whilst in the periphery – Spain’s IBEX (-1.5%) modestly underperforms the region after the county suffered its worst day yet in terms of coronavirus deaths. Subsequently, sectors remain in the red across Europe with defensives faring slightly better than cyclicals at the time of writing. Looking at the breakdown, Travel and Leisure see another session of steep losses, Oil and Gas is also weighed on by price action in respective complexes. However, Banks underperform having been dealt with the prospect of prolonged share buyback and dividend suspensions alongside a lower yield environment. As such, ING (-6.7%) sees itself towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after it announced a dividend suspension until at least 1st October, whilst rebuffing FY20 interim payments. Meanwhile, ABN AMRO (-7.4%) is pressured by anticipated Q1 losses, FY and interim dividend postponements. In terms of other movers – Airbus (-7.5%) tackles subdued aircraft demand as airlines ground their fleets, with easyJet (-6.9%) announcing its entire fleet will be non-operational with no timeframe for the resumption of commercial flights. Elsewhere, Hammerson (-18%) rests at the foot of the pan-European index after noting material impacts on 2020 results and withdrawing dividend and guidance. On the flip side, ASML (+2.8%) sees some reprieve after announcing that its supply chain issues have been resolved, albeit the Co. decided to refrain from Q2 share buybacks.</p><h2><strong>FX</strong></h2><p><strong>USD - </strong>It’s debatable whether the Dollar is benefiting from supportive rebalancing flows for the final trading day of March, the current quarter and the 2019/2020 financial year, or improving chart impulses alongside weakness in rival currencies on specific bearish factors, but suffice to say that the Greenback has pared more of its recent losses. Indeed, the DXY has bounced further from Friday’s low (98.284) towards 99.000 and is currently close to a potentially pivotal technical marker around 98.810 that roughly coincides with a Fib retracement and the 21 DMA. However, jittery risk sentiment and arguably greater demand for the Yen over month/Q1/Japanese half fy end appears to be capping the index.</p><p><strong>JPY - </strong>Bucking the overall G10 trend as noted above, with Usd/Jpy meeting heavy offers above 108.00 from Japanese exporters and various domestic names repatriating funds for tomorrow. The headline pair is now hovering around 107.50 after a knee-jerk spike above the big figure on reports that JGB issuance will be ramped up to fund the fiscal fight against COVID-19, while taking a 4th record equalling amount of BoJ ETF buying in stride.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/CHF/EUR/NZD/AUD - </strong>All overwhelmed if not completely consumed by the Buck’s partial recovery, as the Loonie also digests the latest BoC rate cut and venture into the realms of QE, including commercial paper, on top of another downturn in crude prices. Usd/Cad is towards the top of a 1.4097-1.3993 range, while Cable is sub-1.2400 within 1.2467-1.2319 parameters and Eur/Gbp meandering between 0.8988-21 following Fitch’s 1 run UK ratings downgrade and seemingly 2-way flows into March 31. Nevertheless, the Euro is nearer the base of 1.1143-1.1062 extremes against the Dollar as the coronavirus case and fatality totals continue to pile up in Spain and Italy, and the single currency is also lagging vs the Franc (Eur/Chf sub-1.0600) even though Usd/Chf is hugging 0.9550 from just over 0.9500 at one stage in wake of latest Swiss sight deposits implying increased intervention. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is underperforming down under, or in fact the Aussie is outperforming on the back of bigger financial support efforts from the Government overnight that boosted the ASX. Nzd/Usd is only just keeping afloat of 0.6000 in contrast to Aud/Usd pivoting 0.6150 and the Aud/Nzd cross looking more comfortable on the 1.0200 handle after a brief dip below.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Broad losses vs the Usd against the backdrop fluctuating/fickle risk asset moves, but with the Rouble undermined by Brent’s retracement as well, while the Rand hit fresh record lows circa 18.0750 following Moody’s SA cut to junk, albeit widely anticipated. Conversely, the Singapore Dollar was not unduly ruffled by limited MAS tweaks to the currency peg as it kept the midpoint and corridor unchanged after trimming the band to zero, and the offshore Yuan is off lows post-PBoC 20 bp repo rate cut.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Core debt futures are still defying purported asset rebalancing or risk parity positioning for Tuesday that are tipped to be skewed in favour of stocks, or perhaps simply rallying on broader risk sentiment grounds and noting that equities are not maintaining bullish momentum with the inference that the bulk of the buying for March 31, Q1 and fy end has been completed already. However<strong>, Bunds, Gilts and USTs</strong> are all off best levels (173.79, 137.31 and 139-06+ respectively) awaiting the US open, German CPI, Wall Street and the latest ECB bond buying breakdown to see if flexibility around the issuer limits and individual member state keys have been utilised.</p><h2><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></h2><p>Another detrimental session for the crude markets thus far amid further crystallisation of the demand impact from the virus outbreak as global economies come to a standstill, whilst supply-side woes refuse to subside. Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia opposed an emergency meeting that the OPEC President was urging as oil markets continue to tumble. This rejection would mean that the market will have to wait until the scheduled meeting in June for any revision of output policy. Analysts at ING believe that this will be too late to counter the surplus expected over Q2, and as such the Dutch bank has cut its ICE Brent forecasts to USD 20/bbl vs. Pre. USD 33/bbl for Q2 2020. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs stated that oil demand this week is seen lower by 26mln BPD and suggested it is impossible to shut down that level of demand with the absence of large and persistent ramifications to supply. In terms of today’s trade,<strong> WTI</strong> front-month prices briefly dipped below USD 20/bbl to fresh 17yr lows but meander around the level at the time of writing, meanwhile, its <strong>Brent</strong> counterpart modestly underperforms with added pressure from OPEC – prices breached USD 23/bbl to the downside. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> remains relatively uneventful on either side of USD 1615/oz ahead of this week’s key risk data releases, and with the macro themes also in the fray. <strong>Copper </strong>prices meanwhile mimic the choppy action in stock markets – with the red metal having given up its APAC gains during early European trade.</p>",

The headline pair is now hovering around 107.50 after a knee-jerk spike above the big figure on reports that JGB issuance will be ramped up to fund the fiscal fight against COVID-19, while taking a 4th record equalling amount of BoJ ETF buying in stride.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/CHF/EUR/NZD/AUD</strong> - All overwhelmed if not completely consumed by the Buck’s partial recovery, as the Loonie also digests the latest BoC rate cut and venture into the realms of QE, including commercial paper, on top of another downturn in crude prices. Usd/Cad is towards the top of a 1.4097-1.3993 range, while Cable is sub-1.2400 within 1.2467-1.2319 parameters and Eur/Gbp meandering between 0.8988-21 following Fitch’s 1 run UK ratings downgrade and seemingly 2-way flows into March 31. Nevertheless, the Euro is nearer the base of 1.1143-1.1062 extremes against the Dollar as the coronavirus case and fatality totals continue to pile up in Spain and Italy, and the single currency is also lagging vs the Franc (Eur/Chf sub-1.0600) even though Usd/Chf is hugging 0.9550 from just over 0.9500 at one stage in wake of latest Swiss sight deposits implying increased intervention. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is underperforming down under, or in fact the Aussie is outperforming on the back of bigger financial support efforts from the Government overnight that boosted the ASX. Nzd/Usd is only just keeping afloat of 0.6000 in contrast to Aud/Usd pivoting 0.6150 and the Aud/Nzd cross looking more comfortable on the 1.0200 handle after a brief dip below.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Broad losses vs the Usd against the backdrop fluctuating/fickle risk asset moves, but with the Rouble undermined by Brent’s retracement as well, while the Rand hit fresh record lows circa 18.0750 following Moody’s SA cut to junk, albeit widely anticipated. Conversely, the Singapore Dollar was not unduly ruffled by limited MAS tweaks to the currency peg as it kept the midpoint and corridor unchanged after trimming the band to zero, and the offshore Yuan is off lows<strong> </strong>post-PBoC 20 bp repo rate cut.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Core debt futures are still defying purported asset rebalancing or risk parity positioning for Tuesday that are tipped to be skewed in favour of stocks, or perhaps simply rallying on broader risk sentiment grounds and noting that equities are not maintaining bullish momentum with the inference that the bulk of the buying for March 31, Q1 and fy end has been completed already. However, <strong>Bunds, Gilts </strong>and<strong> USTs</strong> are all off best levels (173.79, 137.31 and 139-06+ respectively) awaiting the US open, German CPI, Wall Street and the latest ECB bond buying breakdown to see if flexibility around the issuer limits and individual member state keys have been utilised.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Another detrimental session for the crude markets thus far </strong>amid further crystallisation of the demand impact from the virus outbreak as global economies come to a standstill, whilst supply-side woes refuse to subside. Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia opposed an emergency meeting that the OPEC President was urging as oil markets continue to tumble. This rejection would mean that the market will have to wait until the scheduled meeting in June for any revision of output policy. Analysts at ING believe that this will be too late to counter the surplus expected over Q2, and as such the Dutch bank has cut its ICE Brent forecasts to USD 20/bbl vs. Pre. USD 33/bbl for Q2 2020. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs stated that oil demand this week is seen lower by 26mln BPD and suggested it is impossible to shut down that level of demand with the absence of large and persistent ramifications to supply. In terms of today’s trade, <strong>WTI</strong> front-month prices briefly dipped below USD 20/bbl to fresh 17yr lows but meander around the level at the time of writing, meanwhile, its <strong>Brent</strong> counterpart modestly underperforms with added pressure from OPEC – prices breached USD 23/bbl to the downside. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> remains relatively uneventful on either side of USD 1615/oz ahead of this week’s key risk data releases, and with the macro themes also in the fray. <strong>Copper</strong> prices meanwhile mimic the choppy action in stock markets – with the red metal having given up its APAC gains during early European trade.</p>",

In addition, President Trump recently announced to extend federal guidelines on coronavirus until April 30th and NIH’s Fauci projected a possible 100k-200k deaths. The risk appetite was dampened across most the regional bourses with losses in Nikkei 225 (-3.9%) exacerbated by the flows into the JPY and with notable weakness seen in Softbank shares after a Co.-backed satellite start-up filed for bankruptcy, while ASX 200 (+3.7%) bucked the trend on stimulus measures with the government to announce support for employers and employees today. Furthermore, the Australian Banking Association said banks are to permit businesses with up to AUD 10mln in loan facilities to defer repayments up to 6 months which will apply to AUD 100bln of business loans, and regulator APRA announced the deferral of capital reform implementation by 1 year. Hang Seng (-1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.6%) were downbeat despite PBoC efforts in which it injected liquidity through repos for the first time since mid-Feb and lowered the 7-Day Reverse Repo rate by 20bps. Improved earnings including China’s largest banks did little to spur risk appetite amid the broad cautiousness and with press reports suggesting 100mln jobs could be at risk from the coronavirus fallout, while participants also await this week’s upcoming key data including the latest Chinese PMI numbers.</p><p>FTSE 100</p><p><strong>Rio Tinto (RIO LN) </strong>– CEO states that a majority of its assets are still operating and will work with clients to fulfil orders.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets resumed their selling, and US equity futures also began the week on the backfoot (before gradually recouping losses) as coronavirus woes continued to weigh on risk appetite and following last Friday’s declines on Wall St after the US overtook China with the greatest number of coronavirus cases. In addition, President Trump recently announced to extend federal guidelines on coronavirus until April 30th and NIH’s Fauci projected a possible 100k-200k deaths. The risk appetite was dampened across most the regional bourses with losses in Nikkei 225 (-3.9%) exacerbated by the flows into the JPY and with notable weakness seen in Softbank shares after a Co.-backed satellite start-up filed for bankruptcy, while ASX 200 (+3.7%) bucked the trend on stimulus measures with the government to announce support for employers and employees today. Furthermore, the Australian Banking Association said banks are to permit businesses with up to AUD 10mln in loan facilities to defer repayments up to 6 months which will apply to AUD 100bln of business loans, and regulator APRA announced the deferral of capital reform implementation by 1 year. Hang Seng (-1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.6%) were downbeat despite PBoC efforts in which it injected liquidity through repos for the first time since mid-Feb and lowered the 7-Day Reverse Repo rate by 20bps. Improved earnings including China’s largest banks did little to spur risk appetite amid the broad cautiousness and with press reports suggesting 100mln jobs could be at risk from the coronavirus fallout, while participants also await this week’s upcoming key data including the latest Chinese PMI numbers. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher and briefly approached the 153.00 level amid the subdued risk appetite and after recent comments by PM Abe who vowed an unprecedented economic package which will include fiscal and monetary stimulus, while prices also tracked T-notes which gapped higher at the open to briefly test resistance at 139.00.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets resume their selling and US equity futures also began the week on the backfoot as coronavirus woes continue to weigh on risk appetite and following last Friday’s declines on Wall St after the US overtook China with the greatest number of coronavirus cases, while President Trump recently announced to extend federal guidelines on coronavirus until April 30th and NIH’s Fauci projected a possible 100k-200k deaths. The risk appetite was dampened across most the regional bourses with losses in Nikkei 225 (-3.4%) exacerbated by the flows into the JPY and with notable weakness seen in Softbank shares after a Co.-backed satellite start-up filed for bankruptcy, while ASX 200 (+2.7%) bucks the trend on stimulus measures with the government to announce support for employers and employees today. Furthermore, the Australian Banking Association said banks are to permit businesses with up to AUD 10mln in loan facilities to defer repayments up to 6 months which will apply to AUD 100bln of business loans, and banks also benefit after the banking regulator APRA announced the deferral of capital reform implementation by 1 year. Hang Seng (-1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.5%) are downbeat despite the PBoC efforts in which it injected liquidity through repos for the first time since mid-Feb and lowered the repo rate by 20bps, with improved earnings including all Big 4 banks that have reported so far, doing little to spur risk appetite amid the broad cautiousness and as participants await this week’s upcoming key data including the latest Chinese PMI numbers.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly firmer and rose back above the 98.50 level as the downbeat sentiment underpins safe-haven currencies and spurs demand for cash. The greenback also benefits from the pullback in its major counterparts including EUR/USD which gave up the 1.1100 handle after the alarming weekend death tolls from the blocs worst hit countries Italy and Spain, while GBP/USD trickled through support at 1.2400 following the recent sovereign rating downgrade by Fitch. Elsewhere, USD/JPY extended below 107.50 on the safe-haven flows and antipodeans are indecisive amid a lack of drivers and following a stable PBoC reference rate setting, while SGD was choppy and initially strengthened despite the MAS loosening its FX-based policy as some viewed the actions to be somewhat reserved after it only reduced the slope of the currency band to 0% or neutral, with both the width and the mid-point of the band kept unchanged.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher and briefly approached the 153.00 level amid the subdued risk appetite and following recent comments by PM Abe who vowed an unprecedented economic package which will include fiscal and monetary stimulus.</p>",
