The employment situation report was mildly disappointing, with the headline missing expectations, and the pace of wage growth easing to under 3.0% Y/Y, bringing buying interest. A Raymond James strategist said that for the bond market, this was a positive number, especially when it comes to wage inflation; \"the subtle drop in the number of hours worked,\" he said, \"and the lower-than-expected average hourly earnings number is good for fixed income. While today's data may not result in a big move down in rates, it certainly doesn’t support a big move higher either”. US T-note futures (H20) settled 6 ticks higher at 129-02+.</p>",
