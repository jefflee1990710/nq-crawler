The minutes stated there was agreement on need to change stance and demonstrate a determination to act, while there was broad agreement the ECB needs to be ready and prepared to ease further if required in which potential measures include extending or strengthening guidance, resuming asset purchases and cutting rates. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB’s Coeure said the protracted period of low inflation has caused concerns among financial market participants that current subdued underlying price pressures will persist in the medium term and the Governing Council is taking these concerns seriously. (Newswires)</p><p>IMF sees undershooting of EZ's inflation objective and calls for prolonged monetary accommodation, while it added that the ECB should consider new asset purchase program if further accommodation is required. IMF also suggested that the ECB should shorten maturity of new TLTRO's, offering less generous pricing terms than in TLTRO II to avoid banks increasing their sovereign exposure. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>OPEC monthly report stated that OPEC crude production fell 68k bpd in June to 29.83mln bpd according to secondary sources and that crude output decreased mostly in Iran, Libya and Angola, while production increased in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, 2019 oil demand growth is forecast at around 1.14mln bpd which was unchanged from the prior report and guides 2020 global oil demand to rise by 1.12mln bpd.

(Axios)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Fed's Williams (Voter, Hawkish) said the economy is in a good place but added the Fed must be ready to adjust policy to sustain the expansion and that inflation is below target which could feed into inflation expectations. Williams further commented that arguments for adding accommodation have strengthened over time in which he noted uncertainties around trade and global growth have not improved, while he added that expectations of rate cuts are showing up in easier financial conditions although he sees rates currently as neutral. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Barkin (Non-Voter, Hawkish) said it is \"tricky\" to try to use low rates to boost inflation and suggested inflation is running low as well as steady and not a concern for businesses or consumers. Barkin also suggested that it is hard to make the case for both stepping on the gas or stepping on the brakes and that small rate moves are unlikely to do much to move businesses' settled pricing routines, while big rate moves risk providing 4% inflation. However, Barkin later commented that research shows if you are going to do something on rates it is better to do something sooner than later and that he can see the case for an insurance rate cut but that case for a rate cut to re-centre inflation doesn't feel strong enough. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Bostic (Non-Voter, Dove) said he wants to keep an open mind for the July meeting and not front run a rate call, while he added that low readings on inflation are \"noisy\" and other data suggests the Fed is close to its 2% target not moving away from it. Bostic also commented that the central bank is in a good position right now on jobs and inflation but also noted it is clear risks to the economy have grown compared to the prior year including trade and weak global growth.

A number of analysts pointed out that this ruling was also a slight negative for drug makers; Pfizer (PFE) and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK) were subsequently under pressure. Eli Lilly (LLY) also fell, but for its own reasons, after its biomedicine head announced plans to quit in August. Delta Airlines (DAL) moved higher after promising earnings, in which the co. beat on both the top and bottom-line, as well as raising guidance, bringing rivals such as Southwest Airlines (LUV), American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental Holdings (UAL) higher. Fastenal (FAST) shares plummeted after the co. missed on top and bottom-line earnings and expressed concern over a slowing in activity levels relative to Q1. Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) fell after the co. reported Q2 weak comp sales for Q2. Amgen (AMGN) fell after the co. said it plans to enforce a court decision against Praluent in Germany. Humana (HUM), Anthem (ANTM) and DaVita (DVA) all moved higher after SVB Leerink commented positively. L Brands (LB) was under pressure again, extending losses in a week where the CEO Wexner relationship with Jeffrey Epstein has been under scrutiny. Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST) and Target (TGT) were buoyed after the three were initiated with a buy at Goldman.

The 30-year auction was poorly received, tailing by a huge 2.6bps on very soft cover, seeing yields edge higher in its wake.

Nevertheless, it was still a positive start for stocks, with the Dow topping 27,000, and the SPX coming to within a point of printing fresh intraday highs. However, the SPX couldn’t hold on to the 3,000 level after a dreadful 30-year auction, however, a late session rally ; demand was poor, with some desks suggesting that it shows not all investors are buying into the Fed dovishness (if they saw lower yields in the future, the theory is they’d scoop up debt at higher yields, especially when they are at rates above inflation; if investors saw higher yields ahead, they would be cool on buying debt at current rates). In wake of the auction, hawkish comments from Barkin and Bostic (the latter of whom is usually dovish) also weighed on risk, although Barkin later suggested he sees a case for an insurance cut.</p><p><strong>* US CPI: </strong>Inflationary pressures were running hot in June, with CPI printing +0.1% M/M (exp. 0.0%), core came in at 0.3% M/M (exp. 0.2%); the headline was 1.6% Y/Y, falling from 1.8%, but the core rate rose to 2.1% Y/Y from 2.0%. Encouragingly, there were a few factors driving the core higher: rebound in used car prices, rise in rents, rising apparel prices, a rise in household furniture, and even a rise in healthcare costs. Some have questioned how sustainable the price rises are. Pantheon Macroeconomics says it is key to see what happens next: “we’d be surprised to see a run of 0.3% increases, but tight rental supply isn’t going away, and the sharp jump in the NFIB selling price index since China tariffs were increased suggests that businesses can no longer absorb all of the increase in costs.” The consultancy says this report will be unlikely to stop the Fed from easing at its July meeting, but it could suggest that a 50bps rate cut is a risky call. After the CPI data, pricing for a ‘double’ rate cut of 50bps at the July meeting fell to 14.5% (vs 24% pre the CPI data); 29bps of easing priced for July (vs 31bps before the data); 64bps of easing priced by end-2019 (vs 67bps pre the CPI data).</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong> US President Trump’s fresh threats against Iran over its nuclear program comes amid new diplomatic efforts to isolate Tehran. Trump on Wednesday warned on Twitter that the US response “will soon be increased substantially.” Politico reported that senior US administration officials now agree that China violated sanctions by importing Iranian oil last month, they are now mulling secondary sanction in a move that would strain US-China trade talks. Meanwhile, the UK confirmed that a naval vessel assisted a BP tanker through the Straits of Hormuz after an Iranian vessel was reportedly ‘blocking’ the British ship in retaliation for the UK seizing the Iranian tanker in Gibraltar; later in the session, a source reported that the UK does not intend to escort every British vessel through the Straits of Hormuz, but has implemented a “heightened security” warning for UK ships.</p><p><strong>* POWELL PART II:</strong> Fed Chair Powell had the opportunity to push back on market pricing for a rate cut at the July meeting; instead, his testimonies have crystalized the prospect of a cut of at least 25bps, while pricing for a ‘double’ rate cut of 50bps has once again started to be priced back in (albeit, not as aggressively as seen before last week’s payrolls report. It was quite significant that Powell’s testimony addressed developments since the June policy meeting, Nomura says. (Powell said: “Since [the June meeting], based on incoming data and other developments, it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the U.S. economic outlook. Inflation pressures remain muted.”); combine that with the downplaying of the solid June NFP report, which could be an indication that there is a high bar to dissuade the FOMC from a rate cut at the July meeting. On the question of a 50bps rate cut, or a 25bps cut, desks have observed that Powell refused to commit, and this could suggest the decision could be influenced by incoming data between now and the 31st July policy meeting. It is also noteworthy that the Fed is split: the minutes have revealed that while “many” judged additional monetary accommodation would be warranted in the near-term, “some” did not see a strong case for rate cuts, and a “few” noted that looser policy might risk of overheating the economy.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> <strong>Fed’s Williams</strong> (voter) said the Fed should stand ready to adjust policy to keep the US expansion continuing; he argued that calls for adding policy accommodation have strengthened over time, noting uncertainties around trade and global growth has not improved. Expectations of rate cuts are showing up in easier financial conditions, Williams said, and he does not see uncertainties shifting in a positive direction. Williams added that he is monitoring inflation carefully, including possibility of inflation expectations falling. <strong>Fed’s</strong> <strong>Quarles</strong> (voter) didn’t comment on the rate outlook, but towed the line of a strong economy with significant risks out there.<strong> Fed's Barkin</strong> (non-voter) said it is \"tricky\" to try to use low rates to boost inflation; inflation is running low and steady, and not a concern for businesses or consumers; he also said that it is hard to make the case for both stepping on the gas and stepping on the brakes, but later said he can see the case for an insurance rate cut; adding that small rate moves are unlikely to do much to move businesses' settled pricing routines; big rate moves risk providing 4% inflation.<strong> Fed's Bostic</strong> (non-voter) said he wants to keep an open mind for the July meeting and not front run a rate call, but said the Fed is in a good position right now on jobs and inflation. Further on inflation, Bostic said the low readings are \"noisy\" (hinting at transitory), and is sceptical that expectations are weak. <strong>Fed’s Kashkari</strong> (non-voter) is due to appear at a town hall event after the close.</p><p><strong>* ECB MINUTES: </strong>The accounts from the ECB’s June meeting provided little in the way of surprises, and the minutes largely reflected the tone of the press conference and the recent remarks by policymakers, with a message that the central bank is prepared to intervene if necessary. To surmise, policymakers stated that there should be no room for complacency in the fall of market expectations and as such, there was a broad agreement (interestingly, not unanimous) for the need to shift the Bank’s stance and demonstrate a determination act. Elsewhere, in terms of the modalities of the TLTRO programme, the argument was made for pricing to be in line with the prior round; n.b. the ECB opted for the MRO rate +10bps i.e. 10bps more expensive than TLTRO2. From a guidance perspective, one interesting takeaway was that the “point was made that the value of calendar-element of guidance could seen to be diminished”, which appears to provide some concern over the Bank having pushed back their guidance multiple times and provide some cover if they need to do so again as anticipated by markets. The account also showed policymakers continuing to push back on the need for a tiered deposit rate system by suggesting that the “costs of negative rates are outweighed by benefits,” however, there was an acknowledgement that “this might not hold for lower rates or longer horizons”. Overall, ING concludes that “the ECB can hardly continue talking the talk without walking the walk”, therefore, the Dutch bank speculates that policymakers could opt to change forward guidance on rates to include “or lower” and thus open the door for rate cuts with a bigger announcement to come in September, “possibly consisting of a 20bp cut in the deposit rate and a restart of QE”.</p><p><strong>* ECB: Coeure</strong> said that the protracted period of low inflation has caused concerns among financial market participants that current subdued underlying price pressures will persist in the medium term, which the Governing Council is taking seriously. He added, pessimism priced into the bond market today may not necessarily presage downward pressure on inflation tomorrow, or at least not to the same extent.</p><p><strong>* IMF ON EUROZONE: </strong>IMF sees an undershooting of EZ's inflation objective, and calls for prolonged monetary accommodation, arguing that if further accommodation is required, the ECB should consider a new asset purchase programme. The IMF also said that the ECB should shorten the maturity of new TLTRO's, offering less generous pricing terms than in TLTRO II to avoid banks increasing their sovereign exposure. Traders were more interested in the update given IMF's Lagarde is set to take the helm at the ECB after Draghi steps down.</p><p><strong>* US/UK TRADE:</strong> The Telegraph reports that leaked documents expose a lack of progress in US-UK trade talks amid “chronic” staffing shortages and communication breakdowns in Whitehall; the report states that overstretched departments have been working “at cross purposes” as transatlantic talks have repeatedly stumbled over politically sensitive topics such as rules on health, farming and the finance industry.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLES 14+ TICKS LOWER AT 126-31+: </strong>The curve bear-steepened after CPI came in above expectations, diminishing arguments for a 50bps rate cut at the Fed’s July 31st policy meeting, while hawkish Fedspeak from Barkin and Bostic added to the downside, with traders largely having discounted the Powell comments, which were pretty much a copy and paste of Wednesday’s testimony. The 30-year auction was poorly received, tailing by a huge 2.6bps on very soft cover, seeing yields edge higher in its wake. At settlement major curve spreads were wider: 2s30s +41bps, 2s5s +3bps, 2s10s +4bps.</p><p><strong>* OPEC MONTHLY REPORT: </strong>OPEC crude production fell 68k BPD in June to 29.83mln BPD; output decreased mostly in Iran, Libya, and Angola, while production increased in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. For 2019, oil demand growth is forecast at around 1.14mln BPD; unchanged from the prior report. In 2020, the initial forecast indicates growth of around 1.14mln BPD Y/Y, as global oil demand is anticipated to surpass the 100mln BPD threshold on an annual basis, to average 101.01mln BPD for the year. Demand for OPEC crude for 2019 was revised up by 100k BPD from the previous report to stand at 30.6mln bpd, 1.0mln BPD lower than the 2018 level. The non-OPEC oil supply growth forecast for 2019 has been revised down by 95k BPD to reach 2.05mln BPD Y/Y, standing at 64.43mln BPD. In 2020, non-OPEC oil supply is projected to grow by 2.4mln BPD, averaging 66.87mln BPD.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q9) SETTLE USD 0.23 LOWER AT USD 60.20; BRENT (U9) SETTLES USD 0.49 LOWER AT USD 66.52:</strong> The crude complex was softer on Thursday, following the recent rally, being supported by geopolitics (Trump ramping up threats on Iran; UK confirms a naval vessel had to assist a BP tanker, which was being blocked by Iranians in the Straits of Hormuz, as retaliation for seizing an Iranian vessel in Gibraltar), weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico (around 1mln BPD of oil, or around 53% of total Gulf of Mexico production has been impacted), as well as this week’s inventory draws (DOE and API reported heavy draws). UBS’ analysts would expect a pull-back in oil once the temporary GoM shut-ins come to an end, but say that risks remain skewed to the upside as a result of the various geopolitical factors at play.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.2% AT 2999.91, NASDAQ-100 -0.1% AT 7896.78, DOW JONES 0.9% AT 27088.08.

A number of analysts pointed out that this ruling was also a slight negative for drug makers; Pfizer (PFE) and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK) were subsequently under pressure. Eli Lilly (LLY) also fell, but for its own reasons, after its biomedicine head announced plans to quit in August. Delta Airlines (DAL) moved higher after promising earnings, in which the co. beat on both the top and bottom-line, as well as raising guidance, bringing rivals such as Southwest Airlines (LUV), American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental Holdings (UAL) higher. Fastenal (FAST) shares plummeted after the co. missed on top and bottom-line earnings and expressed concern over a slowing in activity levels relative to Q1. Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) fell after the co. reported Q2 weak comp sales for Q2. Amgen (AMGN) fell after the co. said it plans to enforce a court decision against Praluent in Germany. Humana (HUM), Anthem (ANTM) and DaVita (DVA) all moved higher after SVB Leerink commented positively. L Brands (LB) was under pressure again, extending losses in a week where the CEO Wexner relationship with Jeffrey Epstein has been under scrutiny. Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST) and Target (TGT) were buoyed after the three were initiated with a buy at Goldman. Notable stocks moving higher on positive broker moves include; Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) upgraded at Wedbush, Spirit Realty Capital (SRC) upgraded at Morgan Stanley, Willis Towers Watson (WLTW) upgraded at Wells Fargo, Weight Watchers (WW) upgraded at JPM, Nvidia (NVDA) upgraded at Cascend. Notable stocks under pressure after negative broker moves include; TakeTwo (TTWO) downgraded at Jefferies, Alcoa (AA) downgraded at Deutsche Bank, FleetCor Technologies (FLT) downgraded at Morgan Stanley, Iron Mountain Inc (IRM) downgraded at BofA.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The <strong>DXY</strong> is flat, paring back earlier losses after a ‘hot’ CPI report weighed on pricing for a ‘double’ rate cut at the Fed’s July meeting; hawkish comments from Barkin and Bostic also contributed.

Crucially, the ECB meeting is before the FOMC (25 July, Fed on 31 July), which could lead to some interesting scenarios. Some desks, however, thinks this may leave EURUSD in a range ahead of those meetings.</p><p><strong>* CAD:</strong> The BOC remained in neutral mode on Wednesday, choosing not to join most other major central banks in pivoting dovish, strengthening the Loonie, which has also been supported by crude inventory draws this week. SocGen’s strategists now see a move to 1.25 as a possibility. The bank argues that the CAD continues to lag the move in relative rates, and the BOC is definitely out of sync with the Fed. IT notes as an aside, that we may have thought that given the ties between the US and Canadian economies, USDCAD would diverge less from PPP than other FX pairs, but nothing could be further from the truth, adding that the CAD is cheap here and eventually, USDCAD it will get back to at least 1.26.</p><p><strong>* SEK:</strong> Swedish inflation decelerated in June, as expected, though CPIF came in at 1.7% Y/Y from a previous 2.1%, just short of market consensus for 1.8%; lower energy and utilities prices were the drag. ING thinks that the latest dip in headline CPIF, and the fact that it is likely to remain below target for the rest of this year, is unlikely to faze the Riksbank, which has already factored all of this into its forecasts, and June’s CPIF figure was slightly above its view. Accordingly, many analysts have been making the case that there is not a lot in the data to alter its view, or its guidance that rates could rise as soon as late 2019. ING’s analysts are more sceptical, however, warning that there are risks that next year's wage negotiations will deliver a more lacklustre outcome than policymakers are expecting. “Both inflation (CPI) and wage expectations over a five-year horizon have been declining among employee's labour organisations,” ING says, “Throw in the risks that global trade tensions could pose for Sweden's relatively open economy, and we think rates are likely to be kept on hold for the foreseeable future.”</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Aussie housing finance approvals dropped sharply in May (-2.4% M/M, taking the Y/Y rate to -20.9%, the worst annualised print since the great financial crisis).

UBS says that such changes in language, while subtle, carry some insight into the central bank’s next step, and that with the maturing MLF (CNY 188.5bln due on 15th July, and CNY 502bln on 23rd July) as well as the July mid-month tax payments, China’s central bank might step up liquidity support this month to offset the maturing MLF.</p>",

Analysts at UBS says this implied USD 26bln of new cash (ex SOMA-holdings), split between USD 24bln of redemptions, and USD 2bln of coupon payments.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* 30-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> June's 30-year auction saw decent demand, with cover at the highest since October 2018, and stopping through by 0.4bps on a yield that was lowest since 2016. The most recent primary dealer data shows holdings of USD 40.3bln in the 11-year+ sector, the lowest in five months. From a RV perspective, SocGen's analysts say that the 30-year sector appears to be trading fair on asset-swap, while the 5s30s curve has flattened in the last fortnight after reaching multi-month highs, and appears rich. A steepening of the curve from here should marginally support demand for the auction even though the current WI yield is trading below all auction stops since October 2016, SocGen says.</p><p><strong>* Previous History:</strong></p><ul><li>High-yield rate: prev. 2.607%, 6-month average 2.917%</li><li>Tail: prev. -0.4bps, 6-month average 0.4bps</li><li>Bid-to-cover: prev. 2.32x, 6-month average 2.25x</li><li>Dealers: prev. 24.1%, 6-auction average 26.5%</li><li>Directs: prev. 15.1%, 6-auction average 14.6%</li><li>Indirects: prev. 60.8%, 6-auction average 58.8%</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Dollar and index have pared some losses on the back of broadly firmer than forecast US inflation data, and in particular the core y/y rate that climbed to 1 ½ year highs, that prompted yet another rethink about July FOMC easing prospects. Dovish testimony from Fed chair Powell and minutes from last month’s policy meeting have set the stage for a cut in circa 3 weeks, but markets are still weighing up the likelihood of 25 bp or ½ point and the balance duly swung back away from the latter to the former, albeit still significantly above the sub-5% lows posted in wake of NFP. However, with several more key and potentially influential macro releases between now and July 31 the DXY remains top-heavy just above 97.000 within a 97.076-96.792 range, albeit more comfortably off the 200 DMA and the pre-jobs data mtd base (96.767 and 96.592 respectively).</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP/AUD/SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The best performing G10 currencies, or biggest default winners at the Greenback’s expense. However, the Kiwi topped out ahead of 0.6700 in advance of tonight’s NZ manufacturing PMI and perhaps wary that the headline index could easily fall below 50 from only just above the growth/contraction divide last time. Similarly, Cable ran into offers before 1.2600 and the Aussie stalled in advance of 0.7000, but the Scandi Crowns suffered few set-backs even though Swedish CPI metrics were rather mixed and crude prices stalled. Indeed, Eur/Sek broke further below the 100 DMA at 10.5920 to a 10.5560 base and Eur/Nok tested 9.6150 from 9.6610 at one stage, with relatively hawkish Riksbank and Norges Bank policy stances compounding technical impulses.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>Relative laggards as the Yen pulled back further from a foray above 108.00, but found buyers a few pips ahead of 108.50 where 1.4 bn option expiries sat, while the Franc failed to breach 0.9850 convincingly and the single currency faded around 1.1285 amidst relatively dovish ECB minutes vs comments from Coeure in the run up contending that bond markets may be too pessimistic in terms of pricing (likely referring to the recent deep negative yields). Note also, Eur/Usd also had expiry interest to at least acknowledge given 1.3 bn running off between 1.1290-1.1300, and the Loonie lost post-BoC momentum after a fleeting probe through 1.3050.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Another eventful session for the Lira, Rand and Real to name a few, as the EU upped the ante against Turkey for continuing its off-shore drilling, while reports circulated about a debt for equity swap for SA’s Eskom by the PIC and euphoria over Brazil’s Pension reform bill was tempered by talk that amendments could dampen its positive impact. Usd/Try, Usd/Zar and Usd/Brl are holding around 5.6725, 13.9400 and 3.7560 respectively within 5.6905-6560, 13.9915-13.8600 and 3.7615-7355 parameters.</p>",

(U/C) </strong>advanced with energy names frontrunning the outperformance in Hong Kong and as sentiment was also underpinned after China announced to take measures to stabilize trade as well as lower import tariff levels. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked the moves in T-notes in the aftermath of Powell’s dovish testimony, but with upside limited amid gains in stocks and weaker demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated JGBs.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 100bln.

Other notable movers include, Indivior (+26.0%) who are topping the Stoxx 600 after raising their FY19 guidance after experiencing a stronger than expected H1. Separately, Deutsche Banks (-0.7%) woes are continuing as reports indicate that the US Justice Department is investigating the Co. in relation to the 1MDB funds. Elsewhere, sources indicate that Ab InBev (-0.8%) are to guide pricing for their Hong Kong Budweiser unit towards the bottom end of its indicative range; which implies a price of USD 8.3bln vs. the USD 9.8bln at the top of the scale. Finally, off of the back of a broker downgrade at UBS, Sika (-4.0%) are lagging the SMI; for reference, the Co. was downgraded to sell from neutral.</p><p>FX</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> Dovish FOMC minutes have prompted another recalibration of market pricing for the July meeting and a further resurgence in expectations for a 50 bp rate cut to over 25% from as little as 2.5% at one stage post-NFP. Hence, the Greenback has pulled back further ahead of US CPI data that has assumed even more importance given Fed chair Powell’s growing concern about persistently weak inflation, in contrast to transitory factors that were deemed to be depressing prices not that long ago. Amidst widespread declines, the DXY has retreated below 97.000 towards 96.800 and not far from the 200 DMA (96.767) that was reclaimed on the back of last Friday’s stellar 200k+ payrolls count.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD/CHF/GBP -</strong> The major beneficiaries of the Buck’s demise as the Yen rebounds through 108.00 and gets close to decent option expiry interest layered from 107.80 (1.2 bn) to 107.70-65 (1 bn) before losing some momentum, while the Kiwi is consolidating strong recovery gains above 0.6650 after yesterday’s overnight stop or error trade induced spill and now eyeing NZ manufacturing PMI for independent inspiration. Elsewhere, the Franc is not far from 0.9850 and the Pound has reclaimed 1.2500+ status with more conviction, though could be hampered by 500 mn expiries at the strike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/EUR -</strong> The Aussie has also bounced firmly from lows and a probe under key Fib support with the aid of diverging RBA/Fed policy outlooks, as the former shifts to neutral or wait-and-see mode following back-to-back 25 bp eases. Aud/Usd is hovering around 0.6975 and seeking further guidance/direction from RBA’s Debelle later today. Similar story for the Loonie following Wednesday’s BoC meeting that revealed more caution and downside risks to base-line assessments and forecasts, but ultimately maintained an on hold stance, with Usd/Cad settling lower after knee-jerk moves and currently pivoting 1.3050. Continuing the Central Bank theme, ECB minutes could undermine the single currency if dovish enough, as Eur/Usd stalls ahead of 1.1300 having breached 1.1250 and the 200 DMA (1.1255), while decent option expiries lying between 1.1290-1.1300 (1.3 bn) may also prove tough to overcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEK/TRY -</strong> The Swedish Krona has crossed a key chart level in the form of the 100 DMA at 10.5920 vs the Euro in wake of mixed inflation data, as the core CPIF measure that strips out energy prices accelerated and is seen keeping the Riksbank on track to raise the repo around the turn of the year. Conversely, the Turkish Lira is bucking broad trends and underperforming yet again amidst a ramp up in EU angst over Turkey’s ongoing drilling off the coast of Cyprus, and in particular the threat of more restrictive measures. Usd/Try up around 5.6670 within 5.6900-6590 parameters and compared to Usd/Zar sub-13.9300.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Option Expiries of note:</p><p>- EUR/USD: <strong>1.1225-35 (1.1BLN),</strong> 1.1250-60 (870M), <strong>1.1290-1.1300 (1.3BLN)</strong></p><p>- GBP/USD: <strong>1.2500 (500M)</strong></p><p>- USD/CAD: 1.3050 (385M), 1.3075-80 (600M), <strong>1.3100 (1BLN),</strong> 1.3200 (1.2BLN)</p><p>- USD/JPY: <strong>107.65-70 (1BLN), 107.80 (1.2BLN),</strong> 108.00 (663M), <strong>108.25-40 (1BLN). 108.50 (1.4BLN)</strong>, 109.00-20 (3BLN)</p><p>- EUR/JPY: 122.25-30 (752M), <strong>122.75 (1.1BLN)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gilts </strong>are now lagging core counterparts and probing fresh Liffe intraday lows at 130.90, with no obvious catalyst for the reversal from new session highs forged earlier (131.39), although <strong>Bunds</strong> are also sagging having breached chart support around 172.43 a while ago and then attempting to regroup. The latter now testing/breaking another downside technical level around 172.29 at 172.17, with <strong>US Treasuries</strong> down in sympathy and the curve steepening ahead of CPI and long bond supply. Perhaps BTP outperformance is weighing on the 10 year German benchmark, while comments from ECB’s Coeure do not look that influential at face value in the run up to minutes, so this looks more like a recoil from Powell part one in case he tweaks dovish overtones during take 2.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>WTI and Brent have remained modestly firmer in what has been a quiet session thus far. The complex continues to derive support from the weather situation in the Gulf of Mexico where most recently the NHC are expecting the disturbance to become a tropical depression today; in terms of the impact, yesterday it was reported that 32% of the Gulf’s production has been halted, with the Gulf representing around 15% of the US’ total production. Additionally, the OPEC monthly report is scheduled for release today (12:10 BST) and for reference on Tuesday the EIA cut 2019 oil demand growth view to 1.07mln BPD, -150k BPD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gold (+0.3%) is continuing to benefit from the softer post-Powell dollar, with the yellow metal now firmly above the USD 1400/oz level having printed a session high of USD 1427/oz. This mornings dollar drive strength from gold is likely being derived from market pricing now indicating around a 25% chance of a 50bp cut at July’s FOMC meeting, as such today’s inflation metrics and the second set of comments from Chair Powell may well prove pertinent for the yellow metal. Elsewhere, copper prices are little changed after yesterdays dollar driven rally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>NHC say the distrubance is expected to become a tropical depression later on today; storm surge, heavy rains and hurricane conditions are possible across the North/Central Gulf Coast in a few days.

Other notable movers include, Indivior (+26.0%) who are topping the Stoxx 600 after raising their FY19 guidance after experiencing a stronger than expected H1. Separately, Deutsche Banks (-0.7%) woes are continuing as reports indicate that the US Justice Department is investigating the Co. in relation to the 1MDB funds. Elsewhere, sources indicate that Ab InBev (-0.8%) are to guide pricing for their Hong Kong Budweiser unit towards the bottom end of its indicative range; which implies a price of USD 8.3bln vs. the USD 9.8bln at the top of the scale. Finally, off of the back of a broker downgrade at UBS, Sika (-4.0%) are lagging the SMI; for reference, the Co. was downgraded to sell from neutral.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> Dovish FOMC minutes have prompted another recalibration of market pricing for the July meeting and a further resurgence in expectations for a 50 bp rate cut to over 25% from as little as 2.5% at one stage post-NFP. Hence, the Greenback has pulled back further ahead of US CPI data that has assumed even more importance given Fed chair Powell’s growing concern about persistently weak inflation, in contrast to transitory factors that were deemed to be depressing prices not that long ago. Amidst widespread declines, the DXY has retreated below 97.000 towards 96.800 and not far from the 200 DMA (96.767) that was reclaimed on the back of last Friday’s stellar 200k+ payrolls count.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD/CHF/GBP -</strong> The major beneficiaries of the Buck’s demise as the Yen rebounds through 108.00 and gets close to decent option expiry interest layered from 107.80 (1.2 bn) to 107.70-65 (1 bn) before losing some momentum, while the Kiwi is consolidating strong recovery gains above 0.6650 after yesterday’s overnight stop or error trade induced spill and now eyeing NZ manufacturing PMI for independent inspiration. Elsewhere, the Franc is not far from 0.9850 and the Pound has reclaimed 1.2500+ status with more conviction, though could be hampered by 500 mn expiries at the strike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/EUR -</strong> The Aussie has also bounced firmly from lows and a probe under key Fib support with the aid of diverging RBA/Fed policy outlooks, as the former shifts to neutral or wait-and-see mode following back-to-back 25 bp eases. Aud/Usd is hovering around 0.6975 and seeking further guidance/direction from RBA’s Debelle later today. Similar story for the Loonie following Wednesday’s BoC meeting that revealed more caution and downside risks to base-line assessments and forecasts, but ultimately maintained an on hold stance, with Usd/Cad settling lower after knee-jerk moves and currently pivoting 1.3050. Continuing the Central Bank theme, ECB minutes could undermine the single currency if dovish enough, as Eur/Usd stalls ahead of 1.1300 having breached 1.1250 and the 200 DMA (1.1255), while decent option expiries lying between 1.1290-1.1300 (1.3 bn) may also prove tough to overcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEK/TRY -</strong> The Swedish Krona has crossed a key chart level in the form of the 100 DMA at 10.5920 vs the Euro in wake of mixed inflation data, as the core CPIF measure that strips out energy prices accelerated and is seen keeping the Riksbank on track to raise the repo around the turn of the year. Conversely, the Turkish Lira is bucking broad trends and underperforming yet again amidst a ramp up in EU angst over Turkey’s ongoing drilling off the coast of Cyprus, and in particular the threat of more restrictive measures. Usd/Try up around 5.6670 within 5.6900-6590 parameters and compared to Usd/Zar sub-13.9300.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p><strong>Gilts </strong>are now lagging core counterparts and probing fresh Liffe intraday lows at 130.90, with no obvious catalyst for the reversal from new session highs forged earlier (131.39), although <strong>Bunds</strong> are also sagging having breached chart support around 172.43 a while ago and then attempting to regroup. The latter now testing/breaking another downside technical level around 172.29 at 172.17, with <strong>US Treasuries</strong> down in sympathy and the curve steepening ahead of CPI and long bond supply. Perhaps BTP outperformance is weighing on the 10 year German benchmark, while comments from ECB’s Coeure do not look that influential at face value in the run up to minutes, so this looks more like a recoil from Powell part one in case he tweaks dovish overtones during take 2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> have remained modestly firmer in what has been a quiet session thus far. The complex continues to derive support from the weather situation in the Gulf of Mexico where most recently the NHC are expecting the disturbance to become a tropical depression today; in terms of the impact, yesterday it was reported that 32% of the Gulf’s production has been halted, with the Gulf representing around 15% of the US’ total production. Additionally, the OPEC monthly report is scheduled for release today (12:10 BST) and for reference on Tuesday the EIA cut 2019 oil demand growth view to 1.07mln BPD, -150k BPD.</p><p><strong>Gold (+0.3%)</strong> is continuing to benefit from the softer post-Powell dollar, with the yellow metal now firmly above the USD 1400/oz level having printed a session high of USD 1427/oz. This mornings dollar drive strength from gold is likely being derived from market pricing now indicating around a 25% chance of a 50bp cut at July’s FOMC meeting, as such today’s inflation metrics and the second set of comments from Chair Powell may well prove pertinent for the yellow metal. Elsewhere<strong>, copper</strong> prices are little changed after yesterdays dollar driven rally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>Furthermore, participants focused on global risks and discussed \"at some length\" soft business investment data from Q2</strong>, while many attached significant odds to less favourable outlooks than their base case of continued growth and strong hiring. <strong>Many also noted that growth and inflation risks had shifted \"notably\" in the weeks leading up to the meeting and are now \"weighted to the downside\".</strong></p><p>ASIA-PAC</p><p><strong>Asian equity markets traded positively as the region took advantage of the tailwind from the US where a dovish testimony by Fed Chair Powell kept the door open for a July rate cut</strong>, which lifted all major US indices to all-time highs and the S&amp;P 500 to briefly above the monumental 3000 level for the first time ever. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.5%)</strong> was led higher by commodity-related sectors after gold surged back above the USD 1400/oz level and oil prices rallied around 4% on bullish inventory data, but with the gains limited by initial weakness in financials after APRA advised an increase in minimum capital requirements of AUD 500mln each for 3 of the Big 4 banks and as Westpac faces legal proceedings in New Zealand for allegedly breaching the Credit Contracts Act. <strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.5%)</strong> were marginal as the upbeat momentum was partially offset by a firmer currency, while <strong>Hang Seng (+1.1%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) </strong>advanced with energy names frontrunning the outperformance in Hong Kong and as sentiment was also underpinned after China announced to take measures to stabilize trade as well as lower import tariff levels. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked the moves in T-notes in the aftermath of Powell’s dovish testimony, but with upside limited amid gains in stocks and weaker demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated JGBs.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 100bln.

(Newswires)</p><p>UK/EU</p><p><strong>BoE's Tenreyro said a small amount of policy tightening will likely be needed in the event of a smooth Brexit</strong> and that if a Brexit deal is reached, a stronger GBP would ease inflation pressure especially given the prospects of looser policy abroad. <strong>Tenreyro added she does not see inflation pressures picking up in the next few months</strong> but noted that core inflation metrics still stable and that there are few signs of weakness in inflation expectations, while the labour market remains tight.

(Newswires)</p><p>Germany's transatlantic coordinator Peter Beyer said Europe should brace for US tariffs on several fronts in the months ahead, adds Trump administration seems poised to impose tariffs on aircraft subsidies, European auto imports and the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> remained pressured and slipped below the 97.00 level following Fed Chair Powell’s dovish testimony. As such, price action in its major counterparts have all been driven by the softer greenback with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> holding above the 1.1200 and 1.2500 handles respectively, while <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> retreated below 108.00 which pressured JPY-crosses in sympathy. Antipodeans also continued to edge marginal gains due to their high-beta characteristics and as a lack of key data releases meant there was little to shift the status quo of broad USD weakness.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mostly higher overnight as the positive risk tone and weaker greenback underpinned <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures above USD 60.00/bbl to extend on the prior day’s 4% rally, which was spurred by a much larger than expected drawdown in EIA crude inventory report and amid evacuations in the Gulf of Mexico where at least 32% of production was halted due to a looming cyclone. Geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran remain another bullish factor on prices as there were reports that Iran Revolutionary Guards attempted to seize a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz but then backed off after a warning from a Royal Navy warship, which Iran denied. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> continued to benefit in the aftermath of Powell’s dovish testimony which had jolted the precious metal back above the USD 1400/oz level, while <strong>copper</strong> was steady overnight as it took a breather after the prior day’s rally was halted by resistance at USD 2.70/lb.</p><p><strong>US Gulf of Mexico crude oil production was reportedly cut by 32% (a 603k BPD cut)</strong> with 15 platforms and 4 rigs evacuated and three rigs moved ahead of the storm, according to the US government. NHC said heavy rains and flooding is already occurring over portions of southeast Louisiana and repeated that a tropical cyclone is expected to form on Thursday over Gulf of Mexico. (Newswires)</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US Defense Official said Iranian Revolutionary Guards attempted to seize a British oil tanker in the Persian Gulf but was unsuccessful</strong>. According to reports, 5 boats thought to be Iranian approached the British oil tanker and asked it to stop in nearby Iranian waters but then backed off after a warning from a British warship, although Iran’s Revolutionary Guard later denied it attempted to stop the British oil tanker.

(Twitter/Yonhap)<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The curve bull-steepened after Fed Chair Powell’s testimony to lawmakers left the door open for a rate cut at the July policy meeting. In wake of Powell’s testimony, money markets now price around 68bps of easing through the year end (it was around 51bps pre-Powell’s testimony). Crucially, the prospects of a double rate cut are being priced back in, after the markets priced them out in wake of the solid NFP report last week; markets now see an approximately 25% of a double cut – that had fallen to around 2.5% after the payrolls data. After the testimony, the US sold 10-year notes at 2.057%, a poor auction which tailed by 0.7bps, and on cover beneath recent averages. Dealers had the highest takedown since October 2018. At settlement, major curve spreads were wider, with the most notable steepening seen in 2s30s, which was greater than +11bps on the session. US T-note futures (U9) settled 4+ ticks higher at 127-14.</p><p><strong>Fed's Bullard (Voter, Dove)</strong> said at the moment he would support a 25bps rate cut but 50bps is too much and that he has pencilled in another rate cut before year end but is dependent on the economy.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade positive as the region gets a tailwind from US where a dovish testimony by Fed Chair Powell kept the door open for a July rate cut, which lifted all major US indices to all-time highs and the S&amp;P 500 to briefly above the monumental 3000 level for the first time ever. ASX 200 (+0.2%) is led higher by commodity-related sectors after gold surged back above the USD 1400/oz level and oil prices rallied around 4% on bullish inventory data, but with the gains limited by weakness in financials after APRA advised an increase in minimum capital requirements of AUD 500mln each for 3 of the Big 4 banks and as Westpac faces legal proceedings in New Zealand for allegedly breaching the Credit Contracts Act. Elsewhere, gains in the Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) are marginal as the upbeat momentum is partially offset by a firmer currency, while Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) outperform with energy names frontrunning the advances and as sentiment is also underpinned after China announced to take measure to stabilize trade as well as continue to lower import tariff levels.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remained pressured and slipped below the 97.00 level following Fed Chair Powell’s dovish testimony in which he made numerous references to uncertainty and noted there is a risk weak inflation will be even more persistent than what the Fed anticipates, while he also suggested that the June employment report did not fundamentally change the Fed's outlook which dispelled expectations the Fed may hold back following the recent strong job numbers. As such, price action in its major counterparts have all been driven by the softer greenback with EUR/USD and GBP/USD holding above 1.1200 and 1.2500 handles respectively, while USD/JPY retreated below 108.00 which pressured JPY-crosses in sympathy. Antipodeans also continue to edge marginal gains due to their high-beta characteristics and as a lack of key data releases meant there was little to shift the status quo of the broad USD weakness.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track the upside in T-notes in the aftermath of Powell’s dovish testimony, but with upside limited amid gains in stocks and ahead of an enhanced liquidity auction.</p>",
