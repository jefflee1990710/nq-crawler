        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 1 March 2019: Stocks shrug of slate of weak US data",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities up, dollar up, Treasuries down, crude down.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: </strong>US data weak,<strong> </strong>Canadian GDP miss, Kudlow and Ross positive on tariffs; Barnier ready to give UK guarantees.</p><p><strong>* NEXT WEEK: </strong>ECB, RBA, BOC Rate Decisions, Australian Building Approvals, Business Inventories &amp; Company Profits, UK Construction PMI, EZ Sentix Index, US Construction Spending, Earnings from Salesforce</p><p><strong>* US ISM MANUFACTURING (FEB):</strong> It was a disappointing report, with all of the major components falling and/or missing expectations, with little silver lining to take away. \"The softness of the report is disappointing after the hefty rebounds in the Chicago PMI and Richmond Fed surveys, but none of the regional reports are consistently reliable guides to the national picture,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said. \"The bigger story here is that US manufacturing is being pulled into the mire by the rollover in Chinese manufacturing, which is not over yet.\" Pantheon sees further downside for he ISM over the next few months. \"In the meantime, the message is that we have to expect falling manufacturing output and declining durable goods orders, which will be a drag on GDP growth via weaker business capex. The strength in business investment in the Q4 GDP numbers won’t be sustained. Payroll growth likely will slow a bit too, though manufacturing accounts for only 9% of payrolls. Sill, for the next few months the manufacturing data will make it look as though the Fed’s dovish lurch was the right move, though we maintain that a rethink will come in the middle of the year when the headwinds - trade, Brexit, China’s cycle, and the fading of domestic stimulus - have diminished and the tightening labour market rises up the list of policymakers’ concerns.\"</p><p><strong>* US PERSONAL INCOME AND SPENDING: </strong>The data for December showed consumer spending ending the year on a soft note, with consumption falling 0.6% in the month (cons +0.3%), and personal income falling by 0.1% (cons +0.3%). \"Consumer spending momentum entering Q1 looks very sluggish,\" Oxford Economics says, \"The 0.1% decline in income growth in January is not overly worrisome, however, since it follows a strong 1% gain in December. Looking at the broader trend, both income and spending retain solid momentum with their latest annual pace at 4.3% y/y and 2.2% respectively.\" The consultancy also says that while today's data confirms that the economy entered 2019 with less momentum than anticipated, the reported collapse in spending is hard to square with the underlying fundamental health of the consumer sector,\" and looking ahead, it continues to expect slower economic activity, but cautions against a recession bias. Meanwhile, the consultancy notes that PCE inflation continues to hover around the Fed's 2% target with core inflation up 0.2%, keeping the annual pace unchanged at 1.9% y/y. \"The headline PCE deflator continued to drift lower in December, up just 0.1% on the month while the annual pace slipped to a 14-month of 1.7% y/y,\" and \"given contained inflationary pressures, the Fed's bar for implementing another rate hike this year remains relatively high.\"</p><p><strong>* CANADA GDP:</strong> Canadian GDP printed 0.4% annualised in Q4 2018, missing expectations of 1.2% (and the BOC's forecast of 1.3%); the monthly December figure was down 0.1% for the second straight months. The data was a disappointment, and will only reinforce the flat pricing of the BOC rate hike trajectory in 2019. \"Much of&nbsp; the&nbsp; softening can&nbsp; be&nbsp; traced back&nbsp; to what we&nbsp; expect will&nbsp; ultimately&nbsp; be&nbsp; transitory weakness&nbsp; in&nbsp; the oil &amp; gas sector, although household spending growth also continued to slow,\" RBC said.</p><p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Friday showed little substantial updates on the China/US trade front. NEC Director Kudlow said tremendous progress has been made in talks and that the tariff strategy has helped in them. US Commerce Secretary Ross echoed this viewpoint later on saying that the US could use tariffs and quotas to enforce a deal.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May told European Council President Tusk that Brexit may have to be delayed even if MP's support her deal, as more time will be required to implement the necessary legislation. There is growing rumours that PM May’s meaningful vote for her Brexit deal might be delayed too, where Downing Street insiders said they do not think the vote will be held next week. In late trade, EU Brexit Negotiator Barnier said EU is ready to give UK further guarantees that the Irish backstop is temporary; one possibility, Barnier said, was a commitment to limit the backstop through an agreement on future relationship.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 1.42 LOWER AT USD 55.80/BBL; BRENT (J9) FUTURES SETTLED USD 1.24 LOWER AT USD 65.07/BBL. </strong>Crude prices ended the week in the red after a slew of disappointing economic data in a market that has been reluctant to rally. The week began by giving up YTD highs on the back of US President Trump tweeting his dissatisfaction for rising oil prices, before paring back losses throughout the week, supported by bullish US inventory data, but as of Friday, prices reversed and tested the weekly lows seen on Monday. “Some of the blame could be shared with weakness in February manufacturing PMI data across the globe, with China, Japan, and the Euro Zone all below 50 this month and the US weaker than in January”, analysts at Citi commented in regard to Friday’s sell-off. The supply side of the equation has been remarkably bullish this week, growing signs of commitment to the OPEC+ deal, the ongoing force majeure at Libya’s El Sharara oil field, a Nigeria cutting output in the back drop of its oilfields under looming threat from the Niger Delta Avengers, and a remarkably bullish inventory release from the DOE, reporting a draw of over 8mln bbls in a time of year that usually experiences rising stockpiles; despite all these factors, the market failed to breach above the pre-Trump tweet highs. In news flow today: Russian oil production in February was 97k BPD lower than the October reference level of 11.415mln; Libya's NOC state that El Sharara is still unsafe, but is technically ready to lift the force majeure; Russia’s Lukoil have agreed at a meeting to reach the OPEC+ cuts targets in April. Baker Hughes showed oil rigs down by 10 at 843, gas rigs up by 1 at 195, leaving total rigs down by 9 at 1038.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.7% at 2804, NDX +0.8% at 7151, DJI +0.4% at 26029. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +1.5%, Materials 0.0%, Industrials +0.2%, Cons Discretionary +0.9%, Cons Staples -0.2%, Healthcare +1.4%, Financials +0.5%, Tech +0.7%, Telecoms +0.7%, Utilities +0.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Gap (GPS) made double digit gains on Friday on its earnings report where it announced the plans to split the company into two publicly traded stocks, alongside other cost cutting measures. Tesla (TSLA) opened lower after CEO Musk announced the co. would unlikely be profitable in Q1 and lowering its price on its pinnacle Model 3 vehicle. Foot Locker (FL) surged on the open by beating top and bottom line estimates and reporting 9.7% comparable sales; supplier Nike (NKE) also followed suit. Marriott International (MAR) opened lower following a disappointing revenue figure and lowering its guidance. eBay (EBAY) made gains after initiating strategic measures in tandem with activist investors Elliot and Starboard. Caesars (CZR) was an outperformer on the announcement of three new board members supported by investor Carl Icahn. Amazon (AMZN) announced plans to launch a new low cost grocery chain, supermarket stocks (WMT, KR, TGT,COST) dipped on the news.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 10 TICKS LOWER AT 121-14.</strong> T-Note were sold, and benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose around 5bps on the day, taking it to the key 2.75%. Much of the afternoon was categorised by rangebound price action, but in later trade the complex caught another wave of selling; many would have expected the T-Note to be bought after a bout of weak data out of the US, however, there may be a few factors explaining both the USD’s upside as well as the T-Note’s downside: firstly, the Fed is going no where anytime soon, with policy data-dependent and the central bank in wait and see mode, rates or the buck are not likely to garner much influence from monpol in absence of a new directional cue; second, as we have pointed out previously, a low FX vol environment (combined with rising stocks) can be a good backdrop for carry strategies (favouring the USD); and third, traders note that next week’s macro docket may see dovish updates from the ECB, possibly RBA and possibly even the BOC, which may end up favouring USD.</p><p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The index looks set to end another roller-coaster week on an even keel following a firm end to February and solid 1st session of the new trading month. Upbeat or above forecast Q4 GDP helped the Greenback regain 96.000+ status from a 95.817 low, and then a stellar Chicago PMI prompted accelerated recovery gains to almost 96.400 before several G10 counterparts managed to turn the tide again. Note also, Fib resistance at 96.441 may have prevented the DXY from pushing on further and retesting highs of the week at 96.604, also posted on Monday. Back to fundamentals, Fed chair Powell’s 2 part testimony and Q&amp;As hardly impacted the Usd as he merely reinforced policy patience due to crosswinds and conflicting impulses, but did prompt relatively pronounced bear-steepening along the Treasury curve that in turn underpinned the Buck, and particularly vs the Jpy plus other safe-haven or carry currencies.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> As noted above, the Yen has been a major loser vs the Usd and more broadly, with the headline pair back in lock-step with diverging JGB/UST spreads amidst some weak Japanese data and mainly dovish BoJ commentary as Governor Kuroda conceded no or little chance of hitting the 2% inflation target in FY 2020. Indeed, Usd/Jpy rose from a base of 110.34 to just a few pips shy of 112.00 after clearing a multiple top and purported heavy export offers at 111.00 in the process, on top of the 200 DMA. Meanwhile, the Eur/Jpy cross also jumped on Friday after news that MUFJ is planning to buy the aviation unit of Germany’s DZ Bank for Eur5.6 bn, and breached an upside chart level on the way towards 127.50.</p><p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Another net G10 laggard, but more volatile and actually outperforming its US peer for parts of the week as oil prices rebounded. However, the Loonie suffered a sharp decline on Friday ahead of Canadian GDP data (which was released early on some vendors for the record), and more so after. For the record, q/q annualised growth came in at 0.4% vs 1.2% expected and the BoC’s 1.3% forecast, while for the month of December alone the economy contracted 0.1% and prices slumped 0.8% to virtually extinguish already faint rate hike expectations for next week. Usd/Cad is just off a new 1.3252 peak for the week vs 1.3110 at one stage.</p><p><strong>* EUR/GBP:</strong> The single currency and Sterling have bucked the broader trend and remain on course to register strong gains vs the Dollar and other rivals, although in cross terms the Pound is winning out on latest Brexit developments from a UK standpoint. Eur/Usd has survived several set-backs/wobbles to revisit 1.1400 amidst some better than of late Eurozone surveys/data and less dovish sounding ECB rhetoric vs so called ‘source’ reports ahead of next Thursday’s policy meet. Meanwhile, Cable has soared from 1.3039 at worst to circa 1.3350 at best after a significant volte-face from UK PM May on the contentious issues of a no deal withdrawal from the EU and the March 29th Article 50 deadline that will now be put before Parliament if her current deal is rejected again. On that note, the next meaningful vote was delayed yet again from this Thursday to March 12, or perhaps some time before (Wednesday March 6th has been touted) with the no deal and extension votes to follow on consecutive days thereafter.</p><p><strong>* AUD/NZD: </strong>The Antipodean Dollars have suffered due to multiple negative/bearish factors, including local data, dovish RBA and RBNZ vibes/guidance and external headwinds, like ongoing weakness in China’s manufacturing PMIs (official and Caixin both still sub-50, albeit the latter rebounding to just below the growth-contraction threshold). Aud/Usd is now around 0.7100 within 0.7198-0.7082 trading parameters and Nzd/Usd is hovering just above 0.6800 from 0.6901 and 0.6794 at the extremes.</p><p><strong>* SEK/NOK: </strong>Contrasting fortunes for the Scandi Crowns, as the Sek emerges from a volatile 5 days with decent gains vs the Eur and outperforming its Nok neighbour. The catalysts/rationale, significantly stronger than expected Swedish Q4 GDP and relatively hawkish/upbeat Riksbank minutes that maintain guidance for a repo hike in H2 this year. Eur/Sek off lows and back above 10.5000, but still well down from near 10.6000 highs vs Eur/Nok at 9.7500 against a 9.7900-7000 approximate band.</p><p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong> <strong>Monday: </strong>US Construction Spending (Dec)<strong> Tuesday: </strong>RBA Rate Decision, Spanish Parliament dissolves, Eurozone Markit Composite &amp; Services PMI (Final), Eurozone Retail Sales, US ISM non-Mfg, PMIs, US New Home Sales (Dec) <strong>Wednesday:</strong> BoC Rate Decision, Fed's Beige Book, Australian GDP, US &amp; Canada Trade Balance (Dec), US Factory Orders, US New Home Sales (Jan) <strong>Thursday:</strong> ECB Rate Decision, Australian Retail Sales &amp; Trade Balance, US &amp; Canada Trade Balance (Jan) <strong>Friday: </strong>US &amp; Canadian Labour Market Report.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21289/download\">Click here for full briefing.</a></p><p><strong>* Central Bank Weekly:</strong> Previewing ECB, RBA, BOC, CBRT; Reviewing Powell Testimony. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21290/download\">Click here for full briefing.</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Crude prices ended the week in the red after a slew of disappointing economic data in a market that has been reluctant to rally. The week began by giving up YTD highs on the back of US President Trump tweeting his dissatisfaction for rising oil prices, before paring back losses throughout the week, supported by bullish US inventory data, but as of Friday, prices reversed and tested the weekly lows seen on Monday. &ldquo;Some of the blame could be shared with weakness in February manufacturing PMI data across the globe, with China, Japan, and the Euro Zone all below 50 this month and the US weaker than in January&rdquo;, analysts at Citi commented in regard to Friday&rsquo;s sell-off. The supply side of the equation has been remarkably bullish this week, growing signs of commitment to the OPEC+ deal, the ongoing force majeure at Libya&rsquo;s El Sharara oil field, a Nigeria cutting output in the back drop of its oilfields under looming threat from the Niger Delta Avengers, and a remarkably bullish inventory release from the DOE, reporting a draw of over 8mln bbls in a time of year that usually experiences rising stockpiles; despite all these factors, the market failed to breach above the pre-Trump tweet highs. In news flow today: Russian oil production in February was 97k BPD lower than the October reference level of 11.415mln; Libya&#39;s NOC state that El Sharara is still unsafe, but is technically ready to lift the force majeure; Russia&rsquo;s Lukoil have agreed at a meeting to reach the OPEC+ cuts targets in April. Baker Hughes showed oil rigs down by 10 at 843, gas rigs up by 1 at 195, leaving total rigs down by 9 at 1038.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Dollar gets US GDP fillip, but Loonie flops due to feeble Canadian growth",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index looks set to end another roller-coaster week on an even keel following a firm end to February and solid 1st session of the new trading month. Upbeat or above forecast Q4 GDP helped the Greenback regain 96.000+ status from a 95.817 low, and then a stellar Chicago PMI prompted accelerated recovery gains to almost 96.400 before several G10 counterparts managed to turn the tide again. Note also, Fib resistance at 96.441 may have prevented the DXY from pushing on further and retesting highs of the week at 96.604, also posted on Monday. Back to fundamentals, Fed chair Powell’s 2 part testimony and Q&amp;As hardly impacted the Usd as he merely reinforced policy patience due to crosswinds and conflicting impulses, but did prompt relatively pronounced bear-steepening along the Treasury curve that in turn underpinned the Buck, and particularly vs the Jpy plus other safe-haven or carry currencies.</p><p><strong>JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, the Yen has been a major loser vs the Usd and more broadly, with the headline pair back in lock-step with diverging JGB/UST spreads amidst some weak Japanese data and mainly dovish BoJ commentary as Governor Kuroda conceded no or little chance of hitting the 2% inflation target in FY 2020. Indeed, Usd/Jpy rose from a base of 110.34 to just a few pips shy of 112.00 after clearing a multiple top and purported heavy export offers at 111.00 in the process, on top of the 200 DMA. Meanwhile, the Eur/Jpy cross also jumped on Friday after news that MUFJ is planning to buy the aviation unit of Germany’s DZ Bank for Eur5.6 bn, and breached an upside chart level on the way towards 127.50.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>Another net G10 laggard, but more volatile and actually outperforming its US peer for parts of the week as oil prices rebounded. However, the Loonie suffered a sharp decline on Friday ahead of Canadian GDP data (which was released early on some vendors for the record), and more so after. For the record, q/q annualised growth came in at 0.4% vs 1.2% expected and the BoC’s 1.3% forecast, while for the month of December alone the economy contracted 0.1% and prices slumped 0.8% to virtually extinguish already faint rate hike expectations for next week. Usd/Cad is just off a new 1.3252 peak for the week vs 1.3110 at one stage.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The single currency and Sterling have bucked the broader trend and remain on course to register strong gains vs the Dollar and other rivals, although in cross terms the Pound is winning out on latest Brexit developments from a UK standpoint. Eur/Usd has survived several set-backs/wobbles to revisit 1.1400 amidst some better than of late Eurozone surveys/data and less dovish sounding ECB rhetoric vs so called ‘source’ reports ahead of next Thursday’s policy meet. Meanwhile, Cable has soared from 1.3039 at worst to circa 1.3350 at best after a significant volte-face from UK PM May on the contentious issues of a no deal withdrawal from the EU and the March 29th Article 50 deadline that will now be put before Parliament if her current deal is rejected again. On that note, the next meaningful vote was delayed yet again from this Thursday to March 12, or perhaps some time before (Wednesday March 6th has been touted) with the no deal and extension votes to follow on consecutive days thereafter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars have suffered due to multiple negative/bearish factors, including local data, dovish RBA and RBNZ vibes/guidance and external headwinds, like ongoing weakness in China’s manufacturing PMIs (official and Caixin both still sub-50, albeit the latter rebounding to just below the growth-contraction threshold). Aud/Usd is now around 0.7100 within 0.7198-0.7082 trading parameters and Nzd/Usd is hovering just above 0.6800 from 0.6901 and 0.6794 at the extremes.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the Scandi Crowns, as the Sek emerges from a volatile 5 days with decent gains vs the Eur and outperforming its Nok neighbour. The catalysts/rationale, significantly stronger than expected Swedish Q4 GDP and relatively hawkish/upbeat Riksbank minutes that maintain guidance for a repo hike in H2 this year. Eur/Sek off lows and back above 10.5000, but still well down from near 10.6000 highs vs Eur/Nok at 9.7500 against a 9.7900-7000 approximate band.</p>",

The Dow was weighed on by UnitedHealth shares which trimmed around 50 points off the index, meanwhile Nasdaq was pressured as heavyweights Facebook, Apple and Netflix all fell over 0.5%. In terms of February performance, Dow rose 3.7%, S&amp;P gained 3.0% and Nasdaq advanced 3.4% in the month. ASX 200 (+0.4%) extended on opening gains as IT and healthcare names led the advances, whilst heavy-exporter Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) outperformed on the back of a weaker domestic currency. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp (+1.8%) was choppy as the third straight month of contraction in China&rsquo;s manufacturing sector capped upside in the index, despite MSCI quadrupling China A-share weightings in global benchmarks to 20%. Goldman Sachs estimates that the MSCI move would lead to a potential USD 70bln net buying in A-shares, skewed towards the healthcare and consumer sectors. Finally, Hang Seng (+0.6%) edged higher during the session as the index felt support from its heavy-weight financial and energy sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set the CNY mid-point at 6.6957 (Prev. 6.6901) (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC drains a net CNY 40bln on the day</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Caixin Manufacturing PMI (Feb) 49.9 vs. Exp. 48.5 (Prev. 48.3); third month of contraction (Newswires)<br />China New orders 50.2 (Prev. 47.3); highest in three-months</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MSCI are to boost China A-shares weighting in global benchmarks to 20% from 5% in three steps.

Dax (+1.0%) is the outperforming index with all components in the green on the positive risk sentiment following concerns over China&rsquo;s economy being somewhat alleviated after Chinese Caixin manufacturing PMI came in stronger than expected; as such the Auto sector is outperforming its peers. Other notable movers include Rheinmetall (+7.3%) leading the Stoxx 600 after the Co&rsquo;s FY18 revenue was in-line with expectations. WPP (+8.2%) are also firmly in the green in-spite of the Co&rsquo;s outlook for 2019 being rather downbeat, particularly regarding the first half, as they reported results that marginally beat on expectations. Elsewhere, Man Group (-4.2%) are towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after stating that their funds under management fell in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY- Although the Dollar has pared some of its post-GDP and Chicago PMI gains vs certain major counterparts, the index has rebounded further from sub-96.000 lows towards 96.400, largely at the expense of safe-haven currencies, and especially the Jpy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - No respite for the Yen after yesterday&rsquo;s slide through 111.00 and accelerated losses below the 200 DMA as US Treasury yields continue to rally and the 10 year benchmark clears 2.70% in wake of the aforementioned stronger than forecast data and survey news. Usd/Jpy is now just a whisker away from the next big figure where more offers are touted, and with key Fib resistance residing not far above at 112.08.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP - Also victims of the broad Greenback revival, but the former unwinding more of its safe-haven premium as well, with the Franc back under parity vs the Buck and below 1.1350 against the Euro. Meanwhile, Cable&rsquo;s pull-back from recent Brexit no deal highs has extended to 100+ pips and not far from Fib support around 1.3215, with little reaction or independent direction gleaned from a bang in line with consensus UK manufacturing PMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has pulled back further from best levels too (1.1400+), but holding up relatively well amidst mixed Eurozone data and perhaps with the aid of hefty option expiry interest at the 1.1350 level for today&rsquo;s NY cut (2 bn) plus M&amp;A news that has lifted Eur/Jpy very close to a key Fib. On that note, the 30 DMA in Eur/Usd at 1.1363 could also be influential on a closing basis along with 0.8593 in Eur/Gbp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD/AUD - All on a firmer footing vs their US peer, and particularly the Loonie that has rebounded strongly from sub-1.3200 lows on Thursday ahead of Canadian GDP data and gleaning some traction from steadier oil prices. Usd/Cad is currently near the bottom of a 1.3132-77 range, and a big option expiry between 1.3140-50 may also have a bearing on trade given 1.4 bn rolling off later today. Meanwhile, the Kiwi and Aussie have both managed to regain composure and round number status after falling below 0.6800 and 0.7100, with some comfort drawn from the overnight Caixin Chinese manufacturing PMI that was sub-50 again, but not as weak as the official version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several more twists and turns in bonds as debt markets kick off the new month rather indecisively, but with an offered tone for choice. Indeed, Gilts embarked on a deeper downturn from 125.87 Liffe highs in wake of the UK PMI and BoE data, albeit belatedly, to a marginal new intraday low of 125.67 before finding more underlying bids, while Bunds continue to meaner between 165.12-38 and the Eurozone semi-core/periphery underperform (slightly) in wake of France&rsquo;s wider January budget shortfall and Spain joining Italy on the contractionary manufacturing PMI front. Elsewhere, it&rsquo;s a bit deeper and steeper for the US Treasury curve as attention shifts to personal income, spending, the Fed&rsquo;s preferred core PCE price measure, Markit/ISM manufacturing surveys and the final Michigan sentiment readings for February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (U/C) and WTI (+0.1%) prices are essentially flat, in-spite of trading positively overnight and initially during the European session, although they are once again trading within a fairly narrow range of less than USD 2/barrel. Elsewhere, since the imposition of US sanctions on the 28th January on Venezuelan oil, Venezuela&rsquo;s oil exports have dropped by 40% for the month to around 920k BPD. Separately, Lukoil have agreed to reach the OPEC+ targets in April, and Rosneft&rsquo;s VP state that they fully comply with the pact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.3%) is weaker as the USD moves higher recouping recent losses, with the yellow metal hitting a two-week low and currently trading around USD 1306/oz; however, analysts do highlight that the metal has strong support at the USD 1300/oz level. Elsewhere, copper weakened following China printing a 3rd month of contraction in their Caixin Manufacturing PMI, although the metal did recover as the figure was above expectations and risk sentiment remained positive. Separately, Goldman Sachs trade ideas include Long Dec&rsquo;19 copper vs. Dec&rsquo;19 zinc, Long jun&rsquo;19 and short June&rsquo;20 aluminium.</p>\r\n",

Dax (+1.0%) is the outperforming index with all components in the green on the positive risk sentiment following concerns over China&rsquo;s economy being somewhat alleviated after Chinese Caixin manufacturing PMI came in stronger than expected; as such the Auto sector is outperforming its peers. Other notable movers include Rheinmetall (+7.3%) leading the Stoxx 600 after the Co&rsquo;s FY18 revenue was in-line with expectations. WPP (+8.2%) are also firmly in the green in-spite of the Co&rsquo;s outlook for 2019 being rather downbeat, particularly regarding the first half, as they reported results that marginally beat on expectations. Elsewhere, Man Group (-4.2%) are towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after stating that their funds under management fell in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY- Although the Dollar has pared some of its post-GDP and Chicago PMI gains vs certain major counterparts, the index has rebounded further from sub-96.000 lows towards 96.400, largely at the expense of safe-haven currencies, and especially the Jpy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - No respite for the Yen after yesterday&rsquo;s slide through 111.00 and accelerated losses below the 200 DMA as US Treasury yields continue to rally and the 10 year benchmark clears 2.70% in wake of the aforementioned stronger than forecast data and survey news. Usd/Jpy is now just a whisker away from the next big figure where more offers are touted, and with key Fib resistance residing not far above at 112.08.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP - Also victims of the broad Greenback revival, but the former unwinding more of its safe-haven premium as well, with the Franc back under parity vs the Buck and below 1.1350 against the Euro. Meanwhile, Cable&rsquo;s pull-back from recent Brexit no deal highs has extended to 100+ pips and not far from Fib support around 1.3215, with little reaction or independent direction gleaned from a bang in line with consensus UK manufacturing PMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has pulled back further from best levels too (1.1400+), but holding up relatively well amidst mixed Eurozone data and perhaps with the aid of hefty option expiry interest at the 1.1350 level for today&rsquo;s NY cut (2 bn) plus M&amp;A news that has lifted Eur/Jpy very close to a key Fib. On that note, the 30 DMA in Eur/Usd at 1.1363 could also be influential on a closing basis along with 0.8593 in Eur/Gbp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD/AUD - All on a firmer footing vs their US peer, and particularly the Loonie that has rebounded strongly from sub-1.3200 lows on Thursday ahead of Canadian GDP data and gleaning some traction from steadier oil prices. Usd/Cad is currently near the bottom of a 1.3132-77 range, and a big option expiry between 1.3140-50 may also have a bearing on trade given 1.4 bn rolling off later today. Meanwhile, the Kiwi and Aussie have both managed to regain composure and round number status after falling below 0.6800 and 0.7100, with some comfort drawn from the overnight Caixin Chinese manufacturing PMI that was sub-50 again, but not as weak as the official version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several more twists and turns in bonds as debt markets kick off the new month rather indecisively, but with an offered tone for choice. Indeed, Gilts embarked on a deeper downturn from 125.87 Liffe highs in wake of the UK PMI and BoE data, albeit belatedly, to a marginal new intraday low of 125.67 before finding more underlying bids, while Bunds continue to meaner between 165.12-38 and the Eurozone semi-core/periphery underperform (slightly) in wake of France&rsquo;s wider January budget shortfall and Spain joining Italy on the contractionary manufacturing PMI front. Elsewhere, it&rsquo;s a bit deeper and steeper for the US Treasury curve as attention shifts to personal income, spending, the Fed&rsquo;s preferred core PCE price measure, Markit/ISM manufacturing surveys and the final Michigan sentiment readings for February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (U/C) and WTI (+0.1%) prices are essentially flat, in-spite of trading positively overnight and initially during the European session, although they are once again trading within a fairly narrow range of less than USD 2/barrel. Elsewhere, since the imposition of US sanctions on the 28th January on Venezuelan oil, Venezuela&rsquo;s oil exports have dropped by 40% for the month to around 920k BPD. Separately, Lukoil have agreed to reach the OPEC+ targets in April, and Rosneft&rsquo;s VP state that they fully comply with the pact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.3%) is weaker as the USD moves higher recouping recent losses, with the yellow metal hitting a two-week low and currently trading around USD 1306/oz; however, analysts do highlight that the metal has strong support at the USD 1300/oz level. Elsewhere, copper weakened following China printing a 3rd month of contraction in their Caixin Manufacturing PMI, although the metal did recover as the figure was above expectations and risk sentiment remained positive. Separately, Goldman Sachs trade ideas include Long Dec&rsquo;19 copper vs. Dec&rsquo;19 zinc, Long jun&rsquo;19 and short June&rsquo;20 aluminium.</p>\r\n",

Returning to Liffe, the 10 year UK benchmark began Friday’s session flat at 125.79 and then slipped to 125.69, but has subsequently erased losses and rebounded to 125.87 before topping out, while the Short Sterling strip is now flat to a fraction firmer vs 0.5-1 tick below yesterday’s closing levels at one stage. No obvious catalyst or rationale for the modest turnaround, but perhaps some pre-9.30GMT hedging/betting for a weak manufacturing survey/data?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian equities started the final trading day of the week on an optimistic note, despite a relatively downbeat session on Wall Street where the three main indices closed lower by around three-tenths of a percent. The Dow was weighed on by UnitedHealth shares which trimmed around 50 points off the index, meanwhile Nasdaq was pressured as heavyweights Facebook, Apple and Netflix all fell over 0.5%. In terms of February performance, Dow rose 3.7%, S&amp;P gained 3.0% and Nasdaq advanced 3.4% in the month. ASX 200 (+0.5%) extends on opening gains as IT and healthcare names led the advances, whilst heavy-exporter Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) is supported by a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp (+0.1%) failed to hold onto opening gains as the third straight month of contraction in China&rsquo;s manufacturing sector weighed on the index, despite MSCI quadrupling China A-share weightings in global benchmarks to 20%. Goldman Sachs estimates that the MSCI move would lead to a potential USD 70bln net buying in A-shares, skewed towards the healthcare and consumer sectors. Finally, Hang Seng (+0.3%) held onto gains thus far as the index felt support from its heavy-weight financial and energy sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX Markets are quiet thus far as DXY remained near post-GDP highs and was little moved by comments from Fed Chair Powell who reaffirmed the central bank&rsquo;s patient stance and reiterated that the US economy is in a good place. As such EUR/USD is little changed after finding some support at 1.1365, albeit the pair remains below its 50 DMA at 1.1388 (ahead of EZ inflation data) and similarly, GBP/USD is uneventful but stays above 1.3250. Elsewhere, the release of above-forecast China Caixin manufacturing PMIs gave the AUD/USD some impetus to rise to session highs, although gains were pared back as China&rsquo;s manufacturing sector failed to come out of contraction territory.</p>\r\n",
