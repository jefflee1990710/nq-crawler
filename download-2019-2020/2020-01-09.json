If tensions in the Middle East pushes up oil prices the US will be more resilient in the face of any energy shock.

The session started off with a horizontal/downward bias, though a solid 30-year auction brought out the buyers. The auction itself stopped through the screens by a hefty 1.7bps, with analysts noting positive internals, where cover rose to a two-year high of 2.53x; dealer take-down was below recent averages, direct takedown was in line with recent averages, while the indirect bid was slightly above. Following the calming of geopolitical risk on Wednesday, which at the very least removes any immediate threat of military escalation between the US/Iran, and along with decent ISM services data and an ADP jobs report that surprised to the upside on Wednesday, the conditions appear to be in place to allow Treasury shorts to resume, desk noted. Some desks also suggest that rate unlocking in the corporate space has also added to the upward bias in yields.</p>",

US President Trump has said Iran hitting the commercial aircraft was likely a mistake, occurring amid Iran’s rocket strike in the Green Zone, Iraq. More generally, despite Trump opting to avoid escalating military tensions in the Middle East on Wednesday, it is clear the proxy wars between US and Iran are in full swing. Late Wednesday, there were more rocket attacks in Baghdad's Green Zone near the US embassy (no US casualties reported), highlighting that a serious risk of military escalation remains, although it was interesting that markets chose to look-through the attack, despite the rockets landing only 100m from the US embassy. Wednesday's attack in Baghdad was attributed to the Shiite militia Asaib Ahl al-Huq, which had threatened retaliation over the killing of the deputy head of the Iraqi Kataib Hezbollah militia, Stratfor said. Additionally, on Thursday, a senior IRGC commander said that Iran would take harsher revenge on the US soon. There was also another strike against a US-affiliated airbase North of Baghdad, Balad, in the latter part of the session, local police reported that the rockets hit near the base rather than directly on it, although the fresh strike saw some pickup in energy prices and some volatility in US equity futures.</p><p><strong>* INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Weekly data showed initial jobless claims falling 9k to 214k, beneath the consensus 220k. Analysts note that the spike in early December, seeing claims rise to 252k, has now fully reversed, which suggests seasonal factors may have been in play over the holiday period, rather than a sharp deterioration in the labour market. It has also been noted that the deterioration in business surveys has not filtered through into layoffs. Attention now focusses on Friday's employment situation report.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW: US EMPLOYMENT SITUATION REPORT (FRIDAY):</strong> The Street looks for a sub-trend 164k payroll additions in December; the ADP data presents some upside to the consensus view, some argue. The unemployment rate seen unchanged, though some gauges suggest downside. The annual pace of wage growth is seen steady, though the monthly rate is seen picking-up. Business surveys are mixed: ISM data shows some cooling of labour market momentum, though its Markit counterpart has picked up – services employment rose at the fastest pace since July, manufacturing employment saw the second best reading since May. Job cuts data augurs well, with the monthly total having fallen to the lowest since July 2018.

On policy, rate cuts last year were well-timed, and supported the economy. Strong labour market is not putting any undue pressure on inflation; repeats economy in a good place, inflation still muted but expected to rise. On repo-operations, said Fed will adjust details of repo operations as appropriate, though ongoing purchases may be needed at least through April. <strong>Fed's Kashkari (voter, dove)</strong> said business investment is low due to tariff uncertainty, where an improvement in trade tensions could support gains in optimism; doesn't see a recession in the next few years. Kashkari added that the Fed is in a much better position to lift inflation now that rates are on pause; sees a pause in rates for the foreseeable future, dependent on the inflation outlook. The Minneapolis Fed President added that he is not concerned about low rates causing corporations to take on too much debt, but is more concerned with banks holding the debt, and wants to ensure they have enough capital. <strong>Fed's Kaplan (voter)</strong> said current rates are the roughly appropriate setting; sees between 2% to 2.25% growth in 2020, saying outlook has \"firmed\" in recent weeks, if anything; expects unemployment to fall further and inflation rising to the 2% goal. When mulling a potential rate change, Kaplan said the Fed will look at growth, inflation and financial stability. Kaplan is willing to tolerate inflation above 2%, but also cognizant of financial stability; open to longer-term averaging for the inflation target but does not want it as a \"commitment\". Kaplan wants to actively explore options to limit the growth in the balance sheet; doesn't want the balance sheet to fuel instability.<strong> Fed's Evans (non-voter, dovish)</strong> said the US economy is in a very good place, with rates in the right place to support it; expects employment growth to decelerate over time; sees inflation reaching 1.9% this year (in-line with Fed median dot plot), with current rates supporting inflation. <strong>Fed's Bullard (non-voter, dove)</strong> said he is content where rates are currently, and the Fed should asses the lagged effects of the recent rate moves. Bullard favours the standing repo facility as a long-term solution, which he believes could help keep the balance sheet from growing too large. Bullard said there is reasonable chance of a soft landing in the US in 2020 due to the fast growth of 2018 and 2019's risks; businesses are remaining profitable despite trade uncertainty. On recent geopolitics, Bullard said that if tensions in the Middle East push up oil prices, the US will be more resilient in the face of any energy shock.</p><p><strong>* US-CHINA: </strong>China confirmed that Vice Premier Liu He will visit the US between 13-15th January to sign the Phase One trade deal. The nation's media had previously been reticent to confirm the visit officially. Other information was scant.</p><p><strong>* WTI (G0) SETTLED USD 0.05 LOWER AT USD 59.56/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 0.07 LOWER AT USD 65.37/BBL. </strong>Energy markets traded choppy on Thursday to settle little changed. The benchmarks spent most of the earlier session on the back foot until reports suggested the Ukrainian flight that crashed in Iran had potentially been shot down by an Iranian missile. Additionally, further reports of more missile attacks near US-affiliated bases in Iraq brought bidders to the market in the latter part of the session reversing some of the earlier losses.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.64% at 3274; NDX +0.87% at 8990, DJI +0.74% at 28957.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Boeing (BA) had a relief rally amid evidence emerging that its 737-800 jet, which fatally crashed in Iran, was due to it being hit by a missile rather than a technical fault with the jet.

Goldman Sachs (GS) was supported by upgrades at both BofA and Berenberg; the higher yields also helped the wider financial sector (XLF, BKX) and Citi (C) was awarded the “Pick of the Decade” title from BofA too. AMD (AMD) surged after an upgrade at Mizuho upgraded the stock to Buy on an optimistic view of the server market. Tesla (TSLA) pared some of its recent rally as the share price flirts with USD 500; Baird also suggested investors hold a neutral stance and take profits. eBay (EBAY) opened on the back foot amid a downgrade at Jefferies, citing survey data that suggests the platform is losing consumer interest. Align Technology (ALGN) was an outperformer amid an upgrade to Outperform at Wolfe Research. Archer Daniels Midlands (ADM) and McCormick (MKC) suffered from downgrades at Monness Crespi and UBS, respectively. Ross Stores (ROST) benefitted from a PT rise at Cowen, citing inventory availability and improving macro backdrop. Mylan (MYL) underperformed amid a Neutral initiation at Piper Sandler and cautious comments at RBC.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 4 TICKS HIGHER AT 128-28+. </strong>The Treasury curve bull-flattened on Thursday. The session started off with a horizontal/downward bias, though a solid 30-year auction brought out the buyers. The auction itself stopped through the screens by a hefty 1.7bps, with analysts noting positive internals, where cover rose to a two-year high of 2.53x; dealer take-down was below recent averages, direct takedown was in line with recent averages, while the indirect bid was slightly above.<strong> </strong>Following the calming of geopolitical risk on Wednesday, which at the very least removes any immediate threat of military escalation between the US/Iran, and along with decent ISM services data and an ADP jobs report that surprised to the upside on Wednesday, the conditions appear to be in place to allow Treasury shorts to resume, desk noted. Some desks also suggest that rate unlocking in the corporate space has also added to the upward bias in yields.</p><p><strong>* BOC GOVERNOR POLOZ:</strong> When asked about recent weak data, Poloz cited strikes and bad weather as contributing factors. On inflation, he said it has been very close to the 2% target, which if on target, the bank can treat every shock symmetrically. Poloz said it seems potential downside risks of the trade dispute have eased as the US and China approach a deal; remains to be seen if trade policy improvements feed through to economy recovery and investment. Further on trade, he said the USMCA deal will remove a large source of uncertainty for many Canadian firms once ratified; BoC is looking for signs that the trade dispute is affecting sectors outside of those which heavily export, with recent data mixed. Poloz also said that perhaps the lesson is not to ignore what markets tell you, but also consider they are prone to exaggeration; the bank is watching the labour market to see if the recent moderation in strength persists. On the housing market, Poloz said that if the rebound strengthens, the BoC will be looking for signs of froth; demand seems to be outpacing the ability to build new homes.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> As BOE Governor Mark Carney heads for the door at Threadneedle Street, he presented an overview of the potential policy routes facing the UK under the current framework. The most widely-covered excerpt from his speech was where he noted that \"at present, there is sufficient headroom to at least double the August 2016 package of GBP 60bln asset purchases, a number that will increase with further gilt issuance. That would deliver the equivalent of around a 100bps cut to the Bank Rate on top of the near 75 basis points of conventional policy space\". All-in-all, the Governor concluded that the above suggests the combined policy space (when considering conventional and unconventional measures) would amount to equivalently around the 250bps of rate cuts that was seen in pre-crisis easing cycles. These comments were covered in an abbreviated form by major news vendors and were perhaps presented in a more suggestive manner than those made by Carney himself, who appeared to take a relatively even-handed approach when discussing interest rates. Nonetheless, markets took his overall speech as dovish with focus also placed on a comment highlighting \"debate within the MPC over the merits of near-term stimulus to reinforce the anticipated recovery in UK growth and inflation\". However, this shouldn't have come as too much of a surprise given the two dovish dissenters at the December meeting. With regards to the economic outlook, Carney noted the fragility of economic forecasts given the current uncertainties faced by the UK economy by stating \"rebound forecast by the BoE for the UK economy this year is not assured\". Overall, it could be argued that markets over-reacted to Carney's comments given the actual tone of the speech as a whole and the qualifications behind some of his statements; notwithstanding that, the Governor will be leaving the BOE in March, and thus, his comments should naturally carry less weight than they otherwise would. That said, the narrative surrounding policy at the Bank has titled in a more dovish direction following his remarks.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Analysts note that Brexit risk has returned, after the UK recently legislated against extending the transition period beyond the end of this year. The first major battle between the EU and the UK is likely to be on the sequencing of trade talks. On Wednesday, new EU Commission President Von Der Leyen said time was tight to achieve a full trade agreement by the end of the year, and that any 2020 deal would likely be a narrow goods free trade agreement, with some scope for equivalence for services. Analysts speculate that the EU will push for trade talks to initially focus on goods and fishing rights, while the UK will want talks to take place on services equivalence. If negotiations fail, Politico reports that there might be a limited sector-by-sector approach from the EU, and although the EU would not prefer that strategy, since it might remove the EU's negotiating advantage, the UK would welcome it, setting the two sides on course for contentions negotiations; these risks are likely to materialise around March, when trade talks begin.</p><p><strong>* UK RETAIL:</strong> BRC data revealed that, since 1995 when it began publishing its retail survey, 2019 was the first year to show a full-year decline in retail sales, at -0.1% Y/Y. Other data on Thursday from Barclayscard showed spending rising by an annualised 1.0% in December.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* CHINA CPI (DEC):</strong> Consumer prices rose by 4.5% Y/Y in December, unchanged and beneath the consensus 4.7%. The pace of pork prices eased in the month. Some have noted that inflation will likely tick up again in January, due to seasonal effects around the Chinese New Year. However, pork prices are the key, with some arguing that if these stabilise further, the PBOC might have less concerns about lowering rates (NOTE: recall, China's Premier Li signalled lower rates for small enterprises, in his December speech). After the PBOC's recent RRR cut, which it says will release around CNY 800bln of liquidity to the banking system, desks now speculate that authorities may trim rates for the wider economy too, and focus is on the MLF and LPR rates, which could be cut in the weeks ahead. NOTE: Full-year CPI for 2019 came in at 2.9%, a touch beneath the government's 3.0% annual target.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION (NOV):</strong> +1.1% M/M, beating the expected +0.8%, and the Y/Y rate ticked up to -2.6% against a revised -4.6% in October. While the data looks good, relative to consensus, desks have noted that other survey data still looks soft, suggesting that momentum might not be sustained. Nevertheless, some desks said that the apparent rebound might continue into Q1 lifting GDP growth, but is due to base effects.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN TRADE DATA (NOV):</strong> Exports declined 2.3% M/M, reversing October's 1.5% rise. Imports were down 0.5% in the month. The trade surplus narrowed to EUR 18.2bln from EUR 20.4bln.</p><p><strong>* FX:</strong> <strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The <strong>USD</strong> continued its upside, jobless claims did little to sway price action, DXY found resistance at 97.55 ahead of tomorrows NFP report. <strong>EUR</strong> was slightly firmer against the buck, with heavy option exiries in play around today’s NY cut, where 1.7bln rolled off at 1.1090-1.11, and 1.5bln at 1.1110-15. <strong>GBP</strong> saw initial downside after apparently dovish comments from BoE Governor Carney, who noted a reasonable judgement of combined conventional and unconventional policy space is around 250bps of easing. The <strong>CAD</strong> continued to lose ground, given the geopolitical risk premium pricing out of rude, which saw USDCAD briefly cross 1.31 to the upside, helped by broad dollar strength; CAD regained some ground against the buck after comments from Poloz who was optimistic on trade. <strong>CNH: </strong>Little reaction seen as pace of CPI growth slowed; traded sideways for the majority of US trade. <strong>USDJPY</strong> tested 109.50 to the upside as JPY continued to ease, with technicians eyeing December’s high 109.72 as the next key level to watch ahead of Friday’s jobs report, and the reduced geopolitical tensions. <strong>Gold</strong> continued to fade the recent geopolitically induced gains, finding support around USD 1,445 from overnight highs at 1,561 as Middle East tensions continue to ease. <strong>AUD</strong> was relatively unreactive to the overnight trade balance data, which saw a wider surplus than the previous and the expected. The <strong>Kiwi</strong> was the G10 laggard, continuing to fall after a weak ANZ commodity price index, which fell 2.8%. <strong>EMFX</strong> was weaker amid the broad dollar strength, with the exception of TRY, which is benefiting from falling oil prices. <strong>MXN</strong> was slightly weaker; data showed inflation falling, down to 2.83% Y/Y from 2.96% (Banxico’s target range is 3%). Weak industrial output added to <strong>BRL’s</strong> weakness, a 1.2% and 1.7% decline M/M and Y/Y respectively in November.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ZAR</strong> was softer amid poor manufacturing production data for November, which saw a 3.6% fall Y/Y and 1.5% fall M/M retracing some of the prior month’s gains.</p>",

The bank also notes that the current WI is trading below the last two auction stop-out rates, which could indicate relative richness, compared to those auctions. The December 30-year auction saw healthy demand, stopping through by a whopping 2.1bps, and ending the run of tails. SocGen also notes that 5s30s has steepened since the previous auction cycle, which might speaks to the relative cheapness of the sector.

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding several wobbles and a few more broadsides from Iran threatening further retaliation, the Buck has held relatively firm and the index remains on course to continue its recovery towards the next bullish technical marker above 97.500 (having surpassed the 97.552 pre-NY break peak from December 27 at 97.562). US data has been supportive again on paper as initial claims fell more than forecast, albeit not in the survey week for Friday’s NFP, but the Greenback has largely benefited at the expense of others and another general improvement in risk appetite (on a combination of perceived less ME war threat and confirmation that Phase 1 of the US-China trade agreement will be signed off next Wednesday).</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>Not quite a nosedive, but the Kiwi has extended overnight losses (post-a weak ANZ commodity price index) throughout Thursday’s EU session to the point where it is now the biggest G10 laggard, with Nzd/Usd teetering over the 0.6600 handle and Aud/Nzd closer to 1.0400 than 1.0300, as the Aussie continues to hold above 0.6850 vs its US counterpart with some assistance from trade data revealing a wider than anticipated surplus.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also on the back foot, as the Yen succumbs to more safe-haven unwinding and in danger of losing the prop of buying interest around 109.50, while Sterling has had dovish sounding remarks from BoE Governor Carney to contend with alongside the aforementioned broadly bid Usd. However, Cable is off worst levels and trying to keep eyes on 1.3050, while Eur/Gbp has drifted down from 0.8530 ahead of the 4 pm fix, unlike Usd/Cad that is eyeing/testing 1.3100 offers following yet more poor Canadian data and with crude reversing even more of its geopolitical/supply related premium. Note, BoC’s Poloz is due to speak later and could acknowledge the recent spate of disappointing economic releases.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>Narrowly mixed and therefore comparative ‘outperformers’, as the Franc and Euro both attempt to contain losses against the Dollar around 0.9725 and 1.1100 respectively, with the Eur/Chf cross straddling 1.0800 accordingly. To recap, hefty option expiries either side of the big figure stalled the steady Eur/Usd descent, while Swiss retail sales were somewhat mixed/inconclusive.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Bucking the recent trend, Usd/Try has held below 5.9000 for the most part as the Lira takes comfort from the latest (and pronounced) leg down in oil prices against the grain of most other Dollar/EM pairings that have rebounded from recent lows. However, the Yuans are back in the ascendency and probing fresh multi-month highs beyond 6.9200 at one stage for the Cnh on the news that a time and date has been set for the White House trade deal signing event noted above.</p>",

The narrative appears to be pivoting back towards the Phase One US-China deal which is expected to be signed in Washington next week, although there is skepticism on the agricultural purchases that China will actually make given it has recently said it would not raise the grain quota limit, and more recently its fresh purchase of soy beans from Brazil instead of the US.</p><p>Ahead of the NFP report on Friday, the data front has been thin in the US today aside from the jobless claims, which came in less than expected, which marks another positive labour market data release this week (after the strong ADP report) which has lead some analysts to warm to the view that the NFP figure on Friday could surprise to the upside (exp. 164k jobs added). Although the labour market looks to be resilient, its relevance to Fed policy is becoming more minute, where officials have stressed any consideration of a rate hike would only be considered once inflation moves higher in a sustained manner; conversely if the NFP report was to miss strongly to the downside, officials are much more attentive to the trend rather than single data points.

This strength comes as comments from US President Trump yesterday intimated a de-escalation in tensions, more information available in the Commodity section below. This morning’s notable outperformer is the <strong>Dax</strong>, with the cash bourse having printed a high above the 13500 mark; marking a significant retracement/turnaround from the weeks low below the 12950 level, an over 500 point range already for the index. Sector wise, energy is this morning’s notable underperformer, on the aforementioned de-escalation in tensions in-line with the broader crude complex. Energy aside, the remaining bourses are in positive territory for the session. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 this morning are Marks &amp; Spencer (-9.4%), after providing a Q3 and Christmas Period trading update; in which, they did note that gross margins are expected at the lower-end of guidance, but this should be offset.

Meanwhile, Usd/Chf is trapped in a tight 0.9732-47 range following stagnant Swiss retail sales data (y/y) and Usd/Cad awaits Canadian housing starts and building permits before a late speech from BoC chief Poloz within 1.3026-56 confines, while Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek are both firmer circa 9.8700 and 10.5200, tracking overall risk sentiment, oil prices and for the Norwegian Krona also taking on board rather tepid monthly mainland GDP.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Most regional currencies are basking or at least benefiting from the ongoing scale down of geopolitical angst, and Turkey’s Lira is delighted with the related retracement in crude costs that should aid efforts to bring inflation back to target ahead of schedule and allow the CBRT to normalise rates further.

The bank also notes that trend-chasing CTA's were \"flummoxed\"; CTAs brought their net buying of gold futures to a halt yesterday, although the sustained uptrend in gold futures prices meant that they did not go so far as to start scaling back the net long position they have accumulated in the aggregate.</li><li>With that said, Nomura says that gold futures prices could conceivably drop back below $1,500 (depending on what other investors do), in which case CTAs would become more likely to start downsizing their aggregate net long position.</li><li>The bank estimates that CTAs cut aggregate net longs in WTI crude by more than half, led mostly by loss-cutting executed in response to the rapid fallback in oil prices.

S&amp;P 500 futures prices briefly dipped below 3,200 yesterday, and with then staged a steep rebound. \"Once futures prices had climbed back above the trigger line at around 3,200, CTAs similarly did an about-face and flocked back to net buying in intraday trading,\" the bank says, \"the result (according to our estimates) is that CTAs' cumulative net long position in S&amp;P 500 futures lurched sharply upward.\" Nomura suggests that thiswas not isolated to the S&amp;P 500 futures market; the same thing seems to have happened in NASDAQ 100 futures and DJIA futures.</li><li><strong>Those three indices have now risen back above Nomura's estimates of the average entry points for long positions accumulated by CTAs since the beginning of December (3,235 for the S&amp;P 500, 8,775 for the NASDAQ 100, and 28,600 for the DJIA). \"</strong>CTAs, sitting on unrealized gains, therefore remained inclined to continue chasing these markets up,\" the bank says. However, the same is not true for the R2K futures, where CTAs continued to defensively close out long positions at an easy pace. (Nomura estimates that CTAs’ purchases of Russell 2000 futures since the beginning of December break even at around 1,660 on average.)</li><li>\"Although systematic rather than discretionary, sustained buying flow by trend-chasers nevertheless does the job of supporting market supply-demand,\" Nomura writes, \"we note in particular that when algorithmic traders are chasing the market up in the manner they now are, the stock market tends to take on at least a surface appearance of being resistant to risk-off sentiment,\" adding that \"this appearance, in turn, tends to stoke optimism among fundamentals-oriented investors.\"</li><li>But, Nomura thinks it is also wise to pay attention to what looks like overcrowding in trend-chasing investors' strategy of accumulating long positions in US equities.</li><li>\"In theory, trend-following algos can continue to increase their exposure (through pyramiding or leveraging up) for as long as the market uptrend continues, but in practice, however, steep stock market gains powered by supply-demand tend to become divorced from fundamentals, and position herding among trend-following investors leaves the market sensitive to even minute shocks, raising the risk of the accumulated positions being liquidated in a rapidly unfolding chain reaction.\"</li><li>Nomura believes the uptrend in the S&amp;P 500 looking stretched, and CTAs’ accumulated net long position is starting to look shaky. So why has the market continued its seemingly untethered rise? \"We would point to the tailwind provided on the liquidity front by factors including the Fed’s accommodative monetary policy. We also suspect that more than a few investors with an optimistic longer-term scenario in mind have remained inclined to keep up their buying of US stocks.\" But, the bank still thinks that anyone contemplating staking out fresh long positions from here may want to consider waiting until trend-following investors have let some pressure out of the system by paring their positions, as this would lessen the risk of getting hit by an unexpected drawdown.\"</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The great Greenback revival continues, albeit gradually, with the <strong>DXY </strong>nudging through 97.500 having picked off the next upside chart objectives at 97.344 and 97.350 to target December 27’s 97.552 high set before the broad Dollar was beset by portfolio selling for year end. The Buck is still forging gains or clawing back losses vs major rivals, and in particular those currencies deemed to be safer havens, with only a minor blip caused by several incendiary Iranian remarks earlier today, as investors take comfort from the fact that Tehran’s strike back did not irk US President Trump to the extent of further action beyond more sanctions.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Unexpectedly dovish commentary from BoE Governor Carney has pushed the Pound down to the bottom of the G10 rankings, as he raises some doubt about the anticipated 2020 economic recovery and reveals that the MPC is mulling whether it needs to help via additional stimulus. Moreover, he believes there is room to restart QE within a wider easing package equating to 250 bp and the APF more than twice the size of August 2016’s Gbp60 bn. Cable had already given up 1.3100+ status around the 9 am fix as Eur/Gbp squeezed up towards 0.8500, but Sterling declines subsequently extended to sub-1.3020 and circa 0.8530 respectively.</p><p><strong>NZD/JPY/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi and Yen are also underperforming, as Nzd/Usd retests support/bids ahead of 0.6600 and Usd/Jpy probes offers/supply into 109.50. However, the former appears weak partly, if not mainly due to relative Aussie resilience near 1.0350 and 0.6850 vs its US peer in wake of a much wider than forecast trade surplus, while the latter may yet be drawn back down towards a very large option expiry at 109.25 (2.4 bn).</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/CAD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>All softer against the Greenback or Euro in the case of the Scandi Crowns, but to varying degrees with the single currency and Franc holding up a bit better than others even though Eur/Usd has pulled back further from recent highs and into a heavy option expiry interest zone spanning the 1.1100 level (1.7 bn from 1.1090 to the round number and 1.5 bn between 1.1110-15). Meanwhile, Usd/Chf is trapped in a tight 0.9732-47 range following stagnant Swiss retail sales data (y/y) and Usd/Cad awaits Canadian housing starts and building permits before a late speech from BoC chief Poloz within 1.3026-56 confines, while Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek are both firmer circa 9.8700 and 10.5200, tracking overall risk sentiment, oil prices and for the Norwegian Krona also taking on board rather tepid monthly mainland GDP.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Most regional currencies are basking or at least benefiting from the ongoing scale down of geopolitical angst, and Turkey’s Lira is delighted with the related retracement in crude costs that should aid efforts to bring inflation back to target ahead of schedule and allow the CBRT to normalise rates further.

Ahead, more hefty supply to absorb and a couple of ECB speakers after more pre-NFP US jobs proxies and Fed rhetoric.</p>",

Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> futures pulled back from yesterday’s highs as a rise in Australia’s exports of the base metal to China eased some steel-mill demand concerns.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US President Trump stated that the US has achieved energy independence, and that helps to shape its response; added that US does not need Middle East oil.

(Newswires)</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLE TICKS 12+ LOWER AT 128-24+</strong>. Yields were higher across curve, with a very slight steepening bias, inspired by improving geopolitics in the Middle East, while on the data slate, ADP payrolls surprised to the upside. The US 10-year auction tailed by a chunky 1.6bps basis – the largest since August. However, analyst noted that this was likely a function of geopolitics, which saw 10-year yields drop to as low as 1.7050%, before rising back towards around 1.85% heading into the auction. The rest of the metrics fared better, with cover coming in at 2.45x, a touch above the previous and recent averages. In terms of the breakdown, dealers took down slightly more than recent averages, as did direct bidders, leaving indirects with a takedown below recent averages. SocGen thinks the 30-year sector appears slightly cheap in asset swap. The bank also notes that the current WI is trading below the last two auction stop-out rates, which could indicate relative richness, compared to those auctions. The December 30-year auction saw healthy demand, stopping through by a whopping 2.1bps, and ending the run of tails. SocGen also notes that 5s30s has steepened since the previous auction cycle, which might speak to the relative cheapness of the sector. The bank has a positive bias going into the auction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "subject": "ASIA-PAC MID-SESSION UPDATE: Stocks soar as US-Iran strains seem to be simmering down",
        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac bourses kicked off the session with firm gains across the board after a positive handover from Wall Street - which saw the Nasdaq Comp notching intraday and closing records, whilst the S&amp;P hit intraday all-times highs. Global sentiment is bolstered by what seems to be a simmering down in US-Iran tensions, with US President Trump also stating that the US is ready to embrace peace after saying that Iran appears to be standing down. US equity futures and cash experienced some losses heading into the Wall Street close amid reports of two rockets hitting Baghdad’s Green Zone near the US Embassy, although a negative sentiment failed to materialise as no casualties were reported. ASX 200 (+0.9%) gleans support from its largest weighted financial sector, but gains remain hindered as oil and precious metal names are pressured by recent price action in the respective complexes. Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) outperforms peers in the region as the index welcomes favourable JPY dynamics and with only a small fraction of its constituents in negative territory. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp (+0.6%) echo the performance in regional peers after the Mainland largely side-lined below-forecast Chinese CPI for a bulk of the session, with the Phase One deal signing with the US drawing closer.&nbsp;</p><p>In FX, DXY has been choppy within a tight intraday range amid a lack of overnight catalysts. The index briefly dipped below 97.25 from a current high of 97.30 ahead of its 50 DMA, seen around the 97.40. EUR/USD and GBP/USD remain uneventful above 1.1100 and around 1.3100 respectively and largely moving in tandem with the Dollar, with the former having found an overnight base at the round figure. EUR/USD sees hefty option expiries ahead of today’s NY cut with around EUR 1.0bln at 1.1090, EUR 980mln at 1.1110, EUR 650mln at 1.1125 and EUR 1.2bln at 1.1150. Elsewhere, USD/JPY continues to remain underpinned by the overall risk-appetite – with the pair having found some support at 109.00 after surpassing its 50 DMA and 50 WMA both around 108.93-94. Antipodeans trade within narrow parameters with AUD/USD still north of its 50 DMA at 0.6865 but failing to gain impetus from a substantially larger-than-forecast November trade balance figure led by a combination of higher exports and lower imports, potentially as economic impacts from the ongoing bush fires remain in mind.</p>",
