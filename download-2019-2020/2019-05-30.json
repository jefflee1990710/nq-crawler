Energy names, including Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) were under pressure as the crude complex slid. T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) both moved lower as news emerged pre-market that the US reportedly wants the two telecoms companies to help clear a path for a new wireless carrier with its own independent network, which would essentially create a new rival.

However, he said that China must make reforms for this to occur and urged China to release the two Canadian detainees. Turning to Huawei, Pence said the US sees Huawei as incompatible with its security needs and is working to promote alternatives. Switching trade fronts, US VP Pence commented that the US is making “energetic” efforts to pass the USMCA in Congress this summer, whilst Canadian PM Trudeau said Canada is seeking a good resolution with the US over lumber exports. Reports later emerged that US President Trump is to trigger a process that could accelerate the congressional vote on the USMCA, in direct opposition to House Speaker Pelosi. On the other side of the Pacific, punchy rhetoric from China continued; the ubiquitous (although hard to verify) Global Times editor said China and the US missed the chance for quick trade deal, and “before Huawei encountered US crackdown, many Chinese thought pressure of trade war could promote China’s reform and opening up. But now Chinese society is more supportive of government taking tough measures.” China's MOFCOM, in its daily briefing, said tariffs would not resolve trade imbalances, and that China would not accept any trade deal which hurts its sovereignty, or even its pride. The PBOC chief Yi Gang, meanwhile, reiterated the familiar (but increasingly important) view that the yuan “will remain very stable.” Returning to the will they, won’t they debate over whether China would weaponize rare earth exports to the US, China Global Times Editor weighed in; saying some people still do not believe that China will restrict rare-earth exports due to the self-harm it will cause but they don't understand China, including how information disclosure works.</p><p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Italy Deputy PM/League Leader Salvini ramped up political tensions, stating that he was ready to end the Italian government coalition if the Five Star party did not back his tax plans. Salvini is the League’s strong performance at the European elections as leverage to shape government policy. On Wednesday, Salvini stated his aim was not snap elections, and today reiterated there would be no early elections; however, it seems he is holding that veiled threat above lawmakers’ heads. Salvini today said that he hopes his coalition partner Di Maio remains as Five-Star Chief, otherwise the two parties “have no time to waste.” On the tax reforms themselves, Salvini said that the proposals should please markets, and his aim was to present them by Autumn. He also added that the budget will be passed in September. His comments saw the Bund/BTP yield spread widen to over 280bps (vs around LOD around 277bps, and vs 267bps at the close on Friday). Salvini also stated that the government will reply to the EU's warning letter on high Italian debt, and will cite data which will avoid disciplinary procedures.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong>&nbsp;Fed's Clarida (voter, neutral) said the US economy is in a good place, where the Fed is close to achieving its dual mandate. Clarida said that&nbsp;if the inflation shortfall becomes persistent, the Fed would take that into account, and is prepared to adjust the balance sheet normalisation if conditions warrant. Fed's Quarles (voter) said financial stability risks must be incorporated into monpol decision making. Quarles went on to say that current financial stability risks are not elevated but accommodative policy can increase financial stability risks.</p><p><strong>* BOC’S WILKINS: </strong>Wilkins reiterated a message of patience and made no reference to the BoC’s removal of the reference to returning to the neutral rate. Regarding trade, Wilkins noted that the bank sees potential for more trade friction between US/China and EU. Regarding the BOC’s take on the economy, she said the BOC is trying to square growth in jobs and wages with weakness in spending, and that the bank explains the mismatch by oil, gas and construction co's cutting hours. She said she expects Canadian business investment to expand gradually, specifically by firms outside the oil and gas industry; she added that overall inventories have increased, which may dampen production later in the year. In reference to the recent yield curve inversions, she said the BOC discussed the cues it should take from flat/inverted yield curve and that developments in the yield curve partly reflect the change in tone by central banks and investor appetite for long-term fixed income assets. Taking questions, Wilkins said there are upside and downside risks to the banks 1.2% forecast for growth in 2019 before revising her earlier trade comments, suggesting that trade tensions could ease and become an upside risk. Finally, when asked about whether language used around the decision on Wednesday was an attempt to push back against market expectations of a cut, Wilkins said what is important is what underpinned the decision.</p><p><strong>* US GDP: </strong>Q1 GDP was revised slightly lower to 3.1% (from the advanced 3.2%), mostly due to slower than previously expected capex. Analysts were surprised by the downward revision to the core PCE, to an annualized rate of just 1.0% from 1.3%. Tomorrow's PCE data will offer a timelier glimpse; Pantheon Macroeconomics predicts a solid rise of 0.2% in April, with 0.3% a distinct possibility as some of the technical factors (especially in the financial services components) which pushed down the Q1 core PCE, could reverse. The consultancy notes “inventories have always seemed likely to be a drag on Q2 GDP growth too, after their hefty 0.6ppts contribution in Q1, but the April increases were quite large, to which it attributes the fear of higher and broader tariffs which might trigger precautionary inventory-building in the late spring and summer. This, it says, might “pushing the day of reckoning into Q3.”</p><p><strong>* ADVANCE GOODS TRADE BALANCE: </strong>The advance April trade deficit rose slightly to USD 72.1bln from the (upwardly revised) USD 71.9bln in March, less than the consensus of USD 72.7bln. Meanwhile, wholesale and retail inventories rose by 0.5% and 0.7% respectively, better than the consensus of 0.2% and 0.1%. Pantheon points out that \"exports fell by 4.2% in April, led by big declines in capital equipment and autos, but imports dropped too, down 2.7% with declines in all the major components.\" The deficit excluding industrial supplies, which includes crude oil, rose by a very modest $0.4bln in April, and stands only $0.5bln above its Q1 average level, it observes, arguing that if this rate of deterioration continues, net foreign trade will subtract only a tenth or two from Q2 GDP growth, after adding 1.0 percentage points in Q1.</p><p>* <strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 2 TICKS HIGHER AT 125-22</strong>: Treasuries began Thursday on the backfoot, trading lower in the Asian and European session, before reversing course to settle approximately unchanged. A risk off US session helped spur bids in the T-plex, with the usual US-China trade talk deterioration dampening sentiment. The curve saw bull flattening on the day, with 30-year yields hitting 21-month lows, in addition to the 5-year yield testing the 2% handle.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL: </strong>The hawkish US National Security Advisor Bolton said on Thursday that the Iranian threat was not over, the quick response and deployment of US assets served to deter Iran; he added that evidence of Iran being behind the UAE Tanker attack several weeks ago will be presented to the UN Security Council early next week. US Special Envoy for Iran Brian Hook said that if the US is attacked by Iran, it has promised that it will respond in force, and it has positioned military assets within the region accordingly. Hook also said that the US will sanction any efforts to import Iranian Crude oil beyond the gap that was previously agreed to, reiterating there will be no additional waivers granted. Following the US accusing Russia of nuclear testing on Wednesday, Russia Foreign Ministry said the allegations were a crude provocation, and that Russia was not violating the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. In what will undoubtedly raise eyebrows in the US, Turkey said it was mulling the deployment of Russian missiles in the Mediterranean, where the US has been strongly opposed to Turkey purchasing the Russian S-400 missile defence system.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 2.22 LOWER AT USD 56.59/BBL; BRENT (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 2.58 LOWER AT USD 56.87/BBL:</strong> Crude markets accelerated their downward trajectory on the release of the EIA inventory data. The EIA showed US crude stocks drawing by 0.28mln bbls, less than the expected 0.86mln draw and substantially less than the API reported 5.3mln bbl draw. Distillates printed a surprise draw but gasoline stocks printed a larger surprise build; Cushing drew by 16K bbls. Production also did not support prices, with US production rising to 12.3mln bbls. Alongside the inventory data, several pipelines have come back online which were previously affected by severe flooding in the Mid-West. The WTI/Brent Arb narrowed earlier in the session, with Brent taking larger losses, before WTI caught up the losses going into settlement. The more bullish API data on Wednesday initially catalysed the narrowing, although analysts cite Brent’s July contract expiration on Friday likely to be dictating some volatility due to portfolios rolling into the August contract; some analysts noted some of the more cautious comments from Fed’s Clarida on the outlook were likely to be weighing down crude later in the session.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.2% at 2789, NASDAQ-100 0.4% at 7245, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0.2% at 25170</strong>; <strong>SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary 0.5%, Consumer Staples 0.3%, Energy -1.2%, Financials -0.5%, Health Care 0.5%, Industrials 0.4%, Information Technology 0.6%, Materials 0.1%, Telecommunication Services 0%, Utilities -0.1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>CBS Corp (CBS) and Viacom (VAIB) both spiked higher after news emerged that board members are preparing for upcoming M&amp;A talks to begin June. Verizon (VZ) moved lower after being downgraded to neutral from buy at UBS, where analyst John Hodulik commented, with the valuation back in-line with historical levels, Verizon's risk/reward is more balanced. Energy names, including Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) were under pressure as the crude complex slid. T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) both moved lower as news emerged pre-market that the US reportedly wants the two telecoms companies to help clear a path for a new wireless carrier with its own independent network, which would essentially create a new rival. In later trade, both momentarily spiked higher as news emerged that the two co.s may consider divesting airwaves to get the merger approved. PVH Corp (PVH) sunk after the co. revised down its earnings view for both Q2 and FY19. Dollar Tree (DLTR) moved higher after the merchandise store chain reported earnings that topped both top- and bottom-line earnings estimates. Citigroup (C) opened higher after an upgrade at Goldman Sachs, which sees a \"realistic path\" to a 13% ROTCE in 2020. American Tower (AMT) moved higher amid news that the company will acquire Eaton Towers Holding for roughly USD 1.85bln. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) extended on Wednesday’s losses, which were triggered as the apparel maker announced the closure of three of its flagship stores. Kraft Heinz (KHC) was under pressure after Credit Suisse lowered their PT for the co.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD: DXY </strong>consolidated beneath YTD highs, after largely shrugging off downwards revisions to Q1 core PCE and GDP figures, finishing the day relatively flat with comments from Fed’s Clarida failing to rock the boat. Attention now turns to tomorrow’s more timely April PCE figures to look for any clues if “dip in inflation was transitory”, as claimed by Fed in the most recent minutes. <strong>EUR </strong>was under pressure early amidst punchy talk from Italy’s Deputy PM Salvini and Economy Minister Tria, who continued to rally against EU fiscal rules, but finished the session fairly flat vs as DXY came of highs. Price action in <strong>GBP</strong> largely followed the single currency, the market largely ignoring micro updates regarding the state of the conservative leadership contest set to commence in June. <strong>JPY </strong>also finished the day flat vs USD, with risk sentiment mildly positive but FX majors largely directed by the dollar. <strong>CAD</strong> was fairly flat, managing to avoid being pulled lower with the crude complex and unresponsive to BOC Wilkins comments which were largely a reiteration of yesterdays policy meeting. <strong>TRY</strong> gained further ground since its recent break of the 6.0000 level, as an increase in CBRT international reserves (week on week) eased concerns.</p><p><strong>* MONTH-END: </strong>Citi's month-end FX hedge rebalancing model suggests moderate buying of USD. Bank says that, With the exception of USDJPY, the signal measures just over +0.5 historical standard deviations in all crosses. The bank notes that the relentless march of global equities this year was abruptly halted by a breakdown in trade talks between the US and China alongside a less dovish than expected Fed. The majority of developed market stock indices fell sharply this month, US equity markets are down just over 4% month-to-date. In contrast, most local currency bond indices have performed well, with the UK government bond index leading the pack. Citi's estimated signal to buy USD is predominately driven by equity investor rebalancing needs, the bank says, this is due to the negative US equity market performance leaving foreign investors over hedged on their equity assets. The signal to sell GBPUSD is strongest at -0.9 standard deviations, owing to the outsized increase in UK Government bonds fuelling the need to increase GBP hedges, and the USDJPY buy signal is weakest due to the assumption of lower foreign equity hedge ratios amongst Japanese investors. \"Overall, the signal does suggest USD strength into the month end fix,\" but the bank says that \"event risk comes in the form of Canadian and US economic releases close to the fixing time.\"</p><p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Morgan Stanley's analysts remain JPY bullish, but see risks of USDJPY moving towards 110.30/70 before heading lower (that zone is a \"technical sell\" the bank says), since there are increasing signs that global economic stress will eventually lead to JPY repatriation. \"While JPY has reported good gains against most currencies, its performance against USD has remained more muted against our expectations,\" MS writes, \"With G10 sovereign bond yields trading at significant yield disadvantages to the US or even worse slipping into negative-yielding territory, there seems to be no other hedge for risky assets besides US sovereign bonds, which differentiates the current situation from previous recessions, keeping USD supported for longer.\" That stronger dollar, the bank argues, has prevented JPY from flaling sub-109, and may be partly influenced by month-end factors. But even leaving those pressures asside, MS says that there is little scope for risky assets to head for an early rebound. The bank explains that global trade finance is predominantly USD-denominated, suggesting USD strength slowing global trade down further. And the USD 11.5trln foreign USD liability position weakens the balance sheets of USD-funded entities (a stronger USD increases the debt pile in local currency terms), and therefore reduces the collateral base for credit creation, which MS says suggests credit flows will slow, or will come at increasing costs as credit spreads widen.</p><p><strong>* ASIA FX: </strong>UBS expects CNY stability to support another Asia FX. The bank observes that, following the US' announcement of raised US tariffs on 5/May, USDCNY rose 2.4%, a move that had by 18/May reversed the gains made since October 2018; most other AsianFX sold off over the same window, with the exception of the won, by less than the CNY. \"In general other Asian currencies do not appear to be reflecting the risk that USDCNY rises significantly above 7.00,\" UBS says, and that \"the impact of more benign US interest rates, has allowed IDR, INR and PHP all to see more stability than in 2018, and these FX of the closed, c/a deficit economies outperformed open economy currencies. UBS adds that for INR, the strong election mandate would help stabilize for that currency.</p><p><strong>* BRL: </strong>GDP growth contracted by 0.2% Q/Q in Q1, in line with the consensus. It was the first contraction since the recovery began in 2017. Oxford Economics does not expect it to turn into a double-dip recession; \"Brazil’s contraction is part of a common theme in Latin America, with all the major economies either stagnating or contracting in Q1,\" OxEco says, \"the main culprit for the drop in Q1 was net trade; collapsing demand in Argentina accounted for nearly half the fall in exports, with negative implications for Brazil’s manufacturing.\"</p><p><strong>* ZAR:</strong> After the government's cabinet announcement was received poorly by markets, USDZAR rose to 7-month highs around 14.89; much of that move was retraced overnight; there are some suggesting that this was likely as market's digested the fact that tito Mboweni will remain finance minister, and former fin min Gordhan will also have a role as Public Enterprises minister (both of whom had faced opposition from labour unions). Some technicians see the ZAR moving to 15.12/15.20; however, Commerzbank says that the retracement could be an indication that the USDZAR highs were extreme, given that President Ramaphosa now has a Cabinet to push through his reforms.</p>",

The EIA showed US crude stocks drawing by 0.28mln bbls, less than the expected 0.86mln draw and substantially less than the API reported 5.3mln bbl draw. Distillates printed a surprise draw but gasoline stocks printed a larger surprise build; Cushing drew by 16K bbls. Production also did not support prices, with US production rising to 12.3mln bbls. Alongside the inventory data, several pipelines have come back online which were previously affected by severe flooding in the Mid-West. The WTI/Brent Arb narrowed earlier in the session, with Brent taking larger losses, before WTI caught up the losses going into settlement. The more bullish API data on Wednesday initially catalysed the narrowing, although analysts cite Brent’s July contract expiration on Friday likely to be dictating some volatility due to portfolios rolling into the August contract; some analysts noted some of the more cautious comments from Fed’s Clarida on the outlook were likely to be weighing down crude later in the session.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "FX Wrap: Dollar eyes PCE and month-end whilst Turkish delight keeps Lira in the limelight",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Dollar has held up relatively well throughout the day, albeit the index saw some short-lived downside following softer-than-forecast Q1 Core PCE numbers alongside a marginally wider trade deficit. The second GDP reading however was revised lower to 3.1% from 3.2% as expected. Eyes now turn to tomorrow’s April PCE figures to look for any clues if “dip in inflation was transitory” as the Fed stated in the most recent minutes. Nonetheless, the Dollar index is poised to closed closer to the top of todays 98.08-24 range heading into month end. As a reminder, Citi’s month-end FX hedge rebalancing model indicates moderate buying of the USD at month end, with the signal weakest against the JPY and strongest against GBP.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD, AUD, NZD</strong></p><p>The Loonie stands as the marked G10 outperformer, with a couple of factors in play: 1) potentially in consolidation post-BOC or 2) buoyed by WTI crude prices amid yesterday’s much wider-than-expected draw in API crude stocks. Meanwhile, the narrower-than-forecast Q1 Canadian current account deficit did little to faze the CAD due to a downward revision to the prior figure. USD/CAD is poised to conclude the EU session near the bottom of the 1.3486-1.3520 band. Meanwhile, the antipodeans have given up most of their earlier gains with little in the way of news-flow, although it is worth noting that the AUD and NZD may be gearing up for the overnight China Manufacturing PMI release which is expected to enter contraction territory (Exp. 49.9, Prev. 50.1). AUD/USD and NZD/USD are set to end the session closer to the bottom of their respective ~20pip intraday range.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP</strong></p><p>The Sterling and single currency were largely moving at the whim of the Buck. News-flow has been relatively light on the Brexit front, whilst the EUR was marginally dented by Italy’s Deputy PM Salvini who stated that he is ready to end the Italian coalition unless the 5-Star Movement approves his tax plans. As such, EUR/USD is set to end the European day near the bottom of today’s 1.1117-44 band, with German regional and national CPIs on tomorrow’s data slate. Similarly, Cable rests just above the 1.2600 handle, poised to end the EU session at the bottom of the 1.2605-39 range as the USD rests near HOD.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>The Yen and Franc have marginally unwound some risk premium, although the rising Buck may have also pressured the currencies. USD/JPY crept closer to the 110.00 mark to the upside (ahead of its 100 DMA just above 110.50) as the pair traded within a 109.50-92 intraday range thus far. Meanwhile, USD/CHF is set to end the EU session marginally in the green after clipping aforementioned resistance at 1.01. Looking ahead, Japanese Tokyo CPI and unemployment data will be released overnight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Turkish Lira remains the recent EM outperformer with initial upside attributed to a phone call between US President Trump and Turkish President Erdogan in which they agreed to meet on the side-lines of the June G20 Osaka meeting after Turkey released a NASA scientist from its prison. The TRY did feel a slight dent after reports that Turkey is mulling the deployment of Russian missiles in the Mediterranean, although it is unclear whether it involves the long-disputed S-400 missile system. USD/TRY is set to end the EU session near the bottom of today’s 5.8630-6.0257 range ahead of its 50 DMA at 5.8522.</p>",

This will help to prevent Cushing stock from building significantly.”</li><li><strong>API inventory data showed large draws in crude stocks.</strong> The delayed API data provided some relief to the crude complex after the bell on Wednesday, where crude stocks drew 5.27mln bbls, much larger than the expected 0.9mln bbls draw; in the products, distillates printed a surprise draw, whilst gasoline stocks a surprise build; inventories at the pinnacle Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub drew by 0.17mln bbls. Participants are now looking ahead to the official DoE release, where if the API is anything to go by, will mark the first draw in crude stocks in a month.</li><li><strong>Easing Mid-West supply fears are evident in calendar spreads.</strong> If the US supply disruptions were to materialise in Cushing stocks, it’s worth noting this would not be evident until next week’s inventory release due to the backward-looking nature of the data. However, the WTI M1/M2 has significantly been reduced since its heights on Wednesday, signalling that concerns have eased over US supply disruption.</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/36c853a2-9498-4a53-a942-343adf4751dc.jpg\"><figcaption>M1/M2 WTI calendar spread, <i>Source: Reuters</i></figcaption></figure>",

As such, <strong>ASX 200 (-0.7%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) </strong>were subdued following the weak lead from their global peers with only the telecoms sector bucking the trend in Australia, while sentiment in Tokyo continued to be hampered as <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> remained at a sub-110.00 level. <strong>Hang Seng (-0.4%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp.

While the defensive utilities and healthcare sectors are underperforming given the broad risk-on sentiment this morning. In spite of the positivity across bourses, notable individual movers are sparse. Axel Springer (+21.3%) have moved substantially higher following reports that KKR are to make a bid to take the Co. private, with the Co. having been valued at EUR 4.9bln. Separately, Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (+9.6%) have printed higher this morning post results, where they stated FY outlook is currently in-line with guidance. Also, post-earnings, but at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Johnson Matthey (-4.1%). Finally, Wirecard (1.3%) are at the top of the DAX (+0.6%) after announcing a strategic partnership with XBN relating to international e-commerce.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY - </strong>The broad Dollar and the index trades relatively flat thus far, albeit still north of the 98.000 level, as participants await a barrage of tier 1 US data in the form of Q1 GDP (2nd estimate), Core PCE, advances goods trade balance and initial jobless claims. DXY fluctuated between a reasonable 98.08-24 band for now, ahead of some mild resistance around the 98.37-40 mark. US-China news-flow has consisted of MOFCOM reiterations wherein the Chinese noted that tariffs will not solve trade imbalance and will not accept a deal which hurts sovereignty and pride. Nonetheless, focus of today will remain on the aforementioned US data with expectations for the GDP figure to be revised marginally lower (3.1% vs. Prev. 3.2%) whilst the Core PCE Q1 prelim figure is expected to be unchanged at 1.3% (FOMC noted that the recent dip in PCE is transitory) and initial jobless claims are expected to tick slightly higher to 215k from 211k. Elsewhere, Citi’s month-end FX hedge rebalancing model indicates moderate buying of the USD at month end, with the signal (ex-USD/JPY) measuring just over +0.5 historical standard deviations across all crosses.</p><p><strong>AUD,NZD,CAD - </strong>A firmer risk appetite or perhaps some consolidation from yesterday’s decline sees the risk currencies on a firmer footing this morning. AUD/USD has shrugged off the dismal Building Approval figures overnight ahead of the much anticipated RBA meeting next week. UBS believes the AUD is “too short for its own good” heading into the weekend, adding that “only a complete equity meltdown could drive the Aussie lower at this stage”. In terms of technicals, AUD/USD trades within a relatively tight 0.6917-36 range ahead of resistance at 0.6940. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is largely moving in tandem with its Aussie counterpart after showing little reaction to the NZ budget, in which it sees the 2018/19 cash balance at -2.785bln vs. the Prev. forecast of -4.993bln. NZD/USD also remains within a tight range with the antipodeans eyeing Chinese NBS Manufacturing PMI following the aforementioned US data. Elsewhere, the Loonie nurses some of yesterday’s post-BOC loses, with the aid of rising oil prices amid a much wider than expected build in crude stocks reported by APIs last night. In terms of technical, USD/CAD hovers around the 1.3500 mark having moved in a 1.3493-3520 range, with support flagged at 1.3490. Looking ahead for the CAD, current account data is due at 1330BST whilst BoC’s Wilkins is due to give a speech around 1930BST.</p><p><strong>EUR,GBP - </strong>Little changed and trading mostly at the whim of the Greenback amid tentative newsflow. EUR/USD remains within a tight 20 pip range (1.1125-45) with support flagged at 1.1125 and 1.1105. In terms of upside, resistance levels are noted at 1.1155 ahead of 1.1170 (with 1bln in option expiries at strike 1.1175-85). Similarly, the Pound has done little on the day thus far and GBP/USD remains within a 1.2612-39 band with little new to report on the Brexit front. Meanwhile, EUR/GBP is currently flat on the day around within a 0.8810-25 with resistance around 0.8845-50.</p><p><strong>CHF,JPY - </strong>Both safe haven currencies are marginally weaker vs. the Buck amid the rebound in risk sentiment in early EU trade. USD/JPY remains above 109.50, having tested the level overnight, with resistance flatted at 109.80-85, whilst USD/CHF eyes 1.01 to the upside as it flirts around the top of today 1.0072-94 range.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Lira remains the outperformer amongst its EM counterpart as the US-Turkey does not seem to be detreating as (fast as) expected, following a phone call between the two President yesterday in which they agreed to meet on the side-lines of the G20 summit in June. USD/TRY is not back below the 6.00 figure and closer to 5.95, ahead of President Erdogan’s presentation of his judicial reform strategy programme at the presidential palace at 1200BST following by a meeting of the National Security Council at 1300BST.</p><p><strong>New Zealand released its budget in which its sees 2018/19 Cash Balance at -2.785B vs. Prev. forecast of -4.993B</strong> and sees 2018/19 GDP growth of 2.1% vs. Prev. 2.9% forecast in Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update. Furthermore, New Zealand Finance Minister Robertson said increased government spending will help domestic economy in the face of global slowdown, while he added that US-China trade dispute, Brexit uncertainty and slowing global growth pose continuing risks.

Bunds are also seeing similar price action, and a similar lack of news to trade upon, with 10-year futures now eyeing 167.52 after having hit lows of the day at 167.72 as yields ease off record lows of -20.5bps. In the periphery, BTPs are outperforming their core counterparts and trade in positive territory, with an extra leg up received by today’s BTP auction.</p><p>Moving stateside, debt futures are lower across the curve after a poor 7-yr auction that tailed by 1.8bps has catalysed some selling, with the longer end now underperforming. The 10yr 24th May low of 125-04+ has proven to be formidable support thus far, but may be tested should further downside be added by comments from voter Clarida later in the day after the 2nd reading of US GDP figures, which is forecast have a 10bps negative revision from 3.2%, alongside PCE Prices.</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WTI (+0.3%) and Brent (-0.8%) futures are mixed with the former relatively flat whilst the latter has failed to hold onto its post-API gains </strong>in which US crude stocks showed a wider-than-forecast drawdown (-5.27mln vs. Exp. -0.9mln). This mornings downside in Brent was exacerbated as 69.0/bbl was taken out to the downside, with Brent currently trading around 68.80/bbl. News-flow for the complex has been light, although amidst the little clarity in regard to the OPEC/OPEC+ meeting schedule, the Azeri Energy Minister noted that the meeting will likely take place in early July (touted dates include July 3rd/4th). As a reminder, the DoEs will be release later today at 1600BST amid US’ market absence on Monday. Elsewhere, gold prices (-0.2%) are marginally pressured amid the improvement in the risk tone. Meanwhile, copper prices remain near 4-month lows due to a weak performance in China. Further for the red metal, supply side disruptions are to keep an eye on after Chile's CODELCO mine workers voted in favour of a strike in the Chuquicamata mine which is the largest open-pit copper mine in the world.</p><p><strong>Chile's CODELCO mine workers voted in favour of a strike in the Chuquicamata mine which is the largest open-pit copper mine in the world</strong>.

        "content": "<ul><li>Nomura Quants highlights that the recent sell-off seen in US stocks appears to be driven by the closing of positions by systematic traders, risk-parity funds and CTA’s, and the S&amp;P’s move below the 2820 level.

Something which may have presented itself today given the turnaround in EU stocks and US futures indicating a positive open.</li><li>Additionally, note that fundamental traders do not appear to be panic-selling, with the selling driven by the aforementioned risk-parity funds and systematic traders, which rationalises why the VIX has not breached the 20 level in the last two weeks (since May 14th); for reference the VIX was around 17.90 at yesterday’s US market close.</li><li>Given the recent sell-off in stocks, markets have experienced a marked pick-up in demand for Treasuries and other safe havens, as such the UST 10yr yield has dropped to around 2.26%, on this Nomura note that speculative traders are still purchasing bonds in the hope that prices continue to rise; notably, the estimated net long position for CTA’s is at its largest level since January 2016. On this, trigger levels are identified at 2.38% and 2.48% for buying since March and April respectively.</li><li>Turning to the USD where, and in-line with the previous analysis piece on the RANsquawk board which indicated moderate buying of the USD at month end (Citi’s Month-End FX Hedge Rebalancing), Nomura see that hedge funds are now hesitantly going long-USD.</li></ul>",

Finally, Wirecard (1.9%) are at the top of the DAX (+0.6%) after announcing a strategic partnership with XBN relating to international e-commerce.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> - The broad Dollar and the index trades relatively flat thus far, albeit still north of the 98.000 level, as participants await a barrage of tier 1 US data in the form of Q1 GDP (2nd estimate), Core PCE, advances goods trade balance and initial jobless claims. DXY fluctuated between a reasonable 98.08-24 band for now, ahead of some mild resistance around the 98.37-40 mark. US-China news-flow has consisted of MOFCOM reiterations wherein the Chinese noted that tariffs will not solve trade imbalance and will not accept a deal which hurts sovereignty and pride. Nonetheless, focus of today will remain on the aforementioned US data with expectations for the GDP figure to be revised marginally lower (3.1% vs. Prev. 3.2%) whilst the Core PCE Q1 prelim figure is expected to be unchanged at 1.3% (FOMC noted that the recent dip in PCE is transitory) and initial jobless claims are expected to tick slightly higher to 215k from 211k. Elsewhere, Citi’s month-end FX hedge rebalancing model indicates moderate buying of the USD at month end, with the signal (ex-USD/JPY) measuring just over +0.5 historical standard deviations across all crosses.</p><p><strong>AUD,NZD,CAD</strong> - A firmer risk appetite or perhaps some consolidation from yesterday’s decline sees the risk currencies on a firmer footing this morning. AUD/USD has shrugged off the dismal Building Approval figures overnight ahead of the much anticipated RBA meeting next week. UBS believes the AUD is “too short for its own good” heading into the weekend, adding that “only a complete equity meltdown could drive the Aussie lower at this stage”. In terms of technicals, AUD/USD trades within a relatively tight 0.6917-36 range ahead of resistance at 0.6940. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is largely moving in tandem with its Aussie counterpart after showing little reaction to the NZ budget, in which it sees the 2018/19 cash balance at -2.785bln vs. the Prev. forecast of -4.993bln. NZD/USD also remains within a tight range with the antipodeans eyeing Chinese NBS Manufacturing PMI following the aforementioned US data. Elsewhere, the Loonie nurses some of yesterday’s post-BOC loses, with the aid of rising oil prices amid a much wider than expected build in crude stocks reported by APIs last night. In terms of technical, USD/CAD hovers around the 1.3500 mark having moved in a 1.3493-3520 range, with support flagged at 1.3490. Looking ahead for the CAD, current account data is due at 1330BST whilst BoC’s Wilkins is due to give a speech around 1930BST.</p><p><strong>EUR,GBP</strong> - Little changed and trading mostly at the whim of the Greenback amid tentative newsflow. EUR/USD remains within a tight 20 pip range (1.1125-45) with support flagged at 1.1125 and 1.1105. In terms of upside, resistance levels are noted at 1.1155 ahead of 1.1170 (with 1bln in option expiries at strike 1.1175-85). Similarly, the Pound has done little on the day thus far and GBP/USD remains within a 1.2612-39 band with little new to report on the Brexit front. Meanwhile, EUR/GBP is currently flat on the day around within a 0.8810-25 with resistance around 0.8845-50.</p><p><strong>CHF,JPY</strong> - Both safe haven currencies are marginally weaker vs. the Buck amid the rebound in risk sentiment in early EU trade. USD/JPY remains above 109.50, having tested the level overnight, with resistance flatted at 109.80-85, whilst USD/CHF eyes 1.01 to the upside as it flirts around the top of today 1.0072-94 range.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Lira remains the outperformer amongst its EM counterpart as the US-Turkey does not seem to be detreating as (fast as) expected, following a phone call between the two President yesterday in which they agreed to meet on the side-lines of the G20 summit in June. USD/TRY is not back below the 6.00 figure and closer to 5.95, ahead of President Erdogan’s presentation of his judicial reform strategy programme at the presidential palace at 1200BST following by a meeting of the National Security Council at 1300BST.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Core EU</strong> and <strong>UK</strong> debt has been consolidating throughout the morning, with the UK 10yr underperforming its mainland counterparts and hitting a day’s nadir of 129.21, with the 23rd May high next on the downside (129.13) to look out for in a technical sense. Bunds are also seeing similar price action, and a similar lack of news to trade upon, with 10-year futures now eyeing 167.52 after having hit lows of the day at 167.72 as yields ease off record lows of -20.5bps. In the periphery, <strong>BTPs</strong> are outperforming their core counterparts and trade in positive territory, with an extra leg up received by today’s <strong>BTP</strong> auction.</p><p><strong>Moving stateside</strong>, debt futures are lower across the curve after a poor 7-yr auction that tailed by 1.8bps has catalysed some selling, with the longer end now underperforming. The 10yr 24th May low of 125-04+ has proven to be formidable support thus far, but may be tested should further downside be added by comments from voter Clarida later in the day after the 2nd reading of US GDP figures, which is forecast have a 10bps negative revision from 3.2%, alongside PCE Prices.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> (Unch) and <strong>Brent</strong> (+0.6%) futures are mixed with the former relatively flat whilst the latter holds onto most of its post-API gains in which US crude stocks showed a wider-than-forecast drawdown (-5.27mln vs. Exp. -0.9mln). News-flow for the complex has been light, although amidst the little clarity in regard to the OPEC/OPEC+ meeting schedule, the Azeri Energy Minister noted that the meeting will likely take place in early July (touted dates include July 3rd/4th). As a reminder, the DoEs will be release later today at 1600BST amid US’ market absence on Monday. Elsewhere, gold prices (-0.2%) are marginally pressured amid the improvement in the risk tone. Meanwhile, copper prices remain near 4-month lows due to a weak performance in China. Further for the red metal, supply side disruptions are to keep an eye on after Chile's CODELCO mine workers voted in favour of a strike in the Chuquicamata mine which is the largest open-pit copper mine in the world.</p>",

USD/JPY is seen as exempt from this due to the model’s assumption of Japanese investors having a smaller foreign equity hedge ratio. Overall, these indications are predominantly attributed to requirements from equity investors.</p>",

Furthermore, trade uncertainty lingered, and technical selling was at play in which the DJIA briefly slipped below the 25K level and the S&amp;P 500 tested its 200DMA. As such, ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) were subdued following the weak lead from their global peers with only the telecoms sector bucking the trend in Australia as Telstra resumed its ascent towards highs last seen in January 2018, while sentiment in Tokyo continued to be hampered as USD/JPY remained at a sub-110.00 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) were negative amid no signs of trade tensions abating as China’s Global Times Editor suggested US is shifting from protecting its interest to destroying China in its crackdown on Huawei, while commentary in People’s Daily warned the US not to underestimate China’s ability to strike back and stated “Don’t say we didn’t warn you” which was a phrase it last used prior to China’s war with India and Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s, respectively</p><p><strong>FTSE</strong></p><p>Ex-Divs - Marks and Spencer (MKS LN), National Grid (NG/ L), Sage Group (SGE LN) and Whitbread (WTB LN) will trade without entitlement to their latest dividend pay-out on Thursday, trimming 5.38 points off the FTSE 100.

(CityAM)</p><p>Oil Names - WTI crude futures steady in comparison to the prior day’s whipsaw in which prices briefly tested USD 57.00/bbl before staging an aggressive comeback, while the latest API inventory report was also bullish for prices and showed a much larger than expected draw in headline crude stockpile which in turn underpinned US oil prices to above USD 59.00/bbl.</p><p>Mining Names - Gold remained subdued by a firmer greenback and with participants awaiting GDP and Core PCE Prices, while the risk averse tone kept copper at 4-month lows.

Looking at the curve, the 2s/10s steepened by c. 1.8bps, with the 5s/30s flattening by c. 1bps. The 7-year auction was relatively weak, where it tailed by 1.9bps, above the six-auction average of -0.3bps, and the B/C ratio came in at 2.3x, below the six-auction averages of 2.53x. It is worth highlighting that the high-yield was the lowest it has been since September 2017, coming amidst a sharp rally in bonds in recent sessions. In regard to the breakdown, dealers took a chunky 30%, almost double the six-auction average, with discretionary buyers (indirects/directs) both taking below averages. In the fallout from the auction Treasuries sold off, with newswires attributing dealers as the main sellers as they seek to offload their large holdings. US T-note futures (M9) settled 7+ ticks higher at 125-20.</p><p>Canada PM Trudeau said a draft ratification of the USMCA has been formally presented to Canadian parliament, while there were also reports that Canadian PM Trudeau will conduct a joint press conference with US Vice President Pence on today at 1345EDT.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets mostly track the declines of their counterparts on Wall St where all majors extended on losses amid little in the way of catalysts to inspire a rebound and with participants looking ahead to upcoming US GDP as well as the Fed’s preferred PCE inflation gauge. Furthermore, trade uncertainty lingered and technical selling was at play in which the DJIA briefly slipped below the 25K level and the S&amp;P 500 tested its 200DMA. As such, ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) are subdued following the weak lead from their global peers with only the telecoms sector bucking the trend in Australia as Telstra resumes its ascent towards highs last seen in January 2018, while sentiment in Tokyo continued to be hampered as USD/JPY remains at a sub-110.00 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) are negative amid no signs of trade tensions abating as China’s Global Times Editor suggested US is shifting from protecting its interest to destroying China in its crackdown on Huawei, while commentary in People’s Daily warned the US not to underestimate China’s ability to strike back and stated “Don’t say we didn’t warn you” which was a phrase it last used prior to China’s war with India and Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s, respectively.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady and holds on to recent gains above the 98.00 level after USD caught a bid against its major counterparts with EUR/USD subdued following weak German unemployment data and with GBP/USD around its weakest levels in nearly 6 months amid political uncertainty as well as gilt yields reaching fresh 2-year lows. Elsewhere, JPY is mixed with USD/JPY meandering around 109.50 after it caught a bid on widening yield differentials between US and Japan, while antipodeans are indecisive after an uneventful New Zealand budget announcement and as initial pressure in AUD/USD, following a miss on Private Capex and Building Approvals, was dispelled by upgrades to 2018/19 and 2019/20 capex estimates.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as they tracked the pullback in T-notes but with downside stemmed by support around the 153.00 level and ahead of a 2yr auction later.</p>",
