Conversely, ECB's Weidmann said the ECB went overboard with the stimulus package and will make sure hikes are not delayed for too long, while ECB's Knot suggested the ECB's measures are not in line with the economic situation, that the Eurozone is growing at full capacity and that restarting QE is not the right instrument.

Big tech (FB, GOOGL, AMZN, AAPL) opened lower amid a US House panel probing antitrust behaviour; Netflix (NFLX) bucked the FAANG trend after a positive mention at Piper Jaffray. Financials were an outperforming sector given the steeper yield curve. Broadcom (AVGO) opened lower after missing Revenue estimates for Q3 and its FY guidance. Higher copper prices on trade truce optimism boosted Freeport-McMoRan (FCX). Progressive (PGR) underperformed after disappointing August figures. Altria (MO) dipped after reports Juul, which it owns a 35% stake in, had taken a large valuation cut in the secondary market. Tyson Foods (TSN) benefitted from China excluding pork from tariffs.

The large moves lower in the TPLEX came after the latest University of Michigan Survey, where losses extended as the Europeans closed up for the weekend. Treasuries were also taking some cues from EGB selling, as participants digest the latest ECB tiering system which gives leeway to banks to reallocate their reserves at the ECB at the tiered rate instead of in negative yielding government debt. US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin again stated that the US is looking whether there is proper demand for a 50-year bond and that the treasury will consider 100-year bonds. At settlement the curve had bear steepened significantly with yields up over 10bp in the belly to long end of the curve. US T-notes (z9) settled 27+ ticks lower at 128-18+.</p>",
