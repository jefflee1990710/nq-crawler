        "subject": "PREVIEW: China's 2020 National People's Congress",
        "content": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p><p>The<strong> </strong>National People’s Congress (NPC) will be held from May 22nd where members will vote on economic policies for this year. Desks expect the approval of further corporate relief measures, higher fiscal deficit target and for local government to get the green light on debt issuing to fund infrastructure development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TRADE WAR:</strong></p><p>The deterioration in US and China relations remains a key theme in markets. However, SCMP citing a Chinese Government Adviser said <strong>the upcoming “two sessions” (CPPCC and NPC) will not have much of a direct bearing on the trade deal, but the language used will hint at Beijing future approaches in dealing with Washington</strong> – “Whether [China] chooses to go full-on confrontation, or continue to maintain competition without decoupling, that is what we need to pay attention to”, the official said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HONG KONG NATIONAL SECURITY LAW: Beijing will introduce a draft resolution which will be presented as a motion to the NPC on Friday, </strong>according to sources. This will be a National Security Law that will be included in the Basic Law that prohibits acts of “treason, secession, sedition, or subversion”<strong> which would officially ban all activities aimed at toppling the central government and influencing Hong Kong affairs. </strong>This is seen as a tightening of Beijing grip on Hong Kong and could stoke further unrest for Hong Kong which had already suffered from months of protests since the middle of&nbsp; last year and invoked a response from Washington with US President Trump noting that the US would have a very strong reaction if it happens and US Senators were reportedly introducing a bipartisan bill that would sanction Chinese party officials and entities who enforce the new national-security laws in Hong Kong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GDP GROWTH TARGET:</strong></p><p>The annual setting of the growth target has been a controversial topic against the backdrop of the pandemic. <strong>Some economists believe that China could set a two-year target for 2020 and 2021</strong> as opposed to a single target for 2020. “If so, the average annual growth rate (for the two years) will be set at about 6 percent.\", according to an analyst cited by SCMP. <strong>Other sources said a numerical target may be dropped altogether</strong> and instead a “description of the goal for the GDP growth” could be issued, albeit no final decision has been made and details remain light as to how this will be achieved. Desks also note the move will untie the hands of policymakers from being obliged to issue stimulus to meet the target. For reference, newswires forecast the 2020 metric at 1.8% after a Q1 contraction of 6.8%. <strong>Analysts believe that the importance of a GDP growth target will be downplayed</strong> - instead, the NPC will give more credence to stabilising employment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LABOUR MARKET:</strong></p><p>There are expectations for the stabilisation of the jobs market to be top priority at this year’s confab amid the vast number of people unemployed or forced into furlough. Some do not expect a major change vs. last year’s targets, albeit these will prove harder to conquer given the backdrop of the pandemic, and with some provinces reporting small numbers of resurging cases. HSBC expects registered and surveyed unemployment rate below 4.5% ad 5.5% apiece and new job creation target of at least 10mln. <strong>Stimulus measures will likely have to be upscaled</strong> to achieve this – “although lower growth this year will likely lead to more slack in the labour market, with sufficient policy support it is possible to keep the official unemployment rates below the targets”, HSBC says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"file:///C:/Users/trader1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.png\"></figure><p><strong>FISCAL STIMULUS:</strong></p><p><strong>China’s Finance Minister Liu Kun stated that China will increase its 2020 fiscal expenditure</strong> to help cushion the pandemic’s impact on the economy – but did not provide exact details other than the <strong>deficit/GDP ratio will “rise modestly” and that the issuance ceiling for local government special bonds will be increased.</strong> Liu Kun also stated that they would “expand the results of the tax cut” for businesses enacted last year. The Finance Ministry has already rolled out tax and fee cuts totalling over CNY 800bln this year, albeit this is not believed to be sufficient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>REFORM AGENDA:</strong></p><p>Some say the growth shock resulted by the pandemic could pave the way for fresh reforms to bolster growth. “China’s supply-side reforms will likely focus on increasing flexibility in the allocation of production factors, including land, labour, capital, technology and data”, HSBC predicts, with priority to be land and labour reforms. <strong>Furthermore, China could also unveil guidance on how to strengthen cross-border relationships</strong> in time of global crisis - such as easier restrictions for market access, narrowing the negative list size alongside cutting some import tariffs.</p>",

Equities are lower, although the Treasury curve is mixed with a flatter bias.&nbsp; Oil continues to ride the wave of constructive inventory data. The dollar snapped its three-day run of losses to finish a touch higher, though that was still enough to make its presence felt across the FX complex. Investors have generally been able to look through negative US/China news flow this week, although the sheer frequency of the commentary over the last 24 hours has been difficult to ignore, and ahead of the long-weekend, traders have taken risk off the table. Best Buy (BBY) saw a beat on EPS, a miss on revenue although comp sales declined less than expected thanks do a 155% increase in online sales. It also declared a USD 0.55/shr dividend. Macy’s (M) did not provide an EPS or revenue but estimates revenue next quarter to be roughly USD 3bln (exp. 3.3bln). Macy’s (M) sales are down by roughly 50% in stores that are open, it noted. Expedia (EXPD) EPS missed, revenue was in line. It also noted that it expects Adj. EBITDA to be significantly worse in Q2. Take Two (TTWO) beat on EPS and revenue, while provided solid guidance for the next quarter, however its FY21 EPS view was weak and thus weighed on shares.

The T-note had seen some modest weakness heading into the US session as equity futures came off their lows, although soon strengthened again as US-China tensions hit risk appetite amid China moving ahead with its plans for a new Hong Kong security bill. Later in the afternoon, Fed Chair Clarida noted that some form of YCC, alongside forward guidance, was worth looking into (echoing the minutes), although the market reaction was muted. On the issuance front, the Treasury 10-year TIPS auction saw weak demand, tailing by 4bps, an indication of market participants not being concerned of inflation rising. On the corporate front, AT&amp;T launched the fourth largest IG offering of the year, raising USD 12bln across five tranches (7s, 11s, 21s, 31s, 40s). T-note (M0) futures settled 0.5 ticks lower at 139-02.</p>",

Equities are lower, although the Treasury curve is mixed with a flatter bias.&nbsp; Oil continues to ride the wave of constructive inventory data. The dollar snapped its three-day run of losses to finish a touch higher, though that was still enough to make its presence felt across the FX complex. Investors have generally been able to look through negative US/China news flow this week, although the sheer frequency of the commentary over the last 24 hours has been difficult to ignore, and ahead of the long-weekend, traders have taken risk off the table. With that said, in percentage terms, today’s downside doesn’t appear to be anything like the sharp drops we have seen in recent weeks; the Emini S&amp;P has been knocking around the 2950 mark, which coincides with key volume at price level, and the 2,935-40 region has held up (we didn’t manage to print a fresh May high today). In terms of news flow, we have summarised the pertinent points of the US/China story beneath; elsewhere, there were interesting remarks from the Fed’s Clarida, who has suggested the Fed has enough visibility to make SEP forecasts in June, although analysts said this was likely to come with caveats; he also gave a nod to yield curve control and calendar-based guidance, which were alluded to in the meeting minutes released Wednesday. Fed’s Powell had nothing new to say. Weekly claims data, which coincides with the BLS jobs report for May, came in broadly as expected, and analysts see the numbers falling sub-1mln in the third week of June. On Friday, attention will be on the start of Chinese NPC and the ECB’s latest meeting minutes; the BOJ will hold its off-schedule meeting overnight to discuss support for banks.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>CHINESE STOCK LISTINGS: </strong>China's Baidu (BIDU) is reportedly mulling delisting from Nasdaq to boost its valuation, sources stated; talks are at an early stage. Baidu believes it is undervalued on the Nasdaq. Meanwhile, US House Speaker Pelosi said the House will review the Senate bill to delist some Chinese companies.</p><p><strong>US/CHINA; WHERE WE STAND: </strong>The two nations continue to lock horns with harsh rhetoric and provocative actions as sentiment hits a low and threatens the trade deal at the very least. US President Trump overnight repeated his criticism on China in which he suggests it is trying desperately to deflect the pain and carnage the country spread throughout the world, and added disinformation and propaganda attack on the US and Europe is a disgrace. Yesterday, the President blamed the pandemic on the “incompetence of China”. Trump also aimed at the WHO for being China-biased, whilst Secretary of State Pompeo mentioned the “troubling” nature of the WHO Head’s links to China. US warned if WHO does not commit to substantive improvements within the next 30 days, the US will permanently freeze its funding and reconsider membership. Note, the latest reports suggest US President Trump has sent a letter to Congress regarding the strategic approach to China. Meanwhile, on the Phase One trade deal the USTR and USDA acknowledged further progress on the implementation of agricultural-related provisions, noting China is to import US blueberries, Avocados, Barley and Hay under the Phase One deal; note China recently raised tariffs on Australia Barley. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-us-sino-tensions-remain-elevated-21-05-2020\">Click here for full analysis.</a></p><p><strong>US/RUSSIA ARMS TREATY:</strong> US President Trump is to withdraw from the ‘Open Skies’ arms control treaty, where it will formally inform Russia on Friday of the move and will accuse Russia of violations. The White House said attention will now move on to nuclear arms discussions. President Trump echoed this later, saying that he has a good relationship with Russia, but it didn’t adhere to the Open Skies treaty; the US might make another deal with Russia on an arms strategy.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED: Vice-Chair Clarida</strong> (voter) said that <strong>yield curve control (YCC)</strong> is a natural complement to calendar-based forward guidance; said other central banks are deploying YCC and it makes sense to be briefed on how it is working. The comments follow the April FOMC Minutes released on Wednesday where participants discussed the potential for YCC and forward guidance (following forward guidance, there are also expectations for the Fed to carry out YCC to the front-end of the coupon curve – likely the 5-year tenor). Clarida also said that the Fed intends to return to Standard Economic Projections (SEP) at the June meeting. The Fed previously withdrew its SEPs amid the outbreak of COVID-19, thus by indicating that it would return to providing them at the June meeting, it suggests the FOMC feels confident enough on its economic outlook. Clarida also noted that the Committee might return at some point to the discussion around the pace and composition of its asset purchases; said balance sheet and interest rate discussions must complement each other. On NIRP, he said his view has not changed, adding that all 17 Fed officials opposed them during the October discussion. Elsewhere today, <strong>NY Fed President</strong> <strong>Williams</strong> (voter) said the goal is to keep interest rates low to support the economy, but not have them turn negative; said the Fed looked at negative rates closely, but the view is that they are not the correct tool for now. Williams also said the Fed’s actions to support credit markets &amp; the economy are not at all inflationary, and if anything, sees inflation running below trend. On the outlook, Williams sees a strong rebound in H2, although said unemployment is certain to deteriorate further before it begins improving; markets appear to be functioning well with other indicators looking favourable, he said.</p><p><strong>CBRT: </strong>The Turkish Central Bank opted to cut its Weekly Repo Rate by 50bps to 8.25% as expected and towards the bottom of the 50-100bps forecast range. This marked the ninth consecutive reduction in the rate to a cumulative 1575bps from July 2019. Notably, the CB stated that the inflation outlook is in-line with year-end projections, which comes despite the weakening TRY and rising oil prices – to which the Bank alluded the outlook remains favourable. The statement reiterated the “cautious stance” and repeated that the Central Bank would continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. CBRT also reiterated its emphasis that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. Desks believe that the favourable inflation outlook and the slowing pace of cuts could suggest any further rate cuts could again come at a reduced rate heading into the end of the CBRT’s easing cycle.</p><p><strong>ECB MINUTES PREVIEW: </strong>The latest policy announcement from the ECB saw policymakers opt to stand pat on rates once again with the general train of thought at the Bank being that delving deeper into negative territory at this stage would provide little in the way of stimulus for the Eurozone. Instead, the Governing Council opted to sweeten the terms of the existing TLTROIII operations and launch a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) with the view of supporting liquidity conditions in the euro area. Those hoping for an expansion of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) were left somewhat disappointed with the current envelope left at a size of EUR 750bln, whilst the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue to run at a monthly pace of EUR 20bln. That said, the Governing Council was explicit in informing market participants that it “is fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed”; any further clarity on this front will be of interest to participants. At the accompanying press conference, Lagarde provided a relatively cautious introductory statement, as expected, whilst stopping short of specific forecasts on the macro outlook; staff economic projections are not due until the June meeting; analysts will be eyeing the account for any further qualitative comments by policymakers on the Eurozone’s growth outlook. Lagarde took every opportunity to remind those watching that the Governing Council will be there to help support the Eurozone economy, however policy will need to be carried out in a coordinated manner with fiscal authorities. Heading into the announcement some desks had speculated about the possibility of yield curve control (YCC), on which, Lagarde stated, the combination of tools the ECB is currently using enables it to operate across the entire curve; but noted the ECB will use all the flexibility that it has. Elsewhere, despite some slightly incoherent responses during the Q&amp;A segment (in a bid to avoid any faux paus such as that seen in March), the press conference wasn’t too much of a game-changer for the narrative surrounding the Bank’s current course of action.</p><h2><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></h2><p><strong>HONG KONG NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION:</strong> Sources state that Beijing will introduce a draft resolution tonight and will be presented as a motion to the <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24535/download?code=9o9AJWcr9Jp2luZCucYf\">NPC tomorrow</a>. This will be a National Security Law that will be included in the Basic Law that prohibits acts of “treason, secession, sedition, or subversion”. This would officially ban all activities aimed at toppling the central government and the influence on Hong Kong affairs. Prior sources via SCMP noted that Chinese President Xi “expressed concern that Hong Kong was becoming a loophole in China’s national security and stressed that Hong Kong should not become the weak link.” Several analysts and government sources expected the legislation to be discussed at the NPC, but eyes are on the format and as to what extent. US President Trump later announced that if it happens, the US would have a very strong reaction. Meanwhile, US Senators reportedly introduced a bipartisan bill that would sanction Chinese party officials and entities who enforce the new laws in Hong Kong. The bill would also penalise banks that do business with the entities. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-china-to-announce-national-security-legislation-for-hong-kong-21-05-2020\">Click here for full analysis.</a></p><p><strong>NPC PREVIEW:</strong> The first of the delayed annual “two sessions” will kick off on May 21st with a meeting of China’s top political advisory body, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

The T-note had seen some modest weakness heading into the US session as equity futures came off their lows, although soon strengthened again as US-China tensions hit risk appetite amid China moving ahead with its plans for a new Hong Kong security bill. Later in the afternoon, Fed Chair Clarida noted that some form of YCC, alongside forward guidance, was worth looking into (echoing the minutes), although the market reaction was muted. On the issuance front, the Treasury 10-year TIPS auction saw weak demand, tailing by 4bps, an indication of market participants not being concerned of inflation rising. On the corporate front, AT&amp;T launched the fourth largest IG offering of the year, raising USD 12bln across five tranches (7s, 11s, 21s, 31s, 40s).</p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (N0) SETTLES USD 0.43 HIGHER AT USD 33.92; BRENT (N0) SETTLES USD 0.31 HIGHER AT USD 36.06; BRENT (Q0) SETTLES 0.43 HIGHER AT USD 33.92</strong></p><p>Choppy price action in the crude complex was seen on Thursday as deteriorating risk appetite took the wind out of oil’s recovery. The complex has been on an impressive run this month, rising off historic lows, and today marks the fourth consecutive day with WTI above the 30-handle. UBS’ O&amp;G analysts – after meeting with North American producers – noted a common theme was the potential for producers to ramp up production as WTI rises above 30; the fact that only a few smaller shale producers have so far gone bankrupt suggests that there is still ample spare capacity in the US, potentially inhibiting a supply-led price recovery in the region. Furthermore, on the OPEC-front Citi’s energy desk noted, “we’re also hearing at least some market talk that with the recovery in price and the projected deficits into 2021, OPEC+ producers may be able to raise production, although not necessarily at the June 9-10 summit.” Citi looks for Saudi Arabia to add back their additional 1.0mln BPD cut for June before the wider group lifts output. However, in recent sessions, it appears supply has taken more of a stable backseat as enthusiasm on economic recoveries grows louder across risk assets – participants would be wise to maintain caution on the optimism due to potential for economies to return to lockdowns, as well as any front running of production resumption.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.8% at 2949, NDX -1.1% at 9378, DJIA -0.4% at 24,474</li><li><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Industrials +0.2%, Consumer Discretionary -0.2%, Financials -0.4%, Real Estate -0.5%, Health Care -0.8%, Materials -1%, Utilties -1%, Staples -1%, Technology –1.4%, Energy -1.5%, Communications -1.64%</li><li><strong>EUROPE CLOSES:</strong> EURO STOXX 50 (+0.1%) at 2905, FTSE 100 (-0.9%) at 6015, DAX (-1.4%) at 11,066, CAC 40 (-1.2%) at 4,445, IBEX 35 (+0.05%) at 6686, FTSE MIB (-0.75%) at 17087, SMI (+0.3%) at 9791</li><li><strong>ES LEVELS: 3</strong>,135 (78.6% Feb hi-Mar lo), 2,997 (200dma), 2,976.25 (May hi), ~2,950, ~2,935, 2,930 (61.8% Feb hi-Mar lo), 2,917-2,923 (valuation; FY20 eps exp. 137.88 x 21.2 exp. p/e; FY21 eps exp. 162.99 x 17.9 exp. p/e), 2,900-10, 2,850 (this week lo).</li></ul><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Best Buy (BBY) saw a beat on EPS, a miss on revenue although comp sales declined less than expected thanks do a 155% increase in online sales.

Macy’s (M) sales are down by roughly 50% in stores that are open, it noted. Expedia (EXPD) EPS missed, revenue was in line. It also noted that it expects Adj. EBITDA to be significantly worse in Q2. Take Two (TTWO) beat on EPS and revenue, while provided solid guidance for the next quarter, however its FY21 EPS view was weak and thus weighed on shares.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Uber (UBER) and Grubhub (GRUB) are reportedly still in discussions and the two remain “close”; GRUB has reduced its asking price to 1.95 UBER shares per GRUB share, down from their initial 2.15 ask. Meanwhile UBER maintains its offer of 1.9 UBER shares; reports CNBC’s Faber. Note, Senator Klobuchar has officially been asked by Joe Biden to undergo vetting to be considered for his VP, according to CBS citing sources. Note, Klobuchar has raised anti-competitive concerns of the UBER/GRUB deal. Starbucks (SBUX) announced it has regained 60-65% of US comp-store sales in the last week (around 80% in China); says it will take time to fully recover and post positive comp SSS growth – note that equity futures saw upside in the pre-market after this release. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (GOOG/GOOGL) are reportedly in talks with Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic affairs about setting up high-tech R&amp;D centers in Taiwan, according to DigiTimes. Note, this comes as China is urging the US to cut its ties with Taiwan. Boeing (BA) was initiated as outperform at RBC, who notes BA’s strong correlation to global commercial passenger traffic which the analyst believes will see a multiyear period of double-digit growth. RBC also initiated Raytheon Technologies (RTX) at Outperform. Meanwhile, Baidu (BIDU) is reportedly considering de-listing from Nasdaq to boost valuation, according to sources.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>PHILLY FED: </strong>The headline picked up from April’s -56.6 print, another sign perhaps suggesting the worst is behind us; however, the figure is still grim at -43.1, which also missed analysts' expectations, suggesting perhaps a slower recovery than initially expected. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that the modest increase is consistent with a small increase in the national ISM index (manufacturing due 1st June, and non-manufacturing due 3rd June)., although it caveats that “diffusion indexes are not reliable when activity is shifting so rapidly”; The desk highlights the jump in new orders from –70.9 to -25.7, does not mean activity has rocketed, rather it tells us activity fell so far beforehand that relatively few firms reported another decline in May. Employment also ticked up but remains negative. Prices Paid saw a positive read of 3.9, up from the prior -9.3 while Capex ticked up to 15.2 from 12.4.</p><p><strong>JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Initial Jobless claims printed 2.438mln this week (this week’s data coincides with the May BLS jobs report), slightly above the consensus 2.4mln, but less than the prior 2.98mln. Jobless claims have continued to decline since the 6.9mln peak at the end of March. Continuing claims picked up to 25mln this week, more than the expected 24.75mln and up from the previously revised 22.5mln, which Capital Economics says shows lockdown easing measures have not yet resulted in any large scale return to work for those who are temporarily out of a job, while it also will not count those claiming the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Benefits. The consultancy also highlights that the insured unemployment rate hit a record high of 17.2% (prev. 15.5%), while noting as this data feeds into the monthly jobs report it is clear the official U3 unemployment rate will be much higher than April’s, suggesting it will be at least 20% (prev. 14.7%). CapEco concludes that “overall, there is little evidence that the reopening of the economy has, as yet, led to any sudden snap back in employment”, while noting California and Texas saw the largest claim declines, but Florida and Georgia, which begun to reopen sooner, saw a rise in claims, which suggests to them that the states are struggling to process the surging claims when the pandemic first hit.</p><p><strong>EXISITING HOME SALES: </strong>US existing home sales declined 17.8% in April to 4.33mln from 5.27mln, although it was slightly better than the feared 18.9% drop to 4.3mln, albeit still a large drop. Oxford Economics suggests that we may have seen a bottom in April, expects the recovery in sales to be gradual, though looks for home sales to be down for the year.</p><h2><strong>FX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>USD SNAPS THREE DAY LOSS STREAK AS RISK SENTIMENT SOURS</strong></p><p><strong>USD:</strong> The greenback’s snaps a three-day run of losses as risk sentiment soured after the US and China continue to engage in hostile rhetoric (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-us-sino-tensions-remain-elevated-21-05-2020\">click here for full analysis</a>). DXY remains beneath 100 after finding solid support at the 99 figure – sticking within the broader 99-101 range it has seen in Q2.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Eurozone PMI was better than expected, jumping from the lows last month, although still well beneath 50; despite that, it has been taken as a positive for now. The single currency saw slight weakness after initially breaching 1.10 to the upside and now resides back beneath it closer towards 1.0950 at pixel time. On a move past 1.10, TD Securities “do not yet sense any great urgency in the move”.</p><p><strong>JPY, XAU:</strong> The Yen was weaker despite dampened risk sentiment (JPY has ignored risk-off developments recently) amid a poor PMI print which saw manufacturing fall to 38.4 from 41.9, although services ticked up to 25.3, while the composite rose to 27.4. JPM argues that USDJPY looks unlikely to shake 107 anytime soon so look to trade the range – 108.10 first point of resistance with 108.45/50 above (200dma) while initial supports comes in around 107.35/45 ahead of 107.00/10. Elsewhere, on XAU JPMorgan says that the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus will see currency debasement, which tends to be gold supportive, adding that the risk of currency debasement may rise next year and that tends to show in the value of Gold or Yen.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling was flat against the rising dollar for the most part of the day; UK PMI’s fared better than expected and rose from the prior with manufacturing rising to 40.6 from 32.6l while services rose to 27.8 from 25, and the composite at 28.9 from 13.8. IHS said it was “consequently expecting GDP to fall by almost 12% in 2020. While the quarterly rate of decline looks likely to peak at around 20% in the second quarter, the recovery will be measured in years not months.\" HSBC writes the report provided support for GBP and it confirms “market expectations that things are getting worse less quickly than before”.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD:</strong> The AUD traded sideways in the morning of the US session, although as risk sentiment took a hit the cyclical nature of the currency saw it head lower amid a rising USD. Overnight, RBA Governor Lowe reiterated the bank remains prepared to scale up bond purchases again if necessary, adding there is a limit to what can be achieved with monetary policy; seemingly a hint for Fiscal action, as global central bankers have also done. NZD saw similar losses to its Antipodean counterpart in line with risk. Meanwhile, Westpac adjusted its RBNZ forecasts and pushed back its view the bank would cut its OCR to -0.5% in November 2020 to April 2021. The bank also expects the RBNZ to expand its LSAPP to USD 70bln in June and to USD 80bln at the August MPS. On LSAP bond purchases, it expects “the weekly pace of LSAP bond purchases will average $1.1bn until April 2021, slowing to $0.8bn after a negative OCR is introduced.”</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The Loonie also weakened with risk sentiment after trading flat against the buck pre-US cash equity open; the CAD was slightly firmer against AUD/NZD, likely as the firmer crude complex supported price action. On the rise in oil prices recently, Scotiabank writes at some point CAD may start to acknowledge these gains.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> Overall EMFX was generally firmer with ZAR finding strength after the latest SARB rate decision which cut rates by 50bps as expected, although 2/5 members opted for a lower 25bp cut. Elsewhere, BRL outperformed while comments from President Bolsonaro likely supported the Real as he announced he would sign a BRL 60bln coronavirus relief bill. MXN also saw solid gains despite a somewhat soured risk appetite as it likely benefits from the firmer crude complex, RUB however was flat. TRY also traded flat against the dollar after the CBRT rate decision which saw the bank cut by 50bps as expected while it reiterated its cautious stance.</p>",

        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD:</strong> The greenback’s snaps a three-day run of losses as risk sentiment soured after the US and China continue engage in hostile rhetoric (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-us-sino-tensions-remain-elevated-21-05-2020\">click here for full analysis</a>). DXY remains beneath 100 after finding solid support at the 99 figure – sticking within the broader 99-101 range it has seen in Q2.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Eurozone PMI was better than expected, jumping from the lows last month, although still well beneath 50; despite that, it has been taken as a positive for now. The single currency saw slight weakness after initially breaching 1.10 to the upside and now resides back beneath it closer towards 1.0950 at pixel time. On a move past 1.10, TD Securities “do not yet sense any great urgency in the move”.</p><p><strong>JPY, XAU:</strong> The Yen was weaker despite dampened risk sentiment (JPY has ignored risk-off developments recently) amid a poor PMI print which saw manufacturing fall to 38.4 from 41.9, although services ticked up to 25.3, while the composite rose to 27.4. JPM argues that USDJPY looks unlikely to shake 107 anytime soon so look to trade the range – 108.10 first point of resistance with 108.45/50 above (200dma) while initial supports comes in around 107.35/45 ahead of 107.00/10. Elsewhere, on XAU JPMorgan says that the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus will see currency debasement, which tends to be gold supportive, adding that the risk of currency debasement may rise next year and that tends to show in the value of Gold or Yen.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling was flat against the rising dollar for the most part of the day; UK PMI’s fared better than expected and rose from the prior with manufacturing rising to 40.6 from 32.6l while services rose to 27.8 from 25, and the composite at 28.9 from 13.8. IHS said it was “consequently expecting GDP to fall by almost 12% in 2020. While the quarterly rate of decline looks likely to peak at around 20% in the second quarter, the recovery will be measured in years not months.\" HSBC writes the report provided support for GBP and it confirms “market expectations that things are getting worse less quickly than before”.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD: </strong>The AUD traded sideways in the morning of the US session, although as risk sentiment took a hit the cyclical nature of the currency saw it head lower amid a rising USD. Overnight, RBA Governor Lowe reiterated the bank remains prepared to scale up bond purchases again if necessary, adding there is a limit to what can be achieved with monetary policy; seemingly a hint for Fiscal action, as global central bankers have also done. NZD saw similar losses to its Antipodean counterpart in line with risk. Meanwhile, Westpac adjusted its RBNZ forecasts and pushed back its view the bank would cut its OCR to -0.5% in November 2020 to April 2021. The bank also expects the RBNZ to expand its LSAPP to USD 70bln in June and to USD 80bln at the August MPS. On LSAP bond purchases, it expects “the weekly pace of LSAP bond purchases will average $1.1bn until April 2021, slowing to $0.8bn after a negative OCR is introduced.”</p><p><strong>CAD: </strong>The Loonie also weakened with risk sentiment after trading flat against the buck pre-US cash equity open; the CAD was slightly firmer against AUD/NZD, likely as the firmer crude complex supported price action. On the rise in oil prices recently, Scotiabank writes at some point CAD may start to acknowledge these gains.</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>Overall EMFX was generally firmer with ZAR finding strength after the latest SARB rate decision which cut rates by 50bps as expected, although 2/5 members opted for a lower 25bp cut. Elsewhere, BRL outperformed while comments from President Bolsonaro likely supported the Real as he announced he would sign a BRL 60bln coronavirus relief bill. MXN also saw solid gains despite a somewhat soured risk appetite as it likely benefits from the firmer crude complex, RUB however was flat. TRY also traded flat against the dollar after the CBRT rate decision which saw the bank cut by 50bps as expected while it reiterated its cautious stance.&nbsp;</p>",

Later in the afternoon, Fed Chair Clarida noted that some form of YCC, alongside forward guidance, was worth looking into (echoing the minutes), although the market reaction was muted. On the issuance front, the Treasury 10-year TIPS auction saw weak demand, tailing by 4bps, an indication of market participants not being concerned of inflation rising. On the corporate front, AT&amp;T launched the fourth largest IG offering of the year, raising USD 12bln across five tranches (7s, 11s, 21s, 31s, 40s).</p>",

The complex has been on an impressive run this month, rising off historic lows, and today marks the fourth consecutive day with WTI above the 30-handle. UBS’ O&amp;G analysts – after meeting with North American producers – noted a common theme was the potential for producers to ramp up production as WTI rises above 30; the fact that only a few smaller shale producers have so far gone bankrupt suggests that there is still ample spare capacity in the US, potentially inhibiting a supply-led price recovery in the region. Furthermore, on the OPEC-front Citi’s energy desk noted, “we’re also hearing at least some market talk that with the recovery in price and the projected deficits into 2021, OPEC+ producers may be able to raise production, although not necessarily at the June 9-10 summit.” Citi looks for Saudi Arabia to add back their additional 1.0mln BPD cut for June before the wider group lifts output. However, in recent sessions, it appears supply has taken more of a stable backseat as enthusiasm on economic recoveries grows louder across risk assets – participants would be wise to maintain caution on the optimism due to potential for economies to return to lockdowns, as well as any front running of production resumption.</p>",

Jobless claims have continued to decline since the 6.9mln peak at the end of March. Continuing claims picked up to 25mln this week, more than the expected 24.75mln and up from the previously revised 22.5mln, which Capital Economics says shows lockdown easing measures have not yet resulted in any large scale return to work for those who are temporarily out of a job, while it also will not count those claiming the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Benefits. The consultancy also highlights that the insured unemployment rate hit a record high of 17.2% (prev. 15.5%), while noting as this data feeds into the monthly jobs report it is clear the official U3 unemployment rate will be much higher than April’s, suggesting it will be at least 20% (prev. 14.7%). CapEco concludes&nbsp; that “overall, there is little evidence that the reopening of the economy has, as yet, led to any sudden snap back in employment”, while noting California and Texas saw the largest claim declines, but Florida and Georgia, which begun to reopen sooner, saw a rise in claims, which suggests to them that the states are struggling to process the surging claims when the pandemic first hit.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar remains volatile after another abnormally high rise in US initial claims that lifted the cumulative post-coronavirus outbreak tally to almost 40 mn, and the latest 2.438 mn coming in May NFP survey week. However, the Buck has clawed back declines vs G10 counterparts and the index is rebounding after another close shave/test of the 99.000 level amidst a broad deterioration in risk sentiment on familiar factors, such as heightened US-China acrimony over the cause and ill effects of COVID-19 to trade back above 99.500. Ahead, speeches from Fed’s Clarida and chair Powell after Williams said the jobless rate is bound to get worse before recovering and the latest unemployment figures do not show the full extent of the devastation ahead of speeches from Clarida and chair Powell scheduled later.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/NZD/CAD/AUD</strong></p><p>All volatile against the Greenback, but the Euro garnered enough momentum at one stage to eclipse yesterday’s peak and the 1.1000 mark where barrier defences were repelling its advances in wake of preliminary Eurozone PMIs. To recap, the pan prints all surprised to the upside even though French and German readings for services and manufacturing were mixed, while both composites fell short of expectations with the upshot alluding to relatively good news from the periphery when they arrive on June 1st. Sterling also derived some leverage from better than anticipated UK PMIs, but Cable remains bearish under 1.2225 (key chart point), while the non-US Dollars are all retreating further from recent highs due to the latest bout of risk aversion within 0.6149-07, 1.3891-1.3963 and 0.6599-50 respective ranges.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Even the so called and occasional or selective safe-havens are trailing in the Dollar’s wake, as the Yen fails to scale 107.50 meaningfully and Franc retreats from just above 0.9650 to revisit support near 0.9700. However, the former may get further independent impetus from Japanese CPI data after downbeat trade and exports, while awaiting news from the BoJ on bank lending initiatives.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The Sek and Nok are largely tracking risk flows and the Euro for cross purposes, but the latter is marginally underperforming as crude prices wane after extending corrections from extreme bear/oversold territory with the aid of US inventory drawdowns. Elsewhere, divergent moves and contrasting reactions to latest 50 bp rate reductions from the CBRT and SARB that were in line with ‘consensus’ as the Try anticipates more cautious easing, but the Zar takes note of 2 dissenters that voted for -1/4 point and the bias ahead of the policy meeting that was skewed more heavily towards a 100 bp cut than a similar surprise from the Turkish CB. Indeed, the Rand has ventured close to 17.5000 in the aftermath, while the Lira met resistance in to 6.7800.</p>",

Furthermore, the bill seeks audit submissions for inspection. Meanwhile, sources said Nasdaq is moving to tighten listing rules and restricting IPOs. As such, reports emerged that <strong>China will push ahead with listings of domestic companies in London</strong>, as its seeks to move away from US amid an escalation in tensions.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>HUAWEI</strong>: US announced measures that prevent Huawei from acquiring semiconductors and chipsets made using US software/technology. The US Commerce Department also warned that it expects Huawei’s current license extension to be final '90-day extension'. This came shortly after a statement from Trump in which he extended the executive order protecting the US supply chain from Huawei and ZTE for an additional year. In response, GT’s Chief Editor tweeted that <strong>China will activate the \"unreliable entity list\" if US further blocks key technology supply to Huawei</strong>, China will restrict or investigate US companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Cisco and Apple (AAPL), and suspend purchase of Boeing (BA) planes. Furthermore, reports via Nikkei said TSMC, Huawei’s key supplier, has stopped accepting new orders from the Chinese Co. amid US restrictions – reports TSCM downplayed as “market rumours”, but refrained from disclosing order information. Nonetheless, this opens the door to field of conflict between US and China over Taiwan.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>TAIWAN</strong>: China issued warnings to Washington after US officials sent rare and high-level congratulatory messages to anti-Chinese Taiwanese President Tsai and her second-term inauguration, following her landslide victory in January. China seems to be threatened by the growing alliance between US and Taipei, an area China claims territory over – with some participants highlighting influence over TSMC as an avenue for an attack on Huawei. <strong>China has urged the US to cut official ties with Taiwan and to stop upgrading substantive relations, interfering in China's internal affairs,</strong> and to stop undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as US/China relations. Meanwhile, China's Foreign Ministry <strong>said China will take necessary countermeasures on US'</strong> wrong behaviours regarding Taiwan, and added the US must bear the consequences</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>HONG KONG:</strong> Bitterness over Hong Kong remains between US and China following the pro-democracy Hong Kong violence over last year amid growing concern over China’s influence over Hong Kong and the “illusion” of democracy. <strong>Washington passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act –</strong> where the US has until the end of the month to decide whether Hong Kong can remain autonomous from China, a prerequisite for expanding preferential US trading and investment. <strong>China accuses the US of “blackmailing” the Hong Kong government</strong> with the Act. China’s Foreign Ministry’s Hong Kong Office said US actions on Hong Kong is a blatant interference on China's internal affairs and China will unswervingly safeguard sovereignty.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>MILITARY: Talks surrounding displaying military capability have been more abundant in Chinese media recently</strong>. GT’s Hu Xijin called on China to expand nuclear warheads and enhance nuclear deterrence, adding “we need to possess enough capability so that the US dare not proactively attack China under any circumstances”. Meanwhile, heading into the NPC, reports emerged via SCMP that <strong>China’s military leaders are calling for a substantially higher military budget to be announced</strong> amid “resources to cope with volatile challenges at home and overseas. But top of the list is the growing confrontation with the US.” Moreover, there were reports that the <strong>US Air Force has increased flyovers over waters near China</strong> alongside increased military operations by the US Navy – “China’s military observers warned of rising risks of military conflict between the two countries” between the two countries.</li><li><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-china-to-announce-national-security-legislation-for-hong-kong-21-05-2020\">Link to full analysis</a></li></ul>",

US equities are flat at the open with ES just flirting with positive territory (ES 2,41.50 overnight low, key levels below) as losses from overnight are reversed with support from the positive linearity theme, as SBUX announced US comp sales are at 60-65% of pre-COVID levels. The VIX is a touch lower (still sub-30), Treasury yields are mixed with the longer end lower and the bias towards moderate narrowing. The dollar is flat after a three-day run of losses, high-beta FX (AUD, NZD, GBP, CAD) are also flat; EM’s are mixed after central bank activity from CBRT and SARB. Oil is higher after this week’s inventory data has given hopes that the worst is behind us. Initial jobless claims at 2.44mln (more than expected, better than the prior, and coincides with the survey period for the May jobs report). Philly Fed headline rebounded by remains at weak levels, although new orders rebounded (but still negative); Markit services and manufacturing both better than expected, which may offer insight about what the May ISM surveys will look like.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Sectors open mixed with energy underperforming after a solid day of gains yesterday, health care also weak as Medtronic (MDT) weigh on the sector after earnings. Meanwhile, Consumer Discretionary outperforms after a slew of strong earnings from Macy’s (M), L-Brands (LB) and Best Buy (BBY).

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (GOOG/GOOGL) are reportedly in talks with Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic affairs about setting up high-tech R&amp;D centers in Taiwan, according to DigiTimes. Note, this comes as China is urging the US to cut its ties with Taiwan. Boeing (BA) was initiated as outperform at RBC, who notes BA’s strong correlation to global commercial passenger traffic which the analyst believes will see a multiyear period of double-digit growth. Meanwhile, Baidu (BIDU) are reportedly considering de-listing from Nasdaq to boost valuation, according to sources.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Best Buy (BBY) saw a beat on EPS, a miss on revenue although comp sales declined less than expected thanks do a 155% increase in online sales. It also declared a USD 0.55/shr dividend. Macy’s (M) did not provide an EPS or revenue but estimates revenue next quarter to be roughly USD 3bln (exp. 3.3bln). Macy’s (M) sales are down by roughly 50% in stores that are open, it noted. Expedia (EXPD) EPS missed, revenue was in line. It also noted that it expects Adj. EBITDA to be significantly worse in Q2. Take Two (TTWO) beat on EPS and revenue, while provided solid guidance for the next quarter, however its FY21 EPS view was weak and thus weighed on shares.</p><p><strong>ES LEVELS: </strong>3,135 (78.6% Feb hi-Mar lo), 2,997 (200dma), 2,976.25 (May hi), ~2,950, ~2,935, 2,930 (61.8% Feb hi-Mar lo), 2,917-2,923 (valuation; FY20 eps exp. 137.88 x 21.2 exp. p/e; FY21 eps exp. 162.99 x 17.9 exp. p/e), 2,900-10, 2,850 (this week lo).</p><p><strong>CHINA TENSIONS: </strong>Overnight, US President <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1263282491043037184?s=20\">Trump tweeted</a> what appears to be a direct criticism of China President Xi; the criticism followed the Senate passing a bill that required more accountability from Chinese firms listed on US exchanges (see below), and China’s NPC, getting underway tomorrow (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24535/download?code=9o9AJWcr9Jp2luZCucYf\">preview</a>); the Commerce Department is <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech-regulations/u-s-regulators-open-door-to-possible-tightening-of-huawei-chip-curb-idUKKBN22W31Y\">closing loopholes</a> for semi sales to Huawei, and the White House <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/china/white-house-china-report-calls-beijing-s-lack-transparency-threat-n1211311\">released a report</a> which called China’s lack of transparency a threat to US interests; all while the US <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/approves-180m-sale-advanced-torpedoes-taiwan-200520235339185.html\">approves the sale</a> of torpedoes to Taiwan – the Chinese have already <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/china-s-foreign-ministry-opposes-us-arms-sales-to-taiwan-says-us-should-stop-any-sales-damaging-us-china-relations-and-uphold-regional-stability-21-05-2020\">expressed anger</a> at Washington’s overtures to Taiwan. We've written a bit more about these theme <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-us-sino-tensions-remain-elevated-21-05-2020\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SENATE BILL:</strong> Senators on Wednesday unanimously passed a bill which required Chinese companies listed in the US to provide greater accountability. The Bill states these companies must comply with US auditing rules, or face delisting ­– presently, some firms, like Alibaba (BABA) are exempt. The Bill states that delisting could take place IF a company has not made accountability audits available and has gone three straight years without being examined. This is certainly more benign than the headlines had given the impression, on the first release. However, it is indicative of the deteriorating tone between US/China; the unanimous vote follows the failure of similar proposals to get through Congress in the past, and analysts are concerned about the prospect of any action which impedes capital flows or disrupts supply chains. It is a story to keep on the radar. Note, according to sources, Baidu (BIDU) are considering delisting from Nasdaq to boost its valuation.</p><p><strong>POLITICAL RISKS EMERGING: </strong>As virus risk abates globally, political/geopolitical fallout is emerging as a new significant risk for economy and financial markets, JPM argues (Kolanovic/Kaplan). It observes that economies of largest economic regions – CA, NY – are yet to reopen, and populism is putting at risk global cooperation and trade; the Senate Bill to bar Chinese companies from being listed on US exchanges is a case in point. It acknowledges that this is more of a ‘tail risk’ rather than an imminent threat, so still maintains its positive outlook on markets. The bank details how COVID will influence the election dynamic: the administration shifted to forecasting a larger negative impact (setting the stage for them to ‘outperform’, and eg. ‘hedging’ the Georgia reopening), shifting the pandemic blame to China and the WHO, and at the same time shifting the blame for economic pain to large blue states that are perceived to be slowing down the reopening of the economy ­­– and activity across the country is now largely following party lines. Another fault line is the role and scope of government in everyday life, begging questions like: should lockdowns be recommended or mandated, how much of individual freedoms should be limited, etc. Government employees have been less affected by lockdowns than small private businesses. These ideological fault lines are, to an extent, replicated and exported to other countries in the west. Working remotely has benefit large technology firms, whose share prices are near all-time highs; JPM says this might create a (perhaps wrong) impression of conflicts of interest when some of these firms are influencing policies related to reopening (such as reimagining education, health care, vaccines, contact tracking and tracing etc). Globally, JPM notes that demagogues and radicals across the world will be tempted to use COVID to blame immigrants, people of different race, or use the pandemic as a pretext to intensify geopolitical tensions. Blaming the pandemic on an ethnic group or country can provide a convenient excuse for various failings at home, or may provide pretext to push a geopolitical or protectionist agenda. This is perhaps even more dangerous than using the pandemic to further domestic political outcomes, JPM warns.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: Sources state that Beijing will introduce a draft resolution tonight and will be presented as a motion to the NPC tomorrow (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24535/download?code=9o9AJWcr9Jp2luZCucYf\">preview here</a>). This will be a National Security Law that will be included in the Basic Law that prohibits acts of “treason, secession, sedition, or subversion”. This would officially ban all activities aimed at toppling the central government and the influence on Hong Kong affairs. Prior sources via SCMP noted that Chinese President Xi “expressed concern that Hong Kong was becoming a loophole in China’s national security and stressed that Hong Kong should not become the weak link.” Several analysts and government sources expected the legislation to be discussed at the NPC, but eyes are on the format and as to what extent. NPC will be holding a news briefing today at 14:40BST</p><p><strong>WHY THIS MATTERS:</strong> Last year, Hong Kong saw a string of violent pro-democracy protests after the introduction of the now-withdrawn extradition bill – which would have seen some Hong Kong citizens sent to the mainland for trial. The bill challenged the “one country, two systems” aspect of the Mainland/Hong Kong relationship and thus citizens worried that Hong Kong was under the illusion of democracy.</p><p><strong>THE DETAILS:</strong> A source said&nbsp;the new legislation for Hong Kong would be included in Annex 3 of Hong Kong’s Basic Law. The process would be a marked deviation from the Mainland’s earlier stance to allow Hong Kong to draft and enact within its own legislation.&nbsp; By passing the National Security law and adding it to Annex 3 of the Basic Law – this means certain national laws that were exempted for Hong Kong will now be included. The second option is to “to reinterpret some colonial ordinances and turn them into a de facto national security law”, according to a source. Meanwhile, several diplomats said that both options are likely to cause an uproar in Hong Kong.</p><p><strong>WIDER IMPLICATIONS:</strong> Washington passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act – where the US has until the end of the month to decide whether Hong Kong can remain autonomous from China, a prerequisite for expanding preferential US trading and investment. China accuses the US of “blackmailing” the Hong Kong government with the Act. China’s Foreign Ministry’s Hong Kong Office said US actions on Hong Kong is a blatant interference on China's internal affairs and China will unswervingly safeguard sovereignty.</p>",

Desks expect the approval of further corporate relief measures, higher fiscal deficit target and for local government to get the green light on debt issuing to fund infrastructure development.</p><p><strong>TRADE WAR:</strong></p><p>The deterioration in US and China relations remains a key theme in markets. However, SCMP citing a Chinese Government Adviser said <strong>the upcoming “two sessions” (CPPCC and NPC) will not have much of a direct bearing on the trade deal, but the language used will hint at Beijing future approaches in dealing with Washington</strong> – “Whether [China] chooses to go full-on confrontation, or continue to maintain competition without decoupling, that is what we need to pay attention to”, the official said.</p><p><strong>GDP GROWTH TARGET:</strong></p><p>The annual setting of the growth target has been a controversial topic against the backdrop of the pandemic. <strong>Some economists believe that China could set a two-year target for 2020 and 2021</strong> as opposed to a single target for 2020. “If so, the average annual growth rate (for the two years) will be set at about 6 percent.\", according to an analyst cited by SCMP. <strong>Other sources said a numerical target may be dropped altogether</strong> and instead a “description of the goal for the GDP growth” could be issued, albeit no final decision has been made and details remain light as to how this will be achieved. Desks also note the move will untie the hands of policymakers from being obliged to issue stimulus to meet the target. For reference, newswires forecast the 2020 metric at 1.8% after a Q1 contraction of 6.8%. <strong>Analysts believe that the importance of a GDP growth target will be downplayed</strong> - instead, the NPC will give more credence to stabilising employment.</p><p><strong>LABOUR MARKET:</strong></p><p>There are expectations for the stabilisation of the jobs market to be top priority at this year’s confab amid the vast number of people unemployed or forced into furlough. Some do not expect a major change vs. last year’s targets, albeit these will prove harder to conquer given the backdrop of the pandemic, and with some provinces reporting small numbers of resurging cases. HSBC expects registered and surveyed unemployment rate below 4.5% ad 5.5% apiece and new job creation target of at least 10mln. <strong>Stimulus measures will likely have to be upscaled</strong> to achieve this – “although lower growth this year will likely lead to more slack in the labour market, with sufficient policy support it is possible to keep the official unemployment rates below the targets”, HSBC says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/24b3b65b-769e-44a2-98c2-5ba642015b9b.jpg\"></figure><p><strong>FISCAL STIMULUS:</strong></p><p><strong>China’s Finance Minister Liu Kun stated that China will increase its 2020 fiscal expenditure</strong> to help cushion the pandemic’s impact on the economy – but did not provide exact details other than the <strong>deficit/GDP ratio will “rise modestly” and that the issuance ceiling for local government special bonds will be increased.</strong> Liu Kun also stated that they would “expand the results of the tax cut” for businesses enacted last year. The Finance Ministry has already rolled out tax and fee cuts totalling over CNY 800bln this year, albeit this is not believed to be sufficient.</p><p><strong>REFORM AGENDA:</strong></p><p>Some say the growth shock resulted by the pandemic could pave the way for fresh reforms to bolster growth. “China’s supply-side reforms will likely focus on increasing flexibility in the allocation of production factors, including land, labour, capital, technology and data”, HSBC predicts, with priority to be land and labour reforms. <strong>Furthermore, China could also unveil guidance on how to strengthen cross-border relationships</strong> in time of global crisis - such as easier restrictions for market access, narrowing the negative list size alongside cutting some import tariffs.</p>",

If the consensus is achieved, it would be the seventh consecutive lower weekly reading, and the cumulative total will have risen to 41.2mln since mid-March. This week’s data also coincides with the survey period for the BLS May jobs report, released 5th June. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-us-initial-jobless-claims-seen-lower-for-seventh-straight-week-politics-may-start-playing-a-role-21-05-2020\">Full preview here.</a></p><p><strong>PHILLY FED/MARKIT PMI (0830EDT/1330 BST and 0945 EDT/1445 BST): </strong>A rise in the headline to -41.5 from -56.6 would not be too surprising, Pantheon Macroeconomics said, noting that the nature of diffusion indices is that they tend to bounce after hitting a bottom – that was what was seen in the Empire Fed survey earlier in the week, and as such, there may be upside to the consensus view. The data will be eyed in the context of the May ISM reports (manufacturing due 1st June, and non-manufacturing due 3rd June). Analysts are watching the surveys closely for clues about the shape of the recovery. Accordingly, the Markit flash PMIs for May will also be in focus, with the Street looking for the services gauge to rise to 30.0 from 26.7, and the manufacturing to rise to 38.0 from 36.1.</p><p><strong>SENATE BILL: </strong>Senators on Wednesday unanimously passed a bill which required Chinese companies listed in the US to provide greater accountability. The Bill states these companies must comply with US auditing rules, or face delisting ­– presently, some firms, like Alibaba (BABA) are exempt. The Bill states that delisting could take place IF a company has not made accountability audits available and has gone three straight years without being examined. This is certainly more benign than the headlines had given the impression, on the first release. However, it is indicative of the deteriorating tone between US/China; the unanimous vote follows the failure of similar proposals to get through Congress in the past, and analysts are concerned about the prospect of any action which impedes capital flows or disrupts supply chains. It is a story to keep on the radar.</p><p><strong>POLITICAL RISKS EMERGING: </strong>As virus risk abates globally, political/geopolitical fallout is emerging as a new significant risk for economy and financial markets, JPM argues (Kolanovic/Kaplan). It observes that economies of largest economic regions – CA, NY – are yet to reopen, and populism is putting at risk global cooperation and trade; the Senate Bill to bar Chinese companies from being listed on US exchanges is a case in point. It acknowledges that this is more of a ‘tail risk’ rather than an imminent threat, so still maintains its positive outlook on markets. The bank details how COVID will influence the election dynamic: the administration shifted to forecasting a larger negative impact (setting the stage for them to ‘outperform’, and eg. ‘hedging’ the Georgia reopening), shifting the pandemic blame to China and the WHO, and at the same time shifting the blame for economic pain to large blue states that are perceived to be slowing down the reopening of the economy ­­– and activity across the country is now largely following party lines. Another fault line is the role and scope of government in everyday life, begging questions like: should lockdowns be recommended or mandated, how much of individual freedoms should be limited, etc. Government employees have been less affected by lockdowns than small private businesses. These ideological fault lines are, to an extent, replicated and exported to other countries in the west. Working remotely has benefit large technology firms, whose share prices are near all-time highs; JPM says this might create a (perhaps wrong) impression of conflicts of interest when some of these firms are influencing policies related to reopening (such as reimagining education, health care, vaccines, contact tracking and tracing etc). Globally, JPM notes that demagogues and radicals across the world will be tempted to use COVID to blame immigrants, people of different race, or use the pandemic as a pretext to intensify geopolitical tensions. Blaming the pandemic on an ethnic group or country can provide a convenient excuse for various failings at home, or may provide pretext to push a geopolitical or protectionist agenda. This is perhaps even more dangerous than using the pandemic to further domestic political outcomes, JPM warns.</p>",

(AFP)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets struggled to sustain the impetus from the rebound on Wall St where stocks were underpinned by hopes of a pick-up in economic activity</strong> after all US states were said to have at least partially reopened and as the continued recovery in oil prices also supported the risk tone, with sentiment in Asia eventually clouded by ongoing US-China tensions. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.4%)</strong> was initially led higher by strength in energy names although the index later reversed the moves after its top weighted financials sector dipped into the red and amid the souring ties with China. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.2%)</strong> also failed to hold on to opening gains despite reports Japan is set to lift the emergency declarations in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo, but with Tokyo not included in the status lifting, while participants digested mixed trade data that showed Exports at a narrower than expected contraction, which was still the worst decline since 2009. <strong>Hang Seng (-0.5%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%)</strong> were subdued as the war of words between US and China persisted with US President Trump alleging the incompetence of China was behind the mass worldwide killing and that China’s disinformation and propaganda attack on the US and Europe is a disgrace. Furthermore, the White House released a report blasting China for its actions ranging from predatory economic policies to human rights abuses, and the US Senate recently passed the bill aimed at increasing oversight of Chinese companies that could see them delisted from US exchanges. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked the upside seen in T-notes following the hostile US-China rhetoric and decent results at the new US 20-year auction which disproved the naysayers that had anticipated a lacklustre auction, while the BoJ presence in the market and mild deterioration in risk tone also added to the upside for JGBs.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day.

Bourses see broad-based losses amid the escalating rhetoric between US and China as sentiment between the nations hit a low – with Spain faring slightly better after earlier underperformance on account of its extended State of Emergency, while Switzerland and Scandi markets are closed amid holidays. Broader sectors are all in the red with defensives faring better than cyclicals – suggesting risk aversion across the market, whilst the breakdown pains a similar picture with banks and Travel &amp; Leisure among the laggards. In terms of individual movers, easyJet (+6.3%) holds onto gains after announcing the resumption of flights from 15th June. Co. believes there is sufficient customer demand to support profitable flying. Initial schedule will comprise mainly of domestic flights in UK and France, Further routes will be announced in the coming weeks as customer demand increases. Sticking with the airline sector, Lufthansa (+4.8%)&nbsp; confirmed it is in advanced talks with the German Govt’s Economic Stabilisation Fund (WSF) on a stabilisation package comprising of measures amounting up to EUR 9bln, with the package subject to approval by the European Commission. On the flip side, Altice (-12%) shares tumble post earnings.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR/GBP -</strong> Mixed to weaker than forecast French and German PMIs were rather misleading, as the preliminary survey for the bloc as a whole beat on all counts to keep the Euro elevated and more resistant than other majors against a broad Dollar revival. Indeed, Eur/Usd remains underpinned above 1.0950 even though the DXY has pared some losses from Wednesday’s 99.001 low to sit a bit more comfortably within a 99.183-434 range ahead of US PMIs and the latest weekly jobless claims data. Similarly, albeit to a lesser extent, the Pound has regained composure in wake of UK services, manufacturing and composite readings all surpassing consensus, with Cable back above the 1.2200 handle and Eur/Gbp just holding below 0.9000. However, the former still looks bearish from a technical standpoint after breaching one side of an inverse head and shoulders chart formation at 1.2225, while a softer than forecast CBI trends metric did little to spur any action.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD -</strong> Renewed risk aversion and further assurances from RBA Governor Lowe about turning up the QE dial again if needed have prompted a pull-back in the Aussie and Kiwi from midweek peaks vs their US counterpart, as Aud/Usd reverses from 0.6600+ and Nzd/Usd is back under 0.6150. Note much in the way of additional impetus gleaned from CBA PMIs overnight, but NZ retail sales could be more pivotal later.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF/JPY</strong> - Firm crude prices continue to cushion the Loonie from downturns in broader risk sentiment, but Usd/Cad has further from sub-1.3900 lows into a band up to 1.3946, while the Franc is pivoting 0.9650 and Yen is consolidating between 107.49-84 parameters following a much wider than expected Japanese trade deficit due to exports plunging around 3 times more than imports.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM -</strong> The Scandi Crowns have both lost momentum amidst the aforementioned risk-off mood, with Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok rebounding after forays to fresh multi-month lows towards 10.5000 and 10.8500 respectively, but the overall trend remains bearish in cross terms. Meanwhile, EMs have also handed back some of their recent gains as the clock ticks down to CBRT and SARB rate verdicts that are predicted to reveal matching 50 bp benchmark reductions, but could conceivably culminate in more aggressive easing moves. Usd/Try is straddling 6.7900 at present and Usd/Zar has reversed through 18.0000 after crossing the psychological mark on Wednesday.</p><p>RBA Governor Lowe said the future remains unusually uncertain in which one uncertainty is the pace of which restrictions are eased and another source is the level of confidence people have about their future, while he added the RBA remain prepared to scale up bond purchases again if necessary but noted there is a limit to what can be achieved with monetary policy. Furthermore, RBA Governor Lowe added there is no change to thinking on negative rates which are still extraordinarily unlikely and that the costs of negative rates exceed the benefits. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Not much to choose between the pan Eurozone and UK PMIs in terms of preliminary prints exceeding expectations, on balance, but <strong>Gilts </strong>are still clearly ahead in the core bond stakes after correcting higher off the Liffe open and getting to within a tick of Monday’s pinnacle.

Bourses see broad-based losses amid the escalating rhetoric between US and China as sentiment between the nations hit a low – with Spain faring slightly better after earlier underperformance on account of its extended State of Emergency, while Switzerland and Scandi markets are closed amid holidays. Broader sectors are all in the red with defensives faring better than cyclicals – suggesting risk aversion across the market, whilst the breakdown pains a similar picture with banks and Travel &amp; Leisure among the laggards. In terms of individual movers, easyJet (+6.3%) holds onto gains after announcing the resumption of flights from 15th June. Co. believes there is sufficient customer demand to support profitable flying. Initial schedule will comprise mainly of domestic flights in UK and France, Further routes will be announced in the coming weeks as customer demand increases. Sticking with the airline sector, Lufthansa (+4.8%)&nbsp; confirmed it is in advanced talks with the German Govt’s Economic Stabilisation Fund (WSF) on a stabilisation package comprising of measures amounting up to EUR 9bln, with the package subject to approval by the European Commission. On the flip side, Altice (-12%) shares tumble post earnings.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>EUR/GBP - Mixed to weaker than forecast French and German PMIs were rather misleading, as the preliminary survey for the bloc as a whole beat on all counts to keep the Euro elevated and more resistant than other majors against a broad Dollar revival. Indeed, Eur/Usd remains underpinned above 1.0950 even though the DXY has pared some losses from Wednesday’s 99.001 low to sit a bit more comfortably within a 99.183-434 range ahead of US PMIs and the latest weekly jobless claims data. Similarly, albeit to a lesser extent, the Pound has regained composure in wake of UK services, manufacturing and composite readings all surpassing consensus, with Cable back above the 1.2200 handle and Eur/Gbp just holding below 0.9000. However, the former still looks bearish from a technical standpoint after breaching one side of an inverse head and shoulders chart formation at 1.2225, while a softer than forecast CBI trends metric did little to spur any action.</p><p>AUD/NZD - Renewed risk aversion and further assurances from RBA Governor Lowe about turning up the QE dial again if needed have prompted a pull-back in the Aussie and Kiwi from midweek peaks vs their US counterpart, as Aud/Usd reverses from 0.6600+ and Nzd/Usd is back under 0.6150. Note much in the way of additional impetus gleaned from CBA PMIs overnight, but NZ retail sales could be more pivotal later.</p><p>CAD/CHF/JPY - Firm crude prices continue to cushion the Loonie from downturns in broader risk sentiment, but Usd/Cad has further from sub-1.3900 lows into a band up to 1.3946, while the Franc is pivoting 0.9650 and Yen is consolidating between 107.49-84 parameters following a much wider than expected Japanese trade deficit due to exports plunging around 3 times more than imports.</p><p>SCANDI/EM - The Scandi Crowns have both lost momentum amidst the aforementioned risk-off mood, with Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok rebounding after forays to fresh multi-month lows towards 10.5000 and 10.8500 respectively, but the overall trend remains bearish in cross terms. Meanwhile, EMs have also handed back some of their recent gains as the clock ticks down to CBRT and SARB rate verdicts that are predicted to reveal matching 50 bp benchmark reductions, but could conceivably culminate in more aggressive easing moves. Usd/Try is straddling 6.7900 at present and Usd/Zar has reversed through 18.0000 after crossing the psychological mark on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Not much to choose between the pan Eurozone and UK PMIs in terms of preliminary prints exceeding expectations, on balance, but Gilts are still clearly ahead in the core bond stakes after correcting higher off the Liffe open and getting to within a tick of Monday’s pinnacle.

        "content": "<p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p><p>Mixed to weaker than forecast French and German PMIs were rather misleading, as the preliminary survey for the bloc as a whole beat on all counts to keep the Euro elevated and more resistant than other majors against a broad Dollar revival. Indeed, Eur/Usd remains underpinned above 1.0950 even though the <strong>DXY</strong> has pared some losses from Wednesday’s 99.001 low to sit a bit more comfortably within a 99.183-434 range ahead of US PMIs and the latest weekly jobless claims data. Similarly, albeit to a lesser extent, the Pound has regained composure in wake of UK services, manufacturing and composite readings all surpassing consensus, with Cable back above the 1.2200 handle and Eur/Gbp just holding below 0.9000. However, the former still looks bearish from a technical standpoint after breaching one side of an inverse head and shoulders chart formation at 1.2225 in the run up to CBI industrial trends.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Renewed risk aversion and further assurances from RBA Governor Lowe about turning up the QE dial again if needed have prompted a pull-back in the Aussie and Kiwi from midweek peaks vs their US counterpart, as Aud/Usd reverses from 0.6600+ and Nzd/Usd is back under 0.6150. Note much in the way of additional impetus gleaned from CBA PMIs overnight, but NZ retail sales could be more pivotal later.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>Firm crude prices continue to cushion the Loonie from downturns in broader risk sentiment, but Usd/Cad has further from sub-1.3900 lows into a band up to 1.3946, while the Franc is pivoting 0.9650 and Yen is consolidating between 107.49-84 parameters following a much wider than expected Japanese trade deficit due to exports plunging around 3 times more than imports.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The Scandi Crowns have both lost momentum amidst the aforementioned risk-off mood, with Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok rebounding after forays to fresh multi-month lows towards 10.5000 and 10.8500 respectively, but the overall trend remains bearish in cross terms. Meanwhile, EMs have also handed back some of their recent gains as the clock ticks down to CBRT and SARB rate verdicts that are predicted to reveal matching 50 bp benchmark reductions, but could conceivably culminate in more aggressive easing moves. Usd/Try is straddling 6.7900 at present and Usd/Zar has reversed through 18.0000 after crossing the psychological mark on Wednesday.</p>",

        "reaction_details": "",
        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>EXPECTATIONS:</strong> The Street expects initial jobless claims data for the week ending 16th May to print 2.4mln (range: 1.7-2.75mln) from a previous 2.98mln. If the consensus is achieved, it would be the seventh consecutive lower weekly reading, and the cumulative total will have risen to 41.2mln since mid-March. This week’s data also coincides with the survey period for the BLS May jobs report, released 5th June.</p><p><strong>POLITICS:</strong> It is worth framing the data within a political context. With the cumulative total ticking up to eye watering levels, some business that have closed might never reopen, further pressure will be on Washington lawmakers to enact further stimulus measures to support the economy. President Trump is on pace to rack up more debt in four years than President Obama did in eight, and this is concerning some Republicans, who are seeking ways to revive the economy without further fiscal largesse. Democrats in the House have already passed a USD 3trln relief bill, and this has seen push-back from Senate Republicans; that, however, might change as job losses continue, and the death toll continues to rise. Additionally, the Fed has also been calling for more fiscal support. Chair Powell has said the Fed could further help companies with liquidity issues for a while, but over time, more fiscal help will be needed, and at least three-to-six more months of government support would be required, arguing that further support was crucial to any recovery, and that if policymakers were careful about how the economy is reopened, and people take these social distancing measures forward, then the recovery can begin fairly soon, and job losses seen since mid-March may prove to be temporary.</p><p><strong>TREND:</strong> Jobless claims were lower for a sixth straight week, last week’s data showed, although it was another print above the Street’s view (2.98mln vs consensus 2.5mln). Pantheon Macroeconomics said the consensus always appeared ambitious, since it implied a significantly faster rate of decline than the -15% per week trend in previous weeks. “That said, we are a bit disappointed by the outturn, which shows claims down only 6.2%; early evidence for this week, in the form of daily data from Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, alongside Google search numbers, points to claims falling more quickly again, to about 2,500K, but our mid-June target for the first sub-1M reading has to be pushed back to the end of the month.” The cumulative total since mid-March has now risen to around 36.8mln, and Pantheon says that represents a 34.8mln increase compared to the pre-virus trend. Continuing claims, at 22.8mln, are around 68% of the total number of initial jobless claims from the 14th March period through the latest week, and the consultancy explains that “in other words, few of the people who have lost their jobs as a result of the virus have found new positions; however, it is worth noting “that the proportion of the previous week’s initial claims then appearing in the continuing claims numbers a week later has fallen for seven straight weeks, so hiring is not completely dead,” adding that “presumably, most of the modest upturn is in the states which are starting to re-open.”</p>",

Ahead, the expectation is that the SARB’s key rate will remain unchanged until Q3 2021. Analysts see the South African economy contracting by 6.5% in 2020, but are optimistic that growth will pick up to 2.9% in 2021.</li><li><strong>POTENTIALLY BIGGER MOVE: </strong>BNP Paribas is looking for a cut of 75-100bps at the May meeting, arguing that the SARB would likely prefer to front load any reductions in anticipation of more substantial economic pressures ahead, and says that “strong deflation in fuel prices and collapsing demand are unlikely to outweigh a weaker ZAR and its limited pass-through to CPI, averaging a 17-year low of 2.8% in 2020, breaching the lower bound of the SARB’s 3- 6% target.”</li><li><strong>QE:</strong> The SARB has been buying bonds in secondary markets to assist the government’s COVID Response efforts, and its holdings have now risen to ZAR 20.6bln; desks will be paying attention to any commentary hinting at more support ahead of South Africa's 24th June budget, where the government is expected to announce further support measures. Recently, there has been calls from the ruling ANC party for the SARB to enter primary markets to support the government as the deficit ticks higher -- some policy makers have argued that money printing would lead to higher inflation and weaken the currency --although analysts expect that, for now, the normally conservative central bank will lean back against these calls.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: All 15 analysts polled by Reuters expect the Central Bank to implement another cut to the Weekly Repo Rate, currently at 8.75%. However, as is usually the case, economists are split over the magnitude of the reduction – with the range varying between 100-50bps and the median pointing to the lower end.</p><p><strong>PRIOR MEETING:</strong> The Central Bank has cut a cumulative 1525bps since July 2019. At the most recent confab, the CBRT opted to reduce its Weekly Repo Rate by 100bps, at the top of analysts’ forecast range – taking real rates deeper into negative territory. Notably, the Central Bank assessed that risks to its year-end inflation forecasts are to the downside, whilst stating that economic activity started to weaken in mid-March due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on external trade, tourism, and domestic demand. On the Lira, the Bank repeated the softer currency effect on inflation is offset by weaker oil prices, net-net a favourable impact. The Bank reaffirmed its “cautious monetary stance” and said it will be determined considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend, but emphasised that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.</p><p><strong>RESERVES AND LIRA</strong>: Depleting reserves has been a major factor behind the Lira’s recent weakness, with USD reserves dwindling as the Central Bank attempts to defend the Try from further depreciation. These woes prompted USD/TRY to reach all-time highs at 7.2690, surpassing the 7.2350 peak set at the height of the previous Lira crisis. As such swap lines have been requested by the CBRT, with little support from the ECB, and Fed, whilst reports of lines intstigated with the BoE and BoJ were also refuted. However, it was reported that the line with Qatar has been expanded three-fold to USD 15bln. However, desks worry about the inflation outlook given the Lira’s fragility and rising oil prices.</p><p><strong>DATA</strong>: In terms of data, Apr CPI YY dipped to 10.94% from 11.86%, while the CBRT also lowered its end-year forecast to 9.38% from 9.76% - in-fitting with efforts to get inflation back to target. Credit Suisse believes another rate cut is warranted in the near term given the current environment, and “the risk to our three-month policy rate forecast of 7.50% is firmly to the downside”, the Swiss bank says.</p>",

US President Trump overnight repeated his criticism on China in which he suggests it is trying desperately to deflect the pain and carnage the country spread throughout the world, and added disinformation and propaganda attack on the US and Europe is a disgrace. Yesterday, the President blamed the pandemic on the “incompetence of China”. Trump also aimed at the WHO for being China-biased, whilst Secretary of State Pompeo mentioned the “troubling” nature of the WHO Head’s links to China. US warned if WHO does not commit to substantive improvements within the next 30 days, the US will permanently freeze its funding and reconsider membership.</p><p>China remains angered at US’ finger-pointing - Chinese Foreign Ministry yesterday, regarding US President Trump's letter to WHO, said the letter attempts to mislead the public to smear China and tries to shift the blame of its own \"incompetent\" response. Reports last week via Global Times noted of a “tsunami of anger among Chinese trade insiders”, citing sources. The article mentioned growing calls on the Chinese side to void the current trade deal and renegotiate one skewed more towards China’s interests – something Trump said he will not do. Meanwhile, Diplomatic<strong> backchannels between US and China are said to have dried up and some also suggest behind the scenes meetings and messages between their officials have ground to a halt.</strong></p><p><strong>TENSIONS ARE GROWING ON NUMEROUS PLATFORMS:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>MARKET ACCESS OBSTACLES:</strong> US Senate passed a bill aimed at increasing oversight of Chinese companies which could require Chinese firms to de-list from US exchanges and requires companies to certify no government control. <strong>The bill requires companies looking to be listed in the US to establish that they are not controlled or owned by a foreign government</strong>. Furthermore, the bill seeks audit submissions for inspection. Meanwhile, sources said Nasdaq is moving to tighten listing rules and restricting IPOs. As such, reports emerged that <strong>China will push ahead with listings of domestic companies in London</strong>, as its seeks to move away from US amid an escalation in tensions.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>HUAWEI</strong>: US announced measures that prevent Huawei from acquiring semiconductors and chipsets made using US software/technology. The US Commerce Department also warned that it expects Huawei’s current license extension to be final '90-day extension'. This came shortly after a statement from Trump in which he extended the executive order protecting the US supply chain from Huawei and ZTE for an additional year. In response, GT’s Chief Editor tweeted that <strong>China will activate the \"unreliable entity list\" if US further blocks key technology supply to Huawei</strong>, China will restrict or investigate US companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Cisco and Apple (AAPL), and suspend purchase of Boeing (BA) planes. Furthermore, reports via Nikkei said TSMC, Huawei’s key supplier, has stopped accepting new orders from the Chinese Co. amid US restrictions – reports TSCM downplayed as “market rumours”, but refrained from disclosing order information. Nonetheless, this opens the door to field of conflict between US and China over Taiwan.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>TAIWAN</strong>: China issued warnings to Washington after US officials sent rare and high-level congratulatory messages to anti-Chinese Taiwanese President Tsai and her second-term inauguration, following her landslide victory in January. China seems to be threatened by the growing alliance between US and Taipei, an area China claims territory over – with some participants highlighting influence over TSMC as an avenue for an attack on Huawei. <strong>China has urged the US to cut official ties with Taiwan and to stop upgrading substantive relations, interfering in China's internal affairs,</strong> and to stop undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as US/China relations. Meanwhile, China's Foreign Ministry <strong>said China will take necessary countermeasures on US'</strong> wrong behaviours regarding Taiwan, and added the US must bear the consequences</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>HONG KONG:</strong> Bitterness over Hong Kong remains between US and China following the pro-democracy Hong Kong violence over last year amid growing concern over China’s influence over Hong Kong and the “illusion” of democracy. <strong>Washington passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act –</strong> where the US has until the end of the month to decide whether Hong Kong can remain autonomous from China, a prerequisite for expanding preferential US trading and investment. <strong>China accuses the US of “blackmailing” the Hong Kong government</strong> with the Act. China’s Foreign Ministry’s Hong Kong Office said US actions on Hong Kong is a blatant interference on China's internal affairs and China will unswervingly safeguard sovereignty.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>MILITARY: Talks surrounding displaying military capability have been more abundant in Chinese media recently</strong>. GT’s Hu Xijin called on China to expand nuclear warheads and enhance nuclear deterrence, adding “we need to possess enough capability so that the US dare not proactively attack China under any circumstances”. Meanwhile, heading into the NPC, reports emerged via SCMP that <strong>China’s military leaders are calling for a substantially higher military budget to be announced</strong> amid “resources to cope with volatile challenges at home and overseas. But top of the list is the growing confrontation with the US.” Moreover, there were reports that the <strong>US Air Force has increased flyovers over waters near China</strong> alongside increased military operations by the US Navy – “China’s military observers warned of rising risks of military conflict between the two countries” between the two countries.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LOOKING AHEAD: </strong>Tomorrow marks the opening of China’s NPC - where members will vote on economic policies for this year. However, SCMP citing a Chinese Government Adviser said the “<strong>two sessions” (CPPCC and NPC) will not have much of a direct bearing on the trade deal, but the language used will hint at Beijing future approaches in dealing with Washington</strong> – “Whether [China] chooses to go full-on confrontation, or continue to maintain competition without decoupling, that is what we need to pay attention to”, the official said (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-china-s-2020-national-people-s-congress-npc-meeting-begins-on-22nd-may-2020-21-05-2020\">Full NPC Preview</a>). The situation remains fluid and very much a question as to who pulls the trigger first if tensions do not ease. Note – US President Trump said he is mulling a G7 summit on or around June 10th (original date) at Camp David.</p>",

A well received 20 year US auction prompted an unwind of pre-sale concessionary hedges and re-flattening along the Treasury curve, while optimism surrounding Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine was dampened somewhat by nondisclosure of key trial data and relations between the US and China continue to sour. Hence, renewed safe-haven demand for core bonds ahead of preliminary PMIs, weekly US claims and the Philly Fed survey amidst a raft of Central Bank speakers.</p>",

Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) were subdued as the war of words between US and China persisted with US President Trump alleging the incompetence of China was behind the mass worldwide killing and that China’s disinformation and propaganda attack on the US and Europe is a disgrace. Furthermore, the White House released a report blasting China for its actions ranging from predatory economic policies to human rights abuses, and the US Senate recently passed the bill aimed at increasing oversight of Chinese companies that could see them delisted from US exchanges.</p><p><strong>FTSE 100</strong></p><p><strong>EX Dividend – Intertek (ITK LN), Morrison (MRW LN), Tesco (TSCO LN) </strong>&amp;<strong> Sage Group (SGE LN) </strong>will trade without entitlement to their dividend.

Minutes noted that System Open Market Account manager suggested that repo operation be made a backstop by raising the min-rate as conditions have improved in the funding markets and FOMC saw no risk that the EFFR would move below the target range when an IOER hike was raised. <strong>A few participants suggested the balance sheet could be used to reinforce forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate </strong>through purchases of Treasury securities on a scale necessary to keep yields at short- to medium-term maturities capped at specified levels for a period of time.</p><p><strong>FOMC Minutes stated that some commented the Committee could make its forward guidance for the path for the federal funds rate more explicit</strong>. For example, the Committee could adopt outcome-based forward guidance that would specify macroeconomic outcomes—such as a certain level of the unemployment rate or of the inflation rate—that must be achieved before it would consider raising the target rate. <strong>Furthermore, respondents to Desk surveys attached almost no probability to the FOMC implementing negative policy rates.</strong></p><p>Several also said the FOMC may need to provide further clarity regarding its intentions for asset purchases as uncertainty about the evolution of the purchases could increase over time. A number of participants emphasized that regulators should encourage banks to prepare for possible downside scenarios by further limiting payouts to shareholders, thereby preserving loss-absorbing capital.</p><p><strong>CORONAVIRUS UPDATE</strong></p><p>US COVID-19 cases rose 1.6% to 1,528,235 and the death toll rose 1.5% to 91,664 (Prev. +1.0%), while AFP noted there were 1561 deaths in US from coronavirus in 24 hours citing the Johns Hopkins tracker.

(+0.1%)</strong> were subdued as the war of words between US and China persisted with US President Trump alleging the incompetence of China was behind the mass worldwide killing and that China’s disinformation and propaganda attack on the US and Europe is a disgrace. Furthermore, the White House released a report blasting China for its actions ranging from predatory economic policies to human rights abuses, and the US Senate recently passed the bill aimed at increasing oversight of Chinese companies that could see them delisted from US exchanges. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked the upside seen in T-notes following the hostile US-China rhetoric and decent results at the new US 20-year auction which disproved the naysayers that had anticipated a lacklustre auction, while the BoJ presence in the market and mild deterioration in risk tone also added to the upside for JGBs.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>The temperamental tone helped the <strong>DXY</strong> recover from a 3-day consecutive loss and extend the rebound from support at the 99.00 level. The recent FOMC minutes did little to spur price action as it noted policymakers remained committed to using full range of tools to support the economy and that rates will be left at low levels until they are convinced that the recovery is on track, with participants also looking out for more comments from Fed Chair Powell later today. The resurgence in the greenback forced <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> to give back some of this week’s gains, resulting in the single currency retreating further away from resistance at 1.1000. GBP/USD tested 1.2200 to the downside after a breakdown of support circa 1.2225 and not helped by comments from BoE Governor Bailey who did not rule out negative rates on principle and acknowledged he has changed his position on negative rates a bit. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were mixed amid the overnight indecision, while antipodeans pared recent gains with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> retreating below the 0.6600 handle due to the soured mood and with RBA Governor Lowe commenting that the future remains unusually uncertain and that they are prepared to scale up bond purchases again if necessary but also noted limitations of monetary policy and dismissed the likelihood of negative rates.</p><p>RBA Governor Lowe said the future remains unusually uncertain in which one uncertainty is the pace of which restrictions are eased and another source is the level of confidence people have about their future, while he added the RBA remain prepared to scale up bond purchases again if necessary but noted there is a limit to what can be achieved with monetary policy. Furthermore, RBA Governor Lowe added there is no change to thinking on negative rates which are still extraordinarily unlikely and that the costs of negative rates exceed the benefits. (Newswires)</p><p>China Global Times stated China has the power to hurt the Australian economy but won't fire the first shot, while it hopes Australia can release more goodwill and take more measures to repair its relationship with its largest trading partner China. (Twitter)</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were mixed with in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures extended on gains and approached closer towards the USD 34.00/bbl level on continued momentum from the global oil market rebalancing as economies reopen and following the surprise draw in headline DoE crude inventories. Conversely, <strong>gold</strong> prices were on the backfoot after meeting resistance around the USD 1750/oz level and as the greenback recovers from a 3-day losing streak, while copper was kept range bound amid the indecisive overnight risk tone.</p><p>China is expected to raise crude output by around 2% Y/Y for 2020, according to CNPC Research. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>US President Trump and French President Macron discussed concerns about the deterioration of foreign interference in Libya and have agreed on an urgent need for de-escalation. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Treasury yields fell across the curve by between 1-3bps and major curve spreads are mixed at settlement. As US players arrived, the curve was bear-steepening moderately, perhaps due to corporate supply and pre-20-year auction hedging, with the complex content to look through moves in equity markets. However, buying action was seen in wake of reports that the Senate had passed a bill that aimed at increasing oversight of Chinese companies, which could require Chinese firms listed in the US to de-list from US exchanges, and required companies to certify no government control. The story, while not a law yet, reinforces the tensions between US/China. The new 20-year auction was decent, although tailed 0.7bps, though there is no recent auction history to compare the metrics. Last week, analysts had modelled a high yield of 1.26bps, and the stop-out level was 4bps richer than that. Cover was decent at 2.53x when compared to similar auctions, while indirect participation was also encouraging (as seen in the recent 10s and 30s auction), suggesting that there is still foreign demand for USTs even at these low yields. T-note (M0) futures settled 7 ticks higher at 139-02+.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets only partially sustain the rebound on Wall St where sentiment was underpinned by hopes of a pick-up in economic activity after all US states were said to have at least partially reopened, and with the continued recovery in oil prices also underpinning risk sentiment, but with advances in the region limited amid ongoing US-China tensions. ASX 200 (-0.1%) was initially led higher by strength in energy names although the index later reversed the moves after the top weighted financials sector dipped into the red and amid the ongoing souring relationship with China. Nikkei 225 (Unch.) also failed to hold on to opening gains despite reports Japan is set to lift the emergency declarations in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo, but with Tokyo not included in the status lifting, while participants digest mixed trade data that showed Exports at a narrower than expected contraction at -21.9% vs. Exp. -22.7%, which was still the worst decline since 2009. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are subdued as the war of words between US and China persists with US President Trump alleging the incompetence of China was behind the mass worldwide killing and that China’s disinformation and propaganda attack on the US and Europe is a disgrace. Furthermore, the White House released a report blasting China for its actions ranging from predatory economic policies to human rights abuses, and the US Senate recently passed the bill aimed at increasing oversight of Chinese companies that could see them delisted from US exchanges.</p><p>In FX markets, the temperamental tone has helped the DXY recover from a 3-day consecutive loss and extend the rebound from support at the 99.00 level. The recent FOMC minutes did little to spur price action as it noted policymakers remained committed to using full range of tools to support the economy and that rates will be left at low levels until they are convinced that the recovery is on track, with participants also looking out for more comments from Fed Chair Powell later today. The resurgence in the greenback has forced EUR/USD to give back some of this week’s gains, which had been spurred by the recovery fund proposal for the bloc, resulting to the single currency retreating further away from resistance at 1.1000. GBP/USD tests 1.2200 to the downside after a breakdown of support circa 1.2225 and not helped by comments from BoE Governor Bailey who did not rule out negative rates on principle and acknowledged he has changed his position on negative rates a bit. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are mixed amid the overnight indecision, while antipodeans pare recent gains with AUD/USD retreating below the 0.6600 handle due to the soured mood and with RBA Governor Lowe commenting that the future remains unusually uncertain and that they remain prepared to scale up bond purchases again if necessary but also noted limitations of monetary policy.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track the upside seen in T-notes following the hostile US-China rhetoric and decent results at the new US 20-year auction which disproved the naysayers that had anticipated a lacklustre auction, while the BoJ presence in the market and mild deterioration in risk tone also added to the upside for JGBs.</p>",
