Leading the way was the tech sector, that was also supported by a number of positive stories for its heavy weights. Facebook (FB) moved higher after the co. unveiled further details of its cryptocurrency which is currently enjoying widespread support amongst online vendors. PayPal (PYPL) was under pressure and Western Union (WU) sunk on the prospect of a fresh competitor. Apple (AAPL) opened in the green after reports it would step in to help Japan Display. Amazon (AMZN) moved higher after the co. announced the lease of a further 15 Boeing Freight aircraft, as the e-commerce giant looks to further expand its air network. Boeing (BA) moved higher, after receiving a big order from Korea Air, that ended a slow start for the aircraft maker at the Paris Air Show, and also securing business with Amazon. Tesla (TSLA) jumped higher pre-market on news it would revamp its Asia business, but later fell on the news that legal documents suggested the electric automaker has not met a Model 3 production goal set by Elon Musk. Nvidia (NVDA) moved higher on reports it would team up with Volvo. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) was buoyant after its ULTOMIRIS drug was approved in Japan. Similarly, Merck &amp; Co (MRK) was underpinned by the approval of its Keytruda drug. AT&amp;T (T) opened higher on the news that the telecoms co. had won the bidding for spectrum licenses covering over 98% of the US population. NiSource (NI) opened higher on the news that the utilities co. is mulling the sale of its Columbia Gas of Massachusetts unit for up to USD 2bln, but gave away gains as defensive sectors lagged the broader stock market rally. Dish Network (DISH) moved higher on the news that the co. had launched OnTech Smart Services, a new direct-to-consumer brand that will provide consumers with installation, set-up, and education for smart home devices/entertainment systems. Alibaba (BABA) moved higher on reports the co. is shuffling top executives and business units ahead of its Hong Kong listing. Lennar (LEN) sunk on a downgrade from Raymond James. Allergan (AGN) popped higher on the news that the co. is to announce a split during its Q2 earnings call. Snap (SNAP) jumped higher after receiving its second upgrade of the month. Likewise, Pinterest jumped higher on an upgrade from Wedbush. S&amp;P 500 1% at 2918, NASDAQ-100 1.5% at 7635, Dow Jones 1.4% at 26468.</p><p>The curve bull-flattened at settlement, with yields falling across the curve. The complex took influence from the Bund in the European morning after a dovish set of comments from ECB chief Draghi (more stimulus could be on the way unless the data improves), which eventually led to Bund yields hitting fresh record lows, before paring back as risk sentiment improved as Trump signalled progress was being made with China on trade ahead of the G20 meeting. Treasuries, however, remained bid, and 10-year yields fell to a whisker of the psychological 2.00% mark. 3m/10yr inversion deepened by around 6bps on the day, while major curve spreads were narrower by around 1-2bps at settlement. US T-note futures (M9) settled 5+ higher at 127-04+.</p>",

Draghi specifically said that, in the absence of an improvement in the data, such that the sustained return of inflation to the Bank's aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required (comments which he later reiterated). Draghi also said that, looking forward, the risk outlook remains tilted to the downside and indicators for the coming quarters point to lingering softness. In the coming weeks, the Governing Council will deliberate how their instruments can be adapted commensurate to the severity of the risk to price stability. He also added that APP still has considerable headroom. A few hours later, ECB sources suggested that<strong> </strong>ECB officials see rate cuts as the primary tool for any new stimulus. US President Trump criticised ECB President Draghi, saying the announcement of fresh stimulus was “unfair” as it results in a weaker EUR, before later tweeting “Germany's DAX index is up due to ECB's Draghi, (which is) very unfair to the United States!\".</p><p><strong>* CHINA: </strong>Trump announced via Twitter<a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/us-president-trump-tweets-that-he-had-a-very-good-telephone-conversation-with-president-xi-of-china-and-will-be-having-an-extended-meeting-next-week-at-the-g-20-their-respective-teams-will-begin-talks-prior-to-the-meeting-18-06-2019\"> that he had a very good telephone conversation with President Xi of China and will be having an extended meeting next week at the G-20. Moreover, their respective teams will begin talks prior to the meeting</a>. Chinese State Media soon confirmed. Soon after, a provocative tweet from China’s Global Times Editor, which said that “(the trade talks) will discuss fundamental issues in China-US relations. This phone call brings a slim hope to break the current deadlock between the two countries!\" was quickly deleted, possibly an indication that Chinese authorities are looking to tone-down hawkish commentary ahead of the G20 meeting. USTR Lighthizer, during a Congressional testimony, reaffirmed that no decision has yet been made on implementing the next round of tariffs on Chinese goods, before also noting that \"dialogue is proven to be unsuccessful\" in achieving trade reform with China and that he is unsure if tariffs alone will stop China cheating, but it’s the best instrument available.</p><p><strong>* US DEFENCE SECRETARY:</strong> US President Trump tweeted that acting secretary of defense Patrick Shanahan has decided not to proceed with his confirmation process; Secretary of the Army Mark Esper will be the new acting defense secretary.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Boris Johnson maintained his lead in the second Conservative Leadership Vote, whilst Dominic Raab was eliminated after securing fewer than 33 votes. The breakdown of the votes were as follows; Boris Johnson 126, Jeremy Hunt 46, Michael Gove 41, Rory Stewart 37, Sajid Javid 33, Dominic Raab 30 (eliminated).</p><p><strong>* US HOUSING STARTS: </strong>May housing starts came in at 1.269mln, falling by 0.9%, but still above the 1.239mln expected; April was revised higher to 1.281mln. Building permits printed 1.294mln, narrowly missing the expected 1.296mln. Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said “the strong-looking starts number is flattered by a big jump in the volatile multi-family component, up 10.9%, while single-family starts fell 6.4% to a three-month low.” However, PM notes how the opposite was true for the permits figures, reversing the April drop in the single-family component. The consultancy goes against the grain and calls on a sustained revival in sales, “If we’re right… new construction will follow.” PM note the multi-family component’s persistent flat trend indicates a flat rate of completions through the fall of 2020 at minimum, “The rental market, therefore, will remain very tight, increasing the upward pressure on rents.”</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Ahead of Wednesday’s Fed meeting, reports emerged that the White House had explored the legality of demoting Fed Chair Powell in February, following Trump's comments about firing him. The news broke just as NEC Director Kudlow was speaking to Fox News, telling the news organisation that the Fed is independent, and has its own timeline for interest rates; Kudlow also said that the White House was not considering demoting Powell, and was not taking any action to change his status.</p><p><strong>* PREVIEW: FOMC Rate Decision and Staff Economic Projections (June 2019): </strong>The base case is for rates to remain unchanged at 2.25-2.50%; however, messaging is crucial, and there will be focus on the statement and forecasts for any signs the FOMC is mulling lower rates at future meetings; the market is at least expecting the Fed to signal an openness to cut rates should the conditions require. Rate decision and staff economic projections will be published at 1900 BST/1400 EDT on 19th June 2019; post-meeting press conference with Chair Powell to commence at 1930 BST/1430 EDT.

Analysts at Citigroup on the driving factors and the WTI/Brent Arb narrowing highlight, “While these are all classified as macro risk-on trade signals, the rally is being led by July WTI, suggesting short covering ahead of Thursday’s contract expiration as the most urgent force behind the move.” The geopolitical tensions are still likely providing support, but WTI is leading, not Brent. As originally proposed by Iran, OPEC+ members are now discussing the July 10th to 12th dates for the anticipated meeting. Pinnacle OPEC member Saudi said it intends to push for tighter compliance to OPEC production curbs. \"That will mean producers such as Iraq, Nigeria and other countries that didn’t respect the December agreement will need to abide by the renewed pact,” one Saudi oil adviser said, “The move would reduce crude supplies from these producers by 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day.\" However, Russian Energy Minister Novak said there is too many uncertainties in the oil market, and it is too early to decide on the oil cut deal.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak said Russia and Iran are discussing the joint development of several oilfields at Kaspian Sea, coming after the two countries signed an MOU. In the context of reports that the US was sending additional troops to the Middle East, US General Selva said the US will respond directly to Iran if it engages US forces. US Secretary of State Pompeo later said the US will maintain the pressure campaign on Iran, but does want to deter aggression or war; adding that Washington has been engaged in many messages with Tehran.</p><p><strong>* US T-Note futures (M9) settle 5+ higher at 127-04+: </strong>The curve bull-flattened at settlement, with yields falling across the curve. The complex took influence from the Bund in the European morning after a dovish set of comments from ECB chief Draghi (more stimulus could be on the way unless the data improves), which eventually led to Bund yields hitting fresh record lows, before paring back as risk sentiment improved as Trump signalled progress was being made with China on trade ahead of the G20 meeting. Treasuries, however, remained bid, and 10-year yields fell to a whisker of the psychological 2.00% mark. 3m/10yr inversion deepened by around 6bps on the day, while major curve spreads were narrower by around 1-2bps at settlement.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 1% at 2918, NASDAQ-100 1.5% at 7635, Dow Jones 1.4% at 26468, SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary 0.8%, Consumer Staples -0.6%, Energy 1.4%, Financials 1.3%, Health Care 0.8%, Industrials 1.9%, Information Technology 1.7%, Materials 0.8%, Telecommunication Services 0.4%, Utilities -0.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Stocks rallied<strong> </strong>after<strong> </strong>US President Trump announced a resumption of US/China talks ahead of an “extended meeting” at the G20 Summit (and ECB President Draghi earlier sent European stocks higher on the prospect of further easing). Leading the way was the tech sector, that was also supported by a number of positive stories for its heavy weights. Facebook (FB) moved higher after the co. unveiled further details of its cryptocurrency which is currently enjoying widespread support amongst online vendors. PayPal (PYPL) was under pressure and Western Union (WU) sunk on the prospect of a fresh competitor. Apple (AAPL) opened in the green after reports it would step in to help Japan Display. Amazon (AMZN) moved higher after the co. announced the lease of a further 15 Boeing Freight aircraft, as the e-commerce giant looks to further expand its air network. Boeing (BA) moved higher, after receiving a big order from Korea Air, that ended a slow start for the aircraft maker at the Paris Air Show, and also securing business with Amazon. Tesla (TSLA) jumped higher pre-market on news it would revamp its Asia business, but later fell on the news that legal documents suggested the electric automaker has not met a Model 3 production goal set by Elon Musk. Nvidia (NVDA) moved higher on reports it would team up with Volvo. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) was buoyant after its ULTOMIRIS drug was approved in Japan. Similarly, Merck &amp; Co (MRK) was underpinned by the approval of its Keytruda drug. AT&amp;T (T) opened higher on the news that the telecoms co. had won the bidding for spectrum licenses covering over 98% of the US population. NiSource (NI) opened higher on the news that the utilities co. is mulling the sale of its Columbia Gas of Massachusetts unit for up to USD 2bln, but gave away gains as defensive sectors lagged the broader stock market rally. Dish Network (DISH) moved higher on the news that the co. had launched OnTech Smart Services, a new direct-to-consumer brand that will provide consumers with installation, set-up, and education for smart home devices/entertainment systems. Alibaba (BABA) moved higher on reports the co. is shuffling top executives and business units ahead of its Hong Kong listing. Lennar (LEN) sunk on a downgrade from Raymond James. Allergan (AGN) popped higher on the news that the co. is to announce a split during its Q2 earnings call. Snap (SNAP) jumped higher after receiving its second upgrade of the month. Likewise, Pinterest jumped higher on an upgrade from Wedbush.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: EUR</strong> was sent reeling after ECB President Draghi opened the door for further monetary stimulus, EURUSD falling back below the 1.1200 handle. Naturally, <strong>USD</strong> saw strength, with DXY moving above resistance at 97.60. The buck also saw some upside against <strong>JPY</strong> after Trump announced the resumption of China trade talks after his call with President Xi, albeit USDJPY remains well with its June 107.80-108.80 range. The announcement saw <strong>CNY</strong> spike higher, USDCNY pressing back towards 6.9000. The China exposed <strong>antipodeans</strong> also rose; AUDUSD breaking back above 0.6850. Meanwhile, <strong>CAD</strong> was also a beneficiary, moving higher as risk appetite returned to the market and the crude complex rallied. <strong>GBP</strong> moved sideways, ahead of tonight’s televised Conservative leadership debate and Thursday BoE MPC meeting. The strong rebound in risk appetite and subsequent gain in crude prices saw <strong>NOK</strong> move higher against EUR, in contrast to <strong>SEK</strong>, which<strong> </strong>failed to sustain gains irrespective of independent Euro weakness and some upbeat Swedish impulses via the SNDO and Riksbank business survey. <strong>EMFX</strong> rallied almost across the board, first on dovish Draghi, second on the news of a restart in US/China trade talks.</p>",

Naturally, <strong>USD</strong> saw strength, with DXY moving above resistance at 97.60. The buck also saw some upside against <strong>JPY</strong> after Trump announced the resumption of China trade talks after his call with President Xi, albeit USDJPY remains well with its June 107.80-108.80 range. The announcement saw <strong>CNY</strong> spike higher, USDCNY pressing back towards 6.9000. The China exposed <strong>antipodeans</strong> also rose; AUDUSD breaking back above 0.6850. Meanwhile, <strong>CAD</strong> was also a beneficiary, moving higher as risk appetite returned to the market and the crude complex rallied. <strong>GBP</strong> moved sideways, ahead of tonight’s televised Conservative leadership debate and Thursday BoE MPC meeting. The strong rebound in risk appetite and subsequent gain in crude prices saw <strong>NOK</strong> move higher against EUR, in contrast to <strong>SEK</strong>, which<strong> </strong>failed to sustain gains irrespective of independent Euro weakness and some upbeat Swedish impulses via the SNDO and Riksbank business survey. <strong>EMFX</strong> rallied almost across the board, first on dovish Draghi, second on the news of a restart in US/China trade talks.</p>",

Treasuries, however, remained bid, and 10-year yields fell to a whisker of the psychological 2.00% mark. 3m/10yr inversion deepened by around 6bps on the day, while major curve spreads were narrower by around 1-2bps at settlement.</p>",

Analysts at Citigroup on the driving factors and the WTI/Brent Arb narrowing highlight, “While these are all classified as macro risk-on trade signals, the rally is being led by July WTI, suggesting short covering ahead of Thursday’s contract expiration as the most urgent force behind the move.” The geopolitical tensions are still likely providing support, but WTI is leading, not Brent. As originally proposed by Iran, OPEC+ members are now discussing the July 10th to 12th dates for the anticipated meeting. Pinnacle OPEC member Saudi said it intends to push for tighter compliance to OPEC production curbs. \"That will mean producers such as Iraq, Nigeria and other countries that didn’t respect the December agreement will need to abide by the renewed pact,” one Saudi oil adviser said, “The move would reduce crude supplies from these producers by 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day.\" However, Russian Energy Minister Novak said there is too many uncertainties in the oil market, and it is too early to make a decision on the oil cut deal.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is mixed vs major counterparts, but down against most EM currencies amidst a broader upturn in risk sentiment following dovish comments from ECB President Draghi and tweets from US President Trump. To recap, the former sounded much less confident about the Eurozone inflation outlook and downside risks to price stability at Sintra, and said that if absent of any improvement in the next few weeks then additional stimulus will be necessary, while sources subsequently suggested that the primary tool in this event would be a rate cut. Meanwhile, after criticising Draghi for effectively talking the Euro down, the latter announced that he and his Chinese peer Xi talked on the phone and agreed to hold extended meetings at the upcoming G20, with trade talks to resume ahead of the Summit in Japan. The DXY has rebounded firmly from sub-97.400 lows to 97.770 and just shy of June highs at 97.802 as attention turns to the FOMC and culmination of the 2-day meeting to see if a July rate cut is flagged, as widely expected, or if the Fed disappoints with a more incremental shift in language towards easing at some stage – see our headline feed or research suite for a more detailed preview of the June policy gathering.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>As noted above, the single currency was hit hard by Draghi’s forthright remarks and Eur/Usd is hovering a few ticks above 1.1180 compared to 1.1240 or so at one stage, while Eur/<strong>GBP</strong> has retreated some 50 pips from top to bottom (0.8974-22) even though the Pound remains shaky ahead of the 2nd Tory leadership vote and results due around 18.00BST. Indeed, Cable is veering towards the base of a 1.2507-44 range and also awaiting the BBC debate that favourite Boris Johnson is scheduled to take part in.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>All beneficiaries of the aforementioned constructive US-China trade news (which Beijing essentially confirmed) and resultant rebound in risk appetite, as Nzd/Usd extended above 0.6500 and largely ignored hefty declined in GDT prices ahead of NZ Q1 current account data later. Similarly, Aud/Usd pared a chunk of its overnight losses prompted by RBA minutes underscoring market expectations for further reductions in the OCR to trade back up near 0.6875 vs circa 0.6830 at one stage. The Loonie overcame another Chinese import ban and much worse than forecast Canadian manufacturing sales with the aid of the overall improvement in sentiment, but also some momentum surrounding USMCA. Usd/Cad back down around 1.3400 within 1.3385-3432 parameters.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Franc slipped a bit further below parity vs the Buck and pared some gains against the Euro as the mood improved and initial post-Draghi positioning waned, while the Yen slumped on a sharp unwind of safe-haven flows/hedging to trade down at 108.67 from 108.07 at best.</p><p><strong>NOK/ZAR</strong></p><p>The more upbeat mood has bolstered the Norwegian Krona alongside a strong rebound in oil prices pre-API, with the Eur/Nok down through 9.7750 in contrast to Eur/<strong>SEK </strong>that failed to sustain gains irrespective of independent Euro weakness and some upbeat Swedish impulses via the SNDO and Riksbank business survey. The cross is hovering around 10.6500 vs 10.6147 at the low and a peak around 10.6600. Conversely, the Rand benefited from the risk-on tone and SA headlines that President Ramaphosa will pump more aid into Eskom to help it recover and stabilise. Usd/Zar now closer to 14.5000 than 14.8240 at the session pinnacle.</p>",

Tokyo sentiment was hampered by a firmer currency. <strong>Hang Seng (+1.0%)</strong> outperformed as business returned to normal following the recent protests and the <strong>Shanghai Comp.

The DAX (+1.2%) is now back above the 12k level after having visited a pre-Draghi low of 11,986, albeit gains are somewhat limited by a subdued IT sector, meanwhile, the FTSE 100 lags as the index fails to benefit from Draghi’s speech. In terms of sectors, financial names underperform amid the prolongation of negative rates. Defensive sectors are outperforming with healthcare and utilities the standout outperformers.&nbsp; Movers to the downside today include chipmakers following a profit warning from Siltronic (-13.0%) , citing US-China trade issues. The downbeat market outlook spilled onto STMicroelectronics (-2.0%), ASML (-1.2%) and Infineon (-5.7%), albeit the latter is more influenced by the launch of a capital increase to fund the Cypress Semiconductor acquisition. Finally, Lufthansa shares rest near the foot of the Stoxx 600 following three separate broker downgrades.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR/AUD/NZD</strong> - The single currency has slumped to the bottom of the G10 pile and even below the Aussie that was hit overnight by RBA minutes flagging further easing on the basis that benign inflation and wage trends are likely to persist for even longer. In similar vein, ECB President Draghi used the stage at Sintra to deliver a much more dovish/downbeat assessment of price developments and all but signalled another tweak to official guidance at the next policy meeting, if not further stimulus. In short, he acknowledged the recent pronounced drop in inflation expectations and said the GC will look at measures to counter the severity of risks to price severity in coming weeks, and if the situation fails to improve more stimulus will be needed. Eur/Usd has reversed from circa 1.1240 to just over 1.1180 and through 2.1 bn option expiries between 1.1195-1.1205 that may yet influence direction into the NY cut, while Eur/Gbp has pulled back sharply from around 0.8975 to 0.8925. Back down under, Aud/Usd is hovering off 0.6832 lows and Aud/Nzd has reversed towards 1.0500 as the Kiwi keeps tabs on the 0.6500 handle vs its US counterpart ahead of the latest GDT auction and NZ Q1 current account data.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF/GBP </strong>-<strong> </strong>All weaker vs the Greenback and partly in sympathy with the Euro and Aussie, but the Loonie also had more negative Chinese-Canadian headlines to digest as Beijing suspended pork imports pending closer inspection of the product. Meanwhile, the Franc slipped through parity, but strengthened in Eur/Chf cross terms to 1.1175 at one stage and will do doubt arouse SNB attention given that the ECB seems to be on the brink of easing further (-10 bp now priced in for December). Elsewhere, Cable is now eyeing 1.2500 and very early January lows after breaching key support at 1.2560, with the next leg of the Tory leadership race looming before UK CPI, retail sales and the BoE unfolds tomorrow and Thursday.</p><p><strong>JPY/NOK/SEK</strong> - The major outperformers, as the Yen regains a safe-haven bid to retest support ahead of 108.00, while the Scandi Crowns benefit from single currency weakness and ECB-Norges Bank/Riksbank policy divergence given a widely expected hike from the former on Thursday. Moreover, the Sek derived some traction from a cautiously upbeat Riksbank business survey and significantly improved 2019 budget surplus forecasts from the SNDO. Eur/Nok around 9.7780 vs 9.8170 at one stage and Eur/Sek holding within a 10.6484-6147 range.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Although the Buck has rebounded firmly, if not quite uniformly as noted above (back over 97.500), the Lira has maintained recovery momentum with the aid of some rare constructive comments on the US-Turkey front and reports that talks about the S-400 deal will be held at NATO next week. Usd/Try trading near the base of a 5.8225-8777 band.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong>, <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> have all rallied further to post fresh intraday peaks, at 172.52, 130.75 and 127-22+ respectively, with the former gleaning extra traction after breaching another chart resistance level at 172.42 along the way and also taking on board a rather worrying ZEW survey. Meanwhile, UK bonds have acknowledged a solid 10 year DMO sale and USTs are seeing more bull-flattening ahead of US housing data and FOMC day 1. Note, the corresponding cash yields are also crossing or approaching key lines, as Bunds edge below -30 bp, Gilts eye 80 bp and the 10 year Treasury inches towards 2%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are lower on the day with the former just above the USD 51.50/bbl level whilst the latter hovers around the USD 60.50/bbl mark. News-flow for the complex was largely surrounding OPEC this morning, with WSJ noting that Saudi intends to push for tighter compliance to OPEC production curbs. Sources also stated that the renewed pact would see the under-complying countries reducing crude supply by 300-400k BPD. In terms of a date, IFX reported that Moscow has reportedly agreed to consider an OPEC+ meeting on July 12th, postponed from the scheduled June 25/26. Looking ahead, traders will be keeping an eye on tonight API inventory release with the street looking for a draw of around 1.75mln barrels. Elsewhere, gold is hovering near intraday highs amid a bout of demand for the safe haven asset. Meanwhile, copper prices are supported despite the underlying risk off tone in the market as Glencore has shut down its Mufulira copper smelter at its Mopani copper mine in Zambia whilst Chile's Codelco said the Chuquicamata copper mine maintained output capacity at 50% due to the 4th full day of a union strike.</p><p>Chile's Codelco said the Chuquicamata copper mine maintained output capacity at 50% due to the 4th full day of a union strike.

The DAX (+0.8%) is now back above the 12k level after having visited a pre-Draghi low of 11,986, albeit gains are somewhat limited by a subdued IT sector, meanwhile, the FTSE 100 lags as the index fails to benefit from Draghi’s speech. In terms of sectors, financial names underperform amid the prolongation of negative rates. Defensive sectors are outperforming with healthcare and utilities the standout outperformers.&nbsp; Movers to the downside today include chipmakers following a profit warning from Siltronic (-13.8%) , citing US-China trade issues. The downbeat market outlook spilled onto STMicroelectronics (-2.3%), ASM (-1.0%) and Infineon (-5.0%), albeit the latter is more influenced by the launch of a capital increase to fund the Cypress Semiconductor acquisition. Finally, Lufthansa shares rest near the foot of the Stoxx 600 following three separate broker downgrades.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>EUR/AUD/NZD</strong> - The single currency has slumped to the bottom of the G10 pile and even below the Aussie that was hit overnight by RBA minutes flagging further easing on the basis that benign inflation and wage trends are likely to persist for even longer. In similar vein, ECB President Draghi used the stage at Sintra to deliver a much more dovish/downbeat assessment of price developments and all but signalled another tweak to official guidance at the next policy meeting, if not further stimulus. In short, he acknowledged the recent pronounced drop in inflation expectations and said the GC will look at measures to counter the severity of risks to price severity in coming weeks, and if the situation fails to improve more stimulus will be needed. Eur/Usd has reversed from circa 1.1240 to just over 1.1180 and through 2.1 bn option expiries between 1.1195-1.1205 that may yet influence direction into the NY cut, while Eur/Gbp has pulled back sharply from around 0.8975 to 0.8925. Back down under, Aud/Usd is hovering off 0.6832 lows and Aud/Nzd has reversed towards 1.0500 as the Kiwi keeps tabs on the 0.6500 handle vs its US counterpart ahead of the latest GDT auction and NZ Q1 current account data.</p><p><strong>CAD/CHF/GBP </strong>-<strong> </strong>All weaker vs the Greenback and partly in sympathy with the Euro and Aussie, but the Loonie also had more negative Chinese-Canadian headlines to digest as Beijing suspended pork imports pending closer inspection of the product. Meanwhile, the Franc slipped through parity, but strengthened in Eur/Chf cross terms to 1.1175 at one stage and will do doubt arouse SNB attention given that the ECB seems to be on the brink of easing further (-10 bp now priced in for December). Elsewhere, Cable is now eyeing 1.2500 and very early January lows after breaching key support at 1.2560, with the next leg of the Tory leadership race looming before UK CPI, retail sales and the BoE unfolds tomorrow and Thursday.</p><p><strong>JPY/NOK/SEK</strong> - The major outperformers, as the Yen regains a safe-haven bid to retest support ahead of 108.00, while the Scandi Crowns benefit from single currency weakness and ECB-Norges Bank/Riksbank policy divergence given a widely expected hike from the former on Thursday. Moreover, the Sek derived some traction from a cautiously upbeat Riksbank business survey and significantly improved 2019 budget surplus forecasts from the SNDO. Eur/Nok around 9.7780 vs 9.8170 at one stage and Eur/Sek holding within a 10.6484-6147 range.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Although the Buck has rebounded firmly, if not quite uniformly as noted above</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> - back over 97.500), the Lira has maintained recovery momentum with the aid of some rare constructive comments on the US-Turkey front and reports that talks about the S-400 deal will be held at NATO next week. Usd/Try trading near the base of a 5.8225-8777 band.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong>, <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> have all rallied further to post fresh intraday peaks, at 172.52, 130.75 and 127-22+ respectively, with the former gleaning extra traction after breaching another chart resistance level at 172.42 along the way and also taking on board a rather worrying ZEW survey. Meanwhile, UK bonds have acknowledged a solid 10 year DMO sale and USTs are seeing more bull-flattening ahead of US housing data and FOMC day 1. Note, the corresponding cash yields are also crossing or approaching key lines, as Bunds edge below -30 bp, Gilts eye 80 bp and the 10 year Treasury inches towards 2%.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are lower on the day with the former just above the USD 51.50/bbl level whilst the latter hovers around the USD 60.50/bbl mark. News-flow for the complex was largely surrounding OPEC this morning, with WSJ noting that Saudi intends to push for tighter compliance to OPEC production curbs. Sources also stated that the renewed pact would see the under-complying countries reducing crude supply by 300-400k BPD. In terms of a date, IFX reported that Moscow has reportedly agreed to consider an OPEC+ meeting on July 12th, postponed from the scheduled June 25/26. Looking ahead, traders will be keeping an eye on tonight API inventory release with the street looking for a draw of around 1.75mln barrels. Elsewhere, gold is hovering near intraday highs amid a bout of demand for the safe haven asset. Meanwhile, copper prices are supported despite the underlying risk off tone in the market as Glencore has shut down its Mufulira copper smelter at its Mopani copper mine in Zambia whilst Chile's Codelco said the Chuquicamata copper mine maintained output capacity at 50% due to the 4th full day of a union strike.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed as the region remains tentative ahead of this week’s key risk events and which follows the marginal performance on Wall St. where trade was otherwise uneventful aside from the gains in tech and telecoms. ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are mixed with Australia led higher by tech and commodity related sectors and with government plans to introduce a AUD 158bln income tax cut package as well as anticipation of further RBA policy easing adding to the optimism. Meanwhile, trade in Tokyo has been clouded by a firmer currency and with Tokai Carbon dragged on M&amp;A activity in which it will acquire Germany’s COBEX in a deal valued at JPY 100bln. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.9%) outperforms as business returns to normal following the recent protests and the Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) is indecisive despite continued PBoC liquidity efforts, as trade uncertainty lingers after economic regulators refused to rule out using rare earths in the trade dispute and with the Global Times Editor suggesting the potential for a protracted trade war.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY continued on from the prior day’s swings to slip back below the 97.50 level amid tentativeness heading into the key central bank meetings and as its major counterparts trade mixed with EUR/USD firmer after having broken above its 20- and 50-DMAs, while Morgan Stanley recently recommended long EUR/USD as its trade of the week. Conversely, GBP/USD printed fresh 6-month lows after reports that UK Chancellor Hammond is said to be prepared to resign over PM May's legacy spending plans and there were also reports Boris Johnson allies plan to rig the leadership contest by lending votes to Jeremy Hunt in an effort to avoid a run-off against Michael Gove. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are subdued as a lack of risk appetite in Japan spurs flows into the safe haven JPY and with the downside also triggered by declines in antipodean-related crosses after the RBA Minutes stated the board agreed more likely than not further policy easing would be appropriate and factors limiting inflation as well as wage growth are likely to remain for some time.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are steady despite the cautiousness in the region with participants sidelined ahead of a 5yr auction later.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>At the meeting, the RBA cut the Cash Rate Target to 1.25% which was unanimously expected as ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures had priced in a 100% probability for rates to be cut. The RBA stated that it took the decision to lower rates to support employment growth and provide greater confidence inflation will be consistent with medium-term targets.</p><p>The RBA noted the main domestic uncertainty continues to be household consumption but added that some pick-up in growth in household income is expected and should support consumption growth. In terms of forecasts, its central scenario is for economy to grow 2.75% this year and next, while underlying inflation is seen at 1.75% this year and 2.00% next year.</p><p>The initial reaction in AUD/USD to the rate announcement was to the upside despite the RBA cutting rates for the 1st time in nearly 3 years, as the market was heavily one-sided going into the decision and as the statement didn’t provide anything that suggested urgency by the central bank to cut again as soon as August which many forecasters anticipate. However, RBA Governor Lowe commented a few hours after the rate decision in which he stated it is not unreasonable to expect a lower cash rate from here and that the economic forecast has assumed rates at 1% by year-end.</p>",
