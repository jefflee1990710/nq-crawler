(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Initially, the tone was highly risk off with equities lower and Treasuries higher after the PBoC weakened the yuan fix with this week highlighting how crucial the central bank’s FX policy is to overall market sentiment. However, US equity futures fought back and moved into positive territory in late trade before cash markets eventually closed mixed. In terms of specific stocks, Disney (DIS) disappointed with their results as its EPS heavily missed expectations, revenues fell short also, as did its cable and media revenues. Disney put the poor report down to its “Dark Phoenix” weighing on its box office haul among the integration of USD 70bln worth of 21st Century Fox assets. Disney (DIS) also weighed on Netflix (NFLX) as it forecasts Q4 streaming revenue losses to increase to USD 900mln. CVS (CVS) reported a healthy earnings report beating both top and bottom-line numbers as well as boosting FY EPS guidance above market expectations. Microchip (MCHP) were higher after beating on EPS, and Match (MTCH) soared almost 30% higher as it provided stronger guidance as well as its Tinder users averaging 5.2mln in Q2, a 1.5mln increase y/y. Gold miners, Newmont Goldcorp (NEM) and Barrick Gold (GOLD) were higher as gold surged to 6-year highs breaching USD 1500/oz which also led to materials being one of the outperforming sectors. FedEx (FDX) were lower as it officially announced the end of its ground-delivery deal with Amazon (AMZN), in 2018 AMZN accounted for 1.3% of total FDX revenues. Financials were the worst performing sector today as yields fell as markets took a heavy risk on tone in the earlier part of the session. Higher on earnings: Assurant (AIZ), Fleetcor Technologies (FLT) &amp; Wendy’s (WEN). Lower on earnings: CenterPoint Energy (CNP), Devon Energy (DVN), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Host Hotels (HST) &amp; Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA). In broker moves, Dunkin Donuts (DNKN), Mosaic (MOS) &amp; EA were upgraded and in downgrades; Allergan (AGN), Henry Schein (HSIC) &amp; Xencor (XNCR). SPX +0.1% at 2,884, DJIA -0.1% at 26,007, NDX +0.4% at 7,552.</p><p>Yields were lower across the curve, but major curve spreads were mixed, though hadn’t deviated by more than 2bps on the session. There was far more attention on the 3m/10-year spread, which inverted to over 40bps as global yields sank, taking the spread to the most inverted since 2007. Inspiring today’s price action was risk-off flows, as China fixed the yuan weaker, and RBNZ and RBI cut rates by more than expected, with the former citing the impact of global trade on its economy, and suggesting that NIRP could be an option ahead. Fed pricing on Wednesday was relatively unchanged looking through to the end of next year, where around 109bps of easing is priced. Fed’s Evans (dove, voter) hinted at more accommodation ahead, like his dovish colleague Bullard did early in the week, but was pushing a data-dependent line with regards to the September meeting – the implication is that all FOMC participants that have spoken this week have not explicitly alluded to a rate cut on 18th September, although they have not leaned back against market pricing, which is pricing 35bps of easing, suggesting that the market is still pricing a small chance of a double-barrel rate cut. Back to the Treasury complex, yields have pared back more than half of their fall, and it seems the driving factor was the aforementioned 3m/10-year spread coming off lows. US T-note futures (U9) settled 12+ ticks higher at 130-05.</p>",

DOE reports surprise crude build; German IP weak; Saudis considering all options to stop stabilise oil.</strong></li><li><strong>COMING UP: RBA Lowe semi-annual testimony (Friday in Europe); US 30-year bond auction; China CPI (Friday in Europe), Japan GDP (Friday in Europe).</strong></li></ul><p><strong>* MARKETS WRAP:&nbsp;</strong>Initially the tone was highly risk off, with equities lower, and Treasuries higher.Overnight, the PBOC weakened the yuan fix; this week’s episodes have again highlighted how crucial the central bank’s FX policy is to overall market sentiment, and there are now more suggestions that the yuan may be used as a trade weapon. We also had dovish central bank decisions, where the RBNZ and RBI cut deeper than expected, while the BoT also cut rates. Bond yields declined overnight, and that sentiment carried through to Europe/North America trade, with fixed income rallying hard. The US 3-month/10-year spread inverted to over 40bps, the deepest inversion since 2007, and giving rise to further fears of recession, given that the indicator has had accurate predictive power in the past. Havens were generally bid, with gold topping USD 1500 for the first time in six years; the Yen and Swissy also gained. In afternoon trade, US equity futures fought back, moving into positive territory in late trade, with cash markets eventually closing flat/higher. Some downside was reintroduced when trade headlines suggested that China is expecting the 10% tariffs on 300bln of imports of Chinese goods to be raised to 25%, in a sign that both the US and China are getting ready for a protracted battle. However, the moves were shrugged off and the initial headline related losses were reversed.</p><p><strong>* CHINA:&nbsp;</strong>US President Trump claimed that he anticipated the market reaction to ramping up trade tensions with China would be negative, but said that markets will 'go higher', and that 'someone had to do this to China.' There were also suggestions from the China's SCMP newspaper that a video conference was reportedly been planned to lay the groundwork for next round of US-China face to face talks in September, according to sources briefed by the US government; one former Chinese policymaker said this may help ease tensions, however, the ubiquitous Global Times Editor today said Washington’s repeated bullying has made it meaningless to continue trade talks in the short-run, adding that China and US are caught in a stalemate worse than the last round. The GT editor also said that China was mobilising internally to fight firmly with the US, and all official media is participating in the mobilisation. Meanwhile, data on Wednesday showed China foreign FX reserves declining in July to USD 3.104tln (exp. 3.105tln vs prev. 3.119tln), while its gold reserves grew to USD 88.876bln from 87.268bln. Capital Economics said the data is consistent with the PBOC having remained on the side-lines of the FX market last month, but says that the relative calm of July will give way to a more eventful August. China's FX regulator itself said that the country's improving momentum and resilient real economy will support the stabilisation of FX reserves, and the fall in July reserves was due to changes in FX rates and asset prices. In later trade, Fox News, citing China trade sources, reported that China expects that the 10% tariffs will be implemented on September 1st, and also expect the tariffs to rise to 25% due to China \"standing firm\" and not purchasing US agricultural products, according to Fox News.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed’s Evans (voter, dove)</strong>&nbsp;argued that based on inflation, the July rate cut was needed, and more accommodation will be required. Evans said that headwinds meant cutting rates further could be reasonable; Evans says that the rate cut is still ‘mid-cycle adjustment’, and said the Fed is now aiming for a rate of 50bps below neutral rather than 50bps above neutral (he estimated the longer-run neutral rate might be around 2.75%, but could be lower due to the headwinds). Evans said he’d be watching incoming US data as well as business commentary to determine whether more easing is required. Elsewhere,&nbsp;<strong>Trump</strong>&nbsp;reiterated familiar criticism of Fed policy, once again calling for the central bank to loosen policy.</p><p><strong>* RBNZ:</strong>&nbsp;The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its OCR by 50bps to a record low 1.00%, deeper than the 25bps cut analysts had forecast. The Central Bank said lower rates were required for the Central Bank to meet its employment and inflation mandates while global economic activity continues to weaken, and said that the size of the cut shows the central bank’s commitment to achieving its goals; the forecasts also show there is a chance of further rate cuts – in fact, Governor Orr suggested that the RBNZ may have to use negative rates at some point, and perhaps even other non-standard measures, but added that the double-barrel cut reduces the risk of using negative rates. Analysts observed that this was the second occasion where the RBNZ brought forward its easing plans – May’s 25bps rate cut was sooner than the staff forecasts had envisaged; and rates are now at a level which the forecasts saw in the first half of next year. UBS said that while the staff OCR path in the August monetary policy statement leaves the door open to only modest further easing, the central bank has demonstrated that it is more dovish and more aggressive than the staff. UBS thinks that if the backdrop continues to weaken, the behaviour of the RBNZ board suggests it will ease early, and by more than the market expects. Meanwhile, Westpac sees the CB holding off in September (amid a lack of signals to suggest further imminent cuts) followed by a 25bps cut in November, citing a similar view to UBS.</p><p><strong>* RBI:</strong>&nbsp;The Reserve Bank of India cut rates by an unprecedented 35bps (vs. Exp. 25bps), with its main Repo Rate now at 5.40%, marking the fourth rate cut of 2019 and bringing the rate cuts cumulatively to 110bps in four meetings. The decision to lower rates was unanimous but 2 members (out of 6) opted for a 25bps reduction. The RBI also maintained an accommodative stance, as widely touted. The move was justified due to decelerating GDP in Q1 and subdued inflation pressures, thus its 2019/20 GDP growth forecast was marginally revised lower to 6.9% from a prior 7.0%, adding that growth concerns assume the highest priority as inflation is within target. At the presser, Governor Das highlighted that the RBI has been pre-emptive in policy action/stance and the Board took a balanced view that a 50bps reduction would have been excessive. Looking ahead, money markets see further easing on the horizon, with OIS implying another 25bps cut in the next six months. Analysts at CapEco anticipate another 25bps at the RBI’s next meeting in October, citing the Central Bank’s emphasis on looser policy amid an unchanged stance, although risks are skewed for even more policy easing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* BOK:</strong>&nbsp;South Korea’s central bank governor held an emergency press conference with the finance minister, where it was said that authorities are prepared for all-out preventative efforts to stabilise the KRW and financial markets amid escalating global trade tensions.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN IP:&nbsp;</strong> Q2 GDP is under threat after German industrial production fell 1.5% M/M in June, taking the Y/Y rate to -5.2%. The data will overshadow hopes of a rebound, after decent industrial orders reported on Tuesday. Business surveys also have been pointing to deterioration in July, and analysts have been saying that the H2 2019 appears it will still be challenging for Germany's manufacturing/industrial sector.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U9) SETTLES USD 2.54 LOWER AT USD 51.09/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLES USD 2.71 LOWER AT USD 56.23/BBL: </strong>The crude complex is again grabbing attention, where another day of large price declines is emphasizing bearish sentiment. Prices trundled lower through the European session, and then accelerated to the downside as US traders arrived, amid souring risk sentiment. To hit the nail in the coffin, the EIA reported a surprise build in US crude stocks (+2.4mln bbls, exp. -2.8mln, at odds with the -3.4mln draw reported by the API on Tuesday), in addition to a ramp up of US production by 100k to 12.3mln bpd, swiftly inducing a leg lower in the crude benchmarks. The EIA also reported bearish surprises in the products, gasoline and distillates both built by 4.4mln bbls and 1.5mln bbls respectively. On a bullish note, and provided that fundamentals don’t materially weaken, analysts at Citigroup say that the lower prices go, the more downside risks are priced out and upside potential is raised, “the lower it goes the more bullish we’ll become.” However, on a technical basis, SEB highlights that we have fallen below the USD 59.74/bbl Fibonacci level in Brent, a level which it believes is the last significant support level before the USD 50/bbl handle. Price action going forward is likely to continue to be strongly influenced by global demand themes, which are likely to remain volatile amid the ongoing trade disputes and growth outlook concerns, SEB analysts said. After settlement, a Saudi official reportedly said it is considering 'all options' to stop the oil price fall and they are in talks with producers to stem the slides in oil prices.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.1% at 2,884, DJIA -0.1% at 26,007, NDX +0.4% at 7,552; </strong>SECTORS: consumer discretionary +0.3%, consumer staples +1.2%, energy -0.8%, financials -1.2%, health care +0.0%, industrials -0.1%, information technology +0.6%, materials +1.3%, telecoms -0.4%, utilities +0.2%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Stock Specifics: Disney (DIS) disappointed with their results as its EPS heavily missed expectations, revenues fell short also, as did its cable and media revenues. Disney put the poor report down to its “Dark Phoenix” weighing on its box office haul among the integration of USD 70bln worth of 21st Century Fox assets. Disney (DIS) also weighed on Netflix (NFLX) as it forecasts Q4 streaming revenue losses to increase to USD 900mln. CVS (CVS) reported a healthy earnings report beating both top and bottom-line numbers as well as boosting FY EPS guidance above market expectations. Microchip (MCHP) were higher after beating on EPS, and Match (MTCH) soared almost 30% higher as it provided stronger guidance as well as its Tinder users averaging 5.2mln in Q2, a 1.5mln increase y/y. Gold miners, Newmont Goldcorp (NEM) and Barrick Gold (GOLD) were higher as gold surged to 6-year highs breaching USD 1500/oz which also led to materials being one of the outperforming sectors. FedEx (FDX) were lower as it officially announced the end of its ground-delivery deal with Amazon (AMZN), in 2018 AMZN accounted for 1.3% of total FDX revenues. Financials were the worst performing sector today as yields fell as markets took a heavy risk on tone in the earlier part of the session. Higher on earnings: Assurant (AIZ), Fleetcor Technologies (FLT) &amp; Wendy’s (WEN). Lower on earnings: CenterPoint Energy (CNP), Devon Energy (DVN), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Host Hotels (HST) &amp; Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA). In broker moves, Dunkin Donuts (DNKN), Mosaic (MOS) &amp; EA were upgraded and in downgrades; Allergan (AGN), Henry Schein (HSIC) &amp; Xencor (XNCR).</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLES 12+ TICKS HIGHER AT 130-05. </strong>Yields were lower across the curve, but major curve spreads were mixed, though hadn’t deviated by more than 2bps on the session. There was far more attention on the 3m/10-year spread, which inverted to over 40bps as global yields sank, taking the spread to the most inverted since 2007. Inspiring today’s price action was risk-off flows, as China fixed the yuan weaker, and RBNZ and RBI cut rates by more than expected, with the former citing the impact of global trade on its economy, and suggesting that NIRP could be an option ahead. Fed pricing on Wednesday was relatively unchanged looking through to the end of next year, where around 109bps of easing is priced. Fed’s Evans (dove, voter) hinted at more accommodation ahead, like his dovish colleague Bullard did early in the week, but was pushing a data-dependent line with regards to the September meeting – the implication is that all FOMC participants that have spoken this week have not explicitly alluded to a rate cut on 18th September, although they have not leaned back against market pricing, which is pricing 35bps of easing, suggesting that the market is still pricing a small chance of a double-barrel rate cut. Back to the Treasury complex, yields have pared back more than half of their fall, and it seems the driving factor was the aforementioned 3m/10-year spread coming off lows.</p><p><strong>* 10-YEAR AUCTION: </strong>The US sold 10-year paper in a dismal auction which tailed by a whopping 1.5bps. The paper sold at 1.67%, the lowest since August 2016; cover was soft and beneath recent averages at 2.2x, and the participation was also grim, with dealers taking 30.7% (against a six auction average of 25.3%), directs taking 13.6% vs an average of 11.9, and indirects taking 55.7% vs an average of 62.8%.</p><p><strong>* 30-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> June’s auction was soft, seeing very soft demand, and cover falling to the lowest levels since November. Writing before the slide in yields on Tuesday, SocGen suggested that the 30-year sector was rich on asset swap versus previous auction cycles. However, on the 5s30s curve, which has steepened of late, SocGen says, though still appears cheap. SocGen says it is neutral on the auction.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Risk-off trade saw havens in demand, with the USDJPY falling to lows near 105.50, USDCHF having a 0.96 handle briefly, and gold rising to 6-year highs above USD 1500 amid the Treasury rally (and general core fixed income rally). As the US 3m/10yr spread came off lows, and markets stabilised, there was some paring of these moves, though gold remains above the level, yen is back over 106.00 heading into Asia. As was seen earlier in the week, the EUR trades firmer, likely on the weaker USDCNY fixing overnight (CNY is the largest component in the ECB’s trade weighted basket), and certainly not from the dismal German industrial production data, while DXY is slightly negative around 97.53, having been as low as 97.31 in earlier trade. The Antipodes were mixed, with NZD getting slammed after a more dovish than expected RBNZ, which saw AUDNZD surge, adding to AUD strength; The AUD did fall in sympathy overnight, but has retaken 0.67 in US trade; Bullock and Friday’s SOMP are in focus.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong>&nbsp;Analysts have been revising down their CNY 2020 price targets, with yuan forecasts being pushed down, with some seeing risks of USDCNY 7.50 in 2020. Many have pointed out the impact of the yuan on other major FX – SocGen, which has heavily covered the theme, says that all being equal, a weaker yuan and a stronger EUR also translates into lower forecasts for 10-year bund yields, with some desks now seeing as low as -80bps by the end of the year.</p><p><strong>* NZD</strong>&nbsp;was sharply lower after the RBNZ cut rates deeper than analysts had foreseen, and the tone of communications was aggressively dovish; the&nbsp;<strong>AUD</strong>&nbsp;fell in sympathy with its Antipodean counterpart, giving up the 0.67 level.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the margin, the weaker yuan fix may also have added some pressure on both currencies.</p><p><strong>* INR:&nbsp;</strong>The Indian rupee was relatively stable in early trade, despite a larger than expected cut by the RBI. Desks explain that the sharp drop in Brent prices in recent trade has been supporting the currency.</p><p><strong>* EUR:&nbsp;</strong>Consolidating around 1.12; the closing of carry trades and short-covering are said to have been supporting the EUR.

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Risk-off trade saw havens in demand, with the USDJPY falling to lows near 105.50, USDCHF having a 0.96 handle briefly, and gold rising to 6-year highs above USD 1500 amid the Treasury rally (and general core fixed income rally). As the US 3m/10yr spread came off lows, and markets stabilised, there was some paring of these moves, though gold remains above the level, yen is back over 106.00 heading into Asia. As was seen earlier in the week, the EUR trades firmer, likely on the weaker USDCNY fixing overnight (CNY is the largest component in the ECB’s trade weighted basket), and certainly not from the dismal German industrial production data, while DXY is slightly negative around 97.53, having been as low as 97.31 in earlier trade. The Antipodes were mixed, with NZD getting slammed after a more dovish than expected RBNZ, which saw AUDNZD surge, adding to AUD strength; The AUD did fall in sympathy overnight, but has retaken 0.67 in US trade; Bullock and Friday’s SOMP are in focus.</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong>&nbsp;Analysts have been revising down their CNY 2020 price targets, with yuan forecasts being pushed down, with some seeing risks of USDCNY 7.50 in 2020. Many have pointed out the impact of the yuan on other major FX – SocGen, which has heavily covered the theme, says that all being equal, a weaker yuan and a stronger EUR also translates into lower forecasts for 10-year bund yields, with some desks now seeing as low as -80bps by the end of the year.</p><p><strong>* NZD</strong>&nbsp;was sharply lower after the RBNZ cut rates deeper than analysts had foreseen, and the tone of communications was aggressively dovish; the&nbsp;<strong>AUD</strong>&nbsp;fell in sympathy with its Antipodean counterpart, giving up the 0.67 level.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the margin, the weaker yuan fix may also have added some pressure on both currencies.</p><p><strong>* INR:&nbsp;</strong>The Indian rupee was relatively stable in early trade, despite a larger than expected cut by the RBI. Desks explain that the sharp drop in Brent prices in recent trade has been supporting the currency.</p><p><strong>* EUR:&nbsp;</strong>Still consolidating around 1.12; the closing of carry trades and short-covering are said to have been supporting the EUR. There could be support from the risk environment, however, Morgan Stanley says. The bank argues that funders like the EUR, CHF and JPY will stay in demand.</p><p><strong>* CARRY FX:&nbsp;</strong>Despite the stabilisation seen after the risk slide at the beginning of the week, desks still suggest that the carry trade will only be restored once market confidence returns, which is likely hinging on the outcome of US/China talks. As things stand, the US is set to ramp up tariffs on China at the start of next month, and SocGen’s FX strategists suggest that this need to be averted in order for confidence to return.</p>",

Prices trundled lower through the European session, and then accelerated to the downside as US traders arrived, amid souring risk sentiment. To hit the nail in the coffin, the EIA reported a surprise build in US crude stocks (+2.4mln bbls, exp. -2.8mln, at odds with the -3.4mln draw reported by the API on Tuesday), in addition to a ramp up of US production by 100k to 12.3mln bpd, swiftly inducing a leg lower in the crude benchmarks. The EIA also reported bearish surprises in the products, gasoline and distillates both built by 4.4mln bbls and 1.5mln bbls respectively. On a bullish note, and provided that fundamentals don’t materially weaken, analysts at Citigroup say that the lower prices go, the more downside risks are priced out and upside potential is raised, “the lower it goes the more bullish we’ll become.” However, on a technical basis, SEB highlights that we have fallen below the USD 59.74/bbl Fibonacci level in Brent, a level which it believes is the last significant support level before the USD 50/bbl handle. Price action going forward is likely to continue to be strongly influenced by global demand themes, which are likely to remain volatile amid the ongoing trade disputes and growth outlook concerns, SEB analysts said.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong> The US will this week sell a new 3-year note (USD 38bln, Tuesday), a new10-year note (USD 27bln, Wednesday), and a new 30-year bond (USD 19bln, Thursday); with USD 57.3bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, the supply will raise a net USD 26.7bln in new cash. TD Securities says that with the Fed halting balance sheet runoff at its July meeting, it will now reinvest all maturing Treasuries as add-ons at auction. TD says that with USD 54.8bln in SOMA holdings maturing at month-end, the Fed will add on USD 24.8bln to 3s, USD 17.6bln to 10s, and USD 12.4bln to 30s.</p><p><strong>10-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>SocGen's analysts are positive on the 10-year auction. The Bank notes that the 10-year sector does not have clear set-up from a relative-value perspective, saying it is trading cheap in asset swap, whereas it trades fair/slightly rich on the curve versus the 5s and 30s wings. SocGen says that, \"although the 10-year sector appears rich on the 2s10s curve because of the flattening that it has undergone since the July FOMC meeting, current political and economic qualms are likely to put a cap on 10-year yields unless there is appeasement on the trade and currency front.\" Likewise, it says that the current 10-year note is trading special in repo, which could be a positive for the auction, as is supportive demand from dealers due to their relatively low holdings in the 7-11 year sector. \"However, with the current WI yield well below all auction stops since September 2016, the auction will likely need a concession to go well.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Meanwhile, a trio of global Central Banks cut rates, 2 more than anticipated and the other against consensus for unchanged in an effort to get ahead of the curve given heightened downside growth threats and lowflation putting individual policy goals further beyond reach. The Yen traded closer to safe-haven highs seen when the Yuans first fell through the previously key 7.0000 level around 105.50 vs the Dollar, while Gold breached Usd1500/oz, the Franc rebounded from near 0.9800 to retest resistance ahead of 0.9700 and the Euro staged a more convincing bounce above 1.1200.</p><p><strong>NZD/NOK/SEK/CAD/AUD/GBP</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to the above, the Kiwi has been hit hard after the RBNZ cut the OCR to a fresh record low of 1% vs 1.25% expected from 1.5% and Governor Orr signalled further easing to sub-zero if necessary. However, Nzd/Usd has pared more losses from a circa 0.6380 low towards 0.6450, albeit as the <strong>DXY </strong>wobbles again amidst losses elsewhere (index extending session lows to 97.332 and through key Fib support at 97.392 that failed to hold on Tuesday). Elsewhere, the Scandi Crowns are both back on the rack on the broad deterioration in investor morale and with the Nok also feeling the weight of sharply lower oil prices – down through 10.0950 against the single currency and Eur/Sek above 10.8000 at one stage. Meanwhile, mixed Canadian Ivey PMIs have hardly impacted the Loonie that is also being undermined by the crude collapse and struggling to recover within a 1.3345-1.3270 range. The Aussie continues track its Antipodean counterpart to an extent on the premise that the RBA may be tempted if not compelled into a 3rd OCR ease given RBNZ aggression, with Aud/Usd hovering around the upper echelons of 0.6782-0.6678 parameters. The Pound remains relatively rangebound and still conscious of an October 31 hard UK departure from the EU, as Cable meanders between 1.2100-1.2200 and Eur/Gbp flits from 0.9250-0.9150.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Inr and Thb also had policy meetings to contend with and surprise decisions to contend with as the RBI moved -35 bp vs -25 bp consensus and BoT went down ¼ point against forecasts for no change, but the Rupee has firmed up on the basis that the Indian Central Bank may now pause for a while to assess cumulative easing of 110 bp, while the Baht is softer. However, the Try has extended its recovery and looks ripe for further gains given a chart support break and trade through 5.5000 amidst reports of positive Turkish-US developments on the subject of a Syrian safe-zone.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>Lacking a fresh downside catalyst or specific bearish impulse, the crude complex is still trundling lower on Wednesday, and with a seemingly bullish API report providing little relief. To recap, the API reported a 3.4mln bbl draw in US crude stocks (exp. 2.8mln), which if confirmed by the EIA later today would mark two months of draws. Elsewhere in the report, gasoline drew 1.1mln bbls (exp. -0.7mln) and distillates built 1.2mln bbls (exp. +0.5mln); while Cushing reported a 1.6mln bbl draw, which was less than the Genscape forecast of -2.4mln. Participants will now be looking for confirmation in the official EIA release coming up.</li><li>A note from SEB leads with the title “Brent crude tipping over the technical abyss”, a reflection of the current state of play as participants struggle to find a floor. The analyst noted Brent closing at USD 58.94/bbl on Tuesday, the lowest since January and below the 59.74 Fibonacci level, the last technical level of support before 50; given the magnitude of recent moves, it is plausible that the ever-growing global demand, and trade concerns, in absence of upside factors could well see Brent pushed closer to USD 50/bbl.</li><li>Breaking down the EIA monthly report on Tuesday, it again decreased its 2019 global oil demand growth, this time by 70k bpd to a 1.0mln bpd YY increase, whilst it did raise its 2020 forecast by 30k bpd to a 1.43mln bpd YY increase. The EIA expects Brent and WTI prices to increase to USD 65/bbl and USD 59.50/bbl in Q4, and to remain there throughout 2020, which it says reflects “that upside and downside price risks and EIA’s forecast for global oil inventory growth are currently balanced”, but caveat that if supply or demand concerns materialise, a breakout could ensue. The EIA also raised its Q4 and 2019 WTI/Brent Arb forecast to -5.50 (prev. -4.00), which it attributed to a re-evaluation of the marginal cost of transporting crude from the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub to the Gulf Coast; although the EIA still believes that Arb is supported from the de-bottlenecking of supply out of the Permian Basin as more pipelines come online.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

There are trade uncertainties. Obviously the administration is pursuing a different trade strategy where there’s aggressive use of tariffs, brinksmanship, trying to get other countries to alter their policies, and we’ll just have to see how it works.</li><li><strong>On the policy outlook: </strong>Evans says he looks at the forecast that he was asked to submit in June. And in order to get inflation up to 2.25% over the next three years, he needed 50-basis points of more accommodation; and, in fact, maybe that’s not quite enough. he thinks on the basis of inflation alone, he could feel confident in arguing for a couple of rate cuts before the end of the year.</li><li><strong>On inflation and inflation expectations: </strong>Evans says Fed has been under 2% for a long time, so he was worried about it. And then with the most recent nervousness, he would just say he thinks that a little more accommodation would be helpful for ensuring that the Fed confidently get to 2 and above 2%. He really think that 2.25%, or a little bit more than that, would be about appropriate for US economy and monetary policy. Evans said we haven’t cracked 2% on a sustained basis since the Great Recession; and if you don’t do that, he worries a lot. Evans said he does not want anybody to think that we’re in a position like the Bank of Japan where they got really nervous about all of this.</li></ul><p>Comments made on 16th July.&nbsp;</p><p>Source: Goldman Sachs/RANsquawk</p>",

The transaction also includes the minority shareholder Lanxess (+4.7%) who is poised to sell its 40% share for around EUR 700mln. Sector wise, healthcare names are lagging with the sector pressured by Novartis (-0.2%) after the US FDA stated that some data from early testing of its Zolgensma treatment was manipulated. Novartis opened lower by 2% before trimming losses. Other individual movers include UniCredit&nbsp; (-4.0%), Commerzbank (-4.7%) and ABN AMRO (-3.2%) post-earnings, in which the former cut its FY 19 revenue forecast and the latter stated it sees a bleaker margin ahead.</p><p><strong>Softbank (9984 JT)</strong> reports Q1 net profit +257.6% Y/Y to JPY 1.12tln.

In fact, NIRP is not out of the realms of possibility as the Bank strives to hit its dual inflation and jobs target. Nzd/Usd slumped to lows around 0.6379 at one stage, but has subsequently reclaimed 0.6400+ status with key Fib support (0.6367) holding for now, while Aud/Nzd has rebounded further from sub-1.0300 levels to almost 1.0500 as Aud/Usd contains knock-on losses to circa 0.6678 even though RBA easing probability for September has risen in response to the more aggressive/pre-emptive RBNZ action. On that note, remarks from RBA’s Bullock later today may be pertinent. Conversely, the Rupee has strengthened in wake of an above consensus 35 bp reduction in benchmark rates from the RBI, and perhaps the vote split with 2 dissents for -25 bp plus the fact that the Bank has already administered 75 bp worth easing via 3 successive moves is being deemed as enough for now, even though the bias remains accommodative. Usd/Inr now circa 70.8000 within 71.000-70.5910 parameters in contrast to Usd/Thb nearer the top of a 30.9200-6900 range after a surprise ¼ point BoT rate cut and pledge to use other measures to curb Baht strength.</p><p><strong>JPY -</strong> Bucking broader trends again, and back on a firmer footing against the Dollar, as US Treasury yields retreat sharply from Tuesday’s fleeting retracement highs and the PBoC nudged the official Usd/CNY nearer 7.0000 to rekindle US-China trade concerns that seemed to abate a tad yesterday. Usd/Jpy is slipping back from just shy of 106.50 as the DXY continues to pivot 97.500 by virtue of greater gains vs riskier currency counterparts more than anything else as GOLD looks poised to breach Usd1500/oz amidst the escalation of trade wars and transition to conflicts of FX interests.</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP/EUR/CAD -</strong> All weaker vs the Greenback, or handing back recent gains, with the Franc approaching 0.9800 vs nearly 0.9700 and underlying safe-haven demand offset by prospects of SNB intervention at any time if the Chf appreciates too much. Indeed, Eur/Chf has also bounced further from recent lows between 1.0925-50 confines even though Eur/Usd remains top heavy on the 1.1200 handle amidst increasingly soft/negative Eurozone bond yields. Elsewhere, Cable is also struggling to maintain recovery momentum through 1.2200 and 0.9200 in Eur/Gbp cross terms amidst ongoing Brexit no deal/UK political risk, while the Loonie is straddling 1.3300 ahead of Canadian Ivey PMI prints.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> Notwithstanding the wider swings in risk sentiment and specific factors impacting individual currencies and assets, the Lira revival continues, and the latest reversal in Usd/Try looks rather technical as key support ahead of 5.5000 has now given way.</p><p><strong>RBNZ cut the Official Cash Rate by 50bps to 1.00% which was deeper than the Exp. 25bps cut</strong>. RBNZ said the OCR cut was necessary to support employment and inflation policy remit, while it added the cut demonstrates commitment to meeting the inflation target and that the committee agreed larger initial stimulus would best ensure reaching inflation and employment objectives. Members also noted that estimates of neutral level of rates have continued to fall and that balance of risks to reaching their objectives are tilted to the downside. Furthermore, <strong>RBNZ Governor Orr said at the press conference that today's action does not rule out any future action and that it is easily within the realms of possibility we may have to use negative interest rates</strong> but added that today's cut reduces the risk of using negative rates. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Indian Repo Rate N/A 5.40% vs. Exp. 5.5% (Prev. 5.75%); Reverse Repo Rate N/A 5.15% vs. Exp. 5.25% (Prev. 5.5%);</strong> Cash Reserve Ratio* N/A 4.00% vs. Exp. 4.0% (Prev. 4.0%).</p><p>- Bank maintains its accommodative monetary policy stance, <strong>All members voted unanimously to cut rates and keep stance unchanged; 4 members voted for a 35bps cut while 2 voted for a 25bps cut.</strong></p><p>- Revised 2019/20 GDP growth to 6.9% vs. Prev. 7.0%. Headline inflation expected at 3.1% in Q2 FY20; 3.5-3.7% in H2 FY20; adding that inflation is expected to remain within target over a 12-month timeline</p><p>- Impact of monetary policy easing since February is anticipated to support economic activity ahead</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Fixed continues to drive higher this morning, with <strong>Bunds and Gilts</strong> making more headway (highs of 177.44 and 134.77 respectively) in catch-up trade after the late Tuesday squeeze in <strong>US Treasuries</strong> that continued overnight. Note, even a somewhat disappointing German 5 year placement was largely disregarded or only briefly acknowledged, as the global bond rally rumbles on after a pause and bout of consolidation yesterday. To recap, debt bulls have been driven by the global narrative (trade/currency wars) and fuelled further by surprise cuts in terms of magnitude from both the RBNZ and RBI today, while the BoT defied steady expectations and eased 25 bp as well. Returning to the German 10yr, which has surpassed one of the aforementioned technical levels, leaving just 177.50 and the -60 bp yield untouched, for now at least. Looking ahead the US data slate is uninspiring, though comments from Fed’s Evans at 14:30 BST will be closely watched for any September FOMC clues, particularly in light of the deteriorating US-China relations. Supply may also be pivotal given the 2nd of this week's Treasury auctions in the form of Usd27 bln 10s and the cash equivalent close to fresh 1.65% lows.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>A day of respite thus far for the energy market following this month’s losses of almost 10%, pressured by the global oil demand outlook as the US-China saga intensifies. Yesterday saw the first of the monthly oil reports, the EIA STEO cut its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast by 70k BPD to a 1.0mln BPD Y/Y increase, albeit its 2020 forecast was raised slightly by 30k BPD. Investors will be keeping an eye on the IEA (Aug 6) and OPEC (Aug 16) Monthly reports for some harmony on the short-term global oil demand outlook. On the supply side, the weekly API crude stocks data showed a larger-than-forecast draw (-3.4mln vs. Exp. -2.8mln), the release did little to sway prices but may have underpinned the benchmarks in anticipation for today’s DoE data to confirm the drawdown (headline crude Exp. -2.845mln). Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> is inching closer to the key 1500/oz level with futures having already topped the level amid safe-haven inflows as US/China developments, global growth outlook and easing by global Central Banks. <strong>Spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> printed a fresh 6yr peak at 1491/oz during early EU trade. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices have rebounded off worst levels, albeit remain contained near 2yr lows with some support derived from news that Glencore is planning to shut its Mutanda cobalt and copper mine (which produced almost 200k tonnes of copper last year) by the end of 2019 due to lower cobalt prices impacting the economic viability of the project. Finally, Dalian <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> prices extended its slide for a fifth session amid rising supply and weakening demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

On that note, remarks from RBA’s Bullock later today may be pertinent. Conversely, the Rupee has strengthened in wake of an above consensus 35 bp reduction in benchmark rates from the RBI, and perhaps the vote split with 2 dissents for -25 bp plus the fact that the Bank has already administered 75 bp worth easing via 3 successive moves is being deemed as enough for now, even though the bias remains accommodative. Usd/Inr now circa 70.8000 within 71.000-70.5910 parameters in contrast to Usd/Thb nearer the top of a 30.9200-6900 range after a surprise ¼ point BoT rate cut and pledge to use other measures to curb Baht strength.</p><p>JPY - Bucking broader trends again, and back on a firmer footing against the Dollar, as US Treasury yields retreat sharply from Tuesday’s fleeting retracement highs and the PBoC nudged the official Usd/CNY nearer 7.0000 to rekindle US-China trade concerns that seemed to abate a tad yesterday. Usd/Jpy is slipping back from just shy of 106.50 as the DXY continues to pivot 97.500 by virtue of greater gains vs riskier currency counterparts more than anything else as GOLD looks poised to breach Usd1500/oz amidst the escalation of trade wars and transition to conflicts of FX interests.</p><p>CHF/GBP/EUR/CAD - All weaker vs the Greenback, or handing back recent gains, with the Franc approaching 0.9800 vs nearly 0.9700 and underlying safe-haven demand offset by prospects of SNB intervention at any time if the Chf appreciates too much. Indeed, Eur/Chf has also bounced further from recent lows between 1.0925-50 confines even though Eur/Usd remains top heavy on the 1.1200 handle amidst increasingly soft/negative Eurozone bond yields. Elsewhere, Cable is also struggling to maintain recovery momentum through 1.2200 and 0.9200 in Eur/Gbp cross terms amidst ongoing Brexit no deal/UK political risk, while the Loonie is straddling 1.3300 ahead of Canadian Ivey PMI prints.</p><p>EM - Notwithstanding the wider swings in risk sentiment and specific factors impacting individual currencies and assets, the Lira revival continues, and the latest reversal in Usd/Try looks rather technical as key support ahead of 5.5000 has now given way.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Fixed continues to drive higher this morning, with <strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>Gilts</strong> making more headway (highs of 177.37 and 134.68 respectively) in catch-up trade after the late Tuesday squeeze in US Treasuries that continued overnight. Note, even a somewhat disappointing German 5 year placement was largely disregarded or only briefly acknowledged, as the global bond rally rumbles on after a pause and bout of consolidation yesterday. To recap, debt bulls have been driven by the global narrative (trade/currency wars) and fuelled further by surprise cuts in terms of magnitude from both the RBNZ and RBI today, while the BoT defied steady expectations and eased 25 bp as well. Returning to the German 10yr, which has surpassed one of the aforementioned technical levels, leaving just 177.50 and the -60 bp yield untouched, for now at least. Looking ahead the US data slate is uninspiring, though comments from Fed’s Evans at 14:30 BST will be closely watched for any September FOMC clues, particularly in light of the deteriorating US-China relations. Supply may also be pivotal given the 2nd of this week's Treasury auctions in the form of Usd27 bln 10s and the cash equivalent close to fresh 1.65% lows.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>A day of respite thus far for the energy market following this month’s losses of almost 10%, pressured by the global oil demand outlook as the US-China saga intensifies. Yesterday saw the first of the monthly oil reports, the EIA STEO cut its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast by 70k BPD to a 1.0mln BPD Y/Y increase, albeit its 2020 forecast was raised slightly by 30k BPD. Investors will be keeping an eye on the IEA (Aug 6) and OPEC (Aug 16) Monthly reports for some harmony on the short-term global oil demand outlook. On the supply side, the weekly API crude stocks data showed a larger-than-forecast draw (-3.4mln vs. Exp. -2.8mln), the release did little to sway prices but may have underpinned the benchmarks in anticipation for today’s DoE data to confirm the drawdown (headline crude Exp. -2.845mln). Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> is inching closer to the key 1500/oz level with futures having already topped the level amid safe-haven inflows as US/China developments, global growth outlook and easing by global Central Banks. <strong>Spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> printed a fresh 6yr peak at 1491/oz during early EU trade. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices have rebounded off worst levels, albeit remain contained near 2yr lows with some support derived from news that Glencore is planning to shut its Mutanda cobalt and copper mine (which produced almost 200k tonnes of copper last year) by the end of 2019 due to lower cobalt prices impacting the economic viability of the project. Finally, Dalian <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> prices extended its slide for a fifth session amid rising supply and weakening demand.</p>",

Moreover, the RBI has just delivered more than expected too and the PBoC has not refrained from lifting the Usd/Cny fixing further, albeit stopping just short of the 7.0000 mark that may not be an official tipping point, but would be sensitive for obvious reasons. Once again German data has hardly factored or mattered it seems, though significantly worse than forecast IP will undo much of the positivity forged from Tuesday’s factory orders beat and leaves the Eurozone’s premier economy on course for a GDP contraction in Q2. Ahead, Eur4 bn Bobl supply may not need a lot of concession, although the outright cash yield is considerably softer, and the same could be said for upcoming 10 year US issuance after a so-so 3 year sale last night. Back to Bunds, and the nearest chart resistance, if 177.00 is breached comes in around 177.17 before 177.29.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY</strong> was slightly softer and briefly nudged below 97.50, although its major counterparts were also lacklustre in which <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> just about held on to a 1.1200 handle and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> rangebound above 1.2150 amid a lack of ground-breaking Brexit developments. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> tested the 106.00 level to the downside and JPY-crosses were lower as the cautious risk tone spurred safe-haven flows, while <strong>CNH</strong> was pressured after the PBoC set the reference rate slightly weaker than expected at 6.9996 vs. Exp. 6.9994 and just shy of the psychologically important 7.0000 level. Antipodeans were the biggest movers as <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> tumbled after the RBNZ announced a deeper than expected OCR cut of 50bps to 1.00% as it sought to ensure reaching its inflation and employment objectives, with further pressure seen in the press conference after Governor Orr stated today's action does not rule out any future action and brushed upon the notion of negative rates, while AUD/USD trickled below 0.6700 in sympathy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RBNZ cut the Official Cash Rate by 50bps to 1.00% which was deeper than the Exp. 25bps cut</strong>. RBNZ said the OCR cut was necessary to support employment and inflation policy remit, while it added the cut demonstrates commitment to meeting the inflation target and that the committee agreed larger initial stimulus would best ensure reaching inflation and employment objectives. Members also noted that estimates of neutral level of rates have continued to fall and that balance of risks to reaching their objectives are tilted to the downside. Furthermore, <strong>RBNZ Governor Orr said at the press conference that today's action does not rule out any future action and that it is easily within the realms of possibility we may have to use negative interest rates</strong> but added that today's cut reduces the risk of using negative rates. (Newswires)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mixed amid the cautious risk tone with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures flat below the USD 54.00/bbl level and near its lowest since mid-June after the prior day’s 2% drop amid weaker global oil demand growth forecasts, while a slightly wider than expected draw in API crude oil inventories did little to prop up prices. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices benefitted from a softer greenback and increased demand for safe-havens due to the lacklustre risk appetite, which also kept <strong>copper</strong> contained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>API Crude Inventories -3.4mln vs. Exp. -2.8mln (Prev. -6.0mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p><strong>EIA Monthly report cuts 2019 world oil demand growth forecast by 70k BPD to 1.0mln BPD Y/Y</strong> increase but raised 2020 world oil demand growth by 30k bpd to 1.43mln BPD Y/Y increase, while it sees US crude output to rise by 1.28mln BPD to 12.27mln in 2019 (Prev. 1.4mln bpd increase) and to increase 990k BPD to 13.26mln BPD in 2020 (Prev. 900k BPD increase). (Newswires)</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>North Korea stated it launched a new type of tactical guided missile and its leader Kim said military actions send a warning to US and South Korea regarding military drills. (KCNA)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Treasury yields rose slightly on Tuesday, but could not pare back Monday’s gains; the curve was bear-flattening in early trade, and continued to do so through the session, but yields are mixed at settlement (2s yields +2.8bps, 5s +1bps, 10s +0.3bps, 30s -3.1bps). Net/net, however, the bias was towards flattening, with major spreads coming in modestly. The Treasury sold 3-year debt at the lowest yield at auction since 2017, at 1.562%, stopping through by 0.1bps. Cover was a touch softer than recent averages however. Participation metrics were in line with recent averages; dealers took 34.01% (vs. 6-auction average 36.9%), directs took 19.3% (vs. 6-auction average 16.3%), indirects took 46.66% (vs. 6-auction average 46.8%). The auction was generally considered solid, showing demand remains in the front-end of the curve. US T-note futures (U9) settled 2+ ticks lower at 129-24+.</p><p><strong>Fed’s Bullard (Dove, Voter) said he would like to ease policy more to raise inflation</strong> and inflation expectations as well as steepen the yield curves but added that we will have to see how data appears before deciding whether it is appropriate to cut rates in September. Furthermore, <strong>Bullard said he does not see conditions that would warrant a 50bps cut all at once</strong> and that it is not clear if Fed wants to ‘pile on’ more monetary accommodation, while he also stated further action may be ‘desirable’ and the economy is adjusting to Fed’s shift from raising to cutting rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: RBI is expected to lower rates by 25bps for a 4th consecutive meeting",
        "content": "<p>RBI will announce its latest policy decision today in which the central bank is expected to lower rates again with 53 out of 66 economists surveyed by a major newswire forecasting the Repurchase Rate to be cut by 25bps to 5.50%, while 3 expect a 50bps cut and 10 are calling for rates to be kept unchanged. In addition, the RBI is expected to lower the Reverse Repo Rate by 25bps to 5.25% and the Cash Reserve Ratio is forecast to be maintained at 4.00%.</p><p>Expectations for the RBI to lower rates for the 4th consecutive occasion in as many meetings since Governor Das took over the helm at the apex bank, has been supported by several factors including the central bank's track record of appeasing the Modi government's wishes for looser policy to support the economy. This willingness to succumb to government pressure has raised concerns regarding the RBI's independence and is seen to be a factor for the early resignation of Deputy Governor Acharya who recently stepped down 6 months before the end of his term, while Acharya's departure is also likely to be a shift to a more dovish composition of the MPC as he was a known hawk and along with MPC member Ghate, dissented at the February and April meetings.</p><p>Recent data also suggests there is room to reduce rates with CPI in June at 3.18% vs. Exp. 3.20% (Prev. 3.05%) which is below the central bank's 4.0% threshold target, while other economic releases such as weaker export figures and softer Industrial Production growth at 3.1% vs. Exp. 3.2% (Prev. 3.4%) points to the economy remaining sluggish and doesn’t provide much encouragement for the country’s GDP which fell to 5.8% vs. Exp. 6.3% (Prev. 6.6%) during the January-March quarter to bring FY18/19 growth to a 5-year low of 6.8% vs. Exp. 6.9% (Prev. 7.0%).</p><p>In addition, slowdown concerns and increasing protectionist policies around the world such as the US-China trade war and with India in its own tiff with the US, in which it recently announced to levy retaliatory tariffs on 28 US goods after US President Trump suspended India's GSP status, are further reasons which support the case for additional policy easing.</p><p>Conversely, there are arguments that suggest a pause could be considered including the insufficient transmission of rate cuts by commercial banks to the borrower as the RBI’s prior 75bps cut have only resulted to a 10bps-15bps decline in lending rates. RBI Governor Das also recently stated that India's banks are in a better position to lend and signs are looking good for the economy, while he added that the interest rate stance now depends on data and suggested that prior rate cuts along with the RBI's accommodative stance is equal to 100bps of easing.</p><p>The rate announcement is due at 0715BST/0115CDT/1415HKT, while focus will also be on the statement in which the central bank is likely to maintain its accommodative policy stance, as well as the voting composition considering that the last rate cut in June was made by unanimous vote. As a reminder, market reactions to RBI policy announcements can be irregular as previous easing has surprisingly underpinned the currency in some previous occasions which is due to anticipation fund inflows could be spurred amid the more supportive policy.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mixed as the region observed caution despite the gains on Wall St. where stocks rebounded from their worst performance of 2019. ASX 200 (+0.7%) was initially indecisive as early gains were nearly wiped out by weakness in energy following a 2% drop in oil and with financials subdued after its largest lender CBA reported a decline in FY profits. However, Australia stocks were then boosted in late trade alongside outperformance in NZX 50 (+1.7%) after the RBNZ over-delivered with a surprise 50bps cut, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) was pressured as exporters digested a firmer currency and earnings updates. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) were lacklustre as trade concerns lingered and after the PBoC weakened the reference rate to within a whisker of the 7.0000 ‘line in the sand’ level, although losses in the mainland were contained amid reports that China is to revise quota rules for farm product import tariffs in which it will remove soybean oil, rapeseed oil and palm oil import quotas. Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned as cautiousness spurred safe-haven demand and with global yields declining amid what some view as an ongoing race to the bottom among some of the world’s major central banks.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed as the region observes caution despite the gains on Wall St. where stocks rebounded from their worst performance of 2019. ASX 200 (+0.3%) is indecisive as initial upside was nearly wiped out by weakness in energy following a 2% drop in oil and with financials also subdued after its largest lender CBA reported a decline in FY profits, while NZX 50 (+1.0%) outperformed from the open in anticipation of a rate cut by the RBNZ which eventually over-delivered with a surprise 50bps cut, and Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) is the laggard as stocks react to a firmer currency and earnings updates. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are subdued as trade concerns linger and after the PBoC weakened the reference rate to within a whisker of the 7.0000 ‘line in the sand’ level, although losses in the mainland were contained amid reports that China is to revise quota rules for farm product import tariffs in which it will remove soybean oil, rapeseed oil and palm oil import quotas.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly softer and has nudged below the 97.50 level although its major counterparts are also lacklustre with EUR/USD just about holding on to the 1.1200 handle and with GBP/USD rangebound above 1.2150 amid a lack of groundbreaking Brexit developments and with Parliament on a summer recess. Elsewhere, USD/JPY tests the 106.00 level to the downside and JPY-crosses are lower as the cautious risk tone spurs safe-haven flows, while CNH is pressured after the PBoC set the reference rate slightly weaker than expected at 6.9996 vs. Exp. 6.9994 and just shy of the psychologically important 7.0000 level. Antipodeans were the biggest movers as NZD/USD tumbled after the RBNZ announced a deeper than expected OCR cut of 50bps to 1.00% as it seeks to ensure reaching its inflation and employment objectives, which in turn dragged AUD/USD in sympathy.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices underpinned by the cautiousness in the region and with global yields declining amid what some view as a race to the bottom among some of the world’s major central banks.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The RBNZ will decide on rates on Wednesday where the MPC is expected to cut the Official Cash Rate by 25bps to 1.25% with markets pricing a 100% chance of a 25bps cut, as well as a 71% chance for a further 25bps cut to 1.00% by November.</p><p>Expectations for a cut at the upcoming meeting have been supported by similar policy loosening in other major central banks including the Fed which lowered rates for the first time in more than a decade last week. Closer to home, the RBA have recently delivered back-to-back rate cuts for June and July which paves the way for the RBNZ to play catch up to its trans-Tasman counterpart after having been the first central bank in the developed world to lower rates in the current cycle with its 25bps cut to the OCR in May, while other external factors which have also spurred increased calls for looser policy include the US-China trade dispute and global growth slowdown concerns.</p><p>The latest New Zealand data has been mixed with Trade Balance for June at a larger than expected surplus of 365M vs. Exp. 100M (Prev. 264M) although Exports and Imports were slightly softer than expected at 5.01B vs. Exp. 5.29B (Prev. 5.81B) and 4.65B vs. Exp. 5.20B (Prev. 5.54B) respectively. Elsewhere, the latest inflation figures for Q2 increased as expected with CPI Q/Q at 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.1%) and CPI Y/Y at 1.7% vs. Exp. 1.7% (Prev. 1.5%) although this remains below the mid-point of the RBNZ's 1%-3% medium-term target. Furthermore, there was a stellar jobs and wages report for Q2 in which the Unemployment Rate dropped to 3.9% from 4.2%, although business survey data further deteriorated with ANZ Business Confidence at its weakest since August last year and profitability expectations for the construction sector at its lowest in a decade.</p><p>Comments have been few and far between from RBNZ officials since the last meeting, where it noted that a lower OCR may be needed over time and cited downside risks to employment as well as inflation. The RBNZ also stated at the last meeting that the Committee discussed the merits of lowering OCR and that risks to achieving its objectives are tilted to the downside relative to the May statement, which essentially paves the way for a further rate reduction. In addition, there were recent reports that the RBNZ are looking at unconventional policy strategies although its unconventional policy work was said to be at a very early stage, and it would be prudent to think the central bank may want to exhaust regular policy measures first.</p><p>The RBNZ rate decision is scheduled for 0300BST/2100CDT/1000HKT where attention will be on the actual announcement in which a cut is seen as a forgone conclusion. Focus will then shift to the policy statement as any comments which support market pricing for a 3rd cut in November will likely weigh on NZD, while RBNZ Governor Orr will also conduct a press conference 1 hour after the meeting.</p><p>Recent Comments and Calls</p><ul><li>ANZ Bank forecasts the RBNZ to lower rates by a total 75bps to 0.75% by November.</li><li>ASB now sees RBNZ cutting rates at this meeting and in November vs. Prev. forecast for just a cut at the upcoming announcement, citing weak business confidence and potential impact on the labour market from declining profit margins.</li><li>New Zealand Shadow Board does not expect a change in the OCR.</li></ul>",
