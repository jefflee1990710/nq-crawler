UBS notes that despite the excitement generated around the primary, it should provide little regarding a signal, “This is home territory for Bernie Sanders, as he’s the senator for neighbouring Vermont, and it’s no surprise to see him in the lead of a poll of polls from FiveThirtyEight.” The bank highlights that it is likely we will see some of the minor candidates drop out after New Hampshire, but not any of the front-runners.</li><li>It is difficult to get an exact signal from the Iowa Caucus; Buttigieg and Sanders were neck and neck, although both have claimed victory and subsequently called for a partial recanvass. Warren, in third place, puts the “market-friendly” former VP Joe Biden in fourth place. The market reaction has been limited, save some outperformance in Managed Healthcare stocks, with the worst-case scenario (Warren or Sanders) not building as much momentum as feared, both of whose policies are likely to be seen as disruptive by market participants. Buttigieg, however, is also running on a progressive platform, where many details of his policies still need filling in.</li><li>Looking at an average of polls, compiled by Real Clear Politics, Biden narrowly leads at 23%, Sanders at 22.7%, Warren at 15.3%, Bloomberg at 12.7%, Buttigieg at 8.3%, and Klobuchar at 4.3%.</li></ul>",

Rather than specific headlines driving tape action, participants were left to evaluate the wider themes: growing coronavirus cases - although a slowing recorded rate of new cases, there has been a faster increase in reported deaths. T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) had a US Judge rule in favour of its merger, in a blow to State AG’s, the ruling saw S rally over 75% and TMUS over 10%. Facebook (FB) was lower following a downgrade at Pivotal Research and Slack (WORK) was hit after it announced IBM has always been its largest customer, and its customer base has been slowly increasing over the last few years, pouring cold water on previous day reports. Microsoft (MSFT) gave back the majority of the prior day gains as it fell over 3% on Tuesday. Netflix (NFLX) executives appeared on stage at the Samsung phone launch event to discuss a partnership, where Samsung announced an unveiled a new 5G Galaxy S20, and Galaxy Buds+, in competition with Apple (AAPL). Boeing’s net orders through January 31st for its 737 (NG and MAX), 777, 777X were all zero; deliveries through the same period were 13.</p><p>The TPLEX pared-back Monday’s gains overnight before finding a floor in the European session. Although US equities opened at new ATHs, participants weren’t eager to push yields any higher, following on from Monday where yields pushed lower despite an equity rally. The curve structure was little changed too, with some desks noting the 3-year auction as keeping the front/belly end weighted: the auction tailed the 1.392% WI by 2bps and Dealers took a larger share than usual, although it was covered 2.56x, higher than the six-auction average. By settlement, yields up to the 10-year maturity were higher by just over 4bps, while the 30-year was only 3bps higher. US T-note futures (H20) settled 11+ ticks lower.</p>",

Rather than specific headlines driving tape action, participants were left to evaluate the wider themes: growing coronavirus cases - although a slowing recorded rate of new cases, there has been a faster increase in reported deaths - the New Hampshire Democratic Primary later on Tuesday, a weak JOLTS report and Fed Chair Powell's testimony, which largely stuck to the FOMC script whilst avoiding any hints that policy is set to change due to the virus. Additionally, some desks were attributing the afternoon drift lower being exacerbated by reports the FTC had sent orders to GOOG, AMZN, AAPL and FB, asking for information on prior acquisitions - although others question how much this really changes the broader picture. The TPLEX pared-back Monday's strength overnight, finding its floor in early European trade, failing to fall further with the following equity strength - participants were cautious to let yields rise further, with the 10-year sitting at 1.59%. However, the higher yields did support the Dollar in earlier trade, the DXY nearly touched the 99.00 handle, briefly seeing EURUSD falling beneath 1.09, although the move reversed course throughout the session. Crude marched in sympathy with equities, although did settle firmer, with Brent outperforming its West Texan counterpart - the EIA downgraded its 2020 world oil demand forecast. Looking ahead, markets are awaiting the New Hampshire Democratic Primary results (Sanders expected to come out on top), in addition to the RBNZ and Riksbank rate decisions on Wednesday, whilst balancing the potential impact of the ongoing coronavirus in a data-light calendar, although earnings from NVDA, CSCO and CVS will draw attention.</p><p><strong>* FED POWELL TESTIMONY: </strong>Fed Chair Powell said in his semi-annual testimony that he expects the Fed to continue T-bill purchases and repo operations into Q2 and anticipates to reach an appropriate level of reserves around mid-year. Powell said the low interest rate environment might limit the ability of central banks to reduce policy interest rates enough to support the economy during a downturn. On the coronavirus, Powell didn’t indicate any imminent changes to policy as a result of the outbreak but reiterated that the Fed is closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy. The Fed Chair also called on fiscal policy, saying the current low rate environment means that it would be important for fiscal policy to help support the economy if it weakens. The speech otherwise mainly echoed points made in the January 29th FOMC meeting; click <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/fed-chair-powell-neutral-says-he-expects-the-fed-to-continue-t-bill-purchases-and-repo-operations-into-q2-anticipates-to-reach-an-appropriate-level-of-reserves-around-mid-year-11-02-2020\">here</a> to see further. Note that during Powell’s testimony, US President Trump tweeted his usual criticism, saying that when Powell started his testimony, the Dow was up 125 and counting, and as he spoke it drifted steadily downward, as usual, and is now at -15; Germany and others get paid to borrow money, Dollar is too high, the President added.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>China reported 2478 new coronavirus cases and 108 new deaths as of Feb. 10th, vs. 3062 new cases and 97 additional deaths for Feb. 9th, to bring the total amount of cases to 42638 and death toll to 1016. The main commentary today arose from Advisor Nanshan, who stated that coronavirus outbreak could peak later on this month and then plateau according to current model and trend, and China needs a stronger and more powerful system for disease control. As well as from Chinese President Xi who stated that prevention and control work on the virus is having positive results - economic and social targets that have been set will be completed, likely alluding to the Government being confident in achieving its 6.0-6.5% GDP target for 2020. However, research has suggested that China’s GDP growth could see a 1ppt impact from the coronavirus.</p><p><strong>* NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRAT PRIMARY:</strong> The latest CNN poll for New Hampshire printed Sanders at 29% (+1%), Buttigieg at 22% (-1), Biden at 11% (-1%), Warren at 10% (+1%), and Klobuchar at 7% (+1%). UBS notes that despite the excitement generated around the primary, it should provide little regarding a signal, “This is home territory for Bernie Sanders, as he’s the senator for neighbouring Vermont, and it’s no surprise to see him in the lead of a poll of polls from FiveThirtyEight.” The bank highlights that it is likely we will see some of the minor candidates drop out after New Hampshire, but not any of the front-runners. It is difficult to get an exact signal from the Iowa Caucus; Buttigieg and Sanders were neck and neck, although both have claimed victory and subsequently called for a partial recanvass. Warren, in third place, puts the “market-friendly” former VP Joe Biden in fourth place. The market reaction has been limited, save some outperformance in Managed Healthcare stocks, with the worst-case scenario (Warren or Sanders) not building as much momentum as feared, both of whose policies are likely to be seen as disruptive by market participants. Buttigieg, however, is also running on a progressive platform, where many details of his policies still need filling in. Looking at an average of polls, compiled by Real Clear Politics, Biden narrowly leads at 23%, Sanders at 22.7%, Warren at 15.3%, Bloomberg at 12.7%, Buttigieg at 8.3%, and Klobuchar at 4.3%.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Overnight, <strong>Fed’s Harker (Voter)</strong> stated he would support a rate increase if there was sustained growth in inflation, although noted the US is not there yet, and that the Fed would need to discuss the economy if the coronavirus situation worsens, but they are currently not at that point, adding a rate cut would not do anything to boost business investment. On the balance sheet, Harker noted balance sheet growth is consistent with organic growth and reiterated it is not providing QE, adding the repo support should act as a backstop. <strong>Fed's Kashkari (Voter, Dove)</strong> stated interest rates are slightly accomodative and are not providing much of a boost. On the coronavirus, Kashkari noted it is a downside risk for China, and if it hits the US in scale it would be a downside risk. The dove noted one could imagine a monetary policy response if there was a pandemic, although he cannot forecast this. On China, Kashkari noted it seems like the battles between the US and China on trade are not getting worse. <strong>Fed's Bullard (non-voter, dove)</strong> on current monetary policy said: “it feels a little bit accommodative” and that rate normalisation in previous years will pay dividends as the Fed has scope to react to a downturn. Bullard noted China’s economy is expected to slow noticeably this quarter due to the coronavirus, some of the recent Treasury yield declines are likely already showing the impact of the coronavirus; easing of trade uncertainty may set the stage for a rebound in manufacturing, although the Fed should wait and see how things evolve in China. Bullard added that the best case for the US is a soft landing following the recent rate cuts as housing and other interest rate-sensitive sectors rebound.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB President <strong>Lagarde</strong> (neutral) continued to call on fiscal policy to assist monetary policy. Lagarde said the strategy review launched by the ECB’s Governing Council last month will also take stock of how rapid digitalization and the threat to environmental sustainability – together with globalisation and evolving financial structures – have further transformed the environment in which monetary policy operates; it will consider all aspects of the ECB’s policy framework. ECB's<strong> Schnabel</strong> said the ECB's current policy stance is necessary to achieve sustained price stability in the Euro area; in the current situation, a fundamental departure from ECB's current policy does not seem appropriate. Schnabel said developments in real estate prices are rightly coming under scrutiny, but despite the latest surge, CPI-adjusted real estate prices in Germany are still at a relatively low level by international standards. The German Governor said calls for higher interest rates should instead be directed at governments and legislators; highly indebted member states did not make enough use of the period of low rates to consolidate their government budgets. On fiscal policy, she said it is primarily up to other policymakers to counter the side effects of monetary policy. Meanwhile, ECB's <strong>Lane</strong> said currently the ECB is in a stage in which accommodative policy is still required. <strong>ECB sources</strong> suggest ECB policy review is unlikely to change the treatment of house prices in the current inflation target and the review will instead increase pressure on eurostat to include house prices in inflation data over a longer-term. Note, the current framework understates the impact of prices; as such, its inclusion could lead to higher inflation of up to 0.2-0.3pp. Reports this morning noted the ECB could decide on whether to change its inflation goal by the Summer, in what is being described as a “rushed agenda”, according to officials.</p><p><strong>*RBNZ PREVIEW:</strong> RBNZ are expected to stand pat on rates leaving the cash rate at 1.00%, expectations for the RBNZ to remain on hold have been fuelled by recent data releases. RBNZ recently noted that the reduction in the OCR over the past year was transmitting through the economy and would take time to have a full effect. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23839/download\">Click here for full preview</a>.</p><p><strong>* EIA STEO: </strong>Cuts 2020 world oil demand growth by 310k BPD to 1.03mln BPD (a cut was expected due to the coronavirus); raises forecast for 2021 world oil demand growth by 140k BPD to 1.52mln BPD. US crude output to rise 360k BPD to 13.56mln BPD in 2021 (prev. rise of 410k BPD); US crude output to rise 960k BPD to 13.2mln BPD in 2020 (prev. rise of 1.06mln BPD). The magnitude and duration of the coronavirus’s effects remain highly uncertain, but EIA is reducing its estimates for Chinese and global oil consumption for 2020 as a result of the events.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLES US 0.37 HIGHER AT USD 49.94/BBL; BRENT (J0) SETTLES USD 0.74 HIGHER AT USD 54.01/BBL. </strong>The energy markets were bid on Tuesday, particularly Brent, paring back the move lower in the crude benchmarks on Monday which saw an unwinding of the WTI/Brent Arb reaching multi-year lows. Note the tape action in oil appeared correlated to that of the US equity complex, with both assets coming off their highs before the energy settlement. No decision regarding an OPEC or OPEC+ early meeting/extended cut has yet been made, although Russian Energy Minister Novak said it would hold a meeting tomorrow with domestic oil producers to discuss the OPEC+ deal, Tass reported citing sources. Furthermore, the Kazakhstan Energy Minister said it was considering the proposal by the OPEC+ JTC to further reduce its own output by 20-30k BP. US Energy Secretary Brouillette spoke later saying that the US is not concerned regarding potential OPEC action to further cut output, adding that OPEC's ability to impact oil prices has diminished in the last few decades, whatever decision OPEC makes will be good for the US. Participants could also be positioning ahead of this week's US energy inventories, current expectations (bbls): crude +3.0mln, gasoline +0.5mln, distillates -0.6mln, and Genscape forecast Cushing +2.3mln.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H20) SETTLED 11+ TICKS LOWER AT 131</strong>: The TPLEX pared-back Monday’s gains overnight before finding a floor in the European session. Although US equities opened at new ATHs, participants weren’t eager to push yields any higher, following on from Monday where yields pushed lower despite an equity rally. The curve structure was little changed too, with some desks noting the 3-year auction as keeping the front/belly end weighted: the auction tailed the 1.392% WI by 2bps and Dealers took a larger share than usual, although it was covered 2.56x, higher than the six-auction average. By settlement, yields up to the 10-year maturity were higher by just over 4bps, while the 30-year was only 3bps higher.</p><p><strong>* BOE: </strong>Outgoing<strong> </strong>Governor Carney, who opted to stand pat on rates in January, stated that we should be providing some stimulus to bring the UK economy back to the trend rate of growth, although that the MPC in March should take into account the March 11th budget in future decisions. Carney noted the market curve in January predicts some loosening of policy, but that would cause inflation to be a little over target. BoE’s Haskel (Dissenter) stated the current limited room on monetary policy means he continues to prefer to move now on rates and that the trend towards intangible assets reinforces a low rate environment.</p><p><strong>* UK GDP: </strong>Preliminary Q4 GDP printed in-line with market expectations on a QQ basis, and topped estimates YY (1.1% vs. Exp. 0.85); while the December estimate also came in firmer than predicted. The release prompted mild moves in UK assets, but they were short-lived; as the data is for December and Q4 and as such does not fully encapsulate the ‘Boris-Bounce’ expected after the December General Election. However, UBS note the ONS report gives reference to the declining underlying momentum of the economy and that the momentum of the service industry is showing signs of easing. Overall, UBS states there will be a concern on the fixed capital formation in the data falling significantly more than expected and that it is hard to see this report in its entirety as ‘a positive report for the UK economy’. Looking ahead to Q1 metrics, Pantheon continues to expect QQ growth to increase to circa. 0.3% ahead of the BoE’s 0.2% forecast; as such, persuading the Committee to continue to keep rates on hold.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU’s Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier stated there will not be general open-ended ongoing equivalence for financial services with UK, following reports that Ministers are working on a white paper designed to outline a vision for the financial services sector after the Brexit transition period, to be published in the Spring. Designed to retain regulatory autonomy while seeking ‘a “reliable equivalence process”, on which a “durable relationship” can be built.’. On equivalence, notes that it will only be granted if each side believes the others regulations are compatible; however, this does not mean identical – full range of equivalence assessments to be conducted by June. Also of note, BoE Governor Carney stated the EU financial services equivalence regime is “relatively unstable” and that London will remain the gateway to global markets for many, including Europe, for the foreseeable future. Elsewhere, Deputy Governor Cunliffe said it is conceivable that global markets in London will shift to the EU, but this is not likely.</p><p><strong>* TURKEY/SYRIA:</strong> Tensions between Turkey and Syria (and indirectly Russia) have moved up a gear in recent days following the collapse of the fragile ceasefire, which was brokered by Turkey and Russia. For reference, Russia heavily backs the Syrian government whilst Turkey supports Syrian rebels. Over the weekend, Turkey reallocated military to Syria whilst yesterday, Syrian government forces conducted shelling which killed five Turkish soldiers.&nbsp; As part of its retaliation, Turkish-backed rebels shot down a Syrian helicopter with reports of ongoing to and fro offensives throughout the day. Turkish President Erdogan took an aggressive stance and noted that the Syrian government will “pay a very heavy price” for attacking Turkish troops while adding that he will announce a plan on Wednesday on how to handle developments in Idlib. Russia meanwhile stood behind their ally and noted that all terrorist attacks on Syrian and Russian forces must cease. Desks note that Turkey’s deteriorating relationship with Russia may prompt the latter to slow S-400 component deliveries and cooperation to Turkey, whilst US’ suspension of the F-35 fighter jets programme could together leave Turkey vulnerable with soured relations.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 +0.17% at 3357, Dow +/-0% at 29,276, NDX +0.01% at 9518<strong>. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Disc +0.77%, Cons Stpl -0.36%, Energy +1.04%, Financials +0.4%, Health +0.6%, Industrials +0.35%, Materials +0.5%, Real Estate +1.2%, Technology -0.34%, Communication Svs -0.6%, Utilities +0.4%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Under Armour (UAA) traded heavily in the red after providing disappointing guidance to reflect the impacts of the coronavirus. DaVita (DVA) was slightly higher to end the day after it raised its FY20 EPS guidance. Mecardolibre (MELI) traded marginally lower after it reported a greater than expected loss per share. Hasbro (HAS) opened higher. However gains were lost throughout the day and the toymaker finished marginally lower despite reporting a firmer EPS and announcing it met its key goals set in 2019, however its revenues were light and it suspended its share repurchase programme.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) had a US Judge rule in favour of its merger, in a blow to State AG’s, the ruling saw S rally over 75% and TMUS over 10%. Facebook (FB) was lower following a downgrade at Pivotal Research and Slack (WORK) was hit after it announced IBM has always been its largest customer, and its customer base has been slowly increasing over the last few years, pouring cold water on previous day reports. Microsoft (MSFT) gave back the majority of the prior day gains as it fell over 3% on Tuesday. Netflix (NFLX) executives appeared on stage at the Samsung phone launch event to discuss a partnership, where Samsung announced an unveiled a new 5G Galaxy S20, and Galaxy Buds+, in competition with Apple (AAPL). Boeing’s net orders through January 31st for its 737 (NG and MAX), 777, 777X were all zero; deliveries through the same period were 13.</p><p><strong>* FTC: </strong>The FTC issued a notice to large-cap tech names (GOOGL, FB, AMZN, AAPL, FB and MSFT) for information on previous deals for research, not law enforcement. However, the FTC noted that it is possible that potential law enforcement could follow, following the research. Desks highlight it relates to deals in between 2010-2019, the notice relates to deals that previously fell below the Hard-Scott Rodino threshold. Desks suggest the news isn’t as negative as it sounds, although deals will come under scrutiny (FB/Instagram and Whatsapp), it does not seem the FTC will remove large deals and instead only focus on the smaller ones.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong>&nbsp;gave up some of the prior day gains after initially rising to highs 98.96, levels not seen since October, after Fed Chair Powell largely reiterated the Fed’s statement to congress and amid Euro selling.&nbsp; The gains were shortlived, however, failing to get to the 99.00 handle, and sold off throughout the rest of the session finding lows after the latest JOLTS data, which saw job openings decline in December to 6.423mln from 6.8mln.&nbsp;<strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong>was firmer following an upbeat GDP report, beating expectations; the report set the tone for the rest of the session and Cable saw one-way trade throughout but remains beneath the key 1.30 figure.&nbsp;<strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong>initially crossed 109 to the downside against the buck, printing multi-month lows for the cross, however, it regained the key figure as the buck weakened throughout the afternoon.&nbsp;<strong>CNH</strong>&nbsp;continued to firm and remained beneath the 7.00 figure, UOB believes that USDCNH could ease lower towards 6.9680 over the next 24 hours (from this morning) with support at 6.95, although the desk did not expect that to come into play today, which it didn’t.&nbsp;<strong>JPY</strong>&nbsp;saw another uneventful day trading very rangebound around the 109.80 mark throughout the majority of the session trading flat against the greenback.&nbsp;<strong>XAU</strong>&nbsp;gave back some of the prior day's gains and the precious metal resides beneath the 1570 figure in line with Tuesday’s risk appetite. Antipodes were firmer with the broader risk appetite and ahead of tonight RBNZ rate decision.&nbsp;<strong>EMFX</strong>&nbsp;was mixed, with outperformance in&nbsp;<strong>RUB</strong>&nbsp;as oil prices saw a slight rebound.&nbsp;<strong>TRY</strong>&nbsp;back above 6.00 as the Lira falls on geopolitical concerns amid conflict with Syria escalating.&nbsp;</p>",

No decision regarding an OPEC or OPEC+ early meeting/extended cut has yet been made, although Russian Energy Minister Novak said it would hold a meeting tomorrow with domestic oil producers to discuss the OPEC+ deal, Tass reported citing sources. Furthermore, the Kazakhstan Energy Minister said it was considering the proposal by the OPEC+ JTC to further reduce its own output by 20-30k BP. US Energy Secretary Brouillette spoke later saying that the US is not concerned regarding potential OPEC action to further cut output, adding that OPEC's ability to impact oil prices has diminished in the last few decades, whatever decision OPEC makes will be good for the US. Participants could also be positioning ahead of this week's US energy inventories, current expectations (bbls): crude +3.0mln, gasoline +0.5mln, distillates -0.6mln, and Genscape forecast Cushing +2.3mln.</li><li><strong>EIA STEO: </strong>Cuts 2020 world oil demand growth by 310k BPD to 1.03mln BPD (a cut was expected due to the coronavirus); raises forecast for 2021 world oil demand growth by 140k BPD to 1.52mln BPD.

Hence, the index and broad Dollar could well have exhausted their upside boundaries for the day, or time being at least after the former got agonisingly close to 99.000, but not quite at 98.965 before drifting back down towards 98.700.</p><p><strong>AUD/NOK/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie is now the clear G10 outperformer and forming a firmer base on the 0.6700 handle with the aid of an encouraging and pronounced pick up in housing finance. However, fuelled by a relatively strong rebound in crude prices in wake of Monday’s significantly stronger than expected inflation data, the Norwegian Crown is not far behind and making more headway vs the Euro with the cross now down below 10.0900. Back down under, even the Kiwi looks more relaxed/less ruffled vs the Greenback and off worst levels against its Antipodean peer pre-RBNZ, as Nzd/Usd reclaims 0.6400+ status and Aud/Nzd hovers just shy of 1.0500 – see our Research Suite for a preview of the upcoming February policy meeting.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>Not to be outdone and also using oil as a source of energy, the Loonie has pared more losses vs its US counterpart through 1.3280 compared to 1.3320 at the other extreme, while Sterling derived some support/relief from the UK economy avoiding contraction in Q1 partly due to marginally firmer than forecast m/m growth over December. Indeed, Cable extended recovery gains through yesterday’s and last Friday’s session bests to almost 1.2970, while Eur/Gbp reversed further from recent 0.8500+ peaks to circa 0.8420 before the Euro embarked on a pretty decent comeback of its own against the flagging US Dollar from sub-1.0900 to post a fresh apex for the (EU) session around 1.0925 and back near decent option expiry interest (1.2 bn) bang on time for the NY cut. Note, very little response from the Pound to BoE’s Cunliffe or Carney ahead of Haskel.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The major laggards, or to be more precise least active currencies, with the Franc hugging a 0.6765-87 range and Yen probing above 110.00 without the input of many Japanese participants due to the National Day holiday.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Broad retrenchment and retracement vs the Greenback in keeping with more Yuan strength allied to less intense angst about China’s COVID-19 outbreak that the US CDC declared more transmissible, but less severe than SARS. However, not much delight or even solace for the Turkish Lira as tensions and conflict in Syria rose, while the Mexican Peso and SA Rand both took disappointing manufacturing production largely in stride.</p>",

UBS notes that despite the excitement generated around the primary, it should provide little regarding a signal, “This is home territory for Bernie Sanders, as he’s the senator for neighbouring Vermont, and it’s no surprise to see him in the lead of a poll of polls from FiveThirtyEight.” The bank highlights that it is likely we will see some of the minor candidates drop out after New Hampshire, but not any of the front-runners.</li><li>It is difficult to get an exact signal from the Iowa Caucus; Buttigieg and Sanders were neck and neck, although both have claimed victory and subsequently called for a partial recanvass. Warren, in third place, puts the “market-friendly” former VP Joe Biden in fourth place. The market reaction has been limited, save some outperformance in Managed Healthcare stocks, with the worst-case scenario (Warren or Sanders) not building as much momentum as feared, both of whose policies are likely to be seen as disruptive by market participants. Buttigieg, however, is also running on a progressive platform, where many details of his policies still need filling in.</li><li>Looking at an average of polls, compiled by Real Clear Politics, Biden narrowly leads at 23%, Sanders at 22.7%, Warren at 15.3%, Bloomberg at 12.7%, Buttigieg at 8.3%, and Klobuchar at 4.3%.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p>Chair Powell is unlikely to deviate from the views he expressed after the FOMC's confab at the end of January. At that meeting, the FOMC kept rates unchanged at 1.50%-1.75%, in a unanimous decision; it did, however, raise its IOER for banks by 5bps to 1.60%; current policy stance was judged as appropriate. Within the statement, the Fed made a few small tweaks, one of those was to downgrade its view of household spending to \"moderate\" from \"strong\", and its view of inflation, which is now seen returning to its target from the previous \"near its target\". The press conference mostly focussed on medium/longer-term themes, like the balance sheet and policy framework. Powell emphasised the Fed was growing the balance sheet to ensure bank reserves were ample, a level which it believes it would hit in Q2; while he said there was no fixed level for its intended size, he said that levels of USD 1.5trln (where it stood at end-2019) would serve as a floor; the Fed would know when adjustments to the balance sheet have run its course when reserves were durably at a sustainable level. On inflation, Powell said the Fed tweaked its view within the statement to demonstrate that the Fed was not happy with missing its inflation target -- some Fedwatchers said that this opened the door to looser policy ahead, while other watchers noted that Powell was highlighting that purchases will be reduced as the appropriate level of the balance sheet is reached, potentially hinting at less accommodative conditions ahead. Meanwhile, Powell generally retained his upbeat view of the US economy, noting that financial conditions were supportive, trade tensions had eased, though were yet to go away, and the risks of a hard Brexit had diminished; citing PMI data, Powell said he believes that manufacturing may have bottomed (a view vindicated by the recent ISM report), but noted that nothing was assured. Indeed, the Fed Chair noted the macroeconomic uncertainties presented by the coronavirus, which he said were at an early stage. In aggregate, he stated he was \"cautiously optimistic\", a view likely to be reiterated this week.</p>",

Subsequently, the pan-European Stoxx 600 hit fresh record highs whilst the bellwether Eurostoxx 50 reached levels last seen in 2008.&nbsp; France’s CAC (+0.3%) marginally lags regional peers with the index weighed down by Michelin (-2.8%) post-earnings after the group watered-down guidance in which it now expects the FY20 operating income to be “slightly down YY” whilst also acknowledging softness in passenger cars, light trucks and off-road tire markets. Sectors are all in positive territory and reflect risk appetite as cyclicals outpace defensives. In terms of individual movers, Daimler (+1.0%) shares remain resilient post-earnings despite a slash to its FY dividend -&nbsp; which was set at EUR 0.90/shr, down from the prior of EUR 3.25/shr and below the expected EUR 1.30/shr. Shares remain buoyed following comments from its CEO who noted that cost-cutting measures will be ramped out as part of its initiative, whilst the overall risk sentiment also aids the stock as DAX30 Mar’20 futures probe its contract high of 13639 (Note: Daimler has a 5.6% weighting in DAX30). Sticking with Germany, Deutsche Telekom (+4.1%) shares are bolstered amid source reports that the long-awaited T-Mobile (+8.8% pre-market) and Sprint (+64% pre-market) merger may get the green light from US district judge later today. Deutsche Telekom is T-Mobile’s majority shareholder with a holding of ~63%. On the flip side, NMC Health (-13.6%) received a double whammy despite opening with mild gains, initial downside stemmed on the back of a City regulator probe into the complex director share pledges at NMC after the Co. revealed that it was not apparent who actually controls its largest shareholdings. Thereafter, the second wave of downside arose from KKR has confirming that it has not made an offer regarding an offer for the Co, and adding that it does not intend to make an offer for NMC – which comes amid yesterday’s upside in the NMC shares amid sources noting that it is in talks with KKR regarding a potential deal valued at around GBP 2bln.</p><p>FAA Chief, on the Boeing (BA) 737 Max, state that nothing is scheduled as of yet but they continue to narrow the issues; expect any global regulator approval to be, time-wise, close together but there may be differences regarding ungrounding</p><p>China smartphone shipments could sink 30% due to coronavirus, according to IDC. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/NOK -</strong> Déjà vu for the Aussie and Norwegian Krona, but this time the former has rallied on domestic grounds rather than Chinese data to an extent at least, while the latter has extended post-CPI gains with the aid of a firm bounce in oil prices. Aud/Usd is back above 0.6700 and Eur/Nok has crossed 10.1000 to the downside in wake of an acceleration in Australian home loans and as crude rebounds ahead of API inventory updates, the official EIA data on Wednesday and Russia’s meeting with oil companies to discuss OPEC+ proposals for deeper output cuts.</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> Notwithstanding the ongoing outperformance noted above, and resilience in other G10 currencies, the Dollar is still appreciating steadily with the DXY nudging over another Fib resistance level before fading a fraction below the psychological 99.000 mark. Perhaps some reticence and caution ahead of Fed chair Powell part 1, but the index has carved out a marginally firmer 98.810-917 range and registered a fresh 2020 peak in the process.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/GBP -</strong> The aforementioned recovery in oil has cushioned the Loonie to a degree between 1.3289-1.3320 parameters, but the Kiwi remains capped under 0.6400 as the clock ticks down to Wednesday’s RBNZ policy meeting and the Aussie continues to outshine its Antipodean counterpart (Aud/Nzd briefly above 1.0500 at one stage). However, the Pound looks more comfortable above 1.2900 vs the Greenback and around 0.8450 in Eur/Gbp cross terms following a raft of UK data including a firmer than forecast preliminary Q4 y/y GDP print. Cable stalled a whisker short of yesterday’s best and 1.2950, with attention now turning to BoE speakers from 12.30GMT.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY</strong> <strong>-</strong> All narrowly mixed against the Buck, as the single currency fends off more concerted attempts to breach 1.0900 and stays within striking distance of option expiries at 1.0915-20 in 1.2 bn, but lags the Franc that is still pivoting 0.9775 and holding above 1.0700 respectively amidst heightened German political uncertainty. Elsewhere, the Yen remains rangy just over 110.00 in holiday-thinned trade after Japan’s National Day and against a firmer Yuan (Cnh and Cny both maintaining 7.0000+ status vs the Usd).</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> More Lira underperformance on geopolitical jitters as the situation in Syria threatens to escalate further after reports that Turkey has increased military activity with Government forces retaliating. Usd/Try has advanced beyond 6.0440 in contrast to Usd/Zar staying well below 15.0000 even though SA manufacturing output fell far more than expected in December.</p><p>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/USD: <strong>1.0915-20 (1.2BLN), 1</strong>.1000-15 (900M), 1.1050-60 (700M)</p><p>Australian Home Loans (Dec) M/M 4.4% (Prev. 1.8%).

However, a deeper delve into the data, not to mention the fact that it was all dated sparked a short squeeze to an equally marginal new Liffe intraday high at 134.49, as Sterling hands back more knee-jerk gains amidst more hard-line Brexit remarks from EU’s Barnier and awaiting UK PM Johnson’s cabinet reshuffle.&nbsp;<strong>Bunds</strong>&nbsp;have also pared some losses from a 174.13 Eurex base and&nbsp;<strong>USTreasuries</strong>&nbsp;are holding off overnight troughs ahead of Fed chair Powell and JOLTS with the curve steeper even though 3 year note issuance looms.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Brent</strong>&nbsp;front-month futures are posting firm gains in early EU trade in a continuation of the sentiment-driven upside seen during the overnight session. WTI has just about reclaimed USD 50/bbl following yesterday’s sub-50 settlement whilst Brent hovers around the USD 54/bbl mark following yesterday’s settlement close to USD 53/bbl. On the OPEC+ front, Kazakhstan’s Energy Minister noted that the members would either meet in late February or early March to discuss further action – which does somewhat defer to earlier comments out of some OPEC+ members, with the Azeri Minister noting over the weekend that a February meeting was discussed but \"the situation was analysed and the meeting will be held in March as planned\", whilst Russian Energy Minister Novak attempted to bide his time to assess market impacts. ING notes that a March meeting “may concern many in the market as waiting too long to take action in the wake of the demand impact from the coronavirus.” For reference, sources noted the Russian Energy Minister said they will hold a meeting tomorrow with domestic oil producers to discuss the OPEC+ deal, which could add more meat on the bone regarding Russia’s next steps/thought process. Looking ahead to today’s session, the monthly EIA STEO will be released at 1700GMT with credence on global growth demand forecasts against the backdrop of the coronavirus. Thereafter, the weekly API private inventory report will be released – with forecasts for a headline crude build of 3mln barrels over the week. Tomorrow will see the release of the OPEC monthly report followed by the IEA oil report on Thursday. Elsewhere,&nbsp;<strong>spot gold</strong>&nbsp;trades lower with the yellow metal pressured by the overall risk appetite. Conversely,&nbsp;<strong>copper</strong>&nbsp;conformed to the risk tone and clambers back towards USD 2.6lb.</p><p><strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak says they will hold a meeting tomorrow with domestic oil producers to discuss the OPEC+ deal</strong>, according to Tass citing sources.

Subsequently, the pan-European Stoxx 600 hit fresh record highs whilst the bellwether Eurostoxx 50 reached levels last seen in 2008.&nbsp; France’s CAC (+0.3%) marginally lags regional peers with the index weighed down by Michelin (-2.8%) post-earnings after the group watered-down guidance in which it now expects the FY20 operating income to be “slightly down YY” whilst also acknowledging softness in passenger cars, light trucks and off-road tire markets. Sectors are all in positive territory and reflect risk appetite as cyclicals outpace defensives. In terms of individual movers, Daimler (+1.0%) shares remain resilient post-earnings despite a slash to its FY dividend -&nbsp; which was set at EUR 0.90/shr, down from the prior of EUR 3.25/shr and below the expected EUR 1.30/shr. Shares remain buoyed following comments from its CEO who noted that cost-cutting measures will be ramped out as part of its initiative, whilst the overall risk sentiment also aids the stock as DAX30 Mar’20 futures probe its contract high of 13639 (Note: Daimler has a 5.6% weighting in DAX30). Sticking with Germany, Deutsche Telekom (+4.1%) shares are bolstered amid source reports that the long-awaited T-Mobile (+8.8% pre-market) and Sprint (+64% pre-market) merger may get the green light from US district judge later today. Deutsche Telekom is T-Mobile’s majority shareholder with a holding of ~63%. On the flip side, NMC Health (-13.6%) received a double whammy despite opening with mild gains, initial downside stemmed on the back of a City regulator probe into the complex director share pledges at NMC after the Co. revealed that it was not apparent who actually controls its largest shareholdings. Thereafter, the second wave of downside arose from KKR has confirming that it has not made an offer regarding an offer for the Co, and adding that it does not intend to make an offer for NMC – which comes amid yesterday’s upside in the NMC shares amid sources noting that it is in talks with KKR regarding a potential deal valued at around GBP 2bln.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/NOK </strong>- Déjà vu for the Aussie and Norwegian Krona, but this time the former has rallied on domestic grounds rather than Chinese data to an extent at least, while the latter has extended post-CPI gains with the aid of a firm bounce in oil prices. Aud/Usd is back above 0.6700 and Eur/Nok has crossed 10.1000 to the downside in wake of an acceleration in Australian home loans and as crude rebounds ahead of API inventory updates, the official EIA data on Wednesday and Russia’s meeting with oil companies to discuss OPEC+ proposals for deeper output cuts.</p><p><strong>USD </strong>- Notwithstanding the ongoing outperformance noted above, and resilience in other G10 currencies, the Dollar is still appreciating steadily with the DXY nudging over another Fib resistance level before fading a fraction below the psychological 99.000 mark. Perhaps some reticence and caution ahead of Fed chair Powell part 1, but the index has carved out a marginally firmer 98.810-917 range and registered a fresh 2020 peak in the process.</p><p><strong>CAD/NZD/GBP </strong>- The aforementioned recovery in oil has cushioned the Loonie to a degree between 1.3289-1.3320 parameters, but the Kiwi remains capped under 0.6400 as the clock ticks down to Wednesday’s RBNZ policy meeting and the Aussie continues to outshine its Antipodean counterpart (Aud/Nzd briefly above 1.0500 at one stage). However, the Pound looks more comfortable above 1.2900 vs the Greenback and around 0.8450 in Eur/Gbp cross terms following a raft of UK data including a firmer than forecast preliminary Q4 y/y GDP print. Cable stalled a whisker short of yesterday’s best and 1.2950, with attention now turning to BoE speakers from 12.30GMT.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY </strong>- All narrowly mixed against the Buck, as the single currency fends off more concerted attempts to breach 1.0900 and stays within striking distance of option expiries at 1.0915-20 in 1.2 bn, but lags the Franc that is still pivoting 0.9775 and holding above 1.0700 respectively amidst heightened German political uncertainty. Elsewhere, the Yen remains rangy just over 110.00 in holiday-thinned trade after Japan’s National Day and against a firmer Yuan (Cnh and Cny both maintaining 7.0000+ status vs the Usd).</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- More Lira underperformance on geopolitical jitters as the situation in Syria threatens to escalate further after reports that Turkey has increased military activity with Government forces retaliating. Usd/Try has advanced beyond 6.0440 in contrast to Usd/Zar staying well below 15.0000 even though SA manufacturing output fell far more than expected in December.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> have staged an especially impressive recovery from post-GDP lows that saw the 10 year debt future fleeting loses the 134.00 handle and dip below last Friday’s low to 133.98. However, a deeper delve into the data, not to mention the fact that it was all dated sparked a short squeeze to an equally marginal new Liffe intraday high at 134.49, as Sterling hands back more knee-jerk gains amidst more hard-line Brexit remarks from EU’s Barnier and awaiting UK PM Johnson’s cabinet reshuffle. <strong>Bunds</strong> have also pared some losses from a 174.13 Eurex base and <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> are holding off overnight troughs ahead of Fed chair Powell and JOLTS with the curve steeper even though 3 year note issuance looms.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures are posting firm gains in early EU trade in a continuation of the sentiment-driven upside seen during the overnight session. WTI has just about reclaimed USD 50/bbl following yesterday’s sub-50 settlement whilst Brent hovers around the USD 54/bbl mark following yesterday’s settlement close to USD 53/bbl. On the OPEC+ front, Kazakhstan’s Energy Minister noted that the members would either meet in late February or early March to discuss further action – which does somewhat defer to earlier comments out of some OPEC+ members, with the Azeri Minister noting over the weekend that a February meeting was discussed but \"the situation was analysed and the meeting will be held in March as planned\", whilst Russian Energy Minister Novak attempted to bide his time to assess market impacts. ING notes that a March meeting “may concern many in the market as waiting too long to take action in the wake of the demand impact from the coronavirus.” For reference, sources noted the Russian Energy Minister said they will hold a meeting tomorrow with domestic oil producers to discuss the OPEC+ deal, which could add more meat on the bone regarding Russia’s next steps/thought process. Looking ahead to today’s session, the monthly EIA STEO will be released at 1700GMT with credence on global growth demand forecasts against the backdrop of the coronavirus. Thereafter, the weekly API private inventory report will be released – with forecasts for a headline crude build of 3mln barrels over the week. Tomorrow will see the release of the OPEC monthly report followed by the IEA oil report on Thursday. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> trades lower with the yellow metal pressured by the overall risk appetite. Conversely, <strong>copper</strong> conformed to the risk tone and clambers back towards USD 2.6lb.</p>",

The MPC has, however, kept the door open to &nbsp;lowering rates in the future, and announced a series of &nbsp;measures which could help it to lower rates in meetings &nbsp;ahead, Societe Generale's analysts say, including extending &nbsp;a restructuring scheme for loans to micro small and medium &nbsp;enterprises through to end-December from the current endMarch deadline; it will give relief for the cash reserve ratio to &nbsp;banks on loans; it has introduced long-term repo operations &nbsp;allowing banks to borrow for 1-year and 3-year maturities; &nbsp;these measures are intended to improve the monetary &nbsp;transmission through the rate and credit channels. SocGen &nbsp;says that although recently-presented budget failed to provide &nbsp;the desired impetus to growth. \"That, however, is the result of &nbsp; a weak revenue outlook rather than a major increase in &nbsp;desired expenditure, and thus, the onus is now clearly on the &nbsp;RBI to do the heavy lifting for the economy, though its efficacy &nbsp;remains questionable.\" SocGen argues that until inflation &nbsp;eases somewhat, the RBI should avoid cutting rates, although &nbsp;it will likely remain in accommodative mode to ensure &nbsp;improvement in credit intermediation in the economy, and the &nbsp;bank believes the RBI could eventually start to ease, possibly &nbsp;from end Q2 2020 onwards, and could well cut the policy rate &nbsp;twice (25bps each time) during FY 2021.</li></ul>",

Looking at price action in more detail, Bunds opened at 174.48 and high-ticked to 174.49 vs yesterday’s 174.57 close before drifting down to a 174.28 low before meeting buying interest and treading water into the EU cash bourse opens.</p>",

The greenback’s major counterparts were subdued in which <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> languished around 1.0915 where there is a notable option expiry for today’s New York cut and amid political uncertainty in Germany, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> remained uneventful with price action stuck near the 100-DMA of 1.2913.

Desks note the \"wash out\" of speculative shorts ahead of a duration heavy US Treasury issuance schedule for the week (3s, 10s, and 30s), additionally, with the majority of S&amp;P 500 constituents now out of their earnings blackout, further IG corporate supply can be expected. The T-Note found its lows in the overnight before the Western front came and brought it back to highs as equity futures drifted lower somewhat before the cash open. However, the equity complex turned positive not long after the open, coinciding with strength in the greenback, keeping the 10-year yield anchored around 1.56% for a short while before it continued to move lower through till settlement, taking it just beneath 1.55%; curve spreads were little changed, with the belly seeing a slightly larger bid than the short and long end.

Chinese markets are also higher despite the PBoC liquidity drain and continued rise in the casualties from the coronavirus in which the death toll has now surpassed 1000, although the pace of additional confirmed cases slowed from the prior day. Furthermore, Chinese President Xi announced China is to adopt more decisive measures to contain the spread of the virus and will speed up development of clinically effective drugs, while they will also make economic adjustments to mitigate the impact from the outbreak. As such, Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. are positive with the former buoyed by property names and with Geely Auto the front runner in Hong Kong as it explores a merger with its Volvo unit, while Japanese markets remained shut for National Day holiday.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is rangebound and has plateaued after the recent strong US jobs data, with further upside capped by resistance at its YTD highs around 98.88 ahead of today’s New Hampshire Democrat Primary and Fed Chair Powell’s testimony at Congress beginning on Wednesday. The greenback’s major counterparts are subdued with EUR/USD languishing around 1.0915 where there is a notable option expiry for today’s New York cut and amid political uncertainty in Germany after Chancellor Merkel’s heir apparent Kramp-Karrenbauer resigned as the head of the CDU party, while GBP/USD is uneventful with price action stuck near its 100-DMA of 1.2913. Elsewhere, USD/JPY has been lifted on the improved risk appetite despite the absence of Tokyo participants and antipodeans are mixed with AUD/USD outperforming to reclaim the 0.6700 handle after somewhat mixed data.</p>",
