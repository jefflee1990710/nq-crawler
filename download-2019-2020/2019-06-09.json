Financial names, including Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), were the laggards as yields fell. Tech surged, with the likes of Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) leading the pack. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) moved higher, also supported by pre-market stories that the tech giant is pushing the Trump administration to give it exemptions to the ban on exports to Huawei. Facebook (FB) participated in the rally despite news that it will no longer allow pre-installation of its apps on Huawei phones following the U.S. ban. T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) were also able to edge higher, in spite of news that more state attorneys were looking to probe the two companies proposed merger. Walmart (WMT) lagged the Consumer Staples sector, despite encouraging news this morning that the co are to expand and improve the speed of their delivery service as they look to close the gap with Amazon. Boeing (BA) moved higher with the market, seemingly unconcerned by the news that Qatari Airlines are seeking compensation over the 737 MAX grounding. CVS Health (CVS) struggled to hold onto any gains, as legal uncertainty, regarding the health co.’s recent acquisition of Aetna, looks set to continue into the summer. Caesar’s (CZR) spiked higher after the hotel chain rejected a bid from rival Eldorado Resorts (ERI) for being too low. Eldorado Resorts (ERI) also moved higher. Beyond Meat (BYND) skyrocketed after the meatless burger maker posted solid earnings, raised guidance and received a number of broker upgrades, including from JP Morgan, who raised their price target to USD 120. Tesla (TSLA) gained early as stocks rallied and was buoyed as Piper Jaffray maintained a high price target for the firm based on demand for its Model 3 car, albeit it did give these gains away. Altice (ATUS) fell after two private equity firms, who were major stakeholders in the co., announced a reduction in their stake. DocuSign Inc (DOCU) sunk despite reasonable earnings. Zoom Video (ZM) jumped after the co. reported better then expected earnings and guided higher, in its first earnings release since the co. went public. IBM (IBM) is cutting about 2,000 jobs in a round of layoffs this week as it works to reshape its business, WSJ reports, citing sources. FedEX (FDX) will not be renewing US domestic express contract with Amazon (AMZN). AT&amp;T (T) and Dish (DISH) reportedly are open to merging satellite TV businesses; both are not holding active talks, sources said. S&amp;P 500 +1.0% AT 2873, NASDAQ-100 +1.9% AT 7417, DOW JONES +1.0% AT 25983.</p><p>A disappointing NFP report saw the curve bull-steepen in an immediate response, as traders raised bets that the Fed will cut rates either in response to weakness in some gauges of economic activity, or in an “insurance” manner to extend the recovery. The probability of a June rate cut was up to around 22.5%, July rose to just under 90% (from around 70% on Thursday). Trump’s jawboning efforts resulted in some selling action in the afternoon, however, at settlement, major curve spreads were modestly narrower (2s30s was around 1bps lower, having been at 9bps wides after the payrolls data). US T-note futures (U9) settled 9 ticks higher at 127-07.</p>",
