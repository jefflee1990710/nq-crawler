Ross added that there is little point in making a deal with China if there are concerns about it being enforceable and that consumers have not taken a hit from China tariffs. There were also comments from Huawei that it opposes the US decision to add 46 more Huawei affiliates to the entity list and that the extension won't have a \"substantial impact\" on its business either way.

(Newswires)</p><p>UK diplomats across the EU are preparing for a government-wide no-deal Brexit dress rehearsal named \"Exercise Yellow Rehearse\", which reports suggested is the latest signal that a no-deal Brexit is seen as an increasingly likely outcome.

(Newswires)</p><p>ECB's Rehn said a large degree of monetary stimulus continues to be necessary to keep financial conditions favourable as well as support Euro area growth and domestic price pressures, while Rehn added the governing council is determined to act if the medium-term inflation outlook continues to fall short of the ECB's aim.

Rosengren also commented that he would want to react to global weakness if it slows down the domestic economy but doesn't see a need to take action at this point and that they have to be careful not to ease too much when we don’t have significant problems, while he added it is a good time to \"sit-back\" and look at the data. (Newswires)</p><p>There were initial reports that the White House is mulling a payroll tax cut to support the economy with discussions said to be still in early stages and no decision has been made whether to push for Congress to approve the reduction. However, it was later reported that White House officials stated cutting payroll taxes is not under consideration at this time. (Twitter)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>US stocks were higher with the constructive risk tone attributed to optimism on US/China after the Huawei license extension, while some also interpreted US policymakers’ weekend comments as positive. Chipmakers (MU, INTC, NVDA, QCOM, ADI) lead indices higher on Monday amid the US extending the Huawei reprieve; conversely, defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities were lagging sectors. Estee Lauder (EL) surged on the back of forecast beating earnings and guidance. Gold miners, such as Newmont Mining (NEM), suffered from flows out of gold. Aramark (ARMK) boosted on private equity stake disclosure. PG&amp;E (PCG) freefell after a bankruptcy judge decided in favour against two large creditor groups. DaVita (DVA) moved lower after details of a tender offer reveal a price below current trading valuation. Disney (DIS) had a late-session sell-off on reports of an ex-accountant turned whistle-blower revealing the co. had misstated its revenue for years. S&amp;P 500 1.2% AT 2924, NASDAQ-100 1.5% AT 7719, DOW JONES 1% AT 26136.</p><p>The Treasury curve started out the week on a steeper footing, with traders latching on to US comments from the weekend on China/Huawei. As US traders got to their desks, major spreads were between 1-2bps higher. There was also news, which came in post-settlement trade on Friday, where the Treasury is sounding out investors about a potential 50- or 100-year issuance. The Treasury in 2017 mulled similar moves, and the talk has been reignited after 30-year yields recently narrowed to record lows. Austria's recent 100-year supply was digested well by the market, highlighting the demand for longer-dated sovereign issues with higher yields. The TPLEX is also taking cues from EGBs; amid fears of secular stagnation and heightened trade risks, the recent dovish remarks from the ECB's Rehn calling for a September bazooka (underscored them today), combined with the notion of looser fiscal policy out of Germany to help cushion any economic downturn, has seen German debt sell-off. SocGen's strategists said that if momentum and liquidity exacerbated the decline in yields initially triggered by the new US tariffs, then the same technical reasons could equally contribute to a German stimulus/issuance driven rebound to less extreme levels. The bank notes that 10-year yields last mean reverted higher by 20bp in in April in July; from today’s levels, this would imply a rise to -0.47%, SocGen says. Meanwhile, there was little reaction to a hawkish set of comments from Fed’s Rosengren. The curve, however, gave back most of its steeper bias, and had mostly bear-flattened by settlement, though 5s30s and 10s30s were just under 1bps wider. US T-note futures settled 15+ ticks lower at 130-14.</p>",

However, not all risk assets were participating, notably in EMFX, which was mixed as the US arrived. Risk-on traders pointed to outflows from havens, however, USDJPY likely benefited from the US curve steepening in early trade as a result of Friday’s late news that the Treasury is mulling 50-/100-year issuance; meanwhile, although XAU has given up USD 1,500, it is not too far beneath the level. Also in FX, the Antipodes didn’t participate in the rally either, while CAD gave up earlier gains against the USD. Meanwhile, stock futures failed to build on the pre-market rally, and largely traversed side-ways once cash trade was underway. Traders have been pointing to events in the latter part of the week, notably Jackson Hole, as well as FOMC and ECB minutes this week, and PMI data releases for signs on how surveys are holding up.</p><p><strong>* HUAWEI:</strong> The Commerce Dept confirmed it would extend a reprieve given to Huawei, allowing the Chinese tech giant to continue purchasing supplies from US firms; the temporary general license will be extended for an additional 90 days, after the previous agreement ended on 19th August. Reports had suggested that Trump and Xi were to discuss the matter over the weekend, and the US President on Sunday said he did not want the US to do business with company, citing national security concerns; Trump did say there were small parts of Huawei's business that could be exempt from a broader ban, but that it would be \"very complicated.\" More broadly, Trump said talks with China have continued, but are not close to a conclusion. Earlier on Sunday, NEC Director Kudlow was more constructive, saying the extension of Huawei's reprieve would be a \"gesture of good faith.\" The first temporary general license was granted to minimise disruption for Huawei customers, many of which operate networks in rural America. The Trump Administration has recently watered-down other trade measures out of the fear it could disrupt holiday shopping, and analysts noted that today's measures could be a sign that the Trump Administration is acknowledging that the impacts of the trade war with China are starting to affect US consumers and businesses adversely.</p><p><strong>* PBOC:</strong> China's central bank announced interest rate reforms, where it abolished benchmark lending rates. The move was long-awaited, and analysts said it will likely lower rates used in most loans to the real economy. Capital Economics thinks it could be followed up with a rate cut (it says as soon as tomorrow), but the consultancy warns that the measures are still unlikely to clear roadblocks that have mitigated the effects of monetary easing measures. (<a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/analysis-pboc-unveils-rate-reform-refile-19-08-2019\">Click here for analysis</a>).</p><p><strong>* GERMAN STIMULUS:</strong> Germany's finance minister on the weekend said that the country has fiscal scope to counter any downturn, and suggested that the government could spend EUR 50bln (about 1.5% of GDP). Press reports have suggested Germany would be willing to increase debt in order to offset a tax revenue shortfall in a downturn. The German constitution currently allows net federal debt to increase by 0.35% of output if there is GDP growth - these rules are relaxed in a recession, allowing a slightly larger increase of debt. The reports follow data last week which showed Germany's economy contracted in Q2. However, like previous suggestions of fiscal stimulus, analysts note that a package is certainly not imminent, highlighting the time lag problem with fiscal policy; Danske Bank noted that it takes time for politicians to recognise the need for fiscal easing, and vote in favour of a specific package, and hence when it has an impact on real activity. With that said, the support of fiscal authorities gives hope that there would be a safety net mitigating some of the downside in the event of a recession, which will please analysts looking for Germany to provide fiscal support amid risks to aggregate demand.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA:</strong> US Vice President Pence said Beijing must respect the integrity of HK laws through the Sino-British joint declaration, in order for the US to make a trade deal with China. Note: Earlier, China Global Times Editor, often considered a proxy for the opinion of China itself, said &nbsp;\"the US flatters itself to link trade talks with Beijing's actions on Hong Kong. It makes more sense if China sets the US stopping interfering in Hong Kong affairs as a condition for trade talks. What Beijing should do on Hong Kong, Washington's attitude doesn't matter at all.\" Later, it was reported that both Facebook and Twitter had suspended accounts both claim were started by Chinese state actors, in an effort to sow seeds of discontent among Hong Kong protestors. At pixel time, the US Administration is yet to officially respond to the reports.</p><p><strong>* TRUMP: </strong>US President Trump delivered a familiar criticism of the Fed, arguing that the US economy is strong, despite Fed actions, and repeated his call for the central bank to cut rates by 100bps over a short time frame, and also called for a resumption of QE. Trump then took aim at Google (GOOG), citing reports that claim the tech giant reportedly manipulated between 2.6mln to 16mln of votes for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential Elections; Google fell in response.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> <strong>Rosengren</strong> (voter, hawk, dissenter) said the US economy was in a good spot, and the Fed must be careful not ease too much when we there are no significant problems. Rosengren warned of the costs to easing too much, including too much leverage. He noted that economic forecasters were not seeing much in the data. On yield curve inversion, Rosengren says the inversion is important, but reflects global weakness. Rosengren said he would react to global weakness if it hits the domestic economy, but says that he does not see a lot of need to take action at this point; the cure for that weakness should not rest solely on US. Rosengren intimated that he was in data-dependent mode, and was paying particular attention to the consumer data. He is also watching factors like Brexit, and Hong Kong.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> <strong>ECB's Rehn</strong> repeated his call for a large degree of monetary stimulus at the September ECB meeting, saying that it continues to be necessary. Rehn said that the ECB needed to keep financial conditions favourable, and to support Euro area growth and domestic price pressures. He added that the Governing Council was determined to act if the medium-term inflation outlook continued to fall short of its the ECB's goal.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> US conducted a flight test of a conventional ground-launched cruise missile off the west coast of the US Sunday, a missile test that would have been previously banned under the now defunct INF treaty which the US pulled out of earlier this month, CNN reported. A defence official said that the test missile exited its ground mobile launcher and impacted its target and that data collected from the test \"will inform our development of future intermediate-range capabilities.\" On the Iran front, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said it has warned the US against seizing its oil tanker (Grace 1) in open seas; coming after the US issued a warrant to seize the tanker which was just released by Gibraltar.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> UK will face shortages of fuel, food and medicine if it leaves the European Union without a transition deal, according to the Sunday Times, citing leaked documents; the report was contested by lawmakers. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that UK PM Johnson will next week visit Berlin and Paris for talks with Chancellor Merkel and President Macron, respectively. However, it is not immediately clear what measures the new PM will be able to take with him on how he intends to avoid a messy Brexit. Elsewhere, UK PM Johnson's spokesman said more work was required to prepare for Brexit; when asked about an early re-call of Parliament, the spokesperson said MP's voted for the current recess dates, and there can be no formal negotiation with the EU until the backstop is dropped.</p><p><strong>* BOE: </strong>Some unscheduled remarks from BOE Governor Carney, who said that at this stage, negative interest rates are not seen as an option in the UK, and he is not in favour of changing the 2% inflation target.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLED 15+ LOWER AT 130-14:</strong> The Treasury curve started out the week on a steeper footing, with traders latching on to US comments from the weekend on China/Huawei. As US traders got to their desks, major spreads were between 1-2bps higher. There was also news, which came in post-settlement trade on Friday, where the Treasury is sounding out investors about a potential 50- or 100-year issuance. The Treasury in 2017 mulled similar moves, and the talk has been reignited after 30-year yields recently narrowed to record lows. Austria's recent 100-year supply was digested well by the market, highlighting the demand for longer-dated sovereign issues with higher yields. The TPLEX is also taking cues from EGBs; amid fears of secular stagnation and heightened trade risks, the recent dovish remarks from the ECB's Rehn calling for a September bazooka (underscored them today), combined with the notion of looser fiscal policy out of Germany to help cushion any economic downturn, has seen German debt sell-off. SocGen's strategists said that if momentum and liquidity exacerbated the decline in yields initially triggered by the new US tariffs, then the same technical reasons could equally contribute to a German stimulus/issuance driven rebound to less extreme levels. The bank notes that 10-year yields last mean reverted higher by 20bp in in April in July; from today’s levels, this would imply a rise to -0.47%, SocGen says. Meanwhile, there was little reaction to a hawkish set of comments from Fed’s Rosengren. The curve, however, gave back most of its steeper bias, and had mostly bear-flattened by settlement, though 5s30s and 10s30s were just under 1bps wider.</p><p><strong>* CBRT:</strong> Turkey’s Central Bank tweaked the ratio and remuneration applied to required reserves, Reuters reported, with the intention of using reserve requirements more flexibly. For banks with 10-20% loan growth, the reserve requirement for Turkish lira liabilities will be set at 2%, it said, and raised the remuneration rate for lira-denominated required reserves to 15% from 13% for banks with 10-20% loan growth rate, and set it at 5% for other banks. Reuters added that the loan growth rate will be calculated in each reserve requirement period, and banks within the 10-20% rate will be subject to the related requirements for the following three months. The central bank estimates that its moves will provide TRY 4.4bln and USD 2.9bln of gold and FX liquidity, respectively.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLES USD 1.33 HIGHER AT USD 56.14/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLES USD 1.10 HIGHER AT USD 59.74/BBL: </strong>Energy prices are firmer to start the week, again taking their cues from general risk sentiment, but some geopolitical risk is also being attributed. The US extending the Huawei purchase reprieve, in addition to Germany expressing it would be fiscally supportive in a downturn, has eased some investor concerns and seen some flows into risk assets (which crude has recently been a good barometer of). Also providing tailwinds was the latest Yemen Houthi attacks on a Saudi Aramco facility, although production at the 1mln BPD facility was unaffected, the attacks caught oil participants’ attention however given that the Houthis had not been attacking the oil supply chain directly recently (previously attacks were mainly directed at airports). Looking ahead to the latest US energy inventory data, with the API reporting on Tuesday, current expectations have crude stocks -1.9mln bbls, gasoline +0.1mln, and distillates +0.6mln; Genscape sees Cushing stocks -1.68mln in the week through August 16th.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 1.2% AT 2924, NASDAQ-100 1.5% AT 7719, DOW JONES 1% AT 26136. S&amp;P 500 SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary 1.3%, Consumer Staples 0.9%, Energy 2.1%, Financials 1%, Health Care 1%, Industrials 1%, Information Technology 1.6%, Materials 0.8%, Telecommunication Services 1.4%, Utilities 0.7%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Chipmakers (MU, INTC, NVDA, QCOM, ADI) lead indices higher on Monday amid the US extending the Huawei reprieve; conversely, defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities were lagging sectors. Estee Lauder (EL) surged on the back of forecast beating earnings and guidance. Gold miners, such as Newmont Mining (NEM), suffered from flows out of gold. Aramark (ARMK) boosted on private equity stake disclosure. PG&amp;E (PCG) freefell after a bankruptcy judge decided in favour against two large creditor groups. DaVita (DVA) moved lower after details of a tender offer reveal a price below current trading valuation. Disney (DIS) had a late-session sell-off on reports of an ex-accountant turned whistle-blower revealing the co. had misstated its revenue for years.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>There was a mixed feel to FX trade. EMFX, a key gauge of risk sentiment, were not participating in the early ‘risk-on’, and ahead of RBA minutes overnight, the Antipodes could catch a bid either, while the CAD gave up gains against the USD (CPI and retail sales this week out of Canada). Havens were also giving a mixed read on risk: USDJPY was up, likely on the early steepening of the yield curve moving rate differentials in the buck’s favour; the CHF saw some sharp moves today (weaker), with the usual theories of SNB intervention cited; XAU relinquished the USD 1,500, but remains closely below it. It is difficult to read too much into GBP moves, since were are essentially flat on the day; Brexit news has revealed little that changes the dial too significantly, although there is some anticipation of Johnson’s visit to Berlin and Paris next week, and then a visit to Dublin in September. EUR is also essentially flat, the offshore CNH weakened to over 7.07 against the USD, while the DXY is firmer.&nbsp;</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The Treasury curve started out the week on a steeper footing, with traders latching on to US comments from the weekend on China/Huawei. As US traders got to their desks, major spreads were between 1-2bps higher. There was also news, which came in post-settlement trade on Friday, where the Treasury is sounding out investors about a potential 50- or 100-year issuance. The Treasury in 2017 mulled similar moves, and the talk has been reignited after 30-year yields recently narrowed to record lows. Austria's recent 100-year supply was digested well by the market, highlighting the demand for longer-dated sovereign issues with higher yields. The TPLEX is also taking cues from EGBs; amid fears of secular stagnation and heightened trade risks, the recent dovish remarks from the ECB's Rehn calling for a September bazooka (underscored them today), combined with the notion of looser fiscal policy out of Germany to help cushion any economic downturn, has seen German debt sell-off. SocGen's strategists said that if momentum and liquidity exacerbated the decline in yields initially triggered by the new US tariffs, then the same technical reasons could equally contribute to a German stimulus/issuance driven rebound to less extreme levels. The bank notes that 10-year yields last mean reverted higher by 20bp in in April in July; from today’s levels, this would imply a rise to -0.47%, SocGen says. Meanwhile, there was little reaction to a hawkish set of comments from Fed’s Rosengren. The curve, however, gave back most of its steeper bias, and had mostly bear-flattened by settlement, though 5s30s and 10s30s were just under 1bps wider.</p>",

The US extending the Huawei purchase reprieve, in addition to Germany expressing it would be fiscally supportive in a downturn, has eased some investor concerns and seen some flows into risk assets (which crude has recently been a good barometer of). Also providing tailwinds was the latest Yemen Houthi attacks on a Saudi Aramco facility, although production at the 1mln BPD facility was unaffected, the attacks caught oil participants’ attention however given that the Houthis had not been attacking the oil supply chain directly recently (previously attacks were mainly directed at airports). Looking ahead to the latest US energy inventory data, with the API reporting on Tuesday, current expectations have crude stocks -1.9mln bbls, gasoline +0.1mln, and distillates +0.6mln; Genscape sees Cushing stocks -1.68mln in the week through August 16th.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>The Franc and Yen are underperforming amidst an upturn in risk appetite, and with the former perhaps also wary about intervention after Swiss sight deposits rose in the week ending last Friday. Usd/Chf advanced to 0.9820 before fading and Usd/Jpy tested resistance around 106.70 amidst a higher, steeper UST yield curve after the Treasury announced plans to canvas market opinion abount ultra long end issuance again (50 or 100 year maturities) and Washington confirmed that it will extend Huawei’s temporary licence for 3 months. However, sentiment remains fragile/tentative across the board with <strong>GOLD</strong> still keeping close tabs on the Usd1500/oz level and EMs on the back foot again.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/NOK</strong></p><p>The Pound is broadly weaker ahead of UK PM Johnson’s visit to see his French and German counterparts, with no deal Brexit concerns stoked by a leaked Government document warning about shortages in food, medicines and fuel, while the opposition Labour Party is rallying support for a no confidence vote and GE that will include the option of a 2nd EU referendum. Cable has topped out ahead of 1.2200 and again, but holding above 1.2100 and Eur/Gbp is back up around 0.9150 vs just under 0.9100 late last week. Similarly, the Loonie has lost momentum around 1.3250 vs its US peer alongside crude prices, with Usd/Cad now edging closer to 1.3300 again, but the Norwegian Krona remains firm after bouncing relatively strongly off the psychological 10.0000 mark vs the Euro after the Norges Bank retained a tightening bias last Thursday, as Eur/Nok hovers around 9.9500.</p><p><strong>EUR/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed against the Greenback, as the <strong>DXY </strong>meanders above 98.000, with the single currency still pivoting 1.1100 amidst Italian political jitters and more German fiscal contingency plans in the event of recession. Meanwhile, the Aussie is just about shading it down under as Aud/Nzd straddles 1.0550 and Aud/Usd holds firmly above 0.6750 compared to Nzd/Usd near the lower end of a 0.6410-45 band.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Turkish Lira is back under pressure after more refinements to bank reserve requirements by the CBRT that are expected to result in a net Usd2.9 bn liquidity injection via FX and Gold, with Usd/Try up through last week’s highs and testing offers ahead of 5.6600 before waning. Meanwhile, the Rouble failed to derive traction from oil amidst mostly disappointing Russian data as retail sales and unemployment were weaker than forecast and/or previously and offset more encouraging real wages – Usd/Rub briefly popped above 67.0000 in response. However, Argentina’s public and market holiday has protected the Ars from fallout after 3 ratings downgrades and Presidential Candidate Fernando casting doubt over IMF loan repayments.</p>",

The central bank estimates that its moves will provide TRY 4.4bln and USD 2.9bln of gold and FX liquidity, respectively.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: PBoC unveils rate reform [Refile]",
        "content": "<p><strong>*LONG STORY SHORT</strong>: The Chinese Central Bank has announced a new interest rate reform plan which will make the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) the new Benchmark Reference Rate to be used by banks for lending. This is aimed at supporting funding as well as lower borrowing costs for small businesses. The offer rate will be set on the 20th of every month (effective from tomorrow) and linked to the Medium-term Lending Facility rate (MLF).</p><p><strong>*IMPLICATIONS</strong>: Analysts note that the move is essentially a back-door rate cut, as some desks expect the first tranche to be lower than the current rate (1yr LPR now 4.31% vs. the 4.35% Benchmark Rate). PBoC advisor Ma Jun stated that pegging the LPR to the MFL “should establish a relatively smooth policy transmission mechanism”. The move comes as no major surprise given the State Council’s recent pledge that the country will rely on market-based reform measures to aid in lowering real interest rates for companies. Others believe that pegging the LPR to OMO rates could be a process towards a “Fed style” policy.</p><p><strong>*YUAN</strong>: Analysts do not expect the new reform to have much impact on USDCNY as it is still guided by the PBoC’s daily fixing. Thus, ING maintained its forecast of USDCNY at 7.10 by year-end.</p><p><strong>*BANKS</strong>: Most Chinese banks currently refer to the Benchmark Lending Rate when offering loans, which rarely changes. Hence, even when market rates decline, domestic borrowers do not get lower rates. The reform will impact banks as follows:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Banks will face narrower NIMs as they will need to quote a more market-based interest rate, thus competition on loans will increase.</li><li>Deposit rates will be indirectly effected as loan demand and other liquidity factors will be reflected in each banks’ deposit rate under a more market-based system.</li></ul>",

Sectors are all in the green with underperformance seen in some defensive sectors amid the overall risk appetite. Meanwhile, material and energy names outperform amid price action in the base metal and oil complexes; while the European Banking Index has experienced a turnaround from last weeks poor performance as reports around the size of potential fiscal stimulus for Germany (USD 55bln according to Finance Minister Scholz) have provided the first figures to the possible package. As such, the likes of Deutsche Bank (+2.5%) and Commerzbank (+2.4%) are notably firmer this morning. Looking at individual movers, Bpost (-1.5%) shares fell towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 as its CEO is to reportedly step down in 2020. At the other end of the index, CNH Industrial (+3.2%) rose amid a broker upgrade at Morgan Stanley. Finally, BASF (+1.5%) is among the top DAX performers as its CEO reaffirmed the Co’s intent to steadily increase dividend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL) Q2 19 (USD): adj. EPS 0.64 (exp. 0.52), Revenue 3.59bln (exp. 3.52bln)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY -</strong> The Dollar remains firm vs most G10 counterparts and EM currencies, but the index has lost some momentum after reaching 98.341 on Friday and has eased back towards 98.000 within a 98.242-134 range. In truth, trade has been rather muted overall at the start of a week that is relatively light on data/events until Wednesday when FOMC minutes are due and are followed by preliminary PMIs, ECB minutes and the Jackson Hole Symposium.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP/NZD/SEK -</strong> The major ‘underperformers’ as the Yen extends is retreat from recent lows to 106.65 and close to Fib resistance ahead of DMAs either side of 107.00 amidst a further rebound in US Treasury yields and Japanese trade data showing shallower than forecast declines in both imports and exports. Meanwhile, UK political/no deal Brexit jitters have scuppered Sterling’s revival on the back of last week’s better than expected run of data, with Cable slipping back towards 1.2100 and Eur/Gbp back up over 0.9150 vs sub-0.9100 at one stage. Note, comments from BoE Governor playing down NIRP and any change in the 2% inflation target have not really impacted, though Gilts and 3 month futures are weaker and the curve is steeper. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is lagging down under after recent downbeat NZ macro releases, like the sub-50 manufacturing PMI, with Nzd/Usd hovering just above 0.6400 and AUD/Nzd firm within a 1.0550-70 range as Aud/Usd holds up better between 0.6800-70 parameters. Back to the cross, MS advocates a long position around current levels for 1.1100 and with a 1.0280 stop based on diverging RBNZ/RBA policy outlooks in wake of the latest Aussie jobs report that revealed a bigger rise in headline payrolls and mostly due to full-time hiring. Similarly, the Sek is struggling to keep pace with its Scandi peer on relative Riksbank vs Norges Bank rate guidance and with the Nok also propped up by firm oil prices. Indeed, Eur/Sek is hovering around 10.7400 whereas Eur/Nok has pulled back from circa 10.0000.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD -</strong> The single currency is also benefiting from a retracement in Eurozone debt yields amidst more German Government reports about fiscal spending to offset recession, and as the Bundesbank warns that the economy may have shrunk further through the summer. Hence, Eur/Usd is resilient either side of 1.1100 even though final Eurozone CPI was revised a bit lower and ECB’s Muller expresses concern about inflation being too soft, with a decision about more stimulus likely to come next month. As noted above, crude has firmed up again and the Loonie is also drawing some support as Usd/Cad sits closer to the base of a tight 1.3277-57 band.</p><p>EM - Broad losses vs the Greenback, but the Argentine Peso may be in for additional investor angst given a double dose of credit rating punishment from S&amp;P and Fitch late on Friday. Note, Usd/Ars closed at 54.8340.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Bonds have retreated further, and with losses accelerated through short-term support before last Friday’s intraday lows gave way to spark another bout of stop-sales/long liquidation. Bunds hit 177.84, Gilts 133.99 and 10 year US Treasuries 130-09+, but all benchmarks have subsequently found a base, for now at least. However, curves remain steeper and retracement from August 15 contract peaks is still dominating price action as risk sentiment stabilises and selling upticks rather than buying dips emerges as the new mantra. Ahead, no US data on the slate but Fed’s Rosengren is due to speak later in the session.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>The energy complex is currently benefitting from the overall risk appetite</strong> in the market which sees WTI futures above the 55/bbl mark whilst Brent futures remain north of 59/bbl. Prices may also be deriving some support from reports of a drone attack at Saudi’s 1mln BPD Shaybah oilfield, albeit the fire was extinguished at a gas processing plant and there has been no reported impact on production. Looking at the complex from a technical perspective, WTI sees a golden cross forming with its 200 and 50 DMAs both around 56.15. Elsewhere<strong>, gold prices</strong> are subdued amid the overall risk appetite with the yellow metal back at the 1500/oz level, session low of USD 1497/oz thus far. Meanwhile, the risk tone has provided supported to<strong> copper prices</strong> as the red metal reclaims 2.60/lb to the upside.</p><p>Houthi rebels conducted a drone attack on oil and gas facilities at Saudi Arabia’s 1mln BPD Shaybah field although they failed to disrupt production.

        "content": "<ul><li>Nomura quants note that while US and global equities rebounded at the end of last week, its gauge to capture the global stock market sentiment remains in negative (risk-averse) territory, but has improved slightly, contracting slightly from -7.5 on 15th August to -5.5 on 16th August. \"Sentiment has managed to avoid the 'panic zone' of two standard deviations below the mean, but there is no clear recovery in investor sentiment, with sentiment continuing to bounce back and forth in a range of one to two standard deviations below the mean.\"</li><li>By region, Nomura notes the improvement in US and China equity market sentiment, but euro area equity market sentiment has deteriorated, and the fragility of equity supply demand conditions in this area is particularly noteworthy.</li><li>Nomura says macro funds US equity dip-buying. \"We believe that an end to the global economic recession trades currently brewing in the market will require trading on positive surprises, namely on expectations for (1) the withdrawal of the fourth round of tariffs on Chinese goods or the US and China concluding a trade agreement, (2) an emergency rate cut by the Fed of the order of 50-100bp (or an implicit promise to make such a cut in September), or (3) a coordinated fiscal response. The stock market rallies at the end of last week look to have been somewhat motivated by factors (2) and (3) and look to have been macro-driven.\"</li><li>Looking at trends among the various speculative players, Nomura notes that top-down global macro HFs remained bullish on US equities; while the majority of hedge funds are increasingly cautious, global macro HFs have bucked this trend by continuing to focus on dip-buying. \"We estimate that global macro hedge funds added to their long positions in US equities and closed out some long positions on US bonds (possibly unwinding some flatteners) towards the end of last week,\" Nomura writes, \"we surmise that that some ultra-short-term investors already leaning toward short positions got squeezed out in the market rally.\"</li><li>Nomura says that it is worth noting that global equity markets are in a bit of a nervous phase in which rises and declines can be quite conspicuous, with a seasonal decline in liquidity also coming into the equation. \"However, the over-arching situation is that the market jitters resulting from a negative spread between 2-year and 10-year US Treasury yields and signs of economic slowdown in major areas outside of the US are yet to be resolved, and evidence of such can be seen in a slight shift in preference from cyclicals to defensives by long-short funds, and larger short positions in Nikkei 225 futures, Hong Kong Hang Seng futures, and German DAX futures at trend-following CTAs.\" Even assuming that CTAs are swayed to some degree by daily market fluctuations, Nomura believes they have been continuing their net selling of equity futures in major regions. \"Trend-following players appear to be waiting to sell the rally as it develops.\"</li><li>With regards to US equity futures, Nomura says CTAs have been slowly longs in S&amp;P 500 futures. \"CTAs have tended to exit long positions at S&amp;P 500 levels below 2,960, although we note that only 58% of such positions have been culled from the most recent peak (on 16 July).\" The bank says that CTAs continue to unwind their longs at NASDAQ 100 levels below 7,720, again noting that 55% of NASDAQ 100 future long positions have been culled from the most recent peak (on 11th July). Meanwhile, CTAs have been building up Russell 2000 future shorts since 2 August; the breakeven-level of existing short positions would appear to be somewhere in the vicinity of 1,515, Nomura says.</li></ul>",

Sectors are all in the green with underperformance seen in some defensive sectors amid the overall risk appetite. Meanwhile, material and energy names outperform amid price action in the base metal and oil complexes; while the European Banking Index has experienced a turnaround from last weeks poor performance as reports around the size of potential fiscal stimulus for Germany (USD 55bln according to Finance Minister Scholz) have provided the first figures to the possible package. As such, the likes of Deutsche Bank (+2.5%) and Commerzbank (+2.4%) are notably firmer this morning. Looking at individual movers, Bpost (-1.5%) shares fell towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 as its CEO is to reportedly step down in 2020. At the other end of the index, CNH Industrial (+3.2%) rose amid a broker upgrade at Morgan Stanley. Finally, BASF (+1.5%) is among the top DAX performers as its CEO reaffirmed the Co’s intent to steadily increase dividend.&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>DXY - The Dollar remains firm vs most G10 counterparts and EM currencies, but the index has lost some momentum after reaching 98.341 on Friday and has eased back towards 98.000 within a 98.242-134 range. In truth, trade has been rather muted overall at the start of a week that is relatively light on data/events until Wednesday when FOMC minutes are due and are followed by preliminary PMIs, ECB minutes and the Jackson Hole Symposium.</p><p>JPY/GBP/NZD/SEK - The major ‘underperformers’ as the Yen extends is retreat from recent lows to 106.65 and close to Fib resistance ahead of DMAs either side of 107.00 amidst a further rebound in US Treasury yields and Japanese trade data showing shallower than forecast declines in both imports and exports. Meanwhile, UK political/no deal Brexit jitters have scuppered Sterling’s revival on the back of last week’s better than expected run of data, with Cable slipping back towards 1.2100 and Eur/Gbp back up over 0.9150 vs sub-0.9100 at one stage. Note, comments from BoE Governor playing down NIRP and any change in the 2% inflation target have not really impacted, though Gilts and 3 month futures are weaker and the curve is steeper. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is lagging down under after recent downbeat NZ macro releases, like the sub-50 manufacturing PMI, with Nzd/Usd hovering just above 0.6400 and AUD/Nzd firm within a 1.0550-70 range as Aud/Usd holds up better between 0.6800-70 parameters. Back to the cross, MS advocates a long position around current levels for 1.1100 and with a 1.0280 stop based on diverging RBNZ/RBA policy outlooks in wake of the latest Aussie jobs report that revealed a bigger rise in headline payrolls and mostly due to full-time hiring. Similarly, the Sek is struggling to keep pace with its Scandi peer on relative Riksbank vs Norges Bank rate guidance and with the Nok also propped up by firm oil prices. Indeed, Eur/Sek is hovering around 10.7400 whereas Eur/Nok has pulled back from circa 10.0000.</p><p>EUR/CAD - The single currency is also benefiting from a retracement in Eurozone debt yields amidst more German Government reports about fiscal spending to offset recession, and as the Bundesbank warns that the economy may have shrunk further through the summer. Hence, Eur/Usd is resilient either side of 1.1100 even though final Eurozone CPI was revised a bit lower and ECB’s Muller expresses concern about inflation being too soft, with a decision about more stimulus likely to come next month. As noted above, crude has firmed up again and the Loonie is also drawing some support as Usd/Cad sits closer to the base of a tight 1.3277-57 band.</p><p>EM - Broad losses vs the Greenback, but the Argentine Peso may be in for additional investor angst given a double dose of credit rating punishment from S&amp;P and Fitch late on Friday. Note, Usd/Ars closed at 54.8340.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Bonds have retreated further, and with losses accelerated through short-term support before last Friday’s intraday lows gave way to spark another bout of stop-sales/long liquidation. Bunds hit 177.84, Gilts 133.99 and 10 year US Treasuries 130-09+, but all benchmarks have subsequently found a base, for now at least. However, curves remain steeper and retracement from August 15 contract peaks is still dominating price action as risk sentiment stabilises and selling upticks rather than buying dips emerges as the new mantra. Ahead, no US data on the slate but Fed’s Rosengren is due to speak later in the session.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>The energy complex is currently benefitting from the overall risk appetite</strong> in the market which sees WTI futures above the 55/bbl mark whilst Brent futures remain north of 59/bbl. Prices may also be deriving some support from reports of a drone attack at Saudi’s 1mln BPD Shaybah oilfield, albeit the fire was extinguished at a gas processing plant and there has been no reported impact on production. Looking at the complex from a technical perspective, WTI sees a golden cross forming with its 200 and 50 DMAs both around 56.15. Elsewhere<strong>, gold prices</strong> are subdued amid the overall risk appetite with the yellow metal back at the 1500/oz level, session low of USD 1497/oz thus far. Meanwhile, the risk tone has provided supported to<strong> copper prices</strong> as the red metal reclaims 2.60/lb to the upside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

In terms of the latest relevant headlines, UK Brexit Minister Barclay signed an order to repeal the 1972 Brussels Act which will end all EU law in the UK effective on October 31st and it was separately reported that the government’s leaked no-deal preparation documents suggested a risk of shortages of fuel, food and medicine, as well as a 3-month meltdown at ports and a hard border with Ireland, were among the reasonable scenarios in the event of a no-deal.

(Axios)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>On Friday, there was a steepening bias amid risk-on trade, extending Thursday’s steepening, as hints of fiscal stimulus and positive noises from US President Trump on trade helped yields rise after the stellar rally this week, which has seen US 10-year yields fall below 1.60%, and the long-end fall sub 2.0% (though the latter is above that mark at settlement on Friday). This week, the yield curve may refocus on more Fed-speak, with FOMC minutes and Jackson Hole on the slate. US T-note futures settled 1 tick lower at 130-29+.</p><p><strong>Fed’s Mester (non-voter, hawk) </strong>said she would have preferred to hold US rates constant in July, but it was a close call and that the salient question is whether to cut rates or keep them steady. Mester added she can see scenarios where rates are steady or move lower and that US economic risks are weighted to the downside, while she also stated that sometimes holding pat on rates is tightening policy and suggested a need to take time to assess economic conditions then move policy as appropriate. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Kashkari (non-voter, dove)</strong> said signals from the economy are mixed right now and businesses are spooked by the trade wars. Kashkari added that a recession is not his base case scenario though risks have risen a bit, while he suggested the Fed needs to pull-back on rates and probably needs to provide more support to the economy.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher across the board following last Friday’s firm gains on Wall Street as composure returns to the market after the recent tumultuous trade. ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) are positive with tech and energy sectors front running the advances and firm gains seen in the likes of Beach Energy and Lend Lease post-earnings despite the latter actually reporting a decline in profits Y/Y, as it stressed the strong position of its core business and confirmed several parties are conducting due diligence on its engineering unit. Furthermore, Tokyo sentiment also found relief from the latest Japanese trade figures which showed Exports and Imports continued to contract, albeit at a slower pace than what the market feared. Hang Seng (+1.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.1%) conform to the positive tone after the PBoC continued its liquidity efforts and announced interest rate reforms in which it will make the new Loan Prime Rate the benchmark rate for bank loans aimed at lowering borrowing costs for businesses. Hong Kong is the outperformer despite the continuation of mass protests over the weekend which were of a peaceful nature, while participants also await the US decision on Huawei as reports suggested the Trump administration will grant Huawei an additional 90-day extension on a licence which allows the Chinese tech firm to conduct some business with US customers.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY holds near last week’s best levels with price action rangebound ahead of this week’s FOMC Minutes and the Jackson Hole Symposium. The greenback’s major counterparts are uneventful after EUR/USD failed to hold on to the 1.1100 handle and with GBP/USD steady near 1.2150 following last week’s recovery amid hopes by MPs to collaborate on averting a no-deal Brexit. In terms of the latest relevant headlines, UK Brexit Minister Barclay signed an order to repeal the 1972 Brussels Act which will end all EU law in the UK effective on October 31st and it was also reported that the government’s leaked no-deal preparation documents suggested a risk of shortages of fuel, food and medicine, as well as a 3-month meltdown at ports and a hard border with Ireland were among the reasonable scenarios in the event of a no-deal. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY crosses are little changed, while antipodeans are lacklustre and fail to benefit from the broad positive risk tone.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are slightly lower amid the heightened risk appetite but with downside also stemmed by the BoJ’s presence in the market for a total JPY 760bln in 1yr-5yr JGBs.</p>",
