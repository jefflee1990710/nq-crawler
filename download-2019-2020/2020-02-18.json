Major Asian equity bourses were in the red, as were European indices as US players returned after the President's Day holiday, while the Treasury curve had bull-flattened, and major crude benchmarks had shed over a buck; haven FX was more tempered, though gold was firmer (perhaps the notable outperformer of the day, topping USD 1,600, and eyeing January high around 1,611). The NY Fed manufacturing survey was much better than expected, which did help add some positivity to sentiment, though is ultimately not very representative of the US manufacturing sector; Canada manufacturing data, by contrast, was grim. In later trade, the Nasdaq 100 turned positive (where AAPL holds a 12% weighting), perhaps suggesting that investors are already beginning to look beyond the AAPL story; crude also pared back sharp losses to end the session approximately flat.</p><p><strong>* APPLE (AAPL):</strong> The technology giant Monday announced it was no longer expecting to meet revenue guidance for the March quarter as a result of the coronavirus, which has impacted Chinese demand and disrupted supply chains. Desks are mixed in their views of the implications of the news: Piper Sandler &amp; Baird suggested buying on weakness, JPMorgan urges long-term shareholders to look past the “temporary headwinds”, and Citi highlighted that demand outside of China was still strong and the outlook is promising with the upcoming 5G cycle, and thus maintained its buy rating. Elsewhere, Wedbush said this news was unexpected and clearly worse than feared given the timing of the release. Barclays cut its PT to USD 297 from USD 304, although noted the announcement was not unexpected, but highlighted a risk the tech giant is too exposed to China. Whereas, Morgan Stanley adjusted its shorter-term expectations, but its FY expectations remain unchanged. The story also weighed on Apple suppliers (SWKS, QCOM, MCHP, MU), and many semiconductors traded in the red, including Intel (INTC), which resulted in the Dow underperforming.</p><p><strong>* US EMPIRE MANUFACTURING: </strong>It was an upside surprise for the Empire Manufacturing Survey, printing 12.9 (against an expected 5.00 and a prior 4.8), the highest since May 2019, and as BMO notes, the biggest beat when compared to the survey forecast since March 2018. \"Elements of the details were quite solid, particularly new orders (strongest since Sep 2017) and shipments (highest since Nov 2018),\" BMO writes, though says that the sustainability of these developments will be a key question in calibrating any factory resilience in Q1; however, all being equal, this should help keep the FOMC on hold for a bit longer and moderate near-term cut calls, the bank writes.</p><p><strong>* FED MINUTES PREVIEW: </strong>The FOMC meeting minutes are unlikely to reveal much by way of new information, and will likely reiterate the points made within the post-meeting statement, post-meeting press conference with Chair Powell, as well as Powell’s views expressed in his recent dual-testimonies to lawmakers. The Fed is monitoring the impact of the coronavirus, and there will be a great deal of attention on any commentary around this theme, given tech-giant Apple recently cut guidance due to the outbreak; the Fed is likely to reiterate that it would need a substantial shift from its baseline for it to tweak policy settings. Additionally, traders will be eyeing any commentary that gives insights into the course for the Fed’s repo operations, as well as any commentary on the upcoming policy review. Minutes will be released at 1900 GMT/1400 ET on 19th February 2020.

Canadian bank RBC notes that manufacturing continues to be dragged on by temporary factors, but even so, underlying trends have been soft. \"The outlook is being clouded once again by concerns about the impact on global industrial chains from the novel coronavirus outbreak and, in Canada, another round of disruptions to rail transportation via the ongoing blockade of main rail lines, particularly in eastern Canada,\" RBC writes, \"we continue to expect overall Canadian economic growth will remain on the soft side in early 2020 after little or no growth in the last quarter of 2019.\"</p><p><strong>* RBA MINUTES: </strong>There wasn't anything particularly new revealed in the RBA's recent meeting minutes. The Board mulled lowering the cash rate due to the only gradual progress towards the Bank's inflation and unemployment goals, though the Board recognised that the incremental benefits of further interest rate reductions needed to be weighed against the risks associated with very low interest rates, concluding that rates should be held steady, and that it was reasonable to expect an extended period of low interest rates to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target. It also reiterated that it would continue monitoring developments including in the labour market, and was prepared to ease policy if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time. RBC's analysts said it was clear that the central bank's easing bias was firmly intact, though it thinks the hurdle to cut rates further has lifted amid a central bank that currently sees greater costs from further cuts than benefits.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLED USD 0.03 LOWER AT USD 52.29/BBL; BRENT SETTLED USD 0.08 HIGHER AT USD 57.75/BBL. </strong>Crude benchmarks are lower, having pared back a deeper loss, with desks once again examining the demand impact of the coronavirus; concerns have been amplified after tech giant Apple's warnings Monday. Additionally, desks were noting the restart of production in the Saudi/Kuwait neutral zone (500k BPD has been shuttered since 2015) was not helping. UBS notes, however, that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have consistently been among the most supportive of OPEC+ production cuts, and the bank expects any ramp-up in production from the neutral zone to be managed in accordance with commitments to the supply curb agreement. The downside also coincided with familiar remarks from Russia, that talks are ongoing regarding their position on the OPEC+ deal, whilst noting the March 6th OPEC+ meeting will go ahead as planned. WTI and Brent found lows at 50.88 and 60.93, respectively. Once lows were hit, the benchmarks saw a turnaround amid comments from Iran’s Energy Minister Zanganeh who noted that some oil projects have come to a halt due to a lack of funding. This week’s inventory expectations (bbls): Crude +3.8mln, Distillates -1.7mln, Gasoline +0.5mln.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 131-06+: </strong>The Treasury curve bull-flattened as Apple's revenue warning on Monday spooked risk. The 2s10s curve narrowed to a 14-handle, the lowest since November 2019; yields on 30s briefly fell sub-2.00%, while yields on 10s fell slightly below 1.54%. Traders also cited a weak ZEW report out of Germany in the morning (first post-Coronavirus survey).</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS:</strong> SPX -0.29% at 3370, NDX +0.06% at 9630, DJI -0.56% at 29,232. <strong>Sectors</strong>: Financials -0.88%, Energy -0.83%, Industrials -0.56%, Consumer staples -0.4%, Health Care -0.37%. Tech -0.35%, Materials -0.23%, Real Estate -0.15%, Consumer Disc. +0.08%, Communication +0.4%, Utilities +0.8%</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Walmart (WMT) saw choppy trade in wake of its earnings, initially the retail giant traded in the red following EPS &amp; revenue misses, whilst also same store sales also disappointed. However, the weakness was due to the protests in Chile and as well as a legal matter affecting Sam’s club. On the coronavirus, WMT stated it will continue to monitor the outlook, but it is not lowering its sales forecast this year as a result of nCoV at this time. Leidos (LDOS) and Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) were firmer following earnings, whereas Vulcan Materials (VMC), and Allegion (ALLE) were hit.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Semiconductors took a hit from a Monday report that the Trump administration is weighing new trade restrictions on China that would limit the use of American chip-making equipment, as it seeks to cut off Chinese access to key semiconductor technology. Elsewhere, Samsung (SSNLF, 005930 KS) reportedly won a 5-nm chip manufacturing deal with Qualcomm (QCOM) for 5G X60 modem chip, according to source reports. AMD (AMD) traded higher today with desks citing high call activity. Tesla (TSLA) rose over 6% as bear Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley increased his bull case for the automaker to USD 1200/shr (prev. USD 650, Friday’s close USD 800), the analyst also increased his base case to USD 500/shr from USD 360, while reiterating his underweight stance. Bernstein also increased its PT to USD 730 from USD 325, noting TSLA “is the ultimate possibility stock” and it could be argued it is “not unprecedentedly expensive”. Kroger (KR) and Biogen (BIIB) were bid as Berkshire Hathaway disclosed the two new companies as new additions in its 13-F. Conagra Brands (CAG) were hit after it cut its outlook after poor Q3 performance. Franklin Resources (BEN) performed well on the announcement it is to acquire its rival Legg Mason (LM) for USD 50/shr (Friday closing price: USD 40.72), in fitting with WSJ source reports this morning. BEN will assume USD 2bln of LM’s outstanding debt and the deal will see BEN as one of the largest independent, specialised global investment managers with a combined USD 1.5trln in AUM.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The Dollar continues its march upwards, with weak German ZEW data adding to the haven-bid in early trade; EUR hit fresh multi-year lows sub-1.07 as the slide continues; both the offshore and onshore yuans are trading back above 7.00 - desks have cited a report which suggests watching the correlation between oil and the yuan for clues about how the coronavirus fears are playing out, with the theory that if virus fears ease, China would pare back stimulus, lending to yuan upside, while crude would likely bounce on hopes of a demand recovery. Gold managed to bust through 1,600, just short of YTD highs, after a risk-off feel to trade, although haven FX's gains were more modest. Unsurprisingly, risk-sensitive FX (AUD, NZD, SEK) were lower, with the AUD also weighed by dovish RBA minutes. EMFX also took its cue from the broader risk tone, trading lower. GBP is flat, supported by EUR weakness and a decent labour market headline, though the internals left much to be desired, while desks are also noting Brexit risk is rising amid contentious negotiations with the EU. CAD felt the combo of USD strength and a grim factory report.</p><p><strong>* USD, EUR: </strong>The Dollar index continued its march higher amid risk-off trading conditions. SocGen's strategists noted that option traders have thrown in the towel following the slide in EURUSD spot, with EUR puts now trading at a premium over calls from 1-week to 6-months out. SocGen also notes that the correlation of 0.86 between spot and risk-reversals is the highest since mid-November, a level which in the past typically has been followed by reversals in spot. The bank adds, however, that risk-reversals and oversold technicals (the RSI at 24) is a red flag, and a mean-reverting bounce could be imminent, though it still does not compel the bank to abandon its bearish view, noting that although recent moves have been sizeable, a EURUSD fall sub-1.08 towards 1.0735 remains eminently possible until the full scale of the corona-led slowdown in China becomes clear.</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>UK jobs data saw a decent headline, though wage growth metrics disappointed. Traders continued to cite Brexit risk;<strong> </strong>Brexit negotiator Frost Monday pushed-back on EU demands for a 'level playing field', and threatened to walk away from negotiations if the EU did not drop its demand for the UK to follow its rules post-Brexit. Frost's punchy remarks followed comments made by the French foreign minister over the weekend, who said the UK and EU would 'rip each other apart' in trade negotiations – a reminder of that theme was provided in late trade, with reports suggesting that EU nations were readying tougher conditions to attach to any FTA with the UK. GBP drifted sub-1.30 against the USD, and almost fell to 0.8275 against the EUR, though ultimately the EUR's weakness helped the GBP recover, while the 1.30 figure has been retained against the buck.</p><p><strong>* AUD: </strong>The Aussie traded lower after minute revealed that the RBA had mulled rate cuts at its recent policy meeting, though concerns about household borrowing persuaded the central bank to stand pat. Fragile risk sentiment was also a factor after Apple's China warning, which was also echoed in the RBA's minutes, which said the outbreak would dampen exports through H1 2020.</p><p><strong>* KRW: </strong>After the Philippine and Thai central banks cut rates earlier in the month, there may be signs that South Korea will follow. Overnight, South Korea declared an economic emergency, and President Moon said the government must make every effort to protect the economy; traders interpreted Moon's remarks as a call on the BOK to ease policy to cushion against the fallout of the virus, like other regional counterparts.</p>",

Additionally, desks were noting the restart of production in the Saudi/Kuwait neutral zone (500k BPD has been shuttered since 2015) was not helping. UBS notes, however, that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have consistently been among the most supportive of OPEC+ production cuts, and the bank expects any ramp-up in production from the neutral zone to be managed in accordance with commitments to the supply curb agreement. The downside also coincided with familiar remarks from Russia, that talks are ongoing regarding their position on the OPEC+ deal, whilst noting the March 6th OPEC+ meeting will go ahead as planned. WTI and Brent found lows at 50.88 and 60.93, respectively. Once lows were hit, the benchmarks saw a turnaround amid comments from Iran’s Energy Minister Zanganeh who noted that some oil projects have come to a halt due to a lack of funding. This week’s inventory expectations (bbls): Crude +3.8mln, Distillates -1.7mln, Gasoline +0.5mln.</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Euro enters race to the base, but Kiwi now the major laggard",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>After another relatively brief interlude, fresh gains for the broad Dollar pushed the <strong>DXY</strong> further above 99.000 to a new ytd high of 99.480 and closer to the 2019 pinnacle at 99.667. A considerable Empire State headline beat gave the Greenback a lift, but in truth the latest leg up was forged at the expense of others in part, if not large extent.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Under the cosh all day, but in company earlier, Kiwi losses have now accumulated towards last Tuesday’s 2020 base, at 0.6384 vs 0.6378 and irrespective of sharp declines in GDT dairy prices. In fact, Nzd/Usd is now off worst levels even though Aud/Nzd remains elevated above 1.0450 and the Aussie is holding up better within a 0.6715-0.6674 range against its US counterpart after RBA minutes underlining why deeper rate cuts could be more problematic than prescriptive if lower borrowing costs entice higher levels of credit.</p><p><strong>SCANDI&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Kronas have both pared some losses on the back of a partial recovery in broad risk sentiment that has filtered through to oil prices, but Eur/Sek is still hovering near highs posted after Swedish jobs data showing a bigger than forecast rebound in the sa unemployment rate and an even more pronounced spike in the nsa measure, circa 10.5600 vs Eur/Nok around the middle of 10.0220-10.1100 parameters.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some respite for the Franc, Euro and Loonie in wake of a broad Buck fade, but Usd/Chf is still comfortably above 0.9800 and Eur/Chf has only managed a tame bounce from close to 1.0600 lows in line with a lame revival in Eur/Usd from 1.0785 or so back above 1.0800. To recap, a pretty downbeat ZEW survey added more evidence to the downside tilt to the German/Eurozone economy, and did preface all Eurogroup members backing a recommendation to provide fiscal stimulus if the slowdown intensifies, but to what degree and how bad things need to become is unknown. Similarly, Usd/Cad soaked up offers at 1.3270 before consolidating when Canadian manufacturing sales fell far short of expectations, but the pair has pared back towards 1.3250 ahead of Wednesday’s more pertinent CPI release.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/XAU</strong></p><p>Sterling has staged an impressive or even improbable comeback from early EU session lows, of sub-1.3000 in Cable and close to 0.8350 on the Eur/Gbp cross, but the Pound ran into resistance ahead of 1.3050 and 0.8277 respectively (latter representing the 2019 low). The initial catalyst appeared to be chart based as Cable held in at a key DMA/Fib convergence point, but then encouraging UK jobs data also helped and the Gbp is holding up well in the face of more extracts from a draft EU document underlining level playing field criteria within a revised trade negotiating mandate. Elsewhere, the Yen is keeping its head above 110.00 against the backdrop of risk-off positioning, but lagging Gold as a safe-haven as Usd/Xau tests the psychological Usd1600/oz mark.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The aforementioned Dollar wane from best levels has afforded some solace to regional currencies, but the mood remains bearish on renewed risk aversion over the impact rather than direct effect of China’s deadly virus that does appear to be topping out, thankfully. Usd/Cnh has nudged back over 7.0000 as a result, while Usd/Rub has revisited 64.0000+ and Usd/Try popped above 6.0700 amidst ongoing geopolitical strains between Turkey and Russia in Syria and Russia-Ukraine separately. However, Usd/Zar has retreated towards 15.0000 after the SARB highlighted increased sovereign risk as a reason for higher rates despite lower inflation expectations, and on that note the Lira is eyeing the CBRT tomorrow to find out if the benchmark raised are reduced again (consensus -50 bp) in the face of firmer than forecast CPI prints in the run up.</p>",

Additionally, traders will be eyeing any commentary that gives insights into the course for the Fed’s repo operations, as well as any commentary on the upcoming policy review.

Moreover, the DXY’s march towards 99.500 has resumed amidst widespread Buck gains and is understandable given the upbeat US survey and relative underperformance elsewhere, ie the single currency after ZEW’s disappointing findings.</p>",

Apple ‘s warning for Q1 revenue guidance was attributed to the coronavirus with the Co. noting it is experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than had anticipated and noted slower demand in products in China alongside iPhone supply constraints. Given that rival peers will likely be subject to similar supply-chain disruptions, IT names lag this morning with ASML International (-2.0%), Dialog Semiconductor (-4.5%), STMicroelectronics (-3%) and Infineon (-1.5%) all enduring losses. From a more medium-term perspective (referring to the US semiconductor sector), Credit Suisse notes “while we expect Semis to trade lower - we would recommend investors who can look into 2H and beyond should use weakness to accumulate best in class companies with a solid structural outlook”. Elsewhere, given the broader macro implications of Apple’s warning, material names are also softer thus far with uninspiring updates from Glencore (-3.9%) and BHP (-2.6%) pressuring the sector. Financials are falling victim to lower yields and a lacklustre update from HSBC (-5.7%) with the Co. unveiling a 33% decline in profits and a restructuring plan that will lead to a job cull of around 35k. Bucking the trend of the pessimism in Europe is the FTSE MIB (+0.3%), in the wake of Intesa Sanpaolo’s (+2.0%) takeover approach for UBI Banca (+22%), which has also stoked optimism around the prospect of further sector consolidation in Italy.</p><p>Apple (AAPL) - Co. does not expect to meet revenue guidance for March quarter citing coronavirus, Co. is experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than had anticipated; notes slower demand in products in China alongside iPhone supply constraints.

Hence, the traditional safe haven currencies (and assets) have regained a firm bid after losing some appeal at the start of the week and the DXY is back on track to post higher 2020 peaks as it edges further above 99.000 with only the likes of the Yen, Franc and Gold managing to keep pace or stay ahead of the Greenback. Indeed, Usd/Jpy has eased back a bit further from recent 110.00+ levels, while Usd/Chf is gravitating back towards 0.9800 alongside Eur/Chf on the 1.0600 handle and Usd/Xau is just below Usd1590/oz compared to a low of Usd1579 yesterday. Back to the index, 99.249 resistance has been eclipsed and 99.500 is the obvious next target for bulls ahead of last year’s 99.667 best.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/SEK/NOK - T</strong>he Antipodes are vying with their Scandi peers for the unenviable, though largely unavoidable tag of biggest G10 lower, and the Kiwi is shading it as Nzd/Usd slips under 0.6400 and Aud/Nzd holds near 1.0450 even though Aud/Usd has lost grip of the 0.6700 handle in wake of RBA minutes also flagging the Chinese nCoV outbreak as the biggest near term threat and keeping a rate cut on the table. Meanwhile, the Swedish Crown has been undermined by a rebound in jobless rates and its Norwegian counterpart by a sharp retreat in crude prices amidst the broad deterioration in risk appetite, with Eur/Sek up over 10.5600 at one stage and Eur/Nok near the top of a 10.0220-10.1100 range.</p><p><strong>GBP - </strong>Bucking the overall trend, and seemingly gleaning a belated fillip from encouraging UK jobs data (claimant count and employment change) Cable has recouped all and more of its losses around 1.3000 after testing major technical support at 1.2971 (where the 10 DMA aligns with a 50% Fib retracement), while Eur/Gbp has reversed from circa 0.8350 to just above 0.8300. Note, some selling subsequently noted in the headline pair around the 200 WMA (1.3038).</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD - </strong>Both succumbing to widespread Usd strength, with the single currency also weighing up divergent independent factors in the form of a worrying ZEW survey in contrast to reports that all Eurogroup Finance Ministers are on board with apportioning some budget finances in the event of an economic downturn, whatever that is deemed to be in terms of severity and how much cash will be allocated. Eur/Usd skirting last week’s 1.0821 base vs around 1.0837 at one stage, while Usd/Cad straddles 1.3250 ahead of Canadian manufacturing sales and with the Loonie also hampered by the aforementioned recoil in oil.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Further depreciation vs the Dollar across the board, but the Rand also wary about more Eskom load-shedding, while the Lira and Rouble are still embroiled in Syria-related issues, and the latter also undermined by heightened conflict in the Ukraine.</p><p><strong>RBA Minutes (Feb)</strong> reiterated that the Board discussed the case for further easing, chose to hold given that rates are already low and repeated that the Board remained prepared to ease further if needed. <strong>The minutes also highlighted that Coronavirus is a “material” risk to the Chinese economy and hence Australia</strong>, whilst reiterating that there was uncertainty around estimates of the effects of the bushfires and the coronavirus outbreak and it’s too early to judge virus impact. The release noted that economic drag from bushfires to be felt in Q4 and Q1, full recovery expected by year-end and it’s reasonable to expect that an extended period of low-interest rates would be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target. Finally, the minutes repeated that the outlook remained for the Australian economy to improve due in part to housing pick-up. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Core debt</strong> has pared gains across the board, partly in recognition of an inverse bounce in equities from worst levels, but also as Bunds digest news that Eurozone Governments are willing to loosen fiscal policy if economic developments worsen and Schatz digest a decent if not downright solid Eur5 bn auction. The<strong> 10 year EU </strong>benchmarks are all off peaks that came in at 174.92, 133.87 and 131-12+ on Eurex, Liffe and overnight <strong>UST</strong> trade respectively, albeit still holding up relatively well ahead of the return of Treasury cash markets after Presidents’ Day and eyeing the Empire State survey before NAHB and a late speech from Fed’s Kashkari for further inspiration.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> front month futures are subdued this morning with losses just shy of USD 1/bbl at present in-line with the general risk sentiment. Newsflow has picked up on the geopolitical front, although not enough to dictate price action at present; with focus returning to the ongoing dispute between Russia and Ukraine which has flamed up once more on reports of heavy fighting in the Lugansk province. Ukraine has one of the largest gas transmission systems in the world, which is heavily linked to Russian, Belarus, Poland and other surrounding nations; the region in question does contain a number of gas pipelines but it is unclear as to whether they are currently in use as a bypass has been constructed. Focus will remain on how this escalates, and if it leads to disruptions to gas supply. Sticking with Russia, the Kremlin this morning noted that Energy Minister Novak is still considering his position with reference to the recommended JTC production cuts. In terms of outlook, given the coronavirus ING have revised down their price forecasts as the virus causes consumption to drop; with cuts of USD 5/bbl for Q1 Brent (from USD 60/bbl to USD 55/bbl), although their forecasts are unchanged by 2021. Note, given the US holiday the weekly API and EIA metrics will be released one day late on Wednesday and Thursday respectfully. Turning to metals, where <strong>spot gold</strong> is firmer this morning on the aforementioned geo-political tensions and as the coronavirus begins to impact US tech giants; albeit, the metal has dipped marginally from session highs in recent trade ahead of the US’ entrance to market. Elsewhere, <strong>copper </strong>prices are little changed but were hit overnight in-line with general risk sentiment.</p><p>Libya’s NOC said its oil production stood at 135,745 BPD on Monday 17th vs. 163,684 on Thursday 13th.

Back to the index, 99.249 resistance has been eclipsed and 99.500 is the obvious next target for bulls ahead of last year’s 99.667 best.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/SEK/NOK - T</strong>he Antipodes are vying with their Scandi peers for the unenviable, though largely unavoidable tag of biggest G10 lower, and the Kiwi is shading it as Nzd/Usd slips under 0.6400 and Aud/Nzd holds near 1.0450 even though Aud/Usd has lost grip of the 0.6700 handle in wake of RBA minutes also flagging the Chinese nCoV outbreak as the biggest near term threat and keeping a rate cut on the table. Meanwhile, the Swedish Crown has been undermined by a rebound in jobless rates and its Norwegian counterpart by a sharp retreat in crude prices amidst the broad deterioration in risk appetite, with Eur/Sek up over 10.5600 at one stage and Eur/Nok near the top of a 10.0220-10.1100 range.</p><p><strong>GBP - </strong>Bucking the overall trend, and seemingly gleaning a belated fillip from encouraging UK jobs data (claimant count and employment change) Cable has recouped all and more of its losses around 1.3000 after testing major technical support at 1.2971 (where the 10 DMA aligns with a 50% Fib retracement), while Eur/Gbp has reversed from circa 0.8350 to just above 0.8300. Note, some selling subsequently noted in the headline pair around the 200 WMA (1.3038).</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD - </strong>Both succumbing to widespread Usd strength, with the single currency also weighing up divergent independent factors in the form of a worrying ZEW survey in contrast to reports that all Eurogroup Finance Ministers are on board with apportioning some budget finances in the event of an economic downturn, whatever that is deemed to be in terms of severity and how much cash will be allocated. Eur/Usd skirting last week’s 1.0821 base vs around 1.0837 at one stage, while Usd/Cad straddles 1.3250 ahead of Canadian manufacturing sales and with the Loonie also hampered by the aforementioned recoil in oil.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Further depreciation vs the Dollar across the board, but the Rand also wary about more Eskom load-shedding, while the Lira and Rouble are still embroiled in Syria-related issues, and the latter also undermined by heightened conflict in the Ukraine.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Core debt</strong> has pared gains across the board, partly in recognition of an inverse bounce in equities from worst levels, but also as Bunds digest news that Eurozone Governments are willing to loosen fiscal policy if economic developments worsen and Schatz digest a decent if not downright solid Eur5 bn auction. The<strong> 10 year EU </strong>benchmarks are all off peaks that came in at 174.92, 133.87 and 131-12+ on Eurex, Liffe and overnight <strong>UST</strong> trade respectively, albeit still holding up relatively well ahead of the return of Treasury cash markets after Presidents’ Day and eyeing the Empire State survey before NAHB and a late speech from Fed’s Kashkari for further inspiration.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> front month futures are subdued this morning with losses just shy of USD 1/bbl at present in-line with the general risk sentiment. Newsflow has picked up on the geopolitical front, although not enough to dictate price action at present; with focus returning to the ongoing dispute between Russia and Ukraine which has flamed up once more on reports of heavy fighting in the Lugansk province. Ukraine has one of the largest gas transmission systems in the world, which is heavily linked to Russian, Belarus, Poland and other surrounding nations; the region in question does contain a number of gas pipelines but it is unclear as to whether they are currently in use as a bypass has been constructed. Focus will remain on how this escalates, and if it leads to disruptions to gas supply. Sticking with Russia, the Kremlin this morning noted that Energy Minister Novak is still considering his position with reference to the recommended JTC production cuts. In terms of outlook, given the coronavirus ING have revised down their price forecasts as the virus causes consumption to drop; with cuts of USD 5/bbl for Q1 Brent (from USD 60/bbl to USD 55/bbl), although their forecasts are unchanged by 2021. Note, given the US holiday the weekly API and EIA metrics will be released one day late on Wednesday and Thursday respectfully. Turning to metals, where <strong>spot gold</strong> is firmer this morning on the aforementioned geo-political tensions and as the coronavirus begins to impact US tech giants; albeit, the metal has dipped marginally from session highs in recent trade ahead of the US’ entrance to market. Elsewhere, <strong>copper </strong>prices are little changed but were hit overnight in-line with general risk sentiment.</p>",

Accordingly, safe-havens have regained a strong bid and sufficient to lift the core Eurozone bond up and beyond upside chart hurdles that have been capping recovery rallies of late, at 174.69 and now 174.89, leaving little in the way of a return to the 175.00 psychological and then early February peaks just above the big figure. Bunds are currently just a tick or so below 174.92, and a bleak ZEW survey could provide bulls with more impetus, assuming EU cash bourses do not collapse to spark an even more pronounced FTQ in the meantime.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equities trade with losses across the board following a non-existent lead from Wall Street but as sentiment was dented following a profit warning by Apple, citing the coronavirus outbreak. At the electronic open, major US equity futures experienced downside, with Nasdaq Mar’20 futures immediately giving up the 9600 mark as Apple carries an 11% weighting in the index. ASX 200 (-0.4%) is led lower by broad losses across the majority of its stocks in the index, and with material names pressured amid a pullback in base metal prices and with BHP shares lower despite topping Adj. EBITDA and underlying profit forecasts, as the miner anticipates net demand losses in the near term amid the virus outbreak. Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) conformed to the overall risk tone but underperforms the region amid currency dynamics. Other notable movers from the Apple fallout include Samsung Electronics, Taiwan Semiconductor, SK Hynix and Pegatron whose shares all trade lower by 1.5-3%. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp (-0.2%) joined the downbeat performance across the region, with the former weighed on by its heavyweight financials and oil-giants, whilst the latter fares better following yesterday’s PBoC stimulus injection via its 1yr MLF rate cut.&nbsp;</p><p>In FX, DXY initially pulled back amid the Apple profit warning, and thereafter recouped losses potentially on haven properties, before eclipsing the prior session’s 99.210 high. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses experienced mild safe-haven inflows after Apple’s announcement caused jitters across the market, although the move in the pair was modest at the time. EUR/USD traded flat throughout a bulk of the session before the firmer Buck took the pair further below 1.0850 ahead of the German ZEW survey. GBP/USD holds onto a bulk of the prior session’s loses as the concerns regarding the divide between EU-UK trade talks resurfaced – and with UK’s Chief Brexit Negotiator Frost reiterating that there will be no extension to the transition period despite countless warnings from EU officials regarding the lack of time to agree on a deal. GBP/USD meanders just under 1.3000, with the pair’s 10 DMA seen around 1.2975. Meanwhile, Antipodeans were initially pressured amid overall risk aversion heading into the RBA minutes, which largely reiterated with Statement and Governor Lowe’s comments, but added that the coronavirus is a “material” risk to the Chinese economy and thus Australia. Hence, AUD/USD saw more pronounced selling with the pair losing its 0.6700 status, whilst the Kiwi also felt the China contagion, with NZD/USD heading towards 0.6400 to the downside in sympathy.</p>",
