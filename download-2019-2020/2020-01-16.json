Upside is being driven by the IT sector with gains in the semiconductor space following decent earnings from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) which has led to strong performance in MU, WDC, &amp; LRCX, which traded among top performers in the NDX. All sectors were in the green, with Materials initially weighed on after PPG earnings, which initially fell over 4%, but pared back over half its losses throughout the rest of the session. Morgan Stanley (MS) shares surged after it reported strong figures, particularly in FICC, although it noted its quarterly equity sales and trading revenue decreased in an environment characterised by lower cash market volume, lower volatility in derivatives. It is worth highlighting strong FICC and underwhelming equity revenues seem to be a recent trend over the last quarter, with similar scenarios seen in JP Morgan (JPM), Citi (C) and Bank of America (BAC). Gains in Financials were capped however, given a 7% drop in Bank of New York Mellon (BK), offsetting some of the performance from Morgan Stanley (MS) who saw gains over 8%. Charles Schwab (SCHW) was another outperformer, rising over 3% on top and bottom line earnings beats and solid rises in new brokerage accounts. Elsewhere, Tesla (TSLA) fell back below 500/share after a downgrade at Morgan Stanley, plus reports its new vehicle registrations in California nearly halved in Q4. XPO Logistics (XPO) railed over 10% as it confirmed it is looking at strategic alternatives which includes a spin off or sale of four of its business units. Signet Jewellers (SIG) surged over 40% after it reported very strong holiday sales which led to the name raising guidance. Facebook (FB) saw late session volatility following reports in the WSJ its WhatsApp unit is backing away from its advertisement plan. SPX +0.84% at 3,317, NDX +0.99% at 9,125, DJI +0.92% at 29,298.</p><p>The T-Note was offered on Thursday amid risk appetite in the wake of the Phase 1 trade deal, positive data and a strong MS earnings supporting financials. The TPLEX traded sideways in Europe, before finding offers as US participants came to the scene, then experiencing additional selling on a firm US retail sales release and strong Philly Fed Index print. The bid in equities was persistent through the session, keeping yields firmer, although a slew of FIG issuance post-earnings blackout (in additional to other ex-financials) likely helped some of the concession in later trade; by settlement, yields were around 2bps higher in the belly- and long-end. US T-note futures (H0) settled 6 ticks lower at 129-05.</p>",

President Trump yesterday, however, was keen to start Phase 2 negotiations as soon as Phase 1 has started, in 29 days time. The comments were followed by remarks that China requires time to assess the Phase 1 agreement and other factors before beginning the next, and US officials are getting ahead of themselves claiming talks are underway, according to China Global Times who cited a Government Adviser and Expert.</p><p><strong>* US RETAIL SALES (DEC): </strong>rose by 0.3% in December, in line with both the expected and the prior, which was revised higher from +0.2%; the core ex-Autos figure rose by 0.7%, above the expected +0.5%, whilst the prior was revised lower to 0% from +0.1%; the control figure, a component of GDP, rose by 0.5%, above the expected +0.4%, although the prior was revised lower to -0.1% from +0.1%. Capital Economics highlights the increase in gas prices (+2.8%) and building materials (+1.4%) offsetting the weaker motor vehicles sales (-1.3%), although notes the milder weather likely supported the building materials. Meanwhile, the consultancy notes that non-store retailer sales rose by a meagre 0.2% (prev. 0%), “suggesting that online sales were weak over cyber Monday and the entire Holiday period.” Commenting on the beat in the control against its prior revised lower, “The upshot is that, despite the good news for last month, it still looks like fourth-quarter consumption growth was around 2.0% annualized.”</p><p><strong>* PHILLY FED BUSINESS INDEX (JAN): </strong>Printed 17.0 in January, well exceeding the expected 3.8, rising from the upwardly revised prior of 2.4; New Orders rose from 11.1 to 18.2, Prices Paid rose from 15.9 to 22.1 and the Employment sub-index rose from 16.8 to 19.3. Pantheon comments that under-the-hood, the details are less inspiring, where gains in New Orders, shipments and employment were offset by declines in delivery times and inventories, “The average level of these components in the past has been a very good guide to the ISM national manufacturing index, but the indexes parted company in the spring when the China trade talks broke down and tariffs jumped.” The consultancy notes the index’s isolation to the China trade war, and as of such, does not expect its rosy picture to be echoed as strongly in the wider ISM readings.</p><p><strong>* US JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Stood at its lowest since November-end at 204k, below the expected 216.0k, and down from the prior 214k, leaving continued claims at 1.767mln (vs. exp. 1.72mln). Pantheon highlight that claims have now reversed their spike higher in December, citing seasonal adjustment factors following Thanksgiving; “the trend likely remains about 215k, a record low as a share of the employed workforce,” and note that the higher continued claims is not surprising given its lagging nature, expecting it to fall in the coming weeks. “Nothing to worry about here,” the consultancy concludes.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Bowman (voter, neutral)</strong> said that the US economy is in a \"good place\" and is likely to remain so; Fed policy rate is likely to remain at current levels this year absent of a change in the outlook. The typically less vocal Governor spoke in-fitting with other Fed officials, expressing her expectations for inflation to increase to the 2% target over the next few years.</p><p><strong>* ECB MINUTES: </strong>The account for the December meeting drew little in the way of fireworks with remarks largely echoing the findings of the policy presentation. From a macro perspective, Chief Economist Lane noted that \"incoming data since the last monetary policy meeting pointed to continued weak but stabilising euro area growth dynamics\". However, such an assessment of the economy could be perceived as somewhat stale given the lag between the meeting and the minutes publication. On this footing, the most recent round of EZ PMIs revealed an uptick in the composite measures, however, the differing performance of the services and manufacturing sectors remains a cause of concern. Policymakers also highlighted a \"mild increase\" in core inflation, however, such a pickup is likely not yet enough to warrant a policy rethink at the Bank at this stage with the headline rate still far away from target. The case for maintaining current policy settings was also bolstered by the ECB's defence of NIRP with the account noting that \"the overall effects on bank profitability had remained positive\". Elsewhere, in-fitting with reports earlier in the week, the Bank remain tight-lipped ahead of their upcoming strategic review with it being deemed \"advisable\" not to discuss the review until its launch. Overall, there was very little on offer to alter the markets perception of the current course of ECB monetary policy as investors continue to expect a \"wait and see\" approach in Frankfurt.</p><p><strong>* CHINESE MONEY SUPPLY:</strong> M2 growth increased to 8.7% above the exp. 8.3% for December, while new yuan loans printed 1.14trln, compared to the prior 1.388trln, which does place it below the expected 1.2trln. Overall, the release was slightly firmer than expected. In terms of the money supply, Pantheon do somewhat caveat the release noting the consensus was somewhat soft given recent trends. While for the loans they note that if this data is seasonally adjusted then it is only marginally softer than previously, and the modest uptrend that has featured within this data recently is still visible. Following the data release the PBoC did note that increasing M2 growth indicates that the policy measures they have taken are taking effect.</p><p><strong>* IEA MONTHLY REPORT:</strong> 2020 world oil demand growth estimate unchanged at 1.2mln BPD, due to subdued prices. Global oil demand increased by 955k BPD to 101.1mln BPD in October; supply in December decreased by 780k BPD due to Saudi Cuts. OPEC crude production fell in December by 180k BPD to 29.44mln BPD. Demand for OPEC crude to fall to 28.5mln BPD in H1 2020. Notes, even in the event OPEC adheres strictly to the output pact a strong global oil inventory build is likely in Q1. For reference, in the OPEC report 2019 world oil demand was revised down to 930k BPD (-50k BPD) while 2020 was increased to 1.22mln BPD (+140k BPD). Which contrasts with the EIA report where 2020 demand was cut by 80k BPD to 1.34mln BPD. For 2021 OPEC did not provide a world oil demand forecast but the EIA see this as being at 1.38mln BPD, which is slightly above their 2020 outlook.</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD 0.69 HIGHER AT USD 58.53/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 0.62 HIGHER AT USD 64.62/BBL. </strong>Crude benchmarks found support on Thursday after a slew of losses in recent sessions, where prices seemingly moved in sympathy with the gains in US equity markets. Since the Soleimani killing, as Iranian tensions have settled down, so has the geopolitical risk premium in crude, where now the narrative appears to be moving back to the demand side of the coin, with the crude complex finding a bid in the wake of the Phase 1 deal signing (which includes some chunky additional energy purchases from China). Citigroup's energy analysts note, \"Seasonal demand weakness in the first half of the year also points to a surplus. Overall, we see potential for a short-term correction to the upside, but without a fresh geopolitical threat to supply the highs reached earlier this month are likely to remain beyond reach.\"</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 6 TICKS LOWER AT 129-05. </strong>The T-Note was offered on Thursday amid risk appetite in the wake of the Phase 1 trade deal, positive data and a strong MS earnings supporting financials. The TPLEX traded sideways in Europe, before finding offers as US participants came to the scene, then experiencing additional selling on a firm US retail sales release and strong Philly Fed Index print. The bid in equities was persistent through the session, keeping yields firmer, although a slew of FIG issuance post-earnings blackout (in additional to other ex-financials) likely helped some of the concession in later trade; by settlement, yields were around 2bps higher in the belly- and long-end.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.84% at 3,317, NDX +0.99% at 9,125, DJI +0.92% at 29,298.</p><p><strong>* SECTORS:</strong> Materials +0.58%, IT +1.4%, Communication +0.66%, Industrials +1.01%, Financials +0.77%, Staples +0.31%, Utilities +0.61%, Discretionary +0.9%, Energy +0.12%, Health Care +0.52%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>US equities traded in fresh record high territory throughout the day with SPX above 3300 for the first time ever, one day after the Phase 1 signing. Upside is being driven by the IT sector with gains in the semiconductor space following decent earnings from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) which has led to strong performance in MU, WDC, &amp; LRCX, which traded among top performers in the NDX. All sectors were in the green, with Materials initially weighed on after PPG earnings, which initially fell over 4%, but pared back over half its losses throughout the rest of the session. Morgan Stanley (MS) shares surged after it reported strong figures, particularly in FICC, although it noted its quarterly equity sales and trading revenue decreased in an environment characterised by lower cash market volume, lower volatility in derivatives. It is worth highlighting strong FICC and underwhelming equity revenues seem to be a recent trend over the last quarter, with similar scenarios seen in JP Morgan (JPM), Citi (C) and Bank of America (BAC). Gains in Financials were capped however, given a 7% drop in Bank of New York Mellon (BK), offsetting some of the performance from Morgan Stanley (MS) who saw gains over 8%. Charles Schwab (SCHW) was another outperformer, rising over 3% on top and bottom line earnings beats and solid rises in new brokerage accounts. Elsewhere, Tesla (TSLA) fell back below 500/share after a downgrade at Morgan Stanley, plus reports its new vehicle registrations in California nearly halved in Q4. XPO Logistics (XPO) railed over 10% as it confirmed it is looking at strategic alternatives which includes a spin off or sale of four of its business units. Signet Jewellers (SIG) surged over 40% after it reported very strong holiday sales which led to the name raising guidance. Facebook (FB) saw late session volatility following reports in the WSJ its WhatsApp unit is backing away from its advertisement plans.</p><p><strong>* CBRT: </strong>The Turkish Central Bank opted to cut its Weekly Repo Rate by 75bps – thus bringing the rate down to 11.25% vs. the median forecast for a 50bps cut, although some news vendors had -75bps as consensus. Nonetheless, the pace of easing has slowed, given that rate reductions since July 2019 have been deeper than 100bps. The Central Bank stated that the current monetary policy stance remains consistent with the projected disinflation path and reaffirmed its cautious stance. However, the Bank’s assessment on inflation is slightly less dovish: “inflation is judged to be broadly in-line with the end of 2020 inflation projection” - whereas in December it was seen that “inflation is likely to materialise close to the lower bound of the October inflation projections”. It’s worth noting that with the key rate at 11.25%, and most recent Y/Y CPI at 11.84%, that real rates are now in negative territory, thus further narrowing the Central Bank’s scope for easing. Analysts at ING also believe that the Bank will likely remain cautious in the near future amid “likely stickier inflation readings with a less supportive base and a low real rate buffer”. That said, ING caveats by stating that depending on the Lira’s performance, further measured easing cannot be ruled out and other desks concur given President Erdogan’s desire to see interest rates down in single digits this year.</p><p><strong>* SARB: </strong>SARB cut rates by 25bp against the consensus for no change, taking the key repo down to 6.25%; additionally, the decision was unanimous in contrast to last time where there was a 2-3 split in favour of unchanged, with two dovish dissenters. The Bank was expected to remain on hold ahead of the February budget and subsequent review from Moody’s, the only agency still awarding SA an investment grade rating. Within the statement, which as usual came ahead of the decision itself, growth and inflation forecasts were downgraded amidst a 'significant' downward revision to the medium-term outlook for inflation, even though the revised projections remain inside the SARB’s 3-6% target band. However, subdued prices have been an issue for some time, and at the previous meeting the SARB acknowledged that inflation metrics continued to moderate. The unexpected cut prompted initial weakness in the ZAR; although this has largely been pared back perhaps as the Bank noted that the inflation outlook remains balanced overall.</p><p>*<strong> FX: USD</strong> firmer after strong retail sales and Philadelphia Fed figures, with generally strong internals too. <strong>EUR </strong>traded lower today amid strength in GBP and USD, which as a result weighed on the single currency. The single currency retraced back through the 200dma at 1.1140 post ECB minutes and found support at 1.1130 against the greenback. <strong>GBP</strong> continued to regain post dovish losses amid a technical unwind where cable looked past stops touted at 1.3050 and surpassed through its 200HMA at 1.3067 to find resistance around 1.3080; stops were touted around 1.3070-75. EURGBP approached 0.85 to the downside although stopped in its track at 0.8510. <strong>CAD </strong>traded in a thin range and fought back against the rising greenback following a strong ADP print. <strong>JPY</strong> found resistance at 110.20 against the buck which was driven by a stronger dollar combined with a risk on feel to markets which likely led to rate differentials also explaining JPY weakness. <strong>XAU</strong> traded lower today but remains around the key 1550 figure as the precious metal was offered on the market risk tone. <strong>NZD</strong> outperformed its Antipodean counterpart as the Kiwi benefited from a short squeeze and paring of oversold positions amidst a less dovish RBNZ rate call via ASB. <strong>AUD</strong> was weighed on by a stronger buck throughout US trade. <strong>EMFX</strong> was mixed, <strong>TRY</strong> firmer amid a 75bp cut from CBRT which was within analyst ranges which was also accompanied by a less dovish inflation outlook for the end of this year. <strong>ZAR</strong> traded weaker after SARB cut its GDP &amp; CPI forecasts, which was shortly followed by a unanimous 25bp cut against analyst expectations. <strong>MXN</strong> unreactive despite the US Senate passing USMCA, although this was widely expected.</p>",

In fact, the DXY looks set to maintain its recovery momentum from a 97.081 low after extending session highs to 97.365 and not really getting derailed by sub-forecast/zero business inventories.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/GBP/EUR/CHF/JPYCAD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi’s wings have been clipped somewhat by the broad Buck bounce, but Nzd/Usd is holding relatively comfortably above 0.6600 with some favourable tailwinds coming via the Aud/Nzd cross extending its pull-back from circa 1.0434 (and higher on Wednesday) through 1.0400. Hence, the Aussie has not weathered the Greenback revival as well, as Aud/Usd loses 0.6900+ status yet again after clambering above a first line of resistance, but not breaching the upper end of the zone between 0.6620-40. Elsewhere, the Pound has also faded following a false break above a key chart level (200 HMA at 1.3067) and working its way through stops (from 1.3070-75), though clinging to 1.3050 and like the Kiwi deriving indirect impetus from Eur/Gbp reversing from around 0.8561 to test the 21 DMA (0.8526) amidst some speculation about fix flow. Consequently or coincidentally, the Euro retreated from 1.1170+ post-ECB minutes and back below the 200 DMA (1.1140) to 1.1130 vs the Dollar, but managed to contain or arrest its slide against the Franc within a 1.0760-30 band as Usd/Chf bounced from the low 0.9600 area back up towards 0.9650. Last, but perhaps not least, the Loonie continues to pivot 1.3050 awaiting USMCA news and eyeing a partial recover in oil prices.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Aside from the usual lock-step moves with overall risk sentiment and inverse Usd correlations, the Try and Zar both had January Central Bank policy meetings to contend with and the responses have been notably different. The CBRT was up first and delivered a 75 bp ease, at the top end of the median forecast range, but well within the extremes (flat to -125 bp). Moreover, this was significantly less than rate cuts administered over the cycle so far and the accompany statement revealed a less dovish inflation outlook for the end of 2020, so the Lira recouped more of its recent losses to 5.8345 at one stage. However, the SARB confounded much more clear cut expectations for no change in the benchmark repo and pushed the Rand down to 14.4400 or so even though the usual pre-rate announcement press conference contained downward GDP and CPI revisions along with a ‘significant’ downgrade to the medium term inflation outlook that collective provided a strong hint or at least inkling of the ensuing decision. Conversely, the Cnh traded with a firmer bias on a follow through from the PBoC’s latest midpoint Cny fixing overnight, but perhaps also buoyed by the official Phase One trade deal sign-off and pledges to keep the Yuan, liquidity and market conditions stable going in to Lunar New Year.</p>",

Upside is being driven by the IT sector with gains in the semiconductor space following decent earnings from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) which has led to strong performance in MU, WDC, AMD &amp; LRCX, who are the top performers in the NDX since the opening bell. All sectors are in the green today with Materials at the bottom of the pack due to weakness in PPG hampering the sector which reported a slight miss on headline figures and provided dismal guidance. Financials open +0.3% higher with outperformance from Morgan Stanley who reported strong figures, particularly in FICC, although it noted its quarterly equity sales and trading revenue decreased in an environment characterised by lower cash market volume, lower volatility in derivatives. Strong FICC and underwhelming equity revenues seem to be a recent trend over the last quarter, with similar scenarios seen in JP Morgan (JPM), Citi (C) and Bank of America (BAC). Gains however are limited in the sector today given a 7% drop in Bank of New York Mellon (BK), offsetting some of the performance from Morgan Stanley (MS).</li></ul>",

Alongside this, ING posit that they will have to substitute imports from other countries to the US, and thus may cause other countries to switch their demand from US products to other countries (e.g. Brazil). With such a switch occurring to take advantage of lower prices due to reduced Chinese demand from these 3rd party countries.</li></ul><p><strong>Phase Two</strong></p><ul><li>President Trump remarked that Phase Two discussion will commence once Phase One begins, while VP Pence said negotiations for Phase Two have already begun. However, in contrast to the US’ stance, Chinese VP Liu He believes it is unwise to rush into the Phase Two negotiations, stating Beijing has little interest in immediately doing so; adding, we may get nothing if we rush Part Two before completing Part One. (SCMP). It’s also worth highlighting that China do have the option to leave the Phase One deal, which would evidently derail any further talks and likely see a return to a all-out trade war between the two nations.</li><li>Overall, the discrepancy on when Phase Two begins is not too pertinent at this stage, as Trump has made it clear that he is looking to wait until after the November US elections to begin the next Phase. With markets now expecting little to occur in terms of Phase Two until November; therefore, focus for the foreseeable future will be on determining China’s compliance to the deal alongside what, if any, enforceability measures are utilised.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-phase-one-signed-eventually-phase-two-ahead-16-01-2020\">Link to further analysis</a></p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>US retail sales for December are seen rising 0.3% in the headline (prev. +0.2%), whilst the ex-autos figure is seen rising 0.5% (prev. +0.1%). UBS is holding a more pessimistic view, however, expecting the ex-autos to rise just 0.1% amid the lagged impact of tariffs feeding through the US economy, highlighting that consumer goods imports are down 10.6% since last August, “The Phase 1 deal leaves most US tariffs on USD 360bln of imports from China intact. Wall Street rejoices, while Main Street coughs up.” Meanwhile, Capital Economics takes a more optimistic view, seeing ex-autos rising 0.6%, with its headline estimates in-line at +0.3%, citing the 2.3% M/M fall in manufactures’ real unit sales. On the firmer core figure, the consultancy says, “we expect the various other more volatile categories to have boosted sales, with gasoline station sales likely to have benefited from the 2.5% rise in prices last month, and building materials sales probably picking up thanks to unseasonably mild weather and the recent recovery in home sales.” Some participants will be cautious heading into the release at 08:30 EST / 13:30 GMT following on from some ominous holiday season sales reporting from Target (TGT) on Tuesday, as well as L Brands (LB) and Kohl’s (KSS) last week.</li></ul>",

Nonetheless, <strong>ASX 200 (+0.7%) </strong>outperformed as it forayed above 7000 for the first time ever led by notable strength in tech and financials, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.1%)</strong> was indecisive and stalled ahead of 24k despite strong Machinery Orders which showed the first M/M expansion in 5 months, as well as its largest increase on record for the series. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.4%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%)</strong> failed to take advantage of another substantial PBoC liquidity injection and the eased tensions from the US-China trade deal, as there were lingering doubts regarding China’s caveat of purchasing agricultural goods “based on market conditions”, while the unilateral dispute settlement mechanism which allows US to reimpose tariffs for non-compliance and doesn’t permit China to retaliate but instead can quit the agreement, fuelled some concerns on whether the deal will hold. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher and briefly reclaimed the 152.00 level with prices supported as the momentum in stocks began to wane and with the BoJ also in the market for JPY 350bln of JGBs in the belly.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 300bln through 14-day reverse repos.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Overall a mixed and choppy session thus far in the European equity space [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.2%] </strong>following a rather tepid APAC handover, as markets digested the nitty-gritty of the Phase One deal and with Phase Two talks on the horizon. Major bourses are swinging between gains and losses with no clear direction thus far, whilst the FTSE 100 (-0.5%) modestly underperforms regional peers amid unfavourable Sterling action coupled with losses in individual stocks. Sectors are also mixed and do not clearly reflect a specific risk sentiment; although, the energy sector leads the upside as oil prices crawl back from YTD lows. In terms of individual movers: Pearson (-9.8%) plumbed the depths following a profit warning and the announcement of the departure of its CFO. GlaxoSmithKline (-1.5%) extended on losses seen at the open following a negative broker move coupled with the rebuttal of reports that that there will be an IPO of its consumer JV with Pfizer. On the flip side, RWE (+2.0%) sees healthy gains after a German government spokesman said the Co. is to receive EUR 2.6bln compensation for higher electricity costs caused by a coal exit law which is to be drafted this month. Elsewhere Associated British Foods’ (+2.4%) shares remain supported by a lukewarm trading update in which the Co. reaffirmed guidance. Note, auto makers largely side-lined the Washington Post’s report that US President Trump issued a private warning to Germany, France and the UK that the US will impose a 25% tariff on European autos if Europe refused to initiate the dispute mechanism against Iran in the JCPOA deal, according to European sources.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD -</strong> A rather underwhelming response to the official Phase One signing ceremony has left the Greenback languishing near or at new lows against most major counterparts and the DXY trying to defend the 97.000 level again within a 97.263-134 range. Technically, 97.105 and 97.091 supports from earlier in the month are still holding, but the Buck’s fate could ultimately lie with fundamentals and Thursday’s multiple US macro releases including retail sales for the festive period and more timely January Philly Fed survey.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD -</strong> Another marked swing in sentiment of change in fortunes down under, as the Kiwi benefits from a short squeeze and paring of oversold positions amidst a less dovish RBNZ rate call via ASB to extend gains above 0.6600 against its US peer towards 0.6650 and through resistance at 0.6620, while paring loss vs the Aussie from 1.0450+ to almost 1.0400. Meanwhile, Aud/Usd is still struggling to overcome 0.6920 after multiple attempts and eyeing Usd/Cnh-Cny moves in wake of the initial trade deal allied to PBoC fixings and policy action ahead of next week’s Chinese Lunar New Year break and Australian jobs data.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/CAD/EUR -</strong> All firmer against the Buck, albeit marginally, as Pound pivots 1.3050 between 1.3025-65 parameters and fades just ahead of the 200 HMA (1.3067) after tripping stops at the aforementioned half round number, but not threatening more said to be poised between 1.3070-75. Elsewhere, the Franc remains firm across the board with Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf both hovering closer to 0.9625 and 1.0735 lows than 0.9650 and 1.0760 highs, even though the single currency is consolidating recent advances vs the Dollar around 1.1150 and more convincingly beyond the 200 DMA (1.1140). Similarly, the Loonie has advanced into a higher 1.3048-32 band vs its NA rival with some traction from comparative stability in crude prices.</p><p><strong>JPY/SEK/NOK -</strong> Marginally bucking the overall trend, Usd/Jpy has rebounded from Wednesday’s lows to retest offers around 110.00 where a hefty 1.8 bn option expiries roll-off, while Eur/Sek is straddling 10.5500 following 2020 Swedish growth and inflation forecast downgrades by the Government and Eur/Nok is flitting either side of 9.8800 in wake of the latest Norges Bank credit survey revealing little change in loan demand.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> In keeping with no real rise in risk appetite post-US/China Phase One trade deal signing, most regional currencies are largely idling, the Try felt some tailwinds in the aftermath of the CBRT rate decision despite a deeper-than-forecast cut to its weekly repo rate, bringing it down to 11.25% from 12.00%, although some vendors were forecasting a 75bps cut – which would be in-line with the Central Bank’s action. The Lira may have derived strength given the slowing pace of the cuts (reductions since July 2019 have each been deeper than 100bps). Further, from an inflation perspective, the Bank also noted that inflation is judged to be broadly in line with the end of 2020 inflation projection. Whereas, in December it was seen that inflation is likely to materialise close to the lower bound of the October inflation projections. Usd/Try immediately fell to test 5.8500 to the downside vs. a pre-announcement level of ~5.8750, albeit the move did largely pare back, potentially on geopolitical developments after the Turkish President announced that troops will be deployed to Libya. Next up, Zar will be eyeing the SARB’s rate announcement from 13:00GMT after somewhat mixed SA gold and overall mining output data.</p><p>Major FX Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/USD<strong>: 1.1100-10 (1.8BLN),</strong> 1.1145-50 (700M)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USD/JPY: <strong>110.00 (1.8BLN)</strong></p><p><strong>Turkish CBT Weekly Repo Rate* (Jan) 11.25% vs. Exp. 11.5% (Prev. 12.0%)</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current monetary policy stance remains consistent with projected disinflation path</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extent of monetary tightness will be determined by looking at indications of the underlying trend in inflation</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path will require the continuation of a cautious stance</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The path of inflation is judged to be broadly in line with the end of 2020 inflation projection</p><p>Swedish government looks for 1.1% growth in 2020 (Sept. view was 1.4%), CPI seen at 1.5% (Sept. view was 1.6%); slowdown in the global economy is becoming increasingly clear in the Swedish economy. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds </strong>are back in positive territory just shy of a marginal new 171.68 Eurex high and unwinding some underperformance vs Gilts, as the latter continue to take a breather after their recent outsize advances. However, both EU benchmarks are holding a moderately firmer line than US Treasuries ahead of a packed 2nd half kicking off with ECB minutes before US data at 13.30GMT and 15.00GMT then Fed’s Bowman, ECB President Lagarde and BoE’s Haldane. Note also, after the pomp and fanfare of Thursday’s US-China Phase 1 signing ceremony it’s back to earnings for Wall Street that is still broadly on a winning streak and racking up almost daily record highs.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>IEA Monthly Report</strong>: 2020 world oil demand growth estimate unchanged at 1.2mln BPD, due to subdued prices.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Global oil demand increased by 955k BPD to 101.1mln BPD in October; supply in December decreased by 780k BPD due to Saudi Cuts</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPEC crude production fell in December by 180k BPD to 29.44mln BPD; Demand for OPEC crude to fall to 28.5mln BPD in H1 2020</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notes, even in the event OPEC adheres strictly to the output pact a strong global oil inventory build is likely in Q1</p>",

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/23643/download\">here</a> If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal. To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>Overall a mixed and choppy session thus far in the European equity space [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.2%] following a rather tepid APAC handover, as markets digested the nitty-gritty of the Phase One deal and with Phase Two talks on the horizon. Major bourses are swinging between gains and losses with no clear direction thus far, whilst the FTSE 100 (-0.5%) modestly underperforms regional peers amid unfavourable Sterling action coupled with losses in individual stocks. Sectors are also mixed and do not clearly reflect a specific risk sentiment; although, the energy sector leads the upside as oil prices crawl back from YTD lows. In terms of individual movers: Pearson (-9.8%) plumbed the depths following a profit warning and the announcement of the departure of its CFO. GlaxoSmithKline (-1.5%) extended on losses seen at the open following a negative broker move coupled with the rebuttal of reports that that there will be an IPO of its consumer JV with Pfizer. On the flip side, RWE (+2.0%) sees healthy gains after a German government spokesman said the Co. is to receive EUR 2.6bln compensation for higher electricity costs caused by a coal exit law which is to be drafted this month. Elsewhere Associated British Foods’ (+2.4%) shares remain supported by a lukewarm trading update in which the Co. reaffirmed guidance. Note, auto makers largely side-lined the Washington Post’s report that US President Trump issued a private warning to Germany, France and the UK that the US will impose a 25% tariff on European autos if Europe refused to initiate the dispute mechanism against Iran in the JCPOA deal, according to European sources.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>USD - A rather underwhelming response to the official Phase One signing ceremony has left the Greenback languishing near or at new lows against most major counterparts and the DXY trying to defend the 97.000 level again within a 97.263-134 range. Technically, 97.105 and 97.091 supports from earlier in the month are still holding, but the Buck’s fate could ultimately lie with fundamentals and Thursday’s multiple US macro releases including retail sales for the festive period and more timely January Philly Fed survey.</p><p>NZD/AUD - Another marked swing in sentiment of change in fortunes down under, as the Kiwi benefits from a short squeeze and paring of oversold positions amidst a less dovish RBNZ rate call via ASB to extend gains above 0.6600 against its US peer towards 0.6650 and through resistance at 0.6620, while paring loss vs the Aussie from 1.0450+ to almost 1.0400. Meanwhile, Aud/Usd is still struggling to overcome 0.6920 after multiple attempts and eyeing Usd/Cnh-Cny moves in wake of the initial trade deal allied to PBoC fixings and policy action ahead of next week’s Chinese Lunar New Year break and Australian jobs data.</p><p>GBP/CHF/CAD/EUR - All firmer against the Buck, albeit marginally, as Pound pivots 1.3050 between 1.3025-65 parameters and fades just ahead of the 200 HMA (1.3067) after tripping stops at the aforementioned half round number, but not threatening more said to be poised between 1.3070-75. Elsewhere, the Franc remains firm across the board with Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf both hovering closer to 0.9625 and 1.0735 lows than 0.9650 and 1.0760 highs, even though the single currency is consolidating recent advances vs the Dollar around 1.1150 and more convincingly beyond the 200 DMA (1.1140). Similarly, the Loonie has advanced into a higher 1.3048-32 band vs its NA rival with some traction from comparative stability in crude prices.</p><p>JPY/SEK/NOK - Marginally bucking the overall trend, Usd/Jpy has rebounded from Wednesday’s lows to retest offers around 110.00 where a hefty 1.8 bn option expiries roll-off, while Eur/Sek is straddling 10.5500 following 2020 Swedish growth and inflation forecast downgrades by the Government and Eur/Nok is flitting either side of 9.8800 in wake of the latest Norges Bank credit survey revealing little change in loan demand.</p><p>EM - In keeping with no real rise in risk appetite post-US/China Phase One trade deal signing, most regional currencies are largely idling, the Try felt some tailwinds in the aftermath of the CBRT rate decision despite a deeper-than-forecast cut to its weekly repo rate, bringing it down to 11.25% from 12.00%, although some vendors were forecasting a 75bps cut – which would be in-line with the Central Bank’s action. The Lira may have derived strength given the slowing pace of the cuts (reductions since July 2019 have each been deeper than 100bps). Further, from an inflation perspective, the Bank also noted that inflation is judged to be broadly in line with the end of 2020 inflation projection. Whereas, in December it was seen that inflation is likely to materialise close to the lower bound of the October inflation projections. Usd/Try immediately fell to test 5.8500 to the downside vs. a pre-announcement level of ~5.8750, albeit the move did largely pare back, potentially on geopolitical developments after the Turkish President announced that troops will be deployed to Libya. Next up, Zar will be eyeing the SARB’s rate announcement from 13:00GMT after somewhat mixed SA gold and overall mining output data.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Bunds are back in positive territory just shy of a marginal new 171.68 Eurex high and unwinding some underperformance vs Gilts, as the latter continue to take a breather after their recent outsize advances. However, both EU benchmarks are holding a moderately firmer line than US Treasuries ahead of a packed 2nd half kicking off with ECB minutes before US data at 13.30GMT and 15.00GMT then Fed’s Bowman, ECB President Lagarde and BoE’s Haldane. Note also, after the pomp and fanfare of Thursday’s US-China Phase 1 signing ceremony it’s back to earnings for Wall Street that is still broadly on a winning streak and racking up almost daily record highs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures remain subdued, albeit off worst levels with little by way of immediate fundamental catalysts and with a muted response to the Phase One deal signing as focus shifts to its implementation alongside Phase Two dialogue. <strong>WTI</strong> Feb’20 futures meander around the USD 58/bbl mark while its <strong>Brent</strong> counterpart hovers below 64.50/bbl, having oscillated on either side of the level. This morning also saw the release of the IEA monthly oil report which left its 2020 global demand growth estimate unchanged, misaligning itself from the OPEC and EIA STEOs which upgraded and downgraded their forecasts respectively. The report however did align itself with some aspects of the OPEC report, such as the forecasted fall in OPEC crude demand and OPEC’s production declines. IEA also noted that even in the event OPEC adheres strictly to the output pact a strong global oil inventory build is likely in Q1. Energy futures were little fazed by the release. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> prices remain flat but off overnight lows and modestly above the USD 1550/oz level. Finally, <strong>copper</strong> prices extend on its recent gains above 2.85/lb on optimistic demand prospects from the US-Sino ceasefire with 2.90/lb the next level to the upside which may see psychological resistance.</p>",

Similarly, the Loonie has advanced into a higher 1.3048-32 band vs its NA rival with some traction from comparative stability in crude prices.</p><p><strong>JPY/SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Marginally bucking the overall trend, Usd/Jpy has rebounded from Wednesday’s lows to retest offers around 110.00 where a hefty 1.8 bn option expiries roll-off, while Eur/Sek is straddling 10.5500 following 2020 Swedish growth and inflation forecast downgrades by the Government and Eur/Nok is flitting either side of 9.8800 in wake of the latest Norges Bank credit survey revealing little change in loan demand.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>In keeping with no real rise in risk appetite post-US/China Phase One trade deal signing, most regional currencies are largely idling, but the Try will be hostage to the upcoming CBRT policy verdict and Zar dependent on the SARB from 13GMT after somewhat mixed SA gold and overall mining output data.</p>",

Nomura believes that this broad-based purchasing of equity futures appears to look quite overheated when compared to economic fundamentals. In the event that a downward adjustment is sufficient enough to make CTAs refrain from buying the dip, CTAs could be forced to completely pull-out of long positions.</p><p>In the fixed income space, it appears that trend-followers look as though they are standing prepared to chase bond markets higher. Global macro hedge funds also look inclined towards purchasing bonds with long positions in US government bonds that were seen in H2 2019, continuing into 2020.</p><p>In FX, CTAs aggregate position in USD briefly switched to net short at the beginning of 2020, however this did not last long.

Some retracement and unwinding of gains relative to peers is unsurprising, if not expected given the recent pronounced rally in UK debt and along the 3 month strip, but technical/tactical positioning may also be at play given that Gilts faded ahead of chart resistance again (133.59), and this time at 133.40 compared to 133.51 on Wednesday.

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: Phase One Signed (Eventually), Phase Two Ahead",
        "content": "<p><strong>Signing</strong></p><ul><li>US President Trump and Chinese VP Liu He signed the Phase One deal after a very long ceremony. During the signing Trump made a commitment to a reciprocal visit to China in the not too distant future; additionally, stating that work on Phase Two as soon as Phase One begins (Note, VP Pence remarked that Phase Two work has already begun). Crucially, Trump agreed to remove all tariffs once Phase Two has been completed, which he believes will be the last phase, his justification for the retainment of tariffs is to have a stronger negotiating position.</li></ul><p><strong>Document Release</strong></p><ul><li>As stated by US Officials prior to the signing, the documents of the deal were made available to the public. Desks noted that this release is neither better or worse than was anticipated, with it possible to make a case for both; as, the document itself is longer and contains more information than base-line expectations. However, the wording in the release is somewhat more vague than was anticipated. Overall, the deal is roughly in-line with expectations/source reports in the lead up to the release. Possibly the most pertinent line is regarding agricultural purchases, where it is agreed that purchases are to occur at market prices and dependent on market conditions; a point emphasised by Liu He’s remarks. ING highlight that the remarks from Liu He are slightly different to those within the text, the English version at least. Although, the agreement does not mention enforcement mechanism around agricultural purchases so it’s unclear as to how strict the US will be in judging if commitment to such purchases have been achieved; and, more importantly, if any actions will be taken if the purchases are not attained. Given the focus on the above purchases during negotiations such ambiguity in the language and views from either side increases the likelihood of a disagreement on whether purchases are compliant, and as such is a risk-factor in terms of sanction relief and the required Phase Two progress.</li></ul><p><strong>Purchase Breakdown</strong></p><ul><li>Note, this is in USD terms with 2017 as the baseline.</li><li>200bln total additional purchases of US goods over 2020/21: 76.7bln in 2020 and 123.3bln in 2021</li><li>32.9bln additional purchases in manufacturing goods in 2020 and 44.8bln in 2021</li><li>12.5bln additional purchases in agricultural goods in 2020 and 19.5bln in 2021</li><li>18.5bln additional purchases in energy goods in 2020 and 33.9bln in 2021</li><li>12.8bln additional purchases in services in 2020 and 25.1bln in 2021</li><li>In terms of the agricultural purchase amounts, in order to attain such high imports (and assuming demand does not significantly increase of its own accord) the Chinese government will need to subsidies the purchases undertaken by domestic importers. Alongside this, ING posit that they will have to substitute imports from other countries to the US, and thus may cause other countries to switch their demand from US products to other countries (e.g. Brazil). With such a switch occurring to take advantage of lower prices due to reduced Chinese demand from these 3rd party countries.</li></ul><p><strong>Attainability</strong></p><ul><li>Post-release, the most significant concern for the deal is whether it is realistic for China to meet the purchase levels above. ING note this additional demand equates to USD 150/per citizen, a level which will be difficult to meet; especially as the Chinese Government have made it clear they wish for the long-term trend of import declines to continue.</li></ul><p><strong>Other Points</strong></p><ul><li>The deal covers a multitude of other areas, such as: IP, enforcement, technology transfers, currency enforcement and financial services. Desks highlight that a number of these points (IP and financial services for instance) had already been addressed in earlier reforms, and so do not change the dial significantly.</li><li>Enforcement – At the signing Trump stated that the agreement includes ‘full enforceability’, with the retention of tariffs and the promise of a Phase Two reduction the enforcement mechanism for the deal in its entirety. Specifically, for intellectual property, the deal specifies a number of measures which China must take, such as ‘recognising the importance of establishing and implementing a comprehensive legal system of IP protection and enforcement’.</li><li>Currency Enforcement – Follows on from the US removing China from its currency manipulator list, due to steps having been taken to address their status as a currency manipulator. As such, the importance of this section is somewhat negated; nonetheless, enforcement around currency within the trade deal does provide the US with another tool in attempting to compel China to not interfere in currency manipulation.</li></ul><p><strong>Phase Two</strong></p><ul><li>President Trump remarked that Phase Two discussion will commence once Phase One begins, while VP Pence said negotiations for Phase Two have already begun. However, in contrast to the US’ stance, Chinese VP Liu He believes it is unwise to rush into the Phase Two negotiations, stating Beijing has little interest in immediately doing so; adding, we may get nothing if we rush Part Two before completing Part One. (SCMP). It’s also worth highlighting that China do have the option to leave the Phase One deal, which would evidently derail any further talks and likely see a return to a all-out trade war between the two nations.</li><li>Overall, the discrepancy on when Phase Two begins is not too pertinent at this stage, as Trump has made it clear that he is looking to wait until after the November US elections to begin the next Phase. With markets now expecting little to occur in terms of Phase Two until November; therefore, focus for the foreseeable future will be on determining China’s compliance to the deal alongside what, if any, enforceability measures are utilised.</li></ul>",

Debt and financial markets in general have largely taken the US-China Phase One deal in stride, with attention on compliance and repercussions for the 2nd/final part of the trade accord. However, the core Eurozone bond may be deriving some support from the weaker tone in peripheral paper after big syndications this week and an EC warning that Portugal may breach deficit limits. Ahead, ECB minutes and a speech from President Lagarde are scheduled along with a raft of US data that could provide more impetus.</p>",

As such, the greenback’s major counterparts held on to recent gains in which <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> found a base at the 1.1150 level and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> building upon its advances to test 1.3050. Elsewhere <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were choppy with the former eyeing a reclaim of the 110.00 handle, while antipodeans mildly benefitted from another firmer PBoC reference rate setting with slight outperformance in <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> after breaking through the prior day’s resistance of 0.6620 and with ASB suggesting the RBNZ can be patient on delivering its next rate cut this year.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were mixed in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures recouped losses to reclaim the USD 58.00/bbl level after yesterday’s relatively choppy session where prices were initially pressured after a mixed OPEC report where 2019 world oil demand growth forecast was lowered, but then recovered as Wall St posted record highs and with the latest EIA inventory report showing a larger than expected draw in headline crude inventories.

(Washington Post)</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>The TPLEX settled firmer amid caution on the signing of the Phase 1 trade deal. Fixed income got off on the front foot throughout the European session in a bull-flattening manner. The march higher seemed to be led by Bunds and Gilts as they tested technical levels on the upside, with the latter supported by growing consensus for a BoE rate cut, which soon saw the TPLEX follow suit. The T-Note did pare some of its gains heading into the US cash equity open, where risk appetite picked up, although ultimately found itself back to highs once the dust settled from the Phase 1 deal. By settlement, the curve's bull flattening saw yields lower across the curve, with the 30-year yield falling 4bps, seeing the 2s30s narrow by approximately 2.5bps. US T-note futures (H0) settled 6+ ticks higher at 129-11.</p><p><strong>Fed's Beige Book stated US activity continued to expand modestly in the last 6 weeks of 2019 and that expectations for near term outlook remained modestly favourable across the nation</strong>. Furthermore, consumer spending grew at a modest to moderate pace and some noted a pick up from previous, while holiday sales on balance were said to be solid although manufacturing activity was \"essentially flat\" and tariffs as well as trade uncertainty continued to weigh in many districts. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Kaplan (Voter, Neutral)</strong> said the Fed should have a structure in place so that it can have the smallest balance sheet possible, while he added it would be healthy to lay out a path where the Fed can reduce repo operations and curtail balance sheet growth. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Harker (Voter, Neutral)</strong> said rates are in a good place unless there is a significant change in inflation, while he added they don't need to lower rates right now citing risks of financial stability.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mostly higher but with gains capped as the euphoria from the US-China Phase 1 trade deal signing, which had buoyed Wall St to record highs and the Emini S&amp;P to an unprecedented 3300 level, began to wane amid some doubts concerning the implementation of the deal. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.6%) outperformed as it forayed above 7000 for the first time ever led by notable strength in tech and financials, while Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) was indecisive and stalled ahead of 24k despite strong Machinery Orders which showed the first M/M expansion in 5 months, as well as its largest increase on record for the series. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) failed to take advantage of another substantial PBoC liquidity injection and the eased tensions from the US-China trade deal, as there were lingering doubts regarding China’s caveat of purchasing agricultural goods “based on market conditions”, while the unilateral dispute settlement mechanism which allows US to reimpose tariffs for non-compliance and doesn’t permit China to retaliate but instead can quit the agreement, fuelled some concerns on whether the deal will hold. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher and briefly reclaimed the 152.00 level with prices supported as the momentum in stocks began to wane and with the BoJ also in the market for JPY 350bln of JGBs in the belly.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher but with gains capped as the euphoria from the US-China Phase 1 trade deal signing, which had buoyed Wall St to record highs and the Emini S&amp;P to an unprecedented 3300 level, began to wane amid some doubts concerning the implementation of the deal. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.6%) is the outperformer as it forays above 7000 for the first time ever led by notable strength in tech and financials, while Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) is indecisive and has stalled ahead of 24k despite strong Machinery Orders which showed the first M/M expansion in 5 months, as well as its largest increase on record for the series. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are varied after failing to take full advantage of another substantial PBoC liquidity injection and the eased tensions from the US-China trade deal, as there are some doubts regarding China’s caveat of purchasing agricultural goods “based on market conditions”, while the dispute settlement mechanism also allows US to reimpose tariffs for non-compliance but doesn’t permit China to retaliate although it can quit the agreement.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains subdued after mixed data and the Phase 1 deal signing failed to spur bids, while the lacklustre tone was not helped by Congress in which the House voted to send the Articles of Impeachment against President Trump to the Senate. As such, the greenback’s major counterparts hold on to most their recent gains in which EUR/USD found a base at the 1.1150 level and with early attempts to build upon the advances in GBP/USD thwarted by resistance around 1.3050. Elsewhere USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are choppy with the former eyeing a reclaim of the 110.00 handle, while antipodeans mildly benefit from another firmer PBoC reference rate setting with slight outperformance in NZD/USD after tripping through the prior day’s resistance at 0.6620 and with ASB suggesting the RBNZ can be patient on delivering its next rate cut this year.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher and just about reclaimed the 152.00 level with prices supported as the momentum in stocks begins to wane and with the BoJ also in the market for JPY 350bln of JGBs in the belly.</p>",
