(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Financial names, including Citi Group (C), Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), were broadly lower as yields extended their march lower, with some financial newswires also citing worries about declining trading volumes and economic health. Energy names, including ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP), were also broadly lower, as WTI crude fell on the day. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) moved lower amidst a spike in the price of avocados and corn in the US due to bad weather. Apple (AAPL) were under pressure following a Washington Post investigation, which found that many iOS apps use the iPhone’s background refresh feature to send data (such as location and IP address) to third-party tracker companies. Boeing (BA) also moved lower following a flurry of bad headlines, including news that Ethiopian Airlines pilot von Hoesslin told senior managers at the airline that additional training and improved communication to crew members was needed, several months prior to the first Boeing (BA) 737 Max crash. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) shares moved lower against the backdrop of continued public scrutiny, in which the drug maker is facing a large number of court cases for allegedly fuelling the opioid epidemic. Workday (WDAY) shares sunk despite the co beating on both top and bottom lines and revising its FY20 view for subscriptions earnings higher. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) were under lower as an active investor group plans to nominate new board members was thwarted. Arcelor Mittal (MT) shares moved lower after the firm announced plans to reduce production in Europe in line with market demand. Tesla (TSLA) saw choppy price action, moving as much as 2% higher and lower on the day, amidst reports that the electric automaker is to reorganise their operations at their California Gigafactory. S&amp;P 500 -0.7% at 2783, Dow Jones -0.9% at 7217, NASDAQ-100 -0.9% at 25126.</p><p>The T-plex continued its rally during the European session before paring back gains going into settlement. Looking at the curve, the 2s/10s steepened by c. 1.8bps, with the 5s/30s flattening by c. 1bps. The 7-year auction was relatively weak, where it tailed by 1.9bps, above the six-auction average of -0.3bps, and the B/C ratio came in at 2.3x, below the six-auction averages of 2.53x. It is worth highlighting that the high-yield was the lowest it has been since September 2017, coming amidst a sharp rally in bonds in recent sessions. In regard to the breakdown, dealers took a chunky 30%, almost double the six-auction average, with discretionary buyers (indirects/directs) both taking below averages. In the fallout from the auction Treasuries sold off, with newswires attributing dealers as the main sellers as they seek to offload their large holdings. US T-note futures (M9) settled 7+ ticks higher at 125-20.</p>",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP – 29th MAY 2019: BoC removes mention of neutral rate; US adds China to currency watch list",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT:</strong> Equites down, Treasuries flat, Dollar higher, Crude down.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: </strong>BoC hold rates, removes reference to returning to neutral rate, US releases Currency Manipulation report; adds China and others to watchlist, Iran says will not negotiate with the West, EU sends letter to Italy on debt, Plenty of ECB speak (incl. ECB head hopeful Rehn), weak German employment data</p><p><strong>* COMING UP:</strong> AU Building Approvals, SP HICP Flash, US GDP 2nd Estimate, Advanced Goods Trade, Initial Jobless Claims, Weekly Crude Stocks, BoJ’s Sakurai, Fed’s Clarida, BoC’s Wilkins, US VP Pence to meet Canada PM Trudeau on USMCA</p><p><strong>* BOC:</strong> The BOC kept rates unchanged at 1.75%, as was unanimously expected. The key takeaway was that the BOC made no mention of returning rates to neutral in its policy statement (it estimated neutral at between 2.25-3.25% at its previous MPR meeting), signalling that the BOC is now in pause mode. “The Bank had already shifted to the dovish side but the tone of the accompanying statement was a little more optimistic than the April meeting,” Rabobank said, “That said, there was no shift back to a tightening bias and the Bank maintained a data-watch stance.” The general language of the Bank was upbeat, arguing that earlier weakness was temporary; trade restrictions were having an impact on Canadian exports and trade risks have increased, it said. The bank also said current degree of accommodation remains appropriate. Market pricing for the trajectory of BOC rate moves was pretty-much unchanged (around half a rate cut priced by the end of the year). “This meeting did little to alter our view that the BOC is too optimistic about activity prospects looking forward and we maintain the view that the BOC will begin easing in Q2 2020,” Rabo said.</p><p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday that the US is not in a position to decide which countries manipulates currency. This came after the US Treasury said no major trading partner met currency manipulation list but added that China, amongst several others, had been added to the “monitoring list”. In the US, Secretary of State Pompeo said the US may or may not get a trade deal with China, he also said that Huawei is a instrument of the Chinese Government (a well-established US stance). The China Global Times Editor weighed in as usual on the matter, tweeting that the “US is shifting from protecting its interests to destroying China… China is mulling qualitative change in countermeasures.” In an apparent response to the threat that China may weaponize rare earth mineral exports to the US; a Pentagon spokesperson said they had submitted a report on rare-earth minerals to congress and the US will seek to reduce reliance on China.</p><p><strong>* TREASURY SEMI-ANNUAL FX REPORT:</strong> Released a month late, the report did not name any country (China) a currency manipulator. However, it added Ireland, Italy, Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia to its monitoring list, which already includes China, Japan, South Korea and Germany. Switzerland and India have been removed from the monitoring list, as was expected. The Treasury also expanded the number of US trading partners covered in the report from 12 to 21. A key takeaway was that the Treasury adjusted its three criteria for judging whether a nation is a currency manipulator (indeed, the Treasury justified the delay due to changes to the criteria); two of the thresholds that the Treasury uses were revised lower (current account balance criteria lowered to 2%/GDP vs 3% previously), and persistence of net FX purchases (lowered to six out of 12 months vs eight out of 12 months previously). The report, however, unsurprisingly remained critical of China (which only met one of the three criteria), and the nation remains at the top of the monitoring list; The Treasury stated that “China’s persistent and widespread use of non-tariff barriers, non market mechanisms, state subsidies, and other discriminatory measures that are increasingly distorting China’s trading and investment relationships” to “refrain from engaging in competitive devaluation and to not target China’s exchange rate for competitive purposes.” The Treasury recommitted to continuing bilateral engagement with China.</p><p><strong>* UK POLITICS:</strong> UK Judge says MP, and potential PM candidate, Boris Johnson must attend court for a preliminary hearing regarding allegations of misconduct in a public office. This news followed prior reports that Boris Johnson lied &amp; was involved in criminal conduct when he claimed during the 2016 EU Referendum that the UK sent GBP 350mln per week to the EU.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL:</strong> Middle-East tensions were again in the spotlight on Wednesday, US President Trump’s hawkish National Security Advisor Bolton has claimed the recent attacks on Saudi tankers off the UAE were caused by Iranian naval mines, and Iranian Supreme leader Khamenei later threatened the use of military pressure against the US “if needed”. Elsewhere, the US has suggested that Russia is likely conducting low-yield Nuke tests, which if so, would be in violation of the treaty on banning nuclear tests.</p><p><strong>* ITALY:</strong>&nbsp;Tensions between Italy and the EU continue. Early reports suggested that the Five Star Movement was to vote on whether to continue with Di Maio as leader; Di Maio was also reportedly seeking support from Deputy PM Salvini to maintain current government coalition. Italian Deputy PM Salvini commented that he is not in favour of a snap election and wants to work with 5SM but will not accept a situation similar to that of the past few weeks - a sign that he will try and leverage the League's strong performance at the European elections in an effort to change government policy, before he mulls fresh elections. Turning his attention to the EU, regarding a potential EU request for a budget correction, Salvini reiterated that the Italian Government will definitely never increase taxation. Shortly after, the EU sent a letter to Italy, publicly confirming that the country risks disciplinary process due to its debt (this comes in the context of reports on Monday that Italy could face a EUR 3.5bln fine from the European Commission unless they curb their debt levels).</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> The <strong>ECB Financial Stability Report</strong> stated that challenges to financial stability are increasing amid downside risks to the economic outlook, that economic recovery in the Euro area has been delayed but not derailed, and corporate bond markets and liquidity conditions remain fragile despite bond price recovery in 2019. <strong>ECB’s Mersch (Hawkish)</strong> commented that, as central banks should remain true to the core mandate, whilst also saying the capacity to adapt to evolving needs must be retained, but this must not come at the expense of independence or accountability. <strong>ECB's Vice President De Guindos (Neutral)</strong> commented that trade wars are the main threat to the economic environment and that the implementation of counter-cyclical buffers in some countries is appropriate. He said that the problem for Italy is low growth and any controversy between the Govt. and the Commission on fiscal rules is reflected in spreads, and should be respected. Speaking on ECB policy moving forward, <strong>ECB's Rehn (Neutral)</strong> noted that the first hike is further away now than it was a couple of months ago, that the reinvestment of maturing bonds will continue beyond first hike and TLTRO details to be discussed next week. He also noted that an ample degree of monetary policy stimulus is appropriate at present. Rehn said that it is no secret they have discussed the impact of negative rates, but unconventional measures have clearly been positive. On ECB strategy, Rehn said that the ECB should review its monetary policy strategy in the medium and long term, and that at some point a strategy review is needed, but he would not touch the ECB mandate. He said that the ECB needs credible guidance and for it to be backed up if necessary, and suggested that the ECB should look at the definition of price stability as, in his view, 2% is not a ceiling. On trade and the economy, he said that he sees little impact on inflation from trade tensions, and that the Eurozone is seeing a soft patch and doesn't see a recession at the moment. Regarding the idea of the ECB guaranteeing government debt, Rehn noted central banks are forbidden from monetary financing. Finally, Rehn commented that nationality should not play a role in deciding the incoming ECB President. It is worth noting that Rehn is seen as the compromise candidate between Germany and France.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN DATA:</strong> German Unemployment rose to 5.0% in May (from 4.9% in April), higher than the expected 4.9%. Unemployment claims jumped to 60k (from a 12k fall in April), also much higher than the expected 8k fall. Pantheon Macroeconomics comment “the enormous 60K leap in unemployment claims–the biggest since 2009—is partly due to a re-classification of workers” but also but caveat that “the Federal Labor Agency still estimates that unemployment claims, corrected for this one-off hit, rose by 10-to-15K.” This corrected numbers still marks a sharp departure from the expected, which Pantheon does not find surprising. In that regard, the consultancy notes “German GDP growth has slowed sharply in recent quarters; the PMIs have been warning about falling employment in manufacturing and the IAB’s unemployment index has deteriorated. We think today’s report could well be the beginning of a more sustained increase in German jobless claims, though the trend will be have to be corrected for the May headline as we move along.” Regarding the German labour market, Pantheon conclude “the solid German employment picture will not spontaneously combust this year, but the rate of improvement will deteriorate significantly, reflecting the gruelling slowdown in manufacturing.” Of note: Pantheon have warnings for those tempted to buy bonds based on these headlines, saying this may not prove to be the right trade; “If the improving trend in the labour market is now stalling, the government will be pushed even more strongly towards some form of fiscal stimulus and public investment; both of these, presumably, would require debt issuance”.</p><p>* <strong>US T-Note futures (M9) settled 7+ ticks higher at 125-20</strong>: The T-plex continued its rally during the European session before paring back gains going into settlement. Looking at the curve, the 2s/10s steepened by c. 1.8bps, with the 5s/30s flattening by c. 1bps. The 7-year auction was relatively weak, where it tailed by 1.9bps, above the six-auction average of -0.3bps, and the B/C ratio came in at 2.3x, below the six-auction averages of 2.53x. It is worth highlighting that the high-yield was the lowest it has been since September 2017, coming amidst a sharp rally in bonds in recent sessions. In regard to the breakdown, dealers took a chunky 30%, almost double the six-auction average, with discretionary buyers (indirects/directs) both taking below averages. In the fallout from the auction Treasuries sold off, with newswires attributing dealers as the main sellers as they seek to offload their large holdings.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.33 LOWER AT USD 58.81/BBL; BRENT (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.66 LOWER AT USD 69.45/BBL:</strong> Following Tuesday’s indecisiveness regarding the crude market’s direction, a drop-in risk appetite saw it trade decisively in the red through the majority of Wednesday’s session, before paring some losses into settlement. Slowing global growth and a lack of upside demand catalysts have seen Treasury yields continue their march lower, with the 3m/10y exacerbating its inversion, consequentially spooking risk assets. Although less in vogue, there has been some supply-side updates, which ultimately failed to reverse crude’s losses. Iranian crude oil exports have reportedly dropped to 400k BPD in May (vs. 970k BPD in April, although it was said to be producing at a clip of 250K at the beginning of May), however, prior reports suggested tankers were simply turning off their transponders during transit. Elsewhere, following Russia previously expressing discomfort to an extension of the OPEC+ supply cuts, Russian First Deputy PM Anton Siluanov said that the key supplier is now open to the possibility, where it will evaluate the trade-off between higher prices and a loss of market share to the US. It is worth noting that the API US inventory data will be released on Wednesday, a day later due to market closures during Memorial Day. Current expectations see crude stocks drawing 0.9mln bbls; gasoline stocks drawing -0.5mln bbls; distillates building 0.6mln bbls. Elsewhere in the US, WTI front-end contango has been increasing amidst a slew of US pipeline closures as a result of severe flooding in the Mid-West, sparking “predictions of swelling oil stocks at Cushing”, PVM analysts note, elevating risks of a national supply glut just as producers head into key summer runs. If the supply disruptions were to materialise in Cushing stocks, it’s worth noting this would not be evident until next week’s inventory release due to the backward-looking nature of the data.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.7% at 2783, Dow Jones -0.9% at 7217, NASDAQ-100 -0.9% at 25126</strong>; <strong>SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary -0.9%, Consumer Staples -0.7%, Energy&nbsp; -0.6%, Financials -0.1%, Health Care -1%, Industrials -0.5%, Information Technology -0.6%, Materials -0.1%, Telecommunication Services -1.1%, Utilities -1.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Financial names, including Citi Group (C), Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), were broadly lower as yields extended their march lower, with some financial newswires also citing worries about declining trading volumes and economic health. Energy names, including ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP), were also broadly lower, as WTI crude fell on the day. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) moved lower amidst a spike in the price of avocados and corn in the US due to bad weather. Apple (AAPL) were under pressure following a Washington Post investigation, which found that many iOS apps use the iPhone’s background refresh feature to send data (such as location and IP address) to third-party tracker companies. Boeing (BA) also moved lower following a flurry of bad headlines, including news that Ethiopian Airlines pilot von Hoesslin told senior managers at the airline that additional training and improved communication to crew members was needed, several months prior to the first Boeing (BA) 737 Max crash. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) shares moved lower against the backdrop of continued public scrutiny, in which the drug maker is facing a large number of court cases for allegedly fuelling the opioid epidemic. Workday (WDAY) shares sunk despite the co beating on both top and bottom lines and revising its FY20 view for subscriptions earnings higher. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) were under lower as an active investor group plans to nominate new board members was thwarted. Arcelor Mittal (MT) shares moved lower after the firm announced plans to reduce production in Europe in line with market demand. Tesla (TSLA) saw choppy price action, moving as much as 2% higher and lower on the day, amidst reports that the electric automaker is to reorganise their operations at their California Gigafactory.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD: </strong>DXY broke back above the 98.00 handle, with gains capped as the index formed a double top at 98.20. The greenback caught a bid vs Yen on yield differentials as a soft 7-year action triggered USTs to sell off somewhat. <strong>CAD</strong> was weaker on the day, as the market anticipated the BoC to err on the side of dovish; to which the BoC obliged, removing any reference of a return to the neutral range in its statement. <strong>EUR </strong>was under pressure throughout the day; with weak German employment data and warnings from the US that their Iran efforts may face sanctions doing little to help, as well as the backdrop of growing Italy/EU debt tensions (the EU confirming its intentions to look into sanctions). <strong>JPY </strong>was stronger vs the majority of its G10 counterparts (apart from the dollar), as global risk assets sold off. <strong>GBP </strong>followed EUR lower (with guilt yields also reaching fresh 2-year lows). <strong>SEK </strong>was strong as Swedish GDP beat expectations by a wide margin, giving further credence to the Riksbank’s hawkish bias. <strong>NOK</strong>, however, was weaker as the crude complex came off. <strong>ZAR</strong> strengthened on the day, catching a bid in later trade as President Ramaphosa announced a new, smaller cabinet. <strong>BRL</strong> was also strong, breaking back below 4.00 vs USD, with reports that the BCB would be soon announcing capital markets measures as soon as next week supportive.</p>",

Slowing global growth and a lack of upside demand catalysts have seen Treasury yields continue their march lower, with the 3m/10y exacerbating its inversion, consequentially spooking risk assets. Although less in vogue, there has been some supply-side updates, which ultimately failed to reverse crude’s losses. Iranian crude oil exports have reportedly dropped to 400k BPD in May (vs. 970k BPD in April, although it was said to be producing at a clip of 250K at the beginning of May), however, prior reports suggested tankers were simply turning off their transponders during transit. Elsewhere, following Russia previously expressing discomfort to an extension of the OPEC+ supply cuts, Russian First Deputy PM Anton Siluanov said that the key supplier is now open to the possibility, where it will evaluate the trade-off between higher prices and a loss of market share to the US. It is worth noting that the API US inventory data will be released on Wednesday, a day later due to market closures during Memorial Day. Current expectations see crude stocks drawing 0.9mln bbls; gasoline stocks drawing -0.5mln bbls; distillates building 0.6mln bbls. Elsewhere in the US, WTI front-end contango has been increasing amidst a slew of US pipeline closures as a result of severe flooding in the Mid-West, sparking “predictions of swelling oil stocks at Cushing”, PVM analysts note, elevating risks of a national supply glut just as producers head into key summer runs.&nbsp;If the supply disruptions were to materialise in Cushing stocks, it’s worth noting this would not be evident until next week’s inventory release due to the backward-looking nature of the data.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong> The US Treasury will auction a total of USD 131bln in new 2-year (USD 40bln, Tue), new 5-year (USD 41bln, also on Tue), and new 7-year (USD 32bln, Wed), as well as a 2-year FRN re-opening (USD 18bln, Wed). UBS notes that there are USD 81bln of cash flows this week (including USD 73bln of redemptions + USD 8bln of coupons) falling due, implying net supply at around USD 50bln. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* RECENT AUCTIONS: </strong>Have generally been received well, TD Securities notes, even though recent 10-year sale was soft. TD notes that takedown statistics show investment funds continuing to take increasing allotments in recent months (54% of April supply). \"Despite Treasury's decision not to cut coupon auction sizes later this year, we believe the Fed's open market purchases of Treasuries to replace MBS runoff later this year will help buoy the market,\" TD says. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> SocGen says the 7-year sector trades fair on the curve vs 5s and 10s, and trades slightly rich against older 7s from a relative value standpoint. The bank notes that the WI is trading beneath all prior auction high yields since September 2017, which is a negative; and accordingly, will likely need to see concession going into the auction on an outright basis. The previous 7-year auction was poor, tailing. However, dealer holdings in the 6- to 7-year bucket are the lowest since October 2018, and may provide marginal support for the auction. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/3c395fd1-e87a-467f-98a0-5b08089d667a.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi continues to highlight the extent of risk aversion in major currency circles, but has also been undermined by a bleak NZ business outlook via the latest NBNZ survey and cross-flows back into the Aussie that appears to be defying heightened US-China trade jitters or at least the bulk of the anxiety. Indeed, Nzd/Usd<strong> </strong>is inching nearer 0.6500 from just over 0.6550, and Aud/Nzd is extending its rebound from around 1.0575 to circa 1.0625 as Aud/Usd holds closer to the middle of its 0.6912-31 range. Conversely, the Loonie breached support between 1.3521-24 to test psychological resistance and offers in the 1.3550 area post-BoC and removal of the line about returning to a neutral rate before fading and perhaps reflecting on other more encouraging elements of the accompanying statement. To recap, the benchmark rate was maintained at 1.75%, as universally expected and the BoC contended that recent data has reinforced the governing council’s view that the late 2018 slowdown was temporary, while headline inflation is seen staying around target in coming months and core measures also remain close to the 2% goal. On the flip-side, trade restrictions are having direct effect on Canadian exports and as risks on this front have risen the current level of policy accommodation is deemed appropriate.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency finally filled stops through 1.1150 vs the Dollar, but was also undermined by weaker than expected German jobs data (even allowing for classification changes), ongoing Italian political and fiscal issues, alongside a test of 0.8800 against Sterling around the Frankfurt fix before oaring some losses ahead of 1.1135 support in Eur/Usd.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the Pound pivoted 1.2650 and benefited from the aforementioned Euro cross move, but remained hampered by the ongoing UK political hiatus and related interlude in Brexit bargaining into the October 31st Article 50 deadline. Meanwhile, the Franc retreated from 1.0050 and Yen faltered ahead of 109.00 where 1 bn expiries sat and extended to 109.15, as the Buck also derived impetus from a degree of safe-haven demand - <strong>DXY</strong> back over 98.000 and inching closer to 2019 peaks set last week (98.373 vs 98.127 at best so far today).</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Mixed fortunes for the Scandi Crowns as Eur/Nok rebounded to 9.7750+ amidst another retreat in oil prices, but Eur/Sek was capped around 10.7000 after significantly stronger than forecast Swedish Q1 GDP data (largely due to a healthy export contribution vs depressed domestic consumption however).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>A broad sea of red across the region on a mixture of usual and well documented negative factors, but the Real bucked the broad bearish trend awaiting pension reform bill progress and details of a forthcoming growth pact pencilled for signing during the week starting June 10th. However, Usd/Brl also held below the 4.0000 marker after the BcB announced capital measures to be unveiled next week.</p>",

Nzd/Usd has slipped back below 0.6550 to around 0.6515, with the Aud/Nzd cross climbing over 1.0600 again even though the Aussie is also struggling to retain 0.6900+ status following yet another uber dovish RBA call overnight as JPM is now predicting a total of 100 bp worth of easing by mid-2020. Elsewhere, the Loonie is really trading on the defensive as the clock ticks down to a potentially dovish BoC with Usd/Cad not far from 1.3520+ late April peaks and options pricing a circa 53 pip break-even over the event – see our policy meeting preview on the Research Suite. Meanwhile, Cable is slipping further from 1.2700 towards the big figure below as another Tory leadership hopeful joins the list and the EU stresses no renegotiation of the WA, and Eur/Usd is hovering just above 1.1150 stops having failed to hold above the 30 DMA (1.1191) again. Note, a shock jump in German unemployment and uptick in the jobless rate that was only partly mitigated by a reclassification of the labour force also weighed on the Euro as noted above.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Divergence between the Scandi Crowns as Eur/Nok rebounds through 9.7500 amidst another retreat in oil prices (that may also be niggling the Cad), but Eur/Sek is capped around 10.7000 after significantly stronger than forecast Swedish Q1 GDP data (largely due to a healthy export contribution vs depressed domestic consumption however).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the Lira and Rand as well, like yesterday, as Usd/Try revisits 6.0000, but Usd/Zar pivots 14.8000 within 14.8900-7000 parameters on a further fall-out from SA political developments and the return of Mabuza to Ramaphosa’s fold.</p>",

However, it added Ireland, Italy, Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia to its monitoring list, which already includes China, Japan, South Korea and Germany. Switzerland and India have been removed from the monitoring list, as was expected. The Treasury also expanded the number of US trading partners covered in the report from 12 to 21.&nbsp;</li><li>A key takeaway was that the Treasury adjusted its three criteria for judging whether a nation is a currency manipulator (indeed, the Treasury justified the delay due to changes to the criteria); two of the thresholds that the Treasury uses were revised lower (current account balance criteria lowered to 2%/GDP vs 3% previously), and persistence of net FX purchases (lowered to six out of 12 months vs eight out of 12 months previously).&nbsp;</li><li>The report, however, unsurprisingly remained critical of China (which only met one of the three criteria), and the nation remains at the top of the monitoring list; The Treasury stated that “China’s persistent and widespread use of non-tariff barriers, nonmarket mechanisms, state subsidies, and other discriminatory measures that are increasingly distorting China’s trading and investment relationships” to “refrain from engaging in competitive devaluation and to not target China’s exchange rate for competitive purposes.” The Treasury recommitted to continuing bilateral engagement with China.</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/585dea03-0ebb-483f-8a94-64a0c10a6211.jpg\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/b3e9d7d7-9e8a-48d8-b21a-50f0ab13c0a3.jpg\"></figure><p><i>Source: UOB</i></p>",

The weakness was attributed to lingering trade tensions after Chinese press pointed the blame on US for the recent breakdown in talks and as the outspoken Global Times Editor suggested China is seriously considering restricting rare earth exports to the US. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.8%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-1.3%)</strong> were negative with broad weakness seen across nearly all sectors in Australia and with financials subdued by the recent declines in global yields, while currency strength added to the pressures for Tokyo stocks. <strong>Hang Seng (-0.5%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) </strong>declined amid the trade uncertainty and as early data indicators reportedly suggested China’s economy weakened this month, although the losses were cushioned by a substantial liquidity operation of CNY 270bln which resulted to the PBoC’s largest daily net injection since mid-January. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked the upside in global counterparts amid declining yields and the negative risk sentiment, which lifted prices of the Japanese 10yr benchmark to above 153.00 and its best level since early April.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 270bln via 7-day reverse repos for a daily net injection of CNY 250bln.

Elsewhere, the risk averse tone dampened <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and early upside in antipodeans was thwarted as the Australian 10yr yield dropped below the RBA Cash Rate Target of 1.5% and with JPMorgan calling for 4 rate cuts by the RBA to 0.50% by mid-2020, while <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was lacklustre after the RBNZ Financial Stability Report proved to be a non-event and as Business Confidence data remained at a contraction. <strong>CNH</strong> also marginally softened as the PBoC continued to set the mid-point closer towards 6.9000 and after the US Treasury released its long-awaited currency report in which it refrained from naming any countries as currency manipulators but placed 9 in its monitoring list including China (others included Ireland, Italy, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea and Germany; Switzerland and India were removed) which it urged to avoid a persistently weak currency.</p><p><strong>RBNZ Financial Stability Report said the financial system remains resilient to a broad range of economic risks but added that risks remain elevated and are largely unchanged in the past 6 months</strong>. Furthermore, it stated that there is a need for some insurers and non-bank deposit takers to improve capital buffers and that current LVR settings remain appropriate, while further easing in LVR is subject to continuing subdued credit and house price growth.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly lower following the headwinds from US where all major indices declined on return from the extended weekend and in which the Emini S&amp;P eventually broke below the 2800 level. The weakness was attributed to lingering trade tensions as Chinese press pointed the blame on US for the recent breakdown in talks and with the outspoken Global Times Editor suggesting China is seriously considering restricting rare earth exports to the US. ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) are negative with broad weakness seen across nearly all sectors in Australia and with financials subdued by the recent declines in global yields, while currency strength adds to the pressures for Tokyo stocks. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) also declined amid the trade uncertainty and as early data indicators reportedly suggest China’s economy weakened this month, although the losses are somewhat cushioned by a substantial liquidity injection by the PBoC of CNY 270bln which resulted to the largest daily net injection since mid-January.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is steady overnight but remains within close proximity to retest the 98.00 level to the upside after having found support from better than expected US Consumer Confidence data, while its major counterparts are subdued after EUR/USD and GBP/USD recently failed in their attempts to reclaim the 1.1200 and 1.2700 handles respectively. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is dampened by the risk averse tone and early upside in antipodeans was thwarted as the Australian 10yr yield dropped below the RBA Cash Rate Target of 1.5% and with JPMorgan calling for 4 rate cuts by the RBA to 0.50% by mid-2020, while NZD/USD is lacklustre after the RBNZ Financial Stability Report proved to be a non-event and as Business Confidence data remained at a contraction. CNH is also marginally softer after the PBoC continued to set the mid-point closer towards 6.9000 and after the US Treasury released its long-awaited currency report in which it refrained from naming any countries as currency manipulators but placed 9 in its monitoring list including China which it urged to avoid a persistently weak currency.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track the upside in global counterparts amid declining yields and the negative risk sentiment, which has lifted prices of the Japanese 10yr benchmark to above 153.00 and its best level since early April.</p>",
