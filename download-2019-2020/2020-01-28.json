BoJ also maintained forward guidance that rates will remain at current or lower levels for as long as needed to guard against risk momentum for hitting price target may be lost, but suggested that downside risks regarding overseas economies eased somewhat which was likely due to recent US-China Phase 1 signing. Furthermore, the central bank's views on inflation remain subdued and far from the 2% target, although it upgraded growth forecasts in the Outlook Report which was not much of a surprise given the surge in growth for Q3 and after the Japan announced a JPY 13.2tln economic package last month.</p>",

There have been some suggestions that a vaccine for the Coronavirus is in the pipeline, possibly ready within a three-month window. Additionally, some desks noted that business television spent a lot of the day talking about 'when to buy the dip'. There was also support on the data front, after a solid consumer confidence report, and sharp rises in the Richmond Fed's manufacturing gauge; the headline durable goods data was good, but internals were soft. In terms of earnings, 3M (MMM) underperformed in the DJ following a rather dismal report which missed on EPS and revenue, whilst also providing disappointing guidance. MMM also announced structural changes where it will cut up to 1500 jobs. United Technologies (UTX) traded higher following top and bottom line beats. Pfizer (PFE) were hit after EPS missed estimates and FY20 EPS forecasts were slightly light than the analyst mid-point expectations. Lockheed Martin (LMT) traded marginally higher following an EPS beat, although revenue missed expectations. Guidance however was firmer than expectations on revenue, but short on EPS. Mylan (MYL) rose after Pfizer (PFE) CEO announced the combination of MYL and Upjohn to create a global Pharmaceutical company will close this year. Apple (AAPL) saw gains of ~3% ahead of its figures tonight following reports it asked suppliers to ready for an increase in iPhone production by 10% in H1, however suppliers have stated it may face difficulties with this due to the Coronavirus spreading across China, according to Nikkei.

It helped the 2s5s and 3m/10-year spreads to both go positive, having briefly inverting in the last 24hrs. A more constructive risk tone was cited. The US Treasury sold 7-year notes, tailing 0.4bps (the 2s, 5s, and 7s auctions have all tailed this week), though cover was in line with recent averages. The internals were more or less in line with recent averages; Directs took 17.2% against recent average of 15.7%; indirects took 58.1% against an average of 61.5%, while dealers were left with 24.7% against recent average of 22.7%.

Strong consumer confidence and Richmond Fed; Reports of vaccines for coronavirus ease some tensions, although cases continue to rise. UK gives Huawei the go ahead on its non-core assets.</li><li><strong>COMING UP:</strong> <strong>Data &amp; Events: </strong>Fed Rate Decision; US Pending Home Sales and Advanced Goods Trade Balance; Australian CPI; New Zealand Trade Balance.</li></ul><p><strong>* MARKETS WRAP: </strong>The tone of trading was more constructive on Tuesday, with equities firming and bonds selling off; gold also saw downside, while the crude complex is also a touch firmer. There have been some suggestions that a vaccine for the Coronavirus is in the pipeline, possibly ready within a three-month window. Additionally, some desks noted that business television spent a lot of the day talking about 'when to buy the dip'. There was also support on the data front, after a solid consumer confidence report, and sharp rises in the Richmond Fed's manufacturing gauge; the headline durable goods data was good, but internals were soft. The tone of earnings was mixed; MMM, PFE weren't great, although LMT and HCA were good. After market, tech giant AAPL, EBAY, AMD, SBUX are on the slate. Casting our attention slightly ahead, MSFT and FOMC are the highlights for Wednesday.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>A lot more new cases have been reported on Tuesday, however, the panic seems to have eased, judging by the performance of equities (up) and bonds today (down). Perhaps market jitters have been soothed by reports in Chinese press that Hong Kong researchers have already developed a vaccine for the coronavirus, but need time to test it, according to the SCMP. Meanwhile, the Global Times, also citing academics, reported that China was likely to have a vaccine for public use within three months, which will include a month and a half of development and a month and half of testing.</p><p><strong>* DURABLE GOODS (DEC): </strong>It was a mixed durable goods report, with the headline at 2.4% M/M, above the consensus 0.4%. However, the breakdown was less encouraging, and there were downward revisions to many of the metrics. Pantheon Macroeconomics said the headline was driven by the hit to civilian aircraft orders (Boeing BA received orders for just three aircraft in December, vs an average of 234 over the previous five Decembers) which was offset by a bigger rebound in orders for defense aircraft orders than we expected, while transportation orders ex-aircraft and autos jumped unexpectedly by 14.2%. Pantheon says that no details of the latter are provided in the report, but the jump looks like noise, and will likely reverse. The consultancy also notes that the strong rise in the headline masks the weaker details, noting that orders for non-defense capital goods down 0.9%, the worst performance since April. \"The monthly numbers are noisy, though, and the trend is drifting down slowly, much less bad than the rollover implied by business surveys,\" Pantheon says, \"this story seems unlikely to change much in the near future.\"</p><p><strong>* CONSUMER CONFIDENCE (JAN): </strong>Consumer Confidence jumped in January to 131.6 against an expected 128.0, while the previous reading was revised up to 128.2 from 126.5. The 1-year consumer inflation expectations rose one-tenth to 4.5%, while the differential between jobs 'plentiful' and jobs 'hard to get' was 37.4 in Jan (prev. 33.9 in December from 31.6 in November), auguring well for the upcoming jobs report. ING said the data was excellent, and now close to all-time highs. \"This is understandable given record low unemployment, record high home and equity prices and the lowest national gasoline prices since last March, though adds that weak wage growth and global health worries may limit the transmission to spending.</p><p><strong>* UK HUAWEI DECISION: </strong>UK Government have given permission for Huawei to construct non-core sections of the UK telecom network, has been designated a high-risk vendor; have a market share cap of 35% and excluded from sensitive geographic locations. The decision by the UK to let Huawei take part in the UK’s 5G infrastructure comes in line with UK press reports. With the Chinese telecom giant now allowed to build parts of the 'non-critical' infrastructure for the network, focus shifts towards any potential strains on UK-US relations. The decision will likely be met with disappointment by the Trump administration with this sentiment likely to be echoed by US Secretary of State Pompeo, while will be visiting London tomorrow. UBS highlights that Republicans in Congress believe that the decision means that co-operation on security between the two nations needs to be re-calibrated in order to protect US interests. Those taking an even more hawkish view could be inclined to cast doubts over the viability of a US-UK free trade deal. Note, PM Johnson will travel to Washington next week for the commencement of trade talks, however, UBS suggests that President Trump could be more inclined to exert pressure on contentious bilateral issues such as Huawei, Iran or digital taxation rather than discussion options for a trade deal. Ahead of that visit, there have already been reports that US Politicians are 'furious' at the UK's decision on Huawei with some suggesting they 'could take a harder line in post-Brexit trade negotiations as a result.'</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLED USD /BBL AT USD /BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD AT USD /BBL:</strong> Prices found some upward relief on Tuesday following a slew of daily losses in the oil benchmarks, of late. Coronavirus is still an issue, however, perceptions of downside seem to have at least temporarily abated on Tuesday. There was an initial bout of strength in the European session after OPEC sources reported that the group is reportedly discussing extending its oil output cuts until at least June and could deepen the cuts if prices and demand falls on the spread of the coronavirus – Citigroup adds that it believes an extension was necessary to maintain balance in the physical market even without the expected weakening in demand, but now sees potential for stronger/earlier commitments ahead of the March 5-6 summit in Vienna. The crude complex found its second wind on the US cash equity open, alongside the major bourses, as participants further pared back some of Monday’s risk off tone. As attention wanes somewhat from the coronavirus, this week’s US energy inventories come into view; current expectations (bbls): crude +0.5mln, gasoline +1.3mln, distillates -1.1mln and Genscape forecast Cushing at -0.87mln. NOTE: Brent options for March expire at today’s settlement.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLE 9 TICKS LOWER AT 130-19+. </strong>Yields were higher across the curve by between 2.5-4.5bps, at settlement, with the shape of the curve marginally steeper. It helped the 2s5s and 3m/10-year spreads to both go positive, having briefly inverting in the last 24hrs. A more constructive risk tone was cited. The US Treasury sold 7-year notes, tailing 0.4bps (the 2s, 5s, and 7s auctions have all tailed this week), though cover was in line with recent averages. The internals were more or less in line with recent averages; Directs took 17.2% against recent average of 15.7%; indirects indirects took 58.1% against an average of 61.5%, while dealers were left with 24.7% against recent average of 22.7%.</p><p><strong>* ECB: ECB's de Cos</strong> said it is a priority for countries with high debt and structural deficit to get their public finances in order, but countries with fiscal room could contribute with fiscal stimulus to support their economies. De Cos adder that there is an urgent need to find a solution to the WTO's current impasse.</p><p><strong>* FOMC PREVIEW: </strong>Rates are seen unchanged at 1.50-1.75%. Officials appear comfortable with the current stance, though markets still see a rate cut in 2020. A 'technical' IOER hike is possible. No SRF announcement expected, details sought. No SEP update until March. The narrative may be more pertinent for longer-term themes like balance sheet policy and the framework review. Meanwhile, perceptions about the Fed's commitment to accommodation may be a catalyst for any price moves. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23720/download\">To download the report, please click here.</a></p><p><strong>* STOCK CLOSES: </strong>SPX +1% AT 3276; DOW +0.65% AT 28722; NDX +1.55% AT 9091.</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Cons Disc +1%, Cons Staples +0.01, Energy +0.4%, Financials +1.1%, Health +0.5%, Industrials +0.6%, Materials +1%, Technology +1.9%, Communications +1.2%, Utilities +0.4%.</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS STOCKS:</strong> Macau exposed casino names (LVS, WYNN, MLCO) are under watch as the confirmed cases rise to seven from five, yesterday. Elsewhere, integrated resort operators are reportedly rolling out lengthy lists of closures to help prevent the spreading of the virus, according to Inside Asia Gaming. Elsewhere, pharmaceutical names, AbbVie (ABBV), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Gilead (GILD) are among companies that have begun shipping HIV approved drugs to test against the Coronavirus, according to WSJ. During trade, it was also announced that JNJ has begun developing a coronavirus vaccine. Of note for airlines, GS analysts highlight United Airlines (UAL) has highest exposure to China and Hawaiian Holding (HA) has most exposure to total Pacific and East Asia. However, given the heavy sell-off yesterday some names have pared back some of the losses, with AAL trading ~1% higher following a 5% fall yesterday. Also of note, UAL suspended some flights between hub cities and Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai due to a poor demand for China travel.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> 3M (MMM) underperformed in the DJ following a rather dismal report which missed on EPS and revenue, whilst also providing disappointing guidance. MMM also announced structural changes where it will cut up to 1500 jobs. United Technologies (UTX) traded higher following top and bottom line beats. Pfizer (PFE) were hit after EPS missed estimates and FY20 EPS forecasts were slightly light than the analyst mid-point expectations. Lockheed Martin (LMT) traded marginally higher following an EPS beat, although revenue missed expectations. Guidance however was firmer than expectations on revenue, but short on EPS. The revenue breakdown for LMT was strong, which beat expectations across Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire control, Rotary and Mission Systems, and Space. Juniper (JNPR) were hit on slightly weak Q1 20 guidance. McCormick (MKC) traded in the red following poor FY20 guidance. Over in Europe, tech giant SAP (SAP GY) disappointed following a slight miss in revenue and operating profit, however EPS was strong, and it lifted guidance. LVMH (MC FP, LVMUY) ADR’s saw choppy price action following the release which seemed positive at first, however, its revenue organic growth rose less than expected.</p><p><strong>* STOCK-SPECIFICS:</strong> Mylan (MYL) rose after Pfizer (PFE) CEO announced the combination of MYL and Upjohn to create a global Pharmaceutical company will close this year. Apple (AAPL) saw gains of ~3% ahead of its figures tonight following reports it asked suppliers to ready for an increase in iPhone production by 10% in H1, however suppliers have stated it may face difficulties with this due to the Coronavirus spreading across China, according to Nikkei.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> traded slightly firmer yet again amid firm stateside data, DXY crossed 98 to the upside, a figure it is just under heading into APAC trade. <strong>CNH</strong> found some support as reports crept in regarding potential vaccines for the coronavirus. <strong>EURUSD</strong> bounced of the 1.10 figure after falling in the morning before ending the session flat. <strong>GBPUSD</strong> similarly after a foray sub-1.30, sterling has recovered the figure ahead of Thursday’s BOE, where markets are still expecting the rate decision to be a coin toss. <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong> pared back some of the prior day gains following the prior day safe haven bid, with USDJPY back above 109; real rates were a contributing factor to the XAU downside. Antipodes have pared losses to trade just shy of flat ahead of the close, with the AUD remaining under 0.68 and NZD beneath 0.66. <strong>EMFX</strong> was generally firmer against the buck, with <strong>TRY</strong> the relative underperformer as oil prices pick up from the prior days decline, which in turn saw <strong>RUB</strong> strength, despite weak retail and wage data. <strong>MXN</strong> firmer amid a wider trade surplus.</p>",

Analysts are drawing attention to its iPhone 11, in addition to its popular Air Pods, as expected growth drivers, in addition to indication on the strength of its Apple TV+ service post-launch.

Elsewhere, RBC Capital’s Muller (“Outperform” rating, USD 330 PT) cites his data checks suggesting estimates for Q1 are reasonable, whilst highlighting a slight beat on consensus figures could be seen due to strength in iPhone and wearables sales. Meanwhile, Atlantic Equities’ Cordwell (“Underweight”, USD 275) believes upside potential from the 5G expansion has been “more than fully priced in” and believes services and wearables lack upside momentum and iPhone ASP pressure could cause revenue disappointment.</p>",

Coronavirus is still an issue, however, perceptions of downside seem to have at least temporarily abated on Tuesday. There was an initial bout of strength in the European session after OPEC sources reported that the group is reportedly discussing extending its oil output cuts until at least June and could deepen the cuts if prices and demand falls on the spread of the coronavirus – Citigroup adds that it believes an extension was necessary to maintain balance in the physical market even without the expected weakening in demand, but now sees potential for stronger/earlier commitments ahead of the March 5-6 summit in Vienna. The crude complex found its second wind on the US cash equity open, alongside the major bourses, as participants further pared back some of Monday’s risk off tone. As attention wanes somewhat from the coronavirus, this week’s US energy inventories come into view; current expectations (bbls): crude +0.5mln, gasoline +1.3mln, distillates -1.1mln and Genscape forecast Cushing at -0.87mln.

It will also auction a new 2-year FRN (USD 20bln, Tuesday). UBS says this week will cashflows of around USD 93bln (ex SOMA holdings, including around USD 84bln of redemptions, and around USD 9bln of coupons), implying net cashflows are around flat.</p><p><strong>7-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The current 7-year is trading fair on asset swap against older 7s, SocGen observes, though the bank feels it trades rich on the fly against 5s and 10s. The WI yield is trading above recent stop-out rates, suggesting it trades rich on an outright basis vs previous cycles. With that said, SocGen notes that the last four 7s auctions have been digested well, seeing strong foreign participation, and SocGen thinks that this strong demand may help to offset some of the richness within the sector. The bank has a neutral bias heading into the auction, but notes demand might be affected by Wednesday's FOMC meeting.</p><ul><li><strong>7-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:</strong></li><li>High-yield: (prev. 1.835%, six-auction average 1.717%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -0.8bps, six-auction avg. 0.3bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.47x, six-auction avg. 2.38x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 17.1%, six-auction avg. 22.7%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 23.4%, six-auction avg. 15.7%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 59.4%, six-auction avg. 61.5%)</li></ul>",

However, Sterling subsequently lost grip of the 1.3000 handle vs the Dollar without any further Eur/Gbp upside and when Eur/Usd dipped briefly below 1.1000, as UK PM Johnson confirmed restricted 5G access to Huawei and the probability of a BoE rate cut on Thursday remains just above 50%.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In stark contrast, Greenback strength has been pretty persistent and widespread on the back of China’s escalating coronavirus and increased efforts to contain the outbreak. Indeed, the <strong>DXY </strong>is forming a firmer base above the 98.000 handle and was not unduly rattled by typically mixed US durable goods or revisions before better than expected consumer confidence ahead of the Fed on Wednesday – full preview of the first FOMC policy meeting of 2020 available on our Research Suite.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>All underperforming against the Buck, and perhaps somewhat perversely or counterintuitively as reports emerged about various vaccines for the virus that could be ready within months. This undermined the safest havens, with the Franc reversing sharply below 0.9700 and Yen back under 109.00 after contrasting Swiss trade data and running into resistance ahead of a key Fib at 108.66 respectively. However, the Aussie and Kiwi failed to derive much comfort off multi-week lows circa 0.6738 and 0.6522, as Aud/Usd eyes Q4 CPI hot on the heels of weak NAB business confidence and conditions, while Nzd/Usd awaits trade metrics for December after the Fed.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Loonie and Norwegian Crown appear to have gleaned some support/traction from a rebound in oil to pare losses from sub-1.3200 vs the Buck and 10.1150+ against the Euro, but mainly a bit less investor angst over the Chinese health issue that lifted some of the market gloom broadly, while the Swedish Crown also rebounded from early lows vs the single currency after inconclusive macro releases and containing declines through a Fib in advance of the 200 DMA.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The aforementioned better virus news (comparatively speaking) also helped the Yuan stop the rot (for now at least), as Usd/Cnh was capped ahead of 7.0000, while the Mexican Peso found some solace in wider trade surpluses. However, the Hungarian Forint revisited Monday’s record lows after a dovish NBH hold and the Rouble shrugged off softer than forecast Russian retail sales and real wages in favour of the recovery in crude prices.</p>",

Conversely, Gold has handed back some of yesterday’s gains, but remains relatively well bid within a tight Usd1577-1583/oz range and technically bullish around 20 Bucks over last Friday’s circa Usd1566.62 low.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The major losers on a combination of contagion from China and cross flows for month end as the Aussie teeters around 0.6750 and not far from deeper troughs posted last October ahead of 0.6700, Kiwi hovers close to the base of 0.6550-22 parameters and Sterling skirts 1.3000. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are still inversely correlated to moves in Usd/Cnh-Cny on breaking virus updates in the absence of official daily PBoC settings during the Lunar New Year break, with the Yuan inching nearer the 7.0000 mark again having reached peaks beyond 6.8500 only 8 days ago on the crest of the Phase 1 trade deal signing. Meanwhile, Cable is trading cautiously into Thursday’s BoE/MPC rate announcement and Brexit the day after, as market contacts note RHS interest in Eur/Gbp for month end that has lifted cross through 0.8450.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The Euro has survived another test of bids/support into the 1.1000 level, partly on the purported orders for January 31 noted above, but perhaps also benefiting from the common currency’s semi-safe haven status, while the Loonie has extended losses alongside the Norwegian Krona amidst yet another decline in crude prices. Usd/Cad has absorbed more offers at 1.3200, though not all and supply is said to be stacked up to 1.3210, while Eur/Nok has been up to 10.1155 and higher than Eur/Sek in percentage terms after mixed Swedish data in the form of retail sales, trade and ppi saw the latter briefly breach a Fib (10.6121), but not really threaten the 200 DMA (circa 10.6400).</p>",

(Telegraph)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> held on to the prior day’s gains near the 98.00 level after having recently surmounted its 200DMA, although overnight price momentum for the greenback has petered out heading closer to Wednesday’s FOMC and with reports suggesting Senate Republicans are warming to the idea of calling former National Security Adviser Bolton to testify at the impeachment trial. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was subdued within the tight range seen so far this week, not helped by the softer than expected German IFO data, and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> traded choppy around 1.3050 as it bided time prior to the key events later this week including the BoE meeting and Brexit date. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses languished on the widespread risk averse tone although the former made several attempts to regain a footing on the 109.00 handle, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> were lacklustre owing to their high-beta statuses and the China-related concerns.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were uneventful overnight in which price action consolidated following yesterday’s risk-driven moves which kept oil&nbsp; subdued, although Brent crude and WTI crude futures are off their lows and just about reclaimed the USD 59.00/bbl and USD 53.00/bbl levels respectively.

Elsewhere, gold proceeded sideways and held on to the spoils of the recent safe-haven flows, while copper languished on the broad regional equity sell-off although has found a base around the 2.60/lb level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Venezuela is mulling privatizing its oil industry amid its financial struggles, with names touted including Repsol, Eni and Rosneft, according to sources. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Barclays suggested that if the 2003 SARS outbreak is any indication, the market has likely overreacted to the coronavirus partly due to stretched positioning and the lacklustre global macroeconomic backdrop, while it expects transitory oil demand erosion of about 0.6-0.8mln BPD in Q1 or 0.2mln BPD for FY20 and sees USD 2/bbl downside to their FY forecast for WTI and Brent of USD 57/bbl and USD 62/bbl respectively in which it cited compounding effects of spillover to growth from China and region.

Yesterday's price action was a result of the Coronavirus updates, which are beginning to weigh on perceptions of global growth. The US sold 2-year and 5-year notes, the latter tailing by 0.1bps at the lowest yield since August 2017, while the 5-year sale was weak, tailing by 1.1bps.

ASX 200 (-1.3%) is subdued with the energy and mining related sectors leading the declines in Australia amid concerns of the impact to demand and growth from the virus epidemic, although gold stocks buck the trend due to the recent safe-haven bid and with defensives also showing some resilience amid the downturn. Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) is also weighed by the outbreak concerns in which the number of confirmed cases in China increased to 4515 and total deaths at 106, considering that the Chinese account for around 30% of foreign tourists to Japan, while KOSPI (-3.3%) and Singapore Straits (-2.6%) have slumped in their first trading session following the Lunar New Year and react to the increased number of virus cases confirmed in China and their individual countries.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY holds on to the prior day’s gains near the 98.00 level after having recently surmounted its 200DMA, although overnight price momentum for the greenback has since petered out heading closer to Wednesday’s FOMC and with reports suggesting some Senate Republicans are warming to the idea of calling former National Security Adviser Bolton to testify in the impeachment trial. EUR/USD is subdued within the tight range seen so far this week, not helped by the softer than expected German IFO data, and GBP/USD is choppy around 1.3050 as it bides time prior the key events later this week including the BoE meeting and Brexit date. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses languish on the widespread risk averse tone although the former is attempting to reclaim a footing on the 109.00 handle, while antipodeans are lacklustre owing to their high-beta statuses and China-related concerns.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs remain afloat due to the sell-off across regional stocks, although the gains are limited for JGBs following its recent extended rally and as participants await the 40yr auction.</p>",
