PayPal (PYPL) rose throughout the session with reports that the payments technology co. would make a USD 500mln investment in Uber as part of the ride-hailing co’s upcoming IPO.

Y/Y PCE was short of consensus at 1.6% (exp. 1.7%); Pantheon says this will not have gone unnoticed at the Fed; the consultancy thinks it is most likely noise than it is a signal, \"but the Y/Y rate is unlikely to rise much before late summer and could easily dip further in the meantime,\" and \"if the Fed hikes this year, it will be because of accelerating wages, not the inflation rate at the time.\"</p><p><strong>* FED PREVIEW:</strong> FOMC to leave rates unchanged on 1 May (decision due 1900 BST/1400 EDT, ahead of the press conference with Chair Powell at 1930 BST/1430 EDT); The Fed will not publish new economic projections at this meeting (SEP next released in June). The market will be watching whether the Fed outlines conditions that might compel the Committee to discuss lowering rates. There are some risks that the Fed might tweak its statement to reflect stronger growth and softer inflation since the last meeting. There is also a possibility the Fed could lower its IOER rate. The Committee’s tone is likely to remain one of patience and data dependence. To download the report, please click here.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE TALKS:</strong> US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that the US is approaching the final laps of trade talks. NEC Director Kudlow weighed in, reiterating his ‘cautious’ optimism that a deal would agree upon and that the next two weeks should give clarity on the status of the talks. Elsewhere, trade talks are being conducted in their respective dialects, and a text of the agreement between the two sides will be published in both Chinese and English, SCMP reports. Lawyers will then parse through both texts in an effort to reach a final draft both sides are happy with, though analysts note that this can often prove to be very tricky. The US, however, is keen to avoid the uncertainties, since it seeks a unilateral mechanism to determine if China is abiding by the terms of any agreement.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLES USD 0.20 HIGHER AT USD /BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLES USD LOWER AT USD /BBL.</strong> Crude markets are consolidating (WTI above USD 63.00and Brent above USD 72) as Russia resumes exports of Urals on the Druzhba pipeline, after an outage due to contamination issues last week.&nbsp; \"Friday’s price drop and last week’s increase in US commercial crude oil inventories to the highest level since November 2017 have dampened bullish sentiment for now, but full imposition of US sanctions on Iranian crude oil exports and the broader worry over declining OPEC+ total supply remains supportive,\" Citi said, and the bank suggests that market may also be seeing some book squaring as June Brent, May heating oil, and May RBOB gasoline futures all expire on Tuesday. In news, an Iranian official said US sanctions will destabilise global oil markets; the Chief commander of Iran's Quds force has argued that talks with US are impossible. In Iraq, southern oil exports is averaging 3.33mln BPD in April mtd (vs 3.25mln BPD in March). In Nigeria, Shell declared a force majeure on exports of Bonny Light after a pipeline closure.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.1% at 2943, NDX +0.2% at 7839, DJI +0.0% at 26554.

Tesla (TSLA) moved higher throughout the session, shrugging off reports that bankers were becoming increasingly concerned over the automaker’s finances, as markets digested the news of CEO Musk coming to an agreement with the SEC, where his tweeting of sensitive information will be vetted. PayPal (PYPL) rose throughout the session with reports that the payments technology co. would make a USD 500mln investment in Uber as part of the ride-hailing co’s upcoming IPO. Archer Daniel’s Midland (ADM) shares rose after BMO lifted its rating to outperform. American Airlines (AAL) shares were buoyed after the airline was upgraded to buy at Deutsche Bank. Adobe (ADBE) shares moved higher on the back of a broker upgrade from Morgan Stanley. NXP (NXPI) Occidental (OXY) fell after Anadarko (APC) stated its intent to resume talks with the energy co, as their offer could be ‘superior’ to Chevron’s (CVX), but added that the Chevron deal remains intact for now. Anadarko traded mixed but ultimately finished higher, as did Chevron. Disney (DIS) traded lower despite key franchise Avengers setting box office records at the weekend. Take Two (TTWO) shares caught a bid after Stephens added the video game maker to its Best Idea list and raised their profit target by USD 10 whilst dropping EA (EA) as a sector best idea. Financials names (JPM, GS, BAC, WFC, MS) outperformed, with analysts citing the US curve bear-steepening.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 7+ TICKS LOWER 123-14 AT.</strong> The US Treasury curve bear-steepened on Monday, ahead of key event risk in the week (including FOMC, NFP, ISM, as well as key data on the other side of the Atlantic). While the M/M Personal Spending data came in ahead of expectations, the PCE components - the Fed's preferred gauge - disappointed, and has softened for the third straight month going into Wednesday's FOMC. Meanwhile, the US Treasury has cut its borrowing estimate for Q2, and now expects to issue USD 30bln in net marketable debt in Q2 (prev. estimate was USD 83bln), and also says it expects to issue 160bln in net marketable debt in Q3. It borrowed USD 374bln in Q1. Overnight China PMIs will be looked at for further stabilisation out of the world's second largest economy, while EZ Q1 advanced data will be the focus in early trade.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong>; DXY was unable to hold above the 98.00 handle as core PCE figures came in below expectations, raising the bar for Fed hawkishness at the policy meeting this week. <strong>EUR</strong> edged higher on the day, largely shrugging off underwhelming sentiment data, with desks citing eurozone relief regarding a lack of surprises in the Spanish elections and Italy avoiding a downgrade. <strong>GBP</strong>, having regained the 1.2900 handle, traded relatively flat and was unresponsive to source reports that May could be ousted in June, the markets awaiting the outcome of cross-party talks, of which the tone was reportedly better on Monday. <strong>JPY</strong> weaken slightly amid growing risk appetite (as SPX hit fresh all-time highs and the curve bear steepened) but JPY traded with thin liquidity, with the Japanese on holiday for Golden Week. <strong>CAD </strong>traded mixed ahead of tomorrow’s (Feb) GDP data release. <strong>AUD/NZD</strong> strengthened against the USD, buoyed by a rebound in Chinese industrial profits in March and positive news flow regarding US/China trade talks, with talks reportedly in the ‘last stretch’.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong>:</p><p>Poised to end the EU session around 98.000, having pivoted on either side of the level throughout the session. The USD was little changed following optimistic US-Sino comments from Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, although, overall subdued core PCE figures briefly dented the index, albeit DXY nursed those marginal losses and stays afloat above 98.000. It’s worth noting that due to SOMA tomorrow, USD liquidity will shrink by USD 28.1bln. Meanwhile, looking at FX month-end rebalancing, Citi’s model sees marginal USD selling whilst Barclay’s model suggests strong USD selling vs. major peers. Nonetheless, USD is set to end EU trade flat with nothing scheduled of note left on the docket.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, EUR:</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Kiwi remain the most resilient against the Greenback, underpinned by an improvement in Chinese industrial profits and latest US-China trade reports suggesting negotiations are reaching the last stretch. NZD/USD remains just about afloat above 0.6650 (for now), albeit closer to the bottom of a 0.6650-80 band, whilst its Aussie counterpart similarly pared most of the day’s gains and is poised to end EU trade below 0.7050 having fluctuated in a 0.7037-60 range. Finally, the single currency largely shrugged off the mostly weaker than forecast Eurozone sentiment indicators which were countered by a degree of relief post-Spanish election and S&amp;P reaffirming Italy’s BBB rating. EUR/USD looks set to end EU trade around 1.1150 after having recently found support around 1.1100.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong>:</p><p>Choppy trade for the Pound, but largely set to end little changed vs. the Buck, albeit above 1.2900, with Brexit talks still seemingly dead-locked with PM May’s spokesman reaffirming that a way forward in cross-party talks with Labour has yet to be found, whilst sources over the weekend noted that PM May will be ousted by end-June if cross-party talks crumble.</p><p><strong>JPY, CAD:</strong></p><p>All slightly weaker against the Dollar, with JPY as the main G10 laggard having marginally extended today’s parameter to 111.54-84 with upside in the pair possible aided by the risk-appetite as the E-mini S&amp;P prints new all-time highs, although it’s worth keeping in mind the absence of Japanese markets (until May 7th) due to the Golden Week holidays. Levels to the downside for the pair include its 200 DMA at 111.51, strong chart support sub-111.50 as the 30 DMA, 38.2% Fib retracement of April peak to March trough (112.40-109.70) and last week’s low all fall at 111.37. Meanwhile the Loonie remains vulnerable to oil price action and thus USD/CAD is poised to end the session closer to the top of an 1.3450-1.3480 range.</p>",

The market will be watching whether the Fed outlines conditions that might compel the Committee to discuss lowering rates. There are some risks that the Fed might tweak its statement to reflect stronger growth and softer inflation since the last meeting. There is also a possibility the Fed could lower its IOER rate. The Committee’s tone is likely to remain one of patience and data dependence. <strong>To download the report, please click </strong><a href=\"/research_sheets/21711/download\"><strong>here</strong></a></li><li>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</li></ul>",

The IBEX 35 (-0.4%) is lagging its peers this morning following on from the Spanish elections where the incumbent Socialist party emerged as the only one with the potential to form a coalition; within the index utility names are underperforming, which is dragging the utility sector in general down, with some speculation that this may be due to the success of the far right Vox party which secured 24 seats. Downside in utilities likely stemming from pledges by Vox to keep nuclear plants open, which contradicts the incumbent socialist party’s policies of closing nuclear plants and supporting renewable energy, which has been beneficial to Spanish utility names. Notable movers this morning include, Altice (+5.1%) who have reportedly attracted 3 potential bidders for their fibre optic network. Following the dissolution of merger discussions, Commerzbank (+1.6%) have rebutted speculation that the Co. may be sold, stating that they are strong enough alone and their customer relationships remain intact.

First up, more inflation data and the Fed’s preferred price measure in the form of core y/y PCE following softer than expected Q1 reads within the advance GDP release, and then it’s month end on Tuesday with FX rebalancing models suggesting a Usd sell signal that could be countered to an extent by supportive SOMA flows. On to May 1, and the FOMC follows the first NFP proxies for Friday via the ADP survey plus employment readings in the manufacturing PMI and ISM. In the run up, the index is straddling 98.000 in a relatively narrow 98.066-97.917 range, with last week’s new 98.330 ytd peak providing resistance vs support at 97.693 that held on Friday.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/AUD/NZD -</strong> Cable continues to display resilience ahead of the 1.2900 handle even though Brexit remains up in the air and talks between the Tory and Labour Party are still grid-locked, but the Pound is still looking toppy around 1.2950 amidst offers at 1.2945 (last month’s low) and with DMAs in close proximity (100 and 200 from 1.2962-65). Similarly, the single currency is finding support off 1.1100 and 2019 lows, as mostly weaker than forecast Eurozone sentiment indicators are countered by a degree of relief post-Spanish election and S&amp;P reaffirming Italy’s BBB rating. Meanwhile, an improvement in Chinese industrial profits and latest US-China trade reports suggesting negotiations are reaching the last stretch are propping up the Aussie and Kiwi circa 0.7050 and 0.6670 respectively.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/JPY -</strong> All on a more even keel vs the Usd and in relatively thin confines as the Franc meanders between 1.0200-1.0185 and Loonie roams from 1.3472-51 amidst a further pull-back in crude and ahead of tomorrow’s Canadian monthly GDP and PPI data. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy has extended its trading parameters, but only to 111.54-77 in the absence of Japanese markets at the start of Golden Week and with strong chart support sub-111.50 as the 30 DMA, 38.2% Fib retracement of April peak to March trough (112.40-109.70) and last week’s low all fall at 111.37.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> At last some respite for the beleaguered Lira as an improvement in Turkish industrial confidence nudges Usd/Try off near 5.9600 peaks awaiting Tuesday’s CBRT inflation report for more independent impetus.</p><p>Goldman Sachs sees EUR/USD declining to 1.10 in the next 3 months and DXY rising to 99.00, while it suggested global growth is unlikely to be strong enough to weigh on the greenback. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs forecasts USD/TRY at 6.25 in 3 months, 6.50 in 6 months and 7.00 in 12 months. (Newswires)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Bunds remain around ¼ point underwater at 165.58, but off worst levels as relief gains in Italian debt fade to leave the 10 year Italian benchmark almost flat within a 130.36-95 range. However, Spanish Bonos have advanced a bit further to 151.88 following the weekend election that put PM Sanchez in prime position to begin talks to find partners for a majority regime and this is keeping spreads to core Eurozone paper on a tighter trajectory. Indeed, Gilts and US Treasuries have staged a firmer bounce from worst levels than their German equivalent, with the former up to 127.71 at one stage (-4 ticks vs -26 ticks at the Liffe low) and T-note recovering to 123-22 from 123-18 vs last Friday’s 123-21+ close. Note also, some decent option interest overnight via long bond calls in a diagonal calendar spread.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Brent (-0.9%) and WTI (-0.5%)</strong> prices are subdued in reaction to US President Trump’s comments on Friday that he contacted OPEC and told them to lower oil prices; although, there were subsequent reports that OPEC or Saudi officials have not spoken to President Trump regarding oil prices. However, some of the downside was mitigated by the Baker Hughes total rig count which fell by 21, with oil rigs falling by 20 to 805 in the steepest decline since January. Regarding the Iranian waivers a Trump Official says there is no wind down period or short-term waiver being considered for China’s oil purchases from Iran, and that it should be easy for China to comply as business with the US is more important for them than Iran. Elsewhere, sources report that exports of Nigeria’s Amenam crude oil is currently under a force majeure; these exports are operated by Total and typically equal 100k BPD.</p><p><strong>Gold (-0.3%)</strong> is marginally weaker, although the yellow metal is trading within a relatively narrow USD 5/oz range. After the metal printed its biggest daily gain in over a month on Friday, following US data which was disappointing in-spite of the larger than expected headline GDP print of 3.2%. Elsewhere, China’s Iron and Steel association stated that the industry is at risk from excess capacity which could impact profits in the industry.</p><p>Eastern Libyan military forces have sent warships to the port of Ras Lanuf, according to a spokesman.

Sectors are similarly mixed, with some mild underperformance seen in energy names in-line with the complex in general. The IBEX 35 (-0.4%) is lagging its peers this morning following on from the Spanish elections where the incumbent Socialist party emerged as the only one with the potential to form a coalition; within the index utility names are underperforming, which is dragging the utility sector in general down, with some speculation that this may be due to the success of the far right Vox party which secured 24 seats. Downside in utilities likely stemming from pledges by Vox to keep nuclear plants open, which contradicts the incumbent socialist party’s policies of closing nuclear plants and supporting renewable energy, which has been beneficial to Spanish utility names. Notable movers this morning include, Altice (+4.5%) who have reportedly attracted 3 potential bidders for their fibre optic network. Following the dissolution of merger discussions, Commerzbank (+1.4%) have rebutted speculation that the Co. may be sold, stating that they are strong enough alone and their customer relationships remain intact. Elsewhere, Bayer (-2.5%) are down after a spokesman stated that the majority of the Co’s investors voted against ratifying the executive boards 2018 business conduct, for reference the Co. are trading ex-div today.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> - The Greenback has regained some composure after last Friday’s post-data downturn, but remains on a mixed footing vs G10 peers and EM currencies at the start of what looks like a busy/pivotal week on paper at least. First up, more inflation data and the Fed’s preferred price measure in the form of core y/y PCE following softer than expected Q1 reads within the advance GDP release, and then it’s month end on Tuesday with FX rebalancing models suggesting a Usd sell signal that could be countered to an extent by supportive SOMA flows. On to May 1, and the FOMC follows the first NFP proxies for Friday via the ADP survey plus employment readings in the manufacturing PMI and ISM. In the run up, the index is straddling 98.000 in a relatively narrow 98.066-97.917 range, with last week’s new 98.330 ytd peak providing resistance vs support at 97.693 that held on Friday.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/AUD/NZD</strong> - Cable continues to display resilience ahead of the 1.2900 handle even though Brexit remains up in the air and talks between the Tory and Labour Party are still grid-locked, but the Pound is still looking toppy around 1.2950 amidst offers at 1.2945 (last month’s low) and with DMAs in close proximity (100 and 200 from 1.2962-65). Similarly, the single currency is finding support off 1.1100 and 2019 lows, as mostly weaker than forecast Eurozone sentiment indicators are countered by a degree of relief post-Spanish election and S&amp;P reaffirming Italy’s BBB rating. Meanwhile, an improvement in Chinese industrial profits and latest US-China trade reports suggesting negotiations are reaching the last stretch are propping up the Aussie and Kiwi circa 0.7050 and 0.6670 respectively.</p><p><strong>CHF/CAD/JPY</strong> - All on a more even keel vs the Usd and in relatively thin confines as the Franc meanders between 1.0200-1.0185 and Loonie roams from 1.3472-51 amidst a further pull-back in crude and ahead of tomorrow’s Canadian monthly GDP and PPI data. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy has extended its trading parameters, but only to 111.54-77 in the absence of Japanese markets at the start of Golden Week and with strong chart support sub-111.50 as the 30 DMA, 38.2% Fib retracement of April peak to March trough (112.40-109.70) and last week’s low all fall at 111.37.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - At last some respite for the beleaguered Lira as an improvement in Turkish industrial confidence nudges Usd/Try off near 5.9600 peaks awaiting Tuesday’s CBRT inflation report for more independent impetus.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Bunds remain around ¼ point underwater at 165.58, but off worst levels as relief gains in Italian debt fade to leave the 10 year Italian benchmark almost flat within a 130.36-95 range. However, Spanish Bonos have advanced a bit further to 151.88 following the weekend election that put PM Sanchez in prime position to begin talks to find partners for a majority regime and this is keeping spreads to core Eurozone paper on a tighter trajectory. Indeed, Gilts and US Treasuries have staged a firmer bounce from worst levels than their German equivalent, with the former up to 127.71 at one stage (-4 ticks vs -26 ticks at the Liffe low) and T-note recovering to 123-22 from 123-18 vs last Friday’s 123-21+ close. Note also, some decent option interest overnight via long bond calls in a diagonal calendar spread.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Brent (-0.9%) and WTI (-0.6%)</strong> prices are subdued in reaction to US President Trump’s comments on Friday that he contacted OPEC and told them to lower oil prices; although, there were subsequent reports that OPEC or Saudi officials have not spoken to President Trump regarding oil prices. However, some of the downside was mitigated by the Baker Hughes total rig count which fell by 21, with oil rigs falling by 20 to 805 in the steepest decline since January. Regarding the Iranian waivers a Trump Official says there is no wind down period or short-term waiver being considered for China’s oil purchases from Iran, and that it should be easy for China to comply as business with the US is more important for them than Iran. Elsewhere, sources report that exports of Nigeria’s Amenam crude oil is currently under a force majeure; these exports are operated by Total and typically equal 100k BPD.</p><p><strong>Gold (-0.3%) </strong>is marginally weaker, although the yellow metal is trading within a relatively narrow USD 5/oz range. After the metal printed its biggest daily gain in over a month on Friday, following US data which was disappointing in-spite of the larger than expected headline GDP print of 3.2%. Elsewhere, China’s Iron and Steel association stated that the industry is at risk from excess capacity which could impact profits in the industry.</p>",

        "content": "<p>As was anticipated, the socialist party PSOE (123) won the Spanish election but fell short of a majority as the PP (66) had its worst turnout in history and VOX gathered 24 seats, marking the first time a far-right party is set to hold seats in the congress of deputies since Francisco Franco. The 123 seats garnered by the incumbent PSOE means that they are now guaranteed to Govern but a viable Government can now only be formed via a coalition. This is possible either with an Unidas Podemos (42) tie-up (requiring the support of regional parties – most likely) or a coalition with Ciudadanos (57) (much less likely as this has been vehemently rejected by Ciudadanos in the past).</p><p>Sights will now be set on negotiations with Catalan parties JxCAT (7) and ERC (15) and suggestions of more Catalan regional autonomy will be key. This is because they are now the king-makers of a potential PSOE/Unidas Podemos/Regional Party coalition, and increased autonomy has consistently been a request from both parties.</p><p>Whilst political uncertainty remains high until a Government is formed, both MS and Danske expect little immediate impact on financial markets from the largely-in-line results, as the Spanish economy has been “fairly resilient to previous such episodes”, and continued roll-backs on labour-market reforms are “unlikely to inhibit the Spanish growth engine in the short term”. On the medium-term, however, Danske say said reforms may “have negative repercussions on the business environment and public finances in the medium term, with Spain already having one of the highest structural budget deficits in the euro area”.&nbsp;</p>",

The greenback’s major counterparts are mildly higher with EUR/USD prodding above resistance at 1.1150 after the Spanish election results showed incumbent PM Sanchez’s Socialists party won 123 out of the 350 seats in parliament and despite failing to secure a majority, it emerged as the only party with a chance of forming a governing coalition. GBP/USD is also slightly firmer but with upside limited amid conflicting views on cross-party discussions which UK Chancellor Hammond described as productive and suggested optimism on reaching a common ground, while the Labour party accused the government of refusing to compromise on its red lines. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is uneventful amid the 10-day closure in Japan and antipodeans extend on Friday’s mild advances with AUD/USD benefitting as the ruling coalition narrowed the gap against Labor ahead of next month’s election and after the latest ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate futures showed expectations for a rate cut next week slipped to below 50%.</p>",
