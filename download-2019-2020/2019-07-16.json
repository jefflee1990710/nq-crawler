JP Morgan (JPM) shares rose after the co. reported a beat on top and bottom line and despite a cut in FY19 NII guidance. Wells Fargo (WFC) was under pressure after NIM missed expectations. Finally in the financial sector, Charles Schwab (SCHW) moved higher after the co. reported strong earnings and an increase in active brokerage accounts. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) shares were under pressure, despite solid earnings, after the drug maker reported a decrease in Worldwide Remicade sales. J. B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) shares shot higher after the co. gave robust guidance, bringing other trucking stocks higher. Domino’s Pizza Inc (DPZ) shares sunk after the co. reported disappointing same-stores sales. Energy names sunk with the crude complex after the geopolitical risk premium priced into crude took a hit from US Secretary of State Pompeo comments in which he intimated that Iran may be willing to negotiate about its missile program. Boeing Company (BA) shares were supported by reports that the co. had outlined plans to change the controversial software that was implicated in the crashes, as well as updates to pilot training. Alphabet Inc (GOOG) shares were under pressure after US President Trump said that the government would take a closer look at allegations that the co. had colluded with the Chinese government. Micron (MU) fell after Lynx recommended that clients to take profit on following recent gains. Tesla (TSLA) shares moved lower after the electric automaker opted to drop the cheapest versions of its Model X and S, and adjusted prices across its product range. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) reversed premarket gains, despite news that the co. plans to increase manufacturing capacity for Freestyle Libre, a low-cost continuous glucose monitor, by between three and five times over the next few years. People's United Financial (PBCT) shares fell after the co. announced overnight that it would buy United Financial Bancorp Inc (UBNK) for USD 743mln in a stock deal. Prologis (PLD) shares advanced after the co. announced intentions to buy Black Creek Group's Industrial Property Trust Inc in an all-cash deal valued at about roughly USD 4bln, a move that is set to increase annual core funds from operations (on a per share basis) by between USD 0.05 and USD 0.061. Snap Inc (SNAP) shares fell, despite a PT increase at Evercore ISI. Marathon Oil Corp (MRO) were buoyed by positive comments from JP Morgan, who see an upbeat Q2 based on decent productivity gains. Both Callon Petroleum Co (CPE) and Carrizo Oil &amp; Gas (CRZO) shares rose, a day after the two announced a merger. S&amp;P 500 -0.3% at 3004, NASDAQ-10 -0.5% at 7927, Dow Jones -0.1% at 27335.</p><p>The curve bear flattened; yields higher across the curve (2s +3.1bps, 5s +3.5bps, 10s +3.4bps, 30s +3bps) despite dovish rhetoric from Fed officials and geopolitical tensions bubbling away. The complex took its cue from June's retail sales data, which beat expectations. However, the data will likely only have a limited impact on the Fed's policy, where it is expected to cut rates by at least 25bps at its July policy meeting. Pricing for a 50bps rate cut fell slightly in wake of the data, however. And the Fed commentary did little to add to '50bps cut' pricing. The markets have priced 31bps of cuts for the July meeting (implying a 25bps rate cut, with a 24% chance of a 50bps rate cut), and around 66bps of easing is priced through the end of the year (at the end of last week, it was about 70bps). At settlement, major curve spreads were slightly narrower. US T-note futures (U9) settled 8 ticks lower at 126-29+.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>SNAPSHOT: Equities flat/lower, Treasuries lower, dollar up, crude down.</li><li>REAR VIEW: Pompeo claims Iran ready to negotiate missile program; Iran denies; Solid US retail sales; Trump says US/China deal still a long way off; dovish Fed speak.</li><li>COMING UP: Data; UK CPI, EU Construction Output, CPI, US Building Permits, Housing Starts, EIA Crude Stocks, Canada CPI, Speakers; ECB’s Coeure, Releases; Fed’s Beige Book, Earnings; Europe; ASML, Ericsson, US; Bank of America, IBM, Abbott Labs, Netflix, eBay, Omnicom.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>* MARKETS WRAP: </strong>Stocks came under pressure after US President Trump said that the US and China are still “a long way off” a deal; ranges were thin, however. The dollar rallied back to pre-Powell Semi-Annual Testimony Statement levels on the back of strong retail sales data. Crude dropped on suggestions that Iran was willing to negotiate on its missiles programme, a report that was subsequently denied by Iranian officials. Fed’s Powell reiterated the FOMC’s readiness to act, Kaplan and Evans also reiterated calls for looser policy.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Nothing particularly new from <strong>Fed Chair Powell</strong> <strong>(Voter)</strong>, who reiterates the Fed's willingness to act, as he stated at his dual testimonies to lawmakers last week. Interestingly, he did not nod to the strong retail sales data released today, which again reiterates the Fed's dovish stance, and that a July rate cut can be expected. Also interesting was his comments on inflation, which he sees ticking up slightly in the June data (he sees 1.7% Y/Y from 1.6%). <strong>Fed’s Evens (Voter)</strong> said a little more accommodation may be needed to get inflation back to target; on either a 25bps or 50bps rate cut in July, says it is a question of strategy, a larger cut might achieve inflation goals more quickly. <strong>Fed’s</strong> <strong>Kaplan (Non-Voter)</strong> said a rate cut could be warranted based on bond market signals, though said any cuts should be limited or restrained; the comments from the non-voting dove seem to suggest that he is comfortable with the notion of a 25bps rate cut, although 50bps may be a stretch, a sentiment recently expressed by Fed uber-dove (and voter) James Bullard.</p><p><strong>* US JUNE RETAIL SALES: </strong>US Retail Sales beta expectations at 0.4% M/M in June (Exp. 0.1%); Ex Gas/Autos 0.7% (Prev. 0.5%); Control Group 0.7% (Exp. 0.3%); Ex-Autos 0.4% (Exp. 0.1%). The strong rise in underlying retail sales in June, along with upward revisions to previous months’ gains, suggests that real consumption growth accelerated to 4% annualised in Q2, Capital Economics said. Nevertheless, it would still be a shock if the Fed did not follow through with a 25bps rate cut later at the July meeting, the consultancy write; however, it adds that lingering expectations of a 50bps move look well wide of the mark - a notion that has been given credence by comments from the self-identified, most dovish FOMC participant, James Bullard, who recently said a 50bps insurance rate cut might be excessive.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US Secretary of State Pompeo said that Iran is ready to negotiate about its missile programme, in a markedly constructive step forward in terms of diplomacy between Tehran and Washington; However, Iranian officials later denied the report, stating that its missiles were not negotiable; crude clung on to losses, however. President Trump said that a lot of progress has been made with Iran, and that the US wants to provide help and collaboration; Trump added that he does not see a regime change. Elsewhere, Trump said Turkey has ordered more than 100 F-35 planes, but cannot purchase more, as it now has the Russian missile system.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>During early morning trade, China’s Foreign Ministry responded to Trump’s criticism of their GDP numbers, stating it is misleading to suggest China requires a US trade deal as the economy is slowing. Later, the WTO appealed that judges rule that the US did not fully comply with a ruling that it should remove certain anti-subsidy tariffs within the Obama-Era disagreement with China, where the WTO appealed the ruling opens up the path for Chinese sanctions on goods in the USA due to WTO rules, unless the disputed tariffs are removed by the US. USTR Lighthizer responded saying the WTO report on the duties ignores objective evidence and findings of the World Bank and OECD and that the US is determined to take all the required steps to ensure an even playing field with China. Mid-session, President Trump stated there is still a long way to go with China in terms of trade and that the US can put tariffs on another additional Chinese goods. Trump also stated that China is supposed to be purchasing US farm products, but he goes onto say ‘We’ll see if they do’.</p><p><strong>* US BUSINESS INVENTORIES: </strong>Grew 0.3% M/M in May, in line with expectations; the gains were driven by manufacturing (+0.2%), wholesale (+0.4%), and retail (+0.4%) stock building. A modest 0.2% rise in total sales kept the business inventories-to-sales ratio unchanged at 1.39. Oxford Economics notes that following a large 0.6ppt contribution to GDP growth in Q1, inventories are expected to impose a 0.9ppt drag in Q2. Oxford Economics' own real GDP growth tracker stands at 2.0% (annualized), following this morning’s retail sales and inventories data; the Atlanta Fed's gauge rose to 1.6% from 1.4%.</p><p><strong>* US INDUSTRIAL/MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION: </strong>Industrial production was unchanged in June; industrial production was unchanged in the month of June (analysts had expected a small rise); Manufacturing production rose 0.4% M/M, beating the consensus 0.2%. Wells Fargo's analysts say the headline industrial production was flat as a drop-in utilities output outweighed gains in mining and manufacturing. Despite the second consecutive monthly gain, manufacturing output remains fairly weak.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN ZEW: </strong>The July print came in at -24, a miss on expectations -22.3 and a decrease from the prior of -21.1. Businesses cited concerns over the US-China trade dispute and Iran tensions as factors for dampened sentiment and said a lasting containment of factors causing uncertainty in export-driven sectors is currently not in sight.</p><p><strong>* EUROPE TOP JOBS: </strong>Germany's von der Leyen was voted in as European Commission President, by a narrow margin, as expected. Von der Leyen said: The trust you placed in me is confidence you placed in Europe, and confidence in a united and strong Europe, from east to west, from south to north; she added that it was a big responsibility, and that she wants to \"work together constructively.\"</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU diplomats reportedly are wary of offering any significant new concessions to the UK, but said they have 'ammunition left'. The report said that concessions being mulled in order to avoid a messy no-deal Brexit included technological solutions for the Irish border, a formal link between GBP 39bln 'divorce bill' and any future trade deal, as well as applying the backstop only to Northern Ireland, while a re-drafting of the political declaration is also on the table. Elsewhere, The Times reports a 'hostile' meeting took place between Brexit Secretary Barclay and EU Brexit negotiator Barnier; an unnamed EU official suggested that if the tone of discussions continued in this vein, 'we will be heading for no deal quickly.' In Tuesday trade, Sky reported that Boris Johnson's team is considering a plan to suspend parliament in run up to Brexit; Sky said that Johnson could send MPs home for up to two weeks in October, and insiders reportedly confirmed they are looking at scheduling a Queen's speech to mark the start of a new parliamentary session in early November; Sky explains that Parliament is usually prorogued for between one and two weeks ahead of a Queen's speech, meaning MPs would in effect be unavailable to stop a no-deal Brexit immediately before 31st October.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLE 8 TICKS LOWER AT 126-29+. </strong>The curve bear flattened; yields higher across the curve (2s +3.1bps, 5s +3.5bps, 10s +3.4bps, 30s +3bps) despite dovish rhetoric from Fed officials and geopolitical tensions bubbling away. The complex took its cue from June's retail sales data, which beat expectations. However, the data will likely only have a limited impact on the Fed's policy, where it is expected to cut rates by at least 25bps at its July policy meeting. Pricing for a 50bps rate cut fell slightly in wake of the data, however. And the Fed commentary did little to add to '50bps cut' pricing. The markets have priced 31bps of cuts for the July meeting (implying a 25bps rate cut, with a 24% chance of a 50bps rate cut), and around 66bps of easing is priced through the end of the year (at the end of last week, it was about 70bps). At settlement, major curve spreads were slightly narrower.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Q9) SETTLES USD 1.96 LOWER AT USD 57.62; BRENT (U9) SETTLES USD 2.13/BBL LOWER AT USD 64.35:</strong> Oil prices were thin-ranged and choppy before a chunky late-session sell off amid a wind-down of US-Iran tensions. Brent futures had a short-lived rally earlier in the session after headlines of the UK Navy sending an additional warship to the Persian Gulf, although closer inspection revealed this was part of a long-term plan established prior to the recent Iran escalation. The two benchmarks tumbled lower in the late session after Washington announced a step forward with Iran, suggesting talks were ready to be held, which saw the market unwind some of the geopolitical risk premium. Looking ahead, the API will release its US energy inventory data after the bell on Tuesday; the Street expects a headline crude draw of 2.7mln. distillates are expected to build by 600k, and gasoline stocks are seen drawing 0.9mln.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.3% at 3004, NASDAQ-10 -0.5% at 7927, Dow Jones&nbsp; -0.1% at 27335; </strong>SECTORS: S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0%, S&amp;P 500 Energy&nbsp; -1.1%, S&amp;P 500 Financials&nbsp; -0.3%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care&nbsp; -0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials&nbsp; 0.7%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology&nbsp; -0.9%, S&amp;P 500 Materials&nbsp; 0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities&nbsp; -0.6%</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Goldman<strong> </strong>Sachs<strong> </strong>(GS)<strong> </strong>shares advanced after top and bottom line beats, whilst also increasing quarterly dividend. JP Morgan (JPM) shares rose after the co. reported a beat on top and bottom line and despite a cut in FY19 NII guidance. Wells Fargo (WFC) was under pressure after NIM missed expectations. Finally in the financial sector, Charles Schwab (SCHW) moved higher after the co. reported strong earnings and an increase in active brokerage accounts. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) shares were under pressure, despite solid earnings, after the drug maker reported a decrease in Worldwide Remicade sales. J. B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) shares shot higher after the co. gave robust guidance, bringing other trucking stocks higher. Domino’s Pizza Inc (DPZ) shares sunk after the co. reported disappointing same-stores sales.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Energy names sunk with the crude complex after the geopolitical risk premium priced into crude took a hit from US Secretary of State Pompeo comments in which he intimated that Iran may be willing to negotiate about its missile program. Boeing Company (BA) shares were supported by reports that the co. had outlined plans to change the controversial software that was implicated in the crashes, as well as updates to pilot training. Alphabet Inc (GOOG) shares were under pressure after US President Trump said that the government would take a closer look at allegations that the co. had colluded with the Chinese government. Micron (MU) fell after Lynx recommended that clients to take profit on following recent gains. Tesla (TSLA) shares moved lower after the electric automaker opted to drop the cheapest versions of its Model X and S, and adjusted prices across its product range. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) reversed premarket gains, despite news that the co. plans to increase manufacturing capacity for Freestyle Libre, a low-cost continuous glucose monitor, by between three and five times over the next few years. People's United Financial (PBCT) shares fell after the co. announced overnight that it would buy United Financial Bancorp Inc (UBNK) for USD 743mln in a stock deal. Prologis (PLD) shares advanced after the co. announced intentions to buy Black Creek Group's Industrial Property Trust Inc in an all-cash deal valued at about roughly USD 4bln, a move that is set to increase annual core funds from operations (on a per share basis) by between USD 0.05 and USD 0.061. Snap Inc (SNAP) shares fell, despite a PT increase at Evercore ISI. Marathon Oil Corp (MRO) were buoyed by positive comments from JP Morgan, who see an upbeat Q2 based on decent productivity gains. Both Callon Petroleum Co (CPE) and Carrizo Oil &amp; Gas (CRZO) shares rose, a day after the two announced a merger.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD </strong>advanced to pre-Powell testimony levels after a solid retail sales report for June reassured that the consumer sector was in decent shape.<strong> GBP</strong> sunk to fresh YTD lows of sub 1.24 as no deal Brexit fears resurface; strong UK employment data did little to quell the decline, which saw Cable slip in excess of a dollar on the day. <strong>EUR</strong> was dragged lower, with dower German ZEW data doing little to help – 1.12 seems to have held. <strong>JPY</strong> after solid retail sales moved rate differentials in the buck’s favour; Likewise, fellow safe haven asset <strong>CHF</strong> also weakened. AUD was lower as the RBA minutes kept the door open to further rate cuts; <strong>NZD</strong> held up relatively better vs the buck, after Q2 CPI was in line. <strong>EMFX</strong> suffered as a result of dollar strength, with <strong>TRY</strong> the notable outlier, possibly supported by encouraging jobs and fiscal data and despite continued Turkish determination to continue drilling regardless of possible EU sanctions. <strong>MXN</strong> was under pressure as President Obrador unveiled plans to rescue state owned oil co. Pemex (ratings agencies have called Pemex a risk to Mexico’s sovereign rating).</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling saw downside on Tuesday, printing fresh lows just beneath the 1.24 handle. UBS' analysts say the downside was a result of sequencing: There seems to be an inevitability that the EU and UK will arrive at a 'no deal' moment, where both sides go to the edge in their negotiations. The EU wants to get the UK Parliament to blink; the UK Prime Minister needs the EU to compromise. \"The problem for investors is, when is the crunch point?\" UBS asks, and the bank expects that moment to come at the Oct. 17-18 European Council, but the headlines overnight from Brexit Secretary Barclay's meeting with EU Negotiator Barnier indicates that it might be sooner. Hence today's GBP weakness.\" The bank this that Parliament will likely stand in the way of 'no deal', making its sales and trading desks a dip buyer of GBP. \"However, the moment to do this will only come when both sides enter a 'no deal' standoff. For now, stay short GBP.\"</p><p><strong>* AUD: </strong>RBA Minutes released overnight showed the central bank cutting rates (back-to-back) in an effort to \"support the necessary growth in employment and incomes, and promote stronger overall economic conditions, which would in turn support a gradual increase in underlying inflation.\" But the central bank also stated that \"a decline in interest rates was unlikely to encourage an unwelcome material pick-up in borrowing by households that would add to medium-term risks in the economy.\" Looking ahead, the RBA will \"monitor developments in the labour market closely and adjust monetary policy if needed,\" it said. Ahead of the minutes' release, analysts were looking for clues as to whether the RBA's rate cuts were a 'two-and-done' amid the government's latest tax cuts (which is said to be the equivalent of 50bps worth of cuts), or whether it was considering firing more rate cuts. That question, it seems, will be continingent on how the data/trade risks (and by extension the AUD) all evolve, but nevertheless, the possibility of another rate cut before the end of the year remains. Money markets assigned a slightly higher chance of further easing, in wake of the minutes (implied probability rose to 60% from 57%).</p><p><strong>* NZD: </strong>Q2 CPI printed in line with expectations at +0.6% Q/Q (rebounding from +0.1% Q/Q in Q1) and +1.7% Y/Y. The data was also in line with the RBNZ's May MPS estimate. Core inflation accelerated to 1.7% Y/Y from 1.5%. However, analysts at UBS still look for a 25bps rate cut from the central bank at the August meeting: \"It would have taken a material upside surprise to have any influence on our expectation for an August OCR cut – this was not forthcoming,\" UBS writes. But the bank notes that, \"at the margin, and accepting that the immediate outlook for monetary policy is probably going to be more about domestic/global growth and risks thereof, a lift in the RBNZ's preferred measure of underlying inflation would introduce an element of caution about what happens beyond August.\" Thus, the bank believes that while another cut in November is a risk (and will also depend on the action at other major central banks) it is not its base-case.</p><p><strong>* CHF: </strong>With the market looking for easing from the ECB next week, watch the CHF, SocGen says. PPI slowed in June sharply, which will once again stoke fears of deflation in Switzerland. \"The SNB is sitting on the fence, with a bias to intervene, but it will have to dust off what’s left of its (un)conventional policy tool box if the ECB pulls the trigger on rates and/or QE2 next week or after the summer,\" SocGen writes. \"A 10bps deposit rate cut by the ECB would almost certainly be followed by a cut of the same magnitude in the SNB's 3m Libor midpoint from -0.75% to -0.85% to keep the rate differential constant.\" SocGen notes that the rise in PPI deflation is dovetailing with CHF appreciation: \"All the talk of late has been about dollar intervention, but the closer EURCHF gets to 1.10, the higher the probability that the SNB will act before the US Treasury.\" With that said, global trade wars and Brexit will make it difficult to completely mitigate support for the CHF between now and October (when the Brexit extension expires), SocGen says.</p><p><strong>* BRL: </strong>After the Pension Reform vote cleared the Lower House last week, attention is now on the Senate Vote, where 49 of the 81 votes are required. Reports suggest that the government can count on the support of 42, and this shortfall could mean that a vote is pushed back, perhaps until the Congressional recess in August. The key metric to watch is the savings amount (currently estimated at around USD 980bln over a 10-year horizon - if amendments are added that waters down that number, it could pile pressure onto the BRL, some desks warn; a positive outcome, however, could see USDBRL fall to 3.60.</p><p><strong>* CNY: </strong>UBS recommends keeping an eye on the upcoming Politburo meeting, as well as trade war negotiations, for any change in China's policy direction in H2. The bank says that assuming no further trade war escalation, it expects only modest additional easing and no major new stimulus, and UBS also expects the PBOC to cut RRR by 100 bps, as well as increasing liquidity offering, but not to cut benchmark rates; UBS also expects a modest easing on local government financing.</p>",

The complex took its cue from June's retail sales data, which beat expectations. However, the data will likely only have a limited impact on the Fed's policy, where it is expected to cut rates by at least 25bps at its July policy meeting. Pricing for a 50bps rate cut fell slightly in wake of the data, however. And the Fed commentary did little to add to '50bps cut' pricing. The markets have priced 31bps of cuts for the July meeting (implying a 25bps rate cut, with a 24% chance of a 50bps rate cut), and around 66bps of easing is priced through the end of the year (at the end of last week, it was about 70bps). At settlement, major curve spreads were slightly narrower.</p>",

        "content": "",
        "reaction_details": "",
        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD </strong>advanced to pre-Powell testimony levels after a solid retail sales report for June reassured that the consumer sector was in decent shape.<strong> GBP</strong> sunk to fresh YTD lows of sub 1.24 as no deal Brexit fears resurface; strong UK employment data did little to quell the decline, which saw Cable slip in excess of a dollar on the day. <strong>EUR</strong> was dragged lower, with dower German ZEW data doing little to help – 1.12 seems to have held. <strong>JPY</strong> after solid retail sales moved rate differentials in the buck’s favour; Likewise, fellow safe haven asset <strong>CHF</strong> also weakened. AUD was lower as the RBA minutes kept the door open to further rate cuts; <strong>NZD</strong> held up relatively better vs the buck, after Q2 CPI was in line. <strong>EMFX</strong> suffered as a result of dollar strength, with <strong>TRY</strong> the notable outlier, possibly supported by encouraging jobs and fiscal data and despite continued Turkish determination to continue drilling regardless of possible EU sanctions. <strong>MXN</strong> was under pressure as President Obrador unveiled plans to rescue state owned oil co. Pemex (ratings agencies have called Pemex a risk to Mexico’s sovereign rating).</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling saw downside on Tuesday, printing fresh lows just beneath the 1.24 handle. UBS' analysts say the downside was a result of sequencing: There seems to be an inevitability that the EU and UK will arrive at a 'no deal' moment, where both sides go to the edge in their negotiations. The EU wants to get the UK Parliament to blink; the UK Prime Minister needs the EU to compromise. \"The problem for investors is, when is the crunch point?\" UBS asks, and the bank expects that moment to come at the Oct. 17-18 European Council, but the headlines overnight from Brexit Secretary Barclay's meeting with EU Negotiator Barnier indicates that it might be sooner. Hence today's GBP weakness.\" The bank this that Parliament will likely stand in the way of 'no deal', making its sales and trading desks a dip buyer of GBP. \"However, the moment to do this will only come when both sides enter a 'no deal' standoff. For now, stay short GBP.\"</p><p><strong>* AUD: </strong>RBA Minutes released overnight showed the central bank cutting rates (back-to-back) in an effort to \"support the necessary growth in employment and incomes, and promote stronger overall economic conditions, which would in turn support a gradual increase in underlying inflation.\" But the central bank also stated that \"a decline in interest rates was unlikely to encourage an unwelcome material pick-up in borrowing by households that would add to medium-term risks in the economy.\" Looking ahead, the RBA will \"monitor developments in the labour market closely and adjust monetary policy if needed,\" it said. Ahead of the minutes' release, analysts were looking for clues as to whether the RBA's rate cuts were a 'two-and-done' amid the government's latest tax cuts (which is said to be the equivalent of 50bps worth of cuts), or whether it was considering firing more rate cuts. That question, it seems, will be continingent on how the data/trade risks (and by extension the AUD) all evolve, but nevertheless, the possibility of another rate cut before the end of the year remains. Money markets assigned a slightly higher chance of further easing, in wake of the minutes (implied probability rose to 60% from 57%).</p><p><strong>* NZD: </strong>Q2 CPI printed in line with expectations at +0.6% Q/Q (rebounding from +0.1% Q/Q in Q1) and +1.7% Y/Y. The data was also in line with the RBNZ's May MPS estimate. Core inflation accelerated to 1.7% Y/Y from 1.5%. However, analysts at UBS still look for a 25bps rate cut from the central bank at the August meeting: \"It would have taken a material upside surprise to have any influence on our expectation for an August OCR cut – this was not forthcoming,\" UBS writes. But the bank notes that, \"at the margin, and accepting that the immediate outlook for monetary policy is probably going to be more about domestic/global growth and risks thereof, a lift in the RBNZ's preferred measure of underlying inflation would introduce an element of caution about what happens beyond August.\" Thus, the bank believes that while another cut in November is a risk (and will also depend on the action at other major central banks) it is not its base-case.</p><p><strong>* CHF: </strong>With the market looking for easing from the ECB next week, watch the CHF, SocGen says. PPI slowed in June sharply, which will once again stoke fears of deflation in Switzerland. \"The SNB is sitting on the fence, with a bias to intervene, but it will have to dust off what’s left of its (un)conventional policy tool box if the ECB pulls the trigger on rates and/or QE2 next week or after the summer,\" SocGen writes. \"A 10bps deposit rate cut by the ECB would almost certainly be followed by a cut of the same magnitude in the SNB's 3m Libor midpoint from -0.75% to -0.85% to keep the rate differential constant.\" SocGen notes that the rise in PPI deflation is dovetailing with CHF appreciation: \"All the talk of late has been about dollar intervention, but the closer EURCHF gets to 1.10, the higher the probability that the SNB will act before the US Treasury.\" With that said, global trade wars and Brexit will make it difficult to completely mitigate support for the CHF between now and October (when the Brexit extension expires), SocGen says.</p><p><strong>* BRL: </strong>After the Pension Reform vote cleared the Lower House last week, attention is now on the Senate Vote, where 49 of the 81 votes are required. Reports suggest that the government can count on the support of 42, and this shortfall could mean that a vote is pushed back, perhaps until the Congressional recess in August. The key metric to watch is the savings amount (currently estimated at around USD 980bln over a 10-year horizon - if amendments are added that waters down that number, it could pile pressure onto the BRL, some desks warn; a positive outcome, however, could see USDBRL fall to 3.60.</p><p><strong>* CNY: </strong>UBS recommends keeping an eye on the upcoming Politburo meeting, as well as trade war negotiations, for any change in China's policy direction in H2. The bank says that assuming no further trade war escalation, it expects only modest additional easing and no major new stimulus, and UBS also expects the PBOC to cut RRR by 100 bps, as well as increasing liquidity offering, but not to cut benchmark rates; UBS also expects a modest easing on local government financing.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD/CAD</strong></p><p>US Dollar bulls are back in the driving seat after significantly stringer than expected US retail sales data, and a particularly buoyant control group that extended a run of positive prints to 4 months in June. The beats vs consensus more than overshadowed a slender ip miss to boost the Greenback almost across the board, but with the Loonie holding up better than the rest in major terms after Canadian securities tallies for may (albeit belatedly). Usd/Cad is still straddling 1.3050 even though the <strong>DXY</strong> has cemented gains above the psychological 97.000 to a 97.342 peak and is back within striking distance of 97.500 ahead of chart resistance at 97.588 (last Tuesday’s high).</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>Already the clear G10 underperformer, the Pound lost more ground as a series of technical levels and symbolic or sentimental numbers gave way, like 1.2500 and 1.2450 vs the Buck and 0.9000 then 0.9025 against the Euro. The catalyst remains the same for Sterling sellers, ongoing UK political uncertainty and knock-on implications for Brexit as the clock ticks down to October 31. On that note, reports circulated that front-runner to replace outgoing UK PM May could schedule the Queen’s Speech form early November and effectively send MPs home for 2 weeks in October. Hence, not even blow-out wages came to Gbp’s rescue for more than a brief period as Cable proceeded to retest flash crash lows circa 1.2409 ahead of purported option barriers at 1.2400, and Eur/Gbp reached 0.9040+ before paring back.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The renowned safe-havens have both lost ground in wake of the aforementioned upbeat US consumption numbers, which nudged July FOMC easing expectations further towards 25 bp from 50 bp, like headline NFP. The Franc slipped from around 0.9837 at best towards 0.9890 and Yen to roughly 108.25 compared to 107.83 or so as UST/JGB yields diverged.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars look set to end Tuesday’s EU session on a more even keel as Aud/Usd sits a bit more comfortably above 0.7000 within a 0.7044-24 range vs Nzd/Usd in danger of losing grip of 0.6700 between 0.6737-09 parameters. The Kiwi did not get any support or impetus from deent rebounds in GDT auction prices and having failed to build on post-NZ Q2 inflation momentum overnight may turn technically weaker if it fails to reclaim the 200 DMA at 0.6718 and/or retreats through 1.0500 on the cross.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Encouraging Turkish jobs and fiscal data may have helped Usd/Try buck the broad trend as the Foreign Ministry vowed to continue drilling regardless of EU sanctions, but Usd/Mxn rebounded to 19.0700 from 18.9560 even though some details of aid for PEMEX were unveiled. Note, the Lira actually peered above 5.7000 within a moderately firmer range vs the Dollar down to 5.7230.</p>",

Crude had been drifting lower with gratitude to the gradual de-escalation of weather concerns in the Gulf of Mexico, additionally, the EIA on Monday said it expects US shale output to rise to a record 8.55mln BPD (it upped its view by 49k BPD) is offering some dampening effect. Worth highlighting that RBOB gasoline, which has been known to lead price movement in energy markets, has been trading lower and breaking through technical levels, which PVM analysts suggest, “It is not advised to be long. Be prepared for weakness.”</p><p>Looking into the EIA drilling report, although it forecasts the 49k BPD rise in production for August in the Shale region, this is yet another month of a declining rate of growth in tight oil plays. The August 2018 forecast by the EIA had production rising by 143k BPD, and the March 2019 forecast was 84k, the general trend has been moving lower. Production has been saturating in the US after a long run of cash abundant Shale producers draining oil reservoirs and eventually yielding less as drilling locations become less far-and-wide apart. This has been part of the rationale for consolidation in the US E&amp;P sector as the smaller inefficient producers face an exodus, where Callon Petroleum (CPE) acquiring Carrizo (CRZO) in an all-stock deal is the latest shake-up. The deal expresses the desperation in the sector, Carrizo has agreed to the transaction with its share price near record lows. The deal rings alarm bells as - until recently - E&amp;P players in the Shale region usually banked on waiting for the next activity pickup in the sector. Carrizo clearly isn’t confident this time around.</p>",

Sectors are mixed with some mild underperformance seen in energy names following yesterday’s decline in the complex. In terms of individual movers, Burberry (+12.0%) dominates the Stoxx 600 after sales growth topped estimates in Q1, whilst earnings also supported Yara (+3.6%) shares. On the flip side, Telenor (-5.4%) plumbed the depths despite an upgrade at DNB Markets as the Co’s Q2 adj. EBITDA fell short of expectations. Elsewhere, Daimler (-1.0%) and Fiat Chrysler (-3.6%) shares moved accordingly to initiations at Goldman Sachs. Other notable movers include Bayer (+1.5%) which received some reprieve after a US reduced damages award against Co. in Roundup case to USD 25.3mln vs. Prev.

Debt markets remain tentative after the recent sharp pull-back and will need several further sessions like Monday to establish a firm base or return to bear steepening mode and an even more pronounced retracement of the early July rally. In terms of today’s agenda, ZEW is scheduled before some key US data and there’s a raft of Fed speakers following ECB’s de Galhau including Powell that collectively could offer more clues about the size of a likely rate cut at the end of month FOMC.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly subdued with the region indecisive following the modest finish on Wall St where all major indices notched fresh record highs before pulling back on cautiousness heading into earnings season. ASX 200 (+0.1%) is choppy as weakness across energy and financials offset the upside in mining names including Rio Tinto, as record high iron ore prices in China helped shares in the industry giant shrug off a decline in Q2 output and shipments. Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) underperforms on return from the extended weekend as it reacts to the recent downside in USD/JPY, while Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) are lacklustre as markets digest a slew of corporate earnings and guidance announcements but with downside also stemmed after the PBoC injected liquidity via open market operations following a 3-week hiatus.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains firm and eyes a retest of the 97.00 level to the upside after the prior day’s gains, partially spurred by better than expected NY Fed Manufacturing data which showed the largest monthly increase in over 2 years. As such, its transatlantic counterparts are subdued with EUR/USD languishing near 1.1250 where there is a notable option expiry for today’s New York cut, while GBP/USD is stuck at the prior day’s lows and within close proximity to the 1.2500 level. In terms of the relevant stories, the Brexit negotiators’ meeting last week was said to be one of the most difficult with officials poising themselves for more hostile talks under the next UK government, and a recent note from Deutsche Bank suggested the probability of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit is at 45%. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is range-bound after having failed to sustain an early reclaim of the 108.00 handle and antipodeans are also relatively uneventful with only a muted reaction seen in AUD/USD from the RBA minutes which stated the board will adjust policy if needed to support growth which suggests the central bank will likely be data dependent, while NZD/USD gradually benefitted after Q2 CPI data printed inline with expectations.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher following the recent upside in T-notes and amid the weakness in overnight risk sentiment, while the BoJ are also present in the market for 5yr-10yr JGBs.</p>",

        "content": "<p>At the meeting, the RBA cut the Cash Rate Target by 25bps for a 2nd consecutive meeting to 1.00% which was expected as ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures had priced in as high as 89% probability for rates to be cut. The RBA stated that it lowered the Cash Rate to support employment growth and provide greater confidence on inflation.</p><p>The RBA’s statement noted that the economy can sustain a lower rate of unemployment and that employment growth remains strong, while it added that the outlook for the global economy remains reasonable but also commented downside risks from trade disputes are affecting investment globally. Furthermore, RBA Governor Lowe commented shortly after the meeting that 2 two cuts the Board delivered recently will make an important contribution to putting the economy on a better path and winding back spare capacity, although the Board is prepared to adjust interest rates again if needed to move closer to full employment and achieve the inflation target.</p><p>The initial reaction in AUD/USD to the rate announcement was to the downside although this was eventually pared as the statement didn’t provide much on forward guidance, while participants will be scrutinizing these minutes for any insight to support market expectations of another cut in November or whether it is a 'two and done' from the RBA.</p>",
