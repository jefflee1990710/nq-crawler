In separate news, German Chancellor Merkel has reportedly proposed an EU-China summit in 2020 alongside EU Presidency elections. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The government is widely expected to fail in its bid to get the legislation through the House of Commons on Tuesday, with this outcome largely priced in to UK assets; any defeat by less than 100 votes would be counted as a good result. UK PM May stated once again that if her deal is rejected, the outcomes will be a no deal Brexit or potentially no Brexit at all while she does not believe the March 29th Brexit date should be delayed. The goal however is to get support on the basis of DUP and Conservative votes. In latest news, sources suggesting that the ERG would be voting with the government tomorrow, were soon denied by Steve Baker who announced that Brexiteers will be voting against the Brexit plan. Alongside this, another conservative whip Gareth Johnson resigned in opposition to the proposed Brexit plan, adding to the slew of resignations that have hit the government in the last few months. On the EU side, there were reassurances that the UK are committed to work on a trade deal by December 2020 to avoid triggering the Irish backstop, stating that if used, the backstop will be temporary until a better solution is found. The EU however does not agree on a time limit for this option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Clarida (Neutral, Voter) stated that the Fed can be &quot;very patient&quot; this year and that FOMC will take policy decisions &quot;meeting by meeting&quot;. He does not believe that the Fed policy is a headwind for the economy since the momentum is good, with no recession on the horizon. Nonetheless he highlighted that some global data has been softening and, even though the slowdown in global outlook isn&#39;t &quot;severe&quot; yet, it tends to impact US exports. He won&#39;t hesitate&quot; to adjust asset-portfolio runoff or monetary policy if required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.08 LOWER AT USD 50.51/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.49 AT USD 58.99/BBL. </strong>Weak China trade data overnight hit risk assets, with crude takings its cues from equities once again, WTI traded down to around 50.60 and Brent to around 59.40; however, as the Europeans and then US traders got to their desk, the bias was for a modest upward grind. On the China data, Citi noted that from a crude perspective, the data was mixed: &quot;crude oil imports for December showed only a minor 1.2% decline from the record set in November, while this could represent an opportunistic purchase of additional barrels on the price decline &ndash; buying the dip &ndash; we see the appetite as supportive as long as it lasts.&quot; On the supply side, OPEC said it will be holding its next JMMC meetings in Baku on 17/18 March; according to a reporter at Energy Intelligence, the feeling is that the same pact needs to be extended for another six months, which would take it through until the end of the year. Elsewhere, the Saudi energy minister Al-Falih remarked that the global economic slowdown would not impact the oil market, and in geopolitics, South Korea is set to receive the first Iranian cargo of crude following a four-month pause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURE (H9) SETTLS 1+ TICKS SLOWER AT 121-29. </strong>Treasuries were bid at the European open amid disappointing Chinese imports and exports figures; the complex stabilised at the European close but then ended today&rsquo;s US session mixed. Yields at the front end and longer end were slightly negative while the belly of the curve slightly positive, moves were less than 1bps. The yield curve saw some steepening mostly seen in 2s30s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.53% at 2582, NDX -0.91% at 6541, DJI -0.36% at 23910. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -0.21%, Materials -0.78%, Industrials -0.04%, Cons Discretionary -0.69%, Cons Staples -0.50%, Healthcare -1.18%, Financials +0.70%, Tech -0.92%, Telecoms -0.41%, Utilities -2.25%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Citigroup (C) initiated earnings from the financial sector reporting a miss on revenue estimates, but a beat on EPS estimates. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) outperformed after raising Q4 guidance, other retailers L Brands (LB), HanesBrands (HBI) and Ralph Lauren (RL) opened in the green too. PG&amp;E (PCG) almost halved in market value on the open following its file for bankruptcy and CEO resignation. Apple (AAPL) opened lower amid yet more negative sales figures from suppliers, this time Germany&rsquo;s Dialog Semiconductor (DLG GY). Western Digital (WDC) nosedived on the back of a downgrade at Evercore, other semiconductor stock Micron Technology (MU) was another underperformer following Morgan Stanley cutting its FY19 profit estimates. Newmont Mining (NEM) dipped on reports of its all-stock acquisition of Goldcorp (G), valued at USD 10bln. Delta Airlines (DAL) suffered from a downgrade at BAML ahead of its earnings report tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY, EUR: </strong>Choppy trade in a tight 95.53-72 range as the US government shutdown extends to its longest in history. DXY was little moved as US President Trump spoke to press on his way to New Orleans where he provided some relief to stock markets as he expressed trade optimism alongside unwillingness to call US national emergency. Meanwhile, the EUR experienced a docile session amid a lack of catalysts and as the single currency largely took its cue from the Dollar. EUR/USD traded sideways above 1.1450 throughout most of the session after shrugging off the below forecast industrial production figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CNY, JPY, CHF:</strong> The major G10 movers in light of disappointing Chinese trade balance overnight in which exports unexpectedly fell 4.4%, the biggest, monthly drop in two years, while imports marked the largest decline since July 2016. As such, trade-sensitive AUD lost the 0.7200 handle and fell to an intraday low of 0.7176 (vs high 0.7218) before finding some support around its 100 DMA at 0.7180 while NZD/USD fell to test its 200 DMA to the downside at 0.6797. Shortly after the Wall St. open, the Aussie and Kiwi experienced a short-lived bid as US President Trump provided markets with optimism regarding US-Sino trade. AUD/USD retested 0.7200 to the upside while NZD/USD gained more ground above 0.6800. Elsewhere, the CNY kicked the week off on a firmer footing amid a stronger PBoC CNY fix at 6.7560 (vs. Prev. 6.7909), though the disappointing trade data erased the Yuan&rsquo;s opening gains as USD/CNH sat near intraday highs of 6.7766 (vs. low of 6.7391).&nbsp; Finally, safe-haven demand spurred by global growth fears strengthened the Yen to 108.00 per dollar at one point. USD/JPY fluctuated in a narrow 108.00-25 band throughout most of European trade ahead of a key Fib at 107.91, though the pair settled on the upper end of the range as President Trump stated is not looking to call a national emergency alongside optimistic trade comments. Similarly, CHF experienced a safe-haven bid alongside the Yen as the USD/CHF fell below its 50 and 200 HMAs at around 0.9830 ahead of its 100 HMA at 0.9805.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Another rollercoaster day for the Pound amid the ongoing quarrel in the UK Parliament ahead of the meaningful vote scheduled for 19:00GMT tomorrow, where PM May&rsquo;s deal is widely expected to be defeated. Following a relatively subdued European session, Sterling received some impetus as PM May delivered her first speech of the day shortly after the release of the EU assurances which offered little in way of legally-binding material MPs sough for. Sky News then reported the resignation of yet another Senior figure, Tory Whip Gareth Johnson which in turn marginally pressured Sterling as participants noted the bad sign of a whip&rsquo;s resignation instead of persuading MPs to vote for the deal. The Pound later received some reprieve amid source reports that Theresa May is considering backing a Tory MP amendment to her deal which would set December 2021 as the end date for the backstop in an effort to win votes for the meaningful vote tomorrow. Cable rose from 1.2842 to a high print of 1.2865 before paring back a bulk of the move to stabilise around 1.2855; a second bout of Sterling demand sent the pair firmly above 1.2860, which however was short-lived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRY: </strong>Again, the stand-out EM underperformer, though USD/TRY fell back to sub-5.50 levels after hovering above the figure for most of the session amid a tweet by US President Trump over the weekend where he threatened to devastate Turkey if Turkey hits the Kurds, subsequently pouring cold water over the relationship between the countries.</p>\r\n",

On the China data, Citi noted that from a crude perspective, the data was mixed: &quot;crude oil imports for December showed only a minor 1.2% decline from the record set in November, while this could represent an opportunistic purchase of additional barrels on the price decline &ndash; buying the dip &ndash; we see the appetite as supportive as long as it lasts.&quot; On the supply side, OPEC said it will be holding its next JMMC meetings in Baku on 17/18 March; according to a reporter at Energy Intelligence, the feeling is that the same pact needs to be extended for another six months, which would take it through until the end of the year. Elsewhere, the Saudi energy minister Al-Falih remarked that the global economic slowdown would not impact the oil market, and in geopolitics, South Korea is set to receive the first Iranian cargo of crude following a four-month pause.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUZ, NZD, CNY, JPY, CHF&ndash;</strong> The major G10 movers in light of disappointing Chinese trade balance overnight in which exports unexpectedly fell 4.4%, the biggest, monthly drop in two years, while imports marked the largest decline since July 2016. As such, trade-sensitive AUD lost the 0.7200 handle and fell to an intraday low of 0.7176 (vs high 0.7218) before finding some support around its 100 DMA at 0.7180 while NZD/USD fell to test its 200 DMA to the downside at 0.6797. Shortly after the Wall St. open, the Aussie and Kiwi experienced a short-lived bid as US President Trump provided markets with optimism regarding US-Sino trade. AUD/USD retested 0.7200 to the upside while NZD/USD gained more ground above 0.6800. Elsewhere, the CNY kicked the week off on a firmer footing amid a stronger PBoC CNY fix at 6.7560 (vs. Prev. 6.7909), though the disappointing trade data erased the Yuan&rsquo;s opening gains as USD/CNH sat near intraday highs of 6.7766 (vs. low of 6.7391). &nbsp;Finally, safe-haven demand spurred by global growth fears strengthened the Yen to 108.00 per dollar at one point. USD/JPY fluctuated in a narrow 108.00-25 band throughout most of European trade ahead of a key Fib at 107.91, though the pair settled on the upper end of the range as President Trump stated is not looking to call a national emergency alongside optimistic trade comments. Similarly, CHF experienced a safe-haven bid alongside the Yen as the USD/CHF fell below its 50 and 200 HMAs at around 0.9830 ahead of its 100 HMA at 0.9805.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP </strong>&ndash; Another rollercoaster day for the Pound amid the ongoing quarrel in the UK Parliament ahead of the meaningful vote scheduled for 19:00GMT tomorrow, where PM May&rsquo;s deal is widely expected to be defeated. Following a relatively subdued European session, Sterling received some impetus as PM May delivered her first speech of the day shortly after the release of the EU assurances which offered little in way of legally-binding material MPs sough for. Sky News then reported the resignation of yet another Senior figure, Tory Whip Gareth Johnson which in turn marginally pressured Sterling as participants noted the bad sign of a whip&rsquo;s resignation instead of persuading MPs to vote for the deal. The Pound later received some reprieve amid source reports that Theresa May is considering backing a Tory MP amendment to her deal which would set December 2021 as the end date for the backstop in an effort to win votes for the meaningful vote tomorrow. Cable rose from 1.2842 to a high print of 1.2865 before pairing back a bulk of the move to stabilise around 1.2855, though a second bout of Sterling demand sent the pair firmly above 1.2860 ahead of its 100 DMA at 1.2893.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY, EUR</strong> &ndash; Choppy trade in a tight 95.53-72 range as the US government shutdown extends to its longest in history. DXY was little moved as US President Trump spoke to press on his way to New Orleans where he provided some relief to stock markets as he expressed trade optimism alongside unwillingness to call US national emergency. Meanwhile, the EUR experienced a docile session amid a lack of catalysts and as the single currency largely took its cue from the Dollar. EUR/USD traded sideways above 1.1450 throughout most of the session after shrugging off the below forecast industrial production figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRY </strong>&ndash; Again, the stand-out EM underperformer, though USD/TRY fell back to sub-5.50 levels after hovering above the figure for most of the session amid a tweet by US President Trump over the weekend where he threatened to devastate Turkey if Turkey hits the Kurds, subsequently pouring cold water over the relationship between the countries.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Core EU &amp; UK debt futures have added to their upside with both Gilts and Bunds hitting fresh session peaks of 123.29 and 164.88 respectively as the sour risk tone extends into the European afternoon. Gilts are bearing the brunt of the Brexit-driven confidence beating with the UK benchmark still, albeit marginally, the sector outperformer after Conservative Whip Johnson resigned due to opposition to the Brexit deal and ahead of PM May&rsquo;s address to the HoC later in the day. On a technical standpoint 10-year Gilt traders will be eyeing the 123.50 level on the upside as resistance, with the 123.00 level as support. In the periphery, BTPs remain the underperformer with the Italian 10-year benchmark stalling around the 126.50 area and saw an additional bout of pressure after the Italian Treasury said they have mandated banks to sell a new 15-year BTP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UST futures remain on the front foot and have printed a new marginal session and weekly high of 122-09 in the 10-year line, with most of the action being seen in the belly of the curve. From a technical standpoint traders are eyeing the January 7th high of 122-15 as the next resistance level on the upside should the already sour risk tone be dampened further throughout the US session. Eyes are firmly set on potential updates on the US Government shutdown, Trade and the WaPo Trump-Russia story as potential drivers for todays moves in a data-barren session.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (Unch.) failed to hold on to early gains as strength in Telecoms and its largest weighted Financials sector was eventually overwhelmed by losses in the broader market, while KOSPI (-0.5%) was lacklustre amid softness in the index heavyweights including Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor. Hang Seng (-1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) were also pressured as Chinese Exports and Imports figures took a further hit from the US-China trade dispute, although losses in the mainland were capped after the PBoC injected liquidity to the interbank market in which it utilized 28-day reverse repos for the first time since June last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day and CNY 20bln in 28-day reverse repos for a net daily injection of CNY 20bln.

In separate reports, the UK government commented that any defeat by less than 100 votes on Tuesday would be counted as a good result. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Assurances to UK say they are committed to work on a trade deal by Dec. 2020 to avoid triggering the Irish backstop; backstop will be temporary until a better solution is found. EU has a desire that the withdrawal agreement will be ratified, with the current deal the best outcome. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, reports in The Times noted that Brussels expects the UK to ask for an extension to Article 50 to allow Brexit to be delayed if the House of Commons rejects Theresa May&rsquo;s deal tomorrow, while there were separate reports that Pro-EU MPs are said to publish draft legislation on Monday for a 2nd referendum.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBC&#39;s Katya Adler tweets, in today&rsquo;s EU letter of assurances on Brexit deal, the real message to MPs to help Theresa May is the EU&#39;s insistence that, as PM claims, this deal is the ONLY deal on offer, none of my European contacts believe this letter will get the deal passed on Tuesday.

(WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European Indices are in the red [Euro Stoxx 50 -1.0%], with some underperformance seen in the SMI (-1.1%) weighed on by poor performance in luxury names such as Richemont (-2.1%) and Swatch (-1.0%) following poor Chinese trade data. Other luxury names including Pandora (-6.5%), and LVMH (-3.5%) are in the red on the back of this as well; Burberry (+0.3%) is bucking the luxury trend after being upgraded at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sectors are similarly in the red with some slight outperformance seen in healthcare. Other notable movers include Next (-2.9%) in the red after being downgraded at Credit Suisse, and Dialog Semiconductor (+4.3%) after reporting a 7% Y/Y increase in full year revenue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PG&amp;E (PCG) said to be in discussions with banks about multi-billion dollar bankruptcy financing and may inform employees on Monday it is preparing a bankruptcy filing for January 29th.; the Co&rsquo;s CEO Williams is leaving with general council John Simon to takeover in the interim. Company shares are down 50% pre-market. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CNY/JPY &ndash; The major G10 movers, all in the aftermath of below-forecast Chinese trade data as exports and imports both declined to a 6-month low in USD terms vs. expected rises. As such trade-proxy AUD/USD fell around 0.4% to test its 100 DMA at around 0.7180 while NZD/USD declined 0.3% to test its 200 DMA at around 0.6797, ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6789 as the technicals are still poised to form a golden cross. Meanwhile, global-growth fears sparked safe-haven demand into the Yen as USD/JPY tested 108.00 to the downside ahead of a Fib level at 107.91, of note 1.1bln in option expiries sit between 108.00-15. Finally, the Yuan snapped a three-day winning streak but remains sub-6.80 vs. the greenback, though the currency is of course dampened by the disappointing trade figures, USD/CNY is capped by a firmer PBoC CNY fix of 6.7560 (Prev. 6.7909). In terms of techincals, USD/CNH breached its 50 HMA to the upside at 6.7692 with the 100 HMA above the 6.8000 level. It is also worth noting that Goldman Sachs raised their 3, 6, 12 month USD/CNH forecast to 6.80 (Prev. 6.95), 6.80 (Prev. 7.10) and 6.70 (Prev. 6.90) respectively citing an improvement in sentiment around US-Sino trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Relatively docile session for the buck thus far as the index sits around the middle of tight 95.527-726 range as the US government shutdown extends to the longest in history. Subsequently, the US data originally scheduled for release today (building permits, advanced goods trade balance and durable goods) have been cancelled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, EUR &ndash; Both little changed on the day, while the latter is largely fluctuating with the dollar and the Pound awaits tomorrows meaningful vote, which was originally scheduled for December 11th last year. The deal is widely expected to be voted down and BBC reports that around 100 Tory and the 10 DUP MPs are expected to join the Labour and the opposition parties in voting against the deal. In terms of where we stand with Brexit, PM May is to deliver a speech at 15:30 GMT where she will warn that Parliament is more likely to block Brexit rather than let Britain leave without a deal. Furthermore, the assurances provided by Brussels are also understood to not be enough to sway MPs towards PM May&rsquo;s deal scheduled for 19:00GMT tomorrow. Cable was largely unfazed by the release of the EU assurances which offered little in the way of legally-binding material MPs sough for. From a technical standpoint, Cable recently saw a pop higher and rests just below its 100 DMA at 1.2893 with no notable option expiries for the day. Going back to the EUR, the currency was relatively unmoved by below-forecast industrial production figures following Germany&rsquo;s dismal IP release last week. EUR/USD is currently below its 100 DMA at 1.1476 and in close proximity to the psychological (and 200 HMA) at 1.1450, while there is nothing notable to report regarding option expiries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY &ndash; The stand-out EM underperformer as USD/TRY reclaimed 5.50 to the upside amid a tweet by US President Trump over the weekend where he threatened to devastate Turkey if Turkey hits the Kurds, subsequently pouring cold water over what seemed like a fruitful relationship between the countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The risk off tone after disappointing Chinese Export figures is lifting Core EU debt ahead of UK PM May&rsquo;s speech later in the day where she is set to say that a no-Brexit is more likely than a no-deal situation, a turn of events she has branded as a &ldquo;catastrophe for democracy&rdquo;. This alongside suggestions that pro-EU MPs are looking to publish draft legislation for a 2nd referendum has seen 10year Gilt futures rally into outperformance and trade near a session best of 123.19. German 10-year futures marginally lag their UK counterparts and trade in the top end of a 164.43-164.69 range. The BTP/Bund spread has narrowed marginally this morning to 260 bps, whilst a Bank of Italy director stated that this measure has not had an impact on bank capital but citing caution should it increase again. BTPs are the European underperformer, however, and trade under 126.50 with Deutsche Bank stating that the revised Italian growth figure of 1% is still optimistic as the Italian economy is losing steam and the new fiscal plan is &ldquo;barely expansionary&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, as the US Government Shutdown runs into record length UST futures are benefitting from the sour risk tone with strength seen across the curve and outperformance noted in the long end. 10-yr futures hit a one week high of 122-09 overnight after the Chinese exports figures which noted a 4.4% decline YY, with further support offered by WaPo&rsquo;s suggestions that US President Trump hid details of face-to-face talks with Russian President Putin, as concerns about global growth and political instability remain the dominating factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.4%) and WTI (-1.6%) prices are in the red, just below USD 60.00/bbl and USD 51.00/bbl respectively, as the risk tone stemming from the ongoing US government shutdown and disappointing Chinese trade data weighs on markets. Regarding China, December oil imports of 10.35mln BPD, down from November&rsquo;s figure but up from the 7.97mln BPD for December 2017. Separately, Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih stated that in his opinion OPEC+ has taken enough action to balance the oil market this year, and that there is no need for an extraordinary OPEC meeting before April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.4%) is in the green, towards the sessions high of USD 1294.57/oz as the aforementioned risk tone weighs on markets. Elsewhere, China&rsquo;s 2018 iron ore imports fell -1% Y/Y, the first yearly decline since 2010. In contrast China&rsquo;s 2018 copper imports increased 12.9% to a record high of 5.3mln tonnes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih stated there is no need for an extraordinary OPEC meeting before April and that the oil market is on the right track. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China 2018 copper concentrates and ore imports at record high, while 2018 unwrought aluminium and product exports also at a record high. However, China December iron ore imports felt to the lowest since June at 86.1mln tons. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

Other luxury names including Pandora (-6.5%), and LVMH (-2.8%) are in the red on the back of this as well; Burberry (+1.0%) is bucking the luxury trend after being upgraded at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sectors are similarly in the red with some slight outperformance seen in healthcare. Other notable movers include Next (-2.8%) in the red after being downgraded at Credit Suisse, and Dialog Semiconductor (+3.3%) after reporting a 7% Y/Y increase in full year revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CNY/JPY &ndash; The major G10 movers, all in the aftermath of below-forecast Chinese trade data as exports and imports both declined to a 6-month low in USD terms vs. expected rises. As such trade-proxy AUD/USD fell around 0.4% to test its 100 DMA at around 0.7180 while NZD/USD declined 0.3% to test its 200 DMA at around 0.6797, ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6789 as the technicals are still poised to form a golden cross. Meanwhile, global-growth fears sparked safe-haven demand into the Yen as USD/JPY tested 108.00 to the downside ahead of a Fib level at 107.91, of note 1.1bln in option expiries sit between 108.00-15. Finally, the Yuan snapped a three-day winning streak but remains sub-6.80 vs. the greenback, though the currency is of course dampened by the disappointing trade figures, USD/CNY is capped by a firmer PBoC CNY fix of 6.7560 (Prev. 6.7909). In terms of techincals, USD/CNH breached its 50 HMA to the upside at 6.7692 with the 100 HMA above the 6.8000 level. It is also worth noting that Goldman Sachs raised their 3, 6, 12 month USD/CNH forecast to 6.80 (Prev. 6.95), 6.80 (Prev. 7.10) and 6.70 (Prev. 6.90) respectively citing an improvement in sentiment around US-Sino trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Relatively docile session for the buck thus far as the index sits around the middle of tight 95.527-726 range as the US government shutdown extends to the longest in history. Subsequently, the US data originally scheduled for release today (building permits, advanced goods trade balance and durable goods) have been cancelled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, EUR &ndash; Both little changed on the day, while the latter is largely fluctuating with the dollar and the Pound awaits tomorrows meaningful vote, which was originally scheduled for December 11th last year. The deal is widely expected to be voted down and BBC reports that around 100 Tory and the 10 DUP MPs are expected to join the Labour and the opposition parties in voting against the deal. In terms of where we stand with Brexit, PM May is to deliver a speech at 15:30 GMT where she will warn that Parliament is more likely to block Brexit rather than let Britain leave without a deal. Furthermore, the assurances provided by Brussels are also understood to not be enough to sway MPs towards PM May&rsquo;s deal scheduled for 19:00GMT tomorrow. From a technical standpoint, Cable recently saw a pop higher and rests just below its 100 DMA at 1.2893 with no notable option expiries for the day. Going back to the EUR, the currency was relatively unmoved by below-forecast industrial production figures following Germany&rsquo;s dismal IP release last week. EUR/USD is currently below its 100 DMA at 1.1476 and in close proximity to the psychological (and 200 HMA) at 1.1450, while there is nothing notable to report regarding option expiries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY &ndash; The stand-out EM underperformer as USD/TRY reclaimed 5.50 to the upside amid a tweet by US President Trump over the weekend where he threatened to devastate Turkey if Turkey hits the Kurds, subsequently pouring cold water over what seemed like a fruitful relationship between the countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The risk off tone after disappointing Chinese Export figures is lifting Core EU debt ahead of UK PM May&rsquo;s speech later in the day where she is set to say that a no-Brexit is more likely than a no-deal situation, a turn of events she has branded as a &ldquo;catastrophe for democracy&rdquo;. This alongside suggestions that pro-EU MPs are looking to publish draft legislation for a 2nd referendum has seen 10-year Gilt futures rally into outperformance and trade near a session best of 123.19. German 10-year futures marginally lag their UK counterparts and trade in the top end of a 164.43-164.69 range. The BTP/Bund spread has narrowed marginally this morning to 260 bps, whilst a Bank of Italy director stated that this measure has not had an impact on bank capital but citing caution should it increase again. BTPs are the European underperformer, however, and trade under 126.50 with Deutsche Bank stating that the revised Italian growth figure of 1% is still optimistic as the Italian economy is losing steam and the new fiscal plan is &ldquo;barely expansionary&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, as the US Government Shutdown runs into record length UST futures are benefitting from the sour risk tone with strength seen across the curve and outperformance noted in the long end. 10-yr futures hit a one week high of 122-08 overnight after the Chinese exports figures which noted a 4.4% decline YY, with further support offered by WaPo&rsquo;s suggestions that US President Trump hid details of face-to-face talks with Russian President Putin, as concerns about global growth and political instability remain the dominating factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.5%) and WTI (-1.5%) prices are in the red, just below USD 60.00/bbl and USD 51.00/bbl respectively, as the risk tone stemming from the ongoing US government shutdown and disappointing Chinese trade data weighs on markets. Regarding China, December oil imports of 10.35mln BPD, down from November&rsquo;s figure but up from the 7.97mln BPD for December 2017. Separately, Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih stated that in his opinion OPEC+ has taken enough action to balance the oil market this year, and that there is no need for an extraordinary OPEC meeting before April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.4%) is in the green, towards the sessions high of USD 1294.57/oz as the aforementioned risk tone weighs on markets. Elsewhere, China&rsquo;s 2018 iron ore imports fell -1% Y/Y, the first yearly decline since 2010. In contrast China&rsquo;s 2018 copper imports increased 12.9% to a record high of 5.3mln tonnes.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "FX Morning Colour: China trade reignites growth fears, while UK gears up for tomorrow’s meaningful vote",
        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD/CNY/JPY </strong>&ndash; The major G10 movers, all in the aftermath of below-forecast Chinese trade data as exports and imports both declined to a 6-month low in USD terms vs. expected rises. As such trade-proxy AUD/USD fell around 0.4% to test its 100 DMA at around 0.7180 while NZD/USD declined 0.3% to test its 200 DMA at around 0.6797, ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6789 as the technicals are still poised to form a golden cross. Meanwhile, global-growth fears sparked safe-haven demand into the Yen as USD/JPY tested 108.00 to the downside ahead of a Fib level at 107.91, of note 1.1bln in option expiries sit between 108.00-15. Finally, the Yuan snapped a three-day winning streak but remains sub-6.80 vs. the greenback, though the currency is of course dampened by the disappointing trade figures, USD/CNY is capped by a firmer PBoC CNY fix of 6.7560 (Prev. 6.7909). In terms of techincals, USD/CNH breached its 50 HMA to the upside at 6.7692 with the 100 HMA above the 6.8000 level. It is also worth noting that Goldman Sachs raised their 3, 6, 12 month USD/CNH forecast to 6.80 (Prev. 6.95), 6.80 (Prev. 7.10) and 6.70 (Prev. 6.90) respectively citing an improvement in sentiment around US-Sino trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; Relatively docile session for the buck thus far as the index sits around the middle of tight 95.527-726 range as the US government shutdown extends to the longest in history. Subsequently, the US data originally scheduled for release today (building permits, advanced goods trade balance and durable goods) have been cancelled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong>, <strong>EUR </strong>&ndash; Both little changed on the day, while the latter is largely fluctuating with the dollar and the Pound awaits tomorrows meaningful vote, which was originally scheduled for December 11th last year. The deal is widely expected to be voted down and BBC reports that around 100 Tory and the 10 DUP MPs are expected to join the Labour and the opposition parties in voting against the deal. In terms of where we stand with Brexit, PM May is to deliver a speech at 15:30 GMT where she will warn that Parliament is more likely to block Brexit rather than let Britain leave without a deal. Furthermore, the assurances provided by Brussels are also understood to not be enough to sway MPs towards PM May&rsquo;s deal scheduled for 19:00GMT tomorrow. From a technical standpoint, Cable recently saw a pop higher and rests just below its 100 DMA at 1.2893 with no notable option expiries for the day. Going back to the EUR, the currency was relatively unmoved by below-forecast industrial production figures following Germany&rsquo;s dismal IP release last week. EUR/USD is currently below its 100 DMA at 1.1476 and in close proximity to the psychological (and 200 HMA) at 1.1450, while there is nothing notable to report regarding option expiries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRY </strong>&ndash; The stand-out EM underperformer as USD/TRY reclaimed 5.50 to the upside amid a tweet by US President Trump over the weekend where he threatened to devastate Turkey if Turkey hits the Kurds, subsequently pouring cold water over what seemed like a fruitful relationship between the countries.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (Unch.) failed to hold on to early gains as strength in Telecoms and its largest weighted Financials sector was eventually overwhelmed by losses in the broader market, while KOSPI (-0.7%) was lacklustre amid softness in the index heavyweights including Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor. Hang Seng (-1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) were also pressured as Chinese Exports and Imports figures took a further hit from the US-China trade dispute, although losses in the mainland were capped after the PBoC injected liquidity to the interbank market in which it utilized 28-day reverse repos for the first time since June last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day and CNY 20bln in 28-day reverse repos for a net daily injection of CNY 20bln.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May warned that failure to back her Brexit deal risks a no-deal Brexit and is to say she believes parliament will more likely block Brexit than the UK leave without a deal, according to the PM&#39;s office. In separate reports, the UK government commented that any defeat by less than 100 votes on Tuesday would be counted as a good result.

This mildly benefitted the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts across the pond in which EUR/USD attempted to nurse Friday&rsquo;s losses and GBP/USD held firmly on to the 1.2800 handle, while pressure in USD/JPY was exacerbated amid the risk averse tone and absence of Tokyo participants. However, CNY later gave up most of its gains following the China trade data upset which also showed iron ore imports declined to a 6-month low and coupled with a pullback in oil prices, eventually weighed on commodity-linked currencies.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly lower with weakness in the complex triggered by the risk averse tone, which saw WTI crude futures edge lower to test the USD 51.00/bbl to the downside and pressured Brent crude to beneath USD 60.00/bbl.

The modest bounce continued after an in-line CPI report, though the complex saw some profit-taking towards the European close, sources noted. Yields were lower across the curve at settlement, with most of the action in the belly, where they fell by around 3bps. Major spreads were mixed, with 2s5s and 2s10s narrowing by around 1bps, while 2s30s and 5s30s steepened by 0.5bps and 2bps respectively. US T-note futures (H19) settled 7+ ticks higher at 121-30+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he will not declare a national emergency right now and wants congress to act, while he later stated he will sign a bill for back pay for Federal workers.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week subdued following the indecisive close on Wall St last Friday as the US government shutdown extended to its longest in history, while the absence of Japanese participants for Coming of Age Day and looming Chinese trade data also contributes to the despondent tone. ASX 200 (-0.1%) failed to hold on to early gains as strength in Telecoms and its largest weighted Financials sector was eventually overwhelmed by losses in the broader market, while KOSPI (-0.5%) is lacklustre amid softness in the index heavyweights including Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) are downbeat amid tentativeness ahead of the latest Chinese December trade data which is expected to show a further impact on Exports from the US-China trade dispute, although losses in the mainland are capped after the PBoC conducted reverse repos with a CNY 80bln injection via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 20bln via 28-day reverse repos which was the for the first time the latter was utilized since June last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD is softer as the US government shutdown extends into a record 24th day and with price action largely driven by further China currency strengthening, in which USD/CNY briefly broke below 6.7400 after another firmer reference rate setting by the PBoC. This benefitted most the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts with EUR/USD nursing Friday&rsquo;s losses and GBP/USD holding firmly on to the 1.2800 handle, while pressure in USD/JPY was exacerbated amid the risk averse tone and absence of Tokyo participants. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies are less inspired after the pullback in oil prices and following the initial China trade data releases which showed iron ore imports declined to a 6-month low.</p>\r\n",
