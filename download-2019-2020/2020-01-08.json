Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) continued its rally on the increased risk appetite. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) traded at the bottom of the Dow after a disappointing quarter, as well as expressing some headwinds from withdrawing out of tobacco. Boeing (BA) also trailed the Dow following a fatal 737-800 jet crash in Iran, shortly after take-off in what appears to be a technical fault (although the incident is reportedly being looked at by US intelligence). Conversely, United Health (UNH) topped the index, supported by a PT rise to USD 366 from USD 291, citing a strong longer-term outlook for its OptumHealth unit, as well as its core insurance unit. American Express (AXP) traded higher after the PBOC approved its license to start-up operations in China; competitor Visa (V) and other financials were also firmer. Vertex (VRTX) was a top performer after having its PT raised to USD 265 at both Oppenheimer and Citi, who are both optimistic about its Trikafta launch and the latter naming it a Top Pick. Lennar (LEN) was firmer on a strong quarterly report, supporting homebuilders in general (XHB). Liberty Global (LBTYA) took a haircut after Citi lowered its PT to USD 21 from USD 25, citing a sustained negative outlook.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLE TICKS 12+ LOWER AT 128-24+</strong>. Yields were higher across curve, with a very slight steepening bias, inspired by improving geopolitics in the Middle East, while on the data slate, ADP payrolls surprised to the upside. The US 10-year auction tailed by a chunky 1.6bps basis – the largest since August. However, analyst noted that this was likely a function of geopolitics, which saw 10-year yields drop to as low as 1.7050%, before rising back towards around 1.85% heading into the auction. The rest of the metrics fared better, with cover coming in at 2.45x, a touch above the previous and recent averages. In terms of the breakdown, dealers took down slightly more than recent averages, as did direct bidders, leaving indirects with a takedown below recent averages. SocGen thinks the 30-year sector appears slightly cheap in asset swap. The bank also notes that the current WI is trading below the last two auction stop-out rates, which could indicate relative richness, compared to those auctions. The December 30-year auction saw healthy demand, stopping through by a whopping 2.1bps, and ending the run of tails. SocGen also notes that 5s30s has steepened since the previous auction cycle, which might speak to the relative cheapness of the sector. The bank has a positive bias going into the auction.&nbsp;</p>",

An unnamed White House official reportedly said that Iran's strike was seen as a move that would let Iran retaliate without incurring a potentially devastating US counter assault; there is also a thinking that the Iranian response was designed more to play to its domestic crowd. US President Trump added to the dovish tone, announcing that Iran appears to be standing down, and chose to pursue a sanctions route, rather than military action. Haven assets saw some downside as Trump avoided escalation military tensions in the Middle East. USDJPY and US equity futures continued to rise with both assets printing fresh session highs; cash markets hit an all-time high for the S&amp;P500, and USDJPY broke 109 to the upside. Given there is no current military response from the US, Iran will likely hold fire on any further attacks as they previously announced they would re-attack with a ‘crushing effect’ if the US were to respond. On the JCPOA, Trump called for allies to abandon the deal, noting world powers can work on a new deal. In the tail end of the session it is worth noting a Reuters witness reportedly heard two blasts and sirens in Baghdad, Iraq, although the cause is unknown. Separate reports citing police sources noted three rockets fell inside the greenzone, which is near the US embassy, and resulted in a fire in the greenzone.</p><p><strong>* US ADP: </strong>The ADP's gauge showed 202k payrolls were added to the US economy in December, eclipsing the consensus 160k; the prior also saw a healthy upward revision, to 124k from 60k. Analysts said the data introduced some upside risks for the official employment situation report, due for release on Friday. With that said, the usual caveats were offered, noting that the ADP measure of payrolls uses lagged official NFP data as a variable; this might mean that the December gain was buoyed bu the 266k added in November; but Capital Economics notes that the latter included the impact of GM workers returning from strikes, and that means that the ADP might be overestimating the strength of payroll gains in December. \"Moreover,\" Capital Economics writes, \"the accuracy of the ADP's first estimate of monthly employment growth has never been anywhere near as good as we would have expected given the richness of the data source,\" but nevertheless, \"this latest ADP reading supports our view that employment and GDP growth held up surprisingly well in the fourth quarter, even though some of the survey evidence weakened further.\"</p><p><strong>* US-CHINA: </strong>A congressional study from the US which focused on the treatment of Uighur Muslims, led by GOP Rubio and Democrat McGovern, called for sanctions on China over human rights abuses as the report believes authorities in China may be committing crimes against humanity. The report also called on officials to keep human rights in mind when dealing with Beijing, and even in trade talks. No further comments were made from US officials following the release of the report, nor from the Chinese side, however it is worth noting the Phase One deal was kept as a separate issue from the situation in Hong Kong and human rights issues.</p><p><strong>* WTI (G0) SETTLES USD 3.09 LOWER AT USD 59.61/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLES USD 2.83 LOWER AT USD 65.44/BBL </strong>Energy markets had an erratic 24 hours before ultimately settling significantly lower. Front-month crude futures spiked higher overnight amid the Iranian strike on the US-affiliated base in Iraq, although soon reversed the move after it became clear attack had little serious damage, with no reported US casualties. The move lower was exacerbated after President Trump formally announced the US would not take a military response and instead resort to its usual method of sanctions; Trump also confirmed there had been no US casualties. Elsewhere, the EIA weekly inventory report (bbls) showed crude stocks building 1.2mln, against expectations for a draw, whilst the products both built significantly more than expected (gasoline +9.1mln and distillates +5.3mln); although markedly bearish for an inventory report, the tape action was limited as participants were anxious ahead of Trump’s formal announcement, where there was the risk of a ramp-up in the geopolitical risk premium, although once abated, the report only supported the move lower through till settlement.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: SPX +0.5% at 3253.06; NDX +0.75% at 8912.37, DJI +0.57% at 28745.47;</strong> SECTORS: IT +1.032%, communications +0.72%, telecoms +0.69%, health care +0.65%, financials +0.54%, materials +0.49%, consumer staples +0.45%, industrials +0.23%, consumer discretionary +0.15%, utilities +0.0%, energy -1.74%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> The energy sector (XLE, XES, CVX, XOM, COP) was the worst performer amid the fall in crude prices as geopolitical tensions eased. Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) continued its rally on the increased risk appetite. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) traded at the bottom of the Dow after a disappointing quarter, as well as expressing some headwinds from withdrawing out of tobacco. Boeing (BA) also trailed the Dow following a fatal 737-800 jet crash in Iran, shortly after take-off in what appears to be a technical fault (although the incident is reportedly being looked at by US intelligence). Conversely, United Health (UNH) topped the index, supported by a PT rise to USD 366 from USD 291, citing a strong longer-term outlook for its OptumHealth unit, as well as its core insurance unit. American Express (AXP) traded higher after the PBOC approved its license to start-up operations in China; competitor Visa (V) and other financials were also firmer. Vertex (VRTX) was a top performer after having its PT raised to USD 265 at both Oppenheimer and Citi, who are both optimistic about its Trikafta launch and the latter naming it a Top Pick. Lennar (LEN) was firmer on a strong quarterly report, supporting homebuilders in general (XHB). Liberty Global (LBTYA) took a haircut after Citi lowered its PT to USD 21 from USD 25, citing a sustained negative outlook.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLE TICKS 12+ LOWER AT 128-24+. </strong>Yields were higher across curve, with a very slight steepening bias, inspired by improving geopolitics in the Middle East, while on the data slate, ADP payrolls surprised to the upside. The US 10-year auction tailed by a chunky 1.6bps basis – the largest since August. However, analyst noted that this was likely a function of geopolitics, which saw 10-year yields drop to as low as 1.7050%, before rising back towards around 1.85% heading into the auction. The rest of the metrics fared better, with cover coming in at 2.45x, a touch above the previous and recent averages. In terms of the breakdown, dealers took down slightly more than recent averages, as did direct bidders, leaving indirects with a takedown below recent averages. SocGen thinks the 30-year sector appears slightly cheap in asset swap. The bank also notes that the current WI is trading below the last two auction stop-out rates, which could indicate relative richness, compared to those auctions. The December 30-year auction saw healthy demand, stopping through by a whopping 2.1bps, and ending the run of tails. SocGen also notes that 5s30s has steepened since the previous auction cycle, which might speak to the relative cheapness of the sector. The bank has a positive bias going into the auction.</p><p><strong>* BOE:</strong> Outgoing governor Carney told the FT that central banks would have less ammunition in the next downturn, although he does not believe that monetary policy is a spent force, citing rate cuts by the Fed and ECB in 2019, stating that we are now starting to see that stimulus flow to the global economy. Meanwhile, Carney also reiterated the somewhat fashionable line among central bankers, calling on fiscal authorities to do more to stimulate economies.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> EU Commission President von der Leyen stated there is not enough time for a full new partnership deal between Britain and the EU before year-end as the time frame is very tight; noting the EU wants zero tariffs, quotas and dumping. Von der Leyen said we will have to prioritise this year’s agenda, in the event the negotiating timeline is not extended, however, she would prefer to look at the whole situation prior to summer this year, as the time frame may then be reconsidered (NOTE: The deadline to extend the implementation period is the end of June). She did note talks regarding a future deal are not an all or nothing situation. Despite Von der Leyens’ issues with the time frame, UK PM Johnson is sticking to his guns and as he was clear that the UK will not extend the implementation period into 2021, adding any partnership with the EU must not include alignment or ECJ jurisdiction, plus the UK would maintain its immigration methods and fishing waters.</p><p><strong>* GERMAN FACTORY ORDERS (NOV):</strong> Orders missed expectations in November, at -1.3% M/M; the street had expected a rise of 0.2%. The Y/Y rate worsened to -6.5% from -5.6%. The previous data, however, saw a decent upward revision (+0.6ppts), which helps ease some of the gloom, though the numbers are still far from encouraging, analysts say. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that demand was constrained 3.1% M/M fall in export orders, offsetting the 1.6% rise in demand to the domestic economy. \"The weakness in foreign demand was split almost equally between falling orders to EZ and non-EZ economies. Across sectors, a sustained decline in new orders for capital goods were the main driver of weakness mid-way through Q4, offsetting stable data for intermediate and consumer goods.\" Pantheon suggests it is futile to build a story based on the extremely volatile monthly numbers, but the underlying trend tells its own sobering story: \"Growth in new orders decelerated sharply from almost +10% Y/Y at the end of 2017 to around -6.0% at the beginning of 2019, where it has more-or-less stayed since,\" and adds that \"the only positive story at the moment is that the surveys appear to have stabilised, now indicating that growth in new orders shouldn’t fall further, but they also point to little in the way of a rebound at the start of the year.\"</p><p><strong>* FX:</strong> USD continued its climb today and extended gains through the 97.00 handle in early trade, as participants began unwinding haven bids as geopolitical tensions eased An ADP payrolls beat also added to the upside. The strength in the greenback saw EURUSD continue to back-off 1.12, finding support just above the 1.11 handle. GBP was also weaker against the buck, but also amid warnings from the EU Commission President, who stated that a full trade deal by the end of the year might not be possible. Following Trump’s remarks, where he confirmed no military response would be taken for now, CAD lost further ground as oil prices continued to sell off, dragging USDCAD back above 1.30, topping out around 1.3040. Elsewhere risk sensitive currencies (AUD,NZD) caught a bid against on an improving risk backdrop; havens were offered, with USDJPY breaking 109 to the upside, with technicians now eyeing 109.50, followed by December’s high of 109.72. XAU initially breached 1600 to the upside overnight, but given the de-escalation, the yellow metal retraced back towards 1550 handle. Real yields continued to edge upwards, also adding to the pressure for gold. EMFX took its cues from the risk tone, and was stronger, with outperformance seen in TRY (a net oil importer) catching tailwinds from the falling oil prices, while RUB also an outperformer despite the country being a net oil exporter as the reduced geopolitical tensions seemingly outweigh the costs of lower oil prices for the nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

USDJPY and US equity futures continued to rise with both assets printing fresh session highs; cash markets hit an all-time high for the S&amp;P500, and USDJPY broke 109 to the upside. Given there is no current military response from the US, Iran will likely hold fire on any further attacks as they previously announced they would re-attack with a ‘crushing effect’ if the US were to respond. On the JCPOA, Trump called for allies to abandon the deal, noting world powers can work on a new deal.</li></ul>",

The US 10-year auction tailed by a chunky 1.6bps basis – the largest since August. However, analyst noted that this was likely a function of geopolitics, which saw 10-year yields drop to as low as 1.7050%, before rising back towards around 1.85% heading into the auction. The rest of the metrics fared better, with cover coming in at 2.45x, a touch above the previous and recent averages. In terms of the breakdown, dealers took down slight;ly more than recent averages, as did direct bidders, leaving indirects with a takedown below recent averages. SocGen thinks the 30-year sector appears slightly cheap in asset swap. The bank also notes that the current WI is trading below the last two auction stop-out rates, which could indicate relative richness, compared to those auctions. The December 30-year auction saw healthy demand, stopping through by a whopping 2.1bps, and ending the run of tails. SocGen also notes that 5s30s has steepened since the previous auction cycle, which might speaks to the relative cheapness of the sector. The bank has a positive bias going into the auction.</p>",

Elsewhere, the EIA weekly inventory report (bbls) showed crude stocks building 1.2mln, against expectations for a draw, whilst the products both built significantly more than expected (gasoline +9.1mln and distillates +5.3mln); although markedly bearish for an inventory report, the tape action was limited as participants were anxious ahead of Trump’s formal announcement, where there was the risk of a ramp-up in the geopolitical risk premium, although once abated, the report only supported the move lower through till settlement.</p>",

SocGen observes that the current 10 trades special in repo, which indicates strong demand for the issue, while the low dealer holdings in the 7-10 year sector might also be a positive. \"We expect fear of escalating geopolitical risks to put a cap on bond yields in the near term, thereby increasing demand among investors for safe assets like Treasuries,\" SocGen says, adding \"we are positive on this auction.\"&nbsp;</p><p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 1.842%, six-auction avg. 1.767%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -0.1bps, six-auction avg. 0.3bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.43x, six-auction avg. 2.40x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 24.5%, six-auction avg. 26.3%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 19.4%, six-auction avg. 13.9%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 56.1%, six-auction avg. 59.7%)</li></ul>",

Given there is no current military response from the US, Iran will likely hold fire on any further attacks as they previously announced they would re-attack with a ‘crushing effect’ if the US were to respond.

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>All eyes, or rather ears on US President Trump for his eagerly awaited statement on Iran from 16GMT to see if relatively sanguine tweets since the overnight missile attacks are truly indicative of his assessment, and the market perception that Iran’s riposte will not prompt a further escalation in hostilities. In the interim, Greenback recovery momentum remains intact amidst a broad rebound against its G10 currency adversaries, and even bigger reversals from post-Iraq strike lows vs safer havens. However, sentiment could easily swing again depending on what emanates from the White House shortly as the index holds just above 97.000 within a 97.239-96.796 band, and from a technical standpoint not far below near term chart resistance (97.350 almost aligning with the December 26 low at 97.344). For the record and fundamentally, a stellar ADP jobs survey ahead of Friday’s BLS report bodes well and is likely to be underpinning the Buck.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>The major underperformers and biggest victims of the aforementioned Dollar revival, aside from <strong>Gold</strong> as the prime safe asset and in stark contrast to the <strong>Swiss Franc</strong> that has pared losses vs the Greenback and rallied at the expense of the Euro. Eur/Usd only just evaded a test of 1.1100 and option expiries in the vicinity (1 bn from the round number up to 1.1105), while Usd/Jpy extended its sharp turnaround beyond 100 pips with a spike to circa 108.80 after reports via Kuwait that US troops were pulling out of Baghdad that were quickly dismissed due to hacking. However, the Xau/Usd volte face was even more pronounced and headline-grabbing given the break of 1600/oz and subsequent about turn to just under 1570.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD</strong></p><p>No watershed Wednesday, but a marginally better midweek session for the Aussie, Loonie and Kiwi, at least in terms of net losses relative to their US counterpart compared to yesterday. Nzd/Usd is holding in above 0.6600, though sub-0.6650 and Usd/Cad is still respecting the pre-1.3050 peak even though crude continues to hand back latest geopolitical premiums with additional downside after an EIA inventory build contrary to consensus and last night’s API draw. Meanwhile, Aud/Usd is hovering around 0.6850, with some assistance from a significantly stronger than expected resurgence in Australian building approvals, but still looking vulnerable in cross flows as Aud/Nzd seems intent to revisit lows ahead of 1.0300.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling has endured another roller-coaster ride across the board, due to order driven or indirect trade rather than anything obvious on the UK specific front, with more stops and fix positioning touted in Cable and Eur/Gbp between 1.3170-1.3080 and 0.8455-0.8515 respective parameters. However, breaking Brexit news after the imminent POTUS address could provide some independent impetus for the Pound as PM Johnson holds his first formal meeting with EC President von der Leyen.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>The overall improvement in risk sentiment has underpinned the Scandinavian Kronas and bulk of Ems, bar the Yuans pending confirmation that China’s Phase 1 deal with the US will be committed to paper this time next week.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: Missile attack by Iran leaves markets pondering Trump's next move",
        "content": "<p><strong>LATEST</strong>: Overnight, Iran launched over a dozen ballistic missiles at two Iraqi air bases – Al-Asad and Erbil - which houses US and coalition troops. There were no reported US casualties thus far and the situation is being assessed, but sources noted casualties among the Iraqis at the Al-Asad airbase following the attacks. The rockets fired near Erbil in Iraq have reportedly hit empty fields. Iranian state TV claimed that 80 Americans were killed in the Iranian attack on US targets in Iraq, adds that US helicopters and military equipment were severely damaged in the attack; however, this has not been confirmed by the US</p><p><strong>IRANIAN RESPONSE</strong>: Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp claimed responsibility for the attacks and warned allied countries of the US \"that if attacks are launched from bases in their countries on Iran, they will be a target of military retaliation.\". Iran also threatened \"more crushing attacks\", including further attacks to US bases should the US respond with fresh attacks. Furthermore, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif tweets \"We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression\".</p><p><strong>US RESPONSE</strong>: The US Pentagon noted that Iran launched over a dozen ballistic missiles against US military and coalition forces in Iraq and will take all necessary measures to protect US personnel and allies. Thereafter, US President Trump tweeted \"all is well\" whilst acknowledging the missile launches, adding that \"Assessment of casualties &amp; damages taking place now. So far, so good!\".</p><p><strong>MARKET RESPONSE</strong>: In an immediate reaction to the attacks, E-mini S&amp;P future fell from around 3225 to a low of 3181, USD/JPY fell to 107.66 from 108.35, spot gold rose from around USD 1578/oz to breach USD 1600/oz for the fist time since April 2013, printing a high just above USD 1610/oz. Brent front-month futures immediately spiked higher at the open from USD 68.50/bbl to USD 71.75/bbl. However, amid the lack of immediate retaliation from the US, a bulk of the moves above were eventually pared as markets await today’s statement from US President Trump (time TBC). For energy markets specifically, OPEC Sec Gen Barkindo was quite to downplay the impact of the attacks by noting that he expects no supply disruptions from Iraq with spare capacity running at around 3-3.5mln bpd. This followed on from comments via the UAE Energy Minster Mazrouei, that the oil market is sufficiently supplied to weather the storm.</p><p><strong>WHAT NEXT?</strong>: The next focus for traders will be on what response the attacks will evoke from the US. US President Trump is set to issue a statement today; no time for this has been announced yet (Trump is set to receive an intelligence briefing at 1915GMT). The response by the US could prove to be indicative of whether the current situation could evolve into a full-scale conflict, however, analysts at UBS believe that Trump will offer a ‘benign’ statement. Furthermore, the Swiss Bank notes that Iran’s Foreign Minister has stated the nation had ”concluded proportionate measures” and therefore, in the absence of a firm response by the US could signal that Iran is reluctant to escalate the situation and therefore introduce some cause for optimism. This would present a more favourable case for the market and likely reflects the current retracement of some of the knee-jerk moves seen overnight. Albeit, a complete resolution to the tensions between the two nations still appears to be some way off and hard to envisage at this stage.</p><p><strong>HOWEVER</strong>: If investors were to take a more hawkish view of the situation, it is worth considering other options the US and other actors could take. From a US perspective, America has a notable military presence in the Middle-East and Persian Gulf, with President Trump over the weekend warning that any retaliation by Iran could see the US launch attacks on 52 Iranian sites: a number which reflects the events in 1979 when 52 American diplomats and citizen were held hostage in Iran. The location of such sites is obviously an unknown (for strategic purposes), however, depending on the importance to Iran of these targets, this could trigger a full-scale conflict or cripple the Iranian economy and thereafter lead to greater global macro implications. Note, Capital Economics suggested last week that a collapse in “Iran’s economy could knock as much as 0.3%-pts off global GDP – equal to our estimate of the damage from the US-China trade war\". It is also worth noting that Iran themselves still have further options and could opt to carry out further missile attacks, even on US warships and US drones, whilst also launching cyber-attacks on US infrastructure and continuing to heighten violations of the nuclear deal. Furthermore, if the situation escalates, other nations will likely be brought into the conflict with Iraq’s involvement likely to increase as well as Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Israel potentially set to either be a basis for Iranian attacks or help facilitate US operations in the area. Note, it is also worth noting the risk of Russia and China being dragged into proceedings, however, for the purpose of this piece, our immediate focus will be on the statement from US President Trump.</p>",

Employers announced plans to cut 592,556 jobs from their payrolls in 2019, 10% higher than 2018. “Confidence was high heading into the last month of the year. With some resolutions occurring in the trade war and strong consumer spending in the fourth quarter, companies appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach as we head into 2020,” Challenger said.</li><li>The uptick seen in jobless claims data in December (in the payroll survey week, the four-week moving average was running at a clip of 225,750 in December vs 221,250 in November) can be explained away by seasonal factors due to the later Thanksgiving Holiday in 2019; the NFIB’s ‘jobs hard to fill’ index has also risen lately, suggesting tightening labour market conditions.</li><li>Within the Conference Board’s gauge of consumer confidence, the differential between jobs plentiful and hard to get and jobs rose to 33.9 in December from 32.1 – while still short of October’s 35.1, it does augur well for the jobless rate on Friday's report.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Nomura's quant desk estimates that CTAs are likely to have begun exiting S&amp;P 500 longs below 3,230; the next trigger line is 3,150 - if the S&amp;P 500 can avoid slipping beneath this line, it might make its way back up towards 3,230.</strong></p><ul><li>While the overnight fall in the emini looks like an overreaction, it is clear that the Iran situation has become a destabilising factor for global equity markets. Nomura says it is difficult to tell how the US-Iran conflict might unfold from here, but notes that most speculative players spent November and December accumulating longs in US equities, to the point that their potential for further buying looks close to used up.</li><li>There is also a well-known tendency for specs to book profits on long positions in US equities in January, and the Iran situation could act as a tailwind towards taking profits at this time of year for short-term players, and Nomura suggets that, given the extent to which specs had until recently been moving in lockstep in accumulating equity longs, the price impact of their exits from these positions could be fairly large.</li><li>Nomura's model suggests that discretionary investors (including long/short funds and global macro hedge funds) have already started cutting US equity net long exposure, and the bank notes risks that the paring of their exposure could turn into a complete pullout if the Iran situation deteriorates enough to damage fundamentals (global economic growth and corporate earnings), although this is not its base case view.</li><li>Meanwhile, trend-following CTAs look increasingly likely to be mechanistically drawn into liquidating their long futures positions. Nomura estimates that the average break-even for CTAs’ most recent purchases (net buying of futures since the beginning of December) stands at around 3,230. S&amp;P 500 futures have already moved beneath this level overnight, which Nomura says means that CTAs are likely to be forced into unwinding long positions.</li><li>\"We think the next trigger line on the way down is at around 3,150, and we therefore think that in order to put a stop to selling by CTAs, the S&amp;P 500 will need to avoid slipping below 3,150 and quickly make its way back up to around 3,230.\"</li><li>Nomura's quants also note that one of the most prominent actions by CTAs since the start of the year has been a resurgence in net buying on the major bond future markets. And while there is an argument that the stock sell-off this year has halted the rise of bond yields, and added positive momentum in the bond futures market, setting the stage for CTA's to systematically buy bond futures, Nomura argues that CTAs were already primed to swing back to buying bond futures, as their aggregate net positions in most major markets had already turned market-neutral. \"Regardless, we think CTAs are still not that deep in bond future longs, and the sustainability of this trend warrants close monitoring,\" the bank writes. &nbsp;</li></ul>",

The DXY has reclaimed 97.000+ status and eclipsed yesterday’s high even though US Treasuries retain an underlying bid and the curve is marginally flatter awaiting the official US response after a full inspection of the bases hit in Iraq, and ahead of the next pre-NFP proxy for Friday in the form of ADP, assuming attention returns to fundamentals at some point.</p><p><strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The G10 laggard after yet another shallower rebound vs the Greenback and what looks like a fix-related run against the Pound that tripped stops in the cross through 0.8465, but stopped short of testing 0.8450 or last week’s low. The single currency now appears vulnerable to Eur/Usd sell orders said to be residing near/on Tuesday’s circa 1.1125 low that could then expose decent option expiry interest at 1.1120 and even between 1.1100-05 (in 1 bn and 1.2 bn respectively).</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY/XAU</strong></p><p>Very volatile trade given the aforementioned risk-off flows followed by a sharp/abrupt unwind of safe-haven premiums, as the Franc reverses from around 0.9665 back below 0.9700, Yen rotates more than a full big figure either side of 108.00 where there is a 1 bn expiry and Gold slides to circa Usd1573/oz compared to over Usd1610 at one stage.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Buck, or holding up better amidst its revival, as the Kiwi keeps tabs on 0.6650, Aussie holds off fresh 0.6850 lows, with the aid of some welcome better news on the data front via building approvals, Sterling maintains 1.3100+ status and Loonie pares some of its losses around the 1.3000 handle. However, price action remains choppy/fluid across the board, and the Pound may be prone to more Brexit headlines in wake of UK PM Johnson’s date with new EC President von der Leyen to discuss the post-January 31 transition period and Britain’s relationship with the EU thereafter.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Some Norges Bank and Riksbank diversions for the Scandi Crowns to ponder, but not a lot new in comments from Governor Olsen or the December policy meeting minutes in truth. Hence, Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek are both largely tracking wider developments and the much improved risk tone, with the former lagging as crude prices come off the boil.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Most regional currencies are benefiting from the considerably calmer mood, bar those with close commodity links that are underperforming/hampered by the retreat in oil, bullion etc.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: Missile attack by Iran leaves markets pondering Trump's next move ",
        "content": "<p><strong>LATEST</strong>: Overnight, Iran launched over a dozen ballistic missiles at two Iraqi air bases – Al-Asad and Erbil - which houses US and coalition troops. There were no reported US casualties thus far and the situation is being assessed, but sources noted casualties among the Iraqis at the Al-Asad airbase following the attacks. The rockets fired near Erbil in Iraq have reportedly hit empty fields. Iranian state TV claimed that 80 Americans were killed in the Iranian attack on US targets in Iraq, adds that US helicopters and military equipment were severely damaged in the attack; however, this has not been confirmed by the US</p><p><strong>IRANIAN RESPONSE</strong>: Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp claimed responsibility for the attacks and warned allied countries of the US \"that if attacks are launched from bases in their countries on Iran, they will be a target of military retaliation.\". Iran also threatened \"more crushing attacks\", including further attacks to US bases should the US respond with fresh attacks. Furthermore, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif tweets \"We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression\".</p><p><strong>US RESPONSE</strong>: The US Pentagon noted that Iran launched over a dozen ballistic missiles against US military and coalition forces in Iraq and will take all necessary measures to protect US personnel and allies. Thereafter, US President Trump tweeted \"all is well\" whilst acknowledging the missile launches, adding that \"Assessment of casualties &amp; damages taking place now. So far, so good!\".</p><p><strong>MARKET RESPONSE</strong>: In an immediate reaction to the attacks, E-mini S&amp;P future fell from around 3225 to a low of 3181, USD/JPY fell to 107.66 from 108.35, spot gold rose from around USD 1578/oz to breach USD 1600/oz for the fist time since April 2013, printing a high just above USD 1610/oz. Brent front-month futures immediately spiked higher at the open from USD 68.50/bbl to USD 71.75/bbl. However, amid the lack of immediate retaliation from the US, a bulk of the moves above were eventually pared as markets await today’s statement from US President Trump (time TBC). For energy markets specifically, OPEC Sec Gen Barkindo was quite to downplay the impact of the attacks by noting that he expects no supply disruptions from Iraq with spare capacity running at around 3-3.5mln bpd. This followed on from comments via the UAE Energy Minster Mazrouei, that the oil market is sufficiently supplied to weather the storm.</p><p><strong>WHAT NEXT?</strong>: The next focus for traders will be on what response the attacks will evoke from the US. US President Trump is set to issue a statement today; no time for this has been announced yet (Trump is set to receive an intelligence briefing at 1915GMT). The response by the US could prove to be indicative of whether the current situation could evolve into a full-scale conflict, however, analysts at UBS believe that Trump will offer a ‘benign’ statement. Furthermore, the Swiss Bank notes that Iran’s Foreign Minister has stated the nation had ”concluded proportionate measures” and therefore, in the absence of a firm response by the US could signal that Iran is reluctant to escalate the situation and therefore introduce some cause for optimism. This would present a more favourable case for the market and likely reflects the current retracement of some of the knee-jerk moves seen overnight. Albeit, a complete resolution to the tensions between the two nations still appears to be some way off and hard to envisage at this stage.</p><p><strong>HOWEVER</strong>: If investors were to take a more hawkish view of the situation, it is worth considering other options the US and other actors could take. From a US perspective, America has a notable military presence in the Middle-East and Persian Gulf, with President Trump over the weekend warning that any retaliation by Iran could see the US launch attacks on 52 Iranian sites: a number which reflects the events in 1979 when 52 American diplomats and citizen were held hostage in Iran. The location of such sites is obviously an unknown (for strategic purposes), however, depending on the importance to Iran of these targets, this could trigger a full-scale conflict or cripple the Iranian economy and thereafter lead to greater global macro implications. Note, Capital Economics suggested last week that a collapse in “Iran’s economy could knock as much as 0.3%-pts off global GDP – equal to our estimate of the damage from the US-China trade war\". It is also worth noting that Iran themselves still have further options and could opt to carry out further missile attacks, even on US warships and US drones, whilst also launching cyber-attacks on US infrastructure and continuing to heighten violations of the nuclear deal. Furthermore, if the situation escalates, other nations will likely be brought into the conflict with Iraq’s involvement likely to increase as well as Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Israel potentially set to either be a basis for Iranian attacks or help facilitate US operations in the area. Note, it is also worth noting the risk of Russia and China being dragged into proceedings, however, for the purpose of this piece, our immediate focus will be on the statement from US President Trump.</p>",

However, it was also pointed out that more analysis is needed of the potential effects if negative interest rates are perceived as more permanent</li><li>Ingves: The repo-rate path is our best forecast at present, illustrating that monetary policy is in a kind of “wait-and-see” situation. The future is, as always, uncertain. Economic activity could turn out to be better and Swedish inflation could increase faster than is assumed in our forecasts. In such a scenario I am in no hurry to raise the repo rate.</li><li>Breman: I would prefer a repo-rate path that indicates an increase during the first half of 2020, on condition that economic activity has stabilised then, and that the repo-rate path then indicates around one rise per year in 2021 and 2022</li><li>Jansson: would be against increasing the repo rate at today’s meeting even if we had revised up our inflation forecast, perhaps so that it had even overshot the inflation target for a while</li><li>Floden: If inflation should prove to be weaker than in our forecast, it may be necessary to make monetary policy more expansionary, for instance, by cutting the repo rate back to –0.25 per cent</li></ul>",

There were no reported US casualties thus far and the situation is being assessed, but sources noted of casualties among the Iraqis at the Al-Asad airbase following the attacks.</strong> <strong>CNN sources note that there have been no US casualties following the Iranian attack on Iraqi airbases but are awaiting official confirmation.</strong> The rockets fired near Erbil in Iraq have reportedly hit empty fields and there has been no attack on US consulate, according to a security official cited by NPR International Correspondent (Twitter/Newswires/CNN) <strong>US Pentagon noted that Iran launched over a dozen ballistic missiles against US military and coalition forces in Iraq, and it is clear that the missiles were launched from Iran</strong> <strong>- Pentagon will take all necessary measures to protect US personnel and allies.</strong> (Newswires) <strong>Iranian state TV claimed that 80 Americans were killed in the Iranian attack on US targets in Iraq, adds that US helicopters and military equipment were severely damaged in the attack; however, this has not been confirmed by the US</strong>. *<i><strong>N.B.1</strong>: There were also reports of a third strike at Camp Taji which was reportedly hit by around five rockets, albeit these reports were later dismissed. - <strong>*N.B. 2</strong>. There <strong>were unconfirmed reports</strong> via Al-Mayadeen that IRGC is claiming that \"30 American soldiers\" were wounded in missile attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq.</i></p><p><strong>Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp claimed the attacks </strong>and said it has fired \"tens of missiles\" at Al-Assad airbase in Iraq, via state media. (Newswires) In a statement, IRGC warned allied countries of the US \"that if attacks are launched from bases in their countries on Iran, they will be a target of military retaliation.\", via NYT's Fassihi. <strong>Iran also threatened \"more crushing attacks\", including further attacks to US bases should the US respond with fresh attacks, according to state TV cited by AFP.

(Newswires) Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman says the WH will not release any further written statement tonight about the Iranian missile attack, via Al-Jazeera.

Boeing said they are aware media reports regarding the plane crash in Iran and more information is being gathered. All passengers on board have been killed, according to Iranian state TV. <i>Note: There has been nothing to indicate that this has anything to do with the US-Iran tensions and is purely a technical issue. Boeing has an 8% weighting in the DJIA.</i></p><p>ASIA-PAC</p><p><strong>Asian equity markets traded lower across the board, albeit well off lows</strong> - as sentiment took a hit after Iranian forces carried out multiple attacks on Iraqi bases housing US personnel and allies, as part of the IRGC’s operation to avenge its commander’s assassination. <strong>Nikkei 225 (-1.6%)</strong> initially plumbed the depths and underperformed amid headwinds from a geopolitically bid JPY and with the index briefly dipping below the 23k level as almost all its stocks traded in the red. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.3%)</strong> fared better as downside was cushioned by the large-cap miners and energy names benefitting from price action in the respective complexes. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.9%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp (-0.9%) </strong>conformed to the risk aversion, with losses in the mainland initially mitigated to an extent by the anticipated US-Sino Phase One trade deal signing next week. Finally<strong>, KOSPI (-0.8%)</strong> failed to glean support Samsung Electronics’ (+2.3%) prelim earnings – which flagged a smaller-than-forecast fall in quarterly operating profits, with some analysts noting it indicates that memory chip prices have bottomed out quicker than anticipated. <strong>APAC bourses climbed off lows after reports that US President Trump will not be addressing the nation – seen as a positive at the time as it indicates the US may not immediately retaliate. Furthermore, sentiment showed a slightly more pronounced turnaround after President Trump acknowledged the missile attack and noted that “all is well”.</strong></p><p>\"There are still many things that could go wrong,” warns China's Global Times on the 15th January Phase One deal signing.

(FT)</p><p><strong>FX FX markets have been choppy and have largely reversed the earlier Iran-induced moves</strong> on the back of US President Trump seemingly holding off on an instant retaliation to the latest attack. Upon the reports of the strikes - <strong>DXY</strong> moved lower to test 96.80 to the downside from levels closer to 97.00 whilst <strong>USD/JPY</strong> gave up the 108.00 handle to a low of 107.65, as investors flocked to the safe-haven asset. The risk aversion also prompted downside in the Antipodeans which saw <strong>AUD/USD</strong> test 0.6850 to the downside whilst <strong>NZD/USD</strong> also experienced losses. The <strong>price action then changed course</strong> after reports noted that President Trump will not be addressing the nation regarding the Iranian strikes, which dwindled the prospects of an immediate retaliation and thus further escalation for now. <strong>USD/JPY</strong> moved back north of its 100 DMA at 108.20 and close to pre-strike levels whilst <strong>antipodeans</strong> rose to session highs. Elsewhere, <strong>EUR/USD</strong> and <strong>GBP/USD</strong> remained choppy with the former contained within tight overnight ranges, before coming under mild pressure in late APAC trade. Note: the pair sees EUR 1.0bln in options expiring at strike 1.1120 for today’s NY cut. Meanwhile, <strong>Cable</strong> posted cautious gains throughout the session ahead of UK PM Johnson’s meeting with European Commission President von der Leyen.</p><p>Australian Building Approvals (Nov) 11.8% vs. Exp. 2.0% (Prev. -8.1%) (Newswires) Australian Private House Approvals (Nov) 6.1% (Prev. -7.0%, Rev. -6.0%)&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Commodities were wholly driven by overnight geopolitical developments in the Middle East</strong>. <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures initially rose in excess of 4% after Iranian forces struck the Iraqi bases which held US troops. Brent front-month futures at the open immediately spoked higher from USD 68.50/bbl to USD 71.75/bbl on the notion that escalating tensions in the region would disrupt the global oil market. Prices then pared back almost all its overnight gains as the US President Trump did not immediately retaliate. <strong>Brent</strong> Mar’20 futures stabilised above USD 69/bbl having found a base at the round figure whilst <strong>WTI</strong> Feb’20 futures steadied around USD 63.50/bbl (vs. a high of USD 65.65/bbl). Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> was bolstered by the IRGC retaliatory attacks which drove the yellow metal briefly above USD 1600/oz for the first time since April 2013 to a high of USD 1610/oz. Prices then waned off highs and back below the psychological figure amid an improvement in risk sentiment. Precious metals have generally remained bid throughout the session - with <strong>spot</strong> <strong>palladium</strong> rising to fresh record highs of around USD 2060/oz. In terms of base metals, <strong>copper</strong> was relatively resilient to the sentiment emanating from geopolitical news amid tight supply concerns. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> futures rose almost 3% on hopes of firm restocking demand from steel mills heading into local holidays.</p><p><strong>Iranian VLCC super tanker STREAM has now come back online on the AIS grid for the first time since July 2019.

The recent geopolitical induced risk-off move has taken a bit of a breather, with both Treasuries and oil prices coming off their recent highs. Some participants are likely cautious ahead of the supply slate this week, with new year’s corporate issuance ramping up alongside the Treasury auctions. One analyst notes that steepeners are likely being entered ahead of the 10- and 30-year auctions in the next few days, indicative of a concession effort ahead of Friday’s NFP report to “seamlessly underwrite the auctions.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets trade lower across the board, albeit well off lows - as sentiment took a hit after Iranian forces carried out multiple attacks on Iraqi bases housing US personnel and allies, as part of the IRGC’s operation to avenge its commander’s assassination. Nikkei 225 (-1.2%) plumbed the depths and underperformed amid headwinds from a geopolitically bid JPY and with almost all its stocks trading in the red. ASX 200 (-0.2%) initially accelerated losses since the open but downside was cushioned by the large-cap miners and energy names benefitting from price action in the respective complexes. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp (-0.4%) conformed to the risk aversion, with losses in the mainland mitigated to an extent by the anticipated US-Sino Phase One trade deal signing next week. Finally, KOSPI (-1.1%) failed to glean support Samsung Electronics’ (+1.4%) prelim earnings – which flagged a smaller-than-forecast fall in quarterly operating profits, with some analysts noting it indicates that memory chip prices have bottomed out quicker than anticipated. Note: APAC bourses climbed off lows after reports that US President Trump will not be addressing the nation – seen as a positive at the time as it indicates the US may not immediately retaliate. Furthermore, sentiment showed a slightly more pronounced turnaround after President Trump acknowledged the missile attack and noted that “all is well”.</p><p>FX Markets have been choppy and have largely reversed the earlier Iran-induced moves on the back of US President Trump seemingly holding off on an instant retaliation to the latest attack. Upon the reports of the strikes - DXY gapped lower to test 96.80 to the downside from levels closer to 97.00 whilst USD/JPY gave up the 108.00 handle to a low of 107.65, as investors flocked to the safe-haven asset. The risk aversion also prompted downside in the Antipodeans which saw AUD/USD test 0.6850 to the downside whilst NZD/USD also experienced losses. The price action changed course after reports noted that President Trump will not be addressing the nation regarding the Iranian strikes, which dwindled the prospect of an immediate retaliation and thus further escalation for now. USD/JPY moved back north of its 100 DMA at 108.20 and close to pre-strike levels whilst antipodeans rose to session highs. Elsewhere, EUR/USD and GBP/USD remained choppy with the former contained within tight overnight ranges, although the pair sees EUR 1.0bln in options expiring at strike 1.1120 for today’s NY cut. Meanwhile, Cable posted cautious gains ahead of UK PM Johnson’s meeting with European Commission President von der Leyen - in which the PM is expected to stress the importance of agreeing to a \"confident and positive future relationship by the end of December 2020\".</p>",
