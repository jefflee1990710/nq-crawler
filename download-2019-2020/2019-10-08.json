Dow heavyweight Boeing (BA) traded in the red after reports that friction between EU and US regulators could delay the return of the infamous 737 MAX jet even further. However, the majority of losses were reversed as the EU safety agency said it does not at this time have specific concerns resulting from the 737 MAX software assessment that would mean it could hold back its return to service; prior to the announcement Boeing’s net orders were released, which showed one mystery buyer of its infamous jet; total net orders however, including cancellations, were -84 for Jan-Sept, hit by India’s Jet airway’s bankruptcy, which resulted in BA cancelling 210 orders from its backlog.

Ambarella (AMBA) were heavily hit as Hikvision, a large customer of AMBA, were added to an entity list from the US for the treatment of the Muslim Uighur community. Tesla competitor NIO (NIO) delivered 4799 vehicles in Q3, a 35.1% Q/Q increase. Dominos (DPZ) earnings missed both top and bottom line however initial losses were clawed back, even amid a market rout, to eventually close positive following positive comments from its earnings call, as it sticks to its aggressive growth plans, as the CEO noted they have a unique opportunity to solidify market share gains for the long term. On the food delivery service, CEO stated they believe that a significant shakeout is coming, as the delivery charges competitors such as GrubHub (GRUB) much lower prices than what it costs, thanks to subsidies from investors.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 6 TICKS HIGHER AT 131.22+</strong>: The TPLEX was pretty much unchanged going into remarks by Fed Chair Powell, and then steepened in wake of his comments, where he said that the Fed soon announce measures to add to reserves supply over time, and that the time was now upon us to expand balance sheet in order to maintain an appropriate level of reserves, warning that such moves should not be framed as ‘QE’. In wake of Powell’s comments, the implied probability of a 25bps rate cut rose to around 80% from around 75% at the close of business on Monday.&nbsp; The US Treasury kicked-off the week’s Treasury supply with a lacklustre sale of 3s, which tailed by 0.4bps, while cover came in below recent averages; the paper was sold at the lowest 3s auction yield since November 2016.

Auctions: US 10-year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>Markets continued their sell off on Tuesday as tensions between US &amp; China intensified - the US sanctioned entities in relation to the detained Uighurs last night and earlier source reports stated the China delegation is to leave a day early, adding to the risk off feel. Selling continued in the tail end of the session as the US announced it is to impose visa bans against unnamed individuals related to the Uighur community. The yield curve saw bull steepening as Fed Chair Powell said “time is now upon us to expand the balance sheet to maintain appropriate level of reserves”, in addition to Fed’s Evans voicing the need for a further rate cut, although other risk assets were little changed as trade themes dominated the narrative. Elsewhere, Brexit uncertainties continue to weaken the pound; EIA cut its oil demand outlook again; Kurds look to US foes for support against a Turkey military operation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FED CHAIR POWELL: </strong>Fed Chair Powell announced the Fed will soon announce measures to add reserve supply over time, adding time is now upon us to expand the balance sheet to maintain an appropriate level of reserves. Powell noted the purchases of T-bills will not materially effect the Fed’s monetary policy stance as it is to address recent technical issues, Powell also added it is not to be confused with QE. On the economy, he said that the jobs and inflation picture is favourable, he sees a continued economic expansion and there was no reason why it could not continue; he also sees a strong labour market and inflation near the 2% goal as the most likely outlook. He judged that vulnerability in the financial system are moderate overall, and that households were in good shape. Powell reiterated global developments pose risks to a positive outlook in the US. The Fed chair also noted that the policy actions were providing support to the outlook, reiterating policy is never on a pre-set course, and it will change as appropriate, taking meetings one-by-one. Powell maintained the Fed’s language on the outlook that it will act ‘as appropriate’ to support growth, a strong job market and for inflation to return to its 2% goal.</p><p><strong>* CHINA TRADE: </strong>The US added a further eight Chinese tech companies to its trade blacklist, with the Commerce Department saying that the \"entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.\" Ahead of high-level trade talks this week (which will be attended by China's Vice Premier Liu He and PBoC Governor Yi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin as well as USTR Lighthizer) US officials said the action was not linked to these negotiations. A China MOFCOM official said \"stay tuned\" for Beijing's retaliation. In the tail-end of the session, the US imposed Visa bans on Chinese linked to the mass detention of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang province. Before the US open, it was reported that Chinese officials were toning down expectations, with a source stating the delegation is already planning to cut short its stay by one night, SCMP reported. Additionally, Trump reportedly also expressed hope that China find a resolution to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong, warning that the situation had the potential to hurt trade talks; the remark will likely anger China, which has demanded other nations remain out of its domestic affairs. There is some speculation that the two developments may be a response to a weekend story that China was seeking to 'narrow' the scope of trade talks as it saw US President Trump's domestic woes as strengthening its hand in negotiations; the US has been insisting that small, piecemeal trade deals may not cut it. Nevertheless, the stories here highlights the difficulties the two teams will face in trying to strike a trade deal, and as such, expectations remain low, as evidenced by commentary in China's People's Daily, which stated talks could deliver a fair deal, fall apart or even maintain the current state of 'talking while retaliating.' Additionally, it is worth keeping in mind that, in one week, the US is set to boost tariffs on USD 25bln of Chinese imports (originally slated for 1st October but delayed at Beijing's request) from 25% to 30%.</p><p><strong>* FED MINUTES PREVIEW: </strong>FOMC September Meeting Minutes will be released on 9th October 2019 at 1900 BST/1400 EDT. Focus will be on clues into conditions for further rate cuts as well as any talk around a permanent standing repo facility. The minutes come ahead of key trade talks between the US and China which are likely to set sentiment. To download the report, please click <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22949/download\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> <strong>Fed's Rosengren</strong> (voter, hawkish dissenter) said incoming data had come in a little weaker than he had anticipated a few weeks ago. Rosengren said the Fed sees the labour market still tight, and there was nothing to indicate that consumer fundamentals have changed. Elsewhere, he warned on some asset prices, stating that he was concerned about co-working environments on the commercial real estate market. <strong>Fed’s Evans</strong> (Voter, Dove) said he would not mind another rate cut, downside risks to the economy were stronger than the upside risks; he believes the consumer is benefiting from a strong labour market. Looking ahead, Evans sees 2% growth in 2020, and said he was still optimistic on the US outlook, adding the economy is good' he did, however, opine that last week's manufacturing report was not a good sign.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Reports indicate that German Chancellor Merkel told PM Johnson this morning that there can only be a Brexit deal if Northern Ireland remains in the customs union. A UK source noted that the discussion was a ‘clarifying moment’ in discussions and if this represents a new established position from Europe that a deal is essentially impossible at any point, not just now. These comments did lead to some significant broad-based Sterling depreciation, which boosted the FTSE 100 briefly, and caused Gilts to firm up. However, it’s worth clarifying that there has been some speculation as to whether these comments were from Chancellor Merkel herself, as they are notably different from the peace-maker stance she tends to take in EU-UK conflict. Subsequently, a German spokesman did confirm the call occurred though they will not elaborate on the details. The remainder of the sessions Brexit news flow has largely just been noise as we approach the Friday deadline for Johnson to potentially submit any revisions and, of course, next week’s EU summit. Later in the session, European Parliament President Sassoli said that UK PM Johnson had told him that he would not request a Brexit extension from the EU.</p><p><strong>* IBD/TIPP ECONOMIC OPTIMISM:</strong> The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose 3.5% to 52.6 in October, reversing two months of decline. The index now remains above 50.0 for a record 37 consecutive months. The Six-Month Economic Outlook increased by 1.2%. However, the component remains in negative territory with a reading of 43.5, up from 43.0 last month, which was the lowest reading in three years. The Personal Financial Outlook rose by 2.4% in October, after dropping by 5.4% in September; it yielded a reading of 60.6 this month, compared to 59.2 last month. Confidence in Federal Economic Policies, a proprietary IBD/TIPP measure of views on how government economic policies are working, reversed a two-month slide in October, moving from 50.3 last month to 53.6-- a 6.6% increase. \"Consumer sentiment continues to be strong despite the trade war with China and the stock market under pressure,\" the report stated, \"the job market continues to be good, with the unemployment rate falling to a 50-year low.\" The report also noted that nearly half of respondents think that the economy is improving, and a similar share gives high marks to the President for his handling of the economy -- a factor behind the increase in Trump’s Job Approval rating from 39% in September to 43% this month, despite the impeachment talk.</p><p><strong>* US PPI: </strong>Printed -0.3% M/M in September, a downside surprise from the expected +0.1% (also the previous), bringing the Y/Y down to +1.4% from the prior +1.8%. The core M/M also disappointed – printing -0.3% against the expected +0.2%. Pantheon Macroeconomics note that the 1% plunge in the trade services component (a measure of wholesale and retail profit margins) half explains the weakness in the core, whilst the data also shows falls in both margins of capital and consumer goods. Looking historically the consultancy says on a Y/Y basis capital goods margins are little changed, likely a result of China tariffs, whilst consumer goods margins have gained 3.5%. PM caveats by noting the volatile nature of the data and a rebound in October is a “decent bet” and overall PPI inflation remains under control.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 6 TICKS HIGHER AT 131.22+: </strong>The TPLEX was pretty much unchanged going into remarks by Fed Chair Powell, and then steepened in wake of his comments, where he said that the Fed soon announce measures to add to reserves supply over time, and that the time was now upon us to expand balance sheet in order to maintain an appropriate level of reserves, warning that such moves should not be framed as ‘QE’. In wake of Powell’s comments, the implied probability of a 25bps rate cut rose to around 80% from around 75% at the close of business on Monday.&nbsp; The US Treasury kicked-off the week’s Treasury supply with a lacklustre sale of 3s, which tailed by 0.4bps, while cover came in below recent averages; the paper was sold at the lowest 3s auction yield since November 2016. There was little impact on the curve after the auction.</p><p><strong>* US 10-YEAR NOTE PREVIEW: </strong>The Treasury will this week auction a new 3-year note (USD 38bln, Tue), a 10-year re-opening (USD 24bln, Wed), and a 30-year bond re-opening (USD 16bln, Thu). Excluding SOMA holdings, there will be around USD 26bln of cash flows this week (around USD 24bln of redemptions, and USD 2bln of coupons). Societe Generale's analysts say the 10-year sector has been set-up for auction from a relative value perspective, and argues that the current 10 trades fair in asset swap compared to previous 10-year auction cycles, though is cheap on the curve versus 5s and 30s. SocGen thinks that on an outright basis the 10-year part of the curve appears rich, with the current WI trading beneath all stop-out rates since August 2016. The bank also notes that the bull-steepening of the 2s10s part of the curve since the last auction cycles signals that, although the sector has cheapened on a relative value basis, it is expensive outright. Additionally, dealer holdings in the 7-11-year bucket is high, suggesting that the success of the auction will hinge on the participation of investment funds and foreigners. Finally, the bank says it holds a negative bias into this auction, though says that the fact that 10s trades special in repo might support demand.</p><p><strong>* EIA STEO: </strong>Cut 2019 2019 world oil demand growth forecasts by 50k BPD to an 840k BPD Y/Y increase, and cut its 2020 forecast by 100k BPD and to a 1.3mln BPD Y/Y increase. Whilst US crude output is to rise 1.27mln BPD to 12.26mln BPD in 2019 (prev. +1.25mln BPD), to rise 910k BPD to 13.17mln BPD in 2020 (prev. a smaller rise to 13.23mln BPD). Forecasts Brent averaging USD 59/bbl in Q4 19, falling to USD 57/bbl Q2 20, before rising to more than USD 62/bbl in H2 20 as oil market balances firm; sees Brent averaging USD 60/bbl in 2020 (prev. USD 62/bbl), notably due to contractionary manufacturing indicators from the US and Germany and higher inventory builds in 2020.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 0.12 LOWER AT USD 52.63/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.11 LOWER AT USD 58.24/BBL: </strong>Mounting pessimistic sentiment ahead of the US-China trade talks this week saw oil benchmarks follow risk lower. Growing consensus that the scope of a trade outcome is to be limited this week is sequentially weighing on the crude complex as participants revaluate global demand. The wildcard in the energy markets that is Iranian conflict remains just as much a downside risk as much as an upside one, where any form of agreement between Tehran and Washington is likely to knock out some of the geopolitical risk premium currently supporting the crude complex from taking further losses. The API reports its US energy inventories ahead of the official EIA release on Wednesday – current expectations see crude stocks +1.4mln bbls, distillates -2.1mln bbls and gasoline -0.3mln bbls, whilst Genscape sees Cushing stocks +0.348mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* SYRIA/TURKEY: </strong>Kurdish officials are now reportedly reaching out for help to Syria’s Assad and the Russians, following US President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the region, putting Kurdish forces at risk of further attacks from Turkey (who has said all preparations are completed for a military operation). Trump has received strong backlash to the moves both abroad and domestically – on both sides of the isle – where concerns lie in the benefit the situation provides to Russia, Iran and the Assad regime.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 -1.6% at 2893, NASDAQ-100 -1.6% at 7604, Dow Jones -1.2% at 26164,</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -1.1%, Consumer Staples -0.9%, Energy -1.8%, Financials -2%, Health Care -1.8%, Industrials -1.6%, Information Technology -1.8%, Materials -1.7%, Telecommunication Services -1.3%, Utilities -1%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Apple (AAPL) had a number of factors driving the stock today; it approved an app which tracks HK protest activities, unlikely to go down well with China. DigiTimes, meanwhile, reported AAPL could outpace its Chinese competitor Huawei in Q4 smartphone shipments. However, headline risks from US-Sino trade talks are also a lingering factor for the iPhone maker. Dow heavyweight Boeing (BA) traded in the red after reports that friction between EU and US regulators could delay the return of the infamous 737 MAX jet even further. However, the majority of losses were reversed as the EU safety agency said it does not at this time have specific concerns resulting from the 737 MAX software assessment that would mean it could hold back its return to service; prior to the announcement Boeing’s net orders were released, which showed one mystery buyer of its infamous jet; total net orders however, including cancellations, were -84 for Jan-Sept, hit by India’s Jet airway’s bankruptcy, which resulted in BA cancelling 210 orders from its backlog. Microsoft (MSFT) was one of the DJ’s outperformers following an upgrade at Jefferies. Facebook (FB) now reportedly has 40 US AG’s now probing the name as they want the anticompetitive accusations investigated. General Motors (GM) reportedly submitted a new contract proposal to UAW on Monday morning, with GM still awaiting the response on Monday evening, according to people familiar with the matter. Also, the total number of furloughed workers from the UAW strike has reached nearly 60,000. Despite the strikes however, its plants in Canada and Mexico are still operating. Chinese ADR’s (BABA, BIDU, JD) were hit as it was that the WH is considering limiting the Chinese stock holdings in government pension funds. Ambarella (AMBA) were heavily hit as Hikvision, a large customer of AMBA, were added to an entity list from the US for the treatment of the Muslim Uighur community. Tesla competitor NIO (NIO) delivered 4799 vehicles in Q3, a 35.1% Q/Q increase. Dominos (DPZ) earnings missed both top and bottom line however initial losses were clawed back, even amid a market rout, to eventually close positive following positive comments from its earnings call, as it sticks to its aggressive growth plans, as the CEO noted they have a unique opportunity to solidify market share gains for the long term. On the food delivery service, CEO stated they believe that a significant shakeout is coming, as the delivery charges competitors such as GrubHub (GRUB) much lower prices than what it costs, thanks to subsidies from investors.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong>: <strong>DXY</strong> is higher heading into the Asia session, having started out on the backfoot seeing lows beneath 98.90, however the index reclaimed the 99.0 handle as risk appetite soured, with direction little changed as Powell generally stuck to the script.</p><p><strong>Havens:</strong> JPY, CHF and XAU all bid today as US/China trade tensions came to the fore ahead of high-level trade talks; USDJPY remaining above the 107-handle heading into Asia trade. XAU reclaimed the 1500 handle, while CHF also bid.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Brexit headline risk weighs on GBP, pushing it sub-1.22 at one point, uncertainties continue as the deadline fast approaches. Initial reports suggested that German Chancellor Merkel said that unless Northern Ireland stays in the customs union, a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely and essentially impossible. However, these comments were never confirmed, and the German government refused to comment on them, nonetheless GBP remained on the back food today with Cable trading between 1.22 and 1.23 parameters, with the cross heavily supported at 1.22 with bids cited between 1.2295-1.22; <strong>EURGBP</strong> found resistance within a whisker of 0.90.</p><p><strong>Antipodes:</strong> <strong>AUD</strong> and <strong>NZD </strong>headed into Asia trade relatively flat despite trading higher throughout the European session, NZD was boosted by data showing a surprise NZD 4bln budget surplus, above expectations. However, the overhanging US China trade tensions saw both AUD and NZD gains pare back.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> <strong>BRL</strong> outperformed as Brazil’s economy minister Guedes denied reports from yesterday that he is to step down from his role in February; also, of note, Brazil senate will hold the second vote on the pension reform on Oct. 22nd. <strong>TRY </strong>headed into the Asia session flat, although US President Trump did seem to step back from his aggressive approach yesterday, as he called them a big trading partner, good to deal with and have helped Trump save lives; Trump and Erdogan are to meet on November 13th in the US.</p>",

The wildcard in the energy markets that is Iranian conflict remains just as much a downside risk as much as an upside one, where any form of agreement between Tehran and Washington is likely to knock out some of the geopolitical risk premium currently supporting the crude complex from taking further losses.

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY: </strong>The Treasury will this week auction a new 3-year note (USD 38bln, Tue), a 10-year re-opening (USD 24bln, Wed), and a 30-year bond re-opening (USD 16bln, Thu). Excluding SOMA holdings, there will be around USD 26bln of cash flows this week (around USD 24bln of redemptions, and USD 2bln of coupons).</p><p><strong>3-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The complex lacks setup ahead of the auction from a relative value perspective, Societe Generale says, and trades rich in asset swap, and on the curve versus 2s and 5s. The bank thinks the sector appears expensive on an outright basis, with the current when-issued trading below all auction stop out rates since November 2016. The richening of 3s on the curve appears to be a result of the bull-steepening seen since the last auction. SocGen notes that after the recent, Treasuries appear to be consolidating and may be range-bound into the sale, though disruption is possible from geopolitics, of course. Low dealer holdings in the 3s bucket could be supportive of the auction, SocGen argues, though six of the last ten auctions have tailed, adding to the negatives.</p><p><strong>RECENT 3-YEAR NOTE AUCTION HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>Tail: (Prev. 0.3bps, 6-auction avg. 0.1bps)</li><li>High Yield: (Prev. 1.573%, 6-auction avg. 1.900%)</li><li>Bid-to-Cover: (Prev. 2.43x, 6-auction avg. 2.47)</li><li>Dealers: (Prev. 37.2%, 6-auction avg. 35.9%)</li><li>Directs: (Prev. 16.6%, 6-auction avg. 17.6%)</li><li>Indirects: (Prev. 46.2%, 6-auction avg. 46.4%)</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Pound perilously close to 1.2200 and 0.9000 as no deal Brexit beckons",
        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling losses have steadily accumulated, initially on reports of a rather full and frank exchange of views between UK PM Johnson and German Chancellor Merkel that was said to be challenging and described as a clarifying moment by Number 10 sources, with the upshot that a deal may never be unreachable. Subsequently, EU’s Tusk accused Johnson of engaging in blame games rather than trying to forge an agreement, but the EC maintained that further talks planned for today will go ahead. Nevertheless, although the writing may not yet be on the wall, reading between the lines indicates that the chances of a compromise on the Irish border and customs arrangement are getting slimmer, and Cable has extended losses through last week’s low (1.2205) to the figure or just below, while Eur/Gbp got to within a whisker of 0.9000 before fading as the single currency continued to hit resistance into 1.1000 against the Dollar.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY/NZD</strong></p><p>No shock to see the Franc and Yen outperform on risk-off grounds, partly due to the Brexit developments noted above, but also as the SCMP suggested that China has toned down expectations gong into this week’s Washington trade talks, and may head back to Beijing a day earlier than scheduled. Moreover, head of the Chinese delegation, Lui He will apparently not be adorned with the title of special envoy, which indicates no particular instructions from China’s Premier and perhaps a limited remit for any form of accord. Usd/Chf is hovering just above 0.9900 and Usd/Jpy has pulled back further from around 107.45 through 107.00, but perhaps more surprisingly the Kiwi is also bid, albeit on positive NZ specifics and favourable cross winds. To recap, Nzd/Usd was boosted by the Finance Ministry announcing a 4 bn budget surplus over and above forecast, on top of <strong>AUD</strong>/Nzd slipping deeper below 1.0700 amidst a drift in Aud/Usd from 0.6750+ towards 0.6730 as the Aussie lost momentum on the aforementioned US-China trade news.</p><p><strong>CNH/CAD/EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All on a weaker footing vs the Greenback amidst broad risk aversion, as the <strong>DXY </strong>straddles 99.000 in a firmer, though still tight range (99.137-98.842) despite considerably weaker than consensus US PPI data. The off-shore Yuan down through 7.1500, Loonie back below 1.3300, but off wort levels following upbeat Canadian housing starts and building permits and Euro nearer the base of 1.0995-53 parameters after topping out ahead of hefty option expiries spanning 1.1000 (1.3 bn from 1.0995-1.1005 to be precise) and not far from the 21 DMA yet again (1.0993).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Volatile trade across the board and especially for the Lira as US President Trump seemed much more friendly to Turkey when noting its close trade relationship and decision to release Pastor Brunson in 2018, in contrast to his blast and warning to obliterate the economy if its military ops in Syria went out of bounds. Usd/Try has traded up to 5.8450+ and sub-5.7850 at the other extreme, while the Real has pared losses within 4.1125-0800 boundaries after Brazilian Economy Minister Guedes scotched speculation that he plans to depart from the Government in February 2020.</p>",

This morning, China's Ministry of Commerce said to stay tuned for a blacklist retaliation to the recent US decision to list 28 Chinese governmental and commercial organisations, including Hikvision, to the entity list over treatment of the Muslim Uighur community. Further contributing to the downbeat tone, SCMP reported that China is toning down expectations head of US/China trade talks, and even though the round of talks will take place this week, a source says that the Chinese delegation is already planning to cut short its stay in Washington by one night. Moreover, Chinese negotiator Liu He will not carry the title of “special envoy” for President Xi Jinping at the meeting, which the article speculated is an early indication that the vice-premier has not been given any particular instructions from China’s leader. Separately, but also contributing some downside to global equities, was a return of no deal Brexit fears, with UK/EU talks seemingly approaching collapse and the UK government vowed to pursue a no deal exit unless the EU compromises. The confluence of negatives saw DAX Dec’ 19 futures lose the 12000 handle. Moving forward, further impetus likely to come in the form of Fed speak (including Powell at 19.30 BST) and Minutes tomorrow and US/China trade talks, US CPI and ECB Minutes on Thursday.

Usd/Chf is closer to 0.9900, Eur/Usd near the top end of a 1.0965-95 band and Usd/Jpy eyeing 107.00 again from circa 107.45 earlier. Note, latest SCMP reports confirms earlier talk that Beijing is not looking for any major deal and propose to cut their stay short, with Liu He not attending in the guise of special envoy that would imply no remit or agenda to sign off on a full trade agreement.</p><p><strong>NOK/CAD</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Krona and Loonie are both holding relatively steady around 10.0400 vs the single currency and 1.3300 vs the Greenback respectively, with the former largely taking comments from Norges Bank Governor Olsen in stride as he underlined guidance for rates to remain on hold after September’s hike, barring the option to reverse the tightening move if economic developments deteriorated significantly. Meanwhile, Canadian housing starts and building permits are due and may provide the Cad with some independent direction or at least a distraction.</p>",

There was a pare back of last week’s bull steepening in anticipation of further Fed easing post the poor ISM data, with the overhang of Friday’s relatively decent payrolls report cooling some of the October cut pricing.
