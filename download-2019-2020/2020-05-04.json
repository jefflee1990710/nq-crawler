US stock futures, however, pared back losses through the course of US trade, led by dip buying in energy and tech names. Additionally, some of the baskets that were thwarted last week – momentum and growth stand out – also outperformed. Airlines (UAL, DAL, LUV, AAL) all hit after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it had sold its entire stake in the four largest US airliners, noting how the industry has changed in a major way and it could be years before passenger levels return to pre-COVID levels. Apple (AAPL) announced a new 13-inch MacBook Pro Model at USD 1299, it also filed to issue a potential four-part offering. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is reportedly indefinitely postponing the USD 2bln sale of its oil &amp; gas assets in the North Sea; Occidental’s (OXY) USD 8.8bln sales of Anadarko’s African assets to Total (FP FP) is also reportedly facing obstacles in some countries, according to WSJ citing sources. Tesla (TSLA) is reportedly extending the leave of its US employees. Elsewhere, it has reportedly applied for a UK electricity provider license, according to The Telegraph. Meanwhile, since CEO Musk’s tweet storm on Friday, the Co has not provided any more colour around Musk’s outbursts, which will likely see tensions rise between him and the SEC again. The French government has refused Amazon (AMZN) France's request for temporary unemployment schemes at six French sites. SPX +0.4% at 2843, NDX +1.3% at 8834, DJIA +0.1% at 23,750.</p><p>The TPLEX lacked direction to start the week, similar to how it ended last week. On the one hand, a risk off tone overnight had seen the curve bull-flatten, although later in the session the long-end reversed course. Another slew of corporate issuance post-earnings likely influenced the move, including USD 8.5bln from Apple (AAPL), as well as some other large cap names such as Amgen, Altria and Starbucks – Boeing’s (BA) YTD record raise of USD 25bln was only recently digested too. Furthermore, the US Treasury refunding announcement is due on Wednesday where the Treasury will explain how it intends to fund its ballooning deficits as the economy comes to a halt – the prospect of a sovereign supply ramp up is likely keeping some duration bulls on the sidelines. Meanwhile, front-end yields didn’t reverse course like the belly/long-end, accompanied by what one desk notes as what appears to be a growing of cash relative to available collateral in the system, with all three of today’s T-Bill auctions stopping through the screws and seeing higher than average bid-to-cover ratios. Meanwhile, the US Treasury expects to borrow a record USD 2.999trln in net marketable debt in Q2 (April-June), USD 3.055trln more than it estimated in February. US T-note futures (M0) settle 3 ticks higher at 138-31.</p>",

US stock futures, however, pared back losses through the course of US trade, led by dip buying in energy and tech names. Additionally, some of the baskets that were thwarted last week – momentum and growth stand out – also outperformed. Nevertheless, there was a mixed feel to trading conditions; the curve is mixed, with longer-dated yields higher on the day due to a busy corporate issuance slate, while yields along the short-end and belly were flat/lower; the curve itself had a steeper bias, with 2s30s wider by over 6bps in thin conditions. The FX picture was also mixed: the dollar retained its bid above the 50dma, the EUR was red across the board, while activity currencies under a great deal of pressure for most of the session, but recovering in later trade. Commodity currencies were mixed, with oil exporters finding their currencies going positive in late morning trade as crude futures found their way into the black. Elsewhere, gold punched its way back above 1700 again, and has stayed there as we enter APAC trade. The focus overnight will be on the RBA, although we aren’t expecting it to change the narrative too much. This week, the key jobs update will be eyed on Friday (API on Wednesday and jobless claims on Thursday, ahead of NFP Friday) and while the headline figure is going to be grim, some of the underlying details may be of more interest over the coming months (metrics such as the underemployment rate, participation rate, and savings rates will be eyed over the months ahead). Elsewhere, the BOE confab on Thursday is unlikely to be a game changer either.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>CHINA:</strong> Anti-China rhetoric from US officials continued over the weekend. US President Trump said tariffs would be the ultimate punishment on China and warned that if China doesn't buy US goods, the US will end the trade deal. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Pompeo stated that there is enormous evidence that the coronavirus outbreak originated in a laboratory in Wuhan although he didn’t provide evidence to support the claims, while he accused China of stonewalling investigations and refusing to co-operate with experts. AP reported that new US intelligence analysis claimed that China intentionally concealed severity of coronavirus pandemic to stock up on critical medical supplies needed to combat the outbreak. A Reuters sources piece reported on an internal Chinese government report, from early March, which warned that Beijing is facing a Tiananmen-like global backlash over COVID-19 which could tip US relations into armed confrontation. The report noted that China's Belt and Road projects could be at risk due to resistance and the US could increase financial and military support for regional allies which could sever security in Asia. The report also called for cooperation as the \"sound and steady development of China-US relations\" is both countries' interest.</p><p><strong>ELECTION RISK RESURFACING:</strong> The Trump administration is \"turbocharging\" an initiative to remove global industrial supply chains from China as it weighs new tariffs to punish Beijing for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reported citing officials familiar with US planning. \"We've been working on [reducing the reliance of our supply chains in China] over the last few years but we are now turbo-charging that initiative,\" a State Department official said. Another official said \"There is a whole of government push on this,\" and agencies were probing which manufacturing should be deemed 'essential' and how to produce these goods outside of China. The article quoted another official: \"This moment is a perfect storm; the pandemic has crystallized all the worries that people have had about doing business with China,\" and \"all the money that people think they made by making deals with China before, now they’ve been eclipsed many-fold by the economic damage\" from COVID. Whether this is electioneering or a genuine threat by the Trump Administration remains to be seen -- both seem like credible scenarios. However, the political uncertainty will be a factor capping the upside, strategists have said. On the weekend, Goldman Sachs said investors have begun to ask question about US/China again, and while the bank believes that this rhetoric is more designed for domestic audiences in the US in the context of the election cycle, it cannot rule out a return to some of the issues that roiled markets last year. GS said it will be closely watching for signs that US officials are considering taking specific actions, such as the introduction of investment restrictions.</p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p>GERMAN COURT RULING: At 09:00BST on May 5th, the German Constitutional Court (GCC) in Karlsruhe will publish its final verdict on the legality of the ECB’s Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP). Desks do not believe the programme will be ruled as a violation of the German constitution, but eyes will be on whether the GCC hands out conditions that could limit the PSPP’s efficiency and flexibility (via the Bundesbank’s participation), whilst the ECB’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) also risks being dragged in. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-german-constitutional-court-will-rule-on-the-ecb-s-pspp-on-tuesday-may-5th-04-05-2020\">Click here full preview.</a></p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED PMCCF/SMCCF: </strong>The NY Fed announced that its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) would be set up to purchase eligible ETFs in early May, without giving a precise date. The statement said that the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) is expected to become operational, and the SMCCF to begin purchasing eligible corporate bonds, soon thereafter. Some had expected the FOMC meeting last week to specify details on when these facilities would be established. The mere announcement of the facilities back in March has been accredited as a key driver in supporting the narrowing of credit spreads across the spectrum, particularly IG, which has reinvigorated the debt markets as participants feel increasingly comfortable in the Fed’s backstop. In contrast to the ECB, which is a dominant bidder in European corporate offerings, the Fed’s facilities are for now – as intended - a “last resort”, where record YTD volumes in the dollar market have been seen before the facilities have even got off the ground. Thus, the mere signalling from the Fed in the form of its credit facility announcements has been considered adequate to restore confidence in the US credit markets.</p><p><strong>RBA PREVIEW:</strong> The Reserve Bank of Australia will announce its latest policy decision on Tuesday in which the central bank is expected to maintain the Cash Rate Target at the record low of 0.25% with all surveyed analysts forecasting no change in rates. However, money markets would suggest otherwise with ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures pointing to a 62% chance of a 25bps cut and just a 38% likelihood for a hold despite the RBA previously noting that the current rate was the effective lower bound. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24436/download?code=U6yhhzu3WQCzfmgu1Kw1\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 0.61 HIGHER AT USD 20.39/BBL, WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 0.49 HIGHER AT 22.78/BBL; BRENT (N0) SETTLED USD 0.76 HIGHER AT USD 27.20</strong></p><p>The energy complex had traded in the red overnight and in Europe before clawing back into positive going into the US session. The chorus of medium- to longer-term price bulls grows louder while the bearish near-term outlook remains amid acute demand contraction and storage capacity limits being tested. Crude futures continue to be strongly influenced by participants’ assessments of when the oil market will return to more balanced levels, as well as avoidance of exposure to near-term market conditions as many are rolling into further contracts earlier than normal, particularly in the physically settled WTI benchmark – June futures (M0) are due to expire May 19th and open interest in the July (N0) contract has already exceeded the June. Some of Monday’s strength had been attributed to Genscape’s latest estimate of weekly Cushing stocks, traders said, which are seen to have built by 1.8mln bbls, which if seen in the official DOE data, would mean the smallest build since mid-March. A declining growth rate of inventories should slow the reaching of storage capacity limits, although is only the initial steps to rebalancing the market. Citi’s analysts note that the recent near-term strength is a concern to them since the market has only entered a transitional phase; “the surplus will shrink, but inventories will continue to rise for the next 2-3 months. And once the market swings to a deficit, inventories will remain elevated for some further period of time.”</p><p><strong>TEXAS</strong> Railroad Commissioner Sitton today said that he would be withdrawing his proposal for a state-mandated 1mln BPD oil production cut. The regulatory body is due to vote tomorrow on whether to pro-rate production, although Sitton noted that the opportunity to do so has been missed. Further, other voting officials have expressed opposition to mandated cuts, noting that producers have already carried out voluntary reductions and drawn attention to the relative insignificance of a cut in Texas in addressing the global market imbalance.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLE 3 TICKS HIGHER AT 138-31.</strong></p><p>The TPLEX lacked direction to start the week, similar to how it ended last week. On the one hand, a risk off tone overnight had seen the curve bull-flatten, although later in the session the long-end reversed course. Another slew of corporate issuance post-earnings likely influenced the move, including USD 8.5bln from Apple (AAPL), as well as some other large cap names such as Amgen, Altria and Starbucks – Boeing’s (BA) YTD record raise of USD 25bln was only recently digested too. Furthermore, the US Treasury refunding announcement is due on Wednesday where the Treasury will explain how it intends to fund its ballooning deficits as the economy comes to a halt – the prospect of a sovereign supply ramp up is likely keeping some duration bulls on the sidelines. Meanwhile, front-end yields didn’t reverse course like the belly/long-end, accompanied by what one desk notes as what appears to be a growing of cash relative to available collateral in the system, with all three of today’s T-Bill auctions stopping through the screws and seeing higher than average bid-to-cover ratios. Meanwhile, the US Treasury expects to borrow a record USD 2.999trln in net marketable debt in Q2 (April-June), USD 3.055trln more than it estimated in February.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.4% at 2843, NDX +1.3% at 8834, DJIA +0.1% at 23,750.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy +3.7%, IT +1.4%, Communication Svs. +1%, Utilities +0.75%, Consumer Discretionary +0.7%, Materials +0.4%, Health Care +0.1%, Consumer Staples +0.01%, Real Estate -0.01%, Financials -0.9%, Industrials -1.3%</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Airlines (UAL, DAL, LUV, AAL) all hit after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it had sold its entire stake in the four largest US airliners, noting how the industry has changed in a major way and it could be years before passenger levels return to pre-COVID levels. Apple (AAPL) announced a new 13-inch MacBook Pro Model at USD 1299, it also filed to issue a potential four-part offering. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is reportedly indefinitely postponing the USD 2bln sale of its oil &amp; gas assets in the North Sea; Occidental’s (OXY) USD 8.8bln sales of Anadarko’s African assets to Total (FP FP) is also reportedly facing obstacles in some countries, according to WSJ citing sources. Tesla (TSLA) is reportedly extending the leave of its US employees. Elsewhere, it has reportedly applied for a UK electricity provider license, according to The Telegraph. Meanwhile, since CEO Musk’s tweet storm on Friday, the Co has not provided any more colour around Musk’s outbursts, which will likely see tensions rise between him and the SEC again. The French government has refused Amazon (AMZN) France's request for temporary unemployment schemes at six French sites. Elsewhere, a Senior Engineer and VP at AWS has reportedly resigned as he disagrees with the firing of whistle-blowers who questioned the company’s health and safety practices, according to FT. General Electric (GE) Aviation unit expects global traffic to be down around 80% in Q2 when compared to the start of pandemic effect in China seen in early February. The unit also announced it is to cut its global workforce by 25% this year due to the impact on travel, according to CNBC.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS</strong>: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/B) recorded a record net loss of 49.75bln, adding it has furloughed workers and cut employee salaries. Tyson Foods (TSN) missed on EPS and revenue, noted it expects volumes in H2 20 to decrease and it has cut FY20 CapEx view. Sempra Energy (SRE) beat on EPS, missed on revenue although FY EPS guidance was better than expected. EARNINGS UPDATE: Credit Suisse highlight 73% of the S&amp;P500 market cap has reported Q1 figures where on aggregate earnings are beating estimates by 3% apart from Financials who were weighed on after building heavy provisions for credit losses. The desk notes earnings are beating expectations by 8.1%, while 69% of companies are exceeding their lowered guidance.</p><p><strong>Q1 2020 EARNINGS SEASON UPDATE:</strong> Credit Suisse highlights that 73% of the S&amp;P 500 market cap has reported Q1 figures; on aggregate, earnings are beating estimates by 3% ex-financials, which have been pressured after building heavy provisions for credit losses. CS notes earnings are beating expectations by 8.1%, while 69% of companies are exceeding their lowered guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>FOREX</strong></h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> The US dollar is higher amid risk-off sentiment at the start of the week, and the DXY's 50dma (just under 99.30) has provided a floor for the Buck's action on Monday. Seasonality is in focus, now that we are in May; over the last decade, the buck has appreciated by 1.8% on average in eight of those ten years. This seasonality may be a function of issuance in May which may again see foreign demand for dollars. Headline risk has also supported the dollar on Monday, with renewed tensions between US and China, as November electioneering begins. Elsewhere, JPM argues that QE will play less of a driver for the USD compared to the last crisis, given the front-loaded, synchronised deployment by global policymakers; this time, QE differentiation will be more nuanced, JPM argues, and nations with large QE programmes and large fiscal and current account deficits will be vulnerable (GBP, NZD, CAD) to USD strength, while the USD's performance overall will be linked more to global growth.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The EUR is lower against the dollar and yen, though is gaining against highly cyclical/risk-sensitive currencies like the NOK, SEK and GBP. At the tail-end of last week, the single currency rose to within a stones throw of its 200dma (around the 1.1030 region), but has found the air thin above the 1.10 handle. Desks suggest that last week's upside may have been a function of spec shorts being squeezed in thin market conditions. UBS says the next focus for the single currency will be Tuesday's ruling out of Germany's constitutional court on the ECB's QE programme; \"a negative ruling might be an outside chance, but nonetheless hard to ignore the risk,\" UBS writes, \"so topside could be limited in the pair.\"</p><p><strong>HAVENS:</strong> Havens were generally firmer today even against a rising buck with USDJPY crossing 107.00 to the downside as tensions between US and China increase with worries surrounding trade. Geopolitics also supporting the JPY as both North Korea and South Korea exchanged gunfire. XAU also bid which crossed above 1700 once again. The CHF however was weaker against the dollar but firmer against a weaker EUR. EURCHF downside however did hold less conviction than other EUR crosses and saw lows of 1.0525.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (AUD, NZD, GBP, SEK):</strong> Amid an overall mixed risk appetite, cyclical FX performed poorly today, with underperformance in NZD although it stays above 0.6000 finding support at the 0.6010 level. AUD saw tentative trade ahead of tonight’s RBA decision (preview here). AUD will be particularly eyed given its high China exposure amid renewed tensions with the US. GBP also hit today on risk sentiment although reports suggest the UK is looking to relax lockdown measures on May 26th, 3 weeks later than some had hoped on their update set to be announced on May 7th. SEK was firmer against a weak EUR, although softer against the buck; the manufacturing PMI declined to 36.7 from a revised lower 42.6 figure.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY (RUB, CAD, MXN):</strong> Both RUB and CAD trade rather flat at pixel time after choppy price action led by fluctuating oil prices and dollar strength. RUB saw some weakness in the morning in led by softer crude prices, although with WTI just off highs the RUB regained some ground against the dollar. CAD traded firmer against a rising buck initially aided by the bounce in oil prices although the move has pared after finding support at 1.4050, a level tested on the re-open of electronic trade, a level highlighted by Scotiabank who notes that “after finding support in the mid 1.38 area, the near-term risk has tilted back towards a retest of the 1.4265 peak from last month” although progress may be slowed at 1.4110-70 area amid “significant congestion resistance” in the USD.&nbsp; The MXN however performed well despite a record low manufacturing PMI which pointed towards the sharpest declines in business conditions since the data began. The Peso however was supported by a pickup in oil prices as the US session was underway.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> BRL underperformed once again amid ongoing political uncertainty as it played catch up from its Labour daybreak while President Bolsonaro ignored the Supreme Court and Appointed its new Federal Police Director as Rolando Alexandre de Souza. ZAR however performed well recovering from recent lows which newswires are labelling as a technical rebound. TRY softer against the buck despite a firmer than expected CPI, although PMI data was dismal.</p>",

On the one hand, a risk off tone overnight had left the curve mixed, although later in the session the long-end reversed course. Another slew of corporate issuance post-earnings likely influenced the move, including USD 8.5bln from Apple (AAPL), as well as some other large cap names such as Amgen, Altria and Starbucks – Boeing’s (BA) YTD record raise of USD 25bln was only recently digested too. Furthermore, the US Treasury refunding announcement is due on Wednesday where the Treasury will explain how it intends to fund its ballooning deficits as the economy comes to a halt – the prospect of a sovereign supply ramp up is likely keeping some duration bulls on the sidelines. Meanwhile, front-end yields didn’t reverse course like the belly/long-end, accompanied by what one desk notes as what appears to be a growing of cash relative to available collateral in the system, with all three of today’s T-Bill auctions stopping through the screws and seeing higher than average bid-to-cover ratios.

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD</strong>: The US dollar is higher amid risk-off sentiment at the start of the week, and the DXY's 50dma (just under 99.30) has provided a floor for the Buck's action on Monday. Seasonality is in focus, now that we are in May; over the last decade, the buck has appreciated by 1.8% on average in eight of those ten years. This seasonality may be a function of issuance in May which may again see foreign demand for dollars. Headline risk has also supported the dollar on Monday, with renewed tensions between US and China, as November electioneering begins. Elsewhere, JPM argues that QE will play less of a driver for the USD compared to the last crisis, given the front-loaded, synchronised deployment by global policymakers; this time, QE differentiation will be more nuanced, JPM argues, and nations with large QE programmes and large fiscal and current account deficits will be vulnerable (GBP, NZD, CAD) to USD strength, while the USD's performance overall will be linked more to global growth.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong>: The EUR is lower against the dollar and yen, though is gaining against highly cyclical/risk-sensitive currencies like the NOK, SEK and GBP. At the tail-end of last week, the single currency rose to within a stones throw of its 200dma (around the 1.1030 region), but has found the air thin above the 1.10 handle. Desks suggest that last week's upside may have been a function of spec shorts being squeezed in thin market conditions. UBS says the next focus for the single currency will be Tuesday's ruling out of Germany's constitutional court on the ECB's QE programme; \"a negative ruling might be an outside chance, but nonetheless hard to ignore the risk,\" UBS writes, \"so topside could be limited in the pair.\"</p><p><strong>HAVENS</strong>: Havens were generally firmer today even against a rising buck with USDJPY crossing 107.00 to the downside as tensions between US and China increase with worries surrounding trade. Geopolitics also supporting the JPY as both North Korea and South Korea exchanged gunfire. XAU also bid which crossed above 1700 once again. The CHF however was weaker against the dollar but firmer against a weaker EUR. EURCHF downside however did hold less conviction than other EUR crosses and saw lows of 1.0525.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (AUD, NZD, GBP, SEK):</strong> Amid an overall mixed risk appetite, cyclical FX performed poorly today, with underperformance in NZD although it stays above 0.6000 finding support at the 0.6010 level. AUD saw tentative trade ahead of tonight’s RBA decision (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24436/download?code=U6yhhzu3WQCzfmgu1Kw1\">preview here</a>). AUD will be particularly eyed given its high China exposure amid renewed tensions with the US. GBP also hit today on risk sentiment although reports suggest the UK is looking to relax lockdown measures on May 26th, 3 weeks later than some had hoped on their update set to be announced on May 7th. SEK was firmer against a weak EUR, although softer against the buck; the manufacturing PMI declined to 36.7 from a revised lower 42.6 figure.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY (RUB, CAD, MXN): </strong>Both RUB and CAD trade rather flat at pixel time after choppy price action led by fluctuating oil prices and dollar strength. RUB saw some weakness in the morning in led by softer crude prices, although with WTI just off highs the RUB regained some ground against the dollar. CAD traded firmer against a rising buck initially aided by the bounce in oil prices although the move has pared after finding support at 1.4050, a level tested on the re-open of electronic trade, a level highlighted by Scotiabank who notes that “after finding support in the mid 1.38 area, the near-term risk has tilted back towards a retest of the 1.4265 peak from last month” although progress may be slowed at 1.4110-70 area amid “significant congestion resistance” in the USD.&nbsp; The MXN however performed well despite a record low manufacturing PMI which pointed towards the sharpest declines in business conditions since the data began. The Peso however was supported by a pickup in oil prices as the US session was underway.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> BRL underperformed once again amid ongoing political uncertainty as it played catch up from its Labour daybreak while President Bolsonaro ignored the Supreme Court and Appointed its new Federal Police Director as Rolando Alexandre de Souza. ZAR however performed well recovering from recent lows which newswires are labelling as a technical rebound. TRY softer against the buck despite a firmer than expected CPI, although PMI data was dismal.</p>",

The chorus of medium- to longer-term price bulls grows louder while the bearish near-term outlook remains amid acute demand contraction and storage capacity limits being tested. Crude futures continue to be strongly influenced by participants’ assessments of when the oil market will return to more balanced levels, as well as avoidance of exposure to near-term market conditions as many are rolling into further contracts earlier than normal, particularly in the physically settled WTI benchmark – June futures (M0) are due to expire May 19th and open interest in the July (N0) contract has already exceeded the June. Some of Monday’s strength had been attributed to Genscape’s latest estimate of weekly Cushing stocks, traders said, which are seen to have built by 1.8mln bbls, which if seen in the official DOE data, would mean the smallest build since mid-March. A declining growth rate of inventories should slow the reaching of storage capacity limits, although is only the initial steps to rebalancing the market. Citi’s analysts note that the recent near-term strength is a concern to them since the market has only entered a transitional phase; “the surplus will shrink, but inventories will continue to rise for the next 2-3 months. And once the market swings to a deficit, inventories will remain elevated for some further period of time.”</li><li><strong>TEXAS</strong> Railroad Commissioner Sitton today said that he would be withdrawing his proposal for a state-mandated 1mln BPD oil production cut. The regulatory body is due to vote tomorrow on whether to pro-rate production, although Sitton noted that the opportunity to do so has been missed. Further, other voting officials have expressed opposition to mandated cuts, noting that producers have already carried out voluntary reductions and drawn attention to the relative insignificance of a cut in Texas in addressing the global market imbalance.</li></ul>",

As such, risk sentiment remains averse to the benefit of the Dollar with the index recovering from its post end of April hangover and surviving several wobbles to establish a firmer base above 99.000.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/RUB/MXN&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All paring losses vs the Greenback alongside similar moves in the crude complex, as the Loonie reclaims 1.4100+ status, Norwegian Krona trades firmer vs the Euro around 11.3200 compared to circa 11.4650 at one stage, Rouble rebounds just over a big figure from nearly 76.0000 and Mexican Peso tests 24.3000 having been down to 24.8770 earlier.</p><p><strong>EUR/NZD/CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>The Euro and Kiwi are propping up the G10 table, albeit not faring that much worse than the Pound or Swiss Franc in terms of percentage declines against the Buck. Eur/Usd and Nzd/Usd are both looking precarious above round numbers at 1.0900 and 0.6000 respectively, with the former losing the prop of a 1bn option expiry at the strike and latter not deriving lasting momentum on the COVID-19 front after NZ recorded zero new infections or via S&amp;P reaffirming the sovereign’s AA standing with a positive ratings outlook. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf is edging beyond 0.9560 and Cable is closer to 1.2400 than 1.2400, though Eur/Chf and Eur/Gbp are both lower due to the aforementioned marginal single currency underperformance.</p><p><strong>JPY/AUD</strong></p><p>Also poised near psychological levels and looking vulnerable to handing back more of their recent gains to the Usd if it continues to recover, as the Yen skirts 107.00 and Aussie flirts with 0.6400. Not much reaction to confirmation of Japan extending lockdown to the end of May on the latest Golden Week holiday, though the Aud should be more sensitive to the looming RBA policy meeting given ‘expectations’ for no change in rates, but money market pricing still far from convinced about no further easing – check out our headline feed and research suite for a full preview of the event.</p><p><strong>SEK/EM</strong></p><p>Choppy Monday sessions, as the Swedish Crown stages a similar comeback to its Scandi neighbour despite more acute manufacturing sector contraction, albeit with the aid of more pronounced Euro depreciation post-EZ PMIs, Sentix and downbeat SPF economic updates, while the Lira has not been able to turn the tide following firmer than expected Turkish inflation data. Elsewhere, the Real was already racking up corrective or catch up loses on return from Brazil’s Labour Day break, but also had to contend with more political drama after President Bolsonaro went against the Supreme Court and appointed Rolando Alexandre de Souza as Federal Police director. However, the Rand has staged another recovery with some solace taken from SA manufacturing PMI falling less than anticipated.</p>",

For NY State specifically, the case count cooled to <strong>1.1% D/D from 1.5% </strong>(average between 27th April and 3rd May was 1.3% D/D); the pace of the death toll had fallen to <strong>1.5% D/D from 1.6% </strong>(average was 1.8% over that same period).</li><li>NOTE: The CDC states that numbers reported on Saturdays and Sundays are preliminary and not yet confirmed by local health departments. Accordingly, these numbers may be revised when the numbers are updated on Monday.</li><li>Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security director Tom Inglesby on Sunday told NBC that the COVID incubation period meant it would take two-to-three weeks for any spike in infections due to relaxed restrictions to become apparent. US President Trump was hopeful on the weekend that there would be a vaccine by the end of the year, and said he wanted schools and Universities to be open in September.</li><li>New Jersey Governor Murphy said he will announce a plan for school re-openings on Monday (today). New York City Mayor De Blasio said reopening the city was \"obviously a few months away at the minimum\", while the Washington State Governor extended the stay at home order through May 31st.</li><li>Weekend press has been full of warnings (don't expect a quick recovery, WSJ reported; don't expect consumer spending to normalise quickly, Barron's echoed). It is another reminder (if you needed one) that the notion of a V-shape recovery is challenged, and strategists have suggested that this may cap equities until there is more clarity.</li><li>Areas where clarity is required include: how reinfections will play out when lock downs are lifted, whether furloughed staff will all return, and indeed, how these events will result in bankruptcies/defaults/debt restructurings in the months ahead.</li><li>In terms of the COVID treatments itself, some desks have suggested that anticipation of positive Gilead (GILD) news on remdesivir was a supporting factor for equities last week, which may have prevented some from adding shorts; now that the news has passed, that 'support' may have disappeared.&nbsp;</li><li>More broadly, the market wants to see evidence that companies continue to see the worst of the pandemic's initial fallout behind them, and late April business trends show a bounce back - companies that have alluded to this 'linearity' have performed well after earnings (notably: MSFT, FB, GOOG).&nbsp;</li><li>And on the consumer side, jobs data normalising quickly would be a welcome sign (with a particular focus on the participation rates, underemployment rates, and savings rates for clues about consumer behaviour changes - jobs report on Friday, but these trends will take time to develop).</li></ul>",

Yields are lower on the Treasury curve, with spreads slightly lower.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> All sectors open in the red with Energy outperforming amid firmer oil prices, defensives also relatively outperforming with Health Care and Utilities marginally lower in comparison to other sectors where Industrials are underperforming with General Electric (GE) weighing on the sector after a bleak update from its Aviation unit.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Airlines (UAL, DAL, LUV, AAL) all hit after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it had sold its entire stake in the four largest US airliners, noting how the industry has changed in a major way and it could be years before passenger levels return to pre-COVID levels. Apple (AAPL) announced a new 13-inch MacBook Pro Model at USD 1299, it also filed to issue a potential four-part offering. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is reportedly indefinitely postponing the USD 2bln sale of its oil &amp; gas assets in the North Sea; Occidental’s (OXY) USD 8.8bln sales of Anadarko’s African assets to Total (FP FP) is also reportedly facing obstacles in some countries, according to WSJ citing sources. Tesla (TSLA) is reportedly extending the leave of its US employees. Elsewhere, it has reportedly applied for a UK electricity provider license, according to The Telegraph. Meanwhile, since CEO Musk’s tweet storm on Friday, the Co has not provided any more colour around Musk’s outbursts, which will likely see tensions rise between him and the SEC again. The French government has refused Amazon (AMZN) France's request for temporary unemployment schemes at six French sites. Elsewhere, a Senior Engineer and VP at AWS has reportedly resigned as he disagrees with the firing of whistleblowers who questioned the company’s health and safety practices, according to FT. General Electric (GE) Aviation unit expects global traffic to be down around 80% in Q2 when compared to the start of pandemic effect in China seen in early February. The unit also announced it is to cut its global workforce by 25% this year due to the impact on travel, according to CNBC.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS</strong>: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/B) recorded a record net loss of 49.75bln, adding it has furloughed workers and cut employee salaries.

EARNINGS UPDATE: Credit Suisse highlight 73% of the S&amp;P500 market cap has reported Q1 figures where on aggregate earnings are beating estimates by 3% apart from Financials who were weighed on after building heavy provisions for credit losses. The desk notes earnings are beating expectations by 8.1%, while 69% of companies are exceeding their lowered guidance.</p><p><strong>Q1 2020 EARNINGS SEASON UPDATE: </strong>Credit Suisse highlights that 73% of the S&amp;P 500 market cap has reported Q1 figures; on aggregate, earnings are beating estimates by 3% ex-financials, which have been pressured after building heavy provisions for credit losses. CS notes earnings are beating expectations by 8.1%, while 69% of companies are exceeding their lowered guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CREDIT VS EQUITIES: </strong>Analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on corporate credit relative to equities. The fundamental driver for renewed optimism has undoubtedly been the decree of monetary stimulus, where both the Fed and ECB have moved quickly to implement backstops to credit markets and funding channels. The combination of purchases and signalling from central banks has seen spreads narrow materially from their March blowout levels, as well as bring the new issuance market to record volumes, seeing the US IG Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) almost make a full retracement to its early-March levels. UBS’s analysts have expressed their overweight position in US HY (note the HYG ETF has only made a c. 50% retracement from the lows), noting, “Since 1987, there have been 42 months with spreads in excess of 800bps, and subsequent 12-month total returns were positive in all cases but one with a median return of 24.5%.” The bank sees US HY spreads tightening to 550bps; spreads currently reside around the 800bps figure.</p><p><strong>WATCHING DIVIDENDS: </strong>Morgan Stanley argues that dividends are what really matters for stock prices in the end. The bank says that the S&amp;P 500 appears to be tracking the dividend futures market more closely than EPS forecasts. Its screener shows that to date, one-third of its screen has reduced or suspended dividends. \"Dividend risks appear higher at the stock than the index level,\" MS writes, \"S&amp;P dividend futures are currently implying a 20% drop in dividend forecasts, but we think that is too bearish.\" although recent cash flow stress test showed that these forecasts were only likely to materialise in very stressed scenarios where companies do not use its balance sheet to defend dividends or flex payout ratios, and MS argues that this seems unlikely based on extrapolated cuts/increases YTD. \"Risks still remain at the stock level though – our quant team has shown dividend cuts to be consistent with negative alpha – and our cash flow stress tests give some indication where risks may be highest.\"</p><p><strong>SELL IN MAY?: </strong>The cliched, somewhat tedious adage has returned for its annual outing. Morgan Stanley argues that a correction in markets is due, perhaps to the magnitude of 10%, but this would just be a refreshing, necessary pause, the bank argues. \"Our bullish view has not changed, nor has the narrative – a severe recession acknowledged by all, the bottoming rate of change in economic data/earnings revisions, seemingly unlimited central bank support, unprecedented fiscal stimulus that we believe is likely to become structural in nature and that leads to rising inflation expectations sooner than the consensus expects.\" The bank has, however, tilted towards High-Beta, Cyclicals and Small Caps; \"While this is a change in our strategy from the past few years to be more defensive, it is not an abandonment of High Quality and/or Growth Stocks,\" the bank explains, \"while such a rotation is difficult to trust while the data remain so weak and the outlook unclear, history suggests it's exactly what one needs to do at this stage of the cycle.\"</p>",

The trend for PEPP has been relatively stead around the EUR 20bln or so region for the limited run of the programme so fa; however, this week’s marked increase as well as the substantial decrease in APP could potentially indicate the ECB is beginning to favour conducting its support operations via the PEPP system. As such, it will be interesting to see how this dynamic continues to evolve especially as the newly announced PELTROs begin to hit the financial system (more below).</li><li>In terms of last week’s purchases focus was, until mid-day Thursday at least, on whether the ECB would take any further easing actions; notably, if there would be an increase to the size of the PEPP scheme as desks calculate this is likely to run out around September/October this year at the current purchase pace. However, Lagarde and Co. refrained from making any changes to their current purchase remit but made abundantly clear a willingness to increase the size and adjust the composition as is necessary ahead.</li><li>At this meeting a further long-term refinancing scheme was announced, Pandemic Emergency Longer-Term Refinancing Operations or PELTROs, which are designed to provide liquidity withing the Euro Area as a backstop following the expiry of LTROs since March’20. Severn of the PELTROs will be conducted with an interest rate of -0.25% (25bp below the refi rate, which is currently 0%) first operation to be announced on May 19th and the final on December 1st. As with other operations, the ECB remarked they are prepared to provide additionally liquidity through this if required.</li><li>Note, German Constitutional Court is to rule on the PSPP tomorrow (May 5th) at 09:00BST.

        "content": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>At 09:00BST on May 5th, the German Constitutional Court (GCC) in Karlsruhe will publish its final verdict on the legality of the ECB’s Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP). Desks do not believe the programme will be ruled as a violation of the German constitution, but eyes will be on whether the GCC hands out conditions that could limit the PSPP’s efficiency and flexibility (via the Bundesbank’s participation), whilst the ECB’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) also risks being dragged in.</p><p>German Eurosceptics have repeatedly asked the GCC to outlaw some of the ECB’s unconventional policy responses. In a hearing late-July 2019, the GCC voiced support to claims that the ECB overstepped its mandate whilst breaching the prohibition of monetary financing. The Court also said the ECB needs to consider the negative side effects of unconventional policy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>THE RISKS:</strong></p><p>The ECB does not have to follow German law. The hurdles also remain high for the German court to rule against the Central Bank and thus the European Court of Justice (ECJ) - after latter ruled the programme did not infringe EU law in 2018. A simple disagreement will not be sufficient to overrule the ECJ, whilst a head-on collision with the ECB and ECJ could unravel legal issues regarding German vs. EU law.</p><p><strong>POTENTIAL LIMITS AND FALLOUT:</strong></p><p>Potential limits imposed on the PSPP could include:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>A cap on the total monthly volumes of purchases</li><li>Distribution of purchases consistent with capital keys</li><li>Issuer and issue limits</li><li>Eligibility criteria based on credit ratings</li></ol><p>An imposition of limits could mean the ECB pays less attention to PSPP and more so on the PEPP, thus opening the door for a new court case against the ECB’s Pandemic Programme – which has fewer “strings” attached and hence could prove more vulnerable in court, albeit a final decision is not expected to be made before end-2021, after the PEPP expires at the end of 2020 (assuming no extension).</p><p>Rulings against these programmes would mean: 1) The Bundesbank will be put in a position where it is legally required to follow the ECB and at the same time adhere to the German Constitutional Court ruling, 2) The ECB will not be able to ignore the ruling of the highest court in the largest member state.</p><p>Desks note that the wording of the GCC ruling will be crucial to understand the ECB room for manoeuvre.</p>",

The article quoted another official: \"This moment is a perfect storm; the pandemic has crystallized all the worries that people have had about doing business with China,\" said another senior US official, and \"all the money that people think they made by making deals with China before, now they’ve been eclipsed many-fold by the economic damage\" from COVID. Whether this is electioneering or a genuine threat by the Trump Administration remains to be seen -- both seem like credible scenarios. However, the political uncertainty will be a factor capping the upside, strategists have said. On the weekend, Goldman Sachs said investors have begun to ask question about US/China again, and while the bank believes that this rhetoric is more designed for domestic audiences in the US in the context of the election cycle, it cannot rule out a return to some of the issues that roiled markets last year. GS said it will be closely watching for signs that US officials are considering taking specific actions, such as the introduction of investment restrictions.</p><p><strong>SHAPE OF THE RECOVERY:</strong> A WSJ article Saturday argued not to expect a quick rebound in activity as the economy re-opens, since it might be a while before consumer and business behaviour normalises. This lack of V-shape recovery limits the potential for significant near-term equity upside, some strategists have argued, given the uncertainties around how reinfections will play out when lockdowns are lifted, whether furloughed staff will all return, and indeed, how these events will result in bankruptcies in the months ahead. None of this is likely to be resolved imminently, meaning that the veil of uncertainty will linger as the election cycle gets fully underway. That election cycle is already presenting some headwinds after US President Trump stoked US/China tensions last week and. While some note stock buybacks - previously a key part of equity upside - will resume in the quarters ahead, these are still likely to be negative in Y/Y terms by the end of 2020. With that said, desks have noted that this uncertainty might not necessarily translate into sharp equity downside, given the backstop provided by monetary and fiscal authorities - support which is unlikely to be pulled any time soon. For traders, this could mean horizontal trading conditions in the near-term until progress is made on some of these themes.</p><p><strong>NORTH KOREA:</strong> Sunday news that North and South Korea exchanged gunfire across the Demilitarized Zone has brought APAC geopolitical tensions to the fore once again. Details are thin: it appears North Korea fired first, and it is also unclear what prompted the incident. Secretary of State Pompeo said he thinks it may have been an accident, and a South Korean defence official echoed that sentiment, telling AP that the country also believes the shots were likely not a calculated decision. Recently, US President Trump has been elusive on answering questions about North Korea, following reports about the health of leader Kim. However, Trump may be compelled to begin giving more specific answers following the weekend's incident, which will keep defensive plays in the mind of traders.</p><p><strong>WATCHING DIVIDENDS:</strong> Morgan Stanley argues that dividends are what really matters for stock prices in the end. The bank says that the S&amp;P 500 appears to be tracking the dividend futures market more closely than EPS forecasts. Its screener shows that to date, one-third of its screen has reduced or suspended dividends. \"Dividend risks appear higher at the stock than the index level,\" MS writes, \"S&amp;P dividend futures are currently implying a 20% drop in dividend forecasts, but we think that is too bearish.\" although recent cash flow stress test showed that these forecasts were only likely to materialise in very stressed scenarios where&nbsp;companies do not use its balance sheet to defend dividends or flex payout ratios, and MS argues that this seems unlikely based on extrapolated cuts/increases YTD. \"Risks still remain at the stock level though – our quant team has shown dividend cuts to be consistent with negative alpha – and our cash flow stress tests give some indication where risks may be highest.\"</p><p><strong>SELL IN MAY?:</strong> The cliched, somewhat tedious adage has returned for its annual outing. Morgan Stanley argues that a correction in markets is due, perhaps to the magnitude of 10%, but this would just be a refreshing, necessary pause, the bank argues. \"Our bullish view has not changed, nor has the narrative – a severe recession acknowledged by all, the bottoming rate of change in economic data/earnings revisions, seemingly unlimited central bank support, unprecedented fiscal stimulus that we believe is likely to become structural in nature and that leads to rising inflation expectations sooner than the consensus expects.\" The bank has, however, tilted towards High-Beta, Cyclicals and Small Caps; \"While this is a change in our strategy from the past few years to be more defensive, it is not an abandonment of High Quality and/or Growth Stocks,\" the bank explains, \"while such a rotation is difficult to trust while the data remain so weak and the outlook unclear, history suggests it's exactly what one needs to do at this stage of the cycle.\"</p><p><strong>CREDIT VS EQUITIES:</strong> Analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on corporate credit relative to equities. The fundamental driver for renewed optimism has undoubtedly been the decree of monetary stimulus, where both the Fed and ECB have moved quickly to implement backstops to credit markets and funding channels. The combination of purchases and signalling from central banks has seen spreads narrow materially from their March blowout levels, as well as bring the new issuance market to record volumes, seeing the US IG Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) almost make a full retracement to its early-March levels. UBS’s analysts have expressed their overweight position in US HY (note the HYG ETF has only made a c. 50% retracement from the lows), noting, “Since 1987, there have been 42 months with spreads in excess of 800bps, and subsequent 12-month total returns were positive in all cases but one with a median return of 24.5%.” The bank sees US HY spreads tightening to 550bps; spreads currently reside around the 800bps figure.</p>",

The lack of participants added to the uninspired mood for Hong Kong and the region, with markets in mainland China to reopen on Wednesday due to Labor Day holidays and with Japanese participants returning on Thursday after Golden Week.

US equity futures also post losses of ~1%, with the contracts pressured by a potential rollback in the US-China Phase One trade deal should China not adhere to purchases. UK’s FTSE 100 (-0.2%) index outperforms the region having had its Friday session whilst some downside could be cushioned by a softer Sterling. Sectors are lower across the board – with IT and Consumer Discretionary the laggards, albeit most of this overall downside would be on account of a chunk of Europe catching up to Friday’s trade. In terms of individual movers, BT (-1.4%) opened softer (but nursed some losses) amid reports Telefonica (+3.4%) is said to be in discussions with Liberty Global to combine their UK assets, O2 and Virgin Media, in a joint venture to challenge BT and Sky in the UK – Telefonica states that the Cos are in a negotiating phase and the group is currently not able to guarantee either the terms or probability of its success. Sources added that Liberty Global also reportedly approached Vodafone (-1.1%) regarding a merger, but talks are not currently active. Meanwhile, Fincantieri (+15.8%) was halted limit up after receiving a US Navy contract valued at USD 5.5bln. SocGen (-6.2%) shares see extra pressure as it expects to have provisions of EUR 3.5-5bln this year amid losses caused by the pandemic. CEO also sees CET1 ratio to drop to between 11-15%. Similarly, Thyssenkrupp (-14.5%) plumbs the depths as the Co. anticipates a cash-squeeze despite the lift unit sale. Elsewhere, Roche (+0.3%) remains resilient to the losses in the region after the group was awarded emergency approval in the US for a COVID-19 antibody test and expects production to hit high double-digit millions by June and 100mln later in the year. Finally, Royal Mail (+6.2%) is buoyed by reports that Czech billionaire Kretinsky reportedly bought a 5.35% stake in the Co., sparking speculation he could launch a takeover bid.</p><p><strong>Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) – </strong>Q1 revenue USD 61.3bln.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The Greenback is back on a firmer footing after succumbing to somewhat more than the usual month end selling and remaining under pressure on Friday when US President Trump upped the ante against China via recriminations over the source of COVID-19 and the threat of retaliation. However, risk aversion has spread to the extent that the Buck has resumed a degree of safe-haven premium vs currency counterparts bar the Yen, with the DXY retaining a firmer grasp of the 99.000 handle within a 99.239-477 range.</p><p><strong>JPY -</strong> As noted above, the Yen is resisting the broad trend of underperformance relative to the recovering Dollar, albeit in holiday-thinned trade due to Japan’s Greenery Day amidst the longer Golden Week vacation, as Usd/Jpy meanders in a tight band below 107.00.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF/NZD/CAD/AUD -</strong> Sterling has lost more of its seasonal bid, as the sell in May trend looks set to continue for a second day with Cable teetering above 1.2400 and Eur/Gbp testing resistance/psychological offers around 0.8800 ahead of the 50 DMA (0.8825) even though the Euro is struggling to keep hold of the 1.0900 handle vs the Greenback in wake of weak Eurozone manufacturing PMIs, ECB SPF downgrades and a worse than forecast Sentix survey. Technically, Eur/Usd is currently close to a Fib retracement at 1.0938 and supported ahead of the big figure that also coincides with the 30 DMA. Elsewhere, the Franc remains well shy of recent highs near 0.9600 circa 0.9650, but on the rebound in Eur/Chf cross terms around 1.0550 following mixed Swiss inputs from yet another big rise in bank sight deposits and better than expected, albeit still sub-50 manufacturing PMI. Meanwhile, the Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie are all nursing losses after conceding ground to their US rival with Nzd/Usd hovering just under 0.6050, Aud/Usd straddling 0.6400 and Usd/Cad pivoting 1.4100 amidst renewed declines in oil prices. The Kiwi has not gleaned much from S&amp;P reaffirming NZ’s AA rating and positive outlook or more moves towards lifting lockdown, awaiting Q1 jobs data, while the Aussie appears hesitant ahead of the RBA, retail sales and the SOMP.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM -</strong> The aforementioned downturn in crude is weighing on the Norwegian Crown alongside the ongoing PMI manufacturing contraction, though not as pronounced as in Sweden where the Krona is also unwinding more post-Riksbank gains. However, the Rand has derived some comfort from SA’s PMI beating consensus and deflecting attention away from bleak economic projections out of the Treasury Director, while the Lira is trying to pare losses off another multi-month low on the back of firmer than anticipated Turkish CPI in contrast to a deeper sub-50 manufacturing PMI.</p><p>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/USD: <strong>1.0865-70 (1BLN), </strong>1.0900 (340M), <strong>1.0955 (1BLN),</strong> 1.1010-15 (400M)</p><p>New Zealand PM Ardern will join Australia Cabinet meeting tomorrow and she was said to have discussed with PM Morrison the reopening of trans-Tasman travel, as well as easing restrictions on economies. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>S&amp;P affirmed New Zealand at AA</strong>; Outlook Positive, while it stated the positive outlook reflects strong fundamentals and that fiscal profile should strengthen after coronavirus outbreak subsides. Furthermore, it believes New Zealand’s economy is in recession and forecasts a 2.4% contraction in the economy in fiscal 2020 but then growing 1.7% fiscal 2021 and 4.4% in fiscal 2022. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> have maintained their outperformance vs Pound underperformance in FX, and extended gains to match last Friday’s Liffe intraday high to the tick, at 137.86 before drifting back again so close to reaching the April 30 apex that looks increasingly stubborn ahead of 138.00 and circa 20 bp in cash yield terms. However, <strong>Bunds</strong> delved a tad deeper below 174.00 to 173.92 before finding underlying bids, and a couple of bearish bank strategies post-April’s ECB policy meeting could be keeping a lid on the 10 year German benchmark along with a broader unwinding of the month end bid.

US equity futures also post losses of ~1%, with the contracts pressured by a potential rollback in the US-China Phase One trade deal should China not adhere to purchases. UK’s FTSE 100 (-0.2%) index outperforms the region having had its Friday session whilst some downside could be cushioned by a softer Sterling. Sectors are lower across the board – with IT and Consumer Discretionary the laggards, albeit most of this overall downside would be on account of a chunk of Europe catching up to Friday’s trade. In terms of individual movers, BT (-1.4%) opened softer (but nursed some losses) amid reports Telefonica (+3.4%) is said to be in discussions with Liberty Global to combine their UK assets, O2 and Virgin Media, in a joint venture to challenge BT and Sky in the UK – Telefonica states that the Cos are in a negotiating phase and the group is currently not able to guarantee either the terms or probability of its success. Sources added that Liberty Global also reportedly approached Vodafone (-1.1%) regarding a merger, but talks are not currently active. Meanwhile, Fincantieri (+15.8%) was halted limit up after receiving a US Navy contract valued at USD 5.5bln. SocGen (-6.2%) shares see extra pressure as it expects to have provisions of EUR 3.5-5bln this year amid losses caused by the pandemic. CEO also sees CET1 ratio to drop to between 11-15%. Similarly, Thyssenkrupp (-14.5%) plumbs the depths as the Co. anticipates a cash-squeeze despite the lift unit sale. Elsewhere, Roche (+0.3%) remains resilient to the losses in the region after the group was awarded emergency approval in the US for a COVID-19 antibody test and expects production to hit high double-digit millions by June and 100mln later in the year. Finally, Royal Mail (+6.2%) is buoyed by reports that Czech billionaire Kretinsky reportedly bought a 5.35% stake in the Co., sparking speculation he could launch a takeover bid.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>USD - The Greenback is back on a firmer footing after succumbing to somewhat more than the usual month end selling and remaining under pressure on Friday when US President Trump upped the ante against China via recriminations over the source of COVID-19 and the threat of retaliation. However, risk aversion has spread to the extent that the Buck has resumed a degree of safe-haven premium vs currency counterparts bar the Yen, with the DXY retaining a firmer grasp of the 99.000 handle within a 99.239-477 range.</p><p>JPY - As noted above, the Yen is resisting the broad trend of underperformance relative to the recovering Dollar, albeit in holiday-thinned trade due to Japan’s Greenery Day amidst the longer Golden Week vacation, as Usd/Jpy meanders in a tight band below 107.00.</p><p>GBP/EUR/CHF/NZD/CAD/AUD - Sterling has lost more of its seasonal bid, as the sell in May trend looks set to continue for a second day with Cable teetering above 1.2400 and Eur/Gbp testing resistance/psychological offers around 0.8800 ahead of the 50 DMA (0.8825) even though the Euro is struggling to keep hold of the 1.0900 handle vs the Greenback in wake of weak Eurozone manufacturing PMIs, ECB SPF downgrades and a worse than forecast Sentix survey. Technically, Eur/Usd is currently close to a Fib retracement at 1.0938 and supported ahead of the big figure that also coincides with the 30 DMA. Elsewhere, the Franc remains well shy of recent highs near 0.9600 circa 0.9650, but on the rebound in Eur/Chf cross terms around 1.0550 following mixed Swiss inputs from yet another big rise in bank sight deposits and better than expected, albeit still sub-50 manufacturing PMI. Meanwhile, the Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie are all nursing losses after conceding ground to their US rival with Nzd/Usd hovering just under 0.6050, Aud/Usd straddling 0.6400 and Usd/Cad pivoting 1.4100 amidst renewed declines in oil prices. The Kiwi has not gleaned much from S&amp;P reaffirming NZ’s AA rating and positive outlook or more moves towards lifting lockdown, awaiting Q1 jobs data, while the Aussie appears hesitant ahead of the RBA, retail sales and the SOMP.</p><p>SCANDI/EM - The aforementioned downturn in crude is weighing on the Norwegian Crown alongside the ongoing PMI manufacturing contraction, though not as pronounced as in Sweden where the Krona is also unwinding more post-Riksbank gains. However, the Rand has derived some comfort from SA’s PMI beating consensus and deflecting attention away from bleak economic projections out of the Treasury Director, while the Lira is trying to pare losses off another multi-month low on the back of firmer than anticipated Turkish CPI in contrast to a deeper sub-50 manufacturing PMI.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> have maintained their outperformance vs Pound underperformance in FX, and extended gains to match last Friday’s Liffe intraday high to the tick, at 137.86 before drifting back again so close to reaching the April 30 apex that looks increasingly stubborn ahead of 138.00 and circa 20 bp in cash yield terms. However, Bunds delved a tad deeper below 174.00 to 173.92 before finding underlying bids, and a couple of bearish bank strategies post-April’s ECB policy meeting could be keeping a lid on the 10 year <strong>German</strong> <strong>benchmark</strong> along with a broader unwinding of the month end bid.

ASX 200 (+1.2%) was choppy with notable weakness in energy as crude prices resumed the rout brought on by oversupply concerns and with banking names initially pressured after Westpac reported a 62% drop in H1 net, although the big 4 bank eventually reversed its losses which helped the turnaround in the largest weighted financials sector and the index as a whole.

Furthermore, <strong>President Trump said tariffs would be the ultimate punishment on China and warned that that if China doesn't buy US goods, the US will end the trade deal</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump said the FDA approved Gilead's (GILD) Remdesivir for emergency use authorization and that the Co. is donating 1mln vials of the drug</strong>, while VP Pence said the 1mln vials of remdesivir will start being distributed to hospitals on Monday. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump said he is not doing stimulus without a payroll tax cut</strong>, although there were previous comments from White House Press Secretary McEnany that US wants to negotiate the next stimulus bill immediately, while other reports noted that senior sources in the US Republican Senate Conference want to wait before approving another coronavirus stimulus package. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US Secretary of State Pompeo stated that there is enormous evidence that the coronavirus outbreak originated in a laboratory in Wuhan</strong> although he didn’t provide evidence to support the claims, while he accused China of stonewalling investigations and refusing to co-operate with experts. (Newswires/BBC) New US intelligence analysis claimed that China intentionally concealed severity of coronavirus pandemic to stock up on critical medical supplies needed to combat the outbreak. (AP)</p><p>New Jersey Governor Murphy said he will announce a plan for school reopenings on Monday. Elsewhere, New York City Mayor De Blasio commented that reopening the city is \"obviously a few months away at the minimum\", while the Washington State Governor extended the stay at home order to May 31st. (Newswires)</p><p>US CDC reported total coronavirus cases as of previous day at 1600EDT increased to 1,133,486 (Prev. 1,092,815), while total death toll was at 65,735 (Prev. 64,283). (Newswires)</p><p><strong>UK is looking to relax the lockdown measures beginning May 26th according to The Sun (other reports have suggested the plan could be unveiled as soon as Thursday)</strong>, while it was also reported that PM Johnson’s plan will include workplace proposals such as staggered shifts, curtailing hot desking and face-to-face meetings, while staff canteens will remain shut and lifts kept half empty. (The Sun/FT) UK Cabinet Minister Gove commented that a staged easing of the lockdown would mean restrictions could be imposed to tackle localized outbreaks and also stated that the UK will be piloting a new test, as well as trace and track procedures in the Isle of Wight. (Newswires)</p><p>UK coronavirus death toll rose by 315 to 28,446 vs. Prev. increase of 621 deaths, while France’s death toll rose by 135 to 24,895 vs. Prev. increase of 166 deaths and Italy’s death toll rose by 174 to 28,884 vs. Prev. increase of 474 to represent its lowest daily death toll since the lockdown began on March 9th. (Newswires)</p><p>India extended its nationwide lockdown from May 4th for two weeks but will permit \"considerable relaxations\" in districts marked as Green and Orange Zones. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>ASIA</strong></p><p><strong>Asian equity markets began the week mostly lower amid several holiday closures in the region and cautiousness ahead of this week’s risk events, with sentiment also dragged by a flare up at the inter-Korean border and as US-China trade tensions simmered</strong> with President Trump stating that tariffs would be the ultimate punishment for China and warned to end the trade deal if China doesn't buy US goods. <strong>ASX 200 (+1.2%) </strong>was choppy with notable weakness in energy as crude prices resumed the rout brought on by oversupply concerns and with banking names initially pressured after Westpac reported a 62% drop in H1 net, although the big 4 bank eventually reversed its losses which helped the turnaround in the largest weighted financials sector and the index as a whole. <strong>KOSPI (-1.9%)</strong> gapped lower by over 2% at the open on geopolitical concerns after South Korea and North Korea exchanged gunfire at the demilitarized zone for the first time since 2014 which comes a day after North Korea Leader Kim made his first public appearance since rumours circulated that he may have died or was incapacitated, although the index is off its lows as reports also noted there were no casualties from the incident which could have been accidental. <strong>Hang Seng&nbsp; (-4.2%)</strong> slumped as it played catch up from the extended weekend and ahead of today’s GDP which could show the largest contraction on record with Financial Services Secretary Chan suggesting GDP data could be worse than the GFC and Asian Financial Crisis which saw economic contractions of 7.8% and 8.3% respectively. The lack of participants added to the uninspired mood for Hong Kong and the region, with markets in mainland China to reopen on Wednesday due to Labor Day holidays and with Japanese participants returning on Thursday after Golden Week. Finally, Indian markets were the worst performers with the <strong>NIFTY</strong> and <strong>SENSEX</strong> both collapsing by as much as 5% after the government extended the nationwide lockdown for two weeks but will permit \"considerable relaxations\" in certain districts.</p><p>Hong Kong civil servants began to gradually return to work from today and it was also reported that Hong Kong is to raise the limit on public gatherings to 8 people from 4, while it may open gyms and cinemas this week. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p><strong>UK is to start trade talks with the US in the upcoming week. The first round of negotiations will last for two weeks with future discussions taking place every six weeks</strong>. (FT)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> was firmer as it benefitted from safe-haven bid to extend above the 99.00 level after US President Trump’s tariff warning and continued finger-pointing by the administration on China regarding the origins of the coronavirus outbreak in which Secretary of State Pompeo reiterated Trump’s view that there is enormous evidence the coronavirus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, while he also accused China of stonewalling investigations and refusing to co-operate with experts. As such, <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> weakened below 1.0950 and 1.2450 respectively but with losses somewhat cushioned after the daily death tolls on both sides of the Channel dropped with Italy also reporting the lowest number of deaths since the beginning of its lockdown. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were hampered by the subdued risk tone and absence of Japanese participants, while antipodeans suffered due to their high-beta statuses with the retreat in <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> below the 0.6400 handle also the impact of early weakness in CNH after President Trump’s tough rhetoric on China.</p><p>New Zealand PM Ardern will join Australia Cabinet meeting tomorrow and she was said to have discussed with PM Morrison the reopening of trans-Tasman travel, as well as easing restrictions on economies. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>S&amp;P affirmed New Zealand at AA</strong>; Outlook Positive, while it stated the positive outlook reflects strong fundamentals and that fiscal profile should strengthen after coronavirus outbreak subsides. Furthermore, it believes New Zealand’s economy is in recession and forecasts a 2.4% contraction in the economy in fiscal 2020 but then growing 1.7% fiscal 2021 and 4.4% in fiscal 2022. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Commodities were mostly softer with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures June contract declining below the USD 19.00/bbl level amid the risk averse tone and a resumption of the selling pressure triggered by oversupply concerns, while there were also comments from the Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Christian who dismissed the notion of voting to reduce output ahead of this week’s meeting. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were steady with price action contained by resistance at the USD 1700/oz level and amid a firmer greenback, while the lacklustre sentiment and key holiday closures kept sapped demand for copper overnight.</p><p>Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Christian said the state will not be reducing output and noted that he and Commissioner Craddick oppose proration, while he thinks the issue is settled and is disturbed seeing it viewed as a big question heading into the commission meeting this week. (Energy Intel)</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p><strong>North Korean leader Kim visited a factory in his first public appearance in 20 days which follows conflicting reports that suggested he may have died or was incapacitated</strong>. In related news, North Korea and South Korea exchanged shots at the demilitarized zone, although there were no reported injuries and US Secretary of State Pompeo suggested the gunfire exchange was probably accidental. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX lacked direction on Friday amid light news flow and month-end passing. On the supply front, corporate issuance cooled to end the week following the Boeing jumbo USD 25bln deal on Thursday, although investors may be cautious about bidding rates lower ahead of next week’s Treasury refunding announcement (May 6th), where the Treasury will explain how it plans to funds its ballooning deficit (it will likely launch the much touted 20-year Bond); furthermore, with corporates emerging from the other side of earnings, companies will be likely to flood the pipeline with debt offerings as many look to pay off short term credit facilities that have been maxed out amid the economy standstill. Elsewhere, the NY Fed announced it would be tapering its Treasury purchases to USD 8bln per day for next week from this week’s USD 10bln – note that the pace of the tapering has been declining in recent weeks, where last week it cut to USD 10bln from USD 15bln per day. By settlement, yields were little changed, 2s +1bps at 0.20%, 10s +1bps at 0.63%, and 30s unchanged at 1.27%. US T-note futures (M0) settled 6 ticks lower at 138-28.</p><p><strong>NY Fed cut Treasuries/TIPS purchases to USD 8bln per day for the upcoming week (Prev. USD 10bln)</strong></p><p>Fed's Bullard (non-voter, dove) sees an eventual need for a \"far more granular, far more risk-based\" approach to reopening the economy and suggested if the crisis extends for too long there is a risk that the economy won't recover swiftly. Bullard added the Fed has made commitments to remain at low rates until the economy gets on a better footing, while he added that as long as the shock is temporary, the economy could recover in H2 this year and he thinks inflation could be maintained not too far from the 2% target. (WSJ)</p><p>NYSE is to hold a meeting with the floor community on Tuesday and officials may address a timetable for reopening, while they are said to be unlikely to set a firm date but could provide guidance, according to FBN's Gasparino.

        "analysis_details": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week subdued amid several holiday closures in the region and cautiousness ahead of this week’s risk events, with sentiment also dragged by a flare up at the inter-Korean border and as US-China trade tensions simmer with US President Trump stating that tariffs would be the ultimate punishment for China and warned to end the trade deal if China doesn't buy US goods. ASX 200 (+0.9%) is choppy with notable weakness in energy as crude prices resume the rout brought on by oversupply concerns and with banking names initially subdued after Westpac reported a 62% drop in H1 net, although the big 4 bank has reversed its losses and helped the turnaround in the largest weighted financials sector. KOSPI (-1.7%) gapped lower by over 2% at the open on geopolitical concerns after South Korea and North Korea exchanged gunfire at the demilitarized zone for the first time since 2014 which comes a day after North Korea Leader Kim made his first public appearance since rumours circulated that he may have died or was incapacitated, although the index is off its lows as reports also noted there were no casualties from the incident which could have been accidental. Hang Seng (-3.7%) is the worst performer as it plays catch up from the extended weekend and ahead of today’s GDP which could show the largest contraction on record with Financial Services Secretary Chan suggesting GDP data could be worse than the GFC and Asian Financial Crisis which saw economic contractions of 7.8% and 8.3% respectively. In addition, the lack of participants adds to the uninspiring mood for Hong Kong and the region, with markets in mainland China to reopen on Wednesday due to Labor Day holidays and with Japanese participants returning on Thursday after Golden Week.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is firmer as it gets a safe haven bid from the risk averse tone to extend above the 99.00 level after US President Trump’s tariff warning and continued finger-pointing by the administration on China regarding the origins of the coronavirus outbreak with Secretary of State Pompeo reiterating Trump’s view that there is enormous evidence that the coronavirus outbreak originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, while Pompeo also accused China of stonewalling investigations and refusing to co-operate with experts. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD are weaker although downside is stemmed by support near 1.0950 and 1.2450 respectively and as the daily death tolls on both sides of the Channel drop with Italy also reporting the lowest number of deaths since the beginning of its lockdown. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are subdued by safe haven flows and absence of Japanese participants, while antipodeans suffer due to their high-beta statuses with AUD/USD slipping below the 0.6400 handle amid initial weakness in CNH after President Trump’s tough rhetoric on China.</p>",
