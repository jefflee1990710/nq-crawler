On the former, the Fed chair revealed little in the way of reads we could use ahead of the June FOMC, reiterating negative rates was not appropriate at the moment; with an aggressive reading one might argue that his remarks were consistent with a future YCC tool. Markets traded choppy ahead of President Trump’s remarks, however, much of the meat was leaked in advance via sources, and all the measures were generally ones that markets had digested with ease over the last couple of weeks. While Trump had more spikey rhetoric, there was no ‘nuclear’ action that the President announced (for instance, sanctions against key China officials, any immediate disruption of capital flows, any immediate delisting of Chinese companies, and there was nothing that threatened Hong Kong’s access to dollars). According, equities saw a relief rally into the final part of trade, and there was some modest selling in Treasuries.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>CHINA PRESS CONFERENCE: </strong>US President Trump announced he has stripped Hong Kong of its special status, adding he will take steps to sanction Hong Kong and PRC officials involved in eroding the autonomy of Hong Kong from China. Trump also noted that foreign nationals from China who are identified as possible security risks will have entry suspended; there will also be visa restrictions applying to Chinese students and researchers with ties to the PLA. Elsewhere in the press conference, US President Trump announced he is terminating the relationship between the US and the WHO, he once again accused China of covering up the “wuhan virus”, stated they unlawfully broke their word to ensure the autonomy of Hong Kong and that China unlawfully claimed territory in the pacific ocean. On US listed Chinese companies (BABA, NTES, JD, BABA), a working group will be studying the differing practices of those companies. (Note, the Senate’s recent bill calls for more accountability over a three-year period before US authorities were to take any delisting action). Following that bill, JD and NTES filed for secondary listings in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, sources noted Baidu (BIDU) is considering de-listing to boost its valuation. BABA announced they are \"keeping a close eye\" on the bill. Overall, the announcements refrained from any of the hawkish options (such as sanctions on key administration individuals or entities, or any changes to the Phase One trade agreement, booting HK out of the dollar system). The question remains how Beijing will respond. Scenarios include: reducing trade deal commitments and purchase targets; updating its so-called \"unreliable entities list\" aimed at punishing firms deemed harmful to Chinese interests (AAPL, BA, CSCO, QCOM); some speculate China might dump US assets, although this would be a severe option with potentially self-harming consequences.</p><p><strong>KUDLOW:</strong> NEC Director Kudlow reiterated that the US is furious with China; on stimulus measures, he suggested that the White House wants to give Americans a back to work bonus, perhaps to incentivise going back to work rather than another stimulus cheque. Some analysts have suggested that this may be a good way of convincing hawkish GOP members since the stimulus would be enticing people to return to work, rather than avoid working since the stimulus checks potentially exceed a person’s take home pay.</p><h2><strong>DATA</strong></h2><p><strong>CHICAGO PMI (MAY): </strong>The headline fell to the lowest since March 1982, at 32.3 from 35.4, missing estimates for a rise to 40.0 – the fall is an outlier compared to other regional surveys which saw a bounce in May, although still remained depressed. Pantheon Macroeconomics writes that the expected pick up to 40.0 “always looked a bit ambitious” despite the gains in other surveys. New orders fell by 2.3 points while production fell 6.3 points, continuing on April’s decline and remains at 40-year lows. Order Backlogs fell 28 points to the lowest since March 2009 and is the ninth consecutive sub 50 print. Inventories rose by 4.1 points to an 11-month high. Employment rebounded from the steep declines last month although the report notes “anecdotal evidence was mixed with some firms stating they had to lay off staff or reduce salaries, while others were trying to find new hires”. Note, supplier deliveries ticked down by 5.8 points after a 46-year high in April; the supplier deliveries index has recently been increasing due to supply chain problems rather than too much demand which had been buoying some of the recent headline PMI prints. Pantheon Macroeconomics highlight the Chicago PMI index is vulnerable to Boeing (BA) woes, which was already in “deep trouble” before COVID-19 due to the 737 MAX. The consultancy writes “we’re still inclined to look next week for a modest increase in the national ISM manufacturing index, though a full recovery in the sector will take many months, at least.”</p><p><strong>PERSONAL INCOME SPENDING &amp; PCE (APRIL): </strong>Personal income in April rose 10.5%, much higher than the expected -6.5% and up from March’s -2.2%. The surge in income was due to the 91.1% record rise in the benefits payment due to the mass stimulus checks handed out. Meanwhile, wages and salaries fell 8%, and proprietors income fell 12%. Spending however fell 13.6%, deeper than the expected -12.6%, and deeper than the prior -7.5%. Oxford Economics highlights the decline was the largest on record with spending on autos, clothing, healthcare, recreation, and food services and accommodation seeing historical falls given the lockdown measures across the country. The consultancy also points out the jump in the savings rate to 33% from 12.7%, a record high, which shows how the pandemic is leading to more frugal consumer behaviour which will dampen the recovery while the benefits payments will decline leaving households more financially constrained. Headline PCE declined by 0.5% M/M, a quicker pace than the prior -0.2% while the Y/Y cooled to a 0.5% pace from 1.3% previously. Core PCE saw deeper deflation than expected, falling 0.4% M/M (exp. -0.3%, prev. -0.1%), while the Core Y/Y metric slowed to 1.0% from 1.7% (exp. 1.1%). Oxford Economics write “Looking ahead, the severe demand shock, the collapse of oil prices and the stronger dollar will lead to deflation for headline PCE and the weakest core PCE inflation on record, below 0.5%.”</p><h2><strong>FEDERAL RESERVE</strong></h2><p><strong>POWELL: </strong>Fed Chair Powell provided little new information today, reiterating the Fed is strongly committed to using its tools while he acknowledged the Fed crossed “red lines” but noted it was appropriate to do so given the circumstances. On NIRP, he reiterated that negative rates are not an appropriate tool, noting evidence on whether they work or not is mixed and that typically US infrastructure, such as money market funds, are largely incompatible with negative rates. Powell stated that the balance sheet could not go to infinity, while risks to inflation were to the downside. On its Main Street Facility programme, he announced the Fed is “days away” from making the first loans in the facility and that he could imagine expanding it, but he said it is challenging trying to figure out the appropriate credit products. Note, the Fed enters blackout period tonight before its June meeting.</p><p><strong>MESTER: </strong>Fed’s Mester (voter) viewed Yield Curve Control (YCC) as a support for forward guidance should it be adopted, although she noted if it was implemented it would need to think carefully about how to manage the implementation and exit. Mester also believes that YCC is not for this phase of action where the Fed is providing support for market functioning. Note, Mester seems to be in fitting with Clarida and Williams that YCC should complement forward guidance, although she did suggest it is not for this phase of action. Elsewhere on the matter, Bullard (non-voter) recently expressed opposition to YCC, doubting it would have much impact and that he favoured economy based forward guidance.</p><h2><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (U0) SETTLES 13 TICKS HIGHER AT 139-02</strong></p><p>The TPLEX caught a bid to end the week amid month-end flows and tentative risk appetite ahead of Trump announcements and the weekend. By settlement, the curve had flattened, with yields lower between 1-4bps across the curve. Real money was reported to have been behind the bid amid duration extension due to portfolio rebalancing, at the same time fast money/spec accounts were said to be sellers, keeping pressure on yields. However, the selling pressure abated into the latter part of the session seeing the curve bull flatten further. Additionally, the bid was supported further due Treasury supply out the way, as well as little corporate issuance on the radar today. The NY Fed announced its week ahead Treasury/TIPS purchases too, where the total weekly purchases will rise to USD 22.5bln (prev. 20bln), while owing to this week’s market holiday on Monday, next week’s daily purchases will fall to USD 4.5bln from 5bln. Meanwhile, the Fed released data on its SMCCF, where as of Thursday, it held USD 1.177bln across corporate bonds. The Fed also released ETF holding breakdowns, albeit only up till May 19th, where its largest holdings in corporate bond ETFs appeared most correlated to those with the largest AUM, with the IG Corp ETF LQD being the largest holding, followed by LQD, VCIT, DCSH, and HYG (the largest US corporate HY ETF).</p><p><strong>NY FED PURCHASES: </strong>The NY Fed raised its weekly Treasuries/TIPS purchases to USD 22.5bln (prev. 20bln), cuts daily purchases to USD 4.5bln for next week (prev.

The lows were made in European trade, from which prices grinded higher. The moves were seemingly uncorrelated to wider risk appetite, as equity futures moved lower as crude reversed losses, and supply updates didn’t see any spikey behaviour in the tape action. Analysts at Citi noted that prices are consolidating in recent trading ranges due to “some degree of uncertainty over just what has, and has not been already factored into the price.” On the supply side, Russia's Rosneft reportedly told the Russian Energy Ministry that it would be hard to maintain oil output cuts to the end of the year as it does not have enough crude to ship to customers as part of long-term supply deals. Note that reports yesterday alluded to Russian companies hesitant to extend current curtailments past the agreed-upon end-June, stating that markets would be balanced by June/July; comes ahead of the JMMC/OPEC/OPEC+ meetings on June 8th, 9th and 10th respectively. In the US, the latest weekly Baker Hughes rig count showed oil rigs down 15 at 222, natgas down 2 at 77 and total rigs down 17 at 301. Regarding oil rigs, the cut this week was slightly less pronounced than prior weeks (weekly oil rig changes in reverse chronological order: -21, -34, -36, -53, -60, -66, -62…), perhaps indicating the approaching of a near-term bottoming-out of voluntary US production cuts.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.5% at 3,044, NDX +1.5% at 9,556, DJI -0.1% at 25,383</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Communications +4.2%, Health Care +1.3%, Technology +1.2%, Utilities +0.8%, Discretionary +0.7%, Staples +0.2%, Materials +0.1%, Energy -0.15%, Industrials -0.6%, Real Estate -0.8%, Financials -1.2%.</p><p><strong>EUROPE CLOSES:</strong> EURO STOXX 50 (-1.4%) at 3050, FTSE 100 (-2.3%) at 6077, DAX (-1.65%) at 11,5887, CAC 40 (-1.6%) at 4695, IBEX 35 (-1.8%) at 7097, FTSE MIB (-0.8%) at 18,197, SMI (-1.1%) at 9822</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Occidental Petroleum (OXY) cut its dividend further to 0.01/shr from USD 0.11/shr. Twitter (TWTR) placed a public interest notice on Trump’s tweets noting it violates policies. FBN reported that Alphabet Google (GOOG) competitors are being interviewed by the DOJ as it weighs an antitrust case on the tech giant. General Motors (GM) announced the restart of production across its North America assembly plants has gone smoothly and is now in a position to increase production to meet rising demand. ViacomCBS (VIAC) is reportedly going to lay off up to 400 employees across CBS as part of its plan to save USD 750mln from its merger with CBS, according to sources. JD.com (JD) and NetEase (NTES) received approval from Hong Kong for its secondary listings that could raise billions of dollars, according to sources. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR), and ViacomCBS (VIAC) are to collaborate in JV Blockgraph to make TV commercials more targeted, according to WSJ. Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) release positive Phase III trial results. Cisco (CSCO) confirmed it plans to acquire ThousandEyes, an internet Cloud intelligence platform.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Costco (COST) missed on EPS and revenue. Salesforce (CRM) top and bottom-line results were in line with estimates, although it cut its FY guidance beneath analyst expectations. Nordstrom (JWN) missed on EPS and revenue, noted 40% of its stores are now open. Zscaler (ZS) beat on EPS, revenue was inline while guidance was solid. Dell Technologies (DELL) beat on EPS and revenue but it has suspended its share repurchase programme and expects Q2 revenue to be seasonally lower than other years. VM Ware (VMW) beat on EPS and revenue while its subscription and SaaS revenue was +39% to USD 572mln.</p><h2><strong>WEEKLY FX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>DIRE DOLLAR, EUPHORIC EURO, YIELDING YUAN</strong></p><p><strong>DXY: </strong>A detrimental week of back-to-back losses in the broader Dollar and Index as DXY tumbled from an early-week high of 99.979 to a current low-print at 97.944, taking out a string of moving averages along the way including the 100 DMA (99.789), 21 DMA ( 99.574), 100 DMA (99.037) 21 WMA (98.954) and 50 DMA (98.505) and 50 WMA (98.260). Month-end flows heavily contributed to the downside as some models pointed to modest USD selling. On the data front, the DXY was initially unfazed by a revision lower to Q1 GDP and larger than forecast jobless claim figures. Nonetheless, jitters also surrounded the China situation as tensions between the two largest nations mount on all fronts. Focus almost solely remains on US President Trump’s China presser later (time TBC) whilst Fed Chair Powell is expected to stick to the script at 1600BST as the Fed’s blackout period commences from 30th May.</p><p><strong>YUAN: </strong>The Yuan has of course been a key theme against the backdrop of heightened tensions with the US and social pressure from Hong Kong. The highlight of the Annual NPC turned out to be the almost-unanimous vote in favour of the controversial National Security Bill, passed into Hong Kong’s Basic Law – triggering social unrest in the region and prompting the US to reassess Hong Kong’s autonomy to China, thus opening the door to tariffs/restrictions against both Hong Kong and Beijing. As mentioned above, traders are keeping an eagle eye on Trump’s announcement, with WSJ citing sources noting of an announcement that the US will be cancelling visas of some Chinese students with links to the PLA – while China vowed countermeasures and retaliation. USD/CNH continued grinding higher throughout the week alongside the daily PBoC fixings – the pair looks to the EU week around the middle of a 7.1343-1963 band after threatening fresh record highs and revisiting levels last seen at the height of the US-Sino tensions last year.</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP: </strong>Both set to end the week in the firmer territory, albeit the Single Currency outpaces its neighbour over the channel amid month-end EUR flows ahead of the FX fix. The week saw the European Commission propose a EUR 750bln Recovery Fund comprising of 2/3 grants and the rest loans in a bid to find common ground among Northern and southern Europe. However, the proposal was met with some pessimism and will be subject to further negotiations either at the Eurogroup meeting (11 Jun) or EU Summit (19 June) – Chancellor Merkel does not expect unity on the fund before Summer. Elsewhere on the Central Bank front, ECB’s Villeroy provided the Single Currency with early-week pressure after alluding to a longer period of negative rates and posited possible further measures – ahead of the June 4th meeting – whilst President Lagarde did little to dent the EUR but posited that the ECB’s mild GDP scenario of -5% is outdated – with the metric likely in the range of the medium (-8%) to severe (-12%) scenarios. EUR/USD is poised to end the EU week north of 1.1100 having printed a weekly base at 1.0869 and currency high around 1.1140, topping its 50 DMA (1.0896), 21WMA/100DMA (1.0957) and 50 WMA (1.1051) and 200 DMA (1.1010) along the way. Meanwhile, the UK headlines were dominated by new of PM Johnson’s Chief advisor Cummings, albeit overall had minimal impact on Sterling – instead, Brexit newsflow regains focus with little progress in talks despite earlier reports that EU is preparing to drop its \"maximalist\" approach to negotiations on fisheries with Britain in the next round of negotiations. Cable heads to the end of the EU week with gains – more so on USD action – having notched a weekly 1.2162-1.2367 weekly band. EUR/GBP meanwhile reclaimed 0.9000 to the upside after printing a base a 0.8879 earlier in the week.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF: </strong>The JPY set to end the European week on a modestly firmer footing whilst CHF lagged amid a broader risk rally throughout the week and amid potential SNB presence. Japan announced a fiscal package which brings to total to 43% of its GDP whilst PM Abe also recently announced an end to the state of emergency at its largest cities. USD/JPY fluctuating within last week’s range is looking to end the session just under 107.50 – having clocked in a 107.06-107.94 intraweek range. The Franc meanwhile deviated from the Yen action at the start of the week, with some touting potential SNB action, whilst President Jordan reaffirmed the Central Bank’s stance on intervention and the negative rates ahead June 18th quarterly policy meeting. EUR/CHF looks to end the EU week above its 21WMA (1.0612) closer to its weekly high at 1.0726.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>A week of gains for the high-beta FX, again more so on the aggressive USD pullback – however, the currencies were influenced by escalations/heightened tensions on the US-Sino front (oil for the CAD) at different point throughout the week. The pairs were swayed amid reports that two Chinese re pushing ahead with share sales in Hong Kong given US pressure for Chinese companies to disclose the information if not delist – which at the time hit sentiment, whilst Aussie saw separate pressure amid reports China could take aim at Aussie coal exports. Nonetheless, the continued deterioration of the Dollar throughout the week sees the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie set for a positive weekly EU close with AUD/USD just under its 50 WMA at 0.6700 vs. a weekly low of 0.6515 – with the currency looking ahead to the RBA meeting next week after Governor Lowe continued to push-back on the likelihood of a negative Cash Rate earlier this week. The Kiwi reclaimed 0.6200 from a base of 0.6080, topping its 100DMA and 21 WMA (0.6200-07) along the way. The Loonie meanwhile ultimately side-lined overall better-than forecast GDP numbers as USD influence prevailed. USD/CAD looks to end the EU week in the red and towards the bottom of its 1.3710-1.4010 weekly band having dipped below its 100 DMA at 1.3716.</p><p><strong>EM: </strong>EM FX has largely been moving in tandem with risk, albeit the BRL deserves a mention after USD/BRL tumbled from 5.5300 to a low of 5.2682 before recoiling back up to 5.43-levels with some pointing to BCB intervention after the Central Bank president reaffirmed the bank’s readiness to dip into reserves against the backdrop of rising coronavirus cases and political scandals threatening the currency.</p>",

By settlement, the curve had flattened, with yields lower between 1-4bps across the curve. Real money was reported to have been behind the bid amid duration extension due to portfolio rebalancing, at the same time fast money/spec accounts were said to be sellers, keeping pressure on yields. However, the selling pressure abated into the latter part of the session seeing the curve bull flatten further. Additionally, the bid was supported further due Treasury supply out the way, as well as little corporate issuance on the radar today. The NY Fed announced its week ahead Treasury/TIPS purchases too, where the total weekly purchases will rise to USD 22.5bln (prev. 20bln), while owing to this week’s market holiday on Monday, next week’s daily purchases will fall to USD 4.5bln from 5bln. Meanwhile, the Fed released data on its SMCCF, where as of Thursday, it held USD 1.177bln across corporate bonds. The Fed also released ETF holding breakdowns, albeit only up till May 19th, where its largest holdings in corporate bond ETFs appeared most correlated to those with the largest AUM, with the IG Corp ETF LQD being the largest holding, followed by LQD, VCIT, DCSH, and HYG (the largest US corporate HY ETF).</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Oil futures traded lower on Friday, albeit off the lows, ending marginally firmer on the week, marking the fifth consecutive weeks of gains. The lows were made in European trade, from which prices grinded higher. The moves were seemingly uncorrelated to wider risk appetite, as equity futures moved lower as crude reversed losses, and supply updates didn’t see any spikey behaviour in the tape action. Analysts at Citi noted that prices are consolidating in recent trading ranges due to “some degree of uncertainty over just what has, and has not been already factored into the price.” On the supply side, Russia's Rosneft reportedly told the Russian Energy Ministry that it would be hard to maintain oil output cuts to the end of the year as it does not have enough crude to ship to customers as part of long-term supply deals. Note that reports yesterday alluded to Russian companies hesitant to extend current curtailments past the agreed-upon end-June, stating that markets would be balanced by June/July; comes ahead of the JMMC/OPEC/OPEC+ meetings on June 8th, 9th and 10th respectively. In the US, the latest weekly Baker Hughes rig count showed oil rigs down 15 at 222, natgas down 2 at 77 and total rigs down 17 at 301. Regarding oil rigs, the cut this week was slightly less pronounced than prior weeks (weekly oil rig changes in reverse chronological order: -21, -34, -36, -53, -60, -66, -62…), perhaps indicating the approaching of a near-term bottoming-out of voluntary US production cuts.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>WATCH</strong>: Via <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/\">White House</a></li><li><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-protests/hong-kong-no-longer-deserves-special-u-s-status-pompeo-says-idUKKBN23234P\">Recent reports </a>suggest that US President Trump will look to revoke Hong Kong's special trading status over China's new security laws. Ending that regime may result in the City facing the same tariffs that the US levies on China. The response will reportedly be “<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/28/united-states-sanctions-hong-kong-china-cummings-eu/\">as targeted as possible</a>.” The US could also further restrict the export of <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-asserts-strong-dissatisfaction-after-us-expands-tech-blacklist-for-human-rights-abuses-2020-05-25\">sensitive technologies</a> to Hong Kong. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-cancel-visas-for-some-chinese-graduate-students-11590744602?mod=newsviewer_click\">Travel restrictions </a>might also be an option. US actions against the City might mark the beginning of a financial squeeze on China's international finance operations. It also shows that the US is willing to continue using the dollar system as a foreign policy instrument. There is some risk other international partners might also follow the US lead, and there is the potential for <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/28/united-states-sanctions-hong-kong-china-cummings-eu/\">coordinated action</a>, with the EU, UK, Australia and Canada also having <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-protests-britain-spokesman/britain-deeply-concerned-by-chinas-legislation-for-hong-kong-pms-spokesman-idUKKBN23422X\">expressed concern</a> at China’s security law.</li><li><strong>MARKET REACTION:</strong> Markets have taken these reports in its stride, with equities rising to post-crash highs; it would therefore not be entirely surprising to see a limited reaction on Trump's announcement. However, risks include: <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/28/united-states-sanctions-hong-kong-china-cummings-eu/\">sanctions</a> on individuals or entities, including further <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/05/commerce-addresses-huaweis-efforts-undermine-entity-list-restricts\">measures against Huawei</a>, or any <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-audit-chinese-firms-market-frets-over-what-comes-next-11590485401\">US-listed Chinese companies</a>; any impact on the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-28/kudlow-says-china-to-be-held-accountable-for-hong-kong-move\">'phase one' trade deal</a>. Additionally, the question remains how Beijing will respond. Scenarios include: reducing <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/05/22/china-pledges-to-uphold-phase-one-trade-deal-that-includes-200-billion-purchase-of-us-goods/\">trade deal commitments</a> and purchase targets; updating its so-called \"<a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1188493.shtml\">unreliable entities list</a>\" aimed at punishing firms deemed harmful to Chinese interests (AAPL, BA, CSCO, QCOM); some speculate China might <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1189683.shtml\">dump US assets</a>, although this would be a severe option with potentially <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4ab221a-77c6-11e9-bbad-7c18c0ea0201\">self-harming consequences</a>.</li><li><strong>HK BANKING SYSTEM:</strong> Around 70% of international trade in China's yuan is done in via the City. At the end of last year, mainland Chinese banks held USD 1.14trln assets in HK, only a small percentage of China's total USD 40trln of bank assets, but around half the size of the USD 2.22trln that Chinese banks extend to borrowers outside of the mainland. China's banks conduct much of their international business through HK since Shanghai remains subject to capital controls. The role of HK as a hub would be diminished if counterparties fear doing business due to sanctions threats, restricting China's ability to operate financially overseas. If Hong Kong is cut off from the dollar system, China does not have a viable replacement.</li><li><strong>WEAPONISED DOLLAR SYSTEM:</strong> US has demonstrated its extensive reach over the dollar system, with penalties against Korean, French and Lebanese financiers for dealing with sanctioned parties, according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-hong-kongs-special-status-threatens-chinas-grand-financial-ambitions-11590651979?mod=newsviewer_click\">WSJ</a>, which notes that the US recently threatened Iraq’s access to the NY Fed, showing a growing willingness to use financial infrastructure as a foreign policy stick. There might also be medium-term consequences for China's 'Belt and Road' initiative, which is largely dollar denominated, and China's indebted property developers may also come under pressure. Longer-term, it would diminish China's hopes of achieving a <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/05/07/china-wants-to-make-the-yuan-a-central-bank-favourite\">dominant international currency</a>, which HK's role as a key global financial centre would help facilitate.</li></ul>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>PERSONAL INCOME SPENDING &amp; PCE (APRIL):</strong> Personal income in April rose 10.5%, much higher than the expected -6.5% and up from March’s -2.2%. The surge in income was due to the 91.1% record rise in the benefits payment due to the mass stimulus checks handed out. Meanwhile, wages and salaries fell 8%, and proprietors income fell 12%. Spending however fell 13.6%, deeper than the expected -12.6%, and deeper than the prior -7.5%. Oxford Economics highlights the decline was the largest on record with spending on autos, clothing, healthcare, recreation, and food services and accommodation seeing historical falls given the lockdown measures across the country. The consultancy also points out the jump in the savings rate to 33% from 12.7%, a record high, which shows how the pandemic is leading to more frugal consumer behaviour which will dampen the recovery while the benefits payments will decline leaving households more financially constrained. Headline PCE declined by 0.5% M/M, a quicker pace than the prior -0.2% while the Y/Y cooled to a 0.5% pace from 1.3% previously. Core PCE saw deeper deflation than expected, falling 0.4% M/M (exp. -0.3%, prev. -0.1%), while the Core Y/Y metric slowed to 1.0% from 1.7% (exp. 1.1%). Oxford Economics write “Looking ahead, the severe demand shock, the collapse of oil prices and the stronger dollar will lead to deflation for headline PCE and the weakest core PCE inflation on record, below 0.5%.”</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>CHICAGO PMI (MAY): The headline fell to the lowest since March 1982, at 32.3 from 35.4, missing estimates for a rise to 40.0 – the fall is an outlier compared to other regional surveys which saw a bounce in May, although still remained depressed. Pantheon Macroeconomics writes that the expected pick up to 40.0 “always looked a bit ambitious” despite the gains in other surveys. New orders fell by 2.3 points while production fell 6.3 points, continuing on April’s decline and remains at 40-year lows. Order Backlogs fell 28 points to the lowest since March 2009 and is the ninth consecutive sub 50 print. Inventories rose by 4.1 points to an 11-month high. Employment rebounded from the steep declines last month although the report notes “anecdotal evidence was mixed with some firms stating they had to lay off staff or reduce salaries, while others were trying to find new hires”. Note, supplier deliveries ticked down by 5.8 points after a 46-year high in April; the supplier deliveries index has recently been increasing due to supply chain problems rather than too much demand which had been buoying some of the recent headline PMI prints. Pantheon Macroeconomics highlight the Chicago PMI index is vulnerable to Boeing (BA) woes, which was already in “deep trouble” before COVID-19 due to the 737 MAX. The consultancy writes “we’re still inclined to look next week for a modest increase in the national ISM manufacturing index, though a full recovery in the sector will take many months, at least.”</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>A detrimental week of back-to-back losses in the broader Dollar and Index as DXY tumbled from an early-week high of 99.979 to a current low-print at 97.944, taking out a string of moving averages along the way including the 100 DMA (99.789), 21 DMA ( 99.574), 100 DMA (99.037) 21 WMA (98.954) and 50 DMA (98.505) and 50 WMA (98.260). Month-end flows heavily contributed to the downside as some models pointed to modest USD selling. On the data front, the DXY was initially unfazed by a revision lower to Q1 GDP and larger than forecast jobless claim figures. Nonetheless, jitters also surrounded the China situation as tensions between the two largest nations mount on all fronts. Focus almost solely remains on US President Trump’s China presser later (time TBC) whilst Fed Chair Powell is expected to stick to the script at 1600BST as the Fed’s blackout period commences from 30th May.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Yuan</strong></p><p>The Yuan has of course been a key theme against the backdrop of heightened tensions with the US and social pressure from Hong Kong.

As mentioned above, traders are keeping an eagle eye on Trump’s announcement, with WSJ citing sources noting of an announcement that the US will be cancelling visas of some Chinese students with links to the PLA – while China vowed countermeasures and retaliation. USD/CNH continued grinding higher throughout the week alongside the daily PBoC fixings – the pair looks to the EU week around the middle of a 7.1343-1963 band after threatening fresh record highs and revisiting levels last seen at the height of the US-Sino tensions last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP,</strong></p><p>Both set to end the week in the firmer territory, albeit the Single Currency outpaces its neighbour over the channel amid month-end EUR flows ahead of the FX fix. The week saw the European Commission propose a EUR 750bln Recovery Fund comprising of 2/3 grants and the rest loans in a bid to find common ground among Northern and southern Europe. However, the proposal was met with some pessimism and will be subject to further negotiations either at the Eurogroup meeting (11 Jun) or EU Summit (19 June) – Chancellor Merkel does not expect unity on the fund before Summer. Elsewhere on the Central Bank front, ECB’s Villeroy provided the Single Currency with early-week pressure after alluding to a longer period of negative rates and posited possible further measures – ahead of the June 4th meeting – whilst President Lagarde did little to dent the EUR but posited that the ECB’s mild GDP scenario of -5% is outdated – with the metric likely in the range of the medium (-8%) to severe (-12%) scenarios. EUR/USD is poised to end the EU week north of 1.1100 having printed a weekly base at 1.0869 and currency high around 1.1140, topping its 50 DMA (1.0896), 21WMA/100DMA (1.0957) and 50 WMA (1.1051) and 200 DMA (1.1010) along the way. Meanwhile, the UK headlines were dominated by new of PM Johnson’s Chief advisor Cummings, albeit overall had minimal impact on Sterling – instead, Brexit newsflow regains focus with little progress in talks despite earlier reports that EU is preparing to drop its \"maximalist\" approach to negotiations on fisheries with Britain in the next round of negotiations. Cable heads to the end of the EU week with gains – more so on USD action – having notched a weekly 1.2162-1.2367 weekly band. EUR/GBP meanwhile reclaimed 0.9000 to the upside after printing a base a 0.8879 earlier in the week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>The JPY set to end the European week on a modestly firmer footing whilst CHF lagged amid a broader risk rally throughout the week and amid potential SNB presence. Japan announced a fiscal package which brings to total to 43% of its GDP whilst PM Abe also recently announced an end to the state of emergency at its largest cities. USD/JPY fluctuating within last week’s range is looking to end the session just under 107.50 – having clocked in a 107.06-107.94 intraweek range. The Franc meanwhile deviated from the Yen action at the start of the week, with some touting potential SNB action, whilst President Jordan reaffirmed the Central Bank’s stance on intervention and the negative rates ahead June 18th quarterly policy meeting. EUR/CHF looks to end the EU week above its 21WMA (1.0612) closer to its weekly high at 1.0726.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong></p><p>A week of gains for the high-beta FX, again more so on the aggressive USD pullback – however, the currencies were influenced by escalations/heightened tensions on the US-Sino front (oil for the CAD) at different point throughout the week. The pairs were swayed amid reports that two Chinese re pushing ahead with share sales in Hong Kong given US pressure for Chinese companies to disclose the information if not delist – which at the time hit sentiment, whilst Aussie saw separate pressure amid reports China could take aim at Aussie coal exports. Nonetheless, the continued deterioration of the Dollar throughout the week sees the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie set for a positive weekly EU close with AUD/USD just under its 50 WMA at 0.6700 vs. a weekly low of 0.6515 – with the currency looking ahead to the RBA meeting next week after Governor Lowe continued to push-back on the likelihood of a negative Cash Rate earlier this week. The Kiwi reclaimed 0.6200 from a base of 0.6080, topping its 100DMA and 21 WMA (0.6200-07) along the way. The Loonie meanwhile ultimately side-lined overall better-than forecast GDP numbers as USD influence prevailed. USD/CAD looks to end the EU week in the red and towards the bottom of its 1.3710-1.4010 weekly band having dipped below its 100 DMA at 1.3716.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>EM FX has largely been moving in tandem with risk, albeit the BRL deserves a mention after USD/BRL tumbled from 5.5300 to a low of 5.2682 before recoiling back up to 5.43-levels with some pointing to BCB intervention after the Central Bank president reaffirmed the bank’s readiness to dip into reserves against the backdrop of rising coronavirus cases and political scandals threatening the currency.</p>",

ViacomCBS (VIAC) is reportedly going to lay off up to 400 employees across CBS as part of its plan to save USD 750mln from its merger with CBS, according to sources. JD.com (JD) and NetEase (NTES) received approval from Hong Kong for its secondary listings that could raise billions of dollars, according to sources. Comcast Corp.

Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) release positive Phase III trial results. Cisco (CSCO) confirmed it plans to acquire ThousandEyes, an internet Cloud intelligence platform.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Costco (COST) missed on EPS and revenue. Salesforce (CRM) top and bottom-line results were in line with estimates, although it cut its FY guidance beneath analyst expectations. Nordstrom (JWN) missed on EPS and revenue, noted 40% of its stores are now open. Zscaler (ZS) beat on EPS, revenue was inline while guidance was solid. Dell Technologies (DELL) beat on EPS and revenue but it has suspended its share repurchase programme and expects Q2 revenue to be seasonally lower than other years. VM Ware (VMW) beat on EPS and revenue while its subscription and SaaS revenue was +39% to USD 572mln.</p><p><strong>NEWS FLOW DRIVEN RALLY:</strong> It is generally accepted that the rally from March lows has been a result of the Fed backstop juiced by fiscal stimulus from the government; it was assumed that the upside was capped due to increasingly tense US/China news flow, however this week, markets have taken negative news in its stride, and printed fresh post-crash highs. Grim economic data has also been dismissed, since investors are already aware of the level of gloom, and are seemingly more focussed on the direction of travel. RBC posits that the S&amp;P 500 rally is highly news flow driven, noting that the S&amp;P 500 rebound stalled in early May when doubts about the economy’s reopening and concerns about a second wave briefly dominated the news flow, and the rebound got another wind mid-month when positive news on vaccines began to emerge. And on US/China news, RBC argues that the market might not be able to continue its resilience in the face of negative US/China news flow if it becomes the main story investors have to consider. “We view the election as a key risk for stocks this summer and into the fall,” adding that “expectations as to whether Trump will win again in November in the betting market remain closely aligned with S&amp;P 500 performance.” Gambling markets seem to be pricing a close race for both the White House and the Senate – in February, it was pricing a Trump win and the GOP retaining the Senate. “We’ve also been telling investors to keep a close eye on Biden’s VP selection process,” RBC says, “the buzz about Warren is growing in political circles, something the betting market is only just now starting to wake up to.”</p><p><strong>BOFA FLOWS: </strong>BofA weekly flow report showed tiny inflows into cash; first week of government bond redemptions in the last six; biggest IG inflows since February; largest HY inflows in six weeks; while gold continues to see inflows. Equities see USD 3.8bln outflows; bond inflows of USD 20.2bln, largest inflows in 15 weeks; precious metals inflows now seen in 23 of past 24 weeks. In equities specifically, US sees the largest inflows in six weeks (USD 2.2bln), Japan saw chunky inflows of USD 1.4bn, Europe saw smallest outflow in six weeks (USD 200mln), EMs also saw a small outflow of USD 1.6bln). BofA notes that by style, there were USD 3.1bln inflows into US growth, USD 1.7bln in value; and by sector, financials see USD 1.5bln of inflows in the week, and healthcare, tech, consumer, materials, communications, energy also saw inflows; real estate and utilities saw outflows. The report also shows flow laggards catching leaders, with the smallest inflow into health care in nine weeks compared to the largest inflows to banks since January; BofA also reported small inflows into energy and EM debt, and small outflows from Europe.</p>",

In addition, large Japanese automakers suffered after output in the sector fell by a record 33% M/M and Nissan posted its worst loss in 2 decades. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.7%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%)</strong> began subdued ahead of President Trump’s press conference on China which follows the NPC passage of the Hong Kong national security legislation, but with the mainland showing signs of resilience after another firm liquidity operation by the PBoC which injected CNY 670bln of funds this week through reverse repos following a near 2-month hiatus. Finally, 10yr JGBs were rangebound with prices uninspired despite upside in T-notes and the mostly negative risk tone, as well as the BoJ’s presence in the market for JPY 840bln of JGBs with 3yr-25yr maturities.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 300bln via 7-Day Reverse Repos for a weekly net injection of CNY 670bln.

Despite being a key theme throughout the week (where stocks have gained), US-China tensions are hampering sentiment early doors in Europe as markets brace themselves for US President Trump’s press conference later today (time TBC) on China. Ahead of this press conference, China has been on the offensive this morning reiterating that they are willing to take countermeasures against the US in relation to its actions over Hong Kong, urged Canada to release the Huawei CFO immediately and threatened to take countermeasures against Britain if it offers permanent residency to Hong Kong citizens. Sectoral performance in Europe thus far has seen a reversal of some of the trends throughout the week with travel &amp; leisure names underperforming today with Tui (-7%) a notable laggard after the Co’s UK unit has cancelled all its foreign holidays until 1 July, and some that were not due to depart until November. Other movers in the sector include Carnival (-6.3%), Deutsche Lufthansa (-4.3%), easyJet (-4.2%), IAG (-4.2%) and Air France (-2.8%); note, the travel &amp; leisure sector trades higher by 7.8% for the week. Elsewhere, to the downside, Rolls Royce (-9.1%) sits at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. was downgraded to junk by S&amp;P amid disruptions from COVID-19. Renault (-4.9%) shares are hampering the Automobile sector after the Co. announced it is to reduce its headcount by 14.6k over three years in an attempt to save over EUR 2bln, but with the plan implementation costing EUR 1.2bln. Also, in a reversal of trends seen throughout the week, the Stoxx 600 banking sector is trading lower by 1.8%, albeit holds onto gains of 7.8% since Monday.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY, Yuan - </strong>The Dollar index continues to descend with month-end flows cited as one of the main factors. DXY again fell below its 200 DMA (98.505) from a high of 98.549 and thereafter dipped below the 55 WMA (98.191) before printing a current base just under at 98.170. The State-side data slate sees April PCE Price Index, but Fed Chair Powell’s webcast (1600BST) and President Trump’s announcement on China (time TBC) will likely garner today’s focus and set the themes. On that note, tensions between the two largest economies see no signs of subsiding, and rhetoric remains harsh. Nonetheless, the Yuan has nursed its overnight losses with the USD/CNH sub-7.1700 having printed an APAC high at 7.1766.</p><p><strong>JPY, AUD, SEK - </strong>All beneficiaries of the USD pullback with the Yen outperforming potentially on safe-haven tailwinds. USD/JPY sees itself on the softer side of the current 107.06-71 daily band, having briefly dipped below its 21 DMA at 107.19 as it inches closer towards the 107.00 psych mark. AUD/USD probes 0.6650 as it eyes its 200 DMA (0.6656), albeit pair topped but failed to close above the level for four consecutive sessions. SEK also trades on the firmer side after shrugging off a QQ Q1 GDP beat as the annualised figure missed. EUR/SEK dipped below 10.5100 to session lows from a high of 10.5500.</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP - </strong>Mixed trade in the core European currencies with some attributing month-end demand propping up EUR/GBP past 0.9000 to a high of 0.9030 (vs. low 0.8980). As such, Cable briefly took out 1.2300 to the downside, exposing the 21 and 55 DMAs at 1.2290 and 1.2272 respectively. Meanwhile, the Single currency gleans support from an offered Dollar and has extended its move above 1.1100 after probing a short-term Fib level at 1.1111, with little initial reaction to in-line EZ flash CPI. EUR/USD opex today sees some EUR 1.1bln between 1.1145-55 – formidable against the month-end background.</p><p><strong>CAD, NOK, NZD - </strong>The G10 laggards with CAD and NOK failing to reap rewards from the softer Buck amid weaker oil prices – USD/CAD posts mild gains above 1.3750 in a contained range as the pair eyes Canadian Q1 GDP figures. Similarly, EUR/NOK trades flat at 10.8400 in a 10.8170-8500 parameter. The Kiwi’s underperformance meanwhile could be a function of AUD/NZD regaining ground above 1.0700. NZD/USD trades on either side of 0.6200 awaiting the next catalyst.</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Core counterparts look set to end the week on a marginally positive tone, with potential further upside to come as the session continues given the ever-increasing tensions between the US-China as well as domestic US affairs escalating. In addition to these potential risk catalysts, desks note that performance for the month could imply (assuming the 60/40 stock/bond allocation target is utilised) approximately USD 30bln worth of rotation out of stocks and into bonds. Currently <strong>USTs</strong> are firmer, albeit largely range-bound ahead of US entrance and what is likely the final Fed speech from Chair Powell today at 16:00BST/11:00ET ahead of the June FOMC, with the curve bull flattening – in contrast to the quite pronounced bear steepening we saw during yesterday’s session, particularly after the US cash open. Within Europe, price action for core counterparts paints a similar, largely rangebound, picture. EZ data this morning, via flash CPI for May, prompted little reaction as the headline came in at 0.1% as expected given oil prices. For<strong> Bunds</strong> specifically, the sessions high currently resides at 172.37, after which and in the event of a breach of the psychological 172.50 mark potential resistance lies at 172.53; following this, there’s little of note until 173.00. The <strong>BTP-Bund yield</strong> spread continues to tighten this morning, and remains within striking distance of the weeks low around the 183bps region given this week’s promising EU recovery fund updates. Although, a number of nations have already indicated their opposition and, as it requires unanimous consent, a length decision process could see <strong>BTP</strong>s, and other <strong>periphery debt</strong>, surrender some of this week’s upside.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI </strong>and <strong>Brent</strong> crude futures continue to ebb lower in early European trade. However, losses remain modest thus far with WTI July eyeing USD 33/bbl (vs. high 33.77/bbl) to the downside whilst Brent August drifts lower towards USD 35.50/bbl – having already dipped below the level to a base at 35.41/bbl (vs. high 36/bbl). Again, fundamentals largely surround US-China tensions in the absence of OPEC updates and in the run-up to the JMMC/OPEC/OPEC+ meetings on June 8th, 9th and 10th respectively, whilst reports yesterday alluded to Russian companies hesitant to extend current curtailments past the agreed-upon end-June. Furthermore, Russia's Rosneft reportedly told the Russian Energy Ministry that it would be hard to maintain cuts to the end of the year as it does not have enough crude to ship to customers part of long-term supply deals, sources state. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> meanders around yesterday’s levels having had seen a session of gains on the back of potential trade-related allocations. The yellow metal resides in mildly positive territory around USD 1720/oz ahead of yesterday’s USD 1728/oz high. <strong>Copper </strong>prices remain subdued amid the broader risk aversion as prices threaten a test of USD 2.4/lb to the downside.</p>",

Despite being a key theme throughout the week (where stocks have gained), US-China tensions are hampering sentiment early doors in Europe as markets brace themselves for US President Trump’s press conference later today (time TBC) on China. Ahead of this press conference, China has been on the offensive this morning reiterating that they are willing to take countermeasures against the US in relation to its actions over Hong Kong, urged Canada to release the Huawei CFO immediately and threatened to take countermeasures against Britain if it offers permanent residency to Hong Kong citizens. Sectoral performance in Europe thus far has seen a reversal of some of the trends throughout the week with travel &amp; leisure names underperforming today with Tui (-7%) a notable laggard after the Co’s UK unit has cancelled all its foreign holidays until 1 July, and some that were not due to depart until November. Other movers in the sector include Carnival (-6.3%), Deutsche Lufthansa (-4.3%), easyJet (-4.2%), IAG (-4.2%) and Air France (-2.8%); note, the travel &amp; leisure sector trades higher by 7.8% for the week. Elsewhere, to the downside, Rolls Royce (-9.1%) sits at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the Co. was downgraded to junk by S&amp;P amid disruptions from COVID-19. Renault (-4.9%) shares are hampering the Automobile sector after the Co. announced it is to reduce its headcount by 14.6k over three years in an attempt to save over EUR 2bln, but with the plan implementation costing EUR 1.2bln. Also, in a reversal of trends seen throughout the week, the Stoxx 600 banking sector is trading lower by 1.8%, albeit holds onto gains of 7.8% since Monday.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>DXY, Yuan - The Dollar index continues to descend with month-end flows cited as one of the main factors. DXY again fell below its 200 DMA (98.505) from a high of 98.549 and thereafter dipped below the 55 WMA (98.191) before printing a current base just under at 98.170. The State-side data slate sees April PCE Price Index, but Fed Chair Powell’s webcast (1600BST) and President Trump’s announcement on China (time TBC) will likely garner today’s focus and set the themes. On that note, tensions between the two largest economies see no signs of subsiding, and rhetoric remains harsh. Nonetheless, the Yuan has nursed its overnight losses with the USD/CNH sub-7.1700 having printed an APAC high at 7.1766.</p><p>JPY, AUD, SEK - All beneficiaries of the USD pullback with the Yen outperforming potentially on safe-haven tailwinds. USD/JPY sees itself on the softer side of the current 107.06-71 daily band, having briefly dipped below its 21 DMA at 107.19 as it inches closer towards the 107.00 psych mark. AUD/USD probes 0.6650 as it eyes its 200 DMA (0.6656), albeit pair topped but failed to close above the level for four consecutive sessions. SEK also trades on the firmer side after shrugging off a QQ Q1 GDP beat as the annualised figure missed. EUR/SEK dipped below 10.5100 to session lows from a high of 10.5500.</p><p>EUR, GBP - Mixed trade in the core European currencies with some attributing month-end demand propping up EUR/GBP past 0.9000 to a high of 0.9030 (vs. low 0.8980). As such, Cable briefly took out 1.2300 to the downside, exposing the 21 and 55 DMAs at 1.2290 and 1.2272 respectively. Meanwhile, the Single currency gleans support from an offered Dollar and has extended its move above 1.1100 after probing a short-term Fib level at 1.1111, with little initial reaction to in-line EZ flash CPI. EUR/USD opex today sees some EUR 1.1bln between 1.1145-55 – formidable against the month-end background.</p><p>CAD, NOK, NZD - The G10 laggards with CAD and NOK failing to reap rewards from the softer Buck amid weaker oil prices – USD/CAD posts mild gains above 1.3750 in a contained range as the pair eyes Canadian Q1 GDP figures. Similarly, EUR/NOK trades flat at 10.8400 in a 10.8170-8500 parameter. The Kiwi’s underperformance meanwhile could be a function of AUD/NZD regaining ground above 1.0700. NZD/USD trades on either side of 0.6200 awaiting the next catalyst.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Core counterparts look set to end the week on a marginally positive tone, with potential further upside to come as the session continues given the ever-increasing tensions between the US-China as well as domestic US affairs escalating. In addition to these potential risk catalysts, desks note that performance for the month could imply (assuming the 60/40 stock/bond allocation target is utilised) approximately USD 30bln worth of rotation out of stocks and into bonds. Currently <strong>USTs</strong> are firmer, albeit largely range-bound ahead of US entrance and what is likely the final Fed speech from Chair Powell today at 16:00BST/11:00ET ahead of the June FOMC, with the curve bull flattening – in contrast to the quite pronounced bear steepening we saw during yesterday’s session, particularly after the US cash open. Within Europe, price action for core counterparts paints a similar, largely rangebound, picture. EZ data this morning, via flash CPI for May, prompted little reaction as the headline came in at 0.1% as expected given oil prices. For <strong>Bunds</strong> specifically, the sessions high currently resides at 172.37, after which and in the event of a breach of the psychological 172.50 mark potential resistance lies at 172.53; following this, there’s little of note until 173.00. The <strong>BTP</strong>-<strong>Bund</strong> yield spread continues to tighten this morning, and remains within striking distance of the weeks low around the 183bps region given this week’s promising EU recovery fund updates. Although, a number of nations have already indicated their opposition and, as it requires unanimous consent, a length decision process could see BTPs, and other periphery debt, surrender some of this week’s upside.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> crude futures continue to ebb lower in early European trade. However, losses remain modest thus far with WTI July eyeing USD 33/bbl (vs. high 33.77/bbl) to the downside whilst Brent August drifts lower towards USD 35.50/bbl – having already dipped below the level to a base at 35.41/bbl (vs. high 36/bbl). Again, fundamentals largely surround US-China tensions in the absence of OPEC updates and in the run-up to the JMMC/OPEC/OPEC+ meetings on June 8th, 9th and 10th respectively, whilst reports yesterday alluded to Russian companies hesitant to extend current curtailments past the agreed-upon end-June. Furthermore, Russia's Rosneft reportedly told the Russian Energy Ministry that it would be hard to maintain cuts to the end of the year as it does not have enough crude to ship to customers part of long-term supply deals, sources state. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> meanders around yesterday’s levels having had seen a session of gains on the back of potential trade-related allocations. The yellow metal resides in mildly positive territory around USD 1720/oz ahead of yesterday’s USD 1728/oz high. <strong>Copper</strong> prices remain subdued amid the broader risk aversion as prices threaten a test of USD 2.4/lb to the downside.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>WHAT’S GOING ON: </strong>The risk rally stalled on Thursday on news US President Trump will Friday hold a press conference on China, resulting in traders taking risk off the table after what has been a solid week for equities (ES up over 2% this week, Dow up over 3%, although the Nasdaq-100 is flat, underperforming as Chinese companies look to Hong Kong listings). Yields are lower across the Treasury curve, but off lows, and the bias of the curve is mixed/flatter. Crude futures are lower, weighed on by US/China tensions (the latter being the world’s largest importer of crude, and US/China tensions present questions to the demand-side of the equation), but also bearish inventory reports. The dollar index, is lower for the fourth day, extending the downside after breaching its 200dma, and is looking to close red for a second straight week. Cyclical FX and EMFX are more mixed at the end of the week, though the likes of AUD, NZD, GBP, SEK and CAD still enjoy healthy gains on the week and most on the month (not GBP). Traders will also be mindful about <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/update-month-end-citi-s-model-sees-usd-selling-ubs-sees-treasury-index-extension-of-0-14yrs-ms-sees-small-us-equity-outflows-26-05-2020\">month-end flows</a> today.</p><p><strong>ON THE RADAR: </strong>A Trump news conference on China is the main risk into the weekend/month-end (see below for preview link); Fed chair Powell is on the slate, although it is hard to see what more he can add to the narrative having delivered a few public addresses in recent weeks. As well as the Baker Hughes rig count data (which will likely become interesting if oil rises to USD 45-50. At 1400EDT/1900BST, the Fed will update its <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/daily-fed-planned-treasury-purchase-amounts-and-schedules-29th-may-2020-fed-has-one-short-end-op-announces-next-week-s-schedule-at-1400edt-1900bst-28-05-2020\">buying schedule for next week</a>, and will likely taper the size of its asset purchases once again. The Bernstein conference continues, and will feature commentary from banks C, WFC, BAC, BK, but we’ll also be watching out for commentary from MDT and SYY. We also have shareholder meetings for RTN, LOW, OXY, LYS, and an earnings call from TPR.</p><p><strong>THURSDAY’S AMC EARNINGS:</strong> Salesforce (CRM) beat slightly on the top and bottom lines, although guidance was light. Dell (DELL) beat, driven by a strong PC segment, though its enterprise unit wasn’t impressive. Nordstrom missed earnings estimates, though drew down inventories and cut costs. Costco (COST) missed driven by higher wages costs.</p><p><strong>TRUMP CHINA CONFERENCE: </strong>Recent reports suggest that US President Trump will look to revoke Hong Kong's special trading status over China's new security laws. Ending that regime may result in the City facing the same tariffs that the US levies on China. The response will reportedly be “as targeted as possible.” The US could also further restrict the export of sensitive technologies to Hong Kong. Travel restrictions might also be an option. US actions against the City might mark the beginning of a financial squeeze on China's international finance operations. It also shows that the US is willing to continue using the dollar system as a foreign policy instrument. There is some risk other international partners might also follow the US lead, and there is the potential for coordinated action, with the EU, UK, Australia and Canada also having expressed concern at China’s security law. <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-us-president-trump-to-hold-press-conference-on-china-today-28-05-2020\"><strong>Full preview here</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><p><strong>NEWS FLOW DRIVEN RALLY: </strong>It is generally accepted that the rally from March lows has been a result of the Fed backstop juiced by fiscal stimulus from the government; it was assumed that the upside was capped due to increasingly tense US/China news flow, however this week, markets have taken negative news in its stride, and printed fresh post-crash highs. Grim economic data has also been dismissed, since investors are already aware of the level of gloom, and are seemingly more focussed on the direction of travel. RBC posits that the S&amp;P 500 rally is highly news flow driven, noting that the S&amp;P 500 rebound stalled in early May when doubts about the economy’s reopening and concerns about a second wave briefly dominated the news flow, and the rebound got another wind mid-month when positive news on vaccines began to emerge. And on US/China news, RBC argues that the market might not be able to continue its resilience in the face of negative US/China news flow if it becomes the main story investors have to consider. “We view the election as a key risk for stocks this summer and into the fall,” adding that “expectations as to whether Trump will win again in November in the betting market remain closely aligned with S&amp;P 500 performance.” Gambling markets seem to be pricing a close race for both the White House and the Senate – in February, it was pricing a Trump win and the GOP retaining the Senate. “We’ve also been telling investors to keep a close eye on Biden’s VP selection process,” RBC says, “the buzz about Warren is growing in political circles, something the betting market is only just now starting to wake up to.”</p><p><strong>BOFA FLOWS:</strong> BofA weekly flow report showed tiny inflows into cash; first week of government bond redemptions in the last six; biggest IG inflows since February; largest HY inflows in six weeks; while gold continues to see inflows. Equities see USD 3.8bln outflows; bond inflows of USD 20.2bln, largest inflows in 15 weeks; precious metals inflows now seen in 23 of past 24 weeks. In equities specifically, US sees the largest inflows in six weeks (USD 2.2bln), Japan saw chunky inflows of USD 1.4bn, Europe saw smallest outflow in six weeks (USD 200mln), EMs also saw a small outflow of USD 1.6bln). BofA notes that by style, there were USD 3.1bln inflows into US growth, USD 1.7bln in value; and by sector, financials see USD 1.5bln of inflows in the week, and healthcare, tech, consumer, materials, communications, energy also saw inflows; real estate and utilities saw outflows. The report also shows flow laggards catching leaders, with the smallest inflow into health care in nine nine weeks compared to the largest inflows to banks since January; BofA also reported small inflows into energy and EM debt, and small outflows from Europe.</p>",

However, risks include: <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/28/united-states-sanctions-hong-kong-china-cummings-eu/\">sanctions</a> on individuals or entities, including further <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/05/commerce-addresses-huaweis-efforts-undermine-entity-list-restricts\">measures against Huawei</a>, or any <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-audit-chinese-firms-market-frets-over-what-comes-next-11590485401\">US-listed Chinese companies</a>; any impact on the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-28/kudlow-says-china-to-be-held-accountable-for-hong-kong-move\">'phase one' trade deal</a>. Additionally, the question remains how Beijing will respond. Scenarios include: reducing <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/05/22/china-pledges-to-uphold-phase-one-trade-deal-that-includes-200-billion-purchase-of-us-goods/\">trade deal commitments</a> and purchase targets; updating its so-called \"<a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1188493.shtml\">unreliable entities list</a>\" aimed at punishing firms deemed harmful to Chinese interests (AAPL, BA, CSCO, QCOM); some speculate China might <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1189683.shtml\">dump US assets</a>, although this would be a severe option with potentially <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4ab221a-77c6-11e9-bbad-7c18c0ea0201\">self-harming consequences</a>.</p><p><strong>HK BANKING SYSTEM:</strong> Around 70% of international trade in China's yuan is done in via the City. At the end of last year, mainland Chinese banks held USD 1.14trln assets in HK, only a small percentage of China's total USD 40trln of bank assets, but around half the size of the USD 2.22trln that Chinese banks extend to borrowers outside of the mainland. China's banks conduct much of their international business through HK since Shanghai remains subject to capital controls. The role of HK as a hub would be diminished if counterparties fear doing business due to sanctions threats, restricting China's ability to operate financially overseas. If Hong Kong is cut off from the dollar system, China does not have a viable replacement.</p><p><strong>WEAPONISED DOLLAR SYSTEM:</strong> US has demonstrated its extensive reach over the dollar system, with penalties against Korean, French and Lebanese financiers for dealing with sanctioned parties, according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-hong-kongs-special-status-threatens-chinas-grand-financial-ambitions-11590651979?mod=newsviewer_click\">WSJ</a>, which notes that the US recently threatened Iraq’s access to the NY Fed, showing a growing willingness to use financial infrastructure as a foreign policy stick. There might also be medium-term consequences for China's 'Belt and Road' initiative, which is largely dollar denominated, and China's indebted property developers may also come under pressure. Longer-term, it would diminish China's hopes of achieving a <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/05/07/china-wants-to-make-the-yuan-a-central-bank-favourite\">dominant international currency</a>, which HK's role as a key global financial centre would help facilitate.</p>",

Scenarios include: reducing <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/05/22/china-pledges-to-uphold-phase-one-trade-deal-that-includes-200-billion-purchase-of-us-goods/\">trade deal commitments</a> and purchase targets; updating its so-called \"<a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1188493.shtml\">unreliable entities list</a>\" aimed at punishing firms deemed harmful to Chinese interests (AAPL, BA, CSCO, QCOM); some speculate China might <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1189683.shtml\">dump US assets</a>, although this would be a severe option with potentially <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4ab221a-77c6-11e9-bbad-7c18c0ea0201\">self-harming consequences</a>.</p><p><strong>HK BANKING SYSTEM:</strong> Around 70% of international trade in China's yuan is done in via the City. At the end of last year, mainland Chinese banks held USD 1.14trln assets in HK, only a small percentage of China's total USD 40trln of bank assets, but around half the size of the USD 2.22trln that Chinese banks extend to borrowers outside of the mainland. China's banks conduct much of their international business through HK since Shanghai remains subject to capital controls. The role of HK as a hub would be diminished if counterparties fear doing business due to sanctions threats, restricting China's ability to operate financially overseas. If Hong Kong is cut off from the dollar system, China does not have a viable replacement.</p><p><strong>WEAPONISED DOLLAR SYSTEM:</strong> US has demonstrated its extensive reach over the dollar system, with penalties against Korean, French and Lebanese financiers for dealing with sanctioned parties, according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-hong-kongs-special-status-threatens-chinas-grand-financial-ambitions-11590651979?mod=newsviewer_click\">WSJ</a>, which notes that the US recently threatened Iraq’s access to the NY Fed, showing a growing willingness to use financial infrastructure as a foreign policy stick. There might also be medium-term consequences for China's 'Belt and Road' initiative, which is largely dollar denominated, and China's indebted property developers may also come under pressure. Longer-term, it would diminish China's hopes of achieving a <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/05/07/china-wants-to-make-the-yuan-a-central-bank-favourite\">dominant international currency</a>, which HK's role as a key global financial centre would help facilitate.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>The Dollar index continues to descend with month-end flows cited as one of the main factors. DXY again fell below its 200 DMA (98.505) from a high of 98.549 and thereafter dipped below the 55 WMA (98.191) before printing a current base just under at 98.170. The State-side data slate sees April PCE Price Index, but Fed Chair Powell’s webcast (1600BST) and President Trump’s announcement on China (time TBC) will likely garner today’s focus and set the themes. On that note, tensions between the two largest economies see no signs of subsiding, and rhetoric remains harsh. Nonetheless, the Yuan has nursed its overnight losses with the USD/CNH sub-7.1700 having printed an APAC high at 7.1766.</p><p><strong>JPY, AUD, SEK</strong></p><p>All beneficiaries of the USD pullback with the Yen outperforming potentially on safe-haven tailwinds. USD/JPY sees itself on the softer side of the current 107.06-71 daily band, having briefly dipped below its 21 DMA at 107.19 as it inches closer towards the 107.00 psych mark. AUD/USD probes 0.6650 as it eyes its 200 DMA (0.6656), albeit pair topped but failed to close above the level for four consecutive sessions. SEK also trades on the firmer side after shrugging off a QQ Q1 GDP beat as the annualised figure missed. EUR/SEK dipped below 10.5100 to session lows from a high of 10.5500.</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP</strong></p><p>Mixed trade in the core European currencies with some attributing month-end demand propping up EUR/GBP past 0.9000 to a high of 0.9030 (vs. low 0.8980). As such, Cable briefly took out 1.2300 to the downside, exposing the 21 and 55 DMAs at 1.2290 and 1.2272 respectively. Meanwhile, the Single currency gleans support from an offered Dollar and has extended its move above 1.1100 after probing a short-term Fib level at 1.1111, with little initial reaction to in-line EZ flash CPI. EUR/USD opex today sees some EUR 1.1bln between 1.1145-55 – formidable against the month-end background.</p><p><strong>CAD, NOK, NZD</strong></p><p>The G10 laggards with CAD and NOK failing to reap rewards from the softer Buck amid weaker oil prices – USD/CAD posts mild gains above 1.3750 in a contained range as the pair eyes Canadian Q1 GDP figures. Similarly, EUR/NOK trades flat at 10.8400 in a 10.8170-8500 parameter. The Kiwi’s underperformance meanwhile could be a function of AUD/NZD regaining ground above 1.0700. NZD/USD trades on either side of 0.6200 awaiting the next catalyst.</p>",

The greenback’s major counterparts benefitted in which&nbsp; <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> held on to most its gains although has met resistance just shy of the 1.1100 handle, and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was rangebound above 1.2300 as the UK is set to further ease the lockdown from Monday with schools and shops set to reopen.

However, some of the gains have been retraced due to cautious overnight risk tone and Fed’s Kaplan (Dallas Fed President) also suggested it could take to H2 next year for the global excess inventory to come off.

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The UST curve resumed bear steepening as stocks added to recent gains, supported by further indications of economic recovering. Heading into the US session, the curve lacked direction, however, following weekly jobless claims – which showed the first drop in continued claims since the crises began – duration was offered, seeing the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield gravitate to the 70bp region. Yields remained close to highs in the latter part of the session, with the USD 38bln new 7-year auction likely sustaining the pressure, which tailed the 0.544% by 0.9bp, covered 2.55x (average), and dealers took slightly more than usual. Note, month-end Treasury rebalancing would not have supported this week’s auctions due to settlements occurring in June. Looking ahead, the Fed will announce its week ahead asset purchases schedule on Friday afternoon, where it will again likely cut its purchases (currently at USD 5bln per day this week, or USD 20bln across the whole week).

Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) was also negative after a slew of data releases including the largest Y/Y decline in Retail Sales since 1998 and a wider than expected contraction in Industrial Production, that forced the government to cut its assessment on industrial production which it labelled as ‘decreasing rapidly’ for the first time since November 2008. In addition, large Japanese automakers suffered after output in the sector fell by a record 33% M/M and Nissan posted its worst loss in 2 decades. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) began subdued ahead of President Trump’s press conference on China which follows the NPC passage of the Hong Kong national security legislation, but with the mainland showing signs of resilience after another firm liquidity operation by the PBoC which injected CNY 670bln of funds this week through reverse repos following a near 2-month hiatus. Finally, 10yr JGBs were rangebound with prices uninspired despite upside in T-notes and the mostly negative risk tone, as well as the BoJ’s presence in the market for JPY 840bln of JGBs with 3yr-25yr maturities.</p>",
