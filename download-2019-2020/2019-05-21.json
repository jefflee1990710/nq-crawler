Apple (AAPL) moved higher as the tech sector rallied, shrugging-off large warning from Credit Suisse. Home Depot (HD) opened lower after the company reported mixed earnings, where the co beat top and bottom-line analyst expectations but missed on comp. sales. Walmart (WMT) was under pressure after news emerged that Walmart and a number of other department stores were informed by a judge that they would face a lawsuit for falsely labelling items “100% Egyptian Cotton”. Electronic Arts (EA) caught a tail wind after it was named a near-term fresh pick at Baird. Kohl’s (KSS) plunged as the co reported mixed earnings; missing on bottom line expectations and revising lower FY19 guidance but beating on top line. Merck (MRK) moved higher on news the drug maker would acquire Pelaton Theraputics, shrugging off news its headline Keytruda drug missed primary endpoints. DowDuPont (DWDP) jumped higher at the open after the industrial conglomerate announced a USD 2bln share buyback program.

There was some influence from the Gilt complex in the European day, heading lower on news that UK PM May would unveil a new deal to get Brexit legislation through Parliament. The complex continued to head lower into the late US morning, after which it has been going horizontal. Wednesday's FOMC meeting minutes are the next immediate focus, though trade rhetoric from the US side has been relatively minimal on Tuesday, always leaving risks. Additionally, it appears progress is being made on the US Budget front, with Republican and Democratic teams meeting today to negotiate budget caps, and a deal could be announced later on Tuesday, which may also include a deal on the debt ceiling too. At settlement, major curve spreads had come in by between 1-3bps. T-note futures (M9) settled 4+ ticks lower at 124-04+.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT:</strong> Equites up, Treasuries down, Dollar flat, Crude mixed.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> US eases restrictions on Huawei, UK PM May offer “New Brexit Deal”, New Offer rejected across political spectrum, Iranian President does not want talks, US Existing Home Sales disappoints</p><p><strong>* COMING UP:</strong> JN Machinery orders, Exports, Imports, Trade Balance, AU Construction Work, UK CPI, CA Retail Sales, US Crude Stocks &amp; Production, US FOMC Minutes, AU Manufacturing, Services &amp; Comp PMI, BoJ’s Harada, Fed’s Bullard, Williams, Bostic, ECB’s Draghi, Praet, BoE’s Haldane, Earnings from; Lowe’s Companies, Target, VF Corp, Analog Devices, NetApp</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The US has temporarily eased trade restrictions on China's Huawei to minimise disruption for its customers, a move the founder of the world’s largest telecoms equipment maker said meant little because it was already prepared for US action, Reuters reported. Huawei is still prohibited from buying American-made hardware and software to make new products without further, hard-to-obtain licenses. On the Chinese side, China President Xi Jinping called for a \"new Long March\" in sign that China is preparing for protracted trade war, SCMP reported. Xi said \"we are now embarking on a new Long March, and we must start all over again\" with the newspaper noting that his comments came amid an increasingly sour mood in official Chinese media, which have become more forceful in its anti-US rhetoric since trade war talks collapsed.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL:</strong> Iranian President Rouhani said as it stands he would not accept talks with Washington, but he caveated that he would prefer diplomacy and talks, “Today's situation is not suitable for talks and our choice is resistance only.” In a sign of contingency planning, neighbouring country Iraqi PM said it was looking at alternatives for oil exports in the situation the Iran controlled Strait of Hormuz closes. US Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan said on Tuesday that the Iran risk remains high; a Reuters/Ipsos poll also suggested over half of Americans are in favour of the US going to war with Iran within the next few years.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May offered outlined new Brexit proposals in an effort to win backing for her approach to Brexit; she has stepped-over a few red lines for the extreme Brexiteer wing of her party, offering MPs a vote on a Second Referendum, should they approve her deal at a vote in the week of the 3/June. The new Bill also contains guarantees on workers' rights, the Irish Backstop, as well as a Customs Union compromise. However, her Bill already appears as though it is doomed-to-fail; Labour has said it will not back the deal, the ERG group of Brexiteers will not back the deal, and she does not appear to have secured support of the centrist Brexit Delivery Group, after its leader Andrew Percy stated he will not back the deal (his group have been trying to support May's deal from the backbenches, and some think he is a good barometer of pragmatism on the Conservative backbench, but May's approach has isolated the centrist groups too). Analysts at Oxford Economics said that with May set to step down after losing her vote in June, the next major crunch point on Brexit will be the summer’s Conservative Party leadership contest.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Overnight, <strong>Fed Chair Powell</strong> dismissed comparisons between the current rise of business debt towards recod levels and the conditions in mortgage markets in the run-up to the GFC, saying the link was \"not fully convincing\". Powell did warn, however, that anoher sharp rise in corporate debt could increase vulnerabilities appreciably. On trade, Powell only suggested that it was too early to draw any conclusions from negotiations, and the outcome remained uncertain. <strong>Fed's Rosengren (voter) </strong>says no clear need to alter the current stance of monetary policy in the near term. Rosengren notes risks are abating worries about foreign growth slowing as a result of Brexit, and about the Chinese economy faltering – appear to have subsided, Q1 US growth stronger than many forecasters expected equity markets have recovered from Q4. He called for patience, and warned that more disruptive trade negotiations are another reason for policymaker patience. Like Bostic today, and Williams yesterday, Rosengren sees unemployment rate falling further. <strong>Fed's Evans (voter)</strong> largely stayed away from current monetary policy, and said that US sub-trend growth makes QE more likely over time, and that the Fed needs to plan for the likelihood that it will hit the ZLB of rates more frequently in the future; he did not sense any discussion of negative rates as a possible future tool; Fed would only use QE at zero or near-zero rates. He did however suggest that the Fed must consider the role of the balance sheet in a low-rate environment.</p><p><strong>* US EXISTING HOME SALES: </strong>March existing home sales data missed expectations at 5.19mln (exp. 5.35mln, prev. 5.21mln), which was in contrast to the latest pending home sales data. That said, Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that \"even after this disappointing result, though, the trend in sales is turning higher after the alarming downshift last year,\" noting that \"the combination of higher mortgage rates and the capping of state and local tax deductions hit the market hard in 2018, especially in the higher-priced areas of high-tax states, most notably parts of NY, NJ, CT, IL, and CA.\" Pantheon says that the market seems to be adjusting to the new reality, where homebuyers in these areas have reduced spending power, which is weighing on prices and sales volumes. \"Looking ahead, the combination of an 80bps drop in mortgage rates since November and continued strength in the job market should facilitate further increases in home sales and housing construction,\" and the consultancy believes that \"existing home sales ought to return to their late 2017 cycle peak during the summer, if the rising trend in mortgage applications is any guide.\"</p><p><strong>* EZ CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: </strong>Eurozone flash consumer confidence for May was slightly better than expectations (-6.5% against an expected -7.7 and a prior upward revision to -7.3). However, Capital Economics still warns that despite the rise, the data series is still consistent with fairly weak spending growth. \"The index remains well below its peak of -3.4 in December 2017, and a touch below its average since the start of 2018 of -6.0,\" the consultancy observes, \"and since then, household consumption growth has averaged just 1.3% Y/Y.\" While the country breakdown is not yet known, the timelier Thomson Reuters/Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Indices show that sentiment improved in Germany, France and particularly in Spain, while deteriorating in Italy, which could reflect concerns of heightened tensions with the EU, once again. CapEco says that \"on past form, the Eurozone consumer confidence index is consistent with consumption growth of between 1.0% and 1.5% Y/Y, but wage growth appears to have passed its peak, and we suspect that consumers will save much of the windfall from lower inflation this year.\" As a result, CapEco thinks that although private consumption is likely to hold up better than exports in 2019, it will rise only at a modest pace.</p><p><strong>* RBA:</strong> A June rate cut seems locked. The RBA's May minuting minutes stated that \"in the scenario where there was no further improvement in the labour market in the period ahead... a decrease in the cash rate would likely be appropriate\" and that \"without an easing in monetary policy over the next six months, growth and inflation outcomes would be expected to be less favourable than the central scenario.\" The easing bias is clear within the minutes, and it was followed by remarks from Governor Lowe, where he stated that \"at our meeting in two weeks' time, we will consider the case for lower interest rates.\" Lowe noted the weakness in the labour market and suggested that monetary policy has a role to play (speeding the decline of the jobless rate and returning inflation to target via cutting rates). The RBA's rosy forecasts (growth of 2.75% and unemployment rate at 5.00%) are premised on market expectations of a cut to the Cash Rate from 1.50% to 1.00% by year-end; Lowe said the RBA would have needed to forecast lower growth and higher unemployment if it was to assume stable rates. UBS said \"it's already pretty clear that Lowe thinks [a rate cut] is required. The RBA had assumed one in August and another in November when they made their forecasts. They may see June as bringing forward August. If there's a post-election sugar high, it may keep the second 25bp cut in November, which makes August at -39bp around 5bp too rich, but November at around -50bp seems fair. Can the RBA keep cutting below 1%? That's possible, but given the recent domestic positives, global forces may be needed to take the market there in the near term.\"</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9, EXPIRES) SETTLES $0.11 LOWER AT $62.99/BBL; BRENT (N9) SETTLES $0.21 HIGHER AT $72.18/BBL</strong>. Energy markets had a choppy Tuesday, where prices swayed in both directions before the US equity open and then again after, coming ahead of weekly US inventories that are expected to print draws across the board. Oil prices have more or less remained rangebound for the past few trading sessions, where the market is essentially in a wait-and-see stance for more developments in both OPEC+ supply cut commitments and Middle East tensions, as well as the unfolding of US-China trade talks. Although equity markets traded higher on improved risk appetite, crude futures didn’t follow suit, “June WTI crude oil futures also expire today, adding to the tendency toward book squaring, rather than risk-on trade flow,” analysts at Citigroup highlight. Also in the short-term, participants are awaiting the latest US energy inventory data, with the API to report after the bell on Tuesday. Current expectations: crude -0.6mln bbls, gasoline -0.8mln bbls, and distillates -0.05mln bbls. Elsewhere, amidst tensions in the Persian Gulf, the Iraqi PM said the country is looking at alternatives for oil exports in case the Hormuz Strait closes. In regard to the contaminated oil in Russia, where Total’s (FP FP) Leuna refinery was initially set to receive a large amount of the dirty black gold sitting in the Druzhba pipeline, the refinery reported equipment failure which could reportedly halt delivery for at least a week; an estimated 8mln-9mln bbls of contaminated oil are currently sitting in the pipeline, with industry sources calling for a Plan B.</p><p><strong>S&amp;P 500 0.9% at 2864, NASDAQ-100 1% at 7451, Dow Jones 0.8% at 25877, SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.6%, Consumer Staples -0.3%, Energy 1.1%, Financials 0.9%, Health Care 0.8%, Industrials 1.2%, Information Technology 1.2%, Materials 1.5%, Telecommunication Services 1%, Utilities 0.1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECFICS: </strong>Chipmakers including Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Micron Technologies (MU), Xilinix (XLNX), Analog Devices (ADI), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP) all moved higher as the US extended a 90 day waiver on the Huawei blacklisting. Apple (AAPL) moved higher as the tech sector rallied, shrugging-off large warning from Credit Suisse. Home Depot (HD) opened lower after the company reported mixed earnings, where the co beat top and bottom-line analyst expectations but missed on comp. sales. Walmart (WMT) was under pressure after news emerged that Walmart and a number of other department stores were informed by a judge that they would face a lawsuit for falsely labelling items “100% Egyptian Cotton”. Electronic Arts (EA) caught a tail wind after it was named a near-term fresh pick at Baird. Kohl’s (KSS) plunged as the co reported mixed earnings; missing on bottom line expectations and revising lower FY19 guidance but beating on top line. Merck (MRK) moved higher on news the drug maker would acquire Pelaton Theraputics, shrugging off news its headline Keytruda drug missed primary endpoints. DowDuPont (DWDP) jumped higher at the open after the industrial conglomerate announced a USD 2bln share buyback program. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) opened higher but gave away much off these gains on news that the drug maker had lost a USD 25mln talcum powder lawsuit, which is one of thousands. Tesla (TSLA) opened lower after Morgan Stanley reduced their profit target for the electric automaker from USD 87 to USD 10, citing an increasing debt load, geopolitics and demand in China.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 4+ TICKS LOWER AT 124-04+. </strong>The curve bear-flattened on Tuesday, with the complex drifting lower overnight on news that Huawei sanctions will not be immediately implemented. There was some influence from the Gilt complex in the European day, heading lower on news that UK PM May would unveil a new deal to get Brexit legislation through Parliament. The complex continued to head lower into the late US morning, after which it has been going horizontal. Wednesday's FOMC meeting minutes are the next immediate focus, though trade rhetoric from the US side has been relatively minimal on Tuesday, always leaving risks. Additionally, it appears progress is being made on the US Budget front, with Republican and Democratic teams meeting today to negotiate budget caps, and a deal could be announced later on Tuesday, which may also include a deal on the debt ceiling too. At settlement, major curve spreads had come in by between 1-3bps.</p><p><strong>* DAILY FX WRAP: </strong>Brexit returned with a bang, and GBP dictated FX action for parts of the day. <strong>GBP</strong> spiked higher on speculation UK PM May was to offer major concessions on Brexit in an effort to push a deal through Parliament. Cable spiked above 1.2800, but fully reversed the move after it became clear that her deal has not immediately secured the necessary support for successful passage. <strong>EUR </strong>took cues from<strong> </strong>sterling, popping as high as 1.1187 in a kneejerk reaction to UK PM May’s speech. <strong>USD</strong> also saw some volatility around this time, but ultimately finished the session flat/slightly higher, shrugging off lower existing home sales. <strong>JPY</strong> weakened throughout the US session as stocks rallied on the back of the US’s decision to grant 90 waivers on the Huawei blacklist, and Treasury yields rose. <strong>AUD</strong>: fell on dovish RBA developments overnight; recent rallies have proven good opportunities for traders to sell into, and this was no exception as the surprise election outcome bounce has been faded. The next key consideration traders must contend with is how long the \"Morrison effect\" can support the AUD. <strong>NZD</strong> moved lower in sympathy. <strong>CAD</strong> moved a touch lower with the crude complex and in line with how other risk currencies were performing. <strong>BRL</strong> performed well, paring back on some of last week’s losses ahead of tomorrow’s inflation data. <strong>TRY</strong> was on the back foot as CBRT maintained efforts to curtail speculative flows and restore investor confidence in the face of more evidence that sentiment is weak on economic, fiscal, political and diplomatic grounds.</p><p><strong>* EUR (and CNY, USD, GBP):</strong> While the USD is expensive, it is supported by highest yields in G10 FX and strong growth, while the EUR, while historically cheap against the USD, is anchored by negative bund yields and weak growth, while political worries linger. SocGen says that \"given positions and valuation, it's easier to see EURUSD at 1.20 than 1.05 in a 6-12 months' time but there are two clear downside risks in the short-term (1-3-months): a weaker yuan and a weaker pound.\" the GBP and CNY account for around 36% of the ECB's trade weighted EUR, which the bank notes correlated more closely with EURCNY than with EURUSD, adding that the correlation beyween GBPUSD and EURUSD speaks more to the importance of the UK to the Eurozone, as well as the importance of the Eurozone to the UK. The bank points out that while EURUSD has fallen over the last month, EURCNY has gained, resulting in a stronger trade-weighted EUR index: \"a near-term break of USDCNY 7.00 may be unlikely, but it would drag EURUSD through the year's lows and could trigger stops.\" On the GBP side, SocGen argues that the main support for GBP is that it is close to extreme levels in trade-weighted terms, but given that political upheavel looks to be on the cards through summer, if sterling takes another significant knock, that too will hurt the euro: \"it's hard to know how to gauge the probability of the Chinese authorities allowing USDCNY to break higher, or of another sterling confidence crisis, but they are risks that can disrupt the current EURUSD range and both would drag the euro lower.\"</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The USD has benefited from risk-off, and is also a beneficiary of other major central banks remaining relatively accommodative, while higher relative yields and growth add to the Greenback's allure. \"Yield-hungry money market funds make their way into the US, easing monetary conditions in the US but tightening them elsewhere,\" Morgan Stanley says, \"this is why USD strength is inconsistent with a strong global growth and risk outlook. The stronger the USD, the weaker the risk outlook, it seems.\" And the bank says that one of the two will have to give way, and it looks like falling risk appetite is taking the lead.</p><p><strong>* MXN:</strong> Holding up well amid trade war risk-off, likely due to the fact it has already negotiated the USMCA pact with the US. The positivity has been epitomised by last week's announcement that the US would remove tariffs on metals imports (reciprocated by the Mexicans). However, with the Mexican economy remaining subdued, Commerzbank would not be surprised to see hte selling pressure return soon. Additionally, the USMCA is still to be ratified by all three nations (US, MXN, CAD), and as such, there remains a risk that new conflicts could arise.</p><p><strong>* BRL</strong>: Inflation data released Wednesday will be key. The Real last week rose to above 4.00 vs the USD, and losses are extending as the prospects for fiscal reform faces hurdles. A rise in the inflation data would likely lead to increased expectations of a BCB rate hike.</p>",

The complex continued to head lower into the late US morning, afterwhich it has been going horizontal. Wednesday's FOMC meeting minutes are the next immediate focus, though trade rhetoric from the US side has been relatively minimal on Tuesday, always leaving risks. Additionally, it appears progress is being made on the US Budget front, with Republican and Democratic teams meeting today to negotiate budget caps, and a deal could be announced later on Tuesday, which may also include a deal on the debt ceiling too. At settlement, major curve spreads had come in by between 1-3bps.</p>",

Oil prices have more or less remained rangebound for the past few trading sessions, where the market is essentially in a wait-and-see stance for more developments in both OPEC+ supply cut commitments and Middle East tensions, as well as the unfolding of US-China trade talks. Although equity markets traded higher on improved risk appetite, crude futures didn’t follow suit, “June WTI crude oil futures also expire today, adding to the tendency toward book squaring, rather than risk-on trade flow,” analysts at Citigroup highlight. Also in the short-term, participants are awaiting the latest US energy inventory data, with the API to report after the bell on Tuesday. Current expectations: crude -0.6mln bbls, gasoline -0.8mln bbls, and distillates -0.05mln bbls. Elsewhere, amidst tensions in the Persian Gulf, the Iraqi PM said the country is looking at alternatives for oil exports in case the Hormuz Strait closes. In regard to the contaminated oil in Russia, where Total’s (FP FP) Leuna refinery was initially set to receive a large amount of the dirty black gold sitting in the Druzhba pipeline, the refinery reported equipment failure which could reportedly halt delivery for at least a week; an estimated 8mln-9mln bbls of contaminated oil are currently sitting in the pipeline, with industry sources calling for a Plan B.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD/JPY</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Kiwi remain rooted to the base of the major rankings largely on heightened expectations that the RBA will follow the RNBZ with a rate cut as soon as June given the dovish tone of this month’s policy meeting minutes and in particular subsequent comments from Governor Lowe overnight. Aud/Usd has erased all and more of Monday’s post-election recovery gains to sit just a few pips off the pre-weekend and new ytd base around 0.6862 (stripping out the early 2019 flash crash low), with the next line of chart support seen down at 0.6850, while Nzd/Usd has already posted a fresh 2019 trough and is threatening to lose grip of the 0.6500 handle having breached the 0.6525 post-RBNZ ease nadir. Ahead for the Kiwi, latest GDT auction results and NZ Q1 retail sales. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy has bounced further from yesterday’s sub-110.00 low and technical support at the 100 HMA (109.80) to breach resistance around 110.30 (including a Fib) and the 100 DMA (110.51) on the way to a circa 110.60 peak. The catalysts, a tech-led rebound in stocks/overall risk sentiment on Huawei stop-gap sanction relief, firmer US Treasury yields and a generally bid Greenback, as the <strong>DXY </strong>probes<strong> </strong>resistance above 98.000 and ahead of the 98.346 ytd high (like a 98.035 Fib and this month’s previous 98.102 peak).</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sterling staged a pretty decent recovery on a mixture of short covering, technical buying and Brexit optimism as UK PM May emerged from a lengthy Cabinet meeting pledging to put a new WA to Parliament around 4 pm London time, with Cable up to a fresh high for the day at 1.2813 vs 1.2686 at worst and Eur/Gbp down towards 0.8725 vs 0.8790 before the Pound petered out again and the single currency stabilised. Indeed, Eur/Usd held above support ahead of the 2019 low after tripping stops and filling bids at 1.1150 and perhaps aided by a more pronounced improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence than expected vs weaker than forecast US existing home sales data, although this was not that apparent at the time. Note also, reports that May offered MPs a free 2nd referendum vote also lifted Cable and Eur/Usd (latter towards 1.1190).</p><p><strong>NOK/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some outperformance or relative resilience courtesy of firm/steady crude prices as Eur/Nok eased down from another 9.8000+ visit and Usd/Cad briefly probed through 1.3400, while Eur/Sek lagged around 10.7800 with Riksbank's Ohlsson noting that the Swedish Crown has become very weak this year.</p><p><strong>TRY</strong></p><p>The Lira has topped out ahead of 6.0000 vs the Buck yet again, as the Government and CBRT maintain efforts to curtail speculative flows and restore investor confidence in the face of more evidence that sentiment is weak on economic, fiscal, political and diplomatic grounds. To recap, Turkish consumer morale deteriorated sharply in May, FX transaction settlements for non-corporate retail deals in Usd100k or above were brought forward from spot to plus one day and the CBRT reinstated 1 week repos and cut swap rates by 150 bp to 24%.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>China President Xi this week visited a region of China that calls itself “a rare earth kingdom” in a move which analysts suggest is aimed at drawing attention to a source of leverage China has over the US. As China’s SCMP notes in an explainer on the topic, these minerals are used in a variety of industries and hi-tech devices in the US and, since 1990, China has accounted for more than 90% of global production. “It (the visit) sends the message: ‘Keep in mind we have the ability to affect the production of many major products in the United States,’” Anthony Marchese, chairman of Texas Mineral Resources Corp, told the WSJ. Stock prices of companies associated with the rare earth minerals industry shot higher on anticipation of a potential future spike in prices.</li><li>Rabobank, however, shot down the idea that a restriction of rare mineral exports to the US could be China’s next move as the trade war escalates. “Such a step would devastate its rare earth exporters; it would show the world they cannot rely on China as a supplier” Rabo notes. Moreover, the bank points out that “rare earths aren’t actually rare. Lots of countries, including the US, Japan, Brazil, India, and South Africa, have them in abundance. China only controls 80% of global supply because it subsidised its state-owned firms until they achieved economy-of-scale dominance in the same way as it is seen trying to do in other industrial sectors, which has generated the current China backlash.”</li><li>China has tried to use its dominance over world rare earth mineral production in the past. SCMP notes that in a 2010 diplomatic row, China reduced exports of the minerals to Japan. Japan has since been seeking alternative sources and recently found “enough rare earth mineral for 780 years of local demand”. Rabo posits that “if there aren’t governments planning to massively boost rare earths output in Australia, California, India, Japan, Vietnam, and Brazil, etc., then I will eat my hat! China will soon find that its latest economic ‘super-weapon’ is another dud.”</li></ul>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Oil prices have come off lows on Tuesday and climbed back into the green heading into the US session, in line with equity futures amidst light news flow and ahead of the API inventory release later this evening. Latest expectations for US energy inventories see draws in both crude and the products: crude -2.5mln bbls, gasoline -0.3mln bbls, distillates -0.3mln bbls. ING’s analysts highlight that we are now in the tail-end of maintenance season, “refineries are increasing run rates as we move into summer, which should bring an end to the large crude builds.”</li><li>Looking at the Persian Gulf, Iranian President Rouhani said overnight that he favours talks and diplomacy, although under current conditions he would not accept it. Is conflict the default? These comments came not long after US President Trump said Iran would be making a very big mistake if it did anything, which would be met with great force, however he added that there was no indication that they were doing “anything”. Saudi Arabia in the meantime is sitting on the edge of conflict, something that the US may not be able to control, where Saudi is pointing the finger at Iran for backing the Houthi attacks on its infrastructure. PVM’s analysts warn, “When tension rises in that part of the word it is impossible not think of the devastating impact on global oil supply should the Strait of Hormuz be dragged into the conflict.”</li><li>Amidst OPEC+ members sustaining production cuts, it is worth reminding that for some members the cuts aren’t exactly voluntary, particularly for Venezuela. The EIA notes in its most recent Short-Term Energy outlook that the struggling LatAm country’s production has fallen (on average) from 1.2mln BPD at the beginning of the year, down to 830K BPD currently. Analysts at the EIA comment, “This average is the lowest level since January 2003… Widespread power outages, mismanagement of the country's oil industry, and U.S. sanctions directed at Venezuela's energy sector and PdVSA have all contributed to the recent declines.” The EIA forecasts Venezuela’s production to continue falling “through at least the end of 2020, reflecting further declines in production capacity.” If OPEC+ does decide to raise production again in the near future, Venezuela is just another factor weighing on its ability to do so.</li></ul>",

Aud/Usd is teetering just above last Friday’s 2019 low (0.6862) – discounting the so called ‘flash crash’ trough at 0.6743 from early January – and eyeing support at 0.6850 ahead of the 30 DMA (0.6845) and decent option expiry interest at 0.6800 (close to 1 bn). Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd is just a few pips over 0.6500 having breached the post-RBNZ cut and previous ytd base of 0.6525, as the Aud/Nzd cross holds between 1.0557-90.

On that note, today’s Cabinet meeting will provide more clues as to the level of support for and opposition to the WA after a narrower defeat at the 3rd HoC vote, with some suggestions that the tide has turned back against the proposal. Cable has now filled bids said to be sitting from 1.2710-15 and any psychological buying interest at 1.2700 to hit 1.2686 vs the mid-January trough at 1.2670 that came with the failure of MV1, while Eur/Gbp has tested resistance ahead of the 200 DMA circa 0.8790 or 1.1375 in Sterling terms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY - </strong>Also weaker vs a broadly firm Dollar as the DXY edges back above the 98.000 level to probe recent peaks and resistance spanning the 98.030-120 area ahead of this year’s high at 98.346. The single currency has slipped through bids that held on Monday at 1.1150, but not further towards support at 1.1135 or the 1.1112 ytd low, while the Franc is back on the 1.0100 pivot and Yen has retreated from its 100 HMA (109.80) to retest support at 110.31 (Fib and recent low).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Another day in the spotlight for the Lira as the Government and CBRT maintain efforts to curtail speculative flows and restore investor confidence in the face of more evidence that sentiment is weak on economic, fiscal, political and diplomatic grounds. Indeed, Turkish consumer morale has fallen sharply in May and Usd/Try has bottomed around 6.0000 yet again even though FX transaction settlements for non-corporate retail deals in Usd100k or above have been brought forward from spot to plus one day and the CBRT has reinstated 1 week repos and cut swap rates by 150 bp to 24%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RBA Governor Lowe said the board will consider lowering rates at the June policy meeting and that they need further improvement in labour market as well as unemployment to decline below 5%.</strong> Governor Lowe also commented that recent data makes it less likely that the labour market will surprise to the upside and that forecasts for growth and jobs would have been weaker without the assumption of rate cuts, while he later added that they do have an easing bias and that APRA changes to mortgage rules would be complementary to a rate cut but do not have direct implications on rate policy. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RBA Minutes from May 7th meeting stated that interest rate cut would be appropriate if no further improvement in the labour market</strong> and that it is important to pay close attention to the jobs market over the period ahead.

Meanwhile, Bunds have retreated back below par after a similar bounce topped out at 166.90 (+11 ticks vs -18 ticks at worst) and US Treasuries remain relatively flat and mid-range ahead of US existing home sales data and more Fed speak.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>A relatively choppy session thus far in the energy complex as WTI (+0.8%) and Brent (+0.6%) futures have recently moved past the USD 63.50 and USD 72.20 levels to the upside, after a brief spell in negative territory on the day. News flow has been light in the sector ahead of tonight’s API crude inventories release with forecasts for a headline crude drawdown of 1.9mln barrels whilst distillates are expected to decline by 600k barrels. Turning to OPEC, following yesterday’s delay to the 25/26th June OPEC/OPEC+ meetings, Energy Intelligence notes that there are talks of a JMMC and JTC meeting on July 1st and 2nd ahead of an OPEC/OPEC+ meeting on July 3rd-4th. Nothing is yet confirmed. Elsewhere, Russian press noted that oil transit from Russian oil transit towards the EU has now resumed following the contaminated oil at the Ust-Luga port. In terms of metals, gold (-0.2%) prices remain subdued as the Dollar index gains more ground above 98.000. Meanwhile, copper prices are relatively flat amid the indecisive risk tone. Finally, aluminium futures (-1.5%) slump after a federal court in Brazil lifted a production embargo at Hydro’s Alunorte refinery which would see the a ramp-up in production from 50% to 75-80% within two months.</p><p>There is talk of July 3rd-4th OPEC meeting and 1st-2nd July for the Joint OPEC/Non-OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and Joint OPEC-Non-OPEC Technical Committee (JTC).

Sectors are all in the green although the defensive sectors are marginally lagging their peers. Chipmakers are bolstered by reports that the US government are to temporarily ease some trade restrictions imposed on Huawei, with STMicroelectronics (+2.7%), AMS (+3.4%) and Micro Focus (+2.1%) higher. In terms of individual stocks, Spanish listed DIA (+4.5%) opened higher in excess of 8% after Santander (+0.1%) agreed a financing deal with DIA to avoid insolvency proceedings. Meanwhile, Norsk Hydro (+5.2%) shares spiked higher after Brazil gave the company the green light for its Alunorte Alumina plant to reopen. Finally, Telecom Italia (+2.1%) shares jumped following optimistic earnings aftermarket yesterday.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>AUD/NZD - The Aussie is dragging its antipodean compatriot back down under after just a fleeting pop higher in wake of PM Morrison’s unexpected re-election, and the catalyst is a combination of dovish RBA minutes and rhetoric from Governor Lowe that have ramped up June rate cut expectations to over 90% per interbank pricing and around 75% in OIS terms. Aud/Usd is teetering just above last Friday’s 2019 low (0.6862) – discounting the so called ‘flash crash’ trough at 0.6743 from early January – and eyeing support at 0.6850 ahead of the 30 DMA (0.6845) and decent option expiry interest at 0.6800 (close to 1 bn). Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd is just a few pips over 0.6500 having breached the post-RBNZ cut and previous ytd base of 0.6525, as the Aud/Nzd cross holds between 1.0557-90. Next up for the Kiwi, NZ Q1 retail sales and the latest GDT auction.</p><p>GBP - The Pound continues to depreciate awaiting further Brexit developments following the collapse of talks between the Conservative and Labour Parties and ahead of MV4 due early next month. On that note, today’s Cabinet meeting will provide more clues as to the level of support for and opposition to the WA after a narrower defeat at the 3rd HoC vote, with some suggestions that the tide has turned back against the proposal. Cable has now filled bids said to be sitting from 1.2710-15 and any psychological buying interest at 1.2700 to hit 1.2686 vs the mid-January trough at 1.2670 that came with the failure of MV1, while Eur/Gbp has tested resistance ahead of the 200 DMA circa 0.8790 or 1.1375 in Sterling terms.</p><p>EUR/CHF/JPY - Also weaker vs a broadly firm Dollar as the DXY edges back above the 98.000 level to probe recent peaks and resistance spanning the 98.030-120 area ahead of this year’s high at 98.346. The single currency has slipped through bids that held on Monday at 1.1150, but not further towards support at 1.1135 or the 1.1112 ytd low, while the Franc is back on the 1.0100 pivot and Yen has retreated from its 100 HMA (109.80) to retest support at 110.31 (Fib and recent low).</p><p>EM - Another day in the spotlight for the Lira as the Government and CBRT maintain efforts to curtail speculative flows and restore investor confidence in the face of more evidence that sentiment is weak on economic, fiscal, political and diplomatic grounds. Indeed, Turkish consumer morale has fallen sharply in May and Usd/Try has bottomed around 6.0000 yet again even though FX transaction settlements for non-corporate retail deals in Usd100k or above have been brought forward from spot to plus one day and the CBRT has reinstated 1 week repos and cut swap rates by 150 bp to 24%.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Gilts are not gleaning any extra traction from a weaker than forecast CBI industrial trends survey, but are still holding up better than core bound counterparts in the ongoing state of Brexit bewilderment having extended their rebound to 128.86 at one stage (+17 ticks vs -16 ticks at the early Liffe low). Meanwhile, Bunds have retreated back below par after a similar bounce topped out at 166.90 (+11 ticks vs -18 ticks at worst) and US Treasuries remain relatively flat and mid-range ahead of US existing home sales data and more Fed speak.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>A relatively choppy session thus far in the energy complex as WTI (+0.1%) futures are meanders just under USD 63.50/bbl whilst Brent (Unch) swings between gains and losses on either side of USD 72.00/bbl. News flow has been light in the sector ahead of tonight’s API crude inventories release with forecasts for a headline crude drawdown of 1.9mln barrels whilst distillates are expected to decline by 600k barrels. Turning to OPEC, following yesterday’s delay to the 25/26th June OPEC/OPEC+ meetings, Energy Intelligence notes that there are talks of a JMMC and JTC meeting on July 1st and 2nd ahead of an OPEC/OPEC+ meeting on July 3rd-4th. Nothing is yet confirmed. Elsewhere, Russian press noted that oil transit from Russian oil transit towards the EU has now resumed following the contaminated oil at the Ust-Luga port. In terms of metals, gold (-0.2%) prices remain subdued as the Dollar index gains more ground above 98.000. Meanwhile, copper prices are relatively flat amid the indecisive risk tone. Finally, aluminium futures (-1.5%) slump after a federal court in Brazil lifted a production embargo at Hydro’s Alunorte refinery which would see the a ramp-up in production from 50% to 75-80% within two months.</p>",

(Times)</p><p>FX</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>DXY</strong> was flat and remained near the 98.00 level amid a lack of key data and as a slate of Fed speakers failed to drive price action including Fed Chairman Powell, while its major counterparts were muted with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> rangebound at the 1.1100 and 1.2700 handles respectively. GBP has stalled near the prior day’s lows amid Brexit woes, while there were also conflicting reports regarding potential indicative votes which some suggested were 100% dead and buried with efforts now centred on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and how to get MPs on board. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was higher after having rebounded from support at its 100 hourly MA line at 109.80 and reclaimed the 110.00 level, while antipodeans were choppy with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> initially underpinned after the APRA proposal on mortgage lending which analysts suggest could alleviate pressure for the RBA to lower rates. However, <strong>AUD</strong> was later pressured following a dovish perceived minutes release in which the central bank stated that an interest rate cut would be appropriate if there is no further improvement in the labour market and suggested that the outlook would be less favourable without policy easing over the next 6-months, while comments from RBA Governor Lowe supported the prospects for a looming cut as he stated the board will consider lowering rates at the next policy meeting and suggested that monetary policy can help achieve lower unemployment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RBA Governor Lowe said the board will consider lowering rates at the June policy meeting and that they need further improvement in labour market as well as unemployment to decline below 5%.</strong> Governor Lowe also commented that recent data makes it less likely that the labour market will surprise to the upside and that forecasts for growth and jobs would have been weaker without the assumption of rate cuts, while he later added that they do have an easing bias and that APRA changes to mortgage rules would be complementary to a rate cut but do not have direct implications on rate policy. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RBA Minutes from May 7th meeting stated that interest rate cut would be appropriate if no further improvement in the labour market</strong> and that it is important to pay close attention to the jobs market over the period ahead. The minutes also noted that the outlook would be less favourable without an easing in policy over the next 6-months and that Q1 inflation is noticeably lower than anticipated. (Newswires)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commodities saw muted price action overnight amid a predominantly mixed risked tone for most of the Asia session with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures marginally higher and back above the USD 63.00/bbl level amid ongoing tensions between US and Iran. Furthermore, the consensus remains for the OPEC+ output agreement to be rolled over at the next meeting although reports have suggested that officials are considering delaying the Vienna meeting from June 25th to early July. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> remained near its lowest levels in more than 2 weeks as the DXY held firm around the 98.00 level, while <strong>copper</strong> found mild support from the outperformance in China.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>US President Trump said Iran has been very hostile and that the US will conduct talks with Iran when they are ready. Furthermore, Trump stated that Iran will be making a very big mistake if it did anything which would be met with great force, but also commented there is no indication they are, while Iranian President Rouhani said he favours talks and diplomacy, although under current conditions he will not accept it. (Newswires/IRNA)&nbsp;</p><p>US</p><p>Overnight, a better than expected Japanese GDP report for Q1 lent negative ticks in the Treasury complex, and while buyers stepped in at the European open, following more global trade tensions related news flow, the positive start for European equities capped the Treasury upside, and futures were flat as NY entered. The complex then began its gradual drift lower, and are heading into APAC lower, led by the belly; major curve spreads were mixed into the close, but moves were +/- 1bps or so. US T-Note futures settled ticks 6+ lower at 124-09.</p><p><strong>Fed Chair Powell (Voter, Neutral)</strong> said wages are increasing in the context of muted inflationary pressures and vulnerabilities are more closely watched than before the crisis. Powell added that debt levels could stress borrowers if economy weakens but sees business lending risks as moderate and noted the business sector is healthy with debt servicing costs low relative to income. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Williams (Voter, Neutral)</strong> said policy makers ought to maintain a strong labour market and keep inflation low, while he added that he wants to maintain the expansion and has changed view on how low unemployment can get without sparking inflation pressures.

ASX 200 (+0.2%) was initially weighed by underperformance in the tech sector but then recovered on expectations for a rate cut next month and with strength in financials after APRA proposed amending guidance on mortgage lending which could raise the maximum borrowing capacity for individuals, while Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) was subdued and failed to benefit from a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.5%) were higher with sentiment underpinned following a CNY 80bln liquidity injection by the PBoC and after the US provided some temporary relief for Huawei and other entities in order to maintain their existing networks. However, Huawei’s founder seemed less than impressed as he stated the US reprieve does not mean much for Huawei and that no one will be able to catch up with it on 5G technology for the next 2-3 years. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat despite the lacklustre tone in Japan and after the BoJ’s Rinban announce for over JPY 1.2tln of JGBs also failed to spur prices.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia trades mixed with the region cautious following the negative lead from Wall St where the major indices were dragged lower as the tech sector suffered the brunt of ongoing US-China tensions, although equity index futures have pared some of the losses after hours as the US provided temporary relief for Huawei. ASX 200 (-0.2%) is weighed by underperformance in the tech sector but with downside limited by strength across financials after APRA proposed amending guidance on mortgage lending which could raise the maximum borrowing capacity for borrowers, while Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) is subdued by trade uncertainty despite a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.4%) are higher with sentiment underpinned following a CNY 80bln liquidity injection by the PBoC and after US provided some relief for Huawei in which it announced a 90-day temporary general licence for the Co. and 68 other entities to maintain existing networks. However, Huawei’s founder seemed less than impressed as he stated the US reprieve does not mean much for Huawei and that no one will be able to catch up with it on 5G technology for the next 2-3 years.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat and remains near the 98.00 level amid a lack of key data and as a slate of Fed speakers failed to drive price action including Fed Chairman Powell, while its major counterparts were muted with EUR/USD and GBP/USD rangebound at the 1.1100 and 1.2700 handles respectively, with the latter stalling amid Brexit woes. There were also conflicting reports regarding potential indicative votes which some suggested were 100% dead and buried with efforts now centred on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and how to get MPs on board. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is higher after having rebounded from support at its 100 hourly MA line near at 109.80 and reclaimed the 110.00 level, while antipodeans are choppy with AUD/USD initially underpinned after the APRA proposal on mortgage lending which analysts suggest could alleviate pressure for the RBA to lower rates. However, gains in AUD were later pared following a dovish perceived minutes release in which the central bank stated that an interest rate cut would be appropriate if there is no further improvement in the labour market and suggested that the outlook would be less favourable without policy easing over the next 6-months, while focus turns to a looming speech from RBA Governor Lowe.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat despite the risk averse tone in Japan and as the BoJ’s Rinban announce for over JPY 1.2tln of JGBs also failed to spur prices.</p>",

The RBA commented it will pay close attention to labour market in approaching meetings and there is still spare capacity in the economy.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, RBA stated the labour market remains strong and there has been some pick up in in wages growth with some lift also expected. However, it also noted that Q1 inflation data was noticeably lower than expected and main domestic uncertainty remains around household spending as well as falling house prices.</p><p>In terms of the reaction from the meeting, there was an initial knee-jerk reaction to the upside for AUD/USD given the expectations of a near coin toss heading into the decision, while the statement also suggested a data dependent approach.</p>",
