SPX +0.67% at 2834, NDX +0.80% at 7379, DJI +0.82% at 25929.</p><p>At settlement, major curve spreads had narrowed by between 1bps (2s5s) and 4bps (2s30s). Profit taking was cited in APAC trade, while the trade optimism chestnut was also cited. An attempt at a move higher in European trade ran out of steam, but did see some upside after PCE data was released (deflator saw the first decline since March 2017). There was also demand inspired by Brexit uncertainty, as well US President Trump firing barbs at Mexico on Twitter, and then subsequently in remarks. The curve remained flatter into the close, and traders will be focussed on Monday’s liquidity impact from SOMA day. US T-note futures (M9) settled 9 ticks lower at 124-07.</p>",
