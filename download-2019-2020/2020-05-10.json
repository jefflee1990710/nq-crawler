In related news, NEC Director Kudlow stated that formal talks on next stimulus package are paused and wont resume till late-May or early June, while prior reports noted that the White House hopes to have a Phase 4 Covid-19 stimulus package soon and encourages the House of Representatives to reconvene. (Newswires)</p><p>EU is to extend the external border closure for 30 more days and the Spanish government reportedly stopped Madrid region from easing lockdown, according to local press. (Newswires)</p><p>UK PM Johnson outlined a conditional 3-step plan to reopen the economy in which the stay at home message was adjusted to stay alert, control the virus and save lives although he added this was not a plan to end lockdown this week but instead were the first careful steps to modify measures. The first step is a change of emphasis from the governmentâ€™s advisory to work from home if you can and only go to work if you must, to those that cannot work from home should be actively encouraged to go to work but should avoid public transport if possible as social distancing must be maintained. PM Johnson added they may be able to begin a phased reopening of shops and schools under step 2 which will be on June 1st at the earliest, while some of the hospitality industry and other public places will be able to reopen in step 3 at the earliest by July subject to conditions. Furthermore, UK PM Johnson unveiled a 5-level Covid alert system with 5 being the most critical level and suggested we are currently at level 4 but are in a position to begin a move to step 3. PM Johnson also stated that he will provide more details regarding his announcement on Monday in Parliament and that they will impose a quarantine on people flying in from abroad. (Newswires)</p><p>Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were reported to reject UK PM Johnsonâ€™s stay alert slogan with Scotlandâ€™s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stating she will continue to use the â€˜stay at homeâ€™ message to tackle the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland. Furthermore, Wales reportedly extended the lockdown period for another 3-week period last week with three modifications which are that exercise can be more than once a day, garden centres can be reopened, while they are looking at reopening libraries and recycling centres. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>US President Trump said he is having a hard time with China in regard to the deal and has not made any decision yet on China, while there were comments from the US Chamber of Commerce which called on China to dramatically accelerate purchases of US goods under the Phase One trade deal as the economy in China returns to normality. (Newswires)</p><p>NEC Director Kudlow said the relationship with China is complex and that China has not been transparent, while he added that China will be held accountable when final results come in. (Newswires)</p><p>PBoC said China faces unprecedented economic challenges from the coronavirus and that they will resort to more powerful policies to address the impact to economic growth. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>UK ministers are expected to extend the job retention scheme until end-September although at a reduced rate of 60% in which Chancellor Sunak could announce the changes to the furlough scheme as early as this Monday. (Telegraph)</p><p>UK is drawing up plans to bypass the French port of Calais by developing ports on the UK's East Coast which is said to be due to COVID and Brexit, as well as reduce dependence on France. (FT)</p><p>ECB President Lagarde said ECB will play its full part within its mandate and emphasised that there should be no undue constraints on ECB policy response. Largarde noted that bank lending was the largest on record in March and that government financing may need to exceed 10% of GDP this year. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB has asked staff to study if the Central Bank should purchase junk Corporate Bonds to fight the COVID-19 fallout, with policymakers said to be under pressure to mimic the Fed on junk debt but doubts remain, according to sources. (Newswires)</p><p>French Finance Minister said the Eurogroup have reached a deal on a EUR 240bln Treasury line for countries that wish it and that ESM credit line will be operational on June 1st, while reports also noted ESM coronavirus credit line loan is to be for up to 10-years maturity. (Newswires)</p><p>German Finance Minister Scholz in Eurogroup meeting that he was confident there would be a solution to allow the Bundesbank to keep buying bonds after the three month deadline, while he insisted this was a German and not an ECB issue to be dealt with. (FT)</p><p>Italian PM Conte said EU aid is insufficient and recovery fund is needed.

(Newswires)</p><p>White House Economic Adviser Hassett said if Fed push rates negative, he would support it, but added that he respects the Fed's independence. Furthermore, Hassett also commented that the payroll tax cuts would only be present in the next package, while he suggested that next month's unemployment rate is likely to be higher and could be around 20%-25%.

Ford (F) announced it is aiming to begin its phased restart in North America from May 18th; it was also downgraded to junk at Fitch. Walt Disney Company (DIS) announced it is to reopen its Disney Springs in the US in a phased manner from May 20th; it also sold out of all its Shanghai reopening Disneyland tickets. Microsoft (MSFT) reported that Amazon (AMZN) has filed another protest of its USD 10bln JEDI contract with the Department of Defence, although the complaint is confidential therefore MSFT is unaware of the details. JPMorgan (JPM) in a 10Q filing restated its NII guidance (revised higher) and cut its expense guidance; it now sees FY20 NII to be around USD 56bln, and adjusted expenses sub USD 65bln in FY20; Q2 NII view at around USD 14bln. SPX +1.68% at 2929, NDQ +1.30% at 9220, DJIA +1.91% at 24331.</p><p>The TPLEX endured an erratic session as participants digested a less-dire-than-expected NFP print â€“ albeit still a record slump â€“ as well as another push towards NIRP. The T-Note had been modestly firming overnight before it legged lower on the release of the NFP report, amid a wider risk on environment. However, the losses in the TPLEX soon reversed course not long after the cash equity open, led by another rally in short rates, which saw shorter maturity Fed Funds futures move above par, seeing the 2-year yield print a new all-time low of 10.5bps. The sharp move lower pared heading into the latest NY Fed USTs purchases schedule announcement, which saw the Fed taper its daily purchases to around USD 7bln per day from around USD 8bln. Looking at the changes within the buckets, it kept its long-end purchases unchanged (20- to 30-year) but made the largest proportion of cuts at the front-end â€“ perhaps to counter the recent leg lower in front-end yields towards NIRP as well as addressing recent steepening post the Treasury quarterly refunding announcement. Following the updated schedule release, yields continued to edge higher, to which by settlement, all yields along the curve had risen on the session: 2s +2.5bps at 0.15%, 5s +3bps at 0.33%, 10s +5bps at 0.68%, 30s +7bps at 1.39%. US T-note futures (M0) settled 11 ticks lower at 138-30+.</p>",
