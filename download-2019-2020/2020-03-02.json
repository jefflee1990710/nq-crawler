We also have slightly more clarity on the Democrat nomination race, with Buttigieg and Klobuchar dropping out, and both set to endorse former VP Biden, adding further momentum to the centrist’s campaign after his victory in South Carolina and ahead of Super Tuesday. Meanwhile, on the data slate, US ISM manufacturing did not collapse, although some of the forward-looking metrics are a cause for concern. The European PMIs have also held up better than feared. While stocks have rallied, including a late session ramp, some note that bonds are not sharing this optimism, after yields dropped to fresh record lows (10s saw a low around 1.03%, while 30s saw yields plunge to 1.58%); analysts at Goldman Sachs noted that it is quite telling given that stocks are yielding over 2.0% though investors are still lending the US government money for 10-years at just 1%; the bank also observed that the composition of the equity rally was hardly pro-cyclical, given that (at pixel time) gains are being led by the defensive utilities and staples sectors, with energy and industrials at the bottom of the pack. Apple (AAPL) marched indices higher amid an Oppenheimer upgrade, with confidence on its strong balance sheet amid wider risk aversion, as well as wider appetite for the heavyweight. Tesla (TSLA) gapped higher on the open after weekend reports of Elliott building a stake and looking to remove CEO Dorsey. JD.com (JD) surged on a strong Q4 report; note also it announced a CFO change. Gilead (GILD) made solid gains amid its efforts to accelerate its potential coronavirus treatment, as well as acquiring Forty Seven (FTSV) for USD 4.9bln, where the latter spiked violently higher. Cruise liners’ (NCLH, CCL, RCL) woes deepened after Japanese competitor Luminous Cruise filed for bankruptcy as coronavirus weighs down demand. Verizon (VZ) was supported by an upgrade at Cowen and a positive mention in Barron’s. Airlines (UAL, AAL) were offered as more and more flight cancellations are made due to falling demand. SPX +4.58% at 3090, NDX +4.92% at 8878, DJIA +5.10% at 26,704.</strong></p><p><strong>The curve bull-steepened, with yields on 10s and 30s finding fresh record lows (1.03% and 1.58% respectively). Desks had also observed the interesting dynamic that Treasuries still caught a hefty bid despite risk-bouncing back after monetary and fiscal policymakers tried to assure markets with talk of support. A big part of that might be a result of dovish central bank pricing, with the implied probability of rate cuts getting boosted among major central banks. In fact, pricing was a source of interest, given that the market is nearly priced for nearly three rate cuts by the Fed's meeting on 18th March, while pricing through the end of the year now has four rate cuts pencilled in. Whether the Fed can deliver on those expectations remains to be seen, although a key focus will be Tuesday's term repo operations (which have seen oversubscriptions in recent offerings) given that the cost of borrowing overnight rose to 1.80% on Monday (above the top-end of the federal funds rate target range between 1.50-1.75%) from 1.65% on Friday. Some speculate that the Fed could tweak its offerings as an immediate way of stemming the tightening in financial conditions. US T-note futures (H0) settled 13+ ticks higher at 135-08+.</strong></p>",

We also have slightly more clarity on the Democrat nomination race, with Buttigieg and Klobuchar dropping out, and both set to endorse former VP Biden, adding further momentum to the centrist’s campaign after his victory in South Carolina and ahead of Super Tuesday. Meanwhile, on the data slate, US ISM manufacturing did not collapse, although some of the forward-looking metrics are a cause for concern. The European PMIs have also held up better than feared. While stocks have rallied, including a late session ramp, some note that bonds are not sharing this optimism, after yields dropped to fresh record lows (10s saw a low around 1.03%, while 30s saw yields plunge to 1.58%); analysts at Goldman Sachs noted that it is quite telling given that stocks are yielding over 2.0% though investors are still lending the US government money for 10-years at just 1%; the bank also observed that the composition of the equity rally was hardly pro-cyclical, given that (at pixel time) gains are being led by the defensive utilities and staples sectors, with energy and industrials at the bottom of the pack. Meanwhile, oil has been supported by prevailing sentiment, but it also seems that OPEC are likely to take action this week to further buttress markets (talk of Saudis taking up an additional cut of 400k, to bring the proposed total cut this week to 1mln bbls).</p><p><strong>* CO-ORDINATED POLICY RESPONSE: </strong>Late Friday, Fed Chair Powell, in unscheduled remarks, said the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity, and that the Fed was closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook, adding that it would use its \"tools\" and act as appropriate to support the economy. That was followed overnight by the BOJ, which in an emergency statement stated that it would provide ample liquidity and ensure stability in financial markets via repo operations -- the first since March 2016. German finance minister Scholz also said that, should the need arise, Germany has the means to act quickly and decisively to contain the virus, while Italy's economy minister announced EUR 3.6bln (0.2%/GDP) of fiscal measures. EU Commissioner Gentiloni has cast some doubt on the V-shape recovery narrative, however, stating that such a scenario might be optimistic; he also said the EU stood ready to use all policy tools to tackle the fallout from the virus. However, ECB officials have not replied to the call for support, and ECB's VP de Guindos, in addition to Governors Wunsch and Villeroy, have pushed-back on the notion the central bank would be providing any immediate support, although the usual pledges to support the economy in the event of a virus related downturn were churned out. De Guindos also confirmed that conversations had taken placed with other major central banks, given further credence to the notion of global policy coordination. Tomorrow, G-7 central bankers and finance ministers will hold a teleconference (12pmn GMT) to talk about coordinating a response to the coronavirus, sources reported. Whether policymakers will meet, exceed or disappoint market expectations (of beefy support) remains to be seen, however, some have already questioned how effective rate cuts will be to address the virus outbreak. Some have said it would at least lean back on any financial market tightening, while others suggest repo market accommodation may be more effective tool; in the latest reporting period, the GC rate had risen above the top-end of the Fed’s target range (Fed losing control of the short-end is an accusation from some traders), so there will also be attention on the Fed’s term repo operations on Tuesday (at the new reduced rate of USD 20bln), which have seen oversubscriptions in recent offerings. There is some speculation that the Fed could tweak the sizes of its operations, which may alleviate potential dollar liquidity pressures.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19 UPDATE: </strong>Cases continue to accelerate outside of China, and some think the trend may once again be accelerating within the nation, after it announced cases were up by 575 yesterday. The global death toll is now over 3k with around 90k of confirmed cases. Looking at trend rates, the total number of global cases rose by 2.5k on Sunday, almost double the 1.3k average daily rate over the previous five days; non-China cases were up by 1.8k yesterday, again around double of the five-day trend rate. There were also reports of new cases in several US states over the weekend (including the first death in the US), and some experts warn that a surge in US cases could easily overwhelm hospitals and exacerbate supply shortages. US Vice President Pence, who is heading up the US COVID-19 response, will be holding a media briefing at 1700 ET (2200 GMT). Ahead of that, the director of infectious diseases said the US was clearly dealing with an emerging infectious disease which has breached outbreak proportions and likely pandemic proportions.</p><p><strong>* US MANUFACTURING ISM: </strong>The headline ISM manufacturing PMI fell to 50.1 from 50.9, a bit deeper than the consensus 50.5. Prices dropped to 45.9 from 53.3 (consensus 51.0) while new orders dropped to 49.8 from 52.0. The survey has not yet captured the full fallout of the COVID outbreak, analysts said, and the report was dismissed by traders as stale, with barely any reaction in wake of the release. The employment sub-index picked up to 46.9 from the consensus expectation for an unchanged 46.6; earlier, Markit had said that its own version of the manufacturing PMI was consistent with manufacturing payrolls contracting by 20k jobs per month. \"Overall, the ISM index broadly supports the other manufacturing surveys in suggesting that while the coronavirus lockdown in China was starting to have a knock-on impact on US firms via supply chain disruption, that hit has so far been relatively modest,\" Capital Economics said, \"but with the virus continuing to spread around the world and a more serious outbreak within the US now looking increasingly likely, the disruption is likely to worsen over the coming weeks.\"</p><p><strong>* US CONSUTRUCTION SPENDING: </strong>Construction spending rose 1.8% M/M in January, topping the consensus +0.6%, for the largest monthly rise since Feb 2008. The prior data also saw a healthy upward revision, which Pantheon Macroeconomics thinks will lift Q1 GDP tracking estimates, even though the COVID19 is weighing on expectations. \"Most of the January action was in private homebuilding, but non-residential spending rose 0.8% too and state and local government construction jumped 2.0%,\" Pantheon wrote, \"the construction sector, at least, 2020 got off to a flying start.\"</p><p><strong>* PMI DATA: </strong>In China, the Caixin PMI in China fell to a record low, while the official manufacturing PMI also fell to a record low, and sunk at its fastest pace ever (for now, some are still placing faith in a bounce-back in the second part of the year if the virus can be contained soon, as evidenced in the future orders component within the PMI; but the labour market metrics slipped, which will take longer to normailise, while outside-China situation is worsening, clouding future foreign demand, and questioning the 'v-shape' narrative).</p><p><strong>* COMING UP - RBA: </strong>RBA is largely expected to cut its Cash Rate to a new record low of 0.50%. Expectations for the RBA to cut have been bolstered by the dismal Chinese PMIs and volatile Fed pricing. However, rhetoric from the RBA had suggested the Central Bank is prepared to ease if needed although they are unlikely to do so just yet as was reiterated in their last meeting. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23988/download\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* COMING UP - SUPER TUESDAY: </strong>Former VP Joe Biden's bid to become the Democrat Presidential nominee got a shot of life, with Biden coming out on top in the South Carolina primaries, a state with a large ethnic minority. Pete Buttigieg has dropped out of the race, after his campaign did not build on early momentum. Buttigieg did not endorse another candidate immediately, although he will reportedly do so later on Monday; meanwhile, Klobuchar has also dropped out, and has endorsed Biden – analysts have suggested that these developments will, all things being equal, benefit Biden. FiveThirtyEight had earlier suggested that supporters of Buttigieg would likely send support of around 21% to Sanders, around 19% to Biden or Warren, and around 17% to Bloomberg. Billionaire Tom Steyer has also dropped out, although it makes little difference in the grand scheme of things. Some desks are also talking about a Biden/Kamale Harris ticket (Harris dropped out of the race early).</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLED 1.99 HIGHER AT USD 46.75; BRENT (K0) SETTLED 2.23 HIGHER AT USD 51.90: </strong>Crude markets, alongside other risk assets (read equities), made gains as US participants returned on Monday. Following the turmoil of risk appetite in the prior week, traders are now weighing if the knife has finished falling or whether we have found temporary support as oil demand could face a large shock. The growing expectations of coordinated central bank easing, alongside fiscal policy, is also likely bringing some impetus behind the bid. Furthermore, ahead of the OPEC+ meeting on March 5th/6th, Russia's Energy Minister Novak said Russia did not get a proposal from OPEC to jointly cut production by 1mln BPD and is instead evaluating the earlier JTC proposal of a 600k BPD cut. Later WSJ reports suggested Saudi Arabia plans to offer OPEC+ an additional group cut of 600k BPD, with itself cutting an 400k BPD. Interestingly, Russian corporate Lukoil later said that it expects OPEC+ to cut its output by more than 1mln BPD, although gave little further details – coming after an earlier meeting between Russia’s Kremlin and corporates ahead of the OPEC+ meeting. Elsewhere, a Reuters survey showed OPEC February oil output falling 510k BPD M/M to 27.84mln BPD, with compliance at 128% (prev. 133% in Jan), amid Libyan unrest and new supply cut deal. Looking ahead to this week’s energy inventories in the US, current expectations (bbls): crude +3.3mln, gasoline -2.1mln, distillates -1.8mln; while Genscape flyover sees Cushing stocks -1.5mln.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 13+ TICKS HIGHER AT 135-08+. </strong>The curve bull-steepened, with yields on 10s and 30s finding fresh record lows (1.03% and 1.58% respectively). Desks had also observed the interesting dynamic that Treasuries still caught a hefty bid despite risk-bouncing back after monetary and fiscal policymakers tried to assure markets with talk of support. A big part of that might be a result of dovish central bank pricing, with the implied probability of rate cuts getting boosted among major central banks. In fact, pricing was a source of interest, given that the market is nearly priced for nearly three rate cuts by the Fed's meeting on 18th March, while pricing through the end of the year now has four rate cuts pencilled in. Whether the Fed can deliver on those expectations remains to be seen, although a key focus will be Tuesday's term repo operations (which have seen oversubscriptions in recent offerings) given that the cost of borrowing overnight rose to 1.80% on Monday (above the top-end of the federal funds rate target range between 1.50-1.75%) from 1.65% on Friday. Some speculate that the Fed could tweak its offerings as an immediate way of stemming the tightening in financial conditions.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX<strong> </strong>+4.58% at 3090, NDX +4.92% at 8878, DJIA +5.10% at 26,704. <strong>SECTORS:</strong> Cons Disc +3.5%, Cons Stpl +5.48%, Energy +2.95%, Financials +4.87%, Health +4.83%, Industrials +2.75%, Materials +4.15%, Real Estate +5.05%, Technology +5.7%, Communication Svs +3.59%, Utilities +5.86%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Apple (AAPL) marched indices higher amid an Oppenheimer upgrade, with confidence on its strong balance sheet amid wider risk aversion, as well as wider appetite for the heavyweight. Tesla (TSLA) gapped higher on the open after weekend reports of Elliott building a stake and looking to remove CEO Dorsey. JD.com (JD) surged on a strong Q4 report; note also it announced a CFO change. Gilead (GILD) made solid gains amid its efforts to accelerate its potential coronavirus treatment, as well as acquiring Forty Seven (FTSV) for USD 4.9bln, where the latter spiked violently higher. Cruise liners’ (NCLH, CCL, RCL) woes deepened after Japanese competitor Luminous Cruise filed for bankruptcy as coronavirus weighs down demand. Verizon (VZ) was supported by an upgrade at Cowen and a positive mention in Barron’s. Airlines (UAL, AAL) were offered as more and more flight cancellations are made due to falling demand.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The USD was sold amid risk-on conditions, with traders attributing much of the buck's fall to the strength of the EUR, where the single currency has once again retained the 1.1150 mark. The EUR gains were driven by supportive rhetoric from policymakers about the prospects of fiscal support to guard against any virus-led slowdown in the economy, while overnight demand for EURJPY was noted after the BOJ's message of support; rate differentials were also said to be playing a role, with US 10-year yields now flirting with 1%, while the long-end also saw fresh record lows Desks have talked about the EUR remaining a sell around the 1.12 area. AUD is off, despite activity currencies performing well in the risk-on environment, as pricing for rate cuts intensifies ahead of tonight's RBA meeting (25bps now expected), and while pricing for RBNZ rate cuts has also risen, the NZD is higher. Havens were also higher (USDJPY down, EURCHF down, XAU up, Treasuries up) amid talk of support from fiscal and monetary authorities, while traders still note that rate cuts will do little to improve the virus situation, which is continuing to spread outside of China. EMFX also took their cues from USD weakness, although the BRL trades weaker as more cases are reported. Commodity FX took its cue from the rally in crude prices, which has added over a couple of bucks in the front contracts. GBP could not catch a bid, however, with the EUR strength boosting EURGBP, while Brexit talks also make GBP a sell on rallies, desks have said.</p><p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Last week's upside was largely a result of EMFX carry unwinds. This week has started off on the front foot after supportive comments from both Eurozone (including Italy) and global policymakers about taking action to stem virus fallout. Desks noted demand for EURJPY overnight after the BOJ's announcement. That said, a few desks are still sceptical about the EUR's rally in an environment where global growth is impaired. JPM's strategists said they have a bias would be to fade rallies in the 1.1090-1.1130 zone; others have suggested selling rallies near 1.12.</p><p><strong>* AUD: </strong>After signs of global policy coordination to stem the fallout of COVID19, all eyes are on the RBA's meeting overnight, with money markets now looking for the central bank to cut rates by 25bps (desks have noted how quickly the cut pricing has gone up, given that it was still 50/50 after the recent mixed jobs data), and another cut is fully priced through the end of 2020. Reports have stated that the RBA, APRA and ASIC are holding an emergency meetings to discuss the contagion.</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>the UK and EU are now in the official trade negotiations window, and in a reminder of how tense negotiations will be, Bloomberg carried a storied suggesting that Brexit trade talks could break down in weeks, according to three sources. GBP vol has firmed up and Deutsche Bank suggests that risk reversals are pointing towards further GBP downside. The bank does not think the positioning will be a problem, given that the market is still holding a small long position, and flows after last Tuesday (the cut-off date for the positioning data) has been negligible on aggregate.</p>",

We also have slightly more clarity on the Democrat nomination race, with Buttigieg and Klobuchar dropping out, and both set to endorse former VP Biden, adding further momentum to the centrist’s campaign after his victory in South Carolina and ahead of Super Tuesday. Meanwhile, on the data slate, US ISM manufacturing did not collapse, although some of the forward-looking metrics are a cause for concern. The European PMIs have also held up better than feared. While stocks have rallied, including a late session ramp, some note that bonds are not sharing this optimism, after yields dropped to fresh record lows (10s saw a low around 1.03%, while 30s saw yields plunge to 1.58%); analysts at Goldman Sachs noted that it is quite telling given that stocks are yielding over 2.0% though investors are still lending the US government money for 10-years at just 1%; the bank also observed that the composition of the equity rally was hardly pro-cyclical, given that (at pixel time) gains are being led by the defensive utilities and staples sectors, with energy and industrials at the bottom of the pack. Meanwhile, oil has been supported by prevailing sentiment, but it also seems that OPEC are likely to take action this week to further buttress markets (talk of Saudis taking up an additional cut of 400k, to bring the proposed total cut this week to 1mln bbls).</p><p><strong>* CO-ORDINATED POLICY RESPONSE: </strong>Late Friday, Fed Chair Powell, in unscheduled remarks, said the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity, and that the Fed was closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook, adding that it would use its \"tools\" and act as appropriate to support the economy. That was followed overnight by the BOJ, which in an emergency statement stated that it would provide ample liquidity and ensure stability in financial markets via repo operations -- the first since March 2016. German finance minister Scholz also said that, should the need arise, Germany has the means to act quickly and decisively to contain the virus, while Italy's economy minister announced EUR 3.6bln (0.2%/GDP) of fiscal measures. EU Commissioner Gentiloni has cast some doubt on the V-shape recovery narrative, however, stating that such a scenario might be optimistic; he also said the EU stood ready to use all policy tools to tackle the fallout from the virus. However, ECB officials have not replied to the call for support, and ECB's VP de Guindos, in addition to Governors Wunsch and Villeroy, have pushed-back on the notion the central bank would be providing any immediate support, although the usual pledges to support the economy in the event of a virus related downturn were churned out. De Guindos also confirmed that conversations had taken placed with other major central banks, given further credence to the notion of global policy coordination. Tomorrow, G-7 central bankers and finance ministers will hold a teleconference (12pmn GMT) to talk about coordinating a response to the coronavirus, sources reported. Whether policymakers will meet, exceed or disappoint market expectations (of beefy support) remains to be seen, however, some have already questioned how effective rate cuts will be to address the virus outbreak. Some have said it would at least lean back on any financial market tightening, while others suggest repo market accommodation may be more effective tool; in the latest reporting period, the GC rate had risen above the top-end of the Fed’s target range (Fed losing control of the short-end is an accusation from some traders), so there will also be attention on the Fed’s term repo operations on Tuesday (at the new reduced rate of USD 20bln), which have seen oversubscriptions in recent offerings. There is some speculation that the Fed could tweak the sizes of its operations, which may alleviate potential dollar liquidity pressures.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19 UPDATE: </strong>Cases continue to accelerate outside of China, and some think the trend may once again be accelerating within the nation, after it announced cases were up by 575 yesterday. The global death toll is now over 3k with around 90k of confirmed cases. Looking at trend rates, the total number of global cases rose by 2.5k on Sunday, almost double the 1.3k average daily rate over the previous five days; non-China cases were up by 1.8k yesterday, again around double of the five-day trend rate. There were also reports of new cases in several US states over the weekend (including the first death in the US), and some experts warn that a surge in US cases could easily overwhelm hospitals and exacerbate supply shortages. US Vice President Pence, who is heading up the US COVID-19 response, will be holding a media briefing at 1700 ET (2200 GMT). Ahead of that, the director of infectious diseases said the US was clearly dealing with an emerging infectious disease which has breached outbreak proportions and likely pandemic proportions.</p><p><strong>* US MANUFACTURING ISM: </strong>The headline ISM manufacturing PMI fell to 50.1 from 50.9, a bit deeper than the consensus 50.5. Prices dropped to 45.9 from 53.3 (consensus 51.0) while new orders dropped to 49.8 from 52.0. The survey has not yet captured the full fallout of the COVID outbreak, analysts said, and the report was dismissed by traders as stale, with barely any reaction in wake of the release. The employment sub-index picked up to 46.9 from the consensus expectation for an unchanged 46.6; earlier, Markit had said that its own version of the manufacturing PMI was consistent with manufacturing payrolls contracting by 20k jobs per month. \"Overall, the ISM index broadly supports the other manufacturing surveys in suggesting that while the coronavirus lockdown in China was starting to have a knock-on impact on US firms via supply chain disruption, that hit has so far been relatively modest,\" Capital Economics said, \"but with the virus continuing to spread around the world and a more serious outbreak within the US now looking increasingly likely, the disruption is likely to worsen over the coming weeks.\"</p><p><strong>* US CONSUTRUCTION SPENDING: </strong>Construction spending rose 1.8% M/M in January, topping the consensus +0.6%, for the largest monthly rise since Feb 2008.

Desks had also observed the interesting dynamic that Treasuries still caught a hefty bid despite risk-bouncing back after monetary and fiscal policymakers tried to assure markets with talk of support. A big part of that might be a result of dovish central bank pricing, with the implied probability of rate cuts getting boosted among major central banks. In fact, pricing was a source of interest, given that the market is nearly priced for nearly three rate cuts by the Fed's meeting on 18th March, while pricing through the end of the year now has four rate cuts pencilled in. Whether the Fed can deliver on those expectations remains to be seen, although a key focus will be Tuesday's term repo operations (which have seen oversubscriptions in recent offerings) given that the cost of borrowing overnight rose to 1.80% on Monday (above the top-end of the federal funds rate target range between 1.50-1.75%) from 1.65% on Friday. Some speculate that the Fed could tweak its offerings as an immediate way of stemming the tightening in financial conditions.</p>",

Following the turmoil of risk appetite in the prior week, traders are now weighing if the knife has finished falling or whether we have found temporary support as oil demand could face a large shock. The growing expectations of coordinated central bank easing, alongside fiscal policy, is also likely bringing some impetus behind the bid. Furthermore, ahead of the OPEC+ meeting on March 5th/6th, Russia's Energy Minister Novak said Russia did not get a proposal from OPEC to jointly cut production by 1mln BPD and is instead evaluating the earlier JTC proposal of a 600k BPD cut. Later WSJ reports suggested Saudi Arabia plans to offer OPEC+ an additional group cut of 600k BPD, with itself cutting an 400k BPD. Interestingly, Russian corporate Lukoil later said that it expects OPEC+ to cut its output by more than 1mln BPD, although gave little further details – coming after an earlier meeting between Russia’s Kremlin and corporates ahead of the OPEC+ meeting. Elsewhere, a Reuters survey showed OPEC February oil output falling 510k BPD M/M to 27.84mln BPD, with compliance at 128% (prev. 133% in Jan), amid Libyan unrest and new supply cut deal. Looking ahead to this week’s energy inventories in the US, current expectations (bbls): crude +3.3mln, gasoline -2.1mln, distillates -1.8mln; while Genscape flyover sees Cushing stocks -1.5mln.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>Already hyped up March FOMC easing expectations have been marked even higher in wake of US manufacturing surveys showing a downward revisions to the headline PMI at 50.7 from a prelim 50.8, but more so when the ISM missed consensus at 50.1 and components like prices paid and new orders tumbled through the key 50.0 threshold. Indeed, -75 bp is now the minimum anticipated and the probability of a full point cut in the Fed Funds rate is nearing 25%, leaving the DXY hovering around 97.500, albeit off worst levels within a 98.087-97.296 range as currency markets continue to weigh up exactly how much and coordinated the global response to China’s coronavirus might be.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>The biggest beneficiaries of Dollar weakness, but both also gleaning traction from ECB speakers pushing back on an immediate reaction to the aforementioned COVID-19 outbreak given that the SNB will be influenced, though not beholden to any further easing/stimulus from the former. Eur/Usd has now reclaimed 1.1100+ status after breaching the 200 DMA (1.1098) and Usd/Chf has retreated through 0.9600 again as Eur/Chf hovers around 1.0650.</p><p><strong>AUD/JPY</strong></p><p>The next best G10s, as the Aussie draws momentum from a firmer Yuan and heightened perceptions that the PBoC and/or Chinese Government will be compelled to take more action following extremely dire PMIs. Aud/Usd is comfortably over 0.6500 as Usd/Cnh pares back from 7.0000 and attention turns to the RBA to see whether the OCR is lowered by 25 bp as unanimously anticipated – for a detailed preview of the policy meeting see the Newsquawk Research Suite. Meanwhile, the BoJ has already rolled out more QE as the number of nCoV cases and fatalities in Japan rises, but Usd/Jpy has bounced firmly within 107.00-108.57 parameters against the backdrop of significantly less risk aversion, albeit in very volatile trade overall at the start of the new week and month.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>Both narrowly mixed vs their US counterpart as the Kiwi marginally lagged its Aussie peer, but managed to hold above 0.6500 and 1.0500 respectively, while the Loonie defended 1.3400, partly due to a rebound in crude prices and pick up in Canada’s manufacturing PMI.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound has kicked off March on a weaker footing across the board amidst Brexit jitters going in to trade talks between the UK and EU, the publication of Britain’s mandate for negotiations with the US and as the BoE promised to take all steps needed to protect stability. Cable relinquished 1.2800 and Eur/Gbp climbed above 0.8700 to test offers/resistance ahead of the 200 DMA (0.8744) and Sterling never really recovered after a marginal downgrade to the UK manufacturing PMI.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Hectic Monday trade for many regional currencies amidst several swings in sentiment, manufacturing PMIs and for the Rub and Try ongoing efforts to resolve differences over Syria’s Idlib. However, the Zar took some solace from Eskom not experiencing rotational load-shedding today and consolidation/short covering after last week’s extreme depreciation and underperformance.</p>",

This saw US equity futures drop by as much as 3% although later recouped all their losses as markets found reprieve from the declining pace of China’s coronavirus cases and amid widespread anticipation of Central Bank measures including calls for the Fed to deliver a 50bps cut at this month’s meeting. ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) were mixed in which Australia suffered from its heavy exposure to China and with financials also weighed by expectations of a rate cut by the RBA tomorrow, while the Japanese benchmark staged a comeback helped by the BoJ which is to ensure liquidity through operations and offered to buy JPY 500bln of JGBs. Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+3.2%) were also positive despite the alarming Chinese PMI data in which both China’s Official and Caixin Manufacturing PMIs fell to record lows, as sentiment was underpinned by measures including China permitting SMEs to delay debt repayments and with construction stocks surging on anticipation of China rushing into infrastructure projects to offset the fallout to the economy from the outbreak. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded positive but were off their intraday highs as the turnaround in stocks eventually dampened safe-haven appetite, although JGBs still remained afloat after the BoJ declared it will ensure ample liquidity and received JPY 571bln of total bids for the aforementioned JPY 500bln offer.</p><p>PBoC set USD/CNY mid-point at 6.9811 vs. Exp. 6.9808 (Prev. 7.0066) PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

The European bellwether rose as much as 2.3% at the open before the optimistic sentiment faded during mid-trade with a lack of any fresh headlines to shadow the ongoing virus narrative. DAX 30 cash and futures briefly reclaimed 12k whilst the FTSE MIB (-3.1%) underperforms the region following another sharp rise in virus cases in the country alongside disappointing manufacturing PMI figures. Sector-wise, dropping yields see financials underperforming whilst defensives remain in firm positive territory amid the turnaround in sentiment. That said, energy and material names continue to benefit from the price action in the respective complexes. In terms of individual movers, Tesco (+2.0%) holds onto a bulk of its gains following a WSJ report that a Thai billionaire has secured USD 10bln in a bid to acquire Co’s Asian assets. SES (-17%) shares slumped to foot of the Stoxx 600 post-earnings despite noting that it sees no meaningful impact from coronavirus. Finally, Nokia (+1.6%) shares opened higher after Lundmark has been appointed as President and CEO of the Co.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The DXY has retreated even further amidst broad Greenback losses and growing speculation that the Fed will follow/front run other global Central Banks with decisive action to counter the nCoV epidemic. Indeed, expectations were stoked further by unexpected and unscheduled comments from Powell on Friday pledging to use ‘tools’ as required to support the US economy given risks posed by the aforementioned coronavirus outbreak. Rate cut pricing duly ramped up to 50 bp for the upcoming March FOMC and the index has now slipped below the 200 DMA (97.840) to a 97.693 low compared to 98.087 at best with little in the way left in terms of chart support ahead of 97.500.</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR/CAD/CHF/NZD/JPY -</strong> Although the RBA is widely tipped to shave its OCR by ¼ point overnight, the Aussie is benefiting from US and NZ underperformance, while gleaning extra traction from relative Yuan strength on the premise that Chinese PMIs were so bad that more stimulus is almost certain to be forthcoming. Indeed, Aud/Usd has rebounded strongly from even deeper sub-0.6500 lows to 0.6550+ at one stage, while Usd/Cnh is back down around 9.9600 and Nzd/Usd is hovering just under 0.6275 as Aud/Nzd pivots 1.0450. Elsewhere, the Loonie has pared losses from circa 1.3445 to around 1.3340 ahead of Canada’s manufacturing PMI, the Franc is eyeing 0.9600, but waning against the Euro ahead of 1.0625 as the single currency forges more pronounced gains across the board, Eur/Usd towards 1.1100 and Eur/Gbp approaching 0.8700. Last, but by no means least the Yen is holding within a wide 107.00-108.57 range after the BoJ’s own considerable efforts to combat the adverse economic impact of COVID-19.</p><p><strong>GBP/NOK/SEK</strong> - Sterling is bucking the overall trend, with Cable losing grip of another big figure handle at 1.2800 on the cusp of UK-EU trade talks that are not expected to go smoothly given well documented differences of opinion on key post-Brexit terms and conditions. However, a downgrade to the manufacturing PMI has also dented sentiment, in contrast to Norwegian and Swedish prints that both picked up pace from previous levels. Nevertheless, Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek are trading on a mixed footing circa 10.3800 and 10.5800 respectively.</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> In keeping with the divergence noted above, regional currencies are somewhat betwixt and between as euphoria over the prospect of concerted and/or coordinated action to spur global growth fades, while the Lira is still anxiously eyeing events in Syria where Turkish President Erdogan renews calls for Government forces to withdraw or face more military attacks.</p><p>Goldman Sachs sees 50bps cut from the Fed by March 18th and another 50bps cut in Q2, while it also sees most other G10 central banks lowering rates as well. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>An extremely lively start to the new week/month for debt markets, but ultimately more upside for Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries, with the former also deriving momentum from another downturn in BTPs following Italy’s fiscal package to offset the damage from nCoV. The 10 year benchmarks have been up to 178.38, 136.22 and 135-24+ respectively, as expectations continue to build for multi-pronged stimulus, but fail to sustain riskier assets and keep curves on a steepening trajectory overall. Ahead, final US Markit manufacturing PMI provides the appetiser for ISM.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent font-month futures</strong> have rebounded with a vengeance on the first trading session of the week as sentiment was bolstered amid hopes of monetary and fiscal intervention to deal with the fallout of the virus. Furthermore, OPEC will publish its latest output policy decision on March 6th as planned as per sources – with Russia seemingly on board for a unison response following comments from Russian President Putin. That being said, Putin caveated that the current oil prices are acceptable for Russia’s budget, whilst Kremlin stated the meeting with Russian oil companies were not aimed at taking any specific decision. Russia's Energy Minister Novak stated that Russia did not get a proposal from OPEC to jointly cut production by 1mln BPD and are evaluating the earlier JTC proposal of 600k BPD cut. Futures opened lower to the tune of over 2.5% amid dismal Chinese PMI figures coupled by surging nCoV cases, in which WTI found a base at ~USD 44/bbl before recoiling to a high of USD 46.70/bbl, whilst the Brent contract bounces from an intraday low of around USD 49.50/bbl and tested USD 52/bbl to the upside, although the contracts encountered some selling pressure in recent trade but remain in solid positive territory thus far. Ahead of the OPEC confab, ING believes that “anything that falls short of the OPEC+ Joint Technical Committee recommendation of 600Mbbls/d of additional cuts over 2Q20, and extending the current deal through to year-end, will be taken as bearish.” Meanwhile, BofA Global Research lowered their 2020 WTI and Brent price forecasts by USD 8/bbl each to USD 49/bbl and USD 54/bbl respectively. Elsewhere <strong>spot gold</strong> drifts higher as the original optimism seen around the market-place fades, with the yellow metal back on a 1600/oz handle from an intraday low of ~1575/oz. Elsewhere <strong>copper </strong>initially spiked higher on further hopes of China stimulus, with prices briefly topping 2.60/lb before waning back below the figure.</p><p><strong>Russia's Energy Minister Novak says Russia did not get a proposal from OPEC to jointly cut production by 1mln BPD, evaluating earlier JTC proposal of 600k BPD cut.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European stocks have given up their earlier gains [Eurostoxx 50 -1.3%] which initially emanated from Central Bank stimulus hopes given the concoction of dismal PMIs from China coupled with rising worldwide COVID19 cases. The European bellwether rose as much as 2.3% at the open before the optimistic sentiment faded during mid-trade with a lack of any fresh headlines to shadow the ongoing virus narrative. <strong>DAX 30 cash</strong> and<strong> futures</strong> briefly reclaimed 12k whilst the <strong>FTSE MIB (-3.1%)</strong> underperforms the region following another sharp rise in virus cases in the country alongside disappointing manufacturing PMI figures. Sector-wise, dropping yields see financials underperforming whilst defensives remain in firm positive territory amid the turnaround in sentiment. That said, energy and material names continue to benefit from the price action in the respective complexes. In terms of individual movers, Tesco (+2.0%) holds onto a bulk of its gains following a WSJ report that a Thai billionaire has secured USD 10bln in a bid to acquire Co’s Asian assets. SES (-17%) shares slumped to foot of the Stoxx 600 post-earnings despite noting that it sees no meaningful impact from coronavirus. Finally, Nokia (+1.6%) shares opened higher after Lundmark has been appointed as President and CEO of the Co.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The DXY has retreated even further amidst broad Greenback losses and growing speculation that the Fed will follow/front run other global Central Banks with decisive action to counter the nCoV epidemic. Indeed, expectations were stoked further by unexpected and unscheduled comments from Powell on Friday pledging to use ‘tools’ as required to support the US economy given risks posed by the aforementioned coronavirus outbreak. Rate cut pricing duly ramped up to 50 bp for the upcoming March FOMC and the index has now slipped below the 200 DMA (97.840) to a 97.693 low compared to 98.087 at best with little in the way left in terms of chart support ahead of 97.500.</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR/CAD/CHF/NZD/JPY </strong>- Although the RBA is widely tipped to shave its OCR by ¼ point overnight, the Aussie is benefiting from US and NZ underperformance, while gleaning extra traction from relative Yuan strength on the premise that Chinese PMIs were so bad that more stimulus is almost certain to be forthcoming. Indeed, Aud/Usd has rebounded strongly from even deeper sub-0.6500 lows to 0.6550+ at one stage, while Usd/Cnh is back down around 9.9600 and Nzd/Usd is hovering just under 0.6275 as Aud/Nzd pivots 1.0450. Elsewhere, the Loonie has pared losses from circa 1.3445 to around 1.3340 ahead of Canada’s manufacturing PMI, the Franc is eyeing 0.9600, but waning against the Euro ahead of 1.0625 as the single currency forges more pronounced gains across the board, Eur/Usd towards 1.1100 and Eur/Gbp approaching 0.8700. Last, but by no means least the Yen is holding within a wide 107.00-108.57 range after the BoJ’s own considerable efforts to combat the adverse economic impact of COVID-19.</p><p><strong>GBP/NOK/SEK </strong>- Sterling is bucking the overall trend, with Cable losing grip of another big figure handle at 1.2800 on the cusp of UK-EU trade talks that are not expected to go smoothly given well documented differences of opinion on key post-Brexit terms and conditions. However, a downgrade to the manufacturing PMI has also dented sentiment, in contrast to Norwegian and Swedish prints that both picked up pace from previous levels. Nevertheless, Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek are trading on a mixed footing circa 10.3800 and 10.5800 respectively.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - In keeping with the divergence noted above, regional currencies are somewhat betwixt and between as euphoria over the prospect of concerted and/or coordinated action to spur global growth fades, while the Lira is still anxiously eyeing events in Syria where Turkish President Erdogan renews calls for Government forces to withdraw or face more military attacks.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>An extremely lively start to the new week/month for debt markets, but ultimately more upside for <strong>Bunds</strong>, <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong>, with the former also deriving momentum from another downturn in BTPs following Italy’s fiscal package to offset the damage from nCoV. The 10 year benchmarks have been up to 178.38, 136.22 and 135-24+ respectively, as expectations continue to build for multi-pronged stimulus, but fail to sustain riskier assets and keep curves on a steepening trajectory overall. Ahead, final US Markit manufacturing PMI provides the appetiser for ISM.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> font-month futures have rebounded with a vengeance on the first trading session of the week as sentiment was bolstered amid hopes of monetary and fiscal intervention to deal with the fallout of the virus. Furthermore, OPEC will publish its latest output policy decision on March 6th as planned as per sources – with Russia seemingly on board for a unison response following comments from Russian President Putin. That being said, Putin caveated that the current oil prices are acceptable for Russia’s budget, whilst Kremlin stated the meeting with Russian oil companies were not aimed at taking any specific decision. Russia's Energy Minister Novak stated that Russia did not get a proposal from OPEC to jointly cut production by 1mln BPD and are evaluating the earlier JTC proposal of 600k BPD cut. Futures opened lower to the tune of over 2.5% amid dismal Chinese PMI figures coupled by surging nCoV cases, in which WTI found a base at ~USD 44/bbl before recoiling to a high of USD 46.70/bbl, whilst the Brent contract bounces from an intraday low of around USD 49.50/bbl and tested USD 52/bbl to the upside, although the contracts encountered some selling pressure in recent trade but remain in solid positive territory thus far. Ahead of the OPEC confab, ING believes that “anything that falls short of the OPEC+ Joint Technical Committee recommendation of 600Mbbls/d of additional cuts over 2Q20, and extending the current deal through to year-end, will be taken as bearish.” Meanwhile, BofA Global Research lowered their 2020 WTI and Brent price forecasts by USD 8/bbl each to USD 49/bbl and USD 54/bbl respectively. Elsewhere <strong>spot gold</strong> drifts higher as the original optimism seen around the market-place fades, with the yellow metal back on a 1600/oz handle from an intraday low of ~1575/oz. Elsewhere <strong>copper</strong> initially spiked higher on further hopes of China stimulus, with prices briefly topping 2.60/lb before waning back below the figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY </strong>has retreated even further amidst broad Greenback losses and growing speculation that the Fed will follow/front run other global Central Banks with decisive action to counter the nCoV epidemic. Indeed, expectations were stoked further by unexpected and unscheduled comments from Powell on Friday pledging to use ‘tools’ as required to support the US economy given risks posed by the aforementioned coronavirus outbreak. Rate cut pricing duly ramped up to 50 bp for the upcoming March FOMC and the index has now slipped below the 200 DMA (97.840) to a 97.693 low compared to 98.087 at best with little in the way left in terms of chart support ahead of 97.500.</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR/CAD/CHF/NZD/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although the RBA is widely tipped to shave its OCR by ¼ point overnight, the Aussie is benefiting from US and NZ underperformance, while gleaning extra traction from relative Yuan strength on the premise that Chinese PMIs were so bad that more stimulus is almost certain to be forthcoming. Indeed, Aud/Usd has rebounded strongly from even deeper sub-0.6500 lows to 0.6550+ at one stage, while Usd/Cnh is back down around 9.9600 and Nzd/Usd is hovering just under 0.6275 as Aud/Nzd pivots 1.0450. Elsewhere, the Loonie has pared losses from circa 1.3445 to around 1.3340 ahead of Canada’s manufacturing PMI, the Franc is eyeing 0.9600, but waning against the Euro ahead of 1.0625 as the single currency forges more pronounced gains across the board, Eur/Usd towards 1.1100 and Eur/Gbp approaching 0.8700. Last, but by no means least the Yen is holding within a wide 107.00-108.57 range after the BoJ’s own considerable efforts to combat the adverse economic impact of COVID-19.</p><p><strong>GBP/NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sterling is bucking the overall trend, with Cable losing grip of another big figure handle at 1.2800 on the cusp of UK-EU trade talks that are not expected to go smoothly given well documented differences of opinion on key post-Brexit terms and conditions. However, a downgrade to the manufacturing PMI has also dented sentiment, in contrast to Norwegian and Swedish prints that both picked up pace from previous levels. Nevertheless, Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek are trading on a mixed footing circa 10.3800 and 10.5800 respectively.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In keeping with the divergence noted above, regional currencies are somewhat betwixt and between as euphoria over the prospect of concerted and/or coordinated action to spur global growth fades, while the Lira is still anxiously eyeing events in Syria where Turkish President Erdogan renews calls for Government forces to withdraw or face more military attacks.</p>",

This saw US equity futures drop by as much as 3% although later recouped all their losses as markets found reprieve from the declining pace of China’s coronavirus cases and amid widespread anticipation of Central Bank measures including calls for the Fed to deliver a 50bps cut at this month’s meeting. ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) were mixed in which Australia suffered from its heavy exposure to China and with financials also weighed by expectations of a rate cut by the RBA tomorrow, while the Japanese benchmark staged a comeback helped by the BoJ which is to ensure liquidity through operations and offered to buy JPY 500bln of JGBs. Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+3.1%) were also positive despite the alarming Chinese PMI data in which both China’s Official and Caixin Manufacturing PMIs fell to record lows, as sentiment was underpinned by measures including China permitting SMEs to delay debt repayments and with construction stocks surging on anticipation of China rushing into infrastructure projects to offset the fallout to the economy from the outbreak.

This saw US equity futures drop by as much as 3% although later recouped all their losses as markets found reprieve from the declining pace of China’s coronavirus cases and amid widespread anticipation of Central Bank measures including calls for the Fed to deliver a 50bps cut at this month’s meeting. ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) were mixed in which Australia suffered from its heavy exposure to China and with financials also weighed by expectations of a rate cut by the RBA tomorrow, while the Japanese benchmark staged a comeback helped by the BoJ which is to ensure liquidity through operations and offered to buy JPY 500bln of JGBs. Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+3.1%) were also positive despite the alarming Chinese PMI data in which both China’s Official and Caixin Manufacturing PMIs fell to record lows, as sentiment was underpinned by measures including China permitting SMEs to delay debt repayments and with construction stocks surging on anticipation of China rushing into infrastructure projects to offset the fallout to the economy from the outbreak.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> weakened to below the 98.00 level as participants took their cue from recent comments by Fed Chair Powell that the Fed will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy which subsequently saw markets price in a 50bps cut at the March 18th meeting and Goldman Sachs now forecasts a total of 100bps of cuts by the Fed this year. As such, the greenback’s major counterparts have benefitted from the increased dovish Fed bets in which <strong>EUR/USD</strong> tested its 100-Day Moving Average of 1.1056 but with upside capped by a significant option expiry of EUR 1.7bln at 1.1050 for today’s New York Cut, while <strong>GBP/USD</strong> was relatively flat with the currency biding its time ahead of the UK and EU kick-starting post-Brexit trade talks today.

Another big rip higher in the TPLEX was led by the short end as virus concerns move the market’s expectations towards Fed accommodation, in addition to haven and month-end flows. The move higher came across the whole session, and found some additional pressure in the tail-end on the back of Powell’s remarks that the virus is an “evolving risk”, which some are alluding to as a shoe-in to a potential “material change to the outlook”. The rates market certainly believes the Fed won’t hold back, with 95bps of rate cuts now priced in for 2020, with 50bps expected for the March FOMC meeting – accompanied by excessive volume in rates futures. Additionally, desks draw attention to month-end rebalancing likely exacerbating the bid into duration from index buyers.

        "content": "<p>Asia bourses and US equity futures began the week volatile with hefty losses seen at the reopen as markets reacted to the abysmal Chinese Manufacturing PMI data over the weekend which slumped to below GFC levels and its weakest on record. This saw US equity futures drop by as much as 3% although later recouped all their losses as markets found reprieve from the declining pace of China’s coronavirus cases and amid widespread anticipation of central bank measures including calls for the Fed to deliver a 50bps cut at this month’s meeting. ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) were mixed in which Australia suffered from its heavy exposure to China and with financials also weighed by expectations of a rate cut by the RBA tomorrow, while the Japanese benchmark staged a comeback helped by the BoJ which is to ensure liquidity through operations and offered to buy JPY 500bln of JGBs. Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+3.1%) were also positive despite the alarming Chinese PMI data in which both China’s Official and Caixin Manufacturing PMIs fell to record lows, as sentiment was underpinned by measures including China permitting SMEs to delay debt repayments and with construction stocks surging on anticipation of China rushing into infrastructure projects to offset the fallout to the economy from the outbreak. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded positive but were off their intraday highs as the turnaround in stocks eventually dampened safe-haven appetite, although JGBs still remained afloat after the BoJ declared it will ensure ample liquidity and received JPY 571bln of total bids for the aforementioned JPY 500bln offer.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia bourses and US equity futures began the week volatile with hefty losses seen at the reopen as markets reacted to the abysmal Chinese Manufacturing PMI data over the weekend which slumped to below GFC levels and its weakest on record. This saw US equity futures drop by as much as 3% although later recouped all their losses as markets found reprieve from the declining pace of China’s coronavirus cases and amid widespread anticipation of central bank measures including calls for the Fed to deliver a 50bps cut this month. ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.4%) are mixed with Australia suffering from its heavy exposure to China and with financials also weighed by expectations of a rate cut by the RBA tomorrow, while the Japanese benchmark staged a comeback helped by the BoJ which stated it will ensure liquidity through operations and offered to buy JPY 500bln of JGBs. Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.6%) are also positive despite the alarming Chinese PMI data in which both China’s Official and Caixin Manufacturing PMIs fell to record lows, as sentiment is underpinned by measures including China permitting SMEs to delay debt repayments and with construction stocks surging on anticipation of China rushing into infrastructure projects to offset the fallout to the economy from the outbreak.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY has weakened to below the 98.00 level as participants took their cue from recent comments by Fed Chair Powell that the Fed will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy which subsequently saw markets price in a 50bps cut at the March 18th meeting and Goldman Sachs now sees a total of 100bps of cuts by the Fed this year. As such, the greenback’s major counterparts have benefitted from the increased dovish Fed bets with EUR/USD surmounting its 100-Day Moving Average of 1.1056 but with upside capped by a significant option expiry of EUR 1.7bln at 1.1050 for today’s New York Cut, while GBP/USD is relatively flat with the currency biding its time ahead of the UK and EU kick-starting post-Brexit trade talks today. Elsewhere, USD/JPY fluctuated back and forth of the 108.00 level owing to the JPY-risk dynamic and antipodeans have also recovered due to their high-beta properties with fireworks anticipated at tomorrow’s RBA meeting due to the recent shift in calls in which OIS now price in a 100% probability of a 25bps cut.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher but are off their intraday highs as the turnaround in stocks eventually dampened safe-haven appetite, although JGBs still remain afloat after the BoJ declared it will ensure ample liquidity and received JPY 571bln of total bids for the aforementioned JPY 500bln offer.</p>",
