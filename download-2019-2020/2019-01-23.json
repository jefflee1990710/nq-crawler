(Washington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Adviser Hassett said that 0% economic growth is possible in Q1 if the shutdown continues and that Q2 growth would be humongous if Government reopens, while he added that he is confident the US and China will reach a deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump&#39;s legislative affairs director and key White House figure in shutdown negotiations Shahira Knight is planning to leave the White House in the coming months, according to four sources familiar with her plans. (Politico)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IBM (IBM) surged 8% today after strong earnings, particularly in the cloud space, spreading optimism across the sector to Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco (CSCO), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) on the open. Other earnings reports saw Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG), Comcast (CMCSA) and United Technologies (UTX) all beat on top and bottom line estimates, seeing strong gains from the three heavyweights. On the flipside, Capital One (COF) and Rollins (ROL) nosedived after missing on top and bottom line estimates, Kimberly Clark (KMB) and Abbot Laboratories (ABT) opened lower on lower guidance. Synchrony Financial (SYF) surged after Walmart (WMT) agreed to drop its lawsuit after they came to an agreement to extend their relationship. Broker moves saw UBS on pharma stocks, where it upgraded Teva (TEVA) &ndash; causing it to outperform &ndash; and downgraded Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), who both underperformed. Tesla (TSLA) underperformed on the back of a downgrade at RBC, in addition to announcing a decrease in production. Qualcomm (QCOM) traded lower after activist investor Kerrisdale Capital posted research pointing to a downfall for the chipmaker. SPX +0.22% at 2639, NASDAQ +0.18% at 6659, DJI +0.7%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although volumes were better, it was another range-bound session for the Treasury complex. Overnight, news US/China talks were making progress helped spur selling, and when the US day got underway, some decent corporate earnings numbers offered support to risk assets, to the detriment of the T-Note. There was also some inspiration from the UK, where Gilts were sold on the hope that hard Brexit can be avoided. However, after the US cash equity open, stocks struggled to build on the optimism, and slid, which gave support to the T-Note. Major curve spreads were mixed, and generally +/- 1bps at settlement. US T-note futures (H9) settled 6 ticks lower at 121-12+.</p>\r\n",

He believes that the chance of a recession in 2020 is &quot;very, very close to zero&quot; and sees no risk of a credit downgrade for the US. On trade, he is confident that the US and China will reach a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>MPs are preparing to vote on a series of amendments which will determine the next steps of Brexit. There was mixed saying about the labour party backing the Cooper-Boles amendment which seeks to delay Article 50, preventing the UK leaving the EU without an agreement if PM May&rsquo;s revised deal is rejected by MPs. On the EU side, Chief Negotiator Barnier stressed that preparing for a no-deal is more important now than ever while he is open to several models of the future relationship; also, the EU Commission stated that they will do whatever they can to avoid a hard border in Ireland. In related comments, EU&rsquo;s Moscovici highlighted that the EU needs to have clarity from the UK on Brexit, noting that the best-case scenario is if the UK stays in the EU. Alongside this, a Brussels correspondent suggested that the EU stands ready to rework, rather than just renegotiate, the political declaration to facilitate a closer relationship if the UK is willing to shifts its red lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> South Korea&#39;s Foreign Minister said that the US-North Korea second summit will have to deliver concrete results on denuclearisation. Elsewhere, US President Trump released an official statement recognising Juan Guaido as Venezuela&#39;s interim President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BoE&#39;s Broadbent (Neutral) stated that the neutral interest rate will more likely rise than fall in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>BoC Governor Poloz noted that the Canadian economy is in good shape and emphasized the approach to policy is data dependent. He went on to say that if global trade tensions are resolved, it could lead to a boost in the Canadian economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADIAN RETAIL SALES</strong> fell to -0.9% from 0.3% in November and missed expectations of -0.6%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US RICHMOND FED </strong>posted at 6 in January, moderating from 10 in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G9) SETTLES USD 0.39 LOWER AT USD 52.62/BBL; BRENT (H9) SETTLES USD 0.33 LOWER AT USD 61.14/BBL.</strong> Markets were generally in a holding pattern on Wednesday, trading ranges. It allowed the crude complex to track risk sentiment, which was soggy, despite some upbeat corporate earnings that are doing little to suggest a recession in the coming quarters. Not even the apparent positive sentiment about the prospects of a US/China trade deal has helped. The general narrative this week has been around weakening global growth momentum, after the IMF cut its world growth view, while China&#39;s economy is demonstrating signs of a slowdown; of course, it is tough to get any accurate visibility on the state of the US economy at the moment, on account of the government shutdown delaying data releases. However, desks are again discussing the negative implications of the shutdown, with Barclays today trimming its Q1 growth view to 2.5% (from 3.0%). Perhaps oil traders will have some crude-specific fodder to focus on when the API releases inventory data after the bell on Wednesday: the Street expects crude stocks to draw 0.4mln, Cushing stocks to build by 0.7mln, distillates are seen drawing 0.8mln, while gasoline is expected to build by 2.5mln. Also on the radar: the US Administration has recognised Venezuela opposition leader Guaida as the interim President, and seems to be encouraging a coupe in the nation. While crude markets didn&#39;t bite, it will be a theme worth monitoring, since much of the nation&#39;s output issues may be resolved in the medium-term with a business-friendly government encouraging investment in oil infrastructure, and it is certainly a theme that could concern bigwigs at OPEC HQ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.22% at 2639, NASDAQ +0.18% at 6659, DJI 0.7% at 24576. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -1.00%, Materials -0.65%, Industrials +0.19%, Cons Discretionary +0.22%, Cons Staples +1.17%, Healthcare +0.12%, Financials +0.04%, Tech +0.42%, Telecoms +0.25%, Utilities +1.08%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>IBM (IBM) surged 8% today after strong earnings, particularly in the cloud space, spreading optimism across the sector to Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco (CSCO), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) on the open. Other earnings reports saw Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG), Comcast (CMCSA) and United Technologies (UTX) all beat on top and bottom line estimates, seeing strong gains from the three heavyweights. On the flipside, Capital One (COF) and Rollins (ROL) nosedived after missing on top and bottom line estimates, Kimberly Clark (KMB) and Abbot Laboratories (ABT) opened lower on lower guidance. Synchrony Financial (SYF) surged after Walmart (WMT) agreed to drop its lawsuit after they came to an agreement to extend their relationship. Broker moves saw UBS on pharma stocks, where it upgraded Teva (TEVA) &ndash; causing it to outperform &ndash; and downgraded Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), who both underperformed. Tesla (TSLA) underperformed on the back of a downgrade at RBC, in addition to announcing a decrease in production. Qualcomm (QCOM) traded lower after activist investor Kerrisdale Capital posted research pointing to a downfall for the chipmaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 6 TICKS LOWER AT 121-12+. </strong>Although volumes were better, it was another range-bound session for the Treasury complex. Overnight, news US/China talks were making progress helped spur selling, and when the US day got underway, some decent corproate earnings numbers offered support to risk assets, to the detrminet of the T-Note. There was also some inspiration from the UK, where Gilts were sold on the hope that hard Brexit can be avoided. However, after the US cash equity open, stocks struggled to build on the optimism, and slid, which gave support to the T-Note. Major curve spreads were mixed, and generally +/- 1bps at settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Not the most eventful session for the Dollar as the index fluctuated within a relatively tight 96.194-378 band throughout the day amid a lack of fresh catalysts as the monthly home price index and Richmond Fed index failed to provide any major impetus/pressure to the currency. Meanwhile, as the US government shutdown clock ticks to the 33rd day, Politico MM reported that a key White House figure in shutdown negotiations, Shahira Knight is planning to leave the White House in the coming months; according to four people familiar with her plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, EUR: </strong>A solid day of gains for the Pound as markets continue to pin hopes on a potential extension to Article 50 with support stacking up for the Copper amendment to give Parliament the power to delay the Brexit date. Labour reportedly told referendum campaigners that it is backing the Cooper-Boles amendment which seeks to take a no-deal Brexit off the table, in-fitting with Labour leader Corbyn&rsquo;s stance, though a Labour spokesman refused to confirm support for this amendment. Nonetheless GBP/USD continued to grind higher to test 1.3050 (vs. low 1.2950) ahead of its 200 DMA at 1.3081. Meanwhile, EUR remains flat within a tight 1.1350-75 band amid no catalysts ahead of the ECB interest rate decision tomorrow. Subsequently EUR/GBP lost further ground below 0.8750 to test the psychological 0.8700 level to the downside (vs. high 0.8780).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD: </strong>An overall positive day for the antipodeans, more so the Kiwi on the back of above-forecast inflation figures released overnight with the Y/Y figure just a shade below the RBNZ&rsquo;s 2% forecast. TD Securities notes that positive tradeable inflation (45% of CPI) rose at a reasonably steady rate of 0.9% Y/Y, while non-tradeable (55% of CPI) annual rate rose to the highest since mid-2014 at 2.7% Y/Y. As such, NZD/USD gained further ground above 0.6750 and tested the psychological 0.6800 at one point (vs. low of 0.6743). Meanwhile, the Aussie received tailwind from its antipodean counterpart and posted modest gains above 0.7120, reaching highs of 0.7143 (vs. low of 0.7118) ahead of Australian jobs data overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD:</strong> An unfortunate turn of events for the Loonie after dreary retail sales data resulted in the CAD fully paring earlier oil-induced gains. Shortly after the data, BoC Governor Poloz noted positivity surrounding the Canadian economy whilst reiterating the &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach. &ldquo;Current market expectations imply that a BoC hike this year is unlikely&rdquo; says ING, however in their view, &ldquo;the outlook is good enough to keep the CB in policy normalisation mode.&rdquo; USD/CAD was largely unreactive to Poloz as the pair hovered north of 1.3350, above its 50 DMA at 1.3346.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> The marked G10 laggard amidst a turn-around in risk sentiment as investors unwound positions and sought riskier assets. The weakness in the JPY can also be partially attributed to dovish comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda after the rate decision who emphasised that BoJ the will not hesitate to ease further if economic conditions deteriorate. CapEco highlights that though the CB can further unwind policy, the Board has been signalling that it could &ldquo;hamper banks&rsquo; willingness to lend and thus weaken rather than strengthen economic activity.&rdquo; Nonetheless, USD/JPY tested 110.00 to the upside (vs. low 109.33) as US participants entered the market ahead of the overnight flash release of the Japanese Nikkei manufacturing PMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: </strong>ECB Monetary Policy Decision Due At 12:45 GMT, (13:45 CET, 07:45 EST) On Thursday 24th January 2019, Press Conference Due At 13:30 GMT, (14:30 CET, 08:30 EST).Unanimous expectations look for the ECB to leave its three key rates unchanged. Will the central bank reiterate that risks are still titled to the downside? Participants will be mindful of any discussions on a further round of TLTROs. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20992/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Norges Bank Monetary Policy Decision Due at 09:00 GMT, 10:00 CET, 04:00EST, On Thursday 24th January 2019. Expectations unanimously are set on an unchanged rate of 0.75%, with focus set on the accompanying statement. HSBC cite lower global rate expectations as one of the major stumbling points for the Norges Bank&rsquo;s rate path. ING do not believe that this will be enough to stop the March hike amid recovering oil prices and the prosperous local economy. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20991/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n",

The general narrative this week has been around weakening global growth momentum, after the IMF cut its world growth view, while China&#39;s economy is demonstrating signs of a slow down; of course, it is tough to get any accurate visibility on the state of the US economy at the moment, on account of the government shutdown delaying data releases. However, desks are again discussing the negative implications of the shutdown, with Barclays today trimming its Q1 growth view to 2.5% (from 3.0%). Perhaps oil traders will have some crude-specific fodder to focus on when the API releases inventory data after the bell on Wednesday: the Street expects crude stocks to draw 0.4mln, Cushing stocks to build by 0.7mln, distillates are seen drawing 0.8mln, while gasoline is expected to build by 2.5mln. Also on the radar: the US Administration has recognised Venezuela opposition leader Guaida as the interim President, and seems to be encouraging a coupe in the nation. While crude markets didn&#39;t bite, it will be a theme worth monitoring, since much of the nation&#39;s output issues may be resolved in the medium-term with a business-friendly government encouraging investment in oil infrastructure, and it is certainly a theme that could concern bigwigs at OPEC HQ.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Pound powers through to two-month highs on Brexit delay hopes",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; Not the most eventful session for the Dollar as the index fluctuated within a relatively tight 96.194-378 band throughout the day amid a lack of fresh catalysts as the monthly home price index and Richmond Fed index failed to provide any major impetus/pressure to the currency. Meanwhile, as the US government shutdown clock ticks to the 33rd day, Politico MM reported that a key White House figure in shutdown negotiations, Shahira Knight is planning to leave the White House in the coming months; according to four people familiar with her plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP, EUR </strong>&ndash; A solid day of gains for the Pound as markets continue to pin hopes on a potential extension to Article 50 with support stacking up for the Copper amendment to give Parliament the power to delay the Brexit date. Labour reportedly told referendum campaigners that it is backing the Cooper-Boles amendment which seeks to take a no-deal Brexit off the table, in-fitting with Labour leader Corbyn&rsquo;s stance, though a Labour spokesman refused to confirm support for this amendment. Nonetheless GBP/USD continued to grind higher to test 1.3050 (vs. low 1.2950) ahead of its 200 DMA at 1.3081. Meanwhile, EUR remains flat within a tight 1.1350-75 band amid no catalysts ahead of the ECB interest rate decision tomorrow. Subsequently EUR/GBP lost further ground below 0.8750 to test the psychological 0.8700 level to the downside (vs. high 0.8780).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD, AUD</strong> &ndash; An overall positive day for the antipodeans, more so the Kiwi on the back of above-forecast inflation figures released overnight with the Y/Y figure just a shade below the RBNZ&rsquo;s 2% forecast. TD Securities notes that positive tradeable inflation (45% of CPI) rose at a reasonably steady rate of 0.9% Y/Y, while non-tradeable (55% of CPI) annual rate rose to the highest since mid-2014 at 2.7% Y/Y. As such, NZD/USD gained further ground above 0.6750 and tested the psychological 0.6800 at one point (vs. low of 0.6743). Meanwhile, the Aussie received tailwind from its antipodean counterpart and posted modest gains above 0.7120, reaching highs of 0.7143 (vs. low of 0.7118) ahead of Australian jobs data overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD </strong>&ndash; An unfortunate turn of events for the Loonie after dreary retail sales data resulted in the CAD fully paring earlier oil-induced gains. Shortly after the data, BoC Governor Poloz noted positivity surrounding the Canadian economy whilst reiterating the &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach. &ldquo;Current market expectations imply that a BoC hike this year is unlikely&rdquo; says ING, however in their view, &ldquo;the outlook is good enough to keep the CB in policy normalisation mode.&rdquo; USD/CAD was largely unreactive to Poloz as the pair hovered north of 1.3350, above its 50 DMA at 1.3346.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY </strong>&ndash; The marked G10 laggard amidst a turn-around in risk sentiment as investors unwound positions and sought riskier assets. The weakness in the JPY can also be partially attributed to dovish comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda after the rate decision who emphasised that BoJ the will not hesitate to ease further if economic conditions deteriorate. CapEco highlights that though the CB can further unwind policy, the Board has been signalling that it could &ldquo;hamper banks&rsquo; willingness to lend and thus weaken rather than strengthen economic activity.&rdquo; Nonetheless, USD/JPY tested 110.00 to the upside (vs. low 109.33) as US participants entered the market ahead of the overnight flash release of the Japanese Nikkei manufacturing PMI.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Gilt 10-year futures have fallen further into negative territory and underperform their German counterparts by almost 20 ticks as rumblings of Labour party support of the article-50-delaying Cooper-Boles amendment grow louder. The UK benchmark trades in close proximality to session lows of 122.36 ahead of the two-month low of 122.15. German 10-year futures were essentially unreactive to the new 2024 Bobl auction and have essentially traded flat over the past couple of hours just under 164.40. In the periphery, Bonos extended on the outperformance and printed new session peaks of 145.73 before easing back marginally to settle around the 145.50 area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the improving risk tone, helped along by some positive earnings from Dow constituents P&amp;G and United Technologies, continues to pressure futures across the curve with the majority of the action still in the longer end. US 10yr futures have extended on their downside to trade a shade below the 121-10 level ahead of the Richmond Fed manufacturing data.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, it was also reported that the US turned down China&rsquo;s offer for preparatory trade talks, which was later denied by NEC Director Kudlow. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-0.3%) was subdued with underperformance in the energy sector after crude prices slipped by over 2% and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) was dampened by disappointing trade data including the sharpest drop in exports since October 2016. However, sentiment in Tokyo was later propped up by a weaker currency, while Japan Display shares surged on reports it is in investment discussions with TPK and Silk Road Fund. Hang Seng (U/C) and Shanghai Comp. (U/C) conformed to the indecisiveness after mixed actions by the PBoC as it conducted a Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility for the first time ever which was at a lower rate than MLF rates and is aimed at spurring lending to small firms, but conversely refrained from reverse repo operations which resulted to a daily drain of CNY 350bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded sideways throughout most the session amid the indecisive risk tone in stocks and with participants side-lined prior to the BoJ policy announcement, but then saw&nbsp; choppy trade in reflection of sentiment in the region and following an unsurprising BoJ decision to keep policy setting unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped reverse repo operations for a net daily drain of CNY 350bln, although it conducted a CNY 257.5bln 1yr Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility with rate at 3.15% in its first use of TMLF vs 3.30% rate at last MLF. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7969 (Prev. 6.7854)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ kept monetary policy settings unchanged as expected with NIRP held at -0.1% and 10yr JGB yield target at around 0%. Furthermore, the BoJ extended its lending scheme for 1 year and stated that economic momentum for reaching price goal is sustained but lacking strength, while it added that risks to price and economic outlooks are skewed to the downside. BoJ reduced Real GDP forecasts for FY18 but raised Real GDP forecasts for FY19 and FY20, while it reduced Core CPI forecasts on all years through to FY20. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda says the downward revision to price outlook is due to the temporary decline in oil prices, Kuroda expects inflation to pick up towards the 2% target. Adding that downside risks from overseas are heightening due to US-China trade friction and European problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Japanese Trade Balance (JPY)(Dec) -55.3B vs. Exp. -29.5B (Prev. -737.7B). (Newswires)<br />Japanese Exports (Dec) Y/Y -3.8% vs. Exp. -1.9% (Prev. 0.1%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese Imports (Dec) Y/Y 1.9% vs. Exp. 3.7% (Prev. 12.5%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Axios reports &quot;A new immigration idea has been circulating over the past 24 hours at senior levels inside the White House and on Capitol Hill: Give a path to green cards to the 700,000 current DACA recipients, according to sources&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US BLS: The January 2019 Employment Situation will be published as scheduled on February 1, 2019, at 1330GMT/0830ET</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is reportedly set to force ministers to keep a no deal Brexit on the table despite threats of ministerial resignations. (Huffington Post) This has been seen as a defence mechanism against the Labour Party&rsquo;s potential support for the Cooper-Boles Brexit delay plan. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Tory party Brexiteers concerned about prospects of a delay, have suggested they could be won over if UK PM May can get a serious concession from the EU on backstop. (Guardian) Following this, ITV&#39;s Paul Brand tweets &quot;Jacob Rees-Mogg will say in a speech today that the backstop remains &ldquo;the one absolute obstacle&rdquo; to backing PM&rsquo;s deal BUT he&rsquo;s &ldquo;encouraged by signs of movement&rdquo;. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sun&#39;s Steve Hawkes reports &quot;Labour has told second referendum campaigners it is backing the Cooper-Boles Amendment&quot;. Has subsequently been confirmed by a Labour party source, stating it is &lsquo;highly likely&rsquo; they will back the amendment. (Twitter/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irish PM Varadkar said the UK and Ireland would have to negotiate a bilateral agreement on the full alignment of customs to avoid a hard border in the case of a no-deal Brexit. (The Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Trade Department said Trade Minister Fox is to discuss replicating EU trade agreement with ministers from around the world at Davos. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equities are mostly higher [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.2%], after recovering from opening losses, taking the lead from Wall Street. US stocks were affected by growth concerns, alongside subsequently denied reports that the US turned down an offer by two Chinese vice-ministers to attend preparatory trade talks in the US. Sectors have strengthened somewhat from their negative opening, and are now mixed with underperformance in energy names and outperformance in utilities. Tech names have been underperforming following ASML (-1.8%) cutting Q1 sales guidance, with the likes of STMicroelectronics (-1.4%) down in sympathy. Other notable movers include Carrefour (+6.7%) are at the top of the Stoxx 600 following earnings where they confirmed all targets for their 2022 transformation plan. Separately, RPC Group (+4.6%) are firmly in the green after recommending a final cash offering of GBP 7.82/shr; with Co&rsquo;s directors seeing the acquisition terms as fair and reasonable. In contrast, at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Ingenico (-13.2%) after reporting a FY18 EBITDA miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Relatively muted session for the Dollar thus far with the index hovering around the middle of a tight 96.268-378 range after NEC Director Kudlow dismissed reports that US turned down an offer from China for trade talks. The US government shutdown is now rolling onto its 33rd day, although there were reports overnight that US Senate are to vote on two separate bills on Thursday which could potentially bring an end to the shutdown. Meanwhile, BLS stated the January 2019 Employment Situation will be published as scheduled on February 1, 2019, at 1330GMT. ING noted that the 800k workers affected by the shutdown represent only 0.5% of the total US NFP, noting that the impact to the US economy will be modest but noticeable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; On the backfoot in early EU trade following the BoJ rate decision in which the Central Bank kept the NIRP at -0.1% and the 10yr JGB yield target around 0% as expected while also reducing inflation forecasts, which was widely touted beforehand. Furthermore, Japan logged the first trade annual deficit in three years, as the cost of energy imports surged. As such USD/JPY breached its 100 and 50 HMAs (at 109.45 and 109.53 respectively) to a high of 109.73 (vs low of 109.33) with little to report on the options expiry front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD, AUD, CAD &ndash; A sigh of relief for the Aussie and Kiwi amid the release of above-forecast NZ inflation figures following the decline in the New Zealand currency in the last six out of seven sessions. NZD/USD spiked higher from lows of 0.6743 to a high of 0.6793 ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6796 and the psychological 0.6800. Meanwhile the Aussie moved in sympathy to its antipodean counterpart as AUD/USD gained further ground above 0.7100 to a high of&nbsp; 0.7143 point before stabilising around its 50 HMA at 0.7140. Meanwhile, the CAD takes full advantage of the consolidating oil prices as USD/CAD gave up the 1.3350 handle and breached its 50 DMA to the downside at 1.3319 ahead of the release of Canadian retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, EUR &ndash; The Pound continues on its upwards trajectory amid ongoing hopes of an Article 50 extension despite the UK Governments constant dismissal of the option, though the latest suggests that support for the Cooper amendment (to give Parliament power to extend Article 50) is stacking up, with reports of the Labour party also supporting the amendment. Lloyd&rsquo;s notes that the recent Sterling strength was more than they anticipated, though a clean break through 1.3000 is still needed for &ldquo;re-energised momentum&rdquo; to the upside. GBP/USD&nbsp; remains closer to the top of a 1.2945-1.3000 range ahead of its 200 DMA at 1.3081. Meanwhile the EUR remains flat within a tight 1.1350-75 band amid no catalysts ahead of the ECB interest rate decision tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial gap open in 10-year Bund and Gilt futures, that saw highs for the session of 164.77 and 122.89 respectively, has been pared back in recent trade with a marginal sentiment turnaround to positivity as EU equities pick up some steam. UK 10-year futures trade in close proximity to session lows of 122.49 despite suggestions that UK PM May looks set to keep no-deal on the table, despite the looming threat of resignations, in an effort to defend against the oppositions&rsquo; support of the Cooper-Boles amendment. In the periphery, 10-year Bono futures are extending on the syndicated bond-driven gains seen in yesterday&rsquo;s session and outperform in the EZ, with the Spanish benchmark hitting heights not seen since last July (145.65). On the supply side,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US, the overnight risk averse moves in treasuries, driven by the FT&rsquo;s suggestions that the US had turned down a Chinese offer for preparatory trade talks, have been largely eliminated after Kudlow&rsquo;s denial with the futures curve wholly in the red. The majority of the action is in the long end, with 10-yr futures trading at lows of the day at 121-12+ as traders look ahead to further direction from the Richmond Fed Manufacturing data and the FHFA house price index scheduled for later in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.8%) and WTI (+0.8%) prices have nursed initial losses and moved into positive territory due a turnaround in risk sentiment. Following on from Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih&rsquo;s withdrawal from the WEF at Davos, Russian Energy Minister Novak has also cancelled his trip; Novak was due to speak on Friday on the Great Energy Race alongside IEA&rsquo;s Birol. Separately, IEA&rsquo;s Birol has stated that oil demand will grow by at least 1mln BPD. In terms of forecasting DNB have cut their 2019 Brent forecast to USD 70/bbl vs. Prev. USD 75/bbl. Of note API&rsquo;s have been rescheduled to today due to Monday&rsquo;s US market holiday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (Unch) has marginally benefitted from the risk sentiment, with the yellow metal trading at the top of it&rsquo;s narrow USD 4/oz range; currently just under USD 1285/oz. Elsewhere, China&rsquo;s December scrap metals imports increased to 510k tonnes, their highest figure since May, ahead of China tightening waste imports in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DNB cuts 2019 and 2020 Brent forecasts to USD 70/bbl (Prev. USD 75/bbl) and USD 75/bbl (USD 80/bbl) respectively, while maintaining 2020 forecast at USD 76/bbl. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IEA&rsquo;s Birol says oil demand will grow by at least 1mln BPD; adding that China is a demand uncertainty and there is more to come from US Shale oil. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ITV&rsquo;s Peston relaying comments from a senior official says, &quot;Given that the majority of two thirds [of the Commons] by which the Withdrawal Agreement [or Brexit deal] was defeated is composed of Unionists, hard Brexiteers as well as Remainers, it would take very clear evidence that it is &#39;only&#39; the backstop that prevents passage of the WA&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

US stocks were affected by growth concerns, alongside subsequently denied reports that the US turned down an offer by two Chinese vice-ministers to attend preparatory trade talks in the US. Sectors have strengthened somewhat from their negative opening, and are now mixed with underperformance in energy names and outperformance in utilities. Tech names have been underperforming following ASML (-1.8%) cutting Q1 sales guidance, with the likes of STMicroelectronics (-1.4%) down in sympathy. Other notable movers include Carrefour (+6.7%) are at the top of the Stoxx 600 following earnings where they confirmed all targets for their 2022 transformation plan. Separately, RPC Group (+4.6%) are firmly in the green after recommending a final cash offering of GBP 7.82/shr; with Co&rsquo;s directors seeing the acquisition terms as fair and reasonable. In contrast, at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Ingenico (-13.2%) after reporting a FY18 EBITDA miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Relatively muted session for the Dollar thus far with the index hovering around the middle of a tight 96.268-378 range after NEC Director Kudlow dismissed reports that US turned down an offer from China for trade talks. The US government shutdown is now rolling onto its 33rd day, although there were reports overnight that US Senate are to vote on two separate bills on Thursday which could potentially bring an end to the shutdown. One bill is supported by US President Trump which reportedly includes USD 5.7bln for the border wall and is said to be a compromise between Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Schumer according to reports in NYT. However, McConnell&#39;s office later stated that the NYT report of a shutdown deal is inaccurate and that Trump&rsquo;s stance on shutdown fight is unchanged. Meanwhile, BLS stated the January 2019 Employment Situation will be published as scheduled on February 1, 2019, at 1330GMT. ING noted that the 800k workers affected by the shutdown represent only 0.5% of the total US NFP, noting that the impact to the US economy will be modest but noticeable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; On the backfoot in early EU trade following the BoJ rate decision in which the Central Bank kept the NIRP at -0.1% and the 10yr JGB yield target around 0% as expected while also reducing inflation forecasts, which was widely touted beforehand. Furthermore, Japan logged the first trade annual deficit in three years, as the cost of energy imports surged. As such USD/JPY breached its 100 and 50 HMAs (at 109.45 and 109.53 respectively) to a high of 109.73 (vs low of 109.33) with little to report on the options expiry front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD, AUD, CAD &ndash; A sigh of relief for the Aussie and Kiwi amid the release of above-forecast NZ inflation figures following the decline in the New Zealand currency in the last six out of seven sessions. NZD/USD spiked higher from lows of 0.6743 to a high of 0.6793 ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6796 and the psychological 0.6800. Meanwhile the Aussie moved in sympathy to its antipodean counterpart as AUD/USD gained further ground above 0.7100 to a high of&nbsp; 0.7143 point before stabilising around its 50 HMA at 0.7140. Meanwhile, the CAD takes full advantage of the consolidating oil prices as USD/CAD gave up the 1.3350 handle and breached its 50 DMA to the downside at 1.3319 ahead of the release of Canadian retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, EUR &ndash; The Pound continues on its upwards trajectory amid ongoing hopes of an Article 50 extension despite the UK Governments constant dismissal of the option, though the latest suggests that support for the Cooper amendment (to give Parliament power to extend Article 50) is stacking up, with reports of the Labour party also supporting the amendment. Lloyd&rsquo;s notes that the recent Sterling strength was more than they anticipated, though a clean break through 1.3000 is still needed for &ldquo;re-energised momentum&rdquo; to the upside. GBP/USD&nbsp; remains closer to the top of a 1.2945-1.3000 range ahead of its 200 DMA at 1.3081. Meanwhile the EUR remains flat within a tight 1.1350-75 band amid no catalysts ahead of the ECB interest rate decision tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial gap open in 10-year Bund and Gilt futures, that saw highs for the session of 164.77 and 122.89 respectively, has been pared back in recent trade with a marginal sentiment turnaround to positivity as EU equities pick up some steam. UK 10-year futures trade in close proximity to session lows of 122.49 despite suggestions that UK PM May looks set to keep no-deal on the table, despite the looming threat of resignations, in an effort to defend against the oppositions&rsquo; support of the Cooper-Boles amendment. In the periphery, 10-year Bono futures are extending on the syndicated bond-driven gains seen in yesterday&rsquo;s session and outperform in the EZ, with the Spanish benchmark hitting heights not seen since last July (145.65). On the supply side,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US, the overnight risk averse moves in treasuries, driven by the FT&rsquo;s suggestions that the US had turned down a Chinese offer for preparatory trade talks, have been largely eliminated after Kudlow&rsquo;s denial with the futures curve wholly in the red. The majority of the action is in the long end, with 10-yr futures trading at lows of the day at 121-12+ as traders look ahead to further direction from the Richmond Fed Manufacturing data and the FHFA house price index scheduled for later in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.8%) and WTI (+0.8%) prices have nursed initial losses and moved into positive territory due a turnaround in risk sentiment. Following on from Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih&rsquo;s withdrawal from the WEF at Davos, Russian Energy Minister Novak has also cancelled his trip; Novak was due to speak on Friday on the Great Energy Race alongside IEA&rsquo;s Birol. Separately, IEA&rsquo;s Birol has stated that oil demand will grow by at least 1mln BPD. In terms of forecasting DNB have cut their 2019 Brent forecast to USD 70/bbl vs. Prev. USD 75/bbl. Of note API&rsquo;s have been rescheduled to today due to Monday&rsquo;s US market holiday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (Unch) has marginally benefitted from the risk sentiment, with the yellow metal trading at the top of it&rsquo;s narrow USD 4/oz range; currently just under USD 1285/oz. Elsewhere, China&rsquo;s December scrap metals imports increased to 510k tonnes, their highest figure since May, ahead of China tightening waste imports in 2019.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; Relatively muted session for the Dollar thus far with the index hovering around the middle of a tight 96.268-378 range after NEC Director Kudlow dismissed reports that US turned down an offer from China for trade talks. The US government shutdown is now rolling onto its 33rd day, although there were reports overnight that US Senate are to vote on two separate bills on Thursday which could potentially bring an end to the shutdown. One bill is supported by US President Trump which reportedly includes USD 5.7bln for the border wall and is said to be a compromise between Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Schumer according to reports in NYT. However, McConnell&#39;s office later stated that the NYT report of a shutdown deal is inaccurate and that Trump&rsquo;s stance on shutdown fight is unchanged. Meanwhile, BLS stated the January 2019 Employment Situation will be published as scheduled on February 1, 2019, at 1330GMT. ING noted that the 800k workers affected by the shutdown represent only 0.5% of the total US NFP, noting that the impact to the US economy will be modest but noticeable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY </strong>&ndash; On the backfoot in early EU trade following the BoJ rate decision in which the Central Bank kept the NIRP at -0.1% and the 10yr JGB yield target around 0% as expected while also reducing inflation forecasts, which was widely touted beforehand. Furthermore, Japan logged the first trade annual deficit in three years, as the cost of energy imports surged. As such USD/JPY breached its 100 and 50 HMAs (at 109.45 and 109.53 respectively) to a high of 109.73 (vs low of 109.33) with little to report on the options expiry front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD, AUD, CAD </strong>&ndash; A sigh of relief for the Aussie and Kiwi amid the release of above-forecast NZ inflation figures following the decline in the New Zealand currency in the last six out of seven sessions. NZD/USD spiked higher from lows of 0.6743 to a high of 0.6793 ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6796 and the psychological 0.6800. Meanwhile the Aussie moved in sympathy to its antipodean counterpart as AUD/USD gained further ground above 0.7100 to a high of &nbsp;0.7143 point before stabilising around its 50 HMA at 0.7140. Meanwhile, the CAD takes full advantage of the consolidating oil prices as USD/CAD gave up the 1.3350 handle and breached its 50 DMA to the downside at 1.3319 ahead of the release of Canadian retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong> &ndash; The Pound continues on its upwards trajectory amid ongoing hopes of an Article 50 extension despite the UK Governments constant dismissal of the option, though the latest suggests that support for the Cooper amendment (to give Parliament power to extend Article 50) is stacking up, with reports of the Labour party also supporting the amendment. Lloyd&rsquo;s notes that the recent Sterling strength was more than they anticipated, though a clean break through 1.3000 is still needed for &ldquo;re-energised momentum&rdquo; to the upside. GBP/USD &nbsp;remains closer to the top of a 1.2945-1.3000 range ahead of its 200 DMA at 1.3081. Meanwhile the EUR remains flat within a tight 1.1350-75 band amid no catalysts ahead of the ECB interest rate decision tomorrow.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The initial gap open in 10-year Bund and Gilt futures, that saw highs for the session of 164.77 and 122.89 respectively, has been pared back in recent trade with a marginal sentiment turnaround to positivity as EU equities pick up some steam. UK 10-year futures trade in close proximity to session lows of 122.49 despite suggestions that UK PM May looks set to keep no-deal on the table, despite the looming threat of resignations, in an effort to defend against the oppositions&rsquo; support of the Cooper-Boles amendment. In the periphery, 10-year Bono futures are extending on the syndicated bond-driven gains seen in yesterday&rsquo;s session and outperform in the EZ, with the Spanish benchmark hitting heights not seen since last July (145.65). On the supply side, European traders will have one eye on Germany, who have EUR 4.0bln up for grabs in their 2024 0% Bobl auction</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US, the overnight risk averse moves in treasuries, driven by the FT&rsquo;s suggestions that the US had turned down a Chinese offer for preparatory trade talks, have been largely eliminated after Kudlow&rsquo;s denial with the futures curve wholly in the red. The majority of the action is in the long end, with 10-yr futures trading at lows of the day at 121-12+ as traders look ahead to further direction from the Richmond Fed Manufacturing data and the FHFA house price index scheduled for later in the day.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, it was also reported that the US turned down China&rsquo;s offer for preparatory trade talks, which was later denied by NEC Director Kudlow. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-0.3%) was subdued with underperformance in the energy sector after crude prices slipped by over 2% and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) was dampened by disappointing trade data including the sharpest drop in exports since October 2016. However, sentiment in Tokyo was later propped up by a weaker currency, while Japan Display shares surged on reports it is in investment discussions with TPK and Silk Road Fund. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) conformed to the indecisiveness after mixed actions by the PBoC as it conducted a Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility for the first time ever which was at a lower rate than MLF rates and is aimed at spurring lending to small firms, but conversely refrained from reverse repo operations which resulted to a daily drain of CNY 350bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded sideways throughout most the session amid the indecisive risk tone in stocks and with participants side-lined prior to the BoJ policy announcement, but then saw &nbsp;choppy trade in reflection of sentiment in the region and following an unsurprising BoJ decision to keep policy setting unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped reverse repo operations for a net daily drain of CNY 350bln, although it conducted a CNY 257.5bln 1yr Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility with rate at 3.15% in its first use of TMLF vs 3.30% rate at last MLF. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7969 (Prev. 6.7854)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US reportedly turned down an offer by China for 2 vice-ministers to travel to the US for preparatory trade talks because of a lack of progress on two important issues which reports suggested highlighted the difficulties of reaching a deal by March 1st deadline. However, NEC Director Kudlow later denied the report and noted the big meeting will be at the end of January with the Chinese Vice-Premier, while Kudlow also stated that enforcement of deadlines and timetable is crucial to the success of China talks. (FT/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ kept monetary policy settings unchanged as expected with NIRP held at -0.1% and 10yr JGB yield target at around 0%. Furthermore, the BoJ extended its lending scheme for 1 year and stated that economic momentum for reaching price goal is sustained but lacking strength, while it added that risks to price and economic outlooks are skewed to the downside. BoJ reduced Real GDP forecasts for FY18 but raised Real GDP forecasts for FY19 and FY20, while it reduced Core CPI forecasts on all years through to FY20.

NZD/USD was underpinned by firmer than expected CPI data which also lifted AUD/USD in sympathy, although the indecisive risk tone has capped the upside in the antipodeans due to their high-beta characteristics. Elsewhere, JPY gradually weakened in the aftermath of the discouraging trade data, while some mild pressure was also seen after the BoJ policy announcement in which the central bank reduced CPI forecasts across the board and noted that risks to its outlook were skewed to the downside.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand CPI (Q4) Q/Q 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.0% (Prev. 0.9%).

Nonetheless, WTI crude futures have marginally recovered overnight and just about reclaimed the USD 53.00/bbl level, while focus for the complex shifts to the API inventory report later today which is a day later than usual due to the recent US holiday. Elsewhere, gold traded sideways amid a flat greenback and indecisive risk tone, while copper continued to nurse the prior day&rsquo;s losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were bid on Tuesday as risk-sentiment deteriorated amid renewed fear of a global slowdown following weak China growth GDP figures as well as growth downgrades by the IMF for 2019 and 2020. In afternoon trade the belly and long-end of the curve hit fresh session highs after the FT announced the US turned down a China offer of preparatory trade talks over lack of progress. Finally, Existing Home Sales were the lowest since 2015 and thus contributed to upside in the complex. The curve saw some modest bull-flattening with short-dated yields lower by c.3bps and long-dated yields lower by c.5bps at settlement. Spreads were mixed heading into the close. US T-note futures (H9) settled 13 ticks higher at 121-18+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is scheduled to give State of the Union Address from the Capitol on January 29th as scheduled, while it was separately reported that US President Trump is said to have begun interviewing new candidates for the open Fed board seat. (Fox/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were reports that the US Senate will vote on two separate bills on Thursday that could end the government shutdown, including one that is supported by US President Trump which reportedly includes USD 5.7bln for the border wall and is said to be a compromise between Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Schumer according to reports in NYT. However, McConnell&#39;s office later stated that the NYT report of a shutdown deal is inaccurate and that Trump&rsquo;s stance on shutdown fight is unchanged, while reports also noted that neither parties think there are enough votes to pass the bill.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were choppy as the region attempted to shrugg off the headwinds from Wall St, where stocks declined as the risk averse tone and lingering global growth concerns caught up with the major US indices on return from their extended weekend. Furthermore, it was also reported that the US turned down China&rsquo;s offer for preparatory trade talks, which was later denied by NEC Director Kudlow. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-0.3%) was subdued with underperformance in the energy sector after crude prices slipped by over 2% and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) was dampened by disappointing trade data including the sharpest drop in exports since October 2016. However, sentiment in Tokyo was later propped up by a weaker currency, while Japan Display shares surged on reports it is in investment discussions with TPK and Silk Road Fund. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) conformed to the indecisiveness after mixed actions by the PBoC as it conducted a Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility for the first time ever which was at a lower rate than MLF rates and is aimed at spurring lending to small firms, but conversely refrained from reverse repo operations which resulted to a daily drain of CNY 350bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded sideways throughout most the session amid the indecisive risk tone in stocks and with participants side-lined prior to the BoJ policy announcement, but then saw &nbsp;choppy trade in reflection of sentiment in the region and following an unsurprising BoJ decision to keep policy setting unchanged.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are choppy as the region attempts to shake off the headwinds from Wall St, where stocks declined as the risk averse tone and lingering global growth concerns caught up with the major US indices on return from the extended weekend. Furthermore, there were reports the US turned down China&rsquo;s offer for preparatory trade talks which was later denied by NEC Director Kudlow. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-0.1%) is subdued with underperformance in the energy sector after crude prices slipped by over 2% and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) was initially dampened by disappointing trade data including the sharpest drop in exports since October 2016. However, sentiment in Tokyo was later propped up by a weaker currency and with Japan Display shares surging on reports the Co. is in investment discussions with TPK and Silk Road Fund. Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) conform to the indecisiveness after mixed actions by the PBoC which conducted Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility for the first time ever which was at a lower rate than MLF rates and is aimed at spurring lending to small firms, but conversely refrained from reverse repo operations which resulted to a daily drain of CNY 350bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat with price action sticking within this week&rsquo;s tight range, while EUR/USD and GBP/USD also consolidate overnight with the latter at the 1.2900 handle as it holds on to the recent employment and wage inspired gains. Elsewhere, NZD/USD was underpinned by firmer than expected CPI data which also lifted AUD/USD in sympathy although the indecisive risk tone has capped the upside in the antipodeans due to their high-beta characteristics, while JPY has gradually weakened in the aftermath of the discouraging trade data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid the indecisive risk tone across the regional stock markets and with participants side-lined ahead of the BoJ policy announcement</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The Bank of Japan will conclude its first 2-day policy meeting of 2019 on Wednesday in which consensus is one-sided for the central bank to maintain negative interest rates policy at -0.1% and the long-term yield target at around 0.0%. Furthermore, the BoJ is expected to maintain a flexible approach on yields and its forward guidance of keeping current extremely low rates for an extended period of time, while participants also await the board members&#39; latest Real GDP and Core CPI forecasts in the Outlook Report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expectations for the BoJ to remain on hold continue to be supported by soft inflation from Japan with National CPI for December at 0.3% vs. Exp. 0.3% (Prev. 0.8%), while Core CPI was softer than expected at 0.7% vs. Exp. 0.8% (Prev. 0.9%) which shows prices are not even halfway towards the 2% target. Sources have therefore suggested the BoJ is set to trim its inflation outlook for the next two years amid the recent oil slump and cheaper mobile plans weighing on domestic consumer price. In addition, other factors including the ongoing global trade uncertainty and Japan&#39;s impending sales tax hike later this year also restrict the BoJ&#39;s policy options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent comments from BoJ officials have not changed much from the central bank&#39;s regular statements as Governor Kuroda reaffirmed the BoJ will maintain QQE with YCC for as long as necessary to reach 2% target in a stable manner. Governor Kuroda has also reiterated that they will continue expanding monetary base until CPI stably exceeds 2% goal and that it is important to take consistent policy &quot;patiently and persistently&quot; towards beating deflation. Therefore, this lack of deviation in the central bank&#39;s rhetoric also supports the view that a near-term policy adjustment is highly unlikely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no expected time for the BoJ announcement which tends to be anytime from the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0230GMT/2030CST/1030HKT. However, no major fireworks are expected as a hold of current policy is seen as a forgone conclusion, while focus will also be on the statement and Outlook Report for any adjustments, as sources have recently suggested that the BoJ is considering lowering its fiscal 2019 CPI growth forecast to around 1.0% from Prev. projection of 1.4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previous Outlook Report Released in October:<br />Real GDP<br />- Fiscal 2018 forecast cut to 1.4% from 1.5%.<br />- Fiscal 2019 forecast maintained at 0.8%.<br />- Fiscal 2020 forecast maintained at 0.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core CPI<br />- Fiscal 2018 forecast cut to 0.9% from 1.1%.<br />- Fiscal 2019 forecast cut to 1.4% from 1.5% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).<br />- Fiscal 2020 forecast cut to 1.5% from 1.6% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).</p>\r\n",
