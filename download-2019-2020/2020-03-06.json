The market’s attention has now drifted to the energy complex’s decline on Friday as the OPEC meeting failed to bear fruit, in addition to another rally in the TPLEX, both reflective in the Energy and Financials sectors leading the losses. A blockbuster NFP report failed to draw attention as COVID-19 rides in the front seat. Desks note that the cascade lower in oil prices and Treasury yields brings a whole new bearish factor for equity investors to consider. The lower energy prices, post-OPEC failing to reach an agreement for additional cuts or even an extension, brings strain to companies in the sector, particularly to the debt-laden shale names in the US. As E&amp;P names struggle further, credit lines begin to deteriorate, raising the risks of defaults and for wider effects on the credit markets. Furthermore, with yields tumbling lower and lower, banks come increasingly strained to turn profits, raising the risk of a contraction of credit available to the economy (Fed cuts should theoretically ease these pressures), which could pose wider risks to supply chains, keeping investors cautious on equities; the lower energy prices aren’t providing any favours either as bond investors lower their inflation expectations.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J0) SETTLED USD 4.62 LOWER AT USD 41.28/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 4.72 LOWER AT USD 45.22/BBL: </strong>Energy prices sold off heavily amid the breakdown of talks between OPEC and OPEC+, namely Russia. The jitters in previous sessions proved well served as ultimately Russia announced it did not agree to any additional cuts, nor an extension of the current cut agreement when it expires at the end of the month, leaving members at their own will to run the oil taps in the face of a deteriorating global demand picture; it had been generally expected that the OPEC+ member would ultimately come on board, as it usually does. Russian Energy Minister Novak said that it had no plans to raise production on April 1st, for what it’s worth, and that he wanted more time to assess the impact of the virus on global demand, nodding to central banks in leading the efforts to manage demand declines. Furthermore, there were reports that OPEC members are showing a willingness to walk away from the alliance with Russia, as well as a delegate saying that a June OPEC meeting was unlikely – adding to the supply-side woes. However, OPEC Secretary-General Barkindo struck a more optimistic tone, suggesting that there would be more informal meetings before month-end to strike a deal, whether Russia remains a part of that is up in the air. There is reportedly an OPEC+ JTC meeting to be held on March 18th. The OPEC panel committee had reportedly put forward an additional 1.5mln BPD cut to OPEC+ on Thursday, while Russia had initially showed support for an extension of the current cuts till year-end, although ultimately it appears a compromise could not be found. Elsewhere, the latest US Baker Hughes rig count showed (rigs) Oil +4 at 682, nat gas -1 at 109 and total +3 at 793. Prices in the front-month crude benchmarks now sit slightly above their lows, which reached levels not seen since 2016.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 1 POINT &amp; 9 TICKS HIGHER AT 138-01+. </strong>The TPLEX bull-flattened intensely on Friday, bringing the 30-year yield to unseen territory – where it currently lies within the Fed’s target range, while the rest of the curve sits beneath it. No one “reason” supported the price movement, but desks note ongoing haven flows amid the virus from real money buyers, flows from convexity buyers, and chunky short-covering from leveraged accounts, in addition to an unwinding of market hedges. Furthermore, investors are likely piling into duration ahead of the weekend, where participants again dare expose themselves to risk in the face of COVID-19 and an expected rise in US cases. The sharp decline in energy prices served as the cherry on the cake as investors begin pricing in lower inflation expectations and question the stability of the global economy, increasing the allure of the sovereign bond market. By settlement, yields had fallen 9bps in the 2-year yield, 19.5bps in the 10-year yield and a jaw-dropping 33bps in the 30-year yield.</p><p><strong>* US NFP (FEB): </strong>Printed a forecast-beating 273k jobs added (exp. 175k), with the prior revised to the same figure from 225k. Average hourly earnings M/M rose in line with consensus at +0.3%, up from the prior +0.2%, seeing the Y/Y fall by 0.1% to 3.0%, as expected, while the unemployment printed a surprise 0.1% dip to 3.5%. “These are remarkable numbers, completely impossible to square with leading indicators and, therefore, vulnerable to downward revisions in due course,” Pantheon Economics remarks, noting that the headline figures in January and February are heavily influenced by government hiring, nonetheless the 222k and 228k private job growth is still very impressive. Pantheon suggests that the long run of mild winter weather has had a positive impact on employment over the past three months, which continues to be exhibited by the strong +42k jobs added in the construction sector, while most components of the report also posted decent gains, although the third consecutive decline in temp hiring sends an ominous signal for the future, the consultancy warns. With the survey being conducted a few days before markets peaked and virus concerns began to bake in, participants are largely looking past the blockbuster report and are now expecting to see some deterioration in job growth in the months ahead; Pantheon says that so far there has been no evidence of layoffs so far in March, although April will likely be much worse.</p><p><strong>* NEC DIRECTOR KUDLOW: </strong>Kudlow said, post-NFP, that the US economy is fundamentally strong and noted the economy will slow down in certain sectors but will be temporary. Kudlow also said the Trump administration is considering immediate fiscal stimulus which would be separate from the tax cut plan that is being constructed ahead of the November election. He said that he doesn't think the government should be \"throwing cash\" around in short-term rebate-type plans; he would prefer a targeted approach to any fiscal stimulus measures, although noted that more information is needed before action can be taken with fiscal measures. Kudlow declined to give a specific timeline on when stimulus would be announced, though they may have more to say on fiscal measures next week; notes the administration could take executive action for fiscal stimulus and may go back to congress. Note that it was reported in the WaPo that the White House is looking at tax deferral for airline, travel, and cruise industries impacted by the virus, which could well be a part of the fiscal measures Kudlow alluded too.</p><p><strong>* COVID-19 UPDATE: </strong>The US could advise some or all US travellers to temporarily avoid taking cruises or potentially impose travel restrictions related to cruises (RCL, CCL, NCLH), according to officials, where no decision has yet been made ahead of a weekend meeting between the administration and the industry. Meanwhile, the US has granted exclusions from import tariffs for more than 100 medical items imported from China, including face masks, examination gloves, and sanitizing wipes, potentially of note for MMM and CLX, the WSJ reported.<strong> </strong>Regarding new cases,<strong> </strong>CDC said there are 213 total confirmed and presumptive cases in the US, including repatriated cases, a 64 case rise since Thursday; death toll rises to 11 from 10. NY Governor Cuomo announced the number of cases in NY state rose by 11 to 33. However, due to the lack of available testing, the true amount of cases and severity is the big unknown to investors. The UK confirmed cases rose to 163 from 115, in addition to the first death in the country. German cases now stand at 534. France now has 613 cases (prev. 423 on Thursday). The Italian death toll rose to 197 (prev. 128 on Thursday), confirmed cases rose to 4636 (prev. 3858 on Thursday); Italy is also mulling a quarantine for the Milan region. Meanwhile, EU Health Ministers concluded at their emergency EPSCO meeting that the coronavirus has entered a new phase in Europe, adding that limiting international travel will not be effective.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed's <strong>Williams</strong> (voter, neutral), ahead of the Fed blackout period before the March 18th meeting, said the fundamentals of the US economy remain strong, but the virus will have near-term effects on global economy, where central banks have important role to play in addressing the impact and the NY Fed will ensure ample supply of reserves – note there was strong demand for the Fed’s repo operations this week, with desks noting an increasing demand for funding amid an impending economic slowdown. Williams also said the Fed remains flexible and ready to make adjustments to ensure policy is implemented effectively. Further to the point, Fed’s <strong>Bullard </strong>(non-voter, dove) said participants shouldn’t put too much weight on the March 18th FOMC meeting, alluding to the Fed’s ability to move in-between meetings if need be. <strong>Kaplan </strong>(voter, neutral) said the Fed would be watching the path of diagnosed virus cases and will factor that into the decision for the March meeting. <strong>Kashkari</strong> (voter, dove) said that erring on side of taking out a little insurance is prudent, which he believes the latest rate cut was, adding that the Fed may need to do more if the virus is really bad, although said it could raise rates if virus impact is not that bad. <strong>Evans</strong> (non-voter, dove) said forward guidance and asset purchases will be needed to shape inflation expectations, with rates at zero, adding that the most effective tools will be getting some type of liquidity and funds into the hands of people who need it most. <strong>Rosengren</strong> (non-voter, hawk) said the Fed should be allowed to purchase a broader range of securities and assets if the COVID-19 outbreak forces the Fed to launch a new round of asset purchases, arguing that if the virus causes the Fed to cut rates to zero, the 10-year yield could follow close behind it, which could limit the ability of large scale long-term Treasury purchases. Meanwhile, <strong>George</strong> (non-voter, hawk) said the longer-run costs of balance sheet policies have not been fully taken into account and LSAPs have contributed to elevated asset valuations.</p><p><strong>* CANADA JOBS: </strong>February jobs beat expectations of a 10k print rising 30.3k, at a slightly slower but still very solid pace from January’s 34.5k; unemployment ticked up 0.1% to a still low 5.6%, as expected. The report was solid once again, full-time employment saw 37.6k (prev. 35.7k) new full-time jobs driving the gains; meanwhile, part-time jobs fell 7k. Although the report was solid, coronavirus concerns continue to take precedence.<strong> </strong>RBC highlights the report is not really a surprise as consumer and business confidence “were still surprisingly resilient in the month despite disruptions from rail blockades and coronavirus concerns abroad”.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -1.7% at 2972, NDX -1.63% at 8530, DJI -0.98% at 25,865. <strong>Sectors</strong>: Energy -5.6%, Financials -3.3%, Materials -2.62%, Technology -2%, Real Estate -1.7%, Consumer Discretionary -1.4%, Communication Svs. -1.24%, Industrials -0.9%, Consumer Staples -0.77%, Utilities -0.77%, Health -0.52%</p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>The Energy sector (XLE, XOP, XOM, CVX, MPC) was under heavy selling pressure amid the decline in oil prices post the OPEC meeting. Banks (XLF, BKX) were also large underperformers amid the sharp drop in rates, particularly in the long end, while JPMorgan (JPM) was also suffering on uncertainty prospects amid its CEO Jamie Dimon going into emergency heart surgery, although has since been reported will recover. Apple (AAPL) was offered amid poor risk appetite in addition to a forecast downgrade at UBS. Cypress Semiconductors (CY) was offered further on Friday following further reports that its Infineon (IFX GY) deal is facing regulatory struggle in the US. Square (SQ) sold off amid a guidance cut after noting an increased interest expense following a capital raise. Airlines (UAL, DAL, AAL) were firmer, finding some reprieve from strong selling pressure in recent weeks. Costco (COST) sold off following a Revenue miss – although it did note in pick up in activity amid the virus.</p><p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP:</strong></p><p><strong>* DXY:</strong> No or little sign of the buck stopping for the Greenback and index by default as the Fed’s untimely intervention compounds the extreme compression in UST and other core global bond yields. Moreover, curves have flipped back into full bull flattening mode as the total of COVID-19 cases crosses the 100k mark and the fatality count increases amidst an ever-widening spread of the virus. Back to the Fed, Tuesday’s emergency rate cut (50 bp) only tempered March and beyond FOMC easing expectations temporarily and Chairman Powell did not rule out further policy action to fend off the nCoV economic contagion at any scheduled meeting, or the possibility of another impromptu move. Hence, the Dollar continues to weaken against G10 peers and the DXY is veering even farther from its ytd peak (99.915 set on February 20) to new 2020 trough at 95.700 (within a weekly range up to 98.087 at one stage). For the record, the US services PMI and ISM surveys were considerably less upbeat than today’s NFP release and will have acknowledged the adverse Chinese epidemic impact to a degree, but the real evidence and extent of the damage so far will only come with macro releases for March.</p><p><strong>* CHF/EUR/JPY/NZD/GBP:</strong> Interestingly, the Franc, Euro, Yen, Kiwi and Pound have forged more bullish momentum at their US counterpart’s expense than other major currencies awaiting respective Central Bank responses to the crisis. Indeed, Usd/Chf is hurtling towards 0.9300 and Eur/Usd is peering over 1.1350 even though Eur/Chf is back below 1.0600 as the Swiss unit regains its more attractive safe-haven guise, despite verbal SNB intervention and the far from unprecedented chance that it could back up words with action before the regular quarterly policy review on March 19). However, assuming the Swiss Central Bank sticks to the timetable, it will have the benefit of hindsight or at least be equipped with the knowledge of any ECB measures to combat the coronavirus fall-out, which are not guaranteed given recent non-committal commentary and the ongoing strategic review of course. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy tested 105.00 and what some suspect is the BoJ’s line in the sand to trigger more than daily QE activity, such as a rate cut and YCC adjustment at the March convene. Elsewhere, Nzd/Usd has retained a firm grip of the 0.6300 handle amidst pricing for a 25 bp RBNZ that would match the RBA, but keep the Kiwi’s yield premium over the Buck cushioned and Cable is also extending its recovery through a big figure, at 1.3000 as the BoE signals a coordinated approach to tackle the virus effect alongside the UK Treasury. Note, rather mixed opinions on round 1 of the Brexit trade talks, but not much lasting impact on the Pound.</p><p><strong>* AUD/CAD/SEK/NOK:</strong> As noted above, the RBA preceded the pre-emptive or arguably premature Fed with a 25 bp cut to a new record low benchmark rate, but Aud/Usd bounced in response as a not insignificant minority were looking for more. However, the Aussie has been undermined subsequently by weaker than forecast retail sales data, exports and imports under the hood of an ostensibly better trade balance – Aud/Usd capped ahead of 0.6660 and Aud/Nzd circa 1.0530. Conversely, the BoC matched the FOMC, but delivered a downbeat assessment that was underscored by dovish guidance in the statement and subsequent remarks from Governor Poloz, hence Usd/Cad has breached 1.3400, with the Loonie not helped by the collapse in oil after OPEC+ failed to get Russia on board with any output cull whatsoever, or an extension to the current quota that is due to end this month. Similarly, the Norwegian Krona has been hammered by tanking crude prices and broad risk-off positioning as Eur/Nok spiked to new 10.5000+ record highs, and the Swedish Crown was only partly protected from bearish sentiment via upbeat data and the services PMI as the Riksbank said it is ready to act (reverse repo hike or implement QE), if required.</p><p><strong>* EM: </strong>Widespread depreciation to the point of devaluation or all time lows in some cases, regardless of intervention and potential positives like another ceasefire in Syria that could have given the Lira a bigger boost, especially given the aforementioned cheaper cost of oil, which rattled the Rouble inversely. Meanwhile, the Real was riled by Brazil’s Treasury Secretary stating that the Government does not interfere with the BCB’s efforts to keep the Brl stable, but did glean traction from FX swap ops during the week.</p>",

No one “reason” supported the price movement, but desks note ongoing haven flows amid the virus from real money buyers, flows from convexity buyers, and chunky short-covering from leveraged accounts, in addition to an unwinding of market hedges. Furthermore, investors are likely piling into duration ahead of the weekend, where participants again dare expose themselves to risk in the face of COVID-19 and an expected rise in US cases. The sharp decline in energy prices served as the cherry on the cake as investors begin pricing in lower inflation expectations and question the stability of the global economy, increasing the allure of the sovereign bond market. By settlement, yields had fallen 9bps in the 2-year yield, 19.5bps in the 10-year yield and a jaw-dropping 33bps in the 30-year yield.</li></ul>",

The jitters in previous sessions proved well served as ultimately Russia announced it did not agree to any additional cuts, nor an extension of the current cut agreement when it expires at the end of the month, leaving members at their own will to run the oil taps in the face of a deteriorating global demand picture; it had been generally expected that the OPEC+ member would ultimately come on board, as it usually does. Russian Energy Minister Novak said that it had no plans to raise production on April 1st, for what it’s worth, and that he wanted more time to assess the impact of the virus on global demand, nodding to central banks in leading the efforts to manage demand declines. Furthermore, there were reports that OPEC members are showing a willingness to walk away from the alliance with Russia, as well as a delegate saying that a June OPEC meeting was unlikely – adding to the supply-side woes. However, OPEC Secretary-General Barkindo struck a more optimistic tone, suggesting that there would be more informal meetings before month-end to strike a deal, whether Russia remains a part of that is up in the air. There is reportedly an OPEC+ JTC meeting to be held on March 18th. The OPEC panel committee had reportedly put forward an additional 1.5mln BPD cut to OPEC+ on Thursday, while Russia had initially showed support for an extension of the current cuts till year-end, although ultimately it appears a compromise could not be found. Elsewhere, the latest US Baker Hughes rig count showed (rigs) Oil +4 at 682, nat gas -1 at 109 and total +3 at 793. Prices in the front-month crude benchmarks now sit slightly above their lows, which reached levels not seen since 2016.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: monetary authorities provide more nCoV pain relief, but no panacea",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>No or little sign of the buck stopping for the Greenback and index by default as the Fed’s untimely intervention compounds the extreme compression in UST and other core global bond yields. Moreover, curves have flipped back into full bull flattening mode as the total of COVID-19 cases crosses the 100k mark and the fatality count increases amidst an ever-widening spread of the virus. Back to the Fed, Tuesday’s emergency rate cut (50 bp) only tempered March and beyond FOMC easing expectations temporarily and Chairman Powell did not rule out further policy action to fend off the nCoV economic contagion at any scheduled meeting, or the possibility of another impromptu move. Hence, the Dollar continues to weaken against G10 peers and the DXY is veering even farther from its ytd peak (99.915 set on February 20) to new 2020 trough at 95.700 (within a weekly range up to 98.087 at one stage). For the record, the US services PMI and ISM surveys were considerably less upbeat than today’s NFP release and will have acknowledged the adverse Chinese epidemic impact to a degree, but the real evidence and extent of the damage so far will only come with macro releases for March.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY/NZD/GBP</strong></p><p>Interestingly, the Franc, Euro, Yen, Kiwi and Pound have forged more bullish momentum at their US counterpart’s expense than other major currencies awaiting respective Central Bank responses to the crisis. Indeed, Usd/Chf is hurtling towards 0.9300 and Eur/Usd is peering over 1.1350 even though Eur/Chf is back below 1.0600 as the Swiss unit regains its more attractive safe-haven guise, despite verbal SNB intervention and the far from unprecedented chance that it could back up words with action before the regular quarterly policy review on March 19). However, assuming the Swiss Central Bank sticks to the timetable, it will have the benefit of hindsight or at least be equipped with the knowledge of any ECB measures to combat the coronavirus fall-out, which are not guaranteed given recent non-committal commentary and the ongoing strategic review of course. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy tested 105.00 and what some suspect is the BoJ’s line in the sand to trigger more than daily QE activity, such as a rate cut and YCC adjustment at the March convene. Elsewhere, Nzd/Usd has retained a firm grip of the 0.6300 handle amidst pricing for a 25 bp RBNZ that would match the RBA, but keep the Kiwi’s yield premium over the Buck cushioned and Cable is also extending its recovery through a big figure, at 1.3000 as the BoE signals a coordinated approach to tackle the virus effect alongside the UK Treasury. Note, rather mixed opinions on round 1 of the Brexit trade talks, but not much lasting impact on the Pound.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, the RBA preceded the pre-emptive or arguably premature Fed with a 25 bp cut to a new record low benchmark rate, but Aud/Usd bounced in response as a not insignificant minority were looking for more. However, the Aussie has been undermined subsequently by weaker than forecast retail sales data, exports and imports under the hood of an ostensibly better trade balance – Aud/Usd capped ahead of 0.6660 and Aud/Nzd circa 1.0530. Conversely, the BoC matched the FOMC, but delivered a downbeat assessment that was underscored by dovish guidance in the statement and subsequent remarks from Governor Poloz, hence Usd/Cad has breached 1.3400, with the Loonie not helped by the collapse in oil after OPEC+ failed to get Russia on board with any output cull whatsoever, or an extension to the current quota that is due to end this month. Similarly, the Norwegian Krona has been hammered by tanking crude prices and broad risk-off positioning as Eur/Nok spiked to new 10.5000+ record highs, and the Swedish Crown was only partly protected from bearish sentiment via upbeat data and the services PMI as the Riksbank said it is ready to act (reverse repo hike or implement QE), if required.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Widespread depreciation to the point of devaluation or all time lows in some cases, regardless of intervention and potential positives like another ceasefire in Syria that could have given the Lira a bigger boost, especially given the aforementioned cheaper cost of oil, which rattled the Rouble inversely. Meanwhile, the Real was riled by Brazil’s Treasury Secretary stating that the Government does not interfere with the BCB’s efforts to keep the Brl stable, but did glean traction from FX swap ops during the week.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-2.3%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%)</strong> were also heavily pressured alongside the global stock rout and continued PBoC liquidity inaction. On the coronavirus front, the pace of additional confirmed cases and deaths in mainland China continued to show a mild improvement, although this failed to spur markets as attention was also on the increasing number of cases in other countries leading to fears of a global pandemic. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the bloodbath in stocks and as bond prices tracked their US counterparts higher against the backdrop of record low US 10yr Treasury yields, while the JSCC noted an emergency margin call was triggered for long-term JGB futures and China’s 10yr yield also slipped to its lowest since 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

Once again, there hasn’t been too much in the way of notable macro newsflow, instead, attention remains on the ongoing climbing case count with particular focus Stateside amid a pickup in COVID-19 diagnosis’ and reports of 2733 people being quarantined in New York City. Commentary around the 2020 Presidential election race continues to impose itself on the market narrative, however, it appears to still be playing second fiddle to the fallout from COVID-19. Furthermore, the market is also trying to wrestle with the narrative over who will be the most favourable candidate for Trump to face in November with Biden viewed as more market-friendly than Sanders, with Sanders an easier candidate for Trump to defeat. In terms of price action in Europe, the sell-off for the DAX gathered momentum early doors (as did other global asset classes) with the Mar’20 contract taking out support at 11617 (March 2nd low) before finding some composure after stalling at 11600. However, as the session progressed, the velocity of the price action in markets accelerated dramatically with the index eventually troughing at 11446. Stateside, futures unsurprisingly indicate a negative open with the e-mini S&amp;P lower by circa 80 points. All ten sectors in Europe are lower with slight underperformance in industrials, consumer discretionary and IT names, whilst consumer staples and telecoms are faring marginally better than their peers, however, are ultimately lower on the session. In terms of individual movers, there is a distinct lack of green on the board with focus instead, once again, to the downside with Capita (-12.6%) the notable laggard in the Stoxx 600 after adding to yesterday’s dire performance. Elsewhere, Prysmian (-9.5%) are markedly lower following disappointing FY results, Atlantia (-8%) are being weighed on after its Autostrade unit delayed results, Airbus (-6.0%) are being sold after posting no new orders in February, whilst executives at Boeing remain bullish on a return of the 737 MAX by mid-year.</p><p><strong>Tesla (TSLA)</strong> have secured Chinese Gov't approval for the sale of longer-range Model-3 vehicles which are made in China.

Once again, there hasn’t been too much in the way of notable macro newsflow, instead, attention remains on the ongoing climbing case count with particular focus Stateside amid a pickup in COVID-19 diagnosis’ and reports of 2733 people being quarantined in New York City. Commentary around the 2020 Presidential election race continues to impose itself on the market narrative, however, it appears to still be playing second fiddle to the fallout from COVID-19. Furthermore, the market is also trying to wrestle with the narrative over who will be the most favourable candidate for Trump to face in November with Biden viewed as more market-friendly than Sanders, with Sanders an easier candidate for Trump to defeat. In terms of price action in Europe, the sell-off for the DAX gathered momentum early doors (as did other global asset classes) with the Mar’20 contract taking out support at 11617 (March 2nd low) before finding some composure after stalling at 11600. However, as the session progressed, the velocity of the price action in markets accelerated dramatically with the index eventually troughing at 11446 . Stateside, futures unsurprisingly indicate a negative open with the e-mini S&amp;P lower by circa 80 points. All ten sectors in Europe are lower with slight underperformance in industrials, consumer discretionary and IT names, whilst consumer staples and telecoms are faring marginally&nbsp; better than their peers, however, are ultimately lower on the session. In terms of individual movers, there is a distinct lack of green on the board with focus instead, once again, to the downside with Capita (-12.6%) the notable laggard in the Stoxx 600 after adding to yesterday’s dire performance. Elsewhere, Prysmian (-9.5%) are markedly lower following disappointing FY results, Atlantia (-8%) are being weighed on after its Autostrade unit delayed results, Airbus (-6.0%) are being sold after posting no new orders in February, whilst executives at Boeing remain bullish on a return of the 737 MAX by mid-year.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Dollar continues to slide vs major peers while outperforming against the majority of its EM counterparts as US Treasury and other core global bond yields tank amidst more pronounced bull-flattening across the debt curves.

As a result, the <strong>DXY </strong>has extended post-Fed emergency ease lows to 95.993 and there’s little in the way of technical support ahead of 95.950 if the purely psychological or sentimental round number really gives way. NFP looms and usually matters, but in the current environment China’s COVID-19 and contagion appears all consuming</p><p><strong>NZD/JPY/CHF/EUR/AUD/GBP</strong></p><p>The strongest G10 currencies and roughly in descending order, partly due to relative rate differentials and grades of safe-haven appeal, as Nzd/Usd gathers pace through 0.6350 and Usd/Jpy recoils from 106.30+ overnight peaks below 105.00 (touted as the BoJ’s tolerance line), with supposed bids around 105.50 filled effortlessly along the way. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf is now under 0.9400 and Eur/Chf is threatening another downside breach of 1.0600 that will no doubt ring alarm bells at the SNB, especially as Eur/Usd is bid and now testing 1.1300. Back down under, Aud/Usd has been hampered to a degree by weak Aussie retail sales, though still comfortably above 0.6600, and Cable is approaching 1.3000 even though Eur/Gbp is hovering just shy of 0.8700. In terms of upside bullish objectives, contacts are flagging the 200 WMA around 1.3021, but chart levels are hardly being observed let alone respected at present.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Loonie is lagging given more dovish BoC guidance in wake of Wednesday’s ½ point rate cut, as Usd/Cad hugs 1.3400 and the same goes for the Scandinavian Kronas irrespective of ordinarily supportive Norwegian GDP and manufacturing production in advance of Riksbank remarks from Ohlsson pledging prompt action (stimulus) if required and then a relatively bland official statement effectively delivering the same message.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In short, risk aversion akin to a rout has taken a toll on all regional currencies, but with the Rouble also undermined by sinking Brent prices awaiting OPEC+, and actually Russia to give its approval to a deeper output cut pact that looks highly unlikely given comments attributed to a top ranking source.

ASX 200 (-2.8%) fell deeper into correction territory as tech and financials resumed their recent underperformance although defensives and gold miners showed some resilience on the safe-haven play, while Nikkei 225 (-3.0%) was the worst performer and retreated below the 21000 level to a 6-month low with losses exacerbated by detrimental currency flows and contractions in Household Spending. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) were also heavily pressured alongside the global stock rout and continued PBoC liquidity inaction. On the coronavirus front, the pace of additional confirmed cases and deaths in mainland China continued to show a mild improvement, although this failed to spur markets as attention was also on the increasing number of cases in other countries leading to fears of a global pandemic. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the bloodbath in stocks and as bond prices tracked their US counterparts higher against the backdrop of record low US 10yr Treasury yields, while the JSCC noted an emergency margin call was triggered for long-term JGB futures and China’s 10yr yield also slipped to its lowest since 2002.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FTSE 100</strong></p><p>OTHER UK COMPANIES</p><p>BROKER MOVES</p><p><strong>DAX</strong></p><p><strong>Infineon (IFX GY) – </strong>US National Security Officials have reportedly recommended that President Trump block the Co’s proposed acquisition of Cypress Semiconductor for USD 10bln, stating it presents a security risk; however, it is not clear as to why it poses a security risk.

(Newswires/NYT)&nbsp;</p><p>ASIA-PAC</p><p><strong>Asian equity markets slumped across the board as the sell-off rolled over from Wall St. where all major indices declined over 3%</strong>, led by a near 1000-point drop in the DJIA amid coronavirus fears which spurred a mass flight to safety and pressured US 10yr&nbsp; yields to fresh record lows. <strong>ASX 200 (-2.8%)</strong> fell deeper into correction territory as tech and financials resumed their recent underperformance although defensives and gold miners showed some resilience on the safe-haven play, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (-3.0%)</strong> was the worst performer and retreated below the 21000 level to a 6-month low with losses exacerbated by detrimental currency flows and contractions in Household Spending. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-2.7%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%)</strong> were also heavily pressured alongside the global stock rout and continued PBoC liquidity inaction. On the coronavirus front, the pace of additional confirmed cases and deaths in mainland China continued to show a mild improvement, although this failed to spur markets as attention was also on the increasing number of cases in other countries leading to fears of a global pandemic. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid the bloodbath in stocks and as bond prices tracked their US counterparts higher against the backdrop of record low US 10yr Treasury yields, while the JSCC noted an emergency margin call was triggered for long-term JGB futures and China’s 10yr yield also slipped to its lowest since 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

(FT)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> extended its decline heading to today’s NFP data to test the 96.50 level after the 10yr yield fell to a fresh record low and with Fed Fund Rate futures pricing in a near coin-toss between a 25bps and 50bps cut at this month’s FOMC. There were several Fed speakers overnight who all seemingly kept their options open with Kaplan unwilling to presume what the Fed would do and suggested the path of coronavirus cases is to be factored into the March meeting. In addition, Kashkari viewed the recent rate cut as insurance and suggested that Fed actions could depend on how the virus plays out, while Williams noted the Fed remains flexible and is ready to make adjustments to ensure monetary policy is implemented effectively. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> were flat overnight and held on to the prior day’s spoils against the greenback but with further advances in the single currency stalled by resistance at 1.1250 and with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> also stuck around 1.2950 following mixed rhetoric from post-Brexit negotiations in which the sides held constructive and good-natured talks but serious divergences remained. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> retreated below the 106.00 handle amid safe-haven flows which also underpinned the <strong>CHF</strong>, while <strong>antipodeans </strong>traded lacklustre due to their high-beta statuses, <strong>CNY</strong> weakness and a contraction in Australian Retail Sales data.</p><p><strong>BoC Governor Poloz said the bank is ready to cut rates further if needed to support growth and keep inflation on target</strong>, while he added lower rates will help stabilize the housing market rather than contribute to froth. Poloz also noted that Canada is heading for another quarter of very weak growth and Q2 could also take a hit. Poloz also stated the bank felt that downside risks to the economy were more than sufficient to outweigh continuing concern about financial vulnerabilities and that <strong>the Bank was considering a rate cut even without taking the virus into account</strong>. Furthermore, <strong>he noted that large scale asset purchases are part of the bank's toolkit but is fortunate not to have had to use them</strong>.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> extended its surge helped by a weaker greenback and flight to safety with the precious metal on track for its largest weekly gain in 8 years, while <strong>copper</strong> prices was subdued on the global stock market rout brought on by coronavirus fears.</p><p><strong>OPEC Statement noted it decided to recommend to OPEC+ an additional 1.5mln BPD cut that should last until the end of 2020.</strong> There were also comments from OPEC Secretary General Barkindo that there is no reason to doubt Russia's commitment and outcome of the consultations, while he responded that he doesn’t share the pessimism when asked if Non-OPEC doesn't agree to the cuts.

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>The TPLEX caught another bid on Thursday, this time indiscriminately across the curve, as opposed to the steepener on Wednesday. The move comes amid a decline in risk sentiment after the bounce higher on Wednesday, exacerbating the haven flows and pronouncing the decline in growth expectations. Looking at STIRs, one market source contacted the desk noting that rates desks had been bidding some chunky sized puts in the Euribor and Short Sterling white strips, which one trader believes is likely a result of the Libors pricing in rate cuts at a slower pace than the Sonias/Eonias/OISs are in the o/n markets, leading to basis widening, that if/when central banks cut further, will tighten again. Meanwhile, some draw attention to potential dollar funding pressures amid the virus shock which could be leading desks to hedge against their collateral to avoid potential for pricey dollars, this time via puts in STIRs. Further down the Treasury curve, the term structure had flattened marginally by settlement, with the 2s10s -1bps, with the 10-year yield down 7bps to 0.922%, close to its record low of 0.899 which it printed earlier in the session. US T-note futures (H0) settled 16+ ticks higher at 136-24+.</p><p><strong>Fed's Williams (Voter, Neutral)</strong> said fundamentals of the US economy remains strong and that the coronavirus will have near-term effects on global economy. Williams also stated that central banks have an important role to play in addressing impact from the outbreak and NY Fed will ensure ample supply of reserves, while he added the Fed remains flexible and ready to make adjustments to ensure monetary policy is implemented effectively. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Kaplan (Voter, Dove)</strong> said the situation is moving so rapidly that what occurs just 3 days from now, could alter the view, while he added that ups and downs of stock market did not factor into decision to cut rates. Kaplan added that he won’t read much into jobs data for February but will be watching the path of diagnosed cases and will factor that into the decision for the March meeting. Furthermore, Kaplan suggested there will be different actions from different central banks globally and that when you have limited ammunition, it is wise to use it sooner and more boldly. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Kashkari (Voter, Dove)</strong> said he views this week's rate cut as insurance and stated that erring on side of taking out a little insurance is prudent, while he added the Fed may need to do more if the virus is really bad although could raise rates if virus the virus impact is not that bad.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets have slumped across the board as the sell-off rolls over from Wall St. where all major indices declined over 3% led by a near 1000-point drop in the DJIA amid coronavirus fears which spurred a mass flight to safety and pressured the US 10yr Treasury yields to fresh record lows. ASX 200 (-2.1%) fell deeper into correction territory as tech and financials resumed their recent underperformance although defensives and gold miners have shown some resilience on the safe-haven play, while Nikkei 225 (-3.3%) is the worst performer and has retreated below the 21000 level to a 6-month low with losses exacerbated by detrimental currency flows and contractions in Household Spending. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%) are also heavily pressured alongside the global stock rout and continued PBoC liquidity inaction. On the coronavirus front, the pace of additional confirmed cases and deaths in mainland China has continued to show a mild improvement, although this has failed to spur markets as attention is also on the increasing number of cases in other countries leading to fears of a global pandemic.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY slipped firmly to test the 96.50 level after the 10yr yield declined to a fresh record low and with Fed Fund Rate futures pricing in a near coin-toss between a 25bps and 50bps cut at this month’s FOMC. There were several Fed speakers overnight who all seemingly kept their options open with Kaplan unwilling to presume what the Fed would do and suggested the path of coronavirus cases is to be factored into the March meeting. In addition, Kashkari views the recent rate cut as insurance and suggested that Fed actions could depend on how the virus plays out, while Williams noted the Fed remains flexible and is ready to make adjustments to ensure monetary policy is implemented effectively. EUR/USD and GBP/USD are flat overnight and hold on to the prior day’s spoils against the greenback but with further advances in the single currency stalled by resistance at 1.1250 and with GBP/USD also hovering around 1.2950 following mixed rhetoric from post-Brexit negotiations in which the sides held constructive and good-natured talks but serious divergences remained. Elsewhere, USD/JPY retreated below the 106.00 handle amid safe-haven flows which has also underpinned the CHF, while antipodeans are lacklustre amid their high-beta statuses, CNY weakness and a contraction in Australian Retail Sales data.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid the sell-off in stocks and as bond prices tracked their US counterparts higher against the backdrop of record low US 10yr Treasury yields, while China’s 10yr yield also slipped to its lowest since 2002.&nbsp;</p>",
