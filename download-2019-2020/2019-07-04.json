Fed’s Powell suggested in his recent press conference that the central bank looks at the three-month trend, rather than a single print, and if the headline was realised, it would only be a touch above the three-month average rate at 155k. The pace of wage growth is seen accelerating vs May levels, while there will also be attention on the U6 underemployment rate, which fell to a cyclical low in May, amid a stable participation rate, which is seen as a positive. The data will be a key part of the FOMC’s case on whether it chooses to cut rates or stand pat on policy at the July policy meeting. The data will be released at 1330 BST/0830 EDT on 5 July 2019.

Both sides are in the process of scheduling a call, that is due to take place next week, between USTR Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and China Vice Premier Liu He. The timing of the call is yet to be confirmed. Elsewhere, MOFCOM’s Gao welcomed the US decision at the G20 not to put new tariffs on Chinese goods, but again reiterated that the removal of existing tariffs was essential for any trade deal. Kudlow said that the US has already been accommodative, and will not lift tariffs during the talks, adding that the US hopes China “will toe its end by purchasing a good many of American imports.” Separately, China’s Foreign Ministry reiterated that China will not engage in currency devaluation. Elsewhere, Moody's affirmed China’s A1 rating, outlook stable.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> <strong>ECB’s Vice President de Guindos</strong> noted that the euro area’s ongoing economic recovery faces renewed global headwinds that are weighing on the economic outlook. Moreover, uncertainties related to the rising threat of trade protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets, and geopolitical factors, including those related to Brexit, make the economic environment more challenging. In this environment, said de Guindos, continued accommodative monetary policy is necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. <strong>ECB’s Rehn</strong> was dovish in his remarks on Thursday, arguing that further monetary stimulus was required until there was an improvement in the bloc’s economic and inflation prospects. Rehn also said that the slowdown was no longer temporary, and that the ECB should be preparing for a stronger and more prolonged slowdown. He added that inflation expectations are a concern as market-based gauges are too low. Regarding a policy response, Rehn suggested that the ECB could change forward guidance, cut deposit rate, or even resume QE if needed before adding that there is flexibility to QE limits.</p><p><strong>* ECB QE: </strong>Elsewhere, the speed at which Italian yields have fallen this week has left some analysts in awe. BTPs have benefited from dovish ECB speak, and the prospect of a dovish Lagarde at the helm of the central bank, as well as the EU opting not to open up EDP on Italy over high debt levels. This all comes amid the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, data shows. With the market front-running potential ECB QE, some have noted that if the central bank were to enact the policy, they’d be buying bonds at expensive rates. Accordingly, some are reasoning that the central bank will need to move further out along the yield curve in any future operations (assuming they target government bonds, and not, say, corporate bonds), since scarcity concerns will become a factor.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong> British forces seized an oil tanker off the coast of Gibraltar, on suspicion that the vessel could be carrying Iranian oil to Syria, in violation of European and US sanctions on the country. Iran responded angrily to the seizure, calling it illegal. Analysts now note the risk of a possible Iranian retaliation in the Strait of Hormuz. Separately, Iran doubled down on contentious comments made by President Rouhani on Wednesday, where he promised the country would increase uranium enrichment levels from 7th July, so long as the remaining signatories of the 2015 nuclear deal fail to fulfil their promises. However, an Iranian intelligence minister suggested that there was scope for talks between the US and Iran if the former was to lift sanctions on Supreme Leader Khamenei.</p><p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>The energy complex had a relatively tame day of trade amid thin volumes, being lightly subdued, but rangebound, at the time of writing. The usual demand/supply factors kept the market in a limbo, where bears are running off a slowing global economy as well as Wednesday’s more bearish than expected EIA release, and bulls are digesting extended OPEC+ cuts and a geopolitical risk premium. Due to the US holidays Baker Hughes reported its US rig count early this week on Wednesday, which showed oil rigs down 5 at 788, nat gas rigs up 1 at 174, leaving total rigs down 4 at 967.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> Thin ranges characterised most FX majors, with US players on holiday.<strong> USD </strong>held onto Wednesday’s gains, while <strong>EUR</strong> has remained below 1.13 vs the buck, with dovish comments from ECB’s Rehn doing little to help the single currency. Meanwhile, <strong>GBP</strong> was uninspired, continuing to languish under 1.2600 after the run of dismal UK PMIs, and downbeat/dovish remarks from BoE Governor Carney earlier in the week. <strong>Safe havens</strong> were little moved; <strong>JPY </strong>and <strong>CHF </strong>consolidating around 107.75 and 0.9850 respectively vs the greenback. <strong>Antipodeans</strong> were slightly more active; <strong>NZD</strong> was under pressure after less encouraging comments from China regarding conditions for trade talks with the US (specifically, that existing tariffs need to be lifted for a deal). <strong>AUD</strong> held onto recent gains, which saw the AUDUSD move back above 0.70, breaching its 100dma to the upside. <strong>EMFX</strong> edged higher, as risk appetite remained positive; <strong>BRL </strong>was the outperformer as confidence grew that the special committee will vote on the pension reform bill today, which would increase the likelihood that the bill will be brought to the Lower House before the 19 July congressional recess. Analysts note that downside risks to BRL remain should pension reform bill fail to reach the lower house by this date. <strong>TRY</strong> also advanced, with USDTRY back down through 5.60 and eyeing key chart support in the form of the 200 DMA and a Fib (5.5857 and 5.5756), with traders pointing to capital inflows and investor appetite for Turkey’s 5-year bond as supplementary to the rally. <strong>ZAR</strong> was also on the front foot, USDZAR tested beneath the 14.0000 level, assisted by the bullish impetus gleaned via news that the SA Government is contemplating even more aid for Eskom, though has moved back above the 14.00 figure as Europe leaves for the day. <strong>RUB</strong> was unfazed by dovish comments from central bank chief Nabiullina, who suggested a 50bps cut could be on the cards at this month’s policy meeting.</p><p><strong>* USD: </strong>After President Trump once again bemoaned the strength of the USD, desks are analysing how the President could achieve his apparent weak dollar objectives. UBS notes that USD strength, while antagonised by the Fed recently, is more a function of better relative growth expectations between the US vs the rest of the world. UBS explores what the US could do to weaken the buck, and reason that: 1) The threat of new tariffs is likely to aggravate USD strength due to its slowing of global growth; 2) FX intervention is unlikely as it runs contrary to the consistent US preference of not manipulating FX as well as the G20 consensus, however the more the USD strengthens the more this becomes a risk. 3) Recent Fed dovishness has seen some weakness in USD, ultimately UBS suggests that USD strength is more about global growth than the Fed. 4) Reaching a trade deal may be the best way to weaken the dollar, but it won’t happen right away, and UBS says that would need markets to price in more optimistic growth and policy outcomes in China and Europe.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> As ECB policymakers make more dovish noises, and the prospect of a dovish Christine Lagarde heading the ECB after Draghi’s departure, analysts have noted that implied volatility levels have been declining: for instance, the 1-year vol fell beneath 6.0 on Wednesday for the first time since 2007.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Aussie retail sales bounced back, but still missed expectations, data overnight showed. Analysts note that Q2 retail sales data is now tracking around 0.5% Q/Q, easing from the 0.7% pace seen in Q1. Combined with the weak auto sales, indicators of consumption look weak in Q2, and augur poorly for Q2 GDP. Nevertheless, shorts continued to cover, while exporter demand was also cited for the AUD taking out its 100dma at 0.7033, and technicians are now looking for a test of the 200dma at 0.7098. One of the reasons for the Aussie strength, despite the dovish RBA, is the tax cuts implemented by the government, which some desks have said could be the equivalent of 50bps of cuts from the RBA – these cuts, it is said, take the pressure off the central bank to fire additional rate cuts. However, given the RBA monitors the Aussie (indeed, remarks from Governor Lowe recently highlight that it is monitored as part of its monetary policy transmission), the AUD strength may embolden the central bank to fire more rate cuts in order to manage upside appreciation.</p>",

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>European indices are little changed this morning [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.1%] as the region mimics&nbsp;the performance&nbsp;in Asia, which ultimately failed on materialise on optimism seen on Wall St&nbsp;where the SPX briefly surpassed the 3000 mark. It's worth noting that volumes are tepid amid US' absence from the market due to the Independence&nbsp;Day holiday.&nbsp;This morning's notable movers include Persimmon (-0.4%) after a earnings update in which H1 revenue printed below the prior. The Verdi union reached a deal with German banking sector to include overall pay hikes of 4% until the end of 2021; German banking names such as Commerzbank (-0.8%) under some mild pressure this morning which may be stemming from this agreement alongside a downgrade at JP Morgan. Separately,&nbsp; Osram Licht (+2.1%) is closer to the top of the Stoxx 600 following on from confirmation of reception towards Bain-Carlyle’s EUR 35.00 a share bid. Finally, the FTSE MIB (+0.5%) is marginally outperforming its peers as yesterday's&nbsp;confirmation that EDP procedures will not be instigated on Italy continues to generate strength in the Italian banking sector.</p><p>FX</p><p>DXY - The Dollar is relatively firm overall, as the index holds above key chart support within a tight 96.798-656 range in quiet US Independence Day trade and with several large option expiries keeping certain Usd/major pairs in check. However, the Greenback is markedly outperforming the Kiwi and Gold in contrast to heavy losses against some EM currencies, like the Turkish Lira and SA Rand.</p><p>NZD/CAD/AUD - All weaker vs their US peer, and the Kiwi especially after failing to maintain 0.6700+ status in wake of less encouraging Chinese comments on conditions for trade talks with the US (specifically that existing tariffs need to be lifted for a deal). Conversely, the Aussie has retained the 0.7000 handle and 1.0500 vs its Antipodean rival even though retail sales were a tad softer than forecast overnight and barrier defences in Aud/Usd at 0.7050 were not breached. Meanwhile, the Loonie continues to benefit from yesterday’s unexpected Canadian trade surplus and has only eased marginally from 1.3055 on the back of a downturn in oil prices.</p><p>GBP/EUR/CHF/JPY - Very little deviation vs the Usd as Cable consolidates between 1.2569-91 having lost grip of 1.2700 earlier this week during the run of dismal UK PMIs, and BoE Governor Carney’s somewhat downbeat/dovish remarks (that actually could be construed optimistic vs IHS/Markit predicting a 0.1% Q2 contraction rather than considerably weak growth). Elsewhere, the single currency is equally ensconced below a big figure amidst even more EGB yield compression and also engulfed in more hefty expiries with 1.6 bn at 1.1265, 1.3 bn from 1.1275-80, 1.8 bn at 1.1290 and 1 bn at 1.1315 vs 1.1278-95 parameters thus far. The Franc has largely shrugged off Swiss CPI, as the y/y rate stayed well below target, with Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf idling in 0.9857-69 and 1.1121-38 bands respectively, while the Yen is even more lethargic or lacklustre within 107.72-84 and like the Euro is also conscious of expiry interest close by (1.6 bn from 107.70 to 107.75).</p><p>EM - The Rand is just eclipsing the Lira in terms of relative strength vs the Buck, as Usd/Zar breaks through the 14.0000 level and gathers technical momentum to compound bullish impetus gleaned via news that the SA Government is contemplating more aid for Eskom. Meanwhile, capital inflows and voracious investor appetite for Turkey’s 5 year bond has supplemented the recovery rally, with Usd/Try down through 5.6000 and eyeing key chart support in the form of the 200 DMA and a Fib (5.5857 and 5.5756).</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>EU debt may be left to their own devices and forced to go it alone given the absence of US participants, but it has not taken long for buyers to return and push benchmarks to fresh record highs, in most if not all cases. Bunds have now hurdled 174.00 to trade at 174.04 and accordingly the equivalent 10 year yield dipped under the ECB depo rate, while Gilts have erased all and more of their early Liffe losses to post a fresh contract high as well at 132.38. In terms of latest catalysts, nothing obvious or apparent, but French and Spanish bonds did seem to derive impetus after issuance. Elsewhere, only a grinding bid and marginal flattening in US Treasuries given July 4th constraints, but in the current fixed friendly or even frenzied environment catch up gains would hardly be a surprise, pending pre-NFP positioning for Friday.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent</strong> futures remain on the backfoot this morning in the fallout from the OPEC+ deal in which a “sell the fact” scenario prompted downside whilst upside is capped amid the EIA report yesterday which showed a narrower-than-forecast drawdown in crude stockpiles and an uptick in US production. Newsflow has been light for the complex thus far, although there were reports of a supertanker being seized by a detachment of Royal Marines and Gibraltarian authorities as it was suspected of carrying oil to Syria, which breaches EU sanctions against Assad’s regime. WTI remains below the USD 57/bbl level while its Brent counterpart hovers under USD 63.50/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>Gold</strong> remains lacklustre as the yellow metal consolidates post-rally and remains north of USD 1400/oz, with volumes on the lighter side amid the US Independence Day holiday. Meanwhile, <strong>copper prices</strong> are subdued as LME inventories ticked higher, albeit downside in the red metal is somewhat capped by US-Sino trade optimism. Finally, <strong>Iron ore</strong> prices fell over 3% as the base metal consolidates from the recent back-to-back record setting rally.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Dollar is relatively firm overall, as the index holds above key chart support within a tight 96.798-656 range in quiet US Independence Day trade and with several large option expiries keeping certain Usd/major pairs in check. However, the Greenback is markedly outperforming the Kiwi and Gold in contrast to heavy losses against some EM currencies, like the Turkish Lira and SA Rand.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All weaker vs their US peer, and the Kiwi especially after failing to maintain 0.6700+ status in wake of less encouraging Chinese comments on conditions for trade talks with the US (specifically that existing tariffs need to be lifted for a deal). Conversely, the Aussie has retained the 0.7000 handle and 1.0500 vs its Antipodean rival even though retail sales were a tad softer than forecast overnight and barrier defences in Aud/Usd at 0.7050 were not breached. Meanwhile, the Loonie continues to benefit from yesterday’s unexpected Canadian trade surplus and has only eased marginally from 1.3055 on the back of a downturn in oil prices.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>Very little deviation vs the Usd as Cable consolidates between 1.2569-91 having lost grip of 1.2700 earlier this week during the run of dismal UK PMIs, and BoE Governor Carney’s somewhat downbeat/dovish remarks (that actually could be construed optimistic vs IHS/Markit predicting a 0.1% Q2 contraction rather than considerably weak growth). Elsewhere, the single currency is equally ensconced below a big figure amidst even more EGB yield compression and also engulfed in more hefty expiries with 1.6 bn at 1.1265, 1.3 bn from 1.1275-80, 1.8 bn at 1.1290 and 1 bn at 1.1315 vs 1.1278-95 parameters thus far. The Franc has largely shrugged off Swiss CPI, as the y/y rate stayed well below target, with Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf idling in 0.9857-69 and 1.1121-38 bands respectively, while the Yen is even more lethargic or lacklustre within 107.72-84 and like the Euro is also conscious of expiry interest close by (1.6 bn from 107.70 to 107.75).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Rand is just eclipsing the Lira in terms of relative strength vs the Buck, as Usd/Zar breaks through the 14.0000 level and gathers technical momentum to compound bullish impetus gleaned via news that the SA Government is contemplating more aid for Eskom. Meanwhile, capital inflows and voracious investor appetite for Turkey’s 5 year bond has supplemented the recovery rally, with Usd/Try down through 5.6000 and eyeing key chart support in the form of the 200 DMA and a Fib (5.5857 and 5.5756).</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices flatlined due to a lack of catalysts and as the impact from the risk sentiment was counterbalanced by slight USD softness, while <strong>copper</strong> languished amid indecision in China and recent pullback in iron ore prices.</p><p>US Baker Hughes Rig Count: oil rigs fell by 5 to 788, Nat gas rigs rose by 1 to 174, total rigs fell by 4 to 963.

It was confirmed today that Italy will not face disciplinary procedures by the EU due to its high debt levels, which helped BTPs. EGB’s have also been very well supported by dovish ECB remarks, as well as the prospect of Christine Lagarde heading the central bank after Draghi’s departure. Treasury trade had a thin feel to it, ahead of the July 4th market holiday on Thursday; the curve bull-flattened, with yields falling across the curve, despite strength in equities. US 10-year yields made further ground under 2.00%, with the US curve seeing yields fall to two-and-a-half year lows. There was also some influence from US President Trump’s nomination of Christopher Waller and Judy Shelton to the Fed Board of Governors; both are considered dovish candidates.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets mostly traded higher as the region benefitted from the mild tailwinds from US where stocks notched record levels and the Emini S&amp;P briefly topped the historic 3000 level due to a jubilant tone heading into the Independence Day holiday and expectations of looser central bank policy. ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) were positive with Australia lifted after reports the government secured enough support to pass its AUD 158bln tax package and with the largest-weighted financials sector among the index frontrunners, while gains in Tokyo were limited by recent currency flows and amid an ongoing dispute with South Korea in which the latter warned of countermeasures for Japan’s export curbs. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) were indecisive with the mainland subdued by another PBoC liquidity drain and as participants await the next developments in the US-China trade saga. In terms of the latest trade headlines, White House Economic Adviser Kudlow said the next round of face-to-face talks between US and China will take place soon and that the US will not lift existing tariffs during trade discussions, while there were separate reports that China is considering US agricultural purchases as a show of goodwill but with the volume likely to be smaller than before. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful as they took a breather from recent gains and with demand also dampened by mixed 30yr auction results.</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) are positive with Australia lifted amid reports the government has secured enough support to pass its AUD 158bln tax package and with the largest-weighted financials sector among the index frontrunners, while gains in Tokyo have been limited by recent currency flows and amid ongoing dispute with South Korea in which the latter has warned of countermeasures for Japan’s export curbs. Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) are mixed with the mainland subdued by another PBoC liquidity drain and as participants anticipate the next developments in the US-China trade saga. In terms of the latest trade headlines, White House Economic Adviser Kudlow said the next round of face-to-face talks between US and China will take place soon and that the US will not lift existing tariffs during trade discussions, while there were separate reports that China is considering US agricultural purchases as a show of goodwill but with the volume likely to be smaller than before.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly softer with US participants away for 4th July celebrations and after the recent mixed bag of data including ADP National Employment which missed estimates ahead of Friday’s key US NFP jobs numbers. Nonetheless, its major counterparts across the pond have failed to take advantage of the softer greenback with EUR/USD and GBP/USD stuck within the prior day’s ranges below the 1.1300 and 1.2600 handles respectively. Elsewhere, CAD traded at its strongest against USD since November and antipodeans also remained afloat due to their high-beta characteristics, in which AUD/USD printed a 2-month high and with weaker than expected Retail Sales doing little to dent the currency’s recent swagger.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful as they take a breather from recent gains and with participants also sidelined ahead of a 30yr auction later.&nbsp;</p>",
