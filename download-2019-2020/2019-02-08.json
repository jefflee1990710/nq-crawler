        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 8 Feb 2019: March trade deadline could be pushed back; Daly drops Fed bombshell",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: Equities flat, dollar up, Treasuries up, crude up.<br />* REAR VIEW: US/China trade deadline extension possibility, Strong Canadian employment report, Mnuchin &amp; Lighthizer in China talks next week, Fed&rsquo;s Daly spoke, Chipmakers down on gloomy Goldman forecast,<br />* NEXT WEEK: Swiss CPI, UK GDP Preliminary &amp; Estimates, UK Industrial &amp; Manufacturing Output, Canadian Trade Balance, ECB&#39;s de Guindos Speaking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>A senior Trump administration official floated the idea that the 1 March deadline (after which the US will up the amount of tariffs on China) could be extended if no deal was made. Some desks have been expecting this move, and there was little market reaction. Perhaps traders will take their cue from next week&rsquo;s talks in Beijing, where the US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and USTR Lighthizer will attend talks on 13-14 February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADIAN EMPLOYMENT: </strong>Canada created 66,800 jobs in January, exceeding the expected 8,000 and the previous addition of 9,300 in December, following the boom figure of 94,000 in November. Average hourly wages ticked up to 1.8% from the previous 2018 low of 1.5% and the unemployment rate ticked up by 0.2ppts to 5.8% on higher participation. Analysts at ING Economics noted that &ldquo;both full-time and part-time positions drove January job gains, reinforcing our view the economy is still in good health.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Daly (non-voter) says US economy is slowing down, that in itself will help prevent a recession; Daly notes financial conditions are tighter now than at the start of 2018. On the yield curve, Daly said it is likely to be flatter in the future for a variety of reasons including lower risk premiums. On the balance sheet, Daly said she was open to the discussion of whether it will be a regular or purely emergency tool, she says currently interest rates are the main tool; Daly also said Fed is discussing whether QE should be used only in emergencies or more readily; says patience is data-dependent, not time-dependent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.08 HIGHER AT USD 52.72/BBL, BRENT (J9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.47 HIGHER AT USD 62.10/BBL. </strong>In the pre-market, book-squaring ahead of the weekend was attributed as the reason why crude had (temporarily) broken its correlation with US equities. However, as the Europeans left for the weekend, the crude/stocks relationship we have become accustomed to of late reasserted itself, dragging crude lower on &quot;lingering concerns over US/China trade, and global growth&quot; according to one newswire. Crude was offered support from Libya, where the NOC reportedly called for protection of the 315k El Sharara field to try and combat the armed protestors. There is a big question mark over when production will be restarted; &quot;recent developments make clear that political stability and normalised production is likely a long way off for Libya,&quot; UBS&#39; sales desk writes. However, Citi&#39;s analysts are more sanguine, and are optimistic that the Libyan Army moving in may help to stabilise the situation, and Sharara could restart &#39;imminently&#39;. Baker Hughes Rig Count total rigs +4 at 1059; oil rigs +7 at 854; gas rigs -3 at 195.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.1% at 2708, NASDAQ +0.1% at 7299, DJI +0.3% at 25104. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.9%, Materials -0.2%, Industrials +0.0%, Cons Discretionary -0.7%, Cons Staples +0.4%, Healthcare +0.0%, Financials -0.7%, Tech +0.4%, Telecoms +0.3%, Utilities +0.4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Earnings from Coty (COTY), Mattel (MAT) and Motorola (MSI) all came in stronger than expected seeing the three stocks surge on Friday. Phillips 66 (PSX) opened higher after beating EPS estimates. Chipmakers Micron Technology (MU) and Western Digital (WDC) traded lower after Goldman commented cautiously on them due to a lower forecast in DRAM and NAND pricing. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (GT) nosedived following a miss on top and bottom line estimates. Qorvo (QRVO) opened lower after it gave pessimistic guidance. Arconic (ARNC) drifted lower through the day on the announcement of the co. splitting into two and despite reporting strong earnings. Electronic Arts (EA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED +3 TICKS AT 122-12. </strong>Much of the movement in the T-Note was sideways on Friday, with a slight upward bias, inspired by the usual cocktail of lingering concerns over US/China trade, and global growth. A brief dip in the pre-market was attributed to dealers unloading auction long positions, while Bunds were providing some influence in early trade too. Profit-taking at the end of the European day saw some of the gains pared back to leave the T-Note 3 ticks higher at settlement. Major curve spreads were mixed, but generally +/- 1bps at settle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP: </strong>CAD: The Loonie is on course to end the week as top G10 performer having pared losses vs its US counterpart to circa 1.3230 at one stage from almost a big figure higher ahead of Canadian jobs data revealing a much bigger rise in payrolls, and an encouraging rebound in the number of full time workers. However, the Cad is still significantly weaker than it was at &lsquo;open&rsquo; on Monday (1.3095), partly due to relative Usd strength, broad risk aversion, lower crude prices and a leak at Transcanada&rsquo;s keystone pipeline that forced its closure. Usd/Cad now around 1.3260.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Off worst levels and getting drawn towards decent option expiries from 0.7090 to 0.7105 ahead of the NY cut, but still the major loser this week as the RBA switched from a tightening bias to neutral mode, and officially inserted a rate cut option, if the labour market, growth and inflation weakens. Interestingly, or annoyingly for some, the change in policy stance was not revealed at Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting, but in a speech from Governor Lowe the next day, and then underscored in the SOMP that included GDP and CPI forecast downgrades. Aud/Usd currently just shy of 0.7100 within a 0.7265-0.7060 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Another laggard, with Cable down some 250 pips from high (1.3103) to low (1.2857) on a combination of ongoing Brexit uncertainty, more UK PMI misses and a dovish/downbeat skew to the BoE&rsquo;s MPC minutes and QIR. However, &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday ended on a brighter note for the Pound as Governor Carney underlined that there is no automated response to a no deal scenario, and despite heightened uncertainty and a more pronounced downturn in the economy since the November meeting, more clarity between now and March 29 could lift growth, confidence and investment. Nevertheless, Cable remains around 1.2950 after the latest attempts by PM May to prize an alternative Irish backstop plan from Brussels failed ahead of more talks scheduled for the end of February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD: </strong>The Kiwi dovetailed with its antipodean peer throughout the week as Aud/Nzd veered from 1.0535 down to around 1.0400 and back up to 1.0500 again. However, Nzd/Usd is much closer to 0.6730 lows than highs just above 0.6900, partly on the aforementioned downturn in overall risk sentiment and a weaker than forecast NZ Q4 employment report just ahead of next week&rsquo;s RNBZ meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency has also endured a tough week, largely due to a raft of Eurozone data/surveys highlighting a marked slowdown in the German economy and an even more pronounced downturn in Italy. The ECB monthly bulletin also pressured the Eur with a repetition of downside risks flagged in January&rsquo;s policy meeting, but the final straw came via updated EU Commission forecasts that confirmed pre-release reports that Italian GDP would be slashed, and included pretty big downgrades to other bloc members and the pan estimate. Eur/Usd is just above 1.1320 vs 1.1465 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY/CHF: </strong>The safe havens have been relatively contained vs the Greenback between 110.15-109.50 and 1.0030-0.9940, even though the Dollar and index have posted gains on the week overall (DXY just off its best level of the week at 96.700 vs 95.571 at worst). Risk off positioning has been a supportive factor, although for the Franc more evident vs the Eur (cross down around 1.1330 at present vs 1.1445 at the other extreme).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK/SEK: </strong>In stark contrast to the above, risk aversion has contributed to the downside for both Scandi crowns, along with bearish technicals/stops, oil&rsquo;s retreat and some disappointing data that could see the Riksbank deliver a more cautious statement next week, and the Norges Bank potentially signal one more and done in March (if of course it does go ahead with another hike). Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek closer to 9.7746 and 10.5150 weekly peaks vs 9.6550 and 10.3650 troughs respectively as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>COMING-UP: </strong>Monday: China Caixin Services PMI, UK GDP, Eurogroup meeting Tuesday: OPEC Monthly Report, RBNZ Interest Rate Decision, Japanese PPI Wednesday: Riksbank Interest Rate Decisions, UK CPI, EU Industrial Production, US CPI, Japanese GDP, IEA Monthly Oil Market Report Thursday: 2nd Brexit Meaningful Vote, Indonesian Interest Rate Decision, US PPI, Eurozone GDP &amp; Employment, China Trade Balance Friday: China CPI, UK Retail Sales, Eurozone Trade Balance, NY Empire State Manufacturing Index, Uni of Michigan (Prelim) Click here to access the <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21133/download\">RANsquawk Week In Focus report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>Central Bank Weekly</strong>: Reviewing ECB, BOE, RBA, RBI, CBR, BCB, Banxico; Previewing RBNZ, Riksbank Click here to access the <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21134/download\">RANsquawk Central Bank Weekly report</a></p>\r\n",

However, as the Europeans left for the weekend, the crude/stocks relationship we have become accustomed to of late reasserted itself, dragging crude lower on &quot;lingering concerns over US/China trade, and global growth&quot; according to one newswire.

There is a big question mark over when production will be restarted; &quot;recent developments make clear that political stability and normalised production is likely a long way off for Libya,&quot; UBS&#39; sales desk writes. However, Citi&#39;s analysts are more sanguine, and are optimistic that the Libyan Army moving in may help to stabilise the situation, and Sharara could restart &#39;imminently&#39;.

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Loonie gets data reprieve, Aussie extends RBA Lowes and Pound buffeted by BoE",
        "content": "<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie is on course to end the week as top G10 performer having pared losses vs its US counterpart to circa 1.3230 at one stage from almost a big figure higher ahead of Canadian jobs data revealing a much bigger rise in payrolls, and an encouraging rebound in the number of full time workers. However, the Cad is still significantly weaker than it was at &lsquo;open&rsquo; on Monday (1.3095), partly due to relative Usd strength, broad risk aversion, lower crude prices and a leak at Transcanada&rsquo;s keystone pipeline that forced its closure. Usd/Cad now around 1.3260.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Off worst levels and getting drawn towards decent option expiries from 0.7090 to 0.7105 ahead of the NY cut, but still the major loser this week as the RBA switched from a tightening bias to neutral mode, and officially inserted a rate cut option, if the labour market, growth and inflation weakens. Interestingly, or annoyingly for some, the change in policy stance was not revealed at Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting, but in a speech from Governor Lowe the next day, and then underscored in the SOMP that included GDP and CPI forecast downgrades. Aud/Usd currently just shy of 0.7100 within a 0.7265-0.7060 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another laggard, with Cable down some 250 pips from high (1.3103) to low (1.2857) on a combination of ongoing Brexit uncertainty, more UK PMI misses and a dovish/downbeat skew to the BoE&rsquo;s MPC minutes and QIR. However, &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday ended on a brighter note for the Pound as Governor Carney underlined that there is no automated response to a no deal scenario, and despite heightened uncertainty and a more pronounced downturn in the economy since the November meeting, more clarity between now and March 29 could lift growth, confidence and investment. Nevertheless, Cable remains around 1.2950 after the latest attempts by PM May to prize an alternative Irish backstop plan from Brussels failed ahead of more talks scheduled for the end of February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi dovetailed with its antipodean peer throughout the week as Aud/Nzd veered from 1.0535 down to around 1.0400 and back up to 1.0500 again. However, Nzd/Usd is much closer to 0.6730 lows than highs just above 0.6900, partly on the aforementioned downturn in overall risk sentiment and a weaker than forecast NZ Q4 employment report just ahead of next week&rsquo;s RNBZ meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has also endured a tough week, largely due to a raft of Eurozone data/surveys highlighting a marked slowdown in the German economy and an even more pronounced downturn in Italy. The ECB monthly bulletin also pressured the Eur with a repetition of downside risks flagged in January&rsquo;s policy meeting, but the final straw came via updated EU Commission forecasts that confirmed pre-release reports that Italian GDP would be slashed, and included pretty big downgrades to other bloc members and the pan estimate. Eur/Usd is just above 1.1320 vs 1.1465 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The safe havens have been relatively contained vs the Greenback between 110.15-109.50 and 1.0030-0.9940, even though the Dollar and index have posted gains on the week overall (DXY just off its best level of the week at 96.700 vs 95.571 at worst). Risk off positioning has been a supportive factor, although for the Franc more evident vs the Eur (cross down around 1.1330 at present vs 1.1445 at the other extreme).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stark contrast to the above, risk aversion has contributed to the downside for both Scandi crowns, along with bearish technicals/stops, oil&rsquo;s retreat and some disappointing data that could see the Riksbank deliver a more cautious statement next week, and the Norges Bank potentially signal one more and done in March (if of course it does go ahead with another hike). Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek closer to 9.7746 and 10.5150 weekly peaks vs 9.6550 and 10.3650 troughs respectively as a result.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.3%) was led lower by underperformance in the energy sector following the recent drop in crude prices and with financials downbeat amid a management shake-up due to fraud allegations at NAB. Nikkei 225 (-2.0%) was pressured by a firmer currency and as individual stocks also reacted to earnings, while the Hang Seng (-0.2%) suffered a bout of post-holiday blues on return from the Lunar New Year celebrations, as hopes for a quick trade deal were dampened after US President Trump ruled out meeting with his Chinese counterpart prior to the tariff deadline. In addition, reports suggested that President Trump is likely to sign an order banning Chinese telecoms equipment next week which subsequently weighed on ZTE shares. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as the widespread risk averse tone underpinned safe-haven demand and BoJ presence in the market for nearly JPY 1.2tln of JGBs with maturities of up to 10yrs, which also coincided with declines in long-term yields with the 20yr, 30yr and 40yr yields at their lowest in more than 2 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA Statement on Monetary Policy stated the probability of rate hike or cut is more evenly balanced than previous and that the board does not see a strong case for a near term adjustment in rates. RBA noted that higher rates would be appropriate at some point if progress is made but added that they might lower rates if there is sustained increase in unemployment and too low inflation, while it cut its GDP and inflation forecasts through to June 2020. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reported that US President Trump is likely to sign an order banning Chinese telecoms equipment next week. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bullard (Voter, Dove) said FOMC has moved in a more dovish direction and needs to tread carefully moving forward amid weak inflation and other signals the economy is facing greater risks than had expected. Bullard also stated the Fed is likely to end up with a larger than anticipated balance sheet and that he considers current level of rates as restrictive, while he sees growth this year at 2.5% and considerably weaker than the prior year, with risks for an even sharper slowdown. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May approached Labour MPs to table an amendment for the withdrawal motion and will guarantee the UK matches EU regarding workers&rsquo; rights post-Brexit following a deal with the Labour Party. (The Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian Deputy PM Salvini reportedly wants to summon the French Interior Minister to discuss Italian terrorists in France; according to ANSA. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US plans to withdraw all troops from Syria by the end of April. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US and South Korea will announce military exercise plan following the Trump-Kim summit according to sources, while there were also reports that US asked North Korea to dismantle all missiles. (Yonhap)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equities have been flat throughout much of the session [Euro Stoxx 50 Unch], with some mild outperformance seen in the FTSE MIB (+0.1%) where Bper Banca (+0.8%) and UniCredit (+1.9%) are in the green following earnings and the Co&rsquo;s CEO stating they do not see any upcoming cross border banking mergers respectively. Sectors are mostly in the green, with IT names leading. Other notable movers include Wirecard (+2.7%) who are towards the top of the Stoxx 600 having retraced some of the prior sessions&rsquo; losses following the FT reporting an analysis of the Co&rsquo;s accounting scandal; recently the Co. have stated they are taking legal action against the FT over the reporting as they believe that no misconduct has taken place. Skanska AB (-6.9%) are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following their earnings and the Co. stating they are planning a dividend cut. Elsewhere, L&rsquo;Oreal (+0.4%) are slightly firmer following their earnings, and Travis Perkins (+1.5%) are higher after being upgraded at RBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US are reportedly considering 3 potential car tariff options, one of which includes a 10% levy; according to German press. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The first option is a levy of 10%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The second option is customs duties, which would be limited to technologically advanced cars such as e-cars and their components.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The third option is a 25% tariff which remains on the table</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/GBP/EUR - It&rsquo;s tight at the foot of the G10 table, with the Aussie and Pound looking particularly weak, but the single currency also on the precipice after more signs of Italy&rsquo;s economic woes via a sharp decline in IP. Aud/Usd is only just off fresh lows of 0.7060 having filled bids and tested chart support around 0.7075 in wake of RBA&rsquo;s SOMP that effectively confirmed the shift in policy stance to neutral from tightening signalled by Governor Lowe earlier in the week. However, hefty option interest between 0.7090-0.7105 may provide some respite with 1.1 bn expiries rolling off at the NY cut. Meanwhile, Cable has lost more recovery momentum from just shy of the 1.3000 mark after BoE super Thursday, as UK PM May returned from Brussels empty handed with the Irish border backstop issue unresolved. A 1.2926 Fib level is now being probed, ahead of 1.2900 and then the 100 DMA at 1.2893.

Sectors are mostly in the green, with IT names leading. Other notable movers include Wirecard (+2.3%) who are towards the top of the Stoxx 600 having retraced some of the prior sessions&rsquo; losses following the FT reporting an analysis of the Co&rsquo;s accounting scandal; recently the Co. have stated they are taking legal action against the FT over the reporting as they believe that no misconduct has taken place. Skanska AB (-6.9%) are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following their earnings and the Co. stating they are planning a dividend cut. Elsewhere, L&rsquo;Oreal (+0.4%) are slightly firmer following their earnings, and Travis Perkins (+1.6%) are higher after being upgraded at RBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/GBP/EUR - It&rsquo;s tight at the foot of the G10 table, with the Aussie and Pound looking particularly weak, but the single currency also on the precipice after more signs of Italy&rsquo;s economic woes via a sharp decline in IP. Aud/Usd is only just off fresh lows of 0.7060 having filled bids and tested chart support around 0.7075 in wake of RBA&rsquo;s SOMP that effectively confirmed the shift in policy stance to neutral from tightening signalled by Governor Lowe earlier in the week. However, hefty option interest between 0.7090-0.7105 may provide some respite with 1.1 bn expiries rolling off at the NY cut. Meanwhile, Cable has lost more recovery momentum from just shy of the 1.3000 mark after BoE super Thursday, as UK PM May returned from Brussels empty handed with the Irish border backstop issue unresolved. A 1.2926 Fib level is now being probed, ahead of 1.2900 and then the 100 DMA at 1.2893.

        "content": "<p>AUD/GBP/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s tight at the foot of the G10 table, with the Aussie and Pound looking particularly weak, but the single currency also on the precipice after more signs of Italy&rsquo;s economic woes via a sharp decline in IP. Aud/Usd is only just off fresh lows of 0.7060 having filled bids and tested chart support around 0.7075 in wake of RBA&rsquo;s SOMP that effectively confirmed the shift in policy stance to neutral from tightening signalled by Governor Lowe earlier in the week. However, hefty option interest between 0.7090-0.7105 may provide some respite with 1.1 bn expiries rolling off at the NY cut. Meanwhile, Cable has lost more recovery momentum from just shy of the 1.3000 mark after BoE super Thursday, as UK PM May returned from Brussels empty handed with the Irish border backstop issue unresolved. A 1.2926 Fib level is now being probed, ahead of 1.2900 and then the 100 DMA at 1.2893. Back to Eur/Usd, the headline pair is currently cresting yesterday&rsquo;s 1.1325 low, and if breached 1.1300 looms before stronger downside chart support at 1.1289.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/NZD/JPY/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All relative outperformers, or at least holding up better vs a generally firm Usd as the DXY nudges back up to 96.700. The Franc is resisting 1.0030 and the Kiwi is still pivoting 0.6750, albeit partly due to favourable cross flows as Aud/Nzd retreats below 1.0500 again. Usd/Jpy is consolidating between 109.50-110.00 and the Loonie has pared some losses after declining through 1.3300 to 1.3330 at one stage, perhaps in preparation for Canadian unemployment data due later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although broad risk sentiment has improved somewhat ahead of the weekend, the Scandi crowns remain on the back foot, with Eur/Nok above 9.7500 after mixed Norwegian Q4 GDP data, and Eur/Sek over 10.5000 following stops and outright weak Swedish household consumption.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>UK debt and STIR contracts are mildly firmer having rallied on the MPC minutes and QIR yesterday, but then unwinding gains and a bit more when BoE Governor Carney delivered a more balanced outlook in prepared text and during the Q&amp;A. However, the bottom line is that risks of a no deal Brexit inherently rise as the clock ticks down to March 29 with no sign of a breakthrough on the backstop, and this has heightened uncertainty alongside weighing more heavily on the domestic economy. Hence, further policy normalisation is on hold and the Bank may yet have to provide extra stimulus in the worst case scenario (recession), so at the very least tightening expectations have been pushed back again. Back to Liffe, Gilts are meandering between 124.15-05 vs their 124.05 previous settlement, and the 3 month strip is 0.5-1.5 ticks ahead.</p>\r\n",

Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were lower by c.5bps at settlement.

Demand was evident with the auction coming in on the screws at 3.022%, the lowest yield since July 2018 and below the six-auction tail size average of 0.45bps. Spreads widened across the curve.

ASX 200 (-0.4%) is lower with the energy sector underperforming following the recent drop in crude prices and with financials downbeat amid the recent management shake-up due to fraud allegations at NAB, but with losses somewhat contained after the RBA Statement on Monetary Policy confirmed the central bank&rsquo;s dovish shift. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-1.7%) is pressured by a firmer currency and with individual stocks also reacting to earnings, while the Hang Seng (-0.9%) suffers a bout of post-holiday blues on return from the Lunar New Year closures, with hopes for a US-China trade deal dampened after US President Trump ruled out meeting with Chinese President Xi prior to the tariff deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is slightly firmer after having rebounded from the prior day&rsquo;s fluctuations while its major counterparts EUR/USD and GBP/USD have steadied as most major pairs struggle for direction overnight. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses languish as the risk averse tone spurs flows into the JPY, while antipodeans once again took focus with AUD/USD the underperformer after the RBA Statement on Monetary Policy in which it reiterated the more evenly balanced view on rates and lowered its projections for economic growth and inflation through to 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as the widespread risk averse tone underpins safe-haven demand and with the BoJ also in the market for nearly JPY 1.2tln of JGBs with maturities of up to 10yrs.</p>\r\n",
