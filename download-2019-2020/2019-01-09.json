The net impact was a steepening of major curve spreads (2s5s +1bps at settlement, 2s10s +10bps, 2s30s +4.5bps, 5s30s +4bps). On the note of supply, the US sold 10-year notes in a stellar auction; although cover was in line with recent averages, the yield was the lowest at a 10s auction in nearly a year, and we saw a stop through of 0.8bps. The direct bid returned with a vengeance, taking their highest share at 10s auctions since May 2015, leaving dealers with a share below recent averages.

The release suggested that many policymakers thought that the Fed could be patient about further policy tightening due to muted inflationary pressures. Most policymakers said it was appropriate to raise rates, although a few preferred to keep them unchanged (there was no dissent in the vote, you will recall). The voting members said the change on policy guidance in the statement was meant to convey that the central bank judged a relatively limited amount of additional tightening would be appropriate based on current information. On the balance sheet, several participants commented on the possibility of reducing agency MBS holdings somewhat more quickly than the passive approach by implementing a program of very gradual MBS sales, while some participants said it was possible to slow the decline in reserves in approaching the long-run level of reserves. On recent market gyrations, participants said recent volatile markets as well as concerns about a slowdown in global growth made the appropriateness and timing of future rate hikes less clear than it was earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The US released a short statement after trade talks concluded with China, announcing that the two sides have discussed reciprocity and the need for any trade agreement to include ongoing verification and effective enforcement; the US has also pledged to buy more US agriculture goods. Nonetheless the document did not contain updates on forced technology and intellectual property right protection, major sticking points in the negotiations. Alongside this, the EU warned they will not accept a US-China trade deal that distorts the playing field. Also, the EU Commission were reportedly said to seek a mandate for US free trade deal while EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom announced that the EU are to discuss subsidies with the US and Japan. She went on to say that EU are expecting to not be facing US car tariffs, showing willingness to to include cars in their US trade talks though the two sides are yet to agree on the scope of trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The UK Government lost the vote on the Grieve amendment meaning that PM May now has 3 days to present the next steps on Brexit if her deal is rejected in Parliament next week. Note that, similar to yesterday&rsquo;s defeat on the finance bill amendment, the result of the vote does not make a hard Brexit a less unlikely scenario but rather makes government operations much more difficult under such a scenario. In the aftermath of the vote, a spokesperson to PM May made reassurance stating she will provide certainty on a way forward if she loses a Brexit deal vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed&#39;s Evans (Voter, Dove) still expects 3 hikes in 2019 if his forecasts are met; he believes the Fed has time to look at the situation before the next rate hike and stands ready to change his policy outlook depending on performance; for now, given tame inflation, the Fed can wait and take stock of the incoming data. He sees growing risks but still expects rates to rise a bit above neutral while he warned that tighter financial conditions may be a healthy &quot;recalibration&quot; after earlier optimism. Fed&#39;s Bullard (Voter, Dove) took a stand against more interest rate hikes as he thinks rates have gone high enough and they could endanger an otherwise strong economy; he also told the WSJ that no more hikes are warranted and that they have done enough to pre-empt inflation rises. Fed&#39;s Rosengren (Voter, Hawk) stressed there should be no particular bias toward raising or lowering rates until the data more clearly indicate the path for economic growth and monetary policy should not be on a set course, as it should take into account and reflect the data. He does however think it is possible that the Fed will need to lower interest rates, but it is not in his view. He is more optimistic than what recent market volatility would suggest; he believes current policy is appropriately balancing risks, and the Fed can be patient about any adjustments. Trade tensions, geopolitics could change economic forecasts and Fed policy. Fed&#39;s Bostic (Non-voter, Dove) also suggested that policy could move into either direction and he is open to the possibility of a rate cut if downside risk all come to bear. He believes the Fed hike in December has likely lifted rates close to neutral; he expects solid US growth in 2019 but slightly slower than 2018 warning that business contacts indicate that firms are becoming defensive in planning for a slowdown and are holding off on investment plans. He also said that the Fed is worried about the Government shutdown impact on data, as the shutdown could push back the type of growth the Fed has projected. He believes the shape of the yield curve on its own cannot be taken as a signal of recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>The Bank of Canada kept rates unchanged at 1.75% as expected, but introduced tweaks to its guidance stating that rates will need to rise &ldquo;over time&rdquo; into a neutral range to achieve its inflation target. The central bank therefore maintained its tightening bias emphasizing that the pace of rate increases will depend on developments in the oil market, housing market and global trade policy while acknowledging that global economic expansion is continuing to moderate though &quot;modest amount of excess capacity&quot; opening up. At the press conference, Governor Poloz clarified that the use of the expression &quot;over time&quot; in the rate decision was intended to add a degree of ambiguity, meaning there is no pre-set course while still believing that interest rates over time will be higher. In terms of forecasts, it cut is annualised Q4 GDP estimate to 1.3% from 2.3% and trimmed its overall 2019 GDP forecast to 1.7% from 2.1%; it sees Q1 GDP at 0.8%. Despite headwinds and downward revisions, the economy is operating close to its potential with unemployment at its lowest level in 40 years and inflation in proximity to the 2% target. ING notes that following a more dovish tone at the October meeting and softening economic momentum pushed the BoC to stand pat in January; analysts expect tightening to resume in Q2 and predict this could be as soon as April, depending on a Fed hike in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE:</strong> BoE&#39;s Carney reiterated that future rate hikes are to be limited and gradual, indicating that the MPC will be &quot;prudent not passive&quot; whatever path UK economy takes after Brexit. He highlighted that Brexit uncertainties are starting to show up more in other asset prices, like UK focussed equity prices and bank funding costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G9) SETTLES $2.58 HIGHER AT $52.36/BBL; BRENT (H8) SETTLES $2.72 HIGHER AT $61.44. </strong>Crude extended its gains for the seventh consecutive session, with WTI rising above USD 50/bbl for the first time this year. Gains were driven by rising optimism over trade as US-China talks carried over into a third day, with Citi&rsquo;s analysts saying a deal would help alleviate concerns over slowing growth. A softer dollar also supported the commodity complex, amid a firmer risk tone, underpinned by dovish Fed chatter and minutes. Crude prices dropped slightly after the DOE release, which saw a draw of 1.7mln barrels for the headline, less than the expected draw of 2.8mln; In the products, gasoline built by 8.1mln barrels, which was larger than the expected build of 3.4mln and distillates built by 10.6mln barrels, far in excess of the expected build of 1.9mln. Citi analysts note that the strong builds in products reflect seasonal factors to a degree, but are still more than typical, creating a bear case for prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX +0.41% at 2585, NDX +0.75% at 6601, DJI +0.39% at 23879.

The net impact was a steepening of major curve spreads (2s5s +1bps at settlement, 2s10s +10bps, 2s30s +4.5bps, 5s30s +4bps). On the note of supply, the US sold 10-year notes in a stellar auction; although cover was in line with recent averages, the yield was the lowest at a 10s auction in nearly a year, and we saw a stop through of 0.8bps.

The last auction, despite stopping through by 0.2bps, saw cover fall to a post crisis low (2.06x). The breakdown showed direct bidder participation rising from 3% to 12%, driven by stronger domestic investor participation (rebounding to 62% from 49%). &ldquo;The 30-year sector does not seem to have a clear setup for the upcoming bond auction and will likely need a concession to be underwritten smoothly,&rdquo; Societe General&rsquo;s analysts, who argue that the sector seems rich on the spline versus the old 30s, with the outright yield trading below the past two auction stops and rich by almost 18bp compared with the December stop. &ldquo;In addition, the sector is not particularly cheap on the curve, the 10s30s curve flattening by more than 6bp since Thursday,&rdquo; SocGen says. The bank suggests that record holdings in the sector by primary dealers could also be a negative for the auction. And additionally, it is worth keeping in mind that Fed Chair Powell is scheduled to speak an hour before the auction, which could present a risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The index has remained sub-96.000 and continued to extend losses shortly after the Wall St. open to breach 95.500 to the downside and test 95.200 (vs high of 95.920) as the third day of US-China trade talks seem to have concluded on an upbeat, constructive note. Earlier in the day, China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry stated that the longer dialogue signifies seriousness. The US statement on the talks show that negotiators discussed reciprocity and the need for any trade agreement to include ongoing verification and effective enforcement. It is worth noting that downside moves could have been exacerbated by Fed&rsquo;s Bostic (non-voter, dove) highlighting the option for the Fed to cut rates if downside risks all come to bear. From a technical standpoint, there is clean air all the way to 95.000 ahead of the October 2018 low at 94.790.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, EUR: </strong>Another day, another defeat for the UK Government as the Parliament voted on the Dominic Grieve amendment after the passing of the &ldquo;Grieve amendment&rdquo; provided some impetus to the Pound as the second Government defeat recedes fears of a no-deal Brexit, with the Government losing yet more power. Cable was little moved upon the Government defeat, though USD action took Cable closer to intraday highs just under 1.2800, above its 50 DMA at 1.2771 ahead of a Fib level at 1.2810. Meanwhile, the EUR is firmer, though as movement were largely dominated by the dollar as an upbeat EZ unemployment rate and wider-than-expected German trade surplus did little to budge the single currency as exports fell more-than-expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK, NOK: </strong>Mixed trade for the Scandi Crowns after the SEK experienced a volatile session following the Riksbank Minutes from the December meeting which initially saw a firmer Crown as several Board Members noted that even though the inflation forecast for the next few years has also been revised downwards slightly, the conditions are still good for inflation to remain close to the 2% inflation target. Nordea notes that the release was marginally dovish given the risks surrounding the repo path downgrade. The Norwegian crown on the other hand was largely dominated and underpinned by the spike in oil. EUR/SEK rose to highs of 10.2440 vs lows of 10.2196 while EUR/NOK remains around the middle of a 9.7533-7857 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The BoC stood pat on rates at 1.75% as expected while stating that rates will need to rise &ldquo;over time&rdquo; into a neutral range to achieve its inflation target. The CB unsurprisingly cut its 2018 and 2019 Q4 GDP forecast to 2.0% (Prev. 2.1%) and 1.9% (Prev. 2.0%) respectively, while upgrading 2020 Q4 to 2.1% (Prev. 1.8%).&nbsp; In terms of inflation forecasts, 2018 Q4 forecasts were cut to 2.0% (Prev. 2.3%) while 2019 and 2020 Q4 were maintained at 2.0%. USD/CAD initially saw a dovish reaction as and rose to levels just shy of 1.3250 as the Central Bank noted cut its growth and inflation forecasts, although this was expected. The currency pair then headed lower in a hawkish move to a low print of 1.3180 in light of the of BoC maintained a tightening bias by noting that rates will rise &ldquo;over time&rdquo; into a neutral range depending on oil market and trade developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD:</strong> Largest beneficiaries of positive trade discussions as the antipodeans take impetus from the rising oil and base metal prices which resulted in NZD/USD temporarily reclaiming 0.6800 (vs. low 0.6646) to the upside to revisit levels last seen mid-Dec 2018. Meanwhile, AUD was slightly hampered overnight by the release of disappointing Australian building approvals overnight while AMP Capital&rsquo;s Chief Economist said he sees the RBA cutting rates to 1.00% this year (currently 1.50%) due to a fall in building approvals and negative wealth effects from declining house prices dragging on economic growth. Nevertheless, the Aussie is up almost 0.7% against the buck and in close proximity to 0.7200 to the upside as the 50 and 100 DMA formed a golden cross just below 0.7190.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> Having unwound some risk premium earlier, the Yen was largely led by dollar action in recent trade. The pair tested a high of 109.00 at one point before USD weakness sent USD/JPY through its 50 and 100 DMAs (at 108.74 and 108.43 respectively) to a low around 108.15. Meanwhile, EUR/JPY traded in a relatively tight intra-day range of 124.40-125.00.</p>\r\n",

A softer dollar also supported the commodity complex, amid a firmer risk tone, underpinned by dovish Fed chatter and minutes. Crude prices dropped slightly after the DOE release, which saw a draw of 1.7mln barrels for the headline, less than the expected draw of 2.8mln; In the products, gasoline built by 8.1mln barrels, which was larger than the expected build of 3.4mln and distillates built by 10.6mln barrels, far in excess of the expected build of 1.9mln. Citi analysts note that the strong builds in products reflect seasonal factors to a degree, but are still more than typical, creating a bear case for prices.</p>\r\n",

The release suggested that many policymakers thought that the Fed could be patient about further policy tightening due to muted inflationary pressures. Most policymakers said it was appropriate to raise rates, although a few preferred to keep them unchanged (there was no dissent in the vote, you will recall). The voting members said the change on policy guidance in the statement was meant to convey that the central bank judged a relatively limited amount of additional tightening would be appropriate based on current information. On the balance sheet, several participants commented on the possibility of reducing agency MBS holdings somewhat more quickly than the passive approach by implementing a program of very gradual MBS sales, while some participants said it was possible to slow the decline in reserves in approaching the long-run level of reserves. On recent market gyrations, participants said recent volatile markets as well as concerns about a slowdown in global growth made the appropriateness and timing of future rate hikes less clear than it was earlier.</p>\r\n",

The minutes are expected to show some signs the FOMC is tilting dovishly, though the Fed&rsquo;s more accommodating commentary is unlikely to be fully captured in the minutes, given much of the pivot occurred in speeches post the December FOMC meeting. Traders will be mindful of comments regarding the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet run-off policy (currently on autopilot) after Chair Powell and NY Fed President Williams signalled there may be some flexibility if required. Elsewhere, following the November meeting minutes, traders will be attentive to further discussion on moving away from the &lsquo;further gradual increases&rsquo; language.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "FX Wrap: DXY slides on US-China progress and Bostic’s rate cut option",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; The index has remained sub-96.000 and continued to extend losses shortly after the Wall St. open to breach 95.500 to the downside and test 95.200 (vs high of 95.920) as the third day of US-China trade talks seem to have concluded on an upbeat, constructive note. Earlier in the day, China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry stated that the longer dialogue signifies seriousness. The US statement on the talks show that negotiators discussed reciprocity and the need for any trade agreement to include ongoing verification and effective enforcement. It is worth noting that downside moves could have been exacerbated by Fed&rsquo;s Bostic (non-voter, dove) highlighting the option for the Fed to cut rates if downside risks all come to bear. From a technical standpoint, there is clean air all the way to 95.000 ahead of the October 2018 low at 94.790.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong> &ndash; Another day, another defeat for the UK Government as the Parliament voted on the Dominic Grieve amendment after the passing of the &ldquo;Grieve amendment&rdquo; provided some impetus to the Pound as the second Government defeat recedes fears of a no-deal Brexit, with the Government losing yet more power. Cable was little moved upon the Government defeat, though USD action took Cable closer to intraday highs just under 1.2800, above its 50 DMA at 1.2771 ahead of a Fib level at 1.2810. Meanwhile, the EUR is firmer, though as movement were largely dominated by the dollar as an upbeat EZ unemployment rate and wider-than-expected German trade surplus did little to budge the single currency as exports fell more-than-expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK, NOK </strong>&ndash; Mixed trade for the Scandi Crowns after the SEK experienced a volatile session following the Riksbank Minutes from the December meeting which initially saw a firmer Crown as several Board Members noted that even though the inflation forecast for the next few years has also been revised downwards slightly, the conditions are still good for inflation to remain close to the 2% inflation target. Nordea notes that the release was marginally dovish given the risks surrounding the repo path downgrade. The Norwegian crown on the other hand was largely dominated and underpinned by the spike in oil. EUR/SEK rose to highs of 10.2440 vs lows of 10.2196 while EUR/NOK remains around the middle of a 9.7533-7857 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD </strong>&ndash; The BoC stood pat on rates at 1.75% as expected while stating that rates will need to rise &ldquo;over time&rdquo; into a neutral range to achieve its inflation target. The CB unsurprisingly cut its 2018 and 2019 Q4 GDP forecast to 2.0% (Prev. 2.1%) and 1.9% (Prev. 2.0%) respectively, while upgrading 2020 Q4 to 2.1% (Prev. 1.8%). &nbsp;In terms of inflation forecasts, 2018 Q4 forecasts were cut to 2.0% (Prev. 2.3%) while 2019 and 2020 Q4 were maintained at 2.0%. USD/CAD initially saw a dovish reaction as and rose to levels just shy of 1.3250 as the Central Bank noted cut its growth and inflation forecasts, although this was expected. The currency pair then headed lower in a hawkish move to a low print of 1.3180 in light of the of BoC maintained a tightening bias by noting that rates will rise &ldquo;over time&rdquo; into a neutral range depending on oil market and trade developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD, AUD</strong> &ndash; Largest beneficiaries of positive trade discussions as the antipodeans take impetus from the rising oil and base metal prices which resulted in NZD/USD temporarily reclaiming 0.6800 (vs. low 0.6646) to the upside to revisit levels last seen mid-Dec 2018. Meanwhile, AUD was slightly hampered overnight by the release of disappointing Australian building approvals overnight while AMP Capital&rsquo;s Chief Economist said he sees the RBA cutting rates to 1.00% this year (currently 1.50%) due to a fall in building approvals and negative wealth effects from declining house prices dragging on economic growth. Nevertheless, the Aussie is up almost 0.7% against the buck and in close proximity to 0.7200 to the upside as the 50 and 100 DMA formed a golden cross just below 0.7190.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY </strong>&ndash; Having unwound some risk premium earlier, the Yen was largely led by dollar action in recent trade. The pair tested a high of 109.00 at one point before USD weakness sent USD/JPY through its 50 and 100 DMAs (at 108.74 and 108.43 respectively) to a low around 108.15. Meanwhile, EUR/JPY traded in a relatively tight intra-day range of 124.40-125.00.</p>\r\n",

The Bank of Canada is expected to maintain its policy interest rate at 1.75%. The meeting will feature updated economic projections, as well as a post-meeting press conference with Governor Poloz and Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins. Given that rates are expected unchanged, markets will be assessing the general bias the Bank is signalling via its new forecasts: Scotiabank expects the BOC to retain guidance that &lsquo;the policy interest rate will need to rise into a neutral range to achieve the inflation target&rsquo; while also emphasising its patient approach in getting there, with a data-dependent approach. TD Securities notes that expectations for BOC hikes have collapsed over the last two months, with the money markets implied terminal rate falling from 2.52% in November to around 1.85%. &ldquo;Moreover, the BAX curve is now downward sloping through 2020, which suggests that markets have started thinking about rate cuts next year,&rdquo; TD adds.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are in the green [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.8%] as market sentiment remains fixated around the recently concluded US-China trade talks, with China&rsquo;s foreign ministry indicating that they are taking the talks very seriously. Germany&rsquo;s DAX (+0.9%) is outperforming its peers, with auto names such as Volkswagen (+2.9%) and BMW (+1.5%) in the green on the aforementioned trade talk sentiment; Daimler (+3.7%) lead the German auto&rsquo;s with Mercedes-Benz selling 2.31mln cars in 2018 likely to make them that year&rsquo;s best-selling premium auto. Sectors are broadly in the green, with consumer discretionary the outperforming sector with luxury names such as Kering (+3.8%) and Burberry (+2.8%) up as US-China talks conclude. Other notable movers include Ted Baker (+11.3%) after announcing a 12% increase in retail sales for the 5 weeks to January 5th. Elsewhere, Taylor Wimpey (+6.9%) after Co report good trading performance, with 2018 total home completions +3%. At the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are ADP (-4.7%) after reports that the French government are considering delaying privatisation until 2020.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple (AAPL) is decreasing its current production plan for new iPhones by around 10% for the next three months following its profit warning last week. (Nikkei)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; The greenback eases further below 96.000 following a rangebound Asia-Pac session amid trade optimism with the third day of trade talks giving off somewhat of an upbeat vibe. China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry stated that the longer talks signified the country&rsquo;s seriousness, while the China Global Times Editor also took note of the positive sentiment surrounding the dialogue. As such the DXY remains closer to the bottom of a 95.925-660 range ahead of the FOMC Minutes later today (full preview available on the Research Suite).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, EUR &ndash; The Pound extended on gains before paring a bulk of the move with fears of a no-deal Brexit receding as the UK Government seems to be losing more power in Parliament. To recap recent events, the Government was defeated in a vote regarding the Finance Bill which limits the scope for tax changes in the event of a no-deal. Additionally, if Labour and Tory rebels vote down the business motion (due at around 1300GMT), then Parliament will take control of the timing of the meaningful vote debate from the Government, i.e. PM May will not have room to further delay it. Furthermore, Business Insider also reported that UK businesses will make urgent public interventions about the perils of a no-deal Brexit should MPs vote down the deal on the 15th. Subsequently, Cable retreated to near the bottom of a 1.2712-77 range with resistance seen at 1.2790 (yesterday&rsquo;s high) and support at 1.2712 (7th Jan low). Meanwhile, the EUR is marginally firmer, mostly on the back of a softer USD as an EZ upbeat unemployment rate and wider-than-expected German trade surplus did little to budge the single currency as exports fell more-than-expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK,NOK &ndash; The Scandi Crowns are mixed with the SEK marginally softer following the release of the Riksbank Minutes from the December meeting which initially saw a firmer Crown as several Board Members noted that even though the inflation forecast for the next few years has also been revised downwards slightly, the conditions are still good for inflation to remain close to the 2% inflation target. Nordea notes that the release was marginally dovish given the risks surrounding the repo path downgrade. As Such EUR/SEK pared back the initial move lower to test 10.2400 to the upside (vs. low of 10.1967) ahead of its 200 HMA at 10.2428.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD, CAD &ndash; The non-US dollars are on the front foot amid commodity price action with the Kiwi leading the gains. AUD was briefly hampered by the release of disappointing Australian building approvals overnight while AMP Capital&rsquo;s Chief Economist said he sees the RBA cutting rates to 1.00% this year (currently 1.50%) due to a fall in building approvals and negative wealth effects from declining house prices dragging on economic growth. In terms of technical, AUD/USD sees clean air to the downside until the psychological level at 0.7000, while NZD/USD is capped at its 50 DMA 0.6782 and trading just above its 20 DMA 0.6744. Meanwhile USD/CAD sits near the bottom of a 1.3223-79 range with the rise in oil supporting the Loonie ahead of the BoC interest rate decision (full preview available on the Research Suite), looking at technicals, the pair&rsquo;s 50 HMA (to the upside) sits at 1.3284 with clean air seen to the downside until 1.3200 the figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; The marked G10 underperformer as the safe-haven currency unwinds risks premium given the positivity around US-Sino trade talks with USD/JPY residing just below 109.00, having already tested the psychological level. On a technical front, past the 109.00 psychological level, 109.16 is a reported Fib level ahead of resistance at 109.73 (2nd Jan high).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED</strong> <strong>INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lacklustre start in the fixed income scope, with Core EU bonds starting the day marginally in the red and within tight ranges as positive US-China trade vibes are pressuring the sector. Bunds have spent the morning within a 29-tick range and outperform their British counterparts ahead of some key supply (EUR 4bln 2029 Bund Auction) with 10-year Gilt futures trading in an even tighter 18-tick range. On a technical standpoint 10-year Gilt traders are eying the 27th and 31st of December low of 122.80 to the downside and have seen some pressure offered by the 303 to 296 Government defeat on the Cooper amendment last night, which limits the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. In the European periphery, BTPs are also in the red as 10-year futures trade with losses a shade under 30 ticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USTs are conforming to the risk tone, with most of the action in the long end of the curve and some steepening being seen in the wake of China&rsquo;s assertion that trade talks are &ldquo;serious&rdquo;, and ahead of both an expected statement from the Far-East Asians and some key supply in the form of the USD 24bln 10-year Note Auction. Traders will also be mindful of Fed speak, with voters Evans and Rosengren speaking after alternate voter Bostic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.7%) and WTI (+1.9%) prices are higher, with WTI breaching the USD 50/bbl level to the upside, and approaching USD 51/bbl, on hopes that a resolution can be achieved between the US and China. Alongside Brent testing, and briefly crossing, USD 60.00/bbl. Prices garnered further support from yesterday&rsquo;s API crude inventories, which showed a larger than expected draw of -6.127mln vs. Exp. -2.7mln. Markets will be looking ahead to EIA data later on in the session, where expectations for weekly crude stocks are for a -3.3mln draw. UAE Energy Minister Mazrouei stated that the volatility in oil prices last year was counterproductive, and OPEC have stopped chasing an illogical or impractical price. Elsewhere, Berenberg have cut their 2019 Brent price forecast from USD 82.5/bbl to USD 65/bbl; and Morgan Stanley have updated their Brent forecast to USD 61.00/bbl vs. Prev. USD 69.00/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.3%) prices have remained subdued by the positive risk sentiment from the US-China trade progress. Elsewhere, US plans to remove sanctions on Rusal, the Russian aluminium Co, are suggested to be of limited benefit to US consumers as aluminium import tariffs mean produces would require significantly greater prices in order to incentivise shipments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UAE Energy Minister Mazrouei said oil price fluctuation and volatility last year was counterproductive and unacceptable, while he added that OPEC has stopped chasing price which is not logical or practical. Adds that an oil production curb of 1.2mln BPD is enough to balance markets (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berenberg have cut their 2019 Brent price forecast from USD 82.5/bbl to USD 65/bbl.

Additionally, if Labour and Tory rebels vote down the business motion (due at around 1300GMT), then Parliament will take control of the timing of the meaningful vote debate from the Government, i.e. PM May will not have room to further delay it. Furthermore, Business Insider also reported that UK businesses will make urgent public interventions about the perils of a no-deal Brexit should MPs vote down the deal on the 15th. Subsequently, Cable retreated to near the bottom of a 1.2712-77 range with resistance seen at 1.2790 (yesterday&rsquo;s high) and support at 1.2712 (7th Jan low). Meanwhile, the EUR is marginally firmer, mostly on the back of a softer USD as an EZ upbeat unemployment rate and wider-than-expected German trade surplus did little to budge the single currency as exports fell more-than-expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK,NOK &ndash; The Scandi Crowns are mixed with the SEK marginally softer following the release of the Riksbank Minutes from the December meeting which initially saw a firmer Crown as several Board Members noted that even though the inflation forecast for the next few years has also been revised downwards slightly, the conditions are still good for inflation to remain close to the 2% inflation target. Nordea notes that the release was marginally dovish given the risks surrounding the repo path downgrade. As Such EUR/SEK pared back the initial move lower to test 10.2400 to the upside (vs. low of 10.1967) ahead of its 200 HMA at 10.2428.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD, CAD &ndash; The non-US dollars are on the front foot amid commodity price action with the Kiwi leading the gains. AUD was briefly hampered by the release of disappointing Australian building approvals overnight while AMP Capital&rsquo;s Chief Economist said he sees the RBA cutting rates to 1.00% this year (currently 1.50%) due to a fall in building approvals and negative wealth effects from declining house prices dragging on economic growth. In terms of technical, AUD/USD sees clean air to the downside until the psychological level at 0.7000, while NZD/USD is capped at its 50 DMA 0.6782 and trading just above its 20 DMA 0.6744. Meanwhile USD/CAD sits near the bottom of a 1.3223-79 range with the rise in oil supporting the Loonie ahead of the BoC interest rate decision (full preview available on the Research Suite), looking at techincals, the pair&rsquo;s 50 HMA (to the upside) sits at 1.3284 with clean air seen to the downside until 1.3200 the figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; The marked G10 underperformer as the safe-haven currency unwinds risks premium given the positivity around US-Sino trade talks with USD/JPY residing just below 109.00, having already tested the psychological level. On a technical front, past the 109.00 psychological level, 109.16 is a reported Fib level ahead of resistance at 109.73 (2nd Jan high).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lacklustre start in the fixed income scope, with Core EU bonds starting the day marginally in the red and within tight ranges as positive US-China trade vibes are pressuring the sector. Bunds have spent the morning within a 29-tick range and outperform their British counterparts ahead of some key supply (EUR 4bln 2029 Bund Auction) with 10-year Gilt futures trading in an even tighter 18-tick range. On a technical standpoint 10-year Gilt traders are eying the 27th and 31st of December low of 122.80 to the downside and have seen some pressure offered by the 303 to 296 Government defeat on the Cooper amendment last night, which limits the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. In the European periphery, BTPs are also in the red as 10-year futures trade with losses a shade under 30 ticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USTs are conforming to the risk tone, with most of the action in the long end of the curve and some steepening being seen in the wake of China&rsquo;s assertion that trade talks are &ldquo;serious&rdquo;, and ahead of both an expected statement from the Far-East Asians and some key supply in the form of the USD 24bln 10-year Note Auction. Traders will also be mindful of Fed speak, with voters Evans and Rosengren speaking after alternate voter Bostic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.9%) and WTI (+1.9%) prices are higher, with WTI breaching the USD 50/bbl level to the upside, and approaching USD 51/bbl, on hopes that a resolution can be achieved between the US and China. Alongside Brent testing, and briefly crossing, USD 60.00/bbl. Prices garnered further support from yesterday&rsquo;s API crude inventories, which showed a larger than expected draw of -6.127mln vs. Exp. -2.7mln. Markets will be looking ahead to EIA data later on in the session, where expectations for weekly crude stocks are for a -3.3mln draw. UAE Energy Minister Mazrouei stated that the volatility in oil prices last year was counterproductive, and OPEC have stopped chasing an illogical or impractical price. Elsewhere, Berenberg have cut their 2019 Brent price forecast from USD 82.5/bbl to USD 65/bbl; and Morgan Stanley have updated their Brent forecast to USD 61.00/bbl vs. Prev. USD 69.00/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.3%) prices have remained subdued by the positive risk sentiment from the US-China trade progress. Elsewhere, US plans to remove sanctions on Rusal, the Russian aluminium Co, are suggested to be of limited benefit to US consumers as aluminium import tariffs mean produces would require significantly greater prices in order to incentivise shipments.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies were underpinned by strength in oil prices as well as the positive risk-tone but with gains in AUD capped by poor Building Approvals data, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses edged higher on widespread positive sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Building Approvals (Nov) M/M -9.1% vs. Exp. -0.5% (Prev. -1.5%).

The yield curve saw decent bear-flattening once again with shorter dated yields higher by c.6 bps and the longer end only higher by c.4bps at settlement. The complex hit new sessions lows just after the auction. The US Treasury sold USD 38bln in 3yr notes tailing by 0.4bps at a high yield of 2.559%, the lowest yield since April. Demand was relatively weak as showed by the bid-to-cover of 2.44x the lowest since April 2009. Directs&rsquo; demand was secured as they secured the largest share since December 2015, indirects were awarded the smallest portion since July, and dealers were left with a share below recent average. US T-note futures (H9) settled 9+ ticks lower at 121-24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump delivered his first-ever prime-time address in which he said there is an increasing security crisis at the US southern border and that Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration, while he also said they requested USD 5.7bln for a border wall which will be a steel barrier. Following the speech, US House Speaker Pelosi responded that President Trump is rejecting bipartisan deal to reopen government and has chosen fear over shutdown impasse, while Senate minority leader Schumer called for the government to reopen while debate over border continues.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were higher across the board as sentiment remained underpinned by trade hopes after US-China discussions were extended into a 3rd day and with progress said to have been made on issues including purchases of US goods, while US President Trump also provided encouragement as he stated that talks were going well. As such, ASX 200 (+1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) were positive as they benefitted from the trade-related optimism which had inspired a 3rd consecutive gain amongst the US majors, with notable strength also seen in Australia&rsquo;s energy names after WTI reclaimed the USD 50/bbl level to the upside. Hang Seng (+2.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.6%) were also in the green as focus centred on trade while reports suggested that US President Trump wants a China trade deal soon to boost markets. Finally, 10yr JGBs tracked the downside in T-notes as the broad gains in stocks sapped safe-haven demand, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement was also somewhat trivial with the central bank only in the market for around JPY 450bln concentrated in the belly.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) are positive as they benefit from the trade-related optimism which had inspired a 3rd consecutive gain amongst the US majors, while strength in energy names lead the upside in Australia after WTI reclaimed the USD 50/bbl level to the upside. Hang Seng (+2.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.7%) are also in the green as focus is centred on trade-related optimism and with reports also suggesting that US President Trump wants a China trade deal soon to boost markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively rangebound with the 96.00 level remaining elusive for the DXY amid choppy price action in EUR/USD and as GBP/USD nurses recent losses, with the major currencies also unfazed by US President Trump&rsquo;s first-ever prime-time Oval Office address which he used to make the case for a border wall and provided very few surprises. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies were underpinned by strength in oil prices as well as the positive risk-tone but with gains in AUD capped by poor Building Approvals data, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses edge higher on widespread positive sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower with prices tracking the downside in T-notes as the broad gains in stocks sap safe-haven demand, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement was also somewhat trivial with the central bank only in the market for around JPY 450bln concentrated in the belly.</p>\r\n",
