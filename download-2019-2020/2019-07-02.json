Furthermore, Lowe stated that Australia's terms of trade have risen again largely due to higher iron ore prices, investment in the resources sector is also expected to increase over the next few years and that they are expecting a solid upswing in the resources sector which will help the overall economy.

Carney also commented that a tight UK labour market, inflation at target, prospect of greater clarity around Brexit argues for focus on medium-term inflation dynamics, while he also noted that a global trade war and no-deal Brexit remain growing possibilities but not certainties and that in the event Brexit progresses smoothly, limited and gradual rate rises would still be needed. (Newswires)</p><p>German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen was proposed as President of the European Commission, while Belgian PM Charles Michel was named as President of the European council and IMF's Lagarde was nominated as ECB President. Furthermore, EU Council President Tusk said it is our intention to have a socialist President of the EU Parliament for the first term and a centre-right for the second, while he also commented that Von Der Leyen is to pick Timmermans and Vestager as Deputy Heads of the Commission. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB’s Lane suggested it depends what happens regarding time estimation on negative rates as the world is quite uncertain, while Lane added we have a baseline forecast which remains optimistic for Europe but recognise there are downside risks. (Newswires)</p><p>ECB policymakers reportedly see no need to rush into a rate cut in July, according to sources.

Zurbruegg added there is flexibility and room to move on core instrument, while we are convinced they can be used and will continue to do so.

(RIA)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GLOBAL NEWS</strong></p><p>US VP Pence cancelled an event in New Hampshire on Tuesday saying there is an emergency and he is being called back to the White House, although the VP's office said it was not cancelled for an emergency and rather a \"diversion\" back to Washington DC, while a White House official said the VP Pence meeting was not related to health nor related to national security.

Mester also commented that it is too early to determine whether the economy is moving to weak-growth scenario and that prefers to get more data in before considering a change to policy. (Newswires)</p><p>White House Trade Advisor Navarro said we are moving in a very good direction in the US-China trade talks. Navarro also commented that the Fed hiked rates too fast and tightened too soon, while he added that hopefully the Fed will the right thing and lower rates. (CNBC)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>L3Harris technologies (LHX) pared back Monday’s losses after being named a top pick at Jefferies. Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) moved closer to completing their merger after reaching a divesture agreement with Dish (DISH). Western Digital (WDC) and Ingersoll-Rand (IR) underperformed following downgrades at Benchmark and Jefferies respectively. Electronic Arts (EA) benefitted from a PT rise at BMO. Life insurers tumbled after JPMorgan released a negative note on the sector (AIG, PRU, BHF). Delta Air Lines (DAL) opened on the front foot on the back of strong June traffic reporting. Energy was a laggard given the sell off in crude. UBS downgraded Nordstrom (JWN) based on a negative outlook, seeing the stock and competitors Kohl’s (KSS), Macy’s (M), and Gap (GPS) follow suit. Perrigo (PRGO) rallied after it raised its FY19 EPS view. S&amp;P 500 0.3% AT 2973, NASDAQ-100 0.4% AT 7800, DOW JONES 0.3% AT 26788.</p><p>The Treasury curve bull-steepened after the Trump focused on the Eurozone as its next adversary in the trade wars. Once again, the T-Note took cues from EGBs, which have seen yields fall to fresh lows, with traders chewing the fat over the weak economic backdrop, and the dovish comments from a noted hawk (ECB's Knot) on Monday. In afternoon trade, IMF’s Lagarde emerged as the front-runner for the ECB top job, which added a bid in the fixed income space, as the candidate is viewed as less hawkish than other names that were in the frame. A bout of risk-off in the afternoon also sent the T-Note to HOD, after geopolitical tensions (around the same time, it was announced that US VP Pence had cancelled an appearance, the Russian President met his defence minister, while there were also reports that the EU Security Committee was meeting, leading to speculation that we could be on the cusp of some sort of geopolitical escalation; however, a White House official deflated the panic, stating that there was no national security angle). The T-Note remained near highs at settlement. US T-note (U9) futures settled 14+ higher at 128-04+.</p>",

That optimism continued to be faded on Tuesday, although we managed to eke out some small gains later in the session. Traders continue to cite the lack of details, or even meaningful progress, with the G20 seen as only papering over existing gulfs; there is still no timetable for talks, and with both sides intransigent in their positions, it is difficult to see how a deal can be found, especially while the US has its sights on Europe next. Havens accordingly have been in demand, and yields were lower by 2-5.5bps across the curve. The USD is essentially flat, holding above the 200dma.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>As trade war escalation against China has been put on ice after the outcome of the G20, the USTR has turned his gaze to Europe, overnight publishing a list of USD 4bln of EU goods (which are in addition to the USD 21bln goods identified in April) to target in retaliation for the EU providing subsidies to Airbus. The WTO has already judged that the EU subsidies are a violation of international trade laws, and is expected to make a decision in the summer on the amount of countermeasures that the US can impose on the bloc. After the US opening bell, White House Trade Advisor Navarro told CNBC that the US/China talks were moving in a very good direction; on the Fed, he chimed with US President Trump, arguing that Fed hiked rates too quickly, and hopefully it will ‘do the right thing’ and lower rates.</p><p><strong>* EU TOP JOBS:</strong> EU leaders have nominated IMF Chief Christine Lagarde to be the next ECB President. Some analysts have noted that the nomination of someone with a more political background may have been intentional, where the ECB has to navigate a variety of fiscal regimes in its policy decisions; some have also raised eyebrows at the prospect of having Lagarde and De Guindos (ECB VP) running the second most important central bank following careers in politics. Other top jobs chosen included Germany’s Ursula von der Leyen for Commission President, Belgium’s Charles Michel for Council President, and Spain’s Joseph Borrell for Foreign-Policy Chief. NOTE: lawmakers will still need to vote on the jobs positions.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Q9) SETTLE USD 2.84 LOWER AT USD 56.25; BRENT (U9) SETTLE USD 2.66 LOWER AT USD 62.40. </strong>The crude complex suffered from considerable selling on what analysts attribute as a “sell the fact” scenario after OPEC+ extended cuts as expected. As the data docket again highlights the fragile nature of global growth, and as the US refocuses its trade crosshairs onto Europe, the demand side of the equation is back in focus, allowing traders to book some profits. UBS said that while risks and uncertainties remain, OPEC continues to demonstrate the ability and the willingness to manage softening demand, and UBS strategists continue to believe supply-side risks that should push oil higher; indeed the bank argues that these risks are not receiving sufficient attention; although other analysts have highlighted the de-bottlenecking of the Permian Basin and more supply out of Canada as bearish supply factors to consider in H2 2019. The near-term volatility risk to energy markets is the US energy inventory reports, kicking off with the API reporting after the bell, followed by the official EIA data on Wednesday. Current inventory expectations see draws across the board, with crude at -3mln bbls, gasoline stocks at -2.2mln bbls, and distillates at -1mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB policymakers reportedly see no need to rush into a rate cut in July, according to sources. Governing Council may tweak language at upcoming meeting to hint at the potential for more stimulus ahead.</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>Cut its Cash Rate by 25bps to a fresh record low of 1.00% – the first back-to-back rate cut since 2012, after rates were left unchanged for three years. HSBC’s RBA watcher Paul Bloxham said the sharpness of the adjustment suggests bigger growth fears, despite the statement's attempts to put the cut in a positive light. The tweaks to the statement were small: analysts reason that the central bank is concerned about global growth in the context of 'trade and technology' disputes ('technology' was added); the central bank's assessment of the domestic economy was unchanged, and it reiterated its view that the labour market is strong (though this is still expected to be the key driver of RBA moves); inflation is still seen as subdued. It did, however, upgrade its guidance on the housing market (now sees tentative signs of stabilisation). RBC thinks the RBA watered down its previous explicit easing bias in favour of a more data dependant approach, and that despite less strident forward guidance, the door still remains open to further cuts ahead, with the onus now on Q3 data needing to improve in order for the central bank to hold rates steady at 1%. OIS were pricing a 67% chance of a further rate cut this year in wake of today’s rate decision. In his post-meeting press conference, Governor Lowe then signalled that the Central Bank will likely stand pat in the coming months to examine the impact of the back-to-back cuts and the proposed AUD 110bln tax cut package, which looks almost certain to pass.</p><p><strong>* BOE’S CARNEY: </strong>The BOE governor warned on Q2 growth, stating that it will be “considerably weaker”. Carney said that a global trade war and no-deal Brexit remain as growing possibilities, not certainties, and in the event that Brexit progresses smoothly, limited and gradual rate rises would still be needed (this is a repeat of current BOE guidance). Carney also said that he was noticing an increasing inconsistency between markets projections and the MPC's smooth Brexit assumptions. On the domestic economy, the Governor said the UK labour market was tight, inflation was at target, and the prospect of greater clarity around Brexit argues for focus on medium-term inflation dynamics. Carney, alluding to the Fed, said that in some jurisdictions the impact of uncertainty may warrant a near-term policy response as insurance in order to maintain the expansion.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed’s Mester (non-voter, hawk) said that cutting rates now could reinforce negative sentiment and encourage financial imbalances, and in regard to trade concerns said that the effect of already imposed tariffs are \"relatively modest\". Mester expressed she wanted to see more data before considering a change to policy (a hawkish position given the dovish tilt of most of its members).</p><p><strong>* BREXIT/UK DATA:</strong> Bookies’ underdog Jeremy Hunt pledged that he would not suspend parliament in order to push through a no deal Brexit, contrasting him with the favourite Boris Johnson. The declaration comes amid a poll which showed 59% of Conservative Party members want the new UK PM to be ready to leave the EU with no deal if negotiations with the EU fail. UK data continues to slump after the stockpiling seen ahead of the first end-March end date, with a grim construction PMI seeing all major sub-components ease, while a survey of small businesses suggested that firms were shelving capex plans amid the Brexit uncertainty.</p><p><strong>* NZ QSBO: </strong>Overnight, the latest NZIER Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion (QSBO) showed business confidence fell to its lowest level since March 2009, with a net 31% of businesses expecting a deterioration in general economic conditions over the coming months. Adding to the negative news was a further decline in firms’ own trading activity, with a net 4% of businesses reporting reduced demand in the June quarter. A net 4% of businesses also expect demand to fall in the next quarter – the weakest level since June 2009. These measures suggest a softening in annual GDP growth to below 2 percent over the second half of 2019, NZIER said.</p><p><strong>*S&amp;P 500 0.3% AT 2973, NASDAQ-100 0.4% AT 7800, DOW JONES 0.3% AT 26788. SECTORS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 0.3%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.9%, S&amp;P 500 Energy&nbsp; -1.7%, S&amp;P 500 Financials&nbsp; -0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care&nbsp; 0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials&nbsp; -0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology&nbsp; 0.3%, S&amp;P 500 Materials&nbsp; -0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 1.1%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities&nbsp; 1.3%</p><p><strong>* STOCKS:</strong> L3Harris technologies (LHX) pared back Monday’s losses after being named a top pick at Jefferies. Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) moved closer to completing their merger after reaching a divesture agreement with Dish (DISH). Western Digital (WDC) and Ingersoll-Rand (IR) underperformed following downgrades at Benchmark and Jefferies respectively. Electronic Arts (EA) benefitted from a PT rise at BMO. Life insurers tumbled after JPMorgan released a negative note on the sector (AIG, PRU, BHF). Delta Air Lines (DAL) opened on the front foot on the back of strong June traffic reporting. Energy was a laggard given the sell off in crude. UBS downgraded Nordstrom (JWN) based on a negative outlook, seeing the stock and competitors Kohl’s (KSS), Macy’s (M), and Gap (GPS) follow suit. Perrigo (PRGO) rallied after it raised its FY19 EPS view.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (U9) FUTURES SETTLE 14+ HIGHER AT 128-04+: </strong>The Treasury curve bull-steepened after the Trump focused on the Eurozone as its next adversary in the trade wars. Once again, the T-Note took cues from EGBs, which have seen yields fall to fresh lows, with traders chewing the fat over the weak economic backdrop, and the dovish comments from a noted hawk (ECB's Knot) on Monday. In afternoon trade, IMF’s Lagarde emerged as the front-runner for the ECB top job, which added a bid in the fixed income space, as the candidate is viewed as less hawkish than other names that were in the frame. A bout of risk-off in the afternoon also sent the T-Note to HOD, after geopolitical tensions (around the same time, it was announced that US VP Pence had cancelled an appearance, the Russian President met his defence minister, while there were also reports that the EU Security Committee was meeting, leading to speculation that we could be on the cusp of some sort of geopolitical escalation; however, a White House official deflated the panic, stating that there was no national security angle). The T-Note remained near highs at settlement.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> The Buck has been holding losses, though DXY has kept its head above the 200dma mark, as the dollar gives back some of Monday’s post-G20 gains. The EUR has largely been pinned to 1.13. Havens JPY, CHF and XAU advanced during afternoon risk off, with XAU retaking USD 1400, and JPY relinquished 108. CAD was up despite falling oil prices. GBP is basing around 1.26 after weak construction PMI, cautious BOE comments, and USD strength. AUD faced short covering after the RBA, though was supported by higher iron ore, though still finds 0.70 a challenge to usurp. EMFX was higher against the buck, but not BRL, which was weaker after IP fell, while the BCB chief warned of an interruption in the country’s recovery. TRY also gave back gains seen on Monday after improved geopolitical climate between Turkey and US, although Wednesday’s inflation data will now provide the next catalyst.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The buck gave back some of the post G20 gains, though DXY is keeping its head above its 200dma (around 96.65) heading into APAC trade. It is worth keeping an eye on how the USD reacts to stock rallies, with some desks arguing that unhedged inflows (into stocks) could be another factor providing support for the buck. The data slate now comes into focus (ADP/NFP) and crucially, how the Fed judges the evolution of risks after a favourable G20 outcome on trade between US/China.</p><p><strong>* HAVENS:</strong> Havens were bid amid a concoction of risk-off in afternoon trade, seeing JPY fall sub-108, EURCHF to 1.1125, XAU rise above USD 1400, while T-Notes were rallying to session highs. There was some unwind after it emerged that there was no national security threat being cited for the reason VP Pence was to meet US President Trump.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Heavy option expiries kept EUR actioned pinned to 1.13, and after the NY cut was out of the way, there was downside; however, 1.13 continues to draw action. The single currency remained supported despite major yields falling to fresh lows; desks are suggesting keeping an eye on the yield situation – while the French 10-year has gone negative, and the Bund continues to print fresh record lows in negative territory (traders attempting to front-run any potential ECB QE announcement in the months ahead?), some desks reason, the BTP could be supported by its own positive yielding 10-year, a trend worth watching given that the Bund/BTP spread can exert influence on the EUR itself; perhaps not enough to shake-off the impasse over the top EU jobs, SocGen argues, but maybe enough to defend the bottom of the recent EURUSD range.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Short covering after the RBA, a weaker USD, and rising iron ore prices support the Aussie, though it finds the air above 0.70 thin.&nbsp; It appears certain the government will be able to push through tax cuts this week, and the SMH newspaper reporting that there are no roadblocks to passage, just bumps in the road that need to smoothed-out. The Centre-Alliance has the two votes the LNP needs for 38 to make law (LNP already has 36 reliable votes in the new senate. Labor has made it likely that there will be a deal with the CA by signalling that it will wave through the plan if their amendments fail, UBS explains, “so this massively reduces the bargaining power of the CA. Depending on who you ask, the first stage of the plan (which will be implemented immediately) will have the impact of around 50bps of rate cuts.”</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Sterling slumps despite USD weakness, with BOE Governor Carney warning on Q2 data. That followed a grim construction PMI, which again highlights the challenge the UK economy is facing as the Brexit stockpiling dissipates from the data.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* NZD:</strong> The Q2 Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion was the weakest since 2009, and hints at softer growth in H2.</p><p><strong>* TRY:</strong> Was lower on Monday, despite signs that geopolitical tensions between Turkey and the US have eased; the fate of the rally may depend on inflation data released Wednesday, which is expected to ease to just above 16.0% in June; SocGen says a bond-friendly inflation print could continue to support flows in the TRY.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>FX WRAP: The Buck has been holding losses, though DXY has kept its head above the 200dma mark, as the dollar gives back some of Monday’s post-G20 gains. The EUR has largely been pinned to 1.13. Havens JPY, CHF and XAU advanced during afternoon risk off, with XAU retaking USD 1400, and JPY relinquished 108. CAD was up despite falling oil prices. GBP is basing around 1.26 after weak construction PMI, cautious BOE comments, and USD strength. AUD faced short covering after the RBA, though was supported by higher iron ore, though still finds 0.70 a challenge to usurp. EMFX was higher against the buck, but not BRL, which was weaker after IP fell, while the BCB chief warned of an interruption in the country’s recovery. TRY also gave back gains seen on Monday after improved geopolitical climate between Turkey and US, although Wednesday’s inflation data will now provide the next catalyst.</li><li>USD: The buck gave back some of the post G20 gains, though DXY is keeping its head above its 200dma (around 96.65) heading into APAC trade. It is worth keeping an eye on how the USD reacts to stock rallies, with some desks arguing that unhedged inflows (into stocks) could be another factor providing support for the buck. The data slate now comes into focus (ADP/NFP) and crucially, how the Fed judges the evolution of risks after a favourable G20 outcome on trade between US/China.</li><li>HAVENS: Havens were bid amid a concoction of risk-off in afternoon trade, seeing JPY fall sub-108, EURCHF to 1.1125, XAU rise above USD 1400, while T-Notes were rallying to session highs. There was some unwind after it emerged that there was no national security threat being cited for the reason VP Pence was to meet US President Trump.</li><li>EUR: Heavy option expiries kept EUR actioned pinned to 1.13, and after the NY cut was out of the way, there was downside; however, 1.13 continues to draw action. The single currency remained supported despite major yields falling to fresh lows; desks are suggesting keeping an eye on the yield situation – while the French 10-year has gone negative, and the Bund continues to print fresh record lows in negative territory (traders attempting to front-run any potential ECB QE announcement in the months ahead?), some desks reason), the BTP could be supported by its own positive yielding 10-year, a trend worth watching given that the Bund/BTP spread can exert influence on the EUR itself; perhaps not enough to shake-off the impasse over the top EU jobs, SocGen argues, but maybe enough to defend the bottom of the recent EURUSD range.</li><li>AUD: Short covering after the RBA, a weaker USD, and rising iron ore prices support the Aussie, though it finds the air above 0.70 thin. &nbsp;It appears certain the government will be able to push through tax cuts this week, and the SMH newspaper reporting that there are no roadblocks to passage, just bumps in the road that need to smoothed-out. The Centre-Alliance has the two votes the LNP needs for 38 to make law (LNP already has 36 reliable votes in the new senate. Labor has made it likely that there will be a deal with the CA by signalling that it will wave through the plan if their amendments fail, UBS explains, “so this massively reduces the bargaining power of the CA. Depending on who you ask, the first stage of the plan (which will be implemented immediately) will have the impact of around 50bps of rate cuts.”</li><li>GBP: Sterling slumps despite USD weakness, with BOE Governor Carney warning on Q2 data. That followed a grim construction PMI, which again highlights the challenge the UK economy is facing as the Brexit stockpiling dissipates from the data.</li><li>NZD: The Q2 Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion was the weakest since 2009, and hints at softer growth in H2. &nbsp;Overnight, the latest NZIER Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion (QSBO) showed business confidence fell to its lowest level since March 2009, with a net 31% of businesses expecting a deterioration in general economic conditions over the coming months. Adding to the negative news was a further decline in firms’ own trading activity, with a net 4% of businesses reporting reduced demand in the June quarter. A net 4% of businesses also expect demand to fall in the next quarter – the weakest level since June 2009. These measures suggest a softening in annual GDP growth to below 2 percent over the second half of 2019, NZIER said.</li><li>TRY: Was lower on Monday, despite signs that geopolitical tensions between Turkey and the US have eased; the fate of the rally may depend on inflation data released Wednesday, which is expected to ease to just above 16.0% in June; SocGen says a bond-friendly inflation print could continue to support flows in the TRY.</li></ul>",

Once again, the T-Note took cues from EGBs, which have seen yields fall to fresh lows, with traders chewing the fat over the weak economic backdrop, and the dovish comments from a noted hawk (ECB's Knot) on Monday. In afternoon trade, IMF’s Lagarde emerged as the front-runner for the ECB top job, which added a bid in the fixed income space, as the candidate is viewed as less hawkish than other names that were in the frame. A bout of risk-off in the afternoon also sent the T-Note to HOD, after geopolitical tensions (around the same time, it was announced that US VP Pence had cancelled an appearance, the Russian President met his defence minister, while there were also reports that the EU Security Committee was meeting, leading to speculation that we could be on the cusp of some sort of geopolitical escalation; however, a White House official deflated the panic, stating that there was no national security angle). The T-Note remained near highs at settlement.</p>",

As the data docket again highlights the fragile nature of global growth, and as the US refocuses its trade crosshairs onto Europe, the demand side of the equation is back in focus, allowing traders to book some profits. UBS said that while risks and uncertainties remain, OPEC continues to demonstrate the ability and the willingness to manage softening demand, and UBS strategists continue to believe supply-side risks that should push oil higher; indeed the bank argues that these risks are not receiving sufficient attention; although other analysts have highlighted the de-bottlenecking of the Permian Basin and more supply out of Canada as bearish supply factors to consider in H2 2019. The near-term volatility risk to energy markets is the US energy inventory reports, kicking off with the API reporting after the bell, followed by the official EIA data on Wednesday. Current inventory expectations see draws across the board, with crude at -3mln bbls, gasoline stocks at -2.2mln bbls, and distillates at -1mln bbls.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie has extended its relatively impressive recovery and touched psychological marks vs its US and Antipodean peers in wake of remarks from RBA’s Lowe following the latest ¼ point rate cut that suggest a time out after 50 bp cumulative easing since June (ie consecutive reductions in the OCR to a new 1% record low). Aud/Usd has drifted back from 0.7000, but remains well off the 0.6958 overnight trough and Aud/Nzd reached 1.0500 from 1.0434 at one stage as the Kiwi acknowledges the latest GDT auction results (dairy and WMP prices both firmer than previous) and pares some losses against the Greenback within a 0.6657-80 range. Note, the Nzd was also undermined by a downbeat NZIER business survey overnight showing a drop in morale and ASB predicting ½ point more RBNZ easing.</p><p><strong>JPY/SEK</strong></p><p>The next best G10s on renewed safe-haven demand and relatively hawkish policy vibes respectively, as the Yen rebounds towards 108.00 vs the Dollar and the Swedish Krona revisits recent highs through 10.5400 against the Euro ahead of Wednesday’s Riksbank policy meeting that is expected to confirm that tightening is still on the agenda, albeit perhaps pushed back further again – see the headline feed and Research Suite for our preview.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling was already on the rocks after a shocking UK construction PMI, but the 1.2600 Cable break and spike to 0.8968 in Eur/Gbp came in wake of comments from BoE’s Carney about considerably weak Q2 GDP and heightened downside economic risks due to global trade tensions. From a technical perspective, the Pound may glean some support ahead of 1.2550 via a 1.2568 Fib and 0.9000 at the 0.8992 late June high.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>Both mildly firmer vs the Buck, albeit choppy as the <strong>DXY </strong>holds a tight line between 96.879-624 and close to the 200 DMA (circa 96.650) that could be pivotal from a chart standpoint on a closing basis. Eur/Usd reversed early weakness down to around 1.1275 on the back of dismal German retail sales and pessimistic 2019 updates from the DIHK and VDMA, especially on the export front as ECB sources suggested July may be too soon for a rate cut, not long after a rise in money market expectations for a 10 bp ease next month. However, the headline pair only reached 1.1320 before waning amidst a further collapse in Eurozone/global bond yields and with 1 bn option expiries acting like a magnet into the NY cut (from 1.1295-1.1300). Meanwhile, the Loonie held up relatively well in the face of retreating oil prices (OPEC 9 month extension at prior output cut levels well and truly priced in it seems) with the aid of a slightly firmer Canadian manufacturing PMI and shrugging off typically hawkish-leaning comments from Fed’s Mester (who is a non-voter to be fair). Usd/Cad stuck within 1.3108-38 trading parameters.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>The Franc did not benefit from dwindling post-G20 risk appetite to the same degree as the Yen, and a timely reminder from SNB’s Zurbruegg about the need to maintain NIRP and a readiness to intervene given the Swiss currency’s traditional allure may have been heeded. Usd/Chf meandered between 0.9865-88 and Eur/Chf straddled 1.1150 as a result.</p>",

Airbus (-0.9%) are afflicted on these additions as they are at the center of the European aircraft subsidies. Similarly, sectors are mixed with utilities and consumer staples outperforming on the day. In terms of this mornings notable movers, Adidas (-0.4%) opened lower after a downgrade at HSBC. Separately, but still within the Dax (-0.2%), Deutsche Bank (-0.7%) have slipped into negative territory as the broader index deteriorates on the back of negative comments from the VDMA this morning; however, the Co. did open around 1.1% higher on reports that they are considering lowering their capital buffer in order to fund the Co’s overhaul. Finally, Casino (+2.0%) are higher after selling 8 stores.&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD - </strong>The Aussie has staged another strong rebound from fleeting overnight lows as bears quickly seized the opportunity to book profits in wake of the RBA’s decision to cut the OCR by another 25 bp, and other short positions were covered/squeezed on the accompanying statement suggesting no rush to ease again at the next policy meeting. Subsequently, comments from Governor Lowe appear to affirm a wait-and-see stance given back-to-back moves and Aud/Usd is inching closer to 0.7000 from 0.6958 lows, while Aud/Nzd has rebounded from sub-1.0450 towards 1.0500, with the Kiwi independently hampered by a further deterioration in NZIER business sentiment and ASB’s call for 2 more RNBZ rate reductions. Consequently, Nzd/Usd is hovering closer to the bottom of a 0.6657-80 range and eyeing the latest GDT auction next.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR - </strong>The Pound has tumbled to the base of the G10 pile on the back of June’s UK construction PMI that confounded expectations for a modest recovery and slumped even deeper into contraction at 43.1, much worse than the manufacturing miss on Monday. Moreover, components like housing and new orders were bleak, as the former fell below zero for the first time in 17 months and the latter weakened the most in over a decade. Cable is clinging to 1.2600 and Eur/Gbp is edging up towards 0.8960 as the single currency rebounds further from daily chart support vs the Dollar ahead of a Fib (circa 1.1277 and 1.1259 respectively) on ECB sourced reports downplaying July rate cut speculation. However, Eur/Usd faded around 1.1320 and could be drawn back towards decent option expiry interest between 1.1295-1.1300 (1 bn), especially after considerably weaker than forecast German retail sales data and some bleak numbers/outlooks from the likes of the DIHK and VDMA.</p><p><strong>JPY - </strong>The Yen retains a relatively firm underlying bid on safe-haven grounds as the initial post-G20 euphoria dissipates and attention shifts back to the global slowdown and geopolitical factors, like the ongoing US-Iran spat. Hence, Usd/Jpy remains capped around 108.50 and the 30 DMA (108.55), but also confined on the downside at 108.00 given a generally firm Greenback as the DXY has bounced further from recent lows and back over the 200 DMA (96.690) into a loftier 96.624-879 band.</p><p><strong>RBA lowered the Cash Rate by 25bps to a record low 1.00% as expected and stated that it cut rates to support employment growth, as well as provide greater confidence on inflation</strong>. RBA noted that the economy can sustain a lower rate of unemployment and that employment growth remains strong, while it added that the outlook for the global economy remains reasonable and that there are signs house prices are stabilizing in Sydney and Melbourne.

Airbus (-0.9%) are afflicted on these additions as they are at the centre of the European aircraft subsidies. Similarly, sectors are mixed with utilities and consumer staples outperforming on the day. In terms of this mornings notable movers, Adidas (-0.4%) opened lower after a downgrade at HSBC. Separately, but still within the Dax (-0.2%), Deutsche Bank (-0.7%) have slipped into negative territory as the broader index deteriorates on the back of negative comments from the VDMA this morning; however, the Co. did open around 1.1% higher on reports that they are considering lowering their capital buffer in order to fund the Co’s overhaul. Finally, Casino (+2.0%) are higher after selling 8 stores.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD - </strong>The Aussie has staged another strong rebound from fleeting overnight lows as bears quickly seized the opportunity to book profits in wake of the RBA’s decision to cut the OCR by another 25 bp, and other short positions were covered/squeezed on the accompanying statement suggesting no rush to ease again at the next policy meeting. Subsequently, comments from Governor Lowe appear to affirm a wait-and-see stance given back-to-back moves and Aud/Usd is inching closer to 0.7000 from 0.6958 lows, while Aud/Nzd has rebounded from sub-1.0450 towards 1.0500, with the Kiwi independently hampered by a further deterioration in NZIER business sentiment and ASB’s call for 2 more RNBZ rate reductions. Consequently, Nzd/Usd is hovering closer to the bottom of a 0.6657-80 range and eyeing the latest GDT auction next.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR - </strong>The Pound has tumbled to the base of the G10 pile on the back of June’s UK construction PMI that confounded expectations for a modest recovery and slumped even deeper into contraction at 43.1, much worse than the manufacturing miss on Monday. Moreover, components like housing and new orders were bleak, as the former fell below zero for the first time in 17 months and the latter weakened the most in over a decade. Cable is clinging to 1.2600 and Eur/Gbp is edging up towards 0.8960 as the single currency rebounds further from daily chart support vs the Dollar ahead of a Fib (circa 1.1277 and 1.1259 respectively) on ECB sourced reports downplaying July rate cut speculation. However, Eur/Usd faded around 1.1320 and could be drawn back towards decent option expiry interest between 1.1295-1.1300 (1 bn), especially after considerably weaker than forecast German retail sales data and some bleak numbers/outlooks from the likes of the DIHK and VDMA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY - </strong>The Yen retains a relatively firm underlying bid on safe-haven grounds as the initial post-G20 euphoria dissipates and attention shifts back to the global slowdown and geopolitical factors, like the ongoing US-Iran spat. Hence, Usd/Jpy remains capped around 108.50 and the 30 DMA (108.55), but also confined on the downside at 108.00 given a generally firm Greenback as the DXY has bounced further from recent lows and back over the 200 DMA (96.690) into a loftier 96.624-879 band.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Gilts have forged more gains beyond the 131.00 handle and the equivalent 10 year yield is on the brink of 75 bp in wake of the BoE rate cutting kind of UK construction PMI that bodes badly for the big services survey on Wednesday, especially given the more pronounced contraction in manufacturing seen yesterday.

        "content": "<p>RBA will announce its latest rate decision on Tuesday morning in which the central bank is expected to lower the Cash Rate Target for a 2nd consecutive meeting with ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures pricing in 70% expectations of a 25bps rate cut to a fresh record low of 1.00%, although this has dropped from as high as 89% expectations around a week before, while the implied yield curve suggests rates could decline even further to 0.75% as early as November.</p><p>This upcoming meeting follows the central bank's decision to lower rates by 25bps as expected last month in what was its first rate adjustment for nearly 3 years, which it said was to support employment growth and provide greater confidence inflation will be consistent with medium-term targets. The board also agreed it was more likely than not that further policy easing would be appropriate and RBA Governor Lowe commented shortly after that it is not unreasonable to expect a lower cash rate from here though the board has not yet made a decision and much depends on the labour market, while he also noted that economic forecast has assumed rates at 1.00% by year-end and that Australia can sustain a jobless rate of “4 point something”. These comments therefore clearly show the RBA is on a downward trajectory on rates as it is already embedded in their economic estimates and considering that the Unemployment Rate remains above the desired levels.</p><p>Furthermore, RBA Governor Lowe recently stated that the possibility of lower rates remain on the table and suggested it was practical to expect a further reduction in the Cash Rate as it is unrealistic to think one 25bps cut can alter the growth path. However, Lowe has noted it is important to recognize monetary policy is not the only option and suggested the government can potentially do more for the economy, while he also seemed to question how effective further easing would be globally and suggested that if everyone is easing, the impact on exchange rates is offset.</p><p>The data releases since the last meeting have been mixed with Q1 GDP Q/Q softer than expected at 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.2%) and GDP Y/Y inline at 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.8% (Prev. 2.3%). Elsewhere, the latest Employment Change for May has continued to top estimates at 42.3k vs. Exp. 17.5k (Prev. 28.4k) although Unemployment Rate was higher than forecast at 5.2% vs. Exp. 5.1% (Prev. 5.2%) owing to a surprise increase in the Participation Rate to 66.0% from Prev. 65.8%. This suggests not much progress has been made on jobless numbers which could keep the RBA on track for a back to back rate cut, although the data does correspond to timeframes prior to the June cut and therefore it would be prudent to adopt a wait and see approach to gauge the impact of recent policy easing.</p><p>Today’s announcement is set for 0530BST/2330CDT/1230HKT and aside from the rate decision, focus will also be on the tone of the statement for hints on whether market expectations for a total of 3 cuts this year are justified. &nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade indecisive as the momentum from the US-China trade truce begins to wane and with the region looking ahead to this week’s key risk events. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 are (Unch.) mixed with Australia underpinned by strength in mining names and amid anticipation the RBA will deliver a back-to-back rate cut in its policy announcement later, while Tokyo trade has been choppy largely reflecting the price action in its currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. are also varied with mainland China dampened after another liquidity drain by the PBoC, although Hong Kong outperforms as it plays catch up on return from the extended weekend and with gaming stocks among the biggest gainers following the strong growth in Macau gaming revenue.</p><p>In FX markets, DXY is steady around the prior day’s highs after having reigned supreme amongst its G10 counterparts in which EUR/USD slipped below its 200DMA and eventually gave up the 1.1300 handle, while a proposal by the USTR Office to increase tariffs on USD 4.0bln of EU goods due to EU aircraft subsidies briefly added to the pressure for the single currency. GBP/USD remains dejected following its retreat from 1.2700 and USD/JPY mirrors the indecisive risk tone, while antipodeans are in a holding pattern as attempts by AUD/USD to recoup recent losses are thwarted ahead of the RBA rate decision in which markets currently price in more than 89% chance for the RBA to cut rates by 25bps. However, not all are convinced with HSBC acknowledging a decent possibility for the RBA to cut rates today but sees August as more likely.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued amid the indecisive risk tone and as participants await the results of a 10yr JGB auction later.</p>",
