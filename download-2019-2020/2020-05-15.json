Gold stands out on Friday after printing fresh YTD highs after US/China jitters. Risk was knocked in pre-market trade after negative US/China headlines, though US stocks found their way back to neutral after Europe left, with the gains coinciding with remarks from US President Trump, who announced ‘Operation Warp Speed’ where he reiterated recent hopes a vaccine could be found by the end of the year, and said the government was focussing on 14 hopeful treatments, and suggested that the US government might invest in these treatments; other officials suggested that testing would become widespread. The optimism also helped bonds stay towards the low of the session, though they were going horizontal after Michigan consumer sentiment data, which surprised to the upside. With regards to other data prints: April retail sales record fall, but a moderate bounce back is seen in May, some analysts said, followed by a big June jump; Empire survey was better than expected, but it was a result of a statistical quirk; industrial production fell at record pace in April, led by a collapse in manufacturing. Others have suggested that stocks coming off of lows may have been influenced by SPX options expiry today. Additionally, many continue to buy into the notion that anti-China rhetoric is more likely a function of electioneering, and a WSJ article has downplayed the significance of the actions the Commerce Dept will take against Huawei. There are also some hope/speculation that Powell’s appearance on ABC’s 60 Minutes this Sunday (when futures will be open) will be used to perhaps dial down some of his hawkishness seen this week, when he heavily leaned back on NIRP.</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>US/CHINA: </strong>US Senate approves bill to sanction China over Uighur rights (goes to the House for a vote which had previously added export-control language to the bill last year but was not included in the Senate bill), and House Republicans are joining their colleagues in the Senate in introducing a bill that would authorize President Trump to slap sanctions on China if it refuses to cooperate on an international probe into the beginnings of the coronavirus pandemic, Fox reported. This morning, sources reported that the US was moving to prevent Huawei from acquiring semiconductors and chip-sets made using US software/technology, according to the Commerce Department, which warns that it expects Huawei license extension will be a final ‘90-day extension’; The move would be implemented via amending foreign direct product rule to ‘strategically target Huawei acquisitions’ of semi-conductors. The news resulted in downside across US and European equity futures, sending the Emini S&amp;P 500 into negative territory from modestly positive performance before hand; additionally, sparking upside across core bond counterparts. The move would impact TSMC, which supplies chips to Huawei; additionally, China mouthpiece and Global Times editor Hu Xijin retaliated swiftly, saying that if the US follows through, China would activate the “unreliable entity list”, and restrict or investigate US companies such as QCOM, CSCO and AAPL, and suspend the purchase of BA airplanes. US President Trump later reiterated the virus originated from China and it should have been stopped there, adding that China is buying a lot of US products.</p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 3 TICKS LOWER AT 139-10+</strong></p><p>T-Notes ultimately sold off on Friday with the curve slightly steeper; 2s little changed while 10s and 30s up by a couple of bps. There had initially been a bid in the complex in European trade amid risk off conditions induced by the latest US/Huawei restriction headlines. However, as equity futures began to recoup losses shortly after the US cash equity open, duration came under pressure, reversing the gains from overnight. The move marks a slight paring of the strong bull-flattening seen through the record Treasury refunding auction this week and perhaps was part due to some position unwinding as we head into the weekend. Furthermore, the new USD 20bln 20-year auction looms on the horizon (scheduled for Wednesday), with today’s modest rate back-up perhaps some concession ahead of the new coupon for the market to digest – although if this week was anything to go by, demand for duration has been solid. Note also that the Fed cut its daily USTs/TIPS purchases for the week ahead again - USD 6bln from 7bln – but the curve was little changed post the announcement, where duration had already modestly sold off ahead of the release.</p><p><strong>FED PURCHASES:</strong> The NY Fed cut its Treasuries/TIPS purchases to USD 6bln per day for next week (prev. USD 7bln). Changes by bucket: 0-2.25 year: USD 9.5bln (prev. USD 11bln); 2.25-4.5: USD 6bln (prev. USD 7bln); 4.5-7 year: USD 4.5bln (prev. USD 5bln); 7-20 year: USD 3bln (prev. USD 4bln); 20-30 year: USD 4bln (prev. USD 5bln); TIPS 1-7.5 year: USD 1.5bln (prev. USD 1.75bln); TIPS 7.5-30 year: USD 1.5bln (prev. USD 1.75bln). Note that this week it cut its purchases across all buckets. This is in contrast to last week’s schedule, which after the record size Treasury refunding announcement, left some of the longer tenors unchanged as duration came under pressure. However, after the successful auctions this week, it is likely that the Fed felt more comfortable to continue tapering across all coupon sizes again this week.</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 1.87 HIGHER AT USD 29.43; WTI (N0) SETTLED USD 1.64 HIGHER AT USD 29.52; BRENT (N0) SETTLED USD 1.37 HIGHER AT USD 32.50</strong></p><p>Further bullish enthusiasm in the energy complex saw crude futures mark their third consecutive week of gains. The supply backdrop remains little changed, although Incremental news flow continues to show evidence of OPEC+ participants moving ahead with their production cuts. OPEC+ members including Russia, Nigeria, Oman and Kazakhstan all gave updates on Friday to suggest cuts were indeed being carried out, and in Oman’s case, it announced it was seeking further cuts, to join other “overachievers” such as Saudi, UAE and Kuwait. Oil futures likely also found support in the afternoon from renewed appetite for equities, as futures managed to claw back losses after losses made on the US Huawei restrictions headlines from earlier on. Furthermore, the Baker Hughes US rig count showed oil rigs falling 34 to 258, the lowest since July 2009, and nat gas rigs down 1 to 79, which will serve as further evidence to participants that cuts are being made, and fast.</p><p><strong>WTI BACKWARDATION:</strong> Note that although the majority of open interest and volume is now in the July contract for WTI, it is worth highlighting that the front-month spread has now gone into backwardation, albeit fractionally, after moving into contango in April, as the May contract approached expiry and went negative. Citi’s analysts note that the CFTC Commitment of Traders report (to be released later today) will be of interest, where recent weeks have shown long positions in WTI continuing to build to their highest levels since September 2018. “While not anywhere close to historic overbought extremes, we do see this positioning as running ahead of the physical market, with associated risk of disappointment if the physical market is slow to rebalance.”</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>US RETAIL SALES (APR):</strong> It was a case of record monthly falls, with headline retail sales falling 16.4% M/M, deeper than the consensus -12%; the ex-autos measure was down 17.2%, again worse than the consensus; the control measure, which feeds into GDP, was -15.3% – a lot worse than the -5.0% the street was modelling. Pantheon Macroeconomics says that the forecasts were always too optimistic given that the weekly Redbook data pointed to a collapse in the control group, but the consultancy says it could have been worse. “This report was always going to be terrible, but it likely marks the floor, given the gradual reopening now underway or soon to be underway in 42 states,” and it expects a modest increase in the May retail sales data, followed by a bigger jump in June. However, Pantheon says that retail sales will remain well below their pre-Covid peak. “Our guesstimate for the control measure in Q2 is a 30-to-40% drop, but total consumption probably will fall by less than that because the very large housing and healthcare components will offset some of the hit to spending on goods and discretionary services.”</p><p><strong>UOM SURVEY (MAY):</strong> Headline sentiment unexpectedly rose to 73.7 in May from 71.8 (the Street had expected a drop to 68.0) suggesting that consumers outlook has improved slightly, albeit still at levels not seen since 2013. Oxford Economics, however, believes that the improvement is fragile and whether it can be sustained is dependent upon whether further stimulus measures are implemented, or how the economic reopening plays out in regard to fresh COVID cases. The consultancy states the level resides around a figure that is related to poor consumer spending or recessions and believe this will continue in Q2. Elsewhere in the report, conditions rose to 83 from 74.3, beating expectations of 75. Expectations missed however, falling to 67.7 from 70.1, despite expectations for a rise to 73.7. Consumers’ inflation expectations shot up to 3.0% for the 1-year metric, while the 5- to 10-year ticked up slightly to 2.6% from 2.5%, suggesting the coronavirus will have an inflationary impact; note Fed Chair Powell noted as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, the US should not see deflation.</p><p><strong>NY MANUFACTURING (MAY): </strong>The May Empire Survey rebounded to -48.5 in May, better than the consensus -60.0 against April’s -78.2. The report is still grim, and the May out turn is the worst only better than April’s record low, and is still below the GFC trough of -34.3. Pantheon Macroeconomics said it was still a horrendous report, and all the key components were still very depressed; “the jump in the headline is more of a statistical quirk than a representation of real improvement; once activity has hit rock-bottom, firms no longer report incremental deterioration so the diffusion index rises.” However, there is some good news: firms are relatively optimistic about the future, and the six-month expectations bounced to 29.1 from 7.0, new orders rose to 35.0 from 11.7; “Again, this is due more to fewer firms expecting weakness than to firms expecting growth, but it does suggest that businesses collectively believe that the crisis will be over within a few months,” PM writes, “more immediately, today’s survey points tentatively to a small uptick in the national ISM manufacturing index for May.”</p><p><strong>US INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION (APR):</strong> Industrial production fell a record 11.2% M/M in April, although was slightly better than the expected -11.5%, it is still a grim print and extends on the March decline of -4.5%. Capital Economics notes that output will rebound from May onwards as factories begin to reopen, but early signs suggest a gradual recovery. The headline decline was led by a 13.7% decline in manufacturing output after a 5.7% fall in March and was worse than the expected 13% decline. CapEco suggest this data should be the low point, given many factories are set to re-open on Monday. CapEco also highlighted that Boeing (BA) reopened its aircraft plants in the tail end of April, while auto factories remained shut, which saw auto output fall 72% M/M.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.43% at 2865, NDQ +0.64% at 9153, DJIA +0.25% at 23685</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Communication Svs +1.26%, Cons Disc +1.06%, Materials +0.96%, Cons Stpl +0.76%, Health +0.73%, Technology +0.42%, Energy -0.28%, Industrials -0.31%, Real Estate -0.44%, Financials -0.73%, Utilities -1.41%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Applied Materials (AMAT) missed on both EPS and revenue, however it noted that its supply chain is recovering, and underlying semiconductor equipment &amp; services remains robust; co believes in Q3 chip equipment sales may rise in the high single-digit range. VF Corp (VFC) missed on EPS and revenue while gross margins tumbled. VFC expects next quarter revenue to be lower by just over 50%. VFC suspended its share repurchase programme, although noted it is not currently contemplating suspending its dividend.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> The US is moving to prevent Huawei from acquiring semiconductors (SOX) and chipsets made using US software/technology. In response, China will activate the “unreliable entity list” if US further blocks key technology supply to Huawei; will restrict or investigate US companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Cisco (CSCO) and Apple (AAPL), and suspend purchases of Boeing (BA) planes. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) confirms reports it is to build a chip factory in Arizona. Nike (NKE) announced the virus is having a material impact on its business, but it has started to reopen stores in over 15 countries. However, there is continued strong demand for its online shops. FDA has warned that Abbott’s (ABT) Coronavirus test could be inaccurate, in fitting with prior reports. Sorrento Therapeutics (SRNE) has reportedly discovered an antibody that could protect against the coronavirus, according to Fox, which notes it will announce the discovery later today, adding its STI-1499 can provide “100% inhibition” of the coronavirus. Tesla (TSLA) is reportedly facing at least eight civil law suites by Chinese individuals and one possible class action lawsuit over “disputes in sales contracts”, according to Technode citing information on Shanghai city court system.</p><h2>WEEKLY FX WRAP</h2><p><strong>CBS AT ODDS OVER NIRP, US-CHINA ON COVID AND UK-EU ABOUT TRADE</strong></p><p><strong>USD: </strong>The Dollar remains on course for net gains and the DXY looks set to hold above 100.000 after printing a new mtd peak at 100.560 on Thursday. However, a record and steeper than expected decline in US retail sales just a week after payrolls plunged in excess of 20 mn has prompted all round Greenback selling to the benefit of rival currencies that were trailing in its wake, while boosting safer-havens amidst heightened/rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus. On that note, President Trump ramped up his accusatory tone over the cause and mishandling of COVID-19 with threats to cut off all ties with China, while blocking US semi-conductor and chip supplies to Huawei provoking a predictably retaliatory response. Moreover, the Chinese Global Times editor stoked up tensions by claiming that there is an increasing dislike between the 2 nations with various conflicts brewing and even the risk of military conflict rising, though neither side want a war. The CNH has weakened as a consequence despite the PBoC maintaining a relatively stable Usd/CNY fix and not being that generous with liquidity provisions or MLF rates, with perhaps some caution showing ahead of next week’s delayed NPC. Back to the Buck, another source of support if not outright momentum came via Fed chair Powell reinforcing the almost collective FOMC view that negative rates are not favoured due to inconclusive evidence about their effect, dampening market expectations, albeit with the Fed Fund Futures strip still pricing in sub-zero implied from March 2021.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR: </strong>The sell Sterling in May theme has gathered pace, but the last or latest straw came from a distinctly frosty summary from London and Brussels on the state of play after the 3rd round of Brexit trade talks, as the same key sticking points remain unresolved. Cable has subsequently fallen another 3 big figures and through 1.2132 (March 27 low) that was offering 1.2100 protection and now exposes a 50% Fib retracement at 1.2030, while Eur/Gbp has extended gains beyond 0.8900 from close to 0.8700 irrespective of the single currency’s separate travails. Indeed, Eur/Usd is clinging to 1.0800 compared to just shy of 1.0900 at one stage and got to within a whisker of triggering stops down at 1.0775 with better news on the human side of the coronavirus front negated by further evidence of the economic toll, but the overriding weight emanating from ongoing bickering over the ECB’s PSPP. Note, the Pound received brief respite from ‘better’ than anticipated GDP and output data, while comments from BoE Governor Bailey reinforced market expectations that more QE will likely be in the offing, and potentially in June, but NIRP is not currently on the agenda.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF: </strong>Fluctuations in risk sentiment and the US Treasury curve (outright yield and profile) have largely dictated Yen direction between 107.76-106.55 parameters, but mostly above post-Golden Week troughs and not obviously impacted by typically dovish commentary from BoJ Governor Kuroda or confirmation that a 2nd Japanese supplementary budget is in the pipeline. Meanwhile, the Franc has been rather mixed with underperformance vs the Dollar and further recovery gains against the Euro closer to 1.0500, ensuring that the SNB has been kept busy assuming Swiss bank sight deposits have grown again.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD: </strong>Somewhat contrasting fortunes, and certainly closes to the week for the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie, as bleak jobs data alongside portends of a lot worse to come undermined the former, while the RBNZ virtually doubled its bond buying remit to Nzd 60 bn from Nzd 33 bn in line with consensus, but arguably delivered a more dovish message on rates via forward guidance implying that a sub-zero OCR could be forthcoming. Conversely, another week of fairly solid, if not consistent retracement in crude prices, with assistance from partial OPEC+ overcompliance and a less downbeat IEA outlook vs the Cartel and EIA STEO, has buffered the latter from bouts of risk-off positioning and strength in the Greenback.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK: </strong>The aforementioned oil revival and Norges Bank Governor underlining that the depo rate has probably reached its lower bound at 0% added to the Norwegian Crown’s technical assault on 11.0000, while the Swedish Krona tagged along with help from the independent Euro weakness noted above to extend post-Riksbank gains regardless of more worrying virus victims and the Bank setting out the next leg of its asset buying program.</p><p><strong>EM: </strong>The Lira has clawed back a lot more ground from record lows and seemingly in spite of factors that could easily have derailed the Try or stopped it in its tracks, like a blowout current account deficit and weak economic data not to mention the Turkish banking regulator withdrawing bans on 3 foreign banks. However, the Real’s political woes appear endless following yet another Ministerial resignation and President Bolsonaro reportedly in cohorts to oust the new Federal Police Chief, all on top of a rising COVID-19 case and death count alongside GDP forecast downgrades and investor angst over the cost and funding of economic support measure, similar to the feeling in SA. In fact, Usd/brl only escaped falling to an all time trough even closer to 6.0000 after the BCB intervened. Meanwhile, the Mexican Peso is riding on a wave of optimism as the country re-opens from lockdown and took another 50 bp Banxico rate cut in stride.</p>",

There had initially been a bid in the complex in European trade amid risk off conditions induced by the latest US/Huawei restriction headlines. However, as equity futures began to recoup losses shortly after the US cash equity open, duration came under pressure, reversing the gains from overnight. The move marks a slight paring of the strong bull-flattening seen through the record Treasury refunding auction this week and perhaps was part due to some position unwinding as we head into the weekend. Furthermore, the new USD 20bln 20-year auction looms on the horizon (scheduled for Wednesday), with today’s modest rate back-up perhaps some concession ahead of the new coupon for the market to digest – although if this week was anything to go by, demand for duration has been solid. Note also that the Fed cut its daily USTs/TIPS purchases for the week ahead again - USD 6bln from 7bln – but the curve was little changed post the announcement, where duration had already modestly sold off ahead of the release.</p><p>FED PURCHASES: The NY Fed cut its Treasuries/TIPS purchases to USD 6bln per day for next week (prev. USD 7bln). Changes by bucket: 0-2.25 year: USD 9.5bln (prev. USD 11bln); 2.25-4.5: USD 6bln (prev. USD 7bln); 4.5-7 year: USD 4.5bln (prev. USD 5bln); 7-20 year: USD 3bln (prev. USD 4bln); 20-30 year: USD 4bln (prev. USD 5bln); TIPS 1-7.5 year: USD 1.5bln (prev. USD 1.75bln); TIPS 7.5-30 year: USD 1.5bln (prev. USD 1.75bln). Note that this week it cut its purchases across all buckets. This is in contrast to last week’s schedule, which after the record size Treasury refunding announcement, left some of the longer tenors unchanged as duration came under pressure. However, after the successful auctions this week, it is likely that the Fed felt more comfortable to continue tapering across all coupon sizes again this week.</p>",

The supply backdrop remains little changed, although Incremental news flow continues to show evidence of OPEC+ participants moving ahead with their production cuts. OPEC+ members including Russia, Nigeria, Oman and Kazakhstan all gave updates on Friday to suggest cuts were indeed being carried out, and in Oman’s case, it announced it was seeking further cuts, to join other “overachievers” such as Saudi, UAE and Kuwait. Oil futures likely also found support in the afternoon from renewed appetite for equities, as futures managed to claw back losses after losses made on the US Huawei restrictions headlines from earlier on. Furthermore, the Baker Hughes US rig count showed oil rigs falling 34 to 258, the lowest since July 2009, and nat gas rigs down 1 to 79, which will serve as further evidence to participants that cuts are being made, and fast.</p><p>WTI BACKWARDATION: Note that although the majority of open interest and volume is now in the July contract for WTI, it is worth highlighting that the front-month spread has now gone into backwardation, albeit fractionally, after moving into contango in April, as the May contract approached expiry and went negative. Citi’s analysts note that the CFTC Commitment of Traders report (to be released later today) will be of interest, where recent weeks have shown long positions in WTI continuing to build to their highest levels since September 2018. “While not anywhere close to historic overbought extremes, we do see this positioning as running ahead of the physical market, with associated risk of disappointment if the physical market is slow to rebalance.”</p>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: CBs at odds over NIRP, US-China on COVID and UK-EU about trade",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar remains on course for net gains and the <strong>DXY </strong>looks set to hold above 100.000 after printing a new mtd peak at 100.560 on Thursday. However, a record and steeper than expected decline in US retail sales just a week after payrolls plunged in excess of 20 mn has prompted all round Greenback selling to the benefit of rival currencies that were trailing in its wake, while boosting safer-havens amidst heightened/rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus. On that note, President Trump ramped up his accusatory tone over the cause and mishandling of COVID-19 with threats to cut off all ties with China, while blocking US semi-conductor and chip supplies to Huawei provoking a predictably retaliatory response. Moreover, the Chinese Global Times editor stoked up tensions by claiming that there is an increasing dislike between the 2 nations with various conflicts brewing and even the risk of military conflict rising, though neither side want a war. The <strong>CNH</strong> has weakened as a consequence despite the PBoC maintaining a relatively stable Usd/<strong>CNY</strong> fix and not being that generous with liquidity provisions or MLF rates, with perhaps some caution showing ahead of next week’s delayed NPC. Back to the Buck, another source of support if not outright momentum came via Fed chair Powell reinforcing the almost collective FOMC view that negative rates are not favoured due to inconclusive evidence about their effect, dampening market expectations, albeit with the Fed Fund Futures strip still pricing in sub-zero implied from March 2021.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>The sell Sterling in May theme has gathered pace, but the last or latest straw came from a distinctly frosty summary from London and Brussels on the state of play after the 3rd round of Brexit trade talks, as the same key sticking points remain unresolved. Cable has subsequently fallen another 3 big figures and through 1.2132 (March 27 low) that was offering 1.2100 protection and now exposes a 50% Fib retracement at 1.2030, while Eur/Gbp has extended gains beyond 0.8900 from close to 0.8700 irrespective of the single currency’s separate travails. Indeed, Eur/Usd is clinging to 1.0800 compared to just shy of 1.0900 at one stage and got to within a whisker of triggering stops down at 1.0775 with better news on the human side of the coronavirus front negated by further evidence of the economic toll, but the overriding weight emanating from ongoing bickering over the ECB’s PSPP. Note, the Pound received brief respite from ‘better’ than anticipated GDP and output data, while comments from BoE Governor Bailey reinforced market expectations that more QE will likely be in the offing, and potentially in June, but NIRP is not currently on the agenda.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Fluctuations in risk sentiment and the US Treasury curve (outright yield and profile) have largely dictated Yen direction between 107.76-106.55 parameters, but mostly above post-Golden Week troughs and not obviously impacted by typically dovish commentary from BoJ Governor Kuroda or confirmation that a 2nd Japanese supplementary budget is in the pipeline. Meanwhile, the Franc has been rather mixed with underperformance vs the Dollar and further recovery gains against the Euro closer to 1.0500, ensuring that the SNB has been kept busy assuming Swiss bank sight deposits have grown again.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>Somewhat contrasting fortunes, and certainly closes to the week for the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie, as bleak jobs data alongside portends of a lot worse to come undermined the former, while the RBNZ virtually doubled its bond buying remit to Nzd 60 bn from Nzd 33 bn in line with consensus, but arguably delivered a more dovish message on rates via forward guidance implying that a sub-zero OCR could be forthcoming. Conversely, another week of fairly solid, if not consistent retracement in crude prices, with assistance from partial OPEC+ overcompliance and a less downbeat IEA outlook vs the Cartel and EIA STEO, has buffered the latter from bouts of risk-off positioning and strength in the Greenback.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The aforementioned oil revival and Norges Bank Governor underlining that the depo rate has probably reached its lower bound at 0% added to the Norwegian Crown’s technical assault on 11.0000, while the Swedish Krona tagged along with help from the independent Euro weakness noted above to extend post-Riksbank gains regardless of more worrying virus victims and the Bank setting out the next leg of its asset buying program.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira has clawed back a lot more ground from record lows and seemingly in spite of factors that could easily have derailed the Try or stopped it in its tracks, like a blowout current account deficit and weak economic data not to mention the Turkish banking regulator withdrawing bans on 3 foreign banks. However, the Real’s political woes appear endless following yet another Ministerial resignation and President Bolsonaro reportedly in cohorts to oust the new Federal Police Chief, all on top of a rising COVID-19 case and death count alongside GDP forecast downgrades and investor angst over the cost and funding of economic support measure, similar to the feeling in SA. In fact, Usd/brl only escaped falling to an all time trough even closer to 6.0000 after the BCB intervened. Meanwhile, the Mexican Peso is riding on a wave of optimism as the country re-opens from lockdown and took another 50 bp Banxico rate cut in stride.</p>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: CBs at odds over NIRP, US-China on COVID and UK-EU about trade",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar remains on course for net gains and the <strong>DXY </strong>looks set to hold above 100.000 after printing a new mtd peak at 100.560 on Thursday. However, a record and steeper than expected decline in US retail sales just a week after payrolls plunged in excess of 20 mn has prompted all round Greenback selling to the benefit of rival currencies that were trailing in its wake, while boosting safer-havens amidst heightened/rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus. On that note, President Trump ramped up his accusatory tone over the cause and mishandling of COVID-19 with threats to cut off all ties with China, while blocking US semi-conductor and chip supplies to Huawei provoking a predictably retaliatory response. Moreover, the Chinese Global Times editor stoked up tensions by claiming that there is an increasing dislike between the 2 nations with various conflicts brewing and even the risk of military conflict rising, though neither side want a war. The <strong>CNH</strong> has weakened as a consequence despite the PBoC maintaining a relatively stable Usd/<strong>CNY</strong> fix and not being that generous with liquidity provisions or MLF rates, with perhaps some caution showing ahead of next week’s delayed NPC. Back to the Buck, another source of support if not outright momentum came via Fed chair Powell reinforcing the almost collective FOMC view that negative rates are not favoured due to inconclusive evidence about their effect, dampening market expectations, albeit with the Fed Fund Futures strip still pricing in sub-zero implied from March 2021.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>The sell Sterling in May theme has gathered pace, but the last or latest straw came from a distinctly frosty summary from London and Brussels on the state of play after the 3rd round of Brexit trade talks, as the same key sticking points remain unresolved. Cable has subsequently fallen another 3 big figures and through 1.2132 (March 27 low) that was offering 1.2100 protection and now exposes a 50% Fib retracement at 1.2030, while Eur/Gbp has extended gains beyond 0.8900 from close to 0.8700 irrespective of the single currency’s separate travails. Indeed, Eur/Usd is clinging to 1.0800 compared to just shy of 1.0900 at one stage and got to within a whisker of triggering stops down at 1.0775 with better news on the human side of the coronavirus front negated by further evidence of the economic toll, but the overriding weight emanating from ongoing bickering over the ECB’s PSPP. Note, the Pound received brief respite from ‘better’ than anticipated GDP and output data, while comments from BoE Governor Bailey reinforced market expectations that more QE will likely be in the offing, and potentially in June, but NIRP is not currently on the agenda.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Fluctuations in risk sentiment and the US Treasury curve (outright yield and profile) have largely dictated Yen direction between 107.76-106.55 parameters, but mostly above post-Golden Week troughs and not obviously impacted by typically dovish commentary from BoJ Governor Kuroda or confirmation that a 2nd Japanese supplementary budget is in the pipeline. Meanwhile, the Franc has been rather mixed with underperformance vs the Dollar and further recovery gains against the Euro closer to 1.0500, ensuring that the SNB has been kept busy assuming Swiss bank sight deposits have grown again.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>Somewhat contrasting fortunes, and certainly closes to the week for the Aussie, Kiwi and Loonie, as bleak jobs data alongside portends of a lot worse to come undermined the former, while the RBNZ virtually doubled its bond buying remit to Nzd 60 bn from Nzd 33 bn in line with consensus, but arguably delivered a more dovish message on rates via forward guidance implying that a sub-zero OCR could be forthcoming. Conversely, another week of fairly solid, if not consistent retracement in crude prices, with assistance from partial OPEC+ overcompliance and a less downbeat IEA outlook vs the Cartel and EIA STEO, has buffered the latter from bouts of risk-off positioning and strength in the Greenback.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The aforementioned oil revival and Norges Bank Governor underlining that the depo rate has probably reached its lower bound at 0% added to the Norwegian Crown’s technical assault on 11.0000, while the Swedish Krona tagged along with help from the independent Euro weakness noted above to extend post-Riksbank gains regardless of more worrying virus victims and the Bank setting out the next leg of its asset buying program.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira has clawed back a lot more ground from record lows and seemingly in spite of factors that could easily have derailed the Try or stopped it in its tracks, like a blowout current account deficit and weak economic data not to mention the Turkish banking regulator withdrawing bans on 3 foreign banks. However, the Real’s political woes appear endless following yet another Ministerial resignation and President Bolsonaro reportedly in cohorts to oust the new Federal Police Chief, all on top of a rising COVID-19 case and death count alongside GDP forecast downgrades and investor angst over the cost and funding of economic support measure, similar to the feeling in SA. In fact, Usd/brl only escaped falling to an all time trough even closer to 6.0000 after the BCB intervened. Meanwhile, the Mexican Peso is riding on a wave of optimism as the country re-opens from lockdown and took another 50 bp Banxico rate cut in stride.</p>",

The losses extended in the pre-market after China Global Times Editor tweeted that the nation would retaliate by activating its \"unreliable entity list\" to restrict large US companies. The Treasury curve continues to bull-flatten (albeit the narrowing is moderate compared to recent sessions). The Dollar Index is lower, but remains above 100; high-beta/activity FX is trading lower, and EMs are mostly lower/flat. Crude is firmer, supported by this week’s inventory draws, though commodity FX is not seeing the benefits on Friday morning. On the data front, analysts said China activity data released overnight shows only a slow recovery, and Germany Q1 GDP data out in the pre-market confirms that Europe’s engine is in recession. US retail sales were grim (-16.4%, exp. -12%; <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-us-april-retail-sales-record-fall-but-a-moderate-bounce-back-is-seen-in-may-pantheon-says-followed-by-a-big-june-jump-15-05-2020\">see here for analysis</a>), as was NY Fed Manufacturing, although better than expected (-48.5, exp. -63.5; <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-us-empire-survey-better-than-expected-but-it-was-a-result-of-a-statistical-quirk-pantheon-says-15-05-2020\">see here for analysis</a>).&nbsp; Industrial production -11.2%, Manufacturing output -13.7%. On the radar we have Michigan sentiment, rig count data from Baker Hughes, and NY Fed’s weekly treasury schedule announcement.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Almost all sectors are in the red, with the exception of Consumer Staples and Energy which are only modestly firmer with the latter benefitting from firmer crude prices. Defensives, Utilities &amp; Real Estate, are the laggards today among technology which is weighed on by the back and forth US/China comments as mentioned above.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Applied Materials (AMAT) missed on both EPS and revenue, however it noted that its supply chain is recovering, and underlying semiconductor equipment &amp; services remains robust; co believes in Q3 chip equipment sales may rise in the high single-digit range. VF Corp (VFC) missed on EPS and revenue while gross margins tumbled. VFC expects next quarter revenue to be lower by just over 50%. VFC suspended its share repurchase programme, although noted it is not currently contemplating suspending its dividend.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>The US is moving to prevent Huawei from acquiring semiconductors (SOX) and chipsets made using US software/technology. In response, China will activate the “unreliable entity list” if US further blocks key technology supply to Huawei; will restrict or investigate US companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Cisco (CSCO) and Apple (AAPL), and suspend purchases of Boeing (BA) planes. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) confirms reports it is to build a chip factory in Arizona. Nike (NKE) announced the virus is having a material impact on its business, but it has started to reopen stores in over 15 countries. However, there is continued strong demand for its online shops. FDA has warned that Abbott’s (ABT) Coronavirus test could be inaccurate, in fitting with prior reports.Sorrento Therapeutics (SRNE) has reportedly discovered an antibody that could protect against the coronavirus, according to Fox, which notes it will announce the discovery later today, adding its STI-1499 can provide “100% inhibition” of the coronavirus.</p><p><strong>US/CHINA:</strong> US Senate approves bill to sanction China over Uighur rights (goes to the House for a vote which had previously added export-control language to the bill last year but was not included in the Senate bill), and House Republicans are joining their colleagues in the Senate in introducing a bill that would authorize President Trump to slap sanctions on China if it refuses to cooperate on an international probe into the beginnings of the coronavirus pandemic, Fox reported. This morning, sources reported that the US was moving to prevent Huawei from acquiring semiconductors and chip-sets made using US software/technology, according to the Commerce Department, which warns that it expects Huawei license extension will be a final '90-day extension'; The move would be implemented via amending foreign direct product rule to 'strategically target Huawei acquisitions' of semi-conductors. The news resulted in downside across US and European equity futures, sending the Emini S&amp;P 500 into negative territory from modestly positive performance before hand; additionally, sparking upside across core bond counterparts. The move would impact TSMC, which supplies chips to Huawei; additionally, China mouthpiece and Global Times editor Hu Xijin retaliated swiftly, saying that if the US follows through, China would activate the “unreliable entity list”, and restrict or investigate US companies such as QCOM, CSCO and AAPL, and suspend the purchase of BA airplanes. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>MEGA CAPS COULD YET HELP S&amp;P RALLY: </strong>US equities are heading into the last part of the week with losses of 1.0-2.5% for the major equity futures. The ES is currently perched in the middle of the week’s range, around 3% off the weekly high, and around 3% off the weekly low. Heading into the week, the broad narrative was that the Fed had backstopped the downside, while expectations of upside was capped by a slow recovery and election risk; this week’s has prompted the debate over whether we can reach the March lows, following the flaring up of US/China tensions, Fed chair Powell’s resistance to negative rates, and some concerns about COVID cases rising as economies reopen. Some have even raised eyebrows at the speed of the recovery, given that action has struggled around the 61.8% fib retracement of the Q1 fall. Capital Economics says that, while some further near-term downside might be possible, it doubts we will fall down to the March lows (2,174 for the Emini S&amp;P 500). “Concerns around whether the virus can be brought under control, and the damage done to economies, may continue to weigh on US equities in the near term,” CapEco writes, “but we think that the latest wobble is more likely to be a stumble during a broader recovery, rather than mark the end of a bear-market rally.” (1) activity is likely to have troughed in Q2 as lockdowns are lifted, and CapEco notes that for the 14 US recessions since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 reached its trough before the recession ended in all but one of these episodes. “On that basis, if we’re right to think that the US will exit recession in the second half of this year, as the gradual re-opening of the economy progresses, the low in the S&amp;P 500 on 23rd March could have marked the bottom.” (2) CapEco argues that, rather than a bet on a rapid economic recovery, much of the rebound in the S&amp;P 500 since March seems to reflect a view that a few large companies will entrench their already dominant positions: “Stripping out the five largest constituents of the S&amp;P 500, which make up ~20% of the index, the recovery in the rest is not as impressive,” it writes, noting that mid- and small-cap equities have recovered by even less. “The fortunes of the S&amp;P 500 overall depend heavily on whether the rally in ‘mega-cap’ stocks continues, slows, or goes into reverse; but we think that the rest of the S&amp;P 500, and mid- and small- cap US equities, will rise further once economies show clear signs of having turned a corner.”</p>",

        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>WHAT’S GOING ON: </strong>Equity futures are negative after news that the US Commerce Department is stepping up actions against China’s Huawei, sending Emini S&amp;P about 50bps into negative territory (NOTE: Emini S&amp;P options expiry today); the losses were extended after China Global Times Editor tweeted that China would retaliate by activating its \"unreliable entity list\" to restrict large US companies. The Treasury curve continues to bull-flatten (albeit the narrowing is moderate compared to recent sessions). The dollar index is flat, in the middle of its daily range; high-beta/activity FX is trading lower, and EMs are also generally lower. Crude is slightly higher, supported by this week’s inventory draws, though commodity FX is not seeing the benefits on Friday morning. On the data front, analysts said China activity data released overnight shows only a slow recovery, and Germany Q1 GDP data out in the pre-market confirms that Europe’s engine is in recession. On the radar we have US retail sales, industrial and manufacturing production, Michigan sentiment, JOLTs, and rig count data from Baker Hughes.</p><p><strong>US/CHINA: </strong>US Senate approves bill to sanction China over Uighur rights (goes to the House for a vote which had previously added export-control language to the bill last year but was not included in the Senate bill), and House Republicans are joining their colleagues in the Senate in introducing a bill that would authorize President Trump to slap sanctions on China if it refuses to cooperate on an international probe into the beginnings of the coronavirus pandemic, Fox reported. This morning, sources reported that the US was moving to prevent Huawei from acquiring semiconductors and chip-sets made using US software/technology, according to the Commerce Department, which warns that it expects Huawei license extension will be a final '90-day extension'; The move would be implemented via amending foreign direct product rule to 'strategically target Huawei acquisitions' of semi-conductors. The news resulted in downside across US and European equity futures, sending the Emini S&amp;P 500 into negative territory from modestly positive performance before hand; additionally, sparking upside across core bond counterparts. The move would impact TSMC, which supplies chips to Huawei; additionally, China mouthpiece and Global Times editor Hu Xijin retaliated swiftly, saying that if the US follows through, China would activate the “unreliable entity list”, and restrict or investigate US companies such as QCOM, CSCO and AAPL, and suspend the purchase of BA airplanes.</p><p><strong>MEGA CAPS COULD YET HELP S&amp;P RALLY: </strong>US equities are heading into the last part of the week with losses of 1.0-2.5% for the major equity futures. The ES is currently perched in the middle of the week’s range, around 3% off the weekly high, and around 3% off the weekly low. Heading into the week, the broad narrative was that the Fed had backstopped the downside, while expectations of upside was capped by a slow recovery and election risk; this week’s has prompted the debate over whether we can reach the March lows, following the flaring up of US/China tensions, Fed chair Powell’s resistance to negative rates, and some concerns about COVID cases rising as economies reopen. Some have even raised eyebrows at the speed of the recovery, given that action has struggled around the 61.8% fib retracement of the Q1 fall. Capital Economics says that, while some further near-term downside might be possible, it doubts we will fall down to the March lows (2,174 for the Emini S&amp;P 500). “Concerns around whether the virus can be brought under control, and the damage done to economies, may continue to weigh on US equities in the near term,” CapEco writes, “but we think that the latest wobble is more likely to be a stumble during a broader recovery, rather than mark the end of a bear-market rally.” (1) activity is likely to have troughed in Q2 as lockdowns are lifted, and CapEco notes that for the 14 US recessions since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 reached its trough before the recession ended in all but one of these episodes. “On that basis, if we’re right to think that the US will exit recession in the second half of this year, as the gradual re-opening of the economy progresses, the low in the S&amp;P 500 on 23rd March could have marked the bottom.” (2) CapEco argues that, rather than a bet on a rapid economic recovery, much of the rebound in the S&amp;P 500 since March seems to reflect a view that a few large companies will entrench their already dominant positions: “Stripping out the five largest constituents of the S&amp;P 500, which make up ~20% of the index, the recovery in the rest is not as impressive,” it writes, noting that mid- and small-cap equities have recovered by even less. “The fortunes of the S&amp;P 500 overall depend heavily on whether the rally in ‘mega-cap’ stocks continues, slows, or goes into reverse; but we think that the rest of the S&amp;P 500, and mid- and small- cap US equities, will rise further once economies show clear signs of having turned a corner.”</p><p><strong>RETAIL SALES AHEAD:</strong> Retail sales are seen falling by 10.2% M/M in April; the range of forecasts is wide, between -20% and -4.0%, and if we hit the lower end of that range, we will be in ‘largest one month decline ever’ territory. The ex-autos measures is seen -8.6% (again, wide range: -17.0% to -3.2%). Some states initiated shutdown measures in the latter part of March, while others followed in April. Accordingly, both auto and gasoline spending should push sales sharply lower, Credit Suisse believes, with gasoline prices down around 25% M/M seasonally adjusted, amid a consumer demand collapse. Vehicle sales are also seen dragging, after falling to a rate of 8.6mln SAAR in April, down from 11.3mln. CS warns that there is likely to be drastic divergence in the various spending categories; restaurants, malls, clothing, and home improvement store sales should fall off significantly as shops shut down, the bank says, but grocery, health care, and online shopping likely rose in the month as stockpiling continued and more purchases shifted online. Regarding the control group measure, which feeds into GDP, CS looks for a decline of 3.7% after the prior month's +2.0%. Looking ahead, the bank argues that as states reopen in May, it expects April to mark the trough in consumption. \"However, the recovery in spending will only be gradual as reopening occurs in phases and consumption behaviour shifts.\" Overall CS expects consumption to fall by 23% Q/Q annualised in Q2, the worst quarter since WWII.</p><p><strong>GOLD EQUITY CYCLE:</strong> Gold has been punchy this week, and now the Q2 high of USD 1,746 is back in focus. “Gold equities have proven to be volatile investments where the stocks generally price in changes in market sentiment (risk-on-risk-off) ahead of analyst estimate changes and changes in gold and equity views,” UBS says. The bank’s analysis shows the median boom phase return of the UBS gold miner's index is 163% while that of the gold price is 66% - the current cycle has thus far yielded returns of 172% and 42% respectively, and it suggests that there may be some upside remaining in the gold price from that perspective; the bank sees potential rallies to USD 1,800 in the near-term. UBS analysis also shows that current cycle, which is 21 months old, compares to a median total cycle length of 45 months which can mean we are approaching the apex. The median length of the boom phase of the cycle is 22 months, it writes, with the remaining 23 months constituting the bust phase (where gold equities decline by &gt;40%), and it also finds that in general gold equities tend to peak ahead of the gold price when – equities peak 36% over the way through the cycle while gold peak mid-way through. Accordingly, the bank still sees pockets of value with some gold miners; and its top five are: Barrick, Gold Fields, Polyus, Polymetal, and Saracen.</p>",

(U/C) </strong>were<strong> </strong>choppy due to the mixed data releases and following the PBoC’s tepid actions whereby it announced a CNY 100bln Medium-term Lending Facility which was half of what had expired yesterday and kept the rate unchanged at 2.95%, but noted that the second phase of its previously announced RRR cuts took effect from today and would release about CNY 200bln of long-term liquidity.

However, <strong>reports that the US is moving to block Huawe</strong>i from acquiring US integrated semiconductors and chip sets <strong>pressured sentiment and stock markets</strong>. Spain’s IBEX (-0.5%) is the region’s underperformer amid steep losses in its Financial names – broad-based upside is seen across the rest of the region. Sectors are all in the green with Energy relinquishing its top spot to later underperform; sector breakdown sees Basic Resources and Autos outperforming while Banks reside alongside Construction &amp; Materials. In terms of individual movers, BT (+4.9%) rose as much as 10% at the open amid source reports via the FT that the Co. is in talks to sell a \"multibillion-pound stake\" in its GBP 20bln Openreach unit to infrastructure investors, adding that talks were reportedly held with Macquarie. However, an internal memo pushed back against this speculator, thus shares trimmed some gains. Elsewhere, Richemont (-2.6%) shares lag the market amid a slew of downbeat YY metrics in which FY20 adj net, operating profit, diluted EPS and net cash position eroded. William Hill (+6.6%) trades higher after announcing that cash burn reduced to around GBP 15mln per month and liquidity in excess of EUR 700mln. The group also said revolving credit facility covenants waived for 2020 and reset for 2021.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>JPY/DXY - </strong>Notwithstanding an element of Friday fatigue and cautious trade ahead of potentially market-moving US data in the form of retail sales and ip ahead of preliminary Michigan sentiment, the Yen and Dollar look tightly bound above 107.00 amidst a recovery in broad sentiment and particularly large expiries rolling off at the NY cut, with over 2 bn at the figure and 107.50 keeping Usd/Jpy contained. Moreover, the remaining Greenback/G10 pairings are also sticking to relatively tight lines awaiting more decisive direction following choppy and erratic price action so far this week, as the DXY consolidates just off yesterday’s new mtd high (100.56) within a 100.390-160 range.</p><p><strong>EUR/AUD/CAD/CHF - </strong>As noted above, not much deviation or adverse reaction to Eurozone GDP data that was remarkably close to consensus and largely ignored on the basis that the current quarter will be more telling in terms of gauging COVID-19 contagion. Indeed, after Germany’s 2.2% q/q contraction the Economy Ministry noted no improvement in April vs tangible evidence of recovery from this month, but still predicts a 10% fall overall in Q2. However, the single currency is clinging to 1.0800 vs the Buck following Thursday’s foray below the round number that almost tripped stops at 1.0775. Meanwhile, the Aussie, Loonie and Franc are all meandering between narrow bands against their US counterpart around 0.6460, 1.4045 and 0.9725 respectively, with the former not gleaning much from mixed Chinese data overnight, but the Cad cushioned by firm crude prices and the Chf still wary about ongoing official intervention given further retracement from recent peaks against the Eur to fresh multi-year highs less than 10 pips from 1.0500.</p><p><strong>GBP/SEK/NOK/NZD - </strong>Cable remains on the cusp of steeper declines unless 1.2200 continues to provide psychological support or the Pound survives another test of 1.2166 from a technical perspective awaiting updates on this week’s last session of UK-EU trade negotiations. Conversely, the Swedish and Norwegian Kronas appear to have run in to some resistance in Euro cross terms ahead of 10.5800 and 10.9500 respectively, but both retain upward thrust towards the upper bounds of 10.7100-10.5600 and 11.1855-10.9250 extremes on the week so far, in contrast to the Kiwi that is languishing under 0.6000 vs its US peer and not far from 1.0800 against the Aussie in wake of clear NIRP inferences from the RBNZ.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Most regional currencies are going through the motions, but the Lira has now touched 6.9000 as its resurgence gathers more steam and the Mexican Peso is taking the Banxico’s latest 50 bp ease in stride. However, the Czech Koruna has been hit by comments from CNB Governor Runok playing down the prospect of implementing an FX regime and resorting to negative rates following mixed Q1 GDP reads vs forecasts, albeit q/q and y/y contractions vs better than expected Hungarian, Polish and Romanian prints.</p><p><strong>Notable FX Expiries, NY Cut</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USD/JPY: 106.00 (940M), <strong>106.25 (1.5BLN), 106..50 (1.25BLN), 107.00 (2.44BLN), 107.50 (2.2BLN)</strong>, 107.75 (310M), <strong>108.00 (2.6BLN)</strong></p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds, Gilts </strong>and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> have not quite matched yesterday’s peaks, but the 10 year benchmarks have regained poise despite more talks about debt brakes being lifted and gentle denials. Indeed, the former has now edged above 174.00, while its UK peer remains above 138.00 and T-note afloat between 139-09+ to 139-16+ overnight session parameters. Although weak Eurozone data and projections of worse to come have not really prompted much obvious upside, bonds haven’t been too unsettled by a decent rebound in stocks as the asset classes decouple and head into pre-weekend US data in short-covering/consolidation mode.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI </strong>and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month continue to grind higher amid rosier demand and storage prospects alongside a more bullish supply backdrop. Furthermore, the IEA’s more optimistic comments regarding the demand slump not being as steep as feared underpin the complex. That being said, desks note that despite the above, the market remains in surplus, but the magnitude of inventory builds has declined vs. April levels – resulting in strengthening time spreads and narrower contango – suggesting that market improving fundamentals. “we still believe that in the near-term, the upside is limited given that we are still in a surplus environment and as there is plenty of inventory for the market to digest.” ING writes. WTI June hovers around USD 28.00/bbl having printed a base at USD 27.24/bbl, whilst Brent July dipped just below 32/bbl in a USD 30.84-32.50/bbl intraday band. For reference, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo will be appearing on Bloomberg TV at 1500BST. Meanwhile, <strong>spot gold</strong> tracks Dollar action and gains further ground above 1700/oz – eyeing potential resistance at USD 1738.50/oz (April 23rd high), having traded in a USD 1729-38/oz band thus far. <strong>Copper prices</strong> move higher in tandem with the broader risk sentiment, but prices remain contained within recent ranges.</p><p>UAE’s ADNOC CEO sees signs oil markets have tightened recently and will rebalance over time.

However, reports that the US is moving to block Huawei from acquiring US integrated semiconductors and chip sets pressured sentiment and stock markets. Spain’s IBEX (-0.5%) is the region’s underperformer amid steep losses in its Financial names – broad-based upside is seen across the rest of the region. Sectors are all in the green with Energy relinquishing its top spot to later underperform; sector breakdown sees Basic Resources and Autos outperforming while Banks reside alongside Construction &amp; Materials. In terms of individual movers, BT (+4.9%) rose as much as 10% at the open amid source reports via the FT that the Co. is in talks to sell a \"multibillion-pound stake\" in its GBP 20bln Openreach unit to infrastructure investors, adding that talks were reportedly held with Macquarie. However, an internal memo pushed back against this speculator, thus shares trimmed some gains. Elsewhere, Richemont (-2.6%) shares lag the market amid a slew of downbeat YY metrics in which FY20 adj net, operating profit, diluted EPS and net cash position eroded. William Hill (+6.6%) trades higher after announcing that cash burn reduced to around GBP 15mln per month and liquidity in excess of EUR 700mln. The group also said revolving credit facility covenants waived for 2020 and reset for 2021.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>JPY/DXY </strong>- Notwithstanding an element of Friday fatigue and cautious trade ahead of potentially market-moving US data in the form of retail sales and ip ahead of preliminary Michigan sentiment, the Yen and Dollar look tightly bound above 107.00 amidst a recovery in broad sentiment and particularly large expiries rolling off at the NY cut, with over 2 bn at the figure and 107.50 keeping Usd/Jpy contained. Moreover, the remaining Greenback/G10 pairings are also sticking to relatively tight lines awaiting more decisive direction following choppy and erratic price action so far this week, as the DXY consolidates just off yesterday’s new mtd high (100.56) within a 100.390-160 range.</p><p><strong>EUR/AUD/CAD/CHF</strong> - As noted above, not much deviation or adverse reaction to Eurozone GDP data that was remarkably close to consensus and largely ignored on the basis that the current quarter will be more telling in terms of gauging COVID-19 contagion. Indeed, after Germany’s 2.2% q/q contraction the Economy Ministry noted no improvement in April vs tangible evidence of recovery from this month, but still predicts a 10% fall overall in Q2. However, the single currency is clinging to 1.0800 vs the Buck following Thursday’s foray below the round number that almost tripped stops at 1.0775. Meanwhile, the Aussie, Loonie and Franc are all meandering between narrow bands against their US counterpart around 0.6460, 1.4045 and 0.9725 respectively, with the former not gleaning much from mixed Chinese data overnight, but the Cad cushioned by firm crude prices and the Chf still wary about ongoing official intervention given further retracement from recent peaks against the Eur to fresh multi-year highs less than 10 pips from 1.0500.</p><p><strong>GBP/SEK/NOK/NZD </strong>- Cable remains on the cusp of steeper declines unless 1.2200 continues to provide psychological support or the Pound survives another test of 1.2166 from a technical perspective awaiting updates on this week’s last session of UK-EU trade negotiations. Conversely, the Swedish and Norwegian Kronas appear to have run in to some resistance in Euro cross terms ahead of 10.5800 and 10.9500 respectively, but both retain upward thrust towards the upper bounds of 10.7100-10.5600 and 11.1855-10.9250 extremes on the week so far, in contrast to the Kiwi that is languishing under 0.6000 vs its US peer and not far from 1.0800 against the Aussie in wake of clear NIRP inferences from the RBNZ.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- Most regional currencies are going through the motions, but the Lira has now touched 6.9000 as its resurgence gathers more steam and the Mexican Peso is taking the Banxico’s latest 50 bp ease in stride. However, the Czech Koruna has been hit by comments from CNB Governor Runok playing down the prospect of implementing an FX regime and resorting to negative rates following mixed Q1 GDP reads vs forecasts, albeit q/q and y/y contractions vs better than expected Hungarian, Polish and Romanian prints.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong>, <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> have not quite matched yesterday’s peaks, but the 10 year benchmarks have regained poise despite more talks about debt brakes being lifted and gentle denials. Indeed, the former has now edged above 174.00, while its UK peer remains above 138.00 and T-note afloat between 139-09+ to 139-16+ overnight session parameters. Although weak Eurozone data and projections of worse to come have not really prompted much obvious upside, bonds haven’t been too unsettled by a decent rebound in stocks as the asset classes decouple and head into pre-weekend US data in short-covering/consolidation mode.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month continue to grind higher amid rosier demand and storage prospects alongside a more bullish supply backdrop. Furthermore, the IEA’s more optimistic comments regarding the demand slump not being as steep as feared underpin the complex. That being said, desks note that despite the above, the market remains in surplus, but the magnitude of inventory builds has declined vs. April levels – resulting in strengthening time spreads and narrower contango – suggesting that market improving fundamentals. “we still believe that in the near-term, the upside is limited given that we are still in a surplus environment and as there is plenty of inventory for the market to digest.” ING writes. <strong>WTI</strong> June hovers around USD 28.00/bbl having printed a base at USD 27.24/bbl, whilst <strong>Brent</strong> July dipped just below 32/bbl in a USD 30.84-32.50/bbl intraday band. For reference<strong>, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo will be appearing on Bloomberg TV at 1500BST</strong>. Meanwhile, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> tracks Dollar action and gains further ground above 1700/oz – eyeing potential resistance at USD 1738.50/oz (April 23rd high), having traded in a USD 1729-38/oz band thus far. <strong>Copper</strong> prices move higher in tandem with the broader risk sentiment, but prices remain contained within recent ranges.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY/DXY</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding an element of Friday fatigue and cautious trade ahead of potentially market-moving US data in the form of retail sales and ip ahead of preliminary Michigan sentiment, the Yen and Dollar look tightly bound above 107.00 amidst a recovery in broad sentiment and particularly large expiries rolling off at the NY cut, with over 2 bn at the figure and 107.50 keeping Usd/Jpy contained. Moreover, the remaining Greenback/G10 pairings are also sticking to relatively tight lines awaiting more decisive direction following choppy and erratic price action so far this week, as the <strong>DXY </strong>consolidates just off yesterday’s new mtd high (100.56) within a 100.390-160 range.</p><p><strong>EUR/AUD/CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>As noted above, not much deviation or adverse reaction to Eurozone GDP data that was remarkably close to consensus and largely ignored on the basis that the current quarter will be more telling in terms of gauging COVID-19 contagion. Indeed, after Germany’s 2.2% q/q contraction the Economy Ministry noted no improvement in April vs tangible evidence of recovery from this month, but still predicts a 10% fall overall in Q2. However, the single currency is clinging to 1.0800 vs the Buck following Thursday’s foray below the round number that almost tripped stops at 1.0775. Meanwhile, the Aussie, Loonie and Franc are all meandering between narrow bands against their US counterpart around 0.6460, 1.4045 and 0.9725 respectively, with the former not gleaning much from mixed Chinese data overnight, but the Cad cushioned by firm crude prices and the Chf still wary about ongoing official intervention given further retracement from recent peaks against the Eur to fresh multi-year highs less than 10 pips from 1.0500.</p><p><strong>GBP/SEK/NOK/NZD</strong></p><p>Cable remains on the cusp of steeper declines unless 1.2200 continues to provide psychological support or the Pound survives another test of 1.2166 from a technical perspective awaiting updates on this week’s last session of UK-EU trade negotiations. Conversely, the Swedish and Norwegian Kronas appear to have run in to some resistance in Euro cross terms ahead of 10.5800 and 10.9500 respectively, but both retain upward thrust towards the upper bounds of 10.7100-10.5600 and 11.1855-10.9250 extremes on the week so far, in contrast to the Kiwi that is languishing under 0.6000 vs its US peer and not far from 1.0800 against the Aussie in wake of clear NIRP inferences from the RBNZ.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Most regional currencies are going through the motions, but the Lira has now touched 6.9000 as its resurgence gathers more steam and the Mexican Peso is taking the Banxico’s latest 50 bp ease in stride. However, the Czech Koruna has been hit by comments from CNB Governor Runok playing down the prospect of implementing an FX regime and resorting to negative rates following mixed Q1 GDP reads vs forecasts, albeit q/q and y/y contractions vs better than expected Hungarian, Polish and Romanian prints.</p>",

Accordingly, both auto and gasoline spending should push sales sharply lower, Credit Suisse believes, with gasoline prices down around 25% M/M seasonally adjusted, amid a consumer demand collapse. Vehicle sales are also seen dragging, after falling to a rate of 8.6mln SAAR in April, down from 11.3mln.</li><li>CS warns that there is likely to be drastic divergence in the various spending categories; restaurants, malls, clothing, and home improvement store sales should fall off significantly as shops shut down, the bank says, but grocery, health care, and online shopping likely rose in the month as stockpiling continued and more purchases shifted online.</li><li>Regarding the control group measure, which feeds into GDP, CS looks for a decline of 3.7% after the prior month's +2.0%. Looking ahead, the bank argues that as states reopen in May, it expects April to mark the trough in consumption. \"However, the recovery in spending will only be gradual as reopening occurs in phases and consumption behaviour shifts.\" Overall CS expects consumption to fall by 23% Q/Q annualised in Q2, the worst quarter since WWII.</li></ul>",

(Newswires)</p><p>North Korea media slammed South Korea regarding the recent human rights report on North Korea which it called a grave political provocation. (Yonhap)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Treasuries continued to bull-flatten on Thursday amid fading risk appetite and hunger for yield. By settlement, yields were down between 1-6bps. After two sessions of losses in major US equity bourses, it appeared that the trend was set to continue for a third day following another red open, although bourses managed to claw back losses through the session. Nonetheless, the TPLEX was less convinced by the reversal, and maintained its flattening bias. Note that after the heavy duration supply this week from the Treasury, in addition to corporates and SSAs, there was likely some additional upward pressure for USTs – although next week’s ’20-20-20’ supply looms. Meanwhile, participants would be well reminded to pay attention to Friday’s week ahead schedule form the NY Fed to see whether or not it will continue to taper its asset purchases. US T-note futures (M0) settled 6+ ticks higher at 139-13+.</p><p><strong>Fed's Kaplan (voter, neutral)</strong> reiterated he does not favour Fed using negative rates and suggested it could do great damage for the US, while repeated the view that unemployment rate will reach 10% by year-end and stated more fiscal stimulus is required to work that down, sees annualized GDP contraction of 25%-30% in Q2 then grow in H2.

ASX 200 (+1.2%) was buoyed by strength in mining names and with financials cheering the outperformance of their Wall St peers amid recent M&amp;A chatter and the Fed’s push-back on negative rates, while Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) initially outperformed due to confirmation the government will lift the State of Emergency in 39 prefectures although the gains were briefly wiped out considering that Tokyo was not included in those areas and with the index failing to hold above the 20K level. Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) were choppy due to the mixed data releases and following the PBoC’s tepid actions whereby it announced a CNY 100bln Medium-term Lending Facility which was half of what had expired yesterday and kept the rate unchanged at 2.95%, but noted that the second phase of its previously announced RRR cuts took effect from today and would release about CNY 200bln of long-term liquidity. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher but with the gains only marginal amid the indecisive overnight risk tone and with the BoJ also present in the market for relatively reserved JPY 80bln in up to 1yr JGBs, as well as JPY 370bln in the belly.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade indecisive after the momentum from the financials-led rebound on Wall St gradually faded as the region digested mixed Chinese data in which Industrial Production topped estimates but Retail Sales disappointed with a larger than expected contraction. ASX 200 (+0.8%) is buoyed by strength in mining names and with financials cheering the outperformance of their Wall St peers amid recent M&amp;A chatter and Fed push-back on negative rates, while Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) initially outperformed due to confirmation the government will lift the State of Emergency in 39 prefectures although the gains were short-lived considering that Tokyo was not included in those areas and with the index failing to hold above the 20K level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) were underwhelmed by the mixed data releases and following the PBoC’s tepid actions whereby it announced a CNY 100bln Medium-term Lending Facility which was half of what had expired yesterday and kept the rate unchanged at 2.95%, but noted that the second phase of its previously announced RRR cuts took effect from today and would release about CNY 200bln of long-term liquidity.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY trades choppy beneath resistance at 100.50 with price action contained amid US-China tensions and after President Trump’s recent rhetoric including his jawboning on negative rates and suggestion that it was a great time to have a strong USD. EUR/USD is kept rangebound around 1.0800 and GBP/USD consolidates above 1.2200 after recent comments from BoE Governor Bailey who suggested not to rule out negative rates forever although it was not something the Bank was currently contemplating. Elsewhere, USD/JPY mirrored the flimsy risk appetite in Japan, while antipodeans marginally pulled back after the mixed Chinese data releases.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher but with the gains only marginal amid the indecisive overnight risk tone and with the BoJ also present in the market for relatively reserved JPY 80bln in up to 1yr JGBs, as well as JPY 370bln in the belly.</p>",
