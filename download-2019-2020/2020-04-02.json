Futures spiked higher overnight on the announcement the Fed would be suspending USTs and Federal Deposits from the supplementary leverage ratio, supporting banks in maintaining onto Treasuries, although faded the move during APAC trade. Furthermore, similar to Wednesday’s tape action, the complex was sold into the afternoon where the Fed resumed its Treasury purchases, albeit at a smaller clip of USD 60bln per day (down from USD 75bln), which was likely an influencing factor behind the higher offer-to-cover ratios; a crude spike induced rally in equities likely supported the offer in Treasuries too. Note the curve sold off in a steepener fashion after the Fed carried out its long-end purchases first, as it has been doing in prior sessions, before moving up the curve. The corporate issuance bonanza continued with around ten IG issuers coming to the dollar market, including a USD 19bln 5-parter (5s, 7s, 10s, 20s, 30s) for its Sprint (S) merger. Signs of a healthier corporate debt market have been felt at the front-end too, where the NY Fed noted AA-rated CP spreads continue to decline; the USD 3-month FRA-OIS spread narrowed by 8bps to 113bps on the session. Looking at the T-Curve at settlement, yields were little changed, with yields within 2bps higher/lower. T-note (M0) futures settled 3 ticks lower at 138-28+.</p>",

Note that the peak equity gains were relatively modest anyhow, trading around 2% higher at their magnum, which prior to COVID-19 outbreak would raise eyebrows, although with the VIX above 50 and off the back of days with >4% moves, the strength felt more tamed. Meanwhile, BofA was the latest to slash its S&amp;P 500 targets, suggesting it could take multiple years to recover lost corporate earnings: SPX year-end PT cut to 2,600 from 3,100 and 2020 EPS forecast cut to 115 Dollars from 138. The overall risk picture, as gauged by major assets, was slightly ambiguous, where equities and oil were bid, but so was gold, rising around 30 bucks back above USD 1,600/oz, while the Treasury curve was little budged.

Note that Trump followed up the tweet saying the cut could be as much as 15mln bbls, although it is worth noting he did not specify the time frame, i.e. per day/week/month… A Russian Kremlin spokesperson followed up the remarks saying that Putin had not spoke to the Saudi Crown Prince. However, Saudi press reported that, at the request of Trump, the Kingdom is calling for an emergency OPEC+ meeting in efforts to reach a fair oil agreement to stabilise the market. WSJ sources also reported that Saudi is mulling an output cut beneath 9mln BPD if others were to join in; adding that it wants other producers, such as the US, Canada, Mexico and others in G20 to take part in any cuts. A Saudi official, as cited by the WSJ, said the “best-case scenario would be, maybe a six-million-barrels-a-day cut… I’m not sure how he reached those figures or which countries he has in mind.” Furthermore, a US administration official later said the US does not know formal details of Saudi/Russian plans to cut supply and that Trump is not planning on asking domestic producers to agree on a specific cut, highlighting that producers are already cutting output as they run into storage capacity. However, Trump’s remarks gained some added credence after the Texas Railroad Commissioner Sitton tweeted that he had a great conversation with Russia's Energy Minister Novak, where both agreed COVID-19 requires an unprecedented level of international cooperation and that they \"Discussed 10mbpd out of global supply\"; adding that he looks forward to speaking with Saudi Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman soon. Overnight, Trump said he thinks Saudi and Russia will make a deal, possibly within a few days, regarding oil production and suggested that he may know how to solve it. The DoE, as previously suggested, announced it will be offering oil producers the option to lease space in the SPR, initially 30mln bbls worth of space but with intention to increase that by another 47mln bbls (which would mark full capacity); DoE expects the first crude deliveries to occur in late April or early May. Meanwhile, global storage capacity draws closer where Africa storage tanks are reportedly reaching their tops amid the flood of supply to the market, while separate industry sources suggest that oil traders are storing as much as 80mln bbls of oil on tankers at sea. China announcing it is to begin purchasing oil for state reserves will provide some relief.</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>Treasury Department said US Social Security recipients will automatically receive coronavirus economic impact payments, while there were separate reports that the Treasury is planning to hire Wall St advisors to advise on providing aid to the airline sector from the recently approved USD 2tln stimulus bill. Meanwhile, sources have suggested top US banks have threatened to forgo the government’s small-business rescue programme due to concerns of financial and legal risk associated with it. Regarding a part 4 stimulus bill, House Minority Leader McCarthy said it is too soon to be discussing such currently; note that Republican lawmakers have expressed caution in moving ahead to the next bill, instead opting for focus to ensure the recently passed bill feeds through to the economy.</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS: </strong>The Trump administration is reportedly tightening rules to stop China from obtaining its advanced tech for commercial use, before diverting it to military use, according to sources.</p><p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p><p><strong>FED: </strong>In its latest stimulus efforts, the Fed has exempted US Treasury debt and Federal Reserve deposits from banks’ supplementary leverage ratio for one year as it seeks to ease strains in Treasury market and boost banks' ability to provide credit – the Fed estimates the latest proposal should free up USD 76bln. It is widely considered that one of the strains limiting credit availability, and a reason behind the “repo madness” in September, is banks’ unwillingness to lend due to regulatory requirements around the balance sheet, such as the leverage ratio, thus exempting some collateral from the requirement will reduce the strain on banks associated with lending.</p><p><strong>REST OF WORLD</strong></p><p><strong>EUROPEAN STIMULUS:</strong> EU Commission proposed borrowing EUR 100bln against EU government guarantees to finance the EU short-time work scheme, according to a document and in line with prior reports. The document urged a quick resolution on a new long-term budget that would support the recovery from epidemic effects; stated that there will be no national co-financing requirement for any of the EU's cohesion funds. Subsequently, EU Commission President Von der Leyen said that the Gov't heads she spoke to are interested and positive in regards to the short-term work proposal, adding that the EUR 100bln short-term scheme is a massive support; said the invention of new tools would take too long to agree among member states for use in the current crisis. Meanwhile, French Finance Minister Le Maire said Europe should utilise all means available in response to the virus, adding that it should use ESM with light conditionality and no stigma attached; he favours activating new financing from EIB for EUR 200bln. The EU's Economics Commissioner Gentiloni stated that annual GDP growth declines by 3% each month in a lockdown and said there are no discussions regarding a bailout for Italy.</p><p><strong>UK: </strong>A source familiar with discussions said the worst case scenario envisages COVID-19 death toll of 50k if self-isolation is not fully adhered to but the UK is not currently on that path; see April 12th as worst day for deaths, with best case scenario for deaths to keep below 20k.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>WEEKLY JOBLESS CLAIMS </strong>for the week ending 28th March rose to a fresh record high 6.648mln, around double last week’s tally which was in itself a record high. The latest spike in jobless claims will not have an impact on the BLS data; in the corresponding survey period for the BLS data, initial jobless claims rose from 211k to 282k. But ahead, the data signals April’s Employment Situation Report will be grim, given accelerating claims; and ahead, analysts are not convinced the peak is in yet. Total layoffs between the March and April payroll surveys look destined to reach perhaps 16-to-20mln, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, which would be consistent with the unemployment rate rising to 13- to-16%. “We have consistently argued from the beginning that the USD 2trln CARES Act is nothing like big enough; these data, and the numbers which will follow, make another huge package inevitable,” Pantheon said.

The six-month outlook fell 15.9 points to 37.9 but is not quite at a record low as the November 2008 print fell to 31 and Feb 09 saw it at 33. ISM highlights the sub index has been a reliable short run guide for current business conditions over time. Elsewhere, employment came in at 36.7, the lowest since September 2016. Quality of purchases hit a 10+year low at 32.7; July ‘09 saw 31.8. Both top line and forward revenue guidance fell to record lows (the metrics were added in 2012), current revenues fell 29.7 points to 28.6 and expected revenues fell 11.1 points to 38.9. Prices paid, the least affected in the March report, fell 4.2 points to 50.0, the breakeven point.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 3 TICKS LOWER AT 138-28+.</strong></p><p>The TPLEX was little changed amid a choppy session, albeit tight ranges. Futures spiked higher overnight on the announcement the Fed would be suspending USTs and Federal Deposits from the supplementary leverage ratio, supporting banks in maintaining onto Treasuries, although faded the move during APAC trade. Furthermore, similar to Wednesday’s tape action, the complex was sold into the afternoon where the Fed resumed its Treasury purchases, albeit at a smaller clip of USD 60bln per day (down from USD 75bln), which was likely an influencing factor behind the higher offer-to-cover ratios; a crude spike induced rally in equities likely supported the offer in Treasuries too. Note the curve sold off in a steepener fashion after the Fed carried out its long-end purchases first, as it has been doing in prior sessions, before moving up the curve. The corporate issuance bonanza continued with around ten IG issuers coming to the dollar market, including a USD 19bln 5-parter (5s, 7s, 10s, 20s, 30s) for its Sprint (S) merger. Signs of a healthier corporate debt market have been felt at the front-end too, where the NY Fed noted AA-rated CP spreads continue to decline; the USD 3-month FRA-OIS spread narrowed by 8bps to 113bps on the session. Looking at the T-Curve at settlement, yields were little changed, with yields within 2bps higher/lower.</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +2.26% at 2526, NDX +2% at 7636, DJIA +2.15% at 21,395.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy<strong> </strong>+9%, Utilities +8.2%, Consumer Staples +2.9%, Health Care +2.8%, Financials +2.47%, Technology +2.28%, Communication Services +1.82%, Materials +1.5%, Industrials +1.46%, Real Estate +1.34%, Consumer Discretionary +0.35%</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Walgreens (WBA) saw an EPS beat, although revenue and US Pharmacy SSS fell short of estimates. WBA CFO later stated the co. is to defer some investments, adding some strong sales have slowed and are now declining but it will continue with its share repurchase programme and has no plan to cut its dividend. Amazon (AMZN) had an EU court rule in its favour that it is not responsible for trademark violations on its Marketplace platform. Boeing (BA) CEO announced the company has initiated voluntary layoffs to respond to current market conditions, allowing employees to exit with some benefits, adding it will continue to drive the safe return to service of the 737 MAX. Boeing (BA) also stated it will continue to deliver on its commercial, defense and space programs and it will be able to meet customer commitments. Ford (F) Q1 total sales fell 12.5% to 516.300 vehicles. General Electric (GE) Aviation is to lay off 50% of its engine manufacturing staff amid COVID-19 weighing on business. Walmart (WMT) has put its sale of its majority stake in UK's Asda on hold as coronavirus upends the grocery industry. Spruce Point announced its new short position is WD-40 (WDFC). The Information reported Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) rides are -50% Y/Y amid the coronavirus. Luckin Coffee (LK) are -75% after it announced it has formed a special committee to oversee an internal investigation which found its COO fabricated sales of the financial statements for FY19. Zoom Video (ZM) announced its daily users hit a new record of 200mln, up from the previous record of 10mln.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>DXY:</strong> The dollar index saw a choppy trade. Initial weakness in the morning was pared, with the DXY rising to highs at 100.180 prior to the jobless claims data (which spiked to 6.6mln), which resulted in some initial USD weakness. The reversal post data continued as US President Trump announced he expects a 10-15mln BPD oil production from Russia and Saudi after speaking to the Saudi Crown Prince; energy prices surge in the first real sign of a potential easing of the ongoing pricing war and thus saw petro-currencies initially rally with CAD, RUB, MXN, appreciating; weighing on the dollar index slightly. However, later comments from a US and Saudi official walked back on the initial figures, raising eyebrows among participants with regards to the accuracy of Trump's announcement, spurring another bout of risk-off, and DXY to fresh daily highs around 100.41, while also seeing a slight reversal in petro currencies, as energy pared gains. CAD, however, was flat heading into the overnight session and MXN weaker, while the buck was off highs. Analysts at ING highlight the recent strength in the dollar is spurred by USD funding challenges and a “mass exodus in portfolio flows from emerging markets”; it does however argue that the dollar strength is temporary, and expects funding issues to improve over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> EURUSD fell victim to the buck strength, once again, and crossed beneath 1.0850 which coincided with DXY reclaiming 100.0. Technicians are keeping an eye on Fib level at 1.0837 to the downside ahead of 1.08 as areas of support. Lloyds FX analysts stated that a move through 1.0835/1.08 would question their bullish outlook, and risks a retesting of the 1.0615-1.05 support region. The bank highlights the continuation of a correction from 1.1170 but they “remain biased that pullbacks are corrective ahead of a further recovery from 1.0635 toward the 1.14-1.15 previous highs”.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Cable traded between the 1.2351-1.2474 parameters amid a lack of fundamental updates although EURGBP dipped further beneath 0.88 towards its 200dma at 0.8753 and a Fib retracement level at 0.8748. ING thinks GBP is no longer meaningfully suffering in a risk off environment which shows an improvement on the USD funding situation and decline in FX volatility. The desk writes this “makes the external-funding-needs-dependent GBP less vulnerable and leads to a lower currency downside”.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The loonie initially saw a turnaround from recent weakness amid a nice bounce in oil prices as President Trump expects a deal between Saudi and Russia, while later announcing he expects the two nations to cut production by 10-15mln BPD, a positive sign in the pricing war between the two. However, as both Saudi and US officials walked back on Trump’s announcement a slight reversal was seen in the crude complex and thus in the Loonie, which saw USDCAD flat amid a dollar bid. Scotiabank writes “we rather think USDCAD is carving out a broad range trade between 1.39/1.40 on the downside and 1.45/1.47 on the topside; uncertainty will limit CAD gains while the expanding Fed balance sheet will curb USD strength.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> AUD not quite the G10 underperformer today, but took a knock in later trade amid a souring in risk appetite, seeing AUDUSD just off session lows. As the government is about to increase bond issuance to fund its 16% of GDP fiscal package, the RBA may have to increase the size of its balance sheet at a quicker rate in the near term, some have argued.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY/XAU/CHF:</strong> Havens were mixed today as the dollar took haven status weighing on JPY amid today’s clouded risk sentiment. Meanwhile, gold continued its rise and reclaimed USD 1,600 to the upside. CHF was firmer against the EUR and around the 1.0550 level, but weaker against the buck given the strength in the greenback.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> EM was weaker against a rising dollar, although RUB and TRY were the outliers with the former benefiting from positive developments on the Russia/Saudi oil pricing war which led to a rally in crude prices, while Lira retraced some of the prior day losses after USDTRY hit a record high. MXN initially benefited from the announcement from US President Trump although as officials walked back on the comments slightly, MXN reversed course and was weaker against the USD as the buck caught a bid throughout the remainder of the session.&nbsp;</p>",

Note that Trump followed up the tweet saying the cut could be as much as 15mln bbls, although it is worth noting he did not specify the time frame, i.e. per day/week/month… A Russian Kremlin spokesperson followed up the remarks saying that Putin had not spoke to the Saudi Crown Prince. However, Saudi press reported that, at the request of Trump, the Kingdom is calling for an emergency OPEC+ meeting in efforts to reach a fair oil agreement to stabilise the market. WSJ sources also reported that Saudi is mulling an output cut beneath 9mln BPD if others were to join in; adding that it wants other producers, such as the US, Canada, Mexico and others in G20 to take part in any cuts. A Saudi official, as cited by the WSJ, said the “best-case scenario would be, maybe a six-million-barrels-a-day cut… I’m not sure how he reached those figures or which countries he has in mind.” Furthermore, a US administration official later said the US does not know formal details of Saudi/Russian plans to cut supply and that Trump is not planning on asking domestic producers to agree on a specific cut, highlighting that producers are already cutting output as they run into storage capacity. However, Trump’s remarks gained some added credence after the Texas Railroad Commissioner Sitton tweeted that he had a great conversation with Russia's Energy Minister Novak, where both agreed COVID-19 requires an unprecedented level of international cooperation and that they \"Discussed 10mbpd out of global supply\"; adding that he looks forward to speaking with Saudi Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman soon. Overnight, Trump said he thinks Saudi and Russia will make a deal, possibly within a few days, regarding oil production and suggested that he may know how to solve it. The DoE, as previously suggested, announced it will be offering oil producers the option to lease space in the SPR, initially 30mln bbls worth of space but with intention to increase that by another 47mln bbls (which would mark full capacity); DoE expects the first crude deliveries to occur in late April or early May. Meanwhile, global storage capacity draws closer where Africa storage tanks are reportedly reaching their tops amid the flood of supply to the market, while separate industry sources suggest that oil traders are storing as much as 80mln bbls of oil on tankers at sea. China announcing it is to begin purchasing oil for state reserves will provide some relief.</li></ul>",

However, Eur/Usd subsequently tumbled below 1.0850 and only found a base inches above Fib support at 1.0837 after the Greenback lost momentum in wake of dire NY business conditions and flat factory orders.</p><p><strong>CHF/AUD/JPY/NZD/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also undermined by the US Dollar’s more pronounced bounce, with the Franc retreating through 0.9700, Aussie reversing towards 0.6000 and Yen waning again following a closer look at 107.00. Similarly, the Kiwi is struggling to keep tabs on 0.5900 and Loonie is paring best crude inspired gains of 1.4100+ even though oil prices received another huge boost via US President Trump claiming that he expects (and hopes could be the caveat) Saudi Arabia and Russia to agree on a 10-15 bn production reduction compounded by reports that the Kingdom has called for an emergency OPEC+ summit. Note, little reaction to in line Swiss CPI data, but looming comments from SNB’s Maechler and Moser will be monitored given that Eur/Chf is still well under 1.0600.</p><p><strong>NOK/RUB/MXN/GBP</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Crown has been outperforming for the most part and naturally got more fuel from the aforementioned spike in crude along with fellow WTI and Brent backed counterparts like the Russian Rouble and Mexican Peso. Indeed, Eur/Nok stayed well off near 11.4800 peaks, Usd/Rub recoiled from circa 79.2400 and Usd/Mxn probed sub-24.0000 from 24.5000+ at one stage.

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>FUTURES:</strong> After Wednesday's fall on Wall Street, US equity futures saw decent gains in pre-market action, however gains have reversed and briefly entered negative territory after the dismal jobless claims data which fared worse than all analyst forecast, albeit now trade slightly positive. Overnight, Asia enjoyed a calmer session, and European stocks are currently in the red (with energy outperforming, travel and leisure still underperforming).</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy stocks are tracking crude prices higher upwards on talk of a truce between Russia/Saudi/US. Financials slightly lower amid lower yields, consumer staples being weighed on by Walgreens (WBA) earnings.</p><p><strong>US STOCK NEWS: </strong>Walgreens (WBA) saw an EPS beat, although revenue and US Pharmacy SSS fell short of estimates. WBA CFO later stated the co. is to defer some investments, adding some strong sales have slowed and are now declining but it will continue with its share repurchase programme and has no plan to cut its dividend. Boeing (BA) CEO announced the company has initiated voluntary layoffs to respond to current market conditions, allowing employees to exit with some benefits, adding it will continue to drive the safe return to service of the 737 MAX, and it will continue to deliver on its commercial, defense and space programs, and it will be able to meet customer commitments. Ford (F) Q1 total sales fell 12.5% to 516.300 vehicles. Luckin Coffee (LK) are -83% after it announced it has formed a special committee to oversee an internal investigation which found its COO fabricated sales of the financial statements for FY19.</p><p><strong>MACRO: </strong>Treasuries bid across the curve, dollar index is firmer, and around session highs back above 100; oil is up over 5%, off recent highs.<strong> </strong>Sentiment however has been hampered after the jobless claims data saw a rise to 6.6mln above the top end of analyst forecasts; Goldman expected 6mln. Today’s weekly data is far more important than Friday’s monthly Employment Situation Report and is a key input into economists’ US economic recession (and recovery) models.</p><p><strong>FED OPERATIONS: </strong>The Fed will be buying USD 60bln of Treasuries daily on Thursday and Friday, a lower pace than the USD 75bln of daily purchases on Monday to Wednesday. Full schedule of today’s purchases and amounts can be <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/daily-fed-planned-treasury-tips-purchase-amounts-and-schedules-2nd-april-2020-02-04-2020\">found here</a>.</p><p><strong>STOCK VALUATIONS:</strong> Perhaps one of the more underreported reasons for the pressure on stocks is due to corporates cutting guidance and dividends a couple of weeks ahead of earnings season. The S&amp;P's forward P/E ratio mean estimate is under 17 now, according to Refinitiv, whereas a few weeks ago it was over 20. UBS says that the index is currently being held-up by lofty P/E in growth stocks; the forward P/E of the high-growth segment has only contracted to 2016 levels thus far, and the bank says this is at odds with P/E in deep value, which suggests that the discounting has scope to run further in the \"growthier\" parts of the index. UBS says stocks will continue to remain under pressure until earnings expectations find a footing.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Expectations are for 3.5mln in the week of 22-28 March (range 1.5mln to 6mln) against the prior 3.28mln (which was a record high). Continuing claims (an important signal in GDP models) is expected to print 4.88mln (range 4.5mln to 5mln) from last week's 1.80mln).</li><li>This week's initial jobless claims data takes on a more timely signal about the labour market than Friday's nonfarm payrolls data for March, and will be more relevant for econometric models that attempt to forecast recessions. It is also key in assessing how deep recessions will be and when the recovery is expected to begin.</li><li>Another important note is that weekly jobless claims data are based on \"hard facts\", UBS points out, unlike survey data which is subject to quirks around a) some of the treatment of supply chains, which has flattered data, b) the fact that many respondents will not be replying to surveys during the virus disruption period, and c) survey data will give more accurate assessments during 'normal' times, perhaps not as much in unusual times.</li><li>Goldman Sachs, which looks for initial jobless claims to print 6mln in the week, says it expects claims to remain elevated in the weeks ahead, with nearly 18mln \"excess\" claims by the end of April. GS highlights the importance of today's data for GDP modelling: \"We estimate that the percent hit to the level of real GDP relative to trend will be roughly equal to excess initial claims in millions divided by 1.5,\" adding that \"a peak in continuing claims should signal that GDP has stabilised, while sharp declines in continuing claims will be the best signal that GDP is recovering.\"</li><li>Some desks have also noted the potential lack of upside for markets from today's release, since a below expected/not as bad as feared print may be disregarded as a by-product of incomplete data, or there being further turmoil ahead regardless. Whilst an above expected/worse than feared print will add to the narrative that the US labour market is due for a tumultuous out-turn, which could prompt analysts to further revise higher their calls for the unemployment rate.</li></ul>",

(Twitter)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European stocks attempt to clamber from yesterday’s steep losses (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.4%)</strong> after sentiment somewhat improved in APAC trade following a downbeat session on Wall Street. Bourses see modest broad-based gains, with Netherland’s AEX (+1.2%) leading the pack – propped up by Shell’s (+9%) Dutch listing and with ABN AMRO (+8.3%) and ING Groep (+1.8%) rebounding from the broad downside seen in banks yesterday. Meanwhile, US equity futures see more pronounced gains with the contracts higher to the tune of 2%. Sector-wise, Energy significantly outperforms – led by the price action in the oil complex as President Trump voiced optimism regarding a Saudi/Russia resolution, whilst demand from China keeps the sector underpinned. Other sectors are broadly mixed with underperformance seen in IT and Utility names – sectors do not reflect a specific risk tone. Travel &amp; Leisure reside at the bottom of the pack as it feels no reprieve from the demand destruction caused by the virus outbreak. In terms of movers, the top of the Stoxx 600 was initially largely dominated by oil and gas names with Aker BP, Subsea losing steam as trade went underway whilst Tullow Oil (+8.0%), BP (+5.5%) and Shell remain among the top gainers. IAG (+2.5%) sees upside amid reports that the Co’s British Airways is nearing a deal to suspend 36k workers given the impact of operations from COVID-19. On the flip side; Carnival (-8.6%) sees pressure after S&amp;P cut its rating to “BBB-“ from “BBB; the lowest investment grade level. Centrica (-7.4%) is weighed on by dividend and guidance suspensions coupled with the interruption of its Spirit Energy divestment. Elsewhere, Handelsblatt reported that the heads of Daimler (+1.0%), BMW (+3%) and Volkswagen (+1.0%) had a conversation with German Chancellor Merkel in which they wanted to explore how the corporations can rekindle production. The auto makers also raised worries regarding supply chains and expressed great concern regarding Southern Europe. On that note, Fiat Chrysler (-1.0%) slid at the open after Italy reported car registrations slumping 85.4% YY in March amid the lockdown measures in the country.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/CAD/NZD/AUD -</strong> The Norwegian Krona and its Scandinavian partner are forging more gains on a combination of constructive technical factors, Euro underperformance and a recovery in oil prices prompted by China replenishing crude reserves at cheaper levels and US President Trump expressing confidence about resolving the spat between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Eur/Nok has been down below 11.2000 and Eur/Sek sub-10.9350, with the former also gleaning encouragement from ramped up Norges Bank selling of foreign currencies in April. Meanwhile, the Loonie is also benefiting from the firmer bounce in oil alongside the Rouble and Mexican Peso, as Usd/Cad tests support around 1.4100, Usd/RUB straddles 78.0000 and Usd/MXN pivots 24.0000. Elsewhere, the Kiwi and Aussie are consolidating off recent lows amidst less volatile trading conditions than seen of late, with Nzd/Usd holding firmly above 0.5900 and Aud/Usd not far from 0.6100 against the backdrop of relatively stable risk sentiment and Moody’s reaffirming NZ’s top notch triple A rating.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY -</strong> As noted above, the single currency remains under pressure across board as COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise in the Euro area, while chart impulses turn more bearish after shallower rebounds in Eur/Usd and even Eur/GBP despite the UK also suffering mounting nCoV infections and fatalities. Indeed, the headline pair has not been able to revisit 1.1000 and looks more prone to relinquishing 1.0900, while the cross is capped beneath 0.8800 after waning well short of 0.8900. Moreover, further or ongoing erosion in Eur/Chf towards 1.0550 is helping to keep the Franc on a fairly even keel vs the Dollar within confined 0.9687-51 parameters, and the Yen is almost as restrained between 107.56-06 eyeing big option expiries in close proximity, but also extending from 106.50 to 108.00-05 – full details on our Headline Feed as 7.29BST.</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> Cautious trade ahead of the 2nd instalment of post-coronavirus global outbreak US initial claims that are widely expected to top last week’s circa 3.3 mn biggest ever total, with GS among those lifting already sky-high projections to 6 mn.

The more pronounced rebound also filtered through to <strong>Bunds </strong>and<strong> US Treasuries</strong> to an extent, although the former remains deep in negative territory after hitting a new Eurex base (171.60 and almost a full point underwater), while the latter is only a few ticks above 139-00 compared to 139-14+ at best. Ahead, all eyes on weekly US claims above all else, aside from breaking virus news of course.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>US President Trump said he thinks Saudi and Russia will make a deal regarding oil production and suggested that he may know how to solve it</strong>.

Bourses see modest broad-based gains, with Netherland’s AEX (+1.2%) leading the pack – propped up by Shell’s (+9%) Dutch listing and with ABN AMRO (+8.3%) and ING Groep (+1.8%) rebounding from the broad downside seen in banks yesterday. Meanwhile, US equity futures see more pronounced gains with the contracts higher to the tune of 2%. Sector-wise, Energy significantly outperforms – led by the price action in the oil complex as President Trump voiced optimism regarding a Saudi/Russia resolution, whilst demand from China keeps the sector underpinned. Other sectors are broadly mixed with underperformance seen in IT and Utility names – sectors do not reflect a specific risk tone. Travel &amp; Leisure reside at the bottom of the pack as it feels no reprieve from the demand destruction caused by the virus outbreak. In terms of movers, the top of the Stoxx 600 was initially largely dominated by oil and gas names with Aker BP, Subsea losing steam as trade went underway whilst Tullow Oil (+8.0%), BP (+5.5%) and Shell remain among the top gainers. IAG (+2.5%) sees upside amid reports that the Co’s British Airways is nearing a deal to suspend 36k workers given the impact of operations from COVID-19. On the flip side; Carnival (-8.6%) sees pressure after S&amp;P cut its rating to “BBB-“ from “BBB; the lowest investment grade level. Centrica (-7.4%) is weighed on by dividend and guidance suspensions coupled with the interruption of its Spirit Energy divestment. Elsewhere, Handelsblatt reported that the heads of Daimler (+1.0%), BMW (+3%) and Volkswagen (+1.0%) had a conversation with German Chancellor Merkel in which they wanted to explore how the corporations can rekindle production. The auto makers also raised worries regarding supply chains and expressed great concern regarding Southern Europe. On that note, Fiat Chrysler (-1.0%) slid at the open after Italy reported car registrations slumping 85.4% YY in March amid the lockdown measures in the country.</p><p>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/CAD/NZD/AUD</strong> - The Norwegian Krona and its Scandinavian partner are forging more gains on a combination of constructive technical factors, Euro underperformance and a recovery in oil prices prompted by China replenishing crude reserves at cheaper levels and US President Trump expressing confidence about resolving the spat between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Eur/Nok has been down below 11.2000 and Eur/Sek sub-10.9350, with the former also gleaning encouragement from ramped up Norges Bank selling of foreign currencies in April. Meanwhile, the Loonie is also benefiting from the firmer bounce in oil alongside the Rouble and Mexican Peso, as Usd/Cad tests support around 1.4100, Usd/RUB straddles 78.0000 and Usd/MXN pivots 24.0000. Elsewhere, the Kiwi and Aussie are consolidating off recent lows amidst less volatile trading conditions than seen of late, with Nzd/Usd holding firmly above 0.5900 and Aud/Usd not far from 0.6100 against the backdrop of relatively stable risk sentiment and Moody’s reaffirming NZ’s top notch triple A rating.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY</strong> - As noted above, the single currency remains under pressure across board as COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise in the Euro area, while chart impulses turn more bearish after shallower rebounds in Eur/Usd and even Eur/GBP despite the UK also suffering mounting nCoV infections and fatalities. Indeed, the headline pair has not been able to revisit 1.1000 and looks more prone to relinquishing 1.0900, while the cross is capped beneath 0.8800 after waning well short of 0.8900. Moreover, further or ongoing erosion in Eur/Chf towards 1.0550 is helping to keep the Franc on a fairly even keel vs the Dollar within confined 0.9687-51 parameters, and the Yen is almost as restrained between 107.56-06 eyeing big option expiries in close proximity, but also extending from 106.50 to 108.00-05 – full details on our Headline Feed as 7.29BST.</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - Cautious trade ahead of the 2nd instalment of post-coronavirus global outbreak US initial claims that are widely expected to top last week’s circa 3.3 mn biggest ever total, with GS among those lifting already sky-high projections to 6 mn.

The more pronounced rebound also filtered through to <strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>US Treasuries</strong> to an extent, although the former remains deep in negative territory after hitting a new Eurex base (171.60 and almost a full point underwater), while the latter is only a few ticks above 139-00 compared to 139-14+ at best. Ahead, all eyes on weekly US claims above all else, aside from breaking virus news of course.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures rebound with a vengeance following yesterday’s deterioration, with upside initially emanating from optimism expressed by US President Trump regarding a Russia/Saudi resolution, whilst gains were exacerbated on reports that China is in the market to purchase cheap oil.&nbsp; Upon the initial announcement, <strong>WTI</strong> futures rose above USD 22/bbl after a settlement at USD 20.31/bbl. <strong>Brent</strong> gained over 10% with prices now north of USD 27/bbl before testing Tuesday’s USD 27.85-90/bbl high. Both contracts have waned off intra-day best levels. The spread between the contracts also widens to USD 5/bbl from the prior days USD 4.40/bbl.&nbsp; Despite the confidence regarding the OPEC+ feud, markets are yet to see a discernible move of reconciliation between Saudi and Russia. Hence, Saudi Aramco OSPs expected to be released on Sunday will be key to gauge whether Saudi maintains its stance in the dispute. Meanwhile, sources reported that China is to utilise the cheap oil prices to fill up emergency reserves, although much speculation will surround this as the Chinese government is unwilling to release information regarding the size, formation or use of its emergency stockpiles. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> continues to recoups losses seen on Tuesday with the yellow metal back below its 21 DMA (USD 1587.40/oz), having earlier failed to convincingly top USD 1600/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile mirrors overall risk-sentiment and edges higher, albeit the red metal remains contained within recent ranges above USD 2/lb. Finally, <strong>Shanghai</strong> <strong>steel</strong> <strong>futures</strong> slid over 3% as it tracked declines in iron ore amid weaker demand prospects from the virus outbreak – with car sales a key gauge of steel demand.</p>",

Conversely, Italian BTPs are paring some losses as the calls for additional fiscal support to combat the coronavirus gather pace with France, the Netherlands and even Germany joining the chorus. In terms of technical, nothing really supportive for Bunds on the charts until 171.54 ahead of 171.50, while Spanish Bonos and French OATs also have multi-tranche supply to digest.</p>",

(Sky News/Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, this week’s safe-haven bid that had spurred the <strong>DXY</strong> back above the 99.00 level has petered out although the pullback is limited with overnight price action stuck around the 99.50 level as participants await the latest US jobless claims data later today ahead of Friday’s NFP figures. The greenback’s major counterparts were also uneventful overnight with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> contained below 1.0950 and in proximity to several hourly moving average levels including its 200-Hour MA at 1.0927, while <strong>GDP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> languished beneath resistance at 1.2400 where there is a small option expiry of GBP 210mln at 1.2390 set to roll off at today’s New York cut. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> attempted to nurse some of the recent losses after support held at 107.00 and antipodeans were lacklustre due to the subdued risk tone, weaker PBoC reference rate and poor Quarterly NAB Business Confidence data for Australia.</p><p>Australian NAB Business Confidence (Q1) -11 (Prev. -1).

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was flat as it mirrored the similar uneventful trade in the greenback, while <strong>copper</strong> was slightly choppy as early weakness was reversed after finding support at the USD 2.15/lb level.</p><p><strong>US President Trump said he thinks Saudi and Russia will make a deal regarding oil production and suggested that he may know how to solve it</strong>.

In related news, an official noted that US intelligence threads have been building for some time on a potential Iran-backed attack against the US in Iraq and that an Iran-backed attack on US personnel in Iraq would likely be deniable, as opposed to state-on-state, while there were also reports that Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei advisor warned the US of consequences of \"provocative actions\" in Iraq. (Newswires)</p><p>US Secretary of State Pompeo tweeted that reports Iranian diplomats were involved in an assassination of a dissident in Turkey are disturbing but consistent with their assignments, while he added that Iran's \"diplomats\" are agents of terror and have conducted multiple assassinations and bomb plots in Europe in the past decade. (Twitter)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX flattened amid a stock sell-off and issuance weighted towards the front. The T-Note caught its bid overnight and faded off its highs as Europeans left for the session. Desks noted that real money remained an aggressive seller into the Fed’s buy-back operations, where the T-Note rolled lower in the later part of the session alongside a high offer-to-cover ratio in the Fed’s 7- to 20-year maturity operation, perhaps a signal participants are happier to sell their UST holdings at these rates. It also may be ahead of Thursday, where the Fed will taper back its UST purchases from USD 75bln to 60bln a day, where there could be some front-running any perceived sell-off as the Fed begins to step back. Furthermore, corporates continue to swamp the issuance channels, including some European’s coming to the Dollar market on Wednesday – USD 6bln from AB InBev (10s, 20s, 30s, 40s) and USD 5bln from Equinor (5s, 7s, 10s, 20s, 30s). Elsewhere, note that the Fed’s RRP saw a fall in demand to USD 207.83bln across less counterparties, coinciding with slightly firmer GC rates, while the regular O/N repo operation in the morning saw zero bids, and a marginal amount in the afternoon. By settlement the curve was flatter, 2s unch. at 0.23%, 10s -6.5bps at 0.63%, 30s -6.5bps at 1.29%. T-note (M0) futures settled 9+ ticks higher at 138-31+.</p><p><strong>Fed exempted US Treasury debt and Federal Reserve deposits from supplementary leverage ratio for one year as it seeks to ease strains in Treasury market</strong> and boost banks' ability to provide credit.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mixed after a weak handover from Wall St where stocks extended on the prior quarter’s historical rout to finish the day with losses of more than 4% and the DJIA suffered a near 1000-point drop amid ongoing coronavirus fears. ASX 200 (-1.3%) was dragged lower by its top-weighted financials sector after the RBNZ ordered all banks in New Zealand to suspend dividends which pressured Australia’s big 4 that have operations across the Tasman and amid concerns there could be similar restrictions domestically, with airline shares also in a tailspin after the government denied Virgin Australia’s request for a loan and indicated it would not provide the Co. with a bailout. Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) was also downbeat but off lows as the JPY-risk dynamic remained the main driver for Tokyo sentiment and with automakers lacklustre following abysmal monthly sales updates. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) struggled for direction amid the broad cautiousness and after PBoC liquidity inaction, while tensions with the US also risk flaring up as the latter is to tighten rules to prevent China from obtaining US tech for commercial purposes that could also be applied for military use and following US intelligence reports that alleged China concealed the coronavirus outbreak and underreported the number of cases and deaths. Finally, 10yr JGBs initially continued its pullback to below 152.50 with demand sapped heading into the 10yr JGB auction, although prices the rebounded on return from the lunch break and following mixed results in the 10yr auction which was mixed but still showed a jump in the b/c and minimal tail in price.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed after a weak handover from Wall St where stocks extended on the prior quarter’s historical rout to finish the day with losses of more than 4% amid ongoing coronavirus fears, in which the DJIA suffered a near-1000 point drop. ASX 200 (-2.1%) is dragged lower by its top-weighted financials sector after the RBNZ ordered all banks in the country to suspend dividends which pressured Australia’s big 4 that have operations across the Tasman and amid concerns there could be similar restrictions domestically, with airline shares also in a tailspin after the government denied Virgin Australia’s request for a loan and indicated it would not provide the Co. with a bailout. Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) is also downbeat but off lows as the JPY-risk dynamic remains the main driver for Tokyo sentiment and with automakers lacklustre following abysmal monthly sales updates, while Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) struggle for direction amid the broad cautiousness and after PBoC liquidity inaction. In addition, tensions with the US also risk flaring up as the US is to tighten rules to prevent China from obtaining US tech for commercial purposes that could also be applied for military use and following US intelligence reports that alleged China concealed the coronavirus outbreak and underreported the number of cases and deaths.</p><p>In FX markets, this week’s safe-haven bid that had spurred the DXY back above the 99.00 level has petered out although the pullback is limited with overnight price action stuck around the 99.50 level as participants await the latest US jobless claims data later today ahead of Friday’s NFP figures. The greenback’s major counterparts are also uneventful overnight with EUR/USD contained below 1.0950 and in proximity to several hourly moving average levels including its 200-Hour MA at 1.0927, while GDP/USD is restricted beneath resistance at 1.2400 where there is a small option expiry of GBP 210mln at 1.2390 set to roll off at today’s New York cut. Elsewhere, USD/JPY attempts to nurse some of the recent losses after support held at 107.00 and antipodeans are lacklustre due to the subdued risk tone, weaker PBoC reference rate and poor Quarterly NAB Business Confidence data for Australia.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs failed to benefit from the negative risk tone in Tokyo and continued its pullback to below 152.50, with demand sapped heading into the latest 10yr auction due later.</p>",
