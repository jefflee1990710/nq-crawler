(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>US stock futures were on the front-foot overnight, supported by headlines suggesting that the PBOC would provide greater support. However, downside in European trade was attributed to punchy US/China headlines from Chinese press, as well as some concerns about COVID stats rising as European economies re-open. After the Europeans left for the day, a falling VIX and thin news flow allowed stocks to tick higher, led by the NQ, although there didn’t appear to be a specific catalyst (desks note technical and flows will influence trade in these conditions). Momentum/defensive names performed well today with MTUM +1.7%, while technology outperformed with the software focused ETF (FDN) reaching all-time highs; NDQ outperformed the SPX and DJIA. On Wednesday, Cisco (CSCO) report its figures, with analysts paying close attention to the results given its usefulness as a current barometer for the wider tech sector. Apple (AAPL) is in talks with Indian government officials to move up to USD 40bln of production to India from China, according to The Economic Times. President Trump’s administration and semiconductor companies are reportedly looking to start the development of new chip factories in the US amid concerns about reliance on Asia for technology, according to WSJ. Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 China Sales -64% M/M in April. CEO Musk announced the Co is to leave California immediately after regulations stopped Tesla from restarting production at its Fremont factory, although Verge later reported it has already begun manufacturing vehicles at its Fremont factory. SPX +0.01% at 2930, NDQ +0.85% at 9299, DJIA -0.45% at 24,222.</p><p>The TPLEX sold off on Monday amid a chunky supply pipeline and strength in equities. Yields had been heading modestly lower in European trade as equity futures reversed their strength set at the open on Sunday, however, a pick-up in equities, led by the NQ, saw duration come under pressure. Furthermore, participants had, and still have, a slew of supply to digest this week, where the US sold USD 42bln of three-year notes as part of its refunding today (stopped through the 0.233% WI by 0.3bps, covered 2.54x and Dealers took 32.59%). At the same time, the Dollar corporate issuance continued to churn post Q1 earnings, with today’s big deals pricing include Disney’s USD 11bln six-trancher and PayPal’s USD 4bln four-trancher. By settlement, yields were up between 3-6bps (3 on the short-end, 6 on the long-end) and the curve had bear-steepened. US T-note futures (M0) settled 10+ ticks lower at 138-20.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

However, downside in European trade was attributed to punchy US/China headlines from Chinese press, as well as some concerns about COVID stats rising as European economies re-open. After the Europeans left for the day, a falling VIX and thin news flow allowed stocks to tick higher, led by the NQ, although there didn’t appear to be a specific catalyst (desks note technicals and flows will influence trade in these conditions. The gains, however, lacked conviction as SPX finished flat; NDX outperformed. Treasuries bear-steepened; we get upsized Treasury offerings in the 3-year, 10-year (Tue) and 30-year (Wed) space this week; the former was digested with seeming ease on Monday, stopping through the screens by 0.3bps. However, the MOVE index (The VIX equivalent for Treasuries) has seen a recent move higher, which warrants caution given the VIX, which now sits comfortably below 30, has historically followed it, although the MOVE does still sit at historically low levels and significantly below its March peak. Meanwhile, the dollar has had a slightly firmer bias, although gold traded mixed around USD 1,700. Oil was initially supported by positive supply-side news flow, where the Saudi/UAE/Kuwait block have cut output for June by more than their OPEC+ obligations, though analysts noted that sourced reports from April implied they would have cut by a greater additional amount than reported today. This week, we will be watching Fed chair Powell comments on Wednesday, US CPI on Tuesday and retail sales on Thursday. Additionally, there will be an eye on the 10-year and 30-year supply to see how it is digested at these yields and while the Treasury is ramping-up issuance.</p><h2><strong>NORTH AMERICA</strong></h2><p><strong>US/CHINA:</strong> Over the weekend, US officials acknowledged China was largely delivering its pledges on structural issues such as opening market access and improving IP protection, but they are yet to agree in some details including IP action plan and easing equity caps for foreign investors. Furthermore, the source stated fallout from the virus meant agreement on purchasing US goods has become much more important and that many believe China needs to increase pace on purchases, while a Chinese government adviser suggested the deal itself was fragile, according to reports. Source reports from China Global times saw a hawkish tone from China and reportedly called for a re-negotiation of the Phase One deal. The piece noted Chinese dissatisfaction amid compromises the side made to press ahead with the Phase One deal, while Trump’s anti-China rhetoric and “cover up” of his handling of the pandemic reportedly saw advisers float the possibility of voiding the trade pact and renegotiating one skewed more towards China’s interests. Another official, citing US’ staggering economy and the Presidential Election, said \"It's in fact in China's interests to terminate the current phase one deal. It is beneficial to us. The US now cannot afford to restart the trade war with China”. That being said, analysts believe China will only terminate the agreement as a “last option”.

On stimulus he noted it does not appear there will be bipartisan support for next COVID support Bills, adding democrats want to spend a lot of money. On rates, he did not comment on Fed interest rates but noted the Treasury is borrowing more money in long-term tenors to lock-in low the low rates. Mnuchin said there is no need to buy back debt, the Treasury is keeping some funds in reserve since it does not know which facilities and markets will need more funding. He added the Fed muni programme and asset-backed term loan facilities are to be up-and-running soon.</p><h2><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></h2><p><strong>FED: </strong>Bostic and Evans – both non-voters – announced the aversion to negative rates today. Evans said he doesn’t anticipate negative rates would be used, while Bostic said he is not a big fan and considers them as one of the weaker tools available to the Fed. The comments come ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s speech on Wednesday in which he will likely address NIRP amid several Fed Fund futures contracts moving above par. Meanwhile, Evans noted that while recent fiscal and monetary stimulus is cushioning the economic damage, more will be needed.</p><p><strong>REPO: </strong>Demand at the NY Fed’s RRP operation fell to USD 123mln on Monday, which IFR highlights as the lowest takeup since February 14th. Meanwhile, demand for cash ticked up from dealers, where across the one-month term and overnight repo operation, USD 51.25bln of bids were submitted. The takeup in the regular repo operations began increasing at the tail-end of last week, and if sustained through this week, could be indicative of a heat-up of funding pressures. Furthermore, note that after relentless compression since the March blowout, the FRA-OIS spread widening slightly today, which if sustained, could be another barometer indicating renewed funding pressures.</p><p><strong>PBOC: </strong>Over the weekend, the Chinese Central Bank promised to further cushion the impact of the pandemic but remained hesitant to signal a large stimulus move. The statement came after heated debates between Beijing’s top policymakers and the PBoC on the appropriate scale and funding for a package.

Yields had been heading modestly lower in European trade as equity futures reversed their strength set at the open on Sunday, however, a pick-up in equities, led by the NQ, saw duration come under pressure. Furthermore, participants had, and still have, a slew of supply to digest this week, where the US sold USD 42bln of three-year notes as part of its refunding today (stopped through the 0.233% WI by 0.3bps, covered 2.54x and Dealers took 32.59%). At the same time, the Dollar corporate issuance continued to churn post Q1 earnings, with today’s big deals pricing include Disney’s USD 11bln six-trancher and PayPal’s USD 4bln four-trancher. By settlement, yields were up between 3-6bps (3 on the short-end, 6 on the long-end) and the curve had bear-steepened.</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES:</strong> Fed Funds futures unwound some of its recent strength today, away from NIRP. FF futures as early as Jan 2021 had moved above par at the end of last week, although today they have receded back below par, with the nearest contract above now being April 2021. Several desks have written recently that they view the move above par as that of a technical nature (e.g. short squeeze), rather than the market outright assuming the Fed will move into NIRP. BMO’s analysts noted that as long as the Fed does not completely rule out negative rates, we will continue to see parts of the funding markets move into NIRP, as participants essentially hedge the possibility of the Fed going negative, even if the probability is low. Ahead of Fed chair Powell’s speech on Wednesday, where he is expected to address the issue, Evans (non-voter) today said says he doesn't anticipate negative rates would be used, and Bostic (non-voter) said he's not a big fan of the policy and considers it among the weaker tools – note that they did not outright rule out the policy.</p><p><strong>TACTICAL BIAS:</strong> Fed guidance on rates (staying at these low levels for the foreseeable), buying concentrated in the belly, and the possibility of yield curve control (YCC) is outweighing the flood of bill supply in the short-end of the curve, TD Securities argues, keeping rates anchored at low levels. Meanwhile, the long-end of the curve is under pressure as a result of rising Treasury supply. This should give the curve a steeper bias.</p><p><strong>THIS WEEK’S SUPPLY:</strong> The Treasury will auction USD 42bln 3-year notes (Mon), USD 32bln 10-year notes (Tue), and USD 22bln 30-year bonds (Wed). This week's auction will be revealing, given the Treasury's boosted refunding announcement last week. UBS notes that this week, around USD 86bln cash will fall due, including around USD 58bln of redemptions and USD 29bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>PREVIEW - 10-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> There is still demand for 10-year even at slightly higher yields than present, analysts say, citing price action after Wednesday’s Treasury refunding announcement when 10-year yields closed 3-4bps higher, but rallied on Thursday back to within the 0.60-65% range (and respected the 0.78% top-end of its broader range). BMO argues, and that the liquidity advantages of Treasury auctions will continue to bring in buyers, and notes that sponsorship seen in recent auctions has come despite a dramatic repricing in yields, and we have seen several stop-throughs at record low yields, even with record auction sizes. BMO thinks this is an encouraging sign that the supply can be absorbed with little concession, and it does not expect the broader 0.54-0.78% 10-year Treasury yield range will be challenged as a result of this week’s supply. It does, however, think there is a risk the high-yield could stop-out above 0.70%.</p><p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTIONS RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 0.782%, six-auction avg. 1.462%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 0.7bps, six-auction avg. -0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.43x, six-auction avg. 2.46x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 27.6%, six-auction avg. 26.3%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 13.2%, six-auction avg. 14.2%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 59.2%, six-auction avg. 59.6%)</li></ul><h2><strong>CRUDE</strong></h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLES USD 0.60 LOWER AT USD 24.14; WTI (N0) SETTLES USD 1.09 LOWER AT USD 25.08; BRENT (N0) SETTLES USD 1.34 LOWER AT USD 29.63/BBL</strong></p><p>Oil prices settled lower to start the week after paring gains from reports of additional OPEC cuts. The crude oil futures had already been trundling lower into the European session as equity futures reversed gains after the Globex open on Sunday. However, oil prices jumped higher after the tape was hit with reports that Saudi Aramco was to take an additional 1mln BPD cut in June from its April levels, in addition to the recent OPEC+ agreement. Saudi noted the additional cuts were being made to expedite the rebalancing of the oil market. The Kingdom also said it had directed Aramco to seek to make additional cuts in May too. Following the announcement, Kuwait announced it is to cut its output by an additional 80k BPD in June; UAE Energy Minister said the country would take an additional 100k BPD cut in June. While the announcements saw futures move into the green, they ultimately faded back into negative territory as the Europeans wrapped up for the day. Citi’s energy analysts interpreted the reversal as a suggestion that the cuts were more defensive than the Saudi commenting about “getting ahead of the curve” would suggest. Perhaps it is telling that oil futures failed to benefit in the revived appetite for equities after the US cash equity open, although one could argue that today’s rally was that of a momentum/defensive nature, with value/cyclical sectors the underperformers, thus limiting energy demand too.</p><h2><strong>EQUITIES</strong></h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.01% at 2930, NDQ +0.85% at 9299, DJIA -0.45% at 24,222.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Health Care +1.7%, IT +0.7%, Communications +0.7%, Discretionary +0.1%, Staples -0.2%, Utilities -0.5%, Real Estate -1.2%, Industrials -1.25%, Materials -1.5%, Energy -1.7%, Financials -1.9%</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Momentum/defensive names performed well today with MTUM +1.7%, while technology outperformed with the software focused ETF (FDN) reaching all-time highs; NDQ outperformed the SPX and DJIA. On Wednesday, Cisco (CSCO) report its figures, with analysts paying close attention to the results given its usefulness as a current barometer for the wider tech sector. Apple (AAPL) is in talks with Indian government officials to move up to USD 40bln of production to India from China, according to The Economic Times. President Trump’s administration and semiconductor companies are reportedly looking to start the development of new chip factories in the US amid concerns about reliance on Asia for technology, according to WSJ. Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 China Sales -64% M/M in April. CEO Musk announced the Co is to leave California immediately after regulations stopped Tesla from restarting production at its Fremont factory, although Verge later reported it has already begun manufacturing vehicles at its Fremont factory. AbbVie (ABBV) completed its purchase of Allergan (AGN). Coty (COTY) agreed to sell its majority stake in its Wella, Clairol, OPI and GHD brands to KKR (KKR) in a USD 4.3bln deal. AMC Entertainment (AMC) reportedly held talks with Amazon (AMZN) regarding a potential takeover, according to the Daily Mail citing sources, although later reports denied that talks had taken place.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Marriott (MAR) missed on EPS although beat on revenue while noting trends in Greater China are continuing to improve, adding it saw a marginal uptick in US occupancy over the past few weeks. Under Armour (UAA) missed on EPS and revenue, while announcing its quarterly restructuring and impairment chargers were USD 466mln. Cardinal Health (CAH) beat on EPS and revenue, while reaffirmed its FY20 guidance. ON Semiconductor (ON) missed on EPS and revenue, while guidance also fell short of expectations.</p><h2><strong>EUROPE</strong></h2><p><strong>GERMAN COURT RULING: </strong>Over the weekend, European Commission (EC) President Von der Leyen floated the possibility of legal action against the German Constitutional Court (GCC) - following the latter’s ruling that the ECB’s Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP) did not respect the “principle of proportionality”, suggesting the ECB went beyond its mandate – thus violating German law. Click here for <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-european-commission-threatens-to-sue-germany-s-top-court-11-05-2020\">full analysis</a>.</p><h2><strong>FX WRAP</strong></h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> The DXY reclaimed 100 to the upside in a solid day of gains amid risk-averse morning trade, with equities opening in the red while haven sectors outperformed. A similar view was seen in FX with USD bid and cyclicals underperforming, although typical havens JPY/XAU/CHF were weaker against a rising dollar.</p><p><strong>CNY:</strong> US/China reaffirmation of Phase One obligations has eased market concerns in the short-run, but are unlikely to end tensions given US elections in November, difficulties China might have in meeting its USD 200bln purchase agreement; that has evidently been seen in some of the punchy US/China trade headlines crossing the tape today, and while they did not result in distinct risk-off, they did inject a slight negative bias. Last week, Trump said he'd address the progress of Phase One within a week or two. GS explains that rising tensions can impact the yuan via reduced cross-border M&amp;A and portfolio flows, or lower exporter FX conversion. GS advises clients to consider adding hedges for these risks via long USDCNH or long USD/other regional FX.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The Yen was weaker against the buck with USDJPY reclaiming 107.00 and extending to highs of 107.72 at highs. Japan returned from Golden Week at the tail end of last week, although desks had anticipated a complete return would not be seen until the start of this week, which could have played into today’s price action, with USDJPY up over 1%, a move not seen since the end of March. Japanese PM Abe said the government was ready to add further stimulus if required, while it is also expected to lift its national state of emergency across parts of Japan. HSBC notes that these stories boosted local stocks thus the inverse relationship with the Nikkei could be explaining JPY weakness.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency was hit today with EURUSD finding support at 1.08 after EC President Von Der Leyen raised the idea of legal action against the German Constitutional Court (GCC) after it ruled the ECB’s PSPP did not respect the “principle of proportionality” which although is in favour of the ECB, it highlights disputes among Eurozone groups.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> UK PM Johnson announced the base line of the economic reopening in phases and announced that those who cannot work from home should be encouraged to return to work, while schools will start with the younger pupils first. ING writes that the speech had a muted impact as markets focus on the lack of clarity rather than the re-opening plan; the bank expects Cable to trade between 1.2240-1.2520 this week. Brexit talks are also set to get underway again, with latest reports suggesting the UK are to tell the EU a new fisheries agreement cannot be part of the free trade agreement.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (GBP, AUD, NZD):</strong> Cyclicals were hit amid bouts of risk-off, although cyclicals are off lows as equities reversed losses and entered positive territory, while the haven bid for USD continued to weigh elsewhere.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX (CAD, RUB, MXN): </strong>All weaker against a firmer dollar today with oil prices initially trading in negative territory although all currency pairs are trading off highs against the buck as crude prices staged a short-lived early rebound spurred by Saudi Arabia instructing Saudi Aramco to cut an additional 1mln BPD on top of the OPEC+ deal. On CAD, Scotiabank writes “we still think USDCAD is stuck in a broad range around the 1.40 area but feel the generally positive backdrop for risk assets suggests some modest upside scope for the CAD”. Elsewhere for RUB, FT reported its own analysis which stated the official COVID-19 death count in Russia could be 70% higher than the official reported figure.</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>The majority of EMFX saw weakness today despite the turnaround in equities during US trade, albeit it did help the currencies of their lows. TRY however was the outlier, it was actually firmer on the day as it managed to sustain its recovery on Friday. MXN and BRL were the underperformers with MXN weighed on by lower crude prices.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The TPLEX sold off on Monday amid a chunky supply pipeline and strength in equities. Yields had been heading modestly lower in European trade as equity futures reversed their strength set at the open on Sunday, however, a pick-up in equities, led by the NQ, saw duration come under pressure. Furthermore, participants had, and still have, a slew of supply to digest this week, where the US sold USD 42bln of three-year notes as part of its refunding today (stopped through the 0.233% WI by 0.3bps, covered 2.54x and Dealers took 32.59%). At the same time, the Dollar corporate issuance continued to churn post Q1 earnings, with today’s big deals pricing include Disney’s USD 11bln six-trancher and PayPal’s USD 4bln four-trancher. By settlement, yields were up between 3-6bps (3 on the short-end, 6 on the long-end) and the curve had bear-steepened.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES: </strong>Fed Funds futures unwound some of its recent strength today, away from NIRP. FF futures as early as Jan 2021 had moved above par at the end of last week, although today they have receded back below par, with the nearest contract above now being April 2021. Several desks have written recently that they view the move above par as that of a technical nature (e.g. short squeeze), rather than the market outright assuming the Fed will move into NIRP. BMO’s analysts noted that as long as the Fed does not completely rule out negative rates, we will continue to see parts of the funding markets move into NIRP, as participants essentially hedge the possibility of the Fed going negative, even if the probability is low. Ahead of Fed chair Powell’s speech on Wednesday, where he is expected to address the issue, Evans (non-voter) today said says he doesn't anticipate negative rates would be used, and Bostic (non-voter) said he's not a big fan of the policy and considers it among the weaker tools – note that they did not outright rule out the policy.</p><p><strong>TACTICAL BIAS: </strong>Fed guidance on rates (staying at these low levels for the foreseeable), buying concentrated in the belly, and the possibility of yield curve control (YCC) is outweighing the flood of bill supply in the short-end of the curve, TD Securities argues, keeping rates anchored at low levels. Meanwhile, the long-end of the curve is under pressure as a result of rising Treasury supply. This should give the curve a steeper bias.</p><p><strong>THIS WEEK’S SUPPLY: </strong>The Treasury will auction USD 42bln 3-year notes (Mon), USD 32bln 10-year notes (Tue), and USD 22bln 30-year bonds (Wed). This week's auction will be revealing, given the Treasury's boosted refunding announcement last week. UBS notes that this week, around USD 86bln cash will fall due, including around USD 58bln of redemptions and USD 29bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>PREVIEW - 10-YEAR AUCTION: </strong>There is still demand for 10-year even at slightly higher yields than present, analysts say, citing price action after Wednesday’s Treasury refunding announcement when 10-year yields closed 3-4bps higher, but rallied on Thursday back to within the 0.60-65% range (and respected the 0.78% top-end of its broader range). BMO argues, and that the liquidity advantages of Treasury auctions will continue to bring in buyers, and notes that sponsorship seen in recent auctions has come despite a dramatic repricing in yields, and we have seen several stop-throughs at record low yields, even with record auction sizes. BMO thinks this is an encouraging sign that the supply can be absorbed with little concession, and it does not expect the broader 0.54-0.78% 10-year Treasury yield range will be challenged as a result of this week’s supply. It does, however, think there is a risk the high-yield could stop-out above 0.70%.</p><p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTIONS RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 0.782%, six-auction avg. 1.462%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 0.7bps, six-auction avg. -0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.43x, six-auction avg. 2.46x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 27.6%, six-auction avg. 26.3%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 13.2%, six-auction avg. 14.2%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 59.2%, six-auction avg. 59.6%)</li></ul>",

The crude oil futures had already been trundling lower into the European session as equity futures reversed gains after the Globex open on Sunday. However, oil prices jumped higher after the tape was hit with reports that Saudi Aramco was to take an additional 1mln BPD cut in June from its April levels, in addition to the recent OPEC+ agreement. Saudi noted the additional cuts were being made to expedite the rebalancing of the oil market. The Kingdom also said it had directed Aramco to seek to make additional cuts in May too. Following the announcement, Kuwait announced it is to cut its output by an additional 80k BPD in June; UAE Energy Minister said the country would take an additional 100k BPD cut in June. While the announcements saw futures move into the green, they ultimately faded back into negative territory as the Europeans wrapped up for the day. Citi’s energy analysts interpreted the reversal as a suggestion that the cuts were more defensive than the Saudi commenting about “getting ahead of the curve” would suggest. Perhaps it is telling that oil futures failed to benefit in the revived appetite for equities after the US cash equity open, although one could argue that today’s rally was that of a momentum/defensive nature, with value/cyclical sectors the underperformers, thus limiting energy demand too.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD</strong>: The DXY reclaimed 100 to the upside in a solid day of gains amid risk averse morning trade, with equities opening in the red while haven sectors outperformed. A similar view was seen in FX with USD bid and cyclicals underperforming, although typical havens JPY/XAU/CHF were weaker against a rising dollar.</p><p><strong>CNY:</strong> US/China reaffirmation of Phase One obligations has eased market concerns in the short-run, but are unlikely to end tensions given US elections in November, difficulties China might have in meeting its USD 200bln purchase agreement; that has evidently been seen in some of the punchy US/China trade headlines crossing the tape today, and while they did not result in distinct risk-off, they did inject a slight negative bias. Last week, Trump said he'd address the progress of Phase One within a week or two. GS explains that rising tensions can impact the yuan via reduced cross-border M&amp;A and portfolio flows, or lower exporter FX conversion. GS advises clients to consider adding hedges for these risks via long USDCNH or long USD/other regional FX.</p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>The Yen was weaker against the buck with USDJPY reclaiming 107.00 and extending to highs of 107.72 at highs. Japan returned from Golden Week at the tail end of last week, although desks had anticipated a complete return would not be seen until the start of this week, which could have played into today’s price action, with USDJPY up over 1%, a move not seen since the end of March. Japanese PM Abe said the government was ready to add further stimulus if required, while it is also expected to lift its national state of emergency across parts of Japan. HSBC notes that these stories boosted local stocks thus the inverse relationship with the Nikkei could be explaining JPY weakness.</p><p><strong>EUR: </strong>The single currency was hit today with EURUSD finding support at 1.08 after EC President Von Der Leyen raised the idea of legal action against the German Constitutional Court (GCC) after it ruled the ECB’s PSPP did not respect the “principle of proportionality” which although is in favour of the ECB, it highlights disputes among Eurozone groups.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> UK PM Johnson announced the base line of the economic reopening in phases and announced that those who cannot work from home should be encouraged to return to work, while schools will start with the younger pupils first. ING writes that the speech had a muted impact as markets focus on the lack of clarity rather than the re-opening plan; the bank expects Cable to trade between 1.2240-1.2520 this week. Brexit talks are also set to get underway again, with latest reports suggesting the UK are to tell the EU a new fisheries agreement cannot be part of the free trade agreement.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS (GBP, AUD, NZD):</strong> Cyclicals were hit amid bouts of risk-off, although cyclicals are off lows as equities reversed losses and entered positive territory, while the haven bid for USD continued to weigh elsewhere.</p><p><strong>COMMODITY FX (CAD, RUB, MXN):</strong> All weaker against a firmer dollar today with oil prices initially trading in negative territory although all currency pairs are trading off highs against the buck as crude prices staged a short lived early rebound spurred by Saudi Arabia instructing Saudi Aramco to cut an additional 1mln BPD on top of the OPEC+ deal. On CAD, Scotiabank writes “we still think USDCAD is stuck in a broad range around the 1.40 area but feel the generally positive backdrop for risk assets suggests some modest upside scope for the CAD”. Elsewhere for RUB, FT reported its own analysis which stated the official COVID-19 death count in Russia could be 70% higher than the official reported figure.</p><p><strong>EMFX: </strong>The majority of EMFX saw weakness today despite the turnaround in equities during US trade, albeit it did help the currencies of their lows. TRY however was the outlier, it was actually firmer on the day as it managed to sustain its recovery on Friday. MXN and BRL were the underperformers with MXN weighed on by lower crude prices.</p>",

Officials are angered over US President Trump’s “cover up” of his handling of the pandemic – thus advisers have been floating the possibility of voiding the trade pact and renegotiating one skewed more towards China’s interests. Another official, citing US’ staggering economy and the Presidential Election, said \"It's in fact in China's interests to terminate the current phase one deal. It is beneficial to us. The US now cannot afford to restart the trade war with China”. That being said, analysts believe China will only terminate the agreement as a “last option”.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>A solid start to the week for the Dollar amidst renewed risk aversion and jitters related to the coronavirus as global economies re-emerge from lockdown. Meanwhile, reports in the Global Times suggest that some Chinese officials want to terminate the Phase one trade agreement with the US and renegotiate the terms even though last week’s call between top representatives from both sides was described as constructive and the US is said to have acknowledged that China is largely honouring pledges on structural issues. However, the Buck is outperforming all G10 rivals including the ‘safe-haven’ Yen as the front end of the curve pushes back further on sub-zero rate bets ahead of Wednesday’s speech from Fed chair Powell conscious of the fact that he has played down the prospect of NIRP in the recent past.</p><p><strong>JPY/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Yen and Kiwi have been propping up the major table for the most part, with Usd/Jpy clearing 107.00 and April 30’s peak at 107.50 on the way to circa 107.67 against the backdrop of UST curve re-steepening into supply and more reports about a second Japanese supplementary budget. The headline pair continues to trade out of kilter with broad sentiment having extended its post-Golden Week rebound from a double base around 105.99, and technically on track for a more pronounced bounce if it closes above the 21 DMA (107.16). Elsewhere, the Kiwi has now lost grip of the 0.6100 handle in advance of Wednesday’s RNBZ when asset purchases are widely expected to be increased and the Aussie is labouring awaiting jobs data on the following day after relinquishing 0.6500+ status and weakening more than the <strong>YUAN </strong>relative to the Greenback in wake of the PBoC’s slightly softer Usd/Cny midpoint fixing and pledge to use stronger policies allied to counter-cyclical measures in support of the economy.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP/SEK</strong></p><p>The Loonie got a fleeting fillip from a rebound in oil, like the <strong>NOK, RUB</strong> and <strong>MXN </strong>when Saud Arabia instructed Aramco to cut crude output by 1 mn bpd more than agreed under the OPEC+ pact, but was ultimately undermined by the risk-off mood not to mention crude prices subsequently fading after token overcompliance from Kuwait and the UAE (80k and 100k respectively vs -2 mn in total pledged by the 3 producers in April). Usd/Cad is now nearer 1.4000 than 1.3900, Eur/Nok close to 11.1400 vs just shy of 11.0200 after significantly stronger than expected Norwegian headline and core CPI, Usd/Rub midway from 73.1350 to 73.9700 and Usd/Mxn towards the upper end of a 23.5520-23.9700 band. Meanwhile, Sterling has been its usual volatile self in Cable and Eur/Gbp cross terms, but mostly weaker before the 3rd round of Brexit trade negotiations and rather unimpressed with UK PM Johnson’s calibrated approach to ending lockdown with the former whipping from 1.2437 to 1.2285 and latter between 0.8805-0.8714 parameters. Conversely, the Swedish Krona never really recovered after failing to rally through 10.5700 and the Riksbank minutes revealed what appeared to be more than just a token statement to the effect that the benchmark repo can go lower.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>Relatively resilient until a late EU wave of pressure pushed the single currency closer to 1.0800 and Franc back down to the base of a 0.9701-36 corridor, but Eur/Usd held above the round number following mixed COVID-19 updates from the Eurozone, while Eur/Chf did not pay full attention to latest rises in Swiss bank sight deposit balances or comments from SNB chair Jordan explaining that it is committee to intervention and ZIRP as a means to curbing the Franc’s strength.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Try managed to sustain its recovery momentum, albeit with volumes impaired by high volatility after Turkey’s banking regulator banned 3 foreign banks from trading, but the Czk declined amidst dovish remarks from CNB’s Holub outlining various options for stimulus if benchmark rates reach the lower bound, including QE, FX management and NIRP, though the latter would be a last resort.</p>",

Desks have noted that as we await new significant catalysts and headlines are thin, technical, flow-driven trade may influence price action, which appears to be what we are seeing in the pre-market; we did however get some punchy rhetoric <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-hawkish-china-voices-call-for-termination-of-us-phase-one-deal-11-05-2020\">out of China</a> that may have resulted in caution.

The former is also supported by gains in Cardinal Health (CAH) after earnings. Losses today are led by Materials, Financials and Energy, with the latter failing to benefit on the rebound in prices after Saudi Arabia announced it would cut an additional 1mln BPD on top of the OPEC+ deal.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Marriott (MAR) missed on EPS although beat on revenue while noting trends in Greater China are continuing to improve, adding it saw a marginal uptick in US occupancy over the past few weeks. Under Armour (UAA) missed on EPS and revenue, while announcing its quarterly restructuring and impairment chargers were USD 466mln. Cardinal Health (CAH) beat on EPS and revenue, while reaffirmed its FY20 guidance. ON Semiconductor (ON) missed on EPS and revenue, while guidance also fell short of expectations.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 China Sales -64% M/M in April. CEO Musk announced the Co is to leave California immediately after regulations stopped Tesla from restarting production at its Fremont factory. AbbVie (ABBV) completed its purchase of Allergan (AGN). Coty (COTY) agreed to sell its majority stake in its Wella, Clairol, OPI and GHD brands to KKR (KKR) in a USD 4.3bln deal. AMC Entertainment (AMC) reportedly held talks with Amazon (AMZN) regarding a potential takeover, according to the Daily Mail citing sources.</p><p><strong>KEY ES LEVELS: </strong>ES has this morning fallen beneath the key 2,925-35 range (fibs, valuation); upside break brings 2,965 (Apr hi) into focus, then 3,000 (200dma, psych); downside eyes 2,890-2,900 (valuation, psych) then 2,871 (8dma). (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/price-action-emini-s-p-500-es-falling-towards-2-900-giving-up-early-gains-technical-flow-driven-trade-likely-to-be-seen-analysts-say-11-05-2020\">Here </a>for more)</p><p><strong>VIX TERM STRUCTURE IN CONTANGO:</strong> Nomura’s quant desk suggests that some specs have gone back to building shorts in VIX, and the bank argues that derivative markets are thus giving evidence of a flow of impatiently optimistic trades that assume that the VIX will stabilize further. Nomura, composition of the rally on Friday, notes that fundamentally focussed global macro hedge funds contributed to the trend-chasing CTA’s action, though the bank warns this may be short-lived. However, Nomura argues that global macro hedge funds were expected a double-dip in developed equity markets, and they are now being forced into relenting by buying equities to cover shorts as there have been a smaller number of negative economic surprises. According to the bank, CTAs are now sidelining themselves in both stocks and bonds (may see profit-taking above 0.70% 10-year yields). “With global macro hedge funds and other investors buying equities to close out shorts, share prices have been making gains beyond what technical forecasts had pictured. Price movements this week may determine whether CTAs resume buying equity futures in a way that marks a break from the median trajectory observed during previous periods of accumulation, however, relative to economic fundamentals, the recent stock market gains are substantial enough that most of the potential for a rebound in equities has arguably already been used up.” The bank adds that any further accumulation of long positions in equity futures by CTAs could leave them taking on undue momentum risk.”</p><p><strong>WHY THIS EQUITY RALLY IS UNLOVED: </strong>Three drivers of the current rally: slowdown in the rate of new virus infections, Fed policy actions, CARES Act (and expectations of a fourth round of stimulus. But investors appear not to love the rally. According to Goldman Sachs, 60% of mutual funds lagged their benchmark during the rally from March lows, long/short and macro hedge funds returned 8% and 1% respectively, vs SPX +31%. Some CIOs, meanwhile, have raised eyebrows at the speed of the rebounded, current stretched valuations (SPX trading with P/E of ~20 x its eps estimate), and question the potential for forward returns (170 EPS based on H2 recovery). GS suggests that one reason for the distrust in momentum may be the narrow breadth of the rally; the five largest SPX stocks account for 21% of its capitalisation, and while those big five are all up YTD, the SPX is negative. Additionally, while the SPX is 13% beneath its February all-time high, the median stock is 23% under its peak. Accordingly, GS warns of potential downside in the short-term, though suggests that it might not be a single catalyst that sparks a pullback, including 1) COVID infection rates outside of NY continue to rise, and may accelerate as lockdowns are lifted; 2) the restart process will take time; 3) bank loan loss reserves were built in Q1 based on a jobless rate of around 10% - that rate rose to 14.7% in April, and GS forecasts loan loss provisions will need to rise to USD 115bln in the next four quarters (versus total of USD 46bln in Q1); this may weigh on share repurchase/buybacks plans, shaking a key pillar of support that equities have enjoyed in the last decade; 4) dividends are at risk, and are seen falling further this year, as too are capex plans; 5) tax policy risk around elections; tax reforms in 2017 lowered corporation tax to 18% from 26%, and may become a political issue; 6) US/China risks, a headwind in 2019, are resurfacing.</p><p><strong>EQUITY RISK PREMIA:</strong> JPM is not surprised that equities are rallying while economic data points paint a grim picture. JPM still sees S&amp;P 500 of recovering its losses and reaching 3,400 (new highs) in H1 2021. JPM argues that even if a second wave of outbreaks were to occur, the Fed has explicitly indicated that there is no dollar limit and no danger of running out of ammunition. Monetary policy (rates cuts, credit spread compression) and fiscal support (direct payments) have put a floor under stocks. JPM says this stimulus and liquidity will outlast the health crisis, and equity risk premia is attractive (most attractive for Nasdaq, Secular Growth and Sustainable Income stocks over the medium-to-long term). The bank notes that historically equity risk premia tend to compress after the introduction of QE, rising free liquidity ratios, negative real rates and tightening credit spreads. It calculates equity risk premia for the S&amp;P 500 is around 9.4% versus the long-term average of 5.7%. This is supported by historically low rates, negative real rates, and cheap credit. “These are powerful tailwinds for equity multiples, in our view, especially in the US which is the home of a large number of Sustainable Income and Long Duration stocks,” JPMorgan writes, “a comparison of current equity multiple to its history may not fully appreciate the benefit of low nominal and negative real rates for valuation.”</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES: </strong>Fed Funds futures for the turn of the year rose above par last week, signalling a probability above zero that the Fed could lower rates into negative territory next year. The moves above par were modest, and pared back at the end of the week (Nov 2020 FF was above par early Friday, but only the Feb 2021 contract closed out the week at/above par). Goldman Sachs is surprised by market's implying negative yields (even if modest) given that Fed speakers have generally been averse to such moves. GS says that, while it is hard to rule out, the pricing in seems a bit aggressive given current expectations for the economy, and even if the Fed were to explore negative rates, it would likely be reluctant to go deep, given political issues with penalising cash. Other think the pricing of negative rates might be more technical in nature. Fed chief Powell is due to speak on Wednesday, and the theme will be monitored, particularly by equity investors, given the upside seen last week after the Fed Funds futures rose above par.&nbsp;</p>",

Follows on from S&amp;P maintain their rating for Italy at BBB a few weeks ago as well. Much attention has been on the rating of Italy, given the extent to which it has been impacted by COVID-19 and the significant stimulus measures they have had to take to counter this. Following the ECB’s ‘Fallen Angels’ announcement a few weeks ago, reports have since noted the ECB has begun looking into the purchases of junk corporate debt (similar to the Fed); which, again, is potentially particularly of note for Italy as the very real prospect of it being cut to Junk rating would likely see a number of Italian companies fall as well.</li><li>Until this week, PEPP has continued to trend around the EUR 20bln mark, and has remained relatively consistent around this figure; differing notably from the substantial swings seen in the APP operations recently – perhaps indicating the ECB is being to favour conducting its policy via this mechanism. This weeks substantial increase of EUR +34.097bln (Prev. +22.092bln), which equates to +54.34% (Prev. +10.17%) appears to chime with this narrative; however, it is perhaps too early to say for sure as the programme still has some way to run with only EUR 152.907bln of the EUR 750bln currently allotted purchases thus far. As a reminder COVID-19 related policies (PEPP and PELTROs so far) were exempt from the GCC ruling on proportionality last week.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: Further hawkish voices have emerged from China calling for a re-negotiation of the Phase One deal, according to sources cited by Global Times. The piece notes of Chinese dissatisfaction amid compromises the side made to press ahead with Phase One. Officials are angered over US President Trump’s “cover up” of his handling of the pandemic – thus advisers have been floating the possibility of voiding the trade pact and renegotiating one skewed more towards China’s interests. Another official, citing US’ staggering economy and the Presidential Election, said \"It's in fact in China's interests to terminate the current phase one deal. It is beneficial to us. The US now cannot afford to restart the trade war with China”. That being said, analysts believe China will only terminate the agreement as a “last option”.</p><p><strong>US-CHINA PHONE CALL:</strong> Over the weekend, US source familiar with recent discussions stated US officials acknowledged China was largely delivering its pledges on structural issues such as opening market access and improving IP protection but they have yet to agree in some details including IP action plan and easing equity caps for foreign investors. Furthermore, the source stated fallout from the virus meant agreement on purchasing US goods has become much more important and that many believe China needs to increase pace on purchases, <strong>while reports also noted that a Chinese government adviser suggested the deal itself was fragile.</strong></p><p><strong>US VISA RESTRICTIONS: </strong>Sentiment deteriorated from another angle after the Trump administration imposed a 90-day on Chinese jounalists' work visas vs. the previous open-ended stay granted to most journalists with Chinese passports. &nbsp;Chinese Foreign Ministry urged US to immediately correct its mistakes regarding new US visa rule for Chinese journalist, otherwise China will have to take countermeasures.</p><p><strong>RECENT RHETORIC:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>US</strong>: US President Trump recently threatened to terminate the deal with China should it not adhere to its commitments under the Phase One deal. Furthermore, the US President floated the idea of tariffs as a potential punishment for China’s handling of the pandemic. Trump has blamed China for playing down the scale and risks of the virus – a move believed to be correlated to the US Presidential Election.</li><li><strong>CHINA:</strong> China has blamed US officials for attempting to shift their “poor handling” of the pandemic. Analysts via SCMP noted that China can retaliate by dumping its US Treasury holdings whilst imposing tariffs of their own, albeit Chinese officials yesterday noted that tariffs should not be used as a weapon. Meanwhile, underlying soured sentiment remains on the Hong Kong front – Chinese Foreign Ministry said it opposes US interference on China's affairs with Hong Kong.</li></ul><p><strong>TRADE DATA:</strong> The Chinese trade data for April printed a substantially larger than the expected surplus in CNY and USD terms as the nation resurfaces from lockdown. However, China's trade with the US continued to decline from January to April, the total value of China-US trade dropped 12.8% whilst China's imports from the US slid 3% and exports plunged 15.9%, according to Global Time</p>",

Nomura, composition of the rally on Friday, notes that fundamentally focussed global macro hedge funds contributed to the trend-chasing CTA’s action, though the bank warns this may be short-lived. However, Nomura argues that global macro hedge funds were expected a double-dip in developed equity markets, and they are now being forced into relenting by buying equities to cover shorts as there have been a smaller number of negative economic surprises. According to the bank, CTAs are now sidelining themselves in both stocks and bonds (may see profit-taking above 0.70% 10-year yields). “With global macro hedge funds and other investors buying equities to close out shorts, share prices have been making gains beyond what technical forecasts had pictured. Price movements this week may determine whether CTAs resume buying equity futures in a way that marks a break from the median trajectory observed during previous periods of accumulation, however, relative to economic fundamentals, the recent stock market gains are substantial enough that most of the potential for a rebound in equities has arguably already been used up.” The bank adds that any further accumulation of long positions in equity futures by CTAs could leave them taking on undue momentum risk.”</p><p><strong>WHY THIS EQUITY RALLY IS UNLOVED: </strong>Three drivers of the current rally: slowdown in the rate of new virus infections, Fed policy actions, CARES Act (and expectations of a fourth round of stimulus. But investors appear not to love the rally. According to Goldman Sachs, 60% of mutual funds lagged their benchmark during the rally from March lows, long/short and macro hedge funds returned 8% and 1% respectively, vs SPX +31%. Some CIOs, meanwhile, have raised eyebrows at the speed of the rebounded, current stretched valuations (SPX trading with P/E of ~20 x its eps estimate), and question the potential for forward returns (170 EPS based on H2 recovery). GS suggests that one reason for the distrust in momentum may be the narrow breadth of the rally; the five largest SPX stocks account for 21% of its capitalisation, and while those big five are all up YTD, the SPX is negative. Additionally, while the SPX is 13% beneath its February all-time high, the median stock is 23% under its peak. Accordingly, GS warns of potential downside in the short-term, though suggests that it might not be a single catalyst that sparks a pullback, including 1) COVID infection rates outside of NY continue to rise, and may accelerate as lockdowns are lifted; 2) the restart process will take time; 3) bank loan loss reserves were built in Q1 based on a jobless rate of around 10% - that rate rose to 14.7% in April, and GS forecasts loan loss provisions will need to rise to USD 115bln in the next four quarters (versus total of USD 46bln in Q1); this may weigh on share repurchase/buybacks plans, shaking a key pillar of support that equities have enjoyed in the last decade; 4) dividends are at risk, and are seen falling further this year, as too are capex plans; 5) tax policy risk around elections; tax reforms in 2017 lowered corporation tax to 18% from 26%, and may become a political issue; 6) US/China risks, a headwind in 2019, are resurfacing.</p><p><strong>EQUITY RISK PREMIA:</strong> JPM is not surprised that equities are rallying while economic data points paint a grim picture. JPM still sees S&amp;P 500 of recovering its losses and reaching 3,400 (new highs) in H1 2021. JPM argues that even if a second wave of outbreaks were to occur, the Fed has explicitly indicated that there is no dollar limit and no danger of running out of ammunition. Monetary policy (rates cuts, credit spread compression) and fiscal support (direct payments) have put a floor under stocks. JPM says this stimulus and liquidity will outlast the health crisis, and equity risk premia is attractive (most attractive for Nasdaq, Secular Growth and Sustainable Income stocks over the medium-to-long term). The bank notes that historically equity risk premia tend to compress after the introduction of QE, rising free liquidity ratios, negative real rates and tightening credit spreads. It calculates equity risk premia for the S&amp;P 500 is around 9.4% versus the long-term average of 5.7%. This is supported by historically low rates, negative real rates, and cheap credit. “These are powerful tailwinds for equity multiples, in our view, especially in the US which is the home of a large number of Sustainable Income and Long Duration stocks,” JPMorgan writes, “a comparison of current equity multiple to its history may not fully appreciate the benefit of low nominal and negative real rates for valuation.”</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES: </strong>Fed Funds futures for the turn of the year rose above par last week, signalling a probability above zero that the Fed could lower rates into negative territory next year. The moves above par were modest, and pared back at the end of the week (Nov 2020 FF was above par early Friday, but only the Feb 2021 contract closed out the week at/above par). Goldman Sachs is surprised by market's implying negative yields (even if modest) given that Fed speakers have generally been averse to such moves. GS says that, while it is hard to rule out, the pricing in seems a bit aggressive given current expectations for the economy, and even if the Fed were to explore negative rates, it would likely be reluctant to go deep, given political issues with penalising cash. Other think the pricing of negative rates might be more technical in nature. Fed chief Powell is due to speak on Wednesday, and the theme will be monitored, particularly by equity investors, given the upside seen last week after the Fed Funds futures rose above par.&nbsp;</p>",

Monetary policy (rates cuts, credit spread compression) and fiscal support (direct payments) have put a floor under stocks. JPM says this stimulus and liquidity will outlast the health crisis, and equity risk premia is attractive (most attractive for Nasdaq, Secular Growth and Sustainable Income stocks over the medium-to-long term). The bank notes that historically equity risk premia tend to compress after the introduction of QE, rising free liquidity ratios, negative real rates and tightening credit spreads. It calculates equity risk premia for the S&amp;P 500 is around 9.4% versus the long-term average of 5.7%. This is supported by historically low rates, negative real rates, and cheap credit. “These are powerful tailwinds for equity multiples, in our view, especially in the US which is the home of a large number of Sustainable Income and Long Duration stocks,” JPMorgan writes, “a comparison of current equity multiple to its history may not fully appreciate the benefit of low nominal and negative real rates for valuation.”</p><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES: </strong>Fed Funds futures for the turn of the year rose above par last week, signalling a probability above zero that the Fed could lower rates into negative territory next year. The moves above par were modest, and pared back at the end of the week (Nov 2020 FF was above par early Friday, but only the Feb 2021 contract closed out the week at/above par). Goldman Sachs is surprised by market's implying negative yields (even if modest) given that Fed speakers have generally been averse to such moves. GS says that, while it is hard to rule out, the pricing in seems a bit aggressive given current expectations for the economy, and even if the Fed were to explore negative rates, it would likely be reluctant to go deep, given political issues with penalising cash. Other think the pricing of negative rates might be more technical in nature. Fed chief Powell is due to speak on Wednesday, and the theme will be monitored, particularly by equity investors, given the upside seen last week after the Fed Funds futures rose above par.&nbsp;</p>",

The core 10 year benchmarks may have found underlying bids ahead of round numbers below and the former ahead of technical support in the form of a rising trend-line at 173.16, but the bearish tone and current selling in to upticks suggests caution if not concession for impending supply as fiscal and funding factors override stimulus and back-stops provided by global Central Bank QE, while the front end of the US curve normalises. Ahead, US employment trends and more CB speakers.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>Risk sentiment has soured in early EU trade, but Usd/Jpy has breached resistance at the psychological 107.00 level that kept the headline pair in check during the Asia-Pac session amidst broad strength in Yen crosses and to the benefit of the Dollar in general. Indeed, the <strong>DXY</strong> edged just above 100.000 at best after stalling on Friday post-NFP, with the index also acknowledging a rebound in US Treasury yields alongside curve re-steepening as FFFs unwind negative pricing from end 2020 contracts to April next year at the earliest. Back to the Jpy, latest reports about another supplementary budget follow the BoJ’s April Summary of Opinions noting further room for coordinated fiscal and monetary policy stimulus as Japan remains at risk of deflation, and Usd/Jpy has consolidated about the 21 DMA (107.16).</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi is treading cautiously into the RBNZ policy meeting that is expected to see QE boosted even though NZ is preparing to scale down its lockdown status by Thursday and continue to reopen the economy, while ANZ business sentiment and the activity outlook both improved somewhat per preliminary survey readings for May. However, Nzd/Usd is testing 0.6100 from 0.6150+ at one stage overnight and the Aud/Nzd cross has bounced firmly between 1.0612-78 parameters as the Aussie derives some underlying traction from PBoC guidance pointing at stronger measures to support the Chinese economy including stepping up counter-cyclical adjustments. Nevertheless, Aud/Usd has also pulled back from best levels towards 0.6500 awaiting this week’s jobs data.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/CHF/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All conceding ground to the Greenback, with the single currency unable to clear 1.0850 and subsequently drifting back down to the low 1.0800 area, but perhaps cushioned by decent option expiry interest from 1.0810-00 ahead of the NY cut, while Cable has been unable to maintain 1.2400+ status again before the resumption of UK-EU trade talks and with little support from PM Johnson’s 3-point plan to remove COVID-19 restrictions. Elsewhere, the Franc has retreated from circa 0.9700 after commentary from SNB chief Jordan confirming that intervention has increased to curb Chf appreciation and backed up by increases in weekly sight deposits, and the Loonie has reversed from around 1.3900 alongside crude prices after outperforming its US counterpart in wake of last Friday’s Canadian-US employment report face-off.</p><p><strong>SCANDI</strong></p><p>Rather mixed starts to the new week for the Norwegian Krona and its Swedish peer as the former revisited support in Eur/Nok ahead of 11.0000 on the back of significantly firmer than forecast inflation metrics, but the latter bounced from near 10.5700 to 10.6100+ following Riksbank minutes that appear less intransigent on the subject of lowering the repo rate, if required, while maintaining that QE can be scaled up further if necessary.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Far from out of the woods, but the Lira has managed a feat of sorts with its recovery momentum continuing (towards 7.0700 vs almost 7.2700 at the new ATH) after spill-over from the ban on 3 foreign banks trading the Try resulted in a depressed volume volatility spike stopping some of Turkey’s biggest brokers taking orders from retail customers. However, reports suggest the banking regulator may reverse the ban if the banks adhere to regulations regarding lending to local institutions.</p>",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: Treasury to auction 3-year on Mon, 10-year on Tue, 30-year on Wed; bias is towards a steeper curve, analysts say",
        "content": "<p><strong>TACTICAL BIAS: </strong>Fed guidance on rates (staying at these low levels for the foreseeable), buying concentrated in the belly, and the possibility of yield curve control (YCC) is outweighing the flood of bill supply in the short-end of the curve, TD Securities argues, keeping rates anchored at low levels. Meanwhile, the long-end of the curve is under pressure as a result of rising Treasury supply. This should give the curve a steeper bias.</p><p><strong>THIS WEEK’S SUPPLY:</strong> The Treasury will auction USD 42bln 3-year notes (Mon), USD 32bln 10-year notes (Tue), and USD 22bln 30-year bonds (Wed). This week's auction will be revealing, given the Treasury's boosted refunding announcement last week. UBS notes that this week, around USD 86bln cash will fall due, including around USD 58bln of redemptions and USD 29bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>3-YEAR AUCTIONS RECENT HISTORY</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 0.348%, six-auction avg. 1.189%)</li><li>Tail: 1.2bps (prev. , six-auction avg. 0.7bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.28x, six-auction avg. 2.44x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 40.5%, six-auction avg. 35.9%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 4.1%, six-auction avg. 13.9%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 55.4%, six-auction avg. 50.2%)</li></ul><p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> There is still demand for 10-year even at slightly higher yields than present, analysts say, citing price action after Wednesday’s Treasury refunding announcement when 10-year yields closed 3-4bps higher, but rallied on Thursday back to within the 0.60-65% range (and respected the 0.78% top-end of its broader range). BMO argues, and that the liquidity advantages of Treasury auctions will continue to bring in buyers, and notes that sponsorship seen in recent auctions has come despite a dramatic repricing in yields, and we have seen several stop-throughs at record low yields, even with record auction sizes. BMO thinks this is an encouraging sign that the supply can be absorbed with little concession, and it does not expect the broader 0.54-0.78% 10-year Treasury yield range will be challenged as a result of this week’s supply. It does, however, think there is a risk the high-yield could stop-out above 0.70%.</p><p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTIONS RECENT HISTORY</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 0.782%, six-auction avg. 1.462%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. 0.7bps, six-auction avg. -0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.43x, six-auction avg. 2.46x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 27.6%, six-auction avg. 26.3%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 13.2%, six-auction avg. 14.2%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 59.2%, six-auction avg. 59.6%)</li></ul><p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> A more significant concession might be appropriate, relative to the 10-year supply, BMO believes, noting within the 1.35-1.40% range, the 30-year sector has continued to underperform the balance of the curve, which has led to re-steepening particularly in 2s10s and 5s30s; BMO believes more steepening could be in store as a result of the front-end of the curve being anchored to monetary policy expectations, and the second wave of steepening is likely to occur when evidence of upward pressure on inflation is seen; for the time being, the probability of inflation expectations spiking any time soon is limited.</p><p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTIONS RECENT HISTORY</strong></p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 1.325%, six-auction avg. 1.964%)</li><li>Tail: (prev. -0.5bps, six-auction avg. -0.1bps)</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.35x, six-auction avg. 2.40x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 22.6%, six-auction avg. 19.8%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 11.0%, six-auction avg. 16.5%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 66.4%, six-auction avg. 63.8%)</li></ul><p><strong>NEGATIVE RATES: </strong>Fed Funds futures for the turn of the year rose above par last week, signalling a probability above zero that the Fed could lower rates into negative territory next year. The moves above par were modest, and pared back at the end of the week (Nov 2020 FF was above par early Friday, but only the Feb 2021 contract closed out the week at/above par). Goldman Sachs is surprised by market's implying negative yields (even if modest) given that Fed speakers have generally been averse to such moves. GS says that, while it is hard to rule out, the pricing in seems a bit aggressive given current expectations for the economy, and even if the Fed were to explore negative rates, it would likely be reluctant to go deep, given political issues with penalising cash. Other think the pricing of negative rates might be more technical in nature.</p><p><strong>JAPANESE BUYERS:</strong> Talk of Japanese buyers coming back into the market makes sense, and the yen depreciating while Treasuries were rallying is consistent with that thesis. FX-hedged Treasuries for Japanese investors are looking somewhat attractive. Japanese had been buyers of Treasuries on an unhedged basis recently, and now they are attractive again on a hedged basis, and BMO would expect to see inflows continue from one of the largest-holders of Treasuries. However, it remains to be seen at what levels investors want to buy 30-year debt at.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: Over the weekend, the Chinese Central Bank promised to further cushion the impact of the pandemic but remained hesitant to signal a large stimulus move. The statement came after heated debates between Beijing’s top policymakers and the PBoC on the appropriate scale and funding for a package.</p><p><strong>THE STATEMENT</strong>: Sunday’s Q1 monetary policy implementation report removed the phrase “flood-like stimulus” – which some suggest could hint at huge financial resources needed to tackle the virus’ impacts and boost Chinese demand. The report also reiterated the PBoC’s view that it should preserve normal monetary policy but stressed that loosening should be aimed at supporting the real economy – especially the small private sector businesses and that the growth of money, credit and aggregate financing “must be in line with the [needs of] the economy”. The Central Bank also noted that it will continue to deepen lending rate reforms and improve policy transmission mechanism while guiding lending rates lower. Other aspects of the statement largely chimed with the PBoC’s usual language: it will keep the Yuan “basically stable”, will keep liquidity “reasonably ample”; it will fend off systemic financial risks.</p><p><strong>STIMULUS</strong>: The PBoC has this year cut its RRR three times whilst steadily lowering its market interest rates – which released liquidity into the market in the trillions. The Central Bank also provided almost CNY 2tln of funds for commercial banks to boost their lending capacities to small businesses during the pandemic. May 20th will also see the monthly Loan-Prime Rate (LRP) setting, with calls for a lowering after the PBoC announced a 30bps the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) in April. SLFs have shorter maturities to the Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) and are used to guide the LPR.</p><p><strong>NATIONAL PEOPLE’S CONGRESS (NPC):</strong> The statement comes ahead of next week’s NPC congregation. The confab on the 22nd May will unveil a series of economic targets – comprising of the budget deficit ratio, employment rate, size of bond issues to fund support programmes and typically its GDP target.</p><p>However, the issuing of the GDP target could be unorthodox. Sources noted that China is said to be mulling not issuing a numerical 2020 GDP target later this month. In late March, the 2019 6-6.5% target range was called to be revised lower by PBoC’s MPC member Ma Jun, who stated that a 4-5% target could also be hard to maintain as it is largely contingent on how the pandemic develops abroad. Further calls for a downgrade stacked up in April after Chinese GDP contracted 6.8% in Q1. China’s annual target at the time was believed to have been “around 6%”. The latest sources instead said a “description of the goal for the GDP growth” could be issued, albeit no final decision has been made and details remain light as to how this will be achieved. Desks note the move will untie the hands of policymakers from being obliged to issue stimulus to meet the target. For reference, newswires forecast the 2020 metric at 1.8%.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: Over the weekend, European Commission (EC) President Von der Leyen floated the possibility of legal action against the German Constitutional Court (GCC) - following the latter’s ruling that the ECB’s Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP) did not respect the “principle of proportionality”, suggesting the ECB went beyond its mandate – thus violating German law.</p><p><strong>PLAYBOOK</strong>: The Commission is tasked with policing member states’ adherence to EU law. First, the EC will issue a warning regarding the breach of law as it attempts to negotiate a solution. Should that fail, the EC will file a court case. The case would be heard by the European Court of Justice (ECJ).</p><p><strong>WHERE WE STAND</strong>: The weekend warning does not explicitly trigger a court case, but the EU cannot ignore a challenge by the largest member state’s top court. These infringement proceedings are abundant, albeit most are technical and avoid headlines. Usually, a compromise will be made in policy, or else fines are handed out in extreme cases. However, desks note it is unlikely the GCC will walk back on its ruling. Focus ahead is on the ECB’s response and how they intend to clarify the issue, as well as from a technical perspective whether the GCC would then need to issue a subsequent ruling to this. Additionally, some have posited that in theory, another member’s Central Bank could effectively take over from the Bundesbank and purchase the German PSPP – albeit this is complicated. Some fear that the ruling could open the door to similar cases in countries that are just as inclined, thus further threatening European unity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RECAP OF RECENT EVENTS:</strong></p><ul><li>The “proportionality” in question refers to the effect of the monetary policy objectives of the PSPP to economic and fiscal policy; specifically, the unconditional pursuit of inflation close to but below 2% while ignoring subsequent arising policy effects. As such, the court issued a three-month ultimatum to the ECB to demonstrate proportionality or the Bundesbank \"may no longer participate in the implementation and execution of the ECB decisions at issue\".</li><li>Furthermore, the condition states “[The] Bundesbank must ensure that the bonds already purchased and held in its portfolio are sold based on a – possibly long-term – strategy coordinated with the Eurosystem”. The decision does not concern the recently introduced Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), or any measures relating explicitly to COVID-19. The European Commission responded by stating that European top court (ECJ) rulings are binding for all national courts; and added EU law has primacy over national laws.</li><li>The ECB Governing Council took note of the ruling but reiterated its pledge to being fully committed to do everything necessary within its mandate, adding the ECJ ruled in its favour in 2018 that it is acting within its price stability mandate.</li><li>Desks note that a response from the ECB is likely to arise sooner rather than later given the pandemic situations and the need to subside uncertainty.&nbsp; However, some participants noted that the border between monetary policy and economic implications cannot be defined, potentially leaving the door for the GCC to decide on the border on its own. Furthermore, the ECB’s pledge to “do whatever it takes” may be hindered by the conditions attached to the ruling. Pantheon Macro notes that as far as they understand it, the ECJ will have the final say on the matter and ultimately it will \"all blow over\". However, the court ruling certainly raises concerns over the ECB's more recent initiatives which are even more creative than the one ruled on today.</li></ul>",

Meanwhile, broader risk sentiment has been underpinned if not quite boosted by latest COVID-19 developments, as the case and death counts in Italy and France continue to slow vs a rather worrying rebound in Germany’s R0 after a lifting of lockdown restrictions. Hence, Bunds are a bit listless and lacking clear direction within a 173.35-74 range vs their 173.77 previous close ahead of the EU cash bourse opens, more ECB speak, Italian ip that is bound to be awful and the latest weekly asset purchase update.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>The TPLEX endured an erratic session as participants digested a less-dire-than-expected NFP print – albeit still a record slump – as well as another push towards NIRP. The T-Note had been modestly firming overnight before it legged lower on the release of the NFP report, amid a wider risk on environment. However, the losses in the TPLEX soon reversed course not long after the cash equity open, led by another rally in short rates, which saw shorter maturity Fed Funds futures move above par, seeing the 2-year yield print a new all-time low of 10.5bps. The sharp move lower pared heading into the latest NY Fed USTs purchases schedule announcement, which saw the Fed taper its daily purchases to around USD 7bln per day from around USD 8bln. Looking at the changes within the buckets, it kept its long-end purchases unchanged (20- to 30-year) but made the largest proportion of cuts at the front-end – perhaps to counter the recent leg lower in front-end yields towards NIRP as well as addressing recent steepening post the Treasury quarterly refunding announcement. Following the updated schedule release, yields continued to edge higher, to which by settlement, all yields along the curve had risen on the session: 2s +2.5bps at 0.15%, 5s +3bps at 0.33%, 10s +5bps at 0.68%, 30s +7bps at 1.39%.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begun the week on the front foot after last Friday’s gains on Wall St where stocks were underpinned by the easing of US-China trade tensions to help the major indices disregard the abysmal US jobs data which was not as bad as expected, but still showed a drop of over 20mln jobs. In addition, efforts to ease coronavirus restrictions and a slowing pace of deaths from the pandemic have added to the optimism. ASX 200 (+1.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) were higher as earnings updates were also in focus for Australia and with risk appetite in Tokyo stoked amid reports the Japanese government will compile a 2nd extra budget to address the coronavirus and may lift the state of emergency declaration early in many prefectures. Hang Seng (+2.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.41%) were also positive after the PBoC pledged to resort to more powerful policies and step up counter-cyclical adjustments to support the economy and fend off risks, with outperformance in Hong Kong led by a surge in tech and gambling names. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower on spillover selling from T-notes and amid the upside in risky assets, but with downside cushioned due the BoJ’s presence in the market in which the central bank upped purchases of 3yr-5yr JGBs by JPY 50bln to a total of JPY 350bln.</p>",

(+0.4%) are also positive after the PBoC pledged to resort to more powerful policies and step up counter-cyclical adjustments to support the economy and fend off risks, with outperformance in Hong Kong led by a surge in tech and gambling names.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is lacklustre with price action rangebound after largely ignoring the recent shocking NFP jobs data, while its major counterparts eke mild gains with EUR/USD approaching the 1.0850 level to the upside after the Eurogroup reached a deal for a EUR 240bln extension to credit lines late last week. GBP/USD is also marginally higher after rebounding from support at 1.2400 and following PM Johnson’s announcement of a conditional 3-step plan on easing the lockdown with the first step being a shift of the government’s emphasis to actively encourage workers that cannot work from home to go to work, although they should avoid public transport if possible. However, UK PM Johnson’s shift in slogan from ‘stay at home’ to ‘stay alert’ left some confusion and was criticized by other leaders including Scotland’s First Minister Sturgeon who rejected the change and warned the mixed messages could result in many dying unnecessarily. Elsewhere, USD/JPY extended on gains due to the risk appetite but then retraced some of the advances after hitting resistance at 107.00, while antipodeans also benefit from the constructive tone but with gains in NZD/USD limited by poor business survey data and heading into the RBNZ’s policy meeting in which there is anticipation for the central bank to boost its QE program.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower on spillover selling from T-notes and amid the upside in risky assets, but with downside cushioned amid the BoJ’s presence in the market in which the central bank upped purchase intentions of 3yr-5yr JGBs by JPY 50bln to a total of JPY 350bln.</p>",
