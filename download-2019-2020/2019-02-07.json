(CNBC/Fox)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE kept the Base Rate unchanged at 0.75% as expected through unanimous vote, while it also unanimously voted to keep the stock of UK government bond purchases at GBP 435bln and stock of corporate bonds at GBP 10bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE maintained guidance that monetary policy is to be tightened over the forecast period at a gradual pace and to a limited extent if economy develops as expected.<br /><br />BoE noted UK growth slowed at the end of 2018 and appears to have weakened further early this year which largely reflects Brexit uncertainty, although it expects UK GDP growth to recover later this year with annual growth of 2% at the end of the forecast period. BoE also commented that CPI slipped to 2.1% in December and is expected to slip below the MPC&rsquo;s 2% target in the near-term amid declines in petrol prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Governor Carney said the economy as whole is not yet prepared for a no deal Brexit and that uncertainty is causing short-term volatility in economic data, hitting housing markets and consumers. BoE&#39;s Governor Carney also commented that markets should not start preparing for a scenario of no further rate hikes or for a cut and that he cannot predict path of monetary policy after Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&rsquo;s QIR Forecasts:<br />GDP Growth: 2019 Q1: 1.5% (Prev. 1.8%), 2020 Q1: 1.3% (Prev. 1.7%), 2021 Q1 1.7% (Prev. 1.7%), 2022 Q1: 2.0%<br />CPI Inflation: 2019 Q1: 1.8% (Prev. 2.2%), 2020 Q1: 2.3% (Prev. 2.4%), 2021 Q4: 2.1% (Prev. 2.1%), 2022 Q1: 2.1%<br />Unemployment Rate: 2019 Q1: 3.9% (Prev. 3.9%), 2020 Q1: 4.1% (Prev. 3.9%), 2021 Q1 4.1% (Prev. 3.9%), 2022 Q1: 3.8</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK PM May said she will deliver Brexit on time and that she had a good series of meetings in Brussels, while PM May was also said to have asked for a time-limit on the backstop. In related news, a spokesperson said PM May is clear there will be an insurance policy for NI in Brexit deal and that Brexit Minister Barclays will discuss further arrangements with EU&rsquo;s Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier on Monday. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Tusk told Theresa May today that UK opposition leader Corbyn&#39;s Brexit plan could be a promising way out of the current impasse. In related news, EU&rsquo;s Juncker said the meeting with UK PM May on how to reach an impasse has still not seen a breakthrough, while there were also comments from German Finance Minister Scholz that the ball is in court of UK parliament and that there will be no renegotiation of the Brexit deal. (Buzzfeed/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU official said UK PM May did not make any &quot;concrete proposals today on a way forward&quot; and gave no clear answers on how she imagined a &quot;timeline&quot; going forward, according to BBC&#39;s Katya Adler. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK government was reportedly presenting a Brexit motion for Feb 14th to allow MPs to debate plan B options and it was also reported that the government has not set a date for the vote on the revised Brexit deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European Commission released its Winter Economic Forecast in which it lowered its 2019 Eurozone GDP forecast to 1.3% from 1.9% but raised UK GDP forecast to 1.3% from 1.2% and cut Eurozone inflation forecast to 1.4% from 1.7%.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, dove) said we&#39;ll know in hindsight where neutral is but thinks we are in the right area currently, while he added muted inflation allows the Fed to be patient.

Strong earnings were reported from Hanesbrands (HBI), FleetCor Technologies (FLT), Masco (MAS), National Oilwell (NOV) and T-Mobile (TMUS), which all opened higher. Twitter (TWTR) nosedived after missing expectations on MAUs. Kellogg (K) underperformed after guidance negative growth for its FY19 EPS. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) dropped after disappointing earnings, causing losses across the automotive sector (F, GM, TSLA). A drop in crude prices saw the energy sector underperform. Facebook (FB) came under pressure after German regulators ordered the co. to curtail data gathering methods. Biogen (BIIB) dipped on the open after Mylan (MYL) won a patent review request for an MS treatment. SPX -0.9% at 2706, NDX -1.3% at 6905, DJI -0.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries caught a bid on Thursday, in line with their European counterparts, amid fear of a global slowdown after the EC downgraded Eurozone economic growth forecasts for 2019 and following a dovish BoE interest rate decision. The complex extended gains after NEC Director Kudlow announced that the US and Chinese leaders are unlikely to meet before the official March 1st deadline. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were lower by c.5bps at settlement. The US Treasury sold USD 19bln of 30-year bonds today in what could be considered a decent auction. Demand was evident with the auction coming in on the screws at 3.022%, the lowest yield since July 2018 and below the six-auction tail size average of 0.45bps. Spreads widened across the curve. Directs took 17%, their largest share since December 2014, however indirects took their smallest share since November 2016. US T-note futures (H9) settled 12+ ticks higher at 122-09.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>US MARKET WRAP 7 Feb 2019: Trump will not meet with Xi before 1st March tariff deadline</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: Equities down, dollar up, Treasuries up, crude up.<br />* REAR VIEW: Trump unlikely to meet Xi before March 1st, Fed&rsquo;s Clarida and Kaplan, BoE holds rates amidst Brexit uncertainty, ECB&rsquo;s Coeure warn of no deal Brexit, EU&rsquo;s Tusk optimistic on Corbyn&rsquo;s Brexit plan, Banxico holds rates on downside risks, Libyan forces regain El-Sharara oilfield, SunTrust and BB&amp;T merge, Treasury sells USD 19bln of 30yr bonds.<br />* AHEAD: Japanese Current Account, German Trade Balance, Norwegian GDP Growth, French &amp; Italian Industrial Output, Canadian Employment Data, RBA Statement on Monetary Policy, Fed&#39;s Bullard &amp; Daly Speaking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump confirmed reports that he was highly unlikely to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping before the March 1st tariff deadline, where tariffs will be reintroduced if no deal is made. Earlier comments from NEC Director Kudlow weren&rsquo;t too optimistic either, where he said there is a &ldquo;sizeable distance&rdquo; to go on China trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>As expected, the Bank opted to stand pat on rates at 0.75% with a 9-0 vote in doing so. The meeting largely carried a &lsquo;wait-and-see&rsquo; message with policymakers stressing the uncertainties to their outlook posed by Brexit. The Bank opted to retain their current guidance on Brexit by maintaining the assumption of a smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the UK&rsquo;s eventual trading relationship with the EU&rdquo;, whilst noting &ldquo;shifting expectations about Brexit appeared to be leading to greater-than-usual short-term volatility in economic data&rdquo;. This message was reiterated by Governor Carney at the accompanying press conference noting that he cannot predict the path of monetary policy after Brexit but did warn that as it stands the UK economy as a whole is not yet prepared for a no deal Brexit. During the press conference. When pressed on the MPC&rsquo;s current guidance of &lsquo;gradual and limited&rsquo; rate hikes, the Governor stuck to the script and stated that &ldquo;markets should not start preparing for a scenario of no further rate hikes or for a cut&rdquo; despite the QIR only envisaging 1 rate hike over their forecast horizon based on market expectations; a step down from the prior of one per year. In terms of the QIR more broadly, the main takeaway was the MPC&rsquo;s decision to slash their 2019 growth forecast to 1.2% from a prior of 1.7% with 2020 lowered to 1.5% from 1.7%. On the subject of growth, Carney noted that a more rapid decline in Brexit uncertainty then the BoE envisages could lift annual GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points, however, the Governor noted that the Bank believes Brexit uncertainty will last longer than initially envisaged. From an inflation perspective, short-term forecasts were lowered before eventually being expected to settle a little above the Bank&rsquo;s 2% target. Overall, ING concludes &ldquo;most paths now lead to an extension of the article 50 negotiating period&rdquo;, however, if the government can secure a deal that potential commits to a permanent custom union, &ldquo;this may well be followed up with a Bank of England rate hike relatively swiftly&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Vice Chair Clarida (Neutral, Voter) said the US economy is near full-employment. Fed&#39;s Kaplan (Dove, Non-Voter) said they will know in hindsight where the neutral rate is, but thinks they are in the right area currently. On the economy, he said the US has a super-tight labour market and muted inflation allows the Fed to be patient. Kaplan said he is focusing on financial conditions, European growth and US corporate earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Coeure (Neutral) said they do not have enough evidence to conclude that Eurozone is facing a lasting and serious slowdown and warned that a no deal Brexit definitely a near term material risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Not much progress on the Brexit front as the impasse continues, there was no breakthrough at today&rsquo;s meeting between EU&rsquo;s Juncker and UK PM May, with talks set to continue. EU officials added that the British PM did not make &ldquo;any proposals today on a way forward&rdquo; and gave no clear answer on how she imagined a timeline going forward. PM May&#39;s spokesperson announced that UK Brexit Minister Barclay will discuss further arrangements with EU Brexit Negotiator Barnier on Monday. Alongside this, EU&#39;s Tusk told PM May that UK opposition leader Corbyn&#39;s Brexit plan could be a promising way out of the current impasse, although some suggested that if she moves towards a softer Brexit, she would not be able to govern after given opposition from Brexiteers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BANXICO: </strong>Mexico&#39;s central bank unanimously voted to hold rates at 8.25%, in line with expectations Once again, the central bank noted that the balance of risks to growth were tilted to the downside; on inflation, it said the balance of risks had an upwards bias, while noting the uncertainty around price pressures. Banxico said it would be paying particular attention to uncertainty and pass through of exchange rate on prices, as well as relative monetary policy between the US and Mexico. The central bank pledged to take necessary actions to ensure inflation converges to target. On the fiscal side of the equation, it said that medium and long-term macro risks mean it is important that government meets the fiscal targets set in 2019 budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.37 LOWER AT USD 52.64/BBL, BRENT (J9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 10.6 LOWER AT USD 61.63/BBL. </strong>Oil prices failed to sustain yesterday&rsquo;s gains amid a risk-averse tone spreading across markets once again, on top of global growth fears after the EC downgraded its 2019 GDP forecasts for the Eurozone. Oil extend losses on initial reports that Libyan forces regained control of the El-Sharara oilfield from militants, although clashes were said to have resumed at the largest Libyan refinery; the country is reportedly producing 950k BPD of oil. Note the oilfield has been shut since mid-December and, if operations were to restart, this could add more than 300k BPD to the region&rsquo;s output, effectively levelling out the supply imbalance with Saudi Arabia. Nonetheless, Citi notes that even if the NOC was to order a restart, &ldquo;it is hard to imagine foreign oil companies (Total, Equinor, Repsol and OMV are all involved in the field) allowing their workers to return to Sharara before a more sustainable peace is achieved&rdquo;. In terms of oil production, Saudi Arabia&#39;s January oil output fell to 10.24mln, below the target level under OPEC production cut pact, while UAE January crude output was at 3.07mln BPD according to the energy ministry, in-line with the OPEC pact pledge. Elsewhere, Standard Chartered lowered its 2019 Brent price average forecast by USD 4/bbl to USD 74/bbl and 2020 reduced by USD 2/bbl to USD 83/bbl, as well as lowering its 2019 WTI forecasts by USD 7/bbl to USD 66/bbl and 2020 by USD 4/bbl to USD 78/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.9% at 2706, NDX -1.3% at 6905, DJI -0.9% at 25172. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -2.1%, Materials -1.4%, Industrials -0.8%, Cons Discretionary -1.0%, Cons Staples -0.2%, Healthcare -1.1%, Financials -1.0%, Tech -1.5%, Telecoms -1.2%, Utilities +1.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Regional banks SunTrust (STI) and BB&amp;T (BBT) outperformed on the announcement of a merger of equals valued at USD 66bln. Strong earnings were reported from Hanesbrands (HBI), FleetCor Technologies (FLT), Masco (MAS), National Oilwell (NOV) and T-Mobile (TMUS), which all opened higher. Twitter (TWTR) nosedived after missing expectations on MAUs. Kellogg (K) underperformed after guidance negative growth for its FY19 EPS. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) dropped after disappointing earnings, causing losses across the automotive sector (F, GM, TSLA). A drop in crude prices saw the energy sector underperform. Facebook (FB) came under pressure after German regulators ordered the co. to curtail data gathering methods. Biogen (BIIB) dipped on the open after Mylan (MYL) won a patent review request for an MS treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED 12+ TICKS HIGHER AT 122-09. </strong>Treasuries caught a bid on Thursday, in line with their European counterparts, amid fear of a global slowdown after the EC downgraded Eurozone economic growth forecasts for 2019 and following a dovish BoE interest rate decision. The complex extended gains after NEC Director Kudlow announced that the US and Chinese leaders are unlikely to meet before the official March 1st deadline. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were lower by c.5bps at settlement. The US Treasury sold USD 19bln of 30-year bonds today in what could be considered a decent auction. Demand was evident with the auction coming in on the screws at 3.022%, the lowest yield since July 2018 and below the six-auction tail size average of 0.45bps. Spreads widened across the curve. Directs took 17%, their largest share since December 2014, however indirects took their smallest share since November 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP: </strong>Not necessarily the biggest net mover, but certainly among the most volatile and staging an impressive recovery from worst levels. Cable extended losses through a triple chart base around 1.2925, then dipped below 1.2900 to test 30 and 100 DMA convergence circa 1.2895 before sliding through to 1.2855 after the BoE&rsquo;s QIR and MPC minutes revealed marked cuts to GDP and CPI forecasts amidst heightened Brexit uncertainty and risk of a no deal outcome. The Bank also acknowledged lower market rate expectations since the November policy meeting, and 2019 tightening odds subsequently lengthened further. However, BoE Governor Carney struck a more balanced and non-committal tone in the press conference, underlining no automated policy response in the event of no deal, and the prospect that the economy could pick-up if there is more clarity before March 29 and through the transition period. Hence, short covering coupled with consolidation and some loss of Dollar momentum (after MS suggested that the Usd could be 20% overvalued) pushed Cable all the back to within a few pips of 1.3000, while Eur/Gbp broadly moved in reverse within a 0.8815-0.8730 range, and as the single currency struggled to overcome independent bearish impulses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie looks set to end Thursday&rsquo;s session as the G10 underperformer, partly on a recoil in oil prices, broader risk aversion and news that Transcanada partially shut its keystone crude pipeline yesterday due to a leak. Usd/Cad had already rebounded through some key chart levels and 1.3250 to 1.3280, and 1.3295 (Fib retracement) sitting at1.3300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Consolidating recovery gains vs the Greenback after another brief slip through 110.00 on safe-haven demand, and perhaps supported by decent option expiry interest at the big figure where 1 bn ran off at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, AUD, EUR, NZD: </strong>All narrowly mixed vs the Buck after a volatile session, as the Franc gradually gleaned some comfort from the aforementioned Usd ease off best levels (DXY currently nearer the base of 96.366-683 trading parameters) to edge closer towards parity, while Eur/Chf consolidated gains around 1.1350. Meanwhile, the Aud clawed its back towards 0.7100 having stalled ahead of nearest buying interest/tech support at 0.7075, and similarly the single currency managed to pare some losses ahead of bids at 1.1320 and the 30 DMA (1.1316) having taken out 1.1350 in wake of latest dire Eurozone data, the ECB monthly bulletin and EU Commission forecasts. However, the Kiwi struggled to get over a disappointing Q4 jobless report as Nzd/Usd languished between 0.6775 and 0.6745, while Aud/Nzd pivoted 1.0500 vs just a few pips above 1.0400 on Wednesday.</p>\r\n",

The Fed will reinvest USD 9.2bln at the 3-year, USD 6.5bln at the 10-year, and USD 4.6bln at the 30-year auction. Barclays analysts note the lacking demand in January&rsquo;s auction where the b/c came in lower than average at 2.2x, as well as the auction tailing by 1.1bps; although domestic investors boosted their allocation to 67%, the highest monthly takedown on record, whilst weaker foreign participation was evident in the indirect&rsquo;s share, which fell to 4% in January from December&rsquo;s 14%. Analysts at SocGen note &ldquo;the 30y sector does not seem to have a clear set-up for the upcoming bond auction and will likely need a concession to be underwritten smoothly.&rdquo; On a positive note they go on to highlight that, &ldquo;the 30y WI yield is trading above the last two auction stops, which should help with the auction takedown.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tail size: Prev. tails by 1.1bps, six-auction average: tails by 0.45bps</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bid-to-Cover: Prev. 2.19x, six-auction average: 2.27x</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High-yield: Prev. 3.035%, six-auction average: 3.19%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dealers: Prev. 26.73%, six-auction average: 27.83%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Directs: Prev. 15.95%, six-auction average: 10.5%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indirects: Prev. 57.32%, six-auction average: 61.67%</p>\r\n",

Cable extended losses through a triple chart base around 1.2925, then dipped below 1.2900 to test 30 and 100 DMA convergence circa 1.2895 before sliding through to 1.2855 after the BoE&rsquo;s QIR and MPC minutes revealed marked cuts to GDP and CPI forecasts amidst heightened Brexit uncertainty and risk of a no deal outcome. The Bank also acknowledged lower market rate expectations since the November policy meeting, and 2019 tightening odds subsequently lengthened further. However, BoE Governor Carney struck a more balanced and non-committal tone in the press conference, underlining no automated policy response in the event of no deal, and the prospect that the economy could pick-up if there is more clarity before March 29 and through the transition period. Hence, short covering coupled with consolidation and some loss of Dollar momentum (after MS suggested that the Usd could be 20% overvalued) pushed Cable all the back to within a few pips of 1.3000, while Eur/Gbp broadly moved in reverse within a 0.8815-0.8730 range, and as the single currency struggled to overcome independent bearish impulses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie looks set to end Thursday&rsquo;s EU session as the G10 underperformer, partly on a recoil in oil prices, broader risk aversion and news that Transcanada partially shut its keystone crude pipeline yesterday due to a leak. Usd/Cad had already rebounded through some key chart levels and 1.3250 to 1.3280, with 1.3295 next on the radar (Fib retracement).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consolidating recovery gains vs the Greenback after another brief slip through 110.00 on safe-haven demand, and perhaps supported by decent option expiry interest at the big figure where 1 bn ran off at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD/EUR/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Buck after a volatile session, as the Franc gradually gleaned some comfort from the aforementioned Usd ease off best levels (DXY currently nearer the base of 96.366-683 trading parameters) to edge closer towards parity, while Eur/Chf consolidated gains around 1.1350. Meanwhile, the Aud clawed its back above 0.7100 having stalled ahead of nearest buying interest/tech support at 0.7075, and similarly the single currency managed to pare some losses ahead of bids at 1.1320 and the 30 DMA (1.1316) having taken out 1.1350 in wake of latest dire Eurozone data, the ECB monthly bulletin and EU Commission forecasts. However, the Kiwi struggled to get over a disappointing Q4 jobless report as Nzd/Usd languished between 0.6775 and 0.6745, while Aud/Nzd pivoted 1.0500 vs just a few pips above 1.0400 on Wednesday.</p>\r\n",

Shifting expectations about Brexit appeared to be leading to greater-than-usual short-term volatility in economic data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growth: Global growth has continued to slow in recent months, whilst UK growth slowed at the end of 2018 and appears to have weakened further in early 2019; largely reflecting Brexit uncertainty.

Under the assumptions that condition the February report, inflation settles at a rate a little above the target</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rates: Maintain guidance that monetary policy is to be tightened over the forecast period at a gradual pace and to a limited extent if economy develops as expected</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investment: Business investment is likely to have been a dragging factor on GDP growth around the turn of the year</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labour Market: Remains tight with the employment rate remaining at a record high</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wages: Average weekly earnings growth rose to 3.4% in the three months to November which was 0.5 percentage points higher than expected at the time of the November QIR</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) was negative with sentiment dampened by a firmer currency and as participants digested a slew of earnings, although the index was not short of success stories as Mazda was buoyed after an upward revision to guidance and SoftBank surged over 17% on higher profits and the announcement of a JPY 600bln buyback. Elsewhere, KOSPI (Unch) traded indecisively and struggled to maintain the early exuberant tone on return from the Lunar New Year holidays, while ASX 200 (+1.1%) outperformed its peers with broad-based gains as sentiment continued to get a lift from RBA Governor Lowe&rsquo;s recent dovish shift to a more evenly balanced view on rates.

The FTSE 100 (-0.1%) is less impacted amid currency effects. Sectors are mixed with some underperformance seen in telecom names and some outperformance in healthcare.&nbsp; Towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Tui (-16.7%) following the Co. cutting profit outlook due to sector headwinds.&nbsp; Separately, Publicis (-12.4%) are down following Q4 revenue growth coming in below expectations; pressuring WPP (-6.2%) and Prosiebensat (-3.1%) in sympathy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD &ndash; The Kiwi has dropped to the bottom of the G10 pile on the back of a relatively bleak NZ jobs report overnight, as employment growth almost dried up in Q4 and the unemployment rate rose more than expected. Nzd/Usd is now hovering around 0.6750 and in danger of testing support just ahead of 0.6700 having lost grip of the 0.6900 and 0.6800 handles in very short order, while the Aud/Nzd cross has snapped back above 1.0500 from close to 1.0400 only yesterday even though the Aussie continues to weaken independently on the RBA shift from a tightening to neutral bias, with Aud/Usd pivoting 0.7100 and edging closer to bids/tech support circa 0.7075.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/GBP &ndash; All extending losses vs the Greenback as well, and the single currency blighted by more weak Eurozone data, confirmation of downside economic risks via the latest ECB monthly bulletin and GDP/inflation downgrades from the EU Commission. Eur/Usd has now filled bids at 1.1350, with bears targeting the 1.1320 level next for more buying interest ahead of the 30 DMA around 1.1316 before 1.1300. Meanwhile, consolidation in crude prices and a stalling of recent recovery momentum has combined with a change in the technical landscape for the Loonie that has retreated further from recent highs to 1.3250+, and Sterling continues to suffer Brexit-related jitters on top of the overriding Dollar strength (DXY holding firm above 96.500), with Cable testing support just under 1.2900 (namely 1.2895 where 30 and 100 DMAs align).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF &ndash; Relative outperformers and benefiting from their safe-haven appeal as risk sentiment wanes, with Usd/Jpy reversing from another 110.00+ foray and Eur/Chf has retreating further from 1.1400+ even though the Franc remains below par vs the Buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK &ndash; As usual, the Scandi crowns are prone to broader swings in risk appetite, and thus are weaker today irrespective of regional data like firmer than forecast Norwegian manufacturing production and steady, albeit flat Swedish house prices.

The FTSE 100 (-0.1%) is less impacted amid currency effects. Sectors are mixed with some underperformance seen in telecom names and some outperformance in healthcare.&nbsp; Towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Tui (-16.7%) following the Co. cutting profit outlook due to sector headwinds.&nbsp; Separately, Publicis (-12.4%) are down following Q4 revenue growth coming in below expectations; pressuring WPP (-6.2%) and Prosiebensat (-3.1%) in sympathy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi has dropped to the bottom of the G10 pile on the back of a relatively bleak NZ jobs report overnight, as employment growth almost dried up in Q4 and the unemployment rate rose more than expected. Nzd/Usd is now hovering around 0.6750 and in danger of testing support just ahead of 0.6700 having lost grip of the 0.6900 and 0.6800 handles in very short order, while the Aud/Nzd cross has snapped back above 1.0500 from close to 1.0400 only yesterday even though the Aussie continues to weaken independently on the RBA shift from a tightening to neutral bias, with Aud/Usd pivoting 0.7100 and edging closer to bids/tech support circa 0.7075.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/GBP - All extending losses vs the Greenback as well, and the single currency blighted by more weak Eurozone data, confirmation of downside economic risks via the latest ECB monthly bulletin and GDP/inflation downgrades from the EU Commission. Eur/Usd has now filled bids at 1.1350, with bears targeting the 1.1320 level next for more buying interest ahead of the 30 DMA around 1.1316 before 1.1300. Meanwhile, consolidation in crude prices and a stalling of recent recovery momentum has combined with a change in the technical landscape for the Loonie that has retreated further from recent highs to 1.3250+, and Sterling continues to suffer Brexit-related jitters on top of the overriding Dollar strength (DXY holding firm above 96.500), with Cable testing support just under 1.2900 (namely 1.2895 where 30 and 100 DMAs align).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Relative outperformers and benefiting from their safe-haven appeal as risk sentiment wanes, with Usd/Jpy reversing from another 110.00+ foray and Eur/Chf has retreating further from 1.1400+ even though the Franc remains below par vs the Buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK - As usual, the Scandi crowns are prone to broader swings in risk appetite, and thus are weaker today irrespective of regional data like firmer than forecast Norwegian manufacturing production and steady, albeit flat Swedish house prices. Eur/Nok is around 9.7270 and has been up over 9.7300, while Eur/Sek climbed to 10.4950 at one stage before easing back a bit towards 10.4700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took a while, and perhaps somewhat longer than appeared likely in early EU trade, but the combination of poor data, the ECB&rsquo;s monthly report underlining last month&rsquo;s downgrade to the balance of risks and some significantly lower EU growth forecasts eventually pushed Bunds through their previous contract best and 166.00 on the way to a fresh high at 166.21 (+70 ticks on the day).

Eur/Usd has now filled bids at 1.1350, with bears targeting the 1.1320 level next for more buying interest ahead of the 30 DMA around 1.1316 before 1.1300. Meanwhile, consolidation in crude prices and a stalling of recent recovery momentum has combined with a change in the technical landscape for the Loonie that has retreated further from recent highs to 1.3250+, and Sterling continues to suffer Brexit-related jitters on top of the overriding Dollar strength (DXY holding firm above 96.500), with Cable testing support just under 1.2900 (namely 1.2895 where 30 and 100 DMAs align).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative outperformers and benefiting from their safe-haven appeal as risk sentiment wanes, with Usd/Jpy reversing from another 110.00+ foray and Eur/Chf has retreating further from 1.1400+ even though the Franc remains below par vs the Buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, the Scandi crowns are prone to broader swings in risk appetite, and thus are weaker today irrespective of regional data like firmer than forecast Norwegian manufacturing production and steady, albeit flat Swedish house prices.

For UK markets, lingering Brexit uncertainty and heightened risk of no deal with just 50 days left before D day are also impacting and manifesting in data/survey releases like the latest PMIs and house prices. All this ahead of BoE super Thursday with the minutes and QIR to reveal updated policy views, growth and inflation projections. Back to Liffe, and the 10 year benchmark is hovering just under 123.82, while STIRs are flat to 2 ticks ahead at the back end. Note, Gilts have now surpassed a key upside chart obstacle around 123.74 to expose 124.00 and tech resistance levels above the big figure ahead of the 124.45 contract high.</p>\r\n",

Bunds remain firmly bid around 165.74, with the corresponding cash yield on the brink of breaching 0.15%, which would then expose multi-year lows just a few bp below. However, bulls may need a bit more impetus/conviction to break the next set of barriers and this could come via confirmation of a downturn in EU equities off the open, weak Italian retail sales, a dovish/downbeat ECB monthly bulletin and/or hefty EC growth downgrades (beyond the anticipated slash to Italian GDP). On that note, BTPs have tumbled again despite stellar demand for the 2049 syndicated bond offering and also propping up the core.</p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) was negative with sentiment dampened by a firmer currency and as participants digested a slew of earnings, although the index was not short of success stories as Mazda was buoyed after an upward revision to guidance and SoftBank surged over 17% on higher profits and the announcement of a JPY 600bln buyback. Elsewhere, KOSPI (+0.1%) traded indecisively and struggled to maintain the early exuberant tone on return from the Lunar New Year holidays, while ASX 200 (+1.1%) outperformed its peers with broad-based gains as sentiment continued to get a lift from RBA Governor Lowe&rsquo;s recent dovish shift to a more evenly balanced view on rates. Finally, 10yr JGBS failed to benefit from the risk averse tone in Japan with demand kept subdued amid a similar picture seen in T-notes, while firmer results at today&rsquo;s 30yr JGB auction were also ineffective in spurring prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senator Grassley said the China deal will be done by &ldquo;executive agreement&rdquo; but what happens to the tariffs on March 1st is &ldquo;not definitive&rdquo; after a briefing with USTR Lighthizer, according to a CNBC correspondent.

Elsewhere, antipodeans remained subdued in which AUD/USD breached 0.7100 to the downside with the pair down almost 250 pips since the release of RBA Governor Lowe&rsquo;s dovish comments, while NZD/USD was heavily pressured on poor employment data in which Employment Change missed estimates and the Unemployment Rate jumped to 4.3% from 3.9%, which also coincided with a decline in the Participation Rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand Employment Change (Q4) Q/Q 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.3% (Prev. 1.1%).

Elsewhere, gold prices trickled lower towards the USD 1300/oz level as the greenback remained firm, while copper was kept rangebound by the mixed risk tone and continued absence of its largest buyer China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transcanada Keystone oil pipeline was shut due to a potential leak in St. Louis, Missouri area, although it was unsure if the leak was from Keystone. Elsewhere, an evacuation was ordered in a San Francisco neighbourhood after a PG&amp;E gas line explosion engulfed some buildings in flames.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries ended the session mixed and close to the unchanged mark on Wednesday. The complex remained bid for most of the European session, moving in tandem with Bunds, but caught a leg lower following a soft 10yr auction. Losses however were quickly pared back and pushing treasuries in flat territory. Yields were mixed across the curve and moves were less than 1bpsm spreads towards a steepening bias. The US sold USD 27bln of 10-year notes on Wednesday at 2.689%, the lowest yield since January 2018. However, demand was fairly weak, the auction tailed by 0.8bps and the bid/cover came in at 2.35x, both worse than average. The composition of buyers pointed to weaker demand too, where primary dealers took the biggest allocation since October 2018. US T-note futures (H9) settled half a tick higher at 121-28+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell said the US economy is now in a good place, while he also commented that surveys have showed this is a good time to find a job for workers which is a sign of a very healthy labour market but added that lagging labour force participation is a concern.

        "content": "<p>The RBI is expected to keep rates unchanged at its policy decision on Thursday in which some recent surveys suggested that two-thirds of analysts forecast the Repurchase Rate to be kept at 6.50% and with the remaining minority expecting a 25bps cut. The central bank is also seen to maintain the Reverse Repo Rate at 6.25% and the Cash Reserve Ratio at 4.00%, while there are mixed views on whether the RBI will adjust its current &#39;calibrated tightening&#39; stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The policy meeting will be the first under the stewardship of Governor Shaktikanta Das who replaced former Governor Patel after the latter&#39;s abrupt resignation in December, which was the culmination of a spat with the government amid threats to RBI independence. Therefore, some view the new Governor (who was appointed by the government) to be more susceptible to government pressure for looser policy as the ruling BJP seek a boost for the economy ahead of the general elections which is why some suggest a surprise cut cannot fully be ruled out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This view of a potentially more accommodating central bank governor has also been supported by recent actions by the RBI who just last week freed Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra and Oriental Bank of Commerce from their restrictive prompt corrective action framework, while Governor Das who is a former Economic Affairs Secretary, has also been criticized amid wide expectations the RBI will likely significantly boost the interim dividend to the government which would help the latter dress its accounts prior to the election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent data from India has been mixed with CPI in December softening further to 2.19% vs. Exp. 2.2% (Prev. 2.33%) which effectively gives the RBI room to ease, while disappointing Industrial Output at 0.5% vs. Exp. 4.1% (Prev. 8.1%) also favours calls for looser policy. Conversely, expectations of strong growth figures suggest a lack of urgency to tweak policy as India FY 18/19 GDP Annual Estimate increased to 7.2% vs. Exp. 7.2% (Prev. 6.7%) which represents the fastest growth in 3 years. Elsewhere, last week&rsquo;s interim budget included a INR 750bln income support package for farmers and increase to the zero income tax level which is seen as supportive for the economy and therefore provides room the RBI to bide its time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the decision which will be released on the RBI&rsquo;s website at a new time of 0615GMT/0015CST/1415HKT, focus will also be on the stance as many expect the central bank to shift back to a neutral stance from the current calibrated tightening which could pave the way for future easing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent Comments and Calls<br />- Axis Bank noted a rate cut at this meeting might be premature and that risks are evenly balanced.<br />- DBS sees no rate cuts for this year given the budget and uncertainties about the outlook.<br />- Goldman Sachs revised its forecast for the meeting and now sees a cut in rates vs. Prev. forecast for unchanged.</p>\r\n",
