Better risk sentiment -- where talks/between US and China are progressing, with some suggestions of compromises, while geopolitics regarding US/Iran is moving in a friendlier direction after the sacking of WH Adviser Bolton -- as well as hopes of stimulus from the ECB this week (and likely looser policy from the Fed next week, with sources suggesting the BOJ could join the party too) have lessened the need for safer assets. This week's supply and heavy corporate issuance were also said to have weighed on the complex. US T-notes (Z9) settled 22+ ticks lower at 130-05.</p>",

From the US side, White House adviser Navarro called for patience ahead of key US/China talks planned for next month, when top officials from Beijing will visit in Washington. China's SCMP reported that China was ready to sweeten a trade deal by buying US goods, a source said; the piece also stated that any purchase agreement was no certainty, and the purchasing of US goods would be in exchange for a delay on tariffs, easing of restrictions on Huawei; China could offer more market access and better IP protection as well as cutting industrial capacity, but would be reluctant to compromise on subsidies, industrial policies and reform of SOEs. Elsewhere, US Commerce Department's preliminary findings shows that imports of ceramic tiles from China have been subsidies unfairly; have put preliminary duties of 103.77-222.24% on Chinese ceramic tile imports.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> US President Trump said he sacked security advisor John Bolton, saying he disagreed strongly with some of his suggestions. Bolton was considered a trade/international relations hawk, and as such, analysts think this could open the way for more constructive talks with China, and possibly others. Bolton has also been hawkish on foreign policy, and as such, may pave the way for more constructive talks with the likes of Iran. Israel PM Netanyahu says he intends to annex Jordan Valley in the West Bank, which had been hinted at earlier. It was also a key campaign pledge. Later, the US Treasury has issued sanctions on a series of terrorist leaders, facilitators and entities under new counter-terrorism sanctions authority which includes Hamaas, Islamic State, Al Qaeda and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p><p><strong>* EIA STEO:</strong> US EIA cuts its 2019 forecast for world oil demand growth by 100K BPD, and now forecasts 900k BPD y/y increase; it cut its 2020 world oil demand growth view by 30k, now seeing 1.4mln BPD y/y increase. In terms of output, 2019 US Crude output is set to rise by 1.25mln BPD to 12.24mln BPD (Prev. month 1.28mln BPD increase), while 2020 US Crude output is seen rising 990k BPD to 13.23mln BPD (Prev. month 13.26mln BPD). NOTE: the IEA is expected to cut its world oil demand forecast by around 100k as well, according to its chief Birrol on Monday. Meanwhile, OPEC's SecGen Barkindo on Tuesday said OPEC's world oil demand forecasts have been conservative, and he saw no recession ahead, suggesting that the cartel might not join the EIA and IEA in cutting their demand view.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLES USD 0.45 LOWER AT USD 57.40/BBL; BRENT (X9) SETTLES USD 0.21 LOWER AT USD 62.38/BBL:</strong> The crude complex was higher in early trade on Tuesday, with traders continuing to cite the new Saudi energy minister's commitment to the supply curb pact as a key pillar supporting oil. However, there was negative ticks in the complex on news that US President Trump had sacked adviser John Bolton, considered a hawk. Analysts said that this may potentially open up a more constructive tone on foreign policy and on trade talks. It also suggests that a meeting between the US and Iran at this month's UN conference becomes a more realistic possibility, and may contribute to the geopolitical risk premium being priced out of (or to a lesser extent) within the crude complex.</p><p><strong>* ECB SOURCES:</strong> Sources reportedly said that the ECB could delay the launch of any QE, and tie it to data when it is launched. The article reportedly said that amid strong disagreement over how much stimulus was needed, policymakers could lean towards tying it to further economic downside. The central bank this week is expected to launch a package of easing measures; RANsquawk's ECB preview can be accessed <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/22737/download\">here.</a></p><p><strong>* BOJ SOURCES: </strong>The BoJ's decision on when/whether to ease will be a close call, sources said, as policymakers are growing less confident in global growth. Taking rates further into negative territory is among options, but other measures are not off the table, the report said, adding that no decision has been taken yet, and the decision will be a close call (potentially at the last minute). If rates were moved further into negative territory, the report suggested that there could be accompanying mitigating measures for banks. The piece reiterated that the BoJ's tool box includes deepening negative rates, cutting 10-year JGB target, ramping up purchases of risky assets, as well as printing more money.</p><p><strong>* EUROPEAN POLITICS: </strong>Italy PM Conte says he wants reform of EU stability pact, and more scope for investment. In Spain, talks between the PSOE and Podemos looked to have stalled, raising the possibility of elections on 10th November if no coalition can be formed by next week. In the UK, EU is reportedly looking to a Northern Ireland-only backstop to break Brexit deadlock (an idea previously rejected by PM May), with EU sources insisting that there was no other workable approach; a senior ERG source says if UK PM Johnson goes for an all-Ireland backstop that 'throws the DUP under the bus' the deal would not get through the Commons. Elsewhere, UK PM Johnson reiterated that there was a way of getting a Brexit deal with the EU. In Europe, incoming EC Chief Von Der Leyen says the UK would need to appoint a commissioner if the Brexit deadline is extended.</p><p><strong>* BOE</strong>: BoE Governor Carney said the Bank does not see large imbalances in the economy, that would normally precipitate a slowdown, adding that the BoE has the tools to deal with any economic slowdown. The Governor reiterated that the BoE could release countercyclical capital buffers for banks in the event of a downturn, but does not see negative interest rates as a tool in the UK. On markets more broadly, he warned that we are getting closer to a global liquidity trap. Carney also said that the Fed has monetary policy room to deal with a slowdown, BoE is close and ECB is further away.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTES (Z9) SETTLES 22+ TICKS LOWER AT 130-05.</strong> Yields jumped across the curve by between 8-9bps at settlement, though major curve spreads were around 1bps narrower. Better risk sentiment -- where talks/between US and China are progressing, with some suggestions of compromises, while geopolitics regarding US/Iran is moving in a friendlier direction after the sacking of WH Adviser Bolton -- as well as hopes of stimulus from the ECB this week (and likely looser policy from the Fed next week, with sources suggesting the BOJ could join the party too) have lessened the need for safer assets. This week's supply and heavy corporate issuance were also said to have weighed on the complex.</p><p><strong>* 3-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> It was a mixed 3-year note auction, which tailed by 0.3bps, with similar cover to the August auction; cover was a touch softer than recent averages, though was in line with the prior; dealer participation picked-up versus the prior as well as recent averages, while directs were more or less in line with recent performance. Indirect participation was also in line with recent averages. In wake of the auction, the TPLEX continued to see yields rise, with the 10-year yield topping 1.70% again, ahead of Wednesday's auction.</p><p><strong>* US 10-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> Analysts at SocGen says the 10-year part of the curve does not have clear set up for the upcoming auction from a relative value perspective, arguing that it appears rich on asset swap versus the previous 10-year auction cycle, though it does look cheap on the curve versus 5s and 30s. SocGen says the steepening of 2s10s seen since late August, however, does make the sector look attractive, though the bank highlights that 2s10s has actually flattened by around 10bps since the previous auction cycle (NOTE: August's auction was soft). On the other side of the coin, SocGen observes that the current 10-year note trades special in repo, and dealer holdings in the 7-10 year bucket is low; both of these factors could be supportive for the auction. \"Even so,\" SocGen writes, \"the auction will likely demand a concession to go well, as the current WI yield is well below all auction stops since August 2016.\" The bank says it is neutral on the September 10-year auction.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: DXY</strong> is slightly firmer, though is within Monday's trading range, with desks attributing the limited bouts of upside to risk aversion, as stocks moved lower. <strong>JPY</strong> traded higher to just shy of 107.50, though heads into APAC trade flat, eyeing the MOF's business conditions survey overnight; sources also raise the possibility of looser measures from the BOJ. <strong>XAU</strong> remains sub-1500 as Treasury yields tick up, and geopolitics seemingly moves in a friendlier direction. <strong>EUR</strong> firmed after a sources report suggesting a QE announcement this week is still not a done deal. <strong>GBP</strong> is flat at around 1.2350, having ventured up to 1.2375; Parliament is now prorogued, and it may allow GBP to take a more quiet path of trade; vols have edged lower, though desks still see election risks presenting downside to GBP, and as such, it remains a sell on rallies, desks say. <strong>NOK</strong> and <strong>SEK</strong> are both lower against the EUR following inflation data. <strong>CAD</strong> went higher with oil in early trade, while housing starts and building permits surprised to the upside; some reports suggest PM Trudeau will call for elections on Wednesday; the Loonie retained gains, despite oil going negative on geopolitics. <strong>AUD</strong> flat, business conditions and confidence fell, data from NAB showed.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 0% at 2979, NASDAQ-100 -0.2% at 7815, Dow Jones 0.3% at 26909.</p><p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary -0.4%, Consumer Staple -0.6%, Energy 1.3%, Financials 0.4%, Health Care 0.3%, Industrials 1%, Information Technology -0.5%, Materials 1%, Telecommunication Services 0%, Utilities 0.1%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple’s (AAPL) new event saw the announcement of a streaming service priced at USD 4.99/mth which weighed on Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS) and Roku (ROKU), and a new health app put pressure on Fitbit (FIT). iPhone entry level prices were slightly cheaper than its XR equivalents, with the iPhone 11 to start from USD 699, and the PRO model at USD 999, and the PRO MAX at USD 1099; a new iWatch and iPad were also announced. Ford (F) was hit after is unsecured debt was downgraded to junk at Moody's, however, desks had mixed views, with BofAML suggesting it may be a sign of more to come, whereas Credit Suisse believes it did little to affect Ford’s ongoing business. Boeing’s (BA) gross orders for August stood at 185, however, net orders were -15 due to cancellations, also likely impacted by different airlines pushing back their expected return of the 737 MAX. JPMorgan’s (JPM) CEO Dimon expects Q3 trading revenues to rise 10% Y/Y in Q3, but caveated it with ‘Q318 was not great’. Wendy’s (WEN) announced it is to initiate a breakfast menu at 300 restaurants next year and will hire 20,000 new employees to support the move. The fast food restaurant then cut the top end of its FY19 Adj. EPS growth view to 3.5-6.5% from 3.5-7%. In M&amp;A, Renault (RNO FP) CEO stated it is no longer in discussion with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and that the main priority is having Nissan (NSANY) back on schedule. Exxon (XOM) was higher after sources said it was in advanced talks with Repsol (REP SM) to sell some of its Gulf of Mexico assets for around USD 1bln. MecardoLibre (MELI) traded lower after Amazon (AMZN) announced it will launch its prime subscription service in Brazil as it aims to expand in the largest LATAM economy.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li><strong>TREASURIES: </strong>Yields jumped across the curve by between 8-9bps at settlement, though major curve spreads were around 1bps narrower. Better risk sentiment -- where talks/between US and China are progressing, with some suggestions of compromises, while geopolitics regaridng US/Iran is moving in a friendlier direction after the sacking of WH Adviser Bolton -- as well as hopes of stimulus from the ECB this week (and likely looser policy from the Fed next week, with sources suggesting the BOJ could join the party too) have lessened the need for safer assets. This week's supply and heavy corporate issuance were also said to have weighed on the complex.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>3-YEAR AUCTION: </strong>It was a mixed 3-year note auction, which tailed by 0.3bps, with similar cover to the August auction; cover was a touch softer than recent averages, though was in line with the prior; dealer participation picked-up versus the prior as well as recent averages, while directs were more or less in line with recent performance. Indirect participation was also in line with recent averages. In wake of the auction, the TPLEX continued to see yields rise, with the 10-year yield topping 1.70% again, ahead of Wednesday's auction.</li><li><strong>US 10-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>Analysts at SocGen says the 10-year part of the curve does not have clear set up for the upcoming auction from a relative value perspective, arguing that it appears rich on asset swap versus the previous 10-year auction cycle, though it does look cheap on the curve versus 5s and 30s. SocGen says the steepening of 2s10s seen since late August, however, does make the sector look attractive, though the bank highlights that 2s10s has actually flattened by around 10bps since the previous auction cycle (NOTE: August's auction was soft). On the other side of the coin, SocGen observes that the current 10-year note trades special in repo, and dealer holdings in the 7-10 year bucket is low; both of these factors could be supportive for the auction. \"Even so,\" SocGen writes, \"the auction will likely demand a concession to go well, as the current WI yield is well below all auction stops since August 2016.\" The bank says it is neutral on the September 10-year auction.</li></ul>",

Bolton was considered a trade/international relations hawk, and as such, analysts think this could open the way for more constructive talks with China, and possibly others. Bolton has also been hawkish on foreign policy, and as such, may pave the way for more constructive talks with the likes of Iran. Israel PM Netanyahu says he intends to annex Jordan Valley in the West Bank, which had been hinted at earlier. It was also a key campaign pledge. Later, the US Treasury has issued sanctions on a series of terrorist leaders, facilitators and entities under new counter-terrorism sanctions authority which includes Hamaas, Islamic Stae, Al Qaeda and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</li><li>EIA STEO: US EIA cuts its 2019 forecast for world oil demand growth by 100K BPD, and now forecasts 900k BPD y/y increase; it cut its 2020 world oil demand growth view by 30k, now seeing 1.4mln BPD y/y increase. In terms of output, 2019 US Crude output is set to rise by 1.25mln BPD to 12.24mln BPD (Prev. month 1.28mln BPD increase), while 2020 US Crude output is seen rising 990k BPD to 13.23mln BPD (Prev. month 13.26mln BPD). NOTE: the IEA is expected to cut its world oil demand forecast by around 100k as well, according to its chief Birrol on Monday. Meanwhile, OPEC's SecGen Barkindo on Tuesday said OPEC's world oil demand forecasts have been conservative, and he saw no recession ahead, suggesting that the cartel might not join the EIA and IEA in cutting their demand view.</li><li>CRUDE: The crude complex was higher in early trade on Tuesday, with traders continuing to cite the new Saudi energy minister's commitment to the supply curb pact as a key pillar supporting oil. However, there was negative ticks in the complex on news that US President Trump had sacked adviser John Bolton, considered a hawk. Analysts said that this may potentially open up a more constructive tone on foreign policy and on trade talks. It also suggests that a meeting between the US and Iran at this month's UN conference becomes a more realistic possibility, and may contribute to the geopolitical risk premium being priced out of (or to a lesser extent) within the crude complex.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>G10</strong></p><p>Little deviation in Usd/major pairings, but some currencies have pared worst losses and others swapped positions. Of note, the Swedish Krona has rebounded from 10.7740+ peaks against the single currency as Riksbank Governor Ingves played down softer than expected inflation again and contended that prospects of a major slowdown in growth are low. In short, guidance for a further 25 bp hike late this year or in early 2020 remain intact and Eur/<strong>SEK</strong> has retreated towards 10.7150 alongside Eur/<strong>NOK </strong>from 9.9200 or so to sub-9.8900, with the Norwegian Crown also regrouping after weaker than forecast headline and core CPI data.</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All moderately firmer vs the Greenback that remains rangebound overall (<strong>DXY </strong>still hovering just below 98.500 within a relatively narrow 98.465-260 band), with the Franc eying resistance/offers at 0.9900 and Cable back up over 1.2350, but again unable to reach stops residing at 1.2385+, while Eur/Gbp pulled up before 0.8900 and not far from chart support breached though not convincingly broken earlier. Elsewhere, the Loonie got boost from better than expected Canadian housing data and firmer oil prices to revisit 1.3150 vs circa 1.3190 at the other extreme.</p><p><strong>AUD/JPY/EUR/NZD</strong></p><p>A bit more downside for the Aussie, but Aud/Usd held comfortably above the 0.6850 level as Usd/Cnh continues to consolidate off recent highs after another incremental dip in the PBoC’s official Usd/Cny midpoint fixing overnight, while the Aud/Nzd cross also crept back up towards 1.0700 as the Kiwi slipped a tad closer to 0.6400. The Yen and Euro both remained contained between 107.19-49 and 1.1059-31 in the face of somewhat contrasting BoJ and ECB sourced reports suggesting new stimulus from the former will likely be a tight call and ultimately decided at the last minute, while the latter may not decide to deliver QE this Thursday, but stagger an easing package to see how data unfolds.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>No respite for the Try as aggressive CBRT rate cut calls grow louder (500 bp among the latest in the Turkish press) and sanction jitters weigh on sentiment ahead of a joint media briefing from top US officials at 18.30BST. The Lira hit lows of around 5.7870, while the Rand and Rouble forged more gains vs the Buck in contrast circa 14.6550 and over 65.4000 at one stage, Rub deriving traction from the aforementioned rise in Brent and Zar not unduly perturbed by latest fiscal warnings from Moody’s.</p>",

Meanwhile, the Aussie and Kiwi have lost some momentum, with Aud/Usd drifting back towards 0.6850 in wake of a downturn in NAB business sentiment and dip in conditions overnight, and Nzd/Usd fading ahead of 0.6450 as Aud/Nzd meanders between 1.0645-85.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/JPY/EUR - </strong>Sterling staged another attempt to hunt out stops around 1.2385 vs the Buck and briefly crossed the 100 DMA against the Euro (0.8930), but failed to sustain momentum again amidst the ongoing UK political and Brexit paralysis. However, the ensuing Pound pull-back was arrested by more encouraging data as earnings beat consensus on a headline basis and the jobless rate eased to 3.8% from 3.9%. Note also, 2 bn option expiries in Cable at the 1.2300 strike have provided a buffer.

Meanwhile, Nigeria’s Finance Ministry notes of strong indications of an oil glut next year, and thus lowered its benchmark forecast to 55/bbl from 60/bbl. This evening will also see the release of EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook with focus on global demand growth forecasts. Looking further ahead, participants will also be eyeing the weekly API crude inventory data with markets expecting a headline drawdown of 2.5mln barrels. Elsewhere, <strong>gold prices</strong> are largely unchanged below the 1500/oz mark amid the undecisive risk tone in the market ahead of this week’s key events. Meanwhile, <strong>copper prices</strong> have seen a more pronounced downside compared to yesterday with the red-metal flirting with 2.60/lb to the downside at the time of writing.

However, the <strong>DXY </strong>remains rangebound between 98.260-463 and well within near term chart support and resistance not to mention recent highs and lows for the index.</p><p><strong>CHF/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Franc has pared some losses vs the Greenback and single currency as risk appetite wanes/falters and selling abates into key technical psychological markers, like 0.9950 in Usd/Chf and 1.1000 in Eur/Chf. Meanwhile, the Aussie and Kiwi have lost some momentum, with Aud/Usd drifting back towards 0.6850 in wake of a downturn in NAB business sentiment and dip in conditions overnight, and Nzd/Usd fading ahead of 0.6450 as Aud/Nzd meanders between 1.0645-85.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/JPY/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sterling staged another attempt to hunt out stops around 1.2385 vs the Buck and briefly crossed the 100 DMA against the Euro (0.8930), but failed to sustain momentum again amidst the ongoing UK political and Brexit paralysis. However, the ensuing Pound pull-back was arrested by more encouraging data as earnings beat consensus on a headline basis and the jobless rate eased to 3.8% from 3.9%. Note also, 2 bn option expiries in Cable at the 1.2300 strike have provided a buffer. Elsewhere, trade has been considerably more rangebound with the Loonie straddling 1.3175, Yen holding within 107.19-49 parameters and Euro stuck in a 1.1037-59 band awaiting Thursday’s ECB policy pronouncements for more direction.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes again for the Rand and Lira, as Usd/Zar continues its deep reversal from 15.0000+ towards 14.6900 regardless of more SA ratings warnings from Moody’s, but Usd/Try elevated above 5.7500 in the run up to this week’s CBRT rate verdict and heeding even more dovish calls (-500 bp touted in a Turkish paper) alongside the persistent threat of US sanctions.</p>",

The rally thus far, they argue, has been mostly a matter of investors downsizing the risk-off positions they had built up in August and, judging from our estimates of how long it will take investors to exit these positions, the bank thinks “a moment of reckoning” for the sustainability of the rally may occur sometime between 17 and 23 September. Global macro hedge funds, Nomura says, have over the last two trading days swung to taking profits on their US equity longs and US bond shorts.</li><li>Nomura highlight a noteworthy change in factor trends yesterday; trend-chasing CTAs have already swung to rebuilding their long position in US equity futures. This, the bank argues, is showing up precisely where one would expect; in a return to purchases of high-beta stocks and cyclicals. Moreover, the pattern of trading in US equities by long/short funds also indicates that these funds have pared long positions in defensive sectors while adding to long positions in cyclical sectors.</li><li>So how far might this rebound in high-beta stocks and cycles go? Nomura notes that the performance of the high-beta factor in the US stock market (high-beta longs and low-beta shorts) tends to be consistent with Chinese economic momentum, about which concerns have eased somewhat since the recently announced measures to be undertaken by Chinese policy authorities. However, until it becomes clear that China's economy is on a recovery path, the outperformance of the high-beta factor will probably be primarily a matter of exits from high-beta factor short positions that investors staked out with a bit too much haste, the bank suggests.</li><li>Nomura also note the recent move higher in UST yields, which are now above 1.64% for the 10-year; investors are increasingly backing out of long positions in US bonds taken out in August in the context of a flight to quality, observes the bank, adding that momentum-chasing algos (CTAs, risk-parity funds) are being pulled along by this trend. These systematic players seem to be loss cutting by liquidating long positions in UST futures, triggered by the recent break in 10yr UST yields above 1.56%, which is the bank’s estimate of the cost of CTAs ' net buying of TY since the beginning of August.</li></ul>",
