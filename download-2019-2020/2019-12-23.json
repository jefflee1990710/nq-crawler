The tariffs are to be lowered on 859 products, the Ministry of Finance said. Analysts suggested that the move was designed to contrast with the protectionist approach of US President Trump. The list of goods on which tariffs will be lowered included frozen pork, as China grapples with high pork prices. Others noted that China is taking measure to boost growth amid risks that GDP growth could fall sub-6.0% next year.</p><p><strong>* US DURABLE GOODS (NOV):</strong> Headline durable goods unexpectedly fell in November (-2.0% versus an expected +1.5%); the ex-transport measure was unchanged, against expectations of a small rise. The data was driven lower by defense aircraft orders; core capital goods rose a touch, with the annualised rate rising in November, which analysts at Oxford Economics said signals modestly firmer momentum approaching year-end, but not a significant change in the downbeat environment for business investment. The consultancy notes that shipments of nondefense capital goods stripping out aircrafts (which forms part of the data on business equipment which feeds into GDP) declined by 0.3% M/M, and OxEco says this could suggest another contraction in equipment spending in Q4. \"We expect industrial momentum will remain muted in 2020 amid an environment of sluggish global growth, persistent trade policy uncertainty, a US strong dollar, and subdued corporate profitability,\" Oxford Economics wrote, \"Boeing’s decision to halt production of the 737 MAX will present a continuing drag on orders.\"</p><p><strong>* US NEW HOME SALES (NOV):</strong> It was a miss, with annualised new home sales coming in at 719k in November, short of the expected 734k; additionally, October's data was revised down to 710k from an initially reported 733k. The supply of new homes, however, fell to 5.4 months from 5.5 months in October. Wells Fargo said that although this level of sales was not quite as strong as expected, strength in the NAHB/Wells Fargo Homebuilders Survey suggests that the upward trend in sales remains intact.</p><p><strong>* CANADA GDP:</strong> Canadian GDP growth declined by 0.1% M/M in October -- the first monthly decline in 8-months -- from a prior 0.1% M/M; the Street was looking for an unchanged reading. Canadian bank RBC suggests that transitory factors may be in play: \"Part (although not all) of a sharp drop in manufacturing output was due to Canadian auto-sector production shutdowns as a drop in US production tied to an autoworker strike in September and October spilled over into Canada,\" the bank explains, \"that drag might be expected to reverse in the near-term, although with the more permanent shutdown of most production at Oshawa's GM plant still to come.\" The bank also notes that not all transitory factors were on the downside in October: \"The drop in goods output was also despite a bounce-back in North Atlantic oil production that reversed a large drop earlier in the summer, but still, goods-sector output, particularly manufacturing production, has been soft for some time, both in Canada and abroad as global supply chains were impacted by rising US-China tariffs -- an easing in those tensions late this year means that headwind should ease somewhat going forward.\" RBC also believes that service-sector output appears reasonably solid still. It argues that, while consumer spending growth is modest, the 1.1% pullback in the retail sector still looks over-stated relative to household income growth trends - notwithstanding an ugly-looking employment report in Canada in November. \"But a big pullback in wholesale sales in October was also in part impacted by the auto-sector strike. Outside of those components, most service-sector industries continued to grow in October, and output among service-producers was still up 2.0% from a year ago.\" The data was of interest given the BOC has adopted a hawkish tact in recent commentary, although data has been coming in softer. RBC's own GDP model is tracking growth sub-1.00%: \"We are now tracking an increase in Q4 GDP of less than a percent, below the Bank of Canada's call for a 1.3%, and our 1.4% call,\" and adds that \"monthly economic data in Canada is notoriously volatile, but still, the softer numbers in October/November data to-date will only increase focus, including at the Bank of Canada, near-term economic data reports, and particularly whether any of the recent weakness is reversed.\"</p><p><strong>* T-NOTES (H0) SETTLE 5 TICKS LOWER AT 128-03: </strong>Yields were higher across the curve (by 1-3bps at settlement) in thin, holiday-trading conditions, with the T-Note future remaining within an 11 tick range; the curve was a touch flatter, however, but by under 1bps. The US' sale of 2-year notes was lacklustre, at the very least; the auction stopped on the screws, though cover was the softest in 11 years, signalling very little interest in the last 2s auction of the year. Dealer participation was beneath recent averages, directs was in line with recent averages, while the indirect bid was beneath recent averages. Note: The Treasury will also be selling USD 41bln in 5s on Tuesday, as well as USD 32bln of 7s on Thursday, with this week's auctions set to raise a net USD 31.7bln at the month-end settlement.</p><p><strong>* WTI (G0) SETTLES USD 0.08 HIGHER AT 60.52/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLES USD 0.25 HIGHER AT USD 66.39/BBL. </strong>There was a thin, holiday-feel to trade on Monday; the crude complex settled flat/slightly higher on light volumes, with desks attributing the price action to pre-holiday book-squaring. The thin liquidity saw choppy price action throughout the day, ahead of the Brent option expiry tonight which could be a factor in todays’ action, also. Earlier, the Russian energy minister said OPEC+ may gradually ease limits on production levels after Q1, though impressed that a continuation of the current arrangements was also a possibility (NOTE: Opec is due to meet on 5/6 March). One desk said that, rather than a scoop on a possible policy shift this comes across like a variation on the standard 'it's too soon to decide and all options are on the table' statement designed to respond to the question without actually revealing anything. Elsewhere, traders were keeping an eye on geopolitical events; Saudi Arabia and Kuwait reportedly could agree to renew oil output in the shared neutral zone along the border between the countries by year-end; the two would not add net supply, but would reallocate their OPEC quotas between the expanded list of fields. Meanwhile, there is still attention on Libya, where the battle for Triploi might have an impact on crude output, and additionally, attention on Iran, which is continuing with punchy rhetoric around its nuclear programme.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: SPX +0.1% at 3224, DJI +0.3% at 28552, NDX +0.2% at 8696. SECTORS: Consumer discretionary -0.1%, consumer staples -0.3%, energy +1.1%, financials -0.2%, health care +0.3%, industrials +0.6%, IT +0.3%, materials +0.4%, telecoms -0.3%, utilities -1.0%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Boeing (BA) led gains on the Dow after it's Muilenberg resigned as CEO, effective immediately as both CEO and Board Director; current Chairman Calhoun is to take over the CEO role (and retain the President role) from January 13th, with CFO Smith serving as interim CEO until then. Apache (APA) rose over 10% after it announced a JV with Total (FP FP) to explore and develop Block 58 offshore Suriname, where both parties will hold a 50% working interest; Total will pay a USD 100mln bonus as part of the deal. JD.com (JD) was among the NDX outperformers after sources suggested it is eyeing an IPO of its logistics unit, which could reportedly fetch between USD 8-10bln. Tesla (TSLA) was higher after sources said it reportedly came to an agreement with Chinese banks for a five-year loan facility of up to CNY 10bln (USD 1.4bln). Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) surged over 8% after announcing it entered into a USD 1.15bln licensing agreement with Roche (ROGN SW, RHHBY) for the latter to provide exclusive commercial rights outside the US for SRPT’s SRP-9001, an investigational gene therapy for DMD. Disney (DIS) traded in the red after its latest Star Wars movie disappointed at the box office over the weekend; although the launch was successful, it was considerably less than the opening of the prior two movies in the saga; the launch bought in USD 176mln this weekend, in line with expectations, however some had anticipated it could bring in more than USD 200mln. Uber (UBER) also traded lower after its co-founder Kalnick sold more than 90% of his stake in the company over the last seven weeks, according to filings. Carmax (KMX) continued to the downside after disappointing earnings reported on Friday.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Ranges were thin today amid holiday conditions, however, <strong>GBP</strong> continued to sell off, breaching 1.30 to the downside as the post-election slide continues (no-deal risk is coming back into pricing after the government legislated against any transition extension beyond end-2020. <strong>CAD </strong>also traded weaker after data showed the Canadian economy contracting in October; however, losses were pared throughout the session, with some suggesting it could be that the contraction was due to transitory factors. A rise in oil prices in the middle of the session might also could have contributed to the CAD’s downside, however, analysts highlight the correlation between Canadian Dollar and oil prices has somewhat dissipated recently. <strong>DXY </strong>saw choppy trade, where the weakness in the aforementioned currencies initially buoyed the buck despite poor durables data, however as CAD regained its poise, the DXY was pushed beneath its 200dma at 97.70 to turn negative. Antipodes traded firmer today, with higher copper prices said to aid the AUD. AUDUSD traded above its 200dma of 0.6903 after breaching the figure to the upside early in the morning, a level it resides around heading into the last Asia session before Christmas. <strong>EMFX</strong> was mixed and generally flat amid the holiday period, however BRL outperformed after US President Trump reportedly offered to remove a threat to impose tariffs on Brazilian steel and aluminium.</p>",

Earlier, the Russian energy minister said OPEC+ may gradually ease limits on production levels after Q1, though impressed that a continuation of the current arrangements was also a possibility (NOTE: Opec is due to meet on 5/6 March). One desk said that, rather than a scoop on a possible policy shift this comes across like a variation on the standard 'it's too soon to decide and all options are on the table' statement designed to respond to the question without actually revealing anything. Elsewhere, traders were keeping an eye on geopolitical events; Saudi Arabia and Kuwait reportedly could agree to renew oil output in the shared neutral zone along the border between the countries by year-end; the two would not add net supply, but would reallocate their OPEC quotas between the expanded list of fields. Meanwhile, there is still attention on Libya, where the battle for Triploi might have an impact on crude output, and additionally, attention on Iran, which is continuing with punchy rhetoric around its nuclear programme.</li></ul>",

The consultancy notes that shipments of nondefense capital goods stripping out aircrafts (which forms part of the data on business equipment which feeds into GDP) declined by 0.3% M/M, and OxEco says this could suggest another contraction in equipment spending in Q4. \"We expect industrial momentum will remain muted in 2020 amid an environment of sluggish global growth, persistent trade policy uncertainty, a US strong dollar, and subdued corporate profitability,\" Oxford Economics wrote, \"Boeing’s decision to halt production of the 737 MAX will present a continuing drag on orders.\"</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Canadian GDP growth declined by 0.1% M/M in October -- the first monthly decline in 8-months -- from a prior 0.1% M/M; the Street was looking for an unchanged reading. Canadian bank RBC suggests that transitory factors may be in play: \"Part (although not all) of a sharp drop in manufacturing output was due to Canadian auto-sector production shutdowns as a drop in US production tied to an autoworker strike in September and October spilled over into Canada,\" the bank explains, \"that drag might be expected to reverse in the near-term, although with the more permanent shutdown of most production at Oshawa's GM plant still to come.\" The bank also notes that not all transitory factors were on the downside in October: \"The drop in goods output was also despite a bounce-back in North Atlantic oil production that reversed a large drop earlier in the summer, but still, goods-sector output, particularly manufacturing production, has been soft for some time, both in Canada and abroad as global supply chains were impacted by rising US-China tariffs -- an easing in those tensions late this year means that headwind should ease somewhat going forward.\" RBC also believes that service-setor output appears reasonably solid still. It argues that, while consumer spending growth is modest, the 1.1% pullback in the retail sector still looks over-stated relative to household income growth trends - notwithstanding an ugly-looking employment report in Canada in November. \"But a big pullback in wholesale sales in October was also in part impacted by the auto-sector strike. Outside of those components, most service-sector industries continued to grow in October, and output among service-producers was still up 2.0% from a year ago.\" The data was of interest given the BOC has adopted a hawkish tact in recent commentary, although data has been coming in softer. RBC's own GDP model is tracking growth sub-1.00%: \"We are now tracking an increase in Q4 GDP of less than a percent, below the Bank of Canada's call for a 1.3%, and our 1.4% call,\" and adds that \"monthly economic data in Canada is notoriously volatile, but still, the softer numbers in October/November data to-date will only increase focus, including at the Bank of Canada, near-term economic data reports, and particularly whether any of the recent weakness is reversed.\"</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Dollar durable despite dire data, but Loonie limp and Sterling still swooning",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is holding up fairly well in the face of a hefty US durable goods miss vs consensus and sub-forecast new home sales, partly due to more pronounced weakness elsewhere and perhaps on bullish technical impulses as the <strong>DXY </strong>hovers around the 200 DMA (97.700) and within striking distance of the next upside chart resistance ahead of 98.000 (like the December 6 high at 97.844 and 97.850). Note also, an uptick in US Treasury yields amidst slightly less flattening may be supportive as the index hugs the top of a 97.820-578 range.</p><p><strong>CAD/GBP</strong></p><p>In contrast to its US counterpart, the Loonie is licking wounds again in wake of more downbeat Canadian data, as GDP contracted 0.1% m/m in October compared to forecasts for stagnation and extended a run of worrying economic releases ironically since December’s BoC policy meeting that was accompanied by a relatively confident or less cautious assessment of growth and the outlook. Usd/Cad appears to have broken free from the shackles of 1.3150 and is on the verge of testing last Friday’s high (1.3179) before setting sights on 1.3200. However, the Loonie is not the worst performing major on Monday given more heavy losses for the Pound as the quite remarkable post-UK election unwind continues. Cable has now lost grip/sight of the 1.3000 handle and extended its retracement to just a few pips above 1.2900 when stops were tripped on a break below last week’s base (1.2979) for a cumulative reversal of more than 6 big figures, while Eur/Gbp’s resurgence reached circa 0.8580 vs some 300 pips below at one stage well before a decent option expiry at 0.8570 (800+ mn) rolled off. No fresh fundamental catalysts, but it goes without saying that the technical landscape for Sterling is turning increasingly bearish as GE euphoria morphs back into Brexit uncertainty with a dose of no deal risk.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ahead of the G10 pack from the outset, Nzd/Usd has now eclipsed Aud/Usd to nudge the Aud/Nzd cross back down under 1.04500, as the Kiwi maintains a firmer grip of 0.6600+ status in relation to the Aussie beyond 0.6900. Nevertheless, both have inched a bit closer to nearest upside objectives in the form of mid-month peaks and Aud/Usd remains ‘comfortably’ above the 200 DMA (0.6905) amidst ongoing positivity surrounding US-China trade deal phase 1 and recent Antipodean data that has prompted some paring of RBA/RBNZ easing expectations.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The Euro has been grinding higher since the aforementioned US data, albeit belatedly, and seems poised to test the resolve and psychological will of offers at 1.1100 after surviving a downturn to the 30 DMA (1.1069), and without any option-related supply/hedging related to nearly 1 bn between the big figure and 1.1110. However, volumes are getting increasingly light and it remains to be seen whether buyers have enough conviction or interest to take on the next round number. Indeed, the Franc has been unable to pierce 0.9800 and Yen is still mired in a 109.35-53 band, while the Scandi Kronas remain mixed after the final Riskbank and Norges Bank policy meetings of the year confirmed a one more rate hike and done from the former, but a somewhat unforeseen 10 bp tightening from the latter at the end of the projected depo path. Eur/Nok is around 9.9200 vs Eur/Sek skirting with 10.4500.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Not much in terms of independent drivers or region-specific impulses, bar China’s commitment to lowering more import tariffs, regardless of whether the 1st part of the US trade accord is signed off or not, and mildly softer than anticipated Mexican inflation for 1st half of December. Hence, Usd/EM pairs have been rangy either side or in proximity to recent ranges/levels such as 7.0000 for the Yuans, 14.2500 for the Rand, 5.9400 for the Lira, 19.0000 for the Mexican Peso, 4.0800 for the Real, and last but by no means least 62.3500 for the outperforming Rouble.</p>",

Boeing’s current production of the jet is 42 per month, and some estimate its backlog will sit at 400 by the year end. Note, when Boeing announced a production cut of the jet to 42 from 52, it cut GE’s quarterly cash flow by USD 400mln. Analysts at Capital Economics highlight the decision to halt production could result in a hit to the manufacturing sector, adding if it continues they expect it to knock up to 0.5ppts annualised off of Q1 GDP if the shutdown lasted for the whole quarter, adding if they do decide to lay off workers or workers become furloughed (against the company’s initial statement) the damage could be even worse. Further, United Airlines (UAL) announced today that it has pulled the 737 MAX jet from its schedule until June. Previously the airline had the return of the jet scheduled to March. The report added to downside for Boeing (BA) which was already lower today following reports its space unit’s Starliner entered the wrong orbit to dock with the ISS, however, BoeingSpace later reported the Starline is now in safe and stable orbit, and thus pared back the losses from the UAL reports.</p>",

In terms of YTD performance in Europe – FTSE MIB stands as the winner with YTD returns of just over 30% followed by the CAC 40 (+27.3%), DAX (+26.0%) and Euro Stoxx 50 (+25.7%) whilst IBEX 35 (+13.1%) and FTSE 100 (+12.8%) reside towards the bottom end of the spectrum. State-side, Nasdaq (+34.5%) leads the YTD gains followed by S&amp;P 500 (+28.5%) and DJIA (+22.0%). Back to today’s session, FTSE 100 (+0.4%) outpaced peers as exporters benefit from a softer Sterling. Sectors also reflect an indecisive risk tone with no major standouts. In terms of individual movers: Bayer (+3.0%) rose to the top of the German index after the US government said the USD 25mln verdict on Co's Roundup case should be reversed. Lufthansa (-1.3%) shares are pressured after talks with the German Union UFO fell through and strikes are imminent, albeit the union will refrain from strike action during the busy Christmas period. Meanwhile, GSK (-0.4%) drifted off lows but remains subdued after the US FDA declined to approve Co’s long acting HIV injections after the regulator questioned the treatment’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls process but not its safety. Finally, NMC Health (+28.5%) spiked higher at the open, and have continued to strengthen, after the Co. stated it will be commencing an independent third-party review to provide additional reassurances to shareholders after activist short-seller Muddy Waters questioned the integrity of NMC’s reports.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>AUD/NZD - The Aussie and Kiwi are still outpacing their G10 rivals and jostling for top spot in the major stakes having made firmer breaches of big figures against their US counterpart, with Aud/Usd up to 0.6920 and Nzd/Usd reaching 0.6625. Both have benefited from a mixture of short covering and technical buying after recent relatively upbeat data that has reduced or rolled back RBA/RBNZ rate cut expectations. In terms of next bullish chart targets, 0.6939 looms as long as the pair holds/closes above the 200 DMA (circa 0.6905) and 0.6636 respectively.</p><p>CHF/GBP - The Franc is in bronze position and eyeing 0.9800 vs the Buck as latest weekly Swiss sight deposits suggest less active currency intervention and the Greenback drifts down from best levels generally (DXY dipping within a narrow 97.708-578 range) amidst even thinner seasonal volumes and a softer/flatter Treasury yield curve. Similarly, Sterling is trying to take advantage of the Dollar’s dip and attempting to keep hold or sight of the 1.3000 level even though no deal Brexit risks have risen with the passing of the 1st parliament vote on PM Johnson’s WAB that includes a no transition delay clause.</p><p>EUR//JPY/CAD - All more narrowly mixed against the Usd, with the single currency mired between 1.1074-88 parameters, Yen meandering from 109.35-53 and Loonie pivoting 1.3150 ahead of Canadian GDP for the month of October that is forecast to be flat, but could disappoint given a string of bleak data since this month’s BoC meeting. Back to Eur/Usd, some option expiry interest could impact in the absence of anything else and the aforementioned quiet pre-Xmas trade, as almost 1 bn rolls off at 1.1070 and from 1.1100-10.</p><p>SCANDI/EM - The Swedish Crown has slipped after another test of resistance near 10.4150 against the Euro failed to propel the Sek higher, but its Norwegian peer is extending gains through 10.0000 towards 9.9150 on the back of the Norges Bank’s gently inclined depo rate path. Elsewhere, EMs are largely going through the motions in tight bands vs the Dollar.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>A busier pm docket bodes well or at least better for debt markets that appear to have run out of inspiration and impetus after their earlier exertions. <strong>Bunds</strong> are back down nearer the base of a 171.56-88 band and <strong>Gilts</strong> and hovering just a few ticks above 132.00, while <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are a tick or so off overnight highs with the very short end still underperforming in to 2 year issuance. On that note, Italian bonds have also been lagging and below par even either side of a so-so CTZ auction and in contrast to Spanish paper that is content with constructive developments on the political front. Back to what lies ahead in the 2nd half, more housing data and the Fed’s national activity index, but the pick of the bunch and often erratic looks to be durable goods.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The energy complex remains flat/subdued amid holiday-thinned conditions</strong> after a lacklustre Asia session in light of a number of bearish supply-side factors including Friday’s increase in active rigs reported via the Baker Hughes rig count coupled with reports of a Saudi-Kuwaiti agreement to renew oil output in the shared neutral zone by year-end. WTI futures hover just above the USD 60/bbl mark whilst its Brent counterpart retains USD 66/bbl+ status at time of writing. Russian Energy Minister Novak failed to provide the complex with much impetus in early EU trade despite noting that the OPEC+ could discuss deeper oil output cut quotas at its March meeting (5th/6th) in 2020. This follows this month’s policy revision in which the cartel agreed to deeper cuts of 496k BPD starting from Q1 2020, with an extraordinary meeting in March for a review. Elsewhere, <strong>gold trades</strong> on a firmer footing with the yellow metal hovering around current session highs of ~USD 1485/oz ahead of reported trend-line resistance at ~USD 1487/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> also garnered some support from the initially softer Dollar with prices re-eying USD 2.80/lb to the upside, although the red metal’s 100 WMA rests just below the round figure at USD 2.7988/lb. Finally, <strong>Dalian iron ore</strong> rose in excess of 1.0% after key steelmaking cities in Northern China issued pollution alerts as air quality in the region deteriorates.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia and Kuwait reportedly could agree to renew oil output in the shared neutral zone along the border between the countries by year-end</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak says OPEC+ could discuss cutting oil output quotas at its March 5th/6th meeting next year.</strong> Additionally, adding that global oil supply growth is to slowdown next year, notes that Russia's oil production in 2019 was 560mln tonnes, reported via RBC TV.

In terms of YTD performance in Europe – FTSE MIB stands as the winner with YTD returns of just over 30% followed by the CAC 40 (+27.3%), DAX (+26.0%) and Euro Stoxx 50 (+25.7%) whilst IBEX 35 (+13.1%) and FTSE 100 (+12.8%) reside towards the bottom end of the spectrum. State-side, Nasdaq (+34.5%) leads the YTD gains followed by S&amp;P 500 (+28.5%) and DJIA (+22.0%). Back to today’s session, FTSE 100 (+0.4%) outpaced peers as exporters benefit from a softer Sterling. Sectors also reflect an indecisive risk tone with no major standouts. In terms of individual movers: Bayer (+3.0%) rose to the top of the German index after the US government said the USD 25mln verdict on Co's Roundup case should be reversed. Lufthansa (-1.3%) shares are pressured after talks with the German Union UFO fell through and strikes are imminent, albeit the union will refrain from strike action during the busy Christmas period. Meanwhile, GSK (-0.4%) drifted off lows but remains subdued after the US FDA declined to approve Co’s long acting HIV injections after the regulator questioned the treatment’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls process but not its safety. Finally, NMC Health (+28.5%) spiked higher at the open, and have continued to strengthen, after the Co. stated it will be commencing an independent third-party review to provide additional reassurances to shareholders after activist short-seller Muddy Waters questioned the integrity of NMC’s reports. Note: tomorrows session sees Eurex and all its derivatives closer whilst cash DAX will be shut all day – the rest of the cash bourses will see an early finish (full schedule on the Newsquawk headline feed)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>AUD/NZD </strong>- The Aussie and Kiwi are still outpacing their G10 rivals and jostling for top spot in the major stakes having made firmer breaches of big figures against their US counterpart, with Aud/Usd up to 0.6920 and Nzd/Usd reaching 0.6625. Both have benefited from a mixture of short covering and technical buying after recent relatively upbeat data that has reduced or rolled back RBA/RBNZ rate cut expectations. In terms of next bullish chart targets, 0.6939 looms as long as the pair holds/closes above the 200 DMA (circa 0.6905) and 0.6636 respectively.</p><p><strong>CHF/GBP </strong>- The Franc is in bronze position and eyeing 0.9800 vs the Buck as latest weekly Swiss sight deposits suggest less active currency intervention and the Greenback drifts down from best levels generally (DXY dipping within a narrow 97.708-578 range) amidst even thinner seasonal volumes and a softer/flatter Treasury yield curve. Similarly, Sterling is trying to take advantage of the Dollar’s dip and attempting to keep hold or sight of the 1.3000 level even though no deal Brexit risks have risen with the passing of the 1st parliament vote on PM Johnson’s WAB that includes a no transition delay clause.</p><p><strong>EUR//JPY/CAD </strong>- All more narrowly mixed against the Usd, with the single currency mired between 1.1074-88 parameters, Yen meandering from 109.35-53 and Loonie pivoting 1.3150 ahead of Canadian GDP for the month of October that is forecast to be flat, but could disappoint given a string of bleak data since this month’s BoC meeting. Back to Eur/Usd, some option expiry interest could impact in the absence of anything else and the aforementioned quiet pre-Xmas trade, as almost 1 bn rolls off at 1.1070 and from 1.1100-10.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM </strong>- The Swedish Crown has slipped after another test of resistance near 10.4150 against the Euro failed to propel the Sek higher, but its Norwegian peer is extending gains through 10.0000 towards 9.9150 on the back of the Norges Bank’s gently inclined depo rate path. Elsewhere, EMs are largely going through the motions in tight bands vs the Dollar.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>A busier pm docket bodes well or at least better for debt markets that appear to have run out of inspiration and impetus after their earlier exertions. <strong>Bunds</strong> are back down nearer the base of a 171.56-88 band and <strong>Gilts</strong> and hovering just a few ticks above 132.00, while US Treasuries are a tick or so off overnight highs with the very short end still underperforming in to 2 year issuance. On that note, Italian bonds have also been lagging and below par even either side of a so-so CTZ auction and in contrast to Spanish paper that is content with constructive developments on the political front. Back to what lies ahead in the 2nd half, more housing data and the Fed’s national activity index, but the pick of the bunch and often erratic looks to be durable goods.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>The energy complex remains flat/subdued amid holiday-thinned conditions after a lacklustre Asia session in light of a number of bearish supply-side factors including Friday’s increase in active rigs reported via the Baker Hughes rig count coupled with reports of a Saudi-Kuwaiti agreement to renew oil output in the shared neutral zone by year-end. <strong>WTI</strong> futures hover just above the USD 60/bbl mark whilst its <strong>Brent</strong> counterpart retains USD 66/bbl+ status at time of writing. Russian Energy Minister Novak failed to provide the complex with much impetus in early EU trade despite noting that the OPEC+ could discuss deeper oil output cut quotas at its March meeting (5th/6th) in 2020. This follows this month’s policy revision in which the cartel agreed to deeper cuts of 496k BPD starting from Q1 2020, with an extraordinary meeting in March for a review. Elsewhere, gold trades on a firmer footing with the yellow metal hovering around current session highs of ~USD 1485/oz ahead of reported trend-line resistance at ~USD 1487/oz. Copper also garnered some support from the initially softer Dollar with prices re-eying USD 2.80/lb to the upside, although the red metal’s 100 WMA rests just below the round figure at USD 2.7988/lb. Finally, Dalian iron ore rose in excess of 1.0% after key steelmaking cities in Northern China issued pollution alerts as air quality in the region deteriorates.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat mixed as the region once again fails to fully join in on the Christmas cheer which had propelled Wall Street to fresh record highs on Friday, with volumes light heading into the holidays. ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) are varied with Australia dragged by commodity-related losses and due to the adverse effects of its recent currency appreciation, while the Japanese benchmark remains afloat but with upside capped by an indecisive JPY and after Japanese Chief Cabinet Suga clarified that they have not eased export controls on South Korea. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) lack conviction despite the announcement that China is to lower import tariffs for some products beginning January 1st and after the recent Trump-Xi call in which they were said to have conducted a very good talk regarding the China trade deal, although reports further noted that Chinese President Xi stated US interference is harming China’s interests and there were also downward revisions to November trade data including a wider contraction in Exports of -1.3% (Prev. -1.1%).</p><p>In FX markets, price action has all but dried out owing to the lack of tier-1 data releases and lighter volumes heading into the holidays in which the DXY is little changed as its major counterparts are mixed, with EUR/USD languishing after its recent slip to below 1.1100 and with GBP/USD off Friday’s worst levels but struggling to retain the 1.3000 handle after the House of Commons overwhelmingly voted to approve the second reading of PM Johnson's Brexit deal through a 358 v 234 vote, which sets up the bill debate for January. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses mirror the mixed risk appetite, while AUD/USD and NZD/USD slightly outperform after having reclaimed the 0.6900 and 0.6600 handles respectively in the aftermath of the recent encouraging data releases across the Tasman, although some analysts remain unconvinced including JPMorgan which sees potential QE by the RBA in Q4 2020.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued and languish firmly below the 152.00 level after the recent bear-flattening in USTs and with demand also dampened by the lack of BoJ presence in the market today.&nbsp;</p>",
