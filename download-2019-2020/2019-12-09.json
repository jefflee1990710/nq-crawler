ArQule (ARQL) doubled in value after Merck (MRK) agreed to acquire it for USD 2.7bln to deepen its cancer treatment offerings; on a similar vein, Synthorx (THOR) nearly tripled in value after Sanofi (SAN FP, SNY) agreed to acquire it for USD 2.5bln, giving the French giant access to the lucrative THOR-707 solid tumour treatment. The flurry of M&amp;A helped the biotech sector (XBI) continue its recent strength; Bristol-Myers (BMY) also made solid gains after presenting a slew of promising data over the weekend. Canopy Growth (CGC) surged after appointing Constellation Brands (STZ) CFO as its new CEO, with desks noting the growing likelihood of STZ making a full ownership bid. PG&amp;E (PCG) surged on its USD 13.5bln settlement agreement with fire victims, clearing the way for finalizing its bankruptcy plan. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) benefitted from stronger metals prices. SPX -0.32% at 3136; NDX -0.4% at 8363; DJIA -0.38% at 27910.</p><p>Yields were little changed in the TPLEX, ahead of a key week for event risk (Fed, ECB, and the looming 15th December US/China tariff deadline); it has seen a cautious start to the week. Major curve spreads had a bias towards narrowing, though the size of the moves is within 2bps. The US Treasury today sold a new 3-year note (USD 38bln), which stopped through by 0.2bps. Cover came in above recent averages; the direct bid and the indirect bid were fairly steady, though directs stepped up participation. On Tuesday, the UST will re-open 10-year (USD 24bln, Tue) and a 30-year bond (USD 16bln, Wed), for a total of USD 78bln of supply in the week; there will be USD 26bln of cash via redemptions and coupon payments, implying net new cash around USD 54bln. BMO notes that this collateral will settle on Monday, December 16, and it sees parallels between these dynamics and those in the lead up to the repo volatility on September 16. \"The parallels between the two dates are striking: both are Monday’s with USD 54bln in new coupon supply, and large expected corporate tax payments.\" BMO also notes that in each of the last three years, the December corporate tax payment was larger than the September, though this need not necessarily be the case. \"Of course, the repo world is significantly different than just three months ago – with hundreds of billions of Fed injections having occurred over the intervening period,\" and net, BMO expects slight upward pressure on funding costs, but nothing close to what we saw around the last large corporate tax payment. \"Instead, attention rightfully should focus on the upcoming year-end funding squeeze.

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>SNAPSHOT: Equities lower, Treasuries up, Crude down, Dollar down.</strong></li><li><strong>REAR VIEW: USMCA deal close; weak China trade data; decent German trade data; Japan GDP in Q3 revised up significantly.</strong></li><li><strong>COMING UP: RBA’s Lowe; China CPI/PPI, UK data; Germany ZEW; EU General Affairs Council.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>* </strong>M<strong>ARKET WRAP: </strong>The US day began on a note of caution, with traders citing soft China trade data, which highlights the fallout from trade wars, as well as key risk events in the week (Fed, ECB) and the looming 15th December US tariff deadline (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-us-tariff-deadline-of-15th-december-2019-approaches-09-12-2019\">see our analysis here</a>). The fixed income complex was on the front foot, with the curve having a bias towards flattening, while equity futures were mostly horizontal; activity currencies were under also pressure (AUD stood out, after the China data), while gold was firmer. There has been positive newsflow on the USMCA, and while headliens were supporting MXN and CAD, there was little follow-through in other risk assets.</p><p><strong>* USMCA: </strong>US and Mexican negotiators are reportedly \"very close\" to finalizing the USMCA, a Washington-based source told Reuters on the weekend. House Speaker Pelosi still needed to agree on revisions to the pact; Democrats have concerns over the enforcement of labour and environmental provisions in the current draft. Mexico's deputy foreign minister Seade has also stated a deal was close, and he is likely to return to Washington on Monday to continue talks; on Friday, Seade said that many issues still needed to be resolved. Reuters' report added that one point of contention is over steel, after USTR Lighthizer made a last-minute demand for a revised definition of what would constitute 'North American steel' under automotive rules of origin. Meanwhile, US President Trump on the weekend tweeted that if Speaker Pelosi, \"doesn’t move quickly\" to approve the deal, it \"will collapse!\" On Monday, Mexico President Lopez Obrador said Mexican Senators had accepted proposed changes to USMCA, and it was now up to US now to make the next move; Obrador 'respectfully requested' US House Speaker Pelosi make a decision about USMCA. Later, US Labour Leader Trumka said there was an agreement on the USMCA, with the deal including major victories for labour, suggesting passage could be smooth. The report was followed up with sources reports stating the deal could be finalised within 24 hours. However, a Senior Democratic Aide noted the Democrats are still studying the deal and ultimately, Pelosi is to make the final decision. CNBC later stated a tentative deal h as been agreed on USMCA, according to sources, who note the House could vote on the deal on 18th December.</p><p><strong>* CHINA NOV TRADE BALANCE: </strong>China's November trade surplus narrowed to USD 38.73bln (exp. USD 46.30bln, prev. USD 42.81bln); exports shrank for the fourth consecutive month (-1.1% Y/Y, exp. +1.0%), highlighting pressures manufacturers are facing from the US/China trade war, though the growth in imports may be a sign that Beijing's stimulus efforts are helping (+0.3% Y/Y, the first Y/Y growth since April; exp. -1.8% Y/Y) – analysts will be monitoring whether this trend is sustained in the data ahead. Meanwhile, some calculations inferred the trade surplus with the US narrowed to USD 24.60bln versus USD 26.45bln in October.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA:</strong> The Chinese government has ordered all departments to remove all foreign hardware and software within the next three years, the FT reported. Last week issued some tariff waivers for imports of US soybeans and pork, traders said Chinese importers were to begin purchases of US soybeans for January/February shipments, with at least two cargoes (120k tonnes) sold to China. This figure was later updated to show 5 cargoes have been purchased by Chinese Importers which equates to roughly 300k tonnes of US soybeans.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY TRADE BALANCE:</strong> The trade surplus widened in October to EUR 20.6bln (it was expected to narrow to 19.0bln from 19.2bln). Exports began Q4 in decent fashion, rising 1.2% M/M, which analysts were more encouraged by given the 1.5% M/M rise in September. Imports were flat. \"Net trade boosted GDP growth significantly in Q3, so mean reversion points to a setback in Q2, but we concede that the October data point to resiliency,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \"the monthly data have been a poor guide to the quarterly GDP numbers this year, so we are less certain than usual about the underlying trend; at the very least we need to see more data, especially on import and export prices, which usually are a key driver of the deflated GDP net trade data.\" Pantheon says that one thing that is clear now though is that net exports will look better in 2019 than 2018.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE SENTIX:</strong> The headline EU Sentix Index printed +0.7 in December, beating expectations of -4.9 from -4.5. The rise came despite some jitters in equity markets at the beginning of the month, with the headline underpinned by rises in expectations (back above zero) and the current situation index. Analysts said the data signals investors may be regaining confidence, and if it is sustained, may knock-on to other confidence indicators.</p><p><strong>* JAPAN Q3 GDP:</strong> The final reading saw a significant upward revision to Japanese GDP in Q3, printing 1.8% Q/Q annualised (vs. expected +0.6%; +0.4% Q/Q from +0.2%). The revisions were driven by stronger capital investment and private consumption.</p><p><strong>* BOJ:</strong> The BOJ may offer a bleaker assessment on factory output than in October at its meeting on 19th December, sources told Reuters, underscoring its concern over the broadening fallout from the US/China trade war, and slowing global demand. The article noted that a downgrade in the BOJ’s view on factory output, considered a key driver of growth, will cast doubt on its argument that Japan’s economy will sustain a moderate expansion as robust domestic demand make up for weak exports. On Thursday, the BOJ’s quarterly Tankan survey is expected to show large manufacturers remain under pressure, with the street looking for the lowest print in seven years. The two key metrics to monitor are the Large Manufacturers Index (Seen coming in at 2 vs 5 in Q3), though the Large-Non-Manufacturers Index will also be important (seen at 16 vs 21 in Q3). The data will be framed in the context of the domestic spending situation, which has taken a hit from the consumption tax hike in the quarter, and exports continue to take a hit from trade wars.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLES USD 0.18 LOWER AT USD 59.02; BRENT (G0) SETTLES USD 0.14 LOWER AT USD 64.25:</strong> Crude markets have been consolidating from their multi-month highs made on the back of the OPEC+ meeting last week. The benchmarks were offered in the Asia/European session on the back of weaker trade data out of China, although below the headline, the world’s largest crude importer actually increased its imports of oil on the month; Citi energy analysts go on to highlight the rolling 12-month crude oil import average remains robust, indicative of its demand. The bank also notes the market is taking some time to digest the recent OPEC+ production cuts, where coverage has been presenting the deal as a bullish surprise, but follow-through demand has been limited as of yet, seeing the cut as a defensive move that reduces, rather than eliminates, an H1 2020 surplus. Looking ahead to this week’s energy inventories, current expectations see crude stocks drawing 3.1mln bbls, distillates building 1.8mln bbls and gasoline building 2.7mnl bbls; Genscape forecast Cushing stocks drawing 2.3mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.32% at 3136; NDX -0.4% at 8363; DJIA -0.38% at 27910. </strong>SECTORS: consumer staples +0.15%, consumer discretionary +0.1%, materials -0.1%, energy -0.25%, telecoms -0.3%, financials -0.3%, industrials -0.35%, communications -0.4%, IT -0.5%, utilities -0.5%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> ArQule (ARQL) doubled in value after Merck (MRK) agreed to acquire it for USD 2.7bln to deepen its cancer treatment offerings; on a similar vein, Synthorx (THOR) nearly tripled in value after Sanofi (SAN FP, SNY) agreed to acquire it for USD 2.5bln, giving the French giant access to the lucrative THOR-707 solid tumour treatment. The flurry of M&amp;A helped the biotech sector (XBI) continue its recent strength; Bristol-Myers (BMY) also made solid gains after presenting a slew of promising data over the weekend. Canopy Growth (CGC) surged after appointing Constellation Brands (STZ) CFO as its new CEO, with desks noting the growing likelihood of STZ making a full ownership bid. PG&amp;E (PCG) surged on its USD 13.5bln settlement agreement with fire victims, clearing the way for finalizing its bankruptcy plan. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) benefitted from stronger metals prices.</p><p><strong>* BROKER MOVES:</strong> Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks (SWKS) both benefitted from a double upgrade to Buy at BofAML on anticipation of 5G opportunities. 3M (MMM) opened on the back foot on a Citi downgrade, although did pare somewhat through the session, whilst Fortive (FTV) was firmer after the same analyst upgraded it due to it being a more worthy competitor when selecting an industrial amid the recent downturn. Macy’s (M) underperformance intensified as Goldman downgraded the retailer suggesting a troubled outlook, Barron’s also mentioned the name negatively.</p><p><strong>* CANADA HOUSING STARTS:</strong> Canadian housing starts printed 201.3k in November, against an expected 205k, and a revised down prior 200.7k. Crucially, it held above the 200k level for a sixth consecutive month in November, and with another decent month for permits, home building is on course to remain firm through the turn of the year, RBC said, with the bank looking for the data to stabilise around the 200k rate seen YTD.</p><p><strong>* NORTH KOREA: </strong>North Korea state media reported it carried out a \"very important\" test at its Sohae satellite launch site, a testing facility that US officials had previously said Pyongyang had pledged to close. The exact test was not specified however it was apparently a static test of a rocket engine instead of a missile launch. Where a nuclear affairs expert at MIT highlighted if it is a static engine test for a new solid or liquid fuel missile, it is a strong signal “the door for diplomacy is quickly slamming, if it isn’t already”. US President Trump responded by tweeting NK leader Kim was \"too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way.\" On Monday, a North Korean official said US President Trump's remarks over the weekend sounded like a threat, but was a sign of fear; the official warned that Trump may need to rethink, or face catastrophic consequences. A US State Department Official later announced the US has asked the UN Security Council to discuss the latest missile launches and the possibility of an “escalatory DPRK provocation”.</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTION:</strong> Weekend polls put PM Johnson’s Conservatives between 8-15 points in front of opposition Labour ahead of Thursday’s General Election. On Tuesday at 10pm, YouGov’s final MRP model will be published – the pollster’s model accurately predicted the hung parliament in 2017; the initial reiteration this season modelled a 68 seat Tory majority (with a Conservative vote share of 43%, Labour 32%). PM Johnson said \"We are still not quite there yet and do not forget what happened in 2017. This is a close fought election\". An ICM poll on Monday saw the Tory/Labour spread narrow to 6 points, the bottom-end of the recent range. Regarding opinion polling this week, analysts note that in 2017, polls were published right up until the election day itself, and it therefore appears that polls can be published up until 2359 GMT on Wednesday; regulator OFCOM states that broadcasters may not, however, publish the results of any opinion poll on election day itself.</p><p><strong>* HOUSE IMPEACHMENT VOTE:</strong> House Speaker Pelosi last week indicated that a full House vote on impeachment will come by the end of the year; analysts think a vote could happen before 20th December, though it is possible it could come as soon as this week. The House Judiciary Committee panel will consider the specific articles of impeachment after a hearing on Monday. Lawmakers are divided along party lines (Democrats back impeachment; the Republicans do not). Looking ahead, there seems to be a very a high hurdle than any impeachment proceedings could secure the 66% of support needed in the Republican-controlled Senate.</p><p><strong>* HONG KONG: </strong>On the six-month anniversary of protests, thousands of demonstrators 8th December marched through the streets of Hong Kong, the BBC reported, the largest anti-government rally in months. Organisers claimed 800k people took part, while official figures claim 183k participated -- some commentators said the size of the crowd suggested that the victory of pro-democracy candidates in local elections a fortnight ago has not quelled concerns about HK's pro-China leadership and lack of political autonomy. The march was organised by The Civil Human Rights Front, a pro-democracy group, the first such protest by that group to receive police approval since August.</p><p><strong>* PBOC:</strong> PBOC adviser Liu Shijin said China’s potential economic growth could be between 5-6% over the next five years. China's monetary policy was already quite loose, Liu said, and attempting to stoke above potential growth could cause the economy to 'fall off a cliff'. Chinese growth slowed to 6.0% in Q3 amid slowing domestic demand and the US/China trade war, the weakest rate in almost three decades, and at the bottom of the government's 6.0-6.5% target range. China has resisted mass stimulus due to financial stability risks and high levels of debt; PBOC governor Yi Gang last week reiterated the central bank would not resort to QE, and reiterated a commitment to maintaining a prudent monetary policy.</p><p><strong>* ESKOM:</strong> State utility Eskom announced stage four power cuts after a few days of rolling blackouts (sources see load shedding could move to level six of eight); Eskom said it expects load shedding to continue for the rest of the week due to technical issues. NOTE: Stage four is the most severe that SA has experienced, including four hours of blackouts daily. Later, it was reported load shedding will move to stage six from 18:00 local time today. Desks note that the more severe the power cuts are, the more impact you'd expect to see on SA's Q4 GDP growth.</p><p><strong>* US/FRANCE: </strong>FinMin Le Maire said France is ready to challenge US President Trump at the WTO over his threat to slap tariffs on French goods in retaliation for a French digital tax on tech companies. Le Maire said France was willing to discuss a global digital tax with the US at either the OECD or EU level, adding that new EU economy commissioner Gentiloni had already proposed to restart talks. The EU Commission has recently said it would \"react as one and remain united\" with France, as it does in any trade matter.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLE 3 TICKS HIGHER AT 129-00. </strong>Yields were little changed in the TPLEX, ahead of a key week for event risk (Fed, ECB, and the looming 15th December US/China tariff deadline); it has seen a cautious start to the week. Major curve spreads had a bias towards narrowing, though the size of the moves is within 2bps. The US Treasury today sold a new 3-year note (USD 38bln), which stopped through by 0.2bps. Cover came in above recent averages; the direct bid and the indirect bid were fairly steady, though directs stepped up participation. On Tuesday, the UST will re-open 10-year (USD 24bln, Tue) and a 30-year bond (USD 16bln, Wed), for a total of USD 78bln of supply in the week; there will be USD 26bln of cash via redemptions and coupon payments, implying net new cash around USD 54bln. BMO notes that this collateral will settle on Monday, December 16, and it sees parallels between these dynamics and those in the lead up to the repo volatility on September 16. \"The parallels between the two dates are striking: both are Monday’s with USD 54bln in new coupon supply, and large expected corporate tax payments.\" BMO also notes that in each of the last three years, the December corporate tax payment was larger than the September, though this need not necessarily be the case. \"Of course, the repo world is significantly different than just three months ago – with hundreds of billions of Fed injections having occurred over the intervening period,\" and net, BMO expects slight upward pressure on funding costs, but nothing close to what we saw around the last large corporate tax payment. \"Instead, attention rightfully should focus on the upcoming year-end funding squeeze.\"</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The greenback remains around Friday’s levels after the dust settled following the latest jobs report. Ranges for the dollar index were thin trading in between 97.56 and 97.72 as participants eye key risk events later in the week, with FOMC, UK Election and December 15th China tariffs looming.</p><p><strong>* CAD/MXN:</strong> The USMCA currencies both bid against the buck today following positive developments on the USMCA front where Mexico Senators agreed to the changes made and the US Republicans and Democrats reportedly reached a tentative agreement, according to sources, with a vote likely on December 18th. The Loonie pared back some of Friday’s losses after a poor jobs report but still remains worse off with USDCAD breaching 1.3225 to the downside from highs of 1.3265 to find support at the 55dma at 1.3221. USDMXN continues its run towards the 19-handle in December after an initial weak start of the month for the Buck (despite on Friday after the stellar jobs report, although MXN still traded firmer against the Buck) on the continued positive rhetoric regarding USMCA.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Continues to appreciate ahead of Thursday's election. The latest polls signal Tories lead Labour by a margin of between 8-15 points; attention will be on YouGov's model, released 2200 GMT on Tuesday (the model accurately predicted the 2017 election outcome). Meanwhile, betting markets imply a 75-80% probability that the Tories will win a majority, which is a little high for some, given the reliability of opinion polls.</p><p><strong>* Havens (JPY, XAU, CHF):</strong> <strong>JPY</strong> traded relatively flat against the greenback trading in a range between 108.44-67 despite a strong GDP figure from the nation and poor China trade data. <strong>XAU:</strong> Gold initially gave back some of last Friday’s losses after the NFP boost, however like JPY traded relatively flat heading into the Asia session, and is relatively unchanged going into APAC. Desks notes XAU trade may quieten down into the end of the year, but there are some suggesting that seasonality may play a role in supporting prices in January (desks note that, last year, some of that seasonal effect did start to show in December, however). <strong>CHF </strong>however was firmer against the USD, GBP and EUR amid its adjusted unemployment rate remaining unchanged in line with analyst expectations; SNB rate decision later this week.</p><p><strong>* TRY, ZAR, BRL:</strong> A livelier start for certain regional currencies like the TRY that failed to derive any support from loan-related changes to Turkish bank RRRs and the ZAR feeling more pain from Eskom power outages reaching fresh record levels. Conversely, the BRL held up well in the face of generally risk-off or jittery sentiment in the run up to the Fed, BCB, SNB and ECB this week with many anticipating a final Selic rate cut in the cycle.</p>",

The benchmarks were offered in the Asia/European session on the back of weaker trade data out of China, although below the headline, the world’s largest crude importer actually increased its imports of oil on the month; Citi energy analysts go on to highlight the rolling 12-month crude oil import average remains robust, indicative of its demand. The bank also notes the market is taking some time to digest the recent OPEC+ production cuts, where coverage has been presenting the deal as a bullish surprise, but follow-through demand has been limited as of yet, seeing the cut as a defensive move that reduces, rather than eliminates, an H1 2020 surplus. Looking ahead to this week’s energy inventories, current expectations see crude stocks drawing 3.1mln bbls, distillates building 1.8mln bbls and gasoline building 2.7mnl bbls; Genscape forecast Cushing stocks drawing 2.3mln bbls.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK'S AUCTIONS: </strong>The US Treasury will this week sell a new 3-year note (USD 38bln, Mon), a 10-year re-opening (USD 24bln, Tue) and a 30-year bond (USD 16bln, Wed), for a total of USD 78bln. This week, there will be USD 26bln of cash via redemptions and coupon payments. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>REPO VOLATILITY:</strong> BMO notes that this collateral will settle on Monday, December 16, and it sees parallels between these dynamics and those in the lead up to the repo volatility on September 16. \"The parallels between the two dates are striking: both are Monday’s with USD 54bln in new coupon supply, and large expected corporate tax payments.\" BMO also notes that in each of the last three years, the December corporate tax payment was larger than the September, though this need not necessarily be the case. \"Of course, the repo world is significantly different than just three months ago – with hundreds of billions of Fed injections having occurred over the intervening period,\" and net, BMO expects slight upward pressure on funding costs, but nothing close to what we saw around the last large corporate tax payment. \"Instead, attention rightfully should focus on the upcoming year-end funding squeeze.\"&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> BMO thinks the Treasury sell-off over the last few sessions incorporates decent concession for the 3s auction, and says the sector looks attractive on a 2s/3s/s5s butterfly, which is near the cheapest levels seen in a year. BMO notes that, seasonally, the December auction is on the strong side of neutral, with five of the last 11 in December stopping through. However, BMO cautions that a Fed pause is well reflected in market pricing, some players in the front end will be monitoring for any hawkish surprise; BMO says the dynamic could inspire some investor hesitation in adding short duration exposure until after the FOMC. BMO also notes that SOMA will not be buying today, however, general collateral is trading in line with 3s, which is unlikely to prompt any incremental demand upside. &nbsp;</p><p>RECENT 3-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY:</p><ul><li>High yield: (prev. 1.63%, six-auction avg. 1.649%)&nbsp;</li><li>Tail: (prev. -0.1bps, six-auction avg. 0.0bps)&nbsp;</li><li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.60x, six-auction avg. 2.48x)</li><li>Dealers: (prev. 29.7%, six-auction avg. 33.7%)</li><li>Direct: (prev. 16.9%, six-auction avg. 16.8%)</li><li>Indirect: (prev. 53.3%, six-auction avg. 49.5%)</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>It’s been a relatively slow grind in fairly quiet trade, but the Greenback has kicked off the new and potentially pivotal week mostly on the back foot amidst mildly softer US Treasury yields and a flatter curve after last Friday’s post-jobs data bear steepening. The DXY has meandered between 97.556-725 parameters with little impetus drawn from an uptick in employment trends in the absence of anything else on Monday’s US agenda and as attention switches to the December FOMC.</p><p><strong>CAD/MXN</strong></p><p>The Loonie has managed to rebound further from lows hit in wake of Friday’s dire Canadian labour report even though housing starts and building permits both missed consensus to add more doubt to the BoC’s improved outlook for and assessment of the domestic economy. The catalyst, positive news on the USMCA that has also lifted the Mexican Peso, as latest reports suggest a deal could be done in the next 24 hours following approval of proposed changes to the agreement by Mexico’s Senate. Usd/Cad currently probing below 1.3225 and Usd/Mxn around 19.2300 at one stage.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/EUR/NZD/JPY/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Pound remains marginally ahead of its G10 counterparts, but some distance from early Monday highs after the latest pre-UK election poll showing a narrower lead for the Conservatives over main rival and opposition party Labour. In fact, the ICM results put the gap at 6% points vs 7% previously and even smaller than the lowest weekend survey differential to leave Cable close to 1.3150 and Eur/Gbp nearer the top of a 0.8426-0.8394 band, as the single currency consolidated above 1.1050 against the US Dollar. Meanwhile, the Franc pared losses and reclaimed parity+ status, but the Yen lost momentum on unwinding safe-haven flows, as Usd/Jpy rebounded from sub-108.50 and well ahead of technical support at 108.23. Elsewhere, the Antipodeans remain mixed with the Aussie still lagging on Chinese growth trade jitters after data and ahead of US import tariff deadline day, as Aud/Usd remained under 0.6850 in contrast to Nzd/Usd holding firm above 0.6550 and the Aud/Nzd cross hovering just over the 1.0400 mark.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The Scandi Kronas have extended declines with Eur/Sek back above 10.5500 at one stage and Eur/Nok up over 10.1300 on the back of technically delayed and mixed monthly Norwegian GDP for October (mainland growth feeble vs more robust oil-fuelled expansion offshore).</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A livelier start for certain regional currencies like the Try that failed to derive any support from loan-related changes to Turkish bank RRRs and the Zar feeling more pain from Eskom power outages reaching fresh record levels. Conversely, the Brl held up well in the face of generally risk-off or jittery sentiment in the run up to the Fed, BCB, SNB and ECB this week with many anticipating a final Selic rate cut in the cycle.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Christine Lagarde's first meeting as ECB President is not expected to deliver any material changes to current monetary policy settings, given that the September easing measures are yet to take full effect, and there is no urgency to add further accommodation at this stage as the ECB assesses the impact of its September easing. The focus will therefore fall on how Lagarde intends to run the central bank, and its upcoming strategic policy review, which will likely be formally announced at the December confab; but there is a risk that this meeting will be light on details, which may possibly result in horizontal price action. Many believe Lagarde's first task will be uniting a divided Governing Council, where there are mixed views on the efficacy and risks of loose(r) policy, as well as the practicalities of the ECB’s decision-making functions. Lagarde is also expected to reiterate her call on fiscal authorities to do more to support the Eurozone economy. Elsewhere, updated economic projections may see near-term growth forecasts nudged up slightly, though further forecasts are subject to downside risks; inflation forecasts are seen little changed. ECB Monetary Policy Decision Due At 12:45GMT, (13:45CET, 07:45ET), On Thursday 12th December 2019, Press Conference Due At 13:30GMT, (14:30CET, 08:30ET). <strong>To download the report, please click </strong><a href=\"/research_sheets/23428/download\"><strong>here.</strong></a></li><li>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.

(Newswires)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>European equities kick the week off broadly lower, albeit marginally [Eurostoxx 50 -0.2%] after the NFP optimism waned and as sub-par Chinese data dented the mood. Sectors are mostly in the red – and with no clear standouts and little by way of a split between cyclicals and defensives to reflect the risk tone, although material names are underpinned by the Friday’s surge in base-metal prices. In terms of individual movers: Osram Licht (+14.4%) soared to the top of the pan-EU index after AMS (-3.0%) announced it has succeeded on its second attempt with a EUR 4.6bln bid for Osram which comes after it lowered the necessary acceptance rate to 55% vs. Prev. 62.5%. Elsewhere, Tesco shares (+5.4%) are supported after confirming exploration of options for its Thai and Malaysian units (which account for 10% of Co’s sales), including a possible sale which could fetch up to USD 9bln. Meanwhile, Just Eat (+0.5%) shares are underpinned after Prosus increased its offer for the Co. to GBP 7.40/shr, valuing the Co. at approx. GBP 5.1bln; additionally, acceptance level for the deal has been reduced to a simple majority. Number 10 shareholder Cat Rock (owns 2.6% of Just Eat) noted that Prosus’ offer needs to be at least GBP 9.25.shr to compete with Takeaway.com’s offer. Takeaway.com believe that their offer for the Co. remains ‘far superior’ to the Prosus one. On the flip side, Tullow Oil (-59.0%) shares plummeted after the Co. was hit by a double whammy in the form of a production outlook downgrade and the departure of its CEO. Other downside movers include the likes of Sanofi (-0.5%) and Kerry Group (-0.9%) – both on M&amp;A news – with the former acquiring Synthorx for USD 2.5bln, whilst the latter is reportedly mulling acquiring DuPont’s Nutrition business – which could be valued around USD 25bln.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>GBP -</strong> Sterling is off best levels, but still firmly bid as the clock ticks down to Thursday’s GE and polls continue to flag victory for the Tories, albeit to varying degrees and ahead of the final YouGov MRP due to be published tomorrow evening.

        "analysis_details": "<ul><li>Tariffs on the remaining USD c.160bln worth of Chinese imports to the US could take effect if US President Trump is not satisfied with progress in trade talks with China by 15th December 2019. The 15% duties would largely target consumer goods, including mobile phones, laptop and desktop computers, toys and clothing.</li><li>China demands the US remove existing tariffs imposed on around USD 375bln worth of its exports to the US, and cancel the impending tariff hike on 15th December; the US demands China commit to specific minimum purchases of US agricultural products, and make concessions on intellectual property rights, currency and access to China’s financial services sectors.</li><li>To judge how much is priced in for US/China tariffs, UBS suggests keeping an eye on TY risk reversals as a rates gauge for US-China and economic fundamental sentiment; it notes that the lows in August marked peak negative sentiment around data and US-China, while the highs in November signalled some data stabilization and Phase 1 deal expectations along with hopes of current tariff rollback. UBS says that adjusted for economic data being less worse than in August, the range between -0.7 and +0.4 should provide guideposts here of where Phase 1 deal expectations becomes stretched one way or the other.</li><li>Desks are on the lookout for two key catalysts: 1) Any indication that the US would delay the 15th December tariff boost, or any more warmer noises on potential tariff rollbacks; 2) any commentary which suggests that the two sides are preparing to meet face-to-face, which may signal agreement on a deal ‘in principle’.</li><li>Elsewhere, analysts are also watching the US/China dynamic outside of trade to assess the likelihood a deal can be agreed. Last month President Trump signed a bill mandating an annual review to check if Hong Kong has enough autonomy to justify its special status with the US, in a sign of support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Last week, the House passed legislation to sanction any Chinese officials connected to the alleged human rights violations of Uighurs (Senate will likely do the same soon). These issues have angered Chinese officials, some suggest that while they have not derailed trade talks, how these and other issues outside of trade are resolved could be key in determining the success of the trade negotiations.</li></ul>",

Gilts resumed Liffe just above 132.00 and regrouped after an early wobble that pushed prices down to 131.95, with the bounce strong enough to lift the 10 year bond into chart resistance between 123.23-28, though not sufficient to clear the zone and test a stronger upside objective at 133.35 (last Wednesday’s intraday peak and close to the 50 DMA). Domestic markets have more than one eye on the upcoming election and Sterling’s resurgence as polls point to an outright win for PM Johnson’s Conservative Party. Hence, relative underperformance in UK debt and along the 3 month strip on the premise that even a slim majority for the Tories is better than a hung parliament and yet more Brexit inaction.</p>",

No visible reaction to a larger than expected German trade surplus, but risk sentiment has been ruffled by another drop in exports from China that confounded the consensus for a rebound and more than offset a surprise rise in imports to leave the surplus short of the median estimate. Bunds are now looking elsewhere for further inspiration and direction, as EU cash bourses return to the fray on the back foot, albeit modestly, while the technical backdrop remains constructive above 172.00 and support around 172.12 on some charts vs resistance between 172.44-46.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly positive as they react to Friday’s stellar US NFP report but with some hesitation after mostly weaker than expected Chinese trade data including a surprise contraction in Exports and heading into a risk-packed week. ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) saw a firm start to the session led by outperformance in energy names following the OPEC+ agreement to deepen output curbs by 500k bpd and Saudi pledge of an additional voluntary cut of 400k bpd, although both indices briefly retraced the majority of their gains amid heavy losses in Australia’s gold miners in the wake of the blockbuster US jobs data and with recent JPY strength suppressing the effect of a firm upward revision to Q3 GDP. Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are indecisive after the largely disappointing Chinese trade data and as China continued to voice discontent with US “interference” regarding the Hong Kong protests and Uighur Muslims. Furthermore, China reportedly denied entrance into Macau for the President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and have also ordered government offices and public institutions to remove all foreign computer equipment and software in 3 years.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY holds on to the majority of its data-driven gains after the Non-Farm Payrolls bonanza, surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate and firmer than expected Average Earnings, although price action has since quietened amid mixed trade in the greenback’s major counterparts and as participants look towards this week’s risk events including FOMC, ECB and UK General Election. EUR/USD remains subdued from Friday’s losses but with downside stemmed as the 1.1050 level provides a floor and GBP/USD extends on its rebound from support at 1.3100 after most of the recent polls showed a wider lead for the Conservatives going into Thursday’s election. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are flat amid the mostly positive risk tone and encouraging Q3 GDP revisions, while antipodeans are kept lacklustre by the soft Chinese data and weaker PBoC reference rate setting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid spill-over selling from T-notes and with the pressure also a function of the gains in stocks, firm GDP revisions and tepid BoJ Rinban announcement valued at JPY 180bln.</p>",
