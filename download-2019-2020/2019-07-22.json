        "content": "<p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p><p>US trade negotiators are reportedly likely to visit China next week for first face-to-face meeting since the G20, according to sources. Furthermore, the report added that talks to reach a deal to end the trade war are still expected to take a significant amount of time and that the initial arrangements for the meeting in Beijing came after the US announced it would offer exemptions to 110 Chinese products earlier this month. (Newswires)</p><p>BoJ's Kuroda said it is not easy to continue powerful measures for a long time and that powerful monetary easing has boosted demand by lowering real interest rates although it is taking time to overcome low inflation. Kuroda warned on the risks of prolonged low interest rates where banks could become less profitable and reduce lending but he does not think this risk is currently showing in Japan, while he also noted that with zero lower bound for short-term interest rates, it might be better to directly affect long-term rates through large-scale asset purchases. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p>A cross-party group of MPs and peers is seeking a ruling in Scotland’s Court of Session to ensure the next PM cannot suspend parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. (Independent)</p><p>UK House Speaker Bercow turned down Sir Alan Duncan's request for an emergency vote tomorrow following the announcement of the new PM to test if a majority can be held, according to BBC's Political Editor Kuenssberg. (Twitter/BBC)</p><p>Labour peers decided not to hold vote of no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn. (Politics Home)</p><p>Irish Foreign Minister Covaney reiterated hope that the incoming UK PM can take an innovative approach to the declaration on the future relationship and that the EU withdrawal agreement is fair, balanced and is not going to change. (Newswires)</p><p>UK Trade Secretary Fox said the new PM and Cabinet may take a different view on the No Deal tariff schedule published in March and said \"they can be changed\" as a warning to Canada that “the worst happens and we introduce trade frictions”, according to BBC’s Faisal Islam. Faisal Islam also tweeted that several US Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee raised the potential blocking of a US-UK trade deal to UK Trade Secretary Fox if Brexit saw a hardening of Irish border or impact on the Good Friday agreement. (Twitter/BBC)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p><p>UK Foreign Minister Hunt said Iran had no right to board the UK vessel which was an act of piracy and urged Iran to release the vessel and its crew. Hunt added that there is no comparison between seizure of the tanker and EU sanctions. Hunt added UK will seek to put together a European led maritime mission as well as compliment US proposals in the area of maritime security, while he also suggested that if Iran continues on this dangerous path they must accept the price of a larger western military presence along their coastline. (Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump said he is going to sit back and wait with regards to Iran and reiterated ‘we’ll see what happens’, while he added it is getting harder for him to make a deal and that it could go either way very easily. (Newswires)</p><p>US imposed sanctions on Chinese company Zhuhai Zhenrong for transporting Iranian crude oil. (WSJ)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>US President Trump tweeted that with almost no inflation, the US is needlessly being forced to pay a much higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided Federal Reserve and that quantitative tightening is continuing to make it harder for the US to compete. Furthermore, Trump reiterated that interest rate costs should have been much lower and that it is very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in. (Twitter)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Tech was the outperforming sector on Monday, as chipmakers rallied as White House officials agreed to meet tech executives regarding the recent Huawei ban. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), Micron Technology (MU), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor Corp. (KLAC) all caught a bid after Goldman turned positive on memory chip makers helping the tech sector, too. Facebook (FB) shares were supported initially by positive comments at Wedbush and saw further upside later in the session on reports the co. had agreed to a USD 5bn FTC settlement, a better outcome than some investors had feared. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) was supported by a sizeable PT raise at KeyBanc and Apple (AAPL) supported by positive comments from Morgan Stanley ahead of earnings.&nbsp; Elsewhere, Disney (DIS) was buoyant, after its live action remake of the Lion King exceeded expectations over the weekend. Ford (F) were weighed by reports sales in China will fall 27% in H2 2019 Y/Y, amid a downturn in the Chinese car market. AT&amp;T (T) and CBS Corp (CBS) were both under pressure on news that the two companies failed to renew their contract, which will see millions of DirecTV subscribers lose access to CBS programmes. DaVita Inc. (DVA) shot higher after the co. raised its FY19 operating guidance. Bunge Ltd (BG) moved higher premarket on the news the co. has agreed to form a new bioenergy company with BP Plc (BP LN), which will produce ethanol and sugar, while also generating renewable electricity. Notable stocks benefitting after positive broker moves; Charles Schwab (SCHW) upgraded at Well Fargo, Hershey (HSY) upgraded at UBS. Notable stocks suffering after broker downgrades; Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) downgraded at Citi, LyondellBasell (LYB) downgraded at Nomura Instinet, M&amp;T Bank (MTB) downgraded at Piper Jaffray. It was a thin day for large cap earnings; Halliburton Co. (HAL) shot higher after exceeding bottom-line expectations. S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 2985, NASDAQ-10 0.9% at 7905, Dow Jones 0.1% at 27173.</p><p>The T-plex ultimately edged higher on Monday, as participants tread carefully ahead of Thursday’s ECB meeting, where speculation is rife on when and how the ECB will provide monetary accommodation. Some constructive headlines from China over the weekend, who reportedly made goodwill gestures in trade negotiations, saw some mild pressure in government debt in the early session, but was later reversed as traders bought the dip. Bidding pressure was complimented by a surprise dip in the Chicago Fed June National Index -0.02 (exp. 0.08), as well as the overhang of geopolitics. At settlement yields were modestly negative, with the belly seeing the most pronounced action, the 5-year yield fell by just under 2bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 2 ticks higher at 127-19.</p>",

The dollar was rangebound as the market looks ahead to this week’s key risk events (as a reminder: EZ flash PMIs, on Wednesday, ECB on Thursday, US Q2 GDP prelim on Friday). The T-plex edged higher going into the US session supported by a tense geopolitical backdrop. Geopolitics was also supporting crude, albeit edging lower during US trading hours, where the UK looks to impose greater maritime security in the Persian Gulf.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Following last week reports that USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary would meet if talks went well over the phone, SCMP stated this morning negotiators are reportedly likely to visit China next week for the first face to face meeting since G20. If they were to meet it would be a positive step towards reducing the trade tensions between the two nations. According to source reports, the arrangements for the meeting came to light after the US announced it would offer exemptions on 110 Chinese products. Further adding to the positive trade tone, source reports stated China is considering a plan to boost its purchases of US Soybeans. Stratfor highlight that it remains unclear how many US agricultural goods will be purchased by China and that there is no evidence China appears willing to soften its negotiating stance. In a possible goodwill gesture from the US side, the White House convened another tech focused meeting, this time with executives from some of the US’s largest chipmakers, with the focus of the meeting on Chinese tech (i.e. regarding the Huawei ban). Separately, and on a somewhat less constructive tone, the WSJ reported that the Trump administration has imposed sanctions on a Chinese company, Zhuhai Zhenrong, for transporting Iranian crude oil in violation of existing sanctions.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>UK Foreign Minister Hunt said if Iran continues on this dangerous path, they must accept the price, a larger western military presence along their coastline. Hunt said Iran had no right to board the UK vessel (Stena Impero), which Iran seized on Friday in the Strait of Hormuz, calling it an act of piracy, whilst urging Iran to release both the vessel and its crew. The Foreign Minister added that there is no comparison between the Stena Impero seizure and the UK’s seizure of the Grace 1 vessel in Gibraltar, which was allegedly violating EU sanctions by exporting oil to Syria. The UK is now looking at implementing a European led maritime mission which will seek to compliment US proposals in regard to maritime security. On the US-Iran front, Iran announced that in 2018 it had arrested 17 Iranian individuals accused of being involved in a CIA-lead spy ring, some of whom it said had been sentenced to death. The US later denied the claims; President Trump said the claims were totally false, lies and propaganda in a tweet.</p><p><strong>* BOJ’S KURODA: </strong>BOJ's Kuroda, speaking at the IMF in Washington, largely stuck to familiar themes. Traders have been eyeing his remarks for some clues about how the Bank, whose next policy meeting is sandwiched between the ECB and Fed meetings (where both of those central banks are expected to loosen policy). Kuroda, once again, took time to highlight global uncertainties, suggesting they will be a key input into BOJ policy. The BOJ governor talked about how the BOJ's brand of negative rates might impact bank profitability if implemented for too long, however, did not see that risk at present. He argued that it might be better to directly affect long-term rates through large-scale asset purchases, hinting that further BOJ yield curve control might be focussed in the 10-year plus sector. On the inflation goal, he said that at this stage it is not necessary to change the 2% inflation goal.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 2 TICKS HIGHER AT 127-19: </strong>The T-plex ultimately edged higher on Monday, as participants tread carefully ahead of Thursday’s ECB meeting, where speculation is rife on when and how the ECB will provide monetary accommodation. Some constructive headlines from China over the weekend, who reportedly made goodwill gestures in trade negotiations, saw some mild pressure in government debt in the early session, but was later reversed as traders bought the dip. Bidding pressure was complimented by a surprise dip in the Chicago Fed June National Index -0.02 (exp. 0.08), as well as the overhang of geopolitics. At settlement yields were modestly negative, with the belly seeing the most pronounced action, the 5-year yield fell by just under 2bps.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 0.59 HIGHER AT USD 56.22/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 0.79 HIGHER AT USD 63.26/BBL: </strong>Crude prices, albeit firmer on the day amid tensions in the Persian Gulf, have been drifting lower through the US session in a similar manner to last week’s trading sessions. Iran seizing a UK shipping vessel on Friday helped the major benchmarks start the week on the front foot, as traders factored in a greater geopolitical risk premium. Gains have been modest though, with analysts at RBC noting that participants are not fully realising the severity of the risk of war in the world’s most prolific region of crude supply, and goes on to say that oil prices are a “broken barometer” in gauging risk in the region. RBC propose that USD 80/bbl in Brent could be a possibility if a “shooting war” was to break out. Elsewhere, supply disruption in Libya has has eased after a force majeure, which had been in place since Friday, was lifted at its pinnacle El Sharara oilfield (300k BPD), due to what is widely believed to be sabotage, and later reports suggested the Zawiya refinery (120k BPD) will be shut for two weeks due to power issues. August WTI futures expire on Monday and are likely to be a contributing factor to trade flow due to book squaring, analysts at Citigroup highlight. Looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventories, current expectations have crude stocks drawing 3.4mln bbls, gasoline drawing 0.8mln bbls, and distillates building 1mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.3% at 2985, NASDAQ-10 0.9% at 7905, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0.1% at 27173, SECTORS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary 0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples -0.5%, S&amp;P 500 Energy 0.4%, S&amp;P 500 Financials 0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care -0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials 0.1%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology 1.2%, S&amp;P 500 Materials -0.3%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services 0.2%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities -0.2%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tech was the outperforming sector on Monday, as chipmakers rallied as White House officials agreed to meet tech executives regarding the recent Huawei ban. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), Micron Technology (MU), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor Corp. (KLAC) all caught a bid after Goldman turned positive on memory chip makers helping the tech sector, too. Facebook (FB) shares were supported initially by positive comments at Wedbush and saw further upside later in the session on reports the co. had agreed to a USD 5bn FTC settlement, a better outcome than some investors had feared. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) was supported by a sizeable PT raise at KeyBanc and Apple (AAPL) supported by positive comments from Morgan Stanley ahead of earnings.&nbsp; Elsewhere, Disney (DIS) was buoyant, after its live action remake of the Lion King exceeded expectations over the weekend. Ford (F) were weighed by reports sales in China will fall 27% in H2 2019 Y/Y, amid a downturn in the Chinese car market. AT&amp;T (T) and CBS Corp (CBS) were both under pressure on news that the two companies failed to renew their contract, which will see millions of DirecTV subscribers lose access to CBS programmes. DaVita Inc. (DVA) shot higher after the co. raised its FY19 operating guidance. Bunge Ltd (BG) moved higher premarket on the news the co. has agreed to form a new bioenergy company with BP Plc (BP LN), which will produce ethanol and sugar, while also generating renewable electricity. Notable stocks benefitting after positive broker moves; Charles Schwab (SCHW) upgraded at Well Fargo, Hershey (HSY) upgraded at UBS. Notable stocks suffering after broker downgrades; Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) downgraded at Citi, LyondellBasell (LYB) downgraded at Nomura Instinet, M&amp;T Bank (MTB) downgraded at Piper Jaffray. It was a thin day for large cap earnings; Halliburton Co. (HAL) shot higher after exceeding bottom-line expectations.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong>&nbsp;was uninspired ahead of key risk events/data points later this week on both sides of the pond; DXY traded in thin ranges, caught between 97.13-97.29 parameters.&nbsp;<strong>EUR</strong>&nbsp;was also flat, as traders look ahead to the ECB on Thursday. Political concerns look set to continue weighing on the single currency (Italian election risk has now been joined by growing Spanish election risk; as Spanish PM Sanchez wrangles to form a new government with reluctant ally Podemos). Combined this with the possibility that the ECB could actually pull the trigger on rates this Thursday (markets are pricing a roughly 50% chance of a 10bps deposit rate cut), it comes as no surprise to see&nbsp;<strong>CHF</strong>&nbsp;continue to strengthen; EURCHF moved as low as 1.10 on the day – NOTE: SocGen last week suggested the closer EURCHF gets to 1.10, the higher the probability that the SNB will act.&nbsp;<strong>JPY</strong>&nbsp;felt less love after Japanese PM Abe’s upper house election victory stoked risk appetite during APAC hours, seeing USDJPY pop briefly back above 108.00.&nbsp;<strong>GBP</strong>&nbsp;was under pressure, perhaps unsurprisingly, ahead of frontrunner Boris Johnson’s almost inevitable conservative leadership election victory, which will likely be followed by a slew of government resignations (with the replacements likely to take a tougher stance on the EU). The&nbsp;<strong>Scandi Crowns</strong>&nbsp;both gradually lost ground, with the moves off 9.6130 and 10.5200 lows in EUR/NOK and EUR/SEK respectively appearing partly technical, although falling oil prices did little to help. On which note;&nbsp;<strong>CAD</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>RUB</strong>&nbsp;struggled, with the former also being dragged lower by poor wholesale trade data. Elsewhere in <strong>EMFX</strong>;&nbsp;<strong>ZAR</strong>&nbsp;moved back towards recent lows at 13.8100, following news that the SA Government has apportioned more financial aid for Eskom. Conversely,&nbsp;<strong>TRY</strong>&nbsp;headed back to 5.7000/USD ahead of the Thursday’s CBRT policy meeting; in which anything from a 1% to 5% ease is touted and, all the while, US President Trump is still mulling sanctions.</p>",

Political concerns look set to continue weighing on the single currency (Italian election risk has now been joined by growing Spanish election risk; as Spanish PM Sanchez wrangles to form a new government with reluctant ally Podemos). Combined this with the possibility that the ECB could actually pull the trigger on rates this Thursday (markets are pricing a roughly 50% chance of a 10bps deposit rate cut), it comes as no surprise to see&nbsp;<strong>CHF</strong>&nbsp;continue to strengthen; EURCHF moved as low as 1.10 on the day – NOTE: SocGen last week suggested the closer EURCHF gets to 1.10, the higher the probability that the SNB will act.&nbsp;<strong>JPY</strong>&nbsp;felt less love after Japanese PM Abe’s upper house election victory stoked risk appetite during APAC hours, seeing USDJPY pop briefly back above 108.00.&nbsp;<strong>GBP</strong>&nbsp;was under pressure, perhaps unsurprisingly, ahead of frontrunner Boris Johnson’s almost inevitable conservative leadership election victory, which will likely be followed by a slew of government resignations (with the replacements likely to take a tougher stance on the EU). The&nbsp;<strong>Scandi Crowns</strong>&nbsp;both gradually lost ground, with the moves off 9.6130 and 10.5200 lows in EUR/NOK and EUR/SEK respectively appearing partly technical, although falling oil prices did little to help. On which note;&nbsp;<strong>CAD</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>RUB</strong>&nbsp;struggled, with the former also being dragged lower by poor wholesale trade data. Elsewhere in <strong>EMFX</strong>;&nbsp;<strong>ZAR</strong>&nbsp;moved back towards recent lows at 13.8100, following news that the SA Government has apportioned more financial aid for Eskom. Conversely,&nbsp;<strong>TRY</strong>&nbsp;headed back to 5.7000/USD ahead of the Thursday’s CBRT policy meeting; in which anything from a 1% to 5% ease is touted and, all the while, US President Trump is still mulling sanctions.</p>",

Iran seizing a UK shipping vessel on Friday helped the major benchmarks start the week on the front foot, as traders factored in a greater geopolitical risk premium. Gains have been modest though, with analysts at RBC noting that participants are not fully realising the severity of the risk of war in the world’s most prolific region of crude supply, and goes on to say that oil prices are a “broken barometer” in gauging risk in the region. RBC propose that USD 80/bbl in Brent could be a possibility if a “shooting war” was to break out. Elsewhere, some renewed supply disruption in Libya has emerged, where a force majeure had been in place since Friday at its pinnacle El Sharara oilfield (300k BPD), due to what is widely believed to be sabotage, and later reports suggested the Zawiya refinery (120k BPD) will be shut for two weeks due to power issues. August WTI futures expire on Monday and are likely to be a contributing factor to trade flow due to book squaring, analysts at Citigroup highlight. Looking ahead to this week’s US energy inventories, current expectations have crude stocks drawing 3.4mln bbls, gasoline drawing 0.8mln bbls, and distillates building 1mln bbls.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%) </strong>and<strong> Hang Seng (-1.5%)</strong> declined despite continued liquidity efforts by the PBoC and more constructive language regarding US-China trade talks, with a rotation of funds seen into China’s new Nasdaq-style tech board known as the STAR Market which launched today and saw all of its 25 stocks surge by an average 126% in early trade and with some higher by more than 200%.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Major European indices are relatively flat [Eurostoxx 50 +0.1%],</strong> albeit near highs of the day following on from a cautious Asia-Pac trade. Sectors are mixed with outperformance seen in the energy sector amid the price action in the complex. In terms of individual movers, Philips (+4.0%) shares rose on the back of optimistic earnings whilst Julius Baer (+2.7%) shares are supported by an 8% in assets under management.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> - The index has consolidated recovery gains above the 97.000 handle within a relatively tight 97.126-247 range following the final official Fed rhetoric ahead of the pre-FOMC backout period from Bullard who reiterated his preference for a 25 bp cut instead of anything larger. Meanwhile, WSJ sources chimed in with similar ‘guidance’ as recent economic developments do not suggest an imminent downturn that would warrant bolder action, although more easy could be flagged after July, and current market pricing reflects the latest commentary with less than 20% chance of a 50 bp ease.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD</strong> - The non-US Dollars are outperforming or at least holding up better than G10 peers, with the Kiwi leading the way on favourable cross-winds as Aud/Nzd retreats through 1.0400 and Nzd/Usd holds nearer last week’s peaks than Aud/Usd between 0.6782-58 and 0.7047-32 respective bands. From a fundamental perspective, the Aussie may glean fresh direction from RBA Assistant Governor Kent later, while the Loonie will be watching Canadian wholesale trade alongside crude prices that are currently supportive and nudging Usd/Cad down through 1.3050 within 1.3068-41 parameters.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/CHF/EUR</strong> - All on the backfoot vs the Greenback, and the Pound in particular awaiting the Tory leadership result that is widely expected to see Brexit hard-liner Boris Johnson appointed as new PM and fresh Cabinet faces before the whole process of negotiating with the EU really starts again. Cable is back below 1.2500 and from a chart standpoint looking more bearish as it slips beneath last Friday’s 1.2476 base. Next up would be July 18’s 1.2429 session low, but Sterling is keeping its head just above 0.9000 vs the Euro that is only just maintaining 1.1200+ status vs the Buck ahead of preliminary PMIs on Wednesday and the ECB on Thursday. Note, the probability of a 10 bp reduction in the depo rate is 50%, while some are also looking for the QE taps to be reopened, albeit not this month. Elsewhere, the Franc is hovering just below 0.9800 and 1.0100 vs the single currency, wary that any ECB stimulus or more pronounced safe-haven gains will be countered by the SNB in some shape or form. Similarly, with this month’s BoJ policy meeting looming on the eve of the FOMC the Yen is erring towards the side of caution closer to 108.00 compared to recent highs and unlikely at this stage to arouse decent option interest sitting from 107.50 to 107.35 in 2.3 bn).</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Lira has Central Bank action to look forward to as well, but US sanctions may be back on the radar to undermine sentiment given reports that President Trump is scheduling a meeting with Republican Senators to discuss options. Meanwhile, the consensus range is suitably wide for the CBRT as estimates cover a whopping 100-500 bp easing, and Usd/Try is near the top of a 5.6925-6490 at present.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It’s been measured and slow, but steadfast all the same, as <strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>Gilts</strong> continue to claw back losses from the depths of mid-month retracement lows. In fact, it would be fair to say that the latest leg has been impressive given moves in <strong>US Treasuries</strong> that lag, with the 10 year EU debt futures up to 173.68 and 131.75 vs 171.25 and 130.14 on July 12. Indeed, the benchmarks are now only a fraction off resistance at 173.70 and 131.83 that stand in the way of big figures, with Independence Day contract peaks not far if those psychological levels are breached (174.05 and 132.45). ECB and Brexit could be the major factors, while USTs are tempering Fed expectations towards 25 bp and the curve may be flattening to make room for supply ahead of 2, 5 and 7 year auctions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are on the rise as sentiment in the complex is underpinned amid late-Friday reports that the IRGC seized a UK tanker in the Strait of Hormuz due to an alleged violation of maritime law. Meanwhile, UK Chancellor Hammond noted that the UK has been working closely with US and EU partners regarding a response to Iran’s actions. Energy markets are particularly sensitive to developments in the Strait of Hormuz, given that a fifth of the world’s oil exports passes through the corridor everyday whilst&nbsp; geopolitical tensions intensifies in the area. WTI and Brent futures have tested 57/bbl and 64/bbl to the upside as a result, albeit failed to convincingly breach the levels. Also of note; on Friday Libya’s NOC announced a force majeure at its El-Sharara (300k BPD) oilfield, although this has now been lifted, according to a statement. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> remains within a narrow range amid an uneventful USD and heading into a key meeting for the ECB, in which markets are pricing in a 50% chance of a 10bps cut to its Deposit rate. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices are marginally softer amid the overall cautious risk tone whilst <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> prices declined as port inventory across China rose to over 1-month highs.</p><p>Force majeure has been lifted on Libya’s El-Sharara oil field (~300k BPD). (Newswires)</p><p><strong>GEOPOLITICS&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Iranian lawmakers filed a motion asking govt to impose toll on ships passing through Strait of Hormuz</strong>.

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>Major European indices are relatively flat [Eurostoxx 50 +0.2%],</strong> albeit near highs of the day following on from a cautious Asia-Pac trade. Sectors are mixed with outperformance seen in the energy sector amid the price action in the complex. In terms of individual movers, Philips (+4.5%) shares rose on the back of optimistic earnings whilst Julius Baer (+3.3%) shares are supported by an 8% in assets under management. On the flip side, Whitbread (-4.0%) shares tumbled to the foot of the Stoxx 600 after Jane Street Global Trading leads a GBP 1.5bln short position in the Co. amid warnings that it is poised for a market sell-off.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> - The index has consolidated recovery gains above the 97.000 handle within a relatively tight 97.126-247 range following the final official Fed rhetoric ahead of the pre-FOMC backout period from Bullard who reiterated his preference for a 25 bp cut instead of anything larger. Meanwhile, WSJ sources chimed in with similar ‘guidance’ as recent economic developments do not suggest an imminent downturn that would warrant bolder action, although more easy could be flagged after July, and current market pricing reflects the latest commentary with less than 20% chance of a 50 bp ease.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD</strong> - The non-US Dollars are outperforming or at least holding up better than G10 peers, with the Kiwi leading the way on favourable cross-winds as Aud/Nzd retreats through 1.0400 and Nzd/Usd holds nearer last week’s peaks than Aud/Usd between 0.6782-58 and 0.7047-32 respective bands. From a fundamental perspective, the Aussie may glean fresh direction from RBA Assistant Governor Kent later, while the Loonie will be watching Canadian wholesale trade alongside crude prices that are currently supportive and nudging Usd/Cad down through 1.3050 within 1.3068-41 parameters.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/CHF/EUR</strong> - All on the backfoot vs the Greenback, and the Pound in particular awaiting the Tory leadership result that is widely expected to see Brexit hard-liner Boris Johnson appointed as new PM and fresh Cabinet faces before the whole process of negotiating with the EU really starts again. Cable is back below 1.2500 and from a chart standpoint looking more bearish as it slips beneath last Friday’s 1.2476 base. Next up would be July 18’s 1.2429 session low, but Sterling is keeping its head just above 0.9000 vs the Euro that is only just maintaining 1.1200+ status vs the Buck ahead of preliminary PMIs on Wednesday and the ECB on Thursday. Note, the probability of a 10 bp reduction in the depo rate is 50%, while some are also looking for the QE taps to be reopened, albeit not this month. Elsewhere, the Franc is hovering just below 0.9800 and 1.0100 vs the single currency, wary that any ECB stimulus or more pronounced safe-haven gains will be countered by the SNB in some shape or form. Similarly, with this month’s BoJ policy meeting looming on the eve of the FOMC the Yen is erring towards the side of caution closer to 108.00 compared to recent highs and unlikely at this stage to arouse decent option interest sitting from 107.50 to 107.35 in 2.3 bn).</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Lira has Central Bank action to look forward to as well, but US sanctions may be back on the radar to undermine sentiment given reports that President Trump is scheduling a meeting with Republican Senators to discuss options. Meanwhile, the consensus range is suitably wide for the CBRT as estimates cover a whopping 100-500 bp easing, and Usd/Try is near the top of a 5.6925-6490 at present.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>It’s been measured and slow, but steadfast all the same, as <strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>Gilts</strong> continue to claw back losses from the depths of mid-month retracement lows. In fact, it would be fair to say that the latest leg has been impressive given moves in <strong>US Treasuries</strong> that lag, with the 10 year EU debt futures up to 173.68 and 131.75 vs 171.25 and 130.14 on July 12. Indeed, the benchmarks are now only a fraction off resistance at 173.70 and 131.83 that stand in the way of big figures, with Independence Day contract peaks not far if those psychological levels are breached (174.05 and 132.45). ECB and Brexit could be the major factors, while USTs are tempering Fed expectations towards 25 bp and the curve may be flattening to make room for supply ahead of 2, 5 and 7 year auctions.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are on the rise as sentiment in the complex is underpinned amid late-Friday reports that the IRGC seized a UK tanker in the Strait of Hormuz due to an alleged violation of maritime law. Meanwhile, UK Chancellor Hammond noted that the UK has been working closely with US and EU partners regarding a response to Iran’s actions. Energy markets are particularly sensitive to developments in the Strait of Hormuz, given that a fifth of the world’s oil exports passes through the corridor everyday whilst&nbsp; geopolitical tensions intensifies in the area. WTI and Brent futures have tested 57/bbl and 64/bbl to the upside as a result, albeit failed to convincingly breach the levels. Also of note; on Friday Libya’s NOC announced a force majeure at its El-Sharara (300k BPD) oilfield, although this has now been lifted, according to a statement. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> remains within a narrow range amid an uneventful USD and heading into a key meeting for the ECB, in which markets are pricing in a 50% chance of a 10bps cut to its Deposit rate. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices are marginally softer amid the overall cautious risk tone whilst <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> prices declined as port inventory across China rose to over 1-month highs.</p>",

From a fundamental perspective, the Aussie may glean fresh direction from RBA Assistant Governor Kent later, while the Loonie will be watching Canadian wholesale trade alongside crude prices that are currently supportive and nudging Usd/Cad down through 1.3050 within 1.3068-41 parameters.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>All on the backfoot vs the Greenback, and the Pound in particular awaiting the Tory leadership result that is widely expected to see Brexit hard-liner Boris Johnson appointed as new PM and fresh Cabinet faces before the whole process of negotiating with the EU really starts again. Cable is back below 1.2500 and from a chart standpoint looking more bearish as it slips beneath last Friday’s 1.2476 base. Next up would be July 18’s 1.2429 session low, but Sterling is keeping its head just above 0.9000 vs the Euro that is only just maintaining 1.1200+ status vs the Buck ahead of preliminary PMIs on Wednesday and the ECB on Thursday. Note, the probability of a 10 bp reduction in the depo rate is 50%, while some are also looking for the QE taps to be reopened, albeit not this month. Elsewhere, the Franc is hovering just below 0.9800 and 1.0100 vs the single currency, wary that any ECB stimulus or more pronounced safe-haven gains will be countered by the SNB in some shape or form. Similarly, with this month’s BoJ policy meeting looming on the eve of the FOMC the Yen is erring towards the side of caution closer to 108.00 compared to recent highs and unlikely at this stage to arouse decent option interest sitting from 107.50 to 107.35 in 2.3 bn).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira has Central Bank action to look forward to as well, but US sanctions may be back on the radar to undermine sentiment given reports that President Trump is scheduling a meeting with Republican Senators to discuss options. Meanwhile, the consensus range is suitably wide for the CBRT as estimates cover a whopping 100-500 bp easing, and Usd/Try is near the top of a 5.6925-6490 at present.</p>",

Note also, Bunds have posted a minor new Eurex session high of 173.57 (+18 ticks compared to -10 ticks at one stage) and US Treasuries have crept up with the long end marginally outperforming. Back to Liffe, the 3 month strip is now a tad flatter with Mar21 and Jun21 contracts 1.5 ticks ahead after slipping 0.5-1 tick more uniformly in early trade. Ahead, no UK data, but voting closes at 5 pm for Conservative Party members and Tuesday’s docket looks a bit more interesting on paper at least as CBI industrial orders for July are due and BoE’s Haldane speaks with a text to be released.</p>",

This followed reports that officials aren’t prepared for bolder action of a 50bps cut as recent economic developments have not suggested an imminent downturn, while Fed’s Bullard also reiterated his call for a 25bps cut and doesn't think the situation calls for a larger cut.

Although support was provided on the back of some disappointing German PPI data, where the Bund strength spread into wider government bonds. A mixed July (prelim.) University of Michigan survey didn’t cause a stir. Later in the US session, there was some further selling as Fed’s Bullard affirmed his preference to a 25bps rate cut at the July meeting, which was then echoed by Fed sources claiming that the general sentiment among Fed members was also for a 25bps cut. However, news of British shipping vessels being seized in the Persian Gulf saw bidding into the settlement, at which, the curve had flattened, seeing the 2s10s narrowing by approximately 3.5bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 3+ ticks lower at 127-17.</p><p><strong>Fed officials reportedly could suggest potential for additional stimulus beyond July and signal a 25bp cut is likely at the July meeting</strong>. Furthermore, the article states officials aren’t prepared for bolder action by making a half-point cut as recent economic developments have not pointed to an imminent downturn. (WSJ)</p><p><strong>Fed's Bullard (Voter, Dove)</strong> reiterated call for a 25bps cut at the July meeting and said a 25bps cut would give the Fed the option for a cut later in the year. Bullard also noted it would be difficult for the Fed not to ease at this point and would have to follow through on rate cuts to ratify earlier policy signals, while he sees no reason to revisit decision on timing of balance sheet runoff and would like to see a new repo facility made available but added the Fed is not at that point just yet. Furthermore, Bullard said he would listen to arguments for a larger rate cut but thinks 25bps is appropriate and doesn't think the situation calls for a larger cut.

ASX 200 (-0.3) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) were both subdued at the open although strength in commodity-related stocks briefly spurred a rebound in Australia, while the Japanese benchmark failed to take advantage of a weaker currency as participants reflected on the Upper House election results in which PM Abe’s ruling coalition won a majority of seats but failed to retain the supermajority needed to push ahead with revising the constitution. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) and Hang Seng (-0.8%) declined despite continued liquidity efforts by the PBoC and more constructive language regarding US-China trade talks, with a rotation of funds seen into China’s new Nasdaq-style tech board known as the STAR Market which launched today and saw all of its 25 stocks surge by an average 126% in early trade and with some higher by more than 200%. Finally, 10yr JGBs were steady with only minimal support seen from the lacklustre tone in stocks and BoJ presence for JPY 1.265tln of JGBs mostly in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly lower with the region cautious following a quiet weekend in terms of newsflow and last Friday’s losses on Wall St. where geopolitical concerns weighed on sentiment after Iran seized 2 UK tankers. ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) were both subdued at the open although strength in commodity-related stocks briefly spurred a rebound in Australia, while the Japanese benchmark fails to take advantage of a weaker currency as participants reflect on the Upper House election results in which PM Abe’s ruling coalition won a majority of seats but failed to retain the supermajority needed to push ahead with revising the constitution. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) and Hang Seng (-0.8%) underperform despite continued liquidity efforts by the PBoC and more constructive language regarding US-China trade talks, amid a rotation of funds into China’s new Nasdaq-style tech board known as the STAR Market which launched today and saw all of its 25 stocks surge by an average 126% in early trade and with some higher by more than 200%.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains firm and marginally extends on Friday’s rebound back above the 97.00 level as hopes for a 50bps Fed move faded with CME Fed Fund Futures pricing in just 22.5% chance for a 50bps cut next week. This followed reports that officials aren’t prepared for bolder action of a 50bps cut as recent economic developments have not signalled an imminent downturn, while Fed’s Bullard also reiterated his call for a 25bps cut and doesn't think the situation calls for a larger cut. As such, the greenback’s major counterparts are lacklustre with EUR/USD near the bottom-end of the 1.1200 handle, while GBP/USD struggles to stay above 1.2500 ahead of tomorrow’s leadership announcement and amid concerns regarding front runner Boris Johnson’s “do or die” Brexit attitude, although there were also reports that EU countries are attempting to woo the hardliner and signalled an intention to work out a deal to avert a disaster. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are higher on a concerted attempt on the next round numbers to the upside despite the cautious risk tone, while antipodeans are constrained due to their high-beta properties.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are steady with only minimal gains seen despite the mostly lacklustre tone in stocks and BoJ presence for JPY 1.265tln of JGBs mostly in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>",
