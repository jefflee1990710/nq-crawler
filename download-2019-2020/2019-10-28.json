September's deficit was the smallest since June 2018, but Pantheon Macroeconomics does not believe that it will last. \"The 1.6% drop in exports was worse then we expected, and it completes the second straight quarterly decline, but it was more than offset by an unexpected 2.3% plunge in imports,\" the consultancy notes, \"a 5.0% drop in imports of consumer goods accounts for nearly three-fifths of this decline, following a 3.5% jump in August.\" Pantheon says it assumes these swings were in response to the imposition of tariffs on many imported Chinese consumer goods on 1st September 1, but suggests that imports will likely mean-revert in October, though it expects that export weakness will persist, judging by the export sub-component in the latest ISM data. In wake of the data, the Atlanta Fed's GDPnow tracker was revised down by one-tenth to 1.7%.</p><p><strong>* CHINESE INDUSTRIAL PROFITS:</strong> fell by 5.3% in September, the steepest drop since 2015 and a ramped-up pace of decline from the prior 2.0% decline. The Chinese bureau attributed the fall due to the decline in industrial product prices and slower sales growth. Analysts note that although production figures in China picked up in September, the deflationary pressures continue to weigh on corporate profits and their debt profiles.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 0.6% at 3039, NASDAQ-100 1% at 8111, Dow Jones 0.5% at 27091</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.4%, Consumer Staples -0.2%, Energy -0.6%, Financials 0.5%, Health Care 1%, Industrials 0.3%, Information Technology 1.3%, Materials 0.3%, Telecommunication Services 1.2%, Utilities -1.3%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Microsoft (MSFT) emerged victor in the USD 10bln JEDI cloud contract from the Pentagon, seeing the tech titan elevate indices, whilst competitor Amazon (AMZN) took a hit on the surprise loss. Tiffany (TIF) spiked, reaching gains of up to 30%, after France-based LVMH (MC FP) approached it with a USD 14.5bln takeover offer; TIF said it was considering the deal, but it is expected to reject this initial bid. PG&amp;E (PCG) tumbled amid it cutting power of close to 3mln customers as weather conditions deteriorate in the Sunshine State, local competitor Edison International (EIX) also traded lower. Prologis (PLD) traded in the red after making an all-stock acquisition offer for competitor REIT, Liberty Property Trust (LPT), which spiked higher on the USD 12.5bln EV bid.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> AT&amp;T (T) reported an inline Q3 earnings report but opened higher on the disclosure of its three-year capital allocation plan, to which activist investor Elliott Management gave its seal of approval to. Walgreens (WBA) held in the green on beating top and bottom line estimates and raising its annual cost savings target, although EPS guidance was slightly soft. Spotify (SPOT) bounced higher on a stellar earnings report, recording a surprise EPS and strong MAUs. DTE Energy (DTE) was subdued after an EPS miss. Restaurant Brands (QSR) took a hit after missing top and bottom line estimates, despite the announcement of the prodigal Popeyes Chicken Burger. ON Semiconductor (ON) surged on meeting expectations for earnings and guidance, providing some relief to the semiconductor sector.</p><p><strong>* BROKER MOVES:</strong> Roku (ROKU) made strong gains after being initiated with a Buy rating at BofAML. Ventas (VTR) took a hit with gratitude to downgrades at both Capital One and Citi. Stocks benefitting from upgrades included Atlassian (TEAM) at BofAML, First Solar (FSLR) at JMP, JetBlue Airways (JBLU) at JPMorgan. Conversely, stocks hit on downgrades included Alaska Air (ALK) at JPMorgan, American Eagle (AEO) at Citi, Cabot (COG) at Susquehanna (note energy was also hit from lower crude prices), Estee Lauder (EL) at Piper Jaffray, Lululemon (LULU) at Citi, PVH (PVH) at JPMorgan.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced that the US will ramp up more sanctions on Iran, adding the current sanctions are working and cutting off money for Iran. Elsewhere, ELINT news reported comments from Israel’s PM Netanyahu, who said Iran was setting up missiles in Yemen to target Israel. As such, Israel reportedly set up precautionary measures by increasing its readiness and adjusted its air defences as it prepares for a potential Iranian cruise missile or suicide drone attack as there is concern over recent Iranian activity. Over the weekend, president Trump something big has just happened, which was later to be revealed as the death of IS leader Baghdadi, as a US team raised a location in Syria. The death has spurred some worry of potential retaliatory attacks, and as such, France’s Interior Minister instructed police to be on high alert to prevent the potential attacks.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLES USD 0.85 LOWER AT USD 55.81/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLES USD 0.45 LOWER AT USD 61.57/BBL: </strong>Crude benchmarks failed to find impetus from the rise in equity bourses, moving lower through the session, paring gains from last week as a dent in Chinese industrial profits hit investor sentiment. Book squaring as a function of the expiry of Brent Dec’19 options on Monday is also of note. Looking ahead to the US energy inventories, crude stocks are seen building 0.7mln bbls, whilst distillates and gasoline are both seen drawing 2.3mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (Z9) SETTLED 12 TICKS LOWER AT 129-05.</strong></p><p>The pick-up in risk appetite saw rates continue to backup to start the week. The TPLEX trundled lower throughout the European session and remained at lows in the US session whilst participants pushed US equity bourses to new ATHs. The US Treasury announced it expects to issue USD 352bln (Prior estimate 381bln) in net marketable debt in Q4 19, and USD 389bln in Q1 20, saying it borrowed USD 440bln in Q3 19. By settlement the curve had mainly bear steepened, with both 2s10s and 2s30s 2.5bps wider, with the 2-year yield up by 2bps.</p><p>* <strong>FX WRAP:DXY</strong>&nbsp;was relatively flat today although the buck was trending lower in early trade but reversed throughout the remainder of the session as President Trump announced they are appearing ahead of schedule to sign the phase 1 trade deal, which saw outflows of havens and thus provided slight strength to the DXY.&nbsp;<strong>GBP</strong>&nbsp;was firmer to start the week as the EU granted an extension request to 31st&nbsp;October, which was later confirmed by UK PM Johnson and the EU, further diminishing the chance of a no deal Brexit. Also adding to the mix, Cable saw minor upside once UK lawmakers rejected UK PM Johnson’s request for an early election, however this was very much expected.&nbsp;<strong>Haven’s</strong>&nbsp;took a clear direction today due to the continuation of positive US/China trade rhetoric which saw USDJPY trade to highs of 109.03, finding resistance at the 200dma at 109.05; the x resides just beneath the 109-handle heading into ASIAPAC trade.&nbsp;<strong>CHF&nbsp;</strong>also traded lower to start the week, albeit relatively flat against the Dollar, but weaker against EUR&nbsp;and GBP.&nbsp;<strong>XAU</strong>&nbsp;trades beneath the USD 1500/oz level heading into overnight trade falling from highs at 1508 to lows of 1490.&nbsp;<strong>EMFX</strong>&nbsp;varied to start the week, <strong>ZAR</strong>&nbsp;traded firmer as is Eskom announced that no load shedding is expected to occur today and there is a low probability of any load shedding this week.&nbsp;<strong>ARS</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>TRY</strong>&nbsp;outperformed against the greenback with the former benefiting from central bank intervention despite Fernandez’s election win;&nbsp;<strong>TRY</strong>&nbsp;performing well amid a continued silence on the Syria front.</p><p><strong>* ARGENTINA ELECTIONS: </strong>Populist opposition leader Fernandez beat the market-friendly Macri (whose policies had some success in controlling inflation and turning the economy onto a sustainable path) by 48% vs 40%, avoiding the need for a run-off next month. The outcome lead the Argentine central bank to tighten currency controls in order to preserve Argentina's USD 43.5bln of FX reserves, and has limited Argentines' ability to purchase US dollars to USD 200 per month (from USD 10k per month), through 10th December. Pantheon Macroeconomics said the election opens the door to severe uncertainty under a new Peronist government. \"Mr. Fernández and his vice-president, former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, has the potential to mark the start of a renewed chapter of economic and financial chaos. We believe that the new president will seek to implement populist policies, due to his Peronist credentials and closeness to the Kirchners, so markets should brace for more volatility,\" and notes that the previous 12-year Kirchnerist era was characterised by wild inflation, huge public deficits and unsustainable subsidies.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Sterling was already underpinned on the 1.2800 handle against the Dollar and above 0.8650 vs the Euro before early buy orders triggered a few stops before confirmation that the EU has granted the UK a further Article 50 extension to January 31st via EC President Tusk. However, the Pound derived more traction amidst growing GE momentum and hardly stumbled when headlines broke indicating that main opposition party Labour intends to abstain from tonight’s vote on PM Johnson’s motion to go to the polls on December 12 as the Government held meetings with the Lib Dems and SNP to discuss alternative GE dates with conditions, and even the possibility of a new longer Programme Motion. Indeed, Cable extended gains to circa 1.2876 and just above the 10 DMA (1.2873), while Eur/Gbp finally breached its 21 DMA (0.8629) to open up 0.8600 again. Conversely, the Yen and Franc both extended ranges to the downside in wake of more bullish comments from US President Trump on the state of Chinese trade talks just after he pronounced that Wall Street is heading for a good day. Usd/Jpy matched the previous 108.94 October peak, but faded ahead of the psychological 109.00 level and the 200 DMA (109.06), while Usd/Chf reached 0.9970 and Eur/Chf around 1.1059 before waning.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars were on divergent paths for the most part, as the Aussie consolidated above the 0.6800 handle and Aud/Nzd hurdled 1.0750 in contrast to Nzd/Usd that retreated through 0.6350. The Kiwi may have lacked support from NZ participants due to the local Labour Day holiday, while comments from RBA’s Lowe on Tuesday and/or CPI data on Wednesday could provide the Aussie with more impetus.</p><p><strong>EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>A bit more gyrating around the 1.1100 and 1.3050 marks vs their US counterpart as the Euro failed to sustain gains on its big figure break and was already back under before the NY cut when a hefty option expiry ran off (1.3 bn). Comments from departing ECB President Draghi did not really impact the single currency and softer than forecast Eurozone M3 data was largely overlooked, but higher Eurozone yields did provide some early traction alongside the aforementioned positive Brextension. Meanwhile, the Loonie had a good look at Fib support (1.3151), but failed to penetrate the technical level or 1.3050 ahead of the BoC on Wednesday and just hours in front of the Fed, as the <strong>DXY </strong>regrouped within a 97.670-896 range band and broadly shrugged off mixed US data in advance of more high profile releases later in the week, like NFP.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The general upturn in risk sentiment noted above exacerbated Try and Zar rallies to 5.7150+ and almost 14.5250 vs the Usd respectively, with the Lira still benefiting from relative calm on the Turkish-Syrian front and less angst from the US and other international nations in response, while the Rand was boosted that Eskom is back to full power ahead of this week’s SA budget and Moody’s ratings review. However, the Argentine Peso only managed to stop the rot in wake of Fernandez’ election victory with the aid of official intervention in the form of capital controls, in stark contrast to Brazil’s Real that continued to revel in pension reform relief if not glory and appeared to take in stride consensus expectations for a 50 bp BCB ease on Wednesday.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* THE LATEST: </strong>If the UK Government’s FTPA motion fails tonight, it is likely to table a single line bill for a general election tomorrow (which would be very similar the one proposed by the Liberal Democrats and backed by the SNP over the weekend, and would only require a simple majority in parliament), said Downing Street sources. Shortly after, a Liberal Democrat source suggested that they may back the Government’s one-line bill for a general election, but the bill would have to meet three conditions of avoiding no deal Brexit, dropping the WAB and the date must be “set in stone”. Lib Dem sources added they are unlikely to support amendments to the election bill such as votes for 16-year olds or EU nationals. Later reports suggested that the government is willing to meet these conditions, although there is still reportedly “wrangling” over the date of the election. With Tory/ex Tory and Liberal Democrat support, the bill appears to have the numbers to pass. The date proposed by the Liberal Democrats over the weekend would fix an election for December 9th, while the government were pushing for a 12th December election date. Any potential bill, if brought forward by the government, could be moved through Parliament between Tuesday and Thursday. Labour, reportedly resigned to the fact that an election in December seems probable (via a single line bill outlined above), indicated they may abstain tonight at the government’s FTPA motion, which if passed, would set an election for 12th December – it is worth noting that this vote is still unlikely to pass as it needs 2/3s of MPs to vote in favour. Either way, with the probability of an election this year seemingly rising, Labour may be wary of the optics of an opposition party continuing to block an election. In another twist, reports suggested that No10 is in talks with Labour Leavers and ex-Tories about bringing another programme motion for the WAB tomorrow. In terms of timings for tonight; the government’s FTPA motion is to be voted on after 17:00 GMT.</p><p><strong>* EU EXTENSION</strong>: The EU will give the UK a 3-month Brexit extension (to January 31st) with an option to leave earlier (UK press speculated on either November 30th or December 31st), announced EU Council President Tusk, if the UK can ratify the deal it reached with the EU. The proposal is also said to include a provision which prevents the UK from seeking to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement at some point in the future. France has reportedly dropped its opposition to a three-month delay (it had been pushing for a much shorter extension).</p>",

Coming in to the week, the assumption had been that the motion would be unlikely to succeed given the Labour Party’s opposition to an election (the party says it opposes an election until “no deal is taken off of the table” - although strategists note the party facing losing a substantial number of seat at the general election according to current polling). However, this morning, EU Council President Tusk announced that the EU would grant a the UK a three-month extension. There were weekend reports that Labour's \"until no deal is off the table\" criteria had shifted to no longer include a three-month extension as sufficient - however, wary of the way such a shift may appear to the public, the above news from ITV's Brand may be the first indications that Labour are shifting to supporting (or at least not blocking) an early election, which would most likely be held in early December.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

This lifted all US majors on Friday and saw the S&amp;P 500 approach to within less than half a point of its record high, fuelled by outperformance in the trade sensitive sectors, although the gains in the Asia-Pac region were mostly moderate amid calm before this week’s storm of risk events. ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) marginally benefitted from the trade optimism and as commodity-related stocks kept the Australian index afloat, while the advances in Japan were limited by the recent mixed performance in its currency. Elsewhere, Chinese markets outperform amid encouraging earnings from some of China’s Big 4 banks including ICBC and with Hang Seng (+0.8%) also underpinned by the inclusion of dual class listed stocks in the Stock Connect and amid anticipation of another 25bps rate cut at this week’s FOMC which would force the HKMA to move in lock-step with the Fed. However, the index later retraced some of the gains after weaker results from HSBC and with the Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) somewhat restricted after a PBoC liquidity drain and the steepest contraction to Chinese Industrial Profits since 2015. Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower on spillover selling from recent declines in T-notes and as stocks mildly benefitted from the trade optimism, but with downside stemmed amid BoJ presence in the market for JPY 1.1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for net daily drain of CNY 50bln.

Major bourses are tentative as is usually the case ahead of a risk-packed week which sees the latest FOMC/BoJ policy meetings, German Prelim CPI, EZ flash CPI, US ISM Manufacturing, US labour market report and a slew large-cap earnings. Sectors are mixed with pressure seen in Financials as heavyweight HSBC (-4.1%) slumped post-earnings after missing on adj. pretax and revenue expectations, whilst stating that it no longer intends to achieve its ROTE target and notes of “significant” restructuring charges amid a deterioration in the global outlook.&nbsp; On the flip side, consumer discretionary outperform as jewellery makers benefit from LVMH’s (+0.3%) unsolicited bid to acquire Tiffany (+20% pre-market), which is poised to be rejected according to sources cited by the FT. Thus, the likes of Pandora (+1.3%), Richemont (+2.1%) and Swatch (+1.4%) are lifted in tandem. Turning to individual stocks, Bankia (-3.0%) shares fell after the Co. reported this morning. In terms of bank analysis, JPM favour Euro-area stocks and note that international shares are set to outperform those in the US. JPM also maintains a bullish outlook on global equities but also expect rotation into cyclicals and value shares benefitting non-US equities more.

In the interim, preliminary trade data will overshadow wholesale inventories today after reports that the US and China are close to finalising elements of the Phase 1 pact, while Tuesday’s highlights are likely to be consumer confidence and pending home sales.</p><p>AUD/EUR/NZD/GBP - Although the Greenback remains underpinned overall, as noted above, the Aussie, Euro, Kiwi and Pound are all marginally firmer, with Aud/Usd maintaining 0.6800+ status, Eur/Usd inching towards 1.1100, Nzd/Usd pivoting 0.6350 and Cable hovering above 1.2800 between 1.2860-10 broad parameters. Note, Asia-Pacific trade was hampered somewhat by the NZ market holiday (Labour Day), but early EU activity boosted by some demand for Sterling that saw the Eur/Gbp cross test 10 DMA support at 0.8629 amidst expectations that the EU will respond favourably to the latest UK Brextension request, which has subsequently been confirmed by EC President Tusk and leaves the Pound prone to another showdown in Westminster as PM Johnson continues to push for a GE.

Crude specific newsflow include comments from the Russian Energy Ministry; who noted that it is too early to discuss deeper OPEC+ cuts, which dampens the source reports seen last week. Further, the Ministry noted that OPEC+ will consider the US’ oil output growth slowdown in their December decision, for reference OPEC+ are expected to revise policy when they convene on December 6th. Last Friday’s Baker Hughes print for oil rigs was the lowest reading since April 2017 and therefore the oil rig count has dropped by 189 this year. Elsewhere, UBS note that recent indicators of weakness including this year’s rig decreases and a employment slowdown in Texas indicate that prices above USD 56/bbl for WTI are necessary to justify the maintenance or expansion of current oil production levels. In terms of metals - spot gold is flat and remains within relatively narrow USD 5/oz ranges above the USD 1500/oz mark heading into key risk events this week. Elsewhere, copper prices are on the backfoot amid further deterioration in China’s industrial profits which was the steepest fall in four years.</p>",

In the interim, preliminary trade data will overshadow wholesale inventories today after reports that the US and China are close to finalising elements of the Phase 1 pact, while Tuesday’s highlights are likely to be consumer confidence and pending home sales.</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR/NZD/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although the Greenback remains underpinned overall, as noted above, the Aussie, Euro, Kiwi and Pound are all marginally firmer, with Aud/Usd maintaining 0.6800+ status, Eur/Usd inching towards 1.1100, Nzd/Usd pivoting 0.6350 and Cable hovering above 1.2800 between 1.2860-10 broad parameters. Note, Asia-Pacific trade was hampered somewhat by the NZ market holiday (Labour Day), but early EU activity boosted by some demand for Sterling that saw the Eur/Gbp cross test 10 DMA support at 0.8629 amidst expectations that the EU will respond favourably to the latest UK Brextension request, which has subsequently been confirmed by EC President Tusk and leaves the Pound prone to another showdown in Westminster as PM Johnson continues to push for a GE. Meanwhile, a decent expiry option may cap Eur/Usd given 1.3 bn rolling off at the 1.1100 strike.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All fractionally softer vs the Buck, as the Yen straddles 108.70 ahead of the BoJ and remains wary about possible policy action or more dovish guidance, while the Loonie is looking at the BoC for more independent direction having strengthened recently to breach 1.3100 and test the next line of resistance at 1.3050 that also coincides with a 1.3051 Fib retracement. Elsewhere, no looming SNB meeting to consider for the Franc, but latest weekly Swiss sight deposits suggest the Bank has been back in action as Usd/Chf hovers around 0.9950 and Eur/Chf climbs towards 1.1050.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Yet more Rand and Lira outperformance, with the former encouraged by Eskom declaring no further load-shedding for Monday or this week at this stage, while the latter continues to welcome a thawing in Turkish-US/international relations over Syria. However, the Argentinian Peso is lamenting the weekend election result revealing a win for Fernandez that has prompted the authorities to implement capital controls.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* EU EXTENSION LATEST:</strong> The EU will give the UK a 3-month Brexit extension (to January 31st) with an option to leave earlier (UK press speculated on either November 30th or December 31st), announced EU Council President Tusk, if the UK can ratify the deal it reached with the EU. The proposal is also said to include a provision which prevents the UK from seeking to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement at some point in the future. France has reportedly dropped its opposition to a three-month delay (it had been pushing for a much shorter extension).</p><p><strong>* UK ELECTION LATEST:</strong> Across the channel, UK PM Johnson will bring a motion to parliament today, asking for an election on December 12th under the Fixed Term Parliament Act: this motion would need 2/3s (434) of MPs to vote in favour and is unlikely to succeed given the Labour Party’s opposition to an election. The party says it opposes an election until “no deal is taken off of the table”, something which they are now saying a three-month extension does not do, says the party – it is worth noting that the latest polls put Labour in a weak position, at 24% to the Conservatives 40%. Elsewhere, the opposition Liberal Democratic party have drawn up a bill that amends the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, fixing an election for December 9th. The SNP also threw their weight behind the bill, which, according to commentators, which could give it the numbers to pass if the government also backed the bill – both parties could benefit from the fact that university students would still be at their campuses on the 9th. The government, however, has ruled out support for such a motion, calling it a “gimmick” that opposition parties would use to stop Parliament from debating Brexit.</p><p><strong>* OTHER ROUTES TO AN ELECTION: </strong>The opposition or PM Johnson himself could call for a vote of no confidence, which only requires a simple majority to pass. Thereafter, Party leaders would have 14 days to form a new government that can win a confidence vote; Johnson’s government would be given the first shot it is party with the most seats. If they fail, Labour could also try, and failing that, other parties could try to form a government of national unity.</p>",

This lifted all US majors on Friday and saw the S&amp;P 500 approach to within less than half a point of its record high, fuelled by outperformance in the trade sensitive sectors, although the gains in the Asia-Pac region were mostly moderate amid calm before this week’s storm of risk events. ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) marginally benefitted from the trade optimism and as commodity-related stocks kept the Australian index afloat, while the advances in Japan were limited by the recent mixed performance in its currency. Elsewhere, Chinese markets outperform amid encouraging earnings from some of China’s Big 4 banks including ICBC and with Hang Seng (+1.1%) also underpinned by the inclusion of dual class listed stocks in the Stock Connect and amid anticipation of another 25bps rate cut at this week’s FOMC which would force the HKMA to move in lock-step with the Fed.

As such, the <strong>DXY</strong> traded relatively stable and held on to last week’s spoils as its major counterparts remained lacklustre with <strong>EUR/USD</strong> stuck near last week’s lows beneath the 1.1100 handle. <strong>GBP/USD </strong>was also subdued and approached closer towards 1.2800 to the downside ahead of PM Johnson’s attempt to get a snap election passed through Parliament today, while the latest reports concerning Brussels continued to suggest the EU is preparing to grant the UK request for a 3-month Brexit extension with the bloc’s ambassadors to meet early this week to finalize the agreement.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> flatlined and held above the USD 1500/oz amid a steady greenback and with participants side-lined by an anticipated Fed rate cut as well as US NFP jobs data later this week, while copper mirrored the uneventful trade across the complex but was kept afloat amid the mild positive risk tone from the heightened US-China trade hopes.</p><p>Baker Hughes Rig Count: Oil rigs -17 at 696, gas rigs -4 at 133, total rigs -21 at 830.

(KBS)</p><p><strong>US</strong> At settlement, the curve had bear-flattened, shaking off an early risk-off feeling; downside today was sponsored by constructive chatter after a phone call between US/China negotiators, which even trade hawk Navarro described as ‘excellent’. The complex did find a modest bid in quiet afternoon trade, as equities faded from near-record highs, perhaps also aided later by news that trade advisor Navarro was pushing for tougher language on IP protections. Next week, the complex will take more cues from the fundamental side of the equation, with FOMC, NFP and ISMs on tap; currently, markets are pricing with near certainty a 25bps rate cut to 1.50-1.75%; key will be how the Fed guides after it has completed its ‘insurance cuts’; currently, money markets imply easing of a 29bps into year-end (just over one cut priced), and 57bps of cuts is priced through end-2020 (implying just over 2 rate cuts by the end of next year, include the potential cut on Wednesday). US T-note futures (Z9) settled 10 ticks lower at 129-17.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets kick-start the week with a positive tone after trade hopes were spurred by the recent top-level call between US and China negotiators in which the sides were said to be close to finalising some sections of the phase one deal. This lifted all US majors on Friday and saw the S&amp;P 500 approach to within less than half a point of its record high, fuelled by outperformance in the trade sensitive sectors, although the gains in the Asia-Pac region are mostly moderate amid calm before this week’s storm of risk events. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) marginally benefit from the trade optimism with commodity-related stocks keeping the Australian index afloat, while the advances in Japan have been limited by the recent mixed performance in its currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.3%) outperforms as markets anticipate another 25bps rate cut at this week’s FOMC which would force the HKMA to move in lock-step with the Fed, while gains in the Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) are to a lesser extent after PBoC liquidity inaction and the steepest contraction to Chinese Industrial Profits since 2015.</p><p>FX price action has been relatively muted in the region owing to a light calendar, several holiday closures (New Zealand, Singapore &amp; India) and ahead of this week’s slew of risk events including the FOMC and which culminates with Friday’s NFP jobs data. As such, the DXY is relatively stable and marginally extends on last week’s strength as its major counterparts remain lacklustre with EUR/USD stuck near last week’s lows beneath the 1.1100 handle. GBP/USD is also subdued and approaches 1.2800 to the downside ahead of PM Johnson’s attempt to get a snap election passed through Parliament today, while the latest reports concerning Brussels continue to suggest the EU is preparing to grant the UK request for a 3-month Brexit extension with the bloc’s ambassadors to meet early this week to finalize the agreement. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses trade uneventful and antipodeans are also unchanged amid a quiet overnight session and holiday-thinned conditions.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as they track the recent declines in T-notes and as stocks mildly benefit from the trade optimism, but with downside stemmed amid BoJ presence in the market for JPY 1.1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities.&nbsp;</p>",
