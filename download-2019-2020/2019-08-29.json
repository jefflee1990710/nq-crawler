In stocks specific, Tech behemoths Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC), as well as financials, JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were higher on positive trade rhetoric. AAPL was boosted further after news that it is to release its new iPhone’s on September 10th. Utilities underperformed as risk-on flows dominated. China-sensitive names (which have generated around 400bps of alpha this year, surprisingly) outperformed, with tech and industrials leading the gains; financials also firmed as yields inched up. Dollar Tree (DLTR) missed EPS but beating on sales and SSS, while raising guidance (albeit beneath expectations). The mixed report initially saw DLTR higher however gains were short-lived as it quickly traced back at the market open. Dollar General (DG) beat on both top and bottom-line, as well as SSS. DG also raised its EPS forecast above expectations, but raised its FY revenue forecast slightly beneath the street’s expectations; DG were higher by ~10% on Thursday trade. BestBuy (BBY) underperformed the SPY following its earnings, where sales missed, and the looming tariffs weighed on the stock. Aside from earnings, Altria (MO) were hit as the FTC started a probe into Altria (MO) to see whether JUUL targeted minors with influencers on social media. S&amp;P 500 1.3% AT 2925, NASDAQ-100 1.5% AT 7702, DOW JONES 1.3% AT 26362.</p><p>Yields are higher across the curve, but major curve spreads are mixed at settlement, with 2s5s, 2s10s and 5s10s wider, by around 1bps, though 2s30s, 5s30s and 10s30s are narrower by 1.5-2bps. The curve began steepening overnight after Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said 50-year and 100-year issues were being mulled, and separately ruled out FX intervention in the USD for now. However, hawkish comments from White House advisor Navarro saw initial steepening reverse. In the European morning, China made constructive comments, which saw yields march upwards. There was some sypmathy with EGBs after dovish remarks from incoming ECB President Lagarde, though hawkish comments from the ECB's Knot countered some of that. In the US afternoon, a soft 7-year auction (tailed by 2.1bps on very weak cover, while internals were not great) so yields tick higher. US T-note (U9) futures settled 13 ticks lower at 130-30+.</p>",

Officials also said that both sides were discussing the September talks, and if China officials go the the US, then there should be an environment created for progress in the negotiations. The officials also called on the US to cancel the planned additional tariffs to avoid a trade war escalation.</p><p><strong>* US TAX CUTS: </strong>The White House is considering a proposal to cut taxes by the amount raised in tariffs imposed on China, according to a senior administration official cited by Washington Post. The report comes amid pressure that the administration is facing to contain the economic damage from the global trade conflict. WaPo reported that President Trump has discussed the plan with aides, but details of how it would work remain unclear. The plan would require congressional approval, and its fate there is uncertain.</p><p><strong>* MNUCHIN:</strong> Treasury Secretary Mnuchin after-market on Wednesday said ultra-long bonds were under consideration \"if the conditions were right,\" with 50-year or 100-year bonds recently gaining popularity in the Treasury. Mnuchin said the consideration was not connected to the decline in yields of long-term bonds. The Treasury secretary also said that the US does not intend to intervene in USD for now, but administration has weighed countering USD strength. In terms of issuance, the key question, Rabobank says, is whether the onus is upon the Treasury to drum up investor support for such issuance, or whether it is rather responding to demand it believes is already there. \"The fact that 30-year US yields touched new record lows on Wednesday clearly points to it being the latter, the bank argues, thereby suggesting that such a step should be seen as bullish from a demand perspective, rather than bearish from the vantage of supply. Of course, much of the steepening in wake of Mnuchin's comments was reversed by hawkish remarks from WH advisor Navarro.</p><p><strong>* NAVARRO:</strong> Overnight, White House Advisor Navarro was cool on the prospects of reaching a trade breakthrough with China any time soon. The Trump advisor also echoed the President's attacks on the Fed, arguing that the central bank needed to 'do its job' and cut rates.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> <strong>Fed's Daly</strong> (non-voter, neutral) overnight reiterated her 'wait and see' stance, noting the US economy was performing well, however, global uncertainties on business confidence were rising. Daly said she saw July rate cut as recalibration of policy and slightly accommodative. She said she was convinced that using tools early and pre-emptively was better than waiting, adding it is better to avoid the ditch, rather than dig yourself out of it.</p><p><strong>* US Q2 GDP (SECOND):</strong> Headline GDP growth was revised down by 0.1ppts to 2.0%, although consumption was revised higher by 0.4ppts to 4.7%; however, there were downside revisions to business capex, residential capex, net foreign trade, government spending and inventories. \"The economy was very unbalanced in Q2, with consumption contributing 3.1ppts to growth while the other components contributed -1.1ppts,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, \"The third quarter should be less uneven, but the outlook for capital spending is deteriorating rapidly in the face of slower earnings growth and uncertainty created by the trade war.\" Pantheon notes that the GDP and core PCE deflators were both revised down at tenth, to 2.4% and 1.7% respectively, but tomorrow's personal income and spending report will reveal the monthly details in the PCE data. \"Overall, GDP growth averaged a respectable 2.6% in the first half of the year, but we’d be surprised to see that pace matched in the second half, given the parlous state of manufacturing and businesses' reluctance to commit to capex in such an uncertain environment.\"</p><p><strong>* US JULY PENDING HOME SALES: </strong>The Street expected an unchanged print, but pending home sales fell 2.5% in July. The data is often choppy, and reverts to trend. Analysts said it doesn’t change the underlying trend, that the index is rising, and headwinds seen in 2018 (cap on state and local tax deductions) is fading, while mortgage applications are rising.</p><p><strong>* CHINA LEVERAGE:</strong> China's National Institution for Finance and Development reported macro leverage ratio rose to 249.5% at the end of June, from 248.8% at the end of March, and 243.7% at the end of 2018. The rise in leverage signals a reversal in Beijing deleveraging campaign, that got underway in 2017, as policymakers shift their focus onto support for the real economy, rather than reducing debt. The leverage ratio rose in all sectors, except for the finance sector. The NIFD said it sees leverage continuing to rise in 2019, adding that a moderate rise must be 'tolerated' \"for the sake of economic stabilization.\"</p><p><strong>* CHINA: </strong>Global Times editor Hu Xijin urged the US to immediately cease provocative actions (the US Navy warship entering the South China Sea) to avoid unexpected events. Xijin added that the PLA will take all necessary measures to defend China's sovereignty and safeguard peace and stability in the sea. Chinese press reported that Beijing will show off its advanced nuclear weapons in its National Day parade on October 1st, which an analyst suggests would be sending a 'warning message' to US.</p><p><strong>* INCOMING ECB PRESIDENT LAGARDE: </strong>Incoming ECB chief Lagarde said the central bank has the tools to tackle a downturn, and must be ready to use them. In a letter to a European Parliament questionnaire ahead of her confirmation hearing next Tuesday, Lagarde said the ECB had not hit the lower bound on rates. Lagarde impressed the need to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for the foreseeable future. However, she did note that while she did not believe that the ECB has hit the effective lower bound on policy rates, it is clear that low rates have implications for the banking sector and financial stability more generally, so it is key to closely monitor whether adverse side effects may emerge in the future, the longer low interest rates are in place. Lagarde said the exact nature of the instruments deployed will depend on the nature of the shocks affecting the outlook for inflation, as well as on financial market conditions.</p><p><strong>* ECB: ECB's Nowotny</strong> (outgoing) said the ECB has historically gone too far in seeking to meet market expectations, and should be prepared to disappoint, echoing recent remarks from VP de Guindos, who argued that the central bank must base its decisions on macro data, and be critical of market expectations. Bunds opened offered on Thursday, with Nowotny's interview being cited. <strong>ECB’s Knot </strong>(hawk) was more hawkish, said there was no need to resume a QE programme at present, and that market expectations for the ECB’s September meeting were overdone.</p><p><strong>* EUROZONE CONFIDENCE:</strong> EU Economic Sentiment for August rose to 103.1 from 102.7 in July, higher than expectations for 102.3. The increase in business sentiment to 0.11 from -0.12 in July more than offsets a decline in consumer confidence, which fell to -7.1 from -6.6 in July. Industrial Sentiment came in better than expectations for -7.4 at -5.9, however, Services was weaker at 9.3 vs the expected 10.5 and prior 10.6. Capital Economics notes that the services print is still consistent with sector output growth of roughly 2% y/y. Based on recent history form, “the measures point to annual euro-zone GDP growth of around 1%” the consultancy says. All in all, the consultancy concludes that the small increase in Economic Sentiment in August doesn’t change the big picture of a bleak outlook for the euro-zone economy. As such, CapEco maintains its ECB call; that the central bank will cut rates in two weeks’ time and announce a fresh round of QE, probably in October.</p><p><strong>* GERMANY INFLATION:</strong> Inflation metrics came in soft(-0.2% M/M versus an expected -0.1%; 1.4% YY versus an expected 1.5%, falling from 1.7%; the HICP measure fell 0.1% M/M against a prior +0.4%, and the Y/Y rate pared to 1.0% from 1.1%), missing expectations, which analysts said highlights the need for further ECB stimulus. ING said that the strong discrepancy between the national and the HICP (European harmonised measure) of German inflation is mainly caused by methodological changes to the measurement of package holidays in the European measure, as well as changes to the weights of different components in the national measure. Looking ahead, the analysts said that lower oil prices will continue to keep a lid on German inflationary pressures; \"while this is good news for consumers, who as Mario Draghi once said can 'buy more stuff', the low inflation combined with the prospects of an at best stagnating economy bolsters the case for new monetary stimulus from the ECB in two weeks from today.\" The bank thinks that the ECB does not want to wait until the Eurozone economy is again caught in a possible deflationary spiral, but will want to set another (maybe final) pre-emptive strike. In the bank's view, the ECB will present a new stimulus package consisting of a 20bp cut in the deposit rate, a tiering system, a restart of QE with 30bn euro per month as well as a repricing of the TLTROs</p><p><strong>* GERMANY CORPORATION TAX:</strong> Germany is mulling capping corporation tax rate at 25% as is looks to support smaller businesses in the face of slowing growth.</p><p><strong>* ITALY/BTPs:</strong> Caretaker PM Conte has been appointed for a second term, after 5SM and PD on Wednesday reached a government coalition deal. Italian 10-year yields fell to fresh record lows on Wednesday, as traders front-ran the announcement on positive signs from PD/5SM, but the bullish momentum may continue, Rabobank thinks, and the Bund/BTP spread could narrow towards 130bps (from the current c.170bps), given that two-thirds of nominal EGBs are trading in negative territory, and BTPs make up a large part of portion of the positive yielding EGBs, highlighting that for those investors seeking to avoid paying for the privilege of investing in Eurozone debt, Italy is attractive. Looking ahead, the immediate focus is on the formulation of the 2020 budget, and ensuring that its contents meets the requirements set by the European Commission last December (budget deficit must be reduced to 1.8% and 2020 lowered to 1.5%). Alternatively, the new administration could opt to renegotiate those targets or prevent any of the impending ‘safety clauses’, ABN AMRO says; the Dutch Bank notes that \"these consist of a VAT-hike or other income-generating measures amounting to EUR 23.1bln (equal to around 1.3% of GDP) in 2020, and EUR 28.8bn in 2021.\" Italy’s economic situation has become significantly more precarious than it was at the time of the above measures being agreed (e.g. some economists believe that Italy is potentially in recession). Further, although both parties hold a more favourable view of the EU than that of The League, there is little else that binds the two from an ideological standpoint with 5SM more left-leaning than the PD. This has been exemplified by some political commentators noting that the only thing that unites the two parties is a hatred of Matteo Salvini; something which is highly unlikely to lead to a sustainable coalition over the course of a five-year term. As such, even though elections have been avoided in the immediacy, Italian voters will likely have to return to the polling booths at some point next year once the budget has been passed by Parliament and signed off by the EC.</p><p><strong>* BANXICO MINUTES:</strong> The minutes to the central bank’s July meeting, where it cut rates by 25bps to 8%, showed one member arguing for rates to remain unchanged since persistent core inflation justified an on hold position. The minutes, however, revealed that Board Members see the deceleration in growth as larger than previously expected, and one member saw the economy on the verge of recession. The majority of participants saw MXN risks pressured by both internal and external factors, and the majority felt that the central scenario for inflation could improve somewhat on the back of less pressure from non-core inflation. All members saw the balance of risks continuing to be tilted towards the downside amid the uncertainty, though the majority thinks that US tariffs and compensatory measures present upside risks to inflation, though these risks have diminished. One member was concerned that the possibility of a credit downgrade to Pemex and even the Sovereign have been priced in by the market, though a downgrade might still cause volatility, pressuring Mexican financing costs. Finally, one member said that current monetary policy was highly restrictive, not just relative to other economies, but also in absolute terms too.</p><p><strong>* WTI (V9) SETTLES USD 0.93 HIGHER AT USD 56.71; BRENT (V9) SETTLES USD 0.59 HIGHER AT USD 61.08: </strong>The crude treaded higher on Thursday amid a risk-on tone, spurred by the Chinese announcing that phone calls with the US on trade had been occurring, albeit gains in oil were less pronounced when compared to other recent price moves related to risk appetite. The arb also continued its recent narrowing, with WTI making up for Wednesday’s underperformance compared to Brent, perhaps as participants digest the recent bullish inventory data, and likely part due to some book squaring ahead of the Brent (V9) contract expiry on Friday. Elsewhere in news-flow, the Trump administration proposed relaxing President Obama-era limits on methane at oil and gas operations, which would reduce costs for players in the US energy sector, particularly smaller producers; sources report Russian average oil output in August stood at 11.31mln BPD (prev. 11.15mln in July), a step closer towards its OPEC+ output agreement limit of 11.52mln BPD; WSJ reported Saudi Aramco is proposing a two stage IPO later this year, favouring Tokyo’s exchange whilst debuting a portion of its shares on the Saudi stock exchange.</p><p><strong>* VENEZUELA: </strong>US Envoy for Venezuela Abrams said he is hopeful the EU will impose sanctions against Venezuela in the coming months. Abrams added that the US believes Russia's Rosneft's purchases of Venezuelan oil does not violate sanctions at this time; also that its oil continues to flow to China largely in the form of \"pay-back\" oil.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (U9) FUTURES SETTLE 13 TICKS LOWER AT 130-30+. </strong>Yields are higher across the curve, but major curve spreads are mixed at settlement, with 2s5s, 2s10s and 5s10s wider, by around 1bps, though 2s30s, 5s30s and 10s30s are narrower by 1.5-2bps. The curve began steepening overnight after Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said 50-year and 100-year issues were being mulled, and separately ruled out FX intervention in the USD for now. However, hawkish comments from White House advisor Navarro saw initial steepening reverse. In the European morning, China made constructive comments, which saw yields march upwards. There was some sypmathy with EGBs after dovish remarks from incoming ECB President Lagarde, though hawkish comments from the ECB's Knot countered some of that. In the US afternoon, a soft 7-year auction (tailed by 2.1bps on very weak cover, while internals were not great) so yields tick higher.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>USD was firmer, with wires citing easing trade tensions between the US and China. Havens were lower. EUR loses ground under 1.11, on the back of aforementioned USD strength; meanwhile, weak German inflation data potentially augurs disappointment in Friday's Eurozone equivalent, which would further ramp pressure on the ECB to loosen policy - dovish comments by Lagarde also were cited; a strengthening CNH also helps; Nikkei reported that China clamps down on capital flight risk as yuan weakens, and financial authorities have rolled out measures to stem capital outflows from the mainland. AUD couldn't build on the positive US/China backdrop, with the Aussie slipping below 0.6730 and setting up a test of 0.67 after weak capex data, ahead of next week's RBA. It's Antipodean counterpart NZD was softer on weak business confidence overnight. CAD is slightly positive against the USD, with risk appetite and higher crude prices providing support ahead of Friday's GDP print. GBP was on the defense amid rising probabilities of a no deal Brexit, which could take EUR/GBP through the multi-year top around 09325 towards 0.95 (around 1.15 in Cable), SocGen thinks; the bank sees a softer exit taking the pair to 0.85. EMFX is mixed; ZAR is firmer on risk sentiment, the BRL is up after GDP data beat expectations, reducing the risk of a recession. MXN, however, is lower, with Banxico minutes highlighting the recessionary forces building in the economy (it cut forecasts this week, too). And TRY is lower as oil is firmer, while a newswire poll highlights risks of recession in the future too.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The buck has seen a fresh YTD high on Thursday, in wake of comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, that the US would not intervene in FX for now. After the USD's recent run, UBS strategists are advising clients to hedge against dollar downside, noting five factors that could knock the buck in the medium/long-run: 1) Trade War, and US President Trump strong arming the Fed to cut rates by as much as 100bps; 2) Global Shock, which might trigger foreign repatriation (unhedged or low hedges); 3) Structural alteration, which could include policies like US dollar Intervention and tweaking FX reserve portfolios; 4) Politicisation of the US dollar heading into the 2020 elections, and putting up higher barriers to investment; 5) Abandonment of a Dollar policy. Hedges are at near decade lows.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 1.3% AT 2925, NASDAQ-100 1.5% AT 7702, DOW JONES 1.3% AT 26362, S&amp;P 500 SECTORS: </strong>Consumer Discretionary 1.5%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0%, Energy&nbsp; 1.4%, Financials&nbsp; 1.5%, Health Care&nbsp; 0.8%, Industrials&nbsp; 1.8%, Information Technology&nbsp; 1.7%, Materials&nbsp; 1.2%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 1.3%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.7%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tech behemoths Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC), as well as financials, JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were higher on positive trade rhetoric. AAPL was boosted further after news that it is to release its new iPhone’s on September 10th. Utilities underperformed as risk-on flows dominated. China-sensitive names (which have generated around 400bps of alpha this year, surprisingly) outperformed, with tech and industrials leading the gains; financials also firmed as yields inched up. Dollar Tree (DLTR) missed EPS but beating on sales and SSS, while raising guidance (albeit beneath expectations). The mixed report initially saw DLTR higher however gains were short-lived as it quickly traced back at the market open. Dollar General (DG) beat on both top and bottom-line, as well as SSS. DG also raised its EPS forecast above expectations, but raised its FY revenue forecast slightly beneath the street’s expectations; DG were higher by ~10% on Thursday trade. BestBuy (BBY) underperformed the SPY following its earnings, where sales missed, and the looming tariffs weighed on the stock. Aside from earnings, Altria (MO) were hit as the FTC started a probe into Altria (MO) to see whether JUUL targeted minors with influencers on social media.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* </strong>USD was firmer, with wires citing easing trade tensions between the US and China. Havens were lower. EUR loses ground under 1.11, on the back of aforementioned USD strength; meanwhile, weak German inflation data potentially augurs disappointment in Friday's Eurozone equivalent, which would further ramp pressure on the ECB to loosen policy - dovish comments by Lagarde also were cited; a strengthening CNH also helps; Nikkei reported that China clamps down on capital flight risk as yuan weakens, and financial authorities have rolled out measures to stem capital outflows from the mainland. AUD couldn't build on the positive US/China backdrop, with the Aussie slipping below 0.6730 and setting up a test of 0.67 after weak capex data, ahead of next week's RBA. It's Antipodean counterpart NZD was softer on weak business confidence overnight. CAD is slightly positive against the USD, with risk appetite and higher crude prices providing support ahead of Friday's GDP print. GBP was on the defense amid rising probabilities of a no deal Brexit, which could take EUR/GBP through the multi-year top around 09325 towards 0.95 (around 1.15 in Cable), SocGen thinks; the bank sees a softer exit taking the pair to 0.85. EMFX is mixed; ZAR is firmer on risk sentiment, the BRL is up after GDP data beat expectations, reducing the risk of a recession. MXN, however, is lower, with Banxico minutes highlighting the recessionary forces building in the economy (it cut forecasts this week, too). And TRY is lower as oil is firmer, while a newswire poll highlights risks of recession in the future too.</p><p>* USD: The buck was boosted in wake of comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, that the US would not intervene in FX for now. After the USD's recent run, UBS strategists are advising clients to hedge against dollar downside, noting five factors that could knock the buck in the medium/long-run: 1) Trade War, and US President Trump strongarming the Fed to cut rates by as much as 100bps; 2) Global Shock, which might trigger foreign repatriation (unhedged or low hedges); 3) Structural alteration, which could include policies like US dollar Intervention and tweaking FX reserve portfolios; 4) Politicisation of the US dollar heading into the 2020 elections, and utting up higher barriers to investment; 5) Abandonment of a Dollar policy. Hedges are at near decade lows.</p>",

Elsewhere in news-flow, the Trump administration proposed relaxing President Obama-era limits on methane at oil and gas operations, which would reduce costs for players in the US energy sector, particularly smaller producers; sources report Russian average oil output in August stood at 11.31mln BPD (prev. 11.15mln in July), a step closer towards its OPEC+ output agreement limit of 11.52mln BPD; WSJ reported Saudi Aramco is proposing a two stage IPO later this year, favouring Tokyo’s exchange whilst debuting a portion of its shares on the Saudi stock exchange.</p>",

Analysts at UBS say this week will bring USD 85bln of cash (excluding SOMA holdings) but including around USD 76bln of redemption, as well as around USD 8.5bln of coupons.</p><p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong>&nbsp;SocGen's strategists say the 7-year sector trades cheap in asset swap versus older 7s, but trades fair on the curve against 5s and 10s. Last month's auction was weak, tailing and seeing the softest cover since February 2016. SocGen says the sale will likely need concession this month, since the current when-issued trades below all stop out rates since 2016, and as such, the bank says it is negative on the auction.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/ce86b90d-4d84-4527-9331-2556e29d0e43.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/CAD/JPY/CHF</strong></p><p>Although the Greenback is firmer overall, with the <strong>DXY </strong>extending gains above 98.000 to 98.412, latest (mostly positive) headlines on the US-China trade front have roused enough risk appetite to lift the Aussie and Loonie off worst levels and above their US counterpart, albeit just and both fading within 0.6753-17 and 1.3319-1.3272 parameters. Conversely, the Franc and Yen are underperforming near the base of 0.9843-01 and 106.45-105.84 respective ranges, with the former wary about more SNB verbal intervention after Maechler noted a huge rise in the safe-haven’s allure and said there is lots more room for direct action, while the latter is looking vulnerable chart-wise if it can’t rebound through 106.20-21 (10 and 21 DMAs).</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/NZD</strong></p><p>Also weaker vs the Usd, as the single currency extended losses to 1.1055 and just 5 pips from underlying buying interest reportedly sitting above the 1.1027 ytd base before bouncing. Aside from the aforementioned broad Dollar strength, the Euro was undermined by soft Spanish and German inflation prints and dovish sounding responses by incoming ECB President Lagarde in a letter to EU Parliament ahead of her hearing and vote next week. To recap, she suggested that rates have not hit the lower bound and there are a wide range of policy tools available that the GC should be prepared to use. On the flip-side, ECB’s Knot claims that market expectations for September are overdone and he does not see the case for new asset purchases at the current juncture, while Italian President Mattarella confirmed the new PD-5S coalition and handed Conte control to return as PM, but this was largely a formality. Elsewhere, Sterling continues to suffer from UK Parliament prorogue symptoms with Cable still pivoting 1.2200 and the anti-no deal Brexit camp ramping up efforts to thwart PM Johnson’s moves to prevent a legal challenge. Back down under, the Kiwi has lost recovery momentum between 0.6307-47 vs its US peer and the Aud/Nzd cross has rebounded over 1.0650 in wake of a downbeat ANZ business survey showing declines in confidence and the outlook.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Mixed performances abound across the region, with the Yuan, Rouble and Rand benefiting from the overall improvement in market morale surrounding the state of play between Beijing and Washington on tariffs/trade. However, the Lira is lagging ahead of Friday’s Turkish holiday and Labour Day in the US next Monday, while Argentina’s Peso hit opening/early lows of 60.0000+ again on debt rescheduling plans before paring losses in anticipation of official measures to stem the tide.</p>",

Returning to Europe, the FTSE MIB is the notable outperformer (+1.9%) as the bourse derives strength from the increasing prospect of an Italian coalition forming and thus the budget passing.

However, risk sentiment in general has been boosted by latest updates from China’s Ministry of Commerce confirming that trade teams from Beijing and Washington have been conversing and face-to-face talks in the US next month are contingent on the right atmosphere to nurture constructive negotiations. The index is currently hovering just shy of 98.322 vs 98.156 at one stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/NZD -</strong> All now firmer than their US peer having underperformed prior to the aforementioned US-China trade update, with the Aussie paring losses post an unexpected drop in Q2 Capex and the Kiwi rebounding from lows hit in the aftermath of ANZ’s August business sentiment survey showing a further deterioration in already weak morale, as expectations fell below zero. Similarly, the Loonie has rebounded from worst levels alongside the Yuan and now eyeing Canadian data for some independent impetus later (Q2 current account and June average earnings). Aud/Usd, Nzd/Usd and Usd/Cad currently around 0.6745, 0.6345 and 1.3285 vs circa 06715, 0.6305 and 1.3320 at the other extremes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY/GBP/EUR -</strong> In stark contrast to the recoveries noted above, safe-haven unwinding has pushed the Franc and Yen down further from their recent peaks, with Usd/Chf and Usd/Jpy nudging up towards 0.9850 and 106.35, and the latter through 10/21 DMAs in the 106.20-21 area that could be pivotal from technical perspective. Meanwhile, the Pound is straddling 1.2200 following all the midweek drama in Whitehall and the Euro is weighing up softer Eurozone inflation against firmer GDP and mixed sentiment indicators with little reaction/traction via confirmation that Italy’s Conte has been given the mandate to try again as PM, albeit in charge of a different coalition.

Turning to metals, where <strong>spot gold</strong> remains comfortably above the USD 1500/oz mark but has drifted somewhat in-line with the improvement in risk sentiment thus far; to a session low of USD 1536/oz.

At the moment, the bank says, pessimistic trades by CTAs (selling stocks, buying bonds) are being countered by opposing trades made by global macro hedge funds and other investors that are bullish on the underlying fundamentals. Namely, these fundamental-oriented investors seem skeptical of the idea that a global recession is on the way as macroeconomic indicators continue to hold up surprisingly well in the US and in the Asia-Pacific region. Nomura add that risk-parity funds are refraining from deleveraging, which seems to be lending stability to the credit market.</li><li>Normura suggest that, prior to today’s news, thin trade had allowed opposing strategies to leave the market deadlocked. Without a further increase in volatility, in response to either fresh negative news or a pullback in the bullish stance of fundamentals-oriented investors, CTAs and other investors waiting for a stock sell-off could lose patience and wind down some of their pessimistic trades.</li><li>Taking a broader view; Nomura says it is not seeing any of the three events it believes would likely be game changers, namely 1) realistic expectations for a US-China trade agreement, 2) a virtual promise from the Fed to cut its policy interest rate by 50bp or more, or 3) the cobbling together of a coordinated fiscal policy response. They note that a growing number of short-term investors also look to be waiting on the side-lines, as such, the bank continues to believe that these investors are more likely to chase trends in a risk-off direction than in a risk-on direction.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Snapshot</strong></p><ul><li>Italian President Mattarella has given acting PM Conte a mandate to form a new government. With this to be composed of a coalition between 5SM and PD; although, sticking points in this do remain over the role of 5SM leader and current Deputy PM Di Maio in the coalition.</li></ul><p><strong>Price Action</strong></p><ul><li>Prior to this morning announcement from Mattarella, expectation that PM Conte would be presented with the mandate to form a new government had provided substantial support to Sep'19 BTPs. Which have recently printed contract highs at 146.42, the 10yr yield moving to record lows below 1.0% and the BTP-Bund yield spread at best narrowing to 166bp. These moves are representative of the markets increasing confidence that Italy will be able to meet its debt obligations, with PM Conte having previously managed to avoid sanctions on Italy’s excessive debt on two occasions. Also worth nothing this price action has occurred in the context of prospective ECB action in September, which has been steering much of the recent moves seen across the European fixed income complex.</li></ul><p><strong>What lies ahead for the Italian government?</strong></p><ul><li>The most pivotal immediate task will be the formulation of the 2020 budget and ensuring that its contents meets the requirements set by the European Commission last December.</li><li>Those requirements by the EC state that next year’s budget deficit must be reduced to 1.8% and 2020 lowered to 1.5%.</li><li>ABN AMRO highlights, that alternatively, the new administration could opt to renegotiate those targets or prevent any of the impending ‘safety clauses’. The Dutch Bank notes that “these consist of a VAT-hike or other income-generating measures amounting to EUR 23.1bln (equal to around 1.3% of GDP) in 2020, and EUR 28.8bn in 2021”.</li><li>Complications? Firstly, Italy’s economic situation has become significantly more precarious than it was at the time of the above measures being agreed (e.g. some economist believe that Italy is potentially in recession). Furthermore, although both parties hold a more favourable view of the EU than that of The League, there is little else that binds the two from an ideological standpoint with 5SM more left-leaning than the PD. This has been exemplified by some political commentators noting that the only thing that unites the two parties is a hatred of Matteo Salvini; something which is highly unlikely to lead to a sustainable coalition over the course of a 5 year term. As such, even though elections have been avoided in the immediacy, Italian voters will likely have to return to the polling booth’s at some point next year once the budget has been passed by Parliament and signed off by the EC.</li></ul>",

Nonetheless, the downside for the broader market was limited amid gains in mining names with gold lifted by a mild safe-haven bid and after the energy complex benefitted from the recent bullish inventory data, while the Japanese benchmark gave up initial gains after succumbing to the weight of the flows into JPY. <strong>Hang Seng (-0.4%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%)</strong> were also lacklustre after PBoC inaction resulted to a drain on liquidity and as China plans tighter regulations on share pledging, as well as to reduce risks for small and medium banks. The losses in Hong Kong have also been a function of weak earnings releases including China Construction Bank which was the first of the Big 4 to report and slightly missed on its FY net. Finally, 10yr JGBs received a lift from the downbeat risk tone and after similar advances of their counterparts in US where there was a strong 5yr auction and the yield inversion briefly widened again, while stronger 2yr JGB auction results also added to the upside.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 60bln.

The greenback’s major counterparts were uneventful in which <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> languished below 1.1100 and GBP/USD struggled to hold on to 1.2200 after the recent selling triggered by PM Johnson’s prorogation announcement. Reports also suggested PM Johnson could double down on his efforts by creating new Bank Holidays in the lead up to the Brexit. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> retreated below 106.00 as the downbeat risk tone spurred flows to safe-havens and antipodeans traded lacklustre after weak data in which New Zealand Business Confidence further deteriorated and Australian Capital Expenditure unexpectedly contracted.</p><p><strong>SNB's Maechler</strong> said uncertainty level is quite high, while Swiss inflation pressures remain very weak and that expansionary monetary policy remains needed.

Yields continued to exacerbate their inversion with the 2s10s testing just shy of -0.6bps; on the outlook Nordea noted that inversions deepen for two to three months usually – once initially inverted - based on the past five inversions. The 5-year Note auction saw a chunky 1bps stop through the screens with the B/C ratio at 2.48x (avg. 2.36x); both indirects and dealers took above their six-auction averages, leaving less for dealers in what was evidently a strong auction. At settlement the curve was actually steeper, expect in the belly- to long-end, with Treasury yields lower between 1.5bps to 2.5bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 7 ticks higher at 131.11+.</p><p><strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said issuance of ultra-long bonds are under very serious consideration</strong>, while he added that the US does not intend to intervene in USD for now but the administration has weighed countering USD strength.

Daly also noted that she is currently in a \"watch and see\" position regarding monetary policy but is convinced using tools early and pre-emptively is better than waiting.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mostly lower after failing to sustain the positive, but quiet lead from their counterparts in US where energy outperformed and the DJIA led the majors higher to reclaim the 26000 level. ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) were subdued with focus in Australia centred on earnings including Woolworths which was pressured despite a 56% jump in FY net, as its after-tax profit cont. ops fell 7% and amid continued woes in its Big W business which it is said to mull exiting. Nonetheless, the downside for the broader market was limited amid gains in mining names with gold lifted by a mild safe-haven bid and after the energy complex benefitted from the recent bullish inventory data, while the Japanese benchmark gave up initial gains after succumbing to the weight of the flows into JPY. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were also lacklustre after PBoC inaction resulted to a drain on liquidity and as China plans tighter regulations on share pledging, as well as to reduce risks for small and medium banks. The losses in Hong Kong have also been a function of weak earnings releases including China Construction Bank which was the first of the Big 4 to report and slightly missed on its FY net. Finally, 10yr JGBs received a lift from the downbeat risk tone and after similar advances of their counterparts in US where there was a strong 5yr auction and the yield inversion briefly widened again, while stronger 2yr JGB auction results also added to the upside.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly subdued after failing to sustain the positive, but quiet lead from their counterparts in US where energy outperformed and the DJIA led the majors higher to reclaim the 26000 level. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are lower with focus in Australia centred on earnings including Woolworths which is pressured despite a 56% jump in FY net, as its after-tax profit cont. ops fell 7% and amid continued woes in its Big W business which it is said to mull exiting. Nonetheless, the downside for the broader market is limited amid gains in mining names with gold lifted by a mild safe-haven bid and as the energy complex benefits from the recent bullish inventories, while the Japanese benchmark gave up initial gains after succumbing to the weight of the flows into JPY. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) are also lacklustre after PBoC inaction resulted to a drain on liquidity and as China plans tighter regulations on share pledging, as well as to reduce risks for small and medium banks. The losses in Hong Kong have also been triggered by weak earnings releases including China Construction Bank which was the first of the Big 4 to report.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is relatively flat overnight but off the prior session highs after comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that the administration has weighed countering USD strength although do not intend to intervene in the currency for now, while he also suggested that ultra-long bonds are under very serious consideration. Elsewhere, the greenback’s major counterparts are uneventful with EUR/USD languishing below 1.1100 and with GBP/USD struggling to hold on to the 1.2200 handle after the recent selling triggered by PM Johnson’s announcement to suspend Parliament for 5 weeks. This prorogation of Parliament is widely seen as an attempt to thwart Remainers hopes of blocking a no-deal Brexit, which sparked backlash from both sides of the Commons as well as Brussels, while reports also suggested PM Johnson could double down on his efforts by creating new Bank Holidays. Elsewhere, USD/JPY retreated below 106.00 as the downbeat risk tone spurs flows to safe-havens and antipodeans are lacklustre after weak data in which New Zealand Business Confidence further deteriorated and Australian Capital Expenditure unexpectedly contracted.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they get a lift from the downbeat risk tone and after similar upside of their counterparts in US where there was a strong 5yr auction and the yield inversion briefly widened again, while focus now shifts to the 2yr JGB auction due later.</p>",
