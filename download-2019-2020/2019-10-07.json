There was a pare back of last week’s bull steepening in anticipation of further Fed easing post the poor ISM data, with the overhang of Friday’s relatively decent payrolls report cooling some of the October cut pricing. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Powell is scheduled to provide remarks on monetary policy on Tuesday, too, where the market will be looking for some confirmation on whether the Fed is onboard with an October rate cut.

The week sees US/China talks on Thursday/Friday, which is undoubtedly stealing the limelight, and the EU's deadline for substantial progress for Brexit talks also on Friday (allowing EU officials to mull the UK's proposal ahead of the 17/18th summit). As things stand, newsflow suggests there will be limited progress on both fronts, while a second whistle-blower has reportedly come forward in the Trump impeachment inquiry, further muddying the waters going into election season and potentially playing into foreign opponents’ hands in trade negotiations. Some, however, have argued that the primary concern should be the health of the US economy, following the recent run of mixed data; ahead, we have a speech from Fed Chair Powell on Tuesday (NOTE: Fed policymakers have generally not rung the economic alarm bells just yet), ahead of FOMC minutes on Wednesday, and then a CPI report later in the week, which will all be key in determining whether markets will trade on the 'Fed put' theme, where 'bad data is good' since it may incite Fed dovishness.</p><p><strong>* CHINA TRADE: </strong>China officials are reportedly signalling they are increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by President Trump, Bloomberg reported, and officials have indicated the range of topics they’re willing to discuss has narrowed considerably, sources said. The source added that China's Vice Premier Liu He, who is due to attend negotiations on Thursday, has apparently said he will bring an offer that will not include commitments on reforming Chinese industrial policy, or government subsidies -- which would take a key Trump demand off the table; White House Trade Advisor Navarro repeating afterwards that the deal will have to be a big one, or there wouldn’t be one, didn’t provide reassurance. Later on, Fox reported a similar story, adding that China are prepared to set out a timetable for the harder issues to be worked out next year. China’s Commerce Ministry also stated that what is not in the table and never will be, is changes to their laws to protect IP, a key sticking point in talks, as are government subsidies. China is said to see itself having a stronger hand amid the impeachment crisis, although people close to the Trump administration have suggested a potential impeachment inquiry is not impacting trade talks. NEC Director Kudlow is one of those individuals, where he struck a cautiously optimistic tone later on Monday, stating that further progress could be made later this week and he is open to see what China brings to the table; Kudlow also noted that the delisting of Chinese corporates from the US is not on the table – walking back on previous media reports.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed's George (voter, hawkish dissenter) said if the US consumer were to lose confidence, the Fed might need to rethink its position on rates, but added she had a meeting-by-meeting approach. The Kansas Fed President reiterated that leaving rates unchanged at the September meeting would have been appropriate, and on inflation, that she would accept fluctuations of 100bps around the 2% target and that muted inflation would not warrant a policy response unless downside risks materialise. Fed's Kashkari (dove, voter in 2020) said he did not yet know by how much more the Fed should cut rates, but if a recession comes, then it would be appropriate to use QE.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> UK PM Johnson is reportedly seeking to launch legal action in his attempts to ensure that the UK can leave the EU this month with no deal. Several Government sources cited by the Telegraph said Johnson was willing to go to the Supreme Court in an effort to avoid complying with the so-called Benn Law, that would require him to write a letter asking for an A50 extension. The report also suggests that Johnson plans to 'sabotage' the EU if the UK remains a member beyond October 2019 by vetoing all decisions, and appointing a pro-Brexit commissioner into the new EU commission (with Brexit Party Leader Nigel Farage being touted), though analysts warned this plan may fail since the European Parliament must support Commission nominations. Other reports suggested AG Cox would resign if Johnson did not follow the (Benn) law. Separately, a Scottish Court dismissed a petition designed to force UK PM Johnson to request a Brexit extension should he fail to get a deal with the EU by 19th October, saying that “there can be no doubt that the first respondent [the PM] now accepts that he must comply with the requirements of the 2019 Act and has affirmed that he intends to do so.” The order would have barred him from sending a second letter telling the EU to ignore the request, delaying sending the letter or encouraging other member states to veto extension. Opponents of Johnson’s Brexit strategy, who were reportedly planning an \"ambush\" in parliament (where they would take control of parliamentary proceedings until an extension is secured) failed to come to an agreement today; the 21 Tory rebels who were expelled from the party reportedly want to give the PM more time to thrash out a deal with the EU, and have decided not to work against the government for now. Meanwhile, the opposition Labour and Liberal Democrat Parties are still unable to agree on who should lead a government of national unity (whose purpose would be to secure a Brexit extension), should the government lose a no confidence vote (the Lib Dems refuse to endorse Corbyn as a temporary PM), so the prospect of a vote of no confidence also appears to be on ice.</p><p><strong>* SYRIA/TURKEY: </strong>In a major policy shift, the US announced it has begun withdrawing troops from the Northeast of Syria, a move which paves the way for Turkey to strike Kurdish-led forces (which were previously backed by the US to defeat ISIS in the region), there were reports later in the session Turkeyt had already begun striking Kurdish territories in the region, as US President Trump looks to extract his nation from 'endless wars'. The move has provoked both an international and domestic reaction for Trump - Republicans at home who have previously been supportive of Trump -- like Senator Graham Lindsay -- has denounced the move, and the lack of support shown to US' allies in the region. The move allows Turkey control over ISIS prisoners, which Kurdish forces have considered a 'stab in the back'. Turkey is now expected to mount the third incursion into Syrian territory since 2016 in an effort to contain the Syrian/Kurdish power; it has two objectives, 1) to push Kurdish YPG militia away from its border, and 2) to create a space inside Syria where 2mln Syrian refugees (currently based in Turkey) can be settled. France has warned Turkey against unilateral moves. The Pentagon itself said it does not endorse Turkish operations in Syria, and the US President himself warned prior to the evening’s attacks that if Turkey pursued any action that Trump \"consider[s] to be off limits,\" then he has pledged to \"totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey,\" adding that it is something he has done before.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 12+ TICKS LOWER AT 131-16+:</strong> Treasuries, alongside EGBs, began treading lower in the European session as participants became cautiously optimistic in anticipation of US-China trade talks (reflective in major equity bourses, too), although some ominous updates ahead of the meetings failed to reverse the sell-off (it reversed the gains in equities), desks also noted dealer book squaring ahead of a heavy supply schedule at auctions later in the week. There was a pare back of last week’s bull steepening in anticipation of further Fed easing post the poor ISM data, with the overhang of Friday’s relatively decent payrolls report cooling some of the October cut pricing. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Powell is scheduled to provide remarks on monetary policy on Tuesday, too, where the market will be looking for some confirmation on whether the Fed is onboard with an October rate cut. At Treasury settlement yields were higher, seeing the curve bear flatten – 2s10s narrowed by 3.5bps, taking the spread back beneath 10bps.</p><p><strong>* US 3-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>The Treasury will this week auction a new 3-year note (USD 38bln, Tue), a 10-year re-opening (USD 24bln, Wed), and a 30-year bond re-opening (USD 16bln, Thu). Excluding SOMA holdings, there will be around USD 26bln of cash flows this week (around USD 24bln of redemptions, and USD 2bln of coupons). The complex lacks setup ahead of the auction from a relative value perspective, Societe Generale says, and trades rich in asset swap, and on the curve versus 2s and 5s. The bank thinks the sector appears expensive on an outright basis, with the current when-issued trading below all auction stop out rates since November 2016. The richening of 3s on the curve appears to be a result of the bull-steepening seen since the last auction. SocGen notes that after the recent, Treasuries appear to be consolidating and may be range-bound into the sale, though disruption is possible from geopolitics, of course. Low dealer holdings in the 3s bucket could be supportive of the auction, SocGen argues, though six of the last ten auctions have tailed, adding to the negatives.</p><p><strong>* WTI (X9) SETTLED USD 0.06 LOWER AT USD 52.75/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.02 LOWER AT USD 58.35/BBL: </strong>Crude markets were choppy on Monday, erasing losses seen at the futures open on Sunday night before reversing course into settlement amid back-and-forth China trade sentiment. OPEC's Secretary General Barkindo said they are relying on Russia to assist in smoothing tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and it is premature for OPEC to discuss additional oil output cuts, in-spite of the recent drop in prices. Providing supply concern was the Chinese State Oil Company pulling out of a USD 5bln deal to develop a portion of Iran’s offshore natural gas field amid the country’s escalating tensions with the US. Moreover, on Friday, reports emerged that the Buzzard oilfield in the North Sea (120k BPD) has been shut temporarily for pipework repairs, with no timeline on how quickly operations will return to normal. Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak said Russia should lower oil industry taxes and put into production some 10bln tonnes of oil reserves, before adding that Russia's oil output will decline in the coming years if it does not change taxation laws. Novak also said he considers a mid-term oil price in the USD 50-60/bbl range as fair. Participant in energy markets will be paying close attention to developments in US-China trade talks at the tail-end of the week, after digesting the monthly reports from the EIA (Oct. 8th), OPEC (Oct. 10th) and IEA (Oct. 11th), in addition to the weekly inventory reports. This week’s energy expectations are for crude stocks to show a build of 2.6mln bbls, distillates a draw of 2.3mln and gasoline a draw of 300k; Genscape forecasts Cushing stocks to build 348k.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS (NK/HK): </strong>North Korea<strong> </strong>announced over the weekend that it has abandoned talks with the US. Following the two states’ nuclear talks in Sweden, the US reportedly came empty handed and has upheld its “hostile policy” against North Korea; desks note NK should remain a non-issue unless the country begins testing nuclear weapons and/or ballistic missiles. Further North, the unrest accumulated in Hong Kong too over the weekend – reports suggest protesters were shining lasers at a PLA garrison, in which the Chinese military responded by raising a flag warning the protestors they were in breach of the law and may be prosecuted. The actions of the PLA have raised concerns of Beijing coming closer to being deployed into Hong Kong, something that Chief Executive Carrie Lam can request, although is yet to do so in what would be the first use of said power in 50 years.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS</strong>: S&amp;P 500 -0.5% at 2939, NASDAQ-100 -0.4% at 7725, Dow Jones -0.4% at 26478</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; -0.4%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; -0.8%, Energy&nbsp; -0.9%, Financials&nbsp; -0.5%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.4%, Industrials&nbsp; -0.5%, Information Technology&nbsp; -0.5%, Materials&nbsp; -0.3%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0%, Utilities&nbsp; -0.5%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: ConocoPhillips (COP) traded higher to start the week as it announced it expects to repurchase USD 3bln worth of shares in 2020 as well as a 38% increase to its dividend, taking it to USD 0.42/shr. The latest moves express the commitment for COP to return more than 30% of cash from operations through dividends and buybacks. Nvidia (NVDA) saw a positive mention at RBC, which expects the name to be the best performing large cap within the next 6-9 months, citing a pickup in gaming demand and a recovery in the Nvidia data centre. General Motors (GM) initially opened lower after reports that talks with UAW had taken a turn for the worse as the automaker’s counteroffer was rejected; talks continue. General Electric’s (GE) move to reduce its pension deficit by USD 5-8bln saw the name in trade firmer, whereas Dollar Tree (DLTR) fell after its chairman disclosed a sale of 70k shares. In broker moves, Match (MTCH) was upgraded to buy at both Deutsche Bank and Nomura from hold and neutral, respectively; Moody’s (MCO) and E-trade (ETFC) were upgraded to buy from neutral at UBS; Citi upgraded Uber (UBER) to buy from neutral, as the bank is optimistic about a positive shift around sentiment regarding its core-ride sharing business. Wendy’s (WEN) were downgraded to market perform from outperform at Cowen, noting the breakfast menu launch does not create a long-term competitive advantage.</p><p><strong>* CANADA ELECTION DEBATE:</strong> Ahead of 21st October General Elections, leaders will hold a debate on Monday evening in English, and on Thursday in French. Current polling has PM Trudeau's Liberal Party (34.2%) slightly ahead of the Conservatives (33.7%). CBS said that, although the gap remains insignificant, the Liberals have moved ahead of the Conservatives in the national polling average for the first time since February; they are also ahead in the seat projection, though it is a toss-up whether they could secure a majority of seats. CBS added that neither the New Democrats nor the Greens have been able to build any significant momentum so far during this campaign, though the Bloc Québécois has gained.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>EUR </strong>and <strong>CAD</strong> were range bound vs the <strong>buck</strong> ahead of key risks later in the week (trade, Fed minutes, CPI), with idiosyncratic developments in the form of bad German Industrial Output data, and firmer crude prices failing to provide much impetus. EURUSD remains bound between 1.0960 (Friday’s low) and 1.1000 (Thursday’s high) parameters, while Cable and USDCAD are supported ahead of the 1.2300 and 1.3300 marks respectively. <strong>Antipodes</strong> are lower, with the latest negative US/China trade headlines doing little to help; AUDUSD lost the 0.6750 mark while NZDUSD fell below 0.6300. <strong>Havens</strong> lost some ground today as <strong>XAU</strong> falls back beneath the 1500 level, and <strong>USDJPY</strong> breached 107 handle to the upside (the cross found resistance just shy of 107.50) likely supported by rate differentials as US yields picked up throughout the session; CHF was slightly firmer, however. The <strong>Scandies</strong> weakened, lead by <strong>SEK</strong>, with desks pointing to the recent run of bad data (PMIs and employment), recent gloomy Riksbank commentary and broader concerns over trade/global growth. EURSEK made fresh YTD highs, topping out just shy of 10.90 while EURNOK broke back above the 10.00 mark. In <strong>EMFX</strong>, <strong>TRY</strong> is the notable underperformer, after the US President Trump withdrew US forces from northern Syria, effectively opening the door for a Turkish invasion of the region. Trump also warned Turkey that if it were to do anything “off limits”, he would destroy and obliterate their economy.</p>",

OPEC's Secretary General Barkindo said they are relying on Russia to assist in smoothing tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and it is premature for OPEC to discuss additional oil output cuts, in-spite of the recent drop in prices. Providing supply concern was the Chinese State Oil Company pulling out of a USD 5bln deal to develop a portion of Iran’s offshore natural gas field amid the country’s escalating tensions with the US. Moreover, on Friday, reports emerged that the Buzzard oilfield in the North Sea (120k BPD) has been shut temporarily for pipework repairs, with no timeline on how quickly operations will return to normal. Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak said Russia should lower oil industry taxes and put into production some 10bln tonnes of oil reserves, before adding that Russia's oil output will decline in the coming years if it does not change taxation laws. Novak also said he considers a mid-term oil price in the USD 50-60/bbl range as fair. Participant in energy markets will be paying close attention to developments in US-China trade talks at the tail-end of the week, after digesting the monthly reports from the EIA (Oct. 8th), OPEC (Oct. 10th) and IEA (Oct. 11th), in addition to the weekly inventory reports. This week’s energy expectations are for crude stocks to show a build of 2.6mln bbls, distillates a draw of 2.3mln and gasoline a draw of 300k; Genscape forecasts Cushing stocks to build 348k.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>SEK/NOK/TRY</strong></p><p>The Swedish Krona has dropped to the bottom of the major ranks as a negative combination of sub-50 PMIs, gloomy/dovish Riksbank remarks, broader jitters about global trade, growth and geopolitics finally triggered selling through the previous ytd low vs the Euro. In fact, Eur/Sek has now rallied to just shy of 10.9000 and Crown bears are now eyeing a Fib at 10.9452 ahead of the 11.0000 handle that Nordea is flagging for the cross by the end of 2019. Staying in Scandinavia, Eur/Nok is tagging along and now on a firmer footing above 10.0000 within 9.9778-10.0442 parameters, as some pundits predict an even weaker trajectory for Norway’s Crown given that Norges Bank has seemingly delivered its final 25 bp hike in the cycle. For the record, Eur/Nok’s all time high is circa 10.1700 and Nordea believes this could be surpassed by year end with the cross up to 10.2500. Meanwhile, the Lira is also under pressure on monetary policy grounds after latest benign if not outright or relatively soft Turkish inflation data upped the ante for more rate cuts. However, investors are wary about Turkey’s plans to take military action in Northern Syria and restart drilling off Cyprus as well, with Usd/Try up over 5.7900 at one stage.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Back to G10 land, the Antipodean Dollars remain on the back foot, albeit off worst levels between 0.6768-33 and 0.6321-0.6284 vs their US rival respectively, with latest US-China trade headlines/reports hardly conducive for the resumption of high level negotiations later this week. In short, Beijing is said to have scaled down its agenda for talks, while President Trump appears intent on reaching a comprehensive agreement rather than any interim accord.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/CAD/GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed and rangebound vs a fading Greenback, with the <strong>DXY</strong> losing its post-NFP recovery momentum as the index slips back from 98.989 to 98.738, but Usd/Chf has inched a bit further below 0.9950 and Eur/Usd touched 1.1000. Elsewhere, Usd/Cad dipped under 1.3300 amidst a gradual rise in crude prices and Cable is on a firmer 1.2300+ footing, but still wary about no deal Brexit risk after a petition designed to enforce the Benn extension bill was rejected pending appeal tomorrow. Usd/Jpy has not ventured far from 107.00 or mostly south of the big figure due to underlying safe-haven premium after US-NK talks broke down and US-Iran tensions continued, with the headline pair not really reacting to news that President Trump will be signing off on the US-Japanese trade deal later today.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>Nomura see an end to the recent decline in global equities, and expect sentiment to head toward recovery as expected unless the US-China trade talks on 10-11 October bring additional bad news. Hedge fund positioning in US and Asian equities going into the US/China talks this week suggests two things, the bank argues. Firstly, the possibility that worries about downside for US equity could be fading and secondly, the possibility that global macro hedge funds and other investors may be expecting a further rally for Asian equities. Looking at hedge funds in the HFR global hedge fund index (HFRXGL), Nomura see that net exposure to US equity (30-day beta) fell sharply after last week's selloff. “We think this is because trend-following investors, as exemplified by CTAs, pared their US long positions on net, and/or cash-focused participants such as long/short funds built market-neutral positions” says the bank. Moreover, global macro hedge funds focused on top-down fundamentals appear to be building exposure to Asia equity, indicating that they may have begun factoring in a scenarios such as the US-China trade talks resulting in some sort of agreement favourable to China, leading to a bottoming in China's economy, and a resultant rally in Chinese and other Asia stocks.</li><li>Nomura estimate that CTAs will continue to pare their long equity futures positions, and the bank will be watching whether stock indices break through the major breakeven thresholds (2,970 for the S&amp;P 500, 7,750 for the NDX, 26,680 for the DOW) heading toward the end of the week, which could halt any CTA long unwinding. Global macro hedge funds, the bank adds, have taken some profits on US equity long positions and closed out US bond short positions, and also look to have closed out all their US bond shorts by the end of last week in anticipation of disappointing US macro indicators.</li></ul>",

(Newswires)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p><strong>Major European indices (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.2%) are little changed, </strong>after a weekend report alleged that China is narrowing scope for a trade deal with the US ahead of principle-level talks in Washington this week, with Chinese officials this week expected to offer a deal that doesn’t include anything on industrial policy or subsidies. Some desks tried to frame the reports as a positive, arguing that such concessions from China at this stage were very unlikely anyway, and adding that the article also talked about the possibility of the US and China making progress on a “mini deal” (where China could agree to making large-scale agricultural/energy purchases from the US and alter some IP practices in exchange for the US rolling back a partial amount of the existing tariffs). Such a mini deal, as hinted by the report, would likely exceed expectations for the talks, as most investors look for something more akin to a truce rather than any meaningful de-escalation. However, US President Trump has repeatedly shot down the prospect of any mini-deal, saying he would rather a full and comprehensive deal. As such, China’s refusal to engage with key US demands is likely to be seen as a negative for the long-term prospects of a comprehensive trade deal between the two sides. The sector layout is reflective of fragile risk sentiment; the defensive Utilities (0.3%), Consumer Staples (+0.4%) and Health Care (+0.6%) sectors are well supported while Consumer Discretionary (-0.1%), Tech (U/C) and Industrials (-0.1%) are underperforming. In terms of individual movers; Osram Licht (-4.3%) shares sunk after ASM (-3.3%) failed in its takeover bid for the Co., but said it would explore further strategic options to pursue the acquisition, with ASM shares pressured over investor concerns about the companies continued pursuit of the German lighting company. HSBC (-0.4%) shares were under pressure on the news that the Co. is to undertake a cost-cutting programme, which may affect 10k jobs. Bayer (2.5%) shares moved higher on the news that its October 15th trial date for the its US glyphosate case had been delayed until February 2020 (indicatively February 10th). Finally, LSE (U/C) opened higher after the Co. set a Wednesday deadline for the Hong Kong Exchange to place a revised takeover offer.</p><p><strong>General Electric (GE) </strong>plans to reduce its pension deficit by roughly USD 5-8bln and freeze its US pension plan for about 20,000 employees with salaried benefits. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>AUD/NZD - The Aussie and Kiwi are bearing the brunt of renewed trade and geopolitical tensions having benefited from initial/brief Greenback weakness in the aftermath of last Friday’s ‘Goldilocks’ US jobs report. China is reportedly setting a limited agenda for talks in Washington this week, while discussions between the US and North Korea about denuclearisation were cut short over the weekend as an envoy from Pyongyang called for the Trump administration to withdraw hostile policy. Moreover, Turkey is back in the headlines with a resumption of drilling off Cyprus and operations in Northern Syria, while efforts to quell protests in Hong Kong have failed to prevent more violence and clashes. Aud/Usd is back below 0.6750 and Nzd/Usd has lost grip of the 0.6300 handle even though the Aud/Nzd cross is straddling 1.0700 amidst a bearish call from ANZ for the Kiwi to hit 0.5900 vs the Buck by Q1 next year.</p><p>SEK/GBP - The other major underperformers as the Swedish Krona continues to lament last week’s contractionary manufacturing and services PMIs alongside relatively downbeat Riksbank rhetoric via Jansson, while Sterling is suffering from fresh UK political and Brexit jitters following a lukewarm reception to PM Johnson’s proposals for the Irish border and ultimatum from the EU to alter the alternative plan by the end of the week. Eur/Sek just notched a new 2019 peak over 10.8700 and Cable has slipped back below 1.2300 with Eur/Gbp nestling above 0.8900.</p><p>CHF/JPY - In contrast to other G10 currencies, and despite the Dollar’s overall recovery from post-NFP lows (DXY nudging 99.000 again vs 98.720 at one stage on Friday), the Franc and Yen are both holding firm with Usd/Chf pivoting 0.9950, Eur/Chf hovering above 1.0900 and Usd/Jpy meandering between 107.02-106.58. Safe-haven positioning is impacting to an extent, while the Franc is also consolidating after recent quite hefty losses and the Yen is contained by decent option expiries in close proximity (1.5 bn at 106.70, 1.2 bn from 107.00-10 and 1.1 bn from 107.40-50).</p><p>EUR/CAD - The single currency is still hugging a tight line just under 1.1000 against the Greenback, and not too perturbed by yet more evidence of Eurozone economic woes in the form of German factory orders and Sentix sentiment, but the headline pair may constrained by expiry interest like Usd/Jpy given 1.4 bn sitting at 1.0950-60 and 1.1 bn at 1.0990-1.1000 into the NY cut. Elsewhere, the Loonie is trying to cap losses south of 1.3300 following Friday’s collapse in both measures of the Canadian Ivey PMI.</p><p>EM - Broad losses vs the Usd, with the Try undermined by the aforementioned Turkish factors and not deriving much in the way of support from President Erdogan lauding the CBRT for its policy actions, albeit anticipating more easing ahead.

However, US Treasuries remain reticent and the curve is marginally steeper ahead of more jobs data and Fed speak.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Crude markets advanced on Monday, erasing losses seen at the futures open on Sunday night, where prices had initially been pressured by seemingly negative US/China trade headlines over the weekend; WTI Nov’ 19 and Brent Nov’ 19 futures have reclaimed the USD 53.00/bbl and USD 58.50/bbl levels to the upside respectively. Supply side factors could be providing some support; Chinese State Oil Company pulled out of a USD 5bln deal to develop a portion of Iran’s offshore natural gas field amid the country’s escalating tensions with the US. Moreover, on Friday, reports emerged that the Buzzard oilfield in the North Sea has been shut temporarily for pipework repairs, with no timeline on how quickly operations will return to normal. The Buzzard field is the key contributor to the Forties blend, says Platts, and output at the field has been running at around 120k bpd. ING conclude that “an extended outage would likely provide some relative support to Brent”. Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novack said Russia should lower oil industry taxes and put into production some 10bln tonnes of oil reserves, before adding that Russia's oil output will decline in the coming years if it does not change taxation laws.

Some desks tried to frame the reports as a positive, arguing that such concessions from China at this stage were very unlikely anyway, and adding that the article also talked about the possibility of the US and China making progress on a “mini deal” (where China could agree to making large-scale agricultural/energy purchases from the US and alter some IP practices in exchange for the US rolling back a partial amount of the existing tariffs). Such a mini deal, as hinted by the report, would likely exceed expectations for the talks, as most investors look for something more akin to a truce rather than any meaningful de-escalation. However, US President Trump has repeatedly shot down the prospect of any mini-deal, saying he would rather a full and comprehensive deal. As such, China’s refusal to engage with key US demands is likely to be seen as a negative for the long-term prospects of a comprehensive trade deal between the two sides. The sector layout is reflective of fragile risk sentiment; the defensive Utilities (0.3%), Consumer Staples (+0.4%) and Health Care (+0.6%) sectors are well supported while Consumer Discretionary (-0.1%), Tech (U/C) and Industrials (-0.1%) are underperforming. In terms of individual movers; Osram Licht (-4.3%) shares sunk after ASM (-3.3%) failed in its takeover bid for the Co., but said it would explore further strategic options to pursue the acquisition, with ASM shares pressured over investor concerns about the companies continued pursuit of the German lighting company. HSBC (-0.4%) shares were under pressure on the news that the Co. is to undertake a cost-cutting programme, which may affect 10k jobs. Bayer (2.5%) shares moved higher on the news that its October 15th trial date for the its US glyphosate case had been delayed until February 2020 (indicatively February 10th). Finally, LSE (U/C) opened higher after the Co. set a Wednesday deadline for the Hong Kong Exchange to place a revised takeover offer.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>AUD/NZD - The Aussie and Kiwi are bearing the brunt of renewed trade and geopolitical tensions having benefited from initial/brief Greenback weakness in the aftermath of last Friday’s ‘Goldilocks’ US jobs report. China is reportedly setting a limited agenda for talks in Washington this week, while discussions between the US and North Korea about denuclearisation were cut short over the weekend as an envoy from Pyongyang called for the Trump administration to withdraw hostile policy. Moreover, Turkey is back in the headlines with a resumption of drilling off Cyprus and operations in Northern Syria, while efforts to quell protests in Hong Kong have failed to prevent more violence and clashes. Aud/Usd is back below 0.6750 and Nzd/Usd has lost grip of the 0.6300 handle even though the Aud/Nzd cross is straddling 1.0700 amidst a bearish call from ANZ for the Kiwi to hit 0.5900 vs the Buck by Q1 next year.</p><p>SEK/GBP - The other major underperformers as the Swedish Krona continues to lament last week’s contractionary manufacturing and services PMIs alongside relatively downbeat Riksbank rhetoric via Jansson, while Sterling is suffering from fresh UK political and Brexit jitters following a lukewarm reception to PM Johnson’s proposals for the Irish border and ultimatum from the EU to alter the alternative plan by the end of the week. Eur/Sek just notched a new 2019 peak over 10.8700 and Cable has slipped back below 1.2300 with Eur/Gbp nestling above 0.8900.</p><p>CHF/JPY - In contrast to other G10 currencies, and despite the Dollar’s overall recovery from post-NFP lows (DXY nudging 99.000 again vs 98.720 at one stage on Friday), the Franc and Yen are both holding firm with Usd/Chf pivoting 0.9950, Eur/Chf hovering above 1.0900 and Usd/Jpy meandering between 107.02-106.58. Safe-haven positioning is impacting to an extent, while the Franc is also consolidating after recent quite hefty losses and the Yen is contained by decent option expiries in close proximity (1.5 bn at 106.70, 1.2 bn from 107.00-10 and 1.1 bn from 107.40-50).</p><p>EUR/CAD - The single currency is still hugging a tight line just under 1.1000 against the Greenback, and not too perturbed by yet more evidence of Eurozone economic woes in the form of German factory orders and Sentix sentiment, but the headline pair may constrained by expiry interest like Usd/Jpy given 1.4 bn sitting at 1.0950-60 and 1.1 bn at 1.0990-1.1000 into the NY cut. Elsewhere, the Loonie is trying to cap losses south of 1.3300 following Friday’s collapse in both measures of the Canadian Ivey PMI.</p><p>EM - Broad losses vs the Usd, with the Try undermined by the aforementioned Turkish factors and not deriving much in the way of support from President Erdogan lauding the CBRT for its policy actions, albeit anticipating more easing ahead. The Lira has been sub-5.7550, but now paring back.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Far from an FTQ, but the 10 year German benchmark is edging higher and marginally extended the Eurex session peak at 174.72 (+23 ticks vs -4 ticks) in wake of yet more worrying Eurozone data and survey releases, with Gilts up in the slipstream to 134.95 (+5 ticks vs -17 ticks at worst) amidst the ongoing Brexit stalemate and pressure on PM Johnson to come up with a deal or go back to Brussels and ask for more time. However, US Treasuries remain reticent and the curve is marginally steeper ahead of more jobs data and Fed speak.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Crude markets advanced on Monday, erasing losses seen at the futures open on Sunday night, where prices had initially been pressured by seemingly negative US/China trade headlines over the weekend; WTI Nov’ 19 and Brent Nov’ 19 futures have reclaimed the USD 53.00/bbl and USD 58.50/bbl levels to the upside respectively. Supply side factors could be providing some support; Chinese State Oil Company pulled out of a USD 5bln deal to develop a portion of Iran’s offshore natural gas field amid the country’s escalating tensions with the US. Moreover, on Friday, reports emerged that the Buzzard oilfield in the North Sea has been shut temporarily for pipework repairs, with no timeline on how quickly operations will return to normal. The Buzzard field is the key contributor to the Forties blend, says Platts, and output at the field has been running at around 120k bpd. ING conclude that “an extended outage would likely provide some relative support to Brent”. Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novack said Russia should lower oil industry taxes and put into production some 10bln tonnes of oil reserves, before adding that Russia's oil output will decline in the coming years if it does not change taxation laws. Novak also said he considers a mid-term oil price in the USD 50s are fair. In terms of metals, Copper and Gold prices moved lower on Monday but are cautious within recent ranges ahead of this week’s key risk events, which include US/China trade talks, FOMC and ECB Minutes, US CPI and a slew of Fed speak including a triple appearance from Fed Chair Powell. ING observe that the PBOC added 0.19mln/oz of gold to its reserves in the month of September, taking total reserves to 62.64mln/oz, a tenth consecutive month of gold purchases by China, which the bank says reflects the diversification drive away from the US dollar at a time of trade friction with the US. “Gold demand from Central Banks and ETFs has been stronger this year on economic and geopolitical concerns” the bank adds, “however higher prices have started to weigh on retail demand”, which recently is most evident in the large fall in demand by its usual largest buyer, India.</p>",

Rosengren added that the overall US economic growth will be around 1.7% for Q3/Q4 in 2019 and the data in recent weeks is not a complete surprise, tariffs effecting both manufacturing and exports.

The rate cut was the fifth this year, and was sized at 25bps, as opposed to the 35bps cut seen at the previous MPC. The repo rate now stands at 5.15%, lowest since 2010. The RBI said the decision was driven by the recent economic weakness.

        "content": "<p>Asian equities kick-start the week mostly higher after US stocks closed in the green on Friday following a “goldilocks” US jobs report which was robust enough to temper recession fears but lacklustre enough to keep the Fed on track to cut rates again in October, albeit upside in the region is capped amid reports that that China is narrowing scope for a trade deal with the US ahead of talks in Washington this week. ASX 200 (+0.4%) is kept afloat by mining names after base metals posted gains late Friday, meanwhile Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) bucks the trend as exporters are pressured by a firmer domestic currency. Elsewhere KOSPI (+0.4%) shrugged off the breakdown of North Korea/US denuclearisation dialogue on Sunday as South Korea focuses on the upcoming large-cap earnings, with heavyweight Samsung Electronics expected to announce its Q3 guidance tomorrow. As a reminder, Hong Kong and Mainland China are closed due to public holidays.</p><p>In FX, DXY trades sideways within a narrow intraday band ahead of this week’s key risk events which include US/China trade talks, FOMC and ECB Minutes, US CPI and a slew of Fed speak including a double appearance from Fed Chair Powell. EUR/USD and GBP/USD remain flat above 1.0975 and 1.2300 respectively, with sources noting that UK PM Johnson is poised to go to the Supreme court to avoid having to write a letter to the EU asking for an another Article 50 extension, which comes as the PM’s Brexit proposals look increasingly unlikely to morph into a deal. Elsewhere, USD/JPY remains subdued as reports of China narrowing its scope for a trade deal coupled with the breakdown in North Korea and US talks caused the pair to gap lower at the open, USD/JPY remains sub-107.00 with 1.6bln in options expiring at strike 106.70 at the NY cut. AUD/USD and NZD/USD are choppy and remain subdued by the aforementioned China news, albeit more so the Aussie as the pair tested 0.6750 to the downside at one point. Meanwhile, its Kiwi counterpart fares slightly better as the AUD/NZD cross fell back below the 1.07 mark, however some downside in NZD/USD coincided with ANZ forecasting the pair at 0.5900 by the end of March 2020, citing a lower OCR and uncertainty surrounding capital decision.</p>",
