Furthermore, Governor Carney stated there would be some increases in rates over the next three years if economy grows as forecast and BoE Deputy Governor Broadbent stated that the downward sloping oil curve is pushing down on the bank's inflation forecasts.</p><p>Projections in the accompanying QIR were based on a path for the Bank rate that rises to around 1% by the end of the forecast horizon.

The WSJ reported that Walmart (WMT) is to trail a new store employee structure with less mid-level managers overseeing workers, the stock remained under pressure throughout the session. Tesla (TSLA) opened higher despite announcing it seeks to raise USD 2 bln via debt/equity, and also, CEO announced plan to buy 41k shares of common stock worth USD 10mln; TSLA gains were extended after a US Senator introduced the mineral security act, aimed at removing regulatory obstacles in the electric vehicle material supply chain. Qualcomm (QCOM) shares opened higher after the chipmaker beat analyst expectation on both the top and bottom lines, shrugging off a downward revision to Q3 profit guidance. Under Armour (UA, UAA) jumped higher at the open after the sportwear maker beat top and bottom-line expectations. Discovery Communications (DISCA, DISCK) shares fell despite the broadcaster authorising an additional USD 1bln in buy-backs. Apollo Global (APO) announced plans to convert from a publicly traded partnership to a corporation, effective as of Q3. Fluor (FLR) was lower after reporting a Q1 loss, missed revenue expectations by a significant amount, and the construction and engineering Co.'s CEO Seaton stepped down. Teva (TEVA) shares fell at the open, despite earnings meeting analyst expectations on the top and bottom line. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) caught a bid after the healthcare co. raised profit guidance for FY19. Energy names, including Chevron (CVX), ExxonMobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP) finished the session lower, having come under pressure from falling oil prices. The financial sector, including names such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and JP Morgan Chase (JPM), outperformed on the day on rising bond yields. SPX -0.2% at 2917, NDX -0.4% at 7724, DJI -0.5% at 26307.</p><p>US Treasuries once again had a slow start to the session in Asia-Pac, but as the Europeans returned from holiday, some selling was noted after poor German data. Henceforth the selling stalled after stellar US factory orders (MM 1.9% vs. prev. -0.3% &amp; exp. 1.6%) that detracted from some weekly claims ticking up, and durable goods revisions. Thereafter, while the day’s headline grabber came from source reports suggesting an impasse on US-Sino trade-talks, little follow through was seen in USTs, which diverged on Thursday from a declining stock space. As such the block flattener noted following the US data (12k+ in TYM9 vs. 3k+ Ultra Longs) set the tone for the day with 10yr yield approaching its 50DMA towards the close, and futures settling 13 ticks lower at 123-13+. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed, but not significantly moved. US T-note futures (M9) settled 13 ticks lower at 123-13+.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities down, dollar up, Treasuries down, crude down.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW: </strong>BoE leaves rates unchanged, US Factory Orders beat, Moore withdraws nomination</p><p><strong>* COMING UP: </strong>EZ CPI (Apr/A), CHF CPI (Apr), UK Markit serv/comp PMI (Apr), NOR unemployment (Apr), TUR CPI (Apr); US NFP (Apr), ISM Non-Mfg (Apr), Markit serv/comp PMI (Apr/F), durable goods (Mar/F), factory orders (Mar); Fed’s Clarida (v), Williams (v), Bullard (v), Daly, Kaplan, Mester.</p><p><strong>* FRIDAYS’S EARNINGS: </strong>BRK, AMT, D</p><p><strong>* BOE MPC REVIEW: </strong>The MPC opted to stand pat on rates at 0.75%, in a 9-0 vote, as was seen by the consensus, and dispelling outside calls for hawkish dissent in the wake of a recently published Telegraph article which floated the possibility for this meeting. Last month’s extension to the Brexit deadline continues to tie the hands of policymakers with the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU still unknown. Albeit, the MPC’s projections “continue to assume a smooth adjustment to the average range of possible outcomes for the UK’s eventual trading relationship with the EU”. Despite the ongoing limbo created by Brexit the MPC continues to judge “that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with its Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate…”. Governor Carney followed this theme up in the accompanying press conference by suggesting that if the QIR forecasts materialise, more hikes would be needed than are currently shown in the curve; Capital Economics concludes that “the key message is once again that the markets are too sanguine about the outlook for interest rates,” and it also suggests this sentiment is reflected in the accompanying inflation projections as market-pricing of one hike in the three-year horizon appears to be at odds with the MPC’s thinking that “about two 25bp hikes would be required to hit the 2% inflation target”. More specifically, on the inflation projections, policymakers assess that CPI is expected to remain fairly close to the 2% target, picking up slightly in April before easing back to just below target; 2019 Q2: 2.1% (Prev. 1.9%), 2020 Q2: 1.7% (Prev. 2.2%), 2021 Q2: 2.1% (Prev. 2.1%), 2022 Q2: 2.2%. On the growth front, as envisaged ahead of the release, the MPC revised higher their forecast for Q1 growth of 0.3% to 0.5%. However, policymakers noted that the increase is largely as a by-product of UK and EU companies stockpiling ahead of Brexit. Furthermore, this boost is expected to be temporary with Q2 growth expected to slow to 0.2%. Overall, Lloyds concludes “the Bank of England maintained its ‘wait-and-see’ approach despite the fundamentals making a stronger case for higher interest rates”, adding that “any turn in market expectations is likely to require some lifting of the ‘fog of Brexit’ and for the UK’s future relationship with the EU to become clearer”.</p><p><strong>* NFP PREVIEW: </strong>The Street is looking for a trend-like 185k nonfarm payrolls headline, with the unemployment rate seen unchanged. Average hourly wage growth is seen ticking up, however. Payroll indicators are mixed, heading into the data, although jobless claims falling to cyclical lows in the survey week augur well; however, other gauges, like ISM’s manufacturing PMI, as well as Challenger’s assessment of the labour market call for some caution, analysts say. To download the report, please click <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21743/download\">here.</a></p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>Mid-session, headlines began to circulate suggesting that US/China negotiations had hit an impasse, which was slightly at odds with earlier reports from a Chinese newspaper suggesting Chinese Foreign Minister Yi is set to travel to the US next week to close the deal, as well as source reports yesterday suggesting a deal would be closed by the end of next week. Although stocks took a turn for the worse at the time, analysts remained sceptical as to the legitimacy of the report and soon had their suspicion confirmed as the US Minister of Commerce Ross commented that talks were in the ‘end-game’ and both sides continue to make progress on a range of issues. Ross also remarked that the US is not likely to get the desired commitments from China to cut back on industrial subsidies and that expects US govt to continue to use Section 301 despite potential US/China trade deal, whilst also mentioning that business community believes getting a deal sooner is better than getting no deal in the long run.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's Weidmann said that German consumption slowdown is temporary, and an eventual pick-up is expected, adding consumption was showing initial signs of recovery. Separately, EU's Juncker said Weidmann would be a suitable candidate for the ECB President position. ECB's Rehn said the ECB shouldn't jump the gun after the first sign of stronger data. ECB's Nowotny said a medium-term perspective needs to be taken with regards to growth, and that the US and Eurozone have different measures of inflation, and it would make sense to discuss how this is measured.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed Board Nominee Stephen Moore withdrew his candidacy, citing unrelenting attacks on his character that had become untenable for himself and his family.</p><p><strong>* WTI (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.79 LOWER AT 61.81/BBL; BRENT (M9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.43 LOWER AT 70.75/BBL</strong>. Weakness in the crude complex saw, at lows, Brent and WTI with 69- and 60- handles, respectively, on Thursday. Some suggest that it is a deepening of the technical correction in the 2019 rally. Citi suggests that the Russian crude situation may have been playing a role: \"Russian crude oil production was weighing on market sentiment as output was still above the OPEC+ target, but we note the 11.23mln BPD output for April was still 70k BPD lower than in March, and the 40k BPD surplus over its 11.191mln BPD quota does not strike as particularly material, particularly after recent pipeline contamination issues and the resulting cut in Urals exports to Europe.\" The bank also notes that the other potential driver of the weakness is the 12.3mln BPD record weekly production estimate, as well as this week's larger-than-expected 9.9mln barrels build in crude stocks, underscoring that the WTI market is not physically tight. \"In fact, total US commercial crude oil inventories of 470mln barrels for the week ended 26/April were the highest since September 2017,\" and \"this stockpile seems to be the fundamental anchor pulling prices down at the moment.\"</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.2% at 2917, NDX -0.4% at 7724, DJI -0.5% at 26307. SECTORS: Communications -0.9%, Cons Discretionary -0.0%, Cons Staples -0.1%, Energy -1.7%, Financials +0.2%, Healthcare +0.5%, Industrials -0.1%, Materials -0.6%, Tech -0.5%, Telecoms -0.5%, Utilities -0.3%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> DowDuPont (DWDP) missed revenue expectations for Q1, CEO also announced the possible sale of six units, with a combined USD 2bln of sales. 3M (MMM) opened lower after the industrial conglomerate announced it would acquire medical device maker Acelity for USD 6.7bln. The WSJ reported that Walmart (WMT) is to trail a new store employee structure with less mid-level managers overseeing workers, the stock remained under pressure throughout the session. Tesla (TSLA) opened higher despite announcing it seeks to raise USD 2 bln via debt/equity, and also, CEO announced plan to buy 41k shares of common stock worth USD 10mln; TSLA gains were extended after a US Senator introduced the mineral security act, aimed at removing regulatory obstacles in the electric vehicle material supply chain. Qualcomm (QCOM) shares opened higher after the chipmaker beat analyst expectation on both the top and bottom lines, shrugging off a downward revision to Q3 profit guidance. Under Armour (UA, UAA) jumped higher at the open after the sportwear maker beat top and bottom-line expectations. Discovery Communications (DISCA, DISCK) shares fell despite the broadcaster authorising an additional USD 1bln in buy-backs. Apollo Global (APO) announced plans to convert from a publicly traded partnership to a corporation, effective as of Q3. Fluor (FLR) was lower after reporting a Q1 loss, missed revenue expectations by a significant amount, and the construction and engineering Co.'s CEO Seaton stepped down. Teva (TEVA) shares fell at the open, despite earnings meeting analyst expectations on the top and bottom line. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) caught a bid after the healthcare co. raised profit guidance for FY19. Energy names, including Chevron (CVX), ExxonMobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP) finished the session lower, having come under pressure from falling oil prices. The financial sector, including names such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and JP Morgan Chase (JPM), outperformed on the day on rising bond yields.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 13 TICKS LOWER AT 123-13+.</strong> US Treasuries once again had a slow start to the session in Asia-Pac, but as the Europeans returned from holiday, some selling was noted after poor German data. Henceforth the selling stalled after stellar US factory orders (MM 1.9% vs. prev. -0.3% &amp; exp. 1.6%) that detracted from some weekly claims ticking up, and durable goods revisions. Thereafter, while the day’s headline grabber came from source reports suggesting an impasse on US-Sino trade-talks, little follow through was seen in USTs, which diverged on Thursday from a declining stock space. As such the block flattener noted following the US data (12k+ in TYM9 vs. 3k+ Ultra Longs) set the tone for the day with 10yr yield approaching its 50DMA towards the close, and futures settling 13 ticks lower at 123-13+. At settlement, major curve spreads were mixed, but not significantly moved.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD</strong> continued yesterday's bullish post FOMC momentum, garnering further support after higher than expected factory orders data, while participants continue to chew the fat over a more-hawkish-than-expected FOMC press conference. <strong>EUR</strong> weakened for a second day, failing to benefit from mostly positive EZ final manufacturing PMI data. <strong>GBP</strong> weakened alongside the EUR despite solid domestic manufacturing PMI data, unable to overcome FOMC dollar strength and safe haven flows into the yen. <strong>JPY</strong> strengthened amid distinct a risk-off tone that saw stocks fall to seven-day lows, with USDJPY breaking back below 111.50. Petro-currencies, including <strong>CAD</strong>, <strong>NOK</strong> and <strong>RUB</strong>, fell in unison as crude oil prices took a beating; with analysts noting this week’s large API &amp; EIA builds and US crude production hitting fresh record highs as possible catalysts for the sell-off (as well as the mighty buck!). <strong>AUDNZD</strong> weakened further against USD, the prospect of greater monetary policy divergence continuing to weight on the Antipodeans’ relative valuations.</p>",

Some suggest that it is a deepening of the technical correction in the 2019 rally. Citi suggests that the Russian crude situation may have been playing a role: \"Russian crude oil production was weighing on market sentiment as output was still above the OPEC+ target, but we note the 11.23mln BPD output for April was still 70k BPD lower than in March, and the 40k BPD surplus over its 11.191mln BPD quota does not strike as particularly material, particularly after recent pipeline contamination issues and the resulting cut in Urals exports to Europe.\" The bank also notes that the other potential driver of the weakness is the 12.3mln BPD record weekly production estimate, as well as this week's larger-than-expected 9.9mln barrels build in crude stocks, underscoring that the WTI market is not physically tight. \"In fact, total US commercial crude oil inventories of 470mln barrels for the week ended 26/April were the highest since September 2017,\" and \"this stockpile seems to be the fundamental anchor pulling prices down at the moment.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar has regained its post-FOMC bid and is now back to broadly firmer vs all major counterparts, with the DXY heading back up towards recent highs to retest resistance ahead of the 98.000 marker (like the 97.892 April 30 peak). To recap, the Fed shaved 5 bp off the IOER for purely technical reasons and while weaker price developments were acknowledged, Chair Powell resisted any temptation or outside influence (ie from US President Trump) to change policy guidance or raise the probability of an ease. Instead, he stressed the temporary factors depressing inflation on more than one occasion during the post-meeting press conference and Q&amp;A and asserted equal weightings to a cut or hike, with no reason to shift from the current stance (patient pause).</p><p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>The clear and marked G10 underperformer as oil prices continue to recoil and a softer Norwegian manufacturing PMI also hit the Krona more than its Sek Scandi peer that derived some support from Riksbank rhetoric downplaying sub-target Swedish inflation in wake of an even more downbeat manufacturing survey in headline terms. Indeed, Eur/Nok has extended gains beyond 9.7850 compared to Eur/Sek that remains capped around 10.7050.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/CAD/JPY</strong></p><p>All reversing earlier gains vs the Greenback, as Cable topped out again ahead of 1.3100 and gleaned little lasting support from the latest BoE super Thursday or UK construction PMI that beat consensus, but only just. In terms of the MPC, rates were held by a unanimous 9-0 vote and guidance was also maintained for gradual and limited tightening to hit the inflation goal over the forecast period. However, there was no hawkish dissent as some were contending and the QIR projections were centred on a slightly lower rate path culminating at 1% by 2021 vs 1.1% previously. Moreover, near term growth and inflation are expected to be lower than envisaged in February, with domestic demand depressed due to heightened Brexit uncertainty. Cable is now revisiting the low 1.3000 zone and retreated into 1 bn 1.3020-40 option expiry territory around the NY cut, while the Franc was undermined by a Swiss retail sales miss and sub-50 manufacturing PMI and reversed through 1.0200. The Loonie slipped through 1.3450 amidst the aforementioned steeper crude downturn and the Yen pivoted 111.50 where decent expiry interest ran off after failing to hold above the 30 DMA (111.42) as attention turns to Friday and NFP.</p><p><strong>NZD/EUR/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also ending Thursday’s EU session on the back foot vs the Usd as the Kiwi eyes support ahead of 0.6600 and the Aussie probes bids around 0.7000 ahead of tomorrow’s US jobs data and then RBNZ/RBA meetings next week when the prospects for reductions in both benchmark rates are relatively high – circa 50-50 and with break-evens via options suggesting higher volatility and up to 80 pip moves either way on the outcomes. Meanwhile, the single currency lost grip of the 1.1200 handle and tech supports in the form of 100 and 200 HMAs (1.1188 and 1.1194 respectively) having failed to build on gains/momentum from mostly encouraging Eurozone manufacturing PMIs with the glaring and worrying exception of Germany.</p>",

(Lower than Feb assumption of 1.1%). <i>Note, the MPC make reference to recent global developments as a factor behind this.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Brexit: The MPC’s projections continue to assume a smooth adjustment to the average range of possible outcomes for the UK’s eventual trading relationship with the EU. The release doesn’t provide any major update on the MPC’s view on the latest extension to the Brexit deadline.</p><p>Growth: GDP is now expected to have grown by 0.5% in Q1 2019 vs. March view of 0.3%. This increase is largely as a by-product of UK and EU companies stockpiling ahead of Brexit. This boost is expected to be temporary with Q2 growth expected to slow to 0.2%.</p><p>Inflation: Headline CPI in March of 1.9% was was inline with the Feb QIR and expectations at the Bank immediately prior to the release. Over the coming months, CPI was expected to remain fairly close to the 2% target, picking up slightly in April before easing back to just below target.</p><p>Investment: The marginally below potential growth in underlying growth is continuing to have a particularly pronounced impact on business investment. Investment is expected to pick-up at the end of the forecast period.</p><p>Labour: The labour market remains tight, with the unemployment rate expected to fall to 3.5% by the end of the forecast period.</p><p>Wages: Annual pay growth remains around 3.5% whilst unit labour costs have strengthened to rates that are above historical averages</p>",

Another poor German manufacturing survey is the obvious suspect behind the recovery, while chart impulses may also be contributing again as trend support held at 164.95. In contrast, the 10 year UK benchmark only reached 127.48 (still -13 ticks, albeit 28 ticks off the Liffe trough) following a modest construction PMI beat and now awaiting the BoE from noon, while US Treasuries are softer and the curve more mixed after the Fed reverberations as the focus shifts to weekly claims in the run up to Friday’s BLS release.</p>",

In fact, after the 5 bp IOER reduction he stressed that the move was technical rather than fundamental and repeatedly downplayed slowing price developments as transitory. Hence, the DXY has rebounded from sub-97.200 lows and just above a Fib support level (97.121), albeit with the Buck now mixed vs G10 peers.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency has drawn a bit more encouragement from the run of Eurozone manufacturing PMIs, as all bar Germany posted better than expected headlines, including Italy that rebounded relatively firmly following a return to GDP growth in Q1. Eur/Usd is back above 1.1200 as a result having probed a few pips below the 200 HMA at 1.1194, but the headline pair may be hampered by heavy option expiry interest stretching from 1.1200-10 through 1.1225-40 and up to 1.1250 (1.5 bn, 2 bn and 1.1 bn respectively). Moreover, chart resistance could cap the upside given the 30 DMA at 1.1236 and a Fib at 1.1242.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Kiwi and Aussie are marginally outperforming vs major counterparts amidst reports that a US-China trade accord may be in the offing as soon as next week and at the end of the next talks to take place in Washington, with Beijing said to be offering concessions in return for a recent olive branch from the US. Nzd/Usd is hovering between 0.6620-39 and Aud/Usd within a 0.7012-29 range as the Aud/Nzd cross sits just under 1.0600 and attention down under turns towards next week’s RBNZ and RBA policy meetings (notwithstanding NFP tomorrow of course). Both rate calls are seen tight with swap pricing not far from evens for easing, but as NAB contends that it may be to early for the RBA options are indicating higher break-evens as a result (circa 80 pips).</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>All on a more even keel vs the Greenback, with Cable straddling 1.3050 and braced for BoE super Thursday after only deriving modest support from a return to growth in the UK construction sector. However, the Pound is consolidating gains relative to the Euro over 0.8600 amidst some talk that 1 MPC voter could break ranks and switch into hike mode – full preview on the headline feed and via the Research Suite. Conversely, the Loonie is struggling to hold above 1.3450 against the backdrop of ongoing weakness in oil prices, while the Franc is back down near 1.0200 and sub-1.1400 against the Euro in wake of weak Swiss retail sales and a contractionary manufacturing PMI. The Yen has also retreated from Wednesday’s pre-FOMC peaks through 111.50 and the 30 DMA (111.42) into decent option expiries (1.2 bn between 111.50-55).</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Disappointing Scandi manufacturing PMIs vs consensus and previous readings have soured sentiment to a degree, but Eur/Nok has also been driven higher by the aforementioned crude retracement, to 9.7400+ at one stage vs Eur/Sek topping out just shy of 10.7050.</p>",

Reports noted US and China are said to have neared a deal to roll-back some tariffs which could be announced by the end of next week, while both sides have reached an understanding on how to enforce the agreement although the sources cautioned that details still need to be worked out when a Chinese delegation arrives in Washington on 8 May. Furthermore, <strong>there was said to be a general agreement on a plan for the US to immediately remove a 10% tariff on a portion of the USD 200bln worth of Chinese imports but the USD 50bln tranche of 25% tariffs may remain potentially to after 2020</strong>.

(Guardian)&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>USD</strong> firmed following the post-FOMC press conference which was less dovish than some had hoped. This weakened <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> briefly below 1.1200 although it has since recovered as a large option expiry of EUR 1.2bln at the aforementioned level attracts price action, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> retreated from near 1.3100 before finding support around its 100DMA of 1.3044. Elsewhere, antipodeans also weakened in the aftermath of the FOMC but have nursed some losses in Asia trade with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> recovering from near the 0.7000 level, while there were also comments from NAB’s CEO who dismissed calls for an RBA rate cut next week as he views it as unnecessary and suggested it would do little to stimulate the economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commodities were subdued overnight with price action dampened amid the mixed risk tone and after the FOMC. As such, <strong>WTI</strong> <strong>crude</strong> futures were kept rangebound which was in contrast to the prior day’s swings as bearish inventory data initially weighed on prices which gradually recovered amid supply concerns associated with Iran and Venezuela. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices were heavily pressured as the greenback surged post-FOMC and <strong>copper</strong> languished following its recent slip to 2½-month lows not helped by the absence of its largest buyer China.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>World Gold Council said Q1 global gold demand rose 7% Y/Y to around 1.05K tons and noted continued growth in central bank purchases.

(Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p>USTs floundered at the start of the day on thin volumes ahead of the Fed, with modest starting gains surrendered following a better than expected ADP report, with some traders noting a large block flattener of over 13k FVM9s vs over 2K ultra longs. Thereafter, however, ISM manufacturing missed at 52.8 vs. exp. 55 which added upside to the complex, with a large block buyer of 8k USM9 calls noted. The meat of the day, however, was then the Fed’s decision, which saw the curve steepening and treasuries pushing higher, with increased volumes on the front end post the unchanged rate and IOER 5bps cut to 2.35%.&nbsp; Yields broke the 10th April 2.461% low, but the move was faded after Powell stated the “surprising” inflation prints could be transitory, and the IOER cut was purely “technical”. Thereafter the curve flattened and treasuries slipped to session lows heading into the close. US T-note futures (M9) settled 3 ticks lower at 123-18+.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed as the region attempts to shrug off the negative lead from US where all major indices were pressured, and the S&amp;P 500 snapped a 3-day streak of record closes after Fed Chair Powell downplayed prospects for looser policy at the post-FOMC presser. ASX 200 (-0.6%) is negative with the index led lower by financials after AMP Capital reported net cash outflows widened in Q1 and with ‘Big 4’ bank NAB also weakened after it lowered its interim dividend by 16%. Elsewhere, both KOSPI (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (+0.3%) pared early losses and are positive on return from Labour Day holidays amid US-China trade optimism as reports suggested a trade deal involving a rollback of tariffs could be possible by the end of next week, while China also recently announced several measures to open up its financial sector to foreign companies in a concession to the US.</p><p>USD firmed following the post-FOMC press conference which was less dovish than some had hoped as Fed Chair Powell attempted to navigate a neutral line and suggested the cut to IOER was a technical adjustment that does not represent any shift in the Fed's policy stance, while Powell suggested there was no case for moving policy in either direction and focus was also centred on the view that the unexpected decline in core inflation is likely to be transitory. This weakened EUR/USD briefly below 1.1200 although it has since recovered as a large option expiry of EUR 1.2bln at the aforementioned level attracts price action, while GBP/USD retreated from near 1.3100 before finding support around its 100DMA of 1.3044. Elsewhere, antipodeans also weakened in the aftermath of the FOMC but have nursed some losses in Asia trade with AUD/USD recovering from near the 0.7000 level, while there were also comments from NAB’s CEO who dismissed calls for an RBA rate cut next week as he views it as unnecessary and would do little to stimulate the economy.</p>",
