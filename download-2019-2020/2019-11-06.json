An early dip after better than expected Germany factory orders was short-lived, and the complex continued to rally amid caution on US/China trade talks, where there are still some concerns that the deal might fall apart. A solid 10-year auction added to the rally, after the sale stopped through the screens by 1bps (recently, the auctions have tailed frequently), with cover above recent averages, and indirect bidder participation picking up – the well-received auction reveals that there is still demand for medium-dated US paper, and as such, providing validation to the analysts who have this week talked about how the complex has run out of fresh reasons for yields to continue rising; this view was encapsulated by a hefty trade in the TYZ9 131-00 strike (which analysts said looks for an implied 10-year yield of 1.6% vs the current 1.82%), where paper paid 3 ticks 100k times (50k on the screens, 50k blocked). Tomorrow’s 30-year auction will be viewed in a similar light by macro players looking to judge whether we have indeed reached a short/medium-term bottom, or whether there is demand for long-dated paper at these levels. SocGen's analysts say the 30-year sector looks fair in asset swap, observing that the current WI trades above the previous auction's stop-out rate, indicating relative cheapness versus the previous auction cycle. The last auction saw robust demand from foreigners and investment funds and was digested well considering it resulted in the lowest stop-out yield on record. With that said, SocGen says that the previous auction failed to break the streak of recent tails at 30-year auctions, tailing for the fifth time in six months. SocGen holds a neutral bias into Thursday's sale. T-note futures (Z9) settled up 13 ticks129.10+.</p>",

The official went on to say that Europe is seen as a likely venue, with Switzerland and Sweden among possible choices, but Iowa is not likely. China pushing for more tariff rollbacks is not seen as derailing the progress, the official added, who believes China sees a quick trade deal as the best chance for favourable terms given Trump's electoral and impeachment pressures. Later reports also suggested the Trump/Xi signing could take place around the time of the NATO summit in London on 3-4th December. Additionally, a trade source told Fox that the White House had requested Xi’s travel schedule to see where and when the deal could be signed.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Evans</strong> (Dovish, Voter) said the Fed has accomplished accommodative policy with its third rate cut in 2019, adding that he believed policy was now not that far off neutral, and reiterated an argument heard from many Fed officials that the US economy and monetary policy was in a good place. Looking ahead, Evans said he will be keeping an eye on inflation in deciding future policy, stating that inflation has been on the light side, and it was important to be clear on what it means by 'symmetry' to its 2% inflation target. On the Fed's repo operations, Evans said there are operational issues in setting up a repo facility, though the Fed balance sheet operations should address many of the repo issues. <strong>Fed's Williams</strong> (voter, neutral) said the labour market was really strong, noting the low unemployment rate; officials have lowered their view of what sustainable level of unemployment is based on low inflation, inflation pressures are very muted. Williams argued that monetary policy was moderately accommodative at the moment, adding that slowing global growth and muted inflation pressures argue for a more accommodative policy (it was unclear whether Williams was referring to this year's rate cuts or future policy, although comments from other Fed members have supported the former). Looking ahead, Williams said the Fed will be data dependent and pre-emptive going forward.</p><p><strong>* US PRODUCTIVITY/LABOUR COSTS:</strong> US productivity fell 0.3% Q/Q in Q3, against an expected rise of 0.9%; Labour costs rose 3.6% against an expected rise of 2.2%. The productivity decline was the first since Q4 2015, and as a result, annual productivity growth slowed to a pace of 1.4% Y/Y, the lowest rate of growth since late 2018. Unit labour costs rose, lifting the annual pace of labour cost growth to 3.1%, the quickest in more than 5 years. Oxford Economics said that, amid a tight labour market, labour cost pressures are continuing to build just as productivity is reverting to its subdued structural trend: \"Given slower domestic and foreign economic momentum and limited companies' pricing power, tighter profit margins will continue to remain a key headwind for business activity as we head into in 2020.\"</p><p>* GEOPOLITICS: Iran previously announced it has begun enriching uranium by 5% at its Fordow plant, with the region noting it has the potential to increase it to 20% if needed. Today, Iranian President Rouhani stated the Fordow site will “soon be back to full production” as it further scaled back its commitments to the 2015 nuclear accord. Russia’s Foreign minister Lavrov responded to the moves, stating Iran should commit to the 2015 nuclear pact, although it does understand why it is reducing its commitments.</p><p>* NZ Q3 JOBS DATA: Data overnight showed the jobless rate rising by more than anticipated in Q3, reversing the unexpected flat in Q2. However, UBS noted that despite the lift in unemployment, the labour market remains tight, as evidenced by falling underutilisation and rising wage pressures. Thus, based on the current state of the labour market, further monetary policy stimulus seems unwarranted. With that said, UBS argues that the near-term outlook for the labour market does not look so bright, and expects the RBNZ to downgrade its growth outlook next week, which will likely be accompanied by softer near-term labour market prospects; the bank looks for the RBNZ to cut its OCR by 25bps at the 13th November confab.</p><p>* CANADIAN IVEY PMI: for the month of October came in soft at 51.8, lower than the prior months 55.8. The seasonally adjusted reading, however, showed less of a deterioration, slipping to 48.2 in October from 48.7 in September.</p><p>* EZ BANKING UNION PROPOSALS: German Finance Minister Scholz presented proposals for completing the EU-wide banking union. The proposals show the Finance Minister is mulling a deposit insurance mechanism to protect deposits over EUR 100k - something which Germany has pushed-back on in the past. \"Germany has traditionally been reluctant to introduce a common deposit insurance system across the eurozone,\" Stratfor writes, \"however, the plan still stipulates that national insurance schemes must be the first to react in the event of a banking crisis and demands structural reforms in the Eurozone before introducing the deposit insurance.\" Stratfor also notes that the proposals also include some potentially controversial suggestions, such as ending protections for senior bondholders of failed banks, as well as harmonising tax systems across the Eurozone, which the consultancy says might complicate Berlin's efforts to impose its own version of a banking union.</p><p>* BRAZIL TOR AUCTION: The auction of oil drilling rights raised USD 17.3bln, short of the expected USD 26.5bln, which analysts said would have offered Brazil's public finances with some needed breathing room. The USDBRL rose sharply in wake of the auction, with traders suggesting that the lack of competition (for instance, state firm Petrobras took 90% of the Buzios consortium; Sepia and Atapu oil blocks received no bids, while some rights were unsold) and missing the estimate of funds raised was a negative. FX strategists have noted that by Petrobras winning much of what was offered mitigates the possibility of inflows into Brazil, which are likely to occur in December.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLED USD 0.88 LOWER AT USD 56.35/BBL; BRENT (Z9) SETTLED USD 1.22 LOWER AT USD 61.74/BBL: </strong>Crude<strong> </strong>futures sold off as risk appetite cooled from somewhat exuberant levels seen at the beginning of the week, on top of the bearish inventory report. The benchmarks were firmer in the earlier session before reversing course as major equity bourses were offered on the US cash equity open. The EIA reported crude stocks building 7.9mln bbls, larger than both expected and API figure, whilst US production remained unchanged at the record level of 12.6mln BPD; both the products printed draws, with the gasoline larger than expected, whilst the distillates figure was slightly lighter than expected. Refinery utilisation declining larger than expected and a chunky 1.7mln bbl build at Cushing didn’t provide much support either. Not long after the EIAs, it was reported that the largest OPEC+ producers are not pushing for deeper oil cuts, which followed from an earlier WSJ article that suggested Saudi would be pressing other members for cuts via further compliance with existing agreements, and that key member Russia had informed the group it wanted to just maintain the current agreement. Canadian grade crudes (WCS) remain under pressure amid the Keystone pipeline shutdown, where operator TC Energy has reportedly ordered a force majeure.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED at. </strong>After this week’s sharp rise in yields, the Treasury curve bull-flattened on Wednesday, though major spreads only narrowed modestly. An early dip after better than expected Germany factory orders was short-lived, and the complex continued to rally amid caution on US/China trade talks, where there are still some concerns that the deal might fall apart. A solid 10-year auction added to the rally, after the sale stopped through the screens by 1bps (recently, the auctions have tailed frequently), with cover above recent averages, and indirect bidder participation picking up – the well-received auction reveals that there is still demand for medium-dated US paper, and as such, providing validation to the analysts who have this week talked about how the complex has run out of fresh reasons for yields to continue rising; this view was encapsulated by a hefty trade in the TYZ9 131-00 strike (which analysts said looks for an implied 10-year yield of 1.6% vs the current 1.82%), where paper paid 3 ticks 100k times (50k on the screens, 50k blocked). Tomorrow’s 30-year auction will be viewed in a similar light by macro players looking to judge whether we have indeed reached a short/medium-term bottom, or whether there is demand for long-dated paper at these levels. SocGen's analysts say the 30-year sector looks fair in asset swap, observing that the current WI trades above the previous auction's stop-out rate, indicating relative cheapness versus the previous auction cycle. The last auction saw robust demand from foreigners and investment funds and was digested well considering it resulted in the lowest stop-out yield on record. With that said, SocGen says that the previous auction failed to break the streak of recent tails at 30-year auctions, tailing for the fifth time in six months. SocGen holds a neutral bias into Thursday's sale.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.1% at 3077, NASDAQ-100 -0.2% at 8196, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0% at 27492;</strong> SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 0.1%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.5%, Energy&nbsp; -2.3%, Financials&nbsp; 0.4%, Health Care&nbsp; 0.6%, Industrials&nbsp; 0%, Information Technology&nbsp; 0%, Materials&nbsp; -0.1%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -0.2%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.3%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Xerox (XRX) and HP Inc.

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong> The US Treasury will auction USD 84bln in a new 3-year (USD 38bln, Tuesday), a new 10-year (USD 27bln, Wednesday) and a new 30-year (USD 19bln, Thursday). According to UBS, at next week's mid-month settlement, around USD 89bln of cash flows come due (excluding SOMA holdings, but including around USD 61bln of redemptions and around USD 28bln of coupons will fall due).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>10-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> From a relative value perspective, the 10-year sector has some slight set up ahead of Wednesday's auction, analysts said, and it trades marginally cheap in asset swap as well as on the curve against 5s and 30s. SocGen also feels that it looks cheap on an outright basis, and notes that the current 10-year yield is trading above the stop-out rates for all of the last three auctions. SocGen observes that, since the last auction cycle, 2s10s curve has steepened, emphasising the relative cheapness of the sector. Additionally, SocGen points out that the current 10 is trading special in repo, which indicates stronger demand for the issue. With that said, dealer holdings in the 7-11 year bucket are relatively high, SocGen says, and with the recent run of tails, could adversely impact demand at the sale.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Tail: (Prev. -0.1bps, 6-auction avg. 0.7bps)</li><li>High Yield: (Prev. 1.59%, 6-auction avg. 1.926%)</li><li>Bid-to-Cover: (Prev. 2.43x, 6-auction avg. 2.36x)</li><li>Dealers: (Prev. 28.7%, 6-auction avg. 27.7%)&nbsp;</li><li>Directs: (Prev. 12.8%, 6-auction avg. 12.8%)</li><li>Indirects: (Prev. 58.5%, 6-auction avg. 59.4%)</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index is still hovering in a tight range just below 98.000 after running out of impetus on Tuesday and into a Fib retracement level just above the post-Fed peak and is now testing chart support around the 21 DMA (97.840 between 97.975-775 parameters). In contrast to yesterday’s bullish non-manufacturing ISM, the Greenback failed to glean any momentum from mixed US Q3 productivity and labour cost data or Fed commentary via Evans and Williams, but did lose traction against the backdrop of retreating UST yields and curve re-flattening. Ahead, 10 year supply and Fed’s Harker.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/NZD/CHF/AUD</strong></p><p>The major ‘outperformers’, but within narrow bands vs the Greenback around 109.00, just below 1.1100 and sub-0.6400 respectively. The Yen continues to feel the weight of risk-on flows due to US-China Phase 1 trade pact expectations, but managed to stem the tide ahead of recent lows and a Fib, while the single currency derived a degree of support from mostly firmer Eurozone services PMIs instead of a significant beat in German factory orders after testing chart support at 1.1064 in the form of a Fib. Note, however, Eur/Usd pulled up just shy of the 21 DMA (1.1095), and the Kiwi also stalled on the back of a mildly disappointing NZ Q3 labour report ahead of next week’s RBNZ policy meeting. Elsewhere, the Franc has regrouped alongside fellow safe-havens like the Jpy and Xau, with Usd/Chf drifting a bit further towards 0.9900 from 0.9940 and Eur/Chf back under 1.1000 compared to 1.1035 at one stage on Monday. Back down under, the Aussie is still battling to retain hold of the 0.6900 handle and sustain rallies beyond the round number round number or build on recent gains relative to its Antipodean counterpart as the Aud/Nzd cross slips back from circa 1.0830 to revisit 1.0800.</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>Sterling remains subject and hostage to breaking news and headlines related to the upcoming UK election and Brexit in the main, with Cable capped below 1.2900 and Eur/Gbp straddling 0.8600, but the Loonie handed back more gains vs it US rival after Canadian Ivey PMIs revealing a drop in the NSA gauge closer to 50.0 and deeper contractionary SA reading. Usd/Cad is nudging nearer 1.3200 in stark contrast to Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok that are both retesting technical support amidst reports of HFs taking profit on long positions or simply looking for more of a bullish cross/bearish Scandi Crown correction.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some relief for the Rand or at least a diversion from Eskom-related underperformance as the Real became the regional whipping boy in wake of Brazil’s TOR mine raffle that raised less than anticipated or the authorities were hoping for, and aroused far fewer bidders than predicted. In short, 2 of the 4 blocks received no interest at all and the largest only 2 foreign bids to contest Petrobras that already has a 90% stake, resulting in Usd17.3 bn revenue vs Usd26.5 bn projected. Usd/Brl off highs, but still firmly above 4.0000 and towards the top of a 4.0875-3.9760 band.</p>",

Moreover, the enhanced retracement has prompted fresh Liffe peaks in Gilts, at 131.49 (+17 ticks), and even permeated previously detached or indifferent Bunds that recently rebounded through parity to 170.65 (+12 ticks). Conversely, lower yields and less steepening coupled with several existing external negative impulses have kept the Buck on the backfoot with the DXY hovering between 97.975-775 parameters and testing the 21 DMA.</p>",

Earlier in the session, the DAX and Euro Stoxx indices managed to again eke out fresh YTDs highs; the former was halted by resistance at 13170 (15th June 2018 high), ahead of further resistance at the 13200 level (22 May 2018 high). US equity futures are relatively flat intra-day and are yet to fully recover from Monday’s modest losses, which saw the contracts pull back slightly from YTD highs. “The tape is overbought, buyers seem “tired”, valuations are stretched, and trade expectations are elevated (the removal of the 9/1 tariffs is quietly becoming consensus thinking)” JPM noted yesterday, and “that this is making buyers reticent to aggressively chase at present levels.” The FTSE 100 underperforms amid weakness in large cap stocks. Sectors are mostly in the red, barring Consumer Staples (+1.0%) and Financials (+0.5%), with the latter supported by the continued rise in yield, which is also supporting SocGen (+5.3%) despite the firm reporting a net decline of 34.8% YY and a 20% drop in equities trading revenue in Q3. Co. CEO noted that the bank “delivered resilient net income in an unfavourable environment without yet benefitting from the positive effects of ongoing restructuring which is ahead of its 2020 objectives.” Sticking with earnings, solid numbers from Marks &amp; Spencer (+2.1%) and Alstom (+3.8%) saw their respective shares moved higher. Conversely, weaker than forecast earnings from Wirecard (-1.1%), Dialog Semiconductors (-8.8%) and Adidas (-3.2%) sees their shares under pressure. Meanwhile, BT (-3.5%) have been hit by reports that Virgin Media dealt the company a “blow” by striking a deal to switch its 3mln mobile phone customers from the BT over to Vodaphone.

The index topped out just ahead of Fib resistance at 98.085, but also amidst broad consolidation in rival G10 currencies and especially safer-havens that have been underperforming on the positive US-China Phase 1 trade vibe alongside encouraging developments on proposed US auto tariffs. The DXY has slipped back below the big figure, but is holding well above recent lows and 97.500.</p><p>JPY/EUR/AUD/NZD - All marginally firmer vs the Greenback, as the Yen contained losses beyond 109.00 to 109.25 and did not threaten technical support around 109.37, while the Euro also defended a key chart level and Fib retracement circa 1.1064 before regrouping with the aid of some decent German data and mostly encouraging Eurozone PMIs. Elsewhere, the Aussie has crept back up to 0.6900 as the Aud/Nzd cross attempts to form a base above 1.0800 and Kiwi labours just under 0.6400 following fractionally weaker than forecast NZ jobs data overnight.</p><p>GBP/CHF/CAD - The Pound, Franc and Loonie are struggling to take advantage of the Buck’s fade, with Cable unable to reclaim 1.2900, Usd/Chf still elevated on the 0.9900 handle and Usd/Cad pivoting 1.3150 after Tuesday’s somewhat contrasting Canadian compared to US trade balances (relative to consensus), and ahead of today’s Ivey PMIs.</p><p>EM - The Rand has retraced quite sharply from sub-14.7400 vs the Dollar to 14.8000+ on renewed Eskom strife as the company suffers more severe power supply issues and concedes that output will not meet demand even though certain generation sites have resumed production after maintenance.

However, both EU benchmarks are still lagging US Treasuries that seem content to sit off recent troughs and the curve unwind a degree of the marked re-steepening amidst a moderately softer Dollar, less US-China Phase 1 euphoria and awaiting more Fed speak along with the 2nd tranche of this week’s issuance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Crude markets are modestly softer but off intraday lows</strong>, with downside seen following last night’s larger than expected headline API stocks builds, with crude inventories rising by 4.26mln BDP (vs. Exp. +1.5mln), whilst the cautious tone around the market provides little by way of sentiment-driven upside. Both the WTI Dec’ 19 and Brent Jan’ 19 contracts sit above October’s USD 56.90/bbl and USD 62.30/bbl highs – greater expectations for a US/China Phase 1 trade deal breakthrough combined with a better backdrop of macro data (i.e. US jobs data last Friday) seemingly continue to provide a base for now. In terms of crude specific news flow, the WSJ reported that the Saudis are to set to press OPEC members for production cuts ahead of its Aramco IPO, although the push would be more aimed at \"laggards\" to comply with current curbs, rather than pushing for deeper trims in output, the article caveated. Quoting sources, the WSJ added that Russia had privately told the group it wants to maintain the current targets until March whilst noting that Saudi wants to refrain from taking a bulk of the cuts – in fitting with recent separate source reports. Further, the article noted that the oil giant’s growth assumptions, as well as the dividend it promises investors, are predicated on oil prices around USD 65/bbl, according to an investor document. Looking ahead on the docket, oil traders will be eyeing the EIA crude stocks release as a scheduled catalyst with headline crude expected to print a build of 1.5mln barrels. In terms of the metals; <strong>gold </strong>is staging a tepid recovery after yesterday’s slide, which saw the precious metal slip briefly beneath the USD 1480/oz mark. <strong>Copper,</strong> meanwhile, is subdued after pulling back somewhat from yesterday’s 4-month highs around of USD 2.716/lbs.</p><p>API Crude Inventories: +4.26mln vs. Exp. +1.5mln (Prev. +0.59mln).

Earlier in the session, the DAX and Euro Stoxx indices managed to again eke out fresh YTDs highs; the former was halted by resistance at 13170 (15th June 2018 high), ahead of further resistance at the 13200 level (22 May 2018 high). US equity futures are relatively flat intra-day and are yet to fully recover from Monday’s modest losses, which saw the contracts pull back slightly from YTD highs. “The tape is overbought, buyers seem “tired”, valuations are stretched, and trade expectations are elevated (the removal of the 9/1 tariffs is quietly becoming consensus thinking)” JPM noted yesterday, and “that this is making buyers reticent to aggressively chase at present levels.” The FTSE 100 underperforms amid weakness in large cap stocks. Sectors are mostly in the red, barring Consumer Staples (+1.0%) and Financials (+0.5%), with the latter supported by the continued rise in yield, which is also supporting SocGen (+5.3%) despite the firm reporting a net decline of 34.8% YY and a 20% drop in equities trading revenue in Q3. Co. CEO noted that the bank “delivered resilient net income in an unfavourable environment without yet benefitting from the positive effects of ongoing restructuring which is ahead of its 2020 objectives.” Sticking with earnings, solid numbers from Marks &amp; Spencer (+2.1%) and Alstom (+3.8%) saw their respective shares moved higher. Conversely, weaker than forecast earnings from Wirecard (-1.1%), Dialog Semiconductors (-8.8%) and Adidas (-3.2%) sees their shares under pressure. Meanwhile, BT (-3.5%) have been hit by reports that Virgin Media dealt the company a “blow” by striking a deal to switch its 3mln mobile phone customers from the BT over to Vodaphone. Finally, Fincantieri (-1.6%) shares initially slumped amid reports that the Italian finance police are undertaking searches 19 shipbuilding companies working with the Co.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Dollar has lost some of its post-US services ISM vigour after the DXY managed to scale 98.000 and match the knee-jerk high notched in wake of last week’s FOMC policy meeting precisely. The index topped out just ahead of Fib resistance at 98.085, but also amidst broad consolidation in rival G10 currencies and especially safer-havens that have been underperforming on the positive US-China Phase 1 trade vibe alongside encouraging developments on proposed US auto tariffs. The DXY has slipped back below the big figure, but is holding well above recent lows and 97.500.</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/AUD/NZD</strong> - All marginally firmer vs the Greenback, as the Yen contained losses beyond 109.00 to 109.25 and did not threaten technical support around 109.37, while the Euro also defended a key chart level and Fib retracement circa 1.1064 before regrouping with the aid of some decent German data and mostly encouraging Eurozone PMIs. Elsewhere, the Aussie has crept back up to 0.6900 as the Aud/Nzd cross attempts to form a base above 1.0800 and Kiwi labours just under 0.6400 following fractionally weaker than forecast NZ jobs data overnight.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF/CAD</strong> - The Pound, Franc and Loonie are struggling to take advantage of the Buck’s fade, with Cable unable to reclaim 1.2900, Usd/Chf still elevated on the 0.9900 handle and Usd/Cad pivoting 1.3150 after Tuesday’s somewhat contrasting Canadian compared to US trade balances (relative to consensus), and ahead of today’s Ivey PMIs.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - The Rand has retraced quite sharply from sub-14.7400 vs the Dollar to 14.8000+ on renewed Eskom strife as the company suffers more severe power supply issues and concedes that output will not meet demand even though certain generation sites have resumed production after maintenance. Investors also waiting on tenterhooks to hear from SA President Ramaphosa at a conference aimed at drumming up foreign funds.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Only marginal deviation outside prior ranges, as <strong>Gilts</strong> managed to trade flat at 131.32 (vs -27 ticks at worst) and <strong>Bunds</strong> slipped to a marginal new Eurex low at 170.22 (-31 ticks vs +3 ticks at one stage) before the former lost momentum and the latter found some underlying buying interest. However, both EU benchmarks are still lagging <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> that seem content to sit off recent troughs and the curve unwind a degree of the marked re-steepening amidst a moderately softer Dollar, less US-China Phase 1 euphoria and awaiting more Fed speak along with the 2nd tranche of this week’s issuance.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Crude markets modestly softer but off intraday lows, with downside seen following last night’s larger than expected headline API stocks builds, with crude inventories rising by 4.26mln BDP (vs. Exp. +1.5mln), whilst the cautious tone around the market provides little by way of sentiment-driven upside. Both the <strong>WTI</strong> Dec’ 19 and <strong>Brent</strong> Jan’ 19 contracts sit above October’s USD 56.90/bbl and USD 62.30/bbl highs – greater expectations for a US/China Phase 1 trade deal breakthrough combined with a better backdrop of macro data (i.e. US jobs data last Friday) seemingly continue to provide a base for now. In terms of crude specific news flow, the WSJ reported that the Saudis are to set to press OPEC members for production cuts ahead of its Aramco IPO, although the push would be more aimed at \"laggards\" to comply with current curbs, rather than pushing for deeper trims in output, the article caveated. Quoting sources, the WSJ added that Russia had privately told the group it wants to maintain the current targets until March whilst noting that Saudi wants to refrain from taking a bulk of the cuts – in fitting with recent separate source reports. Further, the article noted that the oil giant’s growth assumptions, as well as the dividend it promises investors, are predicated on oil prices around USD 65/bbl, according to an investor document. Looking ahead on the docket, oil traders will be eyeing the EIA crude stocks release as a scheduled catalyst with headline crude expected to print a build of 1.5mln barrels. In terms of the metals; <strong>gold</strong> is staging a tepid recovery after yesterday’s slide, which saw the precious metal slip briefly beneath the USD 1480/oz mark. <strong>Copper</strong>, meanwhile, is subdued after pulling back somewhat from yesterday’s 4-month highs around of USD 2.716/lbs.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are lacklustre following a flat finish on Wall St where the major indices remained near record highs on the US-China trade optimism, but which some caution seeping through as China is seen to be unwilling to flinch on tariffs and with the removal of levies a sticking point for the 'phase one' deal. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) are relatively indecisive with gold miners underperforming in Australia after the precious metal slipped below the psychological key USD 1500/oz level although downside in the broader market is stemmed by resilience in the energy and financials sectors, while trade in Tokyo is stable amid a mixed currency and as the local benchmark takes a breather from the prior day’s surge to a fresh yearly high. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) are also tentative after the PBoC refrained from open market operations and as participants await the next developments in the trade saga such as if the US succumbs to China’s demands to roll-back tariffs.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY slightly eased back from the 98.00 level although holds on to a majority of the spoils from this week’s rally helped by the improving trade climate, stronger than expected ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI data and a subdued performance in its major counterparts in which EUR/USD and GBP/USD slipped below the 1.1100 and 1.2900 handles respectively. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are mixed amid the non-committal risk tone and after an outdated BoJ minutes release failed to spur prices. Elsewhere, AUD/USD and NZD/USD are subdued by the recent broad strength in the greenback and after weaker than expected New Zealand jobs data, while antipodeans also failed to benefit from the recent strength in CNY which breached to below the 7.0000 level against USD amid the improving trade environment and following a firmer than expected reference rate setting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower after similar declines in USTs and with the benchmark 10yr JGB yield at its highest in around 5 months, while a looming 10yr JGB auction has also kept participants sidelined.&nbsp;</p>",
