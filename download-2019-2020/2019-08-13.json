(Twitter)</p><p>China Global Times cited experts in which it noted that delaying 10% tariff on China's electronic products shows Beijing’s retaliation measures, with yuan’s depreciation, have been taking a bigger-than-expected toll on US economy amid the trade war and that it is pushing the US to show a goodwill gesture to create environment for trade talks. (Twitter)</p><p>China's Vice Premier Liu reportedly spoke with USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.

There are some questions about the motivations of the move; while it can be spun as a de-escalation of trade wars, Trump justified the move in case it had an impact on shopping during the Christmas season, suggesting it was more about domestic politics rather than a move to appease China. Nonetheless, the announcement saw risk assets bounce (stocks moved into positive territory, Treasuries went negative), while EMFX gained against the USD, and the bid in havens deflated. All sectors closed green, with defensive utilities underperforming. Tech shares outperformed after the delayed tariffs were announced for many tech items, and as it is a key sector which holds exposure to China given the semiconductor presence. The Computer and Electronics Retail sub index outperformed. As the haven bid deflated, gold gave back some gains, which weighed on the Gold sub index. Homebuilders were higher following initiations from SunTrust, with new buys for DR Horton (DHI) &amp; Pulte (PHM), and new holds for Lennar (LEN) &amp; Toll Brothers (TOL). Elsewhere, General Electric (GE) firmed after its CEO purchased USD 3mln of shares. Micron Technologies (MU) and other semiconductor names benefited as US President Trump delayed some tariffs on items, such as mobile phones, laptops &amp; computers -- products which use chips. Apple (AAPL) traded higher on positive trade developments too, however, it’s Airpods, Homepod and Apple Watch do remain on the list of September 1st tariffs. S&amp;P 500 +1.5%, NASDAQ 100 +2.2%, DJIA +1.4%.</p><p>The Treasury curve bear-flattened in Tuesday trade. There was much attention on the 2s10s part of the Treasury curve, which came to within 1 bps of inversion, before US/China news allowed a bounce. However, at settlement, the gap is around 2bps, keeping the threat of inversion alive. The 3m/10-year part of the curve was also in focus, but is already inverted, of course; the gap here went as deep as -40bps in overnight trade, but has pared back to around -33bps amid more constructive risk sentiment. The long-end of the curve continues to gain attention, with yields down to fresh 37-month lows. This has also been a focus of equity traders; with regards to the 10s sector, Goldman Sachs noted that the S&amp;P 500 currently offers a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 2.0% – higher than the 10-year US Treasury yield for the first time since October 2016. At settlement, major US curve spreads had tightened, with 2s30 narrowing by around 6bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 17+ lower at 129-26+.</p>",

There are some questions about the motivations of the move; while it can be spun as a de-escalation of trade wars, Trump justified the move in case it had an impact on shopping during the Christmas season, suggesting it was more about domestic politics rather than a move to appease China. Nonetheless, the announcement saw risk assets bounce (stocks moved into positive territory, Treasuries went negative), while EMFX gained against the USD, and the bid in havens deflated. The moves were challenged after tensions in Hong Kong heated up, and riot police removed protestors</p><p><strong>* CHINA TARIFFS:</strong> The US will delay until 15th December the 10% tariff on USD 300bln of Chinese imports (the fourth tranche of tariffs) on some items (cell phones, laptop computers, video game consoles, certain toys, computer monitors, and certain items of footwear and clothing; some tariffs will take effect on 1st September, as planned), Bloomberg reported. The implication is that the monetary size of the tariff list has been significantly cut - the cellphones component alone accounted for USD 45bln of the tariffs (using 2017 data as a proxy). On the face of it, the news could also be seen as a de-escalation of trade wars that helps engineer positive talks between the US and China; however, Bloomberg's reported noted that the US concession appears designed to avoid any disruption or price increases for US consumers heading into the holiday season, according to the report. The announcement also came as the two sides spoke for the first time since the recent escalation in tensions, and another conference call is planned again in two weeks. China's Global Times, a state mouth piece, responded that the delay to the tariffs shows \"Beijing’s retaliation measures, with yuan’s depreciation, have been taking a bigger-than-expected toll on US economy amid trade war, pushing US to show goodwill gesture to create environment for trade talks.\"</p><p><strong>* HONG KONG:</strong> Protestors returned to Hong Kong International Airport, which resulted in further flight cancellations; riot police responded to the situation, and clashed with protestors. China authorities once again suggested that protestors were \"showing tendencies of resorting to terrorism\" which some analysts take as a pre-justification to use a heavier hand with protestors (it was reported on Monday that armed police were assembling in Shenzen, which borders Hong Kong, which is seen as a threat of possible action if the situation deteriorates). Analysts are now keeping an eye out for signs that authorities will take a firmer hand (<a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/analysis-how-might-beijing-intervene-to-stabilise-hong-kong-factors-to-watch-13-08-2019\">see our analysis here</a>).</p><p><strong>* US CPI:</strong> Headline CPI rose +0.3% M/M, in line with expectations, though the Y/Y rate firmed by more than expected, to 1.8% from 1.6% (consensus 1.7%). The core metrics rose by 0.3% M/M, a quicker pace than the 0.2% expected, but matching the prior; the Y/Y rate also rose by more than expected, to 2.2% against an expected unchanged 2.1%). Real weekly earnings fell by 0.3% M/M in July, against the previous +0.2%. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that the overshoot was due to gains in used car prices, medical services and airline fares, as well as tobacco and apparel. Rents were subdued, but Pantheon sees no reason to expect a fundamental slowing, given the very low vacancy rate and rising wages. \"After four straight core CPI increases of less than 0.15% per month, two straight 0.29% gains are more likely to be just a rebound rather than the start of a sustained trend, the consultancy says, \"that's almost certainly the case with used auto prices, which plunged in the first few months of the year but are now rebounding.\" However, the increases in other components may persist, due to rising labour costs and tariffs: \"The upturn in medical services inflation, where the Y/Y rate has risen to 3.3% in July from just 1.9% last October, looks like a response to the tight labour market,\" and \"the 3-month annualized rate is a startling 5.7%, so the Y/Y rate likely has further to climb,\" Pantheon writes. \"But the surge in furniture and bedding inflation, to 3.9% in July, and the 6.0% Y/Y rise in prices for floor coverings, are tariff effects, and offer a taste of what would happen if the administration imposes tariffs on a wide range of imported Chinese consumer goods next month.\" Pantheon argues that, even without further tariffs, core CPI inflation may rise to 2.5% Y/Y by the end of 2019, with unfavourable base effects then likely to push it close to 3% by next spring. \"The three-month annualized rate now is at 2.8%, and is likely to breach 3% in August, for the first time in eight years,\" Pantheon says, \"under normal circumstances, this would have the Fed tightening, but the trade war has changed everything, and another easing in September -- 25bp rather than 50bp -- remains our base case. The endless easing expected by markets, however, will come only if the economy rolls over, if inflation rises as we expect.\"</p><p><strong>* GERMANY ZEW:</strong> The ZEW expectations index dropped to -44.0, down sharply from the prior -24.5 in July, and much weaker than the consensus -28.0. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that this was a dreadful headline, similar to the depths reached during the financial crisis in 2008 and in late 2011, when the US debt ceiling crisis roiled markets: \"On this occasion, however, it seems as if investors are anticipating chaos — a US-Sino currency war, Brexit etc—or at least ascribing a very high probability to an accident,\" Pantheon says, \"in other words, there is little current justification in the equity market, which is usually the best short-term gauge for the ZEW, for this crash.\" Pantheon says that the details show that investors’ interest rate expectations slid further in Q3, consistent with market-based gauges pointing to further rate cuts by the Fed, and a reduction in the deposit rate in the Eurozone too. \"Expectations also dipped for equities, though they remain broadly balanced, expect for markets in the UK and Italy where investors are clearly factoring-in political risks.\"</p><p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> PM Conte will appear before lawmakers on 20th August, as they debate the confidence motion against the government. Lawmakers were expected to today set a date; a motion to vote on Wednesday by League Leader Salvini was voted down – Salvini has been seeking a quick confidence vote that would lead to quick elections and allow his League Party to make gains at the polls and influence the 2020 Budget. That decision is to be left to the Italian President Mattarella, who has been angling for the Budget to be passed before an election. Salvini today proposed accepting 5SM's demand to reduce the number of politicians quickly in return for quick elections, a measure seen as an olive branch to progress proceedings; analysts had noted that the proposal to cut MPs from 945 to 600 has been approved by parliament on three occasions, with the fourth vote due in September. HSBC says that completing this reform would mean elections could not take place for another 5-6 months at least, due to the need to allow a possible referendum to be called, and to re-draw the electoral council boundaries. The key implication of today’s events is that there is still no clarity on when a confidence measure will take place, when elections will take place; there is also no clarity on the sequencing of events.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> A ComRes poll shows that 54% of those polled back the statement that \"Boris Johnson needs to deliver Brexit by any means, including suspending parliament if necessary, in order to prevent MPs (Members of Parliament) from stopping it.\" Newspapers are also heavily carrying news from Monday, where US National Security Advisor Bolton said the US would 'enthusiastically' support the UK in the event of a no deal Brexit, and that the US could be willing to make sector-by-sector deals following Brexit.</p><p><strong>* UK JOBS REPORT:</strong> While the jobless rate moved 0.1ppts higher to 3.9% in the three-months to June, against a consensus view for unchanged. However, the wages data was more encouraging, coming in line with expectations at 3.7% for the rise in weekly wages, and 3.4% for the measure that includes bonuses. The data is good enough to undermine the case for BOE rate cuts, Pantheon Macroeconomics argues: employment was 115K (+0.4%) higher in the three months to June than in the previous three months, above the 89K average increase seen since the Brexit vote in 2016, and the proportion of employees in temporary roles remains at the lowest since records began in 1992, while slack is not increasing meaningfully. Pantheon concedes that the labour market tends to lag developments in the wider economy, but notes that firms have lived with high levels of economic uncertainty for the best part of a year, and still want to fill new positions; vacancies were 20K, or 2.3%, lower in the three months to July than in the three months to April, Pantheon says, but remained high both by historical standards and in relation to unemployment. Meanwhile, the employment components of business surveys generally have recovered since Q1 and are consistent with solid year-over-year growth in employee numbers of about 1% in the second half of this year. \"As a result, wage growth should continue to exceed productivity gains by a large margin,\" Pantheon writes, \"the pick-up in the headline rate of wage growth excluding bonuses to an 11-year high of 3.9% in June, from 3.6% in May, entirely reflects near-term momentum\"; the analysts also note that the annualised rate of three-month-on-three-month growth in wages -- cited by the MPC to support past increases in Bank Rate -- leapt to 4.8% in June, from 3.9% in May. \"So in the event that Brexit is delayed further—still our base case—or an agreement is reached in October and the economy starts to rebuild a little momentum, the MPC will need to move in short order to raise Bank Rate again.\"</p><p><strong>* WTI (U9) SETTLES USD 2.17 HIGHER AT USD 57.10/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLES USD 2.73 HIGHER AT USD 61.30/BBL: </strong>The crude complex has rallied on Tuesday on positive US-China trade developments, which are seen as supportive for the demand-side of the oil equation, where much focus has been placed of late. “Demand fears that were a big factor in recent price weakness have eased,” Citi said, and the bank also notes that “the Brent market has joined the party, now catching up with some of the recent stronger gains in WTI. After market, participants will be looking ahead to the US energy inventories, with the API reporting after the bell on Tuesday. The latest week’s inventory expectations see crude stocks -2.8mln bbls, gasoline unchanged, and distillates +1mln bbls; Genscape forecasts Cushing at -2.5mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong> Gibraltar denied earlier reports that the oil tanker Grace 1 will be leaving British Overseas Territory on Tuesday. It was previously reported that the Iranian tanker seized by the UK, Grace 1, will be freed by Tuesday Evening, FARS reported, citing Gibraltarian authorities; the detainment extension is set to expire on August 15th. The Grace 1 was seized on July 4th on allegations that the Iranian tanker was shipping oil to Syria, which would be a violation of existing EU sanctions, although Iran has denied the claims and has since seized a British tanker (Stena Impero) in the Strait of Hormuz, accusing it of marine violations.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLE 17+ LOWER AT 129-26+. </strong>The Treasury curve bear-flattened in Tuesday trade. There was much attention on the 2s10s part of the Treasury curve, which came to within 1 bps of inversion, before US/China news allowed a bounce. However, at settlement, the gap is around 2bps, keeping the threat of inversion alive. The 3m/10-year part of the curve was also in focus, but is already inverted, of course; the gap here went as deep as -40bps in overnight trade, but has pared back to around -33bps amid more constructive risk sentiment. The long-end of the curve continues to gain attention, with yields down to fresh 37-month lows. This has also been a focus of equity traders; with regards to the 10s sector, Goldman Sachs noted that the S&amp;P 500 currently offers a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 2.0% – higher than the 10-year US Treasury yield for the first time since October 2016. At settlement, major US curve spreads had tightened, with 2s30 narrowing by around 6bps.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> The USD strengthened in wake of firm CPI data, and combined with positive developments on the US/China trade front, yields rose across the curve, helping USDJPY pare back earlier, haven flow-induced losses. Gold is negative, though is holding above the USD 1500 mark, while the Swissy is negative. The positive trade news gave risk assets a bounce, and USDCNH managed to print a low sub-7.00, helping USD/EM to fall. The EUR was still in positive territory after a grim ZEW report, but went negative amid USD strength post CPI. GBP trades slightly negative, despite a wave of headlines suggesting the US and UK could strike a trade deal as soon as the UK exits Europe; that said, the 1.2015 low from Monday was untested. AUD has been well supported at 0.6750, but moved closer to 0.68 in wake of the trade news; the currency largely ignore NAB survey and RBA Kent comments overnight. USDCAD breached 1.32 to the downside; analysts note that the currency is a good proxy for risk sentiment, however, it could not hold sub 1.32.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> General Electric (GE) firmed after its CEO purchased USD 3mln of shares. Micron Technologies (MU) and other semiconductor names benefited as US President Trump delayed some tariffs on items, such as mobile phones, laptops &amp; computers -- products which use chips. Apple (AAPL) traded higher on positive trade developments too, however, it’s Airpods, Homepod and Apple Watch do remain on the list of September 1st tariffs.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SECTORS:</strong> All sectors closed green, with defensive utilities underperforming. Tech shares outperformed after the delayed tariffs were announced for many tech items, and as it is a key sector which holds exposure to China given the semiconductor presence. The Computer and Electronics Retail sub index outperformed. As the haven bid deflated, gold gave back some gains, which weighed on the Gold sub index. Homebuilders were higher following initiations from SunTrust, with new buys for DR Horton (DHI) &amp; Pulte (PHM), and new holds for Lennar (LEN) &amp; Toll Brothers (TOL).</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A:</strong> CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) finally reached an agreement to merge where the new company will be called ViacomCBS, with Bob Bakish (Viacom’s CEO) to lead the company. Joe laniello, who was CEO last year, will be the chairman of CBS and in charge of CBS assets following the merger. Shari Redstone, who controls CBS and Viacom with her father through their family holding company, National Amusements, has advocated for the deal to gather larger financial holdings to help compete against media and tech heavyweights Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) for entertainment and sports rights, most notably, the NFL. CBS owns rights to the NFL until 2022 and “will do what is necessary” to renew them. Shari Redstone is to lead the board of directors.</p>",

There was much attention on the 2s10s part of the Treasury curve, which came to within a bps of inversion, before US/China news allowed a bounce. However, at settlement, the gap is around 2bps, keeping the threat of inversion alive. the 3m/10-year part of the curve was also in focus, but is already inverted, of course; the gap here went as deep as -40bps in overnight trade, but has pared back to around -33bps amid more constructive risk sentiment. The long-end of the curve continues to gain attention, with yields down to fresh 37-month lows. This has also been a focus of equity traders; with regards to the 10s sector, Goldman Sachs noted that the S&amp;P 500 currently offers a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 2.0% – higher than the 10-year US Treasury yield for the first time since October 2016. At settlement, major US curve spreads had tightened, with 2s30 narrowing by around 6bps. &nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index and Greenback in general gleaned some traction from firmer than forecast US inflation data, but the rebound gathered pace and was exacerbated by latest developments on the US-China trade front. In short, Chinese President VP Liu is said to have spoken to USTR Lighthizer and US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and the top officials will hold follow-up talks in a fortnight (presumably to see if face-to-face meetings will take place in September), while in the interim Washington has decided to waiver some additional 10% tariffs and defer others until mid-December. The upshot, a broad upturn in flagging sentiment to the detriment of safe-havens, with the DXYup to 97.788 vs 97.315 in the run up to the CPI release.</p><p><strong>AUD/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The meltdown in Gold (back below Usd1500/oz) and reversal in Usd/Cnh (from 7.1060+ to sub-7.0000) highlight the extent of the turnaround in risk appetite from earlier (selective) aversion, but in major markets the marked change in mood is clear in Aud/Usd’s extended rebound through 0.6800 and Usd/Jpy’s even bigger resurgence from near 105.00 lows to almost 107.00.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Also beneficiaries of the vastly improved tone (or sheer relief), as Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek recoiled from 10.0160+ and 10.7300+ to circa 9.9245 and 10.6575 respectively, and the Norwegian Krona derived added impetus from a decent pre-API recovery in oil prices, like the Loonie (Usd/<strong>CAD </strong>back under 1.3200 vs just shy of 1.3300 at one stage). Note, if relations between Washington and Beijing continue to thaw this may underpin Norges Bank and Riksbank intentions to press ahead with further policy normalisation as well.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/GBP</strong></p><p>The single currency got caught up in the unwind of safe-haven positioning having shown resilience in the face of a downbeat ZEW survey, and Eur/Usd topped out just above recent peaks to trade back below 1.1200 and close to August lows. Similarly, less demand for the Franc saw Usd/Chf rebound from around 0.9660 to 0.9765 or so and even Eur/Chf reclaim the 1.0900 handle from sub-1.0850, which should appease the SNB to a degree. Meanwhile, Sterling remained relatively sluggish on no deal Brexit risk and UK political jitters with Cable hardly building on mild post-UK pay inspired gains and fading into 1.2100.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Yuan aside, the breaking US-China headlines helped the likes of the Rand, Rouble, Real and both Pesos (Mexican and Argentine) regain some composure against the Buck, but the Lira continued to lag/underperform on technical factors as Usd/Try breached or probed through 200 and 21 DMAs. However, the proof of the pudding in terms of overall risk morale may well lie with the next PBoC&nbsp;</p><p><strong>USD/CNY</strong></p><p>&nbsp;mid-point fix after a gradual incline in official settings to 7.0421 overnight.</p>",

The core metrics rose by 0.3% M/M, a quicker pace than the 0.2% expected, but matching the prior; the Y/Y rate also rose by more than expected, to 2.2% against an expected unchanged 2.1%). Real weekly earnings fell by 0.3% M/M in July, against the previous +0.2%.</li><li>Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that the overshoot was due to gains in used car prices, medical services and airline fares, as well as tobacco and apparel. Rents were subdued, but Pantheon sees no reason to expect a fundamental slowing, given the very low vacancy rate and rising wages.</li><li>\"After four straight core CPI increases of less than 0.15% per month, two straight 0.29% gains are more likely to be just a rebound rather than the start of a sustained trend, the consultancy says, \"that's almost certainly the case with used auto prices, which plunged in the first few months of the year but are now rebounding.\"</li><li>However, the increases in other components may persist, due to rising labour costs and tariffs: \"The upturn in medical services inflation, where the Y/Y rate has risen to 3.3% in July from just 1.9% last October, looks like a response to the tight labor market,\" and \"the 3-month annualized rate is a startling 5.7%, so the Y/Y rate likely has further to climb,\" Pantheon writes. \"But the surge in furniture and bedding inflation, to 3.9% in July, and the 6.0% Y/Y rise in prices for floor coverings, are tariff effects, and offer a taste of what would happen if the administration imposes tariffs on a wide range of imported Chinese consumer goods next month.\"</li><li>Pantheon argues that, even without further tariffs, core CPI inflation may rise to 2.5% Y/Y by the end of 2019, with unfavorable base effects then likely to push it close to 3% by next spring. \"The three-month annualized rate now is at 2.8%, and is likely to breach 3% in August, for the first time in eight years,\" Pantheon says, \"under normal circumstances, this would have the Fed tightening, but the trade war has changed everything, and another easing in September -- 25bp rather than 50bp -- remains our base case. The endless easing expected by markets, however, will come only if the economy rolls over, if inflation rises as we expect.\"</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*FALLOUT</strong> – Italian Senate leaders yesterday failed to reach a consensus on the timing of a no-confidence vote against the Conte-led government, and thus will reconvene today at 1700 BST to continue its debate. ANSA reported that the PM will likely be invited to address senate on August 20th, with desks speculating that this will be when his fate will be decided.</p><p><strong>*PM SALVINI?</strong> – Once debated, the no-confidence vote is expected to pass. Forza Italia and Brothers of Italy leaders have both previously pledged support to Salvini. PD (centre-left) are also likely to back the no-confidence vote, as polling suggests it could leave them as primary opposition rather than Di-Maio’s 5SM. Latest polls register Salvini’s League between 36-38%, with a snap election upping the prospect of an outright majority in both branches of parliament. However, analysts note that an alliance with the Brothers of Italy (far-right) might provide some comfort, add to that the Forza Italia (centre-right), Salvini may reach the 2/3 majority required to amend Italy’s constitution.</p><p><strong>*TECHNOCRATIC GOVERNMENT?</strong> - Mattarella has previously spoken about the importance of pushing through the 2020 Budget (due Oct 20th) , and as such, Goldman believes risks are tilted in this direction, “however, it is not clear at this stage whether there will be a majority in Parliament to support a caretaker/institutional government.\" Goldman says that a caretaker government would be near-term bullish news for financial markets, while a general election in Q4 (given Lega's strength in recent opinion polls) would be near-term bearish, as investors would be likely to price-in a higher risk of a further weakening of the public finance outlook, of rating agency downgrades and of a more confrontational dialogue with European partners regarding both fiscal rules and immigration. Reports also speculated that the President could seek a “guarantee government”, i.e. a coalition that can ensure the functioning of government. Salvini has dismissed this notion as undemocratic, and favours elections</p><p><strong>*WHAT TO EXPECT</strong> - It is likely that Conte’s government no longer has majority. The real question, Goldman Sachs says, is whether President Mattarella will opt for a caretaker government (to vote through the 2020 Budget in Q4), or whether Italians will go to the polls at the back-end October or November (which would leave the current government in power to manage affairs until the election). Deputy PM Salvini reportedly favours 13th October as a date for an election, although others noted that President Mattarella is mulling 23rd October, subject to the timing of the confidence vote. It’s also worth keeping in mind that late October will be risk-packed, with Italy’s 2020 budget (Oct 20th), Brexit day (Oct 31st), the appointment of newly elected EU leaders/ECB President (Nov 1st) all on the docket alongside potential Italian elections.</p>",

UBS thinks that his priority now is delivering macroeconomic stability ahead of elections. But the main question, UBS says, is whether authorities have enough fire power to defend the peso, especially if there is a run on deposits. The bank notes that Argentines have increased dollarisation in recent months, so much of the exodus out of the peso is already likely to have been seen. UBS notes that authorities can intervene intra FX band up to unspecified amounts (over and above the USD 60mln being sold daily by the central bank on behalf of the Treasury) and they can sell up to USD 250mln daily in the event that the peso breaches the top of the band (51.50 to the dollar). The bank also notes that in addition to spot sales, the IMF recently allowed Argentina to increase its sale of non-deliverable forwards to USD 3.6bln through the end of September. \"FX intervention would be non-sterilized, tightening the monetary supply and raising interest rates in the process,\" UBS writes, \"the Central Bank is currently sitting on USD 29bln in net reserves (equivalent to 205% of sight deposits and 60% of M2), but it is unclear how much the IMF and the authorities would be prepared to burn to stabilize the currency and validate the capital flight.\" Argentine authorities will also have to contend with high rollover risk of short-term Treasury debt. \"By the IMF's estimates, for the 2019 financing program to balance, the rollover rate had be a high 80% in the remainder of the year. This threshold now looks extremely challenging.\"&nbsp;</p>",

In terms of individual movers, Henkel (-7.0%) rest at the foot of the Stoxx 600 amid a profit warning whilst it also noted that it does not envisage a H2 auto market recovery.

The upward momentum in Treasuries and EGBs, specifically in the belly- to front-end, was spurred by the further weakening of the Chinese yuan in the earlier European session, and then was extended through till settlement as fears grew of further escalation in Hong Kong as Chinese military forces close in on the nation. By settlement the curve had considerably bull flattened, with the 10-year yield down by 9bps, and the 2-year yield down by about 4bps; the entire curve had flattened by 6bps whilst newswires highlighted that the 2s10s was at its narrowest since 2010.

Chinese markets are also lower after Chinese Loans and Aggregate Financing data missed estimates with heavy losses in Hong Kong after its airport was shutdown by a mass sit-in and although flights have since resumed, hundreds remain cancelled as they try to deal with the back log from the disruption. Furthermore, increased concerns China may intervene after the People's Armed Police were reportedly gathering and heading towards the bordering city of Shenzhen, has added to the pressure for the Hang Seng (-1.5%) which declined to its weakest since early January, while losses in the Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) have been stemmed after the PBoC set a firmer than expected reference rate and continued its liquidity injections. Singapore’s STI (-0.9%) was also weakened by a double-whammy after GDP data for Q2 missed estimates and the MAS dashed easing hopes in which it stated it is not considering an off-cycle policy meeting.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is off the prior day’s lows but remains uneventful with price action stuck just below the 97.50 level following the recent decline in yields. The greenback’s major counterparts are mixed with EUR/USD testing 1.1200 to the downside, while GBP/USD is subdued after a failed attempt to reclaim the 1.2100 handle and with UK PM Johnson looking to play chicken with Brussels as reports noted he believes the EU will cave in at the last minute to save Ireland from a no-deal Brexit. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses have recouped some of their recent losses but have far to go to fully recover from this month’s slip, while antipodeans marginally benefit after a firmer than expected PBoC reference rate and slight improvement in Australian Business Confidence data, as well as comments from RBA Assistant Governor Kent that it is unlikely negative rates will be needed in Australia although some unconventional policies are possible.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid the risk averse tone and following the bull flattening in the US, although upside is capped amid a lack of BoJ presence in the market and given that prices are already at record levels.</p>",
