Furthermore, the BBC Political Editor later noted that UK PM May's office has indicated the Brexit extension letter will be sent to the EU tomorrow. (Newswires)</p><p>UK PM May spokesperson said PM May does not think a general election is in the nation's interest and that if there is an extension to A50, it should be as short as possible. Furthermore, a UK PM May spokesperson had also earlier commented that PM May is not prepared to revoke article 50 and confirmed there will be no new vote on Brexit plan in Parliament this week. (Newswires)</p><p>ITV’s Peston stated that UK PM May is to write to EU leaders without nailing down precisely what length of a delay she will seek, while it was also reported that Tory MP's have warned that if UK PM May succeeds in seeking a long Brexit delay, immediate price will be her forced resignation. (ITV)</p><p>HoC Speaker Bercow said MP's will have to agree to any Article 50 extension by the government, while he added that If MP's think an extension is too short/long, they could reject it and get PM May to try again according to Telegraph's Maidment.

(Twitter)</p><p>EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier commented that voting against a no-deal does not prevent it from happening. Barnier also stated that if PM May requests a Brexit delay before the EU summit on Thursday, leaders will assess reasons and usefulness of extension, while he added the key question will be whether extension of A50 increases the chances for ratification of the Brexit deal.

Talk the ECB might have to broaden its asset purchases to include stocks lent some of a bid to the fixed complex. Also in the pre-market, there was a large 17k blocked seller of the June TY contract, reportedly real money, which piled pressure into the complex, helping rate differentials widen, and lifting USDJPY towards its 200-dma at 111.44. There were also reports of chunky put buying in the 10-year space, adding to the downside. After the equity complex stalled in afternoon trade, a slight bid returned in Treasuries, given a bit of a boost on newswire headlines questioning the progress of US/China trade, though subsequent reports painted a more optimistic picture.

Consequentially, USTR Lighthizer is said to be seeking details on China's revised IP offer. However, this cautiousness was in contrast to reports, minutes later, that stated the two countries’ talks are in the final stages, with China Vice Premier Liu set to visit Washington soon, while USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin plan to travel to China next week for further trade talks; no details were provided on a Trump/Xi meeting, which has now been guided to June having first been delayed from late-March/April. In a press conference with the Brazilian President, US President Trump was asked about the progress of China talks, to which he replied they were proceeding “very well.”</p><p><strong>* FOMC PREVIEW: </strong>The FOMC is expected to hold rates at 2.25-2.50% at its meeting on 19-20 March. Three key themes: 1) The statement may see dovish tweaks, with a reiteration it will remain ‘patient’ and data-dependent in adjusting policy. 2) The Fed’s projections for rates, growth and inflation are likely to be cut. 3) The central bank is likely to signal the end of QT this year. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21411/download\">Click here for the full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* US FACTORY ORDERS: </strong>Factory orders were soft in January. Barclays notes that demand for US manufactured goods has been weighed down by numerous and persistent influences (waning fiscal stimulus, soft external conditions, ongoing trade tensions, the impact of Fed tightening on rate sensitive areas). “Overall factory goods orders edged up 0.1% m/m in January, in line with our expectations (Barclays 0.1% m/m; consensus 0.3% m/m) and little changed from December’s 0.1% m/m increase,” Barclays wrote, “the soft overall reading mainly reflected weakness in the incoming estimates for nondurables, where orders slid another 0.2% m/m on the heels of January’s 1.1% m/m decline.”</p><p><strong>* BREXIT</strong>: Today’s key question was how long the UK will request the EU extend the Article 50 process by. After HoC speaker Bercow’s intervention on Monday, where he ruled that it would require a material tweaks to May’s MV3 before lawmakers could vote on it again, no third Meaningful Vote of UK PM May’s Brexit deal is expected before Thursday’s EU Summit, where the PM is expected to request an Article 50 process extension of between 9-12 months, The Sun reported. The EU would not immediately grant one, the latest reports suggest. The Guardian reckons a 3-9 months extension could be granted if May manages to pass MV3 (other said May wants the extension to be ‘as short as possible’). Other reports said the EU could make a contingent offer (details are thin on what this might look like), which could be finalised in the days before 29 March. May might even ask for both a short- and a long-extension request, based on various scenarios. The suggestion, essentially, is that any extension will likely be heavily caveated by both sides – how the practical implications of this work out remains to be seem, given that details are thin at this stage. The speaker himself today said that MPs would need to agree any Article 50 extension by the government, and if lawmakers thought the extension was too long/short, they could reject the deal and send May back to Europe to try again, the Telegraph said. Another spanner in the works emerged on reports that Brexiteer Tory MPs were using covert talks to request the EU countries veto an extension in order to move towards a “no-deal”. Additionally, it is worth noting that the DUP have said it would only back PM May’s deal unless it was sure it had the backing to pass a commons vote.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J9) SETTLES $0.06 LOWER AT $59.03; BRENT (K9) SETTLES $0.07 HIGHER AT $67.61. </strong>Crude prices<strong> </strong>traded<strong> </strong>higher in earlier trade before paring back gains through the day in a lack of substantial new information. The bull case is that “OPEC+ commitments to limit crude oil production are the chief fundamental support, although we also note some increase in supply as Libya’s 315,000 bpd Sharara field continues to ramp up following a three-month outage,” analysts at Citi argue. Libya's El Sharara oil field is currently pumping around 270k BPD, output may rise to 290k BPD following the completion of well maintenance. Elsewhere, Canada's Alberta province says it is increasing crude output limit by 25k BPD in May and another 25k BPD in June. The market is looking ahead to the weekly inventory data, with the APIs being released this evening; crude stocks for the week ending March 15th are seen drawing again at 0.8mln bbls, albeit less pronounced than the 3.8mln draw the prior week; both products are seen drawing too with distillates down by 1.3mln and gasoline down by 2.1mln; Genscape sees Cushing, Oklahoma building 468k bbls, following last weeks draw of a similar magnitude.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.01% at 2833, NDX +0.31% at 7349, DJI -0.10% at 25888.

Noble Energy (NBL) and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) benefitted from upgrades at Mizuho and JPMorgan respectively. Conversely, Fidelity (FIS), Vertex (VRTX) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) traded lower on the open following downgrades at SunTrust, SVB Leerink and Telsey respectively. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) traded higher after the unveiling of its Call of Duty: Mobile Edition, alongside Tencent (TCEHY). Align Technologies (ALGN) traded higher, supported by a price target rise at Piper Jaffray. Tesla (TSLA) opened lower after the SEC said CEO Musk’s tweets were a “blatant violation” of their settlement. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was an outperformer on constructive comments from Morgan Stanley, who are optimistic about a partnership with Google (GOOGL) in the gaming industry. Chesapeake (CHK) surged on a price target rise from Raymond James.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 2+ TICKS LOWER AT 122-24+. </strong>Early doors, the Tplex took its cue from a German ZEW report, after an upside surprise, and offering some hope that European survey data may begin improving (data surprises have been ticking up since end-Feb). Talk the ECB might have to broaden its asset purchases to include stocks lent some of a bid to the fixed complex. Also in the pre-market, there was a large 17k blocked seller of the June TY contract, reportedly real money, which piled pressure into the complex, helping rate differentials widen, and lifting USDJPY towards its 200-dma at 111.44. There were also reports of chunky put buying in the 10-year space, adding to the downside. After the equity complex stalled in afternoon trade, a slight bid returned in Treasuries, given a bit of a boost on newswire headlines questioning the progress of US/China trade, though subsequent reports painted a more optimistic picture. At settle, the curve was a touch narrower, though by less than 1bps.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>were in a pre-FOMC holding pattern, with ranges thin. The buck was apparently softer on fears of a dovish Fed, although some of the lumpy flows in fixed income question whether fixed income traders buy that theory. The Pound was again subject to Brexit headline risk, though within a small range. The Antipodes were mixed, with the Aussie trading lower after RBA meeting minutes that suggests the central bank is watching the data slate to build a case for rate cuts, while some housing data also did little to help. EMFX strengthens, with some suggesting it is positioning to capitalise on a dovish Fed, which will likely support EMFX and EM equities; ZAR was an exception, with load shedding continuing. Commodity FX started firm, but crude settled mixed, seeing some of the gains pared, though NOK still trades firmer against the EUR, likely underpinned by expectations of a Norges Bank rate cut on Thursday. Brazil President Bolsonaro visited Trump, and it appears Trump will now look at supporting NATO and OECD membership for the nation.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong>&nbsp;Sterling’s resilience in the early part of the session was attributed to HSBC’s interim dividend, as well as options flow. The pound also looked-through labour market data, and if traders need any further reminding, the theme is Brexit, and the pound’s resilience is a function of a belief that the UK will either be pushed into May’s Brexit deal, or an extension to the A50 process – none of which are likely to see a ‘cliff-edged’ Brexit. Morgan Stanley suggests that GBP remains a buy on dips, arguing that GBP is a cheap currency; even though a MV3 is unlikely this week, MS says the dynamic for GBP remains unchanged as there are ways this decision can be changed. “For example, the government should able to call a business motion to vote on allowing MV3 to be held if it looks as though a majority for an unchanged deal has emerged,” MS writes, “Thus, we continue to focus on whether the DUP is willing to offer its support for PM May's deal.” Gambling markets seem to be convinced that a no deal exit is unlikely, and an extension is likely. However, the attentive will note that from a technical standpoint, no deal is not entirely off the table just yet; EU’s Brexit negotiator himself said merely voting against a no-deal does not prevent it from happening; the EU could still reject the UK’s request (only one nation would be required to reject he request for it to be turned down); though that scenario is unlikely, the fallout for GBP could be stark under such conditions.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong>&nbsp;Even though the latest meeting minutes were slightly stale, in that the RBA's meeting came ahead of weak Q4 GDP numbers, the account noted uncertainty around output data, and the strong emphasis on a data-dependent approach is a hint policy rates will be cut ahead, Aussie bank Westpac said. The central bank once again also noted the divergence between wages and the strong labour market. The result was that 3yr Aussie yields fell below the 1.50% Cash Rate for the first time since 2016. There was also another weak batch of housing data, with an accelerating decline seen in the quarterly data. None of this has phased the Aussie, however, which largely moved horizontally through APAC/European/US trade, between ~0.7090-~0.7110, or thereabouts. The RBA clearly wants to see more evidence before pivoting to an easing bias, and accordingly, the labour market data overnight could see a more concerted move if we see a negative surprise, which would likely give the RBA more ammo to pivot.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong>&nbsp;For most of the session, the spot patrolled territory between the 100- and 200-dmas at 111.26 and 111.44, respectively, while action in EURJPY seems to be capped by its 100-dma (at 126.47), with ‘playing the range’ the theme ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC (expected dovish). There was an attempted breakout for USDJPY in the premarket, as aggressive downside was seen in Treasuries, widening yield differentials and giving the pair a bid. It took a confused set of trade headlines to push the yen out of its thin range, and a fresh LOD around 111.15 was seen.</p><p><strong>* CAD:&nbsp;</strong>More USD weakness rather than CAD strength driving the pair through 1.33, chewing through reported bids around 1.3280-90, and hitting 1.3250, before bouncing. Technical factors were cited, though some may have been mindful of the Canadian budget (released at the 1600 eastern time); Morgan Stanley says additional fiscal expansion is increasingly probable, and would potentially be CAD bullish – particularly if the spending were concentrated in regions affected by the fall in energy prices and supportive of indebted households – as this may raise the BOC’s confidence that further rate hikes are warranted. Looking ahead, inflation data at the end of the week will be the next domestic catalyst; the BOC’s core measures have been lingering around the 1.87%-2.00% area for most of the last 12 months, and there doesn’t appear to be much that will shake that this month.</p><p><strong>* RUB:&nbsp;</strong>The RUB (and INR) currently seem to the darling of EMFX, given that TRY has its own domestic issues (Turkey entered a technical recession last week), as well as the ZAR (Eskom woes weighing). The RUB has been supported by firmer crude prices, and the likely extension of the cartel’s supply cut agreement (also helping other crude exporters MXN and COP, this week), as well as demand for Russian OFZs. There is also the seasonal repatriation of RUB for VAT/corporation tax purposes; the effect is seen lasting for ten days, and is estimated will see EUR 25bln flow back into Russia. Monday’s manufacturing and industrial production also gave support, following the confusing run of data out of Russia, and also gives hopes to RUB bulls that the impact of US sanctions are now fading. Some have also argued that some parts of the EMFX complex are benefiting from Fed positioning, which is likely to benefit EMFX if the central bank dials up the dovishness. There is also the CBR meeting on Friday, where the narrative is turning slightly dovish, some argue, which could set up for strength of the RUB through the Fed, but perhaps some profit-taking towards the end of the week, given the recent run.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Also in the pre-market, there was a large 17k blocked seller of the June TY contract, reportedly real money, which piled pressure into the complex, helping rate differentials widen, and lifting USDJPY towards its 200-dma at 111.44. There were also reports of chunky put buying in the 10-year space, adding to the downside. After the equity complex stalled in afternoon trade, a slight bid returned in Treasuries, given a bit of a boost on newswire headlines questioning the progress of US/China trade, though subsequent reports painted a more optimistic picture. At settle, the curve was a touch narrower, though by less than 1bps.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "",
        "reaction_details": "",
        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> Markets were in a pre-FOMC holding pattern, with ranges thin. The buck was apparently softer on fears of a dovish Fed, although some of the lumpy flows in fixed income question whether fixed income traders buy that theory. The Pound was again subject to Brexit headline risk, though within a small range. The Antipodes were mixed, with the Aussie trading lower after RBA meeting minutes that suggests the central bank is watching the data slate to build a case for rate cuts, while some housing data also did little to help. EMFX strengthens, with some suggesting it is positioning to capitalise on a dovish Fed, which will likely support EMFX and EM equities; ZAR was an exception, with load shedding continuing. Commodity FX started firm, but crude settled mixed, seeing some of the gains pared, though NOK still trades firmer against the EUR, likely underpinned by expectations of a Norges Bank rate hike on Thursday. Brazil President Bolsonaro visited Trump, and it appears Trump will now look at supporting NATO and OECD membership for the nation.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Sterling’s resilience in the early part of the session was attributed to HSBC’s interim dividend, as well as options flow. The pound also looked-through labour market data, and if traders need any further reminding, the theme is Brexit, and the pound’s resilience is a function of a belief that the UK will either be pushed into May’s Brexit deal, or an extension to the A50 process – none of which are likely to see a ‘cliff-edged’ Brexit. Morgan Stanley suggests that GBP remains a buy on dips, arguing that GBP is a cheap currency; even though a MV3 is unlikely this week, MS says the dynamic for GBP remains unchanged as there are ways this decision can be changed. “For example, the government should able to call a business motion to vote on allowing MV3 to be held if it looks as though a majority for an unchanged deal has emerged,” MS writes, “Thus, we continue to focus on whether the DUP is willing to offer its support for PM May's deal.” Gambling markets seem to be convinced that a no deal exit is unlikely, and an extension is likely. However, the attentive will note that from a technical standpoint, no deal is not entirely off the table just yet; EU’s Brexit negotiator himself said merely voting against a no-deal does not prevent it from happening; the EU could still reject the UK’s request (only one nation would be required to reject he request for it to be turned down); though that scenario is unlikely, the fallout for GBP could be stark under such conditions.</p><p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Even though the latest meeting minutes were slightly stale, in that the RBA's meeting came ahead of weak Q4 GDP numbers, the account noted uncertainty around output data, and the strong emphasis on a data-dependent approach is a hint policy rates will be cut ahead, Aussie bank Westpac said. The central bank once again also noted the divergence between wages and the strong labour market. The result was that 3yr Aussie yields fell below the 1.50% Cash Rate for the first time since 2016. There was also another weak batch of housing data, with an accelerating decline seen in the quarterly data. None of this has phased the Aussie, however, which largely moved horizontally through APAC/European/US trade, between ~0.7090-~0.7110, or thereabouts. The RBA clearly wants to see more evidence before pivoting to an easing bias, and accordingly, the labour market data overnight could see a more concerted move if we see a negative surprise, which would likely give the RBA more ammo to pivot.</p><p><strong>* JPY:</strong> For most of the session, the spot patrolled territory between the 100- and 200-dmas at 111.26 and 111.44, respectively, while action in EURJPY seems to be capped by its 100-dma (at 126.47), with ‘playing the range’ the theme ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC (expected dovish). There was an attempted breakout for USDJPY in the premarket, as aggressive downside was seen in Treasuries, widening yield differentials and giving the pair a bid. It took a confused set of trade headlines to push the yen out of its thin range, and a fresh LOD around 111.15 was seen.</p><p><strong>* CAD: </strong>More USD weakness rather than CAD strength driving the pair through 1.33, chewing through reported bids around 1.3280-90, and hitting 1.3250, before bouncing. Technical factors were cited, though some may have been mindful of the Canadian budget (released at the 1600 eastern time); Morgan Stanley says additional fiscal expansion is increasingly probable, and would potentially be CAD bullish – particularly if the spending were concentrated in regions affected by the fall in energy prices and supportive of indebted households – as this may raise the BOC’s confidence that further rate hikes are warranted. Looking ahead, inflation data at the end of the week will be the next domestic catalyst; the BOC’s core measures have been lingering around the 1.87%-2.00% area for most of the last 12 months, and there doesn’t appear to be much that will shake that this month.</p><p><strong>* RUB: </strong>The RUB (and INR) currently seem to the darling of EMFX, given that TRY has its own domestic issues (Turkey entered a technical recession last week), as well as the ZAR (Eskom woes weighing). The RUB has been supported by firmer crude prices, and the likely extension of the cartel’s supply cut agreement (also helping other crude exporters MXN and COP, this week), as well as demand for Russian OFZs. There is also the seasonal repatriation of RUB for VAT/corporation tax purposes; the effect is seen lasting for ten days, and is estimated will see EUR 25bln flow back into Russia. Monday’s manufacturing and industrial production also gave support, following the confusing run of data out of Russia, and also gives hopes to RUB bulls that the impact of US sanctions are now fading. Some have also argued that some parts of the EMFX complex are benefiting from Fed positioning, which is likely to benefit EMFX if the central bank dials up the dovishness. There is also the CBR meeting on Friday, where the narrative is turning slightly dovish, some argue, which could set up for strength of the RUB through the Fed, but perhaps some profit-taking towards the end of the week, given the recent run.</p>",

The bull case is that “OPEC+ commitments to limit crude oil production are the chief fundamental support, although we also note some increase in supply as Libya’s 315,000 bpd Sharara field continues to ramp up following a three-month outage,” analysts at Citi argue. Libya's El Sharara oil field is currently pumping around 270k BPD, output may rise to 290k BPD following the completion of well maintenance. Elsewhere, Canada's Alberta province says it is increasing crude output limit by 25k BPD in May and another 25k BPD in June. The market is looking ahead to the weekly inventory data, with the APIs being released this evening; crude stocks for the week ending March 15th are seen drawing again at 0.8mln bbls, albeit less pronounced than the 3.8mln draw the prior week; both products are seen drawing too with distillates down by 1.3mln and gasoline down by 2.1mln; Genscape sees Cushing, Oklahoma building 468k bbls, following last weeks draw of a similar magnitude.</p>",

In particular, we expect global growth to remain weak, prompting investors to move away from “risky” assets into safe havens, like German Bunds,\" CapEco writes, but notes that \"such a flight to safety could also put upward pressure on the credit spreads of bonds in the euro-zone's periphery. Bonds in Italy are likely to fare especially poorly in our view, owing to its weak economy and public finances and its vulnerability to a new clash with the European Commission.\"</li><li>CapEco believes that the peripheral bond performance will improve considerably in 2020 as looser monetary policy in the US rekindles appetite for risk, and the ECB re-launches its asset purchase programme, which will likely keep core yields low, even as sentiment improves, CapEco writes.</li><li>\"Admittedly, the case for QE is not as compelling today as in March 2015, when policymakers were much more concerned about deflationary risks. But the outlook for the euro-zone economy is deteriorating and, with few policy options left, we suspect that the ECB will be forced to re-launch QE by this time next year,\" and the consultancy adds that although it anticipates bond yields in the periphery will in general decline by more than in the core in 2020, Italy might be an exception.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>A mixture of pre-FOMC and Canadian Federal budget positioning, bullish technical impulses and still relatively firm oil prices has catapulted the Loonie through recent psychological resistance vs its US peer around 1.3300, and beyond offers reportedly sitting between 1.3280-90 to a 1.3250 peak before running out of steam. However, Usd/Cad now looks primed to test deeper near term chart levels around 1.3236 that coincides with a couple of late February lows.</p><p><strong>NZD</strong></p><p>The next best major and also a beneficiary of broader Usd<strong> </strong>weakness ahead of the Fed, though the Kiwi may be deriving some indirect impetus from closer to home as the <strong>AUD </strong>underperforms in wake of more dire data and latest RBA minutes reinforcing an equal weighting between a hike and cut as the next move in rates. Moreover, the Nzd may finally be gleaning some support from another recovery in dairy and whole milk prices at the GDT auction. Nzd/Usd hugging the top of a 0.6870-40 range on the wide, Aud/Usd still clinging to 0.7100 and Aud/Nzd back below 1.0350 ahead of NZ Q4 current account data, and then Q4 GDP on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>The Franc is edging higher after breaching parity vs the Dollar and eyeing 0.9900 next, but the single currency is still facing stiff technical resistance above 1.1350, like 1.1373 that equates to a 50% retracement of the ytd drop from peak to trough even though the <strong>DXY </strong>sits precariously towards the base of a 96.518-388 range (and just above 96.283 support from late last month).</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>The Pound and Yen are lagging G10 counterparts, albeit both keeping their noses in front of the Greenback, as Cable holds above 1.3200 and Usd/Jpy is capped ahead of 111.50. However, the Pound is well off best levels circa 1.3310 amidst ongoing acrimony over House Speaker Bercow raising legal objections and precedents against UK PM May going back to Parliament with the same WA, even if she managed to muster enough support at the 3rd time of asking. The upshot and essentially confirmed by her Brexit Minister Barclay is that a delay to the March 29 Article 50 deadline will be necessary and latest reports suggest that May will be sending a letter to Brussels with 2 requests for a short (technical?) extension plus a longer one (that will have to be backed by a sound/valid fundamental reason). Back to the Jpy, and a false break of the 200 DMA at 111.45 came alongside rising US Treasury yields and pronounced curve steepening, but the headline pair is back down in an approximate 111.50-15 range.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p><p>The Scandi crowns are both revelling in risk-on trade, but also on regional CB impulses vs ECB and elsewhere, as the Riksbank continues to discount recent soft Swedish inflation as transitory, while the Norges Bank looks all set to match overwhelming market expectations and past guidance with a 25 bp hike this Thursday. Eur/Sek currently just off a 10.4320 low and Eur/Nok sub-9.6700.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>Major European equities are firmer [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.5%] following a relatively indecisive overnight session, where main Asian indices finished essentially flat ahead of this weeks key risk events. Notable movers this morning include Antofagasta (+4.0%) after FY earnings and the Co. stating they expect 2019 to be another record setting year, as such the Materials sector is higher by around 0.7%; more broadly all sectors are in the green. Towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Deutsche Bank (-2.5%) and Commerzbank (-2.5%), likely affected by some retracement from yesterdays gains on conformation of merger discussion and Fitch stating that the talks highlight challenges and pressures of both banks to improve profitability. Commerzbank are also hampered by being downgraded at RBC. Elsewhere, following reports of a cyber attack, the impact of which is still being assessed, Norsk Hydro (-1.6%) are in the red; subsequent reports indicate that only the Co. has been affected by the attack.</p><p>FX</p><p>DXY - The broad Dollar remains depressed in advance of FOMC day 1 amidst widespread anticipation that the March policy meeting will culminate in a further dovish shift via downgraded SEP forecasts and more details about the earlier end to QT. Indeed, the index has probed a fraction deeper beneath recent lows and is currently below key technical support at 96.434 (50% Fib retracement of the prior move from 95.157 to 97.711), which could be telling on a closing basis even before the Fed pronouncements tomorrow and Chair Powell’s presser.</p><p>G10 - Notwithstanding the generally soft Greenback, ranges are relatively tight with only marginal deviations around data for the likes of the Pound and Aussie. Cable has recovered from yesterday’s Brexit upset with the aid of an almost universally strong ONS labour market report to retest offers and resistance ahead of the 1.3300 level, while in contrast Aud/Usd has lost more momentum above 0.7100 after RBA minutes underlining the neutral stance and house price data compounding weakness in the economy overall. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy has pulled back a bit further towards 111.00 having retreated through the 200 DMA at 111.45, but Eur/Usd is still butting up against upside chart hurdles above 1.1350, including a Fib at 1.1373, which represents a 50% reversal from 2019 high to low. The Franc is attempting to breach parity again following a solid Swiss trade surplus and pre-SNB, while the Loonie is also eyeing 1.3300 peaks vs its US counterpart against the backdrop of firmer crude prices. Back down under, the Kiwi is pivoting 0.6850 ahead of NZ Q4 current account data and the latest GDT auction.</p><p>Note, some BIG OPTION EXPIRIES could factor in the absence of anything more directional ahead of the NY cut today, with 1 bn in Cable at 1.3290-1.3300, 1.2 bn in Usd/Jpy between 11.30-40 and 1.3 bn in Aud/Jpy from 79.35-50 as the cross hovers just shy of 79.00.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>More volatile and edgy trade in Gilts and Bunds after upbeat UK data and German survey releases, but more so on ever-changing and fluid Brexit related reports, with the former back down to intraday lows and latter down in sympathy having carved out a marginal new Eurex peak of 164.35 at one stage (+8 ticks vs -9 ticks at the trough). However, US Treasuries remain fractionally firmer and the curve incrementally flatter, with little if no contagion from any moves in counterpart EU benchmarks as the countdown to the FOMC kicks off in earnest. Ahead, revisions to durable goods that were better than expected in the preliminary report, headline, and factory orders.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI (+0.4%) and Brent (+0.5%)</strong> are somewhat firmer after a quiet overnight session, although WTI prices are inching closer to USD 60/bbl having surpassed the USD 59.50/bbl mark to the upside; as oil closed at its highest level YTD yesterday. News flow for the complex continues to be quiet after OPEC cancelled the April meeting and are to decide on output cuts in June. Looking ahead we have the US API Weekly release, which previously indicated a crude stocks draw of 2.6M.</p><p><strong>Gold (+0.2%)</strong> is largely unchanged, trading around the middle of the day’s range on a lack of catalysts and a subdued dollar ahead of this weeks key events. Elsewhere, <strong>spot Palladium</strong> has passed USD 1600/oz for the first time this morning following reports that Russia are considering a ban on the exports of precious metal scrap, in an attempt to promote domestic refining. Russian are one of the worlds top Palladium exporters, responsible for around 21% of total palladium exports in 2017 by value.</p><p>Libya's El Sharara oil field pumps around 270k BPD, output may rise to 290k BPD; following the completion of well-maintenance.

Notable movers this morning include Antofagasta (+4.8%) after FY earnings and the Co. stating they expect 2019 to be another record setting year, as such the Materials sector is higher by around 0.8%; more broadly all sectors are in the green. Towards the bottom of the Stoxx 600 are Deutsche Bank (-2.1%) and Commerzbank (-2.6%), likely affected by some retracement from yesterdays gains on conformation of merger discussion and Fitch stating that the talks highlight challenges and pressures of both banks to improve profitability. Commerzbank are also hampered by being downgraded at RBC. Elsewhere, following reports of a cyber attack, the impact of which is still being assessed, Norsk Hydro (-1.1%) are in the red; subsequent reports indicate that only the Co. has been affected by the attack.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>DXY </strong>The broad Dollar remains depressed in advance of FOMC day 1 amidst widespread anticipation that the March policy meeting will culminate in a further dovish shift via downgraded SEP forecasts and more details about the earlier end to QT. Indeed, the index has probed a fraction deeper beneath recent lows and is currently below key technical support at 96.434 (50% Fib retracement of the prior move from 95.157 to 97.711), which could be telling on a closing basis even before the Fed pronouncements tomorrow and Chair Powell’s presser.</p><p><strong>G10 </strong>Notwithstanding the generally soft Greenback, ranges are relatively tight with only marginal deviations around data for the likes of the Pound and Aussie. Cable has recovered from yesterday’s Brexit upset with the aid of an almost universally strong ONS labour market report to retest offers and resistance ahead of the 1.3300 level, while in contrast Aud/Usd has lost more momentum above 0.7100 after RBA minutes underlining the neutral stance and house price data compounding weakness in the economy overall. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy has pulled back a bit further towards 111.00 having retreated through the 200 DMA at 111.45, but Eur/Usd is still butting up against upside chart hurdles above 1.1350, including a Fib at 1.1373, which represents a 50% reversal from 2019 high to low. The Franc is attempting to breach parity again following a solid Swiss trade surplus and pre-SNB, while the Loonie is also eyeing 1.3300 peaks vs its US counterpart against the backdrop of firmer crude prices. Back down under, the Kiwi is pivoting 0.6850 ahead of NZ Q4 current account data and the latest GDT auction.</p><p>Note, some <strong>BIG OPTION EXPIRIES </strong>could factor in the absence of anything more directional ahead of the NY cut today, with 1 bn in Cable at 1.3290-1.3300, 1.2 bn in Usd/Jpy between 11.30-40 and 1.3 bn in Aud/Jpy from 79.35-50 as the cross hovers just shy of 79.00.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>More volatile and edgy trade in Gilts and Bunds after upbeat UK data and German survey releases, but more so on ever-changing and fluid Brexit related reports, with the former back down to intraday lows and latter down in sympathy having carved out a marginal new Eurex peak of 164.35 at one stage (+8 ticks vs -9 ticks at the trough). However, US Treasuries remain fractionally firmer and the curve incrementally flatter, with little if no contagion from any moves in counterpart EU benchmarks as the countdown to the FOMC kicks off in earnest. Ahead, revisions to durable goods that were better than expected in the preliminary report, headline, and factory orders.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI (+0.8%) and Brent (+0.8%)</strong> are somewhat firmer after a quiet overnight session, although WTI prices are inching closer to USD 60/bbl having surpassed the USD 59.50/bbl mark to the upside; as oil closed at its highest level YTD yesterday. News flow for the complex continues to be quiet after OPEC cancelled the April meeting and are to decide on output cuts in June. Looking ahead we have the US API Weekly release, which previously indicated a crude stocks draw of 2.6M.</p><p><strong>Gold (+0.4%)</strong> is largely unchanged, trading around the middle of the day’s range on a lack of catalysts and a subdued dollar ahead of this weeks key events. Elsewhere, <strong>spot Palladium</strong> has passed USD 1600/oz for the first time this morning following reports that Russia are considering a ban on the exports of precious metal scrap, in an attempt to promote domestic refining. Russian are one of the worlds top&nbsp; Palladium exporters, responsible for around 21% of total palladium exports in 2017 by value.</p>",

On that note, Brexit Secretary Barclay maintains that another Meaningful Vote could still occur if the Government can demonstrate that the situation has changed and there is enough will in Parliament to convince Bercow that it is warranted, but the odds have lengthened considerably and an A50 extension is inevitable.&nbsp;</p>",

Underlying bids continue to cushion Bunds below the 164.00 handle, while offers have been capping the core Eurozone bond ahead of the contract high, with intermittent switching apparent to and from the periphery also keeping the boundaries intact. However, the upcoming German ZEW survey could provide some impetus to probe outside recent ranges as the first indication of economic sentiment for the current month, and as a pre-cursor to the flash PMIs due for release on Friday. Also ahead, another speech by outgoing ECB chief economist Praet. Bunds last at 164.29 vs 164.32 at best so far.</p>",

ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are choppy with strength in mining names eventually overshadowed by weakness in energy and financials in Australia, while jittery trade in Japan largely reflected currency fluctuations. Elsewhere, sentiment in China has also been fickle with Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) swinging between gains and losses as focus centres on earnings and after another tepid liquidity effort by the PBoC.</p><p>In FX markets, price action in USD is subdued with the DXY contained slightly below the 96.50 level as the upcoming FOMC remains at the forefront of investor anticipation, with the Fed expected to cut growth, inflation and dot plot forecasts, as well as confirm the end of the balance sheet runoff this year. The greenback’s major counterparts also struggle for direction with EUR little changed in the midst of a cluster of MA levels ranging from its 5DMA-100DMA, while GBP/USD continues to pick itself up from the prior day’s Brexit-related disarray after UK House Speaker Bercow blocked a third meaningful vote unless the government makes changes to PM May’s deal, which some analysts later suggested provides PM May more time to get support for the deal. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are pressured by the temperamental risk appetite, while AUD/USD is also on thin ice at the 0.7100 handle after weaker than expected House Price data added to Australia’s streak of soft releases and as the 3yr yield briefly slipped below the RBA’s 1.50% Cash Rate Target for the first time since 2016.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid the indecisive risk sentiment in the region and with investors sidelined ahead of a 20yr auction later.</p>",

The RBA also said outlook for global growth remains reasonable, although downside risks have increased and that its base case for GDP growth is at 3% this year, while its base case for underlying inflation at 2% for 2019 and 2.25% for 2020.</p><p>As a guide, AUD/USD saw mild support from the announcement which was then pared back shortly after as the statement provided very little in new information, while it is worth noting that GDP numbers were released the following day after the meeting which fell short of estimates.</p>",
