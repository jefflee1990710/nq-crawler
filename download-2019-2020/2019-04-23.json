Coca-Cola (KO) shares moved higher after the soft drink maker reported a beat of top and bottom-line earnings expectations. Verizon (VZ) opened lower after the telecommunication co. reported a miss on top line earnings expectations. P&amp;G (PG) traded lower despite the consumer goods maker beating top and bottom-line earnings expectations, perhaps as a result of falling revenue in its grooming and organic products areas. Pfizer (PFE) and Eli Lily (LLY) shares moved higher throughout the session on positive reports that the companies’ joint drug tanezumab is proving effective in osteoarthritis treatment. Hasbro (HAS) shares jumped higher after the toy maker reported a surprise profit in Q1. A strong earnings showing from Kohls Corporations (KSS) showed strong growth in foot traffic, hinting at a strong quarter for brick and mortar retailors. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and United Technologies (UTX) shares moved higher after both defence contractors beat earning expectations. Peers, including Northrop Gunman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) also moved higher in sympathy. Tesla (TSLA) opened lower following CEO Musk comments on future Model S/3/X weekly output and some criticism of the automakers self-driving technology from Consumer Reports. Qualcomm (QCOM) traded higher after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company to ‘overweight’. SPX +0.9% at 2933, NDX +1.26% at 7811, DJI +0.6% at 26656.</p><p>Monday's price action saw the curve bear-steepen; that steepening continued on Tuesday, but it was in a bull steepening fashion; most major curve spreads widened. An auction of 2s came in on the screws, with cover slightly softer than recent averages, and the internals weren't particularly great, with indirect bidders falling, seeing direct bidder participation rising - dealers were also larger participants than the prior auction. Ahead of tomorrow's 5s auction, the sector is set up and trades cheap on the curve compared with 2s and 10s, according to SocGen notes; it also trades cheap in asset swap versus older 5s. \"While the dealer holdings of the 3-6y sector are the highest since December 2018, the current 5y benchmark trading special on repo (indicating a short base) is likely to help in the takedown of the auction,\" the bank says. It also notes that at pixel time, the WI trades above the stop-out rate of the previous auction, which could be supportive, and SocGen generally holds a positive bias going into the auction. US T-note futures (m9) settled 6 ticks higher at 123-04.</p>",

In the fall out, several countries and institutions have publicly addressed their commitment to maintain a balanced oil market should Iranian supply fall to zero. OPEC sources stated that Gulf producers could increase their output in response to the drop in Iranian supply, but only if there is enough demand; the sources also said that May output will be higher than that of April, but still within the OPEC production target and that the rise is not related to Iranian sanctions. India’s Oil Minister Pradhan said India has a robust plan regarding supply to oil refiners and that there will be additional supplies from other major oil producing nations. The IEA said it sees global spare oil production capacity at 3.3mln BPD, and that it is ready to act to ensure the oil market is well supplied if necessary. Iran’s oil minister Zanganeh said that the US will not achieve its dream of bringing Iranian oil exports to zero, adding that the US has made a bad mistake by politicising oil and using it as a weapon. “As for the oil market, the immediate question is whether Monday’s price rally “got it right”,” Citigroup analysts comment. Elsewhere, underpinning the market in recent months is the prospect of a US-China trade deal materialising, however Citigroup goes on to suggest that the turn of events in Iran pose a risk to a deal, “China imported 585,000 bpd of Iranian crude oil during 2018 and has previously signalled that it doesn’t cooperate with unilateral sanctions,” adding that, “any Chinese refusal to cooperate with US sanctions would be a potential deal-breaker.” After the bell on Tuesday the API will release its read on US energy inventories for the prior week, which are likely to be less focused on this week following the Iranian sanctions. Crude stocks are seen building 1.3mln bbls, the products are both seen drawing, gasoline by 1mln bbls and distillates by 1.2mln bbls; Genscape forecasts the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub to show a build of 80k bbls.</p><p><strong>* US NEW HOME SALES: </strong>US new home sales for March increased by 4.5% to a 692K-unit pace, beating the expected contraction of -2.5%, and holding pace with February’s figure which was revised up from 4.9% to 5.9%. “While existing sales were softer during the month, the housing market appears to be improving as the spring selling season gets underway,” Wells Fargo Economics’ analysts comment. During March approximately 50% of home sales occurred below USD 300k, above from 2018’s 43% average, “Builder discounting and a shift in focus toward building lower priced homes in more affordable areas continue to keep price increases in check,” Wells adds.</p><p><strong>* BOC PREVIEW: </strong>Rate decision and Monetary Policy Report will be published at 1000 EDT/1500 BST on 24 April 2019; a press conference with Governor Poloz and Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins will take place at 1130 EST/1630 BST.<strong> </strong>The Bank is expected to keep rates unchanged at 1.75%. The latest MPR is expected to see 2019 growth projections trimmed; there will be focus on whether the Bank adjusts its estimate of neutral (currently 2.5-3.5%). Analysts will also be keeping an eye on whether the BOC drops its hiking bias. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21667/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p><p><strong>* NEC DIRECTOR KUDLOW:</strong> said that the Fed target rate should be lowered, reiterating comments made on 7 April and 29 March. He also noted further progress on the US/China trade front, with the two sides moving closer to a deal and considering a visitation exchange as part of the talks. Again, this is largely a reiteration of comments he made on 3 and 7 April. Weighing in on the effect of ending the Iranian oil waivers, Kudlow stated that the decision would not put upward pressure on oil prices and the markets are well supplied.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 6 TICKS HIGHER AT 123-04.</strong> Monday's price action saw the curve bear-steepen; that steepening continued on Tuesday, but it was in a bull steepening fashion; most major curve spreads widened. An auction of 2s came in on the screws, with cover slightly softer than recent averages, and the internals weren't particularly great, with indirect bidders falling, seeing direct bidder participation rising - dealers were also larger participants than the prior auction. Ahead of tomorrow's 5s auction, the sector is set up and trades cheap on the curve compared with 2s and 10s, according to SocGen notes; it also trades cheap in asset swap versus older 5s. \"While the dealer holdings of the 3-6y sector are the highest since December 2018, the current 5y benchmark trading special on repo (indicating a short base) is likely to help in the takedown of the auction,\" the bank says. It also notes that at pixel time, the WI trades above the stop-out rate of the previous auction, which could be supportive, and SocGen generally holds a positive bias going into the auction.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The USD rose to near two-year highs on Tuesday; in the early part of trade, the complex took its cue from gold, where a large seller emerged, pushing gold down to 1266. The USD began ticking higher against most majors, and decent new home sales data for March – which was contrary to the weak existing home sales data for March – buoyed confidence, while a soft EZ consumer confidence report gave traders little reason to buy the EUR. Additionally, a widening Bund/BTP spread is beginning to re-assert influence on EUR (negative EUR). Other factors also played a role, analysts said, pointing to the effective Fed Funds Rate widening to a record 4bps over the IOER, with some suggestions that USD liquidity conditions were becoming tighter. GBP was lower on a combination of following the EUR (analysts note remind us of the correlation) and pressure ratcheting up on UK PM May to leave her role, while the aforementioned dollar was also singing the tune. Petro FX was mixed, with the RUB carving out another day of gains ahead of the CBR meeting later this week, though the NOK couldn’t gain against either the EUR or USD; neither could CAD ahead of tomorrow’s BOC meeting, where the central bank is seen holding rates, revising down near-term growth projections, and may be even dropping its hiking bias; as was Monday’s playbook, the oil importers were sold (INR, TRY, KRW) against the buck. The Aussie was also was a function of dollar moves, though traders now turn their attention to the Aussie CPI report due overnight, which is expected to disappoint to the downside, and add further weight to the argument that the RBA could pivot dovish later this year. EMFX succumbed to the dollar strength, though BRL was stronger, as the government reaches an agreement about the pension reform bill, with assurances that it had not been watered down.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Crude prices kept climbing on Tuesday as the market continued to digest the expiry of US waivers on Iranian crude. In the fall out, several countries and institutions have publicly addressed their commitment to maintain a balanced oil market should Iranian supply fall to zero. OPEC sources stated that Gulf producers could increase their output in response to the drop in Iranian supply, but only if there is enough demand; the sources also said that May output will be higher than that of April, but still within the OPEC production target and that the rise is not related to Iranian sanctions. India’s Oil Minister Pradhan said India has a robust plan regarding supply to oil refiners and that there will be additional supplies from other major oil producing nations. The IEA said it sees global spare oil production capacity at 3.3mln BPD, and that it is ready to act to ensure the oil market is well supplied if necessary. Iran’s oil minister Zanganeh said that the US will not achieve its dream of bringing Iranian oil exports to zero, adding that the US has made a bad mistake by politicising oil and using it as a weapon. “As for the oil market, the immediate question is whether Monday’s price rally “got it right”,” Citigroup analysts comment. Elsewhere, underpinning the market in recent months is the prospect of a US-China trade deal materialising, however Citigroup goes on to suggest that the turn of events in Iran pose a risk to a deal, “China imported 585,000 bpd of Iranian crude oil during 2018 and has previously signalled that it doesn’t cooperate with unilateral sanctions,” adding that, “any Chinese refusal to cooperate with US sanctions would be a potential deal-breaker.” After the bell on Tuesday the API will release its read on US energy inventories for the prior week, which are likely to be less focused on this week following the Iranian sanctions. Crude stocks are seen building 1.3mln bbls, the products are both seen drawing, gasoline by 1mln bbls and distillates by 1.2mln bbls; Genscape forecasts the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub to show a build of 80k bbls.</p>",

Saudis have cut around 1.2mln BPD of production vs the 2018 peak, so there is an argument that there is capacity to offset lost Iranian crude exports, however, the question remains how quickly the US/Saudi/UAE will ramp production.</li><li>UBS says that OPEC and its OPEC+ partners (mainly Russia) had originally agreed to adjust planned production cuts to reflect unplanned outages, but despite major issues in recent months in Libya, Venezuela and Iran, no adjustment has occurred. The bank's strategists have taken this as unambiguous evidence that OPEC wants a higher oil price, and while that likely remains the case, the group will want to avoid prices high enough to become a drag on demand. &nbsp;</li><li>The bank says that 19 May is the next OPEC ministerial meeting, ahead of the full OPEC meeting in June; while the meetings will help to provide clarity, desks do not rule out the potential of unilateral action before then.</li></ul>",

The Fed will allow USD 29.8bln to run off its balance sheet at month-end, and will add on a modest USD 0.6bln to 2s and 5s, USD 0.5bln to 7s, and USD 0.3bln to the FRNs.</p><p><strong>* 2-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> Recent auctions have been decent, with investors starved for returns, TD Securities said. \"While the market has trimmed their pricing for Fed rate cuts to 12bp from 33bp in 2019, investors continue to expect cuts this year and in 2020,\" the bank says, \"we believe that despite solid underlying fundamentals, expectations of a dovish Fed stance will help keep 10y rates pinned in the 2.40-2.60% range,\" and adds \"we similarly expect the Treasury to trim 2-3y auction sizes, aiding demand at the front-end.\" Recent averages a stop on the screws with a 63% buyside takedown, the bank predicts. It also notes that the sector has cheapened on the curve, which might be supportive.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/dc271a8f-b259-4470-a08d-6c1477ff98b9.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is now firmer across the board, with the DXY surpassing its previous ytd peak (97.783 vs 97.711 on March 7) at 97.704 having breached near term resistance (97.517), as several Usd/majors test recent and/or 2019 extremes. However, after a relatively subdued return from Easter and contained range for the Greenback overall, trade livened up on the back of activity in commodities and bullion where a hefty futures sale appears to have sparked tech stops on a break of the 21 DMA in Xau/Usd and knock-on selling. Chart-wise, a close above 97.640 may be key for further gains to 97.873 (Fib level) and then an approach towards 98.000.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>The Franc looks set to end Tuesday’s EU session as the major underperformer as it slides through the psychological 1.0200 level vs the Buck and extends losses against the Euro to 1.1475 in wake of dovish comments from SNB chair Jordan last Friday (and namely that Swiss rates can turn more negative) at one stage.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The next weakest G10 links as the Aussie and Kiwi both lose more ground to their US counterpart and test recent lows ahead of so called ‘flash crash’ troughs. Aud/Usd has fallen below the 55 DMA and a Fib (at 0.7111 and 0.7104 respectively) to sub-0.7100 and Nzd/Usd is under 0.6650 ahead of Aussie inflation data and NZ trade on Wednesday and Thursday. Similarly, the Loonie is back under 1.3400, ignoring a mixed Canadian wholesale trade update and latest rally in crude in advance of tomorrow’s BoC policy meeting and MPR that could be more dovish/downbeat, or at least cautious – preview recently posted via the Ransquawk headline feed. Elsewhere, the single currency lost sight of the 21 DMA (1.1251) and a hefty cluster of option expiries between 1.1250-60 (2.3 bn) on its way down through the pre-Easter low and a serious look at 1.1200 before support at 1.1187 and this year’s low so far at 1.1177.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the aforementioned Euro declines vs the Buck, an element of risk aversion and bearish chart impulses prevented the Nok in particular from further oil-related gains as both Scandi currencies lost out to the Eur. Eur/Nok rebounded beyond 9.6000 at one stage and Eur/Sek only a few pips short of 10.5200.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>Sterling eventually succumbed to overall Dollar strength, with Cable retreating all the way from 1.3000+ through the 200 DMA (1.2966) and March’s trough (1.2945) to circa 1.2930, but the Yen continues to hold up relatively well amidst UST yield retracement and less divergence vs JGBs in wake of the BoJ’s latest Rinban reduction. Indeed, Usd/Jpy only extended its topside to 112.03 before slipping back below the big figure.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Choppy trade across the region, but ultimately losses vs the Usd as the Real awaits more on the Brazilian pension reform passage, the Rand suffers from latest Eskom funding shortfalls and the Lira suffers more Turkish political angst after the AKP’s request to rerun the Istanbul vote is turned down.</p>",

Sectors are similarly mixed, although the significant outperformance in energy names continues following on from the lifting of Iranian waivers; as such Shell (+2.0%) are firmly in the green with the Co. also aided by the agreement to sell their 50% stake in SAREF to Saudi Aramco for USD 631mln. Due to the strong performance in Shell, alongside the Co. representing 11.3% of the FTSE 100 due to it having two listings in the form of A and B shares, the FTSE 100 (+0.4%) is outperforming its peers. Other notable movers this morning include Umicore (-15.4%) who are underperforming the Stoxx 600 following the Co. warning that 2020 revenue and earnings growth will be below expectations. Separately, Wirecard (-2.9%) are down after the expiration of BaFin’s short selling ban on Friday April 19th. Elsewhere, Thomas Cook (+16.3%) are soaring after reports that the Co. has received approaches for sections/entirety of the Co., with names such as Forsum International, KKR and EQT citied as potential bidders.</p><p>FX</p><p>DXY - The index remains firm and comfortably above the 97.000 handle within a 97.281-402 range amidst Greenback gains vs most major counterparts and EM rivals as the latest rally in oil prices continues to undermine crude importers and risk sentiment more broadly to the detriment of high beta currencies.

Sectors are similarly mixed, although the significant outperformance in energy names continues following on from the lifting of Iranian waivers; as such Shell (+2.0%) are firmly in the green with the Co. also aided by the agreement to sell their 50% stake in SAREF to Saudi Aramco for USD 631mln. Due to the strong performance in Shell, alongside the Co. representing 11.3% of the FTSE 100 due to it having two listings in the form of A and B shares, the FTSE 100 (+0.4%) is outperforming its peers. Other notable movers this morning include Umicore (-15.4%) who are underperforming the Stoxx 600 following the Co. warning that 2020 revenue and earnings growth will be below expectations. Separately, Wirecard (-2.9%) are down after the expiration of BaFin’s short selling ban on Friday April 19th. Elsewhere, Thomas Cook (+16.3%) are soaring after reports that the Co. has received approaches for sections/entirety of the Co., with names such as Forsum International, KKR and EQT citied as potential bidders.</p><p>FX</p><p>DXY - The index remains firm and comfortably above the 97.000 handle within a 97.281-402 range amidst Greenback gains vs most major counterparts and EM rivals as the latest rally in oil prices continues to undermine crude importers and risk sentiment more broadly to the detriment of high beta currencies.

Q4 earnings were better than expected on the back of tax rates, aerospace business, continued passenger mile growth, and the contribution from Rockwell Collins, which was recently acquired (company expects it to be accretive to earnings in FY 2019). Look for commentary on a ramp-up of GTF Engine production, new products. Analysts are looking for continued growth in refrigeration and HVAC businesses. On the other side, analysts want to see some cost management, since if it remains unchecked, has the potential to weigh on profitability this year (cost of sales was running at 16.5% Y/Y in Q4); additionally, some analysts have wanted to see UTX keep an eye on debt levels, for the same reason. Given UTX aims to expand in foreign territories, it will be interesting to see the impact of FX.</li></ul><p><i><strong>Source: Barclays, RANsquawk, RBC, Refinitiv.</strong></i></p><p><strong>NOTE: RANsquawk is trialling this new format for US earnings previews and would welcome your feedback.

However, the DXY still needs to overcome early April highs at 95.517 to expose ytd peaks posted in the previous month and virtually matching late 2018 levels just above 97.700.</p><p><strong>CHF/AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The G10 laggards and largest losers against the buoyant Buck, as the Franc extends its decline further towards 1.0200 and through 1.1450 vs a relatively resilient Euro, while the Aussie and Kiwi hover closer to the bottom of 0.7140-10 and 0.6685-57 ranges vs their US peer on more dovish RBA and RBNZ policy leanings compared to the Fed. On that note, the Aud will be eyeing Q1 inflation data overnight amidst the consensus for a slowdown in q/q and y/y CPI rates with caution given latest RBA minutes revealing discussions about the conditions that may warrant a lower OCR including weaker price developments along with any deterioration in the labour market. Elsewhere, even the Nok is underperforming alongside the Sek as the Scandi Crowns fall victim to overall aversion rather than gleaning more support from the aforementioned advance in oil, as the former retreats to circa 9.5900 and latter to around 10.5000 vs the Eur.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/EUR/CAD</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed vs the Usd, as Cable recovers from pre-Easter lows to retest the 1.3000 level after holding above the 200 DMA (1.2966) and shrugging off heightened pressure on UK PM May as Parliament returns from its recess. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy remains capped just ahead of 112.00 within a 111.97-66 range and decent option expiry interest between 111.50-65 and 111.90-112.00 (1.1 bn either side). Note also, reported Japanese import and investor bids above 111.50 and the 200 DMA (111.51) may be curtailing a more concerted pull-back. Expiries could be impacting Eur/Usd as well given 2.3 bn rolling off from 1.1250 to 1.1260, while the Loonie is pivoting 1.3350 in the run up to Wednesday’s BoC policy meeting and press conference from Poloz and Wilkins – full preview of the event available on the Research Suite (along with a BoJ primer for Thursday).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Most regional currencies are on the back foot vs the Dollar, as noted above, but the Rand is also factoring in renewed concerns about SA’s Eskom in wake of reports that the Government had to bail out the company to the tune of Zar 5bn to avert non-payment and a call on state guarantees – Usd/Zar currently at 14.1900+ vs sub-14.1500 at one stage.</p>",

Moreover, Bunds are not deriving much traction from a more pronounced downturn in BTPs amidst more coalition wrangling in Rome that looks set to delay the unveiling of Italy’s growth plan until next week. Instead, the core Eurozone bond seems focused on the latest ratchet up in oil prices and taking heed of another ECB member downplaying the prospect of tiered deposits, at this stage – Coeure.

ASX 200 (+0.8%) was led higher by the energy sector after crude prices rallied around 3% to 6-month highs and NZX 50 (+0.6%) topped the 10K level for the first time ever, while Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) failed to hold on to early gains and stumbled from the weight of a firmer currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) were subdued after PBoC inaction resulted to a net liquidity drain of CNY 40bln which pushed the Overnight SHIBOR higher by over 27bps and with Hong Kong tentative amid resistance ahead of the 30K level and as its reflected on the recent mainland underperformance on return from its 4-day closure. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat after having recovered from earlier weakness as risk sentiment in Tokyo soured, while weaker results at today’s 2yr JGB auction also ensured price action was drab.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed with sentiment somewhat deteriorating from the mostly positive close in US, where the energy sector surged after the US decided to end Iranian oil sanction waivers but with gains in the broader market capped ahead of this week’s heavy slate of earnings. ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are mixed with Australia led higher by the energy sector after crude prices rallied around 3% to 6-month highs, while the Japanese benchmark failed to hold on to early gains and stumbled from the weight of a firmer currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) are subdued as PBoC inaction resulted to a net liquidity drain of CNY 40bln and with Hong Kong reacting to the recent mainland underperformance on return from its 4-day closure.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback is slightly firmer overnight following the mild bear-steepening in the yield curve during the prior session and as most major counterparts are subdued. As such. EUR/USD is on the backfoot but with losses limited by a large option expiry of EUR 1.9bln at 1.1250 for today’s New York cut, while GBP/USD languishes beneath 1.3000 as it braces itself for the resumption of Parliament and amid reports 1922 Committee Chairman Brady is to meet the PM May this week to set a timeline for her departure. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses slipped to take out the prior day’s lows as price action began to pick up from the Easter lull and antipodeans were softer with AUD/USD dampened following the recent slip from its 200DMA, as well as ongoing consensus for looser RBA policy later in the year but with downside stemmed by the oil price surge.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively flat after having recovered from earlier weakness as risk sentiment in Tokyo soured, while focus shifts to a 2yr JGB auction later.</p>",
