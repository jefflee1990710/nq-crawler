The desk is also monitoring how the virus will impact the flow of trade through major shipping routes (see below). The data slate didn’t inspire any great confidence, particularly the Chicago Fed, which printed beneath all expectations, although analysts do cite some idiosyncratic factors why it was not consistent with the better tone seen in other regional surveys (see below). Fed’s Clarida made an appearance in the afternoon, though stuck to the script. Equities were red (S&amp;P 500 flat for the year), though the NDX fared better after decent earnings from AMZN. Yields were lower across the Treasury curve, which bull-flattened; most of the action was in the front part of the curve. In FX, the USD saw downside on month-end rebalancing factors, with JPY and GBP notably benefiting. XAU added about 12 bucks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>The Panama Canal authority said that vessels arriving in the waters that have travelled through countries with confirmed coronavirus cases must announce this beforehand; analysts have noted that this would be a bearish development. While there is no sign that authorities have stopped ships just yet, some estimate that 6% of global trade passes through the canal, and a large part of that will be from China; the US is the second largest user. Meanwhile, news flow generally focussed on the increasing number of cases which has now exceeded that of SARS in 2003, with confirmed cases in the UK as well, which lent downside into European equity trading in the morning; additionally, in a sign of market jitters, there was some further risk-off in the afternoon, as some organisations erroneously reported cases in New York. Meanwhile, UAL, DAL and AAL announced suspension of flights to China on virus fears; and some reports have suggested that President Trump is mulling tighter China travel restrictions. In late trade, during the press conference US Health Secretary Azar declared the coronavirus as a public health emergency in the US, although the CDC director emphasised many times that the risk to US citizens is low. The officials also announced further measures to help counteract the coronavirus, where those who return from the Hubei province will be quarantined for 14 days, and foreign nationals who pose a risk will be denied entry, unless they are immediate family of citizens. Also, from Sunday, incoming flights from China will be limited to seven airports.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* PERSONAL INCOME, SPENDING, PCE (JAN):</strong> Personal income came in at +0.2% M/M, short of the 0.3% estimate; consumption was +0.3% (in line with expectations). Oxford Economics said that while consumer confidence remains elevated, they showed increased caution at the end of the year amid lingering trade uncertainty and moderating income growth. \"Importantly, part of the strength in nominal income and outlays emanated from a 0.3% and 0.2% increase in headline and core PCE prices, while real disposable income fell 0.1% on the month while real consumer spending was tepid at 0.1%.\" The consultancy says that price pressures remained tame at year-end despite headline [PCE] inflation firming 0.2ppt to 1.6% Y/Y and core inflation rising 0.1ppt to 1.6% Y/Y. \"With the Fed strongly committed to returning inflation to the 2% target, this persistent inflation undershoot will likely lead to another Fed cut in June 2020,\" OxEco writes, \"consumer spending has shielded the economy from global headwinds for most of 2019 but some signs of cracks in the consumer’s armour have appeared.\" It also says that while consumer spending will remain a key contributor to economic activity in 2020, it expects consumer outlays to decelerate gently to the slowest pace in seven years as income growth moderates.\"</p><p><strong>* CHICAGO PMI (JAN):</strong> The headline came in below the forecast range, printing 42.9 (expected 48.8, range 47.0-51.0). Analysts note that the data was driven by Boeing, which is based in Chicago, and the suspension of 737 Max. Pantheon notes that most other Fed regional survey strengthened markedly in January, so the data from the Chicago PMI is an outlier. Pantheon says that, adding these data to its ISM model, and allowing for recent errors due to the absence of monthly surveys from China-sensitive west coast states, generates a forecast of about 49.0, up from 47.2 in December. \"Manufacturing is still very weak, but it appears not to be weakening further on a national scale.\"</p><p><strong>* CANADA GDP (NOV):</strong> Canadian GDP growth rose by 0.1% M/M in November, against expectations of a flat reading, and a previous -0.1% M/M. Canadian bank RBC said the data offers little change the narrative that the Canadian economy stagnated in Q4, and the BOC's +0.3% forecast for the quarter still looks reasonable. The bank suggests that transitory factors were in play in November (namely the transport sector suffering from labour disruptions, and pipeline outages) - that drag should be reversed in December, RBC says, though the transportation industry is now facing further challenges with some airlines cancelling flights to China amid the coronavirus outbreak. \"While it's difficult to untangle the myriad transitory factors that impacted growth in the second half of last year, we think it's fair to say that Canada's economy geared down over that period, and particularly in Q4/19,\" and adds that \"as BoC Governor Poloz said last week, that has opened the door to a rate cut.\" The upshot is that the BOC meeting in March is now 'live', though the November GDP data does not warrant any urgent action.</p><p><strong>* EZ CPI (JAN) &amp; EZ GDP (Q4):</strong> The flash CPI headline for January printed at 1.4%, ticking up from the prior of 1.3% and in-line with forecasts. However, the core and “super core” metrics missed forecasts at 1.3% (Exp. 1.4%) and 1.1% (Exp 1.2%) respectively. Energy prices have been the main driver for the rise in January, predominantly on the gains during the heightened geopolitical tensions earlier this month, albeit that effect is likely to be fleeting as prices pulled back to fresh 2020 lows as coronavirus concerns weigh on the complex. From a Central Bank perspective, the ECB are likely to be concerned by the ongoing subdued prints in the core figures. Meanwhile, EZ GDP figures printed showed QQ growth softer than forecasts, with France and Italy both printing surprise contractions. “The strikes and protests in France seem to have had a bigger impact on economic activity than expected, while the fall in Italian GDP is a concern in an economy struggling to stay above water over the past two years.” analysts at Lloyds say. All-in-all, markets saw little sustained reaction at the time, potentially on the overshadowing macro theme.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed Vice Chair Clarida (voter) largely stuck to the script, stating that the US economy was in a good place, with solid growth, and stable inflation; policy settings were appropriate, he said. Clarida believes that the 2019 rate cuts will feed through the economy, and inflation will get back to 2%. On the labour market, the Fed vice chair said there was uncertainty about what level full employment is, and Fed was willing to probe how low unemployment can go. On the recent virus outbreak, Clarida noted the uncertainty, but said it was too soon to assess full impact, and the Fed was looking how it impacts China growth, and how that spreads to World growth and US growth. On yields, Clarida said the inversion may be driven by global uncertainty; he was not currently concerned about recent inversions in 3m/10-year and 2s5s curves. He said that a \"material change\" in the outlook does not entail just one indicator, but factors that would change the outlook for achieving the Fed's dual mandate; one to two quarter slowdown in growth would not be a reason to act. Clarida was also confident that the US consumer has never been in better shape.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -1.8% at 3225, NDX -1.6% at 8992, DJI -2.1% at 28,255. <strong>Sectors:</strong> Consumer discretionary +0.8%, utilities -0.5%, consumer staples -1.1%, telecoms -1.3%, communication services -1.6%, health care -2%, financials -2%, materials -2.2%, industrials -2.3%, IT -2.7%, -3.2%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> led gains today rising over 10% at the open, before paring slightly, but remaining above USD 1trln market cap following top and bottom line beats and firmer than expected revenue metrics in its key units, including its key AWS unit. Amazon led to strong gains in consumer discretionary despite all other sectors heavily in the red, although losses were less pronounced in the defensive sectors (XLU, XLP), given the risk environment. <strong>Caterpillar (CAT)</strong> saw choppy trade in the pre-market however ultimately opened lower and despite an initial pull back shortly after the open, succumbed to the broader equity sell off and traded almost 3% lower. CAT reported a beat on EPS, although revenues missed expectations. Its three-month rolling machine sales for the end of 2019 were also weak with declines across the board: World -5%, NA -4%, APAC -5%, and LATAM -12%. On the outlook, CAT highlighted it expected continued global economic uncertainty to pressure sales to users in 2020 and cause dealers to further reduce its inventories. The cautious commentary was accompanied by FY20 EPS guidance of USD 9.25 (mid-point), lower than the street’s USD 10.55 estimate. Energy heavyweights <strong>Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX)</strong> both traded with losses of over 4% where the former missed on EPS, and the latter on revenue. In terms of energy specific commentary, XOM saw net production of crude, nat gas, bitumen and synthetic oil at 2.436mln BPD, increasing from 2.348mln BPD, in line with expectations. Whereas CVX noted its global production of oil-equivalent was unchanged at 3.08mln BPD (exp. 3.111mln) and FY20 production growth is forecasted to rise by 3%. The heavy losses combined with the continued fall in energy prices saw Energy underperform, with the sector trading with losses of 3%. Elsewhere, <strong>Visa (V)</strong> also in negative territory today after earnings whilst also suffering from the broader equity sell off. Visa (V) EPS and revenues were both in line with street estimates, however it highlighted 2020 revenues will be hit by the incentives it is offering to banking clients, whilst it also highlighted its client incentives increased 20% taking it to USD 1.75bln.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> <strong>IBM (IBM)</strong> performed well following a CEO change, where Arvind Krishna, who is currently serving as Senior VP for Cloud and Cognitive software, and was a key figure in the RedHat acquisition, will take the helm at the company. WWE (WWE) fell over 20% after an executive shake up, where its CFO and co-presidents left the company, and would not be acting as advisories on the board of directors. Elsewhere, Muddywaters announced it is short Luckin Coffee (LK) after receiving an 89-page report alleging the company is a fraud. However, Citron research later announced it is long the stock, citing calls to confirm its financials and that its China business ‘fire’ business in China.</p><p><strong>* WTI SETTLES USD 0.58 LOWER AT USD 51.56/BBL; BRENT (J0) SETTLES USD 0.71 LOWER AT USD 56.62/BBL</strong>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crude oil benchmarks lost around a buck each to end the week – marking the fourth consecutive week of losses - on further risk aversion due to lacklustre data on both sides of the pond and month-end factors. Front month futures have been flirting with their October lows, 50.99 for WTI and 56.15 for Brent (note Brent March ’19 futures expire on Friday), where prices violently reversed their Saudi Aramco/Abqaiq attack spike higher. Prices found their peak in the Asia session before trundling lower in sympathy with other risk assets, disappointing EZ inflation data and a dismal Chicago PMI exacerbated the move. There was a short-lived rally in the latter part of the session after the Russian Energy Minister, Novak, announced the OPEC+ heavyweight is looking to come on board with a move forward of the March OPEC+ meeting to, some yet to be determined, early February date, citing the coronavirus’ potential impact on oil demand as the catalyst; note, Russia has typically been tentative in regard to extending/deepening production cuts. Nonetheless, the selling recommenced shortly after the Russian announcement through till settlement. Meanwhile, the latest Baker Hughes US rig count showed oil rigs -1 at 675 (the first cut in three weeks), natgas rigs -3 at 112 and total rigs -4 at 790; a Reuters survey showed that OPEC compliance is seen at 133% in January (vs. 158% in December) and output is seen falling 640k BPD M/M to 28.35mln BPD on Libya unrest, Ecuador exit, and new supply curve deal.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLED 11 TICKS HIGHER AT 131-21:</strong> Treasuries have rallied this week, with yields on 2s, 5s, 10s plunging by around 17bps, and 30s falling by around 13bps - crucially slipping sub-2.00% briefly on Friday, as fears over the impact of the Coronavirus persist. The shape of the curve is mixed on a weekly view, with 2s5s and 2s10s narrowing, the former inverting this week. 2s30s widened by around 4bps, as has 10s30s, while 5s30s is around 5bps wider. At settlement, 30s had managed to keep their head above 2.00%, but there is now fresh attention on the 10-year yield, which is within a whisker of the 1.50% handle. Meanwhile, the EFFR on Thursday rose to 1.60% following the Fed's hike to the IOER rate, helping to guide it towards the midpoint of the FFR's target range. Next week, bond traders will be focussing on the Treasuries quarterly refunding announcement, and in particular, details around the announced 20-year issuance.</p><p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>USD:</strong> The ongoing spread of China’s coronavirus, rising number of confirmed cases and lives sadly lost has dominated market sentiment and dictated currency moves for the most part, but downgrades to the Fed’s assessment of private consumption and inflation vis-a-vis target also contributed to the Dollar’s pull-back from best levels vs most G10 rivals. In fact, the DXY slipped to fresh lows for the week on Friday and back under opening levels within a 98.191-97.392 range, and looks technically bearish below the big figure and a major Fib (50% retracement from 2019 peak to Q4 trough at 98.011) against the backdrop of markedly softer US Treasury yields and curve re-flattening, not to mention an even more contractionary Chicago PMI (albeit partly grounded by Boeing) and mild/strong sell signals for month end rebalancing.</p><p><strong>* MAJORS:</strong> Contrasting fortunes for the rest of the G10 with a pretty distinct demarcation between safe havens and high beta or risk sensitive types, even though the mood surrounding China’s global health emergency was not always bad given WHO acknowledgement that vaccines could be ready for human consumption soon and other efforts to contain the outbreak mean that the tide could turn. However, the commodity bloc has suffered alongside underlying crude and base metal prices, with the Aussie sliding through several chart supports vs its US counterpart on its way towards last year’s 0.6671 low within a 0.6838-0.6684 band and only holding up against its NZ neighbour in cross terms by virtue of the fact that the Kiwi also sharply underperformed vs the Greenback. Indeed, Nzd/Usd slumped from 0.6600+ to almost 0.6450 even though RBNZ easing expectations continued to pare back and the Government unveiled a hefty infrastructure spending package, while Aud/Usd only derived transient traction from firmer than forecast Q4 CPI that coupled with an upbeat labour report also prompted a dial down of RBA rate cut/QE calls. On that note, the Loonie is nursing some losses between 1.3245-3145 parameters, but has not recaptured a key technical level (200 DMA at 1.3229) convincingly in wake of Canadian monthly GDP and PPI that both eclipsed consensus or comments from BoC’s Beaudry downplaying the efficacy/necessity of rate cut after the door to looser policy was pushed open last week. On the flip side, the Yen, Franc and Euro are all on course to end the week with hefty net gains vs the Dollar, with Usd/Jpy hovering just above the base of 108.35-109.26 extremes, Usd/Chf nearer 0.9640 than 0.9767 and Eur/Chf closer to the bottom of a 1.0666-1.0737 range even though the single currency has rallied to 1.1090 from just shy of 1.1000 at one stage. Note, Eur/Usd did not really respond to mixed Eurozone data, either way, or Italian political developments that boosted BTPs on the basis of a more stable coalition Government as the headline pair tracked broad swings in risk appetite-aversion and Dollar moves inversely.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> The Pound has been something of an outlier, and certainly an independent mover on UK specifics in the run up to and following the BoE’s January policy gathering. In short, rate cut probability was flitting around 50% just ahead of the MPC pronouncement from as much as 80% before several upbeat macro releases that offset bleak ONS retail sales, GDP and benign inflation, but despite dovish-leaning rhetoric beyond the 2 resident 25 bp ease dissenters, Governor Carney, Tenreyro and Vleighe all opted to stand pat again. Moreover, the former underlined a neutral/2-way stance in his last presser and odds on a rate cut for March were ramped up accordingly as Cable rebounded over 2 full points from sub-1.3000 lows and Eur/Gbp recoiled to circa 0.8390 compared to 0.8488 or so at the other end of the spectrum.</p><p><strong>* SCANDI/EM:</strong> It’s been a bad week at the office for the Norwegian and Swedish Krona on a combination of mainly risk-off flows, bearish technicals and the aforementioned slide in oil, but EM currencies have been hit even harder with some additional factors weighing on the Lira, Rand and Rouble amongst others (including geopolitical jitters, more SAA and Eskom problems and Brent’s demise alongside WTI). Meanwhile, the Yuan has reversed from around 6.9300 to just under 7.0000 awaiting the return of Chinese markets from the already extended Lunar New Year holidays that could yet be delayed further, but is primed to see significant catch-up/corrective trade given such big moves elsewhere in their absence – see our headline feed for a more detailed outlook on the re-open and potential viral contagion.</p>",

The shape of the curve is mixed on a weekly view, with 2s5s and 2s10s narrowing, the former inverting this week. 2s30s widened by around 4bps, as has 10s30s, while 5s30s is around 5bps wider. At settlement, 30s had managed to keep their head above 2.00%, but there is now fresh attention on the 10-year yield, which is within a whisker of the 1.50% handle. Meanwhile, the EFFR on Thursday rose to 1.60% following the Fed's hike to the IOER rate, helping to guide it towards the midpoint of the FFR's target range. Next week, bond traders will be focussing on the Treasuries quarterly refunding announcement, and in particular, details around the announced 20-year issuance.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li>The crude oil benchmarks lost around a buck each to end the week – marking the fourth consecutive week of losses - on further risk aversion due to lacklustre data on both sides of the pond and month-end factors. Front month futures have been flirting with their October lows, 50.99 for WTI and 56.15 for Brent (note Brent March ’19 futures expire on Friday), where prices violently reversed their Saudi Aramco/Abqaiq attack spike higher. Prices found their peak in the Asia session before trundling lower in sympathy with other risk assets, disappointing EZ inflation data and a dismal Chicago PMI exacerbated the move. There was a short-lived rally in the latter part of the session after the Russian Energy Minister, Novak, announced the OPEC+ heavyweight is looking to come on board with a move forward of the March OPEC+ meeting to, some yet to be determined, early February date, citing the coronavirus’ potential impact on oil demand as the catalyst; note, Russia has typically been tentative in regard to extending/deepening production cuts. Nonetheless, the selling recommenced shortly after the Russian announcement through till settlement. Meanwhile, the latest Baker Hughes US rig count showed oil rigs -1 at 675 (the first cut in three weeks), natgas rigs -3 at 112 and total rigs -4 at 790; a Reuters survey showed that OPEC compliance is seen at 133% in January (vs. 158% in December) and output is seen falling 640k BPD M/M to 28.35mln BPD on Libya unrest, Ecuador exit, and new supply curve deal.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: more Chinese contamination, a ‘dovish’ FOMC and ‘hawkish’ BoE",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The ongoing spread of China’s coronavirus, rising number of confirmed cases and lives sadly lost has dominated market sentiment and dictated currency moves for the most part, but downgrades to the Fed’s assessment of private consumption and inflation vis-a-vis target also contributed to the Dollar’s pull-back from best levels vs most G10 rivals. In fact, the <strong>DXY</strong> slipped to fresh lows for the week on Friday and back under opening levels within a 98.191-97.392 range, and looks technically bearish below the big figure and a major Fib (50% retracement from 2019 peak to Q4 trough at 98.011) against the backdrop of markedly softer US Treasury yields and curve re-flattening, not to mention an even more contractionary Chicago PMI (albeit partly grounded by Boeing) and mild/strong sell signals for month end rebalancing.</p><p><strong>MAJORS</strong></p><p>Contrasting fortunes for the rest of the G10 with a pretty distinct demarcation between safe havens and high beta or risk sensitive types, even though the mood surrounding China’s global health emergency was not always bad given WHO acknowledgement that vaccines could be ready for human consumption soon and other efforts to contain the outbreak mean that the tide could turn. However, the commodity bloc has suffered alongside underlying crude and base metal prices, with the Aussie sliding through several chart supports vs its US counterpart on its way towards last year’s 0.6671 low within a 0.6838-0.6684 band and only holding up against its NZ neighbour in cross terms by virtue of the fact that the Kiwi also sharply underperformed vs the Greenback. Indeed, Nzd/Usd slumped from 0.6600+ to almost 0.6450 even though RBNZ easing expectations continued to pare back and the Government unveiled a hefty infrastructure spending package, while Aud/Usd only derived transient traction from firmer than forecast Q4 CPI that coupled with an upbeat labour report also prompted a dial down of RBA rate cut/QE calls. On that note, the Loonie is nursing some losses between 1.3245-3145 parameters, but has not recaptured a key technical level (200 DMA at 1.3229) convincingly in wake of Canadian monthly GDP and PPI that both eclipsed consensus or comments from BoC’s Beaudry downplaying the efficacy/necessity of rate cut after the door to looser policy was pushed open last week.</p><p>On the flip side, the Yen, Franc and Euro are all on course to end the week with hefty net gains vs the Dollar, with Usd/Jpy hovering just above the base of 108.35-109.26 extremes, Usd/Chf nearer 0.9640 than 0.9767 and Eur/Chf closer to the bottom of a 1.0666-1.0737 range even though the single currency has rallied to 1.1090 from just shy of 1.1000 at one stage. Note, Eur/Usd did not really respond to mixed Eurozone data, either way, or Italian political developments that boosted BTPs on the basis of a more stable coalition Government as the headline pair tracked broad swings in risk appetite-aversion and Dollar moves inversely.</p><p>The Pound has been something of an outlier, and certainly an independent mover on UK specifics in the run up to and following the BoE’s January policy gathering. In short, rate cut probability was flitting around 50% just ahead of the MPC pronouncement from as much as 80% before several upbeat macro releases that offset bleak ONS retail sales, GDP and benign inflation, but despite dovish-leaning rhetoric beyond the 2 resident 25 bp ease dissenters, Governor Carney, Tenreyro and Vleighe all opted to stand pat again. Moreover, the former underlined a neutral/2-way stance in his last presser and odds on a rate cut for March were ramped up accordingly as Cable rebounded over 2 full points from sub-1.3000 lows and Eur/Gbp recoiled to circa 0.8390 compared to 0.8488 or so at the other end of the spectrum.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM</strong></p><p>It’s been a bad week at the office for the Norwegian and Swedish Krona on a combination of mainly risk-off flows, bearish technicals and the aforementioned slide in oil, but EM currencies have been hit even harder with some additional factors weighing on the Lira, Rand and Rouble amongst others (including geopolitical jitters, more SAA and Eskom problems and Brent’s demise alongside WTI). Meanwhile, the Yuan has reversed from around 6.9300 to just under 7.0000 awaiting the return of Chinese markets from the already extended Lunar New Year holidays that could yet be delayed further, but is primed to see significant catch-up/corrective trade given such big moves elsewhere in their absence – see our headline feed for a more detailed outlook on the re-open and potential viral contagion.</p>",

The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern but also stated that there has been progress made in developing a vaccine and believes measures taken by China \"will reverse the tide\", while it opposed any measures or restrictions on travel or trade to China. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.1%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (+1.0%)</strong> followed suit to the Wall St rebound with outperformance seen in Australia’s tech and healthcare sectors, while sentiment in Tokyo was underpinned by favourable currency flows and with the biggest stock gainers driven by earnings releases. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.5%)</strong> initially conformed to the early stock market rebound but then steadily wiped out the gains as coronavirus infections and deaths continued to expand, while Chinese PMI data was inconclusive in which Manufacturing PMI printed in-line with estimates at the 50.0 benchmark level and Non-Manufacturing PMI topped expectations at 54.1 vs. Exp. 53.0, although the Stats Bureau noted this was taken based on data on January 20th and therefore doesn’t fully reflect the impact from the coronavirus outbreak.

The Aussie gleaned scant impetus from mixed Chinese PMIs overnight, supposedly large expiry related hedging at the big figure or the so called ‘soft’ WHO classification of the deadly Chinese disease as a health emergency of international concern in recognition of the strenuous efforts to contain the outbreak and cure the growing number of those contaminated.

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound remains relatively firm, but off best levels forged in the aftermath of super Thursday amidst positive month end vibes via a German bank flagging stock-hedge demand vs the Dollar and Franc in particular, albeit with the bulk of the buying anticipated from 3 to 4 pm London time. Cable reached 1.3140 or so before topping out and Eur/Gbp crossed 0.8400 to circa 0.8387 at one stage before Sterling lost some momentum in tandem with, if not specifically on reports of 2 confirmed cases of China’s coronavirus in the UK.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>The clear G10 underperformers and extending losses against the Greenback and Euro respectively, as Aud/Usd recoils further from fairly restrained recovery highs through the 0.6700 level to expose the 2019 low (0.6671). The Aussie gleaned scant impetus from mixed Chinese PMIs overnight, supposedly large expiry related hedging at the big figure or the so called ‘soft’ WHO classification of the deadly Chinese disease as a health emergency of international concern in recognition of the strenuous efforts to contain the outbreak and cure the growing number of those contaminated. Similarly, Nzd/Usd has plumbed deeper below 0.6500 towards 0.6450, ignoring more theoretically supportive Kiwi impulses via Westpac upgrading its RBNZ policy views to a possible shift from easing to neutral at the February meeting. Meanwhile, the Scandi Kronas continue to weaken on bearish fundamentals, techs and broad risk sentiment that has also scuppered a pretty tame rebound in crude prices.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The Loonie derived enough leverage from hawkish sounding BoC rhetoric to regain 1.3200+ status vs its US counterpart, but the Beaudry reservations about looser policy have already lost impact with Usd/Cad breaching the 200 DMA that had been capping rallies and now eyeing 1.3250 ahead of 1.3270 that represents December 6’s peak. However, impending Canadian GDP and perhaps even PPI could provide some independent direction.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In keeping with recent trends, underlying safe haven buying has helped the Franc, Yen and Euro to an extent (not to mention Gold) limit declines vs the Buck during periods of improved risk appetite, as Usd/Chf and Usd/Jpy stay tethered to 0.9700 and 109.00 anchors, while Eur/Usd repels attempts to break decisively below 1.1000 despite weak Eurozone data. Note, also mild to strong Dollar selling signals for month end may also be a factor as the <strong>DXY</strong> struggles to keep sight of 98.000 and threatens to close under a key chart level at 98.011 (50% Fib retracement of pull-back from 99.967 to 96.355 in Q4 last year).</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>No real or lasting respite for regional currencies even though the Yuan is keeping afloat above 7.0000, as SA’s Eskom warns about more power outages and wants to discuss a strategy with the Government to meet financial obligations. Usd/Zar now nudging up close to 14.9000 as a result.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*OVERVIEW:</strong> Mainland Chinese stock markets are poised to open on February 3rd following its annual Lunar New Year holiday - which was extended on account of the coronavirus outbreak, and in an attempt to slow down the spread of the pathogen.</p><p><strong>*THE LATEST:</strong> China announced that the confirmed number of coronavirus cases increased to 9692 (Prev. 7711) and total deaths at 213 (Prev. 170). Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) verified the first human to human transmission of coronavirus in the US, to bring total number of cases in US to 6 (Prev. 5), in which the new patient is the spouse of the Chicago woman who brought the infection back from Wuhan</p><p><strong>*WHO’S VERDICT:</strong> World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in which the decision was near unanimous although it did not recommend limiting trade and movement due to the China outbreak and noted the greatest concern is for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems. Furthermore, WHO said there has been progress made in developing a vaccine and believes measures taken by China \"will reverse the tide\". Participants digested this a as a “soft announcement” which provided markets with some short-term relief at least.</p><p><strong>*CATCH-UP PLAY:</strong> Using Hong Kong and Taiwan as proxies, Shanghai and Shenzhen markets look set to open with significantly steep losses. The Hang Seng fell over 5% in the two days after its extended break, while the Taiex saw its worst open since late-2018, and the FTSE China A50 futures trimmed ~6% since the last trading day in the Mainland.</p><p>Mainland China abandoned circuit breaks in onshore equities following major declines in 2015. Stocks trading on the main boards are permitted to fluctuate 10% intraday on either side of break-even. Desks note that investors find it hard to hedge positions in onshore markets amid the lack of index futures, volatility products and single stock options.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Pre-market prices for Shanghai are released at 09:25am Beijing time (01:25GMT) with Cash open at 09:30am (01:30GMT)</i></p><p><strong>In terms of sector focus:</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Commodity</strong> stocks will bear the brunt of the W/W declines across the oil and base metal complexes</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Airline</strong> names are likely to see effects amid numerous flight cancellations and isolations in the region</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Luxury</strong> and <strong>gambling</strong> names will have to face the prospect of lower demand as tourist numbers fall</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Financials</strong> will be opening to a lower-yield environment vs. Jan 23rd</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Healthcare</strong> names may see support amid heightening demand for drugs and due to the sector’s defensive nature</p><p><strong>Metals:</strong> Shanghai Iron ore, steel and coking coal futures are seen declining upon Mainland’s return as the contracts are likely to align themselves with price action in the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and London Metal Exchange (LME) over the past week.</p><p><strong>Bonds:</strong> Yields on Chinese bonds are likely to fall in synchrony to Western core bond markets.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*CHINA INTERVENTION:</strong></p><p>Unsurprisingly, participants expect Beijing to take steps to stem losses. The PBoC has said that the Central Bank will offer abundant liquidity after the Lunar New Year Holiday through Open Market Operations. Additionally, Chinese government stated that it is to study and implement tax and financial support policies to mitigate effects of the coronavirus outbreak. In terms of other interventions to lookout for:</p><p><strong>PBOC CNY FIXING:</strong> Since Mainland’s New Year departure from the market, the Yuan briefly surpassed the 7.00 mark vs. the Dollar for the first time since late-December amid the implications of the outbreak on the Chinese economy. The PBoC’s last USD/CNY fix stood at 6.8876; some desks note that the Chinese Central Bank may set a firmer-than-expected fix for the CNY to provide markets with some reprieve.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Yuan fixing occurs at 09:15am Beijing Time (01:15GMT) with onshore (CNY) trading commencing at 09:30am (01:30GMT)</i></p><p><strong>OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS (OMO):</strong> China will experience the largest single day maturity in almost four years upon its return, with some CNY 1tln of Central Bank funding due. Traders expect the Central Bank to roll over some of the funds. As mentioned above, the PBoC stated that it will ensure ample liquidity using tools, including open market operations.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Details of OMO are seen at 09:15am Beijing Time (01:15GMT)</i></p><p><strong>OTHER FORMS:</strong> Aside from the above, Chinese state funds are widely expected to buy stocks to stem the downside in cash markets via the government’s influence.</p>",

In related news, Italy confirmed they are suspending all China flights after coronavirus cases were confirmed in Italy, while a plane carrying UK citizens in Wuhan departed earlier and it was also reported that the UK Chief Medical Officer raised the national risk level to moderate from low due to the coronavirus. (Newswires)</p><p>ASIA-PAC</p><p><strong>Asian equity markets traded mixed as early relief rolled over from US following a \"soft\" declaration by the WHO on coronavirus </strong>and with US equity futures also underpinned by after-market earnings including Amazon – whose shares rose almost 10% after-hours. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern but also stated that there has been progress made in developing a vaccine and believes measures taken by China \"will reverse the tide\", while it opposed any measures or restrictions on travel or trade to China. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.1%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (+1.1%)</strong> followed suit to the Wall St rebound with outperformance seen in Australia’s tech and healthcare sectors, while sentiment in Tokyo was underpinned by favourable currency flows and with the biggest stock gainers driven by earnings releases. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.1%)</strong> initially conformed to the early stock market rebound but then steadily wiped out the gains as coronavirus infections and deaths continued to expand, while Chinese PMI data was inconclusive in which Manufacturing PMI printed in-line with estimates at the 50.0 benchmark level and Non-Manufacturing PMI topped expectations at 54.1 vs. Exp. 53.0, although the Stats Bureau noted this was taken based on data on January 20th and therefore doesn’t fully reflect the impact from the coronavirus outbreak. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively uneventful and held on to the prior day’s gains but with further upside limited amid the broad improvement in risk sentiment and overnight retreat in T-notes.</p><p><strong>Chinese Manufacturing PMI (Jan) 50.0 vs. Exp. 50.0 (Prev. 50.2). (Newswires) Chinese Non-Manufacturing PMI (Jan) 54.1 vs. Exp. 53.0 (Prev. 53.5)</strong> Chinese Composite PMI (Jan) 53.0 (Prev. 53.4) <strong>China National Bureau of Statistics noted the January PMI data does not fully reflect impact of coronavirus </strong>and future trend needs to be observed, with the figures said to reflect data as of January 20th.

(Times) <i>This is in-fitting with PM Johnson spokesperson comments on Monday 20th who stated that once the UK leaves the EU, there will be no equivalence and the UK is seeking a Canada-style deal with no alignment.</i></p><p><strong>NEC Director Kudlow said he is not concerned Congress could derail a trade deal between the UK and US over the Huawei decision</strong>, while he added that no decision has been made on whether to curtail intelligence sharing with the UK regarding the decision. (Newswires)</p><p>UK GfK Consumer Confidence (Jan) -9.0 vs. Exp. -9.0 (Prev. -11.0). (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY</strong> remained below 98.00 after recent losses which were predominantly caused by strength in its major counterparts and not helped by softer than expected US Core PCE prices which accompanied the inline Q4 Advance GDP data. <strong>EUR/USD</strong> and <strong>GBP/USD</strong> were steady and held on to the prior day’s gains with the latter testing the 1.3100 level to the upside following an unwinding of dovish bets post-BoE, while <strong>CAD</strong> also took a swipe at the Greenback following comments by BoC’s Beaudry who pushed back against the allure of a rate cut once growth risk was factored in. Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY-crosses</strong> were marginally supported by the improved risk tone but with price action limited amid tepid Tokyo CPI and Industrial Production data. <strong>Antipodeans</strong> traded indecisive after the ambiguous Chinese PMI data with <strong>AUD/USD</strong> choppy near 0.6700 and <strong>NZD/USD</strong> languished sub-0.6500 handle despite a recent note by Westpac which sees the RBNZ shifting to a neutral bias on the OCR at next month’s meeting.</p><p><strong>BoC's Deputy Governor Beaudry said even if a rate cut seems desirable in the short-term, the cut may no longer be attractive once the Bank has factored in growth risk</strong> and that even if macroprudential policy is best suited to ensure the resilience of the financial system, it doesn't mean it is capable in eliminating all risks associated with financial vulnerability. (Newswires)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were driven by the risk appetite with oil prices underpinned following the softer-than-expected World Health Organization declaration regarding the coronavirus. This inspired a rebound in risk assets and pushed <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures higher by around 2% to above the USD 53.00/bbl level which then later acted as platform for prices. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> languished after the improved sentiment spurred a near USD 16/oz reversal for the precious metal, while <strong>copper</strong> prices mirrored the overnight reprieve and made several attempts on resistance around USD 2.55/lb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>GEOPOLITICS</p><p>US State Department tweeted comments from Secretary of State Pompeo that the Islamic Republic of Iran remains the world’s largest state sponsor of terror and work US has done to put pressure on their economy has reduced their capability to harm people. (Newswires)</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>The T-PLEX was firmer across the curve on Thursday, albeit off its highs into the settlement. Risk appetite was subdued throughout most of the session amid growing the growing coronavirus cases/deaths and mixed US Q4 GDP, although the WHO reversed sentiment after providing a \"soft\" emergency declaration, advising against trade and travel restrictions. By settlement, yields were approximately 3bps lower across the curve. US T-note (H0) settled 9+ ticks higher at 131-10.</p><p>US Senate Leader McConnell reportedly likely has votes to block witnesses in impeachment trial after Republican Senator Alexander said there was no need for more evidence in the Trump impeachment trial. There were also comments from US Republican Senator Collins who will vote for additional witnesses in the Trump impeachment trial and Republican Senator Murkowski who earlier suggested the dispute about material facts leans in favour of calling additional witnesses for Trump impeachment trial.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equity markets trade mostly positive as relief rolls over from US following a \"soft\" declaration by the WHO on coronavirus and with US equity futures also underpinned by after-market earnings including Amazon. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern but also stated that there has been progress made in developing a vaccine and believes measures taken by China \"will reverse the tide\", while it opposed any measures or restrictions on travel or trade to China. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) followed suit to the Wall St rebound with outperformance seen in Australia’s tech and healthcare sectors, while sentiment in Tokyo is underpinned by favourable currency flows and with the biggest stock gainers driven by earnings releases. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) conformed to the broad stock market rebound although is off its best levels as the number of infected and deaths continue to expand, while Chinese PMI data was inconclusive in which Manufacturing PMI printed inline with estimates at the 50.0 benchmark level and Non-Manufacturing PMI was better than expected at 54.1 vs. Exp. 53.0, although the stats bureau noted this was taken based on data on January 20th and therefore doesn’t fully reflect the impact from the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY trades flat below 98.00 after the recent losses which was predominantly caused by strength in its major counterparts and not helped by softer than expected US Core PCE prices which accompanied the inline Q4 GDP data. EUR/USD and GBP/USD are steady and hold on to the prior day’s gains with the latter testing the 1.3100 level to the upside following an unwinding of dovish bets post-BoE meeting in which the central bank kept rates unchanged through 7-2 vote and tweaked its hawkish policy guidance, while CAD also took a swipe at the greenback following comments by BoC’s Beaudry who pushed back against the allure of a rate cut once growth risk was factored in. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were marginally supported by the improved risk tone but with price action limited amid tepid Tokyo CPI and Industrial Production data releases. Antipodeans are indecisive after the ambiguous Chinese PMI data with AUD/USD choppy near 0.6700 and NZD/USD languishing sub-0.6500 handle despite a recent note by Westpac which sees the RBNZ shifting to a neutral bias on the OCR at next month’s meeting.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively uneventful and hold on to the prior day’s gains but with further upside limited amid the broad improvement in risk sentiment and subsequent pullback in T-notes.</p>",
