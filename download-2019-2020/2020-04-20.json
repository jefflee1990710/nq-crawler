(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Equities moved lower on Monday as the crude oil collapse feeds through to broader risk appetite. As has been heavily noted by us, the next macro catalyst requires more clarity over COVID, now that the pace of death tolls and case counts is easing. A staggered re-opening of economies (many parts of Europe will begin phased re-opening this week) is mitigating the possibility of the V-shape recovery theory, with a U-shape or L-shape now gaining in popularity. Additionally, progress on vaccines is crucial, as is more widespread testing, while there will be an eye on reinfections as economies re-open. One key factor is how quickly consumers’ behaviour returns to ‘normal’. With that said, many have found the Fed’s commercial paper programmes as a critical reason for the bull’s invigoration as credit vol trundles back towards normal levels, with some desks now calling for fresh record equity highs in the quarters ahead. More immediately, the crude complex influenced the broader narrative once again, as WTI futures, namely May contract, broke record price declines and printed negative prints for the first time. However, there seems to be an over (and misplaced) focus on the May contract, which expires this week - the open interest and volume last week switched into the June contract, and this is where the focus of participants is. SPX -1.82% at 2822, NDX -1.20% at 8727, DJIA -2.44% at 23,650.</p><p>The TPLEX modestly bull-flattened as the crude losses kept risk appetite at bay; by settlement, 2s were unchanged at 0.20%, 10s -3bps at 0.62%, 30s -5bps at -1.23%. The gains came mainly overnight as oil prices made their descent, although heading into the US session yields traded rangebound, with the 10-year yield swimming between 0.61-0.65%. Note, while front-month oil futures made record losses (and prices), the move in other assets, particularly USTs, were muted. Participants were unwilling to let yields fall lower, perhaps indicative of their collective view that near-term oil price fluctuations were temporary, rather than that of the beginning of a sustained disinflationary environment. At the same time, it is worth highlighting that pressure on yields were also likely muted as Fed has now pared its purchases to approximately USD 15bln per day from USD 30bln last week, and as one would expect, offer-to-cove ratios have elevated at the operations on Monday. Furthermore, a handful of corporate issuance to start the week gave participants more supply to digest. In the front-end, FRA-OIS spreads widened on Monday, with Fed data showing commercial paper rates remain elevated while the background of ramped up US CMBs and T-Bill issuance puts upward pressure on the complex. T-notes (M20) settled 7 ticks higher at 139-03+.</p><p>Crude futures, predominantly WTI, printed large losses to start the week. The decline was led by the WTI May contract (which expires at the close of business on Tuesday), which hit multi-decade lows and traded in negative territory for the first time ever, as expiry looms nearer in the face of a physical market that is over-encumbered with supply as demand faces obliteration in light of COVID-19. In essence, storage at the US settlement hub, Cushing, is filling at a rapid rate causing traders to baulk at the prospect of delivery, especially amid lockdown conditions. However, while eye-gorging figures in the May contract, futures trading has mainly rolled into the June contract by now, as evident by open interest and volume figures, where losses were relatively more contained, albeit still concerning. The May contract does, however, underscore the current woes in WTI; Citi, to wit, “we see risk that June WTI will face similar pressure to converge with the weaker cash market in turn, particularly as it’s trading at a moderate USD 4.30 discount to June Brent, not a wide enough arbitrage to stimulate US exports in our estimation.”</p>",

Expiries: WTI May Future.</p><h2>MARKET WRAP</h2><p>Equities moved lower on Monday as the crude oil collapse feeds through to broader risk appetite. As has been heavily noted by us, the next macro catalyst requires more clarity over COVID, now that the pace of death tolls and case counts is easing. A staggered re-opening of economies (many parts of Europe will begin phased re-opening this week) is mitigating the possibility of the V-shape recovery theory, with a U-shape or L-shape now gaining in popularity. Additionally, progress on vaccines is crucial, as is more widespread testing, while there will be an eye on reinfections as economies re-open. One key factor is how quickly consumers’ behaviour returns to ‘normal’. With that said, many have found the Fed’s commercial paper programmes as a critical reason for the bull’s invigoration as credit vol trundles back towards normal levels, with some desks now calling for fresh record equity highs in the quarters ahead. More immediately, the crude complex influenced the broader narrative once again, as WTI futures, namely May contract, broke record price declines and printed negative prints for the first time. However, there seems to be an over (and misplaced) focus on the May contract, which expires this week - the open interest and volume last week switched into the June contract, and this is where the focus of participants is.&nbsp;</p><h2>VIRUS CASE COUNT</h2><p><i><strong>Figures provided as of Monday (via state official health departments) against Sunday:</strong></i></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>US</strong> cases rise to 746,625 (prev. 720,630), death toll rises to 39,083 (prev. 37,202).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NEW YORK</strong> cases +1.9% at 247,512 (prev. +2.6% at 242,786), death toll +3.4% at 14,347 (prev. +3.8% at 13,869), new hospitalisations are around flat from prior days 1,384.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SPAIN</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ITALY </strong>cases +1.3% at 181,288 (Prev. +1.7% at 178,972); death toll +1.9% at 24,114 (Prev. +1.9% at 23,660).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>GERMANY </strong>coronavirus cases rose by 1775 to 141672 and death toll rose by 110 to 4404, according to the RKI Health Institute</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>FRANCE </strong>reports 6th consecutive day of declines in those hospitalised from COVID-19; death toll rises to 7,752 (prev. 7,649)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>UK </strong>death toll rises to 16,509 (prev. 16,060); deaths rise by 449 (+2.8%) vs. yesterday’s increase of 596 (+3.85%).</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>CANADA </strong>COVID-19 cases rise to 35,392 (prev. 33,922), death toll rises to 1,611 (prev. 1,506)</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 4.60 LOWER AT USD 20.43/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 2.51 LOWER AT USD 25.57/BBL. </strong>WTI (K0) settled USD 55.90 lower at USD -37.63/bbl</p><p>Crude futures, predominantly WTI, printed large losses to start the week. The decline was led by the WTI May contract (which expires at the close of business on Tuesday), which hit multi-decade lows and traded in negative territory for the first time ever, as expiry looms nearer in the face of a physical market that is over-encumbered with supply as demand faces obliteration in light of COVID-19. In essence, storage at the US settlement hub, Cushing, is filling at a rapid rate causing traders to baulk at the prospect of delivery, especially amid lockdown conditions. However, while eye-gorging figures in the May contract, futures trading has mainly rolled into the June contract by now, as evident by open interest and volume figures, where losses were relatively more contained, albeit still concerning. The May contract does, however, underscore the current woes in WTI; Citi, to wit, “we see risk that June WTI will face similar pressure to converge with the weaker cash market in turn, particularly as it’s trading at a moderate USD 4.30 discount to June Brent, not a wide enough arbitrage to stimulate US exports in our estimation.”</p><p><strong>USO:</strong> The low prices are enticing those less versed in the energy market. The major US Oil ETF (USO) recorded its largest-ever one day inflow of USD 552mln on Friday, also marking a record weekly inflow of USD 1.6bln; although such low prices may seem cheap on the surface, the steepness of the contango will continue to put pressure on the ETF due to the costs of rolling positions into new futures contracts.</p><p><strong>FUNDAMENTALS/NEWSFLOW:</strong> Of US corporates making production cuts, Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP) and Occidental (OXY) compose more than 50% of those cuts, which could be indicative of further production limits to be made, or, an industry that is unwilling to do such. Texas regulators have been debating on whether to enforce state-wide cuts (we may get an update tomorrow). The supply glut and COVID-19 uncertainty are being felt across the energy markets, with reports that refiners are hesitant to enter into longer-term market orders, as they would normally, for oil, and instead are preferring to lift cargoes at the last minute from nearby locations. Meanwhile, China has been reported to be approximately doubling (Y/Y) its oil storage inflows amid the pandemic, based off of newswire calculations as there are no official figures released on its storage figures.</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS:</strong> The US administration and Democrats in Congress are said to be near a USD 450bln economic relief package for small businesses including billions for the paycheck protection programme (PPP), hospitals and expansion of testing. At the same time, other sources noted that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi were very close to a deal for 2nd round of small business loans. President Trump himself said they are getting closer to an agreement and could have an answer on Monday; US Senate Majority Leader McConnell announced today a session has been scheduled for tomorrow to continue work on the coronavirus relief package for small businesses. Trump also said he is in favour of aid to state and local governments, although that would be for a future package to be negotiated with Congress. Meanwhile, on the tariff front, Trump has exempt COVID-19 hit business from import tariffs, but retains certain China tariffs, in line with prior suggestions.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>ECB BAD BANK:</strong> high-level ECB officials, including Governing Council member Stournaras, as well as Supervisory Board head Enria, are reportedly pushing for an EZ bad-bank to deal with debts from the ’08 crisis. However, the plan is, as bad-bank plans previously have in the EZ, facing opposition from the European Commission regarding state-aid rule changes and that there are better alternatives; as such, talks have reportedly stopped, the FT reported. The reports of scepticism to the idea saw European banks trade lower on Monday.</p><p><strong>ECB’S DE GUINDOS AND VILLEROY </strong>commented that ECB is flexible and could act further if required.</p><p><strong>PBOC </strong>cut the 1-Year Loan Prime Rate 3.85%, as expected (prev. 4.05%); 5-Year Loan Prime Rate was cut to 4.65%, as expected (prev. 4.75%). China’s NDRC said the nation will roll out more forceful, targeted fiscal, financial and employment policies with relevant departments, while it added there is still significant room for macro hedging policy to work with.</p><p><strong>BOE: </strong>Deputy Governor <strong>Broadbent</strong> said that the COVID-19 crisis is quite unlike a normal cyclical downturn and it is hard to think distinctly about the demand hit vs supply. OBR 25% Q2 GDP decline scenario is not unrealistic. While Chief Economist <strong>Haldane</strong> stated MPC cannot prevent a sharp downturn but can cushion it and rate cuts are being passed on to the economy as best as the MPC can tell, but the pass-through is not complete yet.</p><h2>EUROPE</h2><p><strong>LOCKDOWN:</strong> Germany has begun opening smaller shops as of Monday. Meanwhile, French PM Philippe said the government would unveil plans to progressively lift current restrictions on business and travel within two weeks.</p><p><strong>UK: </strong>The Times reported that PM Johnson had told colleagues that he wants to be very cautious in lifting lockdown measures to avoid a second wave; note, this follows a report in The Sunday Times suggesting that Johnson had been slow to react to the outbreak of COVID-19. In terms of potential lockdown dates, The Telegraph has reported that two leading UCL economists have submitted a proposal to the government suggesting that measures could be eased as early as May 4th with small shops to re-open under the same social distancing measures as supermarkets. Elsewhere, the Telegraph also reported that a senior UK government adviser has suggested that the nation needs to start easing lockdown measures in 3-4 weeks. In terms of the economic fallout, The Times reports that the Treasury’s internal assessment of the impact of COVID-19 paints an even more pessimistic picture than the report released by the OBR earlier in the week (suggested GDP could fall by 35% in Q2).</p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p>T-NOTES (M20) SETTLED 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 139-03+.</p><p>The TPLEX modestly bull-flattened as the crude losses kept risk appetite at bay; by settlement, 2s were unchanged at 0.20%, 10s -3bps at 0.62%, 30s -5bps at -1.23%. The gains came mainly overnight as oil prices made their descent, although heading into the US session yields traded rangebound, with the 10-year yield swimming between 0.61-0.65%. Note, while front-month oil futures made record losses (and prices), the move in other assets, particularly USTs, were muted. Participants were unwilling to let yields fall lower, perhaps indicative of their collective view that near-term oil price fluctuations were temporary, rather than that of the beginning of a sustained disinflationary environment. At the same time, it is worth highlighting that pressure on yields were also likely muted as Fed has now pared its purchases to approximately USD 15bln per day from USD 30bln last week, and as one would expect, offer-to-cove ratios have elevated at the operations on Monday. Furthermore, a handful of corporate issuance to start the week gave participants more supply to digest. In the front-end, FRA-OIS spreads widened on Monday, with Fed data showing commercial paper rates remain elevated while the background of ramped up US CMBs and T-Bill issuance puts upward pressure on the complex.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -1.82% at 2822, NDX -1.20% at 8727, DJIA -2.44% at 23,650.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Utilities -3.89%, Real Estate -3.74%, Energy -3.29%, Industrials -2.7%, Materials -2.54%, Cons Stpl -2.08%, Financials -1.96%, Technology -1.78%, Cons Disc -1.27%, Communication Svs -0.92%, Health -0.78%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Energy names (OXY, MRO, MPC, CVX) were initially acutely lower at the open, although the energy sector overall is off lows after somewhat shrugging off the record declines in the WTI May contract, while the June contract settled USD 4.60 lower, still leading to sector underperformance, however. Disney (DIS) has reportedly stopped paying over 100k workers; meanwhile, it received a downgrade to Neutral from UBS and Credit Suisse. DuPont’s (DD) EPS and revenue view is firmer than what the street was looking for, while announcing it entered a USD 1bln RCF, taking its total financing to USD 3bln. United Airlines (UAL) recorded a preliminary Q1 pre-tax loss of USD 2.1bln, revenue USD 8bln (exp. 8.27bln, -17% Y/Y). Boeing Company (BA) had a USD 2.9bln order for twenty-nine 737 MAX Aircraft cancelled by China’s Development bank. Elsewhere, the stock was downgraded to neutral from Buy at Citi; noting that if Boeing is entering a new phase, Citi believes it is one that is less friendly to equity holders. The analyst notes that Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) offers a more compelling risk/reward ratio on the recovery. Pepsi’s (PEP) USD 3.85bln acquisition of Rockstar Energy has been approved by the US FTC, according to NY Post. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) reportedly hired Goldman Sachs (GS) to explore financing options which could include a stake sale, according to people familiar with the matter. Macy’s (M) is reportedly mulling a financing deal to help boost liquidity to assist against COVID-19, according to people familiar with the matter. Shake Shack (SHAK) returned the USD 10mln loan from the PPP as it had secured financing elsewhere. Citron Research says Novavax (NVAX) is a “serial promise and non-deliver on every virus”, expects stock to trade back to USD 15.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> M&amp;T Bank (MTB) missed on EPS, likely due to its 250mln credit provision, noting the impact of COVID-19 could be material. Halliburton HAL) beat on EPS, revenue was in line, announced it has cut CapEx by USD 800mln and overhead costs by USD 1bln, noting NA activity is expected to decline sharply in Q2. Truist Financial (TFC) beat on EPS and revenue.</p><p><strong>SEMICONDUCTORS (SOX):</strong> As the sector begins to report earnings, with TXN, LRCX, STX, XLNX, INTC, MLNX all reporting this week, Citi’s analysts believe the quarter will be an optimistic one driven by inventory-hoarding induced demand, as orders are being made in fear of supply disruption, while the bank sees a “collapse” for the sector going ahead as the economic fallout trickles down the supply chain, similar to that of the GFC. More specifically, Citi believes INTC will “handily beat” Q1 estimates due to data centre strength, although highlights the grim outlook by comparing to the GFC, where Intel’s data centre revenue fell by 30%.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> The buck started the US session on the front foot amid a cautious start to the week, however, as equities pared lows the greenback also saw some selling pressure, particularly over the 1600 BST/1100 ET London fix. Heading into Asia, the buck is little changed.</p><p><strong>PETRO-CURRENCIES (CAD/RUB/MXN):</strong> The Loonie fell victim to the tumbling oil prices, which kept USDCAD pinned around 1.41. Scotia wrote USDCAD seems to have found a base at 1.3923, the 40dma, but was capped around the 21dma at 1.4109, and “the broader chop may extend a little further this week between 1.39/1.41—or, on the slightly wider scale, 1.38/1.42. We are still more inclined to look to fade USD rallies”. XN seeing significant underperformance and back above 24.0 against the dollar, while USDRUB briefly crossed 75.0 to the upside. MXN was also seeing downside after Mexico and Pemex were downgraded on Friday; an analyst at Moody’s noted the country’s sovereign rating could be further downgraded, however, its investment-grade status will likely remain. NOK also weaker.</p><p><strong>NZD</strong>: An outperformer after the government announced it would relax lockdown restrictions next week, with a review to take place on May 11th. Note, the country only saw nine new cases on Monday and zero new deaths with an R0 < 0.5%. Elsewhere supporting the Kiwi, CPI was firmer than expected Q/Q at 0.8%, while Y/Y ticked up to 2.5%.</p><p><strong>JPY/XAU:</strong> Havens were mixed today with not much conviction either side in a day of light news flow. JPY is slightly weaker against the buck but has remained within a tight range between 107.50 -107.94. The precious metal, however, was firmer against the buck continuing gains but stabilised just shy of the 1700/oz mark.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Cable briefly hit 1.25 after the re-open of electronic trade but has since then been trading with a downside bias to 1.2417 at the lows, before paring. BoE’s Broadbent noted that the OBR worst-case scenario of a 35% Q2 GDP decline does not look unrealistic.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> EURUSD traded within a tight range today between 1.0842 and 1.0896. JPMorgan strategists have a year-end target of 1.06, citing concerns around growth and its debt levels. JPM struggles to see a material bounce in the EUR despite some more positive recent headlines about peak declines and re-opening plans, and advocates selling rallies near 1.0900/15 in the near-term. As well as advance April PMIs/COVID/re-opening headlines, desks will be watching S&amp;P’s review of Italy on Friday. JPM struggles to see a material bounce in the EUR despite some more positive recent headlines about peak declines and re-opening plans, and advocates selling rallies near 1.0900/15 in the near-term. As well as advance April PMIs/COVID/re-opening headlines, desks will be watching S&amp;P’s review of Italy on Friday.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> Overall weaker against the buck to start the week, with lower oil prices driving the story. Blackrock announced it downgraded its view on emerging markets local debt to neutral, citing further currency depreciation risks. Elsewhere, ZAR watchers will be eyeing a final cabinet meeting on fiscal measures. TRY a relative outperformer and only marginally weaker against the buck amid lower crude prices, although sources also stated that the CBRT is in talks with G20 central banks to set up swap lines. BRL also weaker today, note over the weekend President Bolsonaro reiterated his call for a speedy re-opening of the economy, while the former (now fired) health minister endorsed a more cautious approach.</p>",

The gains came mainly overnight as oil prices made their descent, although heading into the US session yields traded rangebound, with the 10-year yield swimming between 0.61-0.65%. Note, while front-month oil futures made record losses (and prices), the move in other assets, particularly USTs, were muted. Participants were unwilling to let yields fall lower, perhaps indicative of their collective view that near-term oil price fluctuations were temporary, rather than that of the beginning of a sustained disinflationary environment. At the same time, it is worth highlighting that pressure on yields were also likely muted as Fed has now pared its purchases to approximately USD 15bln per day from USD 30bln last week, and as one would expect, offer-to-cove ratios have elevated at the operations on Monday. Furthermore, a handful of corporate issuance to start the week gave participants more supply to digest. In the front-end, FRA-OIS spreads widened on Monday, with Fed data showing commercial paper rates remain elevated while the background of ramped up US CMBs and T-Bill issuance puts upward pressure on the complex.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD:</strong> The buck started the US session on the front foot amid a cautious start to the week, however, as equities pared lows the greenback also saw some selling pressure, particularly over the 1600 BST/1100 ET London fix. Heading into Asia, the buck is little changed.</p><p><strong>PETRO-CURRENCIES (CAD/RUB/MXN):</strong> The Loonie fell victim to the tumbling oil prices, which kept USDCAD pinned around 1.41. Scotia wrote USDCAD seems to have found a base at 1.3923, the 40dma, but was capped around the 21dma at 1.4109, and “the broader chop may extend a little further this week between 1.39/1.41—or, on the slightly wider scale, 1.38/1.42. We are still more inclined to look to fade USD rallies”. XN seeing significant underperformance and back above 24.0 against the dollar, while USDRUB briefly crossed 75.0 to the upside. MXN was also seeing downside after Mexico and Pemex were downgraded on Friday; an analyst at Moody’s noted the country’s sovereign rating could be further downgraded, however, its investment grade status will likely remain. NOK also weaker.</p><p><strong>NZD: </strong>An outperformer after the government announced it would relax lockdown restrictions next week, with a review to take place on May 11th. Note, the country only saw nine new cases on Monday and zero new deaths with an R0 < 0.5%. Elsewhere supporting the Kiwi, CPI was firmer than expected Q/Q at 0.8%, while Y/Y ticked up to 2.5%.</p><p><strong>JPY/XAU: </strong>Havens were mixed today with not much conviction either side in a day of light news flow. JPY is slightly weaker against the buck but has remained within a tight range between 107.50 -107.94. The precious metal however was firmer against the buck continuing gains however stabilized just shy of the 1700/oz mark.</p><p><strong>GBP: </strong>Cable briefly hit 1.25 after the re-open of electronic trade but has since then been trading with a downside bias to 1.2417 at the lows, before paring. BoE’s Broadbent noted that the OBR worst case scenario of a 35% Q2 GDP decline does not look unrealistic.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> EURUSD traded within a tight range today between 1.0842 and 1.0896. JPMorgan strategists have a year-end target of 1.06, citing concerns around growth and its debt levels. JPM struggles to see a material bounce in the EUR despite some more positive recent headlines about peak declines and re-opening plans, and advocates selling rallies near 1.0900/15 in the near-term. As well as advance April PMIs/COVID/re-opening headlines, desks will be watching S&amp;P's review of Italy on Friday.

As well as advance April PMIs/COVID/re-opening headlines, desks will be watching S&amp;P's review of Italy on Friday.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> Overall weaker against the buck to start the week, with lower oil prices driving the story. Blackrock announced it downgraded its view on emerging markets local debt to neutral, citing further currency depreciation risks. Elsewhere, ZAR watchers will be eyeing a final cabinet meeting on fiscal measures. TRY a relative outperformer and only marginally weaker against the buck amid lower crude prices, although sources also stated that the CBRT is in talks with G20 central banks to set up swap lines. BRL also weaker today, note over the weekend President Bolsonaro reiterated his call for a speedy re-opening of the economy, while the former (now fired) health minister endorsed a more cautious approach.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Crude futures, predominantly WTI, printed large losses to start the week. The decline was led by the WTI May contract (which expires at the close of business on Tuesday), which hit multi-decade lows (CME even said it would let the contract trade negative), as expiry looms nearer in the face of a physical market that is over-encumbered with supply as demand faces obliteration in light of COVID-19. In essence, storage at the US settlement hub, Cushing, is filling at a rapid rate causing traders to baulk at the prospect of delivery, especially amid lockdown conditions. However, while eye-gorging figures in the May contract, futures trading has mainly rolled into the June contract by now, as evident by open interest and volume figures, where losses were relatively more contained, albeit still concerning. The May contract does, however, underscore the current woes in WTI; Citi, to wit, “we see risk that June WTI will face similar pressure to converge with the weaker cash market in turn, particularly as it’s trading at a moderate USD 4.30 discount to June Brent, not a wide enough arbitrage to stimulate US exports in our estimation.” &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>USO</strong>: The low prices are enticing those less versed in the energy market. The major US Oil ETF (USO) recorded its largest ever one day inflow of USD 552mln on Friday, also marking a record weekly inflow of USD 1.6bln; although such low prices may seem cheap on the surface, the steepness of the contango will continue to put pressure on the ETF due to the costs of rolling positions into new futures contracts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;FUNDAMENTALS/NEWSFLOW:</strong> Of US corporates making production cuts, Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP) and Occidental (OXY) compose more than 50% of those cuts, which could be indicative of further production limits to be made, or, an industry that is unwilling to do such. Texas regulators have been debating on whether to enforce state-wide cuts (we may get an update tomorrow). The supply glut and COVID-19 uncertainty are being felt across the energy markets, with reports that refiners are hesitant to enter into longer-term market orders, as they would normally, for oil, and instead are preferring to lift cargoes at the last minute from nearby locations. Meanwhile, China has been reported to be approximately doubling (Y/Y) its oil storage inflows amid the pandemic, based off of newswire calculations as there are no official figures released on its storage figures.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>CAD/MXN/RUB</strong></p><p>Little respite for the Loonie from an unexpected rise in Canadian wholesale trade as oil prices extended their slide into Tuesday’s front month WTI expiry (May contract down to Usd 10/brl at one stage) and domestic crude briefly dipped below parity. However, Usd/Cad has pulled back from circa 1.4130 highs alongside Usd/Mxn pivoting 24.0000 and Usd/Rub retreating through 75.0000 as Russia confirms its contribution to the OPEC+ pact to lower production, by 20% from February levels between May and June.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>Relative COVID-19 relief has kept the Kiwi elevated ever since NZ PM Ardern plans for businesses to re-open from April 27 when the country will emerge from lockdown due to transmission rates slowing to 0.5% and the rate of fatalities amongst the lowest in the world. Nevertheless, Nzd/Usd waned ahead of 0.6100 and Aud/Nzd could not sustain momentum under 1.0500 as the Aussie nudged towards 0.6400 vs its US counterpart after more PBoC stimulus overnight awaiting tomorrow’s RBA minutes and updated economic and financial assessments/outlooks from Governor Lowe.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/CHF/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sterling lost sight of 1.2500 and 0.8700+ status against the Dollar and Euro respectively in early trade and never managed to recover, as the <strong>DXY </strong>pared losses between 99.645-100.070 parameters and Eur/Gbp bounced firmly, albeit inconsistently to test and temporarily breach the 200 DMA (0.8739). Hence, a mega near 3 bn 0.8700 option expiry in the cross didn’t really factor nor the fact that the single currency faded into 1.0900 vs the Buck, though the Pound was at least cognisant of more coronavirus contagion via IHS UK income hitting a new index low and BoE commentary from Broadbent and Haldane, while the Euro had to weather another bleak 2020 forecast for the German economy from the Bundesbank monthly report. Meanwhile, contrasting fortunes for the safe-haven Franc and Yen as the former largely shrugged off more evidence of intervention in the form of further substantial rises in Swiss sight deposits, but the latter heeded higher Japanese nCoV cases and deaths on top of weak trade data, exports especially. Usd/Chf held well above 0.9700 and close to 1.0500 vs the Euro, while Usd/Jpy meandered from 107.94-50 and straddled 117.00.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Aside from choppy risk sentiment and relative Greenback stability, the Real was undermined by more investor angst over Brazilian President Bolsonaro’s apparent lack of efforts to try and limit the fallout from the global pandemic, with Usd/Brl touching 5.3000 and not too far from 5.3500+ record peaks.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>MACRO: </strong>There is particular focus this morning is on the energy sector, with the May contract collapsing. However, while this tells us how no one wants to take delivery of crude at these levels, focus should be on the June contract given open interest and volume have rolled over ahead of May expiry on Tuesday. Equities have opened lower while Treasuries bull-flattening slightly. The dollar is slightly better than neutral amid the cautious risk tone, while XAU and JPY slightly softer against the buck.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Of note for Energy names, (XOM, CVX, COP, OXY, MRO, MPC) energy sector performing poorly with heavy losses across the space as WTI continues to tumble led by losses in the May contract, albeit open-interest and volume has rolled over to the June contract. Amid the debate on whether supply cuts should be enforced, Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP) and Occidental (OXY) compose more than 50% of the current voluntary cuts being put in place. Financials also lagging with lower yields across the curve, continuing the sectors decline from last week as it kicks off earnings season. Consumer Discretionary and Staples are the relative outperformers, although still in negative territory, where all sectors reside.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Disney (DIS) has reportedly stopped paying over 100k workers, meanwhile it saw a downgrade to Neutral from UBS and Credit Suisse. DuPont’s (DD) EPS and revenue view is firmer than what the street was looking for, while announcing it entered a USD 1bln RCF, taking its total financing to USD 3bln. United Airlines (UAL) recorded a preliminary Q1 pre-tax loss of USD 2.1bln, revenue USD 8bln (exp. 8.27bln, -17% Y/Y). Pepsi’s (PEP) USD 3.85bln acquisition of Rockstar Energy has been approved by the US FTC, according to NY Post. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) reportedly hired Goldman Sachs (GS) to explore financing options which could include a stake sale, according to people familiar with the matter. Macy’s (M) is reportedly mulling a financing deal to help boost liquidity to assist against COVID-19, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> M&amp;T Bank (MTB) missed on EPS, likely due to its 250mln credit provision, noting the impact of COVID-19 could be material. Halliburton HAL) beat on EPS, revenue was in line, announced it has cut CapEx by USD 800mln and overhead costs by USD 1bln, noting NA activity is expected to decline sharply in Q2. Truist Financial (TFC) beat on EPS and revenue.</p><p><strong>STOCKS REBOUND:</strong>&nbsp;US equity indices last week printed a fourth consecutive week of gains. The rebounds are so large and broad that ease the implied probability of a recession to just 75%, JPMorgan says, even though the global economy is just entering the deepest contraction since World War II; it signals investors have high optimism of a seamless sequence from lockdown to flat infection curves to economic re-openings to growth and earnings revival. The gains are a result of the policy support provided post COVID-19. But while the Nasdaq 100 went green YTD, generally, leadership has been defensive.</p><p><strong>SEMICONDUCTORS: </strong>As the Semiconductor (SOX) sector begins to report earnings – with TXN, LRCX, STX, XLNX, INTC, MLNX all reporting this week – Citi’s analysts believe the quarter will be an optimistic one driven by inventory-hoarding induced demand, as orders are being made in fear of supply disruption, while the bank sees a “collapse” for the sector going ahead as the economic fallout trickles down the supply chain, similar to that of the GFC. More specifically, Citi believes INTC will “handily beat” Q1 estimates due to data centre strength, although highlights the grim outlook by comparing to the GFC, where Intel’s data centre revenue fell by 30%.</p><p><strong>AHEAD:</strong>&nbsp;Looking ahead, JPMorgan thinks that the Fed's credit bond purchases will help US Equities to reach all-time highs in H1 2021. It notes that investor positioning remains light (hedge fund's equity beta are at tenth percentile, CTAs could go long equities at around 2,900, and Vol-targeting funds should also increase equity exposure), adding that given the Fed’s corporate bond backstop, the VIX should follow spreads lower. The bank suggests overweighting secular winners in a post-COVID world, and to distinguish between value opportunities and value traps: \"A shift from the sharing economy to an online, self-insured, surveilled and protectionist one might sound somewhat Orwellian, but it nonetheless implies further leadership by Tech (and parts of Communications as well as Consumer Discretionary) and uncharacteristic leadership by a defensive (Healthcare),\" arguing that \"these sectors are so dominant in US indices that secular trends post-COVID-19 imply US outperformance vs non-US stocks.\"</p><p><strong>FED PURCHASES:</strong>&nbsp;On Friday, the NY Fed announced its daily bond purchases would average around USD 15bln this week (cut from USD 30bln last week), which resulted in higher yields and a wobble for major US equities, although not enough to prevent a surge in later trader (amid thin liquidity conditions, it must be noted). \"With market functioning having improved, our strategists see a case for the Fed to reduce the pace of purchases further which could open up a prospect higher yields,\" JPM writes.</p><p><strong>THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS:</strong>&nbsp;This week 31% of the S&amp;P 500 market cap&nbsp;<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/24310/download?code=9o9AJWcr9Jp2luZCucYf\">will report earnings</a>, with results having generally disappointed relatively tepid expectations. So far, 9% of the S&amp;P 500 had reported Q1 earnings, and at the close of business Friday, the typical firm posted -5% Y/Y EPS; 43% missed expectations, which Goldman Sachs says is on target for the highest pace since 1998. But while GS expects the S&amp;P 500 will show a 15% EPS decline in 1Q, and then a 123% plunge in 2Q, it says that most investors are already looking ahead to 2021 EPS.</p><p><strong>CAPEX, BUYBACKS AND DIVIDENDS TO DECLINE; INVESTORS LIKE SAFE BALANCE SHEETS:</strong>&nbsp;GS forecasts S&amp;P 500 capex will decline by an annual record 33% in 2020, with firms prioritising liquidity, while buybacks and dividends will also decline sharply (it thinks by 50% and 23% in 2020), noting that since March 58 S&amp;P 500 companies, accounting for 29% of total 2019 buybacks, have suspended repurchase programmes, and says that mounting liquidity constraints and increasing political pressure will curtail buyback spending during 2020. For dividends specifically, GS thinks aggregate S&amp;P 500 dividends will slide 23% to USD 398bln in 2020. \"We expect dividend suspensions, cuts, and eliminations will result in S&amp;P 500 DPS falling by 25% vs. 2019 levels,\" deeper than is implied by futures (-18%). However, it says not all companies are going to be cutting (JNJ and PG announced dividend boosts last week); GS has rebalanced its dividend portfolio and notes that it recently added CTL, HRB, HBI, RL, HD, SYY, TSN, FTI, PRU, FITB, RF, MRK, JNJ, RHI, HON, ADS, XRX, WU, ADP, ADI, NLOK, LYB, AVB, UDR, NRG to its dividend basket which the bank says offers the best combination of dividend yields and expected dividend growth, while also having a manageable payout ratio of less than 75%. The bank notes investors have rewarded firms with safe balance sheets YTD, with debt reducers outperforming debt issuers (-18% vs -26% YTD).</p>",

Elsewhere, the Telegraph also reported that a senior UK government adviser has suggested that the nation needs to start easing lockdown measures in 3-4 weeks.

(+0.5%)</strong> were somewhat indecisive although outperformed their regional peers after the PBoC cut the 1-year and 5-year Loan Prime Rates by 20bps and 10bps respectively as expected, while the state planning agency noted that China will roll out more forceful and targeted fiscal, financial and employment policies. Finally, 10yr JGBs lacked demand following recent comments from the Japan Securities Dealers Association that global funds sold record levels of 10yr JGBs last month and with Japan’s government planning to issue more than JPY 25.69tln to fund supplementary budget, although losses were stemmed by support at 152.00 and amid weakness in Japanese stocks.</p><p><strong>PBoC 1-Year Loan Prime Rate 3.85% vs. Exp. 3.85% (Prev. 4.05%).

OBR 25% Q2 GDP decline scenario is not unrealistic. While Chief Economist Haldane stated MPC cannot prevent a sharp downturn but can cushion it and rate cuts are being passed on to the economy as best as the MPC can tell but the pass-through is not complete yet.

US equity futures see more pronounced losses in comparison following the State-side gains posted on Friday. European sectors remain mixed with no clear indication of the risk-tone, whilst Energy and Materials reside at the bottom of the bunch. Looking at the breakdown, the downside sees Basic Resources alongside Oil &amp; Gas, whilst Healthcare resides at the other end of the spectrum; Travel &amp; Leisure remains relatively flat. In terms of movers, miners see pressure in European trade after giant Vale reported Q1 iron ore sales -6.8% YY and iron ore production -18% YY. Co. cut its FY20 iron ore production to 310-330mln tons vs. Prev. 340-355mln tons amid delays to the resumption of operations at certain mines. FY nickel production guidance cut to 180-195k tons vs. Prev. 200-210k tons. Thus, Glenore (-1.6%), Rio Tinto (-1.8%), Anglo American (-2.8%), Fresnillo (-2.5%), BHP (-1.3%) all see losses. European bank also see downside after reports downplayed ideas that the a EZ bad-bank will be formed to deal with debt from the 2008 crisis. Elsewhere, Phillips (+6.4%) extends on opening gains despite overall downbeat earnings as the Co. aims to return to growth and improved profitability in H2 2020. Sanofi’s (+1.1%) Head of French business said the Co. will pay out a dividend this year, with the overall value modestly higher YY, albeit shares are moving in tandem with the European Healthcare sector.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NZD/AUD - </strong>The Kiwi only got a fleeting fillip from firmer than forecast NZ inflation overnight, but is outperforming fellow majors on PM Arden’s acknowledgement of the progress made in containing the spread of nCoV to the point that plans are afoot to re-open businesses end lockdown this time next week. Nzd/Usd is firmly back over 0.6000 in response and eyeing resistance ahead of 0.6100, while the Aud/Nzd cross has retreated markedly to test 1.0500 as the Aussie lags below 0.6400 vs its US peer amidst weak oil and other commodity prices, albeit with the DXY unable to retain a grasp of the 100.000 handle.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/RUB/MXN - </strong>The Loonie, Norwegian Krona, Russian Rouble and Mexican Peso are all suffering alongside crude that is extending losses to deeper multi-year lows ahead of the looming May WTI futures expiry, with Usd/Cad hovering around 1.4050, Eur/Nok above 11.3000, Usd/Rub circa 74.5900 and Usd/Mxn back over 24.0000.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY/CHF/EUR - </strong>Pragmatic rather than poignant in terms of policy remarks from the BoE via Broadbent and Haldane have not really impacted the Pound, but Cable has pulled back from 1.2500 and Eur/Gbp is edging up towards the 200 DMA (0.8739) despite the draw of a particularly large option expiry at the 0.8700 strike (2.8 bn). Instead, Sterling seems to be suffering from general coronavirus fallout highlighted by IHS reporting the biggest fall in household income since it began publishing data. Similarly, but to a lesser extent due to fading risk sentiment after a mild boost from PBoC rate cuts, the Yen on a softer footing across the board, as Usd/Jpy meanders from 108.00 to 107.00 and Eur/Jpy pivots 117.00. Conversely, the Franc is rebounding from around 0.9700 and still close to 1.0500 against the Euro even though the single currency is forging gains vs the Greenback towards 1.0900 and latest Swiss bank sight deposits reveal even heftier intervention to curb Chf strength.</p><p><strong>Notable FX Expiry, NY Cut:</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EUR/GBP:<strong> 0.8700 (2.8BLN)</strong></p><p><strong>New Zealand CPI QQ (Q1) 0.8% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.5%). New Zealand CPI (Q1) Y/Y 2.5% vs. Exp. 2.1% (Prev. 1.9%)</strong> New Zealand RBNZ Sectoral Factor Model Inflation Index (Q1) 1.7% (Prev. 1.8%)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Aside from gradual Dollar depreciation and ongoing oil drilling, debt markets have arguably been livelier than others given further underperformance in the Eurozone periphery that provided <strong>Bunds</strong> with enough momentum to briefly and fractionally surpass near term chart resistance ahead of 173.00. However, extended recovery gains have since been pared after failing to breach the next technical hurdle at 173.05 and <strong>Gilts</strong> have also drifted back down from a minor new Liffe high at 136.91 to leave <strong>US Treasuries</strong> alone in positive territory. Note, very little reaction from the 10 year German benchmark to the latest Bundesbank monthly bulletin that suggests a limp rather than V, U or even L-shaped recovery from severe recession this year. Ahead, second tier NA releases before the latest weekly ECB updates on QE and the PEPP that might revive flagging Italian <strong>BTPs</strong>, Spanish <strong>Bonos</strong> and even French <strong>OATs</strong> if skewed in their direction to offer a backstop.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent futures </strong>kick the week off on the back foot, with the former’s front-month future (May) -18% but disregarded given its expiry tomorrow and with open interest and volumes minuscule in comparison to the following month (June). There is little by way of fresh fundamental developments to sway the markets, although traders continue to attempt to gauge the supply/demand imbalance against the backdrop of COVID-19. WTI June dipped sub-23/bbl to a low of around USD 22.70/bbl (high USD 24.92/bbl), whilst the Brent June future losses further ground below USD 28/bbl, having printed a fresh intraday base at 27.06/bbl. Meanwhile, the Arb between the two June contracts has widened to almost USD 4/bbl vs. sub-3/bbl on Friday. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> continues to be subdued below USD 1700/oz, with a firmer Buck providing further pressure to the yellow metal. <strong>Copper</strong> prices largely tracked lower with APAC sentiment, whilst action in the USD provides no relief to the red metal. Elsewhere, iron ore futures and nickel prices were supported overnight after mining giant Vale cut its production figures for the metals.</p>",

US equity futures see more pronounced losses in comparison following the State-side gains posted on Friday. European sectors remain mixed with no clear indication of the risk-tone, whilst Energy and Materials reside at the bottom of the bunch. Looking at the breakdown, the downside sees Basic Resources alongside Oil &amp; Gas, whilst Healthcare resides at the other end of the spectrum; Travel &amp; Leisure remains relatively flat. In terms of movers, miners see pressure in European trade after giant Vale reported Q1 iron ore sales -6.8% YY and iron ore production -18% YY. Co. cut its FY20 iron ore production to 310-330mln tons vs. Prev. 340-355mln tons amid delays to the resumption of operations at certain mines. FY nickel production guidance cut to 180-195k tons vs. Prev. 200-210k tons. Thus, Glenore (-1.6%), Rio Tinto (-1.8%), Anglo American (-2.8%), Fresnillo (-2.5%), BHP (-1.3%) all see losses. European bank also see downside after reports downplayed ideas that the a EZ bad-bank will be formed to deal with debt from the 2008 crisis. Elsewhere, Phillips (+6.4%) extends on opening gains despite overall downbeat earnings as the Co. aims to return to growth and improved profitability in H2 2020. Sanofi’s (+1.1%) Head of French business said the Co. will pay out a dividend this year, with the overall value modestly higher YY, albeit shares are moving in tandem with the European Healthcare sector.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi only got a fleeting fillip from firmer than forecast NZ inflation overnight, but is outperforming fellow majors on PM Arden’s acknowledgement of the progress made in containing the spread of nCoV to the point that plans are afoot to re-open businesses end lockdown this time next week. Nzd/Usd is firmly back over 0.6000 in response and eyeing resistance ahead of 0.6100, while the Aud/Nzd cross has retreated markedly to test 1.0500 as the Aussie lags below 0.6400 vs its US peer amidst weak oil and other commodity prices, albeit with the DXY unable to retain a grasp of the 100.000 handle.</p><p>CAD/NOK/RUB/MXN - The Loonie, Norwegian Krona, Russian Rouble and Mexican Peso are all suffering alongside crude that is extending losses to deeper multi-year lows ahead of the looming May WTI futures expiry, with Usd/Cad hovering around 1.4050, Eur/Nok above 11.3000, Usd/Rub circa 74.5900 and Usd/Mxn back over 24.0000.</p><p>GBP/JPY/CHF/EUR - Pragmatic rather than poignant in terms of policy remarks from the BoE via Broadbent and Haldane have not really impacted the Pound, but Cable has pulled back from 1.2500 and Eur/Gbp is edging up towards the 200 DMA (0.8739) despite the draw of a particularly large option expiry at the 0.8700 strike (2.8 bn).

There is little by way of fresh fundamental developments to sway the markets, although traders continue to attempt to gauge the supply/demand imbalance against the backdrop of COVID-19. <strong>WTI</strong> June dipped sub-23/bbl to a low of around USD 22.70/bbl (high USD 24.92/bbl), whilst the <strong>Brent</strong> June future losses further ground below USD 28/bbl, having printed a fresh intraday base at 27.06/bbl. Meanwhile, the Arb between the two June contracts has widened to almost USD 4/bbl vs. sub-3/bbl on Friday. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> continues to be subdued below USD 1700/oz, with a firmer Buck providing further pressure to the yellow metal. <strong>Copper</strong> prices largely tracked lower with APAC sentiment, whilst action in the USD provides no relief to the red metal. Elsewhere, <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> <strong>futures</strong> and <strong>nickel</strong> <strong>prices</strong> were supported overnight after mining giant Vale cut its production figures for the metals.</p>",

The question is what the purchases will eventually taper to. Even if it were reduced again next week, say to USD 10bln per day - almost one-eighth of the Fed was purchasing at a few weeks ago - that is still over USD 200bln per month, almost five times faster than most of the prior QE programmes.</li><li><strong>KEY QUESTION: </strong>BMO says the key question is when the Fed stops tapering its Treasury programme, what pace does it level-off at? Do they still publish daily amounts? Do they move to monthly amounts? Much of this will come down to market functioning and the level of liquidity in Treasury markets. BMO thinks whatever that number, the Fed will signal to investors that the Fed will be in this process for the long haul.</li><li><strong>MUCH FURTHER AHEAD: </strong>The next debate will be whether the Fed adopts yield-curve control - in that event, the amount the Fed tapers to becomes irrelevant, since the Fed would be purchasing any amount to meet any yield target. Such a tool is already in use at the BOJ and RBA; the argument has already been presented by Fed Governor Brainard, who had floated a tool of capping yields further out of the curve in order to narrow the shape of the curve; BMO asks, however, how much further yields curves need flattening given that spreads between short-end of the curve are already very flat, and accordingly, the strategy might not be as effective in the US.</li></ul>",

Broad risk sentiment appears positive overall on the back of PBoC rate cuts and more evidence of COVID-19 plateauing, but oil’s latest downturn is muddying the waters along with ongoing uncertainty over the extent of the economic fallout from the global pandemic and how long the drag on growth will last. As such, Bunds were marked down 20 ticks when Eurex resumed and slipped to a deeper 172.53 low vs last Friday’s 172.85 close before finding underlying bids, but for now it seems that recent highs are being observed within a wide 173.00-172.00 band.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>A choppy session for the Treasury curve; by settlement, 2s were unchanged at 0.20%, 10s +3bps at 0.64% and 30s +5bps at 1.26bps. An initial Gilead-induced risk bounce, which sequentially faded, only for Treasuries to be offered after the release of the NY Fed’s new (reduced) scheduled of purchases for next week’s asset buys. After the 10-year yield found solace around the 0.60% figure on Thursday, the risk rally in later trade saw it back up to just beneath 0.70%, with the Fed set to by USD 15bln per day next week, down from USD 30bln. The further tapering of the Fed’s purchases saw the curve bear steepen. However, the cuts will be evenly distributed across maturities, which some analysts suggesting that gives credence to the view that the increasingly Fed-lite market could be expressing its view of increased inflation expectations; one strategist at Janney Montgomery noted that in the wake of the Fed’s QE1 and ZIRP announcement in 2008/09, there was a +75bps back up in long-end yields in the face of a deflationary environment, which saw 2s10s widen to around the 100bps area (2s10s currently sits just below 45bps).
