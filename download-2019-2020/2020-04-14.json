(FBN)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Stocks made solid gains on Tuesday as normal liquidity conditions returned after the Easter weekend and Trump suggesting an announcement will be made shortly for plans to reopen the economy (although not all officials are convinced). Signals of financial strains continue to decline as the VIX fell beneath 38 for the first time since early March, credit spreads tightened, and credit proxy ETFs (HYD, LKD, MUB, LQD) made gains. Furthermore, risk-friendly currencies (GBP, AUD, EUR) outperformed on the back of the greenback falling further (funding pressures have eased, and the Fed’s expansionary policies continue to work against dollar bulls). JP Morgan (JPM) saw a heavy EPS miss although it built credit reserves which amounted to USD 6.8bln, USD 8.3bln in loan provisions, impacting EPS by USD 1.66/shr. Revenue also fell short of expectations. Net Interest Income (NII) &amp; Net Interest Margin (NIM) however were firmer than analyst expectations, although expects Q2 NII at USD 13.7bln, beneath street estimates, and it cut FY NII view to USD 55.5bln from USD 57bln. JPM maintained its dividend of USD 0.90/shr, and its CFO highlighted the bank remains committed to its dividend payments amid the coronavirus outbreak. JPM saw strong Equity and FICC revenues, while investment banking revenue was down 49% (lower advisory fees largely offset higher debt and equity underwriting fees). Wells Fargo (WFC) also saw a heavy EPS miss at USD 0.01/shr (exp. 0.72/shr) amid credit provisions, where it took a 0.73/shr impact from its reserve builds and impairment of securities, similar to JPM. Elsewhere, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) reported a solid EPS above analyst expectations, as was revenue, while it increased its quarterly dividend to USD 1.01/shr. SPX +3.02% at 2845, NDX +4.31% at 8692, DJIA +2.39% at 23950.</p><p>The TPLEX grinded higher through the session, despite an equity rally and amid returning liquidity conditions. The T-Note found support in APAC trade after a sell-off (in both equities and bonds) on Easter Monday, and liquidity helped to sustain the moves. Strong gains in the equity complex on Tuesday did little to change the dial either, with equities, gold and Treasuries rising in unison. Further, with the Fed paring back its daily purchases this week (average daily pace of USD 30bln vs 50bln last week), the appetite for USTs remains strong. The strength could be a function of equity hedges, as some desks view the stock market’s retracement as reaching peak “realistic” levels with corporate earnings depressed: BofA’s FMS recommended taking profits in the SPX between 2,850-3,000; survey respondents also noted long US Treasuries as the most crowded trade. Investors may also have been discomforted by the IMF’s latest gloomy assessment of the global economy on track to suffer the worst since the Depression. Additionally, JPMorgan’s and Wells Fargo’s Q1 earnings reports both caught participants off-guard with the extent of their loan provisions, shining a light on the extent of financial pain the wider economy is facing. However, the fiscal and monetary backstops being implemented will limit such extremes. By settlement, major spreads were slightly steeper, 2s -2bps at 0.22%, 10s unchanged at 0.75% and 30s +2 at 1.41%. US T-note futures (M0) settled 4+ ticks higher at 138-07.</p>",

Supply: UK &amp; Germany</p><h2>MARKET WRAP</h2><p>Stocks made solid gains on Tuesday as normal liquidity conditions returned after the Easter weekend and Trump suggesting an announcement will be made shortly for plans to reopen the economy (although not all officials are convinced). Signals of financial strains continue to decline as the VIX fell beneath 38 for the first time since early March, credit spreads tightened, and credit proxy ETFs (HYD, LKD, MUB, LQD) made gains. Furthermore, risk-friendly currencies (GBP, AUD, EUR) outperformed on the back of the greenback falling further (funding pressures have eased, and the Fed’s expansionary policies continue to work against dollar bulls). However, the landscape wasn’t all evergreen, where despite the risk rally, the T-Note and spot gold were both firmer too, and as the OPEC+ meeting optimism faded, concerns brought crude futures lower on the session.</p><h2>VIRUS CASE COUNT</h2><p>Figures provided as of Tuesday (via state offcial health departments) against Monday:</p><ul><li><strong>US </strong>cases rise 4.4% to 579,005 (prev. +5.6% at 554,849); death toll +1.4% at 22,252 (prev. +7.1% at 21,942). <strong>NEW YORK</strong> cases rise 3.7% to 202,208 (prev. +3.4% at 195,031), death toll rises by 7.7% to 10,834 (prev. +7.2% at 10,056).</li><li><strong>Italy </strong>cases rise by 1.9% to 162,488 (prev. +2% at 159,516), death toll rises by 2.9% to 21,067 (prev. +2.8% at 20,465)</li><li><strong>SPAIN </strong>cases rise to 172,541 (Prev. 169,496), death toll rises to 18,056 (prev. 17,489); deaths increase by 567 (prev. 517).</li><li><strong>GERMANY </strong>cases rose by 2082 to 125,098, death toll rose by 170 to 2969.</li><li><strong>FRANCE </strong>cases rises 5.6% to 103,573 (prev. +3.2% at 98,076), death toll rises 5.1% to 15,729 (prev. +4.0% at 14,967)</li><li><strong>UK </strong>cases rise to 93,873 (prev. 88,621), death toll rises to 12,107 (prev. 11,329); deaths rise by 778 (+6.87%) vs. yesterday's increase of 717 (+6.76%).</li><li><strong>SWITZERLAND </strong>cases rise to 25,834, death toll rose to 900.</li><li><strong>CANADA </strong>cases rise +5.48% to 26,163 (prev. +4.5% to 24,804), death toll rises by 12% to 823 (prev. +8.9% to 734).</li></ul><h2>GLOBAL</h2><p><strong>IMF forecasts the global economy to contract by 3% this year</strong> amid the virus impact (vs prev. view of 3.3% growth) - growth projections assume a pandemic peak in Q2 and a fade in H2 2020, with lockdown measures, unwound gradually. The latest edition of the IMF’s World Economic Outlook saw wholesale downgrades to its growth views, and now forecast the global economy will contract by 3.0% in 2020, the steepest downturn since the great recession, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago. The forecasts assume the virus will mostly peak in Q2 2020, and then fade in H2, with lockdown measures to be gradually unwound. It then sees a sharp rebound in 2021, pencilling in global growth of 5.8%. The updated projections came with large caveats around the .uncertainty surrounding the outlook, and it said the 2021 recovery was “only partial as the level of economic activity is projected to remain below the level we had projected for 2021 before the virus hit.”</p><p><strong>G7 FINANCE MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANKERS</strong> reaffirmed close coordination to counter virus impacts. They reiterated their pledges to do “whatever is necessary” to restore economic growth, protect jobs, businesses and financial system resilience. The group expressed that it remains committed to use all available policy tools to achieve growth, is working to address the crisis and provide support for EM economies. The group said it supports temporary suspension on bilateral debt service payments eligible for World Bank concessional financing if all G20 members join in.</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS: </strong>Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said we’re ahead of schedule on delivering checks in the mail to Americans and that the administration wants a bipartisan bill for additional relief for small businesses. Elsewhere, the Department of Agriculture will unveil as much as USD 15.5bln in the first phase of coronavirus aid to the farming industry, sources reported. Meanwhile, US House Speaker Pelosi said House Democrats could not accept Senate Majority Leader McConnell’s proposals on the virus emergency spending bill, coming amid ongoing talks between lawmakers in Congress. On a more progressive note, Senator Doug Jones said he understands a fair amount of progress had been made on discussions between Schumer and Mnuchin on extending the small-business Paycheck Protection Program funding.</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN: </strong>President Trump said we’re very close to completing a plan to reopen the country and hopefully ahead of schedule. Trump said he would know in the next few days when he wants to reopen, also adding that he should have a decision this week on WHO funding (having made threats to withdraw such). NIH’s Fauci said that even though last week was a bad one, we are starting to see flattening, including in hot spots such as New York; however, Fauci said later in an AP interview that the May 1st target to reopen the economy is “overly optimistic” for many parts of the US, saying the US does not have the testing capacity to reopen. Meanwhile, a WHO spokesperson said the virus peak had not been seen yet, the picture in Europe is mixed, some countries show a deceleration in cases whilst UK and Turkey still show increased rates in cases, and 90% of cases are coming from Europe and US.</p><h2>EUROPE</h2><p><strong>STIMULUS:</strong> French Government is reportedly going to raise the cost of its crisis response package to EUR 110bln (prev. 100bln) in its budget update, according to sources.</p><p><strong>LOCKDOWN: </strong>The head of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute said there is no clear sign of numbers falling further, Germany must wait and remain disciplined. RKI added that the lower case count over the Easter period is largely due to lower testing levels.</p><p><strong>UK: </strong>Foreign Secretary Raab is to announce on Thursday the UK will extend the lockdown until at least May 7th. Senior ministers are split on whether or not to encourage people to return to work when it is safe to do so if they cannot work from home. (Times) Separate reports note that ministers have been told to abandon talk of its exit strategy amid public fears over the eventual curtailing of lockdown measures. On the Brexit front, EU &amp; UK negotiators Barnier and Frost are on Wednesday, via a call, to determine the dates for the next rounds of negotiations; the call will not discuss the possibility of extending the transition period. Note, originally the schedule had 3-rounds of negotiations completed by now, FT reported. There were later FT reports that the UK is holding out on providing EU with detailed fishing rights proposals, which could derail approaching talks.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>BOC PRIMER: </strong>rate decision on April 15th, 2020 at 1000 ET/1500 BST; press conference at 1030 ET/1530 BST. There will be no media lock-in due to Ontario’s ban on gatherings of five or more people amid COVID-19. Accordingly, the release will likely trickle through newswires in a slower fashion than we are usually used to, and this may result in volatility around the release, Scotiabank says, especially if new programmes are introduced. Rate decision and Monetary Policy Report are due at 1000 ET/1500 BST; press conference with Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins at 1030 ET/1530 BST. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/primer-boc-rate-decision-on-15th-april-2020-at-1000-et-1500-bst-press-conference-at-1030-et-1530-bst-14-04-2020\"><i>Click here for full primer.</i></a></p><p><strong>FED’S EVANS</strong> (non-voter) said the US economy will recover in H2, but there is a risk it could be delayed, added there is no way you could have insured against this shock, noting there is a part for the government to socialise the costs. Evans said small businesses are fragile against a big shock and really important for creating jobs.</p><p><strong>FED’S BULLARD</strong> (Non-Voter) said the US should get down to a low number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the weeks ahead, reiterating that the Fed is willing to do more if other markets experience trouble. Bullard said the US could have a V-shaped recovery if the virus is handled well, saying testing capacity needs to improve. Note, over the weekend Fed’s Kashkari (voter, dove) warned that the US economy faces an 18-month strategy of rolling shutdowns until a therapy or a vaccine for coronavirus is developed and added that it was hard for him to see a V-shaped recovery under that scenario.</p><p><strong>FED’S BOSTIC</strong> (non-voter) said he is confident support will reach businesses on time, although more is likely needed for small businesses, local government, and GIG economy workers, he said in a Yahoo Finance interview. Bostic said&nbsp; Fed programmes have a timetable, and balance sheets will naturally get smaller as the programmes end and the economy grows.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>US IMPORT PRICES </strong>declined by 2.3% M/M in March, slightly better than the consensus -3.2% M/M; export process fell 1.6%. again slightly better than the -1.9% M/M the Street was looking for. Oxford Economics notes that import prices fell by the most since 2015, largely on the back of prices of imported fuel, and observes that non-fuel import prices were flat in the month. “Headline and core import prices remain firmly in deflation,” OxEco writes, “a strong dollar, low oil prices and a global recession will keep them that way.”</p><p><strong>CHINESE TRADE BALANCE</strong> (CNY) (Mar) 130.0B vs. Exp. 158.5B (Prev. -42.6B). Chinese Exports (CNY)(Mar) Y/Y -3.5% vs. Exp. -12.8% (Prev. -16.6%) Chinese Imports (CNY)(Mar) Y/Y +2.4% vs. Exp. -7.0% (Prev. -0.3%). (USD) (Mar) 19.9B vs. Exp. 18.55B (Prev. -7.09B). Chinese Exports (USD) (Mar) Y/Y -6.6% vs. Exp. -14.0% (Prev. -17.2%) Chinese Imports (USD) (Mar) Y/Y -0.9% vs. Exp. -9.5% (Prev. -4.0%). China’s customs said the global economy faces mounting downward pressure, uncertainties are increasing, and that China’s foreign trade is encountering bigger difficulties, while it added that there are signs of recovery for foreign trade from Jan-Feb period and that China’s foreign trade is resilient but also stated difficulties facing trade cannot be underestimated.</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>WTI (M0) SETTLED USD 1.86 LOWER AT USD 27.40/BBL; BRENT (M0) SETTLED USD 2.14 LOWER AT USD 29.60/BBL</strong></p><p>Crude futures reversed overnight strength, failing to benefit from a risk (Spooz) rally as participants digested the latest OPEC+ outcome amid normalising liquidity conditions. One Citigroup analyst suggests the downside is part due to the realisation that it may take some time for OPEC to cut production to the targeted levels, in addition to initial optimism fading. The market is awaiting to hear the outcome of the Texas regulators meeting on potential production cuts in the state, where a vote on a resolution could take place in a week’s time. The Texas RRC Chief Ryan Sitton has previously said that it was the duty of regulators to consider cuts; however, after the OPEC+ meeting, he has made more nuanced and tentative remarks. The calls for production cuts growth louder amid storage capacity testing its limits, Pioneer Natural Resources CEO is calling for production cuts in Texas and said Cushing storage would be full in four to five weeks, while Plains All American said US storage would be full by mid-May and producers are making changes, expecting 3-4mln bbls of oil to come off the US market (the last DoE weekly inventory report had production at 12.4mln BPD). Meanwhile, as it has previously suggested it would, the DoE said it is negotiating with nine oil companies to store around 23mln BPD of US-produced oil in its SPR; most deliveries to SPR will be received in May and June, some possible in April. Looking ahead, participants are awaiting the latest US energy inventories, where private data will be released on Tuesday evening ahead of the official EIA release on Wednesday.</p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 4+ TICKS HIGHER AT 138-07.</strong></p><p><strong>The TPLEX grinded higher through the session</strong>, despite an equity rally and amid returning liquidity conditions. The T-Note found support in APAC trade after a sell-off (in both equities and bonds) on Easter Monday, and liquidity helped to sustain the moves. Strong gains in the equity complex on Tuesday did little to change the dial either, with equities, gold and Treasuries rising in unison. Further, with the Fed paring back its daily purchases this week (average daily pace of USD 30bln vs 50bln last week), the appetite for USTs remains strong. The strength could be a function of equity hedges, as some desks view the stock market’s retracement as reaching peak “realistic” levels with corporate earnings depressed: BofA’s FMS recommended taking profits in the SPX between 2,850-3,000; survey respondents also noted long US Treasuries as the most crowded trade. Investors may also have been discomforted by the IMF’s latest gloomy assessment of the global economy on track to suffer the worst since the Depression. Additionally, JPMorgan’s and Wells Fargo’s Q1 earnings reports both caught participants off-guard with the extent of their loan provisions, shining a light on the extent of financial pain the wider economy is facing. However, the fiscal and monetary backstops being implemented will limit such extremes. By settlement, major spreads were slightly steeper, 2s -2bps at 0.22%, 10s unchanged at 0.75% and 30s +2 at 1.41%.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +3.02% at 2845, NDX +4.31% at 8692, DJIA +2.39% at 23950.</p><p><strong>SECTORS: </strong>Cons Stpl +4.23%, Cons Disc +4.19%, Technology +4.17%, Health +3.31%, Real Estate +3.25%, Communication Svs +3.23%, Utilities +2.98%, Industrials +1.89%, Materials +1.15%, Financials +0.33%, Energy -0.46%.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: JP Morgan (JPM)</strong> saw a heavy EPS miss although it built credit reserves which amounted to USD 6.8bln, USD 8.3bln in loan provisions, impacting EPS by USD 1.66/shr. Revenue also fell short of expectations. Net Interest Income (NII) &amp; Net Interest Margin (NIM) however were firmer than analyst expectations, although expects Q2 NII at USD 13.7bln, beneath street estimates, and it cut FY NII view to USD 55.5bln from USD 57bln. JPM maintained its dividend of USD 0.90/shr, and its CFO highlighted the bank remains committed to its dividend payments amid the coronavirus outbreak. JPM saw strong Equity and FICC revenues, while investment banking revenue was down 49% (lower advisory fees largely offset higher debt and equity underwriting fees). <strong>Wells Fargo (WFC)</strong> also saw a heavy EPS miss at USD 0.01/shr (exp. 0.72/shr) amid credit provisions, where it took a 0.73/shr impact from its reserve builds and impairment of securities, similar to JPM. Elsewhere, <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)</strong> reported a solid EPS above analyst expectations, as was revenue. It increased its quarterly dividend to USD 1.01/shr, a 6.3% increase. Its Imbruvica, Remicade and Darzalex beat expectations; however, Zytiga sales were slightly short. JNJ noted, “consumer Health results across the majority of franchises were positively impacted by the increased demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic”. At the same time, worldwide medical device sales fell 4.8%, the only declining segment. Its CFO later stated it sees a USD 4-7bln negative impact to operational sales in medical devices this year due to the coronavirus. <strong>Skyworks (SWKS)</strong> Q2 revenue was firmer than expectations and expects non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in line with prior guidance. Does not expect the temporary closure of its Mexicali operation, and it does not expect this temporary shutdown to have an impact on business operations.</p><p><strong>STOCK NEWS: Apple Inc (AAPL)</strong> shipped approximately 2.5mln iPhones in China, a slight rebound from the prior month, which was one of the worst in history. Elsewhere, its partnership with <strong>Google (GOOG)</strong> to help tackle COVID-19 has reportedly faced criticism from US President Trump who claims the technology poses big constitutional problems for a lot of people, according to Business Insider. <strong>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)</strong> raised USD 9.5bln in new debt on Monday in a five-part issuance, ranging from 5-31 years (it initially planned to raise USD 9bln). <strong>Disney (DIS)</strong> entered a USD 5bln credit pact. <strong>Roku (ROKU)</strong> withdrew guidance but expects revenue in Q1 above expectations with active accounts +3mln Q/Q. <strong>Boeing (BA)</strong> announced it had 150 737 MAX orders cancelled, while Q1 net cancellations at 307. Citron Research labels <strong>GSX (GSX)</strong> a fraud, more so than Luckin Coffee (LK) <strong>Tesla (TSLA)</strong> made double-digit gains on a Morgan Stanley upgrade.</p><p><strong>CASH LEVELS:</strong> BofA’s monthly Fund Manager Survey showed, in April, extreme pessimism among investors, with cash levels at funds raised to 5.9% (vs prev. 5.1%) which marks the highest level since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In terms of economic recovery: 52% believes it’ll be a “U” shape; 22% say a “W” shape; 15% say “V” shaped. Separately, earnings reports from JPM and WFC this morning painted a similar picture with both banks taking chunky hits to their bottom line due to significant credit provisions. BofA sees potential for another leg higher due to bearish positioning, and as of such, recommends taking profits between 2850-3000 on the SPX. More specifically, BofA says investors are very long cash, healthcare, staples, utilities, US, tech, and bonds, while very short energy, equities, materials, industrials, UK, banks, and Eurozone.</p><h2>FOREX</h2><p><strong>USD:</strong> The buck continues to lose ground amid easing funding pressures, with the Fed last night scaling back its overnight repo operations back to once a day (from May) given the recent lack of take-up. DXY broke beneath the 99 handle this morning bought on by strength in EUR, JPY and GBP. Positive sentiment was seen overnight and in the morning session, aided by positive comments from US President Trump about the reopening of the economy, while China trade data was better than expected. While in the afternoon, further positive developments from New York were welcomed. ING noted that cross-market indicators could suggest the greenback has topped out, noting if the story were to stay ripe combined with an improvement in commodity markets, we might start to see the emergence of the risk on, dollar off trend.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> Firmer as UK/EU returned from Easter break while benefiting from downside in the dollar. Cases in Italy continue to show some sign of plateau while France yesterday extended its lockdown period to May 11th. Today sources suggest that France will be increasing the cost of its crisis response package to EUR 110bln from EUR 100bln.</p><p><strong>GBP &amp; AUD:</strong> Cable continued its post-Boris ICU exit rally and crossed 1.26 to the upside despite the expectation for the lockdown to be extended until May 7th. Analysts at Lloyd’s expect Cable to be limited to the upside for another corrective pullback and highlights resistance at 1.2710. AUD saw similar trading to GBP given both are risk-sensitive currencies with an improvement in sentiment recently; both are continuing their march higher against the dollar amid an easing of dollar funding pressures also adding to the upside.</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The loonie traded rather flat against the greenback, with any upside likely limited amid falling oil prices in the session. Elsewhere, Canada’s virus cases and deaths, unfortunately, picked up in pace on Tuesday, while PM Trudeau noted it would soon have an announcement about a package to assist the oil and gas industry. Scotia bank believes “CAD is rather driven by short term flows and broader market risk appetite for now and pro-risk sentiment should curb losses near-term. We also rather think that valuation considerations may be weighing on the USD to some extent; history suggests USD gains above 1.40 are hard to sustain for lengthy periods of time.” Participants will be eyeing the BoC policy meeting on Wednesday, which will be Governor Poloz’s last meeting.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The bid continued, but USDJPY remained just above the 107 figures. Risk on Tuesday started on the front foot however a slight reversal was seen with equities trailing off highs. Analysts have highlighted risk reversal FX options for USDJPY hold its highest downside risk premium since 2009.</p><p><strong>XAU:</strong> The precious metal was bid once again and remains above the 1700 figure around 1735 at pixel time. ING suggest gold could go a lot higher and the recent rally adds to the argument that this crisis is unlikely to be a deflationary one due to efforts from the Fed, given gold is “the classic inflation hedge”, the bank also highlights the 5Y5Y inflation swap and inflation-indexed Treasuries have rebounded.</p><p><strong>ZAR:</strong> The Rand underperformed amid an emergency 100bp rate cut from the SARB with the governor noting there is further space for the MPC to respond with additional easing, adding he sees USDZAR averaging 17.80 this year. Elsewhere, troubled South African Airways denied any further funding from the government, and the South African Public Enterprises ministry announced it is continuing to explore options for South African Airways with urgency.</p><p><strong>TRY:</strong> The lira also weaker against the buck amid continued coronavirus spread and a lowering of FX swap limits from over the weekend, where the limit for banks’ foreign-exchange swap, forward and option transactions with foreign entities is now at 1% of a bank’s equity (Prev. 10%).</p>",

Elsewhere, Canada’s virus cases and deaths, unfortunately, picked up in pace on Tuesday, while PM Trudeau noted it would soon have an announcement about a package to assist the oil and gas industry. Scotia bank believes “CAD is rather driven by short term flows and broader market risk appetite for now and pro-risk sentiment should curb losses near-term. We also rather think that valuation considerations may be weighing on the USD to some extent; history suggests USD gains above 1.40 are hard to sustain for lengthy periods of time.” Participants will be eyeing the BoC policy meeting on Wednesday, which will be Governor Poloz’s last meeting.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> The bid continued, but USDJPY remained just above the 107 figures. Risk on Tuesday started on the front foot however a slight reversal was seen with equities trailing off highs. Analysts have highlighted risk reversal FX options for USDJPY hold its highest downside risk premium since 2009.</p><p><strong>XAU:</strong> The precious metal was bid once again and remains above the 1700 figure around 1735 at pixel time. ING suggest gold could go a lot higher and the recent rally adds to the argument that this crisis is unlikely to be a deflationary one due to efforts from the Fed, given gold is “the classic inflation hedge”, the bank also highlights the 5Y5Y inflation swap and inflation-indexed Treasuries have rebounded.</p><p><strong>ZAR:</strong> The Rand underperformed amid an emergency 100bp rate cut from the SARB with the governor noting there is further space for the MPC to respond with additional easing, adding he sees USDZAR averaging 17.80 this year. Elsewhere, troubled South African Airways denied any further funding from the government, and the South African Public Enterprises ministry announced it is continuing to explore options for South African Airways with urgency.</p><p><strong>TRY:</strong> The lira also weaker against the buck amid continued coronavirus spread and a lowering of FX swap limits from over the weekend, where the limit for banks’ foreign-exchange swap, forward and option transactions with foreign entities is now at 1% of a bank’s equity (Prev. 10%).</p>",

One Citigroup analyst suggests the downside is part due to the realisation that it may take some time for OPEC to cut production to the targeted levels, in addition to initial optimism fading. The market is awaiting to hear the outcome of the Texas regulators meeting on potential production cuts in the state, where a vote on a resolution could take place in a week’s time. The Texas RRC Chief Ryan Sitton has previously said that it was the duty of regulators to consider cuts; however, after the OPEC+ meeting, he has made more nuanced and tentative remarks. The calls for production cuts growth louder amid storage capacity testing its limits, Pioneer Natural Resources CEO is calling for production cuts in Texas and said Cushing storage would be full in four to five weeks, while Plains All American said US storage would be full by mid-May and producers are making changes, expecting 3-4mln bbls of oil to come off the US market (the last DoE weekly inventory report had production at 12.4mln BPD). Meanwhile, as it has previously suggested it would, the DoE said it is negotiating with nine oil companies to store around 23mln BPD of US-produced oil in its SPR; most deliveries to SPR will be received in May and June, some possible in April. Looking ahead, participants are awaiting the latest US energy inventories, where private data will be released on Tuesday evening ahead of the official EIA release on Wednesday.</li></ul>",

Having failed to glean any real traction after the 3 day US holiday weekend, downside pressure has gradually increased with the return of European markets from their extended Easter break and a general recovery in risk appetite, albeit not across the board or to the extent that other safe-havens are unable to take advantage of Greenback weakness.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling has overcome earlier wobbles caused by renewed coronavirus concerns to breach its 50 DMA vs the Buck and test the resolve of offers around 1.2600 ahead of technical resistance close to mid-March highs, like the 200 DMA. However, as the UK Government is widely expected to extend lockdown until May 7 at the earliest, OBR projections based on a 3 month shutdown of the economy are understandably bleak for Q2 with GDP seen sliding 35% and unemployment rising in excess of 2 mn to 10%.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>The next best major performers, with the Franc probing above 0.9600 and Euro eclipsing yesterday’s best to open up 1.1000 even though Eur/Chf has slipped through 1.0550. Latest COVID-19 updates are somewhat conflicting given more signs that daily rates of contamination are easing in Spain vs a less conclusive death count, but the Health Minister highlight the former as evidence of curve flattening. Meanwhile, intervention in Switzerland has accelerated again if weekly bank deposit balances are an accurate gauge of SNB activity, but to little avail given the Chf’s relative strength, and it’s a similar story for the Yen that is eyeing 107.00 irrespective of latest sourced reports about the BoJ upping and extending asset purchases alongside the range suitable to be used for collateral.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD/NOK</strong></p><p>Contrasting sessions for the Aussie, Kiwi, Loonie and Norwegian Crown as the former retains momentum and tabs on the 0.6400 level in wake of an encouraging Chinese Yuan export component within the trade balance, but its Antipodean counterpart fails to sustain 0.6100+ status ahead of NZ food prices. Elsewhere, a sharper retreat in crude prices has undermined the Cad and Nok before the BoC policy meeting on Wednesday – primer available via our headline feed at 13.16BST.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Bucking the overall trend of appreciation or at least staying on an even keel with the Usd, Zar losses have intensified to 18.3900 or so since the SARB decided to deliver an emergency 100 bp ease and signal downside risks to inflation that could warrant more rate cuts depending on economic developments. Similarly, the Try has fallen against the grain, though on a combination of factors including lower FX swap limits, the ongoing spread of the coronavirus and attempted resignation of Turkey’s Interior Minister over the extended lockdown.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>MACRO: </strong>Equity markets are on the front foot after gains in Asia sustained through into the European session. President Trump said a plan was close to being completed for reopening the economy, and was hopefully ahead of schedule, but otherwise, the narrative remains little changed this morning. Note that markets were lower on Monday, with US indices exhibiting strong negative breadth and the R2K leading losses, although liquidity was poor due to the holiday period, where the strength this morning in both prices and volume paints a more risk-friendly picture. However, investors are cautious amid earnings about just how much further valuations can stretch. More broadly, rates are little changed on sovereign curves this morning, with gold firmer on the back of a weaker US dollar. Meanwhile, front-month crude futures have been trundling lower, reversing earlier gains.</li><li><strong>SECTORS:</strong> All sectors open in positive territory with Technology and Consumer Discretionary outperforming. The latter is benefitting from a heavy rise in cruise operators as some of the prior day losses are reversed, which was induced from the 100 day “No Sail Order” extension. Financials in the middle but up over 2.5% after decent gains in JP Morgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) after earnings. Energy at the bottom of the pack, however still up over 1% ahead of the Texas railroad commissioner meeting (click here for our primer), gains in the sector however are likely capped with downside in oil prices, hence the relative underperformance.</li><li><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>JP Morgan (JPM) saw a heavy EPS miss although it built credit reserves which amounted to USD 6.8bln, costs USD 8.3bln and impacting EPS by USD 1.66/shr. Revenue also fell short of expectations. Net Interest Income (NII) &amp; Net Interest Margin (NIM) however were firmer than analyst expectations and it expects Q2 NII at USD 13.7bln beneath street estimates, while it cut FY NII view to USD 55.5bln from USD 57bln. JPM declared a dividend of USD 0.90/shr, and its CFO highlighted the bank remains committed to its dividend payments amid the coronavirus outbreak. JPM saw strong Equity and FICC revenues, while investment banking revenue was down 49%, higher debt and equity underwriting fees were largely offset by lower advisory fees. Wells Fargo (WFC) also saw a heavy EPS miss at USD 0.01/shr (exp. 0.72/shr) as it took a 0.73/shr impact from its reserve builds of and impairment of securities, similar to JPM.

Conversely, Gilts retreated a tad further to a minor new Liffe low at 136.69 even though US Treasuries are inching higher ahead of the Wall Street open, and higher BoE offer/cover ratios at the first 2 buy-backs may be keeping the 10 year UK benchmark suppressed. Meanwhile, the Dollar has succumbed to more downside vs major counterparts with the index dipping below 99.000 as Eur/Usd eclipsed yesterday’s best and Cable climbed over the 50 DMA to hit 1.0976 and 1.2587 respectively. For the record firmer than forecast, albeit still negative, US import export prices hardly registered, but bleak IMF GDP projections raised eyebrows even though they may be premature and prove wide of the mark at this still extremely formative stage of the coronavirus fallout.</p>",

The forecasts assume the virus will mostly peak in Q2 2020, and then fade in H2, with lockdown measures to be gradually unwound. It then sees a sharp rebound in 2021, pencilling in global growth of 5.8%. The updated projections came with large caveats around the uncertainty surrounding the outlook, and it said the 2021 recovery was “only partial as the level of economic activity is projected to remain below the level we had projected for 2021, before the virus hit.”</p>",

(+1.6%)</strong> conformed to the regional optimism after the latest trade figures showed a much narrower than expected contraction in Exports and a surprise expansion to CNY-denominated Imports, although there were mixed comments from the customs bureau which noted there are signs of recovery for China’s foreign trade which is resilient but also warned of increasing uncertainties and that trade is encountering larger difficulties which cannot be underestimated. On the coronavirus front, China recently approved 2 experimental coronavirus vaccines to enter clinical trials and Beijing was said to have resumed all of the city’s 2130 major construction projects. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued in tandem with the downside in T-notes amid gains in riskier assets, but with losses stemmed after somewhat improved demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for long to super-long JGBs.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral on the day.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European equities remain mostly firm following a broad pickup in sentiment across APAC and US regions, </strong>with the former also aided by better-than-forecast Chinese trade data overnight. That being said, eyes turn to the resumption of earning season to gauge the initial impact of the virus outbreak on large-cap businesses. For reference, states-side earnings today include Johnson &amp; Johnson (4.1% weighting in DJIA), JP Morgan (2.9% weighting in DJIA) and Wells Fargo. Back to Europe, UK’s FTSE 100 (-0.4%) lags regional peers as a firmer Sterling weighs on exporters, whilst reports also noted that the UK gov’t is poised to extend its lockdown to May 7th, although some reports over the weekend touted May 25th. Other European bourses see broad-based gains, with some possibly underpinned by comments from EU’s Competition Chief Vestager, who said member countries should purchase stakes in companies to repel the threat of Chinese takeovers. Broader sectors are somewhat mixed with underperformance in the Energy Sector, whilst Healthcare names lead the gains thus far. The sector breakdown does not give much by way of additional colour, although Travel &amp; Leisure resume its downbeat performance as the sectors see no reprieve for the near future, whilst Carnival (-7.0%) sees pressure after the group is to extend its suspension on North American cruises. In terms of individual movers; AstraZeneca (+6.0%) props up the healthcare sector as shares were bolstered at the open after the Co. said its Tagrisso Adjuvant trial has been overwhelmingly positive. Separately, Co’s Koselugo has been approved in the US for paediatric patients with a rare genetic condition. Finally, the Co. has also initiated the Calavi clinical trials with Calquence against COVID-19. Renault (+3.0%) remains firm despite a cancellation to FY19 dividend after the Co. is to transfer its 50% stake in Dongfeng Renault to Dongfeng in a non-binding memorandum. Publicis (-0.3%) saw losses at the open after reporting that organic revenue dell 2.9% YY, although the Co. launched a EUR 500mln cost reduction plan. Accor (-2%) saw early-morning pressure after French Finance Minister Le Maire said he cannot say when hotels and restaurants will reopen. Note: Eurex and Deutsche Boerse have been experiencing technical problems that are being investigated.</p><p><strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson (Q1 20)</strong> (USD): Adj EPS 2.30 (est. 2.00/1.43 on a reported basis); Revenue 20.7bln (est. 19.48bln); boosts dividend 6.3% to 1.01/shr; lowers guidance to reflect COVID-19. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Dollar remains depressed after last Thursday’s mega Fed stimulus package and ramp up in Gold through the Usd1700/oz threshold to fresh 7 year peaks, with the DXY unable to regain a foothold above 99.500 within a 99.432-121 range amidst selective risk-on flows in wake of latest COVID-19 updates, the eventual OPEC+ crude output accord and Eurozone Finance Ministers finally agreeing on a substantial fiscal stimulus package. Ahead, US import export prices are scheduled, but unlikely to prompt much, if any reaction, but Wednesday’s data releases are top tier.</p><p><strong>GBP - </strong>The Pound is off best levels, but still the best performing G10 currency after UK PM Johnson’s discharge from hospital. Cable remains comfortably above the 1.2500 handle and briefly crossed the 50 DMA at 1.2568 to print a fresh 1.2575 recovery high before reports from the ONS emerged raising the number of fatalities in England and Wales by 15% vs NHS figures published to April 3rd, while Eur/Gbp is back above 0.8700 from circa 0.8784 at one stage awaiting revised GDP and deficit estimates from the OBR under various coronavirus scenarios due at 12.00BST.</p><p><strong>ZAR - </strong>In contrast to Sterling, Rand gains against the Buck were initially reversed from 18.0000+ to just shy of 18.2000 in wake of an unexpected 100 bp SARB rate cut that was announced via social media and came after May’s scheduled policy meeting was brought forward. However, Usd/Zar subsequently soared beyond 18.3300 as Central Bank Governor Kganyago</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF/AUD/NZD - </strong>All firmer vs the Greenback, as the Yen defies improved risk sentiment to hold at the upper end of 107.79-39 parameters, but not quite close enough to disturb decent option expiry interest protecting 107.00 at 107.05 (1.1 bn). Note, no real rection to latest BoJ source talk about increased and wider QE remits at this month’s meeting that might include expanding the range of assets accepted for collateral. Similarly, the Euro is hovering closer to the top of 1.0957-06 confines and the Franc nearer 0.9637 than 0.9679 even though latest weekly Swiss sight deposits indicate significantly more intervention by domestic banks on behalf of the SNB. Elsewhere, some loss of overnight momentum forged on the back of Chinese trade revealing a surprise rise in Yuan denominated imports for the Aussie and Kiwi, but both retaining sight of big figure/psychological resistance marks at 0.6400 and 0.6100 respectively.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/SEK - </strong>In keeping with the rather muted response following knee-jerk relief in oil on the aforementioned OPEC+ pact, the Loonie is paring advances from around 1.3863 to sub-1.3900 as attention switches towards tomorrow’s BoC meeting and the prospect of downbeat/dovish guidance, assuming no further action. Meanwhile, the Norwegian Krona has also retreated from almost 11.1700 vs the Euro to 11.2800, but its Swedish peer showing a bit more resilience above 10.9000 due to signs of the case and death count from nCoV flattening.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- The Lira is struggling to contain losses below 5.7900 amidst heightened coronavirus contagion and the Turkish banking regulator slashing FX swap and derivative limits, while the already unstable political backdrop has been rocked by the resignation of the country’s Interior Minister.</p><p><strong>SARB cut rates to 4.25% (Prev. 5.25%) in an emergency decision</strong>, bringing their May meeting forward to do so. Decision saw some gradual depreciation of the ZAR as the decision was initially posted on SARB social media and as such took a while to circulate elsewhere.</p><p><strong>BoJ are reportedly to discuss taking further steps at this month's meeting</strong>, options include: increasing commercial paper and bond purchases, expanding assets that are accepted as collateral, according to sources. (Newswires)</p><p>Australian NAB Business Confidence (Mar) -66 (Prev. -4), record declines in conditions and confidence. (Newswires) Australian NAB Business Conditions (Mar) -21 (Prev. 0)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>In truth,&nbsp;UK&nbsp;debt&nbsp;and equivalents were already on divergent paths before a still unknown issue halted trade on Eurex (and the Deutsche Boerse incidentally), but with little external company or source of distraction given muted US Treasuries, price action on Liffe has virtually fizzled out. For the record,&nbsp;Gilts&nbsp;faded just ahead of 137.00 and drifted back down towards their very early 136.70 low before picking up fresh underlying bids and Bunds stopped at 170.84 between 170.28-90 parameters, as 10-year&nbsp;T-notes&nbsp;sit a tick under 138-06 overnight highs. Ahead, some lesser US data and Fed speak plus APIs</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI and Brent front-month futures reverse course after initially eking mild gains</strong> following the fallout of the OPEC+ and G20 ad-hoc meetings which failed to spur a rally but more-so stemmed declines in the complex (in the short-term at least). As a recap for European players, OPEC+ agreed to cut joint output by 9.7mln BPD, starting on 1 May 2020, for an initial period of two months that concludes on 30 June 2020. For the subsequent period of 6 months, from 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020, the total adjustment agreed will be 7.7mln BPD. It will be followed by a 5.8mln BPD cut from 1 January 2021 to 30 April 2022. The baseline for the calculation of the adjustments is the oil production of October 2018, except for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Russia, both with the same baseline level of 11.0mln BPD. The agreement will be valid until 30 April 2022; however, the extension of this agreement will be reviewed during December 2021. Saudi, UAE and Kuwait all pledged voluntary over-compliance, whilst G20 is to curtail output by some 3.7mln BPD. Yesterday, Saudi Aramco cut their OSPs for several grades for the second month in a row despite the output cut deal; albeit, OSPs for all grades to the US were raised. The Arab Light discount to Asia reflects the supply glut. Furthermore, Russian Energy Minister Novak said he met with domestic oil producers and they supported the OPEC+ deal, while he added that total oil output cuts in May-June will total between 15-20mln BPD. WTI straddled around USD 22.50/bbl in early trade before briefly dipping below USD 22/bbl, whilst Brent meanders just below USD 31.50/bbl, having confirmed to the modest sell-off during the session The difference between the contracts meanwhile remains wider to the tune of around USD 9.50/bbl vs. a pre-OPEC sub-5/bbl number. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> holds onto a bulk of yesterday’s gains and remains north of USD 1700/oz and near recently-set 7yr highs given USD weakness and as investors stock up on the yellow metal following the liquidity-induced declines last month. <strong>Coppe</strong>r meanwhile has given up the gains seen during the APAC session after Freeport-McMoRan said it will temporarily shut its Chino copper mine (produced 88k tons of copper in 2019) due to the virus outbreak, albeit the red metal remains caged in a narrow 2.3250-2.3480 band.</p><p>Oman informed its oil producing companies to reduce output by 200k bpd from May 1st for 2 months inline with the OPEC+ deal.

That being said, eyes turn to the resumption of earning season to gauge the initial impact of the virus outbreak on large-cap businesses. For reference, states-side earnings today include Johnson &amp; Johnson (4.1% weighting in DJIA), JP Morgan (2.9% weighting in DJIA) and Wells Fargo. Back to Europe, UK’s FTSE 100 (-0.4%) lags regional peers as a firmer Sterling weighs on exporters, whilst reports also noted that the UK gov’t is poised to extend its lockdown to May 7th, although some reports over the weekend touted May 25th. Other European bourses see broad-based gains, with some possibly underpinned by comments from EU’s Competition Chief Vestager, who said member countries should purchase stakes in companies to repel the threat of Chinese takeovers. Broader sectors are somewhat mixed with underperformance in the Energy Sector, whilst Healthcare names lead the gains thus far. The sector breakdown does not give much by way of additional colour, although Travel &amp; Leisure resume its downbeat performance as the sectors see no reprieve for the near future, whilst Carnival (-7.0%) sees pressure after the group is to extend its suspension on North American cruises. In terms of individual movers; AstraZeneca (+6.0%) props up the healthcare sector as shares were bolstered at the open after the Co. said its Tagrisso Adjuvant trial has been overwhelmingly positive. Separately, Co’s Koselugo has been approved in the US for paediatric patients with a rare genetic condition. Finally, the Co. has also initiated the Calavi clinical trials with Calquence against COVID-19. Renault (+3.0%) remains firm despite a cancellation to FY19 dividend after the Co. is to transfer its 50% stake in Dongfeng Renault to Dongfeng in a non-binding memorandum. Publicis (-0.3%) saw losses at the open after reporting that organic revenue dell 2.9% YY, although the Co. launched a EUR 500mln cost reduction plan. Accor (-2%) saw early-morning pressure after French Finance Minister Le Maire said he cannot say when hotels and restaurants will reopen. Note: Eurex and Deutsche Boerse have been experiencing technical problems that are being investigated.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>USD - The Dollar remains depressed after last Thursday’s mega Fed stimulus package and ramp up in Gold through the Usd1700/oz threshold to fresh 7 year peaks, with the DXY unable to regain a foothold above 99.500 within a 99.432-121 range amidst selective risk-on flows in wake of latest COVID-19 updates, the eventual OPEC+ crude output accord and Eurozone Finance Ministers finally agreeing on a substantial fiscal stimulus package. Ahead, US import export prices are scheduled, but unlikely to prompt much, if any reaction, but Wednesday’s data releases are top tier.</p><p>GBP - The Pound is off best levels, but still the best performing G10 currency after UK PM Johnson’s discharge from hospital. Cable remains comfortably above the 1.2500 handle and briefly crossed the 50 DMA at 1.2568 to print a fresh 1.2575 recovery high before reports from the ONS emerged raising the number of fatalities in England and Wales by 15% vs NHS figures published to April 3rd, while Eur/Gbp is back above 0.8700 from circa 0.8784 at one stage awaiting revised GDP and deficit estimates from the OBR under various coronavirus scenarios due at 12.00BST.</p><p>ZAR - In contrast to Sterling, Rand gains against the Buck were initially reversed from 18.0000+ to just shy of 18.2000 in wake of an unexpected 100 bp SARB rate cut that was announced via social media and came after May’s scheduled policy meeting was brought forward. However, Usd/Zar subsequently soared beyond 18.3300 as Central Bank Governor Kganyago</p><p>JPY/EUR/CHF/AUD/NZD - All firmer vs the Greenback, as the Yen defies improved risk sentiment to hold at the upper end of 107.79-39 parameters, but not quite close enough to disturb decent option expiry interest protecting 107.00 at 107.05 (1.1 bn). Note, no real rection to latest BoJ source talk about increased and wider QE remits at this month’s meeting that might include expanding the range of assets accepted for collateral. Similarly, the Euro is hovering closer to the top of 1.0957-06 confines and the Franc nearer 0.9637 than 0.9679 even though latest weekly Swiss sight deposits indicate significantly more intervention by domestic banks on behalf of the SNB. Elsewhere, some loss of overnight momentum forged on the back of Chinese trade revealing a surprise rise in Yuan denominated imports for the Aussie and Kiwi, but both retaining sight of big figure/psychological resistance marks at 0.6400 and 0.6100 respectively.</p><p>CAD/NOK/SEK - In keeping with the rather muted response following knee-jerk relief in oil on the aforementioned OPEC+ pact, the Loonie is paring advances from around 1.3863 to sub-1.3900 as attention switches towards tomorrow’s BoC meeting and the prospect of downbeat/dovish guidance, assuming no further action. Meanwhile, the Norwegian Krona has also retreated from almost 11.1700 vs the Euro to 11.2800, but its Swedish peer showing a bit more resilience above 10.9000 due to signs of the case and death count from nCoV flattening.</p><p>EM - The Lira is struggling to contain losses below 5.7900 amidst heightened coronavirus contagion and the Turkish banking regulator slashing FX swap and derivative limits, while the already unstable political backdrop has been rocked by the resignation of the country’s Interior Minister.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>In truth, <strong>UK</strong> <strong>debt</strong> and equivalents were already on divergent paths before a still unknown issue halted trade on Eurex (and the Deutsche Boerse incidentally), but with little external company or source of distraction given muted US Treasuries, price action on Liffe has virtually fizzled out. For the record, <strong>Gilts</strong> faded just ahead of 137.00 and drifted back down towards their very early 136.70 low before picking up fresh underlying bids and Bunds stopped at 170.84 between 170.28-90 parameters, as 10 year <strong>T-notes</strong> sit a tick under 138-06 overnight highs. Ahead, some lesser US data and Fed speak plus APIs</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures reverse course after initially eking mild gains following the fallout of the OPEC+ and G20 ad-hoc meetings which failed to spur a rally but more-so stemmed declines in the complex (in the short-term at least). As a recap for European players, OPEC+ agreed to cut joint output by 9.7mln BPD, starting on 1 May 2020, for an initial period of two months that concludes on 30 June 2020. For the subsequent period of 6 months, from 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020, the total adjustment agreed will be 7.7mln BPD. It will be followed by a 5.8mln BPD cut from 1 January 2021 to 30 April 2022. The baseline for the calculation of the adjustments is the oil production of October 2018, except for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Russia, both with the same baseline level of 11.0mln BPD. The agreement will be valid until 30 April 2022; however, the extension of this agreement will be reviewed during December 2021. Saudi, UAE and Kuwait all pledged voluntary over-compliance, whilst G20 is to curtail output by some 3.7mln BPD. Yesterday, Saudi Aramco cut their OSPs for several grades for the second month in a row despite the output cut deal; albeit, OSPs for all grades to the US were raised. The Arab Light discount to Asia reflects the supply glut. Furthermore, Russian Energy Minister Novak said he met with domestic oil producers and they supported the OPEC+ deal, while he added that total oil output cuts in May-June will total between 15-20mln BPD. WTI straddled around USD 22.50/bbl in early trade before briefly dipping below USD 22/bbl, whilst Brent meanders just below USD 31.50/bbl, having confirmed to the modest sell-off during the session The difference between the contracts meanwhile remains wider to the tune of around USD 9.50/bbl vs. a pre-OPEC sub-5/bbl number. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> holds onto a bulk of yesterday’s gains and remains north of USD 1700/oz and near recently-set 7yr highs given USD weakness and as investors stock up on the yellow metal following the liquidity-induced declines last month. <strong>Copper</strong> meanwhile has given up the gains seen during the APAC session after Freeport-McMoRan said it will temporarily shut its Chino copper mine (produced 88k tons of copper in 2019) due to the virus outbreak, albeit the red metal remains caged in a narrow 2.3250-2.3480 band.</p>",

Ahead, US import export prices are scheduled, but unlikely to prompt much, if any reaction, but Wednesday’s data releases are top tier.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The Pound is off best levels, but still the best performing G10 currency after UK PM Johnson’s discharge from hospital. Cable remains comfortably above the 1.2500 handle and briefly tested the 50 DMA at 1.2578 when printing a fresh 1.2575 recovery high before reports from the ONS emerged raising the number of fatalities in England and Wales by 15% vs NHS figures published to April 3rd, while Eur/Gbp is back above 0.8700 from circa 0.8784 at one stage awaiting revised GDP and deficit estimates from the OBR under various coronavirus scenarios due at 12.00BST.</p><p><strong>ZAR</strong></p><p>In contrast to Sterling, Rand gains against the Buck were initially reversed from 18.0000+ to just shy of 18.2000 in wake of an unexpected 100 bp SARB rate cut that was announced via social media and came after May’s scheduled policy meeting was brought forward. However, Usd/Zar subsequently soared beyond 18.3300 as Central Bank Governor Kganyago&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>All firmer vs the Greenback, as the Yen defies improved risk sentiment to hold at the upper end of 107.79-39 parameters, but not quite close enough to disturb decent option expiry interest protecting 107.00 at 107.05 (1.1 bn). Note, no real rection to latest BoJ source talk about increased and wider QE remits at this month’s meeting that might include expanding the range of assets accepted for collateral. Similarly, the Euro is hovering closer to the top of 1.0957-06 confines and the Franc nearer 0.9637 than 0.9679 even though latest weekly Swiss sight deposits indicate significantly more intervention by domestic banks on behalf of the SNB. Elsewhere, some loss of overnight momentum forged on the back of Chinese trade revealing a surprise rise in Yuan denominated imports for the Aussie and Kiwi, but both retaining sight of big figure/psychological resistance marks at 0.6400 and 0.6100 respectively.</p><p><strong>CAD/NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In keeping with the rather muted response following knee-jerk relief in oil on the aforementioned OPEC+ pact, the Loonie is paring advances from around 1.3863 to sub-1.3900 as attention switches towards tomorrow’s BoC meeting and the prospect of downbeat/dovish guidance, assuming no further action. Meanwhile, the Norwegian Krona has also retreated from almost 11.1700 vs the Euro to 11.2800, but its Swedish peer showing a bit more resilience above 10.9000 due to signs of the case and death count from nCoV flattening.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira is struggling to contain losses below 5.7900 amidst heightened coronavirus contagion and the Turkish banking regulator slashing FX swap and derivative limits, while the already unstable political backdrop has been rocked by the resignation of the country’s Interior Minister.</p>",

However, even though the 10 year Eurozone benchmark subsequently closed the gap to trade flat from pre-Easter Eurex closing levels before trading on the platform and the Deutsche Boerse hit tech glitches, Gilts have been 24 ticks above par and resuming their recent outperformance irrespective of overall risk appetite.

Yields were higher across the curve, and the shape of the curve was towards modest bear-steepening. However, the TPLEX was at odds with the cautious tone seen in other macro markets (equities down, crude mixed, gold to the best levels since 2012). Some desks had suggested that Treasuries were red due to positive comments by the CDC that the outbreak could peak this week. However, others have argued that the case counts/death tolls are now priced, with traders now focusing on when the economy re-opens, to what degree, and what shape the recovery will look like.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are positive across the board as sentiment begins to pick up from the holiday lull and with the region digesting the mostly better than expected Chinese trade data, but with gains somewhat capped heading into the start of US earnings season and as participants ponder how soon the US will reopen its economy. ASX 200 (+0.7%) is led by strength in gold miners after the precious metal surged above the USD 1700/oz level to its highest in more than 7 years and with Afterpay Touch Group among the biggest gaining stocks following a 105% Y/Y increase in its YTD underlying revenue, while Nikkei 225 (+2.0%) outperformed and briefly tested the 19500 level fuelled by favourable currency moves. Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) conform to the regional optimism after the latest trade figures showed a much narrower than expected contraction in Exports and a surprise expansion to Imports, although there were mixed comments from the customs bureau which noted there are signs of recovery for China’s foreign trade which is resilient but also warned of increasing uncertainties and that trade is encountering larger difficulties which cannot be underestimated. On the coronavirus front, China recently approved 2 experimental coronavirus vaccines to enter clinical trials and Beijing was said to have resumed all of the city’s 2130 major construction projects.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is softer overnight as the constructive risk appetite saps demand for safe havens which the greenback’s major counterparts have taken advantage of. This includes EUR/USD which extends its rebound from the near-term support level at 1.0900 heading into the return of European participants from the Easter break and GBP/USD briefly approached its 50-DMA of 1.2568 despite press reports the UK will announce a lockdown extension on Thursday to at least May 7th. Elsewhere, JPY-crosses are underpinned by the improved risk tone although USD/JPY fails to comply amid the USD-softness, while antipodeans benefit due to their high beta statuses and the surprise expansion in Chinese Imports, which saw AUD/USD and NZD/USD break through the prior day’s resistance and reclaim the 0.6400 and 0.6100 handles respectively.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued and track the similar downside in T-notes amid gains in riskier assets, with demand also hampered ahead of the enhanced liquidity auction for long to super-long JGBs.</p>",
