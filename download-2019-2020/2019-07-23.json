In related news, Politico suggested that US President Trump has yet to declare support for the budget/debt deal and that both parties had expected more forceful endorsement from Trump, Politico reportedly asked for clarification in which the White House did not answer although sources stated that President Trump is waiting to see how it plays out. (Newswires/Politico)</p><p>US Existing Home Sales Jun 5.27M vs. Exp. 5.33M (Prev. 5.34M, Rev. 5.36M). (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Stocks moved higher/Treasuries lower on the news that USTR Lighthizer is to lead a trade team to China on Monday. The dollar spent the day marching higher after the Democrats agreed to the suspension of the debt ceiling which will be supportive of fiscal spending in the near-term; consequentially, gold fell lower on the day. Crude had a late-day rally after it was reported EU states had shown support for a UK-France lead Strait of Hormuz security mission, with participants looking ahead to US energy inventories. Financials were bid whilst the utilities sector underperformed, with trader chatter speculating that banks were being bought on slightly higher rates. Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) were both supported on the news the former is looking to purchase the latter’s smartphone modem chip business for USD 1bln. General Electric (GE) advanced after positive Gordon Haskett comments; they expect the co. to beat its own industrial FCF guidance for Q2. Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD) fell after the co.’s promising schizophrenia treatment slipped up in late-stage studies. Snap Inc (SNAP) was buoyed after the co. was upgraded at Stifel and received positive comments at Rosenblatt. S&amp;P 500 0.7% AT 3005, NASDAQ-100 0.6% AT 7955, DOW JONES 0.7% AT 27349.</p><p>The T-plex was choppy throughout the Asian and European session before heading lower amid news US trade negotiators will be heading to China on Monday. Treasuries came under pressure going into the US equity open as equity futures pressed higher, with analysts also highlighting the large amount of corporate issuance in the day’s pipeline contributing to the selling. However, bidding was supported shortly after with gratitude to a disappointing US June existing home sales print alongside a multi-year low reading in the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index. Selling resumed going into the 2-year auction, which recorded its first tail (0.2bps) in 2019 on a B/C ratio of 2.5x (prev. 2.8x); primary dealers also took an increased share of 31.6%, more-or-less in line with its 5-auction average. The T-Note fell to fresh lows later as it was announced USTR Lighthizer would be heading to China on Monday for face-to-face meetings with Chinese officials. At settlement, spreads across the curve were little changed with the 10-year yield up by approximately 2.5bps. US T-note futures (U9) settled 7+ ticks lower at 127-11+.</p>",

The dollar spent the day marching higher after the Democrats agreed to the suspension of the debt ceiling which will be supportive of fiscal spending in the near-term; consequentially, gold fell lower on the day. Crude had a late-day rally after it was reported EU states had shown support for a UK-France lead Strait of Hormuz security mission, with participants looking ahead to US energy inventories.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US trade negotiators, headed by USTR Lighthizer, will head to China on Monday for the first face to face trade talks between the two nations since the June G20 summit. Talks are slated to last until Wednesday. NEC Director Kudlow said that China is making more agricultural purchases as a goodwill gesture, confirming earlier tweets from China’s Global Times Editor, who urged the US to “also honour the commitment” and act timely to lift sanctions on Huawei. On which note; US Commerce Secretary Ross said he would deal with Huawei waiver applications within the next few weeks. When asked if the US and China will make a deal, US President Trump, in familiar language, replied “we’ll see”.</p><p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>The<strong> </strong>UK has approached EU nations to join a European-led naval mission for safe shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, according to EU officials; France, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands have shown strong support. The officials suggested the mission could be run by a joint British-French naval command and would not involve the EU, Nato or the US. Germany, Spain, Sweden and Norway have also expressed interest in playing a role. Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif reiterated the country’s stance that UK PM May's seizure of the Grace 1 tanker is piracy at the behest of the US; Iran has since seized the UK’s Stena Impero tanker, sparking the UK maritime security measures. The US may have taken down more than one Iranian drone, CENTCOM Commander Gen. Kenneth McKenzie said on Tuesday in a CBS interview, who believes there could have been the “successful” downing of possibly greater than two drones; Iran has previously denied such claims.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Boris Johnson was elected as UK Conservative Leader, defeating Jeremy Hunt 66.4% to 33.6%, as was widely expected. Current PM May will hold her final PMQ’s tomorrow before meeting with the Queen to tender her resignation, after which Boris will deliver his first official speech as PM tomorrow at 1700BST before hosting his first cabinet meeting on Thursday morning at 0900BST (Note, the exact time and date of the inevitable cabinet reshuffle is yet TBC but will likely come on Thursday/Friday). The soon-to-be PM is unlikely to face an immediate no confidence vote in the government as opposition leader Corbyn awaits a more opportune time, perhaps after summer, a HuffPost report suggested. EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier responded to Johnson’s victory, tweeting “we look forward to working constructively with PM Johnson, to facilitate the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement... also to rework the agreed Declaration on a new partnership...”. However, the BBC’s Adler suggested that EU leaders will only be forthcoming with amendments if they are deemed to be workable and are not willing to accept whatever Boris Johnson might demand.</p><p><strong>* IMF WORLD ECONOMIC FORECASTS: </strong>The IMF cut its global growth forecast by 0.1ppt to 3.2% for 2019 and by 0.1ppt to 3.5% for 2020, in what was the fourth downgrade since December 2018. For Eurozone; it left its 2019 growth forecast unchanged at 1.3% but raised its 2020 forecast to 1.6%. For the US; it raised its 2019 growth forecast to 2.6% and left its 2020 forecast unchanged at 1.9%. For emerging markets/developing economies; it cut its growth forecast to 4.1% in 2019 and 4.7% in 2020. For trade: the IMF cut its forecast for growth in global trade volume by 0.9ppt to 2.5% for 2019 and lowered its 2020 forecast 0.2ppt to 3.7%. The IMF noted that downside risks have intensified since the April forecast, including an escalation in trade and technology tensions.</p><p><strong>* BOE: </strong>On policy/rates; BoE’s Haldane said he would be cautious about monetary policy loosening, barring a sharp economic downturn and with the economic road ahead potentially forking, the case for holding rates until the road becomes clearer is strong. Haldane noted that in practice, as the MPC has emphasised, the actual path of interest rates in the event of either Brexit outcome would never be automatic, before adding the market path of interest rates is not an accurate reflection of the most likely path of interest rates. He also added that acting early with a rate hike would ensure against the need for larger hikes in the future and suggested the time is approaching for when a small increase in rates would be prudent. On the economy; Haldane said that despite some Brexit-related volatility quarter-to-quarter, underlying UK growth remains fairly steady, if not spectacular, at a fraction below its cruising altitude. BoE’s Saunders said the BoE is not bound by forecasts implying rate hikes, that a no-deal Brexit would push GBP lower and that the UK economy is weak and clearly not overheating.</p><p><strong>* SPAIN: </strong>The Spanish parliament rejected the appointment of PSOE’s Sanchez as PM in the first vote, as expected. He failed to reach a supermajority, where all lawmakers are required to vote, therefore a vote on 25th July will take place where a simple majority will be needed for Sanchez to win (lawmakers are able to abstain if they please). A simple majority requires more than 50% of all casted votes which ING notes is potentially easier to obtain but is most certainly not set in stone as the relationship with Podemos remains difficult. If the simple majority is not reached, the country will likely hold its fourth general election in four years. The PSOE needs support from Podemos, which wants key cabinet roles within a new government, whereas Sanchez has thus far not been willing to concede any of the top jobs.</p><p><strong>* SOUTH KOREA/RUSSIA:</strong> South Korean fighter jets fired warnings shots at a Russian reconnaissance plane after it entered South Korean air space during the Asian session, South Korea announced; South Korea’s National Security Adviser said it would take a stronger action if the airspace violations continue. The Russian Defence Ministry later said that the South Korean jets crossed the path of the Russian planes over neutral waters and created a threat to Russia. The Russian planes were reportedly conducting their first ever joint air patrol with China.</p><p><strong>* FIVE-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> SocGen's analysts say the five-year sector lacks clear set up from a relative-value perspective, with current 5s trading cheap in asset swap vs older 5s, and it also trades rich on the curve vs 2s and 10s. That said, SocGen notes that the current 5 trades slightly special in repo, and SocGen says that combined with the relatively low dealer holdings, as well as the fact that the current when-issued yield for the sector is a tad above the last month’s auction stop, will benefit the auction. SocGen says it has a positive bias going into the auction.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 7+ TICKS LOWER AT 127-11+: </strong>The T-plex was choppy throughout the Asian and European session before heading lower amid news US trade negotiators will be heading to China on Monday. Treasuries came under pressure going into the US equity open as equity futures pressed higher, with analysts also highlighting the large amount of corporate issuance in the day’s pipeline contributing to the selling. However, bidding was supported shortly after with gratitude to a disappointing US June existing home sales print alongside a multi-year low reading in the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index. Selling resumed going into the 2-year auction, which recorded its first tail (0.2bps) in 2019 on a B/C ratio of 2.5x (prev. 2.8x); primary dealers also took an increased share of 31.6%, more-or-less in line with its 5-auction average. The T-Note fell to fresh lows later as it was announced USTR Lighthizer would be heading to China on Monday for face-to-face meetings with Chinese officials. At settlement, spreads across the curve were little changed with the 10-year yield up by approximately 2.5bps.</p><p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 0.55 HIGHER AT USD 56.77/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (U9) SETTLE USD 57 HIGHER AT USD 63.83/BBL: </strong>Crude markets were trading choppy in the earlier session amid light news flow, with geopolitics neither escalating nor deescalating ahead of US energy inventories, until prices spiked close to settlement after EU officials announced strong support for a UK-France lead maritime security operation in the Persian Gulf. Elsewhere, Libya’s NOC reported that the El Sharara oilfield (300k BPD capacity) had returned to full production following the weekend’s force majeure, although the market is likely cautious going forward as the threat of sabotage in Libya looms alongside the civil unrest. Analysts at PVM highlight that the potential for material supply disruptions out of the Strait of Hormuz has kept a premium baked into energy markets, which remain above their lows on Friday before Iran seized a UK shipping vessel. Looking ahead to inventories, with the API reporting its data first after the bell, current expectations have crude stocks drawing 4mln bbls, gasoline drawing 0.7mln bbls, and distillates building 0.5mln bbls; Citigroup energy analysts see potential for risk of “dynamic swings” in the report due to the likely recovery of shipments in and out of the Gulf of Mexico amid the wind-down of Tropical Storm Barry.</p><p><strong>* US EXISTING HOME SALES: </strong>Existing home sales stood at 5.27mln in June, missing the expectations of 5.33mln, and also falling from the prior revised figure of 5.36mln, falling 1.7% MoM. BMO note on the net slightly disappointing figures it does not change the overall tone on the housing narrative. Wells Fargo also note that despite the drop, figures do remain fairly solid and the bank highlights that resales will remain on an upward trend throughout 2019 as a result of lower mortgage rates.</p><p><strong>* US RICHMOND FED: </strong>Richmond Fed massively missed expectations, reporting -12 when the consensus view was for +5, also much lower than the previously revised 2. The July reading was the lowest figure reported since January 2013 and BMO note it is the second lowest recording since the financial crisis. Pantheon Macroeconomics mention it was never likely to follow the increase in the Philly Fed index as the Philly Fed and empire state headlines are on general business conditions and that the Richmond Fed is the weighted average of orders, shipments and employment components, making it more prone to swings.</p><p><strong>* EU CONSUMER CONFIDENCE (FLASH): </strong>EU consumer confidence increased from -6.6 in June to -7.2 this month, beating expectations of -7.2, with consumers continuing to benefit from relatively low inflation, lower unemployment and higher wages, but that global economy concerns have had a negative impact on confidence for some time.&nbsp; ING suggests the household consumption outlook for Q3 is moderately positive and that this will not impact policymakers’ decision on Thursday at the ECB.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.7% AT 3005, NASDAQ-100 0.6% AT 7955, DOW JONES 0.7% AT 27349, SECTORS: </strong>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary 0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples 0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Energy 0.3%, S&amp;P 500 Financials 1.1%, S&amp;P 500 Health Care 0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Industrials 1.2%, S&amp;P 500 Information Technology 0.6%, S&amp;P 500 Materials 2%, S&amp;P 500 Telecommunication Services 0.3%, S&amp;P 500 Utilities -0.6%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> United Technologies (UTX) shares popped higher after the co. reported a beat on top and bottom lines and raised FY EPS guidance. Defence contractor peer Lockheed Martin (LMT) lagged, despite posting strong earnings. Coca-Cola Company (KO) was buoyed after the also beat top and bottom-line expectations. Fellow Dow component Travelers Companies Inc (TRV) lagged the index, after reporting mixed earnings, which included a miss on EPS but a beat on revenue. Notable other stocks benefitting from strong earnings; Hasbro Inc (HAS) beat on top and bottom lines, assisted by strong “Avengers” toy sales, Hexcel Corp (HXL) beat on EPS and raised guidance, with gains driven by the firm’s F-35 joint fighter programme, Biogen (BIIB) beat on top and bottom lines, with its Tecfidera drug driving gains, Quest Diagnostics (DGX) beat EPS and revenue expectations and backed guidance, Kimberly-Clark (KMB) beat on top and bottom line and raised guidance, JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU) beat on top and bottom lines, Avery Dennison Corp (AVY) beat on top line, slight miss on bottom, Celanese (CE) beat on top line and still sees path lofty to FY19 EPS goal, Harley-Davidson (HOG) posted a decent bottom line beat, Pentair plc (PNR) beat on EPS and revenue, Pulte Homes Inc. (PHM) posted mixed earning; beat on bottom line, mission the top, Sherwin Williams Co. (SHW) posted a decent EPS beat, Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK) higher despite EPS beat. Notable stocks suffering from poor earnings; Zions Bancorporation (ZION) missed on top and bottom lines and reported disappointing NIM, Cadence Design Systems Inc (CDNS) missed on revenue expectations, PACCAR Inc. (PCAR) missed on EPS but beat on revenue, Whirlpool (WHR) beat on top and bottom lines but revised lower FY19 free cash flow view.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Financials were bid whilst the utilities sector underperformed, with trader chatter speculating that banks were being bought on slightly higher rates. Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) were both supported on the news the former is looking to purchase the latter’s smartphone modem chip business for USD 1bln. General Electric (GE) advanced after positive Gordon Haskett comments; they expect the co. to beat its own industrial FCF guidance for Q2. Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD) fell after the co.’s promising schizophrenia treatment slipped up in late-stage studies. Snap Inc (SNAP) was buoyed after the co. was upgraded at Stifel and received positive comments at Rosenblatt.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> continued its recent grind higher on a confluence of positives; the prospect of fresh fiscal stimulus - Congressional Democrats last night agreed to a US debt ceiling suspension that would boost spending for two years; and weakness in major G10 counterparts. On which note; a pick up in European political risk (the possibility of Spanish and Italian elections), coupled with the recent Bund rally ahead of the ECB continue to drag <strong>EUR</strong> lower; EUR<strong>CHF</strong> and EURUSD broke convincingly below 1.1000 and 1.1200 (respectively) on Tuesday. <strong>NZD</strong> sunk overnight on reports that the RBNZ is looking at “unconventional” policy strategies, in contrast to earlier comments from RBA Assistant Governor Kent, who said the RBA was “a long way from unconventional policy”. Divergence in the two central bank views saw <strong>AUD</strong>NZD rally back to 1.0450 from the low 1.04s, however, both ultimately trade lower vs the buck, with traders at UBS suggesting the banks “will both eventually align when QE is on the table”. <strong>CAD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong> held up relatively well against the buck; USDCAD finding resistance at the top of its July 1.3020-1.3150 range and cable finding some stability around the 1.2450 mark in the wake of Boris Johnsons widely expected confirmation as UK conservative party leader. <strong>EMFX</strong> suffered as the buck advanced; <strong>TRY</strong> breached USD/5.7000, awaiting a US decision regarding sanctions and still weighing up how aggressive CBRT cuts will be on Thursday, while <strong>BRL</strong> saw downside on a soft inflation that only adds to BCB easing expectations.</p><p><strong>* BRL: </strong>CPI rose 0.1% M/M in July, as expected, while the Y/Y rate fell to 3.3% from 3.8% in May (also expected). Pantheon note that “the subpar economic recovery, the good performance of the BRL, the ample output gap, and favourable base effects will help to keep the headline rate under control”. At 3.3%, inflation currently sits well below the BCB’s 4.25% target, which supports the case for lower rates, the consultancy notes, who forecast a 50bps cut to the Selic rate next week. Also calling for a 50bps cut next week, BAML sees the Selic rate as low as 4.75% by the year’s end and on Tuesday downgraded its forecast for Brazilian GDP growth in 2019 &amp; 2020 to 0.7% and 1.7% respectively.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD</strong> continued its recent grind higher on a confluence of positives; the prospect of fresh fiscal stimulus - Congressional Democrats last night agreed to a US debt ceiling suspension that would boost spending for two years; and weakness in major G10 counterparts. On which note; a pick up in European political risk (the possibility of Spanish and Italian elections), coupled with the recent Bund rally ahead of the ECB continue to drag <strong>EUR</strong> lower; EURCHF and EURUSD broke convincingly below 1.1000 and 1.1200 (respectively) on Tuesday. Moreover, <strong>NZD</strong> sunk overnight on reports that the RBNZ is looking at “unconventional” policy strategies. This was in contrast to earlier comments from RBA Assistant Governor Kent, who said the RBA was “a long way from unconventional policy”. Divergence in the two central bank views saw <strong>AUD</strong>NZD rally back to 1.0450 from the low 1.04s, however, both ultimately trade lower vs the buck, with traders at UBS suggesting the banks “will both eventually align when QE is on the table”. <strong>CAD</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong> held up relatively well against the buck; USDCAD finding resistance at the top of its July 1.3020-1.3150 range and cable finding some stability around the 1.2450 mark in the wake of Boris Johnsons widely expected confirmation as UK conservative party leader. <strong>EMFX</strong> suffered as the buck advanced; <strong>TRY</strong> breached USD/5.7000, awaiting a US decision regarding sanctions and still weighing up how aggressive CBRT cuts will be on Thursday, while <strong>BRL</strong> saw downside on a soft inflation that only adds to BCB easing expectations.</p><p><strong>* BRL:</strong> CPI rose 0.1% M/M in July, as expected, while the Y/Y rate fell to 3.3% from 3.8% in May (also expected). Pantheon note that “the subpar economic recovery, the good performance of the BRL, the ample output gap, and favourable base effects will help to keep the headline rate under control”. At 3.3%, inflation currently sits well below the BCB’s 4.25% target, which supports the case for lower rates, the consultancy notes, who forecast a 50bps cut to the Selic rate next week. Also calling for a 50bps cut next week, BAML sees the Selic rate as low as 4.75% by the year’s end and on Tuesday downgraded its forecast for Brazilian GDP growth in 2019 &amp; 2020 to 0.7% and 1.7% respectively.</p>",

Elsewhere, Libya’s NOC reported that the El Sharara oilfield (300k BPD capacity) had returned to full production following the weekend’s force majeure, although the market is likely cautious going forward as the threat of sabotage in Libya looms alongside the civil unrest. Analysts at PVM highlight that the potential for material supply disruptions out of the Strait of Hormuz has kept a premium baked into energy markets, which remain above their lows on Friday before Iran seized a UK shipping vessel. Looking ahead to inventories, with the API reporting its data first after the bell, current expectations have crude stocks drawing 4mln bbls, gasoline drawing 0.7mln bbls, and distillates building 0.5mln bbls; Citigroup energy analysts see potential for risk of “dynamic swings” in the report due to the likely recovery of shipments in and out of the Gulf of Mexico amid the wind-down of Tropical Storm Barry.</p>",

USD 72bln is set to mature at the month-end settlement, net supply is implied ta USD 59bln. TD Securities notes that the Fed portfolio run-off has slowed to USD 15bln per month (versus USD 30bln per month previously); and with USD 21.5bln of the SOMA portfolio maturing at month-end, the Fed will add on USD 2.3bln to 2s, USD 2.3bln to 5s, and USD 1.8bn to 7s.</p><p><strong>* TWO-YEAR PREVIEW</strong>: Last cycle's 2s and 5s auction were digested well, and demand was firm; however, the 7s struggled, tailing by 1.9bps, as investment funds reined in their participation. TD Securities takes note of the recent rally in fixed income, which could result in softer demand this week. \"The market is now pricing 75bps of cuts in 2019 and another 30bp of easing in 2020,\" TD writes, \"However, given the Fed's dovish pivot and decelerating global growth momentum should continue to keep demand for safe havens elevated.\" Recent averages imply a 0.2bps stop-through at the 2s auction, with directs taking 18%, indirects taking 48%, leaving the total buyside bid at around 66%.</p>",

To recap, progress towards a 2 year budget deal between the White House and Congress and constructive developments on the US-China trade front have boosted the Usd, while counterpart currencies are feeling the backlash along with bearish impulses of their own.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Kiwi is now propping up the major league table all alone amidst talk of the RBNZ looking at non-standard policy alternatives to straight rate cuts, and with the technical landscape turning negative now that Nzd/Usd has recoiled through the 200 DMA at 0.6720 and is a whisker away from 0.6700. However, Aud/Nzd has not crossed 1.0450 as the Aussie teeters just above 0.7000 vs its US counterpart ahead of further RBA commentary this week (from Governor Lowe on Thursday). More immediately, NZ trade data should provide the Kiwi with a bit more independent direction.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>Also a victim of relative Usd strength, but the single currency trading defensively into looming key events, like Wednesday’s Eurozone PMIs and the ECB a day later as well. Moreover, concerns over heightened political stability in Spain and Italy have been justified to an extent by a first round defeat for Sanchez in Madrid. Eur/Usd is just holding above 1.1150 having declined through a series of chart supports since losing grip of 1.1200, while the Euro has now convincingly dropped below 1.1000 against the Franc to raise SNB eyebrows. Note, however, Usd/Chf is nearer the top of a 0.9852-19 range due to the aforementioned overarching Buck strength.</p><p><strong>CAD/JPY/GBP/NOK</strong></p><p>The Loonie is trying to stabilise after extending losses vs its US peer beyond multiple tech levels to 1.3164 at one stage, but the Yen has managed to contain its downside to circa 108.28, and just before daily tech markers at 108.31 and 108.37 amidst undulating risk sentiment outside the positive factors noted above. Conversely, Sterling only received a fleeting reprieve from confirmation that Boris Johnson saw off contender Jeremy Hunt to become the new Conservative Party leader and PM elect, with Cable back down towards a circa 1.2420 base, although the Pound is faring better vs the Euro closer to the bottom of a 0.9005-0.8955 band. Elsewhere, the Norwegian Crown has continued its correction with not support from soft crude prices pre-API and Eur/Nok picking up pace to peer over 9.7000 before drifting back down.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Usd/Try is sitting just off 5.7015 highs awaiting more on US sanctions and still weighing up how aggressive the CBRT will be come Thursday, while Usd/Brl has rallied to 3.7700+ after softer than forecast Brazilian inflation data and a BAML downgrade on BCB rates to 4.75% by year end from 5.50% previously, with the first 50 bp seen coming next week.</p>",

Finally, 10yr JGBs held near the prior day’s best levels following recent comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who stated that that it is not easy to continue powerful measures for a long time but suggested that with zero lower bound for short-term interest rates, it might be better to directly affect long-term rates through large-scale asset purchases. Today’s 40yr JGB auction also failed to spur any significant price moves, as the results were mixed in which the b/c declined from prior but saw higher accepted prices.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations but later announced to lend CNY 200bln through 1yr medium-term lending facility at 3.30% and CNY 297.7bln in 1yr targeted medium-term lending facility at 3.15%.

Politico suggests that US President Trump has yet to declare support for the budget/debt deal, both GOP and Dems have expected ore forceful endorsement from Trump, several sources said.

Sectors are mostly in the green with underperformance seen in defensive sectors (Healthcare -0.2%, Utilities -0.2%), whilst the material (+1.9%) and IT (+1.4%) sectors outperform. The latter has been supported by US’ performance yesterday, after chip names rallied on the back of reports that White House officials have agreed to meet tech executives in regard to the recent Huawei ban. Further fuel was added to the bullish fire as AMS (+1.0%) reported optimistic numbers and opened higher in excess of 8% amid a revision higher to its Q3 revenue guidance, albeit shares have come off highs. As such fellow chip names have received a tailwind, with the likes of STMicroelectronics (+3.2%), Dialog Semiconductor (+0.7%) and Infineon (+3.3%) all higher in sympathy. Elsewhere, Continental (+4.8%) extended on gains despite its profit warning (which dented US peers) as the group noted that its Q2 results (release on August 7th) should be relatively insulated from the revised guidance, meanwhile trader chatter notes that the profit warning was priced earlier this month after shares hit 6yr lows. Thus, European peers Michelin (+2.2%) and Pirelli (+6.1%) are higher in tandem. Another notable mover include DAX-heavyweight Daimler (+3.9%) which is buoyed amid news that China’s BAIC Investment has acquired a 5% stake in the Co. Finally, this morning saw earnings from UBS (+2.2%) who reported a beat on Q2 net (USD 1.39bln vs. Exp. USD 1.38bln), a 23% Y/Y rise in its investment arm’s adj. pretax operating profit, and the intention to spend up to USD 1bln on stock buyback this year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Greenback is firmer across the board on several factors including progress on a US debt limit extension and 2 year budget accord that would increase discretionary spending and may avert another Government shutdown. Additionally, President Trump has reportedly taken heed of tech sector concerns over Huawei and agreed to make licensing decisions in a timely manner, while Washington and Beijing looks set to resume trade negotiations in person following recent phone conversations and the truce reached at the G20. The DXY has duly extended gains above the 97.000 handle and the index is now eyeing its prior July peak (97.593) having breached 97.5000, with the aid of independent weakness in several basket components.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/NZD</strong> - The Pound continues to underperform on UK political and Brexit risk ahead of Conservative leadership vote results that are expected to confirm victory for Boris Johnson, but the latest downturn also coincided with dovish/downbeat comments from BoE’s Saunders (subsequently backed up by a dire CBI trends survey). Cable has now crossed last Thursday’s 1.2429 low and found some underlying bids ahead of 1.2400 where around 700 mn option expiries reside, while Eur/Gbp popped just above 0.9000 before the single currency retreated a bit further through 1.1200 vs the Buck. Eur/Usd has now slipped below support at 1.1188 and 1.1181 (June troughs) to test a key Fib retracement at 1.1178 in the run up to tomorrow’s Eurozone preliminary PMIs and Thursday’s ECB meeting when a 10 bp rate cut is seen as a 2 in 5 prospect compared to nearer evens yesterday. Elsewhere, the Kiwi has been undermined by overnight comments from the RBNZ asserting that research into unconventional policy measures has started, with Nzd/Usd not far off the 200 DMA (0.6720) vs 0.6750 at one stage and close to 0.6800 of late.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong> - Both succumbing to a recovery in risk appetite (albeit selective), with the Yen sub-108.00 again and pulling away from decent expiry interest at 107.95-108.00 (1 bn), but still some distance from offers touted between 108.40-60 and technical resistance in close proximity (50 and 55 DMAs at 108.50 and 108.61 respectively). Similarly, the Franc continues to respect 0.9800, but Eur/Chf is still hovering near 1.1000 amidst the aforementioned Euro weakness that is being exacerbated by Italian and Spanish political uncertainty.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD</strong> - Holding up a bit better than their G10 peers, but still posting losses against the Usd as the Aussie drifts back towards 0.7000 and is arguably only resisting a deeper reversal due to a sharp rebound in the Aud/Nzd cross to almost 1.0450 from sub-1.0400. Note, remarks from RBA Assistant Governor Kent have hardly impacted as he merely noted that the Aud would have been stronger without recent OCR cuts and global easing is constructive for Australia. Meanwhile, the Loonie has stemmed post-Canadian data losses circa 1.3140 and a few pips away from multi-tech levels including earlier monthly highs and a June low spanning 1.3144-51.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Some volatile trade for the Rand and Lira (once again), with Usd/Zar choppy between a 13.8570-9480 band on further confirmation that extra cash for Eskom is in the pipeline vs a warning from SA’s Finance Minister that initial pointers suggest that tax revenue may be considerably short of target for the 2019/20 fy. Conversely, Usd/Try has pared back within 5.7015-6700 parameters amidst a deterioration in Turkish consumer sentiment, and awaiting the US decision on sanctions before the CBRT delivers its verdict on rates on Thursday.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Not much more movement in <strong>Bunds</strong> or <strong>Gilts</strong> apart from the former edging up to a fresh Eurex intraday high bang in line with Monday’s 173.79 session peak, but still lagging a bit behind the latter after a solid 10 year DMO sale and significantly weaker than forecast CBI trends survey. However, widening differentials are much more apparent and pronounced at the Eurozone margins where Italian <strong>BTPs</strong> are outperforming Spanish Bonos or vice-versa pending the PM Sanchez confirmation vote that opposition party Podemos is expected to oppose. Meanwhile, US Treasuries remain slightly underwater and the curve is incrementally steeper ahead housing data, the Richmond Fed survey, APIs and the first of this week’s auctions.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Little to report on the energy front with <strong>WTI</strong>/<strong>Brent</strong> prices contained within a narrow intraday band above the 56/bbl and 63/bbl levels respectively. Revisiting fundamentals, analysts at UBS reaffirm that prices continue to be supported by geopolitical tensions after US sanctioned a state-sponsored Chinese oil trader due a deal involving Iranian oil. Elsewhere on the geopolitical landscape, tensions between Russia and South Korea emerged after the latter fired warning shots at a Russian military plane after it reportedly entered South Korean airspace. Russia has rebuffed these claims, stating that South Korean planes the path of Russian strategic bombers over neutral waters and posed a threat to Russia. Although direct implications may not be felt in the energy market, it’s worth keeping in mind that the addition of further geopolitical tensions could wobble investor sentiment in complex. Another factor to monitor is Venezuela, following its nationwide power outage yesterday which is likely to hit Venezuelan oil production. Meanwhile, <strong>gold</strong> prices have steadied following its overnight decline as the USD gained further ground above 97.50 in Asia-Pac hours, with some also noting profit taking in the yellow metal. <strong>Copper</strong> is little changed and tentative heading into key risk events later this week, whilst <strong>Dalian iron ore</strong> edged lower as the demand outlook for the base metal was dampened by anti-smog curbs in Tangshan, China’s largest steel-making city.</p>",

Sectors are mostly in the green with underperformance seen in defensive sectors (Healthcare -0.2%, Utilities -0.2%), whilst the material (+1.9%) and IT (+1.4%) sectors outperform. The latter has been supported by US’ performance yesterday, after chip names rallied on the back of reports that White House officials have agreed to meet tech executives in regard to the recent Huawei ban. Further fuel was added to the bullish fire as AMS (+1.0%) reported optimistic numbers and opened higher in excess of 8% amid a revision higher to its Q3 revenue guidance, albeit shares have come off highs. As such fellow chip names have received a tailwind, with the likes of STMicroelectronics (+3.2%), Dialog Semiconductor (+0.7%) and Infineon (+3.3%) all higher in sympathy. Elsewhere, Continental (+4.8%) extended on gains despite its profit warning (which dented US peers) as the group noted that its Q2 results (release on August 7th) should be relatively insulated from the revised guidance, meanwhile trader chatter notes that the profit warning was priced earlier this month after shares hit 6yr lows. Thus, European peers Michelin (+2.2%) and Pirelli (+6.1%) are higher in tandem. Another notable mover include DAX-heavyweight Daimler (+3.9%) which is buoyed amid news that China’s BAIC Investment has acquired a 5% stake in the Co. Finally, this morning saw earnings from UBS (+2.2%) who reported a beat on Q2 net (USD 1.39bln vs. Exp. USD 1.38bln), a 23% Y/Y rise in its investment arm’s adj. pretax operating profit, and the intention to spend up to USD 1bln on stock buyback this year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Greenback is firmer across the board on several factors including progress on a US debt limit extension and 2 year budget accord that would increase discretionary spending and may avert another Government shutdown. Additionally, President Trump has reportedly taken heed of tech sector concerns over Huawei and agreed to make licensing decisions in a timely manner, while Washington and Beijing looks set to resume trade negotiations in person following recent phone conversations and the truce reached at the G20. The DXY has duly extended gains above the 97.000 handle and the index is now eyeing its prior July peak (97.593) having breached 97.5000, with the aid of independent weakness in several basket components.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR/NZD</strong> - The Pound continues to underperform on UK political and Brexit risk ahead of Conservative leadership vote results that are expected to confirm victory for Boris Johnson, but the latest downturn also coincided with dovish/downbeat comments from BoE’s Saunders (subsequently backed up by a dire CBI trends survey). Cable has now crossed last Thursday’s 1.2429 low and found some underlying bids ahead of 1.2400 where around 700 mn option expiries reside, while Eur/Gbp popped just above 0.9000 before the single currency retreated a bit further through 1.1200 vs the Buck. Eur/Usd has now slipped below support at 1.1188 and 1.1181 (June troughs) to test a key Fib retracement at 1.1178 in the run up to tomorrow’s Eurozone preliminary PMIs and Thursday’s ECB meeting when a 10 bp rate cut is seen as a 2 in 5 prospect compared to nearer evens yesterday. Elsewhere, the Kiwi has been undermined by overnight comments from the RBNZ asserting that research into unconventional policy measures has started, with Nzd/Usd not far off the 200 DMA (0.6720) vs 0.6750 at one stage and close to 0.6800 of late.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong> - Both succumbing to a recovery in risk appetite (albeit selective), with the Yen sub-108.00 again and pulling away from decent expiry interest at 107.95-108.00 (1 bn), but still some distance from offers touted between 108.40-60 and technical resistance in close proximity (50 and 55 DMAs at 108.50 and 108.61 respectively). Similarly, the Franc continues to respect 0.9800, but Eur/Chf is still hovering near 1.1000 amidst the aforementioned Euro weakness that is being exacerbated by Italian and Spanish political uncertainty.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD</strong> - Holding up a bit better than their G10 peers, but still posting losses against the Usd as the Aussie drifts back towards 0.7000 and is arguably only resisting a deeper reversal due to a sharp rebound in the Aud/Nzd cross to almost 1.0450 from sub-1.0400. Note, remarks from RBA Assistant Governor Kent have hardly impacted as he merely noted that the Aud would have been stronger without recent OCR cuts and global easing is constructive for Australia. Meanwhile, the Loonie has stemmed post-Canadian data losses circa 1.3140 and a few pips away from multi-tech levels including earlier monthly highs and a June low spanning 1.3144-51.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Some volatile trade for the Rand and Lira (once again), with Usd/Zar choppy between a 13.8570-9480 band on further confirmation that extra cash for Eskom is in the pipeline vs a warning from SA’s Finance Minister that initial pointers suggest that tax revenue may be considerably short of target for the 2019/20 fy. Conversely, Usd/Try has pared back within 5.7015-6700 parameters amidst a deterioration in Turkish consumer sentiment, and awaiting the US decision on sanctions before the CBRT delivers its verdict on rates on Thursday.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Not much more movement in <strong>Bunds</strong> or <strong>Gilts</strong> apart from the former edging up to a fresh Eurex intraday high bang in line with Monday’s 173.79 session peak, but still lagging a bit behind the latter after a solid 10 year DMO sale and significantly weaker than forecast CBI trends survey. However, widening differentials are much more apparent and pronounced at the Eurozone margins where Italian <strong>BTPs</strong> are outperforming Spanish Bonos or vice-versa pending the PM Sanchez confirmation vote that opposition party Podemos is expected to oppose. Meanwhile, US Treasuries remain slightly underwater and the curve is incrementally steeper ahead housing data, the Richmond Fed survey, APIs and the first of this week’s auctions.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Little to report on the energy front with <strong>WTI</strong>/<strong>Brent</strong> prices contained within a narrow intraday band above the 56/bbl and 63/bbl levels respectively. Revisiting fundamentals, analysts at UBS reaffirm that prices continue to be supported by geopolitical tensions after US sanctioned a state-sponsored Chinese oil trader due a deal involving Iranian oil. Elsewhere on the geopolitical landscape, tensions between Russia and South Korea emerged after the latter fired warning shots at a Russian military plane after it reportedly entered South Korean airspace. Russia has rebuffed these claims, stating that South Korean planes the path of Russian strategic bombers over neutral waters and posed a threat to Russia. Although direct implications may not be felt in the energy market, it’s worth keeping in mind that the addition of further geopolitical tensions could wobble investor sentiment in complex. Another factor to monitor is Venezuela, following its nationwide power outage yesterday which is likely to hit Venezuelan oil production. Meanwhile, <strong>gold</strong> prices have steadied following its overnight decline as the USD gained further ground above 97.50 in Asia-Pac hours, with some also noting profit taking in the yellow metal. <strong>Copper</strong> is little changed and tentative heading into key risk events later this week, whilst <strong>Dalian iron ore</strong> edged lower as the demand outlook for the base metal was dampened by anti-smog curbs in Tangshan, China’s largest steel-making city.</p>",

Elsewhere, the Kiwi has been undermined by overnight comments from the RBNZ asserting that research into unconventional policy measures has started, with Nzd/Usd not far off the 200 DMA (0.6720) vs 0.6750 at one stage and close to 0.6800 of late.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Both succumbing to a recovery in risk appetite (albeit selective), with the Yen sub-108.00 again and pulling away from decent expiry interest at 107.95-108.00 (1 bn), but still some distance from offers touted between 108.40-60 and technical resistance in close proximity (50 and 55 DMAs at 108.50 and 108.61 respectively). Similarly, the Franc continues to respect 0.9800, but Eur/Chf is still hovering near 1.1000 amidst the aforementioned Euro weakness that is being exacerbated by Italian and Spanish political uncertainty.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>Holding up a bit better than their G10 peers, but still posting losses against the Usd as the Aussie drifts back towards 0.7000 and is arguably only resisting a deeper reversal due to a sharp rebound in the Aud/Nzd cross to almost 1.0450 from sub-1.0400. Note, remarks from RBA Assistant Governor Kent have hardly impacted as he merely noted that the Aud would have been stronger without recent OCR cuts and global easing is constructive for Australia. Meanwhile, the Loonie has stemmed post-Canadian data losses circa 1.3140 and a few pips away from multi-tech levels including earlier monthly highs and a June low spanning 1.3144-51.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Some volatile trade for the Rand and Lira (once again), with Usd/Zar choppy between a 13.8570-9480 band on further confirmation that extra cash for Eskom is in the pipeline vs a warning from SA’s Finance Minister that initial pointers suggest that tax revenue may be considerably short of target for the 2019/20 fy. Conversely, Usd/Try has pared back within 5.7015-6700 parameters amidst a deterioration in Turkish consumer sentiment, and awaiting the US decision on sanctions before the CBRT delivers its verdict on rates on Thursday.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Early Eurex price action is remarkably reminiscent to last Tuesday as the core Eurozone bond consolidates below another recovery high, albeit within a loftier 173.56-75 range vs yesterday’s 173.78 close and 173.79 session best. Core debt has lost a bit of momentum amidst a pick-up in risk sentiment on a number of factors, like US techs conversing with the White House in an effort to nail down Huawei restrictions, further progress towards a 2 year budget and spending deal and the likely resumption of face-to-face trade talks between top level negotiators from Washington and Beijing. However, geopolitical tensions remain elevated and ahead of preliminary PMIs and the ECB over the next 48 hours, today’s IMF WEO could underscore slowing global growth concerns in the run up to flash Eurozone consumer sentiment.</p>",

(+0.1%)</strong> were relatively indecisive and only edged marginal gains despite the encouraging trade-related reports in which US trade negotiators are likely to visit China next week for the first face-to-face meeting since the G20 and with China said to consider a plan to boost purchases of US soybeans, while the PBoC skipped open market operations but instead announced to lend CNY 200bln in 1yr MLF and CNY 297.7bln in 1yr targeted MLF loans. Finally, 10yr JGBs held near the prior day’s best levels following recent comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who stated that that it is not easy to continue powerful measures for a long time but suggested that with zero lower bound for short-term interest rates, it might be better to directly affect long-term rates through large-scale asset purchases. Today’s 40yr JGB auction also failed to spur any significant price moves, as the results were mixed in which the b/c declined from prior but saw higher accepted prices.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations but later announced to lend CNY 200bln through 1yr medium-term lending facility at 3.30% and CNY 297.7bln in 1yr targeted medium-term lending facility at 3.15%.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> saw mild losses as the greenback remained firm with the precious <strong>metal</strong> dipping below the neckline of a head and shoulder pattern in the 30min and 1hr charts, while <strong>copper</strong> was lacklustre with only minimal upside seen amid the cautious gains in its largest buyer China.</p><p>Libya’s Zawiya Oil Refinery (120k BPD) has reportedly been shut for two weeks due to power issues, according to sources.

ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) shrugged off a slow start to both trade higher with Australia led by tech as it tracks the outperformance of the sector stateside, while the Japanese benchmark outperforms as it coattails on currency moves. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are relatively indecisive despite the encouraging trade-related reports in which US trade negotiators are likely to visit China next week for the first face-to-face meeting since the G20 and with China said to consider a plan to boost purchases of US soybeans, while the PBoC skipped open market operations but instead announced to lend CNY 200bln in 1yr MLF and CNY 297.7bln in 1yr targeted MLF loans.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY extends on the prior day’s gains following a breakout from Monday’s thin ranges and as its major counterparts languish in which EUR/USD just about gave up the 1.1200 handle, and with GBP/USD subdued firmly below 1.2500 ahead of today’s Tory leadership and PM announcement in which a win by hardliner Brexiteer Boris Johnson is seen as a forgone conclusion. Elsewhere, USD/JPY rose above 108.00 as a function of the strength in the base currency and risk appetite, while antipodeans are kept lacklustre amid the firmer greenback, subdued metals complex and quiet calendar with NZD/USD also briefly ruffled by reports the RBNZ are looking at unconventional policy strategies.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they hold on to recent gains and following comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who stated that that it is not easy to continue powerful measures for a long time but also suggested that with zero lower bound for short-term interest rates, it might be better to directly affect long-term rates through large-scale asset purchases.</p>",
