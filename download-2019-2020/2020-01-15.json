President Trump also stated they are leaving tariffs on so the US has more cards to negotiate for Phase 2, where he will agree to remove all tariffs if Phase 2 is completed and that he expects Phase 2 to be the last. (Newswires)</p><p>USTR Lighthizer noted details of the Phase 1 deal: In the 2020/21 period, on top of 2017 baseline figure, China is to purchase an additional USD 32bln of agricultural goods, USD 77.7bln of manufacturing, USD 52.4bln of energy and USD 37.9bln of services.&nbsp; Furthermore, the deal includes detailed provisions on patent protections and counterfeit products, as well as an enforcement process, while Lighthizer confirmed the only way to get further tariff relief from the US is to make Phase 2 but noted it is not the US' intention to wait until after the US election for a Phase 2 agreement. (Newswires)</p><p>US NEC Director Kudlow said the Phase One deal is a pro-growth deal and expects a 0.5% increase to GDP from the deal in 2020, while he added that if China does not uphold the enforcement mechanism then the US will respond accordingly and China would not have the capacity to respond to this. (Newswires)</p><p>Chinese President Xi, in a letter cited by Vice Premier Liu He, said the deal shows the two sides can resolve their differences and find solutions based on dialogue, while Xi added both sides should follow through on the deal to achieve greater progress in collaboration and that he will be staying in close touch with US President Trump. (Newswires)</p><p>Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said China will purchase agricultural goods based on market conditions, as specified in the deal and that China will adhere to the deal out of mutual respect. Liu also stated that Phase 1 will not impact legal interests of third parties and that implementing Phase 1 is the highest priority, while he added US and China need to step up cooperation as it is the only right path. (Newswires)</p><p>China Global Times tweeted the opinion that the phase one trade agreement is still not sufficient, as many biting tariffs remain and keep jittering investors, while it added that US President Trump needs to cancel all the tariffs to be reciprocated by Beijing.

Pfizer (PFE) also contributed to gains in the sector &amp; DJIA on reports it is planning to IPO its GSK consumer business in 3-4 years. Nektar (NKTR) performed poorly after its Oxycodegol, an opioid painkiller, was rejected by the FDA 27 to 0 as the company failed to establish safety and efficacy for back pain. Target (TGT) was hit hard after poor holiday sales, which rose 1.4% Y/Y beneath its guidance of a 3-4% rise, which also weighed on toymakers Mattel (MAT) and Hasbro (HAS), as it cited weak demand for toys and electronics. The losses weighed on competitors, Best Buy (BBY), Macy’s (M) and Walmart (WMT) which in turn hampered consumer discretionary (XLY) and brought concerns over the US consumer. Financials (XLF) traded lower, weighed on by Goldman Sachs (GS), who was hit by a litigation charge and slightly weaker equity trading revenues. Bank of America (BAC) also lower amid slightly soft revenues and weak equity revenues in a similar story to Citi (C) and JP Morgan (JPM) yesterday, which saw the volatile FICC metric experience strong results, whilst equities underwhelmed. Blackrock (BLK) figures led to gains in the name after top and bottom line beats and strong AUM. Meanwhile, regional focused PNC Bank (PNC) and US Bancorp (USB) both traded in the red with lacklustre NII for the quarter. SPX +0.2% at 3289, NDX +0.02% at 9036, DJI +0.32% at 29,031.</p><p>The TPLEX settled firmer amid caution on the signing of the Phase 1 trade deal. Fixed income got off on the front foot throughout the European session in a bull-flattening manner. The march higher seemed to be led by Bunds and Gilts as they tested technical levels on the upside, with the latter supported by growing consensus for a BoE rate cut, which soon saw the TPLEX follow suit. The T-Note did pare some of its gains heading into the US cash equity open, where risk appetite picked up, although ultimately found itself back to highs once the dust settled from the Phase 1 deal. By settlement, the curve's bull flattening saw yields lower across the curve, with the 30-year yield falling 4bps, seeing the 2s30s narrow by approximately 2.5bps. US T-note futures (H0) settled 6+ ticks higher at 129-11.</p>",

Weak TGT sales cast cloud over US consumer, mixed financial earnings</li><li><strong>COMING UP: Data: </strong>US retail sales, Philly Fed, Business Inventories and German CPI. <strong>Events &amp; Speakers: </strong>ECB minutes, SARB rate decision, ECB’s Lagarde, Fed’s Bowman and BoE’s Haldane. <strong>Earnings:</strong> BK</li></ul><p><strong>* US-CHINA PHASE 1 DEAL: </strong>The two states signed the Phase 1 deal, which included an additional USD 200bln of China purchases, as was expected. The deal also includes: detailed provisions on patent protections and counterfeit products; prohibits China from offering incentives to cause tech transfers; an enforcement process (which USTR Lighthizer says \"will see\" if it works out); provisions that require the forfeiture of machinery used to produce counterfeit goods; detailed provisions on patent protections and counterfeit products; China to limit regulatory requests for and access to confidential US information in regulatory reviews; China will \"significantly\" reduce the average time to authorize and review US agricultural biotechnology products to the most of two years. The deal does not address state subsidies, which Lighthizer says is the reason the US is maintaining tariffs; the USTR also said that the only way for China to secure further tariff relief from the US is to make Phase 2, adding that it is it is not the US' intention to wait until after the US election for a Phase 2 agreement. US President Trump said that work on Phase 2 will begin as soon as the deal kicks in, which according to the deal is 30 days upon signing, adding that Phase 2 would be the last “Phase”, in that there would be no Phase 3, and once completed would see a removal of all tariffs, Trump added. Note that earlier in the session, USTR Lighthizer said on CNBC that Phase 2 could be implemented in multiple steps, however.</p><p><strong>* CHINA PURCHASES: </strong>The USD 200bln additional purchases will be made on top of the 2017 purchases amount, used as a baseline, where an additional USD 76.7bln will be made in 2020 and 123.3bln will be made in 2021. The purchases include: 32.9bln additional purchases in manufacturing goods in 2020 and 44.8bln in 2021; 12.5bln additional purchases in agricultural goods in 2020 and 19.5bln in 2021; 18.5bln additional purchases in energy goods in 2020 and 33.9bln in 2021; 12.8bln additional purchases in services in 2020 and 25.1bln in 2021. Market conditions, particularly for agriculture, may dictate the timing of the purchases within either of the given years, the deal says; adding that China will issue tariff exclusions to make US purchases.</p><p><strong>* CHINA LIQUIDITY OPERATIONS:</strong> The PBoC injected CNY 100bln via 14-day reverse repos and CNY 300bln through the 1yr MLF at 3.25% (prev. 3.25%). It is worth noting that the injection comes amid a growing funding squeeze in USD/CNH overnight, where the 7-day repo rate rose close to 25bps on Tuesday, and ahead of an expected cash demand surge before the Lunar New Year holiday, starting January 24th.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Kaplan (voter, neutral)</strong> said it would be healthy to lay out a path where the Fed can reduce repo operations and curtail balance sheet growth, where it should have a structure in place so that it can have the smallest balance sheet possible; concerned of balance sheet growth's effect on risk assets. Kaplan expects business investment to continue to underperform, but said the consumer is strong and the job market is tight on a historical basis, whilst the unemployment rate could fall a little bit.&nbsp; <strong>Fed's Harker (voter, neutral)</strong> said rates are in a good place, unless there is a significant change in inflation, adding that the Fed doesn't need to lower rates right now, citing risks of financial stability. On inflation, Harker said the Fed can implement some forms of forward guidance by allowing inflation to rise above 2%, also that it is not evident inflation would increase if the FFR was moved; adding it does not make sense for the 2% inflation target to be changed. On the repo market, Kaplan said the Fed doesn't want to disintermediate the market, nor be the market for repo, and that designing a backstop repo facility (standing repo facility) is complex and doesn't want to yet commit to one; it may be worth asking whether regulation changes rather than a facility could be used to address liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).</p><p><strong>* BOE: </strong>Further dovish remarks from the BoE today, this time from external member Saunders. However, today's comments provided less traction in the market compared to some of his colleagues this week given that he was one of the MPC members who voted for a cut at the December meeting. Saunders noted that in the current climate, \"it probably will be appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance and possibly to cut rates further, in order to reduce risks of a sustained undershoot of the 2% inflation target.\" Broadly, this would not be too surprising given his recently stated views, however, some analysts placed some focus on the use of the word \"possibly\" in the above quote, which potentially carried less defiance than some had been looking for. That said, the inclusion of \"possibly\" did very little to sway market perceptions of his voting intention. Furthermore, the central banker opined that \"even if the economy improves slightly from the recent pace, risks for the next year or two are on the side of a more protracted period of sluggish growth than the MPR forecast.” Additionally, Saunders believes that any rate reduction would not be \"precautionary\", which helped reaffirm the markets views on how he judges the current fragility of the UK economy. Overall, Saunders rhetoric did little to sway market expectations of a January cut, with probabilities surrounding a 25bps reduction during today's session guided more by lacklustre CPI metrics.</p><p><strong>*FED’S BEIGE BOOK: </strong>On growth, US activity continued to expand modestly in the last 6 weeks of 2019 and that expectations for the near-term outlook remained modestly favourable across the nation. On the consumer, it noted consumer spending grew at a modest to moderate pace, while some districts noted a pick-up from the prior. Holiday sales on balance were said to be solid and home sales trends varied widely across districts, but was flat overall. Elsewhere, manufacturing activity was \"essentially flat\" and tariffs and trade uncertainty continued to weigh in many districts. Employment saw a steady to moderate rise in most districts, the labour market remained tight, but a number of districts noted job cuts or reduced hiring among manufacturers. Wage growth rose at a modest to moderate pace and prices continued at a modest pace. The Beige Book noted that some businesses in a few districts were passing along cost of tariffs to consumers, mostly in retail but also in construction.</p><p><strong>* ECB MINUTES PREVIEW: </strong>Rates were left unchanged in December, and the statement was little changed. New President Lagarde provided a balanced assessment, largely sticking to the ECB's script; but there were a few interesting remarks. Lagarde noted that while risks remained tilted to the downside, they were somewhat less pronounced given the stabilisation in data; any discussion around this view could be of note. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23622/download\">Click here for full preview.</a></p><p><strong>* OPEC MONTHLY REPORT: </strong>The first OPEC report of the year showed 2019 oil demand growth estimates revised lower by 50k BPD from the December 2019 report to 930k BPD, whilst the 2020 metric was lifted by 140k BPD to 1.22mln. Further, global oil supply in December fell by some 60k MM, down 610k BPD on a YY basis. Moreover, the report also revised higher the 2019 and 2020 non-OPEC oil supply growth to 1.86mln BPD (Prev. 1.82mln BPD) and 2.35mln BPD (Prev. 2.17mln BPD) respectively. The report diverges from the EIA STEO released yesterday which cut the 2020 global oil demand growth forecast by 80k BPD whilst OPEC have increased their 2020 estimate. The OPEC report also notes that OPEC oil lost market share yet again, whilst the EIA STEO highlighted that US crude production is poised to rise further this year. OPEC has not yet initiated a 2021 outlook whereas the EIA sees 2021 world oil demand growth forecast at 1.38mln BPD. Next up, tomorrow will see the release of the final oil monthly report, by the IEA, due to be released at 0900GMT/0300ET</p><p><strong>* WTI (G0) SETTLED USD 0.42 LOWER AT USD 57.81/BBL; BRENT (H0) SETTLED USD 0.49 LOWER AT USD 64.00/BBL. </strong>Energy markets traded lower amid the Phase 1 deal, OPEC+ updates and US inventory data, albeit off lows at settlement. The oil benchmarks had a choppy start to the session after Russia dismissed prior day source reports that OPEC+ output cuts could extend until June from March. Participants eyed the signing of the Phase One deal, OPEC MOMR and this week’s DoE inventories where the OPEC report saw little by way of price action. The DoE report saw a larger draw than expected despite last night’s private inventory data showing a build, although both reports showed large builds in products, particularly in the DOE which saw gasoline and distillates build by 6.68mln and 8.1mln bbls respectively which further exacerbated selling pressures. Losses were short-lived and both benchmarks pared back the DoE reaction. As part of the Phase One deal specifics announced heading into settlement, China have agreed to purchase USD 18.5bln of additional purchases in energy goods in 2020 and USD 33.9bln in 2021, on top of the baseline 2017 figure.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.2% at 3289, NDX +0.02% at 9036, DJI +0.32% at 29,031.</p><p><strong>* SECTORS:</strong> Materials +0.65%, IT +0.07%, Communication +0.41%, Industrials +0.1%, Financials -0.55%, Staples +0.65%, Utilities +1.4%, Discretionary -0.25%, Energy -0.67%, Health Care +0.85%, Telecom +0.34%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Health Care (XLV) performed well after a strong report from United Health (UNH), despite a slight miss in revenue. Pfizer (PFE) also contributed to gains in the sector &amp; DJIA on reports it is planning to IPO its GSK consumer business in 3-4 years. Nektar (NKTR) performed poorly after its Oxycodegol, an opioid painkiller, was rejected by the FDA 27 to 0 as the company failed to establish safety and efficacy for back pain. Target (TGT) was hit hard after poor holiday sales, which rose 1.4% Y/Y beneath its guidance of a 3-4% rise, which also weighed on toymakers Mattel (MAT) and Hasbro (HAS), as it cited weak demand for toys and electronics. The losses weighed on competitors, Best Buy (BBY), Macy’s (M) and Walmart (WMT) which in turn hampered consumer discretionary (XLY) and brought concerns over the US consumer. Financials (XLF) traded lower, weighed on by Goldman Sachs (GS), who was hit by a litigation charge and slightly weaker equity trading revenues. Bank of America (BAC) also lower amid slightly soft revenues and weak equity revenues in a similar story to Citi (C) and JP Morgan (JPM) yesterday, which saw the volatile FICC metric experience strong results, whilst equities underwhelmed. Blackrock (BLK) figures led to gains in the name after top and bottom line beats and strong AUM. Meanwhile, regional focused PNC Bank (PNC) and US Bancorp (USB) both traded in the red with lacklustre NII for the quarter.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H0) SETTLED 6+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-11. </strong>The TPLEX settled firmer amid caution on the signing of the Phase 1 trade deal. Fixed income got off on the front foot throughout the European session in a bull-flattening manner. The march higher seemed to be led by Bunds and Gilts as they tested technical levels on the upside, with the latter supported by growing consensus for a BoE rate cut, which soon saw the TPLEX follow suit. The T-Note did pare some of its gains heading into the US cash equity open, where risk appetite picked up, although ultimately found itself back to highs once the dust settled from the Phase 1 deal. By settlement, the curve's bull flattening saw yields lower across the curve, with the 30-year yield falling 4bps, seeing the 2s30s narrow by approximately 2.5bps.</p><p><strong>* UK CPI (DEC): </strong>Headline Y/Y printed 1.3%, a softer reading than the expected 1.5%; even taking into account the BoE themselves flagging that inflation will be negatively impacted due to energy price caps, with the Y/Y coming in below the BoE target of 1.4%. ONS noted that falling hotel prices weighed on the pace of inflation, as well as women’s clothing prices. Core YY also dropped, more rapidly to 1.4% against the expected (&amp; Prev.) 1.7%. Given recent BoE MPC comments, such as from Vlieghe that he is prepared to lower rates if data does not improve, and the poor GDP data on Monday, today’s inflation release was enough to increase expectations for a January cut to over 60%. Although, Lloyds note that several factors depressing inflation are likely to be temporary; however, if they do persist then additional soft inflation numbers will increase the likelihood of a dovish move ahead. Focus on upcoming data will be higher than normal, and further negative prints may well increase expectations around a rate cut; for reference, retail sales, jobs data and flash PMIs are all scheduled prior to the rate decision on January 30th.</p><p>*<strong> FX: USD </strong>lost some ground today amid a stronger EUR with DXY inching closer to the 97.00 handle, softer PPI did little to price action as participants eyed the signing of the Phase One Deal, although that also did little to the DXY. <strong>EUR </strong>spent some time above the 1.1150 handle, a level it resides heading into Asia trade, after breaching the 21 and 200dma at 1.1138; technicians are eyeing last Wednesdays high, 1.1168, as the next level to keep an eye on with ECB minutes tomorrow. <strong>GBP </strong>saw an early morning sell off after a combination of a softer CPI print and dovish commentary from BoE’s Saunders, who opted for a cut at the December meeting, albeit GBP rebounded against the buck, but not so much against the EUR. <strong>USDJPY </strong>hit its 100 HMA where it found support before rebounding to briefly hit the 1.10 figure, before paring somewhat.<strong> XAU </strong>saw a choppy session though ended the day firmer after crossing 1550 to the upside as risk appetite faded.&nbsp; <strong>AUD</strong> &amp; <strong>NZD</strong> also saw choppy trade, Aussie crossed 0.69 against the buck and the Kiwi hovered around the 0.66 level against the dollar; both levels it resides around in the final leg of trade.<strong> EMFX</strong> traded relatively mixed against the dollar, however <strong>RUB</strong> was initially pressured after the Russian parliament resigned from Putin’s helm and <strong>BRL </strong>traded weaker amid poor retail sales data.</p>",

The oil benchmarks had a choppy start to the session after Russia dismissed prior day source reports that OPEC+ output cuts could extend until June from March. Participants eyed the signing of the Phase One deal, OPEC MOMR and this week’s DoE inventories where the OPEC report saw little by way of price action. The DoE report saw a larger draw than expected despite last night’s private inventory data showing a build, although both reports showed large builds in products, particularly in the DOE which saw gasoline and distillates build by 6.68mln and 8.1mln bbls respectively which further exacerbated selling pressures. Losses were short-lived and both benchmarks pared back the DoE reaction. As part of the Phase One deal specifics announced heading into settlement, China have agreed to purchase USD 18.5bln of additional purchases in energy goods in 2020 and USD 33.9bln in 2021, on top of the baseline 2017 figure. <i>NOTE: WTI Feb'20 options expired today, which could have led to some book squaring.&nbsp;</i></li></ul>",

However, after an early EU session upturn to just shy of 97.500 the <strong>DXY</strong> gradually waned amidst fading optimism that the first part of the accord between Washington and Beijing would automatically lead to further tariff relief and a seamless transition to Phase Two. The index retreated to test support ahead of 97.000 in the shape of earlier January highs at 97.105 and 97.091 before stabilising alongside most Usd/major-EM pairings.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The clear G10 winners, but with the Franc still leading the way and extending gains vs the Greenback and single currency to 0.9650+ and 1.0750+ at best. Nevertheless, the Euro finally broke decisively through upside technical obstacles ahead of 1.1150 (21 and 200 DMAs converging at 1.1138) on the way to a 1.1160+ peak and could now take a stab at 1.1168 (last Wednesday’s apex) if not 1.1200.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/GBP</strong></p><p>All marginally firmer or flat against their US counterpart as the Yen benefited from some bouts of risk aversion to pare more losses from sub-110.00 levels and Loonie probed above 1.3050 in relatively sedate fashion. Conversely, Sterling whipsawed between 1.3042 and 1.2988, while Eur/Gbp ricocheted within a 0.8578-38 range as the softest y/y CPI reading since November 2016 compounded near term BoE rate cut expectations and embellished the case put forward by MPC member Saunders just ahead of the UK inflation update.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Kiwi have been jittery in tandem and turn, with Aud/Usd initially undermined by reports that the US will not roll back or withdraw more Chinese tariffs and the first to relinquish big figure status when trading down to circa 0.6877.&nbsp; However, the tables turned suddenly as Nzd/Usd recoiled to around 0.6584 from 0.6620 at one stage, and cross-winds lifted Aud/Nzd from the low 1.0400 area to 1.0450+ for no specific or obvious reason other than an abrupt swing in positioning.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Volatile moves and more Real underperformance as Brazilian retail sales missed consensus in stark contrast to SA data that helped the Rand regroup, while the Rouble was hit by Russian political reverberations following the resignation of PM Medvedev and his Government. Elsewhere, the Renminbi is pivoting 6.8900 vs the Dollar awaiting the aforementioned Phase One event and full details of the pact in the hope of no adverse or negative surprises beyond the lack of extra import levy removals noted above.</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: US-China Phase One Signing: 16:30GMT/11:30EST",
        "content": "<p><strong>Tariff Reports:</strong></p><ul><li>Reports during Tuesday’s US session state that, according to people familiar with the matter, tariffs on China will remain in-place until after the November US elections; subsequently, USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin confirmed there is no scheduled tariff relief for China going forward. Such reports sparked a mild risk-off reaction, as desks highlight investors had been anticipating additional tariff relief post the Phase One signing; therefore, these reports and confirmation via Officials taints the signing somewhat.</li><li>However, desks highlight the real possibility of President Trump at least indicating the potential for further tariff rollback prior to the November elections at today’s signing; as well as the smaller likelihood of him pre-announcing further rollbacks, but as this would directly contradict Lighthizer and Mnuchin this is unlikely to occur.</li><li>Note, at the end of 2019 a limited deal was agreed to which saw the US cut existing tariffs on China in half, on circa. USD 360bln of goods, alongside the cancellation of the December 15th tariffs on USD 156bln of goods. As things stand the Phase One signing will leave tariffs at the 7.5% and 25% on approximately USD 125bln and USD 250bln of goods respectively.</li><li>Additionally, the aforementioned source reports on tariffs remaining in place note that the understanding is that no earlier than 10-months from today’s signing (November 15th onwards) the US will be confirming compliance and may then consider reducing remaining tariffs. Evidently, the review over China’s compliance presents another downside risk in the form of them not having adhered fully/sufficiently to the terms, and as such prompting the implementation of additional tariffs.</li><li>On this, White House Trade Advisor Navarro asserted that the Phase One deal will allow the US to swiftly reimpose tariffs if it unilaterally determines that China has broken any of its commitments, including purchase agreements. China Global Times opinion tweeted that China will surely follow up its commitment to increase imports from the US once barriers such as tariffs and other administrative measures are lifted.</li></ul><p><strong>Agreed Purchases:</strong></p><ul><li>Sources confirmed that the US-China Phase One deal will include a pledge by China to buy USD 200bln of US goods over a 2-year period. This is said to include USD 50bln in energy, USD 40bln in agriculture, USD 35bln-40bln in services and USD 75bln in manufactured goods. SCMP note that questions remain as to whether China can achieve the USD 40bln in agricultural purchases that the Trump administration is touting. China is yet to officially confirms this.</li></ul><p><strong>Document Release:</strong></p><ul><li>Mnuchin and Lighthizer have made it clear that all aspects of the Phase One deal are to be published today, unclear on the exact timing of this; however, the annex containing detailed purchase amounts will not be publicised. A withdrawal that may result in some, at-least initial, confusion over whether the deal misses, meets or exceeds expectations in terms of the purchase numbers. From a long-term perspective, this will make it more challenging for participants to accurately judge if China has been complying with the deal.</li></ul><p><strong>Phase Two</strong></p><ul><li>Some desks note that the Phase One deal signing seems to be more theatre than meaningful change – noting that the semi-annual review as a simple return to conditions seen in 2016, whilst the dropped currency manipulation status is likely a move to acquire leverage against China alongside the majority of tariffs being kept in place.</li><li>The actual format and timing of the Phase Two deal is not yet known. US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin alluded late last year that Phase Two negotiations will begin after Phase One is out of the way, but may be compartmentalised – “Phase Two may be 2a, 2b, 2c, we’ll see, but this is unto itself a huge accomplishment for the president”, Mnuchin noted.</li><li>US President Trump last week he might want to wait till after the election to complete Phase Two China trade deal, but also said the US will begin Phase Two talks straight away. China Global Times, in response, tweeted that a Phase Two trade deal after November is too far away and added that China's willingness to start Phase Two negotiations depends on the implementation of the Phase One deal; citing an expert close to the Chinese Government. Furthermore, Global Times citing the expert close to the Chinese government, stated that China is not in a rush to begin Phase Two talks if US President Trump criticises the country during his election campaign.</li></ul>",

(-0.5%)</strong> also traded subdued on disappointment that the Phase 1 deal will not include a tariff rollback, which overshadowed the liquidity efforts by the PBoC that had announced CNY 300bln in MLF lending and to inject CNY 100bln through 14-day reverse repos ahead of the Lunar New Year scheduled next week. Finally, 10yr JGBs oscillated beneath the 152.00 level with participants sidelined ahead of a 5yr JGB auction and after BoJ Governor Kuroda failed to provide any fresh insights regarding monetary policy ahead of next week’s meeting, although prices later recovered as all metrics pointed to a stronger 5yr auction.</p><p>PBoC injected CNY 100bln via 14-day reverse repos and CNY 300bln through 1yr MLF at 3.25% vs. Prev. 3.25%.

Iranian Foreign Minster Zarif said he did not ask for US troops to be withdrawn from Iraq. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p><p><strong>BoE's Saunders (Dove, Dissenter) says it will probably be appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance, and possibly cut rates further</strong>. He stated his view is that, even if the economy improves slightly from the recent pace, risks for the next year or two are on the side of a more protracted period of sluggish growth than the MPR forecast. Saunders stated the neutral level of interest rates may have fallen further over the last year or two, both in the UK and externally and in order to reduce risks of a sustained undershoot of the 2% inflation target. With limited monetary policy space, risk management considerations favour a relatively prompt and aggressive response to downside risks at present.

This follows on from a similar APAC performance which saw Chinese markets subdued on disappointment that US will not currently roll back on existing China tariffs. UK’s FTSE 100 outperforms on the back of a weaker Sterling boosting exporters in light of further dovish rhetoric from BoE dissenter Saunders coupled with sub-par UK CPI readings.&nbsp; Sectors are mixed with no clear reflection of the overall risk sentiment in the market. Healthcare outperforms with support from Roche (+0.6%) after the Pharma-giant announced commercial availability of a test which will help healthcare professionals better monitor and manage transplant patients at risk of infections. Elsewhere, the IT sector is underpinned by ASM International (+9.6%) whose share were bolstered by an upgrade to prior guidance. In terms of individual movers, Chr Hansen (-6.8%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 following overall downbeat earnings and a downgraded outlook. Elsewhere, RBS (-2.7%), Eurazeo (+3.3%), Safran (+1.5%) have all been influenced by broker action.</p><p><strong>BlackRock Inc (BLK)</strong> Q4 19 (USD): EPS 8.34 (exp. 7.33), Revenue 3.98bln (exp. 3.82bln); Assets under management USD 7.43trl vs. Exp.

EPS 16.25-16.55 (exp. 16.45)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>GBP - </strong>The Pound wasn’t that perturbed about typically dovish commentary from BoE’s Saunders, but Cable subsequently retreated towards recent sub-1.3000 lows and Eur/Gbp rebounded to circa 0.8570 from just under 0.8540 when headline and core UK inflation both missed consensus by some distance. Indeed, the former printed at its weakest y/y pace in 3+ years and latter slowed to 1.4% from 1.7% previously and forecast to tip January easing expectations over 60% compared to less than evens ahead of remarks from one of the resident MPC rate cut dissenters.</p><p><strong>AUD - </strong>Revelations that US-China trade deal Phase One will not come with any further tariff roll-backs or removal of existing levies on Chinese goods have undermined the Aussie more than most majors given its closer correlation to sentiment surrounding the issue and Yuan moves by proxy. Hence, Aud/Usd has reversed through 0.6900 again, as Usd/Cnh pares more losses and hovers above the latest lower Usd/Cny midpoint fix in contrast to the recent trend.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY/EUR/CAD/NZD/NOK/SEK - </strong>The Franc continues to outperform its G10 peers in wake of Switzerland’s inclusion on the list of currency manipulators compiled by the US Treasury, but Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf are also slipping on technical grounds and an element of safe-haven positioning to around 0.9655 and 1.0745 respectively. Similarly, Usd/Jpy is probing lower amidst an unwind of risk-on flows, and after topping out only a pip or so over 110.00 compared to 110.20 at one stage on Tuesday, while Eur/Usd is forging fresh 1.1150+ peaks after finally breaching aligning DMAs (21/200 marks both at 1.1138). Elsewhere, the Loonie remains softer within 1.3055-78 parameters against the backdrop of softer crude prices that are also niggling the Norwegian Krona, but not quite as much as its Swedish counterpart following a wider trade surplus vs broadly in line/benign CPI and CPIF metrics.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Some respite for the Rand as SA retail sales exceed forecast, but little consolation for the Lira due to ongoing Libya angst.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> have gleaned even more impetus via UK CPI rather than BoE’s Saunders reinforcing his rate cut credentials are now eyeing their early December high (133.35) at 133.29 having ducked under 65 bp in 10 year cash yield terms. Meanwhile, <strong>Bunds </strong>have largely shrugged off a sluggish 2050 offering on the basis that German issuance was unlikely to be deemed that attractive in outright ROI terms relative to syndications at the Eurozone margins that are witnessing extreme levels of interest even after record demand for Spain’s new 2030 Bono. Elsewhere, <strong>US Treasuries </strong>are close to best levels and the curve still re-flattening ahead of PPI data, the Empire State survey and of course the WH event to sign Phase 1 of the US-China trade accord scheduled to take place in between speeches from Fed’s Harker and Kaplan.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Relatively uneventful, more so tentative session thus far for energy and precious metals markets – with <strong>WTI and Brent</strong> front-month futures somewhat lacklustre after the Russian and UAE Energy Ministers dismissed source reports that the OPEC+ is to delay the March 5th/6th meeting to June. WTI Feb’20 futures reside just above the USD 58/bbl mark having dipped below the figure earlier in the session ahead of the 200DMA around USD 57.84/bbl. As a reminder, the <strong>OPEC Oil Market Report is to be released at 12:40GMT</strong> following yesterday’s EIA STEO which downgraded its 2020 world oil demand growth. Meanwhile, today will also see the weekly EIA crude stocks release after last night’s API figures printed a surprise build of 1.1mln barrels (vs. exp. draw of 500k barrels) which added selling pressure to the complex. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> saw modest gains as APAC traders digested reports that US will not be rolling back existing China tariffs until after the election – with the yellow metal meandering around 1550/oz. Meanwhile,<strong> copper</strong> prices fell from 8-month highs on the aforementioned tariff reports which potentially dampens demand prospects for the red metal. Finally, Dalian <strong>iron ore</strong> futures swayed within tight ranges as traders juggled the US tariffs on China with lower port inventories.</p><p><strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak states there are no plans to delay the March OPEC+ meeting; and should define further steps at this meeting., IFX. (Newswires) </strong><i>This follows yesterday reports that</i> <i>OPEC+ is mulling the delay of its March meeting to June and could extend output cuts till then if so, according to reports citing sources.

        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European equities mostly see a relatively lacklustre session [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.1%] ahead of the much-anticipated Phase One deal signing with the region holding a more cautious bias. This follows on from a similar APAC performance which saw Chinese markets subdued on disappointment that US will not currently roll back on existing China tariffs. UK’s FTSE 100 outperforms on the back of a weaker Sterling boosting exporters in light of further dovish rhetoric from BoE dissenter Saunders coupled with sub-par UK CPI readings.&nbsp; Sectors are mixed with no clear reflection of the overall risk sentiment in the market. Healthcare outperforms with support from Roche (+0.6%) after the Pharma-giant announced commercial availability of a test which will help healthcare professionals better monitor and manage transplant patients at risk of infections. Elsewhere, the IT sector is underpinned by ASM International (+9.6%) whose share were bolstered by an upgrade to prior guidance. In terms of individual movers, Chr Hansen (-6.8%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 following overall downbeat earnings and a downgraded outlook. Elsewhere, RBS (-2.7%), Eurazeo (+3.3%), Safran (+1.5%) have all been influenced by broker action.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>GBP - The Pound wasn’t that perturbed about typically dovish commentary from BoE’s Saunders, but Cable subsequently retreated towards recent sub-1.3000 lows and Eur/Gbp rebounded to circa 0.8570 from just under 0.8540 when headline and core UK inflation both missed consensus by some distance. Indeed, the former printed at its weakest y/y pace in 3+ years and latter slowed to 1.4% from 1.7% previously and forecast to tip January easing expectations over 60% compared to less than evens ahead of remarks from one of the resident MPC rate cut dissenters.</p><p>AUD - Revelations that US-China trade deal Phase One will not come with any further tariff roll-backs or removal of existing levies on Chinese goods have undermined the Aussie more than most majors given its closer correlation to sentiment surrounding the issue and Yuan moves by proxy. Hence, Aud/Usd has reversed through 0.6900 again, as Usd/Cnh pares more losses and hovers above the latest lower Usd/Cny midpoint fix in contrast to the recent trend.</p><p>CHF/JPY/EUR/CAD/NZD/NOK/SEK - The Franc continues to outperform its G10 peers in wake of Switzerland’s inclusion on the list of currency manipulators compiled by the US Treasury, but Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf are also slipping on technical grounds and an element of safe-haven positioning to around 0.9655 and 1.0745 respectively. Similarly, Usd/Jpy is probing lower amidst an unwind of risk-on flows, and after topping out only a pip or so over 110.00 compared to 110.20 at one stage on Tuesday, while Eur/Usd is forging fresh 1.1150+ peaks after finally breaching aligning DMAs (21/200 marks both at 1.1138). Elsewhere, the Loonie remains softer within 1.3055-78 parameters against the backdrop of softer crude prices that are also niggling the Norwegian Krona, but not quite as much as its Swedish counterpart following a wider trade surplus vs broadly in line/benign CPI and CPIF metrics.</p><p>EM - Some respite for the Rand as SA retail sales exceed forecast, but little consolation for the Lira due to ongoing Libya angst.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Gilts</strong> have gleaned even more impetus via UK CPI rather than BoE’s Saunders reinforcing his rate cut credentials are now eyeing their early December high (133.35) at 133.29 having ducked under 65 bp in 10 year cash yield terms.&nbsp; Meanwhile, <strong>Bunds</strong> have largely shrugged off a sluggish 2050 offering on the basis that German issuance was unlikely to be deemed that attractive in outright ROI terms relative to syndications at the Eurozone margins that are witnessing extreme levels of interest even after record demand for Spain’s new 2030 Bono. Elsewhere, <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> are close to best levels and the curve still re-flattening ahead of PPI data, the Empire State survey and of course the WH event to sign Phase 1 of the US-China trade accord scheduled to take place in between speeches from Fed’s Harker and Kaplan.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Relatively uneventful, more so tentative session thus far for energy and precious metals markets – with <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures somewhat lacklustre after the Russian and UAE Energy Ministers dismissed source reports that the OPEC+ is to delay the March 5th/6th meeting to June. <strong>WTI</strong> Feb’20 futures reside just above the USD 58/bbl mark having dipped below the figure earlier in the session ahead of the 200DMA around USD 57.84/bbl. As a reminder, the<strong> OPEC Oil Market Report is to be released at 12:40GMT </strong>following yesterday’s EIA STEO which downgraded its 2020 world oil demand growth. Meanwhile, today will also see the weekly EIA crude stocks release after last night’s API figures printed a surprise build of 1.1mln barrels (vs. exp. draw of 500k barrels) which added selling pressure to the complex. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> saw modest gains as APAC traders digested reports that US will not be rolling back existing China tariffs until after the election – with the yellow metal meandering around 1550/oz. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> prices fell from 8-month highs on the aforementioned tariff reports which potentially dampens demand prospects for the red metal. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> futures swayed within tight ranges as traders juggled the US tariffs on China with lower port inventories.&nbsp;</p>",

Indeed, the former printed at its weakest y/y pace in 3+ years and latter slowed to 1.4% from 1.7% previously and forecast to tip January easing expectations over 60% compared to less than evens ahead of remarks from one of the resident MPC rate cut dissenters.</p><p><strong>AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Revelations that US-China trade deal Phase One will not come with any further tariff roll-backs or removal of existing levies on Chinese goods have undermined the Aussie more than most majors given its closer correlation to sentiment surrounding the issue and Yuan moves by proxy. Hence, Aud/Usd has reversed through 0.6900 again, as Usd/Cnh pares more losses and hovers above the latest lower Usd/Cny midpoint fix in contrast to the recent trend.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY/EUR/CAD/NZD/NOK/SEK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Franc continues to outperform its G10 peers in wake of Switzerland’s inclusion on the list of currency manipulators compiled by the US Treasury, but Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf are also slipping on technical grounds and an element of safe-haven positioning to around 0.9655 and 1.0745 respectively. Similarly, Usd/Jpy is probing lower amidst an unwind of risk-on flows, and after topping out only a pip or so over 110.00 compared to 110.20 at one stage on Tuesday, while Eur/Usd is forging fresh 1.1150+ peaks after finally breaching aligning DMAs (21/200 marks both at 1.1138). Elsewhere, the Loonie remains softer within 1.3055-78 parameters against the backdrop of softer crude prices that are also niggling the Norwegian Krona, but not quite as much as its Swedish counterpart following a wider trade surplus vs broadly in line/benign CPI and CPIF metrics.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Some respite for the Rand as SA retail sales exceed forecast, but little consolation for the Lira due to ongoing Libya angst.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Overall Earnings Season Remarks:</strong></p><ul><li>According to Zack’s, S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be down 3.7% in Q4 Y/Y, though revenues are seen rising 3.4% Y/Y. The aggregate numbers are likely to be dragged down by the energy sector, where earnings are forecast to decline by around 42% Y/Y, and revenues are seen slipping 4.6% Y/Y.</li><li>The finance names reporting this week (JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup on Tuesday; Goldman Sachs, BlackRock on Wednesday) will set the tone, given that earnings growth in the finance sector are seen rising 7.5%, with revenue growth of 6.3%). The analysts suggested that earnings have been flat over the last three quarters, which is likely to continue; that said, major banks are seen reporting earnings decline of 9.8%, following the -0.6% in the previous quarter.</li></ul><p><strong>Goldman Sachs Expectation:</strong></p><ul><li>Analsyst’s expect GS EPS at (USD) 5.54, picking up from Q3’s 4.79, revenue is expected at 8.5bln, up from the previous 8.3bln. NII is forecasted at USD 984.1mln (prev. 1.008bln), Fees and Commissions income at 793.63mln, trading income at 2.766bln and total non-interest revenue expected at 7.559bln. Investment banking revenue expected at 1.891bln. NIM expected at 0.41% (Prev. 0.44%)</li><li>In terms of recent earnings releases, in Q3 GS missed on both the top and bottom lines, though they did post firmer than expected FICC sales. Which was a disappointing release, particularly compared to Q2’s stellar numbers where the bank beat on EPS and revenue as well as increasing their dividend to USD 1.25/shr vs. Prev. USD 0.85/shr.</li><li>Current number of analyst recommendations: ‘Buy’ 10; ‘Hold’ 9; ‘Strong Buy’ 5; ‘Sell’ 2 and ‘Strong Sell’ 0.</li><li>For reference, Goldman Sachs hold a 5.76% weighting in the DJIA</li></ul><p><strong>JPM, WFC, C Summary:</strong></p><ul><li>Earnings season kicked off with figures from JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citi (C). JP Morgan traded just over 1% higher to close the session which contributed to outperformance in the DJ against SPX &amp; NDX given the banks 3.2% weighting. JPM beat on EPS, revenue, NII and held a strong FICC revenue. Its equity markets revenue rose 15% Y/Y to USD 1.5bln due to higher revenue in prime and cash equities.</li><li>JPM noted quarterly markets businesses rebounded from a challenging previous year, with resolution of some trade issues supported client activity towards year-end. It also highlighted its quarterly investment banking revenue growth driven by higher debt and equity underwriting fees which was partially offset by lower advisory fees.&nbsp;</li><li>Citi (C) also performed well trading with gains of 1.5% at market close after beats in EPS, Revenue, FICC revenue and investment banking revenue. However, its equity market revenue fell 23% to USD 516mln, although the bank announced its results included a USD 0.25/shr benefit from tax matters, although even without the benefit it still beat estimates.&nbsp;</li><li>Wells Fargo (WFC) however capped gains in the financial sector after falling 4% at lows, following a miss on EPS, revenue, NII and NIM, whilst ROE declined from its previous. WFC noted the EPS includes an impact of litgation accruals of a loss of USD 0.33/shr, although even on an adjusted basis it would still miss analyst expectations.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The MPC's focus will therefore likely be on sentiment data to see if it, and hence growth, bounces back.

Gilts have now eased back from 132.76 at best ahead of a speech by BoE Saunders that may not be as pivotal as remarks from Cunliffe later as the former is one of the MPC’s resident doves. Similarly, inflation data may not prompt much reaction unless well outside of the forecast range, as the 3 month strip resumes its upward trajectory after a jittery start (now 1.5-2 ticks ahead vs flat to -0.5 tick at one stage).</p>",

Typically, CPIF is the most watched data release out of Sweden, both by markets and the Riksbank.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets follow suit to the mixed performance on Wall St where there was a mild bias to the downside for most major indices on trade-related headwinds after US officials confirmed that China tariffs are to remain until after the US election despite the Phase 1 deal, although the DJIA remained afloat helped by banking names including JPMorgan which beat on top and bottom lines at the start of earnings season. ASX 200 (+0.3%) extends on record highs and edges closer to the 7000 landmark amid mild gains in financials and with gold miners outperforming after a rebound in the precious metal, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) is lacklustre following the recent pullback from the 24k level and near its yearly highs. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) are subdued on disappointment that the Phase 1 deal will not include a tariff rollback, which overshadowed the liquidity efforts by the PBoC that had announced CNY 300bln in MLF lending and to inject CNY 100bln through 14-day reverse repos ahead of the Lunar New Year scheduled next week.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY is rangebound which is in sharp contrast to the prior day’s whipsaw amid mixed US CPI data and as the lack of tariff rollbacks contributed to the intraday pullback for USD, while its major counterparts are also uneventful as EUR/USD is kept to within a 10-pip range near a cluster of DMA levels and with GBP/USD resting on its recent laurels in which it retraced some of the dovish BoE-induced losses to reclaim the 1.3000 handle. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are indecisive amid the cautious risk tone and as a rehash of the all-too-familiar BoJ rhetoric by Governor Kuroda failed to spur prices, in which he reiterated they will not hesitate to ease further if risks grow that momentum to reaching the price target is lost. Antipodeans trade relatively unchanged amid a lack pertinent data, and with the bout of pressure as USD/CNH flirted with the 6.9000 handle, proving to be short-lived after another firmer reference rate setting by the PBoC.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as prices oscillate beneath the 152.00 level with participants sidelined ahead of a 5yr JGB auction and after BoJ Governor Kuroda failed to provide any fresh insights regarding monetary policy ahead of next week’s meeting.</p>",
