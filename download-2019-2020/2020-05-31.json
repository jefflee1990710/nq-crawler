On the former, the Fed chair revealed little in the way of reads we could use ahead of the June FOMC, reiterating negative rates was not appropriate at the moment; with an aggressive reading one might argue that his remarks were consistent with a future YCC tool. Markets traded choppy ahead of President Trump’s remarks, however, much of the meat was leaked in advance via sources, and all the measures were generally ones that markets had digested with ease over the last couple of weeks. While Trump had more spikey rhetoric, there was no ‘nuclear’ action that the President announced (for instance, sanctions against key China officials, any immediate disruption of capital flows, any immediate delisting of Chinese companies, and there was nothing that threatened Hong Kong’s access to dollars). Accordingly, equities saw a relief rally into the final part of trade, and there was some modest selling in Treasuries. SPX +0.5% at 3,044, NDX +1.5% at 9,556, DJI -0.1% at 25,383.</p><p>The TPLEX caught a bid to end the week amid month-end flows and tentative risk appetite ahead of Trump announcements and the weekend. By settlement, the curve had flattened, with yields lower between 1-4bps across the curve. Real money was reported to have been behind the bid amid duration extension due to portfolio rebalancing, at the same time fast money/spec accounts were said to be sellers, keeping pressure on yields. However, the selling pressure abated into the latter part of the session seeing the curve bull flatten further. Additionally, the bid was supported further due Treasury supply out the way, as well as little corporate issuance on the radar today. NY Fed announced its week ahead Treasury/TIPS purchases too, where the total weekly purchases will rise to USD 22.5bln (prev. 20bln), while owing to this week’s market holiday on Monday, next week’s daily purchases will fall to USD 4.5bln from 5bln. The Fed also released data on its SMCCF, where as of Thursday, it held USD 1.177bln across corporate bonds. The Fed also released ETF holding breakdowns, albeit only up till May 19th, where its largest holdings in corporate bond ETFs appeared most correlated to those with the largest AUM, with the IG Corp ETF LQD being the largest holding, followed by LQD, VCIT, DCSH, and HYG (the largest US corporate HY ETF). US T-note futures (U0) settled 13 ticks higher at 139-02.</p>",
