He noted that markets are reacting to a deceleration in global growth, financial conditions have tightened, and credit spreads have widened since October. He warned that trade tensions have worsened, and he doesn&rsquo;t think the US will be immune to a growth slowdown in China. He stressed that the Fed must be vigilant in monitoring balance sheet and should stand ready for adjustments. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> White House Advisor Hassett warned that China&#39;s economy is slowing, and this will impact many US companies who will be forced to reduce their guidance like Apple did; he pointed out that the current economic situation in the region is appearing like a recession. Elsewhere, US President Trump tweeted that the US Treasury &quot;has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly&quot;. Also, the US has issued a China travel advisory which includes an exit ban warning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ADP PAYROLLS</strong> came in strong and added 271k jobs in December exceeding significantly the 178k consensus; the prior reading however was downwardly revised to 157k from 179k. Note this data tends to show high volatility in December which could explain the exacerbated move. Moody&#39;s economist Zandi noted that &quot;businesses continue to add aggressively to their payrolls despite the stock market slump and the trade war. Favourable December weather also helped lift the job market. At the current pace of job growth, low unemployment will get even lower.&quot; Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics argued that the data presents upside risks to its 225k forecast: &quot;Typically, ADP tends to undershoot the official numbers in months after weather events - November&rsquo;s survey week was the coldest since 1997, at least - but we&rsquo;d be very surprised by a 300Kplus reading in the official NFP data,&quot; Pantheon said, &quot;we can&rsquo;t imagine that 271K gains are remotely sustainable, but this report comes as a welcome jolt to the market&rsquo;s favoured narrative that the economy is slowing sharply.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ISM MANUFACTURING PMI</strong> fell sharply from 60.7 to 54.9, missing the 54.09 consensus, posting the largest one-month drop in a decade. New orders came in at 51.1, the biggest fall since January 2014 and are now at the lowest since August 2016. Employment only fell 2.2pts to 56.2 from 58.4 though analysts at Pantheon warn the figure could fall much further without a rebound in new orders. Pantheon also highlights that &ldquo;manufacturing accounts for only about 12% of GDP&rdquo; and looking ahead &ldquo;the Fed won&rsquo;t hike again until the trade situation is resolved, but a weak ISM alone will not prompt easings&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI SETTLES $0.55 HIGHER AT $47.09/BBL; BRENT FUTURES SETTLE $1.04 HIGHER AT $ 55.95/BBL.</strong> Crude prices settled higher on what was a volatile day of trade for both WTI and Brent, where they continued to move in tandem with Wall Street&rsquo;s jitters (the latest inspired by Apple cutting revenue forecasts, while the overnight &lsquo;flash&rsquo; crash continued to capture attention) before paring back losses. Analysts at Citi note how Thursday&rsquo;s disappointing US ISM manufacturing index weighed on crude earlier in the session by reinforcing the narrative around slowing global growth. Looking ahead, The API will report its weekly energy inventory data after the bell on Thursday, ahead of the DOE&#39;s release on Friday; expectations are for headline crude to draw by 3.1mln, distillates to build by 1.6mln, gasoline to build by 2mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX -2.48% at 2448, NDX -3.36% at 6147, DJI -2.83% at 22686. SECTORS:</strong> Energy -1.09%, Materials -2.76%, Industrials -2.97%, Cons Discretionary -2.18%, Cons Staples -0.73%, Healthcare -2.21%, Financials -2.27%, Tech -5.07%, Telecoms -1.45%, Utilities +0.06%. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) nosedived on the open as it lowered its Q1 revenue guidance significantly citing weak China demand, causing losses across the semiconductor sector (QRVO, SWKS, AMD, AVGO) and other trade sensitive stocks (BA, CAT, DWDP). Bristol-Myers (BMY) opened lower as it announced it would be acquiring Celgene (CELG) for USD 74bln, Celgene surged on the open as well as other pharma stock Incyte (INCY). Broker moves saw Gilead (GILD) and Teva (TEVA) benefitting on the open from upgrades at Oppenheimer and BAML respectively, AbbVie (ABBV) opened lower after a downgrade at BAML. Airlines (DAL, AAL, ALK) underperformed after Delta lowered its revenue forecast. In later trade, Twenty First Century Fox (FOXA) erased losses after Brazilian regulators announced they are set to pass the deal with Disney (DIS) without an asset sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H19) SETTLE 31 TICKS HIGHER AT 123-05.</strong> The treasury complex drifted higher on Thursday amid widespread risk-off tone inspired by Apple cutting its revenue estimates and the &lsquo;flash crash&rsquo; overnight. Most of the action was concentrated in the front-end and belly of the curve were yields were lower by c.1bps. The complex saw brief downside in response to a massive beat in ADP payrolls though likely to be driven by volatile and temporary factors; focus now shits on the official payroll release due on Friday. Spreads were wider across the curve with the exception of 2s5s which were narrower by just below 1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>FX markets garnered a significant amount of market attention after a chaotic Asia-Pac session which saw a surge in the JPY which prompted the currency gain circa 8% vs. the AUD and 10% vs. TRY with analysts attributing the move to a multitude of factors including thin markets (Japan away from market again), Apple-inspired risk aversion (following revenue guidance cut) and Japanese retail investors liquidating offside positions. At the time, losses in AUD/JPY saw USD/JPY slide sharply below 109.00 to briefly breach 105.00 before recovering to a 107.00 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The index was on the backfoot throughout the session with the greenback dented by aforementioned JPY strength. Traction thereafter was exacerbated by commentary from Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan who continued to deviate from the sentiment portrayed by Chair Powell at the most recent policy announcement and instead noted that policymakers should be ready to adjust the balance sheet if needed. These comments were then followed up by a well-above expectation ADP report which briefly provided some reprieve for the USD before the selling recommenced given that the figure was likely inflated by seasonal factors and estimates for large states given the government shutdown. Finally, from a data perspective, ISM did little to reassure investors ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s NFP print.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>A turbulent session for GBP after GBP/JPY fell through 137.00 to levels just shy of 131.50 during Asia-Pac trade, causing Cable to crash below the 1.2600 handle and eventually make a session low of 1.2441. GBP recouped a bulk of its overnight losses as markets reversed course from the so-called &lsquo;flash crash&rsquo; with broad-USD softness enabling GBP/USD to briefly climb above 1.2600. Positivity for GBP will likely be capped by the return of political risk as Parliament reconvenes next week; ahead of lawmakers&rsquo; return UK press is already suggesting that UK PM May might have to delay her Jan 14th vote with party whips unable to drum up enough support for the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Despite a blip lower in EUR/JPY which led EUR/USD to a session low of 1.1310, EUR put up more of a fight than some of its G10 counterparts with the multi-bloc currency also said to be revived by touted short-covering (as well as the softer USD). As such, EUR/USD was able to briefly reclaim the 1.1400 level and remain towards the mid-point of the early 2019 range ahead of EZ inflation metrics tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: </strong>US Nonfarm Payrolls (December 2018) due at 1330 GMT/0830 EST on 4 January 2019. Consensus view: +177k payrolls; AHE seen falling to 3.0% YY; jobless rate seen unchanged at 3.7%.

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: A rampant JPY and lacklustre US data sinks the USD",
        "content": "<p>FX markets garnered a significant amount of market attention after a chaotic Asia-Pac session which saw a surge in the JPY which prompted the currency gain circa 8% vs. the AUD and 10% vs. TRY with analysts attributing the move to a multitude of factors including thin markets (Japan away from market again), Apple-inspired risk aversion (following revenue guidance cut) and Japanese retail investors liquidating offside positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, losses in AUD/JPY saw USD/JPY slide sharply below 109.00 to briefly breach 105.00 before recovering to a 107.00 level. In terms of the USD itself, the DXY was on the backfoot throughout the session with the greenback dented by aforementioned JPY strength. Traction thereafter was exacerbated by commentary from Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan who continued to deviate from the sentiment portrayed by Chair Powell at the most recent policy announcement and instead noted that policymakers should be ready to adjust the balance sheet if needed. These comments were then followed up by a well-above expectation ADP report (271k vs. Exp. 178k) which briefly provided some reprieve for the USD before the selling recommenced given that the figure was likely inflated by seasonal factors and estimates for large states given the government shutdown; note, the prior was also revised lower by 22k. Finally from a data perspective, ISM did little to reassure investors with a headline print of 54.1 vs. Exp. 57.7 and the employment component slowing to 56.2 from 58.4 ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s NFP print.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, today saw a turbulent session for GBP after GBP/JPY fell through 137.00 to levels just shy of 131.50 during Asia-Pac trade, causing Cable to crash below the 1.2600 handle and eventually make a session low of 1.2441. GBP recouped a bulk of its overnight losses as markets reversed course from the so-called &lsquo;flash crash&rsquo; with broad-USD softness enabling GBP/USD to briefly climb above 1.2600. Positivity for GBP will likely be capped by the return of political risk as Parliament reconvenes next week; ahead of lawmakers&rsquo; return UK press is already suggesting that UK PM May might have to delay her Jan 14th vote with party whips unable to drum up enough support for the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite a blip lower in EUR/JPY which led EUR/USD to a session low of 1.1310, EUR put up more of a fight than some of its G10 counterparts with the multi-bloc currency also said to be revived by touted short-covering (as well as the softer USD). As such, EUR/USD was able to briefly reclaim the 1.1400 level and remain towards the mid-point of the early 2019 range ahead of EZ inflation metrics tomorrow.</p>\r\n",

(unch) swung between gains and losses with the former weighed on by tech names as Apple suppliers ACC Technologies and Sunny Optical slumped over 5% after Apple&rsquo;s guidance cut.

SMI index heavyweight UBS (+0.5%) are in the green following comments from their Chairman that now is not the right time for a merger; additionally, he expects to remain in office until 2022. The technology sector (-2.8%) is the underperforming sector with the likes of Dialog Semiconductor (-9.0%), STMicroelectronics (-9.4%), ASML (-5.1%) and Infineon (-5.4%) at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following Apple cutting their Q1 revenue guidance. Other notable stories include Next (+5.2%) in the green after reporting their expected full year price sales growth of +3.2%, which is in line with September&rsquo;s guidance and thus avoids a profit warning for the Co. Adecco (-4.8%) are down after being downgraded at Credit Suisse. In addition, luxury names are in the red with the likes of Burberry (-4.8%) and Kering (-4.5%) weighed on by growth concerns in China exacerbated by the aforementioned Apple guidance cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price action in the FX space remains a key focus for investor sentiment amid the wild swings seen during Asia-Pac hours. To recap events, FX markets were rattled amid a surge in the JPY which saw the currency gain circa 8% vs. the AUD and 10% vs. TRY with analysts attributing the move to a multitude of factors including thin markets (Japan away from market again), Apple-inspired risk aversion (following revenue guidance cut) and Japanese retail investors liquidating offside positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of price action at the time, AUD/JPY plummeted from around 75.50 to a low print of 70.50, tripping several stops along the way. Shortly after the stops were taken-out, AUD/JPY pared back a bulk of the move and now trades in close proximity to the 75.00 handle. Elsewhere, at the time, USD/JPY slid sharply below 109.00 to briefly breach 105.00 before recovering to the mid 107.00&rsquo;s (note, given the velocity of the moves, various platforms have registered differing moves). AUD/USD declined further below 0.7000 to touch levels last seen a decade ago with a session low of 0.6743 before eventually recouping a 0.6900 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aussie and Yen crosses reacted in tandem with the sharp swing, the Pound was hit as GBP/JPY fell through 137.00 to levels just shy of 131.50 and as such, Cable lost the 1.2600 handle and briefly clipped 1.2450 to reach 21-month lows before reclaiming 1.2550 with Lloyds noting pivotal resistance between 1.2590-1.2615 and suggesting that a move through this level would allow for &ldquo;a stronger recovery in the range under 1.2810-50&rdquo;. From a fundamental perspective, Brexit-related commentary has begun to pick-up as Mrs May returns to work ahead of Parliament reconvening on the 7th; latest reports suggest that the UK PM has been urged to delay the meaningful vote on her Brexit deal for a second time as government whips failed to persuade enough MPs to back it over the Christmas break.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR has been slightly more resilient than some of its peers despite a blip lower in EUR/JPY which led EUR/USD to a session low of 1.1310 with the multi-bloc currency thereafter able to benefit from touted short-covering and a broadly softer USD (DXY currently trades just above 96.50 with losses of circa 0.2%). As such, EUR/USD now trades just above of 1.1350 after running out of steam at 1.1384.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU debt has reversed course since the risk-averse open to slowly but steadily creep into negative territory for the day as the market consolidates on little to no new catalysts. This comes after 10-year bund yields failed to break the over 2-year low of 0.148% in the early morning, with yield returning to trade above the 0.175% mark as of recent trade. Gilt traders derived little direction from the disappointing Construction PMI figures, with 10-year futures now well below the 124.00 key level, with a fresh Liffe base printed of 123.63.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BTPs are the laggards in Europe and are further in negative territory for the day, with the Italian benchmark breaching the 127.41 Dec 28th low hitting a fresh session bottom of 127.07 and remain around this level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US we&rsquo;re seeing similar price action, with the majority of the moves once again in the long end post-Apple and a failed effort to stop the shutdown yesterday, with the next meeting scheduled for Friday. 10-years hit a session and contract pinnacle of 122-23 at the open before losing steam and consolidating around 122-13. Traders will now be looking out for further direction from tier-1 data releases later in the day in the form of Initial Jobless Claims, ADP and ISM&rsquo;s Manufacturing PMI alongside the 3, 10 and 30yr announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (unch.) and WTI (-0.2%) prices remain anchored as concerns over global growth and an oversupplied market continue to prevail; ahead of today&rsquo;s rescheduled API&rsquo;s (with EIA&rsquo;s tomorrow). Saudi Arabia are expected to cut February heavy crude prices for crude sold to Asia because of weaker fuel oil margins; as according to a Reuters survey. Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s NOC have said that the Sharara oil field was breached on Tuesday and output will be cut by 8.5k after operations restart for the main system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.2%) is in the green due to safe haven demand from the Apple-stemmed growth fears; with the yellow metal passing 6-month highs earlier in the session, although prices are around USD 4/oz off of the USD 1292/oz session highs. Elsewhere, copper prices are down succumbing to the negative risk sentiment.</p>\r\n",

SMI index heavyweight UBS (+0.5%) are in the green following comments from their Chairman that now is not the right time for a merger; additionally, he expects to remain in office until 2022. The technology sector (-2.8%) is the underperforming sector with the likes of Dialog Semiconductor (-9.0%), STMicroelectronics (-9.0%), ASML (-5.3%) and Infineon (-5.2%) at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following Apple cutting their Q1 revenue guidance. Other notable stories include Next (+5.8%) in the green after reporting their expected full year price sales growth of +3.2%, which is in line with September&rsquo;s guidance and thus avoids a profit warning for the Co. Adecco (-5.0%) are down after being downgraded at Credit Suisse. In addition, luxury names are in the red with the likes of Burberry (-4.5%) and Kering (-4.0%) weighed on by growth concerns in China exacerbated by the aforementioned Apple guidance cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price action in the FX space remains a key focus for investor sentiment amid the wild swings seen during Asia-Pac hours. To recap events, FX markets were rattled amid a surge in the JPY which saw the currency gain circa 8% vs. the AUD and 10% vs. TRY with analysts attributing the move to a multitude of factors including thin markets (Japan away from market again), Apple-inspired risk aversion (following revenue guidance cut) and Japanese retail investors liquidating offside positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of price action at the time, AUD/JPY plummeted from around 75.50 to a low print of 70.50, tripping several stops along the way. Shortly after the stops were taken-out, AUD/JPY pared back a bulk of the move and now trades in close proximity to the 75.00 handle. Elsewhere, at the time, USD/JPY slid sharply below 109.00 to briefly breach 105.00 before recovering to the mid 107.00&rsquo;s (note, given the velocity of the moves, various platforms have registered differing moves). AUD/USD declined further below 0.7000 to touch levels last seen a decade ago with a session low of 0.6743 before eventually recouping a 0.6900 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aussie and Yen crosses reacted in tandem with the sharp swing, the Pound was hit as GBP/JPY fell through 137.00 to levels just shy of 131.50 and as such, Cable lost the 1.2600 handle and briefly clipped 1.2450 to reach 21-month lows before reclaiming 1.2550 with Lloyds noting pivotal resistance between 1.2590-1.2615 and suggesting that a move through this level would allow for &ldquo;a stronger recovery in the range under 1.2810-50&rdquo;. From a fundamental perspective, Brexit-related commentary has begun to pick-up as Mrs May returns to work ahead of Parliament reconvening on the 7th; latest reports suggest that the UK PM has been urged to delay the meaningful vote on her Brexit deal for a second time as government whips failed to persuade enough MPs to back it over the Christmas break.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR has been slightly more resilient than some of its peers despite a blip lower in EUR/JPY which led EUR/USD to a session low of 1.1310 with the multi-bloc currency thereafter able to benefit from touted short-covering and a broadly softer USD (DXY currently trades just above 96.50 with losses of circa 0.37%). As such, EUR/USD now trades around 30 pips shy of 1.1400 where 1bln in expiries are due to roll-off at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU debt has reversed course since the risk-averse open to slowly but steadily creep into negative territory for the day as the market consolidates on little to no new catalysts. This comes after 10-year bund yields failed to break the over 2-year low of 0.148% in the early morning, with yield returning to trade above the 0.175% mark as of recent trade. Gilt traders derived little direction from the disappointing Construction PMI figures, with 10-year futures now well below the 124.00 key level, with a fresh Liffe base printed of 123.63.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BTPs are the laggards in Europe and are further in negative territory for the day, with the Italian benchmark breaching the 127.41 Dec 28th low hitting a fresh session bottom of 127.32 before reverting to trade around the 127.41 area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US we&rsquo;re seeing similar price action, with the majority of the moves once again in the long end post-Apple and a failed effort to stop the shutdown yesterday, with the next meeting scheduled for Friday. 10-years hit a session and contract pinnacle of 122-23 at the open before losing steam and consolidating around 122-13. Traders will now be looking out for further direction from tier-1 data releases later in the day in the form of Initial Jobless Claims, ADP and ISM&rsquo;s Manufacturing PMI alongside the 3, 10 and 30yr announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.2%) and WTI (-0.9%) prices are down as concerns over global growth and an oversupplied market continue to prevail; ahead of today&rsquo;s rescheduled API&rsquo;s (with EIA&rsquo;s tomorrow). Saudi Arabia are expected to cut February heavy crude prices for crude sold to Asia because of weaker fuel oil margins; as according to a Reuters survey. Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s NOC have said that the Sharara oil field was breached on Tuesday and output will be cut by 8.5k after operations restart for the main system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.3%) is in the green due to safe haven demand from the Apple-stemmed growth fears; with the yellow metal passing 6-month highs earlier in the session, although prices are around USD 4/oz off of the USD 1292/oz session highs. Elsewhere, copper prices are down succumbing to the negative risk sentiment.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "FX morning colour: JPY remains king as markets remain thin",
        "content": "<p>Price action in the FX space remains a key focus for investor sentiment amid the wild swings seen during Asia-Pac hours. To recap events, FX markets were rattled amid a surge in the JPY which saw the currency gain circa 8% vs. the AUD and 10% vs. TRY with analysts attributing the move to a multitude of factors including thin markets (Japan away from market again), Apple-inspired risk aversion (following revenue guidance cut) and Japanese retail investors liquidating offside positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of price action at the time, AUD/JPY plummeted from around 75.50 to a low print of 70.50, tripping several stops along the way. Shortly after the stops were taken-out, AUD/JPY pared back a bulk of the move and manged to retain its status on a 75.00 handle. Elsewhere, at the time, USD/JPY slid sharply below 109.00 to briefly breach 105.00 before recovering to the high 107.00&rsquo;s (note, given the velocity of the moves, various platforms have registered differing moves). AUD/USD declined further below 0.7000 to touch levels last seen a decade ago with a session low of 0.6743 before eventually recouping a 0.6900 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aussie and Yen crosses reacted in tandem with the sharp swing, the Pound was hit as GBP/JPY fell through 137.00 to levels just shy of 131.50 and as such, Cable lost the 1.2600 handle and briefly clipped 1.2450 to reach 21-month lows before reclaiming 1.2550 with Lloyds noting pivotal resistance between 1.2590-1.2615 and suggesting that a move through this level would allow for &ldquo;a stronger recovery in the range under 1.2810-50&rdquo;. From a fundamental perspective, Brexit-related commentary has begun to pick-up as Mrs May returns to work ahead of Parliament reconvening on the 7th; latest reports suggest that the UK PM has been urged to delay the meaningful vote on her Brexit deal for a second time as government whips failed to persuade enough MPs to back it over the Christmas break. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR has been slightly more resilient than some of its peers despite a blip lower in EUR/JPY which led EUR/USD to a session low of 1.1310 with the multi-bloc currency thereafter able to benefit from touted short-covering and a broadly softer USD (DXY currently trades just above 96.50 with losses of circa 0.37%). As such, EUR/USD now trades around 20 pips shy of 1.1400 where 1bln in expiries are due to roll-off at the NY cut.</p>\r\n",

Gilts opened higher by about 30 ticks and have settled just below the 124.00 area with the UK benchmark once again eyeing the Dec 12th high of 124.28 as resistance. Investors&nbsp; are also keeping an ear out for Brexit developments amid suggestions the Brexit parliamentary vote may once again be delayed as PM May has failed to drum up enough support for her deal over Christmas. BTPs are also conforming to the risk tone, with the Italian 10-year down by about 40 ticks from yesterdays close of 128.30 and have broken the big figure of 128.00 with focus set on the 127.41 level next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US we&rsquo;re seeing similar risk-off moves, with the majority of the action once again in the long end post-Apple and a failed effort to stop the shutdown yesterday, with the next meeting scheduled for Friday. 10-years hit a pinnacle of 122-23 at the open before losing steam and settling around 122-15.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were rattled in thin liquidity amid fresh global growth fears after Apple cut its Q1 revenue forecast, citing weaker Chinese sales. This spurred safe-haven demand into the JPY while simultaneously pressuring the trade-sensitive AUD, hence AUD/JPY plummeted from around 75.50 to a low print of 70.50, tripping several stops along the way which led to an algo-triggered flash-crash. Shortly after the stops were taken-out, AUD/JPY pared back a bulk of the move and stabilised just under 74.50. Furthermore, USD/JPY slid sharply below 109.00 to test 105.00 at one point, while AUD/USD declined further below 0.7000 to touch levels last seen a decade ago. The pairs then recouped some losses to trade just above 107.00 and 0.6930 respectively throughout most of the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Aussie and Yen crosses reacted in tandem with the sharp swing, the Pound was hit as GBP/JPY fell through 137.00 to levels just shy of 131.50 and as such, Cable lost the 1.2600 handle and briefly clipped 1.2450 before recovering to around 1.2550. Elsewhere, the NZD initially popped higher as the AUD/NZD cross briefly reached parity, however, gains in the Kiwi were short-lived as the currency conformed to the risk-averse tone and moved lower in sympathy to its antipodean counterpart. Finally, amidst all the above, the Dollar index declined further below 97.000 and tested 96.500 to the downside ahead of the psychological 96.000 level and its 100 DMA at 95.987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI futures declined by almost a dollar per barrel overnight as renewed slowing global growth fears sent the benchmark back below USD 46.00/bbl, ahead of the holiday-delayed API inventory release later today. Elsewhere, gold was bid amid safe-haven demand alongside a weaker greenback as the yellow metal climbed higher to test USD 1290/oz to the upside, while copper underperformed and fell victim to the soured risk sentiment. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he received a great letter from North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un; he added he has established a good relationship with him and never emphasized speed of denuclearisation.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex was bid overnight after Apple&rsquo;s guidance cut (citing weaker Chinese sales) gave further fuel to the notion of slowing global economic momentum. This comes following some selling emerged in the prior session after US equities stabilised after the open, and the risk mood became more constructive. By yesterday&rsquo;s close, the short-end of the curve was a touch negative, while longer-dated yields were lower by around 5bps; the result was a flatter yield curve on the first trading day of the year. * US T-NOTE FUTURES (H19) SETTLE 5+ HIGHER AT 122-06.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional leaders failed to strike a deal to end the partial US government shutdown.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equities are mostly higher despite the slide in US equity futures after tech-giant Apple cut its Q1 2019 revenue guidance to USD 84.0bln from previous guidance in the range of USD 89.0-93.0bln. ASX 200 (+1.3%) is lifted by the energy names and gold miners amid yesterday&rsquo;s spike higher in oil and the Apple-triggered bid in the yellow metal, meanwhile Nikkei 225 is closed due to a public holiday. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) erased opening losses with the former led by property stocks while the latter is lifted by financial names, after reports that the PBoC may lower the RRR rate for banks that lend to small businesses. Of note, China CICC Research stated that the PBoC&rsquo;s RRR criteria easing may release up to CNY 400bln in liquidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were rattled amid fresh global growth fears after Apple cut its Q1 revenue guidance citing weaker Chinese sales. This spurred safe-haven demand into the JPY while simultaneously pressuring the trade-sensitive AUD, thus leading to the demise of AUD/JPY as the pair plummeted from around 75.50 to a low print of 70.50, tripping several stops along the way to result in a flash-crash. Shortly after the stops were completed, AUD/JPY pared back a bulk of the move and stabilised around 74.50. Furthermore, USD/JPY slid sharply below 109.00 to test 105.00 at one point, while AUD/USD declined further below 0.7000 to touch levels last seen a decade ago. The pairs then recouped most of the losses to trade around 107.50 and 0.6930 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Aussie and Yen crosses reacted in tandem with the sharp swing, the Pound was hit as GBP/JPY fell through 137.00 to levels just shy of 131.50 and as such, Cable lost the 1.2600 handle and briefly clipped 1.2450 before recovering to around 1.2550. Elsewhere, the NZD initially popped higher as the AUD/NZD cross briefly reached parity, however, gains in the Kiwi were short-lived as the currency conformed to the risk tone and moved lower in sympathy with its antipodean counterpart. Finally, amidst all the above, the DXY briefly breached 96.500 to the downside before trading in a relatively tight range above the level.</p>\r\n",
