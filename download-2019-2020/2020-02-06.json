(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>OPEC+ JTC reportedly proposed a 600k supply cut to start immediately and will continue through June if agreed by all members, according to sources. This was inline with earlier reports which also noted that Russia was undecided and that the deal would revert back to existing output cuts (of 1.7mln BPD) + 400k BPD Saudi voluntary cut in Q3, while there was no agreement on a meeting date yet. (Newswires/Argus)</p><p>Russian Energy Minister Novak said Russia was not yet ready to announce its position on the OPEC+ action related to the coronavirus outbreak and that time is needed to assess the impact. There were also reports that Novak told the US ambassador to Russia that they are ready to renew energy dialogue, including analysis on oil and nat gas markets, while he added sanctions hinder mutually beneficial cooperation and that it is \"unfair competition\".

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Twitter (TWTR) surged after a decent Revenue print and mDAU growth, despite a miss on bottom-line. Becton Dickinson (BDX) took a double-digit haircut after cutting its guidance due to expected sales losses from the Alaris infusion system. Cognizant Technology (CTSH) made solid gains on a strong quarter, guidance, and dividend hike. Qualcomm (QCOM) reported a stellar quarter and guidance but was offered amid its warnings on a potential material impact from the coronavirus. Kellogg (K) sold off on negative profit growth guidance for the year. Estee Lauder (EL) made strong gains on a solid quarter, although it did cut guidance due to the coronavirus. Bristol Myers (BMY) reported big beats on top and bottom line – desks note the expectations were too low due to the CELG deal – and raised its share repurchase programme by USD 5bln, seeing the stock outperform. Other stocks that benefitted after earnings reports included Cardinal Health (CAH), FMC (FMC), Tapestry (TPR), Cincinnati Financial (CINF), Phillip Morris (PM), Regeneron (REGN), IAC (IAC), Zynga (ZNGA). Meanwhile, stocks that were sold after their reports included Paycom Software (PAYC), Xylem (XYL), Willis Tower Watson (WTW), Yum! Brands (YUM), O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Tyson Foods (TSN), Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Fox Corp (FOXA), Peloton (PTON), GrubHub (GRUB), Twilio (TWLO). Boeing (BA) was bid on comments from the FAA that it may, or may not, base its ungrounding of the 737 MAX decision on the recent wiring issue brought forward, although some selling pressure was felt after additional reports of a new software issue were found. Apple (AAPL) saw some downside on Nikkei reports that it would struggle to meet its production targets for AirPods given the coronavirus. Match (MTCH) was bid on sources reports that it was mulling a merger with Meet Group (MEET). S&amp;P 500 +0.3% at 3346, Dow +0.3% at 29384, NDX +0.8% at 9446.</p><p>US Treasury yields were little changed on Thursday, with the curve having a slightly steeper bias. Wires attributed Treasuries' performance to China's efforts to contain the coronavirus, and how it might be enough to prevent any deep economic fallout. And on that front, there were some interesting comments from Fed 2020 voter Kaplan, who has seemingly upgraded his view for US GDP growth this year, now seeing the economy expanding by 2.25%; in mid-January, Kaplan had seen growth around 2.0%, the median forecast on the FOMC. Attention now focuses on Friday's jobs data, with whisper numbers optimistic following this week's ADP beat; indeed, going into the data, US economic surprises are the highest since 2018, according to Citi's gauge. Desks have been suggesting that as virus fears ebb, traders may once again become more focussed on the fundamental backdrop, with data likely to be the swaying factor regarding the currently easy central bank policy (though the central bank will keep a cautious eye on global events, of course); on that note, the Fed will release its semi-annual report on Friday, ahead of Chair Powell's dual testimony to lawmakers next week. US T-note futures (H20) settle half-a-tick higher at 130-18.</p>",

Data: US &amp; CAD Jobs Report, German Trade. Speakers:&nbsp; Fed’s Quarles. Earnings: ABBV, CNHI</strong></li></ul><p><strong>* CORONAVIRUS: </strong>The total confirmed cases of coronavirus increased to 28,060 and deaths at 564. The UK saw a patient test positive for the coronavirus, and they are currently being treated at a hospital in London. Chinese President Xi praised the prevention work, noting it had received positive results. The WHO announced it is too early to tell whether the virus is peaking, although yesterday saw the first day that overall number of new China cases decreased. Outside of Wuhan, WHO noted it is relatively stable, although cycles of transmission may see a rise in the coming days.</p><p><strong>* CHALLENGER LAY OFFS: </strong>Challenger reported 67,735 job cuts have been announced in its January survey (the highest monthly total since February 2019), rising from 32,843 in the previous report. Challenger said that technology companies led in announced job cuts last month as they pivot to new products or services. But Tech was not the only industry embarking on this kind of restructuring. Companies across all industries are re-examining their hierarchies, particularly in Automotive and Retail, where innovations in technology are changing the landscape.</p><p><strong>* US NFP PREVIEW:</strong> Analysts expect the pace of payroll growth to pick up (160k expected), though remain beneath recent trend rates; the ADP’s measure of payroll growth surprised to the upside, though analysts offer the usual caveats; business surveys continue to point to payrolls growth, though the pace of growth cooled in the non-manufacturing survey. Weekly jobless claims data has stabilised near lows. Meanwhile, consumer confidence surveys bode well, with consumers expecting to see more jobs in the months ahead, though their view on wage gains pared very slightly.

Some had speculated whether it was an ‘olive branch’ for support towards the coronavirus, given source reports stated China has asked for flexibility on some of the Phase One pledges. However, later CNBC’s Yoon stated that China sees the latest tariff cut move as reciprocal after the US said it would cut rates on theirs. The specifics will see crude oil tariffs fall to 2.5% from 5%, Soybeans to 27.5% from 30%, and Pork, beef, and chicken to 30% from 35%. Elsewhere, WSJ reported that many US companies are manoeuvring to avoid tariffs on Chinese imports, citing trade lawyers and logistic consultants, noting a range of strategies are in play to avoid the payments without hampering supply chain.</p><p><strong>* MNUCHIN: </strong>On the economy, the Treasury Secretary noted GDP projections have been reduced due to Boeing (BA), whilst reiterating it could hamper GDP by 50bps or more although it is expected to be a onetime phenomenon, whilst adding the coronavirus could have some impact. When asked about the high deficit, Mnuchin noted that the debt/GDP level is manageable. On the coronavirus, Mnuchin stated that at this point the US has not seen any big issues with supply chains and that he does not see China having issues in fulfilling trade commitments. On Trade, he reiterated US President Trump is willing to cut China tariffs as part of Phase Two, and that Phase Two can be done before or after the election. Elsewhere, he highlighted that USTR Lighthizer is simultaneously working on deals with UK, EU and India.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed’s Kaplan (Voter) has seemingly </strong>upgraded his view of the US economy, and now sees it growing at 2.25% in&nbsp; 2020 (previously, in mid-Jan, he saw growth at 2.0% this year), above the Fed’s median view of 2.0%. Kaplan noted his view would be firmer if it wasn’t for Boeing (BA) and the coronavirus. On the balance sheet, he expects the growth to be far more moderate from here until June (Note, Powell suggested there would be a ‘tapering’ in Q2). On rates, Kaplan’s base case is for rates to remain unchanged this year, in line with the Fed’s median forecasts, and states that they are ‘roughly appropriate’. On the coronavirus, he believes it will not require a monetary stimulus response and that his best guess is that it will be transitory, but in the mean time, it will have a serious impact. Elsewhere, on the oil market, he expects negative Capex in energy and net production growth of US oil to be less than 500k BPD.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB President Lagarde said the low interest rate and low inflation environment has significantly reduced the scope for the ECB and other central banks worldwide to ease monetary policy in the face of an economic downturn. Broadly in line with its expectations, the euro area economy continues to grow, though still with modest momentum, Lagarde said, adding that, to be sure, there are tentative signs of stabilisation. Forward-looking indicators have become in slightly more optimistic, as the PMI manufacturing business expectations in 12 months’ time have increased in the five consecutive months through January to the highest level in 18 months, and the economy remains relatively resilient. Lagarde also said that the overall moderate growth performance is delaying the pass-through from wage increases to prices and inflation developments remain subdued, and therefore, the euro area economy continues to require support from our monetary policy, which provides a shield from global headwinds.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: S&amp;P 500 +0.3% at 3346, Dow +0.3% at 29384, NDX +0.8% at 9446. </strong>SECTORS: Telecoms +1.25%, Tech 1.1%, consumer staples +0.4%, industrials +0.4%, financials +0.1%, consumer discretionary 0.0%, health care +0.0%, utilities -0.1%, materials -0.1%, energy -0.8%.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Twitter (TWTR) surged after a decent Revenue print and mDAU growth, despite a miss on bottom-line. Becton Dickinson (BDX) took a double-digit haircut after cutting its guidance due to expected sales losses from the Alaris infusion system. Cognizant Technology (CTSH) made solid gains on a strong quarter, guidance, and dividend hike. Qualcomm (QCOM) reported a stellar quarter and guidance but was offered amid its warnings on a potential material impact from the coronavirus. Kellogg (K) sold off on negative profit growth guidance for the year. Estee Lauder (EL) made strong gains on a solid quarter, although it did cut guidance due to the coronavirus. Bristol Myers (BMY) reported big beats on top and bottom line – desks note the expectations were too low due to the CELG deal – and raised its share repurchase programme by USD 5bln, seeing the stock outperform. Other stocks that benefitted after earnings reports included Cardinal Health (CAH), FMC (FMC), Tapestry (TPR), Cincinnati Financial (CINF), Phillip Morris (PM), Regeneron (REGN), IAC (IAC), Zynga (ZNGA). Meanwhile, stocks that were sold after their reports included Paycom Software (PAYC), Xylem (XYL), Willis Tower Watson (WTW), Yum! Brands (YUM), O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Tyson Foods (TSN), Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Fox Corp (FOXA), Peloton (PTON), GrubHub (GRUB), Twilio (TWLO).</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Boeing (BA) was bid on comments from the FAA that it may, or may not, base its ungrounding of the 737 MAX decision on the recent wiring issue brought forward, although some selling pressure was felt after additional reports of a new software issue were found. Apple (AAPL) saw some downside on Nikkei reports that it would struggle to meet its production targets for AirPods given the coronavirus. Match (MTCH) was bid on sources reports that it was mulling a merger with Meet Group (MEET).</p><p><strong>* WTI (H0) SETTLES USD AT USD /BBL; BRENT (J0) SETTLES USD AT USD /BBL: </strong>The crude complex was mixed as participants awaited an announcement from the extended OPEC+ JTC confab, with some sourced reports stating the recommendation has been for a 600k BPD production cut. However, Russia is reportedly still undecided, with Energy Minister Novak stating that it was too early for an announcement, and that more time was needed to assess the impact of the coronavirus. Therefore, given there was no consensus across the board, a decision has not been finalised. The lack of updates pressured the oil complex as any production cuts, which if eventually implemented will be delayed, or perhaps not as severe. Argus Media highlighted that the deal, if reached would in Q3 revert back to existing output cuts of 1.7mln BPD + Saudi Arabia’s voluntary cut of 400k. In terms of a review date, no early meeting has been officially been scheduled yet, but sources said it could be between 14th and 15th of February. Elsewhere, Libya’s UN Envoy announced it expects to receive a list of demands from eastern tribesmen on Thursday to reopen the blocked oil ports. Note, the latest update has NOC production at187k BPD on Tuesday, from around 1.3mln BPD at total capacity.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H20) SETTLE HALF-A-TICK HIGHER AT 130-18:</strong> US Treasury yields were little changed on Thursday, with the curve having a slightly steeper bias. Wires attributed Treasuries' performance to China's efforts to contain the coronavirus, and how it might be enough to prevent any deep economic fallout. And on that front, there were some interesting comments from Fed 2020 voter Kaplan, who has seemingly upgraded his view for US GDP growth this year, now seeing the economy expanding by 2.25%; in mid-January, Kaplan had seen growth around 2.0%, the median forecast on the FOMC. Attention now focuses on Friday's jobs data, with whisper numbers optimistic following this week's ADP beat; indeed, going into the data, US economic surprises are the highest since 2018, according to Citi's gauge. Desks have been suggesting that as virus fears ebb, traders may once again become more focussed on the fundamental backdrop, with data likely to be the swaying factor regarding the currently easy central bank policy (though the central bank will keep a cautious eye on global events, of course); on that note, the Fed will release its semi-annual report on Friday, ahead of Chair Powell's dual testimony to lawmakers next week.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: DXY:</strong> The Dollar Index is set to book its fourth day of gains, and will likely close out the week in positive territory. Economic data surprises out of the US are running at the best level since 2018, and that has bolstered investor confidence ahead of Friday's jobs report, following the decent ISM data for January, while the ADP data released on Wednesday augurs well. <strong>EUR:</strong> Desks have noted that, as virus fears ebb, and risk-appetite returns, and vols pare back some of their recent upside, EUR carry has come back into focus. This has helped push the single currency sub-1.10 (having been lingering beneath 1.11 at the start of the week). In early trade, data showed German factory orders slumping in December, with the annual growth rate hitting a post crisis low. HAVENS: <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong> continue to see positions lightening as virus fears ease; with the former, technicians say they need to see 110.10-30 region cleared to initiate stronger risk-on moves. <strong>XAU</strong>, however, added to gains once again, with wires suggesting that expectations of lower rates and uncertainties are helping the yellow metal to keep its shine. <strong>GBP</strong>: Despite a bounce in the currency after decent PMI data, cable has today fallen beneath 1.2950; the narrative is back on Brexit, with both the EU and UK seemingly uncompromising in remarks thus far, as the sides lay out their negotiating positions. It provides a reminder that cliff-edge Brexit risks have returned, after the electioneering towards the end of last year. <strong>AUD</strong>: Despite the lower probability of RBA cuts, the AUD has weakened ahead of the release of the SOMP overnight, with desks attributing the slide to USD gains, as well as technical resistance. EMFX: Despite the BCB on Wednesday signalling the end of its easing cycle, the <strong>BRL</strong> still weakened on Thursday, with some suggesting that spec flows were behind the slide, as desks unwound bets of further easing. Other <strong>EMFX</strong> was also lower, with the USD strength being attributed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Economic data surprises out of the US are running at the best level since 2018, and that has bolstered investor confidence ahead of Friday's jobs report, following the decent ISM data for January, while the ADP data released on Wednesdya augurs well.</li><li>EUR: Desks have noted that, as virus fears ebb, and risk-appetite returns, and vols pare back some of their recent upside, EUR carry has come back into focus. This has helped push the single currency sub-1.10 (having been lingering beneath 1.11 at the start of the week). In early trade, data showed German factory orders slumping in December, with the annual growth rate hitting a post crisis low.</li><li>HAVENS: JPY and CHF continue to see positions lightening as virus fears ease; with the former, technicians say they need to see 110.10-30 region cleared to initiate stronger risk-on moves. XAU, however, added to gains once again, with wires suggesting that expectations of lower rates and uncertainties are helping the yellow metal to keep its shine. GBP: Despite a bounce in the currency after decent PMI data, cable has today fallen beneath 1.2950; the narrative is back on Brexit, with both the EU and UK seemingly uncompromising in remarks thus far, as the sides lay out their negotiating positions. It provides a reminder that cliff-edge Brexit risks have returned, after the electioneering towards the end of last year.</li><li>AUD: Despite the lwoer probability of RBA cuts, the AUD has weakened, with desks attributing the slide to USD gains, as well as technical resistance.</li><li>EMFX: Despite the BCB on Wednesday signalling the end of its easing cycle, the BRL still weakened on Thursday, with some suggesting that spec flows were behind the slide, as desks unwound bets of further easing. Other EMFX was also lower, with the USD strength being attributed.</li></ul>",

Wires attributed Treasuries' performance to China's efforts to contain the coronavirus, and how it might be enough to prevent any deep economic fallout. And on that front, there were some interesting comments from Fed 2020 voter Kaplan, who has seemingly upgraded his view for US GDP growth this year, now seeing the economy expanding by 2.25%; in mid-January, Kaplan had seen growth around 2.0%, the median forecast on the FOMC. Attention now focuses on Friday's jobs data, with whisper numbers optimistic following this week's ADP beat; indeed, going into the data, US economic surprises are the highest since 2018, according to Citi's gauge. Desks have been suggesting that as virus fears ebb, traders may once again become more focussed on the fundamental backdrop, with data likely to be the swaying factor regarding the currently easy central bank policy (though the central bank will keep a cautious eye on global events, of course); on that note, the Fed will release its semi-annual report on Friday, ahead of Chair Powell's dual testimony to lawmakers next week.&nbsp;</p>",

However, Russia is reportedly still undecided, with Energy Minister Novak stating that it was too early for an announcement, and that more time was needed to assess the impact of the coronavirus. Therefore, given there was no consensus across the board, a decision has not been finalised. The lack of updates pressured the oil complex as any production cuts, which if eventually implemented will be delayed, or perhaps not as severe. Argus Media highlighted that the deal, if reached would in Q3 revert back to existing output cuts of 1.7mln BPD + Saudi Arabia’s voluntary cut of 400k. In terms of a review date, no early meeting has been officially been scheduled yet, but sources said it could be between 14th and 15th of February. Elsewhere, Libya’s UN Envoy announced it expects to receive a list of demands from eastern tribesmen on Thursday to reopen the blocked oil ports. Note, the latest update has NOC production at187k BPD on Tuesday, from around 1.3mln BPD at total capacity.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Not the worst G10 performer or even lone loser, but the Pound has continued its retracement from post-BoE peaks to trade below levels prevalent before the MPC held rates and delivered less dovish guidance than implied by several policy-setters in the run up. No specific or single bearish catalyst, but sentiment surrounding Brexit has soured following initial exchanges between the UK Government and EU officials, especially after reports that the latter could target financial entities in the City of London during the 2nd iteration of MiFID. Cable has fallen below the previous wtd low after tripping stops at 1.2955 and breaching Tuesday’s circa 1.2942 base that was protecting the trough seen after December 12’s election (1.2904), while Eur/Gbp has edged closer to 0.8500 again vs sub-0.8400 last Friday.</p><p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to Sterling, the Dollar is still on an upward trajectory and extending gains above 98.000 to 98.577, through a key Fib level (98.402 - 61.8 retracement of the fall from 99.667 October 2019 yearly pinnacle to 96.355 December base) and late November low (98.544) in the process. To recap, upbeat US data/surveys, and in particular yesterday’s bumper ADP tally, have fuelled Greenback gains alongside higher UST yields and a steeper curve amidst less extreme angst over China’s coronavirus and news that Beijing may slash levies of Usd75 bn US goods by as much as 50% on February 14.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/AUD/CAD/NZD/CHF</strong></p><p>Having held up better in the face of broad Buck strength earlier, the other majors are now looking resigned to fate and the inevitable as Eur/Usd slips further below the 1.1000 handle to test Fib support at 1.0964, Usd/Jpy bounces from circa 109.73 lows back towards 110.00, Aud/Usd hands back more post-RBA recovery gains within a 0.6764-31 range and Nzd/Usd hovers just above 0.6450 ahead of the RBA’s SOMP and more from Governor Lowe before NZ Q1 inflation expectations. Meanwhile, Usd/Cad has nudged above 1.3300, as Usd/Chf tips over 0.9750, but Eur/Chf has crossed 1.0700 once more to keep the SNB on its toes.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Broad depreciation against the Usd, but particularly notable for the Brl given the BCB’s hawkish cut, while even the Czk has pared initial gains vs a soft Eur after an unexpected 25 bp CNB hike as the post-policy meeting pronouncements revealed a tight 4-3 vote for the move and guidance leaning towards no further tightening.</p>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+2.6%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+1.7%) </strong>conformed to the heightened global risk appetite after unverified reports that a Chinese university research team found an \"effective\" drug to treat people with Coronavirus and as several mainland pharmaceutical stocks hit limit up, with gains later exacerbated after China announced to cut tariffs by as much as 50% on USD 75bln of US goods effective February 14th. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued in which prices declined below 152.50 amid the lack of demand for safe havens and after reports of China’s move to reduce tariffs on US goods which nullified the slightly improved 30yr JGB auction results.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net neutral position.

(FT)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European equity markets have waned off highs [Eurostoxx 50 +0.4%] seen since the cash open as sentiment turned more cautious in early EU trade. This follows on from a solid APAC lead where investors cheered China’s surprise rollback in USD 75bln worth of US goods in the hope of a reciprocal move by the US to help ease some of the burden arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Nonetheless, major bouses are still in positive territory although the FTSE 100 (+0.1%) modestly lags its peers amid losses in some of its large-cap stocks including some miners amid a decline in base metal prices. Sectors are largely mixed with no clear reflection of the current risk sentiment – financial names modestly outperform amid a higher-yield environment. In terms of individual movers, triple-listed ArcelorMittal (+9.3%) rose post-earnings topping EBITDA expectations whilst also reporting a decent YY increase in iron-ore shipments and noting that the supportive inventory environment leads to expectations of growth in steel consumptions. Total (+1.6%) shares rose in light of its Q4 adj. net income topping estimates, an increase in FY dividend, a USD 2bln share buyback programme and a target of over USD 5bln in cumulative savings this year – albeit shares could be underpinned by price action in the energy complex. On the flip side, Royal Mail (-8.3%) shares slumped to the foot of the Stoxx 600 post-earnings amid the assessment of a challenging outlook.&nbsp; Other earnings-related movers include Unicredit (+5.8%), Publicis (+4.5%), Nordea Bank (+4.8%), Sanofi (+2.4%), Dassault Systemes (-3.1%), ICA Gruppen (-7.1%), and Assa Abloy (-3.1%). Elsewhere, NMC Health (+5.6%) sees a day of reprieve after sources noted that the Co’s founder would be returning with an “active position” and separate source reports that Private Equity firms, including Apollo, circled the Co. in the past. Finally, Deutsche Bank (+6.0%) shares extended on its gains after Capital Group Companies disclosed a 3.1% stake in the Co.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY - </strong>The Buck remains bolstered by firm US Treasury yields, albeit off best levels in relatively rangebound trade, as the index consolidates above 98.000, but fails to derive enough momentum independently or indirectly to extend gains beyond the next upside chart objective ahead of 98.500 (98.402 Fib). However, the Dollar may glean more bullish impetus if today’s domestic data in the form of Challenger lay-offs, initial claims and Q4 labour costs or productivity is upbeat awaiting Friday’s NFP release.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP/AUD </strong>- In contrast to other G10 currencies that are largely meandering vs the Greenback, Cable has drifted back below 1.3000 again and the Kiwi has retreated further below the 0.6500 handle amidst Waitangi holiday-thinned volumes and more underperformance against the Aussie. Indeed, Aud/Nzd is holding ‘comfortably’ above 1.0400 even though Aud/Usd has slipped back under 0.6750 where hefty option expiry interest resides (1.3 bn) in wake of sub-forecast trade and retail sales overnight. Back to Sterling, Wednesday’s EU MiFID revelations are still reverberating, while the UK Trade Department announces to implement a most favoured country tariff system post-Brexit transition on January 1 next year.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/CAD/CHF/NOK/SEK </strong>- All on a more even keel vs their US counterpart, as the Euro pivots 1.1100 amidst conflicting vibes via significantly worse than expected German factory and VDMA engineering orders in contrast to an upbeat ECB President Lagarde and monthly bulletin echoing signs of economic stabilisation. Meanwhile, broadly, but less pronounced risk-on sentiment continues to hamper the Yen and Franc just shy of 110.00 and 0.9750 respectively, though the Loonie is not really benefiting within tight 1.3275-88 confines in the run up to tomorrow’s Canadian jobs data. Elsewhere, the Scandi Kronas have both waned after yesterday’s decent recovery gains, with Eur/Nok back up near 10.1500 and Eur/Sek close to 10.5600 against the backdrop of sagging crude and a drop in Swedish house prices.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- Although many regional currencies are down vs the Dollar, reports about China cutting US import tariffs by up to 50% on February 14 have kept the Yuan afloat, while the Real could get a boost from the BCB signalling that last night’s 25 bp rate cut may be the last in the current cycle. Conversely, the Rand has been undermined by a deterioration in SA business sentiment on top of the aforementioned general Greenback bid.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>Gilts</strong> are both just shy of fresh intraday highs at 173.92 and 133.92 (flat and just 5 ticks adrift compared to -1/2 point and -39 ticks at one stage) and it’s arguable whether the catalyst for the firmer bounce off worst levels was a rebound in <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> amidst a broad paring back of risk appetite evidenced via cash bourses, equity futures and oil, or closer to home for the core Eurozone debt future given a reversal in Italian paper from session peaks. Regardless, some element of technical retracement has occurred ahead of the US open and pm agenda including more pre-NFP data and a speech from Fed’s Kaplan.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures have given up a bulk of their overnight gains as risk aversion crept into the markets in early EU trade. Furthermore, OPEC’s JTC has extended its meeting to three days from the originally scheduled two. Sources noted that the technical committee could agree on a total reduction of at least 500k BPD - in fitting with some of the prior sources which noted the JTC would be assessing several scenarios that have cut options between 500-900k BPD. Later, a delegate noted of an agreement of 600k BPD cut but disagreement on whether to hold an emergency meeting. Russian Energy Minister Novak played down the reports and noted that Russia is not yet ready to announce its position on the OPEC+ action and that it is premature to talk about decisions. Russia has been historically adamant to commit to deeper cuts as Russia's economy is more resilient to lower oil prices. WTI and Brent reside just above USD 51/bbl and USD USD 55/bbl respectively, having retreated from current intraday highs of USD 52.15/bbl and ~USD 56.50/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> has been supported by the aforementioned shift in sentiment, with the yellow metal decoupling itself from a rising USD and residing just above its 21 DMA at ~USD 1563/oz (vs. low ~USD 1552/oz). Elsewhere, <strong>copper</strong> prices conformed to the abated risk appetite, with prices now back below USD 2.6/lb vs. an overnight high of USD 2.6144/lb. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> closed the session higher by almost 1% following three consecutive sessions of losses as China’s surprise tariff rollback announcement underpinned prices.</p>",

To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>European equity markets have waned off highs [Eurostoxx 50 +0.4%] seen since the cash open as sentiment turned more cautious in early EU trade. This follows on from a solid APAC lead where investors cheered China’s surprise rollback in USD 75bln worth of US goods in the hope of a reciprocal move by the US to help ease some of the burden arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Nonetheless, major bouses are still in positive territory although the FTSE 100 (+0.1%) modestly lags its peers amid losses in some of its large-cap stocks including some miners amid a decline in base metal prices. Sectors are largely mixed with no clear reflection of the current risk sentiment – financial names modestly outperform amid a higher-yield environment. In terms of individual movers, triple-listed ArcelorMittal (+9.3%) rose post-earnings topping EBITDA expectations whilst also reporting a decent YY increase in iron-ore shipments and noting that the supportive inventory environment leads to expectations of growth in steel consumptions. Total (+1.6%) shares rose in light of its Q4 adj. net income topping estimates, an increase in FY dividend, a USD 2bln share buyback programme and a target of over USD 5bln in cumulative savings this year – albeit shares could be underpinned by price action in the energy complex. On the flip side, Royal Mail (-8.3%) shares slumped to the foot of the Stoxx 600 post-earnings amid the assessment of a challenging outlook.&nbsp; Other earnings-related movers include Unicredit (+5.8%), Publicis (+4.5%), Nordea Bank (+4.8%), Sanofi (+2.4%), Dassault Systemes (-3.1%), ICA Gruppen (-7.1%), and Assa Abloy (-3.1%). Elsewhere, NMC Health (+5.6%) sees a day of reprieve after sources noted that the Co’s founder would be returning with an “active position” and separate source reports that Private Equity firms, including Apollo, circled the Co. in the past. Finally, Deutsche Bank (+6.0%) shares extended on its gains after Capital Group Companies disclosed a 3.1% stake in the Co.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY - </strong>The Buck remains bolstered by firm US Treasury yields, albeit off best levels in relatively rangebound trade, as the index consolidates above 98.000, but fails to derive enough momentum independently or indirectly to extend gains beyond the next upside chart objective ahead of 98.500 (98.402 Fib). However, the Dollar may glean more bullish impetus if today’s domestic data in the form of Challenger lay-offs, initial claims and Q4 labour costs or productivity is upbeat awaiting Friday’s NFP release.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP/AUD </strong>- In contrast to other G10 currencies that are largely meandering vs the Greenback, Cable has drifted back below 1.3000 again and the Kiwi has retreated further below the 0.6500 handle amidst Waitangi holiday-thinned volumes and more underperformance against the Aussie. Indeed, Aud/Nzd is holding ‘comfortably’ above 1.0400 even though Aud/Usd has slipped back under 0.6750 where hefty option expiry interest resides (1.3 bn) in wake of sub-forecast trade and retail sales overnight. Back to Sterling, Wednesday’s EU MiFID revelations are still reverberating, while the UK Trade Department announces to implement a most favoured country tariff system post-Brexit transition on January 1 next year.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/CAD/CHF/NOK/SEK </strong>- All on a more even keel vs their US counterpart, as the Euro pivots 1.1100 amidst conflicting vibes via significantly worse than expected German factory and VDMA engineering orders in contrast to an upbeat ECB President Lagarde and monthly bulletin echoing signs of economic stabilisation. Meanwhile, broadly, but less pronounced risk-on sentiment continues to hamper the Yen and Franc just shy of 110.00 and 0.9750 respectively, though the Loonie is not really benefiting within tight 1.3275-88 confines in the run up to tomorrow’s Canadian jobs data. Elsewhere, the Scandi Kronas have both waned after yesterday’s decent recovery gains, with Eur/Nok back up near 10.1500 and Eur/Sek close to 10.5600 against the backdrop of sagging crude and a drop in Swedish house prices.</p><p><strong>EM </strong>- Although many regional currencies are down vs the Dollar, reports about China cutting US import tariffs by up to 50% on February 14 have kept the Yuan afloat, while the Real could get a boost from the BCB signalling that last night’s 25 bp rate cut may be the last in the current cycle. Conversely, the Rand has been undermined by a deterioration in SA business sentiment on top of the aforementioned general Greenback bid.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>Gilts</strong> are both just shy of fresh intraday highs at 173.92 and 133.92 (flat and just 5 ticks adrift compared to -1/2 point and -39 ticks at one stage) and it’s arguable whether the catalyst for the firmer bounce off worst levels was a rebound in <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> amidst a broad paring back of risk appetite evidenced via cash bourses, equity futures and oil, or closer to home for the core Eurozone debt future given a reversal in Italian paper from session peaks. Regardless, some element of technical retracement has occurred ahead of the US open and pm agenda including more pre-NFP data and a speech from Fed’s Kaplan.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> front-month futures have given up a bulk of their overnight gains as risk aversion crept into the markets in early EU trade. Furthermore, OPEC’s JTC has extended its meeting to three days from the originally scheduled two. Sources noted that the technical committee could agree on a total reduction of at least 500k BPD - in fitting with some of the prior sources which noted the JTC would be assessing several scenarios that have cut options between 500-900k BPD. Later, a delegate noted of an agreement of 600k BPD cut but disagreement on whether to hold an emergency meeting. Russian Energy Minister Novak played down the reports and noted that Russia is not yet ready to announce its position on the OPEC+ action and that it is premature to talk about decisions. Russia has been historically adamant to commit to deeper cuts as Russia's economy is more resilient to lower oil prices. WTI and Brent reside just above USD 51/bbl and USD USD 55/bbl respectively, having retreated from current intraday highs of USD 52.15/bbl and ~USD 56.50/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> has been supported by the aforementioned shift in sentiment, with the yellow metal decoupling itself from a rising USD and residing just above its 21 DMA at ~USD 1563/oz (vs. low ~USD 1552/oz). Elsewhere, <strong>copper</strong> prices conformed to the abated risk appetite, with prices now back below USD 2.6/lb vs. an overnight high of USD 2.6144/lb. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> closed the session higher by almost 1% following three consecutive sessions of losses as China’s surprise tariff rollback announcement underpinned prices.</p>",

Regardless, some element of technical retracement has occurred ahead of the US open and pm agenda including more pre-NFP data and a speech from Fed’s Kaplan.</p>",

However, the Dollar may glean more bullish impetus if today’s domestic data in the form of Challenger lay-offs, initial claims and Q4 labour costs or productivity is upbeat awaiting Friday’s NFP release.</p><p><strong>NZD/GBP/AUD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In contrast to other G10 currencies that are largely meandering vs the Greenback, Cable has drifted back below 1.3000 again and the Kiwi has retreated further below the 0.6500 handle amidst Waitangi holiday-thinned volumes and more underperformance against the Aussie. Indeed, Aud/Nzd is holding ‘comfortably’ above 1.0400 even though Aud/Usd has slipped back under 0.6750 where hefty option expiry interest resides (1.3 bn) in wake of sub-forecast trade and retail sales overnight. Back to Sterling, Wednesday’s EU MiFID revelations are still reverberating, while the UK Trade Department announces to implement a most favoured country tariff system post-Brexit transition on January 1 next year.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/CAD/CHF/NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>All on a more even keel vs their US counterpart, as the Euro pivots 1.1100 amidst conflicting vibes via significantly worse than expected German factory and VDMA engineering orders in contrast to an upbeat ECB President Lagarde and monthly bulletin echoing signs of economic stabilisation. Meanwhile, broadly, but less pronounced risk-on sentiment continues to hamper the Yen and Franc just shy of 110.00 and 0.9750 respectively, though the Loonie is not really benefiting within tight 1.3275-88 confines in the run up to tomorrow’s Canadian jobs data. Elsewhere, the Scandi Kronas have both waned after yesterday’s decent recovery gains, with Eur/Nok back up near 10.1500 and Eur/Sek close to 10.5600 against the backdrop of sagging crude and a drop in Swedish house prices.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although many regional currencies are down vs the Dollar, reports about China cutting US import tariffs by up to 50% on February 14 have kept the Yuan afloat, while the Real could get a boost from the BCB signalling that last night’s 25 bp rate cut may be the last in the current cycle. Conversely, the Rand has been undermined by a deterioration in SA business sentiment on top of the aforementioned general Greenback bid.</p>",

However, the core Eurozone bond remains on the back foot in line with debt peers on another upturn in global stocks and risk sentiment amidst reports that China is mulling reduced tariffs on US goods that should facilitate compliance with the Phase 1 trade deal and help to mitigate the adverse impact of the coronavirus. On that note, the number of fatalities and confirmed cases continue to mount, but markets are still assuming that the economic fall-out and contagion can be contained after various reports suggesting that an antidote may be ready sooner than originally anticipated. Ahead, ECB’s Lagarde and de Guindos are scheduled to speak before the latest monthly economic report and multi-tranche auctions from France and Spain.</p>",

Some desks noted that CFTC positioning data alluded to a large build-up of longs, in the latest week, and if the reports about vaccinations prove to be correct, the rates complex could see a sharp reversal following the recent rally. Another observation some analysts have noted is that, while US equities and USDJPY has reversed last week's virus-induced losses, Treasuries are yet to follow suit (as are Brent prices, which are more focussed on the demand loss from China as a result of the outbreak). With that said, some suggest that the moves seen on Tuesday, where US 10-year yields settled 7bps higher, may have been more of a function of China injecting liquidity, rather than any specific positive development on the virus front, after all, as Rabobank explains, the injection of liquidity does not address any of the fundamental concerns about the virus, and so it does not see the backup in yields as the beginning of a rotation out of bonds.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equity markets get a lift on the tailwinds from Wall St. where S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posted record closes with sentiment underpinned by strong US data and hopes of a coronavirus treatment in the works despite the World Health Organization denying any breakthrough. ASX 200 (+1.0%) is led higher by outperformance in energy amid a rebound in crude prices and strength in the largest weighted financials sector to reclaim the 7000 level, while Nikkei 225 (+2.3%) gets an additional boost from favourable currency flows. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) conform to the heightened global risk appetite after unverified reports a Chinese university research team found an \"effective\" drug to treat people with Coronavirus, but with gains capped in the mainland as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths continues to increase and with the PBoC also refraining from liquidity operations.</p><p>The DXY remains at this week’s best levels after recent strong data including better than expected ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI and ADP Employment numbers which almost doubled expectations to provide some encouragement ahead of Friday’s Non-Farm Payrolls. The greenback also benefitted from the lacklustre trade in its counterparts across the pond with EUR/USD subdued below 1.1000 and after GBP/USD gave back the 1.3000 handle after reports suggested the EU is mulling MIFID II changes to diminish the role of the City of London which will likely not bode well for post-Brexit trade talks. Elsewhere, the positive risk appetite has provided a floor for USD/JPY and JPY-crosses although the 110.00 level continues to elude the former, while antipodeans are indecisive after mostly softer than expected Trade and Retail Sales from Australia and with New Zealand observing Waitangi Day.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued with prices declining below 152.50 amid the lack of demand for safe havens and with participants also sidelined ahead of today’s 30yr JGB auction.</p>",
