(BuzzFeed)</p><p>UK opposition Labour Party was said to have received an updated offer from government as part of ongoing Brexit negotiations, although there were later comments from Labour leader Corbyn that the government does not seem to be moving from red lines and so far Labour has not seen the commitments it wanted to see.

Symantec Corp (SYMC) shares traded higher after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock. Amazon (AMZN) caught a tailwind following an upgrade at SocGen to a Buy rating. P&amp;G Corp (PG) shares traded higher after a Wells Fargo analyst turned bullish on the stock. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) shares rose after an analyst at Jefferies upgraded Wynn to a buy rating. Oil and oil related companies (SLB, COG, CXO, EOG) outperformed on the day off the back of advances in crude after conflict in Libya escalated. General Electric (GE) shares traded lower after JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tulsa downgraded the conglomerate. Boeing (BA) shares were hit after a cut to its monthly 737 Max production rate (from 52 to 42) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded its outlook for the stock. Dollar Tree (DLTR) shares traded lower after activist investor Starboard Value LP withdrew its nominations for directors on the dollar stores board.

However, over the course of the session, the complex gradually eased, with some citing chunky supply this week out of the US Treasury, as well as the corporate slate (books on Aramco's USD 10bln M&amp;A bonds are said to be above USD 60bln). Lower volatility in equities and generally stable S&amp;P also left little need for the haven, while some also cited increased chatter about the reflation trade, too. Some suggest that the rate cut pricing in Fed funds might be a function of the Fed's independence under threat (Board nominee Moore has called for rate cuts recently, as has NEC director Kudlow), however, with optimism that a US/China trade deal can help boost global growth, and stabilising metrics in China too (which can feed through into Europe), there are certainly questions about the need for immediately looser policy. Ahead of FOMC minutes this week, money markets price under 50% chance of a rate cut in 2019 (vs over 50% at the end of last week). Major curve spreads were mixed at settlement. US T-note futures (M9) settled 4+ ticks lower at 123-14+.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities mixed, dollar down, Treasuries down, crude up.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> Libyan tensions rise; Boeing cuts 737 MAX production; US factory orders in line; Lords approve Brexit deal, send it back to Commons.</p><p><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>US NFIB Business Optimism; EIA Short Term; Outlook &amp; Summer Fuels Outlook; Fed's Quarles &amp; Clarida; Supply from Japan, UK &amp; US.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May on Sunday defended her strategy to reach out to opposition Labour, warning that without opposition support, Brexit might not happen. Cross-party talks are expected to resume this week, despite the limited progress made amid conflicting reports last week. If an agreement remains elusive, there is a chance of further indicative votes ahead of Wednesday's emergency EU summit (May will meet Macron and Merkel in advance of the meetings to set out her rationale for the extension). In the event both approaches fail to garner a majority for May's deal, May hopes EU leaders will grant a request to extend the Article 50 process until 30 June, although there may be reluctance from the EU27 if May has little to offer in terms of how she intends to proceed to try and avoid a no-deal Brexit. As things stand, the UK will leave the EU on Friday 12 April, though the consensus sees at least some extension being granted. In the Upper House, the Lords approved legislation forcing PM May to delay Brexit and avoid no-deal Brexit on 12 April; sends legislation back to Lower House for vote, forcing UK PM May to consult Parliament on any delay; it may also give Parliament the power to scrutinise May’s request for an extension. The law is likely to be voted through the Commons later Monday or on Tuesday. From the EU perspective, the EU wants UK to approve Brexit deal this week or face a long delay, according to BuzzFeed, which reported that the EU27 are to consider a 9-month or 12-month extension if a withdrawal deal isn't approved by Friday; if a new Brexiteer PM tries to cause problems during a long extension, the EU want to be able to end the extension period.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLES USD 1.32 HIGHER AT USD 64.40/BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLES USD 0.76 HIGHER AT USD 71.10/BBL. </strong>The oil complex continued its rally at the start of the week, printing fresh YTD highs, with supply very much being a driving force. The dominating narrative is the ongoing conflict in Libya, as the Eastern forces continue to clash with the Western forces over control over the city of Tripoli, and surrounding arrears, concerns over the country’s ability to export its approximate 1.1mln BPD capacity grow larger. Whilst the OPEC member’s current oil operations remain unaffected, with key oil fields – such as El Sharara – far away from the conflict, history in the region suggests the country’s exporting facilities could be forfeited if the Tripoli-based National Oil Corp.’s export terminals are captured by the Eastern forces; a similar situation occurred back in June 2018. However, although Brent saw gains, it was WTI that saw the most gains, in particular the May contract. Analyst at Citi comment, “this could be the result of a technical squeeze, surprising strength after the DOE reported an unexpected 7.2mln bbls build in commercial crude stocks for last week, but may also be signalling a concern that US exports are too high, or will be once refiners complete seasonal maintenance work.” Also likely to be playing into the narrowing of the WTI/Brent Arb are some slightly bearish comments from Saudi Arabia and Russia, where Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said the market is moving towards balance and that the Kingdom sees no need for additional production cuts; Russian officials also hinted that the OPEC+ group should raise its output in June. Looking ahead, current expectations for US energy inventories – for the recent week – see crude stocks building 2.5mln bbls; both the products are seen drawing, distillates by 1.4mln bbls, and gasoline by 2.1mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* SPX +0.1% at 2896, NDX +0.3% at 7600, DJI -0.3% at 26341.

Symantec Corp (SYMC) shares traded higher after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock. Amazon (AMZN) caught a tailwind following an upgrade at SocGen to a Buy rating. P&amp;G Corp (PG) shares traded higher after a Wells Fargo analyst turned bullish on the stock. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) shares rose after an analyst at Jefferies upgraded Wynn to a buy rating. Oil and oil related companies (SLB, COG, CXO, EOG) outperformed on the day off the back of advances in crude after conflict in Libya escalated. General Electric (GE) shares traded lower after JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tulsa downgraded the conglomerate. Boeing (BA) shares were hit after a cut to its monthly 737 Max production rate (from 52 to 42) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded its outlook for the stock. Dollar Tree (DLTR) shares traded lower after activist investor Starboard Value LP withdrew its nominations for directors on the dollar stores board. Southwest Airlines (LUV) shares traded lower after being downgraded by Raymond James on concerns that the Boeing 737 Max grounding could last through summer. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) shares fell after it pledged to invest USD 800mln in Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 4+ TICKS LOWER AT 123-14+. </strong>US Treasury yields rose by 1.5bps-2bps at settlement. However, the day started off with a bid, and weak German data lent support. However, over the course of the session, the complex gradually eased, with some citing chunky supply this week out of the US Treasury, as well as the corporate slate (books on Aramco's USD 10bln M&amp;A bonds are said to be above USD 60bln). Lower volatility in equities and generally stable S&amp;P also left little need for the haven, while some also cited increased chatter about the reflation trade, too. Some suggest that the rate cut pricing in Fed funds might be a function of the Fed's independence under threat (Board nominee Moore has called for rate cuts recently, as has NEC director Kudlow), however, with optimism that a US/China trade deal can help boost global growth, and stabilising metrics in China too (which can feed through into Europe), there are certainly questions about the need for immediately looser policy. Ahead of FOMC minutes this week, money markets price under 50% chance of a rate cut in 2019 (vs over 50% at the end of last week). Major curve spreads were mixed at settlement.</p><p><strong>* WEEK'S SUPPLY:</strong> The US Treasury will this week auction USD 78bln in 3-year (USD 38bln, Tue), 10-year (USD 24bln, Wed) and 30-year (USD 16blnm Thu). With USD 77.8bln maturing at month-end settlement, the auctions will raise around USD 200mln in new cash, according to TD Securities. The bank adds that with USD 180mln maturing on the Fed's balance sheet, there will be nearly no add-ons at mid-month settlement. Recent auctions have generally performed well, with investors piling into havens at the beginning of the year amid the market uncertainty. While market pricing remains elevated (around 50% chance of a rate cut by the end of the year), it has backed off from extremes. TD Securities expects that, with the Fed's balance sheet run-off ending in October, the bank expects the Treasury to cut auction sizes in the 2-year to 3-year sector, which could support demand at the front-end.</p><p><strong>* 3-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> Cover was higher at the previous 3-year auction to the highest in 2019 (2.6x) even as yields declined in the run up to the auction. Final demand, however, was somewhat weak, Barclays notes, with dealers taking down marginally more supply than the first two auctions in the year. The prior auctions tailed by 0.4bps, which was wider than the recent average around 0.2bps. In terms of the upcoming auction, Barclays says the current 3-year note (the March 2022) is a potential deferred cheapest-to-date candidate in TUM0 and trades rich on the curve, similar to other deferred TU CTD securities (ie, Dec21s, Sep21s, and Jun21s). As a result, Barclays estimates that the WI should trade at a liquidity discount to current 3s. \"Furthermore, the quoted roll is biased higher due to the 0.6bps bad day adjustment in the WI; the bond matures on Good Friday (April 15, 2022), which is no settlement,\" adding that they believe that the WI roll is appropriately priced.\"</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>The Greenback traded with an offered tone. EUR was done no favours by a downside surprise to the German trade data; however, the EUR was reportedly a beneficiary of short-covering, according to some newswires, while upbeat China data and ‘progress’ in US/China talks has supported the currency, helping to avoid another YTD low. GBP was supported by the weaker buck, and generally shrugged-off Brexit uncertainty, though couldn’t eke out gains against the EUR. As we have been in recent weeks, many analysts now are upping their warnings about the potential of a no deal Brexit, perhaps as soon as Friday in a worst-case scenario. Havens benefited from the Buck’s weakness; gold jumped to a week high above $1,300, also seeing interest as equities struggled at times. The JPY broke above its 200dma around 111.50 and has been magnetic to that level since – some desks note chunky expiries at Tuesday’s NY Cut between 111.00 the figure and 111.40, as well as the 112.00 level. The dollar’s weakness lent support to the EMFX complex, though TRY was the outlier with President Erdogan’s party ha suggested the role of crime in the recent local elections, arguing that the mayoral race in Istanbul was too close to concede.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>The Greenback traded with an offered tone. EUR was done no favours by a downside surprise to the German trade data; however, the EUR was reportedly a beneficiary of short-covering, according to some newswires, while upbeat China data and ‘progress’ in US/China talks has supported the currency, helping to avoid another YTD low. GBP was supported by the weaker buck, and generally shrugged-off Brexit uncertainty, though couldn’t eke out gains against the EUR. As we have been in recent weeks, many analysts now are upping their warnings about the potential of a no deal Brexit, perhaps as soon as Friday in a worst-case scenario. Havens benefited from the Buck’s weakness; gold jumped to a week high above $1,300, also seeing interest as equities struggled at times. The JPY broke above its 200dma around 111.50 and has been magnetic to that level since – some desks note chunky expiries at Tuesday’s NY Cut between 111.00 the figure and 111.40, as well as the 112.00 level. The dollar’s weakness lent support to the EMFX complex, though TRY was the outlier with President Erdogan’s party ha suggested the role of crime in the recent local elections, arguing that the mayoral race in Istanbul was too close to concede. Meanwhile, the Aussie was firmer, despite weak job ads data overnight; the market will be looking to comments from RBA Dep Gov Debelle, who speaks a couple of times this week. CNH was a touch higher; PBOC skipped open market operations for the 13th straight session, and cited relatively high levels of liquidity in the banking system, which analysts said can offset the impact of banks' reserve requirement payments. However, loose policy is expected to continue, and overnight, the government stated it would support SMEs by helping to lower funding costs via certain preferential monetary policies, and make access to capital markets and accelerated IPOs easier.</p>",

The dominating narrative is the ongoing conflict in Libya, as the Eastern forces continue to clash with the Western forces over control over the city of Tripoli, and surrounding arrears, concerns over the country’s ability to export its approximate 1.1mln BPD capacity grow larger. Whilst the OPEC member’s current oil operations remain unaffected, with key oil fields – such as El Sharara – far away from the conflict, history in the region suggests the country’s exporting facilities could be forfeited if the Tripoli-based National Oil Corp.’s export terminals are captured by the Eastern forces; a similar situation occurred back in June 2018. However, although Brent saw gains, it was WTI that saw the most gains, in particular the May contract. Analyst at Citi comment, “this could be the result of a technical squeeze, surprising strength after the DOE reported an unexpected 7.2mln bbls build in commercial crude stocks for last week, but may also be signalling a concern that US exports are too high, or will be once refiners complete seasonal maintenance work.” Also likely to be playing into the narrowing of the WTI/Brent Arb are some slightly bearish comments from Saudi Arabia and Russia, where Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said the market is moving towards balance and that the Kingdom sees no need for additional production cuts; Russian officials also hinted that the OPEC+ group should raise its output in June. Looking ahead, current expectations for US energy inventories – for the recent week – see crude stocks building 2.5mln bbls; both the products are seen drawing, distillates by 1.4mln bbls, and gasoline by 2.1mln bbls.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NOK</strong></p><p>The Norwegian Crown is sharply outperforming as oil prices extend their bull run amidst escalating trouble in Libya and reaffirmed guidance from the Norges Bank via Governor Ohlsen who maintains that the next rate hike is likely to be rolled out in H2 this year. Indeed, Eur/Nok is down around 9.6150 even though the single currency has cleared chart resistance and recent peaks vs the Dollar – see below.</p><p><strong>DXY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The index has pulled back further from best levels amidst broad Dollar losses and is now testing bids and psychological interest at the 97.000 level after US data showing a decline in factory orders and durable goods (latter mostly unrevised from soft prelim prints). The DXY is holding just above the base of a 97.384-96.976 range and eyeing technical support at 96.806 (March 22 low).</p><p><strong>SEK/EUR</strong></p><p>The Swedish Krona has overcome some weak Swedish manufacturing orders to post gains vs the Eur in line with its Scandi peer and also on the back of a relatively hawkish Riksbank vs ECB, as the cross probes below 10.4100. However, Eur/Usd has breached heavy resistance circa 1.1250 to reach 1.1275 including a Fib, multi-highs since testing ytd lows under 1.1200 which were made after March’s dovish ECB policy meeting. On that note, this month’s meeting falls on Wednesday due to the end of week IMF gathering that President Draghi is attending and we have a full preview available on the Research Suite that can be found via our headline feed too.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>Another major currency to benefit from the latest leg up in crude and a generally weak Usd, as the Loonie continues its strong recovery from last Friday’s lows (post contrasting Canadian and US payrolls) and shrugs off more disappointing data in the form of housing starts and building permits. Indeed, Usd/Cad has retreated further from 1.3400+ through its 100 DMA (1.3329) and eyeing 1.3300-1.3296 next (latter representing the April low so far from last Wednesday).</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The next best G10 units as the Aussie climbs above its 55 DMA (0.7118) towards 0.7130 and the Kiwi moves away from decent option expiries at 0.6725 to retest 0.6750, while the Jpy has peered above 111.30.</p><p><strong>GBP/CHF</strong></p><p>Both ending Monday’s EU session firmer vs the Greenback, but modestly compared to the gains noted elsewhere. Cable is still pivoting 1.3050 awaiting more Brexit news as UK PM May and the Labour Party continue to try and thrash out a deal before the former heads off for Pre-EU Summit meetings with German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron. Note, latest reports suggest that the opposition party has received an updated offer, but it remains unclear whether a customs union if included. Meanwhile, the Lords will meet later to debate the Cooper bill that was passed by the HoC by the narrowest margin last week and will give Parliament blocking rights against a no deal via forcing the Government to request and extension beyond April 12. Turning to the Franc, and having stuck near parity in early trade Usd/Chf is now closer to the bottom of a range that has extended to 0.9978.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Try is off worst levels, but still languishing amidst the ongoing municipal election result recount in Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey contemplating military action in Syria, the CBRT’s FX swap rate cut (150 bp) and decision to restart 1 week repos. The Lira remains around 5.7000 vs the Dollar.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>*WHERE WE STAND</strong>: At the back end of last week, UK PM May sent a letter to the European Council requesting a Brexit extension to June 30th (currently April 12th) with potential to terminate early should a deal be ratified before then. PM May also stated that preparations have commence for the UK to take part in the European Parliamentary elections on May 23rd.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*MIDDLE GROUND</strong>: Talks between the UK government and opposition party continue with further talks expected this week in search of a compromise. It seems as though talks are not going as smoothly as some had expected, with source reports on Friday noting that Brexit talks between PM May and Labour leader Corbyn are not going well. The Labour leader noted that he was \"waiting to see the red lines move\" and had not \"noticed any great change in the government's position\", whilst the Labour MP Long-Bailey (who is involved in Labour talks with the government) said, over the weekend, that Labour was yet to see the compromise proposals needed to agree a deal. Furthermore, sources cited by BBC's Eardley stated that the Labour party want a firm indication that the government is prepared to reopen the political declaration, there may be some movement later (either talks or a new offer). The UK Foreign Minister Hunt added to this rhetoric by stating that talks with Labour are not easy.</p><p>Early on Monday, there were reports that UK PM May could offer the Labour Party a post-Brexit customs union, with weekend press reporting that PM May PM May is set to offer Jeremy Corbyn a legally binding soft Brexit deal with a “Boris lock” that would make it difficult for a future Eurosceptic prime minister to tear up after she leaves No 10. The mechanics of this deal is not yet known.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*EU RHETORIC</strong>: The 27 European heads of state and government will convene on the invitation on European Council President Donald Tusk on Wednesday 10th April. On Friday, it was reported that EU's Tusk is preparing to offer the UK a 12-month flexible extension which would permit the UK to leave as early as 1st July if the UK has passed with Withdrawal Agreement by that point, according to a senior EU official.</p><p>The leaders are set to discuss an extension to Brexit in order to avoid the UK crashing out of the EU. Where do they currently stand?</p><ul><li><strong>GERMANY</strong>: EU sources stated that German Chancellor Merkel is open to backing PM May’s request for a short Brexit extension. Sources also noted that the Chancellor seeks to keep pressure on UK MPs to support the Withdrawal Agreement.</li><li><strong>FRANCE</strong>: France has been dragging its heels in regard to an extension, with the country stating (multiple times) that a clear plan needs to be set out for an extension to be permitted. On Friday, a source close to French President Macron suggests that talk of a further extension to Article 50 is premature and the EU 27 criteria for an extension (a credible alternative plan) has not been met yet.</li><li><strong>IRELAND</strong>: The Irish PM stated that it is “extremely unlikely” that an EU 27 country will veto a request to delay Brexit, although he stated that his own preference was for a longer extension that the proposed June 30th.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>*THIS WEEK’S SCHEDULE:</strong></p><p><strong>MONDAY</strong>:</p><ul><li>UK House of Lords are to vote on the Cooper Bill brought forth last week (see below for further details)</li><li>Cross Party talks to continue</li><li>Shadow cabinet to meet today for an update on cross-party talks</li><li>PM May to give a statement on Brexit extension</li><li>PM having a meeting with a delegation of ministers on the Brexit offer to Labour at 17:00 BST</li><li>HoC Brexit motion 19:00 BST</li></ul><p><strong>TUESDAY</strong>:</p><ul><li>If the Letwin-Cooper bill passes, parliament decides on the length of the extension PM May will request at Wednesday’s Brexit Summit.</li><li>If cross-party talks result in a compromise of some sort, this could be discussed, debated and voted on by MPs.

ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) both opened higher with commodity-related sectors among the biggest gainers in Australia due to strength in metal prices and after WTI crude rallied to fresh YTD highs above the USD 63.00/bbl level, while risk appetite in Japan was less decisive and eventually waned as exporters contended with flows into JPY. Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (U/C) were initially buoyed on return from their extended weekend as they played catch up to the optimism from last week’s US-China trade talks in which both sides noted significant progress was made and with discussions to continue via teleconference this week, while China also plans to ease the burden on businesses in which it will reduce companies’ social insurance contributions by CNY 300bln. However, the mainland gradually deteriorated as some were kept cautious by reports that plans for a US-China joint statement hit a stalemate due to differences regarding access to China’s market. Finally, 10yr JGBs were mildly higher with prices supported as the initial positive momentum in the region waned and with the BoJ present in the market for JPY 280bln in JGBs, while prices also tracked the rebound seen in T-notes in the wake of the US jobs data where weak wage growth subsequently saw the probability of a Fed rate cut this year increase to 75% before paring back to 50%.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(Times)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p>A subdued start to the week for European equities [Stoxx 600 -0.2%] following on from a mixed Asia-Pac session as Friday’s NFP optimism waned ahead of another week filled with risk events. Broad-based losses are being experienced across major indices, whilst sectors are relatively mixed with energy names outperforming after WTI and Brent crude rallied to fresh YTD highs. In terms of individual movers, BMW (-0.4%) shares have nursed some losses after opening lower in excess of 2% amid reports that its Q1 results will be impacted by the EU fines into antitrust proceedings. This initially pressured its fellow German peers in sympathy [Daimler (-0.2%), Volkswagen (+0.4%)] who later climbed back above break-even. Sticking with Germany, Dialog Semiconductor (+1.1%) shares were bolstered amid news that the company closed a deal with US tech giant Apple (-0.4% pre-market), ahead of schedule. Finally, Fiat Chrysler (+1.3%) rose to the top of the FTSE MIB following reports the Co. signed a deal with Tesla to bypass EU emission rules. Elsewhere, Boeing (BA) CEO says they plan to cut their 737 Max monthly production by just under 20%. As such Co. are lower by 2.6% in the pre-market.</p><p>FX</p><p>USD - The Dollar continues to drift down from initial post-NFP highs as global stocks wobble and oil climbs to fresh ytd peaks. The DXY remains relatively rangebound, however, and ‘comfortably’ above the 97.000 handle within 97.230-384 parameters.</p><p>JPY/GBP - The Yen has regained a safe-haven bid and rebounded from circa 111.80 lows through 111.50 and close to the 200 DMA (111.495) vs the Greenback, while technical buying was also noted during the Asia-Pacific session in several Jpy crosses including Eur/Jpy and Nzd/Jpy that tested psychological/round number levels at 125.00 and 75.00 respectively. Meanwhile, Sterling retains an underlying bid vs the Buck above 1.3000 and is straddling 1.3050, as Eur/Gbp pivots 0.8600 in the run up to Wednesday’s EU Brexit Summit when UK PM May will present the case for another A 50 extension backed by a withdrawal plan or at least a strategy to avert no deal on April 12. On that note, she will resume talks with the Labour Party in an effort to find a compromise amidst reports that the opposition want a firm commitment to re-opening the PD rather than additions to the existing document.</p><p>EUR - The single currency is also holding above a big figure mark vs the Dollar and 2019 lows not far below 1.1200, but chart resistance around 1.1250 and a key Fib is still capping the upside, while hefty option expiry interest at 1.1225 (1.4 bn) is also weighing on the headline pair.</p><p>NZD/CAD/AUD/CHF - All relatively flat and narrowly mixed vs the Usd, as the Kiwi meanders between 0.6723-37 and also has expiries close by to exert some influence into the NY cut (1 bn at 0.6725). Elsewhere, another upturn in oil prices has helped the Loonie reverse some post-Canadian jobs data losses within a 1.3390-70 band, and is also supporting the NOK vs the Eur with the cross back down through 9.6500. Note, Barclays has shorted Eur/Nok and is looking for a move to 9.5908 with a 9.7100 stop. Elsewhere, the Aussie is hovering around 0.7100 and Franc is sitting tight near parity.</p><p>EM - The Lira has weakened even further vs the Dollar as municipal election results are recounted in Istanbul and Turkey mulls military action in Syria, while the CBRT has cut its FX swap rate by 150 bp and decided to restart 1 week refunding operations. Usd/Try up over 5.7000 and 5.7100+ at one stage.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Bunds have retreated further from overnight Eurex highs and a bit deeper below parity to a fresh 165.24 low, in stark contrast to Gilts that extended gains off the 128.00 level to 22 ticks and 21 ticks from last Friday’s close at one stage. A better than expected Eurozone Sentix survey may have prompted some core debt selling as some periphery spreads tightened and Germany’s BDB banking association called for the ECB to introduce a tiered deposit system if rates are not normalised by year end, which looks highly unlikely given the toll-back in policy guidance last month. Conversely, UK bonds spiked amidst reports highlighting tough talks between Conservative and Labour Parties on Brexit, but the 10 year benchmark has reversed in sympathy with Bunds to 127.97 since, like US Treasuries ahead of data including revisions to prelim durable good and factory orders.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Further supply-side woes have bolstered the energy complex to YTD highs with WTI and Brent futures revisiting levels last seen in November 2018 (USD 63/bbl and USD 70/bbl respectively). Gains are spurred as conflict in Libya escalates, with Hafta ordering his troops to march towards Tripoli. The fight has not yet effected oil supply, with Port Zawiya closely monitored by oil traders as it is the closest to the conflict. The port is scheduled to load 6mln barrels of crude in April which is subject to change if shipments are delayed. Amidst this, the oil complex last week saw speculators adding to their net long positive positions, with managed money positions in ICE Brent rising by just under 27k to result in net long speculative positions at almost 350k lots, the largest since the end of October 2018. Elsewhere, Saudi Energy Minister noted that he does not believe the Kingdom needs to cut output below its target, whilst a key architect of Russia’s OPEC+ deal said that the members could raise oil output in its June meeting. On the Aramco front, Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih stated that the Aramco bond could attract demand north of USD 30bln (vs. touted USD 10bln) which will be used as part of a payment for the 70% purchase of Sabic (valued at USD 6.9bln).</p><p>In the metals complex, gold prices are underpinned as the Greenback softened overnight and continues to pull back during the European session thus far. Demand for the yellow metal was also reflected in an increase in China’s gold reserves which showed the fourth consecutive month of gold purchases. Elsewhere, copper benefitted amid overnight gains across Chinese commodity prices in which Dalian iron ore futures extended on record highs, while Shanghai rebar and hot rolled coil rallied over 3% shortly after the open.</p><p>Saudi Energy Minister Al- Falih says he does not believe the kingdom needs to cut output below its target. (Newswires)</p><p>- Also, reaffirms commitment to being a stabilizing force in energy markets</p><p>Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih says the Aramco bond deal is to close on Wednesday; adds that the demand for the bond could be above USD 30bln. Subsequently, reported that Saudi Aramco may price its bond on Tuesday afternoon UK time; Saudi Aramco are to open books for their debut international bond later today., according to sources.

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/21556/download\">here</a>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>A subdued start to the week for European equities [Stoxx 600 -0.2%] following on from a mixed Asia-Pac session as Friday’s NFP optimism waned</strong> ahead of another week filled with risk events. Broad-based losses are being experienced across major indices, whilst sectors are relatively mixed with energy names outperforming after WTI and Brent crude rallied to fresh YTD highs. In terms of individual movers, BMW (-0.4%) shares have nursed some losses after opening lower in excess of 2% amid reports that its Q1 results will be impacted by the EU fines into antitrust proceedings. This initially pressured its fellow German peers in sympathy [Daimler (+0.1%), Volkswagen (+0.4%)] who later climbed back above break-even. Sticking with Germany, Dialog Semiconductor (+0.9%) shares were bolstered amid news that the company closed a deal with US tech giant Apple (-0.2% pre-market), ahead of schedule. Finally, Fiat Chrysler (+1.5%) rose to the top of the FTSE MIB following reports the Co. signed a deal with Tesla to bypass EU emission rules.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Dollar continues to drift down from initial post-NFP highs as global stocks wobble and oil climbs to fresh ytd peaks. The DXY remains relatively rangebound, however, and ‘comfortably’ above the 97.000 handle within 97.230-384 parameters.</p><p><strong>JPY/GBP</strong> - The Yen has regained a safe-haven bid and rebounded from circa 111.80 lows through 111.50 and close to the 200 DMA (111.495) vs the Greenback, while technical buying was also noted during the Asia-Pacific session in several Jpy crosses including Eur/Jpy and Nzd/Jpy that tested psychological/round number levels at 125.00 and 75.00 respectively. Meanwhile, Sterling retains an underlying bid vs the Buck above 1.3000 and is straddling 1.3050, as Eur/Gbp pivots 0.8600 in the run up to Wednesday’s EU Brexit Summit when UK PM May will present the case for another A 50 extension backed by a withdrawal plan or at least a strategy to avert no deal on April 12. On that note, she will resume talks with the Labour Party in an effort to find a compromise amidst reports that the opposition want a firm commitment to re-opening the PD rather than additions to the existing document.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong> - The single currency is also holding above a big figure mark vs the Dollar and 2019 lows not far below 1.1200, but chart resistance around 1.1250 and a key Fib is still capping the upside, while hefty option expiry interest at 1.1225 (1.4 bn) is also weighing on the headline pair.</p><p><strong>NZD/CAD/AUD/CHF</strong> - All relatively flat and narrowly mixed vs the Usd, as the Kiwi meanders between 0.6723-37 and also has expiries close by to exert some influence into the NY cut (1 bn at 0.6725). Elsewhere, another upturn in oil prices has helped the Loonie reverse some post-Canadian jobs data losses within a 1.3390-70 band, and is also supporting the NOK vs the Eur with the cross back down through 9.6500. Note, Barclays has shorted Eur/Nok and is looking for a move to 9.5908 with a 9.7100 stop. Elsewhere, the Aussie is hovering around 0.7100 and Franc is sitting tight near parity.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> -The Lira has weakened even further vs the Dollar as municipal election results are recounted in Istanbul and Turkey mulls military action in Syria, while the CBRT has cut its FX swap rate by 150 bp and decided to restart 1 week refunding operations. Usd/Try up over 5.7000 and 5.7100+ at one stage.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong> have retreated further from overnight Eurex highs and a bit deeper below parity to a fresh 165.24 low, in stark contrast to <strong>Gilts</strong> that extended gains off the 128.00 level to 22 ticks and 21 ticks from last Friday’s close at one stage. A better than expected Eurozone Sentix survey may have prompted some core debt selling as some periphery spreads tightened and Germany’s BDB banking association called for the ECB to introduce a tiered deposit system if rates are not normalised by year end, which looks highly unlikely given the toll-back in policy guidance last month. Conversely, UK bonds spiked amidst reports highlighting tough talks between Conservative and Labour Parties on Brexit, but the 10-year benchmark has reversed in sympathy with Bunds to 127.97 since, like <strong>US Treasuries</strong> ahead of data including revisions to prelim durable good and factory orders.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>Further supply-side woes have bolstered the energy complex to YTD highs with <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures revisiting levels last seen in November 2018 (USD 63/bbl and USD 70/bbl respectively). Gains are spurred as conflict in Libya escalates, with Hafta ordering his troops to march towards Tripoli. The fight has not yet effected oil supply, with Port Zawiya closely monitored by oil traders as it is the closest to the conflict. The port is scheduled to load 6mln barrels of crude in April which is subject to change if shipments are delayed. Amidst this, the oil complex last week saw speculators adding to their net long positive positions, with managed money positions in ICE Brent rising by just under 27k to result in net long speculative positions at almost 350k lots, the largest since the end of October 2018. Elsewhere, Saudi Energy Minister noted that he does not believe the Kingdom needs to cut output below its target, whilst a key architect of Russia’s OPEC+ deal said that the members could raise oil output in its June meeting. On the Aramco front, Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih stated that the Aramco bond could attract demand north of USD 30bln (vs. touted USD 10bln) which will be used as part of a payment for the 70% purchase of Sabic (valued at USD 6.9bln).</p><p>In the metals complex, <strong>gold</strong> prices are underpinned as the Greenback softened overnight and continues to pull back during the European session thus far. Demand for the yellow metal was also reflected in an increase in China’s gold reserves which showed the fourth consecutive month of gold purchases. Elsewhere, <strong>copper</strong> benefitted amid overnight gains across Chinese commodity prices in which Dalian iron ore futures extended on record highs, while Shanghai rebar and hot rolled coil rallied over 3% shortly after the open.</p>",

The marginally firmer tone is in keeping with trade elsewhere and in contrast to a downturn in EU equities, albeit relatively contained, but UK markets are also braced for yet another pivotal week on the Brexit front given Friday’s A 50 deadline unless PM May can get Parliament back for a plan to trigger a further extension in time for the EU Summit. So it could all come down to the next 48 hours rather than 5 full days, and in particular talks between May and her Labour counterpart.</p>",

Bunds have not really reacted to German trade even though exports and imports were both considerably weaker than forecast in February, and are unlikely to be too responsive to the upcoming Eurozone Sentix index, but could glean some impetus from ECB’s de Galhau later, although in truth the comments should not be policy related given the purdah ahead of Wednesday’s meeting.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began the week mixed as the region somewhat failed to sustain the initial momentum from last Friday’s gains on Wall St, where all majors edged higher and the S&amp;P 500 notched a 7-day win streak after better than expected NFP jobs data. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) both opened higher with commodity-related sectors among the biggest gainers in Australia due to strength in metal prices and after WTI crude rallied to fresh YTD highs above the USD 63.00/bbl level, while risk appetite in Japan was less decisive and eventually waned as exporters contended with flows into JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were initially buoyed on return from their extended weekend as they played catch up to the optimism from last week’s US-China trade talks in which both sides noted significant progress was made and with discussions to continue via teleconference this week, while China also plans to ease the burden on businesses in which it will reduce companies’ social insurance contributions by CNY 300bln. However, the mainland gradually deteriorated as some were kept cautious by reports that plans for a US-China joint statement hit a stalemate due to differences regarding access to China’s market. Finally, 10yr JGBs were mildly higher with prices supported as the initial positive momentum in the region waned and with the BoJ present in the market for JPY 280bln in JGBs, while prices also tracked the rebound seen in T-notes in the wake of the US jobs data where weak wage growth subsequently saw the probability of a Fed rate cut this year increase to 75% before paring back to 50%.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week mostly positive following last Friday’s gains on Wall St, where all majors edged higher and the S&amp;P 500 notched a 7-day win streak after better than expected NFP jobs data. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) are mixed with commodity-related sectors among the biggest gainers in Australia due to strength in metal prices and after WTI crude rallied to fresh YTD highs above the USD 63.00/bbl level, while Japanese trade was less decisive as risk sentiment contended with flows into JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) are buoyed on return from their extended weekend as they play catch up to the optimism from last week’s US-China trade talks in which both sides noted significant progress was made and with discussions to continue via teleconference this week, while China also plans further efforts to support business in which it will reduce companies’ social insurance contributions by CNY 300bln.</p><p>In FX markets, price action is relatively quiet which is typical of the post-NFP lull with the DXY just giving back some of the gains seen after the better than expected job numbers. This has helped its major European counterparts recover some of the recent lost ground with EUR/USD now lingering near a large option expiry of EUR 1.4bln at 1.1225, while GBP/USD resumes its rebound from support around 1.3000 where some analysts noted a bullish dragonfly doji pattern had formed on the 30 minute chart. Conversely, AUD and NZD are lacklustre despite the mostly positive risk tone and gains across commodities, as the antipodeans remain hampered by the current dovish consensus for their respective central banks and with AUD/USD dejected after a slip below the 0.7100 handle. USD/JPY is lower amid a deterioration of risk appetite in Japan and amid technical selling in related crosses in which EUR/JPY and NZD/JPY tested support at the 125.00 and the 75.00 levels respectively.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are mildly higher with prices supported as the initial positive momentum in Japanese stocks gradually waned and with the BoJ present in the market for JPY 280bln in JGBs, while prices also track the rebound seen in T-notes in the wake of the US jobs data where weak wage growth subsequently saw the probability of a Fed rate cut this year increase to 75% before paring back to 50%.</p>",
