The Treasury’s 3-year auction was solid, stopping through the screens by 0.1bps, with cover above recent averages; the breakdown showed dealer participation the smallest since August 2017, while direct bidding was in line. Tomorrow the US will auction 10s; from a relative value perspective, the 10-year sector has some slight set up ahead of Wednesday's auction, analysts said, and it trades marginally cheap in asset swap as well as on the curve against 5s and 30s. SocGen also feels that it looks cheap on an outright basis, and notes that the current 10-year yield is trading above the stop-out rates for all of the last three auctions. SocGen observes that, since the last auction cycle, 2s10s curve has steepened, emphasising the relative cheapness of the sector. Additionally, SocGen points out that the current 10 is trading special in repo, which indicates stronger demand for the issue. With that said, dealer holdings in the 7-11 year bucket are relatively high, SocGen says, and with the recent run of tails, could adversely impact demand at the sale. T-note futures (Z9) settled 21 ticks lower at 128-29+.</p>",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>SNAPSHOT: Equities up/flat, Treasuries down, USD up, crude up.</strong></li><li><strong>REAR VIEW: Risk-on on reports US mulling removing some China tariffs; ISM non-mfg upside beat; PBOC cut MLF rate; USDCNH falls beneath 7.00; US economic optimism rose, IBD said</strong></li><li><strong>COMING-UP: German Factory Orders, Eurozone Services PMIs, Retail Sales, US Nonfarm Productivity, Unit Labour Costs.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP: </strong>Overnight news that the US was mulling some rollback of tariffs on China set the mood for risk-on trade in the APAC session, with little bother from China's Caixin PMIs which fell in the month to an 8-month low, but were in line with expectations (there was more attention on China cutting its MLF rate). USDCNY fell below the 7.00 handle, while there was further unwind out of havens XAU, JPY and CHF. That tone continued through European and US trade, with stocks printing a fresh record high, and the Treasury curve bear-steepened. Traders note that there has not been either any acknowledgement of the FT report from key US officials, nor a denial, and as such, that remains an important immediate focus. Also in focus will be Governor election outcomes in Mississippi, Kentucky (both Trump states) and Virginia (leans Dem), overnight, which analysts will use as an initial read on the political mood among some Americans.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA TRADE: </strong>Headlines continue to take a constructive tone; the FT reported that US officials were considering whether to remove some existing tariffs on Chinese goods as a concession to seal a partial deal, and is mulling whether to roll back levies on USD 112bln of Chinese imports (including clothing, appliances, and flat screen monitors) which were introduced on 1st September at a rate of 15%. The report stated that the US was also considering calling off the tariffs due to come into effect on 15th December. China had requested tariffs be eliminated in return for signing the Phase One deal. However, the FT report also noted that hawks within the Administration were oppose the concession, and Trump himself was being regarded as an obstacle rather than a proponent. From the China perspective, Global Times editor stated that Beijing will insist that the US proportionally remove existing additional tariffs simultaneously with China, and China would not accept the US keeping all tariffs and only suspending new tariff threats in exchange for any major concessions; it is worth noting that this has always been China’s position. In later trade, Nikkei reported that an emboldened China is refusing to flinch on tariffs in US trade talks, adding that a complete removal of levies remains sticking point for 'phase one' deal.</p><p><strong>* PBOC MLF RATE CUT:</strong> China's central bank unexpectedly cut its rate on MLF operations by 5bps to 3.25% (first cut since early 2016); Analysts at UBS said the move can provide the market some clues on the Chinese central bank’s latest stance on monetary policy, after it refrained from injecting liquidity into the banking system via OMO for more than 1 week and skipped the widely expected TMLF in October. The PBOC overnight offered CNY 400bln of MLFs after it drained CNY 590bln of liquidity over the last few trading sessions. The central bank said that the injection was intended to replace the CNY 403.5bln of MLFs due today. UBS questions the need to lower the 1-year MLF rate by a mere 5bps, and reasons that the PBOC is trying to ease in a very cautious manner this time. \"Rising CPI inflation and macro leverage ratio have become the main constraints on the magnitude of policy loosening in Q4, therefore, the room of policy loosening is likely to be limited in the rest of 2019,\" the bank said.</p><p><strong>* US TRADE DATA:</strong> The trade deficit narrowed to USD 52.5bln in September, in line with expectations; it confirms that net trade will be a neutral contributor to GDP growth in Q3, although Capital Economics says it still expects it to become a renewed drag in Q4. The narrowing came on the back of a 0.9% M/M fall in exports offset by the 1.7% decline in imports. \"The possibility of a trade deal with China could provide a boost to exports, particularly if the Chinese step up purchases of agricultural products,\" Capital Economics said, but with that said, it still is \"sceptical that a lasting deal will be reached and, in any case, the continued weakness of the global surveys suggests that further weakness in exports lies ahead.\"</p><p><strong>* ISM NON-MANUFACTURING (OCT): </strong>The services ISM rose above expectations (54.7 against an expected 53.5, versus a prior 52.6). Business Activity rose, as did new orders (in contrast to the Markit services PMI released earlier) though export orders declined by 2.0 points. Prices fell 3.4 points. Capital Economics said the data was a welcome rebound after the fall in September, though the index remains off levels implied by the growth rate of core retail sales. The consultancy also said that the trade war (particularly the 1st August announcement of tariffs on consumer goods) has driven a wedge between the survey and the retail sales numbers. \"Under normal conditions we’d expect the index to be in the 58-to-59 range, given the hefty increases in core retail sales in recent months,\" CapEco writes, \"we doubt the gap will widen, though, given media reports suggesting that the tariffs due to be imposed on the remaining un-tariffed consumer goods, on 15th December will not be imposed if the Phase One trade deal is finalised, but it's too much to expect near-term mean reversion in the ISM; trade uncertainty remains high and the initial consumer goods tariffs have not been rolled back.\"</p><p><strong>* US IBD/TIPP: </strong>Economic optimism rose in November to 52.9, with the six-month outlook index rising by 8 points to 47.0, while the personal financial outlook improved by 1.8 points to 61.7. However, confidence in federal economic policies fell by 6.5 points to 50.1. The report said \"the phase one trade deal with China coupled with a strong labor market, has helped to stabilize American's economic confidence,\" and additionally, \"the stock market is reaching new highs, which helps boost consumer sentiment. Even though Americans are split on the direction of the economy, recession fears stay low. Low inflation and fuel prices are reducing pressure on consumer wallets. The constant drumbeat of impeachment has yet to take its toll on consumer confidence.\"</p><p><strong>* RBA:</strong> The Reserve Bank of Australia overnight stood pat on policy at 75bps as expected. The statement was largely unchanged, and maintained its easing bias, however, it did note the impact of previous cuts to stimulate the economy, which desks said was slightly hawkish. Westpac's analysts felt there was nothing in the statement that would cause any revision to its view that rates will be unchanged in December, with the next rate cut coming in February 2020. The repetition of the line ““the Board will continue to monitor developments” implies that there is no urgency for the Central Bank to move, whilst the reference to prior rate decision – “the easing of monetary policy since June”-&nbsp; suggests from past experience that the RBA is unlikely to move in the near future, the analysts note. “Following that move, the state of the economy will be such that further stimulus will still be required, without which an unwelcome lift in the Australian Dollar would pose a significant headwind for the RBA’s current forecast of return to trend growth in 2020,\" the bank wrote, \"under those circumstances, it seems reasonable that the RBA might move towards some unconventional measures to boost demand and retain downward pressure on the Australian Dollar.\" Participants will now be eyeing the release of the Central Bank’s Statement on Monetary Policy to add more meat to the bones regarding the RBA’s view on the economy, with expectations for modest downgrades to CPI and GDP forecasts.</p><p><strong>* RIKSBANK:</strong> Riksbank’s October Minutes are a contrast from the October decision itself regarding a December 25bp hike, with the minutes highlighting clear concern amongst policy members regarding such a move. Notably, Jansson noted that the downward trend in long-term five-year inflation expectations is worrying, while Skingsley stated it is justifiable to question whether a hike is appropriate at all; given slowdown signals and ongoing global economy uncertainty. In-spite of these comments all members supported the decision and repo rate forecast in October; although, one board member did express hesitation regarding increasing the rate at years end – instead, calling for a hike further down the forecast period. Given the budding dovish disagreement amongst some board members focus will, in the event the Bank does hike in December, be on the guidance for the rate path ahead as well as any formal dissenters. After December, the minutes note (in-line with the meeting) that the repo rate is expected to be left unchanged at 0.0% for a prolonged period and a more cautious approach to monetary policy.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.1% at 3075, NASDAQ-100 0% at 8210, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0.1% at 27493; </strong>SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 0.1%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.3%, Energy&nbsp; 0.5%, Financials&nbsp; 0.4%, Health Care&nbsp; -0.9%, Industrials&nbsp; 0.2%, Information Technology&nbsp; -0.1%, Materials&nbsp; 0.3%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; -0.1%, Utilities&nbsp; -1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Walgreen’s (WBA) spiked on source reports it has been in talks with Evercore about exploring a deal to go private, in what would be the largest ever leveraged buyout, although the report does caveat it with a deal is far from certain. Xerox (XRX) an outperformer as it restructured its relationship with Fujifilm where XRX will receive USD 2.3bln in the sale of stakes in Fujifilm subsidiaries. Adobe (ADBE) traded higher after its analyst day where it provided forecasts in line with expectations and announced updates on three major segments: creative cloud, document cloud and experience cloud. The analyst day led to a slew of PT upgrades at Jefferies, Citi and Wells Fargo, which saw the stock hit two-month highs. Elektrek reported that Tesla (TSLA) is still in need of a manufacturing license in China, although it is aiming to achieve one by year end. It was also reported, Tesla employ 42000 people across the world, with 3200 in China. Netflix (NFLX) were pressured on Tuesday as Disney (DIS) announced it would feature a permanent library on its Disney+, instead of having a rotating showbase. Elsewhere for DIS, reports noted Tier-1 desk chatter that Yipit pre-order data highlighting its Disney+ launch may come in below expectations. WWE (WWE) rose as it expanded its partnership with the Saudi General Entertainment Authority until 2027, where a second annual event will be held on a large scale. Walmart (WMT) and Tesla (TSLA) came to an agreement to put an end to the solar panel lawsuit over panel fires. Unconfirmed trader chatter noted vague activist chatter for Colgate Palmolive (CL), and unconfirmed takeover talk for Zscaler (ZS), with Cisco (CSCO) mentioned as a potential buyer in a deal valued at USD 7.4bln.</p><p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Uber (UBER) posted a loss per share of 61c beating estimates for a loss of 81c, however revenues fell short at 3.53bln (Exp. 3.69bln), its MAU’s,&nbsp; Gross bookings and Uber eats bookings also missed expectations at 103mln (Exp. 105.5mln), 16.47bln (Exp. 16.71bln) and 3.66bln (Exp. 3.89bln), respectively. The miss in metrics saw the stock fall ~8.5% on Tuesday.&nbsp; Occidental (OXY) also lower after earnings where EPS posted a miss against expectations, in its conference call it also announced it is to cap annual production growth rate at an average of 5%. Mosaic (MOS) an underperformer today after its earnings which missed on EPS and beat on revenues, however it cut its FY18 Adj. EPS forecast. Chesapeake (CHK) reported a miss on top and bottom line and cut its CapEx view by 30%, also warning that if depressed prices persist/decline, the company's ability to comply with covenant in revolving credit facility will be adversely hit, which could cause doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.&nbsp; Tapestry (TPR) rose as it backed its FY20 outlook and reported comp sales of 1% in Coach, (Exp. 0.9%) and a decline in Kate Spade of 16% (Exp. -18%), which is to be a key focus of a comprehensive review. China same store sales remained positive, as did Taiwan. On its conference call it noted it was impacted by the protests in Hong Kong. Mylan (MYL) fell ~4%, EPS was a beat but revenues a miss, an executive noted its ongoing business transformation plan is expected to have a negative impact on revenue, adding FY Wixela revenue is to be slightly lower than expectations due to “aggressive share retention actions”, although it stands by its guidance.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Z9) SETTLES USD 0.69 HIGHER AT USD 57.23/BBL; BRENT (F0) SETTLES USD 0.83 HIGHER AT USD 62.96/BBL: </strong>The risk positive macro narrative supported the crude complex on Tuesday. The bid was also said to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, after Iran said it would further reduce commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal; Citi's analysts think this could provide the conditions for a flare-up in the geopolitical risk premium within oil prices. OPEC's World Oil outlook report saw the cartel revise its view of OPEC supply, and now sees OPEC's supply of crude oil and other liquids declining to 32.8mln BPD by 2024 (vs. 35mln BPD in 2019), as rising climate activism and wider of alternative fuels is putting the strength of long-term oil demand under more pressure, and US output surpasses 16.9mln BPD in 2024. The report sees global oil demand falling to 103.9mln BPD by 2023, a lower revision compared to the 104.5mln BPD it had previously forecast; more immediately, Secretary General Barkindo said countries are ramping up compliance with supply cut pact, and numbers he has seen suggests 2020 may have some upside potential. After market, the API will publish energy inventories; this week, the Street looks for: Crude +1.5mln, Cushing stocks +1.77mln, distillate -0.900mln, and gasoline -1.8mln.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE FUTURES (Z9) SETTLED 21 TICKS LOWER at 128-29+. </strong>The Treasury curve bear-steepened as havens saw outflows with traders noting the positive run of headlines on the US/China trade front, while ISM data also surprised to the upside, resulting in yields rising between 6-7bps across the curve. The Treasury’s 3-year auction was solid, stopping through the screens by 0.1bps, with cover above recent averages; the breakdown showed dealer participation the smallest since August 2017, while direct bidding was in line.<strong> </strong>Tomorrow the US will auction 10s; from a relative value perspective, the 10-year sector has some slight set up ahead of Wednesday's auction, analysts said, and it trades marginally cheap in asset swap as well as on the curve against 5s and 30s. SocGen also feels that it looks cheap on an outright basis, and notes that the current 10-year yield is trading above the stop-out rates for all of the last three auctions. SocGen observes that, since the last auction cycle, 2s10s curve has steepened, emphasising the relative cheapness of the sector. Additionally, SocGen points out that the current 10 is trading special in repo, which indicates stronger demand for the issue. With that said, dealer holdings in the 7-11 year bucket are relatively high, SocGen says, and with the recent run of tails, could adversely impact demand at the sale.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: </strong>Dollar continued its rally from Monday, where DXY was boosted to briefly break above the 98.00 handle matching post-FOMC highs after a promising ISM Non-mfg. PMI which surprised to the upside. The continuation of positive rhetoric on US/China trade negotiations triggering haven outflows, which drove the buck on Monday, played its part today in the early part of the session. DXY lows coincided with the 200dma at 97.46, with highs coinciding with post-FOMC highs around 98.008. USDCNH initially traded beneath the 7.00. Havens were sold yet again as headlines suggested the US is to consider dropping some tariffs on China, with the reports stating there is a growing consensus that they have to make a concession on the existing levies, although it is unclear whether US President Trump himself would sign this off. The JPY weakness pushed USDJPY above its 200dma at 109.02 to highs of 109.22 towards the tail-end of the US session. Haven outflows pushed yields higher throughout the session, therefore rate differentials were also likely a contributing factor to JPY weakness. XAU dropped through the USD 1500 handle as selling picked up sending spot gold to lows of 1480, also worth noting that the spread between the 2s10s curve widened to 23bps, the steepest its been since July. CHF also weaker against the greenback, sterling and single currency. AUD traded firmer today following the latest RBA policy meeting which reiterated its view it is in a gentle turning point in the economy, it also noted the impact of its previous cuts which some had taken as a hawkish sign which was evident in price action as AUD outperformed its Antipodean counterpart as NZD participants awaits tonight’s jobs data. In EMFX, BRL outperformed after its state owned Electrobras received the greenlight on its privatisation plan and reports its reform package proposed decentralising BRL 400bln to state and local governments over the next 15 years. ZAR continued on its relief rally accompanied by comments from its state-owned Eskom, that they are cautiously confident that their debt obligations are not a risk, reiterating chances of load shedding remain low. MXN and TRY traded weaker against the buck today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The bid was also said to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, after Iran said it would further reduce commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal; Citi's analysts think this could provide the conditions for a flare-up in the geopolitical risk premium within oil prices. OPEC's World Oil outlook report saw the cartel revise its view of OPEC supply, and now sees OPEC's supply of crude oil and other liquids declining to 32.8mln BPD by 2024 (vs. 35mln BPD in 2019), as rising climate activism and wider of alternative fuels is putting the strength of long-term oil demand under more pressure, and US output surpasses 16.9mln BPD in 2024. The report sees global oil demand falling to 103.9mln BPD by 2023, a lower revision compared to the 104.5mln BPD it had previously forecast; more immediately, Secretary General Barkindo said countries are ramping up compliance with supply cut pact, and numbers he has seen suggests 2020 may have some upside potential. After market, the API will publish energy inventories; this week, the Street looks for: Crude +1.5mln, Cushing stocks +1.77mln, distillate -0.900mln, and gasoline -1.8mln.</p>",

        "content": "<p>THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY: The US Treasury will auction USD 84bln in a new 3-year (USD 38bln, Tuesday), a new 10-year (USD 27bln, Wednesday) and a new 30-year (USD 19bln, Thursday). According to UBS, at next week's mid-month settlement, around USD 89bln of cash flows come due (excluding SOMA holdings, but including around USD 61bln of redemptions and around USD 28bln of coupons will fall due).&nbsp;</p><p>* 3-YEAR PREVIEW: SocGen's analysts say the 3-year auction has set up, from a RV perspective, and is trading cheap in both asset swap and on the curve versus 2s and 5s notes. Additionally, on an outright basis, SG believes the sector looks cheap given that the current 3s WI is trading above the stop-out rate of the last three auctions. SocGen says that with the Treasury yields near the higher-end of the recent range, and a lack of clear catalysts for a sustained rise in yields from here, it expects buyers of Treasuries to materialise. But SocGen does state, however, that with relatively high dealer holdings in the front part of the curve, demand for the paper will depend on foreigners and investment funds. Overall, the bank says it is positive on the auction.&nbsp;</p><p>* 3-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Tail: (Prev. 0.4bps, 6-auction avg. 0.1bps)</li><li>High Yield: (Prev. 1.41%, 6-auction avg. 1.752%)&nbsp;</li><li>Bid-to-Cover: (Prev. 2.43x, 6-auction avg. 2.46x)&nbsp;</li><li>Dealers: (Prev. 35.4%, 6-auction avg. 35.7%)&nbsp;</li><li>Directs: (Prev. 16.9%, 6-auction avg. 17.4%)&nbsp;</li><li>Indirects: (Prev. 45.9%, 6-auction avg. 46.9%)</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar was already paring losses and/or extending advances against its major rivals before the US non-manufacturing ISM surpassed expectations by a decent clip and most sub-components improved from the previous month. The upbeat survey prompted more bear-steepening along the Treasury curve even though 3 year note supply looms ahead of 10s and long bonds tomorrow and on Thursday respectively, while the <strong>DXY </strong>got to within a whisker of 98.000 and post-FOMC peaks just a fraction above vs lows not far under 97.500 at one stage.</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY/CHF/NZD</strong></p><p>The Euro has slumped towards the bottom of the G10 table alongside the underperforming Yen and Franc on more US-China Phase 1 positivity even though the Global Times editor appeared to play down some of the rising anticipation and reports about tariffs being rolled back or even removed. Eur/Usd declines accelerated once 1.1100 bids were filled and the 21 DMA gave way (1.1092) to expose a recent low around 1.1073, but the rot stopped for the single currency just a few pips before a Fib retracement level (1.1064). Similarly, Usd/Jpy breached 109.00 after overcoming psychological offers and then the 200 DMA (109.03), but topped out circa 109.15, while Usd/Chf reached 0.9930 before fading. However, the biggest fall from grace saw the Kiwi reverse course within approximate 0.6431-0.6372 extremes vs the Greenback, with no traction whatsoever from a firm rise in GDT and WMP auction prices, as NZ employment and labour cost data awaits.</p><p><strong>AUD/CAD/GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie has also retreated abruptly from best levels against the Buck, albeit holding up better than the rest and within sight of the 0.6900 handle over the NY cut when 1.5 bn option expiries ran-off from the round number to 0.6905. Aud resilience came via the RBA that maintained guidance alongside the view of a gentle turning point in the economic cycle, and also evident vs the Nzd as the cross eclipsed 1.0800 again. Elsewhere, the Loonie lost impetus ahead of 1.3100 following a slightly bigger than forecast Canadian trade deficit vs a bang in line US gap, with Usd/Cad currently over 1.3150 and through 1.3160, while Cable lost grip of 1.2900 before options expiry and 1.5 bn at the strike amidst the ongoing UK election/Brexit uncertainty and after a brief PMI services lift dissipated.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Yuan could not sustain momentum vs the Dollar through 7.0000 in the end, as the post-US ISM Buck buying spread and intensified (with Gold returning to sub-Usd1500 territory), pushing the Lira down under 5.7600 and even the outperforming Rand back from 14.6790 or so peaks towards 14.8240 troughs.</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) were positive but with gains in Australia limited by weakness in gold miners and a lack of fireworks from the RBA rate decision where the central bank kept rates unchanged as expected and largely reiterated its past statement, while the Japanese benchmark outperformed as it played catch up on return from the extended weekend and was boosted by a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) were initially choppy despite the improved trade optimism as some were said to be doubtful on whether US President will sign off on the additional concessions and as participants digested mixed Caixin Services and Composite PMI data. Nonetheless, the risk sentiment eventually gained traction after encouraging comments from Chinese President Xi on opening up China’s markets which would likely further appease the US, and the PBoC also announced a larger Medium-term Lending Facility operation at a reduced rate of 3.25% from 3.30%. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower following the bear steepening seen in USTs and with prices pressured by the outperformance of Tokyo stocks, while the BoJ’s Rinban announcement also failed to provide support as the central bank reduced its purchase amounts in 10yr-25yr maturities.&nbsp;</p><p>PBoC skipped reverse repo operation but conducted CNY 400bln 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility vs. Prev.

Sectors are mixed; with energy (+1.1%) in the lead, and materials (+0.5%) and financials (+0.2%) also as curve steepening supports the latter.

Aud/Usd has reclaimed 0.6900+ status in response and is pulling away from hefty option expiry interest at the big figure (1.5 bn), while Aud/Nzd is firmly back above 1.0750 even though the Kiwi is shadowing its Antipodean counterpart and the Yuan after a 5 bp MLF rate reduction from the PBoC. Nzd/Usd has rebounded through 0.6400 ahead of NZ jobs and labour cost data that follow the GDT auction, while Usd/Cnh trades sub-7.0000 vs a 7.0385 Usd/Cny mid-point fix overnight. Elsewhere, Usd/Cad is eyeing 1.3100 before the Loonie focuses of Canadian trade for some independent impetus.</p><p>CHF/JPY - In stark contrast to the above, more safe-haven unwinding has undermined the Franc and Yen, as Usd/Chf inches over 0.9900 and Usd/Jpy creeps further towards 109.00 and 200 DMA resistance just above (109.03).</p><p>GBP/EUR - Narrowly mixed vs the Greenback as the DXY straddles 97.500, with Cable keeping tabs on the 1.2900 handle where 1.5 bn expiries reside and Sterling deriving some support from another better than forecast UK PMI as the election preamble continues. However, the Pound is still biding time on Brexit uncertainty and meandering against the Euro between 0.8645-25 parameters, as Eur/Usd hovers above 1.1100 in a similarly tight band (1.1113-40) amidst little in the way of specific drivers for the single currency.</p><p>SEK/NOK - The aforementioned bullish/upbeat mood has also underpinned the Scandi Crowns and enabled the Swedish Krona to overlook disappointing data (ip and new manufacturing orders) plus pretty dovish or less hawkish Riksbank minutes on balance given a couple of reservations about telegraphing a repo hike in December. Indeed, Eur/Sek remains below 10.7000 and Eur/Nok is following suit amidst the backdrop of firm oil prices that helped the cross test 10.1350 ahead of decent technical support spanning 10.1300-10.1250.</p><p>EM - More post-CPI weakness for the Lira, as Turkish President Erdogan reiterates that the US is not complying with its side of the deal struck on Syria and piles pressure on the CBRT to slash rates again, with Usd/Try flirting with the 5.7500 level at one stage. Conversely, the Rand continues to bask in SA ratings relief rather than balk at ongoing Eskom power problems, as Usd/Zar probes 14.7000 to the downside.</p><p>RBA kept the Cash Rate unchanged at 0.75% as expected. RBA repeated its statement that rates are to remain low for an extended period and that it will ease policy if needed to support sustainable growth, while it also reiterated that a gentle turning point appears to have been reached. RBA added that its central scenario is for underlying inflation to be close to 2.00% in 2020 and 2021, while it sees economic growth at around 2.25% this year and to pick up gradually to around 3.00% in 2021.</p><p>OPEC Secretary General Barkindo says countries are ramping up compliance with global oil pact, numbers we are seeing suggests 2020 may have upside potential.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>A decent if not downright strong DMO Gilt sale by all traditional measures bar the more expensive funding cost, has given the 10 year UK benchmark another fillip, but not quite enough to erase all of its arrears at 131.71 vs Monday’s 131.83 close. Nevertheless, EU bonds are well off worst levels and displaying more resilience than their US counterparts in similar vein to this time yesterday and ahead of a busier pm agenda including the non-manufacturing PMI and ISM, Fed speak and the 1st of this week’s Treasury auctions.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Crude markets are on the front foot this morning as yesterday’s pre-settlement losses are steadily unwound amid the broader market risk appetite. WTI Dec’ 19 and Brent Jan’ 20 futures are well off of USD 56.30/bbl and USD 61.88/bbl lows, with the latter briefly eclipsing yesterday’s USD 62.79/bbl high (which is also the 200 DMA). In terms of oil price forecasts; UBS expects oil prices to weaken in H1 2020, with Brent prices testing USD 55/bbl by mid-2020 on account of strong supply growth in non-OPEC states. They do, however, expect a price recovery in H2 2020 with prices reaching USD 60/bbl by end-2020. In terms of newsflow; comments from Iranian President Rouhani suggesting a further reduction in nuclear commitments failed to spoke the market - yesterday the head of Iran's Energy Authority said that the operation of 30 new centrifuges is underway. Elsewhere, OPEC released its world oil outlook; OPEC increased its mid-term outlook for non-OPEC supply growth and forecasted that oil demand in OECD countries is expected to move away from growth to a declining trend after 2020. Looking ahead, barring unexpected US/China trade updates, US ISM Non-manufacturing is likely the main demand side driver of sentiment, while traders will also be eyeing this evening’s API Inventory Data. In terms of the metals; gold is slightly lower on improved risk appetite with prices still holding above 1500/oz for now. Copper prices have advanced amid the constructive trade reports via the FT with the red metal eyeing 2.7/lb to the upside.</p><p>Global oil demand to rise to 103.9mln BPD by 2023, which is lower than the prev. of 104.5mln BPD.

        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>The non-US Dollars are all benefiting from the general upturn in risk sentiment fuelled mainly by further signs that the US-China are moving closer towards Phase 1 of their trade pact, and with the Aussie also taking on board the latest RBA assertion that the domestic economy may be over the worst on the basis that there may be less pressure or reason for further easing in the near term. Aud/Usd has reclaimed 0.6900+ status in response and is pulling away from hefty option expiry interest at the big figure (1.5 bn), while Aud/Nzd is firmly back above 1.0750 even though the Kiwi is shadowing its Antipodean counterpart and the Yuan after a 5 bp MLF rate reduction from the PBoC. Nzd/Usd has rebounded through 0.6400 ahead of NZ jobs and labour cost data that follow the GDT auction, while Usd/Cnh trades sub-7.0000 vs a 7.0385 Usd/Cny mid-point fix overnight. Elsewhere, Usd/Cad is eyeing 1.3100 before the Loonie focuses of Canadian trade for some independent impetus.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>In stark contrast to the above, more safe-haven unwinding has undermined the Franc and Yen, as Usd/Chf inches over 0.9900 and Usd/Jpy creeps further towards 109.00 and 200 DMA resistance just above (109.03).</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>Narrowly mixed vs the Greenback as the <strong>DXY </strong>straddles 97.500, with Cable keeping tabs on the 1.2900 handle where 1.5 bn expiries reside and Sterling deriving some support from another better than forecast UK PMI as the election preamble continues. However, the Pound is still biding time on Brexit uncertainty and meandering against the Euro between 0.8645-25 parameters, as Eur/Usd hovers above 1.1100 in a similarly tight band (1.1113-40) amidst little in the way of specific drivers for the single currency.</p><p><strong>SEK/NOK&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The aforementioned bullish/upbeat mood has also underpinned the Scandi Crowns and enabled the Swedish Krona to overlook disappointing data (ip and new manufacturing orders) plus pretty dovish or less hawkish Riksbank minutes on balance given a couple of reservations about telegraphing a repo hike in December. Indeed, Eur/Sek remains below 10.7000 and Eur/Nok is following suit amidst the backdrop of firm oil prices that helped the cross test 10.1350 ahead of decent technical support spanning 10.1300-10.1250.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>More post-CPI weakness for the Lira, as Turkish President Erdogan reiterates that the US is not complying with its side of the deal struck on Syria and piles pressure on the CBRT to slash rates again, with Usd/Try flirting with the 5.7500 level at one stage. Conversely, the Rand continues to bask in SA ratings relief rather than balk at ongoing Eskom power problems, as Usd/Zar probes 14.7000 to the downside.</p>",

At the September meeting minutes a number of members, particularly Jansson, expressed concern regarding the rate path and focus will at this meeting be on any opposition to the October rate decision. - As such, the opposition expressed by some members in the minutes and their hesitancy regarding the rate path is a continuation of the view that was held by some members in September</li><li>Nordea states \"While the Riksbank is difficult to read, we keep out view of a rate hike by 25 bp in December, although it less of a done deal than previously assessed. Too low inflation, lower inflation expectations, weak growth and a deteriorating labour market will put pressure on the Riksbank to take action during the next year. However, as the Riksbank seems reluctant to have rates in negative territory for long, we forecast the Riksbank keep the repo rate at 0.0% in 2020 and 2021.\"</li></ul>",

Treasuries headed lower throughout the day, catching steam from some block sales - 20k in the TYZ9 and 8k in the USZ9 – and by settlement yields were about 6bps higher at the long end, with the 2-year higher by just half of that.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were higher as the region sustained the momentum from Wall St where all major US indices posted record highs on the continued US-China trade optimism, which was further exacerbated by reports the US is mulling rolling back the 15% tariffs on USD 112bln of Chinese imports that took effect from September 1st. ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) were positive but with gains in Australia limited by weakness in gold miners and a lack of fireworks from the RBA rate decision where the central bank kept rates unchanged as expected and largely reiterated its past statement, while the Japanese benchmark outperformed as it played catch up on return from the extended weekend and was boosted by a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) were initially choppy despite the improved trade optimism as some were said to be doubtful on whether US President will sign off on the additional concessions and as participants digested mixed Caixin Services and Composite PMI data. Nonetheless, the risk sentiment eventually gained traction after encouraging comments from Chinese President Xi on opening up China’s markets which would likely further appease the US, and the PBoC also announced a larger Medium-term Lending Facility operation at a reduced rate of 3.25% from 3.30%. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower following the bear steepening seen in USTs and with prices pressured by the outperformance of Tokyo stocks, while the BoJ’s Rinban announcement also failed to provide support as the central bank reduced its purchase amounts in 10yr-25yr maturities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as the region battles to sustain the momentum from Wall St where all major US indices posted record highs on the continued US-China trade optimism which was further exacerbated by reports the US is mulling rolling back the 15% tariffs on USD 112bln of Chinese imports which took effect on September 1st. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.8%) are higher but with gains in Australia limited by weakness in gold miners and a lack of conviction amid a looming RBA rate decision and the Melbourne Cup, while the Japanese benchmark outperforms as it plays catch up on return from the extended weekend and is boosted by a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) were choppy despite the improved trade optimism as some were said to be doubtful on whether US President will sign off on the additional concessions and with participants digesting mixed Caixin Services and Composite PMI data. Nonetheless, there were encouraging comments from Chinese President Xi on opening up markets which would likely further appease the US and the PBoC also announced a larger Medium-term Lending Facility operation at a reduced rate of 3.25% from 3.30%.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY remains firm after the prior day’s outperformance and extends above the 97.50 level with the recent rebound attributed to improving US-China sentiment, rising US yields and broad weakness across its counterparts including EUR/USD and GBP/USD in which the latter gave up the 1.2900 handle. In terms of the latest UK political developments, Brexit Party Leader Farage has given up on attempting to form a leave alliance with PM Johnson’s Tories in which the Brexit Party now plans to contest over 600 seats, and some pro-EU parties including the Lib-Dems are hoping to unveil a Remain election pact this week, while the latest polls show the Labour Party narrowing the gap against the Tories although remain 7 points behind at best. Elsewhere, outflows from safe havens JPY and CHF further added to the greenback’s momentum, while antipodeans are also subdued by the broad USD strength with focus now shifting to the upcoming RBA announcement.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower following the bear steepening seen in USTs and with prices pressured by the outperformance of Tokyo stocks, while the BoJ’s Rinban announcement also failed to provide support as the central bank reduced its purchase amounts in 10yr-25yr maturities.&nbsp;</p>",
