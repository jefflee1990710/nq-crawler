        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities mixed, dollar flat, treasuries flat/up, crude down.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> US trade deficit narrows; EU lays out US import tariff list; Canadian CPI in line; surprise draw in crude inventories</p><p><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>Australian Services &amp; Composite PMI; Australian Employment; French, German, EZ, &amp; US PMI (Flash); UK &amp; US Retail Sales; US Initial Jobless Claims &amp; Business Inventories; US Philly Fed Business Index; Fed’s Bostic Speaking; Supply from France; Earnings from: Phillip Morris, Union Pacific, Honeywell, PPG, American Express, Saipem.</p><p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump says China trade deal moving along nicely, says 'you'll be hearing about China trade deal shortly', has a feeling the trade deal will be successful.<strong> </strong>Following the Trump administration’s threats to tax certain EU goods over allegations that the group unfairly subsidises Airbus (AIR FP), putting Boeing (BA) at a competitive disadvantage, the EU have released a list of US goods it would place retaliatory tariffs on. The list is wide spreading across several product groups amounting to USD 20bln, including handbags, tractors, shovels, aeroplanes, helicopters, video game consoles and machines, tobacco, chemicals, and fish. German Transatlantic Coordinator Beyer said the tariffs against the US imports send the right signal, but hopes that the dispute does not affect prospects for a trade agreement between the two countries. On the US-China front, reports suggested that the two states have set a tentative timeline for the next round of trade talks, where a deal could be signed perhaps as early as late May; USTR Lighthizer may travel to Beijing on the week of April 29th.</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed's Bullard (voter, neutral) </strong>said falling core inflation is a concern if it leads to falling expectations about future inflation; on the outlook, she expects the economy to do better in Q2 compared to first part of the year. On the balance sheet, duration of holdings should mirror that of outstanding treasuries as a whole. <strong>Fed's Harker (non-voter, dove) </strong>reiterated the view for at most one rate hike for 2019, and one in 2020. Harker also said that the Fed’s balance sheet may be affecting longer term yields. Elsewhere, candidate Herman Cain said he would not withdraw his nomination for an Fed Board seat, despite many lawmakers objections.</p><p><strong>* FED BEIGE BOOK:</strong> US economy expanded at a slight-to-moderate pace in March and early April; most Fed districts said growth continued at a similar pace as in the previous report, but a few reported some strengthening. Employment continued to increase nationwide, with nine districts reporting modest or moderate growth and the other three reporting slight growth. Majority of Fed districts cited shortages of skilled labourers, most frequent in manufacturing and construction. A tight labour market led to continued wage pressures, most districts reported moderate wage growth. Prices on balance have risen modestly since the last report. Reports on consumer spending were mixed but suggested sluggish sales for both auto dealers and general retailers. Reports on manufacturing activity were favourable, however may Fed district contacts cited trade-related uncertainty. Input costs increased in a modes-to-moderate range, with tariffs, freight costs and rising wages often cited as key factors driving that trend. Some districts cited rising fuel prices, whilst others cited rising oil prices and falling natural gas prices.</p><p><strong>* US TRADE DATA: </strong>The trade deficit narrowed in February against expectations that it would widen, with export growth outpacing import growth. A look underneath the bonnet suggestions that the narrowing was driven by the export performance, specifically, the civilian aircraft category (other exports were flat). \"Importantly, real goods exports retain solid momentum, +3.5% Y/Y, despite global headwinds and lingering trade tensions,\" Oxford Economics says. \"Real goods imports have slowed to 0.3% Y/Y due to a weaker pull for imports at the start of the year, and looking ahead, exports should maintain a moderate pace while imports recover modestly as spending rebounds and excess inventories are worked off.\" The economic consultancy sees the trade deficit widening this year.</p><p><strong>* CANADA CPI: </strong>Headline CPI (both M/M and Y/Y) were in line with expectations at 0.7% and 1.9% respectively; the core M/M fell to 0.3% from a previous 0.7%; the average of the BOC measures (common, median, trimmed) rose to 1.97% from 1.83%. \"Recent declines in capacity constraints and inflation expectations suggest that March’s pick-up in core inflation is likely to be reversed before long,\" Capital Economics said. On the BOC measures ticking up, CapEco doubts that it marks the start of a trend: \"Rather, with the first-quarter Business Outlook Survey showing that capacity constraints, labour shortages and inflation expectations have all dropped back, we expect core inflation to edge back towards 1.8% in the coming months.\"</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLES USD 0.29 LOWER AT USD 63.76/BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLES USD 0.10 LOWER AT USD 71.62/BBL. </strong>The crude complex came into Wednesday on an upward trajectory, fuelled by inventory data and stronger-than-expected Chinese GDP, before prices cooled-off going into the US equity open. The DOE more or less confirmed Tuesday evening’s API data, printing a surprise draw for US headline crude stocks of 1.4mln bbls; gasoline stocks drew less than expected at 1.2mln bbls, slightly cooler than the draws of recent weeks; distillates also drew slightly less than expected at 0.4mln bbls; the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub drew 1.5mln bbls, more or less in line with the APIs and less than the expected 2mln bbls draw. Russia’s energy minister Novak provided some headwinds, however, reiterating the recent comments out of Russia which express caution on OPEC+ cuts being extended into the second half of the year. Novak said that it is too early to speak about preferable options for the global oil output deal, adding that he will need to see how the market situation develops. The oil behemoth’s energy minister went on to say that discussions on the cut agreement are expected late next month, where any deal established should focus on balancing the market rather than achieving a certain price level. Novak reassured bulls for the short-term outlook by saying that April’s output cut will be within the current OPEC+ agreement; where Russia agreed to cut 228k BPD from its October production rate of 11.4mln BPD. Elsewhere, analysts at Citi note that the market is likely to be prone to book squaring ahead of May WTI’s contract expiration on Monday, as well as the Good Friday/Easter holiday long weekend.</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.2% at 2900, NDX +0.3% at 7681, DJI +0,0% at 26450. SECTORS: Communications -1.0%, Cons Discretionary +0.2%, Cons Staples +0.4%, Energy -0.1%, Financials +0.2%, Healthcare -2.9%, Industrials +0.1%, Materials -0.6%, Tech +0.6%, Telecoms +0.2%, Utilities -0.2%.</strong></p><p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> Qualcomm (QCOM) shares maintained last night’s pre-market gains after Qualcomm and Apple (AAPL) announced that the two companies had come to an agreement regarding the payment of royalties to the chipmaker. Intel Corp (INTC) made gains after the CEO announced the company’s plans to withdraw from the 5G smartphone modem market. IBM (IBM) traded lower after missing revenue expectations, most notably in the technology co.’s highly touted cognitive-solutions and cloud-platform. Amazon (AMZN) announced it would close its domestic market place business in China, giving a boost to rivals Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD). Pepsi (PEP) shares moved higher after the soft drink maker posted better than expected top and bottom line results. Textron (TXT) shares moved higher after the aerospace and defence co. reported strong earnings and was the first in its sector to do so. Bank of New York Melon (BK) shares fell the most in over three years after the bank reported earnings that missed on top and bottom line expectations. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) fell for a second day leaving the stock on track for its worst month since February 2009 as investors worry about Democratic proposals for ‘Medicare for All’. Health Care names, including Merck &amp; Co. (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion (ALXN), Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM) drifted lower throughout the session, weighing on major indices; JNJ managed to close positive, however, maintaining the momentum from a good earnings report this week. ASML Holding (ASML) was roughly flat, initially buoyed as bottom line earnings beat analyst expectations. Gaming names, including EA (EA) and Activision (ATVI), had a second negative day with sentiment yet to recover after news emerged of an EA hack yesterday. I M&amp;A, sources with knowledge of T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) deal describe Tuesday nights WSJ story as irresponsible and add no decision has yet been made, deal chances still 50-50, according to Fox's Gasparino.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLE 1 TICK HIGHER AT 122-27+.</strong> Yields slightly lower at settlement, paring the bear-steepening seen in early trade after an encouraging slate of China data, which stoked risk sentiment. There was some pause after it was officially confirmed that Germany cut its growth projection (the second time in months). However, the narrower trade balance saw sellers return. After the European close, action was slower as traders began eyeing the long weekend, and there were reports of profit-taking. Stocks couldn’t sustain the pre-market risk-on, and accordingly, Treasuries found demand in US trade. At settlement, major curve spreads were a touch steeper.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;The USD is marginally lower heading into APAC trade, with weakness attributed to the better-than-expected China trade data overnight which stoked risk appetite. The EUR was initially buoyed by the news too, rising to highs around 1.1324, however, EUR heads into Asia at 1.13 – a level which has been magnetic for price action this week. Thursday’s flash April PMI data may be the catalyst to squeeze shorts out of their positions if the European data continues the general run of upside surprises seen since the beginning of March. The JPY is another currency magnetic to a level – 112.00 in the yen’s case; there was some positive ticks on suggestions that the US/China were (once again) nearing a trade deal. The Aussie couldn’t rally on the positive trade news, however, (trades slightly negative) with traders eyeing the jobs report overnight for the next directional cue. The Aussie’s antipodean counterpart maintained overnight downside after a soft CPI report raises the possibility of the RBNZ following other central banks and pivoting dovish.</p>",

The DOE more or less confirmed Tuesday evening’s API data, printing a surprise draw for US headline crude stocks of 1.4mln bbls; gasoline stocks drew less than expected at 1.2mln bbls, slightly cooler than the draws of recent weeks; distillates also drew slightly less than expected at 0.4mln bbls; the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub drew 1.5mln bbls, more or less in line with the APIs and less than the expected 2mln bbls draw. Russia’s energy minister Novak provided some headwinds, however, reiterating the recent comments out of Russia which express caution on OPEC+ cuts being extended into the second half of the year. Novak said that it is too early to speak about preferable options for the global oil output deal, adding that he will need to see how the market situation develops. The oil behemoth’s energy minister went on to say that discussions on the cut agreement are expected late next month, where any deal established should focus on balancing the market rather than achieving a certain price level. Novak reassured bulls for the short-term outlook by saying that April’s output cut will be within the current OPEC+ agreement; where Russia agreed to cut 228k BPD from its October production rate of 11.4mln BPD. Elsewhere, analysts at Citi note that the market is likely to be prone to book squaring ahead of May WTI’s contract expiration on Monday, as well as the Good Friday/Easter holiday long weekend.</p>",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Dollar steps off the throne as Chinese data crowns Yuan king ",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD, CNH</strong></p><p>A relatively downbeat day for the USD thus far as Yuan strength emanating from upbeat Chinese economic data helped send the DXY back below 97.000 whilst USD/CNH was sustained under 6.6900. US trade data did little to sway the Buck although Fed’s Bullard’s (voter and notorious dove) potential outlook on the economy may provide the Greenback with some direction later in the session. As it stands, DXY is poised to end the EU session marginally in the red closer to the middle of today’s 96.810-97.121 intraday band, ahead of its 50 DMA at 96.800. Meanwhile, CNH is holding onto most of its gains and is set to end EU trade at the bottom on a 6.6822-7124 range.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong></p><p>The Aussie and Loonie are the marked G10 outperformers whilst the Kiwi stands at the opposite end of the scale. AUD initially derived impetus from the aforementioned Chinese data wherein the jump in Chinese industrial production pushed AUD/USD higher to test 0.7200 to the upside. AUD/USD is poised to finish EU trade below its 200 DMA at the psychological 0.7200 level ahead of Aussie jobs with headline unemployment rate expected to tick up slightly to 5.0% from 4.9%. The Kiwi continues to be subdued, albeit to a lesser extent as NZD/USD nursed some most of the post-inflation decline as the pair moved higher in tandem with its Aussie counterpart. NZD/USD is still set to end EU trade in the red and south of its 200 DMA at 0.6732, having traded in a 0.6672-6775 intraday band.</p><p>Elsewhere, a pickup in Canadian inflation (1.9% vs. Prev. 1.5% Y/Y) coupled with a rise in the BoC’s core inflation measures bolstered the Canadian currency, with USD/CAD initially breaching its 100 and 50 DMAs (at 1.3327 and 1.3314 respectively) to hit an intraday low of 1.3275 (vs high of 1.3372). USD/CAD is poised to end the day having pared most of its gains given the decline in oil prices at the US cash open. ING notes that a BoC hike is not guaranteed, despite the slightly better news on the inflation front as the deteriorating economic outlook will prompt the BoC to stand pat on rates.</p><p><strong>EUR, GBP</strong></p><p>The single currency remains a beneficiary of the softer Buck. The single currency was little swayed by the release of unrevised EZ inflation finals and the German government’s cut to 2019 GDP growth forecasts as was widely expected. Furthermore, ECB hawk Nowotny reaffirmed the ECB sources from the prior day as he stated that it is not time for tiering, whilst the reduction in June forecasts are unlikely to significant. EUR was little move. Thus, EUR/USD is set to end EU trade not far from the 1.1300 level, having traded in a 1.1280-1323 intraday band, as traders eye tomorrow’s flash EZ PMIs. Meanwhile, Cable has recouped some of the inflation-induced losses and straddled closer to 1.3050 during late EU trade. The pair looks to end the EU session little changed, having fluctuated in a 1.3030-68 intraday range ahead of UK retail sales tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>Relatively directionless throughout the EU session as USD/JPY fluctuated on either side of 112.00 amid lack of macro catalysts and as liquidity dries out ahead of the Easter holidays. USD/JPY is set to end EU trade little changed within a tight 111.93-112.15 intraday range.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

(+0.3%)</strong> were indecisive with only brief support seen despite the better than expected Chinese GDP, Industrial Production and Retail Sales, as some suggested the data dampens prospects of PBoC action and after the central bank also recently suggested a preference for restraint in its quarterly monetary policy document.

Sectors are mixed, with underperformance seen in material names at the open, with the sector weighed on by BHP (-2.6%) after the Co. lowered their FY19 output guidance and Rio Tinto (-2.8%) in the red after being downgraded. Other notable movers this morning include ABB (+5.4%) following earnings and the surprise resignation of the Co’s CEO Spiesshofer, after being unable to placate shareholders with the sale of their power grid division in December. Elsewhere, Roche (+0.1%) have fallen from opening highs of around 1.6%; however, price action for the Co. was initially driven by the announcement that they are raising FY19 outlook to mid-single digit growth vs. Prev. low-mid single digit range, alongside expectations for further dividend increases.</p><p><strong>PepsiCo Inc (PEP)</strong> Q1 Core EPS USD 0.97 vs. exp.

GDP growth for the quarter topped estimates at 6.4% Y/Y, within the country’s 2019 target of 6.0-6.5%, whilst March IP and retail sales beats also provided extra impetus for the Yuan which breached 6.70 to the downside against the Dollar to print a low of just above 6.68. Hence, DXY lost the 97.000 handle upon the release and continues to edge lower in early EU trade. The Dollar index currently resides just off lows of 96.810 ahead of its 50 DMA at around 96.800. A light calendar for the US sees February trade data released at 13:30BST, ahead of Fed voter (and notorious dove) Bullard’s speech on the US economy and monetary policy.</p><p>AUD, NZD - The Aussie is the marked beneficiary from the upbeat Chinese data wherein the jump in industrial production and a maintained GDP growth aided AUD/USD to briefly reclaim 0.7200 to the upside (from an intraday low of 0.7150) for the first time since February. The pair currently resides just below the figure, albeit above its 200 DMA at 0.7193 with Aussie jobs data on the overnight docket. Note: around USD 1.5bln options are set to expire between strikes 0.7190-7200. Conversely, the Kiwi does not bode so well amid dismal CPI figures in which markets pricing for a May OCR cut shifted to above 50%. On a brighter note for the NZD/USD, the overnight Chinese data resurrected the currency from a low of 0.6670 (vs. pre-data high of 0.6775) before stabilising above its 200 DMA at around 0.6730.</p><p>EUR, GBP - An upbeat day for the Euro thus far amid the weakness in the Buck. The single currency was little swayed by the release of unrevised EZ inflation finals and the German government’s cut to 2019 GDP growth forecasts as was widely expected. EUR/USD breached its 50 DMA at 1.1300 to the upside in early hours and remains north of the figure where 1.4bln in options are set to expire at today’s NY cut. Elsewhere, Sterling took a hit from the benign inflation figures in which headline inflation printed at 1.9%, below the forecast 2.0%. As such, Cable lost the 1.3050 handle and resides close to session lows at 1.3033 ahead of its 50 WMA at 1.3029. ING argues that “British Retail Consortium had suggested that wholesale food costs had risen, on the back of adverse weather and higher global commodity prices”, hence overall inflation could be bumped up next month, possibly to the 2% target when combined with the rise in household energy caps. GBP now awaits for any potential direction from BoE Governor Carney scheduled to speak at 14:00BST.</p><p>CAD - Another G10 winner from the pullback in the Dollar, also underpinned from the rise in oil prices following last night’s surprise drawdown in API stocks. USD/CAD currently resides below its 100 DMA at 1.3327, having briefly breached its 50 DMA to the downside at 1.3314 ahead of Canadian inflation data this afternoon, with headline expected to tick up to 1.9% from 1.5%.</p><p>New Zealand CPI (Q1) Q/Q 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.3% (Prev. 0.1%). (Newswires) New Zealand CPI (Q1) Y/Y 1.5% vs. Exp. 1.7% (Prev. 1.9%) New Zealand RBNZ Sectoral Factor Model Inflation 1.7% (Prev. 1.7%)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Core EU and UK debt futures are still languishing in the red, but off of lows of the day as both UK and German 10yrs are consolidating above session troughs. UK debt futures were given a little bit of steam in the wake of softer than anticipated CPI data from the UK, but UK 10yrs remain the second worst performers in the core debt scope. This comes after 10yr Bunds briefly broke the 0.1% yield level in the morning on little to no fundamental news besides the strong Chinese production data overnight. EU and UK traders will now look to draw further direction from potential comments via BoE’s Carney and ECB’s Lautenschlager, after largely in-line EZ CPI added little impetus to the market.</p><p>Turning to the US, the curve is seeing most of the action in the longer end, with 10yr futures slipping by a shade over 3 ticks in the EU morning. 10yr yields are in focus as they have now broken their long term trend 61.8% fib (2.603%) with a 38.2% fib eyed next to the upside at 2.69%, as some market participants noted a strong bid in the 10yr following the strong production data from China. Looking ahead, traders may look for more inspiration from upcoming US trade and sales data, with Fed’s Bullard and Harker both also on the docket.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Brent (+0.6%) and WTI (+0.6%) prices are firmer</strong> with prices supported by the unexpected API draw of 3.1M vs. Exp. build of 1.7M. Elsewhere, strike action at Shells Pernis oil refinery [capacity of 404k BPD] is still ongoing, with most recent updates that union leaders state that the refinery is to remain at 65% operating rate, and there is currently no indication of when the refinery will return to full operation. Separately, Saudi Aramco are reportedly to purchase the 50% stake that Shell currently owns in SASREF, which is a joint venture between the two Co’s with a refining capacity in excess of 300k BPD. Later in the session we have the EIA weekly report, and due to scheduling for Easter holidays the Baker Hughes rig count will be released Thursday April 18th.</p><p><strong>Gold (U/C)</strong> is flat and trading within a narrow USD 4/oz range, with price action from the softer dollar and stronger than expected Chinese data largely cancelling each other out. As such the yellow metal, is trading just above the prior sessions low of around USD 1272, which was the metals lowest level since December 27th. Elsewhere, the world’s largest iron ore miner Vale say they intend to resume operations at their Brucutu operations within the next 72 hours weighing on both the mining index and iron ore prices.</p><p>Barclays believes copper will end the year below USD 6000/tonne as macro economy will ultimately weigh on the red metal.

The AEX (+0.3%) is marginally outperforming its peers, boosted by index heavyweight ASML (+2.5%) who have around a 12% weighting in the AEX and are higher following their earnings and the Co. confirming their full year guidance. Sectors are mixed, with underperformance seen in material names at the open, with the sector weighed on by BHP (-2.6%) after the Co. lowered their FY19 output guidance and Rio Tinto (-2.8%) in the red after being downgraded. Other notable movers this morning include ABB (+5.6%) following earnings and the surprise resignation of the Co’s CEO Spiesshofer, after being unable to placate shareholders with the sale of their power grid division in December. Elsewhere, Roche (U/C) have fallen from opening highs of around 1.6%; however, price action for the Co. was initially driven by the announcement that they are raising FY19 outlook to mid-single digit growth vs. Prev. low-mid single digit range, alongside expectations for further dividend increases.</p><p>FX</p><p>USD, CNY - China’s economy unexpectedly held up in Q1 despite a slew of calls for a March bottom. GDP growth for the quarter topped estimates at 6.4% Y/Y, within the country’s 2019 target of 6.0-6.5%, whilst March IP and retail sales beats also provided extra impetus for the Yuan which breached 6.70 to the downside against the Dollar to print a low of just above 6.68. Hence, DXY lost the 97.000 handle upon the release and continues to edge lower in early EU trade. The Dollar index currently resides just off lows of 96.810 ahead of its 50 DMA at around 96.800. A light calendar for the US sees February trade data released at 13:30BST, ahead of Fed voter (and notorious dove) Bullard’s speech on the US economy and monetary policy.</p><p>AUD, NZD - The Aussie is the marked beneficiary from the upbeat Chinese data wherein the jump in industrial production and a maintained GDP growth aided AUD/USD to briefly reclaim 0.7200 to the upside (from an intraday low of 0.7150) for the first time since February. The pair currently resides just below the figure, albeit above its 200 DMA at 0.7193 with Aussie jobs data on the overnight docket. Note: around USD 1.5bln options are set to expire between strikes 0.7190-7200. Conversely, the Kiwi does not bode so well amid dismal CPI figures in which markets pricing for a May OCR cut shifted to above 50%. On a brighter note for the NZD/USD, the overnight Chinese data resurrected the currency from a low of 0.6670 (vs. pre-data high of 0.6775) before stabilising above its 200 DMA at around 0.6730.</p><p>EUR, GBP - An upbeat day for the Euro thus far amid the weakness in the Buck. The single currency was little swayed by the release of unrevised EZ inflation finals and the German government’s cut to 2019 GDP growth forecasts as was widely expected. EUR/USD breached its 50 DMA at 1.1300 to the upside in early hours and remains north of the figure where 1.4bln in options are set to expire at today’s NY cut. Elsewhere, Sterling took a hit from the benign inflation figures in which headline inflation printed at 1.9%, below the forecast 2.0%. As such, Cable lost the 1.3050 handle and resides close to session lows at 1.3033 ahead of its 50 WMA at 1.3029. ING argues that “British Retail Consortium had suggested that wholesale food costs had risen, on the back of adverse weather and higher global commodity prices”, hence overall inflation could be bumped up next month, possibly to the 2% target when combined with the rise in household energy caps. GBP now awaits for any potential direction from BoE Governor Carney scheduled to speak at 14:00BST.</p><p>CAD - Another G10 winner from the pullback in the Dollar, also underpinned from the rise in oil prices following last night’s surprise drawdown in API stocks. USD/CAD currently resides below its 100 DMA at 1.3327, having briefly breached its 50 DMA to the downside at 1.3314 ahead of Canadian inflation data this afternoon, with headline expected to tick up to 1.9% from 1.5%.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Core EU and UK debt futures are still languishing in the red, but off of lows of the day as both UK and German 10yrs are consolidating above session troughs. UK debt futures were given a little bit of steam in the wake of softer than anticipated CPI data from the UK, but UK 10yrs remain the second worst performers in the core debt scope. This comes after 10yr Bunds briefly broke the 0.1% yield level in the morning on little to no fundamental news besides the strong Chinese production data overnight. EU and UK traders will now look to draw further direction from potential comments via BoE’s Carney and ECB’s Lautenschlager, after largely in-line EZ CPI added little impetus to the market.</p><p>Turning to the US, the curve is seeing most of the action in the longer end, with 10yr futures slipping by a shade over 3 ticks in the EU morning. 10yr yields are in focus as they have now broken their long term trend 61.8% fib (2.603%) with a 38.2% fib eyed next to the upside at 2.69%, as some market participants noted a strong bid in the 10yr following the strong production data from China. Looking ahead, traders may look for more inspiration from upcoming US trade and sales data, with Fed’s Bullard and Harker both also on the docket.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>Brent (+0.5%) and WTI (+0.6%) prices are firmer</strong> with prices supported by the unexpected API draw of 3.1M vs. Exp. build of 1.7M. Elsewhere, strike action at Shells Pernis oil refinery [capacity of 404k BPD] is still ongoing, with most recent updates that union leaders state that the refinery is to remain at 65% operating rate, and there is currently no indication of when the refinery will return to full operation. Separately, Saudi Aramco are reportedly to purchase the 50% stake that Shell currently owns in SASREF, which is a joint venture between the two Co’s with a refining capacity in excess of 300k BPD. Later in the session we have the EIA weekly report, and due to scheduling for Easter holidays the Baker Hughes rig count will be released Thursday April 18th.</p><p><strong>Gold (U/C)</strong> is flat and trading within a narrow USD 4/oz range, with price action from the softer dollar and stronger than expected Chinese data largely cancelling each other out. As such the yellow metal, is trading just above the prior sessions low of around USD 1272, which was the metals lowest level since December 27th. Elsewhere, the world’s largest iron ore miner Vale say they intend to resume operations at their Brucutu operations within the next 72 hours weighing on both the mining index and iron ore prices.</p>",

UK debt futures were given a little bit of steam in the wake of softer than anticipated CPI data from the UK, but UK 10yrs remain the second worst performers in the core debt scope. This comes after 10yr Bunds briefly broke the 0.1% yield level in the morning on little to no fundamental news besides the strong Chinese production data overnight. EU and UK traders will now look to draw further direction from potential comments via BoE’s Carney and ECB’s Lautenschlager, after largely in-line EZ CPI added little impetus to the market.</p><p>Turning to the US, the curve is seeing most of the action in the longer end, with 10yr futures slipping by a shade over 3 ticks in the EU morning. 10yr yields are in focus as they have now broken their long term trend 61.8% fib (2.603%) with a 38.2% fib eyed next to the upside at 2.69%, as some market participants noted a strong bid in the 10yr following the strong production data from China. Looking ahead, traders may look for more inspiration from upcoming US trade and sales data, with Fed’s Bullard and Harker both also on the docket.</p>",

        "content": "<p>EU and UK debt market futures have been shedding weight since the open with 10yr Bund futures dipping by over 40 ticks since the open and yields at 4-week highs (0.096%) after having broken a trend resistance level at 0.084% and briefly touching 0.1%, with little fundamental impetus to point to ahead of EZ CPI. On a technical standpoint, traders will be looking to the 164.07 fib to the downside, which hangs just below session lows for the German benchmark. 10yr Gilt futures have seen similar price action, albeit not as extravagant, with the UK 10yr trading with losses of over 30 ticks and at liffe lows of 126.57. Little updates on Brexit have been forthcoming, but despite this, the UK benchmark has managed to slip just below Monday’s lows of 126.61 ahead of potential comments from BoE’s Carney in the European afternoon.</p>",
