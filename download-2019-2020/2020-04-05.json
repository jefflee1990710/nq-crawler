The crude benchmarks had another session of double-digit percentage gains, seeing WTI move above 28/bbl and Brent above 34/bbl, as OPEC+ plus North America look set to hold a conference call on Monday with discussion over a 10mln BPD cut, although concerns linger on how committed the US will be to such proposals.

One desk noted that the bid was mostly a function of leveraged fund types, although real money did “nibble”. Furthermore, corporate issuance took a breather on Friday, with just a couple of IG issuers, likely supporting the bid out the curve. FedEx (FDX) was one of the issuers, raising capital further out the curve in order to pay off credit facilities it had drawn down on. This method has become more frequent recently, and is supporting the bounce back in issuance, as corporates raise capital in longer maturities to address their large credit facility drawdowns and commercial paper issuance. Meanwhile, the Fed continued its Treasury purchases (at the reduced clip of USD 60bln per day), also supporting the flattener, and in contrast to recent sessions, Treasuries maintained their bid after the Fed completed its purchases, whereas recent sessions have seen participants selling into the operations. By settlement, 2s -1bps at 0.21%, 10s -4bps at 0.59%, 30s -5bps at 1.22%. T-NOTE (M0) FUTURES SETTLED 8 TICKS HIGHER AT 139-04+.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "subject": "ANALYSIS: OPEC+ call delayed until Thursday",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>OPEC: </strong>An OPEC+ call that was scheduled for Monday has been delayed until Thursday, amid an intensifying dispute between Russia and Saudi Arabia over who is to blame for falling crude prices. Participants are to discuss the demand hit to crude from COVID-19. Analysts do not seem to be convinced that the group will make sufficient progress; the Saudis and Russia have called for other global producers – namely US, Canada and Mexico – to share the burden of cuts, while Norway has also said it would consider cutting production in any coordinated global effort.</li><li><strong>LEVEL OF CUTS: </strong>Ahead of the now notorious March OPEC meeting, there was a recommendation to cut an additional 1.5mln BPD from April 2020 through the end of 2020, with a review in June. The deal was conditional on support from OPEC+, and OPEC said any deal could only be applied on a pro-rata basis, and proposed core members cut by 1mln BPD, and non-OPEC by 500k. Ahead of Thursday's meeting, a figure of 10mln BPD cut to output has been floated (around 10% of global supply), although following a call with Saudi Arabia, US President Trump last week indicated that it could be as much as 15mln BPD. A source has suggested that the 10mln should be slashed from current levels of output. Either way, Goldman Sachs thinks that the demand hit might actually be more like 26mln BPD, and a cut of 10mln BPD may prove to be insufficient.</li><li><strong>TEXAS: </strong>The Trump administration has previously signalled it would not impose mandatory curbs on companies' production, given the antitrust legislation, although Stratfor's analysts note that Texas, where field production was running at a pace of 5.37mln BPD at the end of 2019, does have the legal framework to be able do so at a state level. One of the three Texas Railroad Commission members, Ryan Sitton, has indicated a willingness to agree production cuts to support oil prices and prevent producers in the state going bust. Texas regulators are to meet on 14th April to discuss production curbs in the state, and may vote on any resolution a week later, Reuters reported. Sitton, however, is a lame duck on the Commission, having lost in the March primary to a challenger, and his term concludes in December; the state's two other regulators, Wayne Christian and Christi Craddick, have not publicly endorsed cuts.&nbsp;Meanwhile, US President Trump on the weekend said he was considering slapping tariffs on oil imports, or even take other such measures, in order to protect the US energy sector from falling oil prices; Canada is reportedly also mulling such steps. This follows calls by leading lawmakers in recent weeks for such action. For reference, the US imports of petroleum were around 9.1mln BPD in 2019, of which Saudi and Russian imports were just over 500k each.</li><li><strong>WHAT TO WATCH: </strong>Talk of further production cuts was supportive for crude prices last week, and were participants not able to strike a deal, oil could again find itself under pressure. In terms the signposts to watch, Stratfor suggests monitoring Saudi willingness to go back to letting Russia cut a much smaller amount, or an openness to a Texas-only US commitment. \"In any case, a deal keeping Brent above USD 30/bbl does not seem the most likely outcome,\" it said. Additionally, others have noted that Saudi Arabia delayed publishing its official selling prices for May until 10th April (a day after the call), an unprecedented measure to allow stakeholders more time to reach a deal ahead of Thursday's call, a source said; the data was due to be published on Sunday, and it will this week be useful in corroborating how the meeting really went.</li></ul>",
