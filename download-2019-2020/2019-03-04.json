        "content": "<p><strong>* OVERVIEW:&nbsp;</strong>The National People's Congress will get underway on 5 March and will last for approximately 10 days (2019 government work report will be released on 5 March, 2019 Fiscal Budget Report on 6 March; attention will be on the MOF, PBOC and NDRC press conferences, which have no set time yet, but usually take place in the first week; finally, Premier Li will hold a press conference on 15 March). \"We should expect the Government Work Report, delivered by Premier Li Keqiang, and Fiscal Budget Report, which will contain more details about macroeconomic policies and reform objectives for 2019,\" HSBC said.</p><p><strong>* GDP Target:&nbsp;</strong>The market will primarily&nbsp;be focused&nbsp;on the 2019 economic targets: GDP growth objective is likely to be set at \"6.0% to 6.5%\" vs \"around 6.5%\" in 2018 (and an actual 6.6%) to reinforce the Central Economic Work Conference's main priority of providing job stability. SocGen expects the target to “almost certainly be lowered to 6-6.5%” as this is much needed amid challenging balance between short-term growth and long-term sustainability. ING forecast GDP target for this year at 6.3% and added that If the target is released as a range, it is possible investors will focus on the lower end of the range which could wobble markets. However, if the government announces a 5yr target GDP average of around 6%, markets may be concerned about a deeper China slowdown.</p><p><strong>* Fiscal Budget:&nbsp;</strong>The fiscal deficit is seen forecast at 3.0% of GDP vs 2.6% 2018 target; \"Beijing to step up fiscal easing at next week's NPC to stabilise growth,\" HSBC says, \"selective credit easing for private businesses to continue, watch out for more reforms of the financial sector and opening up measures - these will help to create a more level playing field for businesses, and sustain China's growth in the long run.\" Focus will be on whether the government is to support the economy via investments in infrastructure, which can gauge how serious the headwinds from US-China trade disputes are. Furthermore, tax cuts may be mentioned, however, ING does not believe tax relief is as effective as infrastructure spending to stimulate the economy during a downward cycle. However, SocGen believes “Infrastructure will receive more formal fiscal support, but it is not going to be a massive stimulus yet.” China’s fiscal deficit is normally around 0.5ppts higher than the planned deficit, although it is expected to be even larger this year due to supporting economic growth. Hence, ING expects a fiscal deficit at 4% of GDP, but SocGen forecasts the budget deficit to be below the expected 3.0%, whilst stating that tax cuts will be given a big push.</p><p><strong>* Monetary Easing:&nbsp;</strong>The Yuan's path will be of focus, with last year’s government commitment revolved around “keeping the Yuan exchange rate stable at a reasonable equilibrium level”. ING warns that the wording on this in the government's work report could form part of a final trade agreement with the US amid the currency pact between the two countries to keep the Yuan stable. The latest quarterly policy report changed the monetary policy stance to “prudent” from “neutral and prudent” The phrase “controlling the floodgate of money supply” was dropped, and more emphasis was given to “counter-cyclical adjustments”. It will not be surprised if the report remains consistent with the monetary policy report, although emphasis may shift liquidity to small private firms, suggesting the that Medium Lending Facility could be replaced by the Targeted Medium Lending Facility.</p><p><strong>* Economic Reforms:&nbsp;</strong>Expected to be centred around improving public services and technology. “Our view is that reform efforts will no longer include deleveraging or cuts to overcapacity this year” says ING, “Economic conditions don't allow for further deleveraging, which would put additional pressure on growth.”</p>",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: US/China trade optimism offset by Trump's political woes",
        "content": "<p><i><strong>NOTE: The regular US MARKET WRAP will return on Tuesday.</strong></i></p><p><strong>* STOCKS: </strong>Positive risk sentiment on US/China trade deal news spurred equity sentiment at the beginning of the week, though the optimism was faded, and even exacerbated after reports on the US political front where Republican Majority Leader McConnell said the Senate will vote to disapprove Trump's emergency declaration, and news that the US House Judiciary Committee issues document requests in a Trump probe focused on alleged obstruction, corruption and other abuses of power. the ES future fell from 2815, through the 200DMA at 2790, to LOD around 2775, before the index pared back into the close, lingering around that 200dma.</p><p><strong>* TREASURY: </strong>The US Treasury curve was flatter on Monday's trade, despite a heavy corporate supply docket for the week, where USD 40bln of corporate issuance is on tap, with USD 110-130bln expected through the course of March, analysts estimate. Real money was said to be putting through blocks on the long-end, taking cash yields down by around 3.5bps at settlement.</p><p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>Crude started the session on a front foot, before paring back some gains as risk sentiment soured throughout the session. On the demand side prospects of a US/China trade deal were underpinning; on the supply side, OPEC+ data continues to suggest that the alliance is deliver to tighten crude supply; OPEC crude exports in February came in at 24.086 MBPD (-669k BPD in the month), on the back of Gulf cutbacks. Later in the day, newswire sources reported that the cartel is unlikely to make any output policy decision at its April meeting, it is more likely do so in June where it will extend the supply curb agreement until the end of the year. Friday's rig count data also provided some support. Meanwhile, there is a an eye on events in Nigeria, where 50 people are missing in the Nembe region of the Niger Delta, after a pipeline explosion last week. While no force majeure has been declared, as yet, traders recall that the Niger Delta Avengers threatened to attack energy infrastructure in the region if Buhari won the Presidency again (he did). Elsewhere in geopolitics, Libya's NOC said it has lifted the force majeure at its - 300k BPD capacity - El Sharara oilfield, where it expects production to reach regular levels within days.</p><p><strong>* USD: </strong>Speculation that a US/China trade deal is close has not done much for the buck. ING offers two possible reasons: the market needs a tangible agreement rather than speculation to see a larger risk rally in the FX space, the bank says, and additionally, it argues that the eventual trade deal should give the Fed room to lift rates in Q3, which the bank notes is not priced by the market. ING also expects this week's NFP report to raise the pricing of hikes in 2019, and says that it \"suggests that even if the risk environment continues improving, USD should stay supported against low yielders such as EUR and JPY,\" and the bank sees risks ofmore upside for USDJPY given rising stock prices and higher UST yields. The USD largely shrugged off another wave Trump of criticising Fed policy (\"I want a strong dollar,\" Trump said, though he does not want \"a dollar that's so strong that it makes it prohibitive for us to do business with other nations,\" and said Fed chair Powell, who he didn't refer to by name, likes raising interest rates).</p><p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The ECB is expected to strike a note of caution on Thursday (consensus looks for growth foreasts to be cut, but inflation forecasts expected to be little changed), and this seems to have kept the EUR on the defensive in Monday's trading. The ECB's guidance about future rate hikes, as well as tasking relevant committees to evaluate how TLTROs could address foreseen liquidity bottlenecks, aren't likely to surprise hawkish, analysts posit, further diminishing the EUR's appeal.</p><p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Progress on the Brexit front has not really given Sterling another boost; initial upside was seen on the weekend reports that pro-Brexit lawmakers were edging towards backing UK PM May, though the upside; however, GBP gave back gains on news that the ERG might not be edging in such a direction - either that, or the group is too split to speak as one, seeing GBP give up the 1.32 handle. While traders are likely to take their primary cues from the Brexit drama, GBP still has to negotiate the data hurdles (services PMIs on Tuesday) as well as BOE Governor Carney testifying tomorrow.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The chances of a Meaningful Vote this week on UK PM May's Brexit deal were said to have risen after key backbench lawmaker (and chair of the influential 1922 Committee) Brady on the weekend wrote that, in cooperation with coalition partner DUP, the ERG may be able to support May's proposal should it satisfy their 'three conditions'. (NOTE: officials have pured cold water on the idea). RBC notes that the group appeatrs to have dropped its demands that the backstop itself be either removed or redrafted; the group has also said that it was up to UK AG Cox to renegotiate the backstop, as he saw fit. That said, the Telegraph on Monday reported that the AG has abandoned his approach of negotiating ether a 'hard' time limit, or an unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop (which many pro-Brexit MPs had previously demanded). Nevertheless, despite things progressing in the right direction, scepticism still remains whether May can garner enough support to overturn the 230 majority opposition that had previous voted against her. Additionally, it was reported that Eurosceptics are clear the threat of A50 extension will not be enough to persuade them to back the PM's deal, giving us a reminder of how split all sides of Parliament are. Tomorrow, Brexit Secretary Barclay and UK AG Cox will travel to Brussels to meet with EU Brexit negotiator Barnier.</p><p><strong>* AUD: </strong>The Aussie is just about clinging to gains ahead of the overnight RBA meeting, and heads into APAC trade just short of the 0.7100 area; RBA expected to keep the Official Cash Rate at 1.50%; analysts don’t see any immediate rate moves on the horizon, and expect the central bank will tilt dovish; Governor Lowe is scheduled to speak the day after the meeting (2210 GMT on 5 March 2019); Policy announcement due Tuesday 4th March at 0330GMT/2130CST/1130HKT, <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/21301/download\">full RANsquawk preview here.</a></p>",

On the demand side prospects of a US/China trade deal are underpinning. However, the supply side of the equation was also providing a bullish catalyst. On the OPEC+ front, data continues to suggest that the alliance is deliver to tighten crude supply; OPEC crude exports in February came in at 24.086 MBPD (-669k BPD in the month), on the back of Gulf cutbacks; combined Saudi and UAE shipments fell by 763k BPD vs January, while exports from Southern Iraq were up +207k BPD.

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Bucking the trend of largely rangebound trade elsewhere in the G10 arena, the Pound saw several swings on the usual conflicting mix of Brexit reports and headlines, with initial upside forged on news that the 1922 Committee may be willing to back UK PM May’s withdrawal deal with certain provisos propelling Cable up towards 1.3275, albeit with a dose of general Dollar weakness after the latest verbal intervention from US President Trump helping. Sterling subsequently lost momentum on paper talk that the ERG may not be that inclined to follow leader JRM and also vote in favour next time round, again with key conditions that the EU shows little or no sign of agreeing to. Cable relinquished the 1.3200 handle and filled in bids said to be layered from the big figure down to 1.3190, but perhaps importantly held above the next buying zone at 1.3170 and from a tech perspective the 200 HMA at 1.3165. Note, there was no obvious adverse reaction to a contractionary UK construction PMI, oddly.</p><p><strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The single currency also handed back best gains made amidst the aforementioned Greenback declines and risk-on trade after reports that the US and China are closing in on a trade deal, with a decent Eurozone Sentix index largely ignored, but more Italian intransigence over the 2019 budget probably niggling at sentiment. Indeed, Eur/Usd is now looking at support just ahead of 1.1300 (1.1316 on some charts) after slipping through resistance at 1.1360 (rising trend-line), last Friday’s 1.1355 low and then tripping stops on a break of 1.1350. The low so far is around 1.1320 and Eur/crosses followed a similar pattern.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Clinging to the remnants of their US-China trade deal-related gains and the former just about staying in touch of 0.7100 as attention turns to the RBA on Tuesday and a widely expected dovish tilt following yet more poor Aussie data overnight. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is hovering around 0.6800 as the Aud/Nzd cross pivots 1.0400, and for a more detailed preview of the RBA meeting check out our Research Suite and keep an eye on the headline feed.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>All ending Monday’s EU session a little softer vs the Usd, with the former and latter losing a degree of safe-haven premium and back near recent lows circa 112.00 and parity respectively, while the Loonie continues to underperform ahead of the BoC and in wake of much weaker than expected Canadian growth data at the end of last week, with Usd/Cad up over 1.3300 and seemingly detached from firm oil prices.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index looks more assured above Fib resistance at 96.594 even though US construction spending fell well short of consensus, and is edging towards another upside tech level at 96.784, with a high so far of 96.745.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Quite a lot of volatility in the Try and Mxn with both under pressure post-softer than expected Turkish inflation data on the risk that the CBRT loosens its grip on the monetary reins in response on Wednesday, while the latter weakened in wake of S&amp;P downgrading Mexico’s outlook to negative from stable, before the Lira and Peso pared some losses.</p>",

Meanwhile, Gilts are still struggling to keep pace, but have crept back above par and US Treasuries are just off fresh peaks, but the curve still flatter amidst talk of a block seller of 10 year futures vs ultras and 2-way flow elsewhere (real money buying and CTA short covering vs dealer and fund selling). Turning to currencies, the Dollar has dipped again with the index back near a Fib that provided some resistance on the way up to the 96.704 high, which was just shy of another bullish tech target at 96.784.</p>",

On Friday, US equities rose amid the overall risk appetite wherein the S&amp;P closed above the 2800 level for the first time since November last year. The Dow closed above 26000 as Nike and Chevron led the gains, whilst Nasdaq advanced due to outperformance in heavyweight Amazon. ASX 200 (+0.4%) was led by the outperformance in the IT sector alongside a strong performance in material names, whilst Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) was lifted by its heavy China-exposed machinery sector and a marginally weaker domestic currency. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) was the marked outperformer and breached the key 3000 level to the upside with all sectors firmly in the green ahead of the China National People&rsquo;s Congress coupled with reports of optimistic trade developments. Meanwhile, Hang Seng (+0.5%) posted modest gains but initially failed to piggy-back on the same momentum as its mainland peers as the heavy-weight financial and energy names weighed on the index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huawei are said to be preparing to sue the US government for banning federal agencies from using their products.

(The Independent/ The Guardian) The ERG group have drawn up &ldquo;three tests&rdquo; the government must meet to secure their support for PM May&rsquo;s deal. This includes demands for a &ldquo;clear and unconditional&rdquo; route out of the backstop, language that &ldquo;must go beyond simply re-emphasising/re-interpreting the temporary nature&rdquo; of the arrangement and a legally binding guarantee that the backstop is temporary. (The Times) Following this, Telegraph&#39;s Swinford reports that &quot;Eurosceptics are clear the threat of A50 extension will not be enough to persuade them to back the PM&#39;s deal&quot;. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier reportedly told EU ambassadors that he is having to repeatedly rebut UK demands for a temporary backstop, but he is working on a legal add-on to help PM May. Furthermore, he stated that there is not enough time for the EU to ratify the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, even if the deal passes through the UK House of Commons, hence PM May will have to delay Brexit. Barnier also suggested that Parliamentary arithmetic may be moving towards PM May&rsquo;s favour. (Die Welt/ The Guardian/The Independent)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Attorney General Cox has reportedly ditched attempts to secure a hard time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism from the Irish backstop.

Downing Street is said to be worried about upsetting Brussels by revealing its plans with negotiations over the Irish backstop at such a delicate stage.

Although, there is some slight underperformance in the DAX (U/C) which is weighed on by Fresenius Medical Care (-2.3%) after US President Trump&rsquo;s administration have stated they are looking at value based pricing to promote home dialysis and kidney transplants, designed to spur innovation and decrease in-clinic dialysis; with the market currently dominated by the Co. and US Company DaVita, who are down by around 2% in the pre-market. Sectors are similarly in positive territory; however, the healthcare sector is largely unchanged with sentiment capped by the aforementioned performance of Fresenius Medical Care, along with Novarits (-2.5%) who in spite of their positive update regarding psoriasis are in the red as they are trading ex-dividends today. Other notable movers include, British American Tobacco (+0.5%) who opened down by just under 2% following a class action lawsuit against the Co&rsquo;s Canadian unit. Elsewhere, Casino (-1.6%) are in the red after being downgraded at Societe Generale. Towards the top of the Stoxx 600 are Daily Mail (+4.9%) after the Co. stated they are offloading their GBP 900mln stake in Euromoney, with funds to be returned to shareholders. Separately, Julius Baer (+0.9%) are up after the Co. increased their stake in NSC Asesores by 30% to 70% for an undisclosed amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Dollar is somewhat mixed vs its major counterparts, but the DXY recovered from another US President Trump set-back to revisit 96.600 and marginally eclipse tech resistance (96.594 Fib) on the way. However, latest encouraging reports on US-China trade, suggesting a deal is in the offing have hampered the Greenback to an extent, especially vs more risk-sensitive and high beta currency peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The Pound has shrugged off an unexpected fall in UK construction PMI through the 50 growth/contraction threshold, and instead remains supported at the top of the G10 table on the more positive Brexit-related news in the form of growing support for PM May&rsquo;s Withdrawal Agreement among the more ardent Tory leaver ranks, albeit with set conditions. Indeed, Cable remains close to 1.3250 and Eur/Gbp has retreated from highs around 0.8600, though the latter partly due to relative weakness in the single currency. Note, however, a hefty 1 bn option expiry at the 0.8500 strike looks too distant to come into play today as the cross hovers near 0.8560.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - As noted above, an underperformer amidst broadly risk-on trade at the start of the new week, with stops noted vs the Usd on a break of 1.1350 once last Friday&rsquo;s low was breached taking the headline pair down to 1.1335. Similarly, sell orders are said to have been triggered in Eur/Jpy, possibly through 127.00 and in Eur/Gbp, but the single currency has pared some lost ground in wake of a more upbeat than forecast Sentix index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY - A bit of divergence between the traditional safe-havens, as the Franc remains below parity vs the Greenback on the aforementioned positive US-China paper talk, but the Jpy rebounds from worst levels circa 112.00, perhaps with the aid of those Eur cross sales, to sit just off 111.73 highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD - The Antipodean Dollars are off best levels achieved overnight when the WSJ trade deal between Beijing and Washington near to completion report broke, but still underpinned as the Kiwi keeps its head above 0.6800 and Aussie hovers just below 0.7100. However, Aud/Nzd has slipped back towards 1.0400 in wake of some disappointing pre-RBA data in the form of Gross Company Profits and the Loonie is still underperforming circa 1.3300 lows following last Friday&rsquo;s sub-consensus Canadian GDP release in the run up to the BoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Lira and Peso are under pressure vs the Buck on bearish specific/independent impulses, as softer than expected Turkish CPI could prompt the CBRT to tweak its tight monetary stance on Wednesday, or even shift guidance in preparation for an ease ahead, while the Mxn is clearly feeling the adverse effects of S&amp;P&rsquo;s move to credit watch negative from stable. Note, Usd/Try is currently around 5.3850 vs almost 5.4000 at one stage and Usd/Mxn circa 19.3500 vs 19.3820 earlier, while in stark contrast the Thai Central Bank has been forced to curb excess Thb strength with a 31.75-85 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts have deviated a bit further from previous Liffe trading parameters, and perhaps perversely the 10 year UK debt future recently declined to a new intraday low at 125.62 (-19 ticks on the day) irrespective of the weaker than anticipated and under-50 construction PMI. Conversely, and also rather against normal behaviour, Bunds have just inched up to a fresh, albeit marginal Eurex peak of 165.53 (+31 ticks) after a better than envisaged headline Eurozone Sentix reading, but this can be put down to a relatively pronounced reversal in Italian BTPs from 128.61 at best to 127.77, and for no obvious reason aside from the shaky state of the economy and the fact that Rome continues to challenge Brussels on 2019 budget forecasts. Elsewhere, US Treasuries have also carved out slightly loftier highs in relatively thin conditions and the curve is flatter for choice ahead of a light agenda that including NY ISM and construction spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.7%) and WTI (+0.9%) are benefitting from the positive trade sentiment following reports that US and China are in the final stages of completing a trade deal, alongside China&rsquo;s spokesperson Zhang stating that substantial progress has been made. Adding to the upside is Friday&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count where US oil rigs fell by 10 to 843, the lowest level since May 2018. Elsewhere, Russian oil output was 11.34mln BPD in February, 75k barrels below the October baseline level; according to Energy Ministry Data. Separately, Barclays have maintained their Brent price forecast, stating that prices have moved in-line with their view however Barclays does note that downside risks remain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.4%) prices are weaker weighed on by the positive risk sentiment, with the yellow metal trading towards the bottom of a USD 10/oz range. Elsewhere, Vale have, on a temporary basis, removed its Chief Executive Schvartsman, along side 3 other executives following recommendations by both state and federal prosecutors. Elsewhere, nickel futures, which is used to make stainless steel, have climbed to around a 5-month peak, as the price of stainless steel continues to rise with Chinese steel mills actively replenishing their stocks in-spite of the rising prices; although some mills have been delaying purchases due to the price increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC crude exports in February 24.086mln BPD, falling by 669k BPD, on Gulf cutbacks. Combined Saudi and UAE shipments fell by 763k BPD from January, while exports from Southern Iraq were 3.808mln, +207k BPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraq exports 3.996mln BPD in February, below the 4.081mln BPD average in January</p>\r\n",

Although, there is some slight underperformance in the DAX (U/C) which is weighed on by Fresenius Medical Care (-2.3%) after US President Trump&rsquo;s administration have stated they are looking at value based pricing to promote home dialysis and kidney transplants, designed to spur innovation and decrease in-clinic dialysis; with the market currently dominated by the Co. and US Company DaVita, who are down by around 2% in the pre-market. Sectors are similarly in positive territory; however, the healthcare sector is largely unchanged with sentiment capped by the aforementioned performance of Fresenius Medical Care, along with Novarits (-2.5%) who in spite of their positive update regarding psoriasis are in the red as they are trading ex-dividends today. Other notable movers include, British American Tobacco (+0.5%) who opened down by just under 2% following a class action lawsuit against the Co&rsquo;s Canadian unit. Elsewhere, Casino (-1.6%) are in the red after being downgraded at Societe Generale. Towards the top of the Stoxx 600 are Daily Mail (+4.9%) after the Co. stated they are offloading their GBP 900mln stake in Euromoney, with funds to be returned to shareholders. Separately, Julius Baer (+0.9%) are up after the Co. increased their stake in NSC Asesores by 30% to 70% for an undisclosed amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Dollar is somewhat mixed vs its major counterparts, but the DXY recovered from another US President Trump set-back to revisit 96.600 and marginally eclipse tech resistance (96.594 Fib) on the way. However, latest encouraging reports on US-China trade, suggesting a deal is in the offing have hampered the Greenback to an extent, especially vs more risk-sensitive and high beta currency peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The Pound has shrugged off an unexpected fall in UK construction PMI through the 50 growth/contraction threshold, and instead remains supported at the top of the G10 table on the more positive Brexit-related news in the form of growing support for PM May&rsquo;s Withdrawal Agreement among the more ardent Tory leaver ranks, albeit with set conditions. Indeed, Cable remains close to 1.3250 and Eur/Gbp has retreated from highs around 0.8600, though the latter partly due to relative weakness in the single currency. Note, however, a hefty 1 bn option expiry at the 0.8500 strike looks too distant to come into play today as the cross hovers near 0.8560.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - As noted above, an underperformer amidst broadly risk-on trade at the start of the new week, with stops noted vs the Usd on a break of 1.1350 once last Friday&rsquo;s low was breached taking the headline pair down to 1.1335. Similarly, sell orders are said to have been triggered in Eur/Jpy, possibly through 127.00 and in Eur/Gbp, but the single currency has pared some lost ground in wake of a more upbeat than forecast Sentix index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY - A bit of divergence between the traditional safe-havens, as the Franc remains below parity vs the Greenback on the aforementioned positive US-China paper talk, but the Jpy rebounds from worst levels circa 112.00, perhaps with the aid of those Eur cross sales, to sit just off 111.73 highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD - The Antipodean Dollars are off best levels achieved overnight when the WSJ trade deal between Beijing and Washington near to completion report broke, but still underpinned as the Kiwi keeps its head above 0.6800 and Aussie hovers just below 0.7100. However, Aud/Nzd has slipped back towards 1.0400 in wake of some disappointing pre-RBA data in the form of Gross Company Profits and the Loonie is still underperforming circa 1.3300 lows following last Friday&rsquo;s sub-consensus Canadian GDP release in the run up to the BoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Lira and Peso are under pressure vs the Buck on bearish specific/independent impulses, as softer than expected Turkish CPI could prompt the CBRT to tweak its tight monetary stance on Wednesday, or even shift guidance in preparation for an ease ahead, while the Mxn is clearly feeling the adverse effects of S&amp;P&rsquo;s move to credit watch negative from stable. Note, Usd/Try is currently around 5.3850 vs almost 5.4000 at one stage and Usd/Mxn circa 19.3500 vs 19.3820 earlier, while in stark contrast the Thai Central Bank has been forced to curb excess Thb strength with a 31.75-85 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts have deviated a bit further from previous Liffe trading parameters, and perhaps perversely the 10 year UK debt future recently declined to a new intraday low at 125.62 (-19 ticks on the day) irrespective of the weaker than anticipated and under-50 construction PMI. Conversely, and also rather against normal behaviour, Bunds have just inched up to a fresh, albeit marginal Eurex peak of 165.46 (+24 ticks) after a better than envisaged headline Eurozone Sentix reading, but this can be put down to a relatively pronounced reversal in Italian BTPs from 128.61 at best to 127.77, and for no obvious reason aside from the shaky state of the economy and the fact that Rome continues to challenge Brussels on 2019 budget forecasts. Elsewhere, US Treasuries have also carved out slightly loftier highs in relatively thin conditions and the curve is flatter for choice ahead of a light agenda that including NY ISM and construction spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.7%) and WTI (+0.9%) are benefitting from the positive trade sentiment following reports that US and China are in the final stages of completing a trade deal, alongside China&rsquo;s spokesperson Zhang stating that substantial progress has been made. Adding to the upside is Friday&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count where US oil rigs fell by 10 to 843, the lowest level since May 2018. Elsewhere, Russian oil output was 11.34mln BPD in February, 75k barrels below the October baseline level; according to Energy Ministry Data. Separately, Barclays have maintained their Brent price forecast, stating that prices have moved in-line with their view however Barclays does note that downside risks remain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.4%) prices are weaker weighed on by the positive risk sentiment, with the yellow metal trading towards the bottom of a USD 10/oz range. Elsewhere, Vale have, on a temporary basis, removed its Chief Executive Schvartsman, along side 3 other executives following recommendations by both state and federal prosecutors. Elsewhere, nickel futures, which is used to make stainless steel, have climbed to around a 5-month peak, as the price of stainless steel continues to rise with Chinese steel mills actively replenishing their stocks in-spite of the rising prices; although some mills have been delaying purchases due to the price increase.</p>\r\n",

Conversely, and also rather against normal behaviour, Bunds have just inched up to a fresh, albeit marginal Eurex peak of 165.46 (+24 ticks) after a better than envisaged headline Eurozone Sentix reading, but this can be put down to a relatively pronounced reversal in Italian BTPs from 128.61 at best to 127.77, and for no obvious reason aside from the shaky state of the economy and the fact that Rome continues to challenge Brussels on 2019 budget forecasts. Elsewhere, US Treasuries have also carved out slightly loftier highs in relatively thin conditions and the curve is flatter for choice ahead of a light agenda that including NY ISM and construction spending.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The Dollar is somewhat mixed vs its major counterparts, but the DXY recovered from another US President Trump set-back to revisit 96.600 and marginally eclipse tech resistance (96.594 Fib) on the way. However, latest encouraging reports on US-China trade, suggesting a deal is in the offing have hampered the Greenback to an extent, especially vs more risk-sensitive and high beta currency peers.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Pound has shrugged off an unexpected fall in UK construction PMI through the 50 growth/contraction threshold, and instead remains supported at the top of the G10 table on the more positive Brexit-related news in the form of growing support for PM May’s Withdrawal Agreement among the more ardent Tory leaver ranks, albeit with set conditions. Indeed, Cable remains close to 1.3250 and Eur/Gbp has retreated from highs around 0.8600, though the latter partly due to relative weakness in the single currency. Note, however, a hefty 1 bn option expiry at the 0.8500 strike looks too distant to come into play today as the cross hovers near 0.8560.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>As noted above, an underperformer amidst broadly risk-on trade at the start of the new week, with stops noted vs the Usd on a break of 1.1350 once last Friday’s low was breached taking the headline pair down to 1.1335. Similarly, sell orders are said to have been triggered in Eur/Jpy, possibly through 127.00 and in Eur/Gbp, but the single currency has pared some lost ground in wake of a more upbeat than forecast Sentix index.</p><p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>A bit of divergence between the traditional safe-havens, as the Franc remains below parity vs the Greenback on the aforementioned positive US-China paper talk, but the Jpy rebounds from worst levels circa 112.00, perhaps with the aid of those Eur cross sales, to sit just off 111.73 highs.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD/CAD</strong></p><p>The Antipodean Dollars are off best levels achieved overnight when the WSJ trade deal between Beijing and Washington near to completion report broke, but still underpinned as the Kiwi keeps its head above 0.6800 and Aussie hovers just below 0.7100. However, Aud/Nzd has slipped back towards 1.0400 in wake of some disappointing pre-RBA data in the form of Gross Company Profits and the Loonie is still underperforming circa 1.3300 lows following last Friday’s sub-consensus Canadian GDP release in the run up to the BoC.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Lira and Peso are under pressure vs the Buck on bearish specific/independent impulses, as softer than expected Turkish CPI could prompt the CBRT to tweak its tight monetary stance on Wednesday, or even shift guidance in preparation for an ease ahead, while the Mxn is clearly feeling the adverse effects of S&amp;P’s move to credit watch negative from stable. Note, Usd/Try is currently around 5.3850 vs almost 5.4000 at one stage and Usd/Mxn circa 19.3500 vs 19.3820 earlier, while in stark contrast the Thai Central Bank has been forced to curb excess Thb strength with a 31.75-85 range.</p>",

Gilts actually gapped up off the Liffe open, to 125.87 vs their previous 125.81 settlement, but immediately hit offers and have subsequently traded down to 125.69 before finding underlying bids, probably in part due to the ongoing bounce in Bunds (to 165.44, so far, and eclipsing last Friday’s session high in the process to expose 165.55 next). Back to Liffe, the 3 month strip has been steadier since resumption and only -0.5 to +1 tick either side of parity awaiting the construction PMI.</p>",

(The Independent/ The Guardian) The ERG group have drawn up &ldquo;three tests&rdquo; the government must meet to secure their support for PM May&rsquo;s deal. This includes demands for a &ldquo;clear and unconditional&rdquo; route out of the backstop, language that &ldquo;must go beyond simply re-emphasising/re-interpreting the temporary nature&rdquo; of the arrangement and a legally binding guarantee that the backstop is temporary. (The Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator Barnier told Die Welt that the EU is ready to give the UK further guarantees that the Northern Irish backstop is temporary. However, Barnier reportedly told EU ambassadors that he is having to repeatedly rebut UK demands for a temporary backstop, but he is working on a legal add-on to help PM May. Furthermore, he stated that there is not enough time for the EU to ratify the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, even if the deal passes through the UK House of Commons, hence PM May will have to delay Brexit. Barnier also suggested that Parliamentary arithmetic may be moving towards PM May&rsquo;s favour. (Die Welt/ The Guardian/The Independent)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Attorney General Cox has reportedly ditched attempts to secure a hard time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism from the Irish backstop.

As such, EUR/USD opened above 1.1375 whilst GBP/USD gapped higher amid a weaker greenback coupled with weekend press, including reports that the 1922 Committee Chairman has shifted his stance to help PM May get her deal through Commons, and EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator Barnier stating that he is ready to give further guarantees on the Northern Irish backstop, although Brexit will have to be delayed as there is not enough time for the EU to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement. However, both currency pairs came off highs as the greenback recouped losses throughout the session. Deutsche Bank has turned bullish on Sterling, citing risks of a no-deal Brexit mostly likely off the table by end-March alongside &ldquo;the increased effectiveness of coordination among pro-deal MPs&rdquo;. Elsewhere, antipodeans were initially bolstered amid trade optimism following the aforementioned WSJ trade article. The release of dismal Australian gross company profits knocked AUD/USD lower to sub-0.7100 levels, in turn erasing trade-related gains and denting NZD in sympathy, however, the Aussie and Kiwi then spiked higher after China noted that substantial progress has been made with the US on trade. Finally, USD/CNH opened just below its 50 WMA at 6.7074 on trade progress before falling to sub-6.7000 levels amid news that China&rsquo;s new foreign investment law will strengthen IP protection, which has been a key sticking point in US-China trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Gross Company Profits Q4 0.8% vs. Exp. 3.0% (Prev. 1.9%, Rev. 1.2%) (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S&amp;P affirmed Mexico at &ldquo;BBB+&rdquo;; outlook revised lower to Negative from Stable, citing concerns about lower economic growth and the new government&rsquo;s energy policy.

In the metals complex, gold recovered from recent lows, although price action was largely dominated by the greenback following US President Trump&rsquo;s verbal intervention, whilst copper benefitted from the overall optimism surrounding trade talks.

Much of the afternoon was categorised by rangebound price action, but in later trade the complex caught another wave of selling; many would have expected the T-Note to be bought after a bout of weak data out of the US, however, there may be a few factors explaining both the USD&rsquo;s upside as well as the T-Note&rsquo;s downside: firstly, the Fed is going nowhere anytime soon, with policy data-dependent and the central bank in wait and see mode, rates or the buck are not likely to garner much influence from monpol in absence of a new directional cue; second, as we have pointed out previously, a low FX vol environment (combined with rising stocks) can be a good backdrop for carry strategies (favouring the USD); and third, traders note that next week&rsquo;s macro docket may see dovish updates from the ECB, possibly RBA and possibly even the BOC, which may end up favouring USD. * US T-Note futures (H9) settled 10 ticks lower at 121-14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump reiterated that the US Dollar is too strong, stating that it is prohibitive for business and referred to Fed Chair Powell as &ldquo;a gentleman who likes raising interest rates&rdquo;.

        "content": "<p>Asian equities are mostly higher amid trade-optimism after WSJ noted that a US-Sino trade deal is reportedly being finalised and may be signed during a Trump-Xi Summit at the end of March. On Friday, US equities rose amid the overall risk appetite wherein the S&amp;P closed above the 2800 level for the first time since November last year. The Dow closed above 26000 as Nike and Chevron led the gains, whilst Nasdaq advanced due to outperformance in heavyweight Amazon. ASX 200 (+0.6%) is led by outperformance in the IT sector alongside a strong performance in material names, whilst Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) is lifted by its heavy machinery sector alongside a marginally weaker domestic currency. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) advances as almost all sectors are in the green, whilst Hang Seng (Unch) failed to hold onto opening gains with utility and property names weighing on the index.</p><p>In FX markets, DXY started the week lower following weekend comments from US President Trump who repeated that the USD is too strong and referred to Fed Chair Powell as an individual “who likes to raise interest rates”. As such, EUR/USD opened above 1.1375 whilst GBP/USD gapped higher aided by reports of 1922 Committee Chairman switching his stance to help PM May get her deal through Commons, alongside reports via German press that EU’s Chief Negotiator Barnier is ready to give further guarantees that the Northern Irish backstop is temporary. However, both pairs came off highs as the greenback recouped losses. Elsewhere, antipodeans were initially bolstered amid trade optimism following the aforementioned WSJ trade article . However, the release of dismal Australian gross company profits knocked AUD/USD lower to sub-0.7100 levels and in turn erasing trade-related gains and denting NZD in sympathy.</p>",
