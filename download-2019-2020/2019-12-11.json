Initial reaction was rather stale however as the dust settled markets took it as a dovish meeting which put further pressure on the greenback sending the Dollar Index (DXY) to session lows.

For the most part, the statement was little changed, describing job gains as “solid” and inflation still “below target”; however, it did remain the reference from the statement about ‘uncertainties about this outlook remain’. The ‘dot plot’ appears to have been a mark-to-market affair, with the 2019 dot coming in line with where rates currently are, and like the September projections, the Fed still sees one hike in 2021 and one hike in 2022, while its longer-term dot was unchanged at 2.5%. GDP and inflation forecasts were unchanged (core PCE was revised lower for 2019), though the jobless rate forecast was lowered slightly. The Fed reiterated its data-dependent approach, saying it will continue to monitor incoming data and global developments. Short-term rate futures were little changed after the rate decision.</p><p><strong>* POWELL PRESS CONFERENCE: </strong>Fed Chair Powell retained his upbeat view of the US economy, highlighting the familiar risks of sluggish global growth and trade tensions which are weighing on it. He suggested that the Fed’s insurance rate cuts had kept the US economic outlook on track and policy was now “somewhat accommodative”. In terms of the outlook, Powell reiterated that the stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate as long as incoming data held up, also reiterating that the Fed would respond accordingly to material changes in the outlook. Powell was asked whether the Fed could ‘take back’ the insurance rate cuts it has implemented; he said that three rate cuts was not part of the plan when the Fed began the insurance cuts, and that the need for rate hikes was less than what it was in the mid-1990s cycle. Powell also reiterated that the Fed would need to see a significant, persistent move higher in inflation before it lifted rates. He also stated that it is very challenging to get inflation back to 2%, which saw USD weaken, stocks, gold and T-Notes rise during the press conference (with the implication seemingly that rates may need to remain lower for longer to help the Fed reach its inflation goal). (In wake of these remarks, some commentators highlighted remarks from Powell last year, where he seemed comfortable that inflation was moving to target, and at that stage, Powell did not feel that policy needed to be accommodative). On wage growth, Powell said it was being held back by low productivity and globalisation, adding that the labour market might not be as tight as the FOMC had previously thought. With regards to repo markets, Powell again sought to play down the link between money market operations and monetary policy, saying repo-ops were unlikely to have any macroeconomic implications; he said pressures in recent weeks had been subdued, and the Fed stands ready to adjust operations to keep the EFFR within range. Powell also noted that historically, repo markets face pressure towards year-end, though the Fed chair suggested that he did not foresee any unmanageable stress, and the Fed stood ready to adjust its operations as appropriate, though he played down the notion that this was forthcoming, stating that operations were currently proceeding well.</p><p><strong>* US CPI: </strong>Headline CPI rose +0.3% M/M (exp. +0.2%), and +2.1% Y/Y, rising from the prior +1.8% Y/Y, and above the expected +2.0%. The core rates were unchanged at 2.3% Y/Y (rising +0.2% M/M, in line with the previous pace). \"Overall, core CPI inflation is trending at about 2.25%, but the Y/Y rate will rise in the first half of next year due to a combination of base effects, tariff pass-through and, perhaps, sustained upward pressure in healthcare services,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \"nothing very terrible is likely, but core inflation could easily hit 2.5% by early spring, for the first time since September 2008.\"</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA:</strong> Overnight, White House trade advisor Navarro said no decision had yet been made on delaying the planned 15th December tariff hikes on around USD 160bln of Chinese imports. Ultimately, the news was not particularly new (NEC director Kudlow and Ags Sec Perdue had both this week suggested that Trump was yet to make a decision).</p><p><strong>* ECB PREVIEW:</strong> ECB Monetary Policy Decision Due At 12:45GMT, (13:45CET, 07:45ET), On Thursday 12th December 2019, Press Conference Due At 13:30GMT, (14:30CET, 08:30ET). Christine Lagarde's first meeting as ECB President is not expected to deliver any material changes to current monetary policy settings, given that the September easing measures are yet to take full effect, and there is no urgency to add further accommodation at this stage as the ECB assesses the impact of its September easing. The focus will therefore fall on how Lagarde intends to run the central bank, and its upcoming strategic policy review, which will likely be formally announced at the December confab; but there is a risk that this meeting will be light on details, which may possibly result in horizontal price action. Many believe Lagarde's first task will be uniting a divided Governing Council, where there are mixed views on the efficacy and risks of loose(r) policy, as well as the practicalities of the ECB’s decision-making functions. Lagarde is also expected to reiterate her call on fiscal authorities to do more to support the Eurozone economy. Elsewhere, updated economic projections may see near-term growth forecasts nudged up slightly, though further forecasts are subject to downside risks; inflation forecasts are seen little changed.

However, the pollster highlighted a margin of error in the model with seats ranging between 311-367 seats out of the total 650. With the UK election just two days away, pollsters will continue to release polls up until midnight of tomorrow, given they are not allowed to publish them on election day itself.

The apparent meeting comes after this weekend missile reports from NK and rather punch language from both the US and North Korea. Stratfor’s analysts highlight this meeting could potentially prevent a breakdown in talks as there are worries North Korea may withdraw from negotiations with the States. With the geopolitical consultancy highlighting the US would likely have to offer significant concession to the region, potentially providing NK with sanction relief. It was also reported that the US Envoy to UN Craft stated that the US is prepared to be flexible in talks with North Korea, adds US remains ready to take actions in parallel and to simultaneously take concrete steps towards a denuclearisation deal with North Korea, however they must make the decision to worth with the US.</p><p><strong>* FRANCE PENSION REFORM:</strong> French PM Philippe unveiled the government's proposals for pension reforms on Wednesday. the PM said the retirement age would remain at 62 years old, though the reforms will introduce incentives for French citizens to retire at 64 by 2027. Unions did not welcome the proposals, with some officials suggesting that further strike actions could follow in the coming days. Analysts at Stratfor explain that the French government is seeking to strike a balance between preserving the main tenets of its pension reform and introducing some enticements to make it easier for protesters to accept the plan. Unions and others have been protesting for a week in response to proposals by the government to replace France's multiple pension systems with a single, unified scheme. However, workers fear that the new system will eliminate their current benefits and force them to work longer before retiring, Stratfor said.</p><p><strong>* EUROPEAN COUNCIL (12-13th Dec):</strong> EU leaders will look at several issues, including the EU's long-term budget and climate change. The meeting will be the first EU summit chaired by Charles Michel since he was elected EC President. EU heads of state or government will discuss a proposed budget of EUR 1.087trln for 2021-2027, equal to 1.07% of the gross national income of EU member states.</p><p><strong>* FED POMO:</strong> The Fed will on Thursday publish a new monthly POMO schedule on Thursday, expected to show it will continue purchasing T-bills at a monthly rate of USD 60bln. \"The best short USD trade on POMO-days seems to be against SEK so far,\" Nordea's FX strategists write, \"but USD patterns on days when the [NY Fed market desk] buys USD 7.25bln worth of T-bills are still muddy.\"</p><p><strong>* ECB TLTRO-3:</strong> Additionally, Thursday also sees the second allotment-date in the ECB's TLTRO-3. Watch the take-up – Nordea suggests that the data might start to matter for the EUR liquidity outlook. “An uptake above the EUR 338bln that matures in the TLTRO-2 in June would be needed for the uptake to be seen as a EUR liquidity addition (which would be EURUSD negative, EUR rates negative, etc),” adding “we lean towards a higher uptake as the hoarding of EUR liquidity ahead of the tiering implementation showcased that parts of the Euro system needed further liquidity in the new 6x MRR [minimum reserve requirement] exemption world,” and adds that it is usually a decent idea to be short EUR over the coming month if a big EUR liquidity uptake is seen.</p><p><strong>* WTI (F0) SETTLED USD 0.48 LOWER AT USD 58.76/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLED USD 0.62 LOWER AT USD 63.72/BBL. </strong>Crude benchmarks traded lower amid inventories reporting surprise build in crude stocks and lack of risk appetite. The EIA confirmed the surprise build in crude stocks (+0.8mln vs. exp. -2.8mln) indicated on Tuesday by the API, whilst Cushing reported a large draw of 3.4mln and Us production notched 100k lower to 12.8mln BPD; in the products, both distillates and gasoline printed much larger than expected builds, deepening the wound. Elsewhere in the EIA report, refinery utilization printed a surprise contraction and net imports increased by 634k BPD to 3.487mln BPD, with both imports and exports rising, although the former more acutely. The OPEC Monthly Report didn't provide much impetus for price movement, but analysts were noting the bullish production figures ahead of the new cuts. Also of note, desks are encouraged that Brent remains near USD 64/bbl, which can be seen as a positive from the outcome of the OPEC meetings last week.</p><p><strong>* OPEC MONTHLY OIL REPORT: </strong>2019 and 2020 oil demand growth remained unchanged at 980k BPD and 1.08mln BPD, respectively, whilst OPEC crude production fell by 193k BPD in November to 29.55mln BPD. Oil output increased mostly in Ecuador, Kuwait and Libya, while production decreased in Saudi Arabia, Angola, Iraq and Iran. The share of OPEC crude oil in total global production decreased by 0.3ppts to 29.6% in November 2019 compared to the previous month. There is a slight contrast to the EIA STEO, which saw the 2019 world oil demand view unchanged but raised its 2020 forecast by 50k BPD to 1.42mln BPD. OPEC believes that US oil demand will likely be solid throughout the remainder of the year, whilst EIA noted that US production will likely continue to grow as rig efficacy offsets declining rig activity.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX +0.28%<strong> </strong>at<strong> </strong>3141, NDX up 0.44% at 8655, DJIA +0.1% at 27,911</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Boeing (BA) weighed on the DJIA after the FAA said the 737 MAX will not fly in 2019. Home Depot (HD) gave its FY sales growth view beneath what analysts had expected. GameStop (GME) took a double-digit haircut after a surprise loss in its earnings report, in addition to dismal guidance. Netflix (NFLX) pared some of Tuesday’s losses on a positive mention at Piper Jaffray, although it came under pressure on reports it was offering discount prices to multi-month subscribers. Tesla (TSLA) was bid on sources reporting it would be increasing its Model 3 prices in China. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and Vale (VALE) benefitted from stronger metals prices, with the latter also upgraded to Buy from Hold at Jefferies. Jack Henry (JKHY) dipped on a downgrade to Underperform from In Line at Evercore. Semiconductors (MU, WDC, AMAT, QCOM, SOX) helped the Nasdaq outperform the other major bourses. LogMeIn (LOGM) surged on reports it could be bought out by Elliott. JetBlue (JBLU) traded lower on a Q4 guidance cut.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE (H0) FUTURES SETTLE 11+ TICKS HIGHER AT 129-09. </strong>The TPLEX made gains on Wednesday, working off a weaker Dollar and extending after the FOMC rate decision. As the dollar weakened heading into the US session, the yields followed suit, with the curve initially bull-flattening, although, after the FOMC stood pat and abated any expectations of a hawkish tilt, the short-end caught up, with yields settling across the curve by approximately 4bps.</p><p><strong>* USD:</strong> The buck continued its recent trend lower today hitting a 4 month low after selling was exacerbated by the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision and Fed Chair Powell’s press conference, after comments where the Fed chair talked about the difficulties of bringing inflation to target, with traders reasoning that rate may need to be lower for longer in order to boost price pressures.</p><p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie strengthened a fair bit on Wednesday with USDCAD trading from highs of 1.3240 to lows of 1.3176 without a fresh catalyst, however a potential follow through from USMCA comments could be helping the Loonie, plus a weak dollar today is also weighing on the cross. USDCAD has very almost pared back its move on Friday which saw the cross rise from 1.3175 to highs of 1.3270 driven by a double edged sword, a strong US jobs report and weak Canadian jobs report, with the currency pair trading around the 1.3185 mark at pixel time.</p><p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Was firmer to end the day despite seeing initial defensiveness post the YouGov MRP poll which saw a Tory majority of 28 (its previous forecast in November was a majority of 68), or a 9 point lead over Labour (vs 11 in the November MRP) -- within the margin of error for a hung Parliament (which is generally seen around a 7-point lead). The ultimate size of the majority will be the key catalyst for GBP in the weeks ahead, with desks suggesting a thinner margin allows more uncertainty to enter, while a majority of around 20+ may be needed to quell fears. (It is worth noting that while many desks are highlighting the downside, and risks of a hung parliament, YouGov itself noted that the margin of error is very wide, and cannot rule out either a hung parliament or a large Tory majority, with the implied range forecasting Conservatives taking between 311-367 out of the 650 seats). GBPUSD however was firmer on the day given the broad dollar weakness which saw the cross breach 1.32 to the upside ahead of the election on Thursday.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The single currency traded relatively flat against Sterling but firmer against the buck as the dollar continues to weaken this week, whilst the Euro continues its rise. EURUSD tested 1.1150 to the upside however failed to breach the level on Wednesday trade despite dollar selling in the aftermath of the FOMC.</p><p><strong>* JPY, XAU, CHF: </strong>Havens were genuinely bid, spurred by the latest Fed decision and press conference with USDJPY breaching 108.50 to the downside, a level it resides at heading into the overnight session. US yields were also falling during/post Fed; therefore, rate differentials may also be playing a part to the JPY strength in the tail end of the session. XAU traded just shy of the 1480 mark at highs as the precious metal rallied thank to Fed Chair Powell. CHF traded firmer against the buck, however weaker against GBP and EUR, which were both firmer on the day.</p><p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> The Kiwi government announced an additional NZD 12bln of spending earlier today, which will mostly be allocated to infrastructure spending. NZD is underperforming its Antipodean counterpart on Wednesday, though analysts remind us that the run of NZ data has been decent lately.</p><p><strong>* EMFX (ZAR, BRL, MXN, TRY): ZAR: </strong>Load shedding has ratcheted up this week; the more power outages, the more intense the likely impact on South Africa's economic output. Mining companies have been forced to shut underground operations and processing facilities, as a result. Analysts note that the mining sector last saw outages this intense in 2008, which saw many gold shafts closed, hitting both gold production and mining employment. UBS offers some context on the economic impact: the mining industry contributes around 7.3% of GDP, ZAR 30bln towards government revenues and taxes, and employs 450k people, and it adds that although on Monday Eskom downgraded load-shedding, further capacity constraints are probable given widespread technical problems at coal plants. <strong>BRL:</strong> The Real traded firmer against the buck today driven by further dollar weakness and as participants await tonight’s Selic Rate decision, where the BCB is expected to cut by 50bps after market to 4.50% - it would be the fourth straight meeting of cuts. Some analysts are expecting the BCB to signal the end of the easing cycle -- short of this would be a dovish surprise. Desks think a '50bps cut and done' could be a positive for the BRL. <strong>MXN</strong> also traded firmer today amid the broad dollar weakness, however <strong>TRY</strong> traded flat amid ongoing S-400 concerns where turkey announced the sanctions would not prevent it using the missile defence system, a move likely unwelcomed by the US.</p><p><strong>*&nbsp; SEK, NOK: </strong>Firmer after higher than expected inflation (CPIF +0.1% M/M vs. exp. 0.0; +1.7% Y/Y vs. exp. 1.6%) which some believe raises the risk of a Riksbank hike next week. NOK is struggling to recover after the soft regional surveys out earlier in the week. Some desks have sought to add NOKSEK longs after the soft SEK inflation data.</p><p><strong>* BCB PRIMER:</strong> Brazil’s Central Bank Selic Rate decision is scheduled for release at 20:00 GMT/ 15:00 ET today, where analysts are looking for a fourth consecutive 50bp cut.&nbsp; Some analysts are expecting the BCB to signal the end of the easing cycle -- short of this would be a dovish surprise. Desks think a '50bps cut and done' could be a positive for the BRL. Recently USDBRL has touched record lows causing the central bank to intervene in the FX market by selling dollars therefore any commentary surrounding the BRL weakness will be eyed. Analysts at IGM highlight that participants questioned whether further easing would be implemented after the recent intervention as the two are considered incompatible. Recent data has been strong, with GDP printing firmer than expected both M/M and Y/Y, which IGM highlights it initially saw some unwinding of market pricing for further easing in the future, although since the BRL has strengthened since the intervention, pricing returned to original levels and price in a 50bps cut for today and a further 25bps cut in February. November’s inflation was also firmer than expected at 3.27% Y/Y and 0.51% M/M, BCB’s current inflation targets are 4.25% for 2019, 4% for 2020, 3.75% for 2021 and 3.5% for 2022, however the bank allows a 1.5% leeway either side therefore currently CPI is sitting within the tolerance range of 2.75-5.75%.</p><p><strong>* ISRAEL: </strong>Country may face its third election within the last 12 months after its parliament was given until midnight today to find a lawmaker that could form a coalition, after PM Netanyahu and Gantz were unable to do so. \"Currently there’s been no sign of a breakthrough, and if the stalemate isn’t resolved by the deadline, parliament will set a 2nd March election date and dissolve,\" UBS says, \"A bill to disband the legislature has already been submitted, and parliament scheduled to debate it this morning.\" It was later reported that its parliament began rushing through a bill to call a third general election as the talks between Netanyahu and rival Gantz broke down ahead of the midnight deadline. In terms of a date for the third election in a year, DPA reported Netanyahu is under increasing pressure to hold a leadership primary on December 26th.</p><p><strong>* SNB PREVIEW: </strong>The SNB are expected to leave rates unchanged at -0.75% on Thursday with all 37 contributors surveyed by Reuters forecasting no rate change. Focus for the meeting will be on the small potential for a rate cut and any alterations to the Bank’s language around the CHF either in the report or from Governor Jordan in the subsequent press conference. Recent data prints out of Switzerland are, on balance, painting a down beat picture for the domestic economy; though this is not seen as sufficient to prompt policy action via a rate cut. Commentary since September has largely been reiterations of the SNB’s language around the CHF and willingness to intervene; the most pertinent comments stemmed from Chief Economist Lenz (non-voter) who noted the Bank has additional room for rate cuts, with further cuts ‘not ruled out’. (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/research_sheets/23440/download\">Click here for link</a>)</p><p><strong>* CBRT PREVIEW: </strong>The consensus among analysts points to the Turkey’s Central Bank cutting its Repo Rate by 150bps to 12.50%, while money markets price 108bps worth of easing. As usual, the magnitude of the rate move tends to be unorthodox; the October cut of 250bps was also deeper than expectations at the time. House views unsurprisingly reflect a split; TD Securities expects a 175bps reduction, while ING sees a more modest 100bps cut – the former citing lower global rates, and the latter a seeming end to the front-loading of rate cuts.

        "analysis_details": "<p>Fed Chair Powell retained his upbeat view of the US economy, highlighting the familiar risks of sluggish global growth and trade tensions which are weighing on it. He suggested that the Fed’s insurance rate cuts had kept the US economic outlook on track and policy was now “somewhat accommodative”. In terms of the outlook, Powell reiterated that the stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate as long as incoming data held up, also reiterating that the Fed would respond accordingly to material changes in the outlook. Powell was asked whether the Fed could ‘take back’ the insurance rate cuts it has implemented; he said that three rate cuts was not part of the plan when the Fed began the insurance cuts, and that the need for rate hikes was less than what it was in the mid-1990s cycle. <strong>Powell also reiterated that the Fed would need to see a significant, persistent move higher in inflation before it lifted rates. He also stated that it is very challenging to get inflation back to 2%, which saw USD weaken, stocks, gold and T-Notes rise during the press conference (with the implication seemingly that rates may need to remain lower for longer to help the Fed reach its inflation goal).</strong> (In wake of these remarks, some commentators highlighted remarks from Powell last year, where he seemed comfortable that inflation was moving to target, and at that stage, Powell did not feel that policy needed to be accommodative). On wage growth, Powell said it was being held back by low productivity and globalisation, adding that the labour market might not be as tight as the FOMC had previously thought. With regards to repo markets, Powell again sought to play down the link between money market operations and monetary policy, saying reop ops were unlikely to have any macroeconomic implications; he said pressures in recent weeks had been subdued, and the Fed stands ready to adjust operations to keep the EFFR within range. Powell also noted that historically, repo markets face pressure towards year-end, though the Fed chair suggested that he did not foresee any unmanageable stress, and the Fed stood ready to adjust its operations as appropriate, though he played down the notion that this was forthcoming, stating that operations were currently proceeding well.</p>",

Elsewhere in the EIA report, refinery utilization printed a surprise contraction and net imports increased by 634k BPD to 3.487mln BPD, with both imports and exports rising, although the former more acutely. The OPEC Monthly Report didn't provide much impetus for price movement, but analysts were noting the bullish production figures ahead of the new cuts. Also of note, desks are encouraged that Brent remains near USD 64/bbl, which can be seen as a positive from the outcome of the OPEC meetings last week.</p><p><strong>* OPEC MONTHLY OIL REPORT: </strong>2019 and 2020 oil demand growth remained unchanged at 980k BPD and 1.08mln BPD, respectively, whilst OPEC crude production fell by 193k BPD in November to 29.55mln BPD. Oil output increased mostly in Ecuador, Kuwait and Libya, while production decreased in Saudi Arabia, Angola, Iraq and Iran. The share of OPEC crude oil in total global production decreased by 0.3ppts to 29.6% in November 2019 compared to the previous month. There is a slight contrast to the EIA STEO, which saw the 2019 world oil demand view unchanged but raised its 2020 forecast by 50k BPD to 1.42mln BPD. OPEC believes that US oil demand will likely be solid throughout the remainder of the year, whilst EIA noted that US production will likely continue to grow as rig efficacy offsets declining rig activity.</p>",

For the most part, the statement was little changed, describing job gains as “solid” and inflation still “below target”; however, it did remove the reference from the statement about ‘uncertainties about this outlook remain’. The ‘dot plot’ appears to have been a mark-to-market affair, with the 2019 dot coming in line with where rates currently are, and like the September projections, the Fed still sees one hike in 2021 and one hike in 2022, while its longer-term dot was unchanged at 2.5%. GDP and inflation forecasts were unchanged (core PCE was revised lower for 2019), though the jobless rate forecast was lowered slightly. The Fed reiterated its data-dependent approach, saying it will continue to monitor incoming data and global developments. Short-term rate futures were little changed after the rate decision.</p>",

Attention will be on the forward guidance elements, updated forecasts and ‘dot plot’. In his press conference, Chair Powell may be asked to clarify what factors the Fed needs to be in place that would amount to a “material reassessment” of the outlook – both on the upside and downside – that may result in the FOMC changing its policy stance. Ultimately, Powell is expected to reiterate an optimistic view of the US economy, though caution on familiar risks while reiterating a data-dependent outlook (NOTE: the FOMC precedes a potential boosting of US tariffs on Chinese imports on 15th December). <strong>Rate decision will be published along with updated economic projections at 1900 GMT/1400 ET on 11th December 2019; the post-meeting press conference with Chair Powell will commence at 1930 GMT/1430 ET.</strong></li><li>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.

Desks think a '50bps cut and done' could be a positive for the BRL. Recently USDBRL has touched record lows causing the central bank to intervene in the FX market by selling dollars therefore any commentary surrounding the BRL weakness will be eyed. Analysts at IGM highlight that participants questioned whether further easing would be implemented after the recent intervention as the two are considered incompatible. Recent data has been strong, with GDP printing firmer than expected both M/M and Y/Y, which IGM highlights it initially saw some unwinding of market pricing for further easing in the future, although since the BRL has strengthened since the intervention, pricing returned to original levels and price in a 50bps cut for today and a further 25bps cut in February. November’s inflation was also firmer than expected at 3.27% Y/Y and 0.51% M/M, BCB’s current inflation targets are 4.25% for 2019, 4% for 2020, 3.75% for 2021 and 3.5% for 2022, however the bank allows a 1.5% leeway either side therefore currently CPI is sitting within the tolerance range of 2.75-5.75%.</li></ul>",

This has resulted to mixed trade for <strong>ASX 200 (+0.7%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (U/C) </strong>with Australia lifted by outperformance in the defensive sectors and price action in Tokyo kept to within a tight range as sentiment among large firms deteriorated to a 3-year low, while <strong>Hang Seng (+0.7%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%)</strong> were predominantly indecisive on the differing trade signals, with stronger than expected Chinese financing and lending data doing little to spur upside as participants also contemplated over continued PBoC liquidity inaction and regional growth downgrades from ADB which forecasts growth for the world’s 2nd largest economy to slip below 6% next year. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw a resumption of the recent declines following similar pressure in T-notes, while demand was also subdued by a lack of BoJ buying with the central bank only in the market today for treasury discount bills.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position <strong>PBoC set USD/CNY reference rate at 7.0385 vs. Exp. 7.0378 (Prev. 7.0400)</strong></p><p><strong>White House Trade Adviser Navarro said China is trying to shape the narrative on the trade talks and that he has no indication the December tariffs won't be put on, while he added it is President Trump's decision whether to delay the December 15th tariffs and the decision will come soon</strong>.

Broad-based losses are seen across the board, albeit the FTSE 100 (-0.2%) is largely moving in tandem with the Pound ahead of tomorrow’s UK general election and after the latest MRP polling from YouGov. Sectors are mixed with Utilities propped up in part by Germany’s E.ON (+1.6%) and RWE (+0.7%) amid source reports that Germany will allow the companies to keep their existing carbon emissions certificates due to coal unit shutdowns. That said, the sector’s defensive nature could also be providing some support. Meanwhile, the IT sector is underperforms, potentially on trade jitters amid conflicting reports and rhetoric from both the US and China sides. In terms of individual movers – JD Sports Fashion (-8.7%) shares tumbled at the open after its top shareholder cut its stake in the company but retained his position as major shareholder. Credit Suisse (-0.5%) remains modestly pressured after it revised down its 2020 ROTE guidance to around 10% vs. Prev. 10-11%. On the flipside, Tullow Oil (+5.6%) continues to nurse its wounds following its recent 70% slump, whilst Inditex (+2.7%) is buoyed post-earnings, which showed an YY gains in net profit, net sales, EBITDA and gross profits.</p><p>Saudi Aramco shares open at SAR 35.2 vs. SAR 32 IPO price. (Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>SEK/GBP - </strong>Not quite polar opposites, but contrasting fortunes for the Swedish Krona and Sterling in wake of inflation data and the final pre-UK election poll from YouGov, as the former eclipsed market expectations and matched Riksbank forecasts to effectively seal a repo rate hike next week. However, the MRP survey implies a much tighter result this Thursday than the previous findings, with a projected Tory majority of 28 seats vs 68 seats around the end of November and even that prediction subject to the usual margins of error. In response, Eur/Sek has recoiled sharply to test 10.4500 support vs highs close to 10.5400 and 10.5800+ on Tuesday, while Cable has pulled back from just over 1.3200 to circa 1.3140 after probing bids ahead of 1.3100 and Eur/Gbp bounced through 0.8450 at one stage before fading.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD - </strong>A similar story down under where the tables have turned somewhat on the back of a reversal in cross flows following the latest NZ Half Year Fiscal update revealing a bigger cash balance shortfall and fresh Nzd12 bn budget allocation for infrastructure. Nzd/Usd has lost momentum after a knee-jerk rally to around 0.6555 and Aud/Nzd rebounded from sub-1.0400 towards 1.0450 to help Aud/Usd maintain 0.6800+ status even though RBC joined the chorus for more RBA easing and QE.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/CHF/EUR </strong>- All narrowly mixed against the Greenback as the DXY continues to straddle the 97.500 level in relatively muted/nervy trade awaiting the FOMC, with the Yen meandering between 108.67-84 parameters, Loonie trapped in a 1.3227-39 range and Franc pivoting 0.9850. Elsewhere, the Euro is still looking heavy or toppy into 1.1100 and perhaps conscious that a hefty 1.6 bn option expiries reside from the big figure to 1.1110, not to mention the fact that tomorrow is ECB (and SNB) day.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Divergence also a theme in terms of Rand outperformance compared to Lira underperformance, as Usd/Zar pares back from almost 14.8200 in wake of in line/softer than previous SA CPI on less Eskom load-shedding before attention turns to retail sales data, but Usd/Try hovers around 5.8000 due to renewed US-Turkey sanctions and diplomatic tension rather than a slightely narrower than anticipated current account surplus.</p><p><strong>New Zealand Budget Cash Balance (Jul) -5.154B (Prev. -2.785B).</strong> (Newswires) New Zealand Net Debt Forecast (Jul) 19.6% (Prev. 20.1%) New Zealand OBEGAL Forecast (Jul) -0.943B (Prev. 3.465B)</p><p>New Zealand announced NZD 12bln of new infrastructure spending and sees 2019/20 GDP at 2.3% vs. Prev. 3.2%, while it added that although domestic economy is slowing it is still outperforming global peers.

However, US Treasuries appear a bit more reticent/lethargic in wake of a so-so/mediocre 10 year auction and awaiting inflation data that forms the appetiser before Wednesday’s main course and headline Fed event.</p><p>Saudi Arabia plans to issue USD 32bln in debt in 2020; 45% international and 55% local, according to the head of the Saudi DMO. (Newswires)</p><p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p><p>Mixed trade in the commodities complex with WTI and Brent futures retreating from 12-week highs following last night’s weekly API figures – with crude headline printing a surprise build of 1.41mln barrels vs. expected draw of 2.8mln. Further, the internals came in mostly bearish with distillates and gasoline showing higher-than-forecast builds whilst Cushing printed a deeper-than-expected draw. Traders will be waiting for confirmation from the EIA later today. Meanwhile OPEC’s monthly report (to be released at 13:00GMT) may garner some attention given the EIA STEO left its global oil demand forecast unchanged and included a downward revision to their 2020 US oil supply growth forecast. ING is not surprised by the downward revision given the slowdown seen in US rig activity. In terms of a more macro picture, crude markets will be vulnerable to any US-China headlines amid the contradicting reports regarding tariffs due to be implemented this Sunday. Aside from that, the FOMC’s latest monetary policy decision later could provide the complex with some sentiment-driven action. Today also marked the first trading session for Saudi Aramco, whose shares opened at SAR 35.2 vs. and IPO price of SAR 32.0, hitting limit up after rising 10% and surpassing its earlier valuation of USD 1.7tln. Looking at metals, spot gold prices remain supported ahead of the aforementioned events, with the yellow metal surpassing its 21DMA (USD 1465.50/oz) with eyes on yesterday’s high at USD 1469.15/oz. Copper prices continue to rise and have topped 2.75/lb with its 100 DMA residing around 2.8060/lb. Finally, nickel prices came under pressure in early APAC trade after inventories spiked 21% YY, the largest increase since 2008, but despite this the metal reversed course with the only pertinent news being Indonesia doubling royalties for the ore to 10% - making it more expensive for buyers, thus some front-loading effects may have been priced in.</p><p>US API Inventories: Crude +1.41mln vs. Exp. -2.8mln (Prev. -3.7mln).

Broad-based losses are seen across the board, albeit the FTSE 100 (-0.2%) is largely moving in tandem with the Pound ahead of tomorrow’s UK general election and after the latest MRP polling from YouGov. Sectors are mixed with Utilities propped up in part by Germany’s E.ON (+1.6%) and RWE (+0.7%) amid source reports that Germany will allow the companies to keep their existing carbon emissions certificates due to coal unit shutdowns. That said, the sector’s defensive nature could also be providing some support. Meanwhile, the IT sector is underperforms, potentially on trade jitters amid conflicting reports and rhetoric from both the US and China sides. In terms of individual movers – JD Sports Fashion (-8.7%) shares tumbled at the open after its top shareholder cut its stake in the company but retained his position as major shareholder. Credit Suisse (-0.5%) remains modestly pressured after it revised down its 2020 ROTE guidance to around 10% vs. Prev. 10-11%. On the flipside, Tullow Oil (+5.6%) continues to nurse its wounds following its recent 70% slump, whilst Inditex (+2.7%) is buoyed post-earnings, which showed an YY gains in net profit, net sales, EBITDA and gross profits.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>SEK/GBP</strong> - Not quite polar opposites, but contrasting fortunes for the Swedish Krona and Sterling in wake of inflation data and the final pre-UK election poll from YouGov, as the former eclipsed market expectations and matched Riksbank forecasts to effectively seal a repo rate hike next week. However, the MRP survey implies a much tighter result this Thursday than the previous findings, with a projected Tory majority of 28 seats vs 68 seats around the end of November and even that prediction subject to the usual margins of error. In response, Eur/Sek has recoiled sharply to test 10.4500 support vs highs close to 10.5400 and 10.5800+ on Tuesday, while Cable has pulled back from just over 1.3200 to circa 1.3140 after probing bids ahead of 1.3100 and Eur/Gbp bounced through 0.8450 at one stage before fading.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong> - A similar story down under where the tables have turned somewhat on the back of a reversal in cross flows following the latest NZ Half Year Fiscal update revealing a bigger cash balance shortfall and fresh Nzd12 bn budget allocation for infrastructure. Nzd/Usd has lost momentum after a knee-jerk rally to around 0.6555 and Aud/Nzd rebounded from sub-1.0400 towards 1.0450 to help Aud/Usd maintain 0.6800+ status even though RBC joined the chorus for more RBA easing and QE.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/CHF/EUR</strong> - All narrowly mixed against the Greenback as the DXY continues to straddle the 97.500 level in relatively muted/nervy trade awaiting the FOMC, with the Yen meandering between 108.67-84 parameters, Loonie trapped in a 1.3227-39 range and Franc pivoting 0.9850. Elsewhere, the Euro is still looking heavy or toppy into 1.1100 and perhaps conscious that a hefty 1.6 bn option expiries reside from the big figure to 1.1110, not to mention the fact that tomorrow is ECB (and SNB) day.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Divergence also a theme in terms of Rand outperformance compared to Lira underperformance, as Usd/Zar pares back from almost 14.8200 in wake of in line/softer than previous SA CPI on less Eskom load-shedding before attention turns to retail sales data, but Usd/Try hovers around 5.8000 due to renewed US-Turkey sanctions and diplomatic tension rather than a slightely narrower than anticipated current account surplus.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>The latest advances have been more measured, but from a chart or technical perspective no less telling as <strong>Bunds</strong> notch a new wtd and post-NFP peak at 172.67, while <strong>Gilts</strong> get extremely close on pre-UK vote positioning after YouGov’s MRP at 131.96. However, <strong>US Treasuries</strong> appear a bit more reticent/lethargic in wake of a so-so/mediocre 10 year auction and awaiting inflation data that forms the appetiser before Wednesday’s main course and headline Fed event.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Mixed trade in the commodities complex with <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures retreating from 12-week highs following last night’s weekly API figures – with crude headline printing a surprise build of 1.41mln barrels vs. expected draw of 2.8mln. Further, the internals came in mostly bearish with distillates and gasoline showing higher-than-forecast builds whilst Cushing printed a deeper-than-expected draw. Traders will be waiting for confirmation from the EIA later today. Meanwhile OPEC’s monthly report (to be released at 13:00GMT) may garner some attention given the EIA STEO left its global oil demand forecast unchanged and included a downward revision to their 2020 US oil supply growth forecast. ING is not surprised by the downward revision given the slowdown seen in US rig activity. In terms of a more macro picture, crude markets will be vulnerable to any US-China headlines amid the contradicting reports regarding tariffs due to be implemented this Sunday. Aside from that, the FOMC’s latest monetary policy decision later could provide the complex with some sentiment-driven action. Today also marked the first trading session for Saudi Aramco, whose shares opened at SAR 35.2 vs. and IPO price of SAR 32.0, hitting limit up after rising 10% and surpassing its earlier valuation of USD 1.7tln. Looking at metals, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> prices remain supported ahead of the aforementioned events, with the yellow metal surpassing its 21DMA (USD 1465.50/oz) with eyes on yesterday’s high at USD 1469.15/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> prices continue to rise and have topped 2.75/lb with its 100 DMA residing around 2.8060/lb. Finally, <strong>nickel</strong> prices came under pressure in early APAC trade after inventories spiked 21% YY, the largest increase since 2008, but despite this the metal reversed course with the only pertinent news being Indonesia doubling royalties for the ore to 10% - making it more expensive for buyers, thus some front-loading effects may have been priced in.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>SEK/GBP</strong></p><p>Not quite polar opposites, but contrasting fortunes for the Swedish Krona and Sterling in wake of inflation data and the final pre-UK election poll from YouGov, as the former eclipsed market expectations and matched Riksbank forecasts to effectively seal a repo rate hike next week. However, the MRP survey implies a much tighter result this Thursday than the previous findings, with a projected Tory majority of 28 seats vs 68 seats around the end of November and even that prediction subject to the usual margins of error. In response, Eur/Sek has recoiled sharply to test 10.4500 support vs highs close to 10.5400 and 10.5800+ on Tuesday, while Cable has pulled back from just over 1.3200 to circa 1.3140 after probing bids ahead of 1.3100 and Eur/Gbp bounced through 0.8450 at one stage before fading.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A similar story down under where the tables have turned somewhat on the back of a reversal in cross flows following the latest NZ Half Year Fiscal update revealing a bigger cash balance shortfall and fresh Nzd12 bn budget allocation for infrastructure. Nzd/Usd has lost momentum after a knee-jerk rally to around 0.6555 and Aud/Nzd rebounded from sub-1.0400 towards 1.0450 to help Aud/Usd maintain 0.6800+ status even though RBC joined the chorus for more RBA easing and QE.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed against the Greenback as the <strong>DXY </strong>continues to straddle the 97.500 level in relatively muted/nervy trade awaiting the FOMC, with the Yen meandering between 108.67-84 parameters, Loonie trapped in a 1.3227-39 range and Franc pivoting 0.9850. Elsewhere, the Euro is still looking heavy or toppy into 1.1100 and perhaps conscious that a hefty 1.6 bn option expiries reside from the big figure to 1.1110, not to mention the fact that tomorrow is ECB (and SNB) day.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Divergence also a theme in terms of Rand outperformance compared to Lira underperformance, as Usd/Zar pares back from almost 14.8200 in wake of in line/softer than previous SA CPI on less Eskom load-shedding before attention turns to retail sales data, but Usd/Try hovers around 5.8000 due to renewed US-Turkey sanctions and diplomatic tension rather than a slightely narrower than anticipated current account surplus.</p>",

(+0.2%) were predominantly indecisive on the differing trade signals, with stronger than expected Chinese financing and lending data doing little to spur upside as participants also contemplated over continued PBoC liquidity inaction and regional growth downgrades from ADB which forecasts growth for the world’s 2nd largest economy to slip below 6% next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FTSE 100</strong></p><p><strong>HSBC (HSBA LN)</strong> – Co’s private banking arm admitted to helping US customers hide over USD 1bln in assets for tax authorities.

This has resulted to mixed trade for <strong>ASX 200 (+0.7%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) </strong>with Australia lifted by outperformance in the defensive sectors and price action in Tokyo kept to within a tight range as sentiment among large firms deteriorated to a 3-year low, while <strong>Hang Seng (+0.5%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%)</strong> were predominantly indecisive on the differing trade signals, with stronger than expected Chinese financing and lending data doing little to spur upside as participants also contemplated over continued PBoC liquidity inaction and regional growth downgrades from ADB which forecasts growth for the world’s 2nd largest economy to slip below 6% next year. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw a resumption of the recent declines following similar pressure in T-notes, while demand was also subdued by a lack of BoJ buying with the central bank only in the market today for treasury discount bills.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position <strong>PBoC set USD/CNY reference rate at 7.0385 vs. Exp. 7.0378 (Prev. 7.0400)</strong></p><p><strong>White House Trade Adviser Navarro said China is trying to shape the narrative on the trade talks and that he has no indication the December tariffs won't be put on, while he added it is President Trump's decision whether to delay the December 15th tariffs and the decision will come soon</strong>.

Furthermore, the model showed SNP at 41 (-2) Lib Dems 15 (+2), Brexit Party 0 (-) (Newswires) <i>Note, the margin of error for the model could put the final seat tally for the Conservatives between 311 and 367, therefore suggesting that a hung Parliament is a possibility.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Focaldata MRP model showed Conservatives at 337 seats, Labour 235, SNP 41, Lib Dems 14, Brexit Party 0, which puts the Conservative majority at 24</strong>. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FX</p><p>In FX markets, <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> underperformed with the pullback from the 1.3200 handle exacerbated after the highly anticipated YouGov MRP model projected a narrower majority win for PM Johnson’s Conservatives who are on track to win 339 seats (-20) vs. Labour at 231 seats (+20) for a 28-seat majority vs. Prev. 68-seat majority at the November 27th projection, while reports also noted that 36 seats are to be determined by a slim margin of just 3% or lower. This pressured <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> to take out several key moving average levels and briefly below its 100 hourly moving average but has since found mild solace with the losses eventually stemmed by support a tad north of the 1.3100 level. Elsewhere, the <strong>DXY</strong> eked mild gains but with price action stalled around 97.50 as participants await today’s FOMC and <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was also contained just shy of 1.1100, although <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>GBP</strong> was buoyed momentarily through 0.8450 upon the UK election projection announcement. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were uneventful due to the mixed risk sentiment which kept antipodeans indecisive, with <strong>NZD</strong> also choppy after the Half-Year and Economic Fiscal Update showed a larger budget deficit projection due to higher spending and which initially lifted the currency as it essentially reduces the need for further RBNZ cuts, although these gains were eventually faded.</p><p><strong>New Zealand Budget Cash Balance (Jul) -5.154B (Prev. -2.785B).</strong> (Newswires) New Zealand Net Debt Forecast (Jul) 19.6% (Prev. 20.1%) New Zealand OBEGAL Forecast (Jul) -0.943B (Prev. 3.465B)</p><p>New Zealand announced NZD 12bln of new infrastructure spending and sees 2019/20 GDP at 2.3% vs. Prev. 3.2%, while it added that although domestic economy is slowing it is still outperforming global peers. (Newswires)</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p>Commodities were subdued with WTI crude futures languishing below the USD 59.00/bbl after US officials downplayed the suggestions of a potential delay in the looming US-China tariffs, with prices also weighed following a bearish API report which showed a surprise build in headline crude inventories and almost double than anticipated build for gasoline stockpiles. Elsewhere, price action in gold was restricted by the mild gains in the greenback and with participants sidelined ahead of today’s FOMC, while copper plateaued amid the broad overnight indecision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US API Inventories: Crude +1.41mln vs. Exp. -2.8mln (Prev. -3.7mln).</strong> (Newswires) EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook sees 2019 world oil demand growth unchanged at 0.75mln BPD and 2020 forecast was raised by 50k BPD to 1.42mln BPD Y/Y increase. EIA added it expects US crude oil production to average 13.2mln BPD in 2020 (+0.9mln BPD vs 2019 levels which is slower than 2018 growth of 1.6mln BPD and 2019 growth of 1.3mln BPD, while it forecasts OPEC crude oil production will average 29.3mln BPD in 2020 which is down 0.5mln BPD vs 2019.

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p>US&nbsp;</p><p>T-notes were in the ascendency, at the start of the day, with a bull-flattening bias, before a positive WSJ report on US/China trade saw sellers emerge; however, Treasuries pared losses, as other asset classes did as the report was digested. The US auction of 10-year notes was decent, stopping through the screens by 0.1bps, while cover was a touch firmer than recent averages. Indirect participation was a little softer than recent averages, and like the 3s auction on Monday, direct bidders' participation was firmer. The US will sell 30-year bonds ahead of the FOMC announcement. At settlement, yields were slightly higher on the day across the curve, though major curve spreads had still narrowed by 1-2bps. US T-note (H0) futures settled 1+ ticks lower at 128-29+.</p><p><strong>USTR Lighthizer confirmed a USMCA agreement has been reached and stated that the USMCA will be the model for US trade deals going forward. </strong>There were also comments from Canadian Deputy PM Freeland that all USMCA changes as well as the ratification of the deal ASAP are in Canada's interest, while Mexican Deputy Foreign Minister Seade stated that Mexico’s Senate may need until January to approve the USMCA changes and US Senate Majority Leader McConnell also suggested the USMCA deal will not be taken up by the Senate next week but likely after the Trump impeachment trial as he hopes to deal with the defense and spending bills next week ahead of the recess.

        "content": "<p>A non-committal tone persists across Asia-Pac equity markets following conflicting US-China tariff reports and as this week’s risk events draw near beginning with the FOMC meeting due later today. The latest trade headlines have been varied as initial reports suggested that US and Chinese officials are planning for a delay of December 15th tariffs as they negotiate on agricultural purchases, although President Trump was said to remain undecided and both NEC Director Kudlow and White House Trade Advisor Navarro have leaned back from the notion of a tariff postponement. This has resulted to mixed trade for ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) but with price action kept to within tight ranges, while Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are also indecisive on the differing trade signals, with stronger than expected Chinese financing and lending data doing little to spur upside as participants also contemplate over continued PBoC liquidity inaction and regional growth downgrades from ADB which sees growth for the world’s 2nd largest economy to slip below 6% next year.</p><p>In FX markets, GBP/USD underperforms with the pullback from the 1.3200 handle exacerbated after the highly anticipated YouGov MRP model projected a narrower majority win for PM Johnson’s Conservatives who are on track to win 339 seats (-20) vs. Labour at 231 seats (+20) for just a 28-seat majority vs. Prev. 68-seat majority at the November 27th projection, while reports also noted that 36 seats are to be determined by a slim margin of just 3% or lower. This pressured GBP/USD to take out several key moving average levels and briefly below its 100 hourly moving average but has since found mild solace with the losses eventually stemmed by support a tad north of the 1.3100 level. Elsewhere, the DXY eked mild gains but with price action stalled around 97.50 as participants await today’s FOMC and EUR/USD is also quiet as it bides its time just shy of 1.1100, although EUR/GBP was buoyed briefly through 0.8450 upon the UK election projection announcement. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are uneventful due to the mixed risk sentiment which has also kept antipodeans indecisive, with NZD also choppy after the Half-Year and Economic Fiscal Update showed a larger budget deficit projection due to higher spending and which initially lifted the currency as it essentially reduces the need for further RBNZ cuts, although these gains were eventually faded.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower on resumption of the recent downside and following weakness in T-notes, while demand is also subdued by a lack of BoJ buying with the central bank only in the market today for treasury discount bills.</p>",
