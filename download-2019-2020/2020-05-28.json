Equities once again shrugged-off negative US/China news flow. However, the rally seemed to stall after punchy rhetoric from NEC director Kudlow on China, knocking equity futures off highs, accentuated by Trump announcing he would be holding a press conference on Friday on China. Analysts continue to attribute the upside to re-openings, recoveries and stimulus measures. However, equities may face risk into the end of the week: we are still expecting some action on the US/China front, as suggested by US officials earlier in the week, while US President is to sign an order against social media companies aftermarket on Thursday. Additionally, month-end rebalancing models have suggested equities are a modest sell for pension funds in May, while the Treasury extension is hefty at 0.14yrs, and the USD is also a sell. Boeing Company (BA) announced it has resumed production of its 737 MAX at its Renton Washington Facility at a lower production rate. Note, Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) provide the fuselages for the 737 MAX. US President Trump will sign an executive order today on Social Media companies (TWTR, FB) after Trump accused the platforms of silencing conservative voices; there were no further details provided. Although WSJ reported the draft order would make it easier for regulators to hold the companies accountable for curbing user speech. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) head of corporate and investment banking division stated Q2 revenues for its markets unit are on track to be up over 50% Y/Y thanks to extremely strong fixed income and equities trading revenues. American Airlines Group (AAL) announced it will cut its management and administrative staff by 30% as it plans to shrink the business due to collapsed demand amid the pandemic, according to WSJ. Delta (DAL) are planning to offer buyouts and early retirements to cut costs. Paypal (PYPL) CEO says daily active usage is surging compared to pre-COVID-19, and is continuing to see strong growth in net new actives. UPS (UPS) is reportedly adding a peak delivery surcharge to manage e-commerce demand amid the coronavirus, according to WSJ. GSX Techedu (GSX) faced renewed criticism from both Citron and Muddy Waters. SPX -0.23% at 3029, NDX -0.27% at 9417, DJIA -0.58% at 25,401.</p><p>The UST curve resumed bear steepening today as stocks added to recent gains, supported by further indications of economic recovering; 2s unchanged at 17bp with 30s +4bp at 1.47%. Heading into the US session, the curve lacked direction, however, following weekly jobless claims – which showed the first drop in continued claims since the crises began – duration was offered, seeing the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield gravitate to the 70bp region, although the 2.1mln weekly claims still indicates acute economic pain, just slightly less pain than before, which provided tactical opportunities for short-term market participants. Yields remained close to highs in the latter part of the session, with the USD 38bln new 7-year auction likely sustaining the pressure, which tailed the 0.544% by 0.9bp, covered 2.55x (average), and dealers took slightly more than usual. In recent weeks, the refunding auctions have generally seen decent demand, including the new 20-year bond, although this week’s auctions have been more lacklustre, with the 2s, 5s and 7s all tailing the WI. Many desks had been attributing the prior strong auctions to the Japanese, which have been seen as a buyer of USTs since the cooling of USDJPY cross-currency basis that has made dollar-denominated securities more alluring, mainly due to the Fed’s activity in funding markets, particularly the ramped-up swap lines (note, the weekly Fed balance sheet update is due aftermarket), although this week, if the Japanese were indeed active, they were not alone a strong enough force against the Treasury’s ramped up supply. Furthermore, month-end Treasury rebalancing would not have supported this week’s auctions due to settlements occurring in June. Looking ahead, the Fed will announce its week ahead asset purchases schedule on Friday afternoon, where it will again likely cut its purchases (currently at USD 5bln per day this week, or USD 20bln across the whole week). US T-note futures (u0) settled 6 ticks lower at 138-21.</p>",

Equities once again shrugged-off negative US/China news flow. However, the rally seemed to stall after punchy rhetoric from NEC director Kudlow on China, knocking equity futures off highs, accentuated by Trump announcing he would be holding a press conference on Friday on China. Analysts continue to attribute the upside to re-openings, recoveries and stimulus measures. However, equities may face risk into the end of the week: we are still expecting some action on the US/China front, as suggested by US officials earlier in the week, while US President is to sign an order against social media companies aftermarket on Thursday. Additionally, month-end rebalancing models have suggested equities are a modest sell for pension funds in May, while the Treasury extension is hefty at 0.14yrs, and the USD is also a sell. Crude tracked risk, as well as some remarks on the OPEC+ front that suggests the group will take action to extend its agreement at the 9th June confab. Treasuries struggled for direction early doors, but have resumed bear-steepening. The USD is lower as the EUR makes progress above 1.10. On the data front, weekly claims fell as expected, but more crucially, continuing claims saw its first pandemic decline; US GDP in Q1 was revised a touch lower, but the inventory dynamics suggests there might be less of a drag than previously foreseen in the Q2 data (Atlanta Fed is still tracking Q2 growth at -40%, however). A US 7-year auction was lacklustre, and in fitting with the other note supply out of the US, seeing a tail.</p><h2>NORTH AMERICA</h2><p><strong>CHINA PRESS CONFERENCE: </strong>US President Trump said he would give a press conference on China on Friday (time unclear). Analysts have noted the likely outcome that the US puts the same tariffs that are in place on China, on Hong Kong, thus removing the jurisdiction’s current benefits, as has been hinted at greatly already by US officials. It is also possible that the US could take some further steps against Huawei, or potentially make changes to the Phase One trade deal.</p><p><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA ORDER: </strong>Trump signed the executive order on social media (FB, TWTR, SNAP), meaning they will no longer have a liability shield, and announced that the administration would pursue legislation and litigation against companies in addition to the executive order. Trump said he has directed Attorney General Barr to cooperate with states to enforce their own laws against the “deceptive business practices” of social media companies. Barr said that the order does not repeal Section 230 of the communications law, but the administration may look into removing or changing it. Note, Section 230 states “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”</p><p><strong>HONG KONG: </strong>Overnight, China’s Parliament voted to approve the Hong Kong National Security Bill, as expected, while the US House passed the bill calling for sanctions on Chinese officials related to the crackdown on Uighur minorities, as expected. The session continued peppered with rhetoric on both sides. Chinese Gov’t advisors said Beijing is “prepared for the worst-case scenario” with the US, reiterating that its actions will be carried out if the US follows through. NEC Director Kudlow later said on CNBC that China is making a big mistake in taking control of Hong Kong, and HK may be needed to treated the same as China regarding tariffs.</p><h2>DATA</h2><p><strong>US JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Weekly initial jobless claims printed 2.123mln in the week ending 23rd May (expected was 2.1mln, prior was revised up to 2.446mln). Continuing claims printed its first pandemic fall to 21.05mln (street was looking for 25.75mln against the prior revised 24.9mln) - the latter was taken as a positive signal that gross hiring is beginning to rebound. Cumulatively, the pandemic has now resulted in over 40mln claims. But Google searches data suggest initial jobless claims data will likely fall next week too, to around 1.8mln, and the current pace suggests that it could fall sub-1mln by the end of June, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. Pantheon Macroeconomics says the big surprise in the report was the fall in continuing claims (that data is for the week ending 16th May), which the consultancy says suggests that the reopening of states is pushing businesses to rehire some of the people let go when the virus hit. “The headline number overstates the true extent of the hiring, though, because California requires people to re-file bi-weekly, and this is an off-week,” it writes, “California continuing claims fell by 1.4mln, despite the near-total lock down in the state over the period, so we’re discounting this as evidence of an improving labour market.” There was also an improvement in continuing claims in Florida too (by 1.6mln); “that’s more plausible, given the reopening of the state, though it’s a much bigger drop than we expected.” Elsewhere, it says that the remaining 0.9mln aggregate decline was spread around the country. The continuing claims decline is a key development given that it coincides with the May BLS jobs report survey period, and that could suggest “that that the drop in payrolls this month will be a bit smaller than implied by the surge in initial claims since the April survey,” Pantheon writes, “but the main impact - if continuing claims keep falling, as we expect - will come in the June numbers.”</p><p><strong>US Q1 GDP </strong>was revised down to -5.0% annualised from -4.8% at the second reading. The underlying details are more encouraging, however, with growth of final sales to domestic buyers revised up to -3.3% from -5.4%, as the contractions in both consumption and business investment were trimmed from the advance estimates, Capital Economics notes. In contrast, inventories are now seen taking 1.4% off overall GDP growth (it was 0.6% in the advanced report). “The upshot is that while Q1 was slightly worse than we thought, the decline in Q2 could be smaller because more of the inventory adjustment had already occurred,” CapEco says, “For now, we are sticking with our forecast that GDP will fall by 40% annualised in the second quarter, in part because the decline in consumption is on track to be steeper than we initially thought.”</p><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>FED: </strong>Fed’s<strong> </strong>Kaplan (voter) said the economy has bottomed and expects growth in H2 and in 2021; baseline forecast of unemployment falling to 10-11% by year-end, under 7% by 2021-end, in which he is assuming consumers are willing to travel, eat-out and resume activity. Kaplan said a massive increase in testing is critical for consumers to be willing to re-engage, to which there is downside risks if testing is not ramped up. Fed’s Williams (voter, neutral) spoke again today and reiterated that inflation is falling not rising and expects it to run below levels seen in the last year or two. The NY Fed President also noted that the Fed has other tools more effective than negative rates to stimulate the economy, saying they don’t make sense.</p><h2>FIXED INCOME</h2><p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (U0) SETTLE 6 TICKS LOWER AT 138-21.</strong></p><p>The UST curve resumed bear steepening today as stocks added to recent gains, supported by further indications of economic recovering; 2s unchanged at 17bp with 30s +4bp at 1.47%. Heading into the US session, the curve lacked direction, however, following weekly jobless claims – which showed the first drop in continued claims since the crises began – duration was offered, seeing the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield gravitate to the 70bp region, although the 2.1mln weekly claims still indicates acute economic pain, just slightly less pain than before, which provided tactical opportunities for short-term market participants. Yields remained close to highs in the latter part of the session, with the USD 38bln new 7-year auction likely sustaining the pressure, which tailed the 0.544% by 0.9bp, covered 2.55x (average), and dealers took slightly more than usual. In recent weeks, the refunding auctions have generally seen decent demand, including the new 20-year bond, although this week’s auctions have been more lacklustre, with the 2s, 5s and 7s all tailing the WI. Many desks had been attributing the prior strong auctions to the Japanese, which have been seen as a buyer of USTs since the cooling of USDJPY cross-currency basis that has made dollar-denominated securities more alluring, mainly due to the Fed’s activity in funding markets, particularly the ramped-up swap lines (note, the weekly Fed balance sheet update is due aftermarket), although this week, if the Japanese were indeed active, they were not alone a strong enough force against the Treasury’s ramped up supply. Furthermore, month-end Treasury rebalancing would not have supported this week’s auctions due to settlements occurring in June. Looking ahead, the Fed will announce its week ahead asset purchases schedule on Friday afternoon, where it will again likely cut its purchases (currently at USD 5bln per day this week, or USD 20bln across the whole week).</p><h2>CRUDE</h2><p><strong>WTI FUTURES (N0) SETTLED USD 0.90 HIGHER AT USD 33.71; BRENT (Q0) SETTLED USD 0.58 HIGHER AT USD 36.06.</strong></p><p>Crude futures traded firmer on Thursday despite bearish US inventories and mixed risk appetite, with constructive OPEC updates driving the price action ahead of its 9th June confab. After Wednesday’s losses in the energy complex, sentiment deteriorated further after the bearish private inventory data report overnight, with WTI (N0) reaching lows of 31.14 and Brent at 33.62. However, heading into the US session, futures treaded firmer and were little phased in the wake of the surprisingly bearish inventory report. The EIA confirmed the private data from last night; weekly crude stocks +7.9mln (exp. -1.9mln), gasoline -0.7mln (exp. +0.1mln), distillates +5.5mln (exp. +1.8mln), while Cushing stocks conversely posted a -3.4mln draw; the chunky builds warrant some caution on expectations of the economy posting a smooth recovery. Meanwhile, weekly crude production in the US fell by 100k BPD to 11.4mln BPD, while refinery utilisation rose by 1.9% (exp. +1.0%). Nonetheless, energy took its cues from equities in the latter part of the session finding strength into settlement.</p><p><strong>OPEC: </strong>Saudi Arabia and some other OPEC+ nations want to extend current output cuts of 9.7mln BPD, OPEC+ sources said, although Russia is yet to agree; additionally, some sector players believe demand recovery may justify gradual easing of curbs. However, Russian press noted that it could support an extension of current oil cuts for another two-months. Note, earlier in the week the Russian government tentatively approved plans to drill new oil wells to stand ready to pump in 2022 when the OPEC+ deal expires, according to a government statement published Tuesday. Additionally, Energy Intelligence previously reported that Russian companies have been raising concerns regarding maintaining cuts with Energy Minister Novak, reportedly saying that the market could re-balance itself as soon as June/July.</p><p><strong>FED’S KAPLAN</strong> said it will take until H2 2021 to work off the global excess inventory; sees US oil production down by 2mln BPD Y/Y to 10.8mln in December 2020. Sees Permian Basin output falling by as much as 1mln BPD. Kaplan said some smaller oil producers and leveraged firms will not survive and expects there to be consolidation in the sector; added that oil drillers will face challenges ramping up again after layoffs.</p><h2>EQUITIES</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -0.23% at 3029, NDX -0.27% at 9417, DJIA -0.58% at 25,401.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Energy -2.91%, Financials -1.56%, Cons Disc -1.05%, Industrials -0.98% Communication Svs -0.96%, Technology -0.19%, Cons Stpl +0.75%, Materials +0.83%, Real Estate +1.24%, Health +1.26%, Utilities +3.04%.</p><p><strong>EUROPE CLOSES:</strong> EURO STOXX 50 (+1.5%) at 3098, FTSE 100 (+1.3%) at 6223, DAX (+1.15%) at 11,786, CAC 40 (+2%) at 4784, IBEX 35 (+0.6%) at 7217, FTSE MIB (+2.3%) at 18,331, SMI (+2.2%) at 9931.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Boeing Company (BA) announced it has resumed production of its 737 MAX at its Renton Washington Facility at a lower production rate. Note, Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) provide the fuselages for the 737 MAX. US President Trump will sign an executive order today on Social Media companies (TWTR, FB) after Trump accused the platforms of silencing conservative voices; there were no further details provided. Although WSJ reported the draft order would make it easier for regulators to hold the companies accountable for curbing user speech. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) head of corporate and investment banking division stated Q2 revenues for its markets unit are on track to be up over 50% Y/Y thanks to extremely strong fixed income and equities trading revenues. American Airlines Group (AAL) announced it will cut its management and administrative staff by 30% as it plans to shrink the business due to collapsed demand amid the pandemic, according to WSJ. Delta (DAL) are planning to offer buyouts and early retirements to cut costs. Paypal (PYPL) CEO says daily active usage is surging compared to pre-COVID-19, and is continuing to see strong growth in net new actives. UPS (UPS) is reportedly adding a peak delivery surcharge to manage e-commerce demand amid the coronavirus, according to WSJ. GSX Techedu (GSX) faced renewed criticism from both Citron and Muddy Waters.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Workday (WDAY) missed on EPS but revenue was in line, although it announced plans to further integrate its partnership with Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT). NetApp (NTAP) beat on both EPS and revenue, although guidance was weak.&nbsp; DollarTree (DLTR) reported top and bottom-line beats while SSS also exceeded estimates. Dollar General (DG) also saw beats across the board.</p><h2>BREXIT</h2><p><strong>UK PM JOHNSON</strong> will reportedly meet with European leaders in Brussels next week. As a reminder, there has been plenty of pessimism regarding progress in negotiation with UK Brexit Negotiator Frost earlier stating the mandate in key areas is not likely to reach an agreement regarding EU needs, while he added there is a fundamental disagreement with the EU on most aspects of the level playing field and is beginning to think we might not make it by 30th June regarding a potential deal on fisheries. Furthermore, later today EU Chief Brexit negotiator Barnier said he believes fisheries and the level playing-field remain the most divisive issue, although believes that an agreement on fisheries would be easier, the Express reported. Barnier believes that the reluctance of David Frost, the PM’s chief negotiator, to engage on the EU’s level-playing field proposals has led Barnier to believe the UK is ready to accept no deal and trade tariffs in order to have full regulatory independence.</p><h2>FX WRAP</h2><p><strong>EUR makes progress above 1.10; DXY falls to lowest since late March</strong></p><p><strong>USD:</strong> The dollar sold-off once the US session got underway as equities caught a bid after a rather tentative morning which saw DXY breach 99.0 to the downside to lows at 98.5 while month end models are leaning towards USD selling.</p><p><strong>CNH:</strong> USDCNH fell from the highs yesterday as we are yet to see any firm actions from the US on China after it declared HK was no longer autonomous from China. However, there is some caution warranted given that US President Trump previously stated we will know by the end of this week what the actions on China will be. Overnight the PBoC fixing was a weaker fixing than the prior but one which was firmer than expected, which to TD suggests the PBOC are tolerant of the weakness so far.</p><p><strong>EUR:</strong> The single currency crossed 1.10 to the upside as the dollar was sold as it continues to benefit from the EU recovery fund compromise. Citi remains bearish in the medium-term, adding technical levels are also at risk of being breached. Although it adds that should we close above 1.1060, it opens the way for potentially another two big figures to the topside; similarly ING is looking for 1.12.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS:</strong> Risk sensitive FX was generally bid today as the US session got underway, with AUD, NZD and GBP performing well despite the overall narrative not changing all that much; desks continue to be mindful of US/China risk.</p><p><strong>AUD:</strong> The Aussie broke above 0.66 and continued north of 0.6650 as the currency caught a tailwind from today’s risk appetite. Additionally, RBA Governor Lowe overnight leaned back on negative rates, though said the RBA could purchase more government bonds if further QE is needed, even if it currently does not see a need to do so. He also reiterated that 25bps is the ELB, adding that rates are to stay this low for some years. On the data front, Capital Expenditure fell by 1.6%, a decline less steep than the expected 2.6% fall and the pace slowed from the prior -2.8%. Westpac writes “if CNY starts to stabilise as we expect and equities don’t suffer a sustained reversal, AUD/USD should find support on dips and try again to close above the 200dma at 0.6658”.</p><p><strong>NZD:</strong> The Kiwi tracked risk appetite, as did the Aussie, while overnight New Zealand’s Business confidence data printed -41.8, albeit still grim, it was better than April’s -66.6. The activity outlook also rebounded somewhat from -55.1 to -38.7 in May, although still a grim print but adds to the narrative the worst is behind us.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling benefited from the risk rally and Dollar selling today, driving Cable back above 1.23. However, Brexit woes still linger with the Brexit extension deadline approaching and chatter of negative rates from the BoE MPC. However, UK Brexit negotiator Barnier still sees a possibility that a deal can be struck before the end of the year. Meanwhile on the reopening, UK PM Johnson announced schools and some shops are to reopen from Monday. Deutsche Bank likes selling the GBP Trade Weighted Index (TWI) noting that the sell off so far has been modest compared to the GFC and see several reasons history could repeat itself: “a lagging covid-19 reopening, rising real estate and Brexit related risks and the specter of negative rates.”</p><p><strong>CAD:</strong> The loonie failed to benefit from the risk rally and the firmer crude complex today while the Q1 current account data saw a wider deficit than expected and previous. With cyclical counterparts performing well today, and CAD not, Scotiabank suggest the recent rally “may be getting tired”.</p><p><strong>JPY:</strong> USDJPY saw a rather tame session trading within 107.58-107.89 parameters. RBC highlights that Japan were once again net sellers of foreign bonds last week, with net selling occurring in 10 of the last 11 weeks. The bank states “this flow is JPY‐positive and is probably being compounded by the re-hedging of existing foreign investments, reflecting the collapse in the cost of hedging as US rates have converged to Japanese levels”.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> Were mixed, with BRL, TRY and ZAR all weaker against a falling dollar, meanwhile MXN and RUB were firmer as the two found support from the rising oil prices. BRL was the EMFX underperformer today amid a slowed inflation pace although its unemployment rate was not as high as feared. The BRL has pared back some losses after reaching a 5.97 high on 14th May, Credit Suisse highlights why we have seen a reversal. The desk writes the BCB view has changed noting how the recent rebound has been amid less intervention from the BCB, perhaps suggesting the BRL is no longer perceived as “detatched from fundamentals”, as BCB Chief Neto stated the BCB is ready to intervene more aggressively if the BRL were perceived as such. The political situation has also stabilised somewhat.</p>",

Heading into the US session, the curve lacked direction, however, following weekly jobless claims – which showed the first drop in continued claims since the crises began – duration was offered, seeing the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield gravitate to the 70bp region, although the 2.1mln weekly claims still indicates acute economic pain, just slightly less pain than before, which provided tactical opportunities for short-term market participants. Yields remained close to highs in the latter part of the session, with the USD 38bln new 7-year auction likely sustaining the pressure, which tailed the 0.544% by 0.9bp, covered 2.55x (average), and dealers took slightly more than usual. In recent weeks, the refunding auctions have generally seen decent demand, including the new 20-year bond, although this week’s auctions have been more lacklustre, with the 2s, 5s and 7s all tailing the WI. Many desks had been attributing the prior strong auctions to the Japanese, which have been seen as a buyer of USTs since the cooling of USDJPY cross-currency basis that has made dollar-denominated securities more alluring, mainly due to the Fed’s activity in funding markets, particularly the ramped-up swap lines (note, the weekly Fed balance sheet update is due aftermarket), although this week, if the Japanese were indeed active, they were not alone a strong enough force against the Treasury’s ramped up supply. Furthermore, month-end Treasury rebalancing would not have supported this week’s auctions due to settlements occurring in June. Looking ahead, the Fed will announce its week ahead asset purchases schedule on Friday afternoon, where it will again likely cut its purchases (currently at USD 5bln per day this week, or USD 20bln across the whole week).</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Crude futures traded firmer on Thursday despite bearish US inventories and mixed risk appetite, with constructive OPEC updates driving the price action ahead of its 9th June confab. After Wednesday’s losses in the energy complex, sentiment deteriorated further after the bearish private inventory data report overnight, with WTI (N0) reaching lows of 31.14 and Brent at 33.62. However, heading into the US session, futures treaded firmer and were little phased in the wake of the surprisingly bearish inventory report. The EIA confirmed the private data from last night; weekly crude stocks +7.9mln (exp. -1.9mln), gasoline -0.7mln (exp. +0.1mln), distillates +5.5mln (exp. +1.8mln), while Cushing stocks conversely posted a -3.4mln draw; the chunky builds warrant some caution on expectations of the economy posting a smooth recovery. Meanwhile, weekly crude production in the US fell by 100k BPD to 11.4mln BPD, while refinery utilisation rose by 1.9% (exp. +1.0%). Nonetheless, energy took its cues from equities in the latter part of the session finding strength into settlement.</p><p><strong>OPEC:&nbsp;</strong>Saudi Arabia and some other OPEC+ nations want to extend current output cuts of 9.7mln BPD, OPEC+ sources said, although Russia is yet to agree; additionally, some sector players believe demand recovery may justify gradual easing of curbs. However, Russian press noted that it could support an extension of current oil cuts for another two-months. Note, earlier in the week the Russian government tentatively approved plans to drill new oil wells to stand ready to pump in 2022 when the OPEC+ deal expires, according to a government statement published Tuesday. Additionally, Energy Intelligence previously reported that Russian companies have been raising concerns regarding maintaining cuts with Energy Minister Novak, reportedly saying that the market could re-balance itself as soon as June/July.</p>",

However, there is some caution warranted given that US President Trump previously stated we will know by the end of this week what the actions on China will be. Overnight the PBoC fixing was a weaker fixing than the prior but one which was firmer than expected, which to TD suggests the PBOC are tolerant of the weakness so far.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong>:&nbsp;The single currency crossed 1.10 to the upside as the dollar was sold as it continues to benefit from the EU recovery fund compromise.&nbsp;Citi remains bearish in the medium-term, adding technical levels are also at risk of being breached. Although it adds that should we close above 1.1060, it opens the way for potentially another two big figures to the topside; similarly ING is looking for 1.12.</p><p><strong>CYCLICALS</strong>: Risk sensitive FX was generally bid today as the US session got underway, with AUD, NZD and GBP performing well despite the overall narrative not changing all that much; desks continue to be mindful of US/China risk.</p><p><strong>AUD</strong>: The Aussie broke above 0.66 and continued north of 0.6650 as the currency caught a tailwind from today’s risk appetite. Additionally, RBA Governor Lowe overnight leaned back on negative rates, though said the RBA could purchase more government bonds if further QE is needed, even if it currently does not see a need to do so. He also reiterated that 25bps is the ELB, adding that rates are to stay this low for some years. On the data front, Capital Expenditure fell by 1.6%, a decline less steep than the expected 2.6% fall and the pace slowed from the prior -2.8%. Westpac writes “if CNY starts to stabilise as we expect and equities don’t suffer a sustained reversal, AUD/USD should find support on dips and try again to close above the 200dma at 0.6658”.</p><p><strong>NZD</strong>: The Kiwi tracked risk appetite, as did the Aussie, while overnight New Zealand’s Business confidence data printed -41.8, albeit still grim, it was better than April’s -66.6. The activity outlook also rebounded somewhat from -55.1 to -38.7 in May, although still a grim print but adds to the narrative the worst is behind us.</p><p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling benefited from the risk rally and Dollar selling today, driving Cable back above 1.23. However, Brexit woes still linger with the Brexit extension deadline approaching and chatter of negative rates from the BoE MPC. However, UK Brexit negotiator Barnier still sees a possibility that a deal can be struck before the end of the year. Meanwhile on the reopening, UK PM Johnson announced schools and some shops are to reopen from Monday. Deutsche Bank likes selling the GBP Trade Weighted Index (TWI) noting that the sell off so far has been modest compared to the GFC and see several reasons history could repeat itself: “a lagging covid-19 reopening, rising real estate and Brexit related risks and the specter of negative rates.”</p><p><strong>CAD</strong>: The loonie failed to benefit from the risk rally and the firmer crude complex today while the Q1 current account data saw a wider deficit than expected and previous. With cyclical counterparts performing well today, and CAD not, Scotiabank suggest the recent rally “may be getting tired”.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong>: USDJPY saw a rather tame session trading within 107.58-107.89 parameters. RBC highlights that Japan were once again net sellers of foreign bonds last week, with net selling occurring in 10 of the last 11 weeks. The bank states “this flow is JPY‐positive and is probably being compounded by the re-hedging of existing foreign investments, reflecting the collapse in the cost of hedging as US rates have converged to Japanese levels”.</p><p><strong>EMFX</strong>: Were mixed, with BRL, TRY and ZAR all weaker against a falling dollar, meanwhile MXN and RUB were firmer as the two found support from the rising oil prices. BRL was the EMFX underperformer today amid a slowed inflation pace although its unemployment rate was not as high as feared. The BRL has pared back some losses after reaching a 5.97 high on 14th&nbsp;May, Credit Suisse highlights why we have seen a reversal. The desk writes the BCB view has changed noting how the&nbsp;recent rebound has been amid less intervention from the BCB, perhaps suggesting the BRL is no longer perceived as “detatched from fundamentals”, as BCB Chief Neto stated the BCB is ready to intervene more aggressively if the BRL were perceived as such. The political situation has also stabilised somewhat.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>A choppy day for the broader Dollar and index having pivoted 99.000 throughout a bulk of the EU session before yielding to a bout of selling heading into tomorrow month-end fix with models pointing to modest USD outflows. Nonetheless, the DXY was initially unfazed by a revision lower to Q1 GDP and larger than forecast jobless claim figures. The index looks to end the EU session near session lows having waned off its a high of 99.094 and its 100 DMA (99.032) to print a base under yesterday’s 98.713 low at 98.706.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Both looking to end the session on a modestly positive footing but largely pinned to USD action throughout the session. The Single Currency was unreactive to an in-line prelim CPI figure whilst a mixed EZ sentiment survey was also overlooked. EUR/USD looks to end the EU session a few pips north of 1.1000 having pivoted on either side of its 200 DMA (1.1010) throughout the session. Cable meanwhile meanders around 1.2275 heading into the close (daily range 1.2235-87) range – BoE MPC member Saunders was vague on his view on negative rates and signalled a more central stance whilst failing to impact the Sterling at the time. Elsewhere. PM Johnson expected to announce steps for further easing later today. Meanwhile, the wider focus remains on any setbacks over negotiations both regarding the EU Recovery Fund among EU27 and post-Brexit trade FTA between UK and the EU, with Brexit Negotiator Barnier reportedly more sanguine on an agreement on fisheries. EUR/GBP remained flat within a tight 0.8960-90 band throughout the bulk of the session.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong></p><p>Choppy trade but within tight ranges for the high-beta currencies but the day has been largely led by USD action. Antipodeans look to end the European session flat/modestly firmer with AUD/USD north of 0.6600 but still below its 200 DMA ~0.6657 having clocked in an intraday band of 0.6586-0.6635 after RBA gov Lowe provided little immediate impetus amid a raft of reiterations. The Kiwi meanwhile re-eyes its 100 DMA at 0.6200 to the upside having touched a daily low at 0.6179 and a ceiling at 0.6206. The CAD meanwhile was also influenced by losses in the energy markets – USD/CAD remains north of its 100 DMA (1.3709) and the 1.3750 psychological level.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF, XAU</strong></p><p>Safe-haven FX eked modest losses as stock mostly held onto gains throughout EU trade with little by way of fresh catalysts to spur action in the Yen or Franc. That being said, spot gold saw a day of steady gains with some noting of investor position amid heightening US-Sino tensions. USD/JPY looks to end the day towards the bottom of a tight 107.67-89 daily parameter.&nbsp; USD/CHF heads to the close within yesterday;s ranges and below its 50DMA at 0.9700 (having briefly brieched the level earlier in the day). Gold heads to the close at the top of its 1708-25/oz daily range.</p><p><strong>Yuan</strong></p><p>Tensions between US and China will remain a theme with no apparent signs of subsiding for now – with Hong Kong no longer deemed autonomous from China and Beijing reiterating its readiness to retaliate over interference. CNH gained throughout the session and benefitted from the Dollar downside, albeit remains north of 7.1500 but off its 7.1875 daily peak heading into the EU close.</p>",

Chinese ADRs (TCOM, BIDU) also under-performing. Other sector performance is also mixed, although defensives (Utilities, Health Care &amp; Staples) are outperforming and in positive territory, meanwhile Energy, Industrials and Financials open with losses. Overall the tone is mixed, the dollar is soft, risk sensitive FX is slightly firmer, although EMFX is weaker. Meanwhile the Treasury curve is steepening out, having been in positive territory earlier, yields are now mostly higher. <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-q1-gdp-revised-down-but-q2-decline-could-be-smaller-than-forecast-due-to-inventory-capital-economics-says-28-05-2020\">US Q1 GDP</a> was revised lower to -5% from -4.8% while <a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/analysis-us-weekly-initial-jobless-and-continuing-claims-data-signal-hiring-is-rebounding-pantheon-macroeconomics-says-28-05-2020\">Initial Jobless Claims</a> saw 2.123mln claims this week, in-line with estimates and down from the prior revised 2.446mln, continuing its downward trend from the ~7mln peak.</p><p><strong>EARNINGS: </strong>Workday (WDAY) missed on EPS but revenue was in line, although it announced plans to further integrate its partnership with Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT). NetApp (NTAP) beat on both EPS and revenue, although guidance was weak.&nbsp; DollarTree (DLTR) reported top and bottom-line beats while SSS also exceeded estimates. Dollar General (DG) also saw beats across the board.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Boeing Company (BA) announced it has resumed production of its 737 MAX at its Renton Washington Facility at a lower production rate. Note, Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) provide the fuselages for the 737 MAX. US President Trump will sign an executive order today on Social Media companies (TWTR, FB) after Trump accused the platforms of silencing conservative voices; there were no further details provided. Although WSJ reported the draft order would make it easier for regulators to hold the companies accountable for curbing user speech. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) head of corporate and investment banking division stated Q2 revenues for its markets unit are on track to be up over 50% Y/Y thanks to extremely strong fixed income and equities trading revenues. American Airlines Group (AAL) announced it will cut its management and administrative staff by 30% as it plans to shrink the business due to collapsed demand amid the pandemic, according to WSJ. Delta (DAL) are planning to offer buyouts and early retirements to cut costs.</p><p><strong>S&amp;P 500 END-2020 POLL:</strong> Reuters’ May poll sees analyst projected the S&amp;P 500 will end 2020 at 2,950 (analysts were forecasting 3,400 in the February poll, before the Q1 crash). The poll – carried out over the last two weeks – also suggests that analysts do not see the index falling back to March lows due to the ‘Fed backstop’ and substantial fiscal stimulus. Nevertheless, it reveals that the uncertainty around the pandemic has caused “apprehension to stick your neck out”, while earnings remain a ‘grey area’. Analysts believe that Q2 will mark the low point for corporate earnings, and Q3 will depend on the success of fiscal stimulus going forward. The progress of stocks is likely to hinge on the development of a virus vaccine, and analysts think that if it can be produced in sufficient quantities, it might be a game changer.&nbsp;</p>",

Continuing claims printed its first pandemic fall to 21.05mln (street was looking for 25.75mln against the prior revised 24.9mln) - the latter was taken as a positive signal that gross hiring is beginning to rebound.</li><li><strong>TREND: </strong>Cumulatively, the pandemic has now resulted in over 40mln claims. But Google searches data suggest initial jobless claims data will likely fall next week too, to around 1.8mln, and the current pace suggests that it could fall sub-1mln by the end of June, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.</li><li><strong>CONTINUING CLAIMS:</strong> Pantheon Macroeconomics says the big surprise in the report was the fall in continuing claims (that data is for the week ending 16th May), which the consultancy says suggests that the reopening of states is pushing businesses to rehire some of the people let go when the virus hit. \"The headline number overstates the true extent of the hiring, though, because California requires people to re-file bi-weekly, and this is an off-week,\" it writes, \"California continuing claims fell by 1.4mln, despite the near-total lock down in the state over the period, so we’re discounting this as evidence of an improving labour market.\" There was also an improvement in continuing claims in Florida too (by 1.6mln); \"that’s more plausible, given the reopening of the state, though it’s a much bigger drop than we expected.\" Elsewhere, it says that the remaining 0.9mln aggregate decline was spread around the country.</li><li><strong>BODES WELL FOR NFP: </strong>The continuing claims decline is a key development given that it coincides with the May BLS jobs report survey period, and that could suggest \"that that the drop in payrolls this month will be a bit smaller than implied by the surge in initial claims since the April survey,\" Pantheon writes, \"but the main impact - if continuing claims keep falling, as we expect - will come in the June numbers.\"</li></ul>",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.7%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%)</strong> were choppy with mainland China initially supported after another firm liquidity effort by the PBoC which injected CNY 240bln through 7-Day Reverse Repos. However, the gains were short-lived and Hong Kong markets underperformed due to the ongoing US-China tensions with Trump administration said to be considering suspending Hong Kong's preferential tariff rate for exports to US which means they could face the same tariffs US had imposed on mainland China. Furthermore, Global Times suggested the nuclear option of dumping USD-denominated assets was among the tools for China to exert financial pain on the US and China’s Embassy in US stated that Beijing will take all necessary counter measures for meddling, while the US House passage of the sanctions bill for Uighur human rights abuses and Huawei’s CFO losing a key battle in the extradition case, all added to the ongoing toxic relationship between the world’s top economic powerhouses.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European equities (Eurostoxx 50 +0.9%)</strong> have started the session on the front-foot once again as optimism surrounding reopening efforts across the continent continues to out-muscle concerns over mounting US-China tensions. HK-exposed HSBC (-2.1%) and Standard Chartered (-1.3%) are trading lower following reports that the Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending Hong Kong's preferential US tariff rate for exports to US in response to China’s (now passed) security law. However, this is yet to have any major follow-through to broader sentiment with price action in Europe taking a similar shape to those of recent sessions with travel &amp; leisure names top of the pile once again. Specifically, for the sector, easyJet (+8.5%) are trading higher after announcing that summer demand indications are improving and the Co. is to consult on a proposal to lower its headcount by up to 30%. In sympathy, Deutsche Lufthansa (+4.2%), Ryanair (+2.8%), IAG (+2.3%) are all trading firmer once again. However, it is worth noting that the Stoxx 600 travel &amp; leisure index is still trading lower by around 30% YTD. In-fitting with the theme of optimism surrounding travel names and reports yesterday that Boeing has resumed production at its Renton facility and will gradually ramp up output over the year, supplier Safran are trading higher by 2.8%. Elsewhere, support has been seen for the tech sector with the likes of Dialog Semiconductor (+3.8%), STMicroelectronics (+3.8%) and Infineon (+3.1%) bolstered by US-listed Micron Technology raising its Q3 revenue forecast yesterday. To the downside, Centrica (-3.3%) are a noteworthy laggard with the Times noting that the Co. could be at risk of losing its place in the FTSE 100. The article also noted that Carnival, easyJet, Meggitt, ITV, M&amp;G and Prudential could also face the chop in what could be one of the largest reshuffles since the GFC.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>DXY, Yuan - </strong>Little action thus far in the broader Dollar and index as the latter pivots 99.000 having printed an overnight base at 98.773 and a current high at its 100DMA at 99.034. Tensions between US and China will remain a theme with no apparent signs of subsiding for now – with Hong Kong no longer deemed autonomous from China and Beijing reiterating its readiness to retaliate over interference. USD/CNY traded on the softer side of 7.1530-7.1680 band after the PBoC set a firmer CNY fixing than expected, albeit weaker vs. yesterday. CNH meanwhile remains flat around 7.1450 vs. USD after the pair yesterday threatened a fresh record high at 7.1965.&nbsp; In terms of scheduled events State-side, today’s docket sees US Durable Goods and Q1 GDP (2nd) with the former expected to deteriorate further whilst the latter expects no revisions. Fed’s voter Williams is unlikely to add much meat to the bones following yesterday’s remarks.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD - </strong>All choppy within tight ranges vs. the Buck after earlier sensitivity to the escalating spat between US and China. AUD/USD dipped below 0.6600 despite RBA governor Lowe firmly dismissing negative rate – with some pointing to profit-taking amid trade risk. The pair recovered off lows around 0.6590 vs. high 0.6635. Elsewhere, the RBNZ Financial System Policy chief played down financial stability concerns from negative rates. The Kiwi reversed its earlier move lower but remains sub-0.6200 vs. the Dollar, having had failed to sustain gains above its 100 DMA at the round figure. Meanwhile, the Loonie also tracks softer energy prices with USD/CAD gaining ground above its 100 DMA (1.3709) and eyes a retest of 1.38 to the upside ahead of Q1 Canadian Current account data and stale average weekly earnings for March.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR - </strong>Mixed trade with Cable choppy whilst EUR/USD treads water at 1.1000 following an uneventful start to the session. The Single currency side-lined German regional prelim CPIs - largely followed the expectations for the nationwide release – alongside a mixed EZ sentiment survey. EUR/USD sees EUR 960mln opex at 1.0995-1.1000 with a further EUR 900mln between 1.1020-25 ahead of a Fib level around the 1.1050 psychological level. Saunders did little to change the overall narrative by said it safer to err on the side of easing too much and then tighten if necessary. Meanwhile, the wider focus remains on any hiccups over negotiations both regarding the EU Recovery Fund among EU27 and post-Brexit trade FTA between UK and the EU.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF - </strong>Safe-haven FX trade on the softer side in daily ranges but more so on Dollar influence amid an indecisive risk tone. USD/JPY prods its 50/55 DMAs at 107.84-86 ahead of session highs 107.89 (low 107.67) and with a chunky USD 1.8bln in options expiring at stroke 107.90. USD/CHF oscillates on either side of 0.9700 but within a tight range of 0.9670-9705 relative to yesterday’s trade.</p><p><strong>RBA Governor Lowe</strong> said they will maintain expansionary settings until progress is being made towards employment and we are confident on inflation and said there will be a further decline in employment for May but jobs data was not as bad as previously thought. Lowe also stated that 25bps Cash Rate is effectively as low as it can go and that rates are to stay this low for some years and that they could purchase more government bonds if more QE is needed but does not currently see a need to do so, while he suggested that negative rates are extraordinary unlikely which come with a cost to the financial system and that he doesn't think negative rates will work.

(Newswires)</p><p>New Zealand ANZ Business Confidence (May) -41.8 (Prev. -66.6). (Newswires) New Zealand ANZ Activity Outlook (May) -38.7 (Prev. -55.1)</p><p><strong>FIXED</strong></p><p>Core counterparts are erring towards positive this morning, with <strong>USTs</strong> seemingly dictating price action so far. The mild strength for bonds emanated after the European cash equity open and following updates out of China’s closing Two-Sessions. While such updates have generated upside the magnitude is relatively minimal with <strong>USTs</strong> essentially hovering around the U/C mark at present. Within Europe, it’s a similar picture as Bunds followed their US peer’s lead on these reports but have continued to grind higher since, with gains of around 10 ticks at present and residing at the top-end of the session range. Technically, USTs have little in the way of resistance near-term until 139.22; similarly, for <strong>Bunds</strong> nothing aside from psychological marks resides between their current high at 172.24 and the next technical resistance at 173.16. Within the UK <strong>Gilts </strong>are modestly subdued as we see another bout of duel-supply, with today’s offering of GBP 2.75bln and GBP 2bln in the 2027 &amp; 2049 lines respectively, the first auction was well received albeit with the b/c a shade below the prior. Looking ahead, attention for the session will remain firmly fixated on US-China developments, particularly the response to the formal passing of the HK securities law. Aside from that, we do have the nationwide German CPIs at 13:00BST, with the state metrics drawing little reaction on release and seemingly chime with the newswire expectations; after which, we get remarks from Fed’s Williams who yesterday remarked that YCC is potentially a tool that could contribute to forward guidance.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI July </strong>and<strong> Brent </strong>August futures see a session of modest losses thus far with the contracts meandering just around USD 32.60/bbl and USD 35.50/bbl respectively (vs. low of USD 31.14/bbl and USD 34.35/bbl) with some pointing to sentiment-led losses amid the rising tensions between US and China, whilst a surprise build in Private Inventories (+8.7mln vs. Exp. -1.9mln) only added to the bearish tone. Some downside could be emanating from reports that Russian Co's have been raising concerns regarding maintaining cuts with Energy Minister Novak after softly rejecting an extension of current cuts past June – stating that the market could rebalance sometime between June/July. Elsewhere, <strong>spot gold</strong> sees inflows and investors stock up on the yellow metal ahead of potential US-China tit-for-tat measures. Prices gain a firmer footing above USD 1700/oz and reside around session highs north of USD 1720/oz.</p><p><strong>US Private Inventory Crude Stocks +8.7mln vs. Exp. -1.9mln (Prev. -4.98mln).</strong> (Newswires)</p><p>Kremlin have declined to provide additional remarks on their position on the OPEC+ cuts deal; no change to plans to complete construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline - consider sanctions against this pipeline as unfair competition.

HK-exposed HSBC (-2.1%) and Standard Chartered (-1.3%) are trading lower following reports that the Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending Hong Kong's preferential US tariff rate for exports to US in response to China’s (now passed) security law. However, this is yet to have any major follow-through to broader sentiment with price action in Europe taking a similar shape to those of recent sessions with travel &amp; leisure names top of the pile once again. Specifically, for the sector, easyJet (+8.5%) are trading higher after announcing that summer demand indications are improving and the Co. is to consult on a proposal to lower its headcount by up to 30%. In sympathy, Deutsche Lufthansa (+4.2%), Ryanair (+2.8%), IAG (+2.3%) are all trading firmer once again. However, it is worth noting that the Stoxx 600 travel &amp; leisure index is still trading lower by around 30% YTD. In-fitting with the theme of optimism surrounding travel names and reports yesterday that Boeing has resumed production at its Renton facility and will gradually ramp up output over the year, supplier Safran are trading higher by 2.8%. Elsewhere, support has been seen for the tech sector with the likes of Dialog Semiconductor (+3.8%), STMicroelectronics (+3.8%) and Infineon (+3.1%) bolstered by US-listed Micron Technology raising its Q3 revenue forecast yesterday. To the downside, Centrica (-3.3%) are a noteworthy laggard with the Times noting that the Co. could be at risk of losing its place in the FTSE 100. The article also noted that Carnival, easyJet, Meggitt, ITV, M&amp;G and Prudential could also face the chop in what could be one of the largest reshuffles since the GFC.</p><p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>DXY, Yuan - Little action thus far in the broader Dollar and index as the latter pivots 99.000 having printed an overnight base at 98.773 and a current high at its 100DMA at 99.034. Tensions between US and China will remain a theme with no apparent signs of subsiding for now – with Hong Kong no longer deemed autonomous from China and Beijing reiterating its readiness to retaliate over interference. USD/CNY traded on the softer side of 7.1530-7.1680 band after the PBoC set a firmer CNY fixing than expected, albeit weaker vs. yesterday. CNH meanwhile remains flat around 7.1450 vs. USD after the pair yesterday threatened a fresh record high at 7.1965.&nbsp; In terms of scheduled events State-side, today’s docket sees US Durable Goods and Q1 GDP (2nd) with the former expected to deteriorate further whilst the latter expects no revisions. Fed’s voter Williams is unlikely to add much meat to the bones following yesterday’s remarks.</p><p>AUD, NZD, CAD - All choppy within tight ranges vs. the Buck after earlier sensitivity to the escalating spat between US and China. AUD/USD dipped below 0.6600 despite RBA governor Lowe firmly dismissing negative rate – with some pointing to profit-taking amid trade risk. The pair recovered off lows around 0.6590 vs. high 0.6635. Elsewhere, the RBNZ Financial System Policy chief played down financial stability concerns from negative rates. The Kiwi reversed its earlier move lower but remains sub-0.6200 vs. the Dollar, having had failed to sustain gains above its 100 DMA at the round figure. Meanwhile, the Loonie also tracks softer energy prices with USD/CAD gaining ground above its 100 DMA (1.3709) and eyes a retest of 1.38 to the upside ahead of Q1 Canadian Current account data and stale average weekly earnings for March.</p><p>GBP, EUR - Mixed trade with Cable choppy whilst EUR/USD treads water at 1.1000 following an uneventful start to the session. The Single currency side-lined German regional prelim CPIs - largely followed the expectations for the nationwide release – alongside a mixed EZ sentiment survey. EUR/USD sees EUR 960mln opex at 1.0995-1.1000 with a further EUR 900mln between 1.1020-25 ahead of a Fib level around the 1.1050 psychological level. Saunders did little to change the overall narrative by said it safer to err on the side of easing too much and then tighten if necessary. Meanwhile, the wider focus remains on any hiccups over negotiations both regarding the EU Recovery Fund among EU27 and post-Brexit trade FTA between UK and the EU.</p><p>JPY, CHF - Safe-haven FX trade on the softer side in daily ranges but more so on Dollar influence amid an indecisive risk tone. USD/JPY prods its 50/55 DMAs at 107.84-86 ahead of session highs 107.89 (low 107.67) and with a chunky USD 1.8bln in options expiring at stroke 107.90. USD/CHF oscillates on either side of 0.9700 but within a tight range of 0.9670-9705 relative to yesterday’s trade.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Core</strong> <strong>counterparts</strong> are erring towards positive this morning, with USTs seemingly dictating price action so far. The mild strength for bonds emanated after the European cash equity open and following updates out of China’s closing Two-Sessions event, at which they voted (as expected) to pass the Hong Kong Securities bill – which is likely to prompt a response in some form from the US, and indeed the NY Times reports that the US are expel Chinese students who have connections with military schools. While such rhetoric has generated upside the magnitude is relatively minimal with <strong>USTs</strong> essentially hovering around the U/C mark at present. Within Europe, it’s a similar picture as Bunds followed their US peer’s lead on these reports but have continued to grind higher since, with gains of around 10 ticks at present and residing at the top-end of the session range. Technically, <strong>USTs</strong> have little in the way of resistance near-term until 139.22; similarly, for Bunds nothing aside from psychological marks resides between their current high at 172.24 and the next technical resistance at 173.16. Within the <strong>UK</strong> <strong>Gilts</strong> are modestly subdued as we see another bout of duel-supply, with today’s offering of GBP 2.75bln and GBP 2bln in the 2027 &amp; 2049 lines respectively, the first auction was well received albeit with the b/c a shade below the prior. Looking ahead, attention for the session will remain firmly fixated on US-China developments, particularly the response to the formal passing of the HK securities law. Aside from that, we do have the nationwide German CPIs at 13:00BST, with the state metrics drawing little reaction on release and seemingly chime with the newswire expectations; after which, we get remarks from Fed’s Williams who yesterday remarked that YCC is potentially a tool that could contribute to forward guidance.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> July and <strong>Brent</strong> August futures see a session of modest losses thus far with the contracts meandering just around USD 32.60/bbl and USD 35.50/bbl respectively (vs. low of USD 31.14/bbl and USD 34.35/bbl) with some pointing to sentiment-led losses amid the rising tensions between US and China, whilst a surprise build in Private Inventories (+8.7mln vs. Exp. -1.9mln) only added to the bearish tone. Some downside could be emanating from reports that Russian Co's have been raising concerns regarding maintaining cuts with Energy Minister Novak after softly rejecting an extension of current cuts past June – stating that the market could rebalance sometime between June/July. Elsewhere, spot gold sees inflows and investors stock up on the yellow metal ahead of potential US-China tit-for-tat measures. Prices gain a firmer footing above USD 1700/oz and reside around session highs north of USD 1720/oz.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>SNAPSHOT: </strong>The tone seems mixed; equities are higher in Europe, and US futures were up, though now trade flat, except for NQ which continues to underperform. Treasuries are mixed, though yields are slowly edging lower, as they are in Europe, with parts of the Treasury curve now flattening, having been slightly steeper in Asia. The Dollar Index is flat, EMFX is struggling, as are activity currencies. There has not been any major news flow that shifts the narrative; ahead, we weekly jobless claims, a second look at US Q1 GDP, and some Fedspeak, while being mindful of US/China headline risk. The Sanford C Bernstein conference continues, and we can expect commentary from VZ, UAL, MA, DPZ, USB, HD; Cowen’s TMT Conference will feature commentary from AMAT, QRVO, AKAM, JNPR. In earnings, retailers DLTR, DG and COST report, and in software CRM will report after the bell.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES:</strong> Equities are up in Europe, with Health Care and Tech leading gains (Energy and Financials lag), buoyed by the so-called “rally of hope” (re-openings, recoveries, vaccine, stimulus). US equity futures have continued to print post-Q1-crash highs, despite caution seen in the FX complex due to US/China tensions, though the NQ underperforms again as NTES and JD look to Hong Kong listings before they are pushed (will TCOM and BIDU follow?). In ES, another post-Q1 crash high was seen around yesterday’s cash close time at 3,053.75, stretching the gap between its highly-watched 200dma at just beneath 3,000. We are flat/negative as US players arrive, but the index was ranging between 3,030-3,050 in Asia and early Europe. <strong>KEY LEVELS:</strong> <strong>3397.50</strong> (Feb'20 ATH), <strong>3181</strong> (Jan'20 ytd lo), <strong>3135</strong> (78.6% Feb'20 hi to Mar'20 lo), <strong>3053.75</strong> (May hi), <strong>3038</strong> (FY21 exp. eps &amp; p/e implied), <strong>3035</strong> (FY20 exp. eps &amp; p/e implied), <strong>3032</strong> (level at pixel time),&nbsp;<strong>2999</strong> (200dma), <strong>2993</strong> (5dma), <strong>2982-84</strong> (VAP), <strong>2963-66</strong> (VAP), <strong>2950 </strong>(May'20 analyst&nbsp;end-2020 forecast).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TREASURIES: </strong>Treasuries are tilting into positive territory (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/daily-fed-planned-treasury-purchase-amounts-and-schedules-28th-may-2020-fed-in-the-short-end-today-28-05-2020\">Fed will be in the short-end today</a>), and the bias of the curve is flattening, having been slightly steeper in overnight/early Europe trade. The Treasury will conclude this week’s note issuance with an auction of 7-year at 1300EDT/1800BST (<a href=\"https://newsquawk.com/headlines/preview-us-to-sell-new-2-year-usd-44bln-tue-new-5-year-usd-45bln-wed-and-a-new-7-year-usd-38bln-thu-this-week-25-05-2020\">preview here</a>). In Europe, Bunds are positive after regional German inflation metrics declined in May (the key Saxony region implies we’ll see an unchanged national data out of Germany at 1300BST/0800EDT) while Eurozone sentiment data didn’t rise as much as hoped in May signalling only a tepid rebound; Tsy/Bund spread is accordingly a touch wider on the day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DOLLAR: </strong>The Dollar Index is flat/positive, though moves in major FX have been limited. EMFX is generally lower, and high beta FX is flat/weaker – the AUD is lower despite the RBA suggesting that it might not need additional QE or negative rates given that the economy is performing better than feared. Desks will be watching the 0830EDT for cues, it seems, with a downside bias for the USD if there is a large miss on Q1 GDP (second read).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CRUDE: </strong>Crude futures are mixed, with WTI in the red after bearish private inventory data reported after the close on Tuesday (crude +8.7mln, Cushing draws for the third week at -3.4mln , distillates +6.9mln, gasoline +1.1mln). The DOE’s inventory data will be released at 1100EDT/1600BST, and the consensus looks for crude -1.9mln, distillate +1.8mln, gasoline +0.1mln.</p><p><strong>TODAY’S DATA AT 0830EDT/1330BST:</strong> Analysts expect initial jobless claims to print 2.1mln in the week ending 23rd May (range: 1.25mln to 2.36mln); continuing claims are seen at 25.75mln (range: 25mln to 27.75mln). Additionally, we get the second read of US GDP in Q1; The expectation is for Q1 GDP to print -4.8% annualised (range: -6.0% to -3.8%); the deflator is seen at 1.4%, core PCE in Q1 is seen at 1.8% and PCE prices at 1.3%. NOTE: timelier April PCE data is released on Friday.

The poll – carried out over the last two weeks – also suggests that analysts do not see the index falling back to March lows due to the ‘Fed backstop’ and substantial fiscal stimulus. Nevertheless, it reveals that the uncertainty around the pandemic has caused “apprehension to stick your neck out”, while earnings remain a ‘grey area’. Analysts believe that Q2 will mark the low point for corporate earnings, and Q3 will depend on the success of fiscal stimulus going forward. The progress of stocks is likely to hinge on the development of a virus vaccine, and analysts think that if it can be produced in sufficient quantities, it might be a game changer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA: </strong>The likes of TWTR and FB will be in focus as US President Trump prepares to sign an executive order targeting social media companies. US President Trump has this week threatened to shut down social media that he accused of censoring Conservative voices, after Twitter recently added a feature that adds links to his tweets that claim to fact-check his content. Details are thin about what the order might contain, and it remains unclear on what regulatory steps the administration can take without going through Congress. The order is set to be signed later today.</p><p><strong>RETAIL EARNINGS: </strong>DG and DLTR are before market, COST aftermarket (has already reported comps)<strong> </strong>What may be more useful to traders than the actual numbers for the quarter is commentary about revenue trends, particularly the performance of online segments, and relating to how sales are doing after re-openings, analysts say.</p><p><strong>HONG KONG RISK:</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-hong-kongs-special-status-threatens-chinas-grand-financial-ambitions-11590651979?mod=newsviewer_click\">WSJ highlights</a> the risks around the Hong Kong situation, which investors may be sleeping on, if equity performance is a benchmark to judge. The article explains that US actions against HK might mark the beginning of a financial squeeze on China's international finance operations. It also shows a willingness by the US to continue using the USD system as a tool in foreign policy. Ending HK’s 'special status' risks it facing the same tariffs levied on China, and restricts the export of sensitive US tech to HK. China's banks conduct much of their international business through HK given that Shanghai remains subject to capital controls, and there does not seem to be a viable replacement for HK if it is cut off the USD system. The role of HK as a hub would be diminished if counterparties fear doing business due to sanctions threats, restricting China’s ability to operate financially overseas. In terms of the hub’s banking system, at end-2019, mainland Chinese banks held USD 1.14trln in assets in HK, only a small percentage of China's USD 40trln in total bank assets but larger vs the USD 2.22 trillion that the Chinese banks extend to borrowers outside the mainland. The WSJ says \"US has demonstrated its extensive reach over the dollar system, with penalties against Korean, French and Lebanese financiers for dealing with sanctioned parties,\" noting that the US recently threaten Iraq’s access to the NY Fed, showing a growing willingness to use financial infrastructure as a foreign policy stick. In terms of the consequences for China, its 'Belt and Road' initiative is largely dollar denominated, and the US moves may also put heavily indebted property developers at risk. Longer-term, it would diminish China's hopes of an international currency, which relies on HK's role as a financial centre, given 70% of international trade in the yuan is done in via the city.</p>",

The mild strength for bonds emanated after the European cash equity open and following updates out of China’s closing Two-Sessions event, at which they voted (as expected) to pass the Hong Kong Securities bill – which is likely to prompt a response in some form from the US, and indeed the NY Times reports that the US are expel Chinese students who have connections with military schools. While such rhetoric has generated upside the magnitude is relatively minimal with USTs essentially hovering around the U/C mark at present. Within Europe, it’s a similar picture as Bunds followed their US peer’s lead on these reports but have continued to grind higher since, with gains of around 10 ticks at present and residing at the top-end of the session range. Technically, USTs have little in the way of resistance near-term until 139.22; similarly, for Bunds nothing aside from psychological marks resides between their current high at 172.24 and the next technical resistance at 173.16. Within the UK Gilts are modestly subdued as we see another bout of duel-supply, with today’s offering of GBP 2.75bln and GBP 2bln in the 2027 &amp; 2049 lines respectively, the first auction was well received albeit with the b/c a shade below the prior. Looking ahead, attention for the session will remain firmly fixated on US-China developments, particularly the response to the formal passing of the HK securities law. Aside from that, we do have the nationwide German CPIs at 13:00BST, with the state metrics drawing little reaction on release and seemingly chime with the newswire expectations; after which, we get remarks from Fed’s Williams who yesterday remarked that YCC is potentially a tool that could contribute to forward guidance.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY, Yuan</strong></p><p>Little action thus far in the broader Dollar and index as the latter pivots 99.000 having printed an overnight base at 98.773 and a current high at its 100DMA at 99.034. Tensions between US and China will remain a theme with no apparent signs of subsiding for now – with Hong Kong no longer deemed autonomous from China and Beijing reiterating its readiness to retaliate over interference. USD/CNY traded on the softer side of 7.1530-7.1680 band after the PBoC set a firmer CNY fixing than expected, albeit weaker vs. yesterday. CNH meanwhile remains flat around 7.1450 vs. USD after the pair yesterday threatened a fresh record high at 7.1965. In terms of scheduled events State-side, today’s docket sees US Durable Goods and Q1 GDP (2nd) with the former expected to deteriorate further whilst the latter expects no revisions. Fed’s voter Williams is unlikely to add much meat to the bones following yesterday’s remarks.</p><p><strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong></p><p>All choppy within tight ranges vs. the Buck after earlier sensitivity to the escalating spat between US and China. AUD/USD dipped below 0.6600 despite RBA governor Lowe firmly dismissing negative rate – with some pointing to profit-taking amid trade risk. The pair recovered off lows around 0.6590 vs. high 0.6635. Elsewhere, the RBNZ Financial System Policy chief played down financial stability concerns from negative rates. The Kiwi reversed its earlier move lower but remains sub-0.6200 vs. the Dollar, having had failed to sustain gains above its 100 DMA at the round figure. Meanwhile, the Loonie also tracks softer energy prices with USD/CAD gaining ground above its 100 DMA (1.3709) and eyes a retest of 1.38 to the upside ahead of Q1 Canadian Current account data and stale average weekly earnings for March.</p><p><strong>GBP, EUR</strong></p><p>Mixed trade with Cable now eyeing 1.2275 to the upside whilst EUR/USD treads water at 1.1000 following an uneventful start to the session. The Single currency side-lined German regional prelim CPIs - largely followed the expectations for the nationwide release – alongside a mixed EZ sentiment survey. EUR/USD sees EUR 960mln opex at 1.0995-1.1000 with a further EUR 900mln between 1.1020-25 ahead of a Fib level around the 1.1050 psychological level. Looking ahead to the session, BoE’s Saunders is slated to speak on the economic impacts of the pandemic and policy implications in a text release with traders on the watch for negative-rates references. Meanwhile, the wider focus remains on any hiccups over negotiations both regarding the EU Recovery Fund among EU27 and post-Brexit trade FTA between UK and the EU.</p><p><strong>JPY, CHF</strong></p><p>Safe-haven FX trade on the softer side in daily ranges but more so on Dollar influence amid an indecisive risk tone. USD/JPY prods its 50/55 DMAs at 107.84-86 ahead of session highs 107.89 (low 107.67) and with a chunky USD 1.8bln in options expiring at stroke 107.90. USD/CHF oscillates on either side of 0.9700 but within a tight range of 0.9670-9705 relative to yesterday’s trade.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>US INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Analysts expect initial jobless claims to print 2.1mln in the week ending 23rd May (range: 1.25mln to 2.36mln); continuing claims are seen rising to 25.75mln (range: 25mln to 27.75mln). Last week, initial jobless claims printed lower for the seventh straight week, but was again slightly above consensus. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that the week-to-week rate of fall in claims has slowed, to around -9% from -21% in the second week after the late March peak. The consultancy's analysis of Google search data and hard numbers from Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona leads them to forecast claims dipping to around 2.15mln, slightly above consensus. It believes that at this pace, claims won’t drop below the 1mln mark until mid-August, though re-openings might trigger a faster decline. Pantheon also notes that total excess initial claims – which strips-out the pre-COVID19 level, around 215K per week – since the crisis began now stand at 36.8mln, but the continuing claims numbers are, however, chaotic. “For example, last week’s number is now put at just 171k, even though initial claims in the previous week were 3.9mln; the key point here is that the trend is rising strongly, signaling that most of the people who have been laid off due to COVID remain unemployed.”</p><p><strong>US Q1 GDP (Second Estimate): </strong>The expectation is for Q1 GDP to print -4.8% annualised (range: -6.0% to -3.8%); the deflator is seen at 1.4%, core PCE in Q1 is seen at 1.8% and PCE prices at 1.3%. (NOTE: Friday sees the release of the more timely PCE data for April). ING warns that although the data is for Q1, any large downside revision could hit the dollar. \"Were it not for the mixed global environment, we be expecting DXY to break below 98.65/80 on the better EUR news. But today may not be the best day for that,\" the bank writes.</p>",

ASX 200 (+1.4%) was higher with the top weighted financials sector leading the broad gains in the index although energy lagged following a pullback in oil prices which was exacerbated by bearish inventory data, while Nikkei 225 (+1.5%) benefitted from favourable currency moves and the KOSPI (+0.4%) failed to stay afloat despite the BoK delivering a widely expected 25bps rate cut to bring the 7-Day Repo Rate to 0.50%. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) were choppy with mainland China initially supported after another firm liquidity effort by the PBoC which injected CNY 240bln through 7-Day Reverse Repos. However, the gains were short-lived and Hong Kong markets underperformed due to the ongoing US-China tensions with Trump administration said to be considering suspending Hong Kong's preferential tariff rate for exports to US which means they could face the same tariffs US had imposed on mainland China. Furthermore, Global Times suggested the nuclear option of dumping USD-denominated assets was among the tools for China to exert financial pain on the US and China’s Embassy in US stated that Beijing will take all necessary counter measures for meddling, while the US House passage of the sanctions bill for Uighur human rights abuses and Huawei’s CFO losing a key battle in the extradition case, all added to the ongoing toxic relationship between the world’s top economic powerhouses.</p><p><strong>FTSE 100</strong></p><p><strong>Hikma Pharmaceuticals (HIK LN) – US FDA has approved Co’s dicyclomine hydrochloride.

However, the gains were short-lived and Hong Kong markets underperformed due to the ongoing US-China tensions with Trump administration said to be considering suspending Hong Kong's preferential tariff rate for exports to US which means they could face the same tariffs US had imposed on mainland China. Furthermore, Global Times suggested the nuclear option of dumping USD-denominated assets was among the tools for China to exert financial pain on the US and China’s Embassy in US stated that Beijing will take all necessary counter measures for meddling, while the US House passage of the sanctions bill for Uighur human rights abuses and Huawei’s CFO losing a key battle in the extradition case, all added to the ongoing toxic relationship between the world’s top economic powerhouses.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>US President Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending Hong Kong's preferential US tariff rate for exports to US in response to China's planned security law, according to sources.</strong> Furthermore, the report noted that this preferential tariff rate suspension could put the same tariffs on Hong Kong which the US has already imposed on mainland China.&nbsp; (Newswires)</p><p><strong>US House passed bill calling for sanctions on Chinese officials related to the crackdown on Uighur minorities as expected</strong> with the final vote count at 413-1, which sends the bill to US President Trump for signing.

The Chinese Embassy also said it is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes the Canadian court's decision on the Huawei CFO, while it added that Canada is an accomplice to the US efforts to harm Huawei and Chinese tech, as well as urged for the immediate release of the CFO.

(The Times/Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX markets, the early constructive risk tone weighed on the <strong>DXY</strong> which briefly extended its retreat below the 99.00 level and with the increasing US-China tensions also doing no favours for both countries’ respective currencies which saw the CNH weaken to a fresh record low. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was kept uplifted from the EUR 750bln economic recovery proposal which had boosted the single currency to above 1.1000. <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was less inspired due to Brexit&nbsp; pessimism from both sides of the Channel after UK Brexit Negotiator Frost stated the mandate in key areas is not likely to reach an agreement and the French Foreign Minister suggested discussions are going badly with deep differences remaining. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses have largely reflected the indecisive risk appetite in stocks, while antipodean currencies were initially steady as their exposure to China and recent CNY weakness is offset by their high beta statuses and after RBA Governor Lowe continued to firmly dismiss negative rates, but then dipped in late trade as the risk tone began to sour.</p><p><strong>RBA Governor Lowe</strong> said they will maintain expansionary settings until progress is being made towards employment and we are confident on inflation and said there will be a further decline in employment for May but jobs data was not as bad as previously thought. Lowe also stated that 25bps Cash Rate is effectively as low as it can go and that rates are to stay this low for some years and that they could purchase more government bonds if more QE is needed but does not currently see a need to do so, while he suggested that negative rates are extraordinary unlikely which come with a cost to the financial system and that he doesn't think negative rates will work.

(Newswires)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>US</strong></p><p>Treasuries pared some of Tuesday’s weakness as risk appetite came under pressure from amplified China/Hong Kong tensions, although supply likely provided some resistance. Overnight the TPLEX had been choppy, although as equities moved to the downside, the curve bull flattened and held onto its bid despite equities reversing their weakness into the afternoon. However, in the context of Tuesday’s chunky bear-steepening, perhaps participants were cautious to let rates back up any further, particularly with growing Fed talk of YCC. Meanwhile, supply continued on Wednesday as the Treasury sold its new 5-year Notes at the upsized USD 45bln amount, which did not go so smoothly, tailing the 0.321% WI by 1.2bps, while the 2.28x cover ratio was less than both the average and the prior, while dealers took a larger share than average versus the previous. Note, that due to the roll period, the September (Q) T-Note contract now has the largest open interest. T-note (M0) futures settled 5 ticks higher at 138-27.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fed's Beige Book said economic activity declined in all districts, falling sharply in most, reflecting disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, while it stated that consumer spending fell further as mandated closures of retail establishments remained largely in place during most of the survey period and declines were especially severe in the leisure and hospitality sector with very little activity at travel and tourism businesses. Beige Book added that employment continued to decrease in all districts with steep losses in most districts as social distancing and business closures affected employment at many firms. Furthermore, it noted pricing pressures varied but were steady to down modestly on balance and weak demand weighed on selling prices. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>Fed's Bullard (dove, non-voter)</strong> said he does not think this is the time to think about balance sheet reductions and will not be entertaining rate rises until the medium-term. Bullard also stated that YCC would not have much impact at this moment with long-term interest rates this low, while he favours forward guidance based on the state of the economy and not the calendar. (Newswires)</p><p>Boston Fed released loan participation forms for lenders interested in the main street lending program. (Newswires)</p><p>US President Trump tweets big tech is doing everything to censor in advance of the 2020 election and if that happens, we no longer have our freedom, while ha will never let it happen and suggested to stay tuned, There were also comments from the White House that President Trump will sign an executive order shortly regarding social media companies today.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly positive as the region takes impetus from the positive performance on Wall St where ongoing reopening efforts and a continued resurgence of cyclicals helped shrug off early jitters from China-related concerns. ASX 200 (+1.9%) is higher with the top weighted financials sector leading the broad gains in the index although energy lags following a pullback in oil prices which was exacerbated by bearish inventory data, while Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) benefits from favourable currency moves and the KOSPI (+0.4%) marginally gained after the BoK delivered a widely expected 25bps rate cut to bring the 7-Day Repo Rate to 0.50%. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) are mixed with mainland China kept afloat after another firm liquidity effort by the PBoC which injected CNY 240bln through 7-Day Reverse Repos. However, gains are limited and Hong Kong markets underperform due to the ongoing US-China tensions as the Trump administration are said to be considering suspending Hong Kong's preferential tariff rate for exports to US which means they could face the same tariffs US had imposed on mainland China. Furthermore, Global Times suggested the nuclear option of dumping USD-denominated assets was among the tools for China to exert financial pain on the US and China’s Embassy in US stated that Beijing will take all necessary counter measures for meddling, while the US House passage of the sanctions bill for Uighur human rights abuses and Huawei’s CFO losing a key battle in the extradition case, all adds to the ongoing toxic relationship between the world’s top economic powerhouses.</p><p>In FX markets, the mostly constructive risk tone has weighed on the DXY which extends its retreat below the 99.00 level and with the increasing US-China tensions also doing no favours for both countries’ respective currencies which saw the CNH weaken to a fresh record low. EUR/USD remains uplifted from the EUR 750bln economic recovery proposal which had boosted the single currency to above 1.1000, although GBP/USD is less inspired due to Brexit pessimism from both sides of the Channel after UK Brexit Negotiator Frost stated the mandate in key areas is not likely to reach an agreement and the French Foreign Minister suggested discussions are going badly with deep differences remaining. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses have largely reflected the upbeat risk appetite in stocks, while antipodean currencies are steady as their exposure to China and recent CNY weakness is offset by their high beta statuses and after RBA Governor Lowe continued to firmly dismiss negative rates.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid similar uneventful after-hours trade in T-notes with demand dampened by gains in stocks and as participants look ahead to the 2yr JGB auction results.</p>",

Huawei later stated it is disappointed by the Canadian Court ruling against CFO Meng Wanzhou's bid to avoid extradition but expects the judicial system in Canada will ultimately prove innocence. The Chinese Embassy also said it is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes the Canadian court's decision on the Huawei CFO, while it added that Canada is an accomplice to the US' efforts to harm Huawei and Chinese tech, as well as urged for the immediate release of the CFO.

Furthermore, the report noted that this preferential tariff rate suspension could put the same tariffs on Hong Kong which the US has already imposed on mainland China.&nbsp; (Newswires)</p><p>US Secretary of State Pompeo said he has certified to congress that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous from China and does not continue to warrant treatment under US laws in the same manner as US laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997. (Newswires)</p><p>China Embassy in US reiterated Hong Kong affairs are internal, while it added that US Security legislation is very narrow and that China will take all necessary counter measures for meddling. Furthermore, it stated that China legislature will vote on security bill today and the law would allow China to establish security bases in Hong Kong to provide stability as per the Basic Law approved between China and Hong Kong.
