After making the improved offer, Occidental (OXY) shares fell but Anadarko (APC) gained, its share price opening significantly higher. ExxonMobil (XOM) moved lower on the back of reports that the energy co. would invest nearly USD 1bln expanding its UK refinery. Boeing (BA) moved higher despite earnings missing analyst expectations, with some analysts citing relief at the lack of bad news regarding guidance. Caterpillar (CAT) opened lower despite earnings beating expectations, after negative CFO comments regarding the construction equipment maker’s outlook in China. eBay (EBAY) held on to pre-market gains on the back of earnings that beat analyst expectations on. Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) fell after the world’s largest audio entertainment company reported a large drop in Q1 profits due to its acquisition of Pandora Media. PG&amp;E (PCG) shares moved higher on reports that BRK.B was mulling a buyout, despite CEO Warren Buffet denying the claims. Norfolk Southern (NSC) caught a tailwind after the railroad co. beat bottom line earnings expectations. Northrop Grumman (NOC) opened lower despite the defence contractor posting profits that beat expectations, as sales missed estimates. Texas Instruments (TXN) shares moved higher after the semiconductor maker beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The Healthcare Facilities sector (DVA, HCA, UHS) outperformed on US proposal raising the 2020 reimbursement rate for inpatient services by 3.5%. SPX -0.2% at 2927, NDX -0.3% at 7784, DJI -0.2% at 26599.</p><p>Treasuries rallied on Wednesday, stoked by a soft Aussie CPI report overnight, while there was chatter that some of the buying was a result of real money accounts adding longs ahead of Japan’s Golden Week holiday. Weak IFO helped the complex. A large block buy in the five year space helped the rally continue in US hours, though the T-Note has been horizontal since late morning trade. The 5-year auction was decent, stopping on the screws (as did yesterday’s sale of 2s), though today’s auction internals were far more encouraging, with indirect participation rising, and cover slightly higher. The US Treasury will top off the week’s supply tomorrow with a sale of 7s: analysts at Societe Generale say the 7-year sector appears fair versus 5s and 10s, and is also trading fair in asset swap versus older 5s. The bank also notes that the WI for the 7-year yield trades above the previous stop-out rate, which is a positive for the auction. Additionally, dealer positioning seems elevated in the sector (highest in four weeks) and that could be a negative going into the auction. SocGen itself holds a neutral bias. At settlement, major curve spreads were relatively unchanged. US T-note futures (M9) settled 13 ticks higher at 123-17.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP SHOT: </strong>Equities down, dollar up, Treasuries up, crude mixed</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> BoC holds rates and drops hiking bias; PM May survives a new leadership-challenge; crude inventories build larger than expected; Occidental sparks bidding war for Anadarko; earnings from Boeing</p><p><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>US Durable Goods &amp; Initial Jobless Claims; New Zealand Trade Balance; BoJ Rate Decision &amp; Press Conference; Riksbank Rate Decision &amp; Press Conference; ECB’s de Guindos Speaking; Supply from the US; Earnings from: Bristol-Myers Squib, 3M, Intel, Southwest Airlines, Amazon, UPS, Ford, Bayer, Barclays, UBS.</p><p><strong>* BOC: </strong>The BOC held rates at 1.75%, as expected; the central bank dropped its 'hiking bias' from its policy statement, while also cutting near-term growth forecasts, as well as revising down its estimate of the neutral rate by 25bps to both ends of the range (to 2.25% to 3.25%), and revised down its estimate of the output gap by the same magnitude (to -1.25 to -0.25%). The market reacted dovishly to the release, seeing USDCAD rise to 1.3570 from around 1.3445 before the decision. \"By dropping any reference to future rate hikes today, the Bank delivered its most dovish policy signal in two years,\" Capital Economics said. \"While the Bank remains optimistic about economic prospects in the second half of the year, we think that its forecasts for growth to rebound to above Canada’s potential will prove too optimistic.\" However, that view isn't the consensus. \"Markets are now fully pricing a rate cut over the next year, but we think there is scope for some more upbeat news as we enter the second half of the year,\" ING says, \"like everywhere else, a lot hinges on the direction of US-China trade talks, but the domestic outlook should find support from the underlying strength in the jobs market and some better news on wage growth. Housing-related activity may also receive a boost later in the year as some measures from the Federal budget begin to kick in.\" ING also notes that the BOC continues to describe its current stance as \"accommodative\", and ING says that suggests the committee is less convinced than the market that rate cuts are on the horizon. \"That said, we don't expect a rate hike over the course of 2019 either, and while the overall policy bias in the medium-term may be slightly tilted in favour of some further tightening, this is unlikely to materialise unless global economic sentiment begins to noticeably rebound,\" ING adds.</p><p><strong>* TRADE / GEOPOLITICAL: </strong>On the US-China trade front, reports from Xinhua suggested that China will improve its IP rights protection, one of the key demands from the US. President Trump reiterated that the US was doing well on trade talks with China, and also commented on other fronts, including Mexico, where he tweeted that the US was now sending armed soldiers to the US-Mexico border, and that Mexico is not doing enough in apprehending and returning. The ongoing Libyan conflict was another talking point for Trump, where reports suggested he supports the Haftar-led Eastern forces’ attack on the Western forces, who hold the city of Tripoli. Elsewhere, it was reported on Wednesday that a French warship passed through the Taiwan Strait earlier in the month, an uncommon occurrence from a European nation which could lead to other US allies asserting their freedom of navigation in waterways near China, something that the US is likely to endorse and conversely a move that will rise tensions with China, evident from the same reports that told France had been uninvited to a Chinese naval parade celebrating 70 years since the founding of China’s Navy.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>As UK lawmakers return from their Easter breaks, the government’s cross-party talks with opposition Labour party appear to be deteriorating, with reports suggesting that the talks were close to “collapsing”. PM May is also reported to be preparing to challenge Labour to support her Brexit bill ahead of European Parliament elections on the condition that cross-party discussions do indeed fail; May is also considering introducing a bill that would give effect to the withdrawal agreement (WA) within weeks which could effectively decouple the WA from the plan for a future relationship and bypass the meaningful vote on the agreement which had already failed to pass the Commons on three occasions. Elsewhere on Wednesday, May also faced some renewed leadership pressure, where the Brexiteer 1922 Committee voted on a rule change which would make way for a vote of no-confidence within weeks, following the recent one which failed, where current Tory rules permit one vote of no-confidence per leader per year. May emerged victorious as the rule change failed to gain the votes needed, however the 1922 committee has made it clear they want a more details from the PM on when she will step down.</p><p><strong>* WTI (K9) SETTLES USD AT USD /BBL; BRENT (M9) SETTLES USD AT USD /BBL. </strong>The rally's momentum was halted after API data showed a larger than expected build, which was confirmed in the official DoE inventory release on Wednesday. DOE reported crude stocks built by 5.5mln bbls, a chunky beat on the expected +1.3mln bbl; gasoline stocks once again drew larger than expected at -2.1mln bbls; distillates drew less than expected at -0.7mln bbls; Cushing built by 0.5mln bbls. US crude production rose up back to record highs at 12.2mln BPD. The arguably bearish report saw the crude complex take a leg lower. In other supply news flow, Nigeria’s Oil Minister Kachikwu said the country is producing around 1.79mln BDP (Prev. 1.85mln BPD), and that there will be OPEC+ output quotas after June, with OPEC likely to reduce cuts from June. Kachikwu said he backs a 6 month extension to the supply cuts deal; adding that oil prices that are too high were not in producer interests, instead preferring crude in a range between USD 65-75 per barrel. With Iranian crude exports being removed from the market, attention will focus more towards OPEC+ strategy, with the key question being OPEC's response. ING argues that there are risks that demand destruction (given the high oil price and strong USD) may result in production cuts not being extended at the June OPEC meeting, which in turn limits upside to oil. ING says that this means that the oil price should be averaging around USD 70/bbl this year, still suggesting a supportive environment for oil exporting FX such as MXN. Additionally, given that the Saudis have cut production by 1.2mln BPD since the start of the OPEC+ supply cut agreement, and the US actions against Iran could see 0.8mln BPD of Iranian exports removed from the market, it appears that spare capacity might exist to offset the Iran gap, although how quickly producers can ramp up production remains to be seen. \"I'd expect that OPEC will continue to favour policy designed to defend a reasonable oil price, and it will be important for the group to show it can manage an orderly, gradual increase in production and resist a rush to reverse cuts,\" UBS said, \"Russia, which has been slow to comply with its quota under the agreement, will likely be the first to slip, but the oil price probably won’t come under much pressure unless there is evidence of core OPEC producers (Saudi, UAE, Iraq) demonstrating a lack of discipline.\"</p><p><strong>* SPX -0.2% at 2927, NDX -0.3% at 7784, DJI -0.2% at 26599.

After making the improved offer, Occidental (OXY) shares fell but Anadarko (APC) gained, its share price opening significantly higher. ExxonMobil (XOM) moved lower on the back of reports that the energy co. would invest nearly USD 1bln expanding its UK refinery. Boeing (BA) moved higher despite earnings missing analyst expectations, with some analysts citing relief at the lack of bad news regarding guidance. Caterpillar (CAT) opened lower despite earnings beating expectations, after negative CFO comments regarding the construction equipment maker’s outlook in China. eBay (EBAY) held on to pre-market gains on the back of earnings that beat analyst expectations on. Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) fell after the world’s largest audio entertainment company reported a large drop in Q1 profits due to its acquisition of Pandora Media. PG&amp;E (PCG) shares moved higher on reports that BRK.B was mulling a buyout, despite CEO Warren Buffet denying the claims. Norfolk Southern (NSC) caught a tailwind after the railroad co. beat bottom line earnings expectations. Northrop Grumman (NOC) opened lower despite the defence contractor posting profits that beat expectations, as sales missed estimates. Texas Instruments (TXN) shares moved higher after the semiconductor maker beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The Healthcare Facilities sector (DVA, HCA, UHS) outperformed on US proposal raising the 2020 reimbursement rate for inpatient services by 3.5%.Hi</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 13 TICKS HIGHER AT 123-17.</strong> Treasuries rallied on Wednesday, stoked by a soft Aussie CPI report overnight, while there was chatter that some of the buying was a result of real money accounts adding longs ahead of Japan’s Golden Week holiday. Weak IFO helped the complex. A large block buy in the five year space helped the rally continue in US hours, though the T-Note has been horizontal since late morning trade. The 5-year auction was decent, stopping on the screws (as did yesterday’s sale of 2s), though today’s auction internals were far more encouraging, with indirect participation rising, and cover slightly higher. The US Treasury will top off the week’s supply tomorrow with a sale of 7s: analysts at Societe Generale say the 7-year sector appears fair versus 5s and 10s, and is also trading fair in asset swap versus older 5s. The bank also notes that the WI for the 7-year yield trades above the previous stop-out rate, which is a positive for the auction. Additionally, dealer positioning seems elevated in the sector (highest in four weeks) and that could be a negative going into the auction. SocGen itself holds a neutral bias. At settlement, major curve spreads were relatively unchanged.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> It was another day the USD reigned supreme, with the DXY now having a 98-handle, rising to the highest since Q2 2017. The buck was helped along early doors by the EUR weakness (which eventually saw a new YTD low) following a soft IFO report, which reiterated the message that German manufacturing is in a bit of bother, inspired by global events; the domestic focussed metrics were more encouraging. Woes on the Italian front, where the bund/BTP spread is back in focus ahead of S&amp;P’s rating review on Italy this Friday, are also adding to the downside. Stocks struggling to add to record highs also added to the USD appeal. Ahead of the upcoming market holidays in Japan, the JPY finally budged from the 112.00 handle, rising in later trade towards 112.50 (but didn’t quite make that mark), squeezing shorts ahead of the break; there is also the BOJ policy meeting overnight and while no major shift is expected to policy, the recent dovish manoeuvres of major central banks raises risks the Japanese might follow suit. And on the subject of central banks, the USDCAD rose to highs above 1.35 after the BOC dropped its hiking bias. The Aussie continued to get hit in Euro and US trade, after a weak CPI report overnight added to arguments that the RBA would ease policy in one of its upcoming meetings.</p>",

Weak IFO helped the complex. A large block buy in the five year space helped the rally continue in US hours, though the T-Note has been horizontal since late morning trade. The 5-year auction was decent, stopping on the screws (as did yesterday’s sale of 2s), though today’s auction internals were far more encouraging, with indirect participation rising, and cover slightly higher. The US Treasury will top off the week’s supply tomorrow with a sale of 7s: analysts at Societe Generale say the 7-year sector appears fair versus 5s and 10s, and is also trading fair in asset swap versus older 5s. The bank also notes that the WI for the 7-year yield trades above the previous stop-out rate, which is a positive for the auction. Additionally, dealer positioning seems elevated in the sector (highest in four weeks) and that could be a negative going into the auction. SocGen itself holds a neutral bias. At settlement, major curve spreads were relatively unchanged.</p>",

The buck was helped along early doors by the EUR weakness (which eventually saw a new YTD low) following a soft IFO report, which reiterated the message that German manufacturing is in a bit of bother, inspired by global events; the domestic-focused metrics were more encouraging. Woes on the Italian front, where the Bund/BTP spread is back in focus ahead of S&amp;P’s rating review on Italy this Friday, are also adding to the downside. Stocks struggling to add to record highs also added to the USD appeal. Ahead of the upcoming market holidays in Japan, the JPY finally budged from the 112.00 handle, rising in later trade towards 112.50 (but didn’t quite make that mark), squeezing shorts ahead of the break; there is also the BOJ policy meeting overnight to contend with, and while no major shift is expected to policy, the recent dovish manoeuvres of major central banks raises risks the Japanese might follow suit. And on the subject of central banks, the USDCAD rose to highs above 1.35 after the BOC dropped its hiking bias. The Aussie continued to get hit in Euro and US trade, after a weak CPI report overnight added to arguments that the RBA would ease policy in one of its upcoming meetings.</p>",

DOE reported crude stocks built by 5.5mln bbls, a chunky beat on the expected +1.3mln bbl; gasoline stocks once again drew larger than expected at -2.1mln bbls; distillates drew less than expected at -0.7mln bbls; Cushing built by 0.5mln bbls. US crude production rose up back to record highs at 12.2mln BPD. The arguably bearish report saw the crude complex take a leg lower. In other supply news flow, Nigeria’s Oil Minister Kachikwu said the country is producing around 1.79mln BDP (Prev. 1.85mln BPD), and that there will be OPEC+ output quotas after June, with OPEC likely to reduce cuts from June. Kachikwu said he backs a 6 month extension to the supply cuts deal; adding that oil prices that are too high were not in producer interests, instead preferring crude in a range between USD 65-75 per barrel. With Iranian crude exports being removed from the market, attention will focus more towards OPEC+ strategy, with the key question being OPEC's response. ING argues that there are risks that demand destruction (given the high oil price and strong USD) may result in production cuts not being extended at the June OPEC meeting, which in turn limits upside to oil. ING says that this means that the oil price should be averaging around USD 70/bbl this year, still suggesting a supportive environment for oil exporting FX such as MXN. Additionally, given that the Saudis have cut production by 1.2mln BPD since the start of the OPEC+ supply cut agreement, and the US actions against Iran could see 0.8mln BPD of Iranian exports removed from the market, it appears that spare capacity might exist to offset the Iran gap, although how quickly producers can ramp up production remains to be seen. \"I'd expect that OPEC will continue to favour policy designed to defend a reasonable oil price, and it will be important for the group to show it can manage an orderly, gradual increase in production and resist a rush to reverse cuts,\" UBS said, \"Russia, which has been slow to comply with its quota under the agreement, will likely be the first to slip, but the oil price probably won’t come under much pressure unless there is evidence of core OPEC producers (Saudi, UAE, Iraq) demonstrating a lack of discipline.\"</p>",

The Fed will allow USD 29.8bln to run off its balance sheet at month-end, and will add on a modest USD 0.6bln to 2s and 5s, USD 0.5bln to 7s, and USD 0.3bln to the FRNs.</p><p><strong>* 5-YEAR AUCTION:</strong>&nbsp;The 5-year sector is set up ahead of Wednesday's auction, and trades cheap on the curve compared with 2s and 10s, SocGen notes; it also trades cheap in asset swap versus older 5s. \"While the dealer holdings of the 3-6y sector are the highest since December 2018, the current 5y benchmark trading special on repo (indicating a short base) is likely to help in the takedown of the auction,\" the bank says. It also notes that at pixel time, the WI trades above the stop-out rate of the previous auction, which could be supportive, and SocGen generally holds a positive bias going into the auction.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/eb541041-9abd-49dd-baed-e8668476846f.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>After some consolidation and relative stability in certain currency counterparts around key technical, psychological and significant levels (ie ytd and/or recent lows), the index nudged up to a new 2019 apex and nearer Fib resistance at 97.873, with Aussie weakness providing initial momentum following sub-forecast inflation data before other G10s extended losses vs the Greenback.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p><p>As noted, Aud/Usd front-ran the latest round of broad declines in the major pairings (or advances where applicable), as the Q1 CPI report confounded already benign expectations with even softer prints. RBA easing probabilities subsequently shot up with a clear majority now looking for a 25 bp reduction as soon as next month and Aud/Usd slumped over 75 pips in response before paring some losses ahead of 0.7000. However, after a rebound was capped by offers around 0.7050 another downturn threatens to test supports just a whisker above the big figure, as Nzd/Usd extends its knock-on losses towards 0.6600 awaiting NZ trade data for some independent Kiwi impetus. Similarly, the Loonie racked up heavier losses vs its US counterpart as the crude price rally stalled, but more recently on a semi-surprise shift from the BoC to neutral policy mode from a tightening bias previously. Specifically, the Bank removed the phrase flagging rate hikes and now deems it necessary to maintain accommodation with justification via the MPR’s lower Q1/end 2019 GDP and CPI forecasts. Usd/Cad rallied from circa 1.3442 to 1.3521, just surpassing the 67 pip break-even indicated by the FX options market, but not quite reaching the next upside technical objective at 1.3524 (76.4% Fib retracement of the move from 1.3665 to 1.3069).</p><p><strong>NOK/EUR</strong></p><p>The next biggest G10 losers, as the aforementioned pause in oil on big builds in US stocks and pledges to counter the end of Iran waivers pulled the Norwegian Krona down to 9.6330+ vs the single currency that lost out elsewhere in wake of more disappointing German macro news in the shape of a downbeat Ifo survey, and perhaps a weak Belgian LEI to some degree. Indeed, Eur/Usd slipped through 1.1200, yesterday’s 1.1192 low and Fib support around 1.1187 but held a handful of pips above the 1.1177 ytd low and managed to pare some downside as the Greenback ran out of some steam in general. However, Eur/<strong>CHF</strong> has recoiled further from recent peaks to sub-1.1400, as the Franc outperforms vs the Usd amidst a firmer rebound to 1.0170.</p><p><strong>GBP/JPY</strong></p><p>Also holding up relatively well against the broadly strong Usd, as Cable recovered more ground to revisit the 200 DMA (1.2965) vs a low not far from Fib support (1.2911) and with some fundamental encouragement drawn from reports that the influential 1922 Committee will not back a change to Tory Party leadership rules that would make it easier to oust UK PM May. Similarly, the Yen defended support at 112.00 and is now looking towards the BoJ to see if the Japanese Central Bank keeps the global procession towards more dovish or less hawkish leanings going – full preview on the Ransquawk Research Suite.</p>",

Sectors are similarly mixed, with Energy names underperforming in line with the oil complex’s positive momentum dissipating after the larger than expected API build. Also performing poorly is the auto sector, following Nissan cutting their FY guidance; which has weighed particularly heavily on Renault (-3.8%), with other auto names such as BMW (-0.8%) and Volkswagen (-1.0%) down in sympathy. Conversely, the Technology sector is significantly outperforming its peers led by the strong performance in sector heavyweight SAP (+6.8%) who represents 26% of the sector after the Co. reported strong earnings and raised 2019 operating profit guidance; subsequently, Co. shares have this morning printed a record high of EUR 109.3. Other notable movers this morning include Credit Suisse (+3.0%) and Novartis (+2.7%) following earnings with the SMI (+0.4%) outperforming on the back of this. In addition, Novartis strong performance, following the Co. raising guidance in-spite of the Q1 sales miss, has caused the Healthcare sector to perform strongly.

(Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD -</strong> The Aussie has sharply extended losses in wake of weaker than expected Q1 CPI metrics overnight that have raised RBA rate cut expectations for the next policy meeting in May to circa 60% and heightened the probability of another 25 bp ease before year end. Aud/Usd collapsed from around 0.7102 to 0.7028 in response before finding some underlying bids ahead of big barriers at the psychological 0.7000 level and a couple of downside chart supports in very close proximity, like 0.7005 (50% Fib) and 0.7003 (March 7 low). Note also, more exporter bids are anticipated around the next big figure following similar interest at 0.7050 that were filled on the way down amidst all round selling from high frequency and leverage accounts along with macro funds when 0.7070 gave way. Similarly, Aud/Nzd saw leverage and momentum longs bail on a break through 1.0650 as the cross hit a low of 1.0618 from 1.0671 at one stage, while the Kiwi also fell in sympathy vs its US counterpart to 0.6614 from 0.6657 and Nzd/Usd is now hovering near 0.6625 ahead of NZ trade data on Thursday.</p><p><strong>CAD -</strong> The other non-US Dollar is also languishing and retreating further from recent highs as a downturn in crude prices adds to defensive positioning in the lead up to today’s BoC meeting and MPR that is expected to be cautious if not dovish, with downgrades to Canadian growth and inflation projections. The Loonie is currently near the bottom of 1.3461-18 parameters and not far from last month’s low of 1.3468, as Usd/Cad options predict a 67 pip break-event for the BoC.</p><p><strong>EUR -</strong> The single currency is holding rather precariously on to the 1.1200 handle after another dip below stopped just short of Wednesday’s 1.1192 base, with the latest German Ifo survey missing on all counts and softer than the previous month. Moreover, the institute noted that the April readings point to more slowing in the economy and industrial sector underperformance, chiming with underwhelming preliminary PMIs, and could translate to lower 2019 GDP growth overall compared to the 0.8% forecast that has only recently been revised down. However, Eur/Usd has recovered to retest a key Fib at 1.1216 within a 1.1195-1.1231 range.</p><p><strong>CHF/SEK -</strong> Relative G10 outperformers as the Franc rebounds through 1.0200 vs the Greenback and from 1.1450+ against the Euro, while the Swedish Krona is back above 10.5000 vs the single currency and braced for the Riksbank to reaffirm tightening guidance for H2 this year tomorrow.

Sectors are similarly mixed, with Energy names underperforming in line with the oil complex’s positive momentum dissipating after the larger than expected API build. Also performing poorly is the auto sector, following Nissan cutting their FY guidance; which has weighed particularly heavily on Renault (-3.4%), with other auto names such as BMW (-0.8%) and Volkswagen (-1.0%) down in sympathy. Conversely, the Technology sector is significantly outperforming its peers led by the strong performance in sector heavyweight SAP (+8.5%) who represents 26% of the sector after the Co. reported strong earnings and raised 2019 operating profit guidance; subsequently, Co. shares have this morning printed a record high of EUR 109.3. Other notable movers this morning include Credit Suisse (+3.0%) and Novartis (+2.5%) following earnings with the SMI (+0.4%) outperforming on the back of this. In addition, Novartis strong performance, following the Co. raising guidance in-spite of the Q1 sales miss, has caused the Healthcare sector to perform strongly. Finally, in a turnaround from recent performance Wirecard (+8.3%) are the outperforming DAX constituent (+0.6%), after reports that the Co. and Softbank have signed an agreement for Softbank to purchase a 5.6% stake in the Co. for around USD 1bln.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD -</strong> The Aussie has sharply extended losses in wake of weaker than expected Q1 CPI metrics overnight that have raised RBA rate cut expectations for the next policy meeting in May to circa 60% and heightened the probability of another 25 bp ease before year end. Aud/Usd collapsed from around 0.7102 to 0.7028 in response before finding some underlying bids ahead of big barriers at the psychological 0.7000 level and a couple of downside chart supports in very close proximity, like 0.7005 (50% Fib) and 0.7003 (March 7 low). Note also, more exporter bids are anticipated around the next big figure following similar interest at 0.7050 that were filled on the way down amidst all round selling from high frequency and leverage accounts along with macro funds when 0.7070 gave way. Similarly, Aud/Nzd saw leverage and momentum longs bail on a break through 1.0650 as the cross hit a low of 1.0618 from 1.0671 at one stage, while the Kiwi also fell in sympathy vs its US counterpart to 0.6614 from 0.6657 and Nzd/Usd is now hovering near 0.6625 ahead of NZ trade data on Thursday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAD -</strong> The other non-US Dollar is also languishing and retreating further from recent highs as a downturn in crude prices adds to defensive positioning in the lead up to today’s BoC meeting and MPR that is expected to be cautious if not dovish, with downgrades to Canadian growth and inflation projections. The Loonie is currently near the bottom of 1.3461-18 parameters and not far from last month’s low of 1.3468, as Usd/Cad options predict a 67 pip break-event for the BoC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EUR -</strong> The single currency is holding rather precariously on to the 1.1200 handle after another dip below stopped just short of Wednesday’s 1.1192 base, with the latest German Ifo survey missing on all counts and softer than the previous month. Moreover, the institute noted that the April readings point to more slowing in the economy and industrial sector underperformance, chiming with underwhelming preliminary PMIs, and could translate to lower 2019 GDP growth overall compared to the 0.8% forecast that has only recently been revised down. However, Eur/Usd has recovered to retest a key Fib at 1.1216 within a 1.1195-1.1231 range.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CHF/SEK -</strong> Relative G10 outperformers as the Franc rebounds through 1.0200 vs the Greenback and from 1.1450+ against the Euro, while the Swedish Krona is back above 10.5000 vs the single currency and braced for the Riksbank to reaffirm tightening guidance for H2 this year tomorrow. Conversely, Eur/Nok remains elevated over 9.6000 on the aforementioned retreat in oil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DXY -</strong> The Usd continues to proffer at the expense of others, in part if not the most part, but the index has not managed to build on Tuesday’s new 97.783 ytd peak as the JPY and GBP also display a degree of resilience and contain downside forays ahead of 112.00 and 1.2900 respectively.

Instead, core debt remains relatively firmly in bear-steepening reversal or unwinding mode, and tracking the recovery and realignment across the UST curve following Tuesday’s corrective post-Easter trade. The turnaround has also been facilitated by a downturn in oil prices, but official EIA stocks may change the narrative if not as high as API and 5 year supply could also impact sentiment in bonds.</p>",

        "subject": "FX Morning Colour: Ifo irks the Euro, but inflation infuriates the Aussie",
        "content": "<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>The Aussie has sharply extended losses in wake of weaker than expected Q1 CPI metrics overnight that have raised RBA rate cut expectations for the next policy meeting in May to circa 60% and heightened the probability of another 25 bp ease before year end. Aud/Usd collapsed from around 0.7102 to 0.7028 in response before finding some underlying bids ahead of big barriers at the psychological 0.7000 level and a couple of downside chart supports in very close proximity, like 0.7005 (50% Fib) and 0.7003 (March 7 low). Note also, more exporter bids are anticipated around the next big figure following similar interest at 0.7050 that were filled on the way down amidst all round selling from high frequency and leverage accounts along with macro funds when 0.7070 gave way. Similarly, Aud/Nzd saw leverage and momentum longs bail on a break through 1.0650 as the cross hit a low of 1.0618 from 1.0671 at one stage, while the Kiwi also fell in sympathy vs its US counterpart to 0.6614 from 0.6657 and Nzd/Usd is now hovering near 0.6625 ahead of NZ trade data on Thursday.</p><p><strong>CAD</strong></p><p>The other non-US Dollar is also languishing and retreating further from recent highs as a downturn in crude prices adds to defensive positioning in the lead up to today’s BoC meeting and MPR that is expected to be cautious if not dovish, with downgrades to Canadian growth and inflation projections. The Loonie is currently near the bottom of 1.3461-18 parameters and not far from last month’s low of 1.3468, as Usd/Cad options predict a 67 pip break-event for the BoC.</p><p><strong>EUR</strong></p><p>The single currency is holding rather precariously on to the 1.1200 handle after another dip below stopped just short of Wednesday’s 1.1192 base, with the latest German Ifo survey missing on all counts and softer than the previous month. Moreover, the institute noted that the April readings point to more slowing in the economy and industrial sector underperformance, chiming with underwhelming preliminary PMIs, and could translate to lower 2019 GDP growth overall compared to the 0.8% forecast that has only recently been revised down. However, Eur/Usd has recovered to retest a key Fib at 1.1216 within a 1.1195-1.1231 range.</p><p><strong>CHF/SEK</strong></p><p>Relative G10 outperformers as the Franc rebounds through 1.0200 vs the Greenback and from 1.1450+ against the Euro, while the Swedish Krona is back above 10.5000 vs the single currency and braced for the Riksbank to reaffirm tightening guidance for H2 this year tomorrow. Conversely, Eur/Nok remains elevated over 9.6000 on the aforementioned retreat in oil.</p><p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Usd continues to proffer at the expense of others, in part if not the most part, but the index has not managed to build on Tuesday’s new 97.783 ytd peak as the <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>GBP</strong> also display a degree of resilience and contain downside forays ahead of 112.00 and 1.2900 respectively. Cable has bounced off Fib support at 1.2911, albeit mildly amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty, while Usd/Jpy is still encountering supply and the Yen retains underlying safe-haven support in the run up to the BoJ and US GDP data the day after. Note, detailed previews of all this week’s Central Bank policy convenes are available via the Research Suite and/or in the form of primers on the headline feed into each meeting.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Although the Buck has stopped climbing or at least paused for breath, Lira depreciation continues towards 5.8800 amidst persistent domestic and international issues blighting the Try. Indeed, even an improvement in Turkish manufacturing sentiment has failed to offer any real respite as the CBRT policy meeting looms and the Bank looks relatively incapable of resolving the prescient problems beyond hiking rates are turning extremely hawkish.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The 10 year UK benchmark has rebounded further from yesterday’s lows in line with Bunds and US Treasuries as risk sentiment peters out alongside a downturn in oil prices on the back of a bumper build in US API crude inventories. However, also in keeping with the relatively tentative tone in core counterparts Gilts are treading cautiously above the 127.00 mark and ahead of some key technical levels, like 127.16 and 127.25, with the early Liffe range spanning 127.10-126.98 vs Tuesday’s 126.84 settlement price. Ahead, public sector finances for the final full month of the 2018/2019 fiscal year and a speech from Chancellor Hammond on the Spring Budget to Parliament, while Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour appear to remain grid-locked. Back to Liffe, the 3 month strip is trying to nudge higher as well and stands 0.5-1.5 ticks above par at present.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mixed after the region failed to sustain the mild tailwind from Wall St where strong blue-chip earnings propelled the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to fresh record closes. ASX 200 (+0.9%) resumed this week’s outperformance as soft CPI data brought forward various expectations for a rate cut to as early as next month, while gains in the Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) were later pared on detrimental currency moves. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) also failed to sustain opening gains as White House confirmation that US-China trade talks will resume next week and the PBoC announcement of CNY 267bln in targeted MLF, was overshadowed after the PBoC dismissed rumours related to a potential targeted RRR cut for rural banks and refrained from Reverse Repo operations. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains as sentiment in the region soured and after similar upside in T-notes amid bull-steepening in the US, while the BoJ were also active in the market today for a respectable JPY 950bln of JGBs and focus now shifts towards the conclusion of the central bank’s 2-day policy meeting tomorrow.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade indecisive after the regional bourses fail to sustain the mild tailwind from Wall St where strong blue-chip earnings propelled the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to fresh record closes. ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) are mixed with Australia resuming this week’s outperformance as soft CPI data supports the consensus for rate cuts later in the year, while gains in Tokyo were later pared on currency moves. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) are choppy as the White House’s confirmation that US-China trade talks will resume next week and the PBoC announcement of CNY 267bln in targeted MLF, is counterbalanced after the PBoC dismissed rumours related to a potential targeted RRR cut for rural banks and refrained from Reverse Repo operations.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY consolidates near 2-year highs and holds on to most the spoils from the prior session’s onslaught against its major counterparts in which EUR/USD briefly dipped below 1.1200, with a surprise expansion in US Home Sales and softer than expected EU Consumer Confidence doing little to help plug the losses for the single currency. GBP/USD is subdued after its failure to hold above 1.3000 with PM May facing increased pressure to step down and USD/JPY is lacklustre after sentiment in the region soured, while antipodeans underperform as AUD/USD slumped following disappointing Australian inflation data which missed expectations across all components with headline Y/Y CPI matching its softest since Q3 2016. Furthermore, the PBoC weakened its reference rate accordingly and KRW was another fallout of the USD strength as it declined to its lowest in more than 20 months which some also attributed to repatriations related to stock dividends.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains as sentiment in the region soured and after similar upside in T-notes amid bull-steepening in the US, while the BoJ are also active in the market today for a respectable JPY 950bln of JGBs and with focus now shifting towards the conclusion of the central bank’s 2-day policy meeting tomorrow.</p>",
