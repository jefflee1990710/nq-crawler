After a grim ADP report, money markets priced 66% probability of three rate cuts in 2019, although this pricing was pared back after a solid non-manufacturing ISM report, which augurs well for the employment situation report due Friday.

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP - 05 JUNE 2019: Weak ADP, solid non-mfg ISM; doubts grow over Mexico tariff deal",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT: </strong>Equites up, Treasuries up, dollar up, crude down.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> ADP big miss; Solid non-mfg ISM; Bearish DOE inventory report; Trump reiterates Mexican threat; dovish Fedspeak.</p><p><strong>* COMING UP:</strong> AU Trade Balance, GE Industrial Orders, EU Revised Q1 GDP, ECB Rate Decision, US International Trade, Labour Costs &amp; Productivity Revised, ECB Macro Projections, CA Ivey PMI, BoJ’s Kuroda and Fin Min Aso, BoE’s Carney, ECB’s Draghi speaks after rate decision, Fed’s Kaplan, Williams.</p><p><strong>* MEXICO:</strong> Ahead of meetings between the US and Mexican delegations in Washington (meeting occurring in US afternoon trade, with Mexican officials set to give a press conference after 1800 EDT - talking points include: asylum cooperation, stopping trafficking networks, border enforcement, and maintaining or increasing immigration detentions) there were further constructive comments from Mexican President AMLO, which were then reinforced by the usually hawkish trade advisor Navarro, who said that tariffs on Mexico might not even go into effect. There has been increasing chatter form some in the GOP, coming out against Trump’s potential tariffs on Mexico. However, US President Trump continued the punchy rhetoric, stating that If Mexico does not take measures to control migrants, the tariffs will be implemented. As such, while a week ago, the consensus view was more hopeful that tariffs could be avoided, analysts are now preparing for the possibility that they will be enacted on 10th June. SGH Macro, a consultancy, for instance, argued that it was now highly likely that Trump would defy the resistance from some in the GOP, and deliver on his threats, in a sign of continued dissatisfaction with the measures the Mexican government is expected to propose. Finally, sources said Mexico will be making its own demands in talks with the US, seeking funds from US for development, as well as demanding that arms cease to criminal cartels, and Mexico will not accept \"safe third country status\"; the demands are likely to be a contentious topic with the Trump administration, and some analysts suggested that the chances of a deal had diminished.</p><p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed’s Kaplan (non-voter) managed to cause a few jitters in early trade after stating his preference for the FOMC to be patient and see how the situation unfolds, saying it was too early to make a judgement on rates. The comments might have found traders off-guard; although he is a non-voter this year, Kaplan is considered a dove, and as such, his call for patience is slightly at odds with building expectations that the Fed will cut rates in 2019. Fed’s Evans (voter) who yesterday sounded quite a dovish note, today intimated that every Fed meeting was live, adding that he was a little nervous about inflation developments. Evans also suggested that there were “insurance” reasons to talk about policy; Clarida this week also noted that the FOMC has enacted “insurance” rate cuts in the past, and Evans remarks are another voice in that direction. Governor Brainard (voter) said she was prepared to adjust policy in order to sustain the expansion, noting trade conflicts presented downside risks to the economy.</p><p><strong>* BEIGE BOOK: </strong>There was increased focus on the Beige Book after Fed chair Powell’s comments on Tuesday. However, the headline sterilised the scarier phrasing of the report. The Beige Book stated that US economic activity expanded at a modest pace from the April-May survey period, a slight improvement over the previous report. However, business contacts reported concerns about international trade tensions across sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture. Some slowing in manufacturing activity was reported, by manufacturers were generally positive, as was the economic outlook for the coming months. Ahead of payrolls this week, the Beige Book stated that employment continued to rise nationwide, wage pressures remained subdued, although consumer spending reports were mainly positive.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA:</strong> There were few positives regarding US/China relations on Wednesday; China’s Xinhua published commentary criticising the US response to China’s white paper as disappointing, whilst reiterating China’s claim that the US is to blame for the breakdown in talks. China’s Global Times Editor then hinted that potential Chinese counter measures are in the pipeline: saying more than one Chinese key departments are collecting experts' opinion on further countermeasures against US “suppression”. Finally, reports emerged suggesting that the US is poised to sell tanks and weapons worth USD 2bln to Taiwan, a move likely to irritate China.</p><p><strong>* ITALY</strong>: Italian political watchers shifted their eyes away from domestic political drama (after Deputy PMs Salvini and Di Maio seemingly made up on Tuesday) back to the country’s debt related confrontation with the EU on Wednesday. Following Tuesday reports that Italian Deputy PM’s Salvini and Di Maio had discussed the option of breaching the EU’s 3% budget deficit rule, news emerged that the European Commission are to begin the infringement process against the Italian government. German Finance Minister Scholz took a seemingly tougher stance on the issue, saying the rules-based procedure of the EU and good talks are the correct way to deal with Italy which contrasted somewhat with EU's Moscovici, who said the European Commission's door remains open to avoid disciplinary procedure against Italy. Italy’s Deputy PM Di Maio later commented that the government will not change position on its pension reform, which was followed by reports that Italy could nominate Italian Finance Minister Tria for a Europe Commission job, a move which would throw a wrench into the post European elections process of choosing who will get the European top jobs.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (M9) SETTLED 1+ TICKS HIGHER AT 126-20+:</strong> The Treasury curve steepened on Wednesday. After a grim ADP report, money markets priced 66% probability of three rate cuts in 2019, although this pricing was pared back after a solid non-manufacturing ISM report, which augurs well for the employment situation report due Friday. There were reports that accounts were buying the dip after dovish Brainard comments. At settlement, major curve spreads were wider at settlement, with the 2s30s spread at the highest level in over a year.</p><p><strong>* US ADP PAYROLLS: </strong>ADP National Employment Data came in at just 27k, well below the expected 180k and last month’s 271k (which incidentally revised lower from 275k), the worst print since September 2010. Pantheon Macroeconomics comments that “payroll growth was bound to slow in May, following April’s unexpected strength, but this is a much bigger slowdown than we expected.” ADP’s model incorporates both macro variables and employment data collected from the firms who use its payroll service, Pantheon notes, so the fact that the May number was substantially lower than Pantheon’s estimate, which is based solely on macro variables, implies that the information ADP collected from its clients was very soft. “ADP’s model is not always reliable, but this is such a big miss that we have to temper our forecast for Friday’s official number” the consultancy say “we now expect a 100K increase.”</p><p><strong>* US NON-MANUFACTURING ISM: </strong>A solid report saw the headline rebound to 56.9 (cons 55.5, prev 55.5). The breakdown was encouraging, with activity, new orders and employment rising, although prices slipped a touch. “The report suggests service-sector growth is solid,” Goldman Sachs said. Goldman focussed on the contrasting signals on the labour market given by the ISM and the ADP data, arguing that it was placing substantially more weight on the ISM given the potentially large drag from financial variables and economic inputs in the ADP model this month.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.80 LOWER AT USD 51.68/BBL; BRENT (Q8) SETTLES USD 1.34 LOWER AT USD 60.63/BBL:</strong> The bears were in control (again) following the EIA’s inventory data release on Wednesday, which was bearish on all fronts and saw crude nosedive. Headline crude stocks printed a surprise build of 6.8mln bbls, essentially double the API figure and in contrast to the expected 0.8mln draw. In the products, gasoline built by 3.2mln bbls (exp. +0.6mln) and distillates built by 4.6mln bbls (exp. +0.5mln). Cushing stocks built by 1.8mln bbls, which analysts said was surprising given the time of year, when we are entering peak season for summer refining runs. US crude production was also reported to have increased to all-time highs at 12.4mln BPD. Unsurprisingly, crude markets legged lower on the release and extended losses.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.8% at 2826, NASDAQ-10 0.8% at 7221, Dow Jones&nbsp; 0.8% at 25540</strong>: <strong>SECTORS:</strong> Consumer Discretionary 0.4%, Consumer Staples&nbsp;1.1%, Energy&nbsp;-1.1%, Financials 0.6%, Health Care&nbsp; 0.7%, Industrials&nbsp;1.1%, Information Technology 1.4%, Materials&nbsp;0.8%, Telecommunication Services 0.1%, Utilities&nbsp;2.1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Salesforce.com (CRM) moved higher at the open after the firm reported earnings that beat on bottom line expectations and raised guidance higher for FY20. Brown-Forman Corp (BF.B) caught a bid after the firm also reported strong earnings, beating on the top and bottom lines. United Health Corp (UNH) was up after the healthcare provider raised its dividend. Ford (F) fell on news that Chinese subsidiary Changan Auto would be fined by Chinese regulators for violating anti-monopoly law. Boeing (BA) momentarily popped higher as news emerged that the aircraft maker is in talks with airlines from China for a 100-jet sale, but the move quickly reversed with sources stating that US-China trade discussions are complicating talks. Apple (AAPL) advanced, supported by CEO Tim Cook comments, where he said he doesn't see China targeting Apple in the trade dispute and the news that the company will ask developers to position a new \"Sign on with Apple\" button in iPhone and iPad apps which will be placed above rival buttons from Alphabet's Google and Facebook. Walmart (WMT) shares were up despite calls from Democratic Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders pushing for higher wages for its workers. Campbell Soup (CPB) jumped higher after the firm posted strong earnings and raised FY guidance. Facebook (FB) lagged the market, under pressure amid news that investors are calling for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be replaced as chairman by an independent director.</p><p><strong>* FX DAILY WRAP: USD</strong> was under pressure early on, as Fed’s Brainard joined the dovish chorus and ADP employment numbers came in well below expectations, with DXY moving as low as 96.80. However, over the course of the session the move reversed, as better than expected ISM non-Manufacturing data and comments from Fed’s Kaplan (typically a dove) lent back on the markets aggressive pricing of rate cuts. <strong>EUR</strong> got brief impetus from better than expected Eurozone services PMIs, but met chart hurdles at 1.1300 (vs USD), while also being plagued by more Italian-EU fiscal wrangling as the latter reiterated grounds to enact the EDP. <strong>GBP </strong>outperformed the single currency for a second day, as services PMI broke a run of sub-50 readings in the Construction and Manufacturing PMIs, and above consensus 51.0 print; meanwhile US President Trump tempered on yesterday’s comments that the NHS would be “on the table” during US/UK trade negotiations post Brexit. <strong>JPY</strong> weaker against the buck, as the latter strengthened, and risk sentiment remained relatively upbeat on the recent Fed pivot. <strong>NZD</strong> was the G10 outperformer, following hawkish remarks from RBNZ Assistant Governor Hawkesby overnight – effectively signalling that the current level of policy accommodation is sufficient for the foreseeable future (RBNZ has an easing bias) - AUDNZD hit near 2-month lows, briefly visiting the 1.0500 handle. The EM complex was mixed. <strong>MXN</strong> started stronger as Mexican President AMLO and White House Trade Advisor seemed upbeat on the prospect of a US/Mexico deal being done in time for the latter to avoid tariffs. However, gains were capped as the White House latter walked back on some of this optimism, with downside later exacerbated as reports emerged that Mexico would be making its own demands in the talks. <strong>TRY</strong> continued to strengthen, moving below 5.7500, as oil prices sunk, the dollar remained weak and optimism remains upbeat following the recent promising inflation data. However, the risk of a further escalation in tensions between Turkey and the US remains, as the former plans to move ahead with its purchase of Russian S-400s; albeit, there is optimism that US President Trump and Turkey President Erdogan might see eye to eye in their meeting at the G20 Summit later this month. <strong>BRL</strong> was weaker as Services and Composite PMI fell into contractionary territory. <strong>RUB</strong> was also weaker, taking its cue from the crude complex; on which note <strong>NOK</strong> also fell, with EURNOK advancing above recent resistance at 9.8000.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>USD</strong> was under pressure early on, as Fed’s Brainard joined the dovish chorus and ADP employment numbers came in well below expectations, with DXY moving as low as 96.80. However, over the course of the session the move reversed, as better than expected ISM non-Manufacturing data and comments from Fed’s Kaplan (typically a dove) lent back on the markets aggressive pricing of rate cuts. <strong>EUR</strong> got brief impetus from better than expected Eurozone services PMIs, but met chart hurdles at 1.1300 (vs USD), while also being plagued by more Italian-EU fiscal wrangling as the latter reiterated grounds to enact the EDP. <strong>GBP </strong>outperformed the single currency for a second day, as services PMI broke a run of sub-50 readings in the Construction and Manufacturing PMIs, and above consensus 51.0 print; meanwhile US President Trump tempered on yesterday’s comments that the NHS would be “on the table” during US/UK trade negotiations post Brexit. <strong>JPY</strong> weaker against the buck, as the latter strengthened, and risk sentiment remained relatively upbeat on the recent Fed pivot. <strong>NZD</strong> was the G10 outperformer, following hawkish remarks from RBNZ Assistant Governor Hawkesby overnight – effectively signalling that the current level of policy accommodation is sufficient for the foreseeable future (RBNZ has an easing bias) - AUDNZD hit near 2-month lows, briefly visiting the 1.0500 handle. The EM complex was mixed. <strong>MXN</strong> was stronger as Mexican President AMLO and White House Trade Advisor seemed upbeat on the prospect of a US/Mexico deal being done in time for the latter to avoid tariffs. However, gains were capped as the White House latter walked back on some of this optimism. <strong>TRY</strong> continued to strengthen, moving below 5.7500, as oil prices sunk, the dollar remained weak and optimism remains upbeat following the recent promising inflation data. However, the risk of a further escalation in tensions between Turkey and the US remains, as the former plans to move ahead with its purchase of Russian S-400s; albeit, there is optimism that US President Trump and Turkey President Erdogan might see eye to eye in their meeting at the G20 Summit later this month. <strong>BRL</strong> was weaker as Services and Composite PMI fell into contractionary territory. <strong>RUB</strong> was also weaker, taking its cue from the crude complex; on which note <strong>NOK</strong> also fell, with EURNOK advancing above recent resistance at 9.8000.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>The <strong>DXY </strong>is clinging to the 97.000 pivot as a relatively upbeat non-manufacturing US ISM offsets some of the negativity from a vastly weaker than forecast ADP tally as a precursor to Friday’s BLS report. However, latest comments from the Fed are keeping the Dollar depressed overall and the index on an incrementally lower trajectory as Brainard echoed chair Powell with a pledge to adjust policy to maintain growth if required, while even Evans sounded more willing to discuss an insurance cut given some concerns about soft inflation. Moreover, the latter added it would be prudent to review the current monetary policy stance this month, and on each occasion that the FOMC meet, which in turn puts additional emphasis on the upcoming Beige Book. DXY currently holding within a 97.154-96.741 range with nearest chart support and resistance seen at 96.745 and 97.030 in the context of closing levels.</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The Kiwi has been the major performer and extended gains to 0.6665 and virtually 1.0500 vs its US and Aussie rivals at best following comparatively hawkish rhetoric from RBNZ Assistant Governor Hawkesby overnight – effectively signalling that the current level of policy accommodation is sufficient for the foreseeable future. Conversely, Aud/Usd failed to maintain its post-RBA recovery and short squeeze momentum amidst speculation that a back-to-back ease in July could be more aggressive (ie ½ point this 25 bp) and recoiled from just over 0.70000 to 0.6980, with hefty options and chart resistance also hampering the Aussie.</p><p><strong>GBP&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The next best G10 currency, but only partly on UK specifics as the services PMI broke a run of sub-50 readings with an above consensus 51.0 print. Cable consolidated its rebound and reached 1.2740+ peaks at one stage, with a helping hand from the aforementioned weak Greenback, while Eur/Gbp pulled back from circa 0.8878 to sub-0.8850, but again at least partially on relative underperformance in the single currency.</p><p><strong>CHF</strong></p><p>Another beneficiary at the expense of others, as Usd/Chf breached the psychological 0.9900 level within a 0.9930-0.9855 range and Eur/Chf retreated from near 1.1200 to around 1.1140 as broad risk sentiment soured amidst a steeper reversal in oil prices, which also undermined the Loonie and Nokkie predictably (Usd/Cad back up around 1.3400 vs almost 1.3360 and Eur/Nok close to 9.8150 from 9.7220 or thereabouts at the other extreme).</p><p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong></p><p>Both fairly volatile vs the Buck between 1.1250-1.1305 and 108.37-107.82 respectively as the Euro got brief impetus from better than expected Eurozone services PMIs, but met chart hurdles around the big figure and was also plagued by more Italian-EU fiscal wrangling as the latter reiterated grounds to enact the EDP. Meanwhile, the Yen was more prone to swings in the risk tone as usual alongside changes in US Treasury and JGB yield differentials.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>The Peso grabbed some of the regional headlines on the back of more positive reports about the prospects for a Mexican-US deal before next Monday’s tariff deadline, and in particular from President AMLO who expressed optimism that an accord could be reached as soon as today. Usd/Mxn tested 14.5000 vs 19.6700+ at the high, and with extra encouragement from US Trade advisor Navarro who suggested that higher import taxes may not have to be imposed.</p>",

Cushing, Oklahoma built by 1.41mln bbls, it is worth noting that the weather-related pipeline closures last week were speculated to have caused build ups at Cushing. Participants will now be looking to see confirmation in the official EIA inventory release later in the session.</li><li>Russian Energy Minister Novak and Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih are to meet on June 10th, which could be an attempt to find a consensus on the debated dates for the OPEC+ meeting. Although Russian officials had recently spoke in favour of extending OPEC+ supply cuts, the energy ministry may face some pushback from producers. Russia’s <strong>Rosneft recently said that it would seek compensation from the Russian government if the supply cuts are extended</strong>. Additionally, Russia’s Gazprom Neft said on earlier in the session that Russian producers are ready to boost output quickly if OPEC+ decide to do so, and that itself can raise output by 50k BPD in the next two months and 70k BPD by year-end.</li><li><strong>SocGen sees Brent rising from current levels to USD 70/bbl in the second half of this year</strong>, “we believe the balance of risks is now skewed marginally to the upside.” The bank cites the likelihood of supply cuts being extended, especially given the recent sell off in crude markets; in addition the analysts note with Libya close to maximum output, there are risks this would be cut if the civil war escalates, as well as the sustained Venezuelan and Iranian export glut.</li></ul>",

Sectors are somewhat mixed, with the Tech sector the notable outperformer, despite yesterday’s FAANG driven underperformance in tech names; where the sector lagged heavily for much of the session. Separately, but potentially of note for Tech names; TSMC Chairman Liu stated that the US’s move to ban US companies from doing business with Huawei is to have a short-term impact on TSMC, though the Co’s outlook remains unchanged, which may have provided some impetus to the European IT names. This morning’s most notable move is Provident Financial (+16.4%) on the back of Non-Standard Finance (-2.7%) stating that they are not going ahead with the hostile takeover. Also, in the green and towards the top of the Stoxx 600 are Norsk Hydro (+3.6%) after posting stronger than expected earnings; however, the Co. state that they expect to see payments relating to the cyber-attack in their Q3 earnings. Meanwhile, Saipem (+4.8%) shares spiked higher after announcing a new EPC contract for Anadarko Mozambique project, in which the Co. will have a share of around USD 6bln. Finally, Hikma Pharmaceuticals (-0.8%) are in negative territory as they are set to be removed from the FTSE 100.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>NZD/AUD -</strong> Some divergence down under as RBNZ Deputy Governor Hawkesby intimates that rates may remain on hold for a while if not considerably longer in contrast to RBA Governor Lowe who inferred that more easing could be in the offing in addition to Tuesday’s 25 bp OCR cut. Hence, the Aud/Nzd cross has recoiled further from circa 1.0600 and through 1.0550, while the Kiwi is leading G10 gains vs a soggy Greenback after Fed chair Powell promised to support the US economy against a more pronounced slowdown yesterday. Nzd/Usd has tested resistance and offers around 0.6950, as Aud/Usd continues its rebound from pre-RBA lows to just over 0.7000 and into a heavy option expiry zone spanning 0.7005 to 0.7025 (1.7 bn). Note also, the Aussie needs to clear Fib resistance at 0.6995 convincingly and faces congested technical resistance between 0.7033-35 in the form of the 55 DMA and another Fib.</p><p><strong>USD -</strong> The aforementioned Dollar weakness has pushed the DXY back down below 97.000 and sub-the 100 DMA at 96.980 to a fresh 96.915 low amidst widespread losses vs major currency counterparts and EMs, bar the Yen and Rand. Technically, 96.745 is the next support level and fundamentally the focus switches to ADP ahead of Friday’s NFP, services surveys (Markit PMI and ISM) and more Fed speak.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/CAD/CHF -</strong> As noted above, all beneficiaries of the Buck’s demise, but with the single currency and Pound also gleaning some traction via better than expected services PMIs, on balance. Indeed, Eur/Usd has now surpassed the 100 DMA (1.1276) having narrowly missed the equivalent level on Tuesday and is eyeing 1.1300, while Cable seems more assured on the 1.2700 handle, albeit still lagging in Eur/Gbp cross terms within a 0.8855-80 range. Elsewhere, the Loonie has overcome 1.3400 and is filling hefty buying interest layered from 1.3370 to 1.3360, with the 100 DMA sitting just under 1.3350 at 1.3348, and the Franc has rebounded towards 0.9900 but underperforming vs the Euro in broad 1.1300-1.1250 parameters.</p><p><strong>JPY -</strong> In contrast to its major peers, the Yen has been undermined by the ongoing recovery in broad risk sentiment and is retesting recent 108.30+ lows vs the Dollar with decent expiries also within close proximity at 108.20-30 (1 bn) and 108.50-55 (1.1 bn).</p><p><strong>EM -</strong> While most of the region takes advantage of the Dollar’s downturn, more downbeat SA macro developments have hit the Rand and propped up Usd/Zar within 14.8240-6260 boundaries. The bad news kicked off with a sub-50 services PMI and continued via weaker business sentiment, while the ANC party’s ally has joined forces to back a wider SARB policy mandate prompting a dismissive response from the Bank itself.</p><p>Australian Real GDP (Q1) Q/Q 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.2%). (Newswires) Australian Real GDP (Q1) Y/Y 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.8% (Prev. 2.3%)</p><p>RBNZ Assistant Governor Hawkesby said RBNZ central view is for interest rates to remain broadly around current levels for the foreseeable future and that the bank needs to be prepared to adapt to changing conditions to meet its objectives. (Newswires)</p><p>South African Communist Party, seen as a key ANC ally, state that the SARB's mandate must explicitly include employment and growth targeting and the act pertaining to the bank should be amended, subsequently SARB Governor Kganyago states that the constitutional mandate of the bank is price stability; and their Finance Minister says no-one is discussing changes to the SARB’s mandate. (Newswires)</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Notwithstanding claims from Italian PM Conte that the country’s finances will be more healthy than implied by the first half of 2019 and Rome will do all it can to avoid EDP measures, BTPs are succumbing to another bout of investor angst with the Sep19 future now down through 129.00 and almost a full point below the 129.78 high. This has given Bunds a boost from a new 170.85 Eurex low in wake of better than expected Eurozone services PMIs, but Gilts have rebounded further from their deeper 129.67 Liffe base despite a UK services beat. Elsewhere, the US Treasury curve remains steeper after yesterday’s assurances from Fed’s Powell that policy will be tweaked as needed, ie loosened in the case of a more pronounced slowdown, as the focus turns to ADP, non-manufacturing PMI/ISM and another raft of Fed speakers.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI (-0.7%) and Brent (-0.6%) prices are back on the decline as a surprise build in last night’s API exacerbated the recent downside seen amidst demand concerns</strong>. Stockpiles last week increased by 3.5mln barrels vs. an expected decline of 800k barrels. On the OPEC front, Russian Energy Minister Novak will be meeting his Saudi counterpart, Al-Falih, on June 10th to potentially discuss a date for the OPEC/OPEC+ meeting with no confirmation as of yet to whether it will take place at the end of June or early July. News-flow has been light for the complex thus far, with traders now eyeing the release of the weekly DoE crude stocks data in which the headline is expected to draw by 849k barrels. Elsewhere, <strong>Gold </strong>(+0.9%) is holding onto a bulk of its recent gains amid the weaker post-Powell USD whilst copper is set to notch a third straight day of gains on the back of a receding Buck, whilst alumina prices declined due to a demand halt as traders paused on spot purchases amid high prices.</p><p>Russian Energy Minister Novak and Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih are to meet on June 10th, according to a statement.

Sectors are somewhat mixed, with the Tech sector the notable outperformer, despite yesterday’s FAANG driven underperformance in tech names; where the sector lagged heavily for much of the session. Separately, but potentially of note for Tech names; TSMC Chairman Liu stated that the US’s move to ban US companies from doing business with Huawei is to have a short-term impact on TSMC, though the Co’s outlook remains unchanged, which may have provided some impetus to the European IT names. This morning’s most notable move is Provident Financial (+16.4%) on the back of Non-Standard Finance (-2.7%) stating that they are not going ahead with the hostile takeover. Also, in the green and towards the top of the Stoxx 600 are Norsk Hydro (+3.6%) after posting stronger than expected earnings; however, the Co. state that they expect to see payments relating to the cyber-attack in their Q3 earnings. Meanwhile, Saipem (+4.8%) shares spiked higher after announcing a new EPC contract for Anadarko Mozambique project, in which the Co. will have a share of around USD 6bln. Finally, Hikma Pharmaceuticals (-0.8%) are in negative territory as they are set to be removed from the FTSE 100.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong> - Some divergence down under as RBNZ Deputy Governor Hawkesby intimates that rates may remain on hold for a while if not considerably longer in contrast to RBA Governor Lowe who inferred that more easing could be in the offing in addition to Tuesday’s 25 bp OCR cut. Hence, the Aud/Nzd cross has recoiled further from circa 1.0600 and through 1.0550, while the Kiwi is leading G10 gains vs a soggy Greenback after Fed chair Powell promised to support the US economy against a more pronounced slowdown yesterday. Nzd/Usd has tested resistance and offers around 0.6950, as Aud/Usd continues its rebound from pre-RBA lows to just over 0.7000 and into a heavy option expiry zone spanning 0.7005 to 0.7025 (1.7 bn). Note also, the Aussie needs to clear Fib resistance at 0.6995 convincingly and faces congested technical resistance between 0.7033-35 in the form of the 55 DMA and another Fib.</p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The aforementioned Dollar weakness has pushed the DXY back down below 97.000 and sub-the 100 DMA at 96.980 to a fresh 96.915 low amidst widespread losses vs major currency counterparts and EMs, bar the Yen and Rand. Technically, 96.745 is the next support level and fundamentally the focus switches to ADP ahead of Friday’s NFP, services surveys (Markit PMI and ISM) and more Fed speak.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/CAD/CHF</strong> - As noted above, all beneficiaries of the Buck’s demise, but with the single currency and Pound also gleaning some traction via better than expected services PMIs, on balance. Indeed, Eur/Usd has now surpassed the 100 DMA (1.1276) having narrowly missed the equivalent level on Tuesday and is eyeing 1.1300, while Cable seems more assured on the 1.2700 handle, albeit still lagging in Eur/Gbp cross terms within a 0.8855-80 range. Elsewhere, the Loonie has overcome 1.3400 and is filling hefty buying interest layered from 1.3370 to 1.3360, with the 100 DMA sitting just under 1.3350 at 1.3348, and the Franc has rebounded towards 0.9900 but underperforming vs the Euro in broad 1.1300-1.1250 parameters.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong> - In contrast to its major peers, the Yen has been undermined by the ongoing recovery in broad risk sentiment and is retesting recent 108.30+ lows vs the Dollar with decent expiries also within close proximity at 108.20-30 (1 bn) and 108.50-55 (1.1 bn).</p><p>EM - While most of the region takes advantage of the Dollar’s downturn, more downbeat SA macro developments have hit the Rand and propped up Usd/Zar within 14.8240-6260 boundaries. The bad news kicked off with a sub-50 services PMI and continued via weaker business sentiment, while the ANC party’s ally has joined forces to back a wider SARB policy mandate prompting a dismissive response from the Bank itself.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding claims from Italian PM Conte that the country’s finances will be more healthy than implied by the first half of 2019 and Rome will do all it can to avoid EDP measures, <strong>BTPs</strong> are succumbing to another bout of investor angst with the Sep19 future now down through 129.00 and almost a full point below the 129.78 high. This has given Bunds a boost from a new 170.85 Eurex low in wake of better than expected Eurozone services PMIs, but <strong>Gilts</strong> have rebounded further from their deeper 129.67 Liffe base despite a UK services beat. Elsewhere, the <strong>US Treasury</strong> curve remains steeper after yesterday’s assurances from Fed’s Powell that policy will be tweaked as needed, ie loosened in the case of a more pronounced slowdown, as the focus turns to ADP, non-manufacturing PMI/ISM and another raft of Fed speakers.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> (-0.7%) and <strong>Brent</strong> (-0.6%) prices are back on the decline as a surprise build in last night’s API exacerbated the recent downside seen amidst demand concerns. Stockpiles last week increased by 3.5mln barrels vs. an expected decline of 800k barrels. On the OPEC front, Russian Energy Minister Novak will be meeting his Saudi counterpart, Al-Falih, on June 10th to potentially discuss a date for the OPEC/OPEC+ meeting with no confirmation as of yet to whether it will take place at the end of June or early July. News-flow has been light for the complex thus far, with traders now eyeing the release of the weekly DoE crude stocks data in which the headline is expected to draw by 849k barrels. Elsewhere, Gold (+0.9%) is holding onto a bulk of its recent gains amid the weaker post-Powell USD whilst copper is set to notch a third straight day of gains on the back of a receding Buck, whilst alumina prices declined due to a demand halt as traders paused on spot purchases amid high prices.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>Some divergence down under as RBNZ Deputy Governor Hawkesby intimates that rates may remain on hold for a while if not considerably longer in contrast to RBA Governor Lowe who inferred that more easing could be in the offing in addition to Tuesday’s 25 bp OCR cut. Hence, the Aud/Nzd cross has recoiled further from circa 1.0600 and through 1.0550, while the Kiwi is leading G10 gains vs a soggy Greenback after Fed chair Powell promised to support the US economy against a more pronounced slowdown yesterday. Nzd/Usd has tested resistance and offers around 0.6950, as Aud/Usd continues its rebound from pre-RBA lows to just over 0.7000 and into a heavy option expiry zone spanning 0.7005 to 0.7025 (1.7 bn). Note also, the Aussie needs to clear Fib resistance at 0.6995 convincingly and faces congested technical resistance between 0.7033-35 in the form of the 55 DMA and another Fib.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The aforementioned Dollar weakness has pushed the <strong>DXY </strong>back down below 97.000 and sub-the 100 DMA at 96.980 to a fresh 96.915 low amidst widespread losses vs major currency counterparts and EMs, bar the Yen and Rand. Technically, 96.745 is the next support level and fundamentally the focus switches to ADP ahead of Friday’s NFP, services surveys (Markit PMI and ISM) and more Fed speak ahead of the latest Beige Book.</p><p><strong>EUR/GBP/CAD/CHF</strong></p><p>As noted above, all beneficiaries of the Buck’s demise, but with the single currency and Pound also gleaning some traction via better than expected services PMIs, on balance. Indeed, Eur/Usd has now surpassed the 100 DMA (1.1276) having narrowly missed the equivalent level on Tuesday and is eyeing 1.1300, while Cable seems more assured on the 1.2700 handle, albeit still lagging in Eur/Gbp cross terms within a 0.8855-80 range. Elsewhere, the Loonie has overcome 1.3400 and is filling hefty buying interest layered from 1.3370 to 1.3360, with the 100 DMA sitting just under 1.3350 at 1.3348, and the Franc has rebounded towards 0.9900 but underperforming vs the Euro in broad 1.1300-1.1250 parameters.</p><p><strong>JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In contrast to its major peers, the Yen has been undermined by the ongoing recovery in broad risk sentiment and is retesting recent 108.30+ lows vs the Dollar with decent expiries also within close proximity at 108.20-30 (1 bn) and 108.50-55 (1.1 bn).</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>While most of the region takes advantage of the Dollar’s downturn, more downbeat SA macro developments have hit the Rand and propped up Usd/Zar within 14.8240-6260 boundaries. The bad news kicked off with a sub-50 services PMI and continued via weaker business sentiment, while the ANC party’s ally has joined forces to back a wider SARB policy mandate prompting a dismissive response from the Bank itself.</p>",

However, the Short Sterling strip remains firm between 0.5 and 3 ticks above yesterday’s closing levels in wake of comments from Fed chair Powell that underpinned rate cut expectations without explicitly signalling a shift in stance, and as attention turns towards the last of the May PMIs in the form of services. Note, BoE’s Ramsden stuck to the Libor script, as expected. Back to Liffe, the 10 year benchmark is holding within a 129.91-74 range vs its previous 129.63 close.</p>",

Voter Evans got us underway, hinting that there could be rate cuts as part of the Fed’s reaction function to trade wars, a sentiment underscored by Chair Powell later, and Vice Chair Clarida after that. The rise in short-end yields was supported by no mention of rate cuts from Powell, some analysts reasoned, while the longer-end’s rise in yields was taking its cue from stocks rallying. In terms of Fed pricing, The probability that rates would remain at 2.25-2.50% by year-end actually rose a touch (to 6% from 2%), according to CME Fedwatch; however, pricing for a June rate cut increased by around 7.5ppts (to 27.5%), and pricing for a July rate cut rose from 53.1% to 66.5%.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher as the region takes impetus from the performance in US where sentiment was buoyed after comments from Fed Chair Powell spurred hopes of a rate cut. This saw Wall St notch its biggest gain since early-January with the Nasdaq the frontrunner as tech outperformed, while all sectors in the S&amp;P 500 closed in the green and the DJIA rallied by over 500 points. ASX 200 (+0.8%) benefits from the firm lead with tech leading the upside and as the recent rate cut by the RBA as well its openness to further reductions underpins sentiment. Meanwhile, Nikkei 225 (+1.8%) surged as Japanese exporters cheer a weaker currency and with SoftBank shares also boosted as it expects to book a profit of around JPY 1.2tln on the partial sale of its Alibaba stake. Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) conform to the positive global risk tone but with gains in the mainland capped by disappointing Chinese Caixin PMI data and a substantial liquidity drain of CNY 210bln by the PBoC, as well the increased trade tensions after China issued a warning against travelling to the US and held a meeting on rare earths where experts recommended greater controls on exports of the metals.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY weakened towards 97.00 following the dovish comments by Fed Chair Powell that the Fed will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion and he sees a much higher likelihood rates will fall to the effective lower bound in a downturn, as well as the likelihood crisis era tools may be needed again. This lifted the greenback’s major counterparts with EUR/USD mildly supported by optimism after the Italian political situation stabilised in which its Deputy PMs reached an agreement to work together, and with GBP/USD back at the 1.2700 handle. The heightened risk appetite lifted JPY-crosses although USD/JPY has failed to benefit due to the USD weakness and languishes around the 108.00 level. Elsewhere, antipodeans remain firm with NZD/USD underpinned after RBNZ Assistant Governor Hawkesby said the central view is for interest rates to remain broadly around current levels for the foreseeable future and as mixed Australian GDP data for Q1 failed to dent AUD/USD which tests the 0.7000 level to the upside.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices underpinned on the back of the Fed Chair Powell’s dovishness and as Japanese 10yr yields slip to their lowest in nearly 3 years.</p>",
