Facebook (FB) moved higher on the news that over a dozen companies, including Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL) and Uber (UBER) have signed up to back Facebook’s soon to be released cryptocurrency. Tesla (TSLA) moved lower after the electric automaker had an additional request for tariff exemptions rejected by the US government, but went flat on a report from Elektrek suggesting the automaker is on track for a record quarter. Shares of Sony’s ADR (SNE) moved higher after it received a USD 1.5bln investment from hedge fund Third Point, which called on it to spin-off its image sensor arm. Twitter (TWTR) edged higher as the tech sector fell, after the co deleted thousands of accounts tied to Iran and upped its efforts to end false information campaigns. FedEx (FDX) fell after China launched an enquiry into its recent Huawei delivery mistakes. Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) spiked higher on the news the DoJ were nearing approval for the merger, although the DoJ are said to be maintaining their demands for the two to divest assets for the merger to be approved. Verizon (VZ) also spiked higher, on news the telecoms co. is to build a fiber-based distribution network connecting the NBA's 29 arenas. S&amp;P 500 -0.2% at 2887, NASDAQ-100 -0.4% at 7479, Dow Jones -0.1% at 26090.</p><p>A solid batch of data out of the US saw the curve bear-flatten, with shorter-dated yields rising about 2bps (at settle) vs yields on 30s declining by around 1bps. Early trade was defined by risk-off type flows, which led to some concerns that the 10-year yield could breach the 2.00% mark. However, haven trade was usurped by decent fundamentals, with traders reducing bets that the Fed could cut rates next week in wake of the upbeat data. The implied probability of a June rate cut has fallen to around 25% from around 33% on Thursday, while July pricing eased slightly too. However, the TPLEX found buyers after the inflation gauges in the Michigan Sentiment data declined sharply, challenging Fed Chair Powell's view that inflation weakness was transitory, and perhaps giving further credence to the notion that the Fed has grounds to cut based on inflation alone, let alone for \"insurance\" reasons to guard against the fall-out from global trade tensions. At settlement, major curve spreads were narrower to the tune of 2bps. US T-Note futures (M9) settled 2 ticks lower at 126-30.</p>",
