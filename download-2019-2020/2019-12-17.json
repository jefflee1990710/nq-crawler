Furthermore, Trump suggested that this is the time to do it as exports would zoom. (Twitter)</p><p>Fed's Rosengren (non-voter) said additional policy easing is likely unnecessary in the near term and the economy is currently in a good place, which has performed as expected despite recent concerns about slower global growth and trade uncertainty. Rosengren added that an economic downturn is unlikely in 2020 given generally positive economic conditions and the continuation of accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, and assuming no significant negative shock, while he suggested that barring a material change in the outlook, additional policy easing is likely unnecessary in the near term. (Newswires)</p><p>Fed's Kaplan (2020 voter, neutral) said he sees no 2020 rate moves and that appropriate path for policy is for it to stay where it is, while he reiterated the Fed line that it would take a material change in the outlook for him to support a rate cut and stated that risks to the outlook are more balanced vs earlier in the year.

Risk remains supported heading into year-end after the Phase One deal was reached, accommodative central bank policy, bottoming-out of the manufacturing slump and the seasonal factors associated with the holiday season. More immediately, the tier two data in the US was promising, with housing starts beat expectations and building permits, a leading indicator, rising to a twelve-and-a-half-year high. Industrial production was also promising rising 1.1% offsetting the prior month decline of 0.9%. Ranges were thin as desks wind up for the year, and amid analysts citing a lack of scheduled catalysts likely to shake-up the trading complex before the end of the year. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) traded higher today following an upgrade at Morgan Stanley, whilst also benefiting from a California Jury who ruled the company’s talcum powder did not cause cancer. Goldman Sachs (GS) among outperformers in the DJIA following a PT increase at Wells Fargo. Elsewhere, Micron (MU) was upgraded at Morgan Stanley, citing an improved memory pricing environment. Netflix (NFLX) traded in the green after it announced its Asia-Pac business had the largest gains over the past three years, where growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa also accelerated. SPX +0.03% at 3192.52, NDX +0.06% at 8575.70, DJI +0.11% at 28267.16.</p><p>The Treasury curve saw slight bull-steepening on Tuesday, though the magnitude of the moves was not anything to write home about. The complex pared gains after decent data (housing starts/permits, as well as IP/manufacturing output), while desks also continue to cite the US/China phase one deal, while remarks from Fed's Kaplan (who votes in 2020) favoured rates being where they are. Some analysts also observed that Treasury vol in the longer dated part of the curve was the lowest in six months, as desks wind down for the year amid few major catalysts to trade ahead of year-end. T-note (H0) futures settled 1 tick higher at 128-14+.</p>",

More immediately, the tier two data in the US was promising, with housing starts beat expectations and building permits, a leading indicator, rising to a twelve-and-a-half-year high. Industrial production was also promising rising 1.1% offsetting the prior month decline of 0.9%. Ranges were thin as desks wind up for the year, and amid analysts citing a lack of scheduled catalysts likely to shake-up the trading complex before the end of the year. Looking ahead, there are some factors to keep on your radar: House will vote on two articles of impeachment on Wednesday, and will vote on the USMCA deal on Thursday; Thursday also has the BOE, Riksbank and Norges Bank meetings.</p><p><strong>* US/CHINA: </strong>USTR Lighthizer in an FBN interview said the Phase One trade deal was 'totally enforceable' and there was plenty of leverage on both sides to ensure the agreement works. There has been scepticism on the deal, particularly that its enforcement mechanisms were unsubstantial. Lighthizer also reiterated his view that he expects US agricultural sales to China to double overnight. Elsewhere, Politico reported that US officials believe the Phase One deal is enough for now; Phase Two may come ‘sometime’ in 2020; officials happy to embrace the current deal, end the regular threat of tariff escalations and take whatever market and economic bounce they can get. The report added that talks [with China] will continue and the administration would like further concessions from China in order to remove the rest of the existing tariffs; \"few seem to think it’s likely that once this current deal is officially codified, signed and put in effect that talks can lead to a second deal between now and the presidential election.\" Meanwhile in China, SCMP reported Beijing has no plans to launch major fiscal stimulus to boost slowing growth, according to a top economic planning agency; policymakers are increasingly upbeat about economic prospects after a rebound in industrial production last month and the Phase One deal.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> UK PM Johnson's government will add a clause to his Brexit bill, making it illegal for Parliament to extend the transition process beyond the end of 2020 (currently, the deal allows for an extension of up to two-years if mutually agreed with the EU before the end of July 2020). The government's measure would effectively rule out any extension, and analysts said rules out the chances of an early extension, keeping the no deal threat lingering through 2020, and raises the chance of leaving the EU without a deal. Looking ahead, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is due back in front of lawmakers on Friday and is expected to pass easily given the government's new majority.</p><p><strong>* US HOUSING STARTS/BUILDING PERMITS (NOV):</strong> Both saw some upside versus expectations (starts 1.365mln vs 1.345mln expected; permits 1.482mln vs 1.41mln expected). Building permits are a better gauge of future momentum, Oxford Economics notes, and they rose to the highest in 12-and-a-half years, confirming the rebound in residential construction in Q3, the consultancy says. In terms of the breakdown, single-family starts increased 2.4% in November, while multi-family starts rose 4.9%; unusually cold weather might have held down starts in the Midwest, OxEco says.</p><p><strong>* US INDUSTRIAL/MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION (NOV)</strong>: Both surprised to the upside (IP 1.1% M/M vs exp. 0.8%, prev. -0.9%; MP +1.1% vs exp 0.7%, prev. -0.7%). However, analysts warn against inferring that, following declines in three of the last four months, that this is somehow the end of the struggles in the manufacturing sector. Wells Fargo notes the data was driven by upside in the manufacturing output component, which comprises around 75% of industrial activity, seeing the largest monthly rise since Feb 2018 -- Wells says base effects may have played a role and the level of factory output was still down 0.7% annualised. \"The factory sector is not out of the woods, but a step toward détente in the trade war last week and signs of bottoming in other areas — like November's rise in the ISM production component to a 'less-bad' 49.1 — suggest hope for improvement,\" the bank writes.</p><p><strong>* FED:</strong> <strong>Fed's Kaplan</strong> (2020 voter, neutral) sees no 2020 rate moves, saying the appropriate path for policy is for it to stay where it is; a material change to the outlook would be required for him to support a rate cut. Kaplan sees no hikes in 2020 (in line with the FOMC’s median dot); Kaplan’s remarks were very much in line with the FOMC ‘median’. Kaplan was keen to stress that inflation pressures were muted, suggesting a tight labour market can be run without a risk of price rises, globalisation is hampering upward pressures and that he sees persistent muted inflation in 2020. On funding market pressures, Kaplan said the Fed should be “seriously consider” a standing repo facility, adding that the repo market is manageable but the Fed may need to run a larger balance sheet than previously thought; he wants the Fed too also re-examine how it treats Treasuries versus reserves for capital requirements to ease repo pressures. <strong>Fed's Rosengren</strong> (non-voter, hawkish dissenter) said additional policy easing was unnecessary in the near term, and that the economy is currently in a good place, performing as expected, despite recent concerns about slower global growth and trade uncertainty. The Boston Fed President, a noted hawkish dissenter in this year’s cutting cycle, said unemployment will likely fluctuate narrowly around its current rate of 3.5% in 2020 and inflation will be close to the Fed’s 2% target; said the economy has grown at close to 2% annual rate over the past two quarters, as strength in households has offset weaknesses in business investment – and said that pattern is likely to continue, as consumer spending is bolstered by job creation and increases in personal income and wealth.</p><p><strong>* Boeing (BA):</strong> The Dow heavyweight initially opened lower following the confirmation it is to halt production of its 737 Max jet, however, it pared back losses to trade in the green (albeit it is still lower from previous source reports who suggested it was considering cutting or halting the production). Boeing’s current production of the jet is 42 per month, and some estimate its backlog will sit at 400 by the year end. Boeing suppliers such as Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), who manufacture the fuselage, and General Electric (GE), who manufactures the jets in the Max in its JV with Safran (SAF FP) -1.4%, were also hit following the news. Note, when Boeing announced a production cut of the jet to 42 from 52, it cut GE’s quarterly cash flow by USD 400mln. Analysts at Capital Economics highlight the decision to halt production could result in a hit to the manufacturing sector, adding if it continues they expect it to knock up to 0.5ppts annualised off of Q1 GDP if the shutdown lasted for the whole quarter, adding if they do decide to lay off workers or workers become furloughed (against the company’s initial statement) the damage could be even worse.</p><p><strong>* ECB:</strong> <strong>ECB's Rehn</strong> said regenerative monetary policy is expected to continue until inflation expectations return clearly close enough to 2% and until its effects can also be seen in core inflation. <strong>ECB’s Muller</strong> also said on inflation, the ECB should have flexibility around the inflation target and should consider a band around the objective. <strong>ECB's Kazimir</strong> said that the ECB’s mandate is clear regarding inflation and that it is ready to discuss all topics, there are no taboos. Kazimir nodded to fiscal policy, saying that better coordination of monetary and fiscal policies is needed, or else Eurozone will not see significant structural recovery soon.</p><p><strong>* T-NOTE (H0) FUTURES SETTLED 1 TICK HIGHER AT 128-14+. </strong>The Treasury curve saw slight bull-steepening on Tuesday, though the magnitude of the moves was not anything to write home about. The complex pared gains after decent data (housing starts/permits, as well as IP/manufacturing output), while desks also continue to cite the US/China phase one deal, while remarks from Fed's Kaplan (who votes in 2020) favoured rates being where they are. Some analysts also observed that Treasury vol in the longer dated part of the curve was the lowest in six months, as desks wind down for the year amid few major catalysts to trade ahead of year-end.</p><p><strong>* WTI (G0) SETTLES USD 0.73 HIGHER AT USD 60.87/BBL; BRENT (G0) SETTLES USD 0.76 HIGHER AT USD 66.10/BBL. </strong>Oil prices found a stronger bid than Monday, perhaps catching up to the equity rally and also finding support from the wider zeitgeist; 'Phase One' trade deal with China looks done, global manufacturing woes seem to be bottoming, and OPEC is set to cut supply further. US data has also been supportive on Tuesday, with building permits – a leading indicator – reaching cycle highs, giving a nod to growth, while industrial and manufacturing production was better than expected. Citigroup’s energy analysts note that they are seeing further reaction to the record high Chinese crude export data released a week ago, too. Meanwhile, participants could be getting long ahead of crude inventories this week, with APIs reporting on Tuesday evening, where crude stocks are seen drawing 1.3mln, gasoline is seen building 2.2mln, and distillates are forecast to build by 300k.</p><p><strong>SPX +0.03% at 3192.52, MDX +0.06% at 8575.70, DJI +0.11% at 28267.16; </strong>SECTORS: Consumer Discretionary +0.55%, Financials +0.49%, Utilities +0.24%, Materials +0.18%, Telecommunication Services +0.01%, Communication Services +0.00%, Energy -0.04%, Industrials -0.07%, Consumer Staples -0.07%, Health Care -0.09%, Information Technology -0.17%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) traded higher today following an upgrade at Morgan Stanley, whilst also benefiting from a California Jury who ruled the company’s talcum powder did not cause cancer. Goldman Sachs (GS) among outperformers in the DJIA following a PT increase at Wells Fargo. Elsewhere, Micron (MU) was upgraded at Morgan Stanley, citing an improved memory pricing environment. Netflix (NFLX) traded in the green after it announced its Asia-Pac business had the largest gains over the past three years, where growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa also accelerated. Procter and Gamble (PG) were pressured after Anglo-Dutch competitor Unilever (ULVR LN) issued a sales warning, noting it is going to miss its 2019 sales growth guidance; RBC notes Unilever has put the blame on to the market, although the bank believes there is more to it. RBC believes Unilever needs to increase its investment levels, even if it is to impact margins. Eli Lilly (LLY) traded higher after it provided guidance for EPS and revenue above analyst expectations. Roku (ROKU) traded in the red after its CFO, Steve Louder, resigned. Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY) traded higher after its new CEO removed six senior executives as he narrows and change the leadership team.</p><p><strong>* M&amp;A:</strong> Peugeot (UG FP) owners PSA Group board is reportedly set to approve the merger with Fiat Chrysler (FCA IM, FCAU), according to sources. Stateside, the acquisition Spark therapeutics (ONCE) by Roche (ROGN SW) has been completed, after it received US antitrust approval. LogMeIn (LOGM) traded 4% higher after Elliott Management partnered with Francisco Partners to take the company private; the deal has an equity value of USD 4.3bln at 86.05/shr, up from yesterday’s close of USD 82.41. AMC Entertainment (AMC) lost its top spot as North America’s largest movie theatre operator as Britain’s Cineworld, who owns Regal, struck a deal to purchase Canada’s Cineplex for USD 1.65bln.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> traded in thin ranges, but the Dollar Index managed to stay above the 97.00 figure, finding resistance at 97.30 as the buck managed to find a tailwind from tier 2 data which saw industrial production pare back the prior months decline, with a stronger than expected manufacturing output. IBD/TIPP economic optimism was also supportive, as was housing data. <strong>GBP</strong> underperformed, and Cable is on course for its largest daily loss since November 2018, seeing the cross return to pre-election levels. Sterling woes derived following reports that UK PM Johnson is to put into law a bill which would remove any chance of a Brexit extension beyond the end of 2020, where many have stated that one year to strike a trade deal with the EU was ambitious, reigniting No-Deal Brexit worries. Havens were mixed, <strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>XAU</strong> traded flat against the greenback and CHF was slightly firmer. <strong>USDJPY</strong> traded in a tight range between 109.45-63 parameters with technicians eyeing 109.27-22 as a minor Fibo, plus to keep an eye on large option expiries on Friday at 109.50. <strong>XAU</strong> also traded within a very tight 4 buck range, with desks noting how the yellow metal is holding up despite the mitigating geopolitical/trade risks. Antipodes traded weaker today, with <strong>AUD</strong> taking its cues after a dovish RBA minutes which only strengthened the case for a February cut. <strong>NZD</strong> also weaker in suit with its Aussie counterpart although to a lesser extent amid an improved business outlook, although the data remained in negative territory; once again, no impact was seen from the GDT auction results. <strong>EMFX</strong> was generally flat/weaker with weakness observed in the <strong>TRY</strong> as it continues to decline as participants await any further repercussions from the closing of two US air bases. <strong>MXN</strong> traded flat against the buck as participants eye any further USMCA updates, plus the Banxico rate decision on Thursday, where analysts expect a 25bp cut; <strong>BRL</strong> also flat. The <strong>ARS</strong> was an outlier today as the economy minister announced it would introduce a 30% tax on foreign currency purchases which helped buoy the Peso.</p><p><strong>* UK LABOUR MARKET DATA (OCT/NOV):</strong> A mixed labour report saw employment rise by 24k (expected -10k), the jobless rate remain at 3.8% (expected 3.9%), ex-bonus earnings fell to 3.5% from 3.6% (but short not to expected 3.4%); however, the measure of earnings including bonuses fell to 3.2% from 3.7% (expected 3.4%), while the claimant count rose by more than expected (28.8k vs expected 24.5k). \"They're volatile numbers, so much so that they are not even officially considered national statistics,\" noting that total pay, including bonuses, slipped to 2.4%, the lowest since June 2018, and even regular pay slipped to 3.2% from 3.6%, the lowest since March. \"Ordinarily you could ignore this but with the Bank of England having expressed concern about nascent weakness in the labour market, it becomes more relevant.\"</p><p><strong>* RBA MINUTES:</strong> Minutes revealed the RBA will \"reassess\" its policy stance in February and was \"prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed\". It also appears that the RBA is not concerned about the impact of further loosening; in November, the Board said it recognised the negative effects of lower interest rates on savers and confidence and that a further reduction in rates could have a different effect on confidence than in the past, but in the latest minutes, it stated \"the impact of these effects [negative confidence] was unlikely to outweigh the stimulus to the economy of lower interest rates\". Westpac said the minutes strengthened its view that the central bank would be comfortable lowering rates at its Feb confab by 25bps to 0.50%, adding that the tone of incoming data over the next six weeks will shape the RBA's decision, particularly the labour market data, retail sales and confidence measures. The RBA noted that \"economic growth and the unemployment rate remain broadly consistent with the forecasts, but members agreed that it will be concerning if there were a deterioration in the outlook\". Money market pricing for an RBA February cut rose a touch, with the implied probability of a cut sitting at around 56% in wake of the minutes.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding several considerably worse off currency counterparts, the Dollar was floundering ahead of the first of a trio of US releases (housing starts/building permits, ip/manufacturing output and JOLTS) that appear to have drawn a line in the sand for the Dollar, if not quite stopped the rot altogether. Indeed, the <strong>DXY</strong> is maintaining 97.000+ status, albeit just within a 97.022-303 range amidst and ahead of Fed speak and following yet another interjection from President Trump urging the FOMC to cut rates further and restart QE.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>The major underperformer all day due to renewed jitters about Britain leaving the EU with no deal given UK PM Johnson’s determination to stick to the December 2020 Brexit transition timetable rather than delay the deadline via a change to the WAB legislation that will be put to MPs on Friday. Cable is just off fresh post-election lows circa 1.3125, while Eur/Gbp has retraced all the way back up to 0.8500 from sub-0.8300 at one stage, with hardly any support from mixed labour/wage metrics.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Dovish RBA minutes have kept the Aussie under pressure around 0.6850 vs the Greenback and between 1.0435-00 on the wide against the Kiwi that derived some comfort from a more upbeat or less downbeat ANZ business survey overnight in contrast. Nzd/Usd has lost grip of the 0.6600 handle, but containing losses to 0.6565 event though the latest NZ GDT auction saw hefty declines in dairy and wmp prices.</p><p><strong>CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>Relative G10 winners, though not without a few wobbles, as the Franc rebounds to test 0.9800 from nearer 0.9850 at one stage and the Euro holds 1.1150 and close to the 200 DMA vs the Buck after toughing 1.1130 and 1.1175 in choppy festive trading conditions.</p><p><strong>JPY/CAD</strong></p><p>Both narrowly mixed against their US peer, but with the Yen especially restrained inside 108.47-63 parameters compared to the Loonie that printed 1.3145 and 1.3185 highs and lows, while shrugging off more dire Canadian data, but perhaps benefiting from a bounce in crude prices pre-API having decoupled from oil of late.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Another day of woe and depreciation for the Lira awaiting repercussions from the latest deterioration in Turkish-US relations, but the Argentine Peso did get a reprieve from Government policy moves to support the economy and currency via a growth package and 30% tax on foreign currency purchases. Elsewhere, hardly any reaction from the Real or Hungarian Forint to BCB minutes and the NBH rate call that was unchanged as anticipated, although the Bank retained an easing bias despite lifting or reaffirming CPI and GDP estimates.</p>",

(+1.3%)</strong> rallied due to trade optimism and after local press reports suggested the potential for 2 targeted RRR cuts by the PBoC next year, although both were initially kept tepid by continued PBoC liquidity inaction and as China remained tight-lipped regarding agriculture purchase commitments. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued after spillover selling from USTs, with demand dampened by gains in stocks and after the 20yr JGB auction which pointed to showed results across all metrics.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>A mostly downbeat session for European equities thus far</strong> following on from a somewhat optimism APAC session, which saw Chinese bourses outperform on trade optimism and fresh-record tailwinds State-side. Europe’s bellwether - Euro Stoxx 50 (-0.7%) is largely weighed on by heavyweight Unilever (-5.8%) whose shares slumped amid a profit warning, with the company citing “challenges in certain markets”. Thus, the consumer staples sector (-1.7%) is seeing significant underperformance vs. its peers. DAX (-0.9%) underperforms vs the regions with a bulk of the losses attributed to downside in SAP (-3.5%) in light of a negative broker move at BofA. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 (Unch) attempts to balance downside in Sterling with more a pronounced risk of a cliff-edge Brexit - after reports that PM Johnson is attempting to outlaw another extension beyond Dec 2020. UK Homebuilders have reverse a bulk of their post-election poll gains whilst banks mostly fail to benefit from BoE’s stress test green-light, which saw HSBC (+0.9%), Barclays (-3.2%), Lloyds (-4.7%), RBS (-2.0%) and Standard Chartered (+1.0%) all pass – albeit HSBC and Standard Chartered are less exposed to the UK given their overseas operations. Elsewhere, Airbus (+0.5%) benefits following Boeing’s (-1.3% pre-market) announcement that it is to freeze 737 Max production in January. That said, aero supplier Safran (-3.6%) alongside airline names suffer: easyJet (-4.3%), Ryanair (-3.1%), IAG (-2.5%), with the latter side-lining news that British Airways pilots agreed to back a revised pay off to end strikes. Last but not least, FTSE-listed NMC Health (-14.9%) plumbed the depth after activist short-seller Muddy Waters noted of serious doubt regarding the company’s financial statement, its asset values, cash balance, reported profits, and reported debt levels.</p><p><strong>Boeing (BA) – </strong>Co. announced it is to freeze 737 Max production in January. Co. said no furlough or lay-offs are expected at this time amid suspension of production. Co. said it will provide financial information regarding production suspension in connection with Q4 2019 earnings release in early. Co. shares are down 2.0% pre-market. (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>GBP - Sterling has given up more of its GE-related gains as attention switches back to Brexit and the risk that a no deal departure from the EU could yet unfold if UK PM Johnson manages to prevent parliament from seeking an extension to the transition phase alongside the WAB motion that will be presented to the HoC on Friday. Cable retreated further from last week’s lofty 1.3500+ pinnacle through Monday’s session low before tripping stops on a break of 1.3200 and testing post-election result/exit poll levels circa 1.3159 that roughly align with a Fib retracement of the whole relief rally from voting day trough to peak. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp extended its rebound to around 0.8470 from close to 0.8300 at one stage yesterday and under the big figure when the Pound hit aforementioned heights after the landslide Tory win. Note, some solace via the latest jobs data even though the claimant count and headline AWE were both weaker than forecast.</p><p>AUD/NZD/CAD - The Aussie is underperforming on the back of latest RBA minutes underscoring a willingness to ease further if necessary and flagging a full assessment of the situation at the next policy meeting in February 2020. Aud/Usd has recoiled to just below 0.6850 and Aud/Nzd is back under 1.0450 as Nzd/Usd holds up a tad better between 0.6570-0.6605 in wake of another improvement in NZ business sentiment and expections on top of the Kiwi supportive cross flows. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost momentum and slipped through 1.3150 ahead of Canadian manufacturing sales, and as the Greenback attempts to form a base, albeit at the expense of others, with the DXY hovering above 97.000 in a 97.058-303 band.</p><p>EUR/CHF/JPY - All narrowly mixed against the Dollar, as Eur/Usd meanders from 1.1130 to 1.1160, Usd/Chf idles within 0.9820-45 extremes and Usd/Jpy remains anchored to 108.50 with rallies confined or capped ahead of early month highs/near double top resistance.</p><p>NOK/SEK - Not quite all change, but a distinct turnaround in fortunes for the Scandi Crowns that started Norges Bank and Riksbank meeting week in the ascendency. Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek have both bounced after testing, but not breaking chart support back towards 10.0900 and 10.4800 respectively.</p><p>RBA Minutes from the December meeting stated the board agreed it is important to reassess the economic outlook at the February meeting and that it has the ability to add further stimulus if needed and is ready to ease again if required. Furthermore, RBA reiterated the economy appears to have reached a gentle turning point but noted that persistently low growth in household income is a source of concern and that current wage growth is not fast enough to reach inflation and consumption goals, while it also stated consumers are increasingly gloomy on the economy and media coverage is also more negative.

However, trade is typically erratic for seasonal reasons and turnover light, as Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries stand firm, albeit shy of their intraday peaks (172.29, 131.99 and 128-23 respectively) and Monday’s marginally higher session bests as the focus switches to a decent 2nd half line-up (on paper at least) including data, Fed and ECB speakers plus API crude/product inventories.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are contained within tight intraday ranges of around USD 0.5/bbl with little to report by way of fresh fundamental catalysts for the complex. Brexit-risk aside, the broader sentiment in the markets remains positive given the developments in the US-Sino sphere. ING notes that constructive energy fundamentals – including declining inventories – is reflected in the ICE Brent time spread, but they continue to meander deep in backwardation. “We expect downward pressure on oil prices to resume as we move into 1H20”, ING says, but the forecast remains contingent on the Phase One trade deal details alongside OPEC+ action to tackle surplus. In terms of commentary, JP Morgan raised Brent crude 2020 price forecast to USD 64.50/bbl from USD 59.00/bbl but sees prices in 2021 at USD 61.50/bbl, while it expects WTI prices averaging USD 60.00/bbl in 2020 and USD 57.50/bbl in 2021. Looking ahead, tonight’s weekly API report is expected to show crude stocks declining by 1.75mln barrels over the last week, whilst in terms of products, gasoline stocks are forecast to build by 2mln barrels and distillates to draw by 500k barrels. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> has seen some support in decent trade which coincided with downside in stocks. The yellow metal sees modest intraday gains but remains below recent resistance at USD 1480/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> prices remain rangebound around the USD 2.80/lb, although modest downside in the red metal coincided with the release of China’s refined copper output which rose 19.6% Y/Y, hitting record highs. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> declined almost 3.0%, slipping for a second straight session amid rising shipments from large miners - Australian and Brazilian shipments rose 22.15mln tonnes last week, +462k tonnes W/W.</p><p>JP Morgan raised Brent crude 2020 price forecast to USD 64.50/bbl (Prev. USD 59.00/bbl) but sees prices in 2021 at USD 61.50/bbl, while it expects WTI prices averaging USD 60.00/bbl in 2020 and USD 57.50/bbl in 2021.

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/23487/download\">here</a> If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal. To subscribe simply check the box next to \"Email these reports\" under the desired category.</p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p>A mostly downbeat session for European equities thus far following on from a somewhat optimism APAC session, which saw Chinese bourses outperform on trade optimism and fresh-record tailwinds State-side. Europe’s bellwether - Euro Stoxx 50 (-0.7%) is largely weighed on by heavyweight Unilever (-5.8%) whose shares slumped amid a profit warning, with the company citing “challenges in certain markets”. Thus, the consumer staples sector (-1.7%) is seeing significant underperformance vs. its peers. DAX (-0.9%) underperforms vs the regions with a bulk of the losses attributed to downside in SAP (-3.5%) in light of a negative broker move at BofA. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 (Unch) attempts to balance downside in Sterling with more a pronounced risk of a cliff-edge Brexit - after reports that PM Johnson is attempting to outlaw another extension beyond Dec 2020. UK Homebuilders have reverse a bulk of their post-election poll gains whilst banks mostly fail to benefit from BoE’s stress test green-light, which saw HSBC (+0.9%), Barclays (-3.2%), Lloyds (-4.7%), RBS (-2.0%) and Standard Chartered (+1.0%) all pass – albeit HSBC and Standard Chartered are less exposed to the UK given their overseas operations. Elsewhere, Airbus (+0.5%) benefits following Boeing’s (-1.3% pre-market) announcement that it is to freeze 737 Max production in January. That said, aero supplier Safran (-3.6%) alongside airline names suffer: easyJet (-4.3%), Ryanair (-3.1%), IAG (-2.5%), with the latter side-lining news that British Airways pilots agreed to back a revised pay off to end strikes. Last but not least, FTSE-listed NMC Health (-14.9%) plumbed the depth after activist short-seller Muddy Waters noted of serious doubt regarding the company’s financial statement, its asset values, cash balance, reported profits, and reported debt levels.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>GBP - Sterling has given up more of its GE-related gains as attention switches back to Brexit and the risk that a no deal departure from the EU could yet unfold if UK PM Johnson manages to prevent parliament from seeking an extension to the transition phase alongside the WAB motion that will be presented to the HoC on Friday. Cable retreated further from last week’s lofty 1.3500+ pinnacle through Monday’s session low before tripping stops on a break of 1.3200 and testing post-election result/exit poll levels circa 1.3159 that roughly align with a Fib retracement of the whole relief rally from voting day trough to peak. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp extended its rebound to around 0.8470 from close to 0.8300 at one stage yesterday and under the big figure when the Pound hit aforementioned heights after the landslide Tory win. Note, some solace via the latest jobs data even though the claimant count and headline AWE were both weaker than forecast.</p><p>AUD/NZD/CAD - The Aussie is underperforming on the back of latest RBA minutes underscoring a willingness to ease further if necessary and flagging a full assessment of the situation at the next policy meeting in February 2020. Aud/Usd has recoiled to just below 0.6850 and Aud/Nzd is back under 1.0450 as Nzd/Usd holds up a tad better between 0.6570-0.6605 in wake of another improvement in NZ business sentiment and expections on top of the Kiwi supportive cross flows. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost momentum and slipped through 1.3150 ahead of Canadian manufacturing sales, and as the Greenback attempts to form a base, albeit at the expense of others, with the DXY hovering above 97.000 in a 97.058-303 band.</p><p>EUR/CHF/JPY - All narrowly mixed against the Dollar, as Eur/Usd meanders from 1.1130 to 1.1160, Usd/Chf idles within 0.9820-45 extremes and Usd/Jpy remains anchored to 108.50 with rallies confined or capped ahead of early month highs/near double top resistance.</p><p>NOK/SEK - Not quite all change, but a distinct turnaround in fortunes for the Scandi Crowns that started Norges Bank and Riksbank meeting week in the ascendency. Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek have both bounced after testing, but not breaking chart support back towards 10.0900 and 10.4800 respectively.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p>Debt futures remain in recovery mode after yesterday’s fall from grace at the hands of a rally in risk assets partly positional for the looming year end and perhaps belatedly or on a 2nd take of the US-China phase 1 trade deal. However, trade is typically erratic for seasonal reasons and turnover light, as Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries stand firm, albeit shy of their intraday peaks (172.29, 131.99 and 128-23 respectively) and Monday’s marginally higher session bests as the focus switches to a decent 2nd half line-up (on paper at least) including data, Fed and ECB speakers plus API crude/product inventories.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> futures are contained within tight intraday ranges of around USD 0.5/bbl with little to report by way of fresh fundamental catalysts for the complex. Brexit-risk aside, the broader sentiment in the markets remains positive given the developments in the US-Sino sphere. ING notes that constructive energy fundamentals – including declining inventories – is reflected in the ICE Brent time spread, but they continue to meander deep in backwardation. “We expect downward pressure on oil prices to resume as we move into 1H20”, ING says, but the forecast remains contingent on the Phase One trade deal details alongside OPEC+ action to tackle surplus. In terms of commentary, JP Morgan raised Brent crude 2020 price forecast to USD 64.50/bbl from USD 59.00/bbl but sees prices in 2021 at USD 61.50/bbl, while it expects WTI prices averaging USD 60.00/bbl in 2020 and USD 57.50/bbl in 2021. Looking ahead, tonight’s weekly API report is expected to show crude stocks declining by 1.75mln barrels over the last week, whilst in terms of products, gasoline stocks are forecast to build by 2mln barrels and distillates to draw by 500k barrels. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> has seen some support in decent trade which coincided with downside in stocks. The yellow metal sees modest intraday gains but remains below recent resistance at USD 1480/oz. <strong>Copper</strong> prices remain rangebound around the USD 2.80/lb, although modest downside in the red metal coincided with the release of China’s refined copper output which rose 19.6% Y/Y, hitting record highs. Finally, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> declined almost 3.0%, slipping for a second straight session amid rising shipments from large miners - Australian and Brazilian shipments rose 22.15mln tonnes last week, +462k tonnes W/W.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Sterling has given up more of its GE-related gains as attention switches back to Brexit and the risk that a no deal departure from the EU could yet unfold if UK PM Johnson manages to prevent parliament from seeking an extension to the transition phase alongside the WAB motion that will be presented to the HoC on Friday. Cable retreated further from last week’s lofty 1.3500+ pinnacle through Monday’s session low before tripping stops on a break of 1.3200 and testing post-election result/exit poll levels circa 1.3159 that roughly align with a Fib retracement of the whole relief rally from voting day trough to peak. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp extended its rebound to around 0.8470 from close to 0.8300 at one stage yesterday and under the big figure when the Pound hit aforementioned heights after the landslide Tory win. Note, some solace via the latest jobs data even though the claimant count and headline AWE were both weaker than forecast.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Aussie is underperforming on the back of latest RBA minutes underscoring a willingness to ease further if necessary and flagging a full assessment of the situation at the next policy meeting in February 2020. Aud/Usd has recoiled to just below 0.6850 and Aud/Nzd is back under 1.0450 as Nzd/Usd holds up a tad better between 0.6570-0.6605 in wake of another improvement in NZ business sentiment and expections on top of the Kiwi supportive cross flows. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost momentum and slipped through 1.3150 ahead of Canadian manufacturing sales, and as the Greenback attempts to form a base, albeit at the expense of others, with the <strong>DXY</strong> hovering above 97.000 in a 97.058-303 band.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All narrowly mixed against the Dollar, as Eur/Usd meanders from 1.1130 to 1.1160, Usd/Chf idles within 0.9820-45 extremes and Usd/Jpy remains anchored to 108.50 with rallies confined or capped ahead of early month highs/near double top resistance.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Not quite all change, but a distinct turnaround in fortunes for the Scandi Crowns that started Norges Bank and Riksbank meeting week in the ascendency. Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek have both bounced after testing, but not breaking chart support back towards 10.0900 and 10.4800 respectively.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>FX </strong>In FX markets, the <strong>DXY</strong> edged marginal gains above 97.00 helped by strong NAHB data, a recent increase in yields and weakness across most its counterparts, in particular <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> which broke down Monday’s support at 1.3320 and then tripped stops through the 1.3300 level amid reports PM Johnson will legislate to rule out an extension of the EU transition period. This was said to place the prospects of a no-deal more firmly on the table, with the pressure in the currency also exacerbated by cross-related flows in which <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>GBP</strong> briefly surged above 0.8400 and <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> gave up 146.00. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was contained within the prior day’s tight ranges owing to resistance at 1.1150 and following the bloc’s recent soft PMI releases, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses have pulled back from the prior day’s best levels, while <strong>antipodeans</strong> were also lacklustre with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> pressured following the RBA meeting minutes in which the central bank reiterated it has the ability to add further stimulus if needed and is ready to ease again if required. The RBA also noted persistently low growth in household income is a source of concern and that current wage growth was not fast enough to reach inflation and consumption goals, which AMP cited as a dovish release and therefore see the RBA cutting rates at the next meeting in February.</p><p>RBA Minutes from the December meeting stated the board agreed it is important to reassess the economic outlook at the February meeting and that it has the ability to add further stimulus if needed and is ready to ease again if required. Furthermore, RBA reiterated the economy appears to have reached a gentle turning point but noted that persistently low growth in household income is a source of concern and that current wage growth is not fast enough to reach inflation and consumption goals, while it also stated consumers are increasingly gloomy on the economy and media coverage is also more negative.

Desks noted the move was exacerbated by a multi-month, record size, equity buy programme, leading to speculative selling in the belly to long end; a chunky block steepener was recorded, with 26.7k TUH contracts bid and 5.3k USH contracts offered. By settlement the 10-year yield was just shy of 1.9%, up over 6bps on the session, whilst the 2-year yield rose just 4% to 1.64%, seeing the 2s10s widen over 2.5bps; the 2s30s widened a less pronounced ~1.7bps.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as the region takes mild impetus from the gains on Wall St where all major indices notched fresh record highs once again due to the recent trade developments and in which desks also noted a large equity buy programme helping to spur the pre-Christmas rally. ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) are both kept afloat but with the advances in Australia limited by weakness in financials and Westpac shares after APRA announced it is launching an investigation into the big 4 bank related to AUSTRAC breeches and doubled its capital requirement add-ons to AUD 1bln, while upside in Tokyo is also restricted by a pullback in JPY-crosses. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) conform to the upbeat tone amid trade optimism and with local press reports suggesting a potential 2 targeted RRR cuts for China next year, although the gains are kept tepid by continued PBoC liquidity inaction and as China remains tight-lipped regarding agriculture purchase commitments.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY has edged mild gains back above the 97.00 level helped by strong NAHB data, a recent increase in yields and weakness across most its counterparts. In particular, GBP/USD broke down Monday’s support at 1.3320 and then tripped stops through the 1.3300 level amid reports PM Johnson will legislate to rule out an extension of the EU transition period which is said to place the prospects of a no-deal on the table, with the pressure also exacerbated by cross-related flows in which EUR/GBP briefly surged above 0.8400 and GBP/JPY gave up the 146.00 handle. Elsewhere, EUR/USD is contained within the prior day’s tight ranges owing to resistance at 1.1150 and following the bloc’s recent soft Manufacturing PMI releases, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses have pulled back from the prior day’s best levels, while antipodeans are also lacklustre with AUD/USD gradually pressured following the RBA meeting minutes in which the central bank reiterated it has the ability to add further stimulus if needed and is ready to ease again if required. The RBA also noted persistently low growth in household income is a source of concern and that current wage growth was not fast enough to reach inflation and consumption goals, which AMP viewed as a dovish release and therefore see the RBA cutting rates at the next meeting in February.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued after spillover selling from USTs as demand is dampened by the modest gains in stocks and with participants sidelined ahead of a 20yr JGB auction.</p>",
