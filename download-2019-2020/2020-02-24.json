Curve spreads were more modestly changed, however. Growing expectations of sooner than previously expected Fed policy easing is likely supporting the front-end (market pricing has more than 50bps of cuts through year-end) just as much as growth concerns/haven flows keep duration supported. The front-to-belly is also being strongly supported in face of large Treasury supply this week (USD 113bln across 2s, 5s, and 7s), clearly not something that is dissuading investors. By settlement 10-year yield had fallen 9bps to 1.379%, while the 2-year had fallen 8.5bps, leaving the 2s10s spread at 11.5bps.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: SPX -3.35% at 3226, NDQ -3.89% at 9080, DJIA -3.56% at 27,961 </strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: Amid the COVID-19 induced risk aversion, gold miners (NEM, KL, GOLD) made gains, whilst China-exposed stocks, such as casinos (WYNN, LVS, MLCO), cruise liners (NCLH, RCL, CCL), airlines (DAL, UAL, AAL), semiconductors (SOX, MU, AMD, NVDA, INTC), and Chinese ADRs (BIDU, BABA, JD), all traded acutely lower amid the wider negative market breadth. The energy sector (XOP, XLE) was the worst performing amid the sharp losses in the crude benchmarks. Financials (XLF, BKX) also underperformed on lower Treasury yields.

Speakers: Fed’s Kaplan, Clarida; ECB’s de Cos; BoC’s Lane. Auctions: US 2-year Note. Earnings: HD, HPQ, M, AMT, CPB. Option Expiries: Brent (J0), XAU (H0).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>* MARKET WRAP:</strong> A large risk-off wave swept across major assets on Monday, where equity and crude futures gapped lower on the open, whilst the T-Note and XAU gapped higher, and continued to move in such directions throughout Monday’s session. The ominous start to the week was exacerbated by the growing cases and deaths reported over the weekend, particularly South Korea and Italy, of COVID-19, and concern on how well contained it actually is, in addition to a slew official commentary on the likely detrimental economic impacts that will fester. The pessimism saw the SPX post its largest percentage loss since February 2018 (some draw attention to last Friday’s opex as removing some of the market’s support), crude reversing a large amount of recent gains, gold near the 1,700 handle - albeit significantly off that into the latter part of the session – and the 10-year yield making lows of 1.352%. The data sheet for the week is relatively light in the US, with durable goods and regional Fed surveys the highlight, although as the COVID-19 outbreak maintains the narrative, participants are likely to look past any strong data as not representative of the potential economic impact yet to be felt.</p><p><strong>* VIRUS:</strong> Traders' primary focus now is how quickly the virus can be contained. While the IMF slashed its China 2020 growth forecast to 5.6%, from its 6.0% estimate made in January (and global growth was cut by just one-tenth to 3.2% in 2020), Chinese policymakers have talked of recovery. PBOC deputy governor Chen Yulu on the weekend said China is likely to pick up quickly after the coronavirus is contained and stage a 'V-shaped' recovery, while China President Xi has said the government will step up support measures to help achieve its targets for 2020. However, it is events outside of China which are causing alarm, with the number of cases spiking in South Korea, while closer to home in Italy, there are seven confirmed deaths as a result of the virus.</p><p><strong>* G20:</strong> G20 finance leaders said global economic growth remains slow and downside risks to the outlook persist, including those arising from geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty, and pledged to enhance global risk monitoring, including of the recent outbreak of COVID-19. Leaders said they stand ready to take further action to address these risks, though provided little detail. However, they were comforted by signs of stabilisation at the end of 2019, and global growth is expected to pick up modestly this year and next, and the recovery is to be supported by the continuation of accommodative financial conditions and some signs of easing trade tensions.</p><p><strong>* GLOBAL TRADE:</strong> G20 leaders did not make progress on a global tax regime for international tech giants. The US has said such a tax would unfairly target US tech firms. The EU have said that the US 'safe harbor' proposition would allow tech giants to 'opt out' of the tax. If no agreement can be struck by the end of the year, European nations have signalled they will go ahead with a tax on revenues of global tech firms, which threatens to exacerbate trade tensions between the EU and US.</p><p><strong>* DEMOCRAT PRIMARIES:</strong> Extreme-left candidate Bernie Sanders delivered an emphatic win in the Nevada caucuses, performing better than poll averages implied. Sanders took 46% of the vote; former VP Joe Biden 19.6%, Pete Buttigieg 15.3%, Sen Elizabeth Warren 10.1%, Sen Amy Klobuchar 4.8%; Michael Bloomberg will first appear on the 3/March Super Tuesday ballots. A CBS News/YouGov national poll running through Satursday 22/Feb has Sanders on 28% (vs poll average of 29.3%), Biden on 17% (vs 17.2%), Warren on 19% (vs 13.2%), Bloomberg on 13% (vs 15.3%), Butiigieg on 10% (vs 9.8%) and Klobuchar on 5% (vs 6.3%). Biden's performance in second still leaves much to be desired from his campaign, and if he is to stand a chance in winning the Democrat nomination, will need to win in South Carolina Primary on Saturday ahead of Super Tuesday on 3rd March. Buttigieg continue to be among the top performers, although he has not shown signs of broadening his appeal among minorities (and South Carolina is quite a diverse state). Warren's campaign is languishing, although she has recently secured funding allowing her to focus on Super Tuesday and buying ads across the nation. Klobuchar is flagging. Sanders' lead may inject urgency into more centrist candidates/voters, so watch how Biden and Bloomberg perform in polls ahead. Of Trump, Biden, Bloomberg and Sanders, Sanders is considered the market unfriendly candidate, whereas Trump, Biden or Bloomberg are likely to be received well.</p><p><strong>* DALLAS FED (FEB): </strong>The Dallas Fed manufacturing data was the latest to top expectations, rising six points to 16.4; it follows rises in the Empire and Philly Fed manufacturing surveys last week. However, some note that there are not many regional Fed surveys based on the West Coast, which is said to be more exposed to the covid-19 outbreak. Accordingly, some analysts are placing greater emphasis on the Markit gauge of PMI activity, released last Friday, which was very soft. With that said, the Fed has been talking about a bottom in manufacturing, so traders will look to the other regional surveys this week (Richmond, Kansas City) ahead of the manufacturing ISM on 2nd March.</p><p><strong>* WTI (J20) SETTLED USD 1.95 LOWER AT USD 51.43/BBL; BRENT (J20) SETTLED USD 2.20 LOWER AT USD 56.30/BBL:</strong> Energy markets were heavily offered alongside other risk assets as the COVID-19 outbreak worsened. The crude benchmarks gapped lower on the opening and continued their demise through till settlement. Oil remains particularly vulnerable to the virus, its position as somewhat of a proxy for both risk appetite and global growth makes it such, and thus, as concerns continue to rise of the potential for a sustained economic downturn, the energy complex will continue to experience reduced demand. Supply has had little attention on Monday, although this week’s US energy inventories could change that, current expectations (bbls) have crude +2.5mln, Distillates -1.8mln and Gasoline -2.2mln.</p><p><strong>* FEDSPEAK:</strong> Fed's Mester (voter, hawk) reiterated monetary policy in the US is well calibrated, although noted there are risks to US outlook including the impact of nCoV but she expects the US economy to continue to perform well. Her 2020 outlook is for the expansion to continue with growth around trend level with a solid labour market and low and stable inflation. Mester noted the Q419 consumer spending slowdown is not troubling and sees PCE inflation returning to the Fed’s 2% target gradually over the next year or two. On rate cuts, she does not at this time support cutting rates to spur a faster return to its inflation goal but noted the Fed should be particularly attuned to financial market developments in the current environment. Fed pricing today amid coronavirus worries is currently pricing in 55bps worth of easing by year end. However, the pricing is derived from bond prices thus any comments on the matter will be eyed in upcoming Fed speech. Note, Clarida last week noted he prefers to look at what the banks are expecting for a market gauge of rate cuts, not market pricing.</p><p><strong>* US-T-NOTE FUTURES (H20) SETTLE 25+ TICKS HIGHER AT 132-21. </strong>The TPLEX was bid throughout the session, in fitting with the wide risk aversion. Curve spreads were more modestly changed, however. Growing expectations of sooner than previously expected Fed policy easing is likely supporting the front-end (market pricing has more than 50bps of cuts through year-end) just as much as growth concerns/haven flows keep duration supported. The front-to-belly is also being strongly supported in face of large Treasury supply this week (USD 113bln across 2s, 5s, and 7s), clearly not something that is dissuading investors. By settlement 10-year yield had fallen 9bps to 1.379%, while the 2-year had fallen 8.5bps, leaving the 2s10s spread at 11.5bps.</p><p><strong>* THIS WEEK'S SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury will this week auction a new 2-year note (40bln, Tue), a new 5-year note (USD 41bln, Wed) and a new 7-year note (USD 32bln, Thu). UBS notes there will be USD 91bln of cashflows this week (Ex SOMA), including around USD 82bln of redemptions, and USD 9bln of coupons, implying supply of around USD 22bln.</p><p><strong>* CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -3.35% at 3226, NDQ -3.89% at 9080, DJIA -3.56% at 27,961</p><p>* <strong>SECTORS: </strong>Energy -4.73%, Technology -4.18%, Cons Disc -3.53%, Communication Svs -3.31%, Financials -3.27%, Health -3.26%, Industrials -2.98%, Materials -2.85%, Cons Stpl -2.48, Real Estate -1.34%, Utilities -1.16%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Amid the COVID-19 induced risk aversion, gold miners (NEM, KL, GOLD) made gains, whilst China-exposed stocks, such as casinos (WYNN, LVS, MLCO), cruise liners (NCLH, RCL, CCL), airlines (DAL, UAL, AAL), semiconductors (SOX, MU, AMD, NVDA, INTC), and Chinese ADRs (BIDU, BABA, JD), all traded acutely lower amid the wider negative market breadth. The energy sector (XOP, XLE) was the worst performing amid the sharp losses in the crude benchmarks. Financials (XLF, BKX) also underperformed on lower Treasury yields. Gilead (GILD) surged higher on the open after the WHO said remdesivir was the only likely successful treatment for the virus.</p><p><strong>* UK TRADE: </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin noted the main focus for 2020 is a UK-US trade agreement and UK PM Johnson is reportedly poised to kick start trade negotiations with the US within the next two weeks, according to the Telegraph.<strong> </strong>Elsewhere, the EU 27 agreed on its negotiating mandate for the future relationship with the UK which is officially set to be announced tomorrow. However, sources cited by the Express noted that State aid will be the only area where the EU will ask the UK to dynamically align to its standards, the other areas will be covered by an 'equivalence of outcomes'. It also states Brussels wants the UK to maintain 'corresponding high standards' for state aid, competition, taxation, environment, workers' rights standards, with 'Union standards as a reference point'. UK PM Johnson is expected to stick to his hardline stance and warn he is prepared to walk away from the table and impose new costs on UK business rather than accept a deal that impinged on UK sovereignty.</p><p><strong>* BANK OF ISRAEL: </strong>The Bank of Israel kept rates at 0.25%, in line with the consensus. Some had expected the central bank to lower rates given the persistent undershoot on inflation, while inflation expectations are lagging. BOI reiterated that \"it will be necessary to leave the interest rate at its current level for a prolonged period or to reduce it in order to support a process at the end of which inflation will stabilize around the midpoint of the target range, and so that the economy will continue to grow strongly,\" and that \"the Committee is taking additional steps to make monetary policy more accommodative\" -- alluding to the FX interventions it undertakes to put a lid on shekel strength, which is contributing to disinflationary pressures. Goldman Sachs - which was one of those seeking a rate cut - said it does not expect inflation to reach the 1-3% inflation target range before Q1 2021. \"Given our constructive views on the Shekel and our forecast for growth to be broadly in line with potential, we think that both external and domestic inflationary pressures will be muted,\" the bank writes, \"hence, we think that the case for further easing remains.\" GS has pushed its rate cut call to Q2, though notes the uncertainty of the timing of the cut, given that BOI officials have communicated a preference for continued FX interventions rather than rate cuts.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> <strong>JPY</strong> regained some ground after the heavy decline last week spurred by poor data, technical factors, also reports Japan was purchasing foreign bonds. The sell off last week saw participants question its haven status, although with a flight to quality today saw JPY the outperforming G10 FX. <strong>USD</strong> was initially bid early in the morning, although as strength in JPY continued as US players got to their desks, DXY reversed course crossed Friday’s post PMI low of 99.227. <strong>EURCHF</strong> fell to a multi-year low amid the sour risk appetite to start the week, which saw the cross fall beneath 106 to lows of 1.0588. The recent CHF appreciation has led participants to question when the SNB would intervene to keep swissy weaker; <strong>XAU</strong> continued to surge amid the flight-to-quality, reaching highs of 1690, albeit off that in latter trade. <strong>EURUSD</strong> bounced firmly from just above 1.0800 to trigger a few stops at 1.0855 after failing to derive much momentum from Germany’s Ifo survey beating consensus in headline and sub-component terms, although headed into the Asia session rather flat as the dollar lost its initial strength. Petro currencies, <strong>CAD</strong> &amp; <strong>RUB</strong>, were weaker today amid the steep decline in oil prices to start the week. Antipodes were weaker with broader risk appetite however the <strong>NZD</strong> regained some ground and is only marginally weaker against the buck despite weaker retail sales last night. EMFX was generally weaker against the greenback due to the risk environment, where <strong>TRY</strong> was a relative outperformer given it is a net import of oil, meanwhile Brazil and Argentina were closed for public holiday.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>Bullion got the ball rolling, but the Dollar was eventually scuppered by the <strong>JPY </strong>extending recovery gains through 111.00 and the <strong>CHF </strong>really regaining its allure as a currency safe-haven before losing ground across the board. Indeed, the <strong>DXY </strong>appeared to be anchored around 99.500 with a firmer bias for choice, but subsequently retreated to 99.189 (just below Friday’s post-US PMI low of 99.227) having derived little or no traction from a rebound in Chicago’s National Activity index that was more than offset by a back month downgrade.</p><p><strong>XAU/JPY/CHF/EUR</strong></p><p>As noted above, Gold front ran the heavy bouts of risk aversion caused by the ongoing spread of China’s coronavirus that has now spread to more countries across the globe and claimed more lives as close to home in London/Europe, as Italy. However, after topping out just ahead of Usd1690/oz the Jpy and Franc took over the mantle of ports in a storm, as Usd/Jpy breached the 10 DMA (110.59), Usd/Chf made a more decisive break through 0.9800 and Eur/Chf matched August 2015 lows circa 1.0590 before the single currency drew encouragement from the Greenback’s demise. On that note, Eur/Usd bounced firmly from just above 1.0800 to trigger a few stops at 1.0855 after failing to derive much momentum from Germany’s Ifo survey beating consensus in headline and sub-component terms.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK/CAD/GBP/AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>All off worst levels vs the Buck, but still weaker on the aforementioned Chinese nCoV developments and related collapse in commodities such as oil and base metals. Eur/Nok has drifted down from around 10.1600, Eur/Sek from 10.5900+, while Usd/Cad is some 50 pips off 1.3300+ peaks in wake of Canadian wholesale trade almost smashing forecasts 2-fold. Elsewhere, Cable clawed back from sub-1.2900 levels on the eve of the EU finalising its UK trade negotiating position for talks to begin at the start of March, but remained on the back foot in Eur/Gbp cross terms near the 0.8400 handle on the basis that Brussels and London will stick to rigid lines on key issues. Meanwhile, the Aud and Nzd took solace from the Cnh paring some lost ground vs the Usd after the WHO refrained from upgrading its assessment of COVID-19 to pandemic status and efforts to calm concerns over contagion, with the former reclaiming 0.6600 and latter surviving a close test of 0.6300 to trade nearer 0.6350.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>In similar vein, some respite for regional currencies at the expense of the Dollar, but no redemption as risk sentiment remains sour and the likes of the Rouble continued to rue mounting Brent losses. Meanwhile, the Lira was also subject to infection in situ and the only managed a partial recovery with news that Turkey and Russia are planning more talks about the Idlib situation in Syria, the Rand stayed cautious ahead of the impending SA budget and Korean Won weak before Thursday’s BoK policy call.</p>",

Over the weekend, despite efforts by Chinese authorities to assuage concerns over the domestic fallout of the virus, focus instead has been on the pick-up in reported cases external to China. The case count in South Korea has continued to rise with Yonhap’s latest tally amounting to 833 infected, whilst closer to home, fears in Europe have been elevated by Italy reporting 152 cases and a third death from COVID-19; <strong>FTSE MIB (-4.7%).</strong> Momentum for selling has continued since the cash open with the DAX cash moving ever closer to 13,000 to the downside, whilst futures Stateside paint an equally sobering picture with the <strong>e-mini S&amp;P lower by 94 points</strong> thus far. From a sectoral basis, airline names stand out as a notable laggard given the travel implications from the increasing case count with <strong>easyJet (-12.5%), RyanAir (-10.6%), Tui (-8.8%), Air France (-10%), Deutsche Lufthansa (-6.7%)</strong> all showing heavy losses. Elsewhere, the luxury space continues to be a prime target for sellers with <strong>Swatch (-5.3%), Richemont (-5.9%), LVMH (-5.3%)</strong> all suffering, whilst ongoing concerns over car production has weighed on auto/autoparts manufacturers <strong>(BMW -4.7%, Daimler -5.4%, Continental -4.6%, Volkswagen -4.9%)</strong> and exacerbated selling pressure for the <strong>DAX (-3.8%).</strong> In-fitting with price action in the respective complexes, energy and material names are also feeling the squeeze in early European trade, whilst chip manufacturers/IT names are also getting sold aggressively as the e-mini <strong>NASDAQ (-3.3%),</strong> lags its peers ahead of the Wall Street open.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>JPY/XAU - </strong>Although Japan’s market holiday may be crimping volumes and supply, heightened concerns about the spread and impact of China’s coronavirus are helping the Yen forge gains vs an otherwise broadly bid Dollar around 111.50 compared to recent lows below 112.00.

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY/XAU</strong></p><p>Although Japan’s market holiday may be crimping volumes and supply, heightened concerns about the spread and impact of China’s coronavirus are helping the Yen forge gains vs an otherwise broadly bid Dollar around 111.50 compared to recent lows below 112.00. However, Gold is really shining as a safe-haven beacon and outperforming after accelerating towards Usd1700/oz and setting a fresh multi-year peak around Usd1689.30, with technicians now eyeing a Usd1715 Fib if the psychological barrier is breached.</p><p><strong>USD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As noted above, the Greenback is also benefiting from risk-off flows and the <strong>DXY </strong>has bounced further from Friday’s post-US preliminary PMI base to reclaim 99.500+ status as a result, even though Treasury yields are collapsing and the curve is significantly flatter. Nevertheless, the index remains some distance from last week’s 2020 best and the elusive 100.00 mark within a 99.405-657 range.</p><p><strong>NOK/CAD/NZD/AUD</strong></p><p>The clear G10 laggards, as sharp declines in crude prices compound Chinese nCoV losses for the Norwegian Crown and Loonie, while the Kiwi and Aussie are undermined by their closer geographical location and economic ties to China. Eur/Nok is hovering near 10.1500, Usd/Cad is a whisker shy of 1.3300, with Nzd/Usd struggling to keep hold of 0.6300 and Aud/Usd unable to retain 0.6600 as the <strong>YUAN </strong>remains sub-7.0000.</p><p><strong>SEK/GBP/EUR/CHF&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Also suffering from the China health outbreak, Eur/Sek trades north of 10.5500 and Cable is struggling to stay in touch with 1.2900 ahead of UK-EU trade talks, while Eur/Gbp is at the upper end of 0.8345-93 parameters after a better than expected German Ifo survey that has helped the single currency stave off attempts to test support/underlying bids at 1.0800. Meanwhile, the Franc is still somewhat betwixt and between, with Usd/Chf straddling 0.9800 and Eur/Chf dangling just above 1.0600 after another blow for Germany’s CDU party at the Hamburg election.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Widespread and steep declines in many cases vs the Usd, with the Krw extending losses for obvious reasons and Rub also feeling the heat as Brent drops over Usd2/brl, while the Try hardly derived any traction from an improvement in Turkish manufacturing confidence given the spread of COVID-19 and ongoing geopolitical issues. Last but not least, the Zar is on the defensive ahead of Wednesday’s SA budget and Mexican Peso even more cautious before mid-February inflation metrics.</p>",

However, the 10 year benchmark faces technical resistance close to the 175.41 overnight Eurex high between 175.42-44 and could succumb to a deeper retracement if 175.00 is breached (vs 175.13 low so far).</p>",

(Europe Elects)</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p>In FX, <strong>DXY</strong> rebounded from Friday’s post-PMI low of 99.227 and traded on either side of the 99.500 mark, whilst most of the strength was recorded towards the latter part of the APAC session. <strong>EUR/USD</strong> and <strong>GBP/USD</strong> moved largely in tandem with the <strong>Greenback</strong>, although the former saw more pronounced losses at the open, potentially on the rising virus cases reported in Italy – <strong>EUR/USD</strong> drifted higher following an open of just north of 1.0810, although upside was more-so on the back of <strong>DXY</strong> receding back below 99.500 at the time. <strong>Cable</strong> meandered around 1.2950 throughout a bulk of the session having found an overnight base at its 100 WMA ~1.2941, and with little reaction to reports that UK/US trade talks are to kick-start next week, with the PM’s mandate for US talks to be published on March 2nd, expected to push back against some key US demands. Elsewhere, <strong>AUD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong> showed early weakness and gapped significantly lower at the open amid the weekend coronavirus news flow, thereafter <strong>AUD/USD</strong> found buyers around the 11yr low at 0.6585 before reclaiming 0.6600+ status. Meanwhile, <strong>NZD/USD</strong> remained pressured by the overall risk-aversion and with upside capped by disappointing retails sales. <strong>KRW</strong> experienced further weakness in which <strong>USD/KRW</strong> rose above 1215 to hit levels last seen in August 2019 - as the country raised its alert to the “highest” amid the spike in cases, meanwhile, South Korea’s Finance Minister pledged to stem “herd-like” speculative FX movements following the recent substantial weakness in the currency. <strong>USD/JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY-crosses</strong> initially gapped lower at the open before stabilising around break-even despite the soured risk tone, as traders focus on Japan’s deteriorating economy and with Japanese players out of the markets amid the public holiday.</p><p>Fitch affirmed Turkey at 'BB-'; Outlook “Stable”.

Reports also noted that Sublime China information show independent refiners’ run rates in Shandong fell to 41.84% (Prev. 47.82%) over the week, ING highlight that this is the lowest run-rate since 2015 and thus highlights the reduction in fuel consumption in the country at present. Elsewhere, <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> saw substantial gains at the open as prices soared above USD 1650/oz to a fresh multi-year high of 1681/oz over 15-minutes before prices abated and stabilised around USD 1660/oz throughout most of the session, potentially on profit-taking and a firming USD, ahead of potential mild resistance at USD 1685/oz (4th Feb 2013 high), as investors flocked to the safe-haven asset amid the overall risk aversion in the market. Conversely, <strong>copper</strong> prices saw further declines due to the demand implications of the virus spread outside China, and with further pressure added by the risk tone. <strong>Copper</strong> slid further below USD 2.6/lb before finding an overnight base just below USD 2.56/lb. Finally, <strong>zinc</strong> prices fell to their lowest in over 3 ½ years amid rising inventories and demand woes from the virus outbreak.</p><p>Baker Hughes Rig Count (21 Feb): Oil rigs +1 679, NatGas rigs unch at 110, total rigs +1 at 791.

Some desks have noted that the cash yield on Treasuries and the cash yield on stocks is near the widest in around three decades, yet bonds continue to find buyers; some have explained this dynamic by pointing to growth slowing in Q1 2020, and scepticism that inflation will pick-up. Investors will therefore be keeping a close eye on next week's PCE report on Friday. The coronavirus is not concerning Fed officials just yet (although it is clearly a concern at the BOJ), and policymakers have generally given a nod to the December SEP projections which foresee an unchanged FFR in 2020; and in terms of the data, investors will put more stock into the manufacturing ISM due on 2nd March, and other regional manufacturing surveys next week. With that said, markets have added to expectations of Fed easing in 2020, with 47.5bps of easing priced through the end of this year (it was around 38bps a week ago).</p><p><strong>Nevada caucus results vote split (88% reported): </strong>Sanders 47.1%, Biden 21%, Buttigieg 13.7%, Warren 9.6%, Klobuchar 3.9% (Associated Press)</p><p><strong>Morning Consult post-debate poll</strong>: Sanders 30% (+2), Biden 19% (unch), Bloomberg 17% (-3), Elizabeth Warren 12% (+2), Buttigieg 11% (-1), Klobuchar 5% (-1).

South Korea’s <strong>KOSPI (-3.7%)</strong> opened with detrimental losses following the spike in the number of cases in the country alongside seven confirmed deaths and the country’s alert level raised to the “highest” over the weekend, resulting in the index dipping below the 2100 psychological level. Furthermore, Samsung Electronics’ shares slid over 3% after the Co. shut its operations plant in Gumi City in South Korea after an employee was reported to be infected with the COVID-19 virus. As a reminder, <strong>Japanese markets were shut</strong> as participants observe Emperor’s Birthday holiday. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-1.7%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%)</strong> joined the stock rout, with the former heavily pressured by its large-cap energy names as prices in the complex plumb the depths. Meanwhile, Mainland was initially resilient in comparison amid further pledges by China to support impacts of the virus, with President Xi over the weekend stating that the government will step up policy support to help achieve economic and social development targets for 2020. Conversely, <strong>Shenzhen Comp. (+1.3%)</strong> fared better after Guangdong, the province in which the tech hub resides in, lowered its coronavirus response level from the first level to the second level, subsequently, Shenzhen traffic saw an uptick today.&nbsp;Finally, <strong>UST</strong> Mar’20 futures and <strong>Bund</strong> Mar’20 futures retained an underlying bid overnight amid the risk aversion in the market.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asian equities trade with steep losses across the board following Wall Street’s decline on Friday, amid the rapid rise in the number of coronavirus cases outside China prompting the Dow to post its worst daily performance since February 7th, S&amp;P recorded its largest one-day loss since late-January, whilst the Nasdaq notched its worst session since January 27th. Furthermore, weekend development caused US equity futures to open the week with notable downside, with E-mini Mar’20 dipping below 3300, Nasdaq Mar’20 declining over 1.5% and DJ Mar’20 slumping over 300 points. ASX 200 (-2.2%) is pressured by its large-cap financial stocks and some mining stocks as yields and base metal prices fell, instigating a breach below the key 7000 mark in the index. South Korea’s KOSPI (-3.0%) opened with detrimental losses following the spike in the number of cases in the country alongside seven confirmed deaths and the country’s alert level raised to the “highest” over the weekend, resulting in the index dipping below the 2100 psychological level. Furthermore, Samsung Electronics’ shares slid over 3% after the Co. shut its operations plant in Gumi City in South Korea after an employee was reported to be infected with the COVID-19 virus. As a reminder, Japanese markets are shut as participants observe Emperor’s Birthday holiday. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) join the stock rout, with the former heavily pressured by its large-cap energy names as prices in the complex plumb the depths. Meanwhile, Mainland was initially resilient in comparison amid further pledges by China to support impacts of the virus, with President Xi over the weekend stating that the government will step up policy support to help achieve economic and social development targets for 2020. Finally, Shenzhen Comp. (+0.2%) outperforms after Guandong, the province it resides in, lowered its coronavirus response level from the first level to the second level, subsequently, Shenzhen traffic saw an uptick today.&nbsp;</p><p>In FX markets, DXY clambered off Friday’s post-PMI low of 99.227 and trade within a relatively narrow band on either side of the 99.500 mark. EUR/USD and GBP/USD move largely in tandem with the Greenback, although the former saw more pronounced losses at the open, potentially on the rising virus cases reported in Italy – EUR/USD drifted higher following an open of just north of 1.0810, although upside was more-so on the back of DXY receding back below 99.500 at the time. Cable meanders around 1.2950 having found an overnight base at its 100 WMA ~1.2941 and with little reaction to reports that UK/US trade talks are to kick-start next week, with the PM’s mandate for US talks to be published on March 2nd, expected to push back against some key US demands. Elsewhere, AUD and NZD showed early weakness and gapped significantly lower at the open amid the weekend coronavirus news flow, thereafter AUD/USD found buyers around the 11yr low at 0.6585 before reclaiming 0.6600+ status. Meanwhile, NZD/USD remains pressured by the overall risk-aversion and with upside capped by disappointing retails sales. KRW experienced further weakness in which USD/KRW rose above 1215 to hit levels last seen in August 2019 as the country raised its alert to the “highest” amid the spike in cases, meanwhile, South Korea’s Finance Minister pledged to stem “herd-like” speculative FX movements following the recent substantial weakness in the currency. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses initially gapped lower at the open but have since stabilised around break-even despite the risk tone as traders focus on Japan’s deteriorating economy and with Japanese players out of the markets amid local holidays.</p>",
