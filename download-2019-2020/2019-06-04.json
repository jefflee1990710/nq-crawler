However, there were later comments from MOFCOM which urged dialogue and negotiations to resolve frictions and hopes US stops its wrong doings and meets China halfway. (Newswires)</p><p>China Global Times Editor said Beijing is willing to negotiate but is now convinced fair talks are impossible without a fight and that China realised they were naive before in believing that the trade talks could yield results. Furthermore, the China Global Times Editor suggested that the positive image of the US has been ruined and the Chinese now deeply believe key US officials are keen on destroying China’s development capability. (Twitter)</p><p>US Treasury Official said Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will see a Chinese delegation at the G20 meeting but cannot confirm if a bilateral meeting of the two countries will take place. There were also separate reports that G20 finance ministers will tell G20 this week that resolving global trade tensions has become the highest priority and that any further global economic slowdown will call for coordinated response.

In related news, the US Commerce Department made recommendations to boost production of domestic critical minerals, such as low rates, loan guarantees, tax credits and capital gains tax exemptions. The report also recommends expanding cooperation with Canada, Australia, EU, Japan and South Korea on critical minerals exploration, processing and recycling. (Newswires)</p><p>RBA Governor Lowe said it is not unreasonable to expect a lower cash rate from here although the board has not yet made a decision and much depends on the labour market, while he added that the economic forecast assumed rates at 1.00% by year-end. Governor Lowe also said he is confident inflation will rise if unemployment gets to 4.5% but is said to be very concerned about a trade war and disappointed some banks have not passed a full rate cut through.

Apple (AAPL) moved higher, erasing yesterday’s anti-trust probe related losses and in spite of having its profit target lowered at Canaccord, with desks noting the co.’s push for privacy as a key differentiator. Amazon (AMZN) was supported after the ecommerce giant announced that 10mln items now qualify for 1-day delivery with Amazon Prime in the US. Facebook (FB) struggled to keep up with the Nasdaq, after shareholders opted to vote on CEO Zuckerberg’s pay every three years, rather than voting on it every year. Twitter (TWTR) was another beneficiary of the tech outperformance, with stock price also supported after the social media platform was initiated with a buy at Loop Capital. Auto names, including Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) also moved higher as Mexico’s President said he hopes for to reach a deal with the US before the implementation of tariffs. CVS Health (CVS) moved higher after the healthcare player affirmed guidance, with desks calling this a solid start in the confidence rebuilding process. Pfizer (PFE) jumped higher at the open after Morgan Stanley resumed the drug maker with an overweight. Merck (MRK) was supported by positive results for its Lynparza drug. Tiffany &amp; Co (TIF) caught a bid after the luxury jeweller reported an EPS beat. Netflix (NFLX) moved higher after being upgraded to buy from hold at Loop Capital. Uber (UBER) opened higher after the ride hailing co. was initiated with a buy or at overweight at a number of research houses. Likewise, Lyft (LYFT) opened higher after also being initiated with a number of buy ratings, but was unable to hold on to these gains. C-Trip (CTRP) erased premarket losses, moving higher with the market despite China issuing a US travel warning to Chinese citizens. Navistar International (NAV) jumped higher after the co reported earnings that beat on revenue expectations, while raising 2019 guidance. LyondellBasell Industries (LYB) rose after deal talks with Brazilian based Braskem ended. Beyond Meat (BYND) was buoyant as reports circulated suggesting that meat-free burger demand is outstripping supply. S&amp;P 500 2.1% at 2803, NASDAQ-10 2.7% at 7167, Dow Jones 2.1% at 25331.</p><p>Yields started off the session higher, though the bear-flattening gave way to bear-steepening as markets digested a heavy slate of Fedspeak. Voter Evans got us underway, hinting that there could be rate cuts as part of the Fed’s reaction function to trade wars, a sentiment underscored by Chair Powell later, and Vice Chair Clarida after that. The rise in short-end yields was supported by no mention of rate cuts from Powell, some analysts reasoned, while the longer-end’s rise in yields was taking its cue from stocks rallying. In terms of Fed pricing, The probability that rates would remain at 2.25-2.50% by year-end actually rose a touch (to 6% from 2%), according to CME Fedwatch; however, pricing for a June rate cut increased by around 7.5ppts (to 27.5%), and pricing for a July rate cut rose from 53.1% to 66.5%. US T-note future (M9) settled 9+ lower at 126-19.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT: </strong>Equites up, Treasuries down, Dollar down, Crude up.</p><p><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> Powell vows to sustain expansion; Clarida outlines scenario for rate cuts; Evans leans back on dovish market pricing; Mexico tariffs have low support among Congressional Republicans; Italy Dep PM Salvini opts to continue coalition govt.</p><p><strong>* COMING UP:</strong> JN Services PMI, AU GDP, CH Caixin Services PMI, EZ Markit Composite &amp; Services PMI (Final), US ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI, US Markit PMI, Polish Central Bank Monetary Policy meeting, US ADP Employment Change, Chinese President Xi to visit Russia, US EIA Crude Stocks</p><p><strong>* FED: Fed Chair Powell (voter, neutral)</strong> said the central bank would act as appropriate to sustain the economic expansion, adding that the Fed takes seriously the risk that persistent inflation shortfalls could reduce inflation expectations. Powell made no reference to any ‘insurance’ rate cut, but his comments were still initially interpreted as dovish by the market, before the knee-jerk reaction pared back. <strong>Fed’s Evans (voter)</strong> appeared to lean-back on the dovish market pricing (which was pricing a rate cut for the July meeting), stating that he was not seeing what the market was, and that current rate setting were appropriate for now (though was concerned on inflation levels), though he did join those Fed policymakers suggesting that if the data worsens, the Fed should not stand in the way. <strong>Fed’s Clarida (voter)</strong> said the Fed would put in place appropriate policy if growth or inflation are hit by the fallout from trade wars, although he noted that, for now, the US economy was in a good place. On insurance rate cuts, Clarida noted that the Fed had enacted such measures in the past, though he did not want to speculate about future action (indeed, he did not want to comment on market pricing of Fed rate moves either). On inflation, he argued that tariffs raise prices, but it wasn’t inflationary since it would be in one hit.</p><p><strong>* CHINA TRADE: </strong>China’s MOFCOM urged dialogue and negotiations to resolve frictions between China and the US on Tuesday; adding that it hopes the US stops its wrong doings, and meets China halfway. The China Global Times Editor later tweeted that Beijing is willing to negotiate, but is now convinced fair talks are impossible without a fight, and that China realised they were naive before in believing that the trade talks could yield results. Ahead of the G20 summit, a US Treasury official said that Secretary Mnuchin will see a Chinese delegation at the meeting, but cannot confirm if a bilateral meeting of the two countries will take place.</p><p><strong>* MEXICO TRADE: </strong>Mexican President Obrador said that talks in the US are going well, and he believes that there will be a deal before June 10th; he added that there are signs that US officials wish to achieve a deal. From the US, President Trump held stern and reiterated that the tariffs will come into effect on June 10th. Although overnight there were reports that there was little support from US Congressional Republicans for the tariffs, and later on Tuesday Senate Majority Leader confirmed this, saying that he hopes the dispute can be avoided via talks with the Mexican delegation.</p><p><strong>* ITALY</strong>: Optimism regarding the stability of the Italian government grew on Tuesday after Deputy PM Salvini, still glowing in the aftermath the League Party’s recent European election success, announced he had no intention of ending the League and 5SM coalition and triggering new elections. Albeit, it is likely this decision was motivated by the fact that coalition partner, and leader of 5SM, Di Maio had opted to back Salvini’s EUR 32bln flat tax plan. Indeed, the two reportedly met and reached an agreement to work together later in the day, while Di Maio commented that he intended to govern for years. Later news also suggested that Italy's League and 5SM Parties had reached a deal on the disputed building code, which had been a sticking point.</p><p><strong>* RBA: </strong>The RBA became the first G10 central bank to cut rates this cycle, delivering a 25bps rate cut to 1.25%, as was expected, justifying the move to support employment growth and provide greater confidence that inflation will be consistent with its target, and repeated that it would be paying close attention to the labour market. However, some have judged the outcome less dovish than the market was anticipating. UBS notes that the three things that the central bank might have tweaked were left unchanged (it continues to characterise global growth as ‘reasonable,’ it continues to see financial conditions as accommodative, and it continues to see the labour market as ‘strong’). There was no explicit signal from the central bank that it would cut rates further, which make the importance of the next labour market report key. Further, the RBA maintained the central scenario for the economy to grow 2.75% this year and next, while underlying inflation is seen at 1.75% this year and 2.00% next year. That said, Governor Lowe has a tendency to be more dovish than in the statement, thus markets received hints of how aggressive the central bank’s easing cycle looking ahead at the RBA dinner, as he noted that it is not unreasonable to expect a lower cash from here, though the board has not yet made a decision as much depends on the labour market, while noting that the rate cut was not in response to the deteriorating economic outlook. Additionally, Lowe expressed disappointment at some banks not passing through the full rate cut to variable mortgage rates (ANZ 18bps, Westpac 20bps, NAB &amp; CBA: 25bps).</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURE (M9) SETTLES 9+ LOWER AT 126-19: </strong>Yields started off the session higher, though the bear-flattening gave way to bear-steepening as markets digested a heavy slate of Fedspeak. Voter Evans got us underway, hinting that there could be rate cuts as part of the Fed’s reaction function to trade wars, a sentiment underscored by Chair Powell later, and Vice Chair Clarida after that. The rise in short-end yields was supported by no mention of rate cuts from Powell, some analysts reasoned, while the longer-end’s rise in yields was taking its cue from stocks rallying. In terms of Fed pricing, The probability that rates would remain at 2.25-2.50% by year-end actually rose a touch (to 6% from 2%), according to CME Fedwatch; however, pricing for a June rate cut increased by around 7.5ppts (to 27.5%), and pricing for a July rate cut rose from 53.1% to 66.5%.</p><p><strong>* WTI (N9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.23 HIGHER AT USD 53.48/BBL; BRENT (Q9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.69 HIGHER AT USD 61.97/BBL: </strong>The crude complex reversed its earlier losses going into the US session as traders moved into risk assets on the back of Fed Chair Powell’s speech. Market participants took advantage of Powell’s comment that the Fed would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. This was a good catalyst for bulls in the current demand-driven crude market, which up until the Powell’s speech (just after the US equity open) had been under pressure amid US-China tensions dominating the narrative. However, the gains have been marginal in comparison to the losses seen over recent weeks. It will be interesting to see whether this evenings API US energy inventory data release will have much sway over price movement. Crude stocks are seen drawing by 0.8mln bbls, whilst the products are both seen building: gasoline by 0.6mln bbls; and distillates by 0.5mln bbls.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 2.1% at 2803, NASDAQ-10 2.7% at 7167, Dow Jones&nbsp; 2.1% at 25331; SECTORS</strong>: Consumer Discretionary&nbsp; 2.6%, Consumer Staples&nbsp; 0.8%, Energy&nbsp; 1.6%, Financials&nbsp; 2.7%, Health Care&nbsp; 1.7%, Industrials&nbsp; 2.4%, Information Technology&nbsp; 3.3%, Materials&nbsp; 2.7%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 1.7%, Utilities&nbsp; 0%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tech led the rally in stocks, as risk sentiment improved after Fed Chair Powell’s comments. Apple (AAPL) moved higher, erasing yesterday’s anti-trust probe related losses and in spite of having its profit target lowered at Canaccord, with desks noting the co.’s push for privacy as a key differentiator. Amazon (AMZN) was supported after the ecommerce giant announced that 10mln items now qualify for 1-day delivery with Amazon Prime in the US. Facebook (FB) struggled to keep up with the Nasdaq, after shareholders opted to vote on CEO Zuckerberg’s pay every three years, rather than voting on it every year. Twitter (TWTR) was another beneficiary of the tech outperformance, with stock price also supported after the social media platform was initiated with a buy at Loop Capital. Auto names, including Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) also moved higher as Mexico’s President said he hopes for to reach a deal with the US before the implementation of tariffs. CVS Health (CVS) moved higher after the healthcare player affirmed guidance, with desks calling this a solid start in the confidence rebuilding process. Pfizer (PFE) jumped higher at the open after Morgan Stanley resumed the drug maker with an overweight. Merck (MRK) was supported by positive results for its Lynparza drug. Tiffany &amp; Co (TIF) caught a bid after the luxury jeweller reported an EPS beat. Netflix (NFLX) moved higher after being upgraded to buy from hold at Loop Capital. Uber (UBER) opened higher after the ride hailing co. was initiated with a buy or at overweight at a number of research houses. Likewise, Lyft (LYFT) opened higher after also being initiated with a number of buy ratings, but was unable to hold on to these gains. C-Trip (CTRP) erased premarket losses, moving higher with the market despite China issuing a US travel warning to Chinese citizens. Navistar International (NAV) jumped higher after the co reported earnings that beat on revenue expectations, while raising 2019 guidance. LyondellBasell Industries (LYB) rose after deal talks with Brazilian based Braskem ended. Beyond Meat (BYND) was buoyant as reports circulated suggesting that meat-free burger demand is outstripping supply.</p><p><strong>* FX DAILY WRAP: USD:</strong> DXY was choppy on Tuesday after a slate of Fed speak, extending the recent run of losses seen on Monday after dovish Bullard remarks; The greenback knee-jerked lower on Fed Powell’s headline comment that that the Fed wanted to extend the economic expansion and was taking seriously the threat of low inflation/inflation expectations, however, a lack of specificity over timings and an outright mention of a cut saw a paring of the move. <strong>AUD </strong>rose in the aftermath of the RBA, perhaps because the move was so heavily priced, perhaps because there was no explicit signal of another rate cut (Lowe did provide this in his presser, however), perhaps because of the pressure on USD amid renewed speculation that the Fed will cut rates, as well as on going geopolitics, which has in turn, provided favourable relative yield dynamics for the Aussie vs the USD. Some desks have suggested that the AUD rise illustrates that the market is demanding lower rates as a means of protecting against possible economic weakness. Given the latest CFTC data (which are not timely, but still showed specs remain heavily short of AUD), there could be further risks of a short-squeeze, which would likely be accelerated in the event of any CNY weakness, other desks have said. <strong>EUR</strong> was firm, making a brief foray above May’s high at 1.1268, as the single currency benefitted from the weaker dollar and optimism as the Italian political situation appeared to stabilise, and was relatively unresponsive to mixed Eurozone data in which unemployment unexpectedly fell but inflation disappointed. <strong>GBP</strong> was supported by positive comments from US President Trump, in which he remarked that the two countries may be able to forge a “phenomenal” trade deal, whilst also supported by the weaker buck. <strong>JPY</strong> struggled to take advantage of the trend of broader dollar weakness, weakening as risk sentiment took a turn for the positive on Tuesday, USDJPY holding above 108. Meanwhile, <strong>CAD</strong> moved back below 1.34 vs the buck, as the crude complex advanced and risk appetite improved. <strong>EM FX</strong> largely took advantage of dollar weakness, with idiosyncratic factors also driving; <strong>MXN</strong> strengthened amid continuing negotiations with US over tariffs (to be implemented next week), although commentary from the Mexican delegation was constructive, and hopeful that a deal can be reached before then. <strong>ZAR</strong> bucked the trend in EM, coming under pressure after South Africa's ruling party ANC party executive agreed to expand the mandate of the SARB beyond price stability to include growth and unemployment, whilst declaring unemployment a national emergency. The government is also reportedly pushing the SARB to consider QE; the proposals are yet to be finalised. <strong>BRL</strong> was firm as Economy Minister Guedes talking up fiscal reform.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD:</strong>&nbsp;DXY was choppy on Tuesday after a slate of Fed speak, extending the recent run of losses seen on Monday after dovish Bullard remarks; The greenback knee-jerked lower on Fed Powell’s headline comment that that the Fed wanted to extend the economic expansion and was taking seriously the threat of low inflation/inflation expectations, however, a lack of specificity over timings and an outright mention of a cut saw a paring of the move.&nbsp;<strong>AUD&nbsp;</strong>rose in the aftermath of the RBA, perhaps because the move was so heavily priced, perhaps because there was no explicit signal of another rate cut (Lowe did provide this in his presser, however), perhaps because of the pressure on USD amid renewed speculation that the Fed will cut rates, as well as on going geopolitics, which has in turn, provided favourable relative yield dynamics for the Aussie vs the USD. Some desks have suggested that the AUD rise illustrates that the market is demanding lower rates as a means of protecting against possible economic weakness. Given the latest CFTC data (which are not timely, but still showed specs remain heavily short of AUD), there could be further risks of a short-squeeze, which would likely be accelerated in the event of any CNY weakness, other desks have said.&nbsp;<strong>EUR</strong>&nbsp;was firm, making a brief foray above May’s high at 1.1268, as the single currency benefitted from the weaker dollar and optimism as the Italian political situation appeared to stabilise, and was relatively unresponsive to mixed Eurozone data in which unemployment unexpectedly fell but inflation disappointed.&nbsp;<strong>GBP</strong>&nbsp;was supported by positive comments from US President Trump, in which he remarked that the two countries may be able to forge a “phenomenal” trade deal, whilst also supported by the weaker buck.&nbsp;<strong>JPY</strong>&nbsp;struggled to take advantage of the trend of broader dollar weakness, weakening as risk sentiment took a turn for the positive on Tuesday, USDJPY holding above 108. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<strong>CAD</strong>&nbsp;moved back below 1.34 vs the buck, as the crude complex advanced and risk appetite improved.&nbsp;<strong>EM FX</strong>&nbsp;largely took advantage of dollar weakness, with idiosyncratic factors also driving;&nbsp;<strong>MXN</strong>&nbsp;strengthened amid continuing negotiations with US over tariffs (to be implemented next week), although commentary from the Mexican delegation was constructive, and hopeful that a deal can be reached before then.&nbsp;<strong>ZAR</strong>&nbsp;bucked the trend in EM, coming under pressure after South Africa's ruling party ANC party executive agreed to expand the mandate of the SARB beyond price stability to include growth and unemployment, whilst declaring unemployment a national emergency. The government is also reportedly pushing the SARB to consider QE; the proposals are yet to be finalised. Reports later emerged&nbsp;that the government had gone back on this decision, but ZAR was unmoved. <strong>BRL</strong>&nbsp;was firm as Economy Minister Guedes talking up fiscal reform.&nbsp;</p>",

Market participants took advantage of Powell’s comment that the Fed would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. This was a good catalyst for bulls in the current demand-driven crude market, which up until the Powell’s speech (just after the US equity open) had been under pressure amid US-China tensions dominating the narrative. However, the gains have been marginal in comparison to the losses seen over recent weeks. It will be interesting to see whether this evenings API US energy inventory data release will have much sway over price movement. Crude stocks are seen drawing by 0.8mln bbls, whilst the products are both seen building: gasoline by 0.6mln bbls; and distillates by 0.5mln bbls.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The Usd and index have been choppy amidst somewhat contrasting commentary from FOMC members, with losses extended on the back of a dovish Bullard then erased/reversed when Evans sounded more inclined to maintain the current status quo before repeating the pattern post-Powell who seemed somewhere in between via a pledge to do what is necessary to keep US growth intact. The DXY slipped back towards 97.000 in response, but quickly recovered to retest the upper end of its 97.342-96.987 range as the Fed chair gave no explicit signal of a change in stance from patience and a pause, at least for the June policy convene.</p><p><strong>GBP</strong></p><p>Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, the Pound looks set to end Tuesday’s EU session as top G10 performer as Cable revisits the 1.2700 level from sub-1.2650 lows and ignores another sub-50 UK PMI on the way. The uncertain political scene and ongoing Brexit impasse continue to weigh on Sterling, but short covering vs a still weak Dollar overall and against a deflated Euro helped the Gbp rebound, with the cross also meeting stiff technical resistance around 0.8900.</p><p><strong>CAD/AUD/NZD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Loonie, Aussie and Kiwi have all performed well vs their US counterpart given specific factors that could have undermined sentiment, like soggy oil prices (albeit well off worst levels into API inventories), the RBA rate cut and subsequently remarks from Governor Lowe flagging further easing, and declines in the latest GDP auction. However, Usd/Cad, Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd held near the middle of 1.3415-50, 0.6955-93 and 0.6610-0.6575 respective ranges.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p><p>As noted above, the single currency lost some momentum vs the Pound circa upside chart and psychological levels, but also had to contend with softer than forecast Eurozone CPI metrics in the run up to Thursday’s ECB meeting that comes with new Staff projections for inflation and growth. However, Eur/Usd faded just ahead of the 100 DMA at 1.1278 and was drawn to decent option expiry interest from 1.1235-50 in 1 bn as well. Meanwhile, the Franc and Yen saw an unwind of safe-haven premium as EU and US stocks bounced from Monday’s pretty deep risk-aversion lows, with Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf rebounded from 107.85 to 108.33 and 0.9905 to 0.9955, with Eur/Chf paring losses within 1.1155-1.1190 trading parameters and sparking more speculation about SNB action.</p><p><strong>EM</strong></p><p>Zar losses piled up post-dire SA GDP on the back of a change to the SARB mandate to incorporate growth and unemployment, with the Rand sliding to 14.7440+ vs the Buck at one stage. However, the Try and Mxn outperformed as the Lira and Peso tested 5.7550 and 19.5750 against the Greenback, with the former seemingly unfazed by any repercussions from Turkish President Erdogan enthusing over Russia’s S-400 missile system compared to the US F-35s and the latter encouraged by Mexican President AMLO’s optimism over reaching a deal with the US before June 10’s tariff deadline.</p>",

Bulls have failed to benefit from the latest supply updates, where Russia’s output has reportedly fallen even more in the beginning of June to 10.87mln BPD (11.11mln BPD was the recently reported May output); however, it remains up for debate how much of this cut was forced due to the contaminated oil in the Druzhba pipeline fiasco.</li><li><strong>Iran, Algeria, and Kazakhstan have announced they oppose delaying the OPEC+ meeting</strong> from June to July, citing the proposed July dates as unsuitable and preferring the current June 25th/26th dates. Other members, including Russia, had previously been mulling the delay, with analysts suggesting the delay being used to give members more time to assess the oil-market outlook. However, this was prior to the recent sell-offs in petroleum markets, and now with Brent approaching the USD 60/bbl, those <strong>members who were previously sceptical about extending supply cuts are now likely to have come aboard with the extensions</strong> as the drop in oil revenue becomes more pronounced.</li></ul>",

While tech names still lag, the sectors has come off of lows as equities have been grinding higher this morning with no significant fundamental drivers behind the move. EU sectors are mixed, with the aforementioned tech sector underperforming on the potential probes into tech names; sector heavyweight SAP (-1.5%) is the notable negative tech stock as it comprises a 27.6% sector weighting, and has over a 10% weighting in the DAX (+0.8%). Elsewhere, other notable movers this morning include Hargreaves Lansdown (-4.2%) at the bottom of both the Stoxx 600 and FTSE 100 (+0.2%), following concern over customer backlash as the Co. had promoted the Woodford fund extensively in-spite of its underperformance, the Co. finally removed the fund from their recommendation list on Monday. Towards the top of the Stoxx 600 rests Telecom Italia (+3.3%) after a filing showed the Co’s CFO purchased 150k ordinary shares. Separately, much of the sessions positive stock activity has been driven by broker moves with the likes of Lagadere (+2.2%), Royal Mail (+3.3%), BMW (+1.9%) and Volkswagen (+2.2%) supported by broker moves.</p><p>FX</p><p><strong>USD - </strong>The Dollar is trying to recover after another bout of post-Bullard selling pressure pushed the DXY through 97.000, albeit marginally and briefly, with the index back above the big figure and now probing fresh highs within a 97.265-96.987 range as certain G10 counterparts succumb to independent bearish impulses. However, Buck bulls and bears will now be focusing on a raft of Fed speakers to see if other members turn more dovish, and in particular Chair Powell.</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR - </strong>Both holding up relatively well in the face of seemingly negative factors as RBA Governor Lowe flags further policy easing and a potentially lower than previously forecast OCR by the end of 2019 (was 1% vs the current 1.25% after last night’s 25 bp cut), while Eurozone inflation missed already considerably softer consensus forecasts. Aud/Usd remains firmly above 0.6950 around 0.6975 between 0.6955-93 trading parameters, and Eur/Usd is pivoting 1.1250 where the top of a band of option expiries reside (1 bn from 1.1235), but capped at the 100 DMA (1.1278).</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/JPY - </strong>All a fraction firmer against the Greenback, as Cable straddles 1.2650 and shrugs off another poor UK PMI, but the Pound underperforms vs the Euro on political/Brexit grounds (cross hovering just below 0.8900). Meanwhile, the Loonie is also displaying a degree of resilience in the face of weak crude prices and testing offers/resistance ahead of 1.3400 in a 1.3450-20 band and the Yen extended safe-haven gains through 108.00 to 107.85 before losing some momentum.</p><p><strong>CHF/NZD - </strong>The major ‘laggards’ with the Franc stalling ahead of 0.9900 and Kiwi also finding it tough to breach a round number at 0.6600 vs its US rival as the Aud/Nzd cross rebounds from pre-RBA levels amidst general Aussie short covering and profit taking.</p><p><strong>EM - </strong>Contrasting fortunes for the Lira and Rand, as Usd/Try retreats further from 6.0000 towards 5.8100 in spite of more talk from Turkish President Erdogan about the merits of Russia’s S-400 system over the US F-35 alternative that could trigger sanctions. However, Usd/Zar has rallied over 1% to just shy of 14.6500 in wake of significantly weaker than expected SA GDP data.</p><p><strong>RBA cut the Official Cash Rate by 25bps to 1.25% as expected</strong> and stated that it took the decision to lower rates to support employment growth as well as provide greater confidence inflation will be consistent with medium-term targets. RBA added that the outlook for global economy remains reasonable and that main domestic uncertainty continues to be household consumption although some pick-up of growth in household income is expected which should support consumption growth. Furthermore, the RBA said the central scenario is for economy to grow 2.75% this year and next, while underlying inflation is seen at 1.75% this year and 2.00% next year. (Newswires)</p><p><strong>RBA Governor Lowe says it is not unreasonable to expect a lower cash rate from here, though the board has not yet made a decision and much depends on the labour market</strong></p><p>- <strong>Economic forecast has assumed rates at 1% by year-end</strong>, rate decision was not in response to the deterioration in economic outlook since May; Monetary policy has downsides, should not be the only option.</p><p>- <strong>Does not anticipate getting to rate lows seen in the UK or Canada (0.25%) but has the capacity to do so if needed</strong></p><p>- States that he is <strong>confident that inflation will rise if unemployment gets to 4.5%, adding that there is no reason to change the inflation target band</strong></p><p>- Lowe adds that he is <strong>very concerned about a trade war</strong></p><p>- Australia can sustain jobless rate of “4 point something”</p><p>- Banks should fully pass through rate cut to variable mortgage rates, it is disappointing that some banks have not passed a full rate cut through (ANZ: 18bps, Westpac 20bps)</p><p>Australian Current Account Balance SA (AUD)(Q1) -2.9B vs. Exp. -2.5B (Prev. -7.2B, Rev. -6.3B).

However, Gilts and US Treasuries remain depressed after their recent run up, with the former still blighted by UK political and Brexit issues to an extent and nor far from a fresh 129.91 Liffe base, and the latter biding time awaiting more data and Fed speak to see if others including Chair Powell shift towards the more dovish stance of Bullard.</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>The energy market continues to be pressured as the ongoing trade concerns dampens global demand output, with WTI (-0.6%) and Brent (-0.6%) on the backfoot in early European trade</strong> following on from a lacklustre Asia-Pac session. News-flow this morning has largely been from the OPEC front in which a letter showed that Iran opposes delaying the OPEC meeting to July, whilst Algeria and Kazakhstan have also told OPEC that the early July dates are unsuitable. This comes amid split views as to whether the OPEC/OPEC+ meeting should be at the end of June or in early July (touted dates July 3rd/4th), which Russia is in favour for. Furthermore, sources stated that Russian production this month fell to 10.87mln, down from the prior month’s 11.11mln BPD which was reported via the Energy Ministry.

While tech names still lag, the sectors has come off of lows as equities have been grinding higher this morning with no significant fundamental drivers behind the move. EU sectors are mixed, with the aforementioned tech sector underperforming on the potential probes into tech names; sector heavyweight SAP (-1.4%) is the notable negative tech stock as it comprises a 27.6% sector weighting, and has over a 10% weighting in the DAX (+0.8%). Elsewhere, other notable movers this morning include Hargreaves Lansdown (-4.2%) at the bottom of both the Stoxx 600 and FTSE 100 (+0.2%), following concern over customer backlash as the Co. had promoted the Woodford fund extensively in-spite of its underperformance, the Co. finally removed the fund from their recommendation list on Monday. Towards the top of the Stoxx 600 rests Telecom Italia (+3.3%) after a filing showed the Co’s CFO purchased 150k ordinary shares. Separately, much of the sessions positive stock activity has been driven by broker moves with the likes of Lagadere (+2.4%), Royal Mail (+3.1%), BMW (+1.9%) and Volkswagen (+2.2%) supported by broker moves.</p><p><strong>FX</strong></p><p><strong>USD</strong> - The Dollar is trying to recover after another bout of post-Bullard selling pressure pushed the DXY through 97.000, albeit marginally and briefly, with the index back above the big figure and now probing fresh highs within a 97.265-96.987 range as certain G10 counterparts succumb to independent bearish impulses. However, Buck bulls and bears will now be focusing on a raft of Fed speakers to see if other members turn more dovish, and in particular Chair Powell.</p><p><strong>AUD/EUR</strong> - Both holding up relatively well in the face of seemingly negative factors as RBA Governor Lowe flags further policy easing and a potentially lower than previously forecast OCR by the end of 2019 (was 1% vs the current 1.25% after last night’s 25 bp cut), while Eurozone inflation missed already considerably softer consensus forecasts. Aud/Usd remains firmly above 0.6950 around 0.6975 between 0.6955-93 trading parameters, and Eur/Usd is pivoting 1.1250 where the top of a band of option expiries reside (1 bn from 1.1235), but capped at the 100 DMA (1.1278).</p><p><strong>GBP/CAD/JPY</strong> - All a fraction firmer against the Greenback, as Cable straddles 1.2650 and shrugs off another poor UK PMI, but the Pound underperforms vs the Euro on political/Brexit grounds (cross hovering just below 0.8900). Meanwhile, the Loonie is also displaying a degree of resilience in the face of weak crude prices and testing offers/resistance ahead of 1.3400 in a 1.3450-20 band and the Yen extended safe-haven gains through 108.00 to 107.85 before losing some momentum.</p><p><strong>CHF/NZD</strong> - The major ‘laggards’ with the Franc stalling ahead of 0.9900 and Kiwi also finding it tough to breach a round number at 0.6600 vs its US rival as the Aud/Nzd cross rebounds from pre-RBA levels amidst general Aussie short covering and profit taking.</p><p><strong>EM</strong> - Contrasting fortunes for the Lira and Rand, as Usd/Try retreats further from 6.0000 towards 5.8100 in spite of more talk from Turkish President Erdogan about the merits of Russia’s S-400 system over the US F-35 alternative that could trigger sanctions. However, Usd/Zar has rallied over 1% to just shy of 14.6500 in wake of significantly weaker than expected SA GDP data.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p><p><strong>Bunds</strong> are still on the verge of another test of Sep19 contract highs, and just posted a marginal new Eurex best of 171.08 even though the bounce in Italian debt from 128.79 lows has been more emphatic (stop just short of 130.00) in wake of less incendiary remarks from Salvini, better than forecast unemployment data and weak Eurozone inflation ahead of the ECB. However, <strong>Gilts</strong> and US Treasuries remain depressed after their recent run up, with the former still blighted by UK political and Brexit issues to an extent and nor far from a fresh 129.91 <strong>Liffe</strong> base, and the latter biding time awaiting more data and Fed speak to see if others including Chair Powell shift towards the more dovish stance of Bullard.</p><p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p><p>The energy market continues to be pressured as the ongoing trade concerns dampens global demand output, with <strong>WTI</strong> (-0.9%) and <strong>Brent</strong> (-0.9%) on the backfoot in early European trade following on from a lacklustre Asia-Pac session. News-flow this morning has largely been from the OPEC front in which a letter showed that Iran opposes delaying the OPEC meeting to July, whilst Algeria and Kazakhstan have also told OPEC that the early July dates are unsuitable. This comes amid split views as to whether the OPEC/OPEC+ meeting should be at the end of June or in early July (touted dates July 3rd/4th), which Russia is in favour for. Furthermore, sources stated that Russian production this month fell to 10.87mln, down from the prior month’s 11.11mln BPD which was reported via the Energy Ministry. Finally, traders will be eyeing tonight’s API data for any signs of a short-term catalyst, with the street looking for headline inventories to draw by around 1.8mln BPD. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> (Unch) is choppy and largely unchanged intraday as the yellow metal gave up its gains as the Buck recovered. Meanwhile, <strong>copper</strong> is little changed as the weaker Dollar countered the soured risk sentiment. Finally, <strong>Zinc</strong> prices dropped to six-month lows overnight amid a deterioration of the global outlook, with the recent China PMIs pointing to growth of just 4.5%-5%, according to CapEco.</p>",

Gilts have found a relatively shallow base under 130.00 at 129.93 ahead of the May construction PMI that is expected to remain steady at 50.5, but risks losing the 50.0 handle given Monday’s manufacturing collapse, while looming DMO supply in the form of a Gbp3 bn 2024 tap could warrant some concession. However, STIRs are bid, very short end aside, with hefty interest in options noted via Oct19 calls in the 99.25 strike that have been bought for 4.75 ticks in 20k lots, according to a Ransquawk client and market contact. Note, the underlying Dec19 future is currently 1 tick above yesterday’s close at 99.195 vs +1.5 ticks at best, while Jun19 through Mar21 have been -0.5 to +3 ticks on the day so far.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The 10 year German benchmark appears primed for a retest of Monday’s new peak for the Sep19 future that has now replaced Jun19 as the front month for the purposes of commentary and technical analysis in most if not all cases. To recap, yesterday’s apex was 171.12 and after opening at 107.99 the core Eurozone bond recently traded at 171.04 vs a 170.82 low and 170.81 close, while the corresponding cash yield hovers a fraction above its circa -22 bp record base. Although US Treasuries remain slightly softer after their run up to fresh highs, Bunds continue to derive underlying support from underperforming BTPs as speculation mounts about imminent punitive Italian budget procedures, possibly as soon as Wednesday. Ahead, preliminary Eurozone inflation data is timely given Thursday’s ECB policy meeting and against the backdrop of sliding oil prices, not to mention the first Fed member to officially mention easing rates. Back to the charts, resistance beyond 171.12 lies at 171.32, while support below the 170.82 trough comes in at 170.71 and represents last Friday’s intraday low.</p>",

(Newswires)</p><p>FX</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The greenback remained subdued after the prior day’s losses which were triggered by somewhat disappointing Markit and ISM Manufacturing PMI data, falling yields and comments from Fed’s Bullard that an interest rate cut might be warranted soon which made him the first among his peers at the FOMC to publicly call for lower rates. The subdued greenback lifted <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> to around 1.1250 and provided <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> with some reprieve from the ongoing political and Brexit-related weakness, while USD/JPY slipped below 108.00 as the risk averse tone added to the demand for the safe-haven JPY. Antipodeans were choppy overnight with <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> briefly dampened following a miss on Current Account and Retail Sales data but with the pressure short-lived and <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was later buoyed after the RBA cut rates for the 1st time in nearly 3 years as expected. This was due to the market being heavily one-sided going into the decision and as the statement didn’t provide anything that suggested urgency by the central bank to cut again as soon as August which many forecasters anticipate, although <strong>AUD</strong> then eventually drifted back to pre-announcement levels as participants now shift focus to RBA Governor Lowe’s comments later. <strong>MXN</strong> was also mildly supported overnight after reports suggested that Congressional Republicans discussed moves to block Trump's tariffs on Mexico.</p><p><strong>RBA cut the Official Cash Rate by 25bps to 1.25% as expected</strong> and stated that it took the decision to lower rates to support employment growth as well as provide greater confidence inflation will be consistent with medium-term targets. RBA added that the outlook for global economy remains reasonable and that main domestic uncertainty continues to be household consumption although some pick-up of growth in household income is expected which should support consumption growth. Furthermore, the RBA said the central scenario is for economy to grow 2.75% this year and next, while underlying inflation is seen at 1.75% this year and 2.00% next year.

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> took a breather from recent advances but remained near 3-month highs amid a weaker greenback, while price action in <strong>copper</strong> reflected the cautious sentiment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak said Russia is committed to sticking to the OPEC+ deal in June</strong> and that Russia's combined production cut under the deal stood at 317k BPD in May compared to October levels (11.36mln BPD). (Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p>Treasuries continued their march higher on Monday. The rally was initiated by disappointing UK and EZ Markit Manufacturing PMI, where the bid in Gilts and Bunds seeped across the pond; it worth highlighting that Bund yields reached their all-time lows as German manufacturing remained in the contractionary zone. Analysts note that the reaching of multi-year lows in several US yields sparked some dealer sales and profit taking, where the 30-year posted 31-month lows. However, a mixed release of the US Markit Manufacturing PMI saw the rally continue in the US session, which was then exacerbated by Fed’s Bullard warranting the idea of a rate cut. At settlement, the curve had bull steepened considerably, where the 2s/30s widened by c. 5.5bps, and the 2-year yield dropped by more than 10bps. US T-note futures (M9) settled 16+ higher ticks at 126-28+.</p><p><strong>Fed's Bullard (Voter, Dove) said an interest rate cut might be warranted soon on trade and inflation worries</strong>, while he added that inversion of yield suggests current policy rate setting is inappropriately high and that trade uncertainty means expected slowdown in the US may now be even slower. (Newswires)</p><p>US Commerce Secretary Ross reiterated President Trump's message that Mexico needs to do more on illegal immigration in a meeting with Mexico's Economic Minister, while Mexico said without its efforts a further 500k migrants would reach US this year and that they could take several paths if the US goes ahead with the tariffs including asking for help from WTO or implementing its own tariffs on US goods.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded subdued after the headwinds from Wall St where tech underperformed and the Nasdaq slipped into a correction as FAANG stocks were hit on reports of the US launching antitrust and business practice probes into the large tech names. ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) were indecisive as strength in mining names and a widely anticipated RBA rate cut helped offset the tech losses in Australia, while trade in Tokyo was relatively uneventful with exporter sentiment dampened by further unfavourable currency flows. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) weakened as trade tensions persisted as the US accused China of misrepresenting trade talks and placed the blame on Chinese negotiators back peddling on issues, while the PBoC’s liquidity efforts resulted to a daily net drain of CNY 90bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher and the 10yr yield dropped to the lowest since August 2016 of below -0.10% amid the risk averse tone and as prices tracked the moves in T-notes following the comments from Fed’s Bullard, while 10yr JGB auction results showed higher accepted prices.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback remained subdued after the prior day’s losses which were triggered by somewhat disappointing Markit and ISM Manufacturing PMI data, falling yields and comments from Fed’s Bullard that an interest rate cut might be warranted soon which made him the first among his peers at the FOMC to publicly call for lower rates. The subdued greenback lifted EUR/USD to around 1.1250 and provided GBP/USD with some reprieve from the ongoing political and Brexit-related weakness, while USD/JPY slipped below the 108.00 handle as the risk averse tone added to the demand for the safe-haven JPY. Antipodeans were choppy overnight with AUD/USD briefly dampened following a miss on Current Account and Retail Sales data but with the pressure short-lived and AUD/USD was later buoyed after the RBA cut rates for the 1st time in nearly 3 years as expected. This was due to the market being heavily one-sided going into the decision and as the statement didn’t provide anything that suggested urgency by the central bank to cut again as soon as August which many forecasters anticipate, although AUD then eventually drifted back to pre-announcement levels as participants now shift focus to RBA Governor Lowe’s comments later. Elsewhere, MXN was also mildly supported overnight after reports suggested that Congressional Republicans discussed moves to block Trump's tariffs on Mexico.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly lower after the headwinds from Wall St where tech underperformed and the Nasdaq slipped into a correction as FAANG stocks were hit on reports of the US launching antitrust and business practice probes into the large tech names. ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are mixed as strength in mining names and one-sided expectations for an RBA rate cut later helps offset the tech losses in Australia, while trade in Tokyo is relatively uneventful with exporter sentiment dampened by further unfavourable currency flows. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) are weaker as trade tensions persist with the US accusing China of misrepresenting trade talks and placed the blame on Chinese negotiators back peddling on issues, while the PBoC’s liquidity efforts resulted to a daily net drain of CNY 90bln.</p><p>In FX markets, the greenback remains subdued after the prior day’s losses which were triggered by somewhat disappointing Markit and ISM Manufacturing PMI data, falling yields and comments from Fed’s Bullard that an interest rate cut might be warranted soon which made him the first among his peers at the FOMC to publicly call for lower rates. The subdued greenback lifted EUR/USD to around 1.1250 level and provided GBP/USD with some reprieve from the ongoing political and Brexit-related weakness, while USD/JPY slipped below the 108.00 handle as the risk averse tone adds to the demand for the safe-haven JPY. Elsewhere, antipodeans have slightly pulled back overnight with AUD/USD briefly dampened following a miss on Current Account and Retail Sales data but with the pressure only brief as participants await the RBA rate decision later in which markets are pricing in 100% probability of the central bank cutting rates for the first time in nearly 3 years, while focus will also be on the statement for any clues to justify expectations for a further cut later this year.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher and the 10yr yield briefly dropped to the lowest since August 2016 of below -0.10% amid the risk averse tone and as prices track the moves in T-notes following the comments from Fed’s Bullard, while focus now shifts to the 10yr JGB auction later.</p>",
