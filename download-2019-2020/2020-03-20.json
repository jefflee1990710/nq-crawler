Investors continue to demand lower prices as the US and global economy begins to fall off a cliff amid a wide-ranging shutdown. Fiscal and monetary stimulus has been let loose and continues to ramp up – Senate is proposing a USD 1trln stage 3 package for Monday and UK is to begin paying wages for the first time ever – in a markedly more steadfast fashion than had been seen in the 2008/09 crisis, as policymakers strive to be proactive rather than reactive. Ironically, after a week of multiple limit downs/ups hit, none were reached on Friday despite what desks noted as one of the largest ever OpEx (quad witching). Nonetheless, the week has been one for the history books, with BofA’s latest flow show printing largest-ever weekly outflows in IG and EM debt, MBS, municipal bonds and TIPs, with its 4th largest recorded inflow into cash ever – a theme that has driven the weak as investors have moved out of all assets into the US dollar; ramped up US dollar FX swap lines announced today helped cool the bid somewhat on Friday.</p><h2>COVID-19:</h2><p><strong>US STIMULUS: </strong>US Senate Majority Leader McConnell introduced the Senate GOP stimulus plan, named the CARES Act and worth USD 1trln, which includes direct payments of USD 1,200 per person, relief for small businesses and workers, as well as fresh healthcare-related support. Furthermore, the coronavirus bill provides up to USD 208bln in collateralized loans and loan guarantees to US industries including USD 58bln for airlines, with bipartisan discussions to begin today. Democratic Senator Menendez said the bill would let the Fed buy municipal bonds of any maturity – a feature that would reduce strain on the Federal government. There were separate reports that US Governors are seeking at least USD 150bln in direct aid from the package. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the tax filing deadline will be moved from April 15th to July 15th, a decision that will likely have to be substituted with further. Mnuchin said overnight that the plan is to get the bill passed and signed by President Trump on Monday; later said the USD 1trln bill is too small and wants more direct cash payments – the latter is a measure that has drawn scepticism among lawyers. President Trump himself said he is talking about much more than a USD 1,000 check for unemployed Americans in a press conference.</p><p><strong>US TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS: </strong>All non-essential workforce members in New York must stay at home, Governor Cuomo announced, where only “essential” businesses can have commuting workers. California overnight reported a state-wide stay at home order. NIH’s Fauci said social distancing in the US should continue for a number of weeks. The US announced that it had agreed with Mexico to restrict non-essential travel across their border as of midnight, Friday, stressing that the restrictions do not apply to trade and commerce. President Trump noted that the US is not considering a national lock-down at this time, doesn't think it will ever be necessary.</p><p><strong>UK STIMULUS: </strong>Chancellor Sunak announced a combination of measures on jobs and incomes, where, for the first time, the UK government will help to pay wages. Any employer will be eligible for grants covering wages of those who have been furloughed and kept on salary, which will cover 80% of the salary of retained workers of up to GBP 2,500 per month, backdated to March 1st, for at least three months, with no limit on funding available. Furthermore,&nbsp; the previously announced COVID-19 loan scheme will be interest-free for 12 months (prev. 6 months). No business VAT will be paid until June-end. Universal Credit will be increased by GBP 1,000 for the next 12 months; working tax credit also increased by GBP 1,000. The minimum income floor will be suspended so self-employed people can fully access Universal Credit at a rate equivalent to statutory sick pay. Sunak highlighted the GBP 6bln of extra support through the welfare system, as well as close to GBP 1bln of support by increasing the generosity of housing benefit and Universal Credit, so that the Local Housing Allowance will cover at least 30% of market rents. The further, unprecedented fiscal measures saw some selling in GBP after the announcement. The Chancellor said the measures would be funded through regular debt operations; note that the UK DMO is to publish the revised 2020/21 borrowing remit given the coronavirus measures on April 23rd.</p><p><strong>LONDON / UK: </strong>UK PM Johnson told cafes, pubs, restaurants, gyms, leisure centres, and similar venues to shut from Friday evening, although did not provide specifics on the enforceability of the request (Health Minister Hancock earlier said that if people do not follow advice, then tougher measures may need to be imposed); he also advised restaurants to offer takeout while closed. Johnson said the government does not want to immobilize the tube or other travel networks. Elsewhere, social distancing in the UK could be required for the remainder of the year, according to reports.</p><p><strong>EUROPEAN STIMULUS: </strong>The<strong> </strong>German supplementary budget to counter the coronavirus will be significantly above EUR 100bln, according to sources, which could reach EUR 150bln<strong>; </strong>prior reports via Handelsblatt noted this was to be EUR 100bln in size. Handelsblatt noted that half of the funding will make a fund for small Co's; the package is to be financed completely via debt, as well as being approved on Monday. EU Commissioner Gentolini said discussions on coronabond insurance needs to continue, saying ESM would be the best issuer for this. Furthermore, EU Commission President von der Leyen said coronabond will be used if it helps; the President also said countries must now pump money onto their economies, and the EU is to loosen debt rules, saying it is right time to be flexible and generous. The Swiss government announced a CHF 32bln aid package. Italian PM Conte has called on the EU to utilise the ESM and provide emergency lines of credit to countries, FT reported.</p><p><strong>EUROPEAN TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS:</strong> French Foreign Minister said France may extend its countrywide lockdown. Italy may extend lockdown to May 1st. Spain ordered the closure of all hotels due to coronavirus, AFP reported.</p><p><strong>CHINA: </strong>China's Cabinet is to speed up the implementation of phased and targeted tax cuts as well as fee cuts for firms to aid employment.</p><p><strong>CASE COUNT</strong> – figures provided Friday against previous provided Thursday:</p><ul><li><strong>CANADA </strong>total cases 925 (prev. 873), death toll 12 (prev. 12).</li><li><strong>CHINA </strong>total cases 80,967 (prev. 80,928), death toll 3,248 (prev. 3245).</li><li><strong>FRANCE </strong>total cases 12,612 (prev. 10,995), death toll 450 (prev. 372).</li><li><strong>GERMANY </strong>total cases 19,848 (prev. 13,944), death toll 59 (prev. 44).</li><li><strong>ITALY </strong>total cases 47,021 (prev. 41,035), death toll 4,032 (prev. 3,405).</li><li><strong>NETHERLANDS </strong>total cases 2,994 (prev. 2,460), death toll 106 (prev. 76).</li><li><strong>SOUTH KOREA </strong>total cases 8,652 (prev. 8,565), death toll 94 (prev. 91).</li><li><strong>SPAIN </strong>total cases 19,980 (prev. 17,147), death toll 1,002 (prev. 767).</li><li><strong>SWITZERLAND </strong>4,849 (prev. 3,888), death toll 56 (prev. 43).</li><li><strong>UK </strong>total cases 3,983 (prev. 3268), death toll 167 (prev. 144).</li><li><strong>US </strong>total cases 15,219 (prev. 10,442), death toll 201 (prev. 150); NY State cases 7,102 (prev. 4,152).</li></ul><h2>CENTRAL BANKS</h2><p><strong>SWAP LINES: </strong>The<strong> </strong>Fed, BoE, BoC, BoJ, SNB, and ECB announced coordinated action for further liquidity provision via FX swap lines, moving to daily operations from Monday (prev. weekly). The Fed announced it is to continue through till the end of April at the very least and will continue to hold weekly 84-day maturity operations.</p><p><strong>FED </strong>has expanded support for municipal and money markets via its <strong>MMLF</strong> through the Boston Fed, which is now able to lend to financial institutions secured by assets purchased from single state or other tax-exempt money market funds. Elsewhere, the Fed said it is encouraged by the notable rise in <strong>Discount Window </strong>borrowing this week, which shows banks' willingness to use the, previously stigmatised, facility as a source of funding for household and business credit, while reports noted that banks tapped USD 28.2bln in discount window borrowing this week vs. USD 11mln last week.</p><p><strong>NY FED OPERATIONS: </strong>NY Fed is to maintain the afternoon daily USD 500bln O/N repo operations for the remainder of the month. Meanwhile, immediate funding pressures seem abated, where take up in the O/N and term operations remains limited. Meanwhile, the Fed purchased USD 122bln of Treasuries and MBS securities on Friday, announcing that it was to make MBS purchases of at least USD 100bln next week and will release a schedule each day for the next day’s operations (purchasing USD 40bln on Monday).</p><p><strong>BOE</strong> announced supervisory and prudential policy measures due to the coronavirus: suspending 2020 bank stress tests and postponing joint BoE/FCA survey into open-ended funds.</p><p><strong>PBOC</strong> disappointed those looking for action, in which it skipped liquidity operations again and disappointed calls for a cut to the Prime Loan Rate. It left the PBoC 1-Year Loan Prime Rate (Mar) at 4.05% (exp. 4.00%), with the 5-Year Loan Prime Rate (Mar) at 4.75% (exp. 4.70%). Goldman Sachs’ analysts believe that the PBOC’s loosening has not yet come to an end, citing the absence of loosening measures in China post the Fed rate cut on March 6th, as well as the challenging macro environment and the pressure on banks in terms of the capital and provisions that are needed for.</p><p><strong>NORGES: </strong>In an emergency announcement the Norges Bank cut rates by 75bp to 0.25% from 1.0%, which is the second emergency rate cut they have taken after a 50bp cut earlier in the week. The move follows on from the Bank remarking they are looking at the FX space and are considering intervening via NOK purchases, as well as the provision of another bout of extraordinary F-loans this week. While the meeting was ‘extraordinary’ the move wasn’t too surprising given recent policy remarks as well as the continued decline in liquidity for the market, with ING remarking the NOK has the lowest liquidity amongst G10 peers. As such, reaction to this release was very minimal, particularly as the Bank is now running out of conventional policy space given previous precedent about the use of other measures such a QE or negative rates.</p><h2>EQUITIES:</h2><p><strong>CLOSING LEVELS: </strong>SPX -4.78% at 2294, NDX -4.04% at 6994, DJIA -4.55% at 19174.</p><p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> Utilities -8.18%, Cons Stpl -6.53%, Real Estate -5.48%, Industrials -5.04%, Communication Svs -4.63%, Technology -4.42%, Health -4.08%, Materials -3.53%, Financials -3.2%, Cons Disc -2.71%, Energy +0.96%.</p><p><strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> US President Trump announced for any companies receiving aid he will demand there be no buybacks. The latest companies to request aid are the car rental services, Avis Budget Corp (CAR) &amp; Hertz (HTZ). While the Airlines for Americas trade association said the industry needs “immediate financial assistance” to protect the 11mln jobs it represents. Those heavily hit earlier in the week amid mass closures and cancellations of operations, MGM Resorts (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Carnival (CCL) among outperforming stocks on Friday as it recoups from the prior losses. While Carnival (CCL) reported preliminary earnings, which saw EPS miss estimates at 0.22/shr with CCL noting the coronavirus resulted in a net loss of USD 0.23/shr to its EPS, although revenue was firmer than expected at USD 4.8bln; NCLH &amp; RCL also saw solid gains. Reports in Nikkei noted Apple’s (AAPL) supply chain woes may not be over even as China starts to recover due to supplier factory closures elsewhere such as Malaysia. Boeing (BA) is reportedly leaning towards a temporary halt at its twin-aisle jetliner factories in a similar move to Airbus (AIR FP), according to people familiar with the matter. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) announced its supply chain is currently holding steady and meeting patient needs. Gilead (GILD) was upgraded at Piper Sandler who were positive on the rewards a successful vaccine against COVID-19 would bring. Tesla’s (TSLA) Fremont, CA factory was ordered to halt production, as was its factory in NY. Coty (COTY) provided an update on the coronavirus noting its activations on Amazon has seen US sales nearly double in recent weeks, as well as noting it is to launch the Kylie skin-care Europe in upcoming weeks; it is also preparing for increased demand post coronavirus. Danaher Corp. (DHR) announced the US FTC is on board with the acquisition of General Electric’s (GE) Life Sciences Biopharma Business and it expects the deal to close on March 31st, 2020. AT&amp;T (T) was hit after it announced its USD 4bln accelerated share repurchase programme has been cancelled, stating the impact of the virus could be material. Crowdstrike (CRWD) surged on solid earnings and guidance, Tiffany’s (TIF) were flat despite top and bottom-line beats, although gross margin was slightly short. Cintas (CTAS) saw solid earnings although gross margin was slightly short, but several broker downgrades weakened the stock citing a cloudy future as it withdraws its guidance for Q4 and FY20.</p><h2>CRUDE:</h2><p><strong>SETTLEMENT: WTI (K0) SETTLED USD 3.28 LOWER AT 22.63/BBL; BRENT (K0) SETTLED USD 1.49 LOWER AT 26.98/BBL.</strong></p><p><strong>ANOTHER DAY OF HEAVY PRICE ACTION AMONG THE CRUDE COMPLEX</strong>, particularly WTI which seems to be getting particularly volatile as the coronavirus spreads and pushes the economy off the edge. After seeing its largest recorded gain in history on Thursday, WTI has pared back a majority of the bounce and has fallen back towards the USD 20/bbl figure. This week’s Baker Hughes US Rig Count saw drillers cut rigs by 20 to 772, the largest weekly cut since April 2019.</p><p><strong>ON THE RUSSIA/SAUDI FRONT</strong>, a Russian government spokesperson stated Russia views Saudi’s plan to increase production as blackmail adding it will not back down and “remains ready for contact on prices”, appearing to show no sign of ease of the pricing war, although the Kremlin denies there is a pricing war between the two oil giants. Russia also added that the low oil prices are unpleasant, but not a catastrophe adding it has enough reserves and a sufficient cushion. The Kremlin rebuffed the report on potential US sanctions who were reportedly looking to intervene in the pricing war. However, the latest WSJ reports suggest OPEC is to meet with US shale producers today which could help towards a truce between the world's three largest oil producers, and perhaps resolve the Saudi/Russia pricing war, according to people familiar with the matter which added some support to the benchmarks.</p><p><strong>US Energy officials are pushing the Trump administration to forge an oil alliance with Saudi Arabia</strong>, which could pave the way for Saudi’s to leave OPEC, according to WSJ sources. Also of note, in fitting with source reports yesterday, officials in Texas have reached out to the Trump administration with consideration of a 10% oil production cut if Russia and Saudi did the same.</p><h2>BONDS</h2><p><strong>TREASURY SETTLEMENT: T-NOTE FUTURES (M0) SETTLED 1 POINT 16+ HIGHER AT 136-23+.</strong></p><p><strong>THE TPLEX BULL FLATTENED</strong> to end the week - 2s10s -10bps to 57.70; 2-year yield 0.356%, 10-year yield 0.94%, 30-year yield 1.58%. The bid was felt throughout the session, coming alongside equities rolling lower. Support was also found amid the Fed’s continued Treasury purchases, filling offers in poor liquidity as many participants are physically absent from their screens. Meanwhile, corporate IG issuance continued, following Thursday’s slew, with Intel and Coke raising USD 8bln and 5bln, respectively, while credit spreads narrowed slightly. Across the pond, the Euro issuance market even had a revival, no doubt the ECB’s latest PEPP package providing some confidence, seeing Engie and Unilever raise EUR 2.5bln and 2bln, respectively.</p><h2>FOREX:</h2><p><strong>WEEKLY FX WRAP:</strong></p><p><strong>USD/XAU: </strong>When push really comes to shove and a crisis spreads through financial markets into credit, the Greenback’s credentials as the ultimate universal currency appear firmly intact. Indeed, the Buck remains on course to secure whopping gains vs all rivals even though the DXY has dipped from best levels just a tick short of 103.000 compared to a low of 97.440, with so called safer havens trailing in wake amidst the scramble for USD liquidity and cash above all else, including other assets. Moreover, Dollar demand has been almost insatiable at times irrespective of risk sentiment and whether US Treasury yields have been rising, falling in bull or bear steepening mode. However, the Fed’s roll out of more swap lines to various Central Bank counterparts on Thursday, and then subsequent enhancement of liquidity provisions to daily ops from weekly has enabled/helped other G10s to claw back some lost ground. The demand for dollars particularly weighed on Gold prices as the precious metal fell beneath 1500/oz as the demand for cash in the current environment took precedence.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/CAD/NZD: </strong>As noted above, Friday’s major standings are far from indicative or tell the full story, as the Pound rebounds from worst levels near 1.1400, but fades circa 1.1930 and still roughly 5 big figures under weekly highs in wake of the BoE slashing rates to the MPC’s stated lower bound (0.1%) and unleashing an additional GBP 200bln APF. Meanwhile, the UK Chancellor has pledged over GBP 300 bn in COVID-19 relief and support with more to be revealed shortly as the Government is poised to impose tighter virus containment restrictions akin to those already being enforced elsewhere. Turning to the non-US Dollars, and it’s a similar pattern of trying to draw lines in the sand after further emergency easing, liquidity injections and the first foray into QE for the RBA. The Aussie is hovering around 0.5850 within a 0.5508-0.6303 range, Loonie circa 1.4360 between 1.3735-1.4667 extremes and Kiwi just under 0.5750 having been down to 0.5472 and as high as 0.6153. The Loonie was relatively unreactive after retail sales data on Friday which rose 0.4% above expectations for 0.3% while the core figure slipped to -0.1%, against expectations for a 0.2% gain, however the data was for January therefore rather stale and before the coronavirus took its toll on global economies.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY:</strong> All ending at new or near existing troughs vs the Usd, as the Euro, Yen and Franc succumb to the aforementioned bullish Greenback forces that have propelled it higher this week. The single currency has been undermined by the rapid spread of nCoV to the point that fatalities in Italy now exceed those in China and the case/death toll climbs across the bloc, with the ECB radically adding to its targeted policy stimulus via a mammoth EUR 750bln PEPP to supplement growing Government fiscal packages including German that is getting closer to shelving its debt brake. Conversely, the SNB has been relatively constrained given ongoing and heightened direct intervention, leaving the Government to tap its budget rather than stretching the balance sheet further, but did raise the stakes in terms of the CHF’s valuation from high to even higher. Meanwhile, the BoJ has resorted to more day-to-day asset purchases, for now, as USDJPY probes above 111.45 vs 105.16 at one stage, USDCHF rests much nearer the top of 0.9890-0.9393 bounds than the trough and EURUSD slips through 1.0700 again towards its 1.0654 base compared to 1.1236 earlier in the week when the Dollar was still adjusting to a 100 bp US rate cut and Usd700 bn QE.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM: </strong>Volatile and largely traumatic weeks doesn’t really touch the surface with regard to the fate of the Norwegian and Swedish Crowns after renewed crude selling to fresh post-Saudi Arabia vs Russia price and market share war outbreak lows, the Norges Bank pulling the benchmark depo rate down to 0.25% and Riksbank opting to buy more bonds rather than reverse December’s repo normalisation to zero and re-join the NIRP club. However, the prospect of intervention and independent Euro weakness has kept EURNOK off 13.1678 record peaks, while EURSEK is back within striking distance of 11.0000 compared to 11.3650 at one stage. In terms of EMs, it’s a case of where does one start and realistically there is too much to report or cover in detail, but essentially intervention and other measures to prevent extreme devaluation bordering on capital flight has been commonplace in the face of monetary easing and fiscal expansion to counter the coronavirus contagion. On that note, the SARB exceeded expectations with a full point rate reduction, but the CBR stood pat as anticipated and resorted to defending the Rouble via direct FX action based on a USD 25/bbl base for Brent.</p><p><strong>EMFX:</strong> Brazillian Central Bank cut rates by 50bps in a unanimous decision, deeper than the 25bps consensus, while continuing its FX intervention to aid against the steep BRL declines. The announcement saw USDBRL gap up to c. 5.20, however, the BRL appreciated throughout the cross pared-back throughout the tail end of the week and resides just above the 5.00 handle. Banxico the latest to issue an emergency rate cut, where it cut by 50bps to 6.5%, noting it will add liquidity measures to provide liquidity and improve the functioning of financial markets.</p>",

After seeing its largest recorded gain in history on Thursday, WTI has pared back a majority of the bounce and has fallen back towards the USD 20/bbl figure. This week’s Baker Hughes US Rig Count saw drillers cut rigs by 20 to 772, the largest weekly cut since April 2019.</li><li><strong>On the Russia/Saudi front</strong>, a Russian government spokesperson stated Russia views Saudi’s plan to increase production as blackmail adding it will not back down and “remains ready for contact on prices”, appearing to show no sign of ease of the pricing war, although the Kremlin denies there is a pricing war between the two oil giants. Russia also added that the low oil prices are unpleasant, but not a catastrophe adding it has enough reserves and a sufficient cushion. The Kremlin rebuffed the report on potential US sanctions who were reportedly looking to intervene in the pricing war. However, the latest WSJ reports suggest OPEC is to meet with US shale producers today which could help towards a truce between the world's three largest oil producers, and perhaps resolve the Saudi/Russia pricing war, according to people familiar with the matter which added some support to the benchmarks.</li><li><strong>US Energy officials are pushing the Trump administration to forge an oil alliance with Saudi Arabia</strong>, which could pave the way for Saudi’s to leave OPEC, according to WSJ sources. Also of note, in fitting with source reports yesterday, officials in Texas have reached out to the Trump administration with consideration of a 10% oil production cut if Russia and Saudi did the same.</li></ul>",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Dollar reasserts supreme global reserve status",
        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p><p>When push really comes to shove and a crisis spreads through financial markets into credit, the Greenback’s credentials as the ultimate universal currency appear firmly intact. Indeed, the Buck remains on course to secure whopping gains vs all rivals even though the <strong>DXY</strong> has dipped from best levels just a tick short of 103.000 compared to a low of 97.440, with so called safer havens trailing in wake amidst the scramble for Usd liquidity and cash above all else, including other assets. Moreover, Dollar demand has been almost insatiable at times irrespective of risk sentiment and whether US Treasury yields have been rising, falling in bull or bear steepening mode. However, the Fed’s roll out of more swap lines to various Central Bank counterparts on Thursday, and then subsequent enhancement of liquidity provisions to daily ops from weekly has enabled/helped other G10s to claw back some lost ground.</p><p><strong>GBP/AUD/CAD/NZD</strong></p><p>As noted above, Friday’s major standings are far from indicative or tell the full story, as the Pound rebounds from worst levels near 1.1400, but fades circa 1.1930 and still roughly 5 big figures under weekly highs in wake of the BoE slashing rates to the MPC’s stated lower bound (0.1%) and unleashing an additional Gbp200 bn APF. Meanwhile, the UK Chancellor has pledged over Gbp300 bn in COVID-19 relief and support with more to be revealed shortly as the Government is poised to impose tighter virus containment restrictions akin to those already being enforced elsewhere. Turning to the non-US Dollars, and it’s a similar pattern of trying to draw lines in the sand after further emergency easing, liquidity injections and the first foray into QE for the RBA. The Aussie is hovering around 0.5850 within a 0.5508-0.6303 range, Loonie circa 1.4360 between 1.3735-1.4667 extremes and Kiwi just under 0.5750 having been down to 0.5472 and as high as 0.6153.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All ending at new or near existing troughs vs the Usd, as the Euro, Yen and Franc succumb to the aforementioned bullish Greenback forces that have propelled it higher this week. The single currency has been undermined by the rapid spread of nCoV to the point that fatalities in Italy now exceed those in China and the case/death toll climbs across the bloc, with the ECB radically adding to its targeted policy stimulus via a mammoth Eur750 bn PEPP to supplement growing Government fiscal packages including German that is getting closer to shelving its debt brake. Conversely, the SNB has been relatively constrained given ongoing and heightened direct intervention, leaving the Government to tap its budget rather than stretching the balance sheet further, but did raise the stakes in terms of the Chf’s valuation from high to even higher. Meanwhile, the BoJ has resorted to more day-to-day asset purchases, for now, as Usd/Jpy probes above 111.45 vs 105.16 at one stage, Usd/Chf rests much nearer the top of 0.9890-0.9393 bounds than the trough and Eur/Usd slips through 1.0700 again towards its 1.0654 base compared to 1.1236 earlier in the week when the Dollar was still adjusting to a 100 bp US rate cut and Usd700 bn QE.</p><p><strong>SCANDI/EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Volatile and largely traumatic weeks doesn’t really touch the surface with regard to the fate of the Norwegian and Swedish Crowns after renewed crude selling to fresh post-Saudi Arabia vs Russia price and market share war outbreak lows, the Norges Bank pulling the benchmark depo rate down to 0.25% and Riksbank opting to buy more bonds rather than reverse December’s repo normalisation to zero and re-join the NIRP club. However, the prospect of intervention and independent Euro weakness has kept Eur/Nok off 13.1678 record peaks, while Eur/Sek is back within striking distance of 11.0000 compared to 11.3650 at one stage. In terms of EMs, it’s a case of where does one start and realistically there is too much to report or cover in detail, but essentially intervention and other measure to prevent extreme devaluation bordering on capital flight has been commonplace in the face of monetary easing and fiscal expansion to counter the coronavirus contagion. On that note, the SARB exceeded expectations with a full point rate reduction, but the CBR stood pat as anticipated and resorted to defend the Rouble via direct FX action based on a Usd25/brl base for Brent.</p>",

Elsewhere, similar fade in USTs following forecast beating US housing data, but highly unlikely due to the relatively stale numbers that will be more than overshadowed by forthcoming releases revealing COVID-19 repercussions. Meanwhile, the Dollar has bounced from fairly shallow retracement lows as the DXY meanders between 101.070-102.99, but enhanced and more frequent Fed liquidity provisions appear to have clipped the Greenback’s wings.</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.7%)</strong> was underpinned by supportive measures including the RBA’s first ever QE operation and the Australian Banking Association announcement that banks will defer loan payments for 6 months on small businesses impacted by the outbreak, while real estate led the gains as the sector found restitution from its recent collapse after the big 4 banks lowered business and home loan rates. <strong>KOSPI (+7.4%)</strong> outperformed and triggered a side-car as it atoned for the prior day’s substantial losses and related stoppages, while <strong>Hang Seng (+5.1%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+1.6%)</strong> conformed to the rebound after China’s coronavirus epicentre of Hubei reported no new cases for a 2nd consecutive day, but with gains in the mainland restricted by<strong> continued PBoC inaction in which it skipped liquidity operations again and disappointed calls for a cut to the Prime Loan Rate</strong>.

(Newswires)</strong></p><p><strong>Norges Bank cut rates to 0.25% from 1.0% in an emergency move; unanimous decision - do not rule out further rate cuts. (Newswires)</strong></p><p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p><p><strong>European bourses opened with gains of around 5%, </strong>and subsequently extended on this given a grinding bid in futures as we entered early EU hours; albeit, indices are just off of highs at present. The region remains underpinned by remarks from EU Commission President von der Leyen which received a wider airing – noting the EU is to loosen debt rules, while specific details were not provided this does follow reports out of Germany yesterday that they wish to apply an exemption to the debt brake, while the debt comments from the European Commission are likely in reference to Growth &amp; Stability Pact deficit limits. Following the EU cash open sentiment continued to improve, to the extent that the Nasdaq March’20 future briefly touched the 5% limit-up level at 7649; with the E-mini S&amp;P and DJIA not far from their respective levels (circuit breakers/limit down levels are listed on the Newsquawk headline feed). Sector performance sees all sectors firmly in the green, with some notable outperformance seen in Energy (+7.0%) as the broader crude complex has rebounded significantly after yesterday's sell-off. In terms of individual movers, Osram Lich (+23%) is by some measure the stand-out after AMS confirmed they are to close on their acquisition in Q2. Other movers are largely moving in-line with sector/bourse performance, with a number of the Stoxx 600 laggards arising from the FTSE 100 which has been weighed on by Sterling's substantial resurgence this morning; ahead of measures from Chancellor Sunak.</p><h2>FX</h2><p><strong>USD - </strong>Consolidation and corrective trade in the currency markets after the DXY surged to new peaks a fraction shy of 103.000, with the index back below 102.000 amidst a broad recovery in G10 counterparts and EM rivals that are also getting a reprieve from a relief rally in related commodities.

Similarly, Sterling has not suffered a severe hangover following yesterday’s BoE salvo, as Cable holds well above worst levels within a massive 1.1414-1.1877 range awaiting UK Chancellor Sunak’s supplementary fiscal support package that may be unveiled around noon, while the Loonie is nursing more losses between 1.4151-1.4536 parameters ahead of Canadian retail sales data.</p><p><strong>JPY/CHF/EUR - </strong>Also attempting to regroup, but hampered somewhat by the latest upturn in risk appetite plus holiday impacted Japanese participation due to Vernal Equinox Day.

The benchmarks also experience an underlying bid from reports that the US DoE is planning on stockpiling crude for the SPR. Overall risk appetite also aids the complex in grinding higher after the European Commission President stated that the Union is to loosen debt brakes. WTI May’20 has reclaimed USD 28/bbl to the upside whilst its Brent counterpart gain ground above USD 30.50/bbl, with technicals futile at this stage, meanwhile the spread also widens vs. earlier in the week. Elsewhere, <strong>gold prices</strong> stage a rebound as DXY loses impetus from its recent rally, and as liquidity concerns somewhat fades for the time being amid a string of Fed liquidity announcements. The yellow metal reclaims a USD +1500/oz status having printed a recent trough just above USD 1450/oz. Finally, the overall sentiment bolsters the <strong>red metal</strong> back north of USD 2/lb, having briefly lost the handle during the prior session.</p><p>CME raised crude oil NYMEX futures margins by 20.4% to USD 5600/contract from USD 4650/contract and is reportedly changing its dynamic circuit breakers for oil to 15% from 7%.

        "content": "<p><strong>WTI and Brent front-month futures</strong> extend on yesterday’s rally, which saw prices climb over 20% as the complex was buoyed by signals that US President Trump could intervene in the Saudi/Russia price war at “an appropriate time”, with reports of potential sanctions on Russia in a bid to stabilise markets. The benchmarks also experience an underlying bid from reports that the US DoE is planning on stockpiling crude for the SPR. Overall risk appetite also aids the complex in grinding higher after the European Commission President stated that the Union is to loosen debt brakes. WTI May’20 has reclaimed USD 28/bbl to the upside whilst its Brent counterpart gain ground above USD 30.50/bbl, with technicals futile at this stage, meanwhile the spread also widens vs. earlier in the week. Elsewhere, gold prices stage a rebound as DXY loses impetus from its recent rally, and as liquidity concerns somewhat fades for the time being amid a string of Fed liquidity announcements. The<strong> yellow metal </strong>reclaims a USD +1500/oz status having printed a recent trough just above USD 1450/oz. Finally, the overall sentiment bolsters the<strong> red metal</strong> back north of USD 2/lb, having briefly lost the handle during the prior session.</p>",

At the very least, consolidation and short covering has lifted debt futures further from the depths, and for Bunds a fresh 167.52 contract low at one stage yesterday when the corresponding cash yield breached -15 bp to the upside. However, it remains to be seen whether the current whether the broad comeback lasts as the core Eurozone bond has faded after a brief foray above 170.00 awaiting further direction.</p>",

The region remains underpinned by remarks from EU Commission President von der Leyen which received a wider airing – noting the EU is to loosen debt rules, while specific details were not provided this does follow reports out of Germany yesterday that they wish to apply an exemption to the debt brake, while the debt comments from the European Commission are likely in reference to Growth &amp; Stability Pact deficit limits. Following the EU cash open sentiment continued to improve, to the extent that the <strong>Nasdaq March’20 future</strong> briefly touched the 5% limit-up level at 7649; with the<strong> E-mini S&amp;P and DJIA</strong> not far from their respective levels (circuit breakers/limit down levels are listed on the Newsquawk headline feed). Sector performance sees all sectors firmly in the green, with some notable outperformance seen in <strong>Energy (+8.0%)</strong> as the broader crude complex has rebounded significantly after yesterday's sell-off. In terms of individual movers, Osram Lich (+23%) is by some measure the stand-out after AMS confirmed they are to close on their acquisition in Q2. Other movers are largely moving in-line with sector/bourse performance, with a number of the Stoxx 600 laggards arising from the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> which has been weighed on by Sterling's substantial resurgence this morning; ahead of measures from Chancellor Sunak.</p>",

ASX 200 (+0.7%)</strong> was underpinned by supportive measures including the RBA’s first ever QE operation and the Australian Banking Association announcement that banks will defer loan payments for 6 months on small businesses impacted by the outbreak, while real estate led the gains as the sector found restitution from its recent collapse after the big 4 banks lowered business and home loan rates. <strong>KOSPI (+5.5%)</strong> outperformed and triggered a side-car as it atoned for the prior day’s substantial losses and related stoppages, while <strong>Hang Seng (+2.7%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%)</strong> conformed to the rebound after China’s coronavirus epicentre of Hubei reported no new cases for a 2nd consecutive day, but with gains in the mainland restricted by<strong> continued PBoC inaction in which it skipped liquidity operations again and disappointed calls for a cut to the Prime Loan Rate</strong>.

Nonetheless, the greenback has since pulled back amid further disruptions including California announcing a state-wide stay at home order, with the retracement providing some much needed reprieve for its major counterparts including <strong>EUR/USD</strong> which briefly dipped below the 1.0700 handle in the aftermath of the ECB’s PEPP announcement and alongside the ongoing lockdowns across the bloc. <strong>GBP/USD</strong> continued its recovery from beneath 1.1500 following the fluctuations seen after the BoE’s emergency 15bps cut and APP boost, with focus turning to Chancellor Sunak’s announcement of further support measures later today. Elsewhere, <strong>USD/JPY</strong> retreated below 111.00 to breach support at 110.00 amid the pullback in USD and with Japanese participants on holiday, while antipodeans benefitted overnight amid a rebound in commodities and improved risk appetite but with gains capped in <strong>AUD/USD</strong> and <strong>NZD/USD </strong>by resistance at 0.5900 and 0.5800 respectively, as well as the weakest reference rate setting by the PBoC since 2008.&nbsp;</p><h2>COMMODITIES</h2><p><strong>Commodities were mixed in which WTI crude futures extended on the prior day’s 24% gains</strong> which was the largest on record after supportive comments stateside including Treasury Secretary Mnuchin who suggested to buy USD 10-20bln worth of oil at low prices and after the DoE formally requested to buy up to 30mln bbls. Furthermore, US President Trump suggested that he will get involved in the oil dispute at an appropriate time and the rebound in stocks helped sustain the upside momentum for crude prices. Elsewhere, <strong>gold </strong>benefitted as the greenback pulled back from 3-year highs but with upside limited by the improved risk appetite, while <strong>copper</strong> lagged its peers after prices recently slipped to beneath USD 2.00/lb which was its lowest in 4 years.</p><p><strong>US President Trump said at an appropriate time he will get involved in the oil market dispute, while a separate source report suggested US officials are looking at intervening in the Russia-Saudi dispute and possibility of imposing sanctions on the Russians.

ASX 200 (+0.7%) was underpinned by supportive measures including the RBA’s first ever QE operation and the Australian Banking Association announcement that banks will defer loan payments for 6 months on small businesses impacted by the outbreak, while real estate led the gains as the sector found restitution from its recent collapse after the big 4 banks lowered business and home loan rates. KOSPI (+5.5%) outperformed and triggered a side-car as it atoned for the prior day’s substantial losses and related stoppages, while Hang Seng (+2.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) conformed to the rebound after China’s coronavirus epicentre of Hubei reported no new cases for a 2nd consecutive day, but with gains in the mainland restricted by continued PBoC inaction in which it skipped liquidity operations again and disappointed calls for a cut to the Prime Loan Rate. As a reminder, Japanese markets remained closed for Vernal Equinox holiday.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as the region takes its cue from the mild rebound on Wall St amid continued policy efforts to contain the coronavirus fallout including the latest 15bps emergency cut by the BoE and with the US Senate working on a deal which would provide USD 1200 cash payment to individuals. ASX 200 (+2.9%) initially outperformed amid the supportive measures including the RBA’s first ever QE operation and the Australian Banking Association announcement that banks will defer loan payments for 6 months on small businesses impacted by the outbreak, while real estate leads the gains as the sector finds restitution from the recent collapse after the big 4 banks lowered business and home loan rates. KOSPI (+3.9%) also sits on firm gains and triggered a side-car as it atones for the prior day’s substantial losses and related stoppages, while Hang Seng (+2.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) conform to the broad rebound after China’s coronavirus epicentre of Hubei reported no new cases for a 2nd consecutive day, with markets unfazed despite continued PBoC inaction in which it skipped liquidity operations again and refrained from cutting the Prime Loan Rate. As a reminder, Japanese markets remained closed for Vernal Equinox holiday.</p><p>In FX markets, the rally in the USD finally lost steam after having surged to a 3-year high and briefly approached just of the 103.00 level which had been spurred by the rush for cash. Nonetheless, the greenback has since pulled back amid further disruptions including California announcing a state-wide stay at home order, with the retracement providing some much needed reprieve for its major counterparts including EUR/USD which had briefly dipped below the 1.0700 handle in the aftermath of the ECB’s PEPP announcement and alongside the ongoing lockdowns across the bloc, while GBP/USD continues to rebound from beneath 1.1500 following the fluctuations seen after the BoE’s emergency 15bps cut and APP boost, with focus now turning to Chancellor Sunak’s announcement of further support measures later today. Elsewhere, USD/JPY retreated below 111.00 to test support at 110.00 amid the pullback in USD and with Japanese participants on holiday, while antipodeans also benefitted overnight amid rebound in commodities and improved risk appetite but with gains capped in AUD/USD and NZD/USD by resistance at 0.5900 and 0.5800 respectively, as well as the weakest reference rate setting by the PBoC since 2008.</p>",
