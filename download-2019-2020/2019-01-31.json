Trump also said he thinks he can get a China deal completed by March 1st but may not be totally written down and that China talks will &quot;certainly&quot; be talking about IP theft and Fentanyl.&nbsp; Furthermore, Trump later commented that he has seen progress from China on IP and technology but that does not mean there will be a deal, while he said a US delegation will visit China soon and thinks everything will be agreed to when he meets Chinese President Xi. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USTR Lighthizer said talks with China made substantial progress and that there is still much work to do, while he added that talks focussed on structural issues and enforcement. There were also comments from the US Chamber of Commerce that it understands China trade negotiations have made progress on IP rights enforcement and market access in China although there was no progress on forced technology transfers and industrial subsidies. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a letter, China President Xi told US President Trump he hopes both sides will meet half way to reach an early trade deal, while Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is also hopeful of a trade deal with the US and hopes to accelerate 90-day period for deal.

Facebook (FB) surged after beating top and bottom line estimates. Tesla (TSLA) beat revenue estimates and missed EPS estimates but opened lower on the back of it announcing its CFO departing. Other strong earnings were reported General Electric (GE), Qualcomm (QCOM), Charter Communications (CHTR), United Parcel Service (UPS), Mondelez (MDLZ), Valero (VLO), Mastercard (MA), Conoco Phillips (COP) and Baker Hughes (BHGE) all traded up on the open. Conversely, DowDuPont (DWDP) dipped after lowering guidance, Visa (V) traded in the red after affirming low double-digit revenue growth for the year whilst competitor PayPal (PYPL) also underperformed after a miss on revenue estimates. Intel (INTC) sold off on the back of it appointing its interim CEO Bob Swan as its permanent CEO. Discovery (DISCA) surged on rumours it would consider selling itself to CBS (CBS). Pfizer (PFE) benefitted from an upgrade at Credit Suisse. eBay (EBAY) underperformed on the back of activist investor Elliott Management proposing a separation of StubHub and Classifieds. Looking ahead, Amazon (AMZN) report after the close today. SPX +0.86% at 2704, NASDAQ +1.45% at 6907, DJI -0.06% at 25000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>T-Note futures pushed higher through the course of the day, fuelled by risk factors such as Italy entering a recession and disappointing US jobless claims. The treasury complex saw further upticks after a disappointing Chicago PMI, whilst the market ignored the strong November New Home Sales. There was modest flattening across the front to belly of the curve whilst the 2s/30s steepened by 1.5bps. US T-note futures (H9) settled up 15 ticks at 122-15.</p>\r\n",

Chinese negotiators proposed a meeting in China next month between Trump and Chinese President Xi. Trump said he wanted a big trade deal, otherwise he will postpone it, although he believes a deal will be completed, with Xi agreeing to everything, by March 1st; Trump has not extended the deadline. US Chamber of Commerce said progress had been made on IP theft and market access in China, but not on forced technology transfers and industrial subsidies. In a letter, China President Xi told US President Trump he hopes both sides will meet half way to reach an early trade deal. Following the talks, Vice Premier Liu said he was hopeful of a trade deal with the US and hopes to accelerate 90-day period for deal, USTR Lighthizer said talks made substantial progress, but there was still much work to do and that the talks focussed on structural issues and enforcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Weidmann (Hawk) said that German GDP will likely grow &quot;well below&quot; 1.5% in 2019, and 2019 EZ inflation could be noticeably lower than the ECB&#39;s Dec projection due to crude prices. He also said that the ECB&#39;s room for manoeuvre has decreased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC:</strong> BoC&#39;s Wilkins said that the Canadian economy is set to pick up in Q2, and should lead to a pickup in wage growth. She also added that the bank will do its part to meet its inflation objective and made no mention of a need for rate hikes or the likely pace of any future hikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHICAGO PMI:</strong> The January Chicago PMI print missed expectations, and was lower than the most pessimistic analyst forecast, coming in at 56.7, falling from 65.4. &quot;We have argued for some time that conditions in manufacturing are likely to deteriorate further over the next few months, and this drop in the Chicago PMI, to a 24-month low, is consistent with our view.&nbsp; China&rsquo;s sharp slowdown - which is much worse than the official data suggest - has not yet fully worked through the U.S. data, so this probably does not mark the bottom for the Chicago PMI,&quot; Pantheon Macroeconomics said. &quot;The good news, if there is any, is that the drop in the Chicago index looks more like a catch-up after the December plunge in the ISM index, rather than a clear signal of another ISM drop next week. But that&rsquo;s not much comfort, because the trends in all the key surveys are deteriorating.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NEW HOME SALES:</strong> November&rsquo;s New Home Sales came in at a 657,000-unit pace, an increase of 16.9% and the strongest since March. Analysts at Wells Fargo note, &ldquo;With higher interest rates making potential buyers hesitant, builders are offering larger discounts, which is apparent in the price data.&rdquo; Buyers are becoming incentivised by price drops, where the median price has fallen 11.9% YY. Comparing the pace figure to this time last year shows a decline, although this largely due to the exceptionally strong end to 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.44 LOWER AT USD 53.79/BBL, BRENT (H9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 0.24 HIGHER AT USD 61.89/BBL. </strong>Oil prices extended gains on Thursday dictated by improved risk sentiment on growing optimism on China trade talks and in the aftermath of a dovish Fed. The energy complex was also supported by the first OPEC estimates showing a decline in oil output of 890k BPD to 3.098mln BDP with the biggest drop seen in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait; Citi sees nothing &ldquo;in the mix sufficient to fully offset the impact of the drop in OPEC supply&rdquo;. Elsewhere, Venezuelan sanctions seem to have a muted impact in the oil market thus far as the US already stated that any shortfalls in output will be countered with the use of the US SPR; sources reported US refiners have started cutting crude processing due to weak gasoline margins and higher oil cost after sanctions. Also, disruptions were reported at the BP-Husky refinery where output was modestly cut due to operational issues amid extreme cold weather and at the gasoline-making unit at the Catlettsburg, KY refinery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.86% at 2704, NASDAQ +1.45% at 6907, DJI -0.06% at 25000. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +0.71%, Materials -1.54%, Industrials +0.45%, Cons Discretionary +1.09%, Cons Staples +1.82%, Healthcare +1.13%, Financials -0.27%, Tech -0.12%, Telecoms +3.74%, Utilities +2.07%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> US heavyweight Microsoft (MSFT) missed on EPS estimates and came in line with revenue estimates, but underperformed after PC revenue came in light. Facebook (FB) surged after beating top and bottom line estimates. Tesla (TSLA) beat revenue estimates and missed EPS estimates but opened lower on the back of it announcing its CFO departing. Other strong earnings were reported General Electric (GE), Qualcomm (QCOM), Charter Communications (CHTR), United Parcel Service (UPS), Mondelez (MDLZ), Valero (VLO), Mastercard (MA), Conoco Phillips (COP) and Baker Hughes (BHGE) all traded up on the open. Conversely, DowDuPont (DWDP) dipped after lowering guidance, Visa (V) traded in the red after affirming low double-digit revenue growth for the year whilst competitor PayPal (PYPL) also underperformed after a miss on revenue estimates. Intel (INTC) sold off on the back of it appointing its interim CEO Bob Swan as its permanent CEO. Discovery (DISCA) surged on rumours it would consider selling itself to CBS (CBS). Pfizer (PFE) benefitted from an upgrade at Credit Suisse. eBay (EBAY) underperformed on the back of activist investor Elliott Management proposing a separation of StubHub and Classifieds. Looking ahead, Amazon (AMZN) report after the close today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (H9) SETTLED UP 15 TICKS AT 122-15. </strong>T-Note futures pushed higher through the course of the day, fuelled by risk factors such as Italy entering a recession and disappointing US jobless claims. The treasury complex saw further upticks after a disappointing Chicago PMI, whilst the market ignored the strong November New Home Sales. There was modest flattening across the front to belly of the curve whilst the 2s/30s steepened by 1.5bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Dollar has clawed some gains, perhaps on month-end factors, despite last night&rsquo;s more dovish than expected Fed policy guidance, as attention turns to US-China trade talks ahead of NFP on Friday. Initial reports on the former via President Trump were encouraging, but he subsequently set the bar high for negotiations by tweeting that his aim is to reach a &lsquo;complete&rsquo; deal with the delegation from Beijing, leaving no issues unresolved, and this will not be possible unless China facilitates access to US manufacturers, agricultural companies and other industries, not just financial services. The DXY is currently just off a marginal new post-Fed recovery high of 95.423 and back above its 200 DMA (95.290), which may bode well, if only from a technical perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD: </strong>The Kiwi has eclipsed its antipodean counterpart to head the G10 ranks and forge firmer gains above the 0.6900 level vs the Usd. To recap, aside from the broad Greenback selling in wake of the FOMC, Nzd gains have been spurred by S&amp;P upbeat NZ credit review and shift to ratings watch positive overnight, with the outlook lifted from stable previously. Offers between 0.6930-50 now being nibbled, while the Aud/Nzd cross is drifting back towards 1.0500 as Aud/Usd remains capped ahead of 0.7300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF:</strong> Also deriving comfort/support from the weaker Usd, as Usd/Jpy trades near the middle of a 109.05-108.50 range and the Franc nestles closer to the top of 0.9950-20 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP, CAD:</strong> All relatively flat vs the Buck; the EUR was unable to sustain 1.1500+ momentum given more weak Eurozone data that suggests the ECB may follow in the footsteps of the Fed and switch to a more accommodative stance with an official roll-back of rate hike guidance and/or signal that further stimulus is in the offing via extra liquidity. Meanwhile, the Pound remains hampered by Brexit and Cable continues to struggle on forays above 1.3150 as a result, although Eur/Gbp also looks toppy over 0.8750. The Loonie is holding closer to the top of a 1.3165-20 band despite soft Canadian data in the form of November GDP and December PPI, as another upturn in crude prices and the overriding softer Buck weigh on Usd/Cad.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Venezuelan sanctions seem to have a muted impact in the oil market thus far as the US already stated that any shortfalls in output will be countered with the use of the US SPR; sources reported US refiners have started cutting crude processing due to weak gasoline margins and higher oil cost after sanctions. Also, disruptions were reported at the BP-Husky refinery where output was modestly cut due to operational issues amid extreme cold weather and at the gasoline-making unit at the Catlettsburg, KY refinery.</p>\r\n",

Initial reports on the former via President Trump were encouraging, but he subsequently set the bar high for negotiations by tweeting that his aim is to reach a &lsquo;complete&rsquo; deal with the delegation from Beijing, leaving no issues unresolved, and this will not be possible unless China facilitates access to US manufacturers, agricultural companies and other industries, not just financial services. The DXY is currently just off a marginal new post-Fed recovery high of 95.423 and back above its 200 DMA (95.290), which may bode well, if only from a technical perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi has eclipsed its antipodean counterpart to head the G10 ranks and forge firmer gains above the 0.6900 level vs the Usd. To recap, aside from the broad Greenback selling in wake of the FOMC, Nzd gains have been spurred by S&amp;P upbeat NZ credit review and shift to ratings watch positive overnight, with the outlook lifted from stable previously. Offers between 0.6930-50 now being nibbled, while the Aud/Nzd cross is drifting back towards 1.0500 as Aud/Usd remains capped ahead of 0.7300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also deriving comfort/support from the weaker Usd, as Usd/Jpy trades near the middle of a 109.05-108.50 range and the Franc nestles closer to the top of 0.9950-20 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All relatively flat vs the Buck, with the single currency unable to sustain 1.1500+ momentum given more weak Eurozone data that suggests the ECB may follow in the footsteps of the Fed and switch to a more accommodative stance with an official roll-back of rate hike guidance and/or signal that further stimulus is in the offing via extra liquidity. Meanwhile, the Pound remains hampered by Brexit and Cable continues to struggle on forays above 1.3150 as a result, although Eur/Gbp also looks toppy over 0.8750. The Loonie is holding closer to the top of a 1.3165-20 band despite soft Canadian data in the form of November GDP and December PPI, as another upturn in crude prices and the overriding softer Buck weigh on Usd/Cad. Note, however, downside chart supports at 1.3120 (Fib) and 1.3126 (200 DMA) may limit further downside ahead of a speech by BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) both initially benefitted from the rising tide in the aftermath of the FOMC, although weakness in Australia&rsquo;s largest weighted financial sector later dragged on the local bourse, while a slew of corporate updates shared the focus for Japan. Hang Seng (+1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) conformed to the positive tone following better than expected Chinese Manufacturing PMI and Non-Manufacturing PMI data, while another PBoC liquidity injection ahead of next week&rsquo;s Lunar New Year and ongoing US-China trade talks also contributed to the optimism. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially higher as they tracked the upside in T-notes post-FOMC and as the BoJ Summary of Opinions unsurprisingly reiterated the need to persistently continue powerful monetary easing, although gains were later pared despite stronger 2yr auction results as upside was restricted by the firm risk sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 14-day reverse repos.

Furthermore, the BoJ stated that risks to overseas economies are tilted to the downside, while there was an opinion that there is room for JGB purchases to be revised and that If downside risks to economy and prices materialize, the BoJ should be ready to respond with policy.

FTSE 100 (+0.5%) is benefitting from Shell (+4.1%) and Diageo (+4.0%) due to both companies&rsquo; earnings beating on expectations; Shell&rsquo;s strong performance has subsequently led to outperformance in the energy sector (+2.3%). The SMI (U/C) is the underperforming sector, weighed on by Swatch (-5.4%) who are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after their FY group sales missed expectations; although losses are capped by strong performance in Roche (+2.2%) following their earnings. Other notable movers include, Unilever (-3.7%) who anticipate 2019 underlying sales growth at the bottom of their 3-5% range; and as such are down on the day. Elsewhere, Wirecard (+1.8%) have recouped some of the losses seen in the previous session due to an FT article reporting that an executive has been accused of using forged contracts. And BT (-2.6%) are down despite reiterating EBITDA guidance at the top end of expectations for FY18/19, as Philip Jansen is to take over as CEO from Gavin Patterson on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD -The odds looked stacked against the Greenback following an arguably even more dovish twist from the FOMC than many or most were looking for (effectively announced a pause in the tightening cycle, with patience going forward and not necessarily further hikes at this stage, or much more balance sheet reduction). This, coupled with some &lsquo;strong&rsquo; sell signals for month end portfolio rebalancing saw the Buck slump to new recent lows vs G10 peers, while the DXY slipped under its 200 DMA (95.290) at one stage to 95.127 before stabilising and perhaps benefiting from early SOMA-related positioning (front-running ahead of the usual flow window).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The main beneficiary of post-Fed Dollar weakness and pronounced US Treasury curve bull-steepening, as Usd/Jpy reversed sharply from 109.50+ peaks into the FOMC to circa 108.50. Note, however, option expiries between 108.90-109.00 in 1 bn may limit further downside in the headline pair ahead of the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - Also revelling in the broadly bearish Usd hue, plus a revival in risk appetite, which partly Fed induced and underscored by improvements in China&rsquo;s manufacturing and services PMIs overnight. Aud/Usd is consolidating off fresh multi-week highs circa 0.7275 having blasted through daily tech resistance around 0.7207 that had been containing advances ahead of the FOMC, while Nzd/Usd is pivoting 0.6900 with the Kiwi drawing additional momentum from S&amp;P&rsquo;s NZ rating outlook upgrade to positive from stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/CAD - All firmer vs the US Dollar, albeit marginally, as Cable continues to trade heavily around 1.3150 amidst the ongoing Brexit hiatus, while the Franc remains in a 0.9900-50 range and Loonie meanders between 1.3120-55 awaiting some independent impetus from looming Canadian GDP and PPI data before a speech from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency finally breached its 100 DMA around 1.1443, and 1.1450 on its way to a 1.1515 peak vs the Usd, but has been undermined by more poor Eurozone data in the shape of German retail sales and Italian GDP (both negative and worse than forecast). Note, the aforementioned SOMA interests also have a tendency to weigh on Eur/Usd more than other Usd/major pairings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts both took another look at intraday highs around the release of EZ GDP data (meagre in terms of the pan Eurozone print, and just plain bleak for Italy that is in a technical recession), but the core EU bonds were unable to extend further to the upside and have subsequently topped out again within 165.31-63 and 123.36-57 ranges. This mirrors recent price action in US Treasuries, although the latter did carve out new overnight session peaks with the aid of a hefty 10.5k+ block purchase of 10s that also augmented curve re-flattening. Ahead, more pre-NFP proxies after Wednesday&rsquo;s upbeat ADP survey, Chicago PMI and new home sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A relatively mixed session in the commodities complex thus far, as the energy benchmarks pare back a bulk of yesterday&rsquo;s Fed-induced gains with WTI (-0.2%) drifting into negative territory and Brent (+0.5%) off best levels. Oil prices have been on a downwards trajectory for most of the EU session with a brief Brent dip below USD 61.50/bbl, coinciding with the Iraqi oil ministry stating 40 oil wells are to be drilled in the Southern Manjoon oilfield. As reference the Manjoon oil field is estimated to have reserves of almost 12.6bln barrels. Otherwise, new-flow has been light in the complex with traders keeping a close eye on US-Sino trade developments with Vice Premier Liu He due to meet US President Trump at the Oval office around 20:30 GMT. On the Venezuelan front, Chinese energy giant PetroChina is reportedly planning to drop Venezuelan state-owned PDVSA amid the US oil sanctions on the company in the backdrop of Venezuela&rsquo;s political turmoil. The sanctions seem to have a muted impact in the oil market thus far as US already stated that any shortfalls in output will be countered with the use of the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Meanwhile, prices are somewhat underpinned by the OPEC production cuts with figures stating output amongst the members fell 900k BPD, (vs. 800K planned at the latest meeting); as according to JBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, metal prices are supported by the still-subdued dollar with spot gold poised to end the month with a fourth consecutive monthly gain, prices reached levels last seen in May 2018 as the yellow metal advances above USD 1320/oz. Citigroup notes that the precious metal is benefitting from a weaker buck alongside safe-haven buyers hedging against the outcome of the US-China trade talks. Moving on, nickel and steel prices are expected to be weighed on by a soaring output of the raw material in China and Indonesia and as such, BMO analysts expect the nickel deficit to narrow to 96k tonnes in 2019 vs. current 129k tonnes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian oil output has been reduced to 11.38mln bpd in January, according to Interfax. (Interfax) In the period of Jan 1st-22nd, Russia slightly increased its output to 11.39mln BPD according to a source familiar with the Energy Ministry data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC output fell 900k BPD in January as cuts started as according to JBC.

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The odds looked stacked against the Greenback following an arguably even more dovish twist from the FOMC than many or most were looking for (effectively announced a pause in the tightening cycle, with patience going forward and not necessarily further hikes at this stage, or much more balance sheet reduction). This, coupled with some &lsquo;strong&rsquo; sell signals for month end portfolio rebalancing saw the Buck slump to new recent lows vs G10 peers, while the DXY slipped under its 200 DMA (95.290) at one stage to 95.127 before stabilising and perhaps benefiting from early SOMA-related positioning (front-running ahead of the usual flow window).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main beneficiary of post-Fed Dollar weakness and pronounced US Treasury curve bull-steepening, as Usd/Jpy reversed sharply from 109.50+ peaks into the FOMC to circa 108.50. Note, however, option expiries between 108.90-109.00 in 1 bn may limit further downside in the headline pair ahead of the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also revelling in the broadly bearish Usd hue, plus a revival in risk appetite, which partly Fed induced and underscored by improvements in China&rsquo;s manufacturing and services PMIs overnight. Aud/Usd is consolidating off fresh multi-week highs circa 0.7275 having blasted through daily tech resistance around 0.7207 that had been containing advances ahead of the FOMC, while Nzd/Usd is pivoting 0.6900 with the Kiwi drawing additional momentum from S&amp;P&rsquo;s NZ rating outlook upgrade to positive from stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All firmer vs the US Dollar, albeit marginally, as Cable continues to trade heavily around 1.3150 amidst the ongoing Brexit hiatus, while the Franc remains in a 0.9900-50 range and Loonie meanders between 1.3120-55 awaiting some independent impetus from looming Canadian GDP and PPI data before a speech from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency finally breached its 100 DMA around 1.1443, and 1.1450 on its way to a 1.1515 peak vs the Usd, but has been undermined by more poor Eurozone data in the shape of German retail sales and Italian GDP (both negative and worse than forecast). Note, the aforementioned SOMA interests also have a tendency to weigh on Eur/Usd more than other Usd/major pairings.</p>\r\n",

Fed chair Powell reinforced the marked change in guidance and stance during the ensuing press conference, and US Treasuries bull-steepened accordingly, irrespective of Wall Street&rsquo;s rally and a broader ramp up in risk sentiment. Back to Eurex, Bund buyers will note nearest chart resistance around 165.69 (continuation high) ahead of 165.98, but the corresponding 10 year cash yield may encounter some underlying bids approaching 0.15% and ahead of early month lows just below.

The message of patience was reiterated with the Fed removing the reference to hike rates gradually. The language on the balance of risks (was &quot;roughly balanced) was dropped. Its view of the economy was tweaked to &quot;solid&quot; from a previous &quot;strong&quot;.

(+0.4%) conformed to the positive tone following better than expected Chinese Manufacturing PMI and Non-Manufacturing PMI data, while another PBoC liquidity injection ahead of next week&rsquo;s Lunar New Year and ongoing US-China trade talks also contributed to the optimism. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially higher as they tracked the upside in T-notes post-FOMC and as the BoJ Summary of Opinions unsurprisingly reiterated the need to persistently continue powerful monetary easing, although gains were later pared despite stronger 2yr auction results as upside was restricted by the firm risk sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 14-day reverse repos.

High-beta currencies were also lifted by the USD weakness and heightened risk appetite with NZD/USD getting an added push from a rating outlook upgrade by S&amp;P, while USD/JPY relinquished the 109.00 handle due to the Fed and USD/CNY briefly fell below 6.7000 after the PBoC set the firmest fix since July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S&amp;P raised New Zealand Outlook to Positive from Stable, while it affirmed its AA rating.

Elsewhere, the US Treasury announced next week it will sell USD 38bln in 3yr, USD 27bln in 10yr and USD 19bln in 30yr; to raise USD 29.9bln in new cash; as expected.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks were mostly higher across the board as they took impetus from their counterparts in US where sentiment was lifted on the back of earnings and a dovish Fed, while the region also digested better than expected Chinese PMI data. ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) both initially benefitted from the rising tide in the aftermath of the FOMC, although weakness in Australia&rsquo;s largest weighted financial sector later dragged on the local bourse, while a slew of corporate updates shared the focus for Japan. Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) conformed to the positive tone following better than expected Chinese Manufacturing PMI and Non-Manufacturing PMI data, while another PBoC liquidity injection ahead of next week&rsquo;s Lunar New Year and ongoing US-China trade talks also contributed to the optimism. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially higher as they tracked the upside in T-notes post-FOMC and as the BoJ Summary of Opinions unsurprisingly reiterated the need to persistently continue powerful monetary easing, although gains were later pared despite stronger 2yr auction results as upside was restricted by the firm risk sentiment.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are higher across the board as the region takes impetus from US where sentiment was lifted on the back of earnings and a dovish Fed, while participants also digest better than expected Chinese PMI data. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) benefit from the rising tide in the aftermath of the FOMC, although weakness in Australia&rsquo;s largest weighted financial sector has capped upside in the local bourse while a slew of corporate updates also take focus in Japan. Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) conform to the positive tone following better than expected Chinese Manufacturing PMI (49.5 vs. Exp. 49.3, Prev. 49.4) and Non-Manufacturing PMI (54.7 vs. Exp. 53.9, Prev. 53.8) data, despite the headline showing a contraction for the 2nd consecutive month. In addition, the PBoC continued to inject liquidity ahead of next week&rsquo;s Lunar New Year and ongoing US-China trade talks also contribute to the optimism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY was pressured in the wake of the dovish FOMC announcement where the Fed said that it is prepared to adjust the balance sheet normalisation process and removed its reference to gradual rate hikes, while Fed Chair Powell constantly repeated a reference to being &lsquo;patient&rsquo;. This benefitted the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts in which EUR/USD tested 1.1500 and helped GBP/USD recover from some of the recent Brexit-related woes to climb back above the 1.3100 level. High-beta currencies were also lifted by the USD weakness and heightened risk appetite with NZD/USD getting an added push from a rating outlook upgrade by S&amp;P, while USD/JPY relinquished the 109.00 handle due to the Fed and USD/CNY briefly fell below 6.7000 after the PBoC set the firmest fix since July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they tracked the upside in T-notes post-FOMC and with the BoJ Summary of Opinions unsurprisingly reiterating the need to persistently continue powerful monetary easing, although gains are limited by the firm risk sentiment and ahead of a 2yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
