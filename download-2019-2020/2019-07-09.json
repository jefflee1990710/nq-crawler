(Newswires/WSJ)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p><p>Apple (AAPL) shares were supported on positive broker comments, including from Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley. Boeing (BA) was under pressure after disappointing orders data, however did later see some upside after on the news that Qatar was planning to buy “large numbers” of Boeing commercial jets, although when the disappointing details of this transaction were revealed (just five 777S jets) the move was reversed. Netflix (NFLX) was buoyant after positive comments from Cowen. Merck (MRK) moved higher up after a judge struck down a Trump administration bill that would force drug makers to include the cost of medications in TV adverts and on further Keytruda progression with the FDA. Macy’s Inc (M) jumped higher on takeover chatter. Hotel names, including Marriot (MAR) and Hilton (HLT), were under pressure after JPM said it was increasingly cautious on US lodging firms. DaVita Inc (DVA) and Fresenius Medical Care (FMS) fell on a Politico report that the Trump administration is planning to encourage more kidney transplants and at-home dialysis.

Square (SQ) shares jumped higher on an upgrade at Raymond James, who said they see no negative catalysts on the horizon.

S&amp;P 500 0.1% at 2980, NASDAQ-100 0.5% at 7827, Dow Jones -0.1% at 26785.</p><p>Ranges were thin as traders wait on cues from Fed Chair Powell, who is due to testify to lawmakers on Wednesday. A 'double' rate cut of 50bps at the July FOMC has been priced out, and the question, analysts say is what is the Fed's conviction of the trajectory of rates through to the end of the year; currently around 2.5 rate hikes are priced in by money markets by the end of 2019; the median Fed 'dot' sees rates unchanged for the rest of the year. Ahead of the Fedspeak, the US Treasury sold 3-year notes at 1.857%, the lowest high yield since November 2017; the sale stopped through the screens by 0.1bps. Cover was soft, the lowest since March 2019. The breakdown, meanwhile, saw indirect participation pare back (48.5% vs 56.6% prior), with direct participation rising to 17.9% from 13.4%, and dealers taking from 30.0% prior. US T-note futures (U9) settled 6+ ticks lower at 127-09+.</p>",

Meanwhile, Fed's Bostic (non-voter) said Fed is debating the merits and risks of running a hot labour market; adds there are risks of the labour market becoming too tight.</p><p><strong>* POWELL TESTIMONY (WED)/FED MINUTES PREVIEW (WED): </strong>Minutes to the FOMC’s June meeting might be overshadowed by the timelier dual-testimonies that Fed Chair Powell will deliver to lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday. However, traders will look to both Powell’s remarks and the meeting minutes to gauge not only the prospects of a 25bps/50bps rate cut at the July meeting, but also the trajectory of the Fed’s rate path through to the end of the year. The markets have priced out the prospects of the ‘double’ rate cut after a solid employment situation report last week; however, other risks, especially prices and global growth, could still give the FOMC optionality to loosen policy. The minutes will be released at 1900 BST/1400 EDT on 10th July 2019.

Deutsche Bank noted that imports of fabricated structural steel from China and Mexico in 2018 were valued at an estimated USD 897.5mln and USD 622.4mln respectively, and in the greater scheme of things, it is relatively small; however, the optics are key, given the tense stage of trade negotiations between the US and China, the bank said. Elsewhere, Russia has undertaken a complaint at the WTO challenging US anti-dumping measures on the import of hot-rolled steel from Russia, according to a WTO filing.</p><p><strong>* CHINA:</strong> China’s Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng warned of ‘disastrous consequences’ if the US treats China as an enemy and criticized Washington over reports some Chinese-American scientists were treated unfairly in the US. Later, USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Sec Mnuchin spoke with China Vice Premier Liu He today to \"continue negotiations aimed at resolving the outstanding trade disputes between the US and China,\" US official says, adding talks will continue \"as appropriate\". Also, the US announced it has approved USD 2.2bln of arms sales to Taiwan, in a move likely to irritate China; one Chinese reporter stated that if the US sold arms to Taiwan, Beijing would task the PLA (China army) would destroy the weapons, adding that in that scenario, geopolitical tensions would be escalated.</p><p><strong>* GEOPOLITICAL:</strong> A US official said it is still mulling sanctions on Iran foreign minister Zarif; Zarif on Twitter said US National Security Advisor Bolton and Israel PM Netanyahu killed the Paris agreement in 2005 by insisting on zero enrichment, Iran then increased enrichment 100 fold by 2012, and Zarif said now, US President Trump has been lured into killing the JCPOA with the same delusion. Later, reports said that several secret meetings between US and Iranian officials took place in Iraq last week, according to I24News, citing Iranian sources. With regards to Turkey, EU is reportedly considering cutting European Investment Bank funding to Turkey and the suspension of aviation talks, according to sources.</p><p><strong>* BOC PREVIEW: </strong>The BOC is expected to keep rates unchanged at 1.75%. There will be attention on whether the Bank chooses to tweak forward guidance and introduce an easing bias; however, most analysts are of the view that the BOC will avoid doing this, and reiterate the current stance remains appropriate. The MPR will likely see near-term growth forecasts upgraded, though will likely revise down its view of global growth; the output gap and inflation estimates could be nudged higher. Rate decision and MPR due for release at 1500 BST/1000 EDT, and the post-meeting press conference with Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins will begin at 1615 BST/1115 EDT.

Later, Grieve tabled another amendment which lawmakers voted in favour of, which requires Parliament to provide fortnightly reports to be made after the conference recess until a Northern Irish Executive is formed, or until the December recess; analysts said that this technically does not rule out prorogation, and accordingly, prorogation could still be a strategy used by a future government. On the other side of the House, UK Jeremy Corbyn has written to Labour members saying the new Prime Minister should \"put their deal, or no deal, back to the people in a public vote\" saying Labour would campaign for remain against \"no deal or a Tory deal that does not protect the economy and jobs\".&nbsp; Meanwhile, BRC retail sales data overnight printed -1.6% Y/Y, in another sign that the UK economy slowed in Q2.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 6+ TICKS LOWER AT 127-09+: </strong>Ranges were thin as traders wait on cues from Fed Chair Powell, who is due to testify to lawmakers on Wednesday. A 'double' rate cut of 50bps at the July FOMC has been priced out, and the question, analysts say is what is the Fed's conviction of the trajectory of rates through to the end of the year; currently around 2.5 rate hikes are priced in by money markets by the end of 2019; the median Fed 'dot' sees rates unchanged for the rest of the year. Ahead of the Fedspeak, the US Treasury sold 3-year notes at 1.857%, the lowest high yield since November 2017; the sale stopped through the screens by 0.1bps. Cover was soft, the lowest since March 2019. The breakdown, meanwhile, saw indirect participation pare back (48.5% vs 56.6% prior), with direct participation rising to 17.9% from 13.4%, and dealers taking from 30.0% prior.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Q9) SETTLES USD 0.17 HIGHER AT USD 57.83; BRENT (U9) SETTLES USD 0.05 HIGHER AT USD 64.16. </strong>The energy complex got off on the front foot on Tuesday, but gains were pared back as we approached settlement, leaving crude mixed, with participants likely keeping their powder dry ahead of the energy inventories/heavy slate of Fedspeak, where crude traders will be keeping an ear out for commentary on global growth. There was not too much in the way of substantial developments in the oil market on Tuesday, with analysts noting the same narratives of geopolitical risk being price supportive and global growth concerns providing headwinds. However, it was reported that Russia’s oil output fell to 10.79mln BPD in the beginning of July, down from 11.15mln BPD in June; although a promising sign for OPEC+ production cut compliance, it’s unlikely that this much of a cut was voluntary given the production problems in Russia, with a growing divide between the state-owned pipeline monopoly Transneft and the country’s largest producer Rosneft due to the handling of the contaminated oil which has plagued supply out of the region. After the bell the API will report its US energy inventory figures, where analysts look for headline crude stocks to draw by 3.1mln (Cushing expected to draw by 420k); distillates are seen building 0.7mln, and gasoline is seen drawing 1.3mln.</p><p><strong>* EIA STEO: </strong>The agency cuts 2019 world oil demand growth view by 150k/day to 1.07mln BPD; 2020 world oil demand growth cut by 20k BPD to 1.40mln BPD. The IEA monthly report and the OPEC MOMR are to be released later in the week. EIA lowered its US output forecast for 2019 to 12.36mln BPD (prev. 12.62mln BPD) and forecasts US crude output to rise by 900k BPD in 2020, to 13.26mln BPD (prev. forecast to rise 940k BPD).</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 0.1% at 2980, NASDAQ-100 0.5% at 7827, Dow Jones -0.1% at 26785, Sectors; </strong>Consumer Discretionary 0.3%, Consumer Staples -0.6%, Energy 0.1%, Financials 0.3%, Health Care 0.1%, Industrials -0.2%, Information Technology 0.3%, Materials -1%, Telecommunication Services&nbsp; 0.3%, Utilities&nbsp; 0.1%.</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) shares were supported on positive broker comments, including from Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley.<strong> </strong>Boeing (BA) was under pressure after disappointing orders data, however did later see some upside after on the news that Qatar was planning to buy “large numbers” of Boeing commercial jets, although when the disappointing details of this transaction were revealed (just five 777S jets) the move was reversed.<strong> </strong>Netflix (NFLX) was buoyant after positive comments from Cowen. Merck (MRK) moved higher up after a judge struck down a Trump administration bill that would force drug makers to include the cost of medications in TV adverts and on further Keytruda progression with the FDA. Macy’s Inc (M) jumped higher on takeover chatter. Hotel names, including Marriot (MAR) and Hilton (HLT), were under pressure after JPM said it was increasingly cautious on US lodging firms. DaVita Inc (DVA) and Fresenius Medical Care (FMS) fell on a Politico report that the Trump administration is planning to encourage more kidney transplants and at-home dialysis. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares moved higher after Instinet raised its PT for the firm to USD 37. Square (SQ) shares jumped higher on an upgrade at Raymond James, who said they see no negative catalysts on the horizon. Notable stocks under pressure after broker downgrades: 3M (MMM) down on RBC Capital downgrade, QEP Resources (QEP) down on Oppenheimer downgrade.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP: USD</strong> has been treading water (slightly up) ahead of the highly anticipated testimony on Wednesday by Fed Chair Powell, which traders are expecting will be pivotal in understanding the trajectory of the Federal Funds Rate target. <strong>EUR</strong> is consolidating around 1.12, though a raft of analyst notes have been calling the currency lower as dovish ECB chatter increases, the prospect of a dovish ECB president, as well as pricing out of a ‘double’ rate cut at the Fed’s July meeting; additionally, some now expect the ECB to ease as early as the July meeting, with some desks looking for a rate cut of 20bps. <strong>GBP</strong> was weaker as the House Speaker did not select an amendment that would put a hurdle in the way of a no-deal Brexit, while BRC data continues to show the challenges the UK economy faces in Q2. <strong>AUD</strong> was lower, partially on a stronger dollar, partially on weaker NAB confidence data, which had the net impact of pushing AUD through its 50dma (around 0.6950) to the downside. <strong>CAD</strong> was weaker ahead of tomorrow’s BOC meeting, after housing data came in on the soft side. <strong>MXN</strong> was hit after news its finance minister has resigned, due to conflicts of interests he has seen in government, and how administration decisions were made without sufficient backing. Mexico President Obrador announced Deputy Finance Minister Herrera as the new Finance Minister. <strong>BRL</strong> maintains a small edge over the buck after pension reform momentum increases.</p><p><strong>* EUR: </strong>USD strength and dovish ECB chatter have placed the 1.12 handle under threat, as traders expect rate cuts/QE2/both in the months ahead. On Monday, Coeure said accommodation was needed “more than ever,” which follows dovish comments last week from hawk Knott, as well as the prospect of a dovish ECB President replacing Draghi. SocGen’s analysts see a rate cut as soon as July, and ask why the volume is suddenly being turned up, if the intention is not to move until September? The bank says that a 20bps cut in the deposit rate, or a statement of an intention to resume bond purchases after the summer are within the realm of possibilities. The bank says it makes it hard not to stay with current tactics and sell the single currency on rallies.</p><p><strong>* BRL: </strong>With pension reform now having passed its first hurdle, clearing a special committee, it has set up a vote in the Lower House before Congress goes into recess on 18th July. Julius Baer’s analysts explain that pension reform is the most important factor in the effort to structurally decrease Brazil’s neutral interest rate, and boost growth, and the BCB has indicated that it needs concrete signs that the pension reform is moving forward before it starts cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy (the market currently prices around 100bps of Selic rate cuts by year-end). The bill will now be sent to the Lower House for two separate votes before moving to the Senate for final approval. The bill is expected to pass through Congress; Globo News recently reported that 318 deputies in the Lower House are in favour of the proposed pension reform, 10 above the minimum required to reach a Congressional majority. Analysts say a successful outcome could push USDBRL down to February levels around 3.63; however, as we have noted already this week, EMFX will take immediate cues from Fed Chair Powell in is testimonies this week.</p><p><strong>* MXN: </strong>Data showed inflationary pressures cooling in June, falling from 4.3% Y/Y to 3.9%, with lower energy prices the driving force. Analysts see further deceleration in the next month’s data, and this could open the door for Banxico rate cuts ahead. In other news, the peso faced downside pressure against the buck on news that the Mexican finance minister was to resign, which sent the MXN back above 19.00; technicians say, however, that if we can strengthen to the near 10-week lows we have visited earlier, a breach of 18.90 could open the door to the April low around 18.7480.</p><p><strong>* CNY: </strong>Desks have noted now that the PBOC has stayed away from open market operations for 12 straight days, citing the abundant liquidity conditions in the banking system. However, the market is still expecting rate cuts, perhaps as soon as this month.</p>",

A 'double' rate cut of 50bps at the July FOMC has been priced out, and the question, analysts say is what is the Fed's conviction of the trajectory of rates through to the end of the year; currently around 2.5 rate hikes are priced in by money markets by the end of 2019; the median Fed 'dot' sees rates unchanged for the rest of the year. Ahead of the Fedspeak, the US Treasury sold 3-year notes at 1.857%, the lowest high yield since November 2017; the sale stopped through the screens by 0.1bps. Cover was soft, the lowest since March 2019. The breakdown, meanwhile, saw indirect participation pare back (48.5% vs 56.6% prior), with direct participation rising to 17.9% from 13.4%, and dealers taking from 30.0% prior.</p>",

        "reaction_updated_at": null,
        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>FX WRAP: USD</strong> has been treading water (slightly up) ahead of the highly anticipated testimony on Wednesday by Fed Chair Powell, which traders are expecting will be pivotal in understanding the trajectory of the Federal Funds Rate target. <strong>EUR</strong> is consolidating around 1.12, though a raft of analyst notes have been calling the currency lower as dovish ECB chatter increases, the prospect of a dovish ECB president, as well as pricing out of a ‘double’ rate cut at the Fed’s July meeting; additionally, some now expect the ECB to ease as early as the July meeting, with some desks looking for a rate cut of 20bps. <strong>GBP</strong> was weaker as the House Speaker did not select an amendment that would put a hurdle in the way of a no-deal Brexit, while BRC data continues to show the challenges the UK economy faces in Q2. <strong>AUD</strong> was lower, partially on a stronger dollar, partially on weaker NAB confidence data, which had the net impact of pushing AUD through its 50dma (around 0.6950) to the downside. <strong>CAD</strong> was weaker ahead of tomorrow’s BOC meeting, after housing data came in on the soft side. <strong>MXN</strong> was hit after news its finance minister has resigned, due to conflicts of interests he has seen in government, and how administration decisions were made without sufficient backing. Mexico President Obrador announced Deputy Finance Minister Herrera as the new Finance Minister. <strong>BRL</strong> maintains a small edge over the buck after pension reform momentum increases.</p><p><strong>* EUR: </strong>USD strength and dovish ECB chatter have placed the 1.12 handle under threat, as traders expect rate cuts/QE2/both in the months ahead. On Monday, Coeure said accommodation was needed “more than ever,” which follows dovish comments last week from hawk Knott, as well as the prospect of a dovish ECB President replacing Draghi. SocGen’s analysts see a rate cut as soon as July, and ask why the volume is suddenly being turned up, if the intention is not to move until September? The bank says that a 20bps cut in the deposit rate, or a statement of an intention to resume bond purchases after the summer are within the realm of possibilities. The bank says it makes it hard not to stay with current tactics and sell the single currency on rallies.</p><p><strong>* BRL: </strong>With pension reform now having passed its first hurdle, clearing a special committee, it has set up a vote in the Lower House before Congress goes into recess on 18th July. Julius Baer’s analysts explain that pension reform is the most important factor in the effort to structurally decrease Brazil’s neutral interest rate, and boost growth, and the BCB has indicated that it needs concrete signs that the pension reform is moving forward before it starts cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy (the market currently prices around 100bps of Selic rate cuts by year-end). The bill will now be sent to the Lower House for two separate votes before moving to the Senate for final approval. The bill is expected to pass through Congress; Globo News recently reported that 318 deputies in the Lower House are in favour of the proposed pension reform, 10 above the minimum required to reach a Congressional majority. Analysts say a successful outcome could push USDBRL down to February levels around 3.63; however, as we have noted already this week, EMFX will take immediate cues from Fed Chair Powell in is testimonies this week.</p><p><strong>* MXN: </strong>Data showed inflationary pressures cooling in June, falling from 4.3% Y/Y to 3.9%, with lower energy prices the driving force. Analysts see further deceleration in the next month’s data, and this could open the door for Banxico rate cuts ahead. In other news, the peso faced downside pressure against the buck on news that the Mexican finance minister was to resign, which sent the MXN back above 19.00; technicians say, however, that if we can strengthen to the near 10-week lows we have visited earlier, a breach of 18.90 could open the door to the April low around 18.7480.</p><p><strong>* CNY: </strong>Desks have noted now that the PBOC has stayed away from open market operations for 12 straight days, citing the abundant liquidity conditions in the banking system. However, the market is still expecting rate cuts, perhaps as soon as this month.</p>",

There was not too much in the way of substantial developments in the oil market on Tuesday, with analysts noting the same narratives of geopolitical risk being price supportive and global growth concerns providing headwinds. However, it was reported that Russia’s oil output fell to 10.79mln BPD in the beginning of July, down from 11.15mln BPD in June; although a promising sign for OPEC+ production cut compliance, it’s unlikely that this much of a cut was voluntary given the production problems in Russia, with a growing divide between the state-owned pipeline monopoly Transneft and the country’s largest producer Rosneft due to the handling of the contaminated oil which has plagued supply out of the region. After the bell the API will report its US energy inventory figures, where analysts look for headline crude stocks to draw by 3.1mln (Cushing expected to draw by 420k); distillates are seen building 0.7mln, and gasoline is seen drawing 1.3mln.</p>",

Analysts at UBS says this implied USD 26bln of new cash (ex SOMA-holdings), split between USD 24bln of redemptions, and USD 2bln of coupon payments. Desks have noted that this week's supply will be the first long-end Treasury supply since the June FOMC; the auctions will also be complicated by Fed chair Powell's dual-testimonies to lawmakers (Wed/Thu), with the market looking for signs of whether the Fed is still mulling a July insurance rate cut, now that markets have priced out the prospect of a 'double’ rate cut, consisting of 50bps. The market is, however, still pricing in a 25bps for the July meeting. The 10-year auction will also be interesting after yields on benchmark 10s recently fell below the 2% handle, though have made its way back above the level in Monday. Analysts at BMO will be watching out for domestic investor fund participation at this cycle's auctions; The bank notes that the funds seem undeterred by the continual bullish re-pricings in USTs as June's 3-, 10- and 30-year auctions, which showed the largest share on record allocated to that type of investor. Recent averages imply the 3-year auction will tail 0.2bps, covered 2.52x; the breakdown is seen as 38.00% to dealers, 16.3% to directs, and 45.7% to indirects.</p><p><strong>RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tail size: prev. -0.6bps, 6-month average 0.2bps</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid-to-cover: prev. 2.62x, 6-month average 2.52x</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dealers: prev. 30.0%, 6-auction average 38.0%</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directs: prev. 13.4%, 6-auction average 16.3%</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indirects: prev. 56.6%, 6-auction average 45.7%</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

There will be attention on whether the Bank chooses to tweak forward guidance and introduce an easing bias; however, most analysts are of the view that the BOC will avoid doing this, and reiterate the current stance remains appropriate. The MPR will likely see near-term growth forecasts upgraded, though will likely revise down its view of global growth; the output gap and inflation estimates could be nudged higher. Rate decision and MPR due for release at 1500 BST/1000 EDT, and the post-meeting press conference with Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins will begin at 1615 BST/1115 EDT.

However, Wednesday could provide the next big fundamental driver for the Greenback as Fed chair Powell delivers the first part of his semi-annual testimony and gets the opportunity to respond to the latest jobs data via further guidance for the upcoming July FOMC and the rest of H2 this year. In the interim, Harker (non-voter) told the WSJ that he personally does not see the need to ease right now.</p><p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p><p>Already the worst major following broadly downbeat business and consumer sentiment surveys overnight, the Aussie has extended losses vs its US and Antipodean peers through 0.6940 (Fib support) to around 0.6920 and sub 1.0500 to 1.0480 at one stage, while the Kiwi clings to 0.6600 against the Buck.</p><p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p><p>The Pound has clawed back some losses from near ytd or flash crash lows vs the Dollar and 0.9000 against the Euro as the threat of a cliff edge or disorderly Brexit continues to weigh on Sterling sentiment, while a motion by Grieve to prevent any suspension of Parliament between September 4 and December 18 that could facilitate no deal at all was rejected by HoC speaker and merely added to the uncertainty. However, Cable has reclaimed 1.2450 status, albeit just and Eur/Gbp is back down from the big figure, as Eur/Usd continues to hover around 1.1200 after the single currency ducked under the psychological level, but held above several chart supports with the aid of hefty bids in front of 1.1190 (some 750 mn touted).</p><p><strong>CAD&nbsp;</strong></p><p>An air of caution has kept the Loonie on the back foot and mostly under 1.3100 against its US rival, ignoring mixed Canadian housing data and oil price fluctuations as attention was trained on Wednesday’s BoC policy meeting where rates are widely seen unchanged, but guidance could be tweaked. Usd/Cad remains elevated within a 1.3088-3139 range even though Canada escaped fresh tariffs on fabricated steel exports to the US.</p><p><strong>JPY</strong></p><p>The Yen got to within a whisker of 109.00 lows vs the Usd and probed support at a Fib retracement level (108.92) before rebounding towards 108.70 peaks, as the safe-haven saw renewed safe-haven demand on strained geopolitical factors (like China’s opposition to US arms sales to Taiwan).</p><p><strong>TRY</strong></p><p>The Lira was licking some wounds after losses made in wake of CBRT intervention by Turkish President Erdogan, but came under renewed pressure amidst reports that the EU is mulling sanctions in the form of pulling EIB aid and possibly shelving talks about aviation before settling down again. Usd/Try currently around 5.7200 between 5.7450-5.6885 trading parameters.</p>",

(-0.2%)</strong> were lacklustre amid continued PBoC liquidity inaction and after less than constructive comments from China’s Vice Foreign Minister who warned of disastrous consequences if the US treats China as an enemy, while Geely Auto underperformed in Hong Kong after June sales volume slipped 29% Y/Y which prompted the automaker to cut its FY sales volume forecast by 10%. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with demand subdued as Japanese stocks remained afloat for most the session and amid mixed results at the 5yr JGB auction.</p><p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(Newswires)</p><p><strong>Japan and South Korea are reportedly planning to discuss exports as early as this week.</strong> However, there were also comments from Japanese Trade Minister Seko that Japan is not thinking of withdrawing export restrictions on South Korea, while he suggested that whether Japan takes additional export restrictions depends on South Korea's response and that restrictions could either be strengthened or eased. (Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p><strong>US is set to impose duties on fabricated structural steel imports from China and Mexico but will not impose duties on structural steel from Canada</strong>. Mexico later said that US countervailing duties on structured steel from Mexico has nothing to do with Section 232 tariffs or President Trump, while <strong>Mexico’s Deputy Foreign Minister said the preliminary subsidy determination announced by the US does not put USMCA ratification in danger</strong> and that tariffs are against private companies not the wider steel industry, but added that tariffs are a new problem and Mexico will have to be very active in supporting its steelmakers.

(Guardian)</p><p><strong>UK opposition Labour Party is set to declare it will campaign for remain in a second referendum on any deal put to parliament by a Tory PM after union bosses agreed to support a change of policy</strong>. However, Labour are not committed to being pro-remain in all scenarios and if the Labour party won a General Election before the UK left the EU then they should seek to deliver a Brexit deal. (The Guardian)</p><p>UK BRC Sales Like-For-Like (Jun) Y/Y -1.6% vs. Exp. -1.1% (Prev. -3.0%); BRC said 12-month average total sales rose 0.6% which was the slowest pace since record began in 1995. (Newswires)</p><p>EQUITIES</p><p><strong>Major European indices are in the red this morning, [Euro Stoxx 50 -0.7%] losses are largely led by the Dax (-1.3%)</strong> as BASF (-6.0%) and Deutsche Bank (-4.5%) weigh on the index due to a profit warning and in continuation from yesterday’s restructuring downside respectively. BASF are firmly in the red after the issuance of a profit warning where notably the Co. now expect Q2 EBIT before special items to print at EUR 1.0bln, which is 47% down on the prior readin; additionally, Co. have lowered their FY outlook and are planning approximately 6k job cuts by the end of 2021. BASF’s downside has led to the Stoxx Chemical sector (-2.1%) underperforming its peers as the Co. hold a 13.4% weighting in the index. Additionally, the likes of Lanxess (-4.0%), Evonik (-3.0%) and Covestro (-6.0%) are suffering in sympathy. Separately, Danske Bank (-4.0%) also issued a profit warning, where the Co. revised their FY19 outlook down and believe that the generally weak momentum is set to continue. At the other end of the Stoxx 600 are Ocado (+5.6%) as the Co. reported H1 revenue of GBP 874mln which is 10.5% above the prior, aiding the FTSE 100 (-0.2%) in outperforming its peers, albeit still in negative territory, with the bourse also receiving some respite from a softer Sterling this morning.</p><p>FX</p><p>AUD - The biggest, but not the only G10 loser by any means as the Usd extends its post-NFP gains across the board and the DXY breaches 97.500 to trade at fresh multi-week highs of 97.588. However, the Aussie has been hit independently by a deterioration in NAB business and ANZ consumer confidence that together overshadowed an uptick in the former’s gauge of conditions. Aud/Usd has fallen through 0.6950 and Aud/Jpy is down through the 200 HMA (75.64), while the Aud/NZD cross is breaking below 1.0500 again or testing bids/support at the psychological level even though the Kiwi is also retreating further vs its US counterpart and only just holding above 0.6600.</p><p>GBP - No deal Brexit risk and the prospect if not distinct probability of more bleak UK data on Wednesday have piled further pressure on the Pound as Cable slides to a fresh 6 month low and through the 1.2481 base posted last Friday. 1.2450 may offer Sterling some reprieve, though in truth there is little in terms of technical levels until 2019 troughs seen in early January around 1.2435-39 ahead of big option barrier defences lying at 1.2400.</p><p>CAD - The Loonie has declined through 1.3100 ahead of Canadian housing data and tomorrow’s BoC policy meeting, with little support derived from firm crude prices or the fact that Canada has been excluded from US tariffs on fabricated structural steel imposed on China and Mexico.</p><p>EUR/JPY - Also weaker vs the Dollar as the single currency dips through 1.1200 and nearer short term support around 1.1180-70, while the Yen retreats closer to 109.00 and tests a major Fib just ahead of the big figure at 108.92 (38.2% retracement of the move from 112.40 to 106.78).</p><p>EM - Broad weakness vs the Buck, but the Lira is outperforming or holding up better than regional peers in wake of its more pronounced declines on Monday due to CBRT personnel changes and investor angst over the loss of independence/credibility. Usd/Try sitting tight within a 5.7450-7230 range in contrast to Usd/Zar up above 14.2300 and Usd/Rub over 63.8800.</p><p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Core bonds have pulled back further amidst big block trades in US Treasury futures and options centred on 10 year notes and all seemingly targeting or hedging for more downside price movement. As a result, the benchmark has probed just below last Friday’s post-NFP low, while Bunds hit 173.10 and Gilts 131.57 before finding their feet. It is still too early to call an end to the overall bull run, but buyers are clearly wary about stepping back up to the plate given the headline BLS beat and prospect that Fed chair Powell may not commit to July easing or cave to growing outside pressure to signal a concerted rate cutting cycle alongside an end to QT. Note also, it is conceivable that a building supply pipeline warrants concession even though demand for issuance appears strong, and especially via syndication.&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent futures have been choppy this morning</strong>, with initial weakness seen in-line with this morning profit warning driven poor stock performance. However, the complex is now in positive territory and towards the top end of the day’s range following industry sources state that <strong>Russia’s July 1st-8th oil output fell by 3%;</strong> which provided a bullish catalyst for oil on an day of relatively light newsflow for the complex thus far. Looking ahead, we have the weekly API release are expectations are for a headline draw of around 2.5mln; in addition, the EIA release their Short Term Energy Outlook which this month contains their Expanded Forecast Discussion at 17:00 BST, with the API and OPEC reports to follow later on in the week.</p><p><strong>Gold (-0.7%)</strong> is subdued as the yellow metal failed to hold onto the USD 1400/oz mark overnight, and is now towards the session low of USD 1388/oz as the dollar continues to strengthen and extend on its post-NFP gains. Separately<strong>, Copper</strong> prices are moving towards their lowest level in around 3 weeks on the risk-averse tone and ahead of the week’s key risk events of Powell’s dual testimony.</p><p>CME raised NatGas Henry Hub August 2019 maintenance margins by 10% USD 1650 from USD 1500 per contract. (Newswires)</p><p>Russian oil output -3% for July 1st-8th vs. June average, falling to 10.79mln BPD vs. Prev. 11.15mln BPD; Rosneft's oil output for the same period is -11%., according to industry sources</p><p>- Oil output from Russia's Rosneft has fallen due to oil production at the Yuganskneftegaz unit being 30% lower during July 1st - 8th vs. June average; additionally, Transneft are to limit oil intake from Rosneft., according to sources</p>",

BASF are firmly in the red after the issuance of a profit warning where notably the Co. now expect Q2 EBIT before special items to print at EUR 1.0bln, which is 47% down on the prior readin; additionally, Co. have lowered their FY outlook and are planning approximately 6k job cuts by the end of 2021. BASF’s downside has led to the Stoxx Chemical sector (-2.1%) underperforming its peers as the Co. hold a 13.4% weighting in the index. Additionally, the likes of Lanxess (-4.0%), Evonik (-3.0%) and Covestro (-6.0%) are suffering in sympathy. Separately, Danske Bank (-4.0%) also issued a profit warning, where the Co. revised their FY19 outlook down and believe that the generally weak momentum is set to continue. At the other end of the Stoxx 600 are Ocado (+5.6%) as the Co. reported H1 revenue of GBP 874mln which is 10.5% above the prior, aiding the FTSE 100 (-0.2%) in outperforming its peers, albeit still in negative territory, with the bourse also receiving some respite from a softer Sterling this morning.</p><p>FX</p><p>AUD - The biggest, but not the only G10 loser by any means as the Usd extends its post-NFP gains across the board and the DXY breaches 97.500 to trade at fresh multi-week highs of 97.588. However, the Aussie has been hit independently by a deterioration in NAB business and ANZ consumer confidence that together overshadowed an uptick in the former’s gauge of conditions. Aud/Usd has fallen through 0.6950 and Aud/Jpy is down through the 200 HMA (75.64), while the Aud/NZD cross is breaking below 1.0500 again or testing bids/support at the psychological level even though the Kiwi is also retreating further vs its US counterpart and only just holding above 0.6600.</p><p>GBP - No deal Brexit risk and the prospect if not distinct probability of more bleak UK data on Wednesday have piled further pressure on the Pound as Cable slides to a fresh 6 month low and through the 1.2481 base posted last Friday. 1.2450 may offer Sterling some reprieve, though in truth there is little in terms of technical levels until 2019 troughs seen in early January around 1.2435-39 ahead of big option barrier defences lying at 1.2400.</p><p>CAD - The Loonie has declined through 1.3100 ahead of Canadian housing data and tomorrow’s BoC policy meeting, with little support derived from firm crude prices or the fact that Canada has been excluded from US tariffs on fabricated structural steel imposed on China and Mexico.</p><p>EUR/JPY - Also weaker vs the Dollar as the single currency dips through 1.1200 and nearer short term support around 1.1180-70, while the Yen retreats closer to 109.00 and tests a major Fib just ahead of the big figure at 108.92 (38.2% retracement of the move from 112.40 to 106.78).</p><p>EM - Broad weakness vs the Buck, but the Lira is outperforming or holding up better than regional peers in wake of its more pronounced declines on Monday due to CBRT personnel changes and investor angst over the loss of independence/credibility. Usd/Try sitting tight within a 5.7450-7230 range in contrast to Usd/Zar up above 14.2300 and Usd/Rub over 63.8800.</p><p>FIXED INCOME</p><p>Core bonds have pulled back further amidst big block trades in US Treasury futures and options centred on 10 year notes and all seemingly targeting or hedging for more downside price movement. As a result, the benchmark has probed just below last Friday’s post-NFP low, while Bunds hit 173.10 and Gilts 131.57 before finding their feet. It is still too early to call an end to the overall bull run, but buyers are clearly wary about stepping back up to the plate given the headline BLS beat and prospect that Fed chair Powell may not commit to July easing or cave to growing outside pressure to signal a concerted rate cutting cycle alongside an end to QT. Note also, it is conceivable that a building supply pipeline warrants concession even though demand for issuance appears strong, and especially via syndication.&nbsp;</p><p>COMMODITIES</p><p><strong>WTI and Brent futures have been choppy this morning</strong>, with initial weakness seen in-line with this morning profit warning driven poor stock performance. However, the complex is now in positive territory and towards the top end of the day’s range following industry sources state that <strong>Russia’s July 1st-8th oil output fell by 3%;</strong> which provided a bullish catalyst for oil on an day of relatively light newsflow for the complex thus far. Looking ahead, we have the weekly API release are expectations are for a headline draw of around 2.5mln; in addition, the EIA release their Short Term Energy Outlook which this month contains their Expanded Forecast Discussion at 17:00 BST, with the API and OPEC reports to follow later on in the week.</p><p><strong>Gold (-0.7%)</strong> is subdued as the yellow metal failed to hold onto the USD 1400/oz mark overnight, and is now towards the session low of USD 1388/oz as the dollar continues to strengthen and extend on its post-NFP gains. Separately<strong>, Copper</strong> prices are moving towards their lowest level in around 3 weeks on the risk-averse tone and ahead of the week’s key risk events of Powell’s dual testimony.</p>",

The US jobs data has changed market perceptions ahead of keynote testimonies from Fed chair Powell and interrupted an almost relentless rally in global bonds on the back of a wave of dovish global Central Bank policy expectations. However, the overall bull trend remains intact amidst ongoing trade and geopolitical risk/uncertainty, so the current bout of consolidation may not last long or manifest as a more meaningful correction. Nevertheless, Bunds just slipped to a marginal new Eurex base at 173.30 from 173.46 at one stage and yesterday’s 173.51 close ahead of a few ECB speakers and Italian retail sales data.</p>",

At settlement the 2s/30s flattened the pronounced by 3.8bps, with the 2-year yield rising just under 1.5bps and the 30-year falling by just under 2.5bps. It is worth noting that markets still expect an insurance cut at the July meeting, where the implied probability of a July cut is around 97% on Monday; desks have been increasingly noting that the Fed has historically rarely disappointed when market expectations have been so aggressive. That is in spite of the economy ticking along nicely. Deutsche Bank's analysts said the strength of the NFP data calls into question whether the Fed should be cutting three times this year at all – the market is currently pricing around 67bps. It is hoped now that Fed Chair Powell will reveal some of the Fed's thinking at his dual testimonies this week (Wed/Thu). US T-note futures (U9) settled 1 tick higher at 127-16.</p><p><strong>US is set to impose duties on fabricated structural steel imports from China and Mexico but will not impose duties on structural steel from Canada</strong>. Mexico later said that US countervailing duties on structured steel from Mexico has nothing to do with Section 232 tariffs or President Trump, while <strong>Mexico’s Deputy Foreign Minister said the preliminary subsidy determination announced by the US does not put USMCA ratification in danger</strong> and that tariffs are against private companies not the wider steel industry, but added that tariffs are a new problem and Mexico will have to be very active in supporting its steelmakers.
