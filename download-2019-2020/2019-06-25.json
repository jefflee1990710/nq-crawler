Pharma names, including Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck &amp; Co (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) were all buoyed by the news. However, AbbVie shares sunk. Lennar Corp (LEN) initially moved higher after reporting strong earnings, bringing other housing sector names such as DR Horton (DHI) and PulteGroup (PHM) higher with it; however, negative conference call comments about the outlook/effect of US/China trade tensions, saw the move reverse, with housing names finishing the session in the red. Microsoft (MSFT) moved lower after Jeffries maintained its underperform rating for the technology giant, and cut its PT citing valuation. McDonalds (MCD) shares were supported after Credit Suisse opted to initiate the co. with a buy rating. Kellogg (K) was under pressure after being downgraded at Consumer Edge. Tiffany &amp; Co. (TIF) shares moved lower on a downgrade at Loop Capital. Cloudera (CLDR) saw some upside after Dealreporter reported that the co. could be subject to some activist interest. Medtronic (MDT) moved higher, supported by reports that the co. is considering issuing a jumbo eurobond in Q4 in order to replace its USD debt, taking advantage of near-record low borrowing costs in euro terms. Mosaic Co. (MOS) moved higher after Cowen raised its price target for the co. GrubHub (GRUB) shares popped higher premarket after Citigroup upgraded the restaurant to a buy. Bausch Health Companies Inc (BHC) gained after the health care co. launched its plaque psoriasis lotion. Shopify (SHOP) shares sunk after Wedbush downgraded the co.’s stock to neutral from outperform. FactSet Research Systems (FDS) saw initial upside after the software maker beat earnings expectations, but sunk in later trade. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) shares rallied ahead of earnings on Thursday, in which the co. is expected to report an increase in quarterly revenue. FedEx (FDX) shares fell after the co. opted to sue the US government, arguing that it should not be held responsible if it accidentally shipped products that violated the recent export ban to some Chinese companies such as Huawei. The move comes ahead of earnings, which it reports after market today (on Tuesday). Tyson Foods (TSN) fell on reports that the US is probing claims that the co. has engaged in poultry price fixing. Wayfair (W) shares plummeted after employees announced a walkout in opposition to furniture sales to migrant detention facilities. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) shares moved after the co. was initiated with an outperform at Credit Suisse. Brighthouse Financials (BHF) shares sunk after the co. was downgraded to neutral at Credit Suisse, who suggested recent drops in interest rates that could reduce distributable earnings. S&amp;P 500 -0.95% at 2917, NASDAQ-100 -1.7% at 7592, Dow Jones -0.67% at 26549.</p><p>Yields were lower by 0-3bps across the curve. Attention in early trade was on the 10-year yield, which once again breached 2% to the downside around the cash equity open, as well as the negative US 2-year swap spread, which saw a negative reaction in stocks too. The data slate helped support the complex, after weaker consumer confidence, new home sales missing, and another weak regional manufacturing survey headline (though the internals were more encouraging, with new orders rising). Later in the session, Fed’s Bullard leaned back in the notion of a 50bps rate cut in July, preferring 25bps; markets interpreted this as less dovish than hoped for, which saw yields rise and the USD catch a bid, while stocks slipped. Powell’s comments were balanced, but the Fed Chair offered little to suggest a 50bps rate cut was coming, instead Powell choosing to adopt a more circumspect approach. The US 2-year auction was solid, stopping through the screens, while cover was above recent averages. There was little of note in the bidder breakdown. The US sells 5-year notes on Wednesday; SocGen’s analysts say some concession will be needed ahead of the auction on an outright basis, since current 5-year WI yields are trading below all stop-out rates since September 2017. The banks says that from a relative value perspective, 5s have not got a clear set-up ahead of the auction, and current 5s trade rich vs off the runs in asset swap, though it is slightly cheap on the curve vs 2s and 10s. SocGen says it is neutral on the auction. US T-note futures (U9) settled 6 ticks higher at 128-04.</p>",

He justified his call for a rate cut last week on inflation expectations, explaining that this is not a factor that could be resolved by improving trade talks; he also cited the yield curve again. <strong>Fed Chair</strong> <strong>Powell</strong> took a circumspect approach in his remarks, repeating that many officials see the case for more accommodation, though do not want to react to single data points, and warned it was [paramount that the FOMC does not overreact. Powell was also upbeat about the economy, noting that baseline outlooks remain favourable against backdrop of heightened uncertainties. However, his comments were characteristically balanced, and on insurance rate cuts, the Fed Chair said it is better to act pre-emptively and not let a downturn gather steam, comments which keep the prospects of looser policy alive. However, Powell did not provide anything specific for the market to suggest a 50bps rate cut was coming, and accordingly, risk assets were on the defensive; particularly since his comments followed (the usually dovish) Bullard, who leaned back on 50bps of cuts, which also followed cautious (in regard to moving too fast) comments from Fed’s Kaplan on Monday (Kaplan also considered slightly dovish).</p><p><strong>* FED “INDEPENDENCE”: </strong>US President Trump continued to up the pressure on the Fed chair Powell; saying he is \"incorrect\" that he is entitled to serving a four-year term that expires in 2022 and stated that he thinks he has the power to remove Powell if he wanted to. He did, however, caveat that he currently has no plans to attempt to remove Powell. Later, a US official, voicing the opinion of the President in a familiar criticism, said that if the Fed took back the rate hike from last fall, the dollar would be less strong and the euro would be less weak.</p><p><strong>* G20: </strong>A Senior US official indicated that the main aim for US/China talks at the G20 summit is for a reopening of trade talks between the two countries, and that there is a possibility that US and China could agree on no new tariffs as a goodwill gesture at the G20 Summit this weekend, although it remains unclear if that will happen. The official said there is a “pretty good chance” for trade talks to restart after the Trump/Xi G20 meeting, although the administration does not expect a broad deal to be made at the meeting (which is largely the market consensus). The official said the US would like to see negotiations return to where they were before talks broke down in May, but the US is not willing to give concessions on trade. Finally, the official added that China's Lui He is still leading the Chinese trade delegation, but new names, including possible trade \"hard-liners\", may also be in the running. Earlier, China Vice Premier Liu held a telephone call with USTR Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Monday at the request of the US, Xinhua reported, laying the foundation for talks between Trump and Xi later this week. The two sides discussed economic and trade issues, and agreed to continue to maintain contact. Meanwhile, markets continue to digest news flow in a cautious manner (both ways), perhaps because the Fed, PBOC and ECB are ready with more liquidity if trade tensions spill over presenting growth risks. No deal is expected this week; instead, a commitment to get talks on track is what the market is looking for.</p><p><strong>* CHINESE PRESS’ COMMENTARY:</strong>&nbsp;Chinese negotiators will be able to take a tougher line with the US, due to China’s economic resilience, though researchers warned not to go too far in retaliatory measures, since the objective was to bring the US back to the negotiating table, SCMP reported, citing researchers at a Chinese think tank. People’s Daily editorial stated that China has the strength and patience to withstand a trade war, and it could fight to the end if the US persists; the article called on US to show good faith, and take into account US concerns, saying that only equal dialogue can lead to a win/win situation.</p><p><strong>* IRAN:</strong> Iran’s Foreign Ministry said overnight that the latest US sanctions on its Supreme Leader and other officials means the “closing of diplomacy forever.” US National Security Advisor Bolton, a noted foreign policy hawk, said shortly afterwards that all Iran has to do is negotiate with the US over the nuclear programme, a comment which Acting Defense Secretary Esper later echoed. A US Ambassador said the US will continue to put maximum pressure on Iran until it changes its behaviour, and will look into what more it can do in terms of sanctions (although a majority of Iran’s exports are already under sanctions). US President Trump later took to twitter, and stated that \"any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.\" In regard to the nuclear deal, Iran said on Tuesday it has no reason left to carry it out, and that it has initiated the second phase of reducing commitments; this comes after France, UK, and Germany that there would be consequences if it did not keep to its commitments.</p><p><strong>* US ISOLATIONISM:</strong>&nbsp;US President Donald Trump has considered withdrawing from a defence treaty with Japan, Bloomberg reported citing sources, as Trump judges the alliance as unfair and too one-sided since it pledges US aid if Japan is ever attacked, but does not require Japan’s military to come to US' defence. Bloomberg noted that Trump has not taken steps towards withdrawing from the treaty, and officials have said such a move is highly unlikely. After Trump’s dovish reaction to Iran downing a drone last week, and then on Monday questioning why the US should be responsible for protecting maritime traffic passing through the Strait of Hormuz, analysts have been taking note of a potentially more isolationist shift from the US President ahead of the 2020 elections.</p><p><strong>* CHINA BANKS:</strong>&nbsp;A US court has found three Chinese banks in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas relating to possible North Korean sanctions violation. Washington Post believes that China’s Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (its ninth largest) is one of these institutions, and is not at risk of being denied access to USD funding, should the US AG decide to do so, which would present perhaps mortal consequences to the bank.</p><p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB's de Guindos said that the overall effect of the bank’s monetary policy (i.e. negative rates) on bank profitability has so far been broadly neutral, but that banks’ profitability prospects could be dampened by deteriorating growth expectations, adding to structural weaknesses.</p><p><strong>* RBNZ PREVIEW: </strong>The RBNZ is expected to keep the Official Cash Rate unchanged at 1.50%. Given the proximity of last month’s cut, it is likely that the central bank will prefer a wait and see approach whilst recent data also suggests a lack of urgency for further policy loosening.

While 1-year consumer inflation rate expectations rose to 5.1% from 4.6% -- in contrast to the Michigan survey, where inflation expectations collapsed -- it could be indicative that tariff fears were driving the data (US and Mexico tensions were heightened over the survey period, but have subsequently eased after the US refrained from applying sanctions on Mexico over immigration). Now that relations between the US/Mexico have de-escalated, some have suggested we could see a bounce back in the surveys for July.</p><p><strong>* US NEW HOME SALES: </strong>Missed expectations, printing 626k vs 684k consensus. Pantheon Macroeconomics said the consensus forecast for an increase in sales always looked too high, given the dip in mortgage applications in February (which tends to lead sales by about three months) but this is a bigger drop than we expected: “Note, though, that the margin of error is huge, +/-92K according to the Census Bureau, and we reckon upward revisions are a decent bet,” Pantheon writes, “Either way, a clear rebound is likely in June, and sales then will remain broadly flat until late summer or early fall, when we expect to see new cycle highs.” The consultancy also adds that the 100bps fall in mortgage rates since November is yet to work through, while consumers’ confidence is high and the labour market remains very tight.</p><p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Leading candidate to replace PM May, Boris Johnson, admitted he would need EU co-operation to avoid a hard Irish border or crippling tariffs on trade in the event of no deal, adding that he did “not believe for a moment” the UK would leave without a deal, although he was willing to do so, BBC reported. Johnson reiterated that the deal Theresa May negotiated with the EU was dead. He said he would be able to persuade Brussels to resolve the Irish border issue, saying there were “abundant, abundant technical fixes” that could be made to avoid border checks.</p><p><strong>* WTI (Q9) SETTLES USD 0.07 LOWER AT USD 57.83; BRENT (Q9) SETTLES USD 0.19 HIGHER AT USD 65.05:</strong> The energy complex traded in a somewhat of a limbo on Tuesday, with the usual suspects of geopolitics and trade concerns providing support and resistance respectively. Iran announcing the “closing of diplomacy forever” and President Trump threatening “obliteration” if the US was attacked was providing justified concerns over supply out of the region. Investors are also tepid ahead of this weekend’s G20 summit, with analysts sceptical on a material breakthrough, with all else remaining could lead to a further deterioration in global growth provided tariffs remain present. It is worth reminding that OPEC+ will be paying close attention to the G20 outcome in how it decides to move forward with production cut extensions, which are widely expected to be rolled over but could be subject to changes in the magnitude of the cuts. The market is also looking ahead to the API’s US energy inventory report after the bell, where crude stocks are seen drawing 2.5mln bbls, distillates building 0.5mln bbls, and gasoline stocks building 0.3mln bbls; Genscape sees Cushing, Oklahoma drawing 165k bbls.</p><p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (U9) SETTLED 6 TICKS HIGHER AT 128-04: </strong>Yields were lower by 0-3bps across the curve. Attention in early trade was on the 10-year yield, which once again breached 2% to the downside around the cash equity open, as well as the negative US 2-year swap spread, which saw a negative reaction in stocks too. The data slate helped support the complex, after weaker consumer confidence, new home sales missing, and another weak regional manufacturing survey headline (though the internals were more encouraging, with new orders rising). Later in the session, Fed’s Bullard leaned back in the notion of a 50bps rate cut in July, preferring 25bps; markets interpreted this as less dovish than hoped for, which saw yields rise and the USD catch a bid, while stocks slipped. Powell’s comments were balanced, but the Fed Chair offered little to suggest a 50bps rate cut was coming, instead Powell choosing to adopt a more circumspect approach. The US 2-year auction was solid, stopping through the screens, while cover was above recent averages. There was little of note in the bidder breakdown. The US sells 5-year notes on Wednesday; SocGen’s analysts say some concession will be needed ahead of the auction on an outright basis, since current 5-year WI yields are trading below all stop-out rates since September 2017. The banks says that from a relative value perspective, 5s have not got a clear set-up ahead of the auction, and current 5s trade rich vs off the runs in asset swap, though it is slightly cheap on the curve vs 2s and 10s. SocGen says it is neutral on the auction.</p><p><strong>* S&amp;P 500 -0.95% at 2917, NASDAQ-100 -1.7% at 7592, Dow Jones -0.67% at 26549, SECTORS:</strong> Consumer discretionary -1.1%, consumer staples -0.1%, energy -0.8%, financials -0.4%, health care -0.4%, industrials -0.7%, IT -1.8%, materials +0.0%, telecoms -1.6%, utilities -0.6%</p><p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Allergan (AGN) shares soared on after news emerged that AbbVie (ABBV) will buy the co. in a deal worth USD 63bln. Pharma names, including Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck &amp; Co (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) were all buoyed by the news. However, AbbVie shares sunk. Lennar Corp (LEN) initially moved higher after reporting strong earnings, bringing other housing sector names such as DR Horton (DHI) and PulteGroup (PHM) higher with it; however, negative conference call comments about the outlook/effect of US/China trade tensions, saw the move reverse, with housing names finishing the session in the red. Microsoft (MSFT) moved lower after Jeffries maintained its underperform rating for the technology giant, and cut its PT citing valuation. McDonalds (MCD) shares were supported after Credit Suisse opted to initiate the co. with a buy rating. Kellogg (K) was under pressure after being downgraded at Consumer Edge. Tiffany &amp; Co. (TIF) shares moved lower on a downgrade at Loop Capital. Cloudera (CLDR) saw some upside after Dealreporter reported that the co. could be subject to some activist interest. Medtronic (MDT) moved higher, supported by reports that the co. is considering issuing a jumbo eurobond in Q4 in order to replace its USD debt, taking advantage of near-record low borrowing costs in euro terms. Mosaic Co. (MOS) moved higher after Cowen raised its price target for the co. GrubHub (GRUB) shares popped higher premarket after Citigroup upgraded the restaurant to a buy. Bausch Health Companies Inc (BHC) gained after the health care co. launched its plaque psoriasis lotion. Shopify (SHOP) shares sunk after Wedbush downgraded the co.’s stock to neutral from outperform. FactSet Research Systems (FDS) saw initial upside after the software maker beat earnings expectations, but sunk in later trade. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) shares rallied ahead of earnings on Thursday, in which the co. is expected to report an increase in quarterly revenue. FedEx (FDX) shares fell after the co. opted to sue the US government, arguing that it should not be held responsible if it accidentally shipped products that violated the recent export ban to some Chinese companies such as Huawei. The move comes ahead of earnings, which it reports after market today (on Tuesday). Tyson Foods (TSN) fell on reports that the US is probing claims that the co. has engaged in poultry price fixing. Wayfair (W) shares plummeted after employees announced a walkout in opposition to furniture sales to migrant detention facilities. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) shares moved after the co. was initiated with an outperform at Credit Suisse. Brighthouse Financials (BHF) shares sunk after the co. was downgraded to neutral at Credit Suisse, who suggested recent drops in interest rates that could reduce distributable earnings.</p><p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong>&nbsp;Fed commentary was not as dovish as traders was expecting, which helped keep the&nbsp;<strong>USD</strong>&nbsp;higher, and the DXY to snap four sessions of losses. An official also suggested President Trump viewed the USD as too strong. Data wise, the Richmond Fed data followed the run of regional Fed surveys soured by escalating US/Mexico tensions in June (tensions which has since subsided), and forward-looking metrics were encouraging. The consumer confidence data saw the headline fall by more than expected, though the inflation gauge was higher.&nbsp;<strong>JPY</strong>&nbsp;strengthened on news Trump mulled withdrawing from a defence treaty with Japan; elsewhere, the stale BOJ meeting minutes, from its previous meeting, showed a few policymakers calling for the central bank to clarify that policy adjustments would be made without hesitation. Most policymakers were supportive of further easing until inflation is at target. The yen is higher against the buck, as is&nbsp;<strong>XAU</strong>, which continues its advance above USD 1,400; analysts citing the mix of geopolitical tensions, a weaker USD, as well as the dovish pivot of major central banks. Technicians look for a monthly close above USD 1,400, which would be a bullish sign. Technically, the breaking of USD 1,433 adds to the prospect of a rally towards the USD 1,500 level, and then a key fib level of USD 1,509 (61.8% of the September 2012 to December 2015 decline). The RBNZ rate decision overnight is expected to see a 50 pips&nbsp;<strong>NZD</strong>&nbsp;price swing, according to break evens; an unchanged decision is expected.&nbsp;<strong>MXN</strong>&nbsp;was flat against the buck after a retail sales beat.&nbsp;<strong>BRL</strong>&nbsp;could not build on the pension reform optimism on Tuesday, while COPOM minutes added little to the debate.&nbsp;<strong>TRY</strong>&nbsp;was up against the buck, with the weekend’s Istanbul election continuing to reverberate, while there is optimism ahead of a meeting between Trump and Erdogan at the G20.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong>&nbsp;The rally from the Sintra low of c.1.1180 to above 1.14 has been rapid, supported by momentum flows after last week’s dovish FOMC. SocGen notes that if momentum continues into the G20 on Friday, the single currency will have reversed three months of losses in just over a week, and will likely post its first monthly rise since December. “That’s impressive. Technically, a melt up to 1.1500-1.1570, this year’s high, cannot be ruled out if Fed chair Powell triggers another round of dollar selling during his speech in NY tonight,” the bank says, “that does not make the move less stretched if we consider a cross section of 5y5y inflation, the basis and EU/US rate differentials. With a steeper EU curve, rising 5y5y inflation and a tighter basis, fair value is currently around one big figure lower nearer 1.13.”</p><p><strong>* HAVENS:&nbsp;</strong>There is no sign of the long carry trade (short JPY, CHF), on the back of heightened geopolitical tensions. Deutsche Bank says that much will depend on the Fed, with further dovish policy likely to take the shine off of carry. DB warns that we should be mindful of the month-end window, a period during which US corporates become more active in hedging activity. The German bank favours selling USDJPY rallies, saying that 107.80 breaks and suspect rallies to 108.00 should remain limited for this continued grind lower, adding “stick with JPY longs.”</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong>&nbsp;China will issue CNY 2bln yuan-denominated bonds in Macau on 4th July, the MoF said. It is to be the first yuan-denominated government bond sale in Macau, which shows central government’s efforts to help diversity Macau’s economy and develop local bond market, and follows similar auctions in Hong Kong, which are used to mop up excess liquidity to support the yuan, analysts have previously said. On the FX front, desks note that the CNY-CNH spread stayed negative yesterday for a second day, which some say is a sign that bearish pressures are contained.</p>",

Attention in early trade was on the 10-year yield, which once again breached 2% to the downside around the cash equity open, as well as the negative US 2-year swap spread, which saw a negative reaction in stocks too. The data slate helped support the complex, after weaker consumer confidence, new home sales missing, and another weak regional manufacturing survey headline (though the internals were more encouraging, with new orders rising). Later in the session, Fed’s Bullard leaned back in the notion of a 50bps rate cut in July, preferring 25bps; markets interpreted this as less dovish than hoped for, which saw yields rise and the USD catch a bid, while stocks slipped. Powell’s comments were balanced, but the Fed Chair offered little to suggest a 50bps rate cut was coming, instead Powell choosing to adopt a more circumspect approach. The implied probability of a 50bps rate cut in July has fallen to around 35% from around 42% on Monday. The US 2-year auction was solid, stopping through the screens, while cover was above recent averages. There was little of note in the bidder breakdown. The US sells 5-year notes on Wednesday; SocGen’s analysts say some concession will be needed ahead of the auction on an outright basis, since current 5-year WI yields are trading below all stop-out rates since September 2017. The banks ays that from a relative value perspective, 5s have not got clear set-up ahead of the auction, and current 5s trade rich vs off the runs in asset swap, though it is slightly cheap on the curve vs 2s and 10s. SocGen says it is neutral on the auction.</p>",

        "analysis_details": "<p><strong>* FX WRAP:</strong> Fed commentary was not as dovish as traders was expecting, which helped keep the <strong>USD</strong> higher, and the DXY to snap four sessions of losses. An official also suggested President Trump viewed the USD as too strong. Data wise, the Richmond Fed data followed the run of regional Fed surveys soured by escalating US/Mexico tensions in June (tensions which has since subsided), and forward-looking metrics were encouraging. The consumer confidence data saw the headline fall by more than expected, though the inflation gauge was higher. <strong>JPY</strong> strengthened on news Trump mulled withdrawing from a defence treaty with Japan; elsewhere, the stale BOJ meeting minutes, from its previous meeting, showed a few policymakers calling for the central bank to clarify that policy adjustments would be made without hesitation. Most policymakers were supportive of further easing until inflation is at target. The yen is higher against the buck, as is <strong>XAU</strong>, which continues its advance above USD 1,400; analysts citing the mix of geopolitical tensions, a weaker USD, as well as the dovish pivot of major central banks. Technicians look for a monthly close above USD 1,400, which would be a bullish sign. Technically, the breaking of USD 1,433 adds to the prospect of a rally towards the USD 1,500 level, and then a key fib level of USD 1,509 (61.8% of the September 2012 to December 2015 decline). The RBNZ rate decision overnight is expected to see a 50 pips <strong>NZD</strong> price swing, according to break evens; an unchanged decision is expected. <strong>MXN</strong> was flat against the buck after a retail sales beat. <strong>BRL</strong> could not build on the pension reform optimism on Tuesday, while COPOM minutes added little to the debate. <strong>TRY</strong> was up against the buck, with the weekend’s Istanbul election continuing to reverberate, while there is optimism ahead of a meeting between Trump and Erdogan at the G20.</p><p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The rally from the Sintra low of c.1.1180 to above 1.14 has been rapid, supported by momentum flows after last week’s dovish FOMC. SocGen notes that if momentum continues into the G20 on Friday, the single currency will have reversed three months of losses in just over a week, and will likely post its first monthly rise since December. “That’s impressive. Technically, a melt up to 1.1500-1.1570, this year’s high, cannot be ruled out if Fed chair Powell triggers another round of dollar selling during his speech in NY tonight,” the bank says, “that does not make the move less stretched if we consider a cross section of 5y5y inflation, the basis and EU/US rate differentials. With a steeper EU curve, rising 5y5y inflation and a tighter basis, fair value is currently around one big figure lower nearer 1.13.”</p><p><strong>* HAVENS: </strong>There is no sign of the long carry trade (short JPY, CHF), on the back of heightened geopolitical tensions. Deutsche Bank says that much will depend on the Fed, with further dovish policy likely to take the shine off of carry. DB warns that we should be mindful of the month-end window, a period during which US corporates become more active in hedging activity. The German bank favours selling USDJPY rallies, saying that 107.80 breaks and suspect rallies to 108.00 should remain limited for this continued grind lower, adding “stick with JPY longs.”</p><p><strong>* CNY:</strong> China will issue CNY 2bln yuan-denominated bonds in Macau on 4th July, the MoF said. It is to be the first yuan-denominated government bond sale in Macau, which shows central government’s efforts to help diversity Macau’s economy and develop local bond market, and follows similar auctions in Hong Kong, which are used to mop up excess liquidity to support the yuan, analysts have previously said. On the FX front, desks note that the CNY-CNH spread stayed negative yesterday for a second day, which some say is a sign that bearish pressures are contained.</p>",

Iran announcing the “closing of diplomacy forever” and President Trump threatening “obliteration” if the US was attacked was providing justified concerns over supply out of the region. Investors are also tepid ahead of this weekend’s G20 summit, with analysts sceptical on a material breakthrough, with all else remaining could lead to a further deterioration in global growth provided tariffs remain present. It is worth reminding that OPEC+ will be paying close attention to the G20 outcome in how it decides to move forward with production cut extensions, which are widely expected to be rolled over but could be subject to changes in the magnitude of the cuts. The market is also looking ahead to the API’s US energy inventory report after the bell, where crude stocks are seen drawing 2.5mln bbls, distillates building 0.5mln bbls, and gasoline stocks building 0.3mln bbls; Genscape sees Cushing, Oklahoma drawing 165k bbls.</p>",

USD 72bln matures at the monthend settlement, implying USD 59bln of net cash will be raised, TD Securities says. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>* 2-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>From a relative value perspective, the current 2-year note is lacking set up ahead of Tuesday’s auction, and trades rich on asset swap versus older 2s. “The auction is expected to benefit from dovish June FOMC meeting,” SocGen says, “similarly, our view for a modest steepening of the 2s10s curve led by the front-end should also support demand for the auction.” However, SocGen warns that dealer holdings in the 2-3-year sector has risen to a record high, which might limit demand from dealers, and will need support from investment funds and foreign participants in order to perform well. Last month’s auction was well received against the backdrop of global trade wars, and the demand from the foreign and investment bid was solid. SocGen is positive on the 2s auction.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/ckeditor_wave/ck_images/03d9f673-edf6-4836-88f7-64c4e8a69e62.jpg\"></figure>",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p><p>The index remains tethered to the 96.000 pivot awaiting a more decisive break and/or major move elsewhere to either extend post-FOMC losses or mount a meaningful rebound. For now, dips below the round number have held above 96.820-740 support even though the 200 WMA (95.964) has technically been breached, while bounces have not penetrated or really threated chart resistance ahead of 96.500 or early month/pre-Fed peaks. However, Wednesday could be the next watershed for the Dollar with supposedly strong selling for portfolio rebalancing likely to start in earnest 2 days ahead of the final trading day of June, Q2 and H1. More immediately, any reaffirmation of dovish guidance from Powell, Bostic and/or Barkin may impact as trade and geopolitical factors continue to weigh on sentiment.</p><p><strong>G10</strong></p><p>Not much, if any deviation in Usd/major pairings as the clock ticks down to the G20 and risk-off positioning remains prevalent, albeit selective and not exactly rife. Indeed, while the Yen climbs back above 107.00 it is still lagging a bit behind the high beta and more sensitive to mood swings Kiwi that heads in to the RNBZ close to 0.6650 and ‘comfortably’ over 1.0500 against its Aussie counterpart. To recap, the Nzd derived some support from better than forecast NZ trade data overnight, while benchmark rates are widely seen on hold – see our headline feed or research suite for a more detailed preview. Elsewhere, Aud/Usd remains confined between 0.6955-75, but the Loonie got a brief boost from much stronger than expected Canadian wholesale trade to test recent highs and reported bids around 1.3150 before returning to the middle of a 1.3152-96 band. The Franc was subject to suspicions of SNB action and safe-haven unwinding, as Usd/Chf bounced from just under 0.9700 and Eur/Chf pared some losses below 1.1100, but the cross remained toppy as the single currency failed to reclaim 1.1400 vs the Greenback. However, Sterling looks all set to end the EU session as the major loser/laggard with Cable fading ahead of 1.2800 and revisiting support not far off the big figure below, such as a Fib and short term chart levels, while Eur/Gbp bounced towards the upper end of a 0.8953-17 range after the failure to sustain early technical and stop-driven gains vs the Buck.</p><p><strong>EM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Lira stands out as a relative outperformer for a change, and spill-over Istanbul election relief appears to be a factor alongside an impending one-to-one meeting between Turkish President Erdogan and his US counterpart that might diffuse some of the S-400 vs F-35 heat. Usd/Try is hovering nearer the base of 5.8300-7590 parameters vs Usd/Mxn and Usd/Brl both circa 0.2% higher despite above consensus Mexican retail sales and latest positive sounding reports about the progress of Brazil’s Pension Reform Bill.</p>",

Most members shared view that medium to long-term inflation expectations were likely to gradually converge to 2%, although one member said the BoJ should flexibly and decisively conduct additional easing if inflation momentum was lost, while another member said it was necessary to strengthen monetary easing at this point to achieve the price target as soon as possible.&nbsp; (Newswires)</p><p>US</p><p><strong>US President Trump said Fed Chair Powell is \"incorrect\" that he is entitled to serving a four-year term</strong> that expires in 2022 and stated that he thinks he has the power to remove Powell if he wanted to but has no plans to do anything.

        "content": "<p>Marginal new intraday lows for Gilts at 130.50 (-13 ticks vs +18 ticks earlier) as investors shied away from long-dated DMO issuance at depressed and seemingly less attractive yields given the sparse subscription and lengthy tail at the 2049 sale. Indeed, the UK offering was arguably weaker than Germany’s Schatz that saw a relatively large retention and was technically uncovered, although that is not uncommon of course. Hence, 2 year futures are holding around parity, albeit just, while Bunds have not quite revisited their previous Eurex session base. Elsewhere, US Treasuries have been dragged down from overnight peaks alongside EU counterparts and the curve is now essentially steady vs considerably flatter at one stage amidst spurious talk that the US and China may call a trade truce, though this could be alluding to the recent WTO suspension of appeals until December 31. Note also, some consolidation likely ahead of a packed pm agenda, including data, a raft of Fed speakers and prominently chair Powell plus the 1st of this week’s supply remit.</p>",

The Kiwi has received a timely boost just ahead of Wednesday’s RBNZ policy meet in the form of NZ trade revealing moderately better than expected m/m and y/y balances, with Nzd/Usd extending gains above 0.6600 to just over 0.6650 at one stage, while the <strong>AUD/</strong>Nzd cross has retreated through 1.0500 as the Aussie continues to meet resistance/offers recent highs and the psychological 0.7000 mark. Meanwhile, the Yen rallied through 107.00 on heightened risk-aversion sparked by US sanctions against Iran and Tehran’s response that the move means no return to lines of diplomatic communication before losing some steam and retreating back below the big figure towards decent option expiries at 107.25 (1 bn). Elsewhere, the Pound finally breached a key Fib at 1.2768 and Cable advanced to 1.2780+ after stops around 1.2770 were tripped, while Eur/Gbp pulled back from just above 0.8950 to sub-0.8920 as the single currency stalled across the board rather than anything more fundamentally supportive for Sterling.</p><p><strong>EUR/CHF</strong></p><p>As noted above, the Euro has faded after making more headway against the Dollar and forging above 1.1400, with several weekly chart levels spanning 1.1416-85 capping the rally on top of a Fib at 1.1460. However, the Franc has reversed even further from best levels circa 1.1060 and 0.9695 vs the Buck amidst vague market talk or speculation about official intervention to curb demand for one of the other traditional safe-havens. On that note, <strong>GOLD </strong>has seen more upside having breached Usd1400/oz and spiked to fresh multi-year highs only a few cents shy of Usd1440.</p><p><strong>NOK/SEK</strong></p><p>Marked divergence between the Scandi Crowns as Eur/Nok remains in bear retracement mode after last week’s hawkish Norges Bank hike and underpinned within 9.6910-6645 parameters, but Eur/Sek continues to retreat on a more technical and pre-emptive basis through 10.5500, as the Riksbank maintains its tightening bias in wake of firmer Swedish inflation data and not really fazed by a slowdown in PPI that is largely oil-related. Back to the charts, 200 DMA support may cushion the Nok from further losses as the line comes in at 9.949.</p>",

The ensuing rebound has petered out at 130.81, +18 ticks, while the fresh Eurex peak is 172.86, +39 ticks and only 2 ticks shy of the June 18 contract high.

Most members shared view that medium to long-term inflation expectations were likely to gradually converge to 2%, although one member said the BoJ should flexibly and decisively conduct additional easing if inflation momentum was lost, while another member said it was necessary to strengthen monetary easing at this point to achieve the price target as soon as possible.&nbsp; (Newswires)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>UK/EU</p><p><strong>UK PM candidate Boris Johnson said he will ensure a plan to deliver Brexit by end of October and pledged to leave EU on Oct. 31st.</strong> Johnson stated that the UK needs to prepare for Brexit under WTO rules even though he does not believe we will end up there, while he also thinks he can get a no-deal Brexit through parliament and that there should be creative ambiguity over how and when the EU divorce bill gets paid.

Participants are likely to be cautious on the loading up of risk ahead of the G-20 summit and the geopolitical noise in the background. Analysts note the rally was assisted by thin volume, in addition to a chunky 28k+ TYU9 block purchase by a hedge fund as the European session came to a close, which was accompanied by a 4k+ block sale of ultra longs seeing the curve steepen. At settlement, the belly of the curve saw the most action (5-year yield down by c. 5.5bps); spreads were mixed, with the 2s/5s flattening by over 1bps, whilst the 5s/10s steepened by c. 0.5bps.

Kaplan also commented that current interest rates are in the neighbourhood of neutral and that it is too early to judge whether trade and global growth uncertainties will hurt the US, while he added that downside risks to the US economy have increased.

ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are mixed with Australia kept afloat by strength in the miners amid continued gains across the metals complex, while sentiment in Tokyo is subdued by a stronger currency. Hang Seng (-0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) underperform overnight after the PBoC continued to refrain from liquidity operations and due to ongoing trade uncertainty heading into the G20, while a US senior administration official stated that the Trump-Xi meeting will likely occur on the 2nd day of G20 but added that it still needs to be confirmed and President Trump is happy with any outcome.</p><p>In FX markets, the DXY continues its recent downtrend and has slipped below the 96.00 level amid mounting Fed rate cut bets which has benefitted its major counterparts with EUR/USD now trading at the 1.1400 handle, while GBP/USD is also supported and has returned near the 1.2750 level but with further upside restricted by nearby resistance levels and amid ongoing political uncertainty. There were also comments from leading PM candidate Boris Johnson who suggested the need to prepare for Brexit under WTO rules and that there should be creative ambiguity regarding payment of the EU divorce bill, while he also thinks that he can get a no-deal Brexit through parliament. Elsewhere, the predominantly risk-averse tone has spurred mild flows into safe-haven JPY and antipodeans also took advantage of the USD-woes in early trade with NZD/USD the outperformer after better than expected trade data, although this eventually dragged AUD/NZD below 1.0500 and forced AUD/USD to give back its gains.</p><p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are slightly higher with prices partially benefitting from the cautious sentiment and recent gains in T-notes, although upside is limited ahead as focus turns to the 20yr JGB auction later.</p>",
