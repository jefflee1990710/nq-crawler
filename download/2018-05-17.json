In later trade, US President Trump said he doubts trade talks will be successful with China, which provided bears with a catalyst to drive the emini to lows around 2710, but those knee-jerk losses were pared back, and the Emini once again consolidated around 2720. In stock specifics, Thursday&rsquo;s trade saw the unofficial end of earnings season as Wal-Mart (WMT) reported its numbers which slightly beat estimates, however, the retail giant did close lower and was one of the big underperformers in the DJI; Cisco (CSCO) also reported earnings which were relatively in line with estimates, but its operating income was lower. In the pre-market, Alphabet&rsquo;s (GOOGL) YouTube announced it is to start a music subscription service which put pressure on Spotify Tech, (SPOT) and Pandora (P). Energy names outperformed on Thursday, as Morgan Stanley raised its US refining and marketing industry forecast, which saw the SPX leaders dominated by energy names, (MRO, ANDV &amp; VLO). SPX -0.08% at 2720, NDX -0.4% at 6901, DJI -0.22% at 24715.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury curve steepened marginally, despite slightly softer volumes when compared to mid-week trade, and the ranges weren&rsquo;t exactly wide on Thursday. Yields continued to rise to fresh highs along the cruve, except for in the 2yr sector, where they were slightly lower. Most of the action concentrated in the long-end of the curve, where 10yr yields were higher by c.1bps and 30yr by c.3bps at settlement. 2s30s widened by c.5bps, 2s10s and 5s30s by c.3bps. Today&rsquo;s USD 11bln in 10yr TIPS auction tailed by 1bps, bid-to-cover came in at 2.42x in line with the 6-auction average though dealer participation was well above average. The Treasury announced next week&rsquo;s supply of USD 48bln in 3-month bills, USD 42bln in 6-month bills and USD 26bln 52-week bills next. It will also auction USD 16bln in a 2-year FRN reopening, USD 30bln in 7-year notes, USD 36bln in 5-year notes and USD 33bln in 2-year notes. Of note, the Treasury finally introduced a two-month bill. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled one tick lower at 118-16+.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 17 May 2018: Trump wary on China, NAFTA soft deadline saw no deal, Banxico unchanged, yields remain at recent highs",
        "content": "<p>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities down, Treasuries mostly lower, DXY flat, Crude flat.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Trump tough talk on trade, NAFTA; Banxico on hold; lots of central bank speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* AHEAD: Japan CPI overnight; Canada CPI and retail sales on Friday; Fedpseak on Friday (voter Mester, voter Brainard, non-voter Kaplan again), S&amp;P on Netherlands and S&amp;P on Switzerland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*NAFTA: The three members failed to make a deal by the soft deadline imposed by Paul Ryan last week. Mexican Foreign Minister Videgaray said NAFTA talks are continuing and a deal will be reached when conditions are right, emphasising that there is no &lsquo;final deadline&rsquo;. On the flip side, Canada&rsquo;s PM Trudeau declined to comment on whether a NAFTA deal can be sealed this year, arguing that current auto proposals are broadly acceptable to industries in the three nations. Canada&rsquo;s Finance Minister Morneau was more optimistic: although he conceded that a sunset clause is not practical, though he said he was confident of reaching a deal. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* TRADE: US President Trump said be doubted that the trade talks with China will be successful, emphasizing that China will not be ripping the US anymore. Separately, he reportedly told Germany&#39;s Merkel to replace American gas and drop support for a major gas deal with Russia and defined the US- NATO relationship is very good. Elsewhere, US Trade Advisor Navarro was said to not be attending the China trade talks. This confirmed yesterday&rsquo;s reports, which also suggested he will be one of the principles. Note Navarro is a notorious China hawk, having been critical on China in the past and this came.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*GEOPOLITICAL: At first, US President Trump appeared sanguine about the possibility of not meeting North Korea&rsquo;s Kim for talks, but in other comments, threatened the nation, saying that he will decimate North Korea like Libya if Kim Jong Un does not make a deal. Separately, the White House is proceeding with preparations for a summit with Kim, adding nothing has changed on its end. The White House also toed the Pentagon&rsquo;s line that there is no discussion of scaling back US-South Korea military exercises. Separately, US President Trump said the US-NATO relationship is very good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*MEXICO CENTRAL BANK: Banxico kept interest rates unchanged at 7.50%, as expected &ndash; a unanimous decision &ndash;as inflation continues to cool. The central bank noted risks to inflation are to the upside, while risks to growth are to the downside. Analysts expect Banxico to move in step with the FOMC after the June meeting, where the Fed is expected to raise rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FED SPEAK: Fed&rsquo;s Kashkari (Non-Voter, Dove) said low wage growth is a big conundrum, and suggested that one theory why this may be the case is that there is more slack in the labour market. Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan (Non-Voter, Neutral) stated he does not see the US economy entering a recession, with growth likely to stand between 2.5% and 2.75%. He also said the US economy is either at or past full employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*ECB SPEAK: ECB&#39;s Constancio (Dovish) In an event marking his departure as ECB vice chair, Constancio said the ECB has to monitor bond yields in Italy, adding the ECB is also concerned with FX volatility. He warned there must be acceptance the ECB has no excuses not to intervene in the sovereign bond market to deal with acute liquidity stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*DATA: The US Leading Index rose to 0.4% in April, sending positive signals for growth which may likely to persist in Q2, analysts says. The interest rate spread remains a key component in the index, even though the yield curve has flattened recently, Wells Fargo&rsquo;s analysts note. The only negative components for this reading were stock prices and housing permits. Wells remains positive on growth despite the moderation in the index seen in the last six months. US Initial Jobless Claims ticked higher last week, to 222k from 211k and modestly above the 215k consensus. Analysts at Pantheon noted this reading may come as a correction following the previous three-weeks figures which remained in the 209k-211k bracket. The US labour market remains in close proximity to the full-employment level and the latest data seems to indicate that wage growth will pick up in H218, Pantheon said. The Philly Fed beat the consensus at 21 and moved higher to 34.4 in May from 23.2 in April. This month&rsquo;s print was the highest since May 2017, mostly supported by new orders, which were highest since March 1973, and partially by a rise in shipments and employment. Pantheon notes the rise in new orders is unlikely to be a sustained one, though this month&rsquo;s encouraging results open some hope for a rebound in the ISM Index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.08% at 2720, NDX -0.4% at 6901, DJI -0.22% at 24715.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS:&nbsp;Cons Cyclicals: -0.33%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.03%, Energy: +1.43%, Financials: -0.30%, Health Care: -0.10%, Industrials: +0.29%, Materials: +0.17%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures were rangebound after Wednesday&rsquo;s close, however, at the US cash open, ES caught a bid and extended towards the key 2732.50 resistance before paring back the gains and sliding to lows as the session progressed. In later trade, US President Trump said he doubts trade talks will be successful with China, which provided bears with a catalyst to drive the emini to lows around 2710, but those knee-jerk losses were pared back, and the Emini once again consolidated around 2720.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stock specifics, Thursday&rsquo;s trade saw the unofficial end of earnings season as Wal-Mart (WMT) reported its numbers which slightly beat estimates, however, the retail giant did close lower and was one of the big underperformers in the DJI; Cisco (CSCO) also reported earnings which were relatively in line with estimates, but its operating income was lower. In the pre-market, Alphabet&rsquo;s (GOOGL) YouTube announced it is to start a music subscription service which put pressure on Spotify Tech, (SPOT) and Pandora (P).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sectors, energy names outperformed on Thursday, as Morgan Stanley raised its US refining and marketing industry forecast, which saw the SPX leaders dominated by energy names, (MRO, ANDV &amp; VLO).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest on CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) saw CBS lose its first attempt to dilute Shari Redstone&rsquo;s voting power in order to scupper a merger between the two names, with a Delaware Judge ruled against it. CBS followed with a statement saying it remains fully committed to protecting shareholder interests, and mentioned the ruling allows further legal challenges if they deem National Amusements actions as unlawful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*CRUDE: WTI Crude futures settle unchanged at $71.49/bbl; Brent crude futures settle higher by 2 cents at $79.30/bbl. It was a choppy session for crude, but futures are consolidating around recent levels, ultimately little changed on the day, influenced by action in the USD, and pre-settlement, seemingly falling in sympathy with equities on a headline that Trump doubts that trade talks with China will be successful. Elsewhere, in a joint statement, Saudi Arabia and UAE oil ministers said they are both concerned about recent market volatility, but they both see ample supply of oil, and agreed that oil prices are being driven by geopolitical tensions &ndash; comments that were in line with the sources stories earlier in the week. The UEA energy minister himself suggested that there are bigger issues to be concerned about than the Iran nuclear deal, pointing to declining production in Venezuela as an example. Separately, JODI reported that Saudi crude exports declined to 7.1mln BPD in March. In Africa, Shipments of Nigerian Bonny Light crude oil were seeing loading delays, according to sources; later in the day, it was reported that Nigeria cut the premium for Bonny and Qua Iboe crude to $0.69 and $0.70/bbl respectively. And finally, there has been a lot of analyst chatter on crude today, with the folks at Goldman Sachs said that the current fundamental backdrop for oil is more bullish than they had expected, adding that by Q1 2019, markets are likely to remain in deficit, and inventories would draw to critical operating levels if actions are not taken by OPEC and Russia. The folks at Barclays raised their Brent oil price assumption to $73/bbl in 2018 and $70/bbl in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*TREASURIES: US 10yr T-Notes futures settled one tick lower at 118-16+. The Treasury curve steepened marginally, despite slightly softer volumes when compared to mid-week trade, and the ranges weren&rsquo;t exactly wide on Thursday. Yields continued to rise to fresh highs along the cruve, except for in the 2yr sector, where they were slightly lower. Most of the action concentrated in the long-end of the curve, where 10yr yields were higher by c.1bps and 30yr by c.3bps at settlement. 2s30s widened by c.5bps, 2s10s and 5s30s by c.3bps. Today&rsquo;s USD 11bln in 10yr TIPS auction tailed by 1bps, bid-to-cover came in at 2.42x in line with the 6-auction average though dealer participation was well above average. The Treasury announced next week&rsquo;s supply of USD 48bln in 3-month bills, USD 42bln in 6-month bills and USD 26bln 52-week bills next. It will also auction USD 16bln in a 2-year FRN reopening, USD 30bln in 7-year notes, USD 36bln in 5-year notes and USD 33bln in 2-year notes. Of note, the Treasury finally introduced a two-month bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FOREX: DXY: A minor topside range extension for the Dollar index, largely due to ongoing weakness or retracements in G10 currency rivals. The DXY nudged back up above 93.550, but remained hampered by niggling trade, tariff and protectionism concerns, although the Greenback displayed more resilience and resolve in the face of the latest bout of EM intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR, GBP: The single currency and Sterling have both been volatile amidst breaking headlines on events in Rome and Brexit, with EURUSD straddling 1.1800 and Cable trading just above 1.3500, while EURGBP held mostly below 0.8750. In short, Italy&rsquo;s 5-Star and League parties are still working out some coalition issues and are yet to decide on the PM and other prominent Government positions, while the UK appears to be considering a customs union back-stop even if media speculation about staying in the current EU framework beyond 2021 is not an option.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY: An underperformer all day, as USDJPY picked its way through export and option supply at 110.50 then corporate offers said to be sitting at 110.60, 110.70 and at least some at 110.80. The next layer lies in wait at 110.90, but chart resistance at the 110.85 Fib has capped the headline pair, thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD, AUD: The Kiwi has also lagged major counterparts and its antipodean peer, with NZDUSD unable to sustain 0.6900+ levels even though the latest NZ budget was fundamentally supportive, as AUDNZD climbed above 1.0900 and AUDUSD maintained 0.7500+ status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD, CHF: The Loonie failed to derive much fuel from the latest crude price rally as time runs out for a NAFTA deal by COB and latest Mexican comments suggest more chance of an agreement by the end of May &ndash; USDCAD just below 1.2800 from around 1.2750, also shrugging a decent Canadian ADP survey on the basis that official jobs data came out last week, USDMXN around 19.7000. Meanwhile, USDCHF rebounded from sub-par territory to probe 1.0030 peaks.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, in a joint statement, Saudi Arabia and UAE oil ministers said they are both concerned about recent market volatility, but they both see ample supply of oil, and agreed that oil prices are being driven by geopolitical tensions &ndash; comments that were in line with the sources stories earlier in the week. The UEA energy minister himself suggested that there are bigger issues to be concerned about than the Iran nuclear deal, pointing to declining production in Venezuela as an example. Separately, JODI reported that Saudi crude exports declined to 7.1mln BPD in March. In Africa, Shipments of Nigerian Bonny Light crude oil were seeing loading delays, according to sources; later in the day, it was reported that Nigeria cut the premium for Bonny and Qua Iboe crude to $0.69 and $0.70/bbl respectively. And finally, there has been a lot of analyst chatter on crude today, with the folks at Goldman Sachs said that the current fundamental backdrop for oil is more bullish than they had expected, adding that by Q1 2019, markets are likely to remain in deficit, and inventories would draw to critical operating levels if actions are not taken by OPEC and Russia. The folks at Barclays raised their Brent oil price assumption to $73/bbl in 2018 and $70/bbl in 2019.</p>\r\n",

Losses have been exacerbated by inadequate liquidity conditions.</li>\r\n  <li>&ldquo;We do not think there should be any expectation that Banxico would respond to current market volatility with an interest rate hike. As a result, an on-hold decision should be MXN neutral,&rdquo; TD says, &ldquo;we would be concerned if Banxico were to respond with a hike given that it is highly unjustified at the current juncture. A hike may send the wrong signal to markets, thus reducing policy flexibility in the future.&rdquo;</li>\r\n  <li>TD believes that Banxico should continue to sound hawkish. &ldquo;Policymakers may even voice increased concerns about the potential inflationary impact of current exchange rate volatility as it relates to elevated inflation expectations and pass- through.&rdquo; However, TD notes that volatility has already impacted rates pricing by moving the TIIE curve higher. &ldquo;Accordingly, it is unlikely that Banxico rhetoric would significantly change pricing even if policy makers acknowledge that another rate hike may be necessary at some point.&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A minor topside range extension for the Dollar index, largely due to ongoing weakness or retracements in G10 currency rivals. The DXY nudged back up above 93.550, but remained hampered by niggling trade, tariff and protectionism concerns, although the Greenback displayed more resilience and resolve in the face of the latest bout of EM intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency and Sterling have both been volatile amidst breaking headlines on events in Rome and Brexit, with Eur/Usd straddling 1.1800 and Cable trading either side of 1.3500, while Eur/Gbp held mostly below 0.8750. In short, Italy&rsquo;s 5-Star and League parties are still working out some coalition issues and are yet to decide on the PM and other prominent Government positions, while the UK appears to be considering a customs union back-stop even if media speculation about staying in the current EU framework beyond 2021 is not an option. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An underperformer all day, as Usd/Jpy picked its way through export and option supply at 110.50 then corporate offers said to be sitting at 110.60, 110.70 and at least some at 110.80. The next layer lies in wait at 110.90, but chart resistance at the 110.85 Fib has capped the headline pair, thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi has also lagged major counterparts and its antipodean peer, with Nzd/Usd unable to sustain 0.6900+ levels even though the latest NZ budget was fundamentally supportive, as Aud/Nzd climbed above 1.0900 and Aud/Usd maintained 0.7500+ status. The Aud gleaned more (in the end) from overnight labour data, but did get close to hefty option expiries at 0.7500 ahead of the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie failed to derive much fuel from the latest crude price rally as time runs out for a NAFTA deal by COB and latest Mexican comments suggest more chance of an agreement by the end of May &ndash; Usd/Cad up to 1.2800 from around 1.2750, also shrugging a decent Canadian ADP survey on the basis that official jobs data came out last week, Usd/Mxn around 19.7000. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf rebounded from sub-par territory to probe 1.0030 peaks.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>&#39;While the eventual outcome of the litigation between CBS and controlling parent National Amusement (NAI) remains unclear, it might be uncharacteristic of the court to permit the CBS board to dilute NAI&rsquo;s controlling stake (just for the purpose of preventing a Viacom merger) &ndash; the precedence for which certainly is not obvious to us. We, however, will not be surprised to see the court try and ring fence CBS&rsquo; board from NAI&rsquo;s direct involvement in strategic decision making, which lowers the probability of a CBS-Viacom merger (although not to zero, given the two companies&rsquo; boards had seemingly agreed upon the economics of a merger and any disagreement seems to have been focused on the leadership of the combined company, which can still likely be resolved). We think the decision on the stock dividend at tomorrow&rsquo;s CBS board meeting still faces a high hurdle, as a) the judge might not allow for the vote to take place, b) if the vote does take place, the two independent directors that were not part of the CBS complaint might not vote in favor of the proposal, c) potentially such a decision might now require a 90% super-majority of the board, assuming today&rsquo;s by-law changes are not struck down by the court.&nbsp; For CBS bond investors, we think there seems to be little potential upside in most of the scenarios, even as potential outcomes for Viacom investors can be more extreme, but may still be skewed to the upside for the long-end bondholders (as the risk to an immediate downgrade of Viacom to high yield by S&amp;P is likely low, given Viacom management&rsquo;s commitment to investment grade ratings and the uncertainty around potential strategic outcomes)&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) both opened higher as they took cue from Wall St where markets shrugged off rising Treasury yields and US data including Industrial Production provided some encouragement. However, Australian stocks then retreated amid heavy losses in the Industrials sector and a deterioration in both Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) and Hang Seng (-0.5%) in which the latter wiped out gains of over 1%. This was due to trade concerns after China&rsquo;s Mofcom released its statement on previously announced tariffs in which it is to levy reciprocal taxes on some US products and halt tariff concessions on imports of US fruit and pork, which doesn&rsquo;t bode well ahead of today&rsquo;s US-China trade talks. Furthermore, Japan was also said to inform the WTO regarding its own trade response and that it is ready to retaliate against US tariff actions, although Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga later downplayed it and stated that nothing yet has been decided. Conversely, not all was not all was gloomy in the region as Tencent outperformed in Hong Kong with gains nearly 5% after it posted an over 60% increase in Q1 net. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lacklustre as yields played catch up to their US counterparts, while a 5yr JGB auction also failed to support as the b/c and accepted prices slipped from prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is to levy reciprocal tax on some US products and will stop tariff concessions on imports of US fruits and pork, according to statement posted by China Mofcom regarding previously announced tariffs, although Mofcom also reiterated China doesn&#39;t want to see trade tensions with US to escalate.

The index is meandering between circa 93.100-560, vs yesterday&rsquo;s marginal new high for the year around 93.640, and also subject to choppy moves on the back of fluctuating fortunes in basket currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound has been buffeted by latest Brexit reports suggesting a customs union back-stop in some shape or form, with an initial boost on paper talk that the UK may stay in the current EU fold until 20121 or longer and then a downturn on denials via a spokesperson for PM May. However, Cable recovered to 1.3500+ and Eur/Gbp back below 0.8750 after subsequent headlines essentially pointing to a halfway house, while Eur/Usd remained leggy above 1.1800 after weakening to a fresh ytd low on Wednesday around 1.1761, and testing the downside again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both holding a firmer line vs their US counterpart, the Loonie still getting some support from elevated oil prices and not giving up on a NAFTA deal before the day is out even though the prospects are waning &ndash; Usd/Cad currently nearer the bottom of a 1.2795-50 range, above hefty option expiries at 1.2700 (running off today and more for Friday&rsquo;s NY cut) and well within barriers from 1.2925-1.2625. The Aud saw 2-way price action after a mixed Aussie jobs report overnight and has settled towards the middle of a 0.7505-45 band as some elements of the labour data were encouraging, while cross flows were also bullish as Aud/Nzd rebounded over 1.0900 again. Note, the Kiwi has also struggled above 0.6900 vs the Usd even though the NZ budget balance and forecasts improved overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Jpy a major mover, and largely to the upside as a series of technical levels held ahead of 110.00, including the 55 HMA and 200 DMA. Supply from Japanese exporters and option-related offers at 110.50 have been absorbed on the way to a 110.75 high, and the next bullish objective is a key Fib (110.85), while market contacts note corporate sell orders layered at 10 pip intervals from 110.50 to 111.00. Usd/Chf dull in comparison either side of par, while Eur/Chf has pared some recent losses to regain the 1.1800 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds rebounding firmly into positive territory and back above the 158 level to a new high for the day at 158.39 vs. the 157.73 low, while BTPs succumb to more heavy selling and reverse all and a lot more of their early recovery gains. The Italian 10 year benchmark has been down to 134.19, -94 ticks and taking the cumulative loss to well over two full points in less than two sessions. More concerns about the political situation and potential disruptive influence from the new regime in Rome clearly weighing on sentiment and spreading to other peripheral bonds. Prior to all this, a fleeting attempt to hold above 158.00 off the Eurex open only seemed to exacerbate the extent and speed of the subsequent fall the 10 year German bond found some underlying bids/support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, conflicting reports about an offer to stay in the EU customs union for another 3 years if not longer prompted a shallow recovery in UK debt and STIR futures, which remain under considerable pressure in keeping with the bearish tone elsewhere. In fact, Gilts are now slipping to new lows (121.07 vs 121.11 previously and -48 ticks on the day) having gapped down to 121.27 from yesterday&rsquo;s 121.55 Liffe close initially and only recovering to opening levels as a PM May spokesperson denied that any extended stay in the bloc&rsquo;s customs union is under consideration, and instead suggested a halfway alternative. Gilts then got a safe heaven boost with bunds to trade as high as 121.41 before fading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning to US Treasuries, futures have climbed off overnight lows but the curve remains steeper as 10 and 30 year yields hit fresh cyclical/multi-year peaks around 3.12% and 3.25% respectively. Some decent data/surveys to take on board later including weekly claims, Philly Fed and the leading index, along with more Fed speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is trading marginally higher today with Brent breaching USD 80/bbl, supported the prospect of a sharp drop in Iranian crude supply. There has been little oil news flow following the larger than expected DoE crude inventory drawdown. Barclays raised their Brent oil assumptions to USD 73/bbl in 2018 and USD 70/bbl in 2019, following suit from other analysts. Yesterday, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh stated Iran will be doing its best to maintain production and continue exports, while he also commented that oil prices at USD 60-65/bbl are &#39;logical&#39; and the US wants to see high prices to boost shale production. Elsewhere, gold and copper trade lower on the day as the yellow and red metal track the current risk tone.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discounting the SMI (-0.3%) being weighed on by major component underperformance all major European bourses are trading in positive territory for the day with the Euro Stoxx 50 up 0.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an earnings heavy morning, Altice (+10.5%) Lagardere (+2.3%) and National Grid (+1.6%) posted positive results and are currently trading positive for the day, with AP Moeller-Maersk (-9.4%) Investec (-4.5%) and Royal Mail (-5.4%) coming in under expectations and trading in negative territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pervasive news for the UK gambling sector with the UK cutting the maximum stake in FOBTs to GBP 2.00 has led to gambling names such as William Hill (-3.0%) and Paddy Power (-0.7%) being down for the day on the announcements that revenues will be impacted negatively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ocado (+40.0%) have been boosted on the news that Kroger is set to take a 5% stake in the co., whilst Recordati (+5.1%) have been supported by the news that CVC Capital Partners is holding talks over an EUR 8bln deal for a takeover of the co., despite there being some disagreements over the price of the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is trading marginally higher today with WTI (+0.3%) and Brent (0.2%) feeling support from the softer greenback. There has been little oil news flow following the larger than expected DoE crude inventory drawdown. Barclays raised their Brent oil assumptions to USD 73/bbl in 2018 and USD 70/bbl in 2019, following suit from other analysts. Yesterday, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh stated Iran will be doing its best to maintain production and continue exports, while he also commented that oil prices at USD 60-65/bbl are &#39;logical&#39; and the US wants to see high prices to boost shale production. Elsewhere, gold and copper trade lower on the day as the yellow and red metal track the current risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volatile trade on conflicting drivers as the ongoing rally in US Treasury yields underpins the Greenback and offers protection against global tariff headwinds. The index is meandering between circa 93.100-450, vs yesterday&rsquo;s marginal new high for the year around 93.640, and also subject to choppy moves on the back of fluctuating fortunes in basket currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound has been buffeted by latest Brexit reports suggesting a customs union back-stop in some shape or form, with an initial boost on paper talk that the UK may stay in the current EU fold until 20121 or longer and then a downturn on denials via a spokesperson for PM May. However, Cable has recovered to 1.3500+ and Eur/Gbp is back below 0.8750 after subsequent headlines essentially pointing to a halfway house, while Eur/Usd remains leggy above 1.1800 after weakening to a fresh ytd low on Wednesday around 1.1761.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;CAD/AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both holding a firmer line vs their US counterpart, the Loonie still getting some support from elevated oil prices and not giving up on a NAFTA deal before the day is out even though the prospects are waning &ndash; Usd/Cad currently nearer the bottom of a 1.2795-50 range, above hefty option expiries at 1.2700 (running off today and more for Friday&rsquo;s NY cut) and well within barriers from 1.2925-1.2625. The Aud saw 2-way price action after a mixed Aussie jobs report overnight and has settled towards the middle of a 0.7505-45 band as some elements of the labour data were encouraging, while cross flows were also bullish as Aud/Nzd rebounded over 1.0900 again. Note, the Kiwi has also struggled above 0.6900 vs the Usd even though the NZ budget balance and forecasts improved overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Jpy a major mover, and largely to the upside as a series of technical levels held ahead of 110.00, including the 55 HMA and 200 DMA. Supply from Japanese exporters and option-related offers at 110.50 have been absorbed on the way to a 110.75 high, and the next bullish objective is a key Fib (110.85), while market contacts note corporate sell orders layered at 10 pip intervals from 110.50 to 111.00. Usd/Chf dull in comparison either side of par, while Eur/Chf has pared some recent losses to regain the 1.1800 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fleeting attempt to hold above 158.00 off the Eurex open only seemed to have exacerbated the extent and speed of the subsequent fall to an early 157.73 low (-45 ticks) before the 10 year German bond found some underlying bids/support. Moreover, trading volumes are relatively brisk and approaching 100k lots in the first hour or so, as US Treasury yields continue to rally and the curve bear steepen. Bunds and core Eurozone debt are also losing a prop as Italian BTPs stabilise after Wednesday&rsquo;s meltdown, and there is heavy supply to make room for via France and Spain. Data-wise, slim pickings ahead apart from Eurozone trade, while ECB speak comes from outgoing VP Constancio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, conflicting reports about an offer to stay in the EU customs union for another 3 years if not longer prompted a shallow recovery in UK debt and STIR futures, which remain under considerable pressure in keeping with the bearish tone elsewhere. In fact, Gilts are now slipping to new lows (121.07 vs 121.11 previously and -48 ticks on the day) having gapped down to 121.27 from yesterday&rsquo;s 121.55 Liffe close initially and only recovering to opening levels as a PM May spokesperson denied that any extended stay in the bloc&rsquo;s customs union is under consideration. Ahead, another blank domestic data schedule, but BoE&rsquo;s Haldane is on the docket after hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning to US Treasuries, futures have climbed off overnight lows but the curve remains steeper as 10 and 30 year yields hit fresh cyclical/multi-year peaks around 3.12% and 3.25% respectively. Some decent data/surveys to take on board later including weekly claims, Philly Fed and the leading index, along with more Fed speak.</p>\r\n",

However, Cable has recovered to 1.3500+ and Eur/Gbp is back below 0.8750 after subsequent headlines essentially pointing to a halfway house, while Eur/Usd remains leggy above 1.1800 after weakening to a fresh ytd low on Wednesday around 1.1761.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;CAD/AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both holding a firmer line vs their US counterpart, the Loonie still getting some support from elevated oil prices and not giving up on a NAFTA deal before the day is out even though the prospects are waning &ndash; Usd/Cad currently nearer the bottom of a 1.2795-50 range, above hefty option expiries at 1.2700 (running off today and more for Friday&rsquo;s NY cut) and well within barriers from 1.2925-1.2625. The Aud saw 2-way price action after a mixed Aussie jobs report overnight and has settled towards the middle of a 0.7505-45 band as some elements of the labour data were encouraging, while cross flows were also bullish as Aud/Nzd rebounded over 1.0900 again. Note, the Kiwi has also struggled above 0.6900 vs the Usd even though the NZ budget balance and forecasts improved overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Jpy a major mover, and largely to the upside as a series of technical levels held ahead of 110.00, including the 55 HMA and 200 DMA. Supply from Japanese exporters and option-related offers at 110.50 have been absorbed on the way to a 110.75 high, and the next bullish objective is a key Fib (110.85), while market contacts note corporate sell orders layered at 10 pip intervals from 110.50 to 111.00. Usd/Chf dull in comparison either side of par, while Eur/Chf has pared some recent losses to regain the 1.1800 handle.</p>\r\n",

(FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&#39;s M5S and the League have completed the joint policy programme and passed on the document to leaders for its approval, although it is not due to be officially released until the weekend. Furthermore, the Five Star and League government contract is said not to include a Euro exit option. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY is weaker on a continuation of the prior day&rsquo;s pullback and on the Chinese sabre-rattling ahead of trade talks. This underpinned its major counterparts with GBP/USD also finding solace on reports that the UK is to tell the EU it is prepared to remain in the customs union arrangement beyond 2021. Elsewhere. AUD/USD saw a bout of indecision on mixed jobs data as Employment Change topped estimates and the Unemployment Rate unexpectedly rose. However, AUD eventually extended on gains as the rise in unemployment coincided with an increase in the Participation Rate and as the data ultimately showed better quality of growth as it was solely fuelled by Full-Time jobs. NZD/USD also mirrored gains after the New Zealand budget showed forecasts for a larger surplus in the near term and that GDP guidance was raised to 3.8% from 3.4% for 2018/19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Employment Change (Apr) 22.6k vs. Exp. 20.0k (Prev. 4.9k, Rev. -0.7k). (Newswires)<br />Australian Full Time Employment Change (Apr) 32.7k (Prev. -19.9k, Rev. -25.1k)<br />Australian Unemployment Rate (Apr) 5.6% vs. Exp. 5.5% (Prev. 5.5%)<br />Australian Participation Rate (Apr) 65.6% vs. Exp. 65.5% (Prev. 65.5%)<br /><br />Brazilian Selic Interest Rate 6.50% vs. Exp. 6.25% (Prev. 6.50%); vote was unanimous. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities saw mild support overnight alongside the backdrop of a softer greenback with WTI crude futures making further headway towards the USD 72.00/bbl after prices were lifted during US trade by a larger than expected DoE crude inventory drawdown. Elsewhere, gold and copper were also marginally positive but with upside contained on lingering prospects of 4 Fed hike this year and by a subdued risk tone, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh stated Iran will be doing its best to maintain production and continue exports, while he also commented that oil prices at USD 60-65/bbl are &#39;logical&#39; and the US wants to see high prices to boost shale production. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said &#39;we&#39;ll have to see&#39; if the North Korea summit is still on and will insist on the denuclearisation of North Korea, while US National Security Adviser Bolton said that the Trump-Kim summit should still happen even though North Korea is threatening to back out. (Fox News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paris continues to work with Iran to expand the agreement by adding its missile programme and actions in the region to the deal whilst preserving original JCPOA, according to a French ambassador speaking to Russia. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries ended the day pretty much unchanged, despite decent volumes and a busy day in the European fixed income complex, where Italian BTPs tumbled amid political uncertainty whilst German bunds acted as a safe haven alternative. Treasury yields were higher by less than 1bps, with the exception of the 10yr yield which was higher by just about 1bps, consolidating yesterday&rsquo;s gains above the 3% level. Heading towards settlement, 2s10s widened by c.1bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 2 ticks lower at 118-17+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump legal adviser Giuliani said Special Counsel Mueller told the Trump team that he will adhere to Justice Department guidance that a sitting president cannot be indicted. (CNN)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bullard (non-voter, dove) said US is close to neutral rate, while he also commented that there is no yield curve inversion danger just now and that it has a nice slope. Bullard later added that additional rate increases may depress inflation expectations and that Fed action which inverts yield curves is a very negative signal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Ross and Trade Representative Lighthizer will be meeting with the Chinese delegation, while there were conflicting reports on whether Trump trade adviser and China-hawk Navarro will be attending. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House Ways and Means Committee Chair Brady said Chinese Vice-Premier Liu wants to increase Chinese demand for US products and that he does see problems in trade relations, although he added that Liu is said to be optimistic about trade talks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexican Economy Minister Guajardo said it is basically impossible to have a NAFTA deal by the 17th and that NAFTA ministers are exploring the possibility of meeting again. Guajardo added that the soft deadline has some margin of flexibility and does not rule out reaching a NAFTA deal from end of May onwards. Elsewhere, US Trade Representative Lighthizer is said to not be optimistic for an imminent NAFTA agreement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mostly subdued as the initial tailwind from a rebound in US stocks gradually waned after trade protectionism concerns were stoked overnight. ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) both opened higher as they took cue from Wall St where markets shrugged off rising Treasury yields and US data including Industrial Production provided some encouragement. However, Australian stocks then retreated amid heavy losses in the Industrials sector and a deterioration in both Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) in which the latter wiped out gains of over 1%. This was due to trade concerns after China&rsquo;s Mofcom released its statement on previously announced tariffs in which it is to levy reciprocal taxes on some US products and halt tariff concessions on imports of US fruit and pork, which doesn&rsquo;t bode well ahead of today&rsquo;s US-China trade talks. Furthermore, Japan was also said to inform the WTO regarding its own trade response and that it is ready to retaliate against US tariff actions, although Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga later downplayed it and stated that nothing yet has been decided. Conversely, not all was not all was gloomy in the region as Tencent outperformed in Hong Kong with gains nearly 5% after it posted an over 60% increase in Q1 net. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lacklustre as yields played catch up to their US counterparts, while a 5yr JGB auction also failed to support as the b/c and accepted prices slipped from prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is weaker on a continuation of the prior day&rsquo;s pullback and on the Chinese sabre-rattling ahead of trade talks.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly subdued as the initial tailwind from a rebound in US stocks gradually waned after trade protectionism concerns were stoked. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) both opened higher as they took cue from Wall St where markets shrugged off rising Treasury yields and after US data including Industrial Production provided some encouragement. However, Australian stocks then retreated amid heavy losses in the Industrials sector and a deterioration in both Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (+0.1%) in which the latter all but wiped out gains of over 1%. This was due to trade tensions after China&rsquo;s Mofcom released its statement on previously announced tariffs in which it is to levy reciprocal taxes on some US products and halt tariff concessions on imports of US fruit and pork, which likely won&rsquo;t bode well ahead of today&rsquo;s US-China trade talks. Furthermore, Japan was also said to inform the WTO regarding its own trade response and that it is ready to retaliate against US tariff actions, although Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga later downplayed it and stated that nothing yet has been decided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is weaker on a continuation of the prior day&rsquo;s pullback and on the Chinese sabre-rattling ahead of trade talks. This has underpinned its major counterparts with GBP/USD also finding solace on reports that the UK is to tell the EU it is prepared to remain in customs union arrangement beyond 2021. Elsewhere. AUD/USD saw a bout of indecision on mixed jobs data as Employment Change topped estimates but the Unemployment Rate unexpectedly rose. However, AUD eventually extended on gains as the rise in unemployment coincided with an increase in the Participation Rate and as the data ultimately showed better quality of growth and was solely fuelled by Full-Time jobs, while NZD/USD also mirrored gains after the New Zealand budget forecast a larger surplus in the near term and also raised GDP guidance to 3.8% from 3.4% for 2018/19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lacklustre amid an indecisive tone in stocks and with participants awaiting a 5yr auction later today.</p>\r\n",
