However, losses were pared back, helped by a solid 10-year auction which stopped-through by 0.5bps on strong cover, while indirect bidders (one proxy for foreign demand) taking 71.5% of the issue.

Kaplan also commented on today&rsquo;s news that China is considering slowing/stopping purchases of US Treasuries due to their &lsquo;relative unattractiveness&rsquo;, saying that it would not disrupt the Fed&rsquo;s plan to reduce bond holdings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Evans (voter in 2017, non-voter in 2018) gave a little more colour on his December dissent against lifting rates, saying that he&rsquo;d have preferred for the FOMC to wait until mid-2018 for signs of stronger inflation pressures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Bullard avoided talking current monetary policy, instead focussing on policy regimes (price-level targeting). He did say, however, that he did not see a high chance of an impending recession in the US, and noted that inflation expectations have edged up slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thursday&rsquo;s docket includes further comments from non-voters Patrick Harker (on the economic outlook) and Eric Rosengren (a keynote address).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX -0.12% at 2748, DJI -0.06% at 25369, NDX -0.23% at 6663</strong><br />Top sectors: Financials +0.5%, Industrials +0.1%, Energy -0.1%<br />Bottom sectors: Utilities -1.0%, Telecoms -1.0%, Basic Materials -0.7%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US stocks managed to pare back initial knee-jerk losses seen after it was reported that China was cooling on US government debt. However, major bourses still closed in the red. Financials were positive, however, ahead of bank earnings this week, and the steeper yield curve. The defensive utilities and telecoms sectors &ndash; strong dividend payers &ndash; were hit as US yields rose, reducing the allure of dividends out of the sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Note Futures settle 1+ ticks lower at 123-00</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were hit in pre-market trade after news that officials in China &ndash; the largest foreign owner of US Treasuries &ndash; have recommended that the country slow or even stop purchases of US government bonds on the notion that they are becoming less attractive relative to other bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The immediate reaction was a sell-off in US debt, with 10-year yields within spitting distance of 2.60%, and 2s once again setting their crosshairs on 2.00%, while the USD also eased. However, losses were pared back, helped by a solid 10-year auction which stopped-through by 0.5bps on strong cover, while indirect bidders (one proxy for foreign demand) taking 71.5% of the issue. And after settlement, Treasuries had pared back the losses to trade flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY -0.25% heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dollar was hit after reports that China was considering slowing or stopping purchases of US Treasuries, thus requiring less USD to purchase said Treasuries. The USD begin down on the day as yen shorts continued to be squeezed in overnight APAC trade, with JPY finding a base around 111.50 heading into APAC trade. The EUR benefited, once again rising over 1.20, but couldn&rsquo;t manage to hold gains above the figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Canadian dollar was hit in late trade on reports that Canada feared the US would pull out of NAFTA. However, a White House Official denied this was the case, helping the CAD to pare back losses (the MXN mirrored CAD&rsquo;s moves in sympathy).

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK&rsquo;S TREASURY SUPPLY:&nbsp;</strong>Excluding bills, the US will this week sell a total of USD 56bln in 3s, 10s and 30s this week (USD 24bln of 3s on Tuesday, USD 20bln in a 10s reopening on Wednesday, USD 12bln in a 30s reopening on Thursday). The sales will raise a net USD 15.5bln in new cash, given the USD 40.5bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, according to TD Securities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CURVE FLATTENING:</strong> While short-end yields have been edging up on expectations that the Fed will continue on its hiking trajectory in 2018, yields for 10-year debt have generally been traversing sideways in a range between 2.40% and 2.50%, causing the 2s10s yield curve to flatten. The flattening has not gone unnoticed by Fed officials; the December meeting minutes &ndash; where the central bank hiked rates by 25bps, as expected &ndash; noted that officials agreed the flatness of the yield curve was not unusual by historic standards, but some, nevertheless, expressed concerns that any inversion of the yield curve could portend economic weakness. Those concerns were echoed by non-voters Bullard and Harker in recent days, while 2018 voter Bostic warned that the Fed should be cautious in setting policy to avoid an inverted yield curve, a factor that would influence his own thinking when voting on rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> Recent performance has been mixed, with four of the last six auctions tailing by an average of 0.5bps, however, performance has been improving over the last few auctions, with the three auction tail average on the screws. &ldquo;The improvement has been driven by a pickup in foreign demand,&rdquo; Barclays writes. &ldquo;On a three-month moving average basis, foreign demand has risen 5pp, to 16%. Domestic demand has also risen by 2ppt, to 52%.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the last auction, 10-year yields have risen by around 13bps, which may bring in more bidders. The latest dealer positioning indicates that dealers have cut their net positioning in the 7-11yr bucket to a short position of USD 1.13bln in the latest week (versus a small long of USD 0.26bln previously), according to Societe Generale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The 10-year note appears to be fair on asset swap versus the off-the-run 10s compared with the previous two auction cycles and fair to slightly cheap on the curve compared with 5s and 30s,&rdquo; SocGen writes, &ldquo;and the 2s10s curve has flattened more by almost 6bp since the last 10y note auction.&rdquo; The bank believes some concession will be required for the issue to be underwritten smoothly, which along with a firm pipeline of investment grade supply may provide negative influences. However, it also notes that positives include cheap outright valuations, the WI yields trading above the previous stop-out rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10-YEAR PREVIOUS AUCTION HISTORY:<br />- High-yield:</strong> 2.384% (vs six auction average of 2.30%)<br /><strong>- Tail:</strong> 0.4bps (vs six auction average of 0.5bps)<br /><strong>- Bid-to-cover:</strong> 2.37x (vs six auction average of 2.44x)<br /><strong>- Dealers:</strong> 34.4% (vs six auction average of 30.9%)<br /><strong>- Directs: </strong>8.4% (vs six auction average of 7.0%)<br /><strong>- Indirects:</strong> 57.2% (vs six auction average of 62.1%)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar Index is struggling to keep hold of the 92.000 level as losses vs the <strong>JPY </strong>in particular continue to stack up &ndash; Usd/Jpy down to 111.30 and not far from support straddling 111.00 (111.03-110.85). Ongoing spec about the BoJ tapering its JGB purchases pushed the Jpy higher across the board, with Gbp/Jpy down through 151.00 and close to 150.50 as <strong>Sterling </strong>was undermined independently by poor UK trade data (that overshadowed upbeat IP and a firm NIESR GDP proxy). However, Cable has reclaimed 1.3500+ status on broad Usd selling as China is reportedly not inclined to by more US Treasuries, after briefly breaching a key tech support level at 1.3495. <strong>CAD</strong> the only other G10 loser vs the Greenback on much worse than expected Canadian building permits, with the pair up towards 1.2500 where offers are reported having held above the 55 DMA (1.2436) or thereabouts. <strong>CHF</strong> a major safe-haven beneficiary of risk aversion (stocks down with bonds), with Usd/Chf recoiling sharply from just under 0.9850 to around 0.9755. <strong>NZD/AUD/EUR</strong> all back near recent highs vs the retreating Buck, with the Kiwi over 0.7200, Aud above 0.8750 and Eur testing offer/resistance at 1.2000. Focus now on the 10 year UST refunding leg with yields closer to 2.6% vs sub-2.5% at the start of Tuesday&rsquo;s session, before Thursday&rsquo;s long bond auction that could be overshadowed by the BoJ if it trims shorter end JGB Rinban buying activity overnight (which would merely fuel the QQE/YCC unwinding theory).</p>\r\n",

Conversely, sellers have paused for breath further along the curve with Bunds back towards the upper end of their 161.36-160.91 Eurex range and Gilts reclaiming 124+ status within the 124.30-123.95 Liffe range.

ASX 200 (-0.6%) was negative in which commodity names led the index&rsquo;s pullback from decade highs, while Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) was subdued on continued JPY strength. Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (+0.2%) were initially mixed with the mainland indecisive after the PBoC resumed open market operations for the 1st time in 13 sessions, although its efforts still amounted to a net neutral position after maturing operations were accounted for and as participants digested mixed CPI and PPI data.

(Newswires) However, separate reports suggest that the EU is said to warn UK companies of being shut-out should a no-deal Brexit occur. (FT) Additionally, opposition from Germany reportedly risks derailing UK hopes for a bespoke post-Brexit trade deal. The reports suggest that Merkel considers the idea another ruse for Britain to &ldquo;have its cake and eat it&rdquo;. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>European equities initially kicked the session off with little in the way of firm direction</strong> as macro newsflow remained light from a European perspective. In terms of sector specifics, <strong>financial names outperform their peers</strong> in the wake of the continuing moves seen in global yields with RBS near the top of the FSTE 100 following a positive broker move at Morgan Stanley. Other notable movers include Sainsburys (+1.4%) who now see FY 17/18 underlying pretax profit to be moderately ahead of market consensus. Despite initially seeing muted trade, <strong>equities were dealt a blow in line with other global asset classes after news that Chinese officials are said to see Treasuries as less attractive. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, <strong>JPY</strong> is extending gains and outperformance vs G10 and other peers via accelerated moves overnight. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> down through 112.00 stops to a circa 111.75 low. <strong>The move in USD/JPY was then exacerbated by mass-USD weakness</strong> after the aforementioned comments from Chinese officials suggesting they recommend slowing or halting in Treasury purchases; USD-index extending losses below 92.50, pushing EUR/USD briefly back above 1.2000. <strong>NOK</strong> and <strong>SEK</strong> both firmer vs the EUR, former in wake of stronger than expected Norwegian inflation data and latter on hawkish views revealed in the latest Riksbank policy meeting minutes (time to normalise policy nearer and scope to hike before the ECB. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>NOK</strong> down below 9.6000 and <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>SEK</strong> sub-9.7600. <strong>NZD</strong> 2nd to the rampant <strong>JPY</strong> among G10 currencies and retesting 0.7200+ levels vs the <strong>USD</strong>, while its <strong>AUD</strong> antipodean counterpart back above 0.7850 vs the Greenback and the <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>NZD</strong> cross under 1.0900, perhaps hampered by soft Chinese CPI data. <strong>GBP</strong> initially unfazed by latest stellar production figures after being offset by the widest trade deficit in 5 months, before eventually moving lower with <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> now through key support at 1.3495.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reports about China losing its appetite for US Treasuries hit just before Germany&rsquo;s new 10 year Bund launch and thus the market impact intensified by several notches. USTs unsurprisingly bearing the brunt with the 10 year yield close to 2.60% (2.63% now within sight), as circa 200k lots have been flogged in futures, and long bonds heading towards 3%, with supply still to digest and the prospect of no Chinese demand. Bunds still holding above 161.00 despite a less than rapturous welcome for the new 10 year benchmark, but Gilts yielding 124.00 and down to a new Liffe session low at 123.95 (-33 ticks).

The move also came in the context of the EIA raising its forecast for 2018 world oil demand growth by 100k BPD, now forecasting a 1.72mln BPD Y/Y increase. In metals markets, <strong>gold prices have seen a modest recovery in European hours</strong> and continue to track fluctuations in the USD. Elsewhere, copper was rangebound during Asia-Pac trade amid an indecisive risk tone in the region while Chinese futures remain supported by the Chinese supply crackdown, however, analysts remain wary over the potential demand impact from adverse weather conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US API weekly crude stocks (5 Jan, w/e) -11.19M vs. Exp. -3.90M (Prev. -4.99M).

        "content": "<p>European equities have kicked the session off with little in the way of firm direction as macro newsflow remains light from a European perspective. In terms of sector specifics, financial names outperform their peers in the wake of the continuing moves seen in global yields with RBS near the top of the FSTE 100 following a positive broker move at Morgan Stanley. Elsewhere, energy names are the only other sector trading higher after another noteworthy drawdown in the API data last night. Other notable movers include Sainsburys (+1.4%) who now see FY 17/18 underlying pretax profit to be moderately ahead of market consensus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, JPY is extending gains and outperformance vs G10 and other peers via accelerated moves overnight. USD/JPY down through 112.00 stops to a circa 111.75 low, with nearest support seen at 111.65 before 111.53 (key Fib) and then the 111.40-34 area. NOK and SEK both firmer vs the EUR, former in wake of stronger than expected Norwegian inflation data and latter on hawkish views revealed in the latest Riksbank policy meeting minutes (time to normalise policy nearer and scope to hike before the ECB. EUR/NOK down below 9.6000 and EUR/SEK sub-9.7600. NZD 2nd to the rampant JPY among G10 currencies and retesting 0.7200+ levels vs the USD, while its AUD antipodean counterpart remains below 0.7850 vs the Greenback and the AUD/NZD cross under 1.0900, perhaps hampered by soft Chinese CPI data. GBP initially unfazed by latest stellar production figures after being offset by the widest trade deficit in 5 months, before eventually moving lower with GBP/USD now through key support at 1.3495.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much response to rather mixed UK data, as Gilts slipped just a few ticks, but maintained the bulk of their rebound gains alongside Bunds and US Treasuries. In fact, the initial/early selling pressure has abated and given way to consolidation, with dip buyers encouraged by some key levels in futures and cash holding in. The 10 year Liffe bond has subsequently nudged up to 124.30, 2 ticks over Tuesday&rsquo;s close vs 21 ticks down at one stage, while its Eurex equivalent erased all its losses on the day at 161.30 having been 39 ticks underwater at the low. However, upcoming supply could see bears reassert their initiative with Italian and Portuguese syndicated sales coming on top of the new German 10 year benchmark (chunky Eur5 bn) and US refunding, not to mention corp deals and other issues. USTs have also regained some composure, but the 10 year note remains close to major support (123-00/01) and yield firmly above 2.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy prices remain near their highs in the wake of a significantly larger than expected draw down in headline API crude inventories (-11.19M vs. Exp. -3.90M). The move also came in the context of the EIA raising its forecast for 2018 world oil demand growth by 100k BPD, now forecasting a 1.72mln BPD Y/Y increase. In metals markets, gold prices have seen a modest recovery in European hours and continue to track fluctuations in the USD. Elsewhere, copper was rangebound during Asia-Pac trade amid an indecisive risk tone in the region while Chinese futures remain supported by the Chinese supply crackdown, however, analysts remain wary over the potential demand impact from adverse weather conditions.</p>\r\n",

Some consolidation since back above the 161.00 handle (to 161.13 at best), which offered little in the way of psychological support initially. The extended sell-off comes in response to further losses and bear-steepening along the UST curve, with the 10 year yield now up to circa 2.57% and 30 year above 2.90% ahead of respective refunding in those maturities today and on Thursday. The 10 year German yield has inched closer to 0.5%, understandably, but the average yield on the new 0.5% 2028 issue looks destined to cross that level at today&rsquo;s Eur5 bn auction.</p>\r\n",

From a value perspective, IFR note less value for 10yr Bunds within the German curve, cross-markets to other core paper. Finally, there are large redemptions (EUR 20bln Bund principals last week) which could offset the slew of supply. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bids are submitted by 1030GMT and results are published shortly after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: US to sell USD 20bln 10-year notes at 1300 ET (1800 GMT) on 10 Jan 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THIS WEEK&rsquo;S TREASURY SUPPLY:&nbsp;</strong>Excluding bills, the US will this week sell a total of USD 56bln in 3s, 10s and 30s this week (USD 24bln of 3s on Tuesday, USD 20bln in a 10s reopening on Wednesday, USD 12bln in a 30s reopening on Thursday). The sales will raise a net USD 15.5bln in new cash, given the USD 40.5bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, according to TD Securities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CURVE FLATTENING:</strong> While short-end yields have been edging up on expectations that the Fed will continue on its hiking trajectory in 2018, yields for 10-year debt have generally been traversing sideways in a range between 2.40% and 2.50%, causing the 2s10s yield curve to flatten. The flattening has not gone unnoticed by Fed officials; the December meeting minutes &ndash; where the central bank hiked rates by 25bps, as expected &ndash; noted that officials agreed the flatness of the yield curve was not unusual by historic standards, but some, nevertheless, expressed concerns that any inversion of the yield curve could portend economic weakness. Those concerns were echoed by non-voters Bullard and Harker in recent days, while 2018 voter Bostic warned that the Fed should be cautious in setting policy to avoid an inverted yield curve, a factor that would influence his own thinking when voting on rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> Recent performance has been mixed, with four of the last six auctions tailing by an average of 0.5bps, however, performance has been improving over the last few auctions, with the three auction tail average on the screws. &ldquo;The improvement has been driven by a pickup in foreign demand,&rdquo; Barclays writes. &ldquo;On a three-month moving average basis, foreign demand has risen 5pp, to 16%. Domestic demand has also risen by 2ppt, to 52%.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the last auction, 10-year yields have risen by around 13bps, which may bring in more bidders. The latest dealer positioning indicates that dealers have cut their net positioning in the 7-11yr bucket to a short position of USD 1.13bln in the latest week (versus a small long of USD 0.26bln previously), according to Societe Generale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The 10-year note appears to be fair on asset swap versus the off-the-run 10s compared with the previous two auction cycles and fair to slightly cheap on the curve compared with 5s and 30s,&rdquo; SocGen writes, &ldquo;and the 2s10s curve has flattened more by almost 6bp since the last 10y note auction.&rdquo; The bank believes some concession will be required for the issue to be underwritten smoothly, which along with a firm pipeline of investment grade supply may provide negative influences. However, it also notes that positives include cheap outright valuations, the WI yields trading above the previous stop-out rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10-YEAR PREVIOUS AUCTION HISTORY:<br />- High-yield:</strong> 2.384% (vs six auction average of 2.30%)<br /><strong>- Tail:</strong> 0.4bps (vs six auction average of 0.5bps)<br /><strong>- Bid-to-cover:</strong> 2.37x (vs six auction average of 2.44x)<br /><strong>- Dealers:</strong> 34.4% (vs six auction average of 30.9%)<br /><strong>- Directs: </strong>8.4% (vs six auction average of 7.0%)<br /><strong>- Indirects:</strong> 57.2% (vs six auction average of 62.1%)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia failed to sustain the positive lead from Wall St where all US majors resumed their record setting performance, with the regional bourses mostly lower as profit taking crept in. ASX 200 (-0.6%) was negative in which commodity names led the index&rsquo;s pullback from decade highs, while Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) was subdued on continued JPY strength. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.3%) were mixed with the mainland indecisive after the PBoC resumed open market operations for the 1st time in 13 sessions, although its efforts still amounted to a net neutral position after maturing operations were accounted for and as participants digested mixed CPI and PPI data. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower in a continuation of yesterday&rsquo;s post-Rinban pressure and in tandem of rising global yields, while a mixed 10yr auction result also failed to inspire demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, JPY continued to firm following yesterday&rsquo;s BoJ purchase tweaks with USD/JPY down a further 30+ pips on the session, while cross-related selling was led by GBP/JPY which slipped below the 152.00 handle. Elsewhere, the remainder of major currencies were range-bound with AUD slightly choppy as a proxy to the mixed Chinese inflation numbers, while CNY remained dampened following a weaker reference rate and prior reports that the PBoC suspended the counter-cyclical factor in CNY fixes which it had proactively implemented for 7 months as an effort to reduce volatility.</p>\r\n",

(+0.3%) and Hang Seng (Unch) are indecisive as participants digest mixed CPI and PPI data in which consumer prices missed estimates, and although the PBoC finally resumed open market operations for the 1<sup>st</sup> time in 13 sessions, this still amounted to a net neutral position after maturing operations were accounted for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, JPY continued to firm following yesterday&rsquo;s BoJ purchase tweaks with USD/JPY down a further 35+ pips on the session, while the selling has been led by GBP/JPY which slipped below the 152.00 handle. Elsewhere, remainder of major currencies are range-bound with AUD slightly choppy as a proxy to the mixed Chinese inflation numbers, while CNY remains dampened following a weaker&nbsp;reference rate and prior reports that the PBoC suspended the counter-cyclical factor in CNY fixes which it had proactively implemented for 7 months in&nbsp;efforts to reduce volatility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower in a continuation of yesterday&rsquo;s post-Rinban pressure, with demand also dampened ahead of a 10yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
