The short end was bid ahead of the 2-year auction, which stopped through the screens by 0.1bps, and saw solid demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With said government shutdown still looming in February, there was also attention on the four-week bill auction, which was also received well, stopping through by 2.5bps.

Although there is no an argument that ECB president Mario Draghi will take the opportunity to talk down the EUR on Thursday after the ECB&rsquo;s policy meeting, some believe that he could strike a more relaxed tone given that on a trade-weighted basis, the EUR has risen by only 0.6% in the last three months, and 1.4% in the last six months (versus 3.2% and 5.8% heading into the ECB&rsquo;s September meeting). Additionally, today&rsquo;s ZEW survey out of Germany was decent, with German businesses seemingly unconcerned by the recent sharp moves in spot EUR and crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable breached 1.40, largely on a softer dollar. Indeed, analysts have been cautioning about GBP strength, attributing much of its recent gains to its US counterpart. Analysts observe that gains vs the EUR have been more muted despite the outperformance against the buck. EURGBP has been traversing sideways since Q3 2017, knocking around the 0.88 mark (a level we slipped below again today).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aussie was ironed out overnight after iron ore prices were whacked. The AUD found support above the 0.7950 mark, and losses were pared back as the dollar eased, but is struggling to get its head above the 0.80 handle again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD and MXN are worthy of mentions, with both strengthening in late US trade after positive comments from US President Trump regarding the progress of NAFTA talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZAR, meanwhile, was slightly lower as traders await more clues on the fate of President Jacob Zuma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (19 Jan, w/e) +4.755M vs. Exp. -1.600M (Prev. -5.120M).

        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +0.22% at 2839, DJI -0.02 at 26210, NDX 0.83% at 6963</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top sectors: Utilities +0.95%, Consumer Discretionary +0.86%, IT +0.64%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom sectors: Telecom -1.16%, Health Care -0.52%, Consumer Staples -0.29%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US futures were taking the lead from weakness in European markets before the cash open; however, as the cash trading day got underway, US bourses resumed their upwards march, underpinned by solid earnings aftermarket on Tuesday from Netflix, helping boost other FAANG names. However, a negative note on from JPMorgan regarding Apple iPhoneX demand weighed on the tech giants shares in afternoon trade, which also dragged on indices too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurer Travelers reported earnings above expectations, helping it lead the Dow. Other earnings weren&rsquo;t so bright: Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble both pressured the Dow after their earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was also attention on steel names Alcoa and US Steel, with both trading higher after US President Trump said he was looking at applying tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. While Whirlpool and First Solar were trading firm after yesterday&rsquo;s announcement that the US would impose tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of sectors, the defensive utilities were outperforming, closely followed by tech shares, while telecoms lagged. After market earnings highlights include Texas Instruments, and United Continental.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Note futures (March) settles 10+ ticks higher at 122-13+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With President Trump in Davos, and a government shutdown potentially kicked down the road to 8/Feb, Treasury trade has been cautious, staying within recent ranges. The curve was narrower on the day, with yields in the belly falling by around c4.5bps on the day, while 10s were off by c4bps. The short end was bid ahead of the 2-year auction, which stopped through the screens by 0.1bps, and saw solid demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With said government shutdown still looming in February, there was also attention on the four-week bill auction, which was also received well, stopping through by 2.5bps. The Treasury will auction 5s and a 2-year FRN tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY down 0.3% heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a choppy day for FX trade, the buck was the laggard, and the DXY is 0.3% softer heading into APAC trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The buck was unable to hold onto gains made after BOJ governor Kuroda alluded to the central bank was not in a position to exit its loose policy, and gradually slipped lower as European traders got to their desks. USDJPY printed lows around 110.25, and lingers at those levels with the APAC session in sight. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR itself was buoyed by a solid consumer confidence print, that saw the single currency top 1.23. Although there is no an argument that ECB president Mario Draghi will take the opportunity to talk down the EUR on Thursday after the ECB&rsquo;s policy meeting, some believe that he could strike a more relaxed tone given that on a trade-weighted basis, the EUR has risen by only 0.6% in the last three months, and 1.4% in the last six months (versus 3.2% and 5.8% heading into the ECB&rsquo;s September meeting). Additionally, today&rsquo;s ZEW survey out of Germany was decent, with German businesses seemingly unconcerned by the recent sharp moves in spot EUR and crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable breached 1.40, largely on a softer dollar. Indeed, analysts have been cautioning about GBP strength, attributing much of its recent gains to its US counterpart. Analysts observe that gains vs the EUR have been more muted despite the outperformance against the buck. EURGBP has been traversing sideways since Q3 2017, knocking around the 0.88 mark (a level we slipped below again today).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aussie was ironed out overnight after iron ore prices were whacked. The AUD found support above the 0.7950 mark, and losses were pared back as the dollar eased, but is struggling to get its head above the 0.80 handle again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD and MXN are worthy of mentions, with both strengthening in late US trade after positive comments from US President Trump regarding the progress of NAFTA talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZAR, meanwhile, was slightly lower as traders await more clues on the fate of President Jacob Zuma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 90 cents higher at $64.47 per barrel; Brent futures settle 93 cents higher at $69.96 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi jawboning from Davos was the theme in early US trade, with the country&rsquo;s energy minister still anxious about the fragility of the oil market, but repeated his view that we are &lsquo;on our way&rsquo; towards market rebalancing. Indeed, those comments were given credence by Qatar&rsquo;s oil minister, who suggested that the market would likely achieve its &lsquo;rebalancing&rsquo; in Q3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s crude exports rose in November to 7.016mln BPD (Prev. 6.874mln), according to JODI data. Elsewhere, Venezuela&rsquo;s Amuay refinery (645k BPD) operations have been halted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the bell, the API reports energy inventory data for the week. The Street looks for stocks to draw for the tenth consecutive week: headline crude seen drawing 1.6mln barrels, distillates seen 1.5mln lower, while gasoline is seen building by 2.5mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The US Treasury will sell a total of USD 103.0bln during the week, with USD 104.5bln set to mature at month-end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shorter dated Treasury yields have continued to move higher over the past month, and as a result TD Securities expect 5-year &amp; 7-year coupons to be 25bps higher in this auction cycle compared with December&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also worth noting that CME Fed Fund Futures are pricing in just shy of a 75% chance of a 25bps Fed hike at its March meeting, with the same instrument currently pricing a 60% chance of 3 hikes this calendar year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month&rsquo;s shorter dated note auctions came in on the softer side, although the supply took place between Christmas and the turn of the year, and many expect the recent uptick in yields to garner extra demand in this cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TD Securities note that the &ldquo;2-year sector has cheapened substantially on the curve and we expect to see strong demand at auction as the yield stands near post crisis highs. While recent 2-year sales have seen lacklustre demand, we believe the crossing of the psychological 2% yield threshold and sharp cheapening on the curve can help draw in buyers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Societe Generale note that investment funds&rsquo; share at the 2-year note auctions have been dropping since September. The bank also suggests that the 2-year note appears to be trading fair on asset swap terms versus off-the-run 2-year notes at this point in the auction cycle compared with the previous two cycles. SocGen also posits that the cheapening of the 2-year sector on an outright basis and on the curve should support the upcoming auction though it might need concession to be underwritten smoothly. In terms of headwinds, SocGen highlights the poor performance of the sector at recent auctions, underscored by a steady decline in the bid/cover ratio.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Index looks to have topped out around 90.500 again and eyeing strong support at 90.113 (January 17 low), as initial relief on the end of the Government shutdown dissipates. Usd/Jpy and Jpy crosses started the broad turnaround in sentiment/direction with the still dovish BoJ quickly shrugged off amidst weakness in equities on the back of US President Trump&rsquo;s import tariffs. Usd/Jpy reversed further from 111.00+ highs through bids in the 110.60-50 area towards recent lows and key Fib support (between 110.20-05). Market contacts noted heavy Cad/Jpy selling and Gbp/Jpy offers, with the Loonie also one of the only G10 currencies to maintain losses vs the Usd (within a 1.2435-1.2490 range) as NAFTA talks re-start. Conversely, Cable extended post-Brexit vote heights to just shy of 1.4020, while Eur/Usd stretched the upside of its range to 1.2295 vs its 2018 pinnacle around 1.2325 and Usd/Chf slipped back below 0.9600. The Kiwi actually bettered its recent peak vs the Greenback at 0.7355 and will now take some cues from NZ CPI data (from an independent perspective). The Nzd was helped in part by cross-currents from the Aud cross that retreated below 1.0900, as Aud/Usd lost grip of the 0.8000 handle and more to almost test 10 DMA support around 0.7950.</p>\r\n",

Indeed, the core UK debt future has not bettered its 123.61 Liffe top and are highly unlikely to derive much further direction from the imminent CBI survey as the usual pre-US open period of consolidation looks well underway.

ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) were positive with Australia led higher by the energy sector as it tracked the outperformance of its counterpart stateside, while Nikkei 225 outperformed to reclaim the 24000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) were positive with gambling names underpinned in Hong Kong as Wynn Macau shares surged following strong Q4 results from its parent. Conversely, LG Electronics felt the brunt of trade protectionism measures with losses of as much as 5% in early trade after the US imposed a 30% tariff on solar imports to the US and approved safeguard tariff action on imported washing machines. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild upside in the latter half of trade, as participants took comfort from an unsurprising BoJ which kept its bond buying intentions stable and eased some tapering concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ kept policy unchanged as expected in which QQE with YCC was maintained and NIRP held at -0.10%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision on YCC was made by 8-1 vote with Kataoka the dissenter again and the central bank also extended the deadline for its loan program by 1yr. BoJ commented that inflation is likely to continue increasing to 2% target but risks to prices tilted to the downside and that inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged, while the central bank affirmed all forecasts for Real GDP and Core CPI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda says day-to-day JGB buying operations do not indicate future course of monetary policy and is closely watching FX markets. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior member of EU&#39;s Brexit team stated that UK has already &#39;agreed in principle&#39; to a Norway-style transition period for Brexit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Brexit directives draft showed the EU will not allow UK sector by sector access to the single market. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senate voted 81 vs. 18 to pass the stop gap spending bill to reopen government and fund it through to February 8th, while House also voted 266 vs. 150 for the 3-week stop gap measure which President Trump later signed to end the shutdown. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US imposed a 30% tariff on solar imports to the US and approved safeguard tariff action on imported washing machines. This resulted to various comments from other nations including China which said it was dissatisfied with the tariffs on US solar imports. Furthermore, Mexico said it regretted that it was not excluded from the measures, while South Korea stated it is seeking to reinstate tariffs on US products and have asked WTO to stop trade concessions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8.2 magnitude earthquake strikes off Alaska, prompting tsunami warning for the entire west coast. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equity markets rallied in early trade after US Senators agreed a deal to end the government shutdown on Monday. Meanwhile the Bank of Japan renewed their commitment to loose monetary policy until they reach the price target while Kuroda added that the recent change&nbsp; in Rinban operations was not an indication of future monetary policy. The DAX opened at a new record high with all major European bourses higher. easyJet led the FTSE 100 higher after a strong trading update while Sky shares rose despite the UK regulator saying that the deal with Fox is not in the public interests. However, the CMA proposed remedies to address the concerns and Sky have said it will review its position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only modest support for the Dollar in wake of the White House funding extension, as Senate approval was only achieved on the proviso that immigration issues will be sorted out by February 8th when the stop-gap bill expires. USD/JPY rebounded above 111.00 with the aid of dovish BoJ policy guidance and tones from the post-meeting press conference, as Governor Kuroda pledged to maintain QQE and YCC until the 2% inflation target is met (forecast by FY 2019/20). However, the headline pair has reversed course with ample supply/offers noted above the figure and currently mid-range ahead of 110.50 support. AUD the worst G10 performer and helping the DXY hold around 90.500 as AUD/USD recoils from 0.8000+ levels towards 0.7950 amidst weaker copper, iron ore and consumer sentiment. Cross flow also undermining the AUD as it slides below 1.0900 vs the NZD and the Kiwi maintains 0.7300+ status against the Greenback. Other major USD rivals all softer, with Cable back in the mid-1.3950 area after a spike to 1.4000 (new post-Brexit vote high amidst reports that a Norway style transition deal has been agreed in principle) &ndash; little response to much better than forecast UK public finance data. EUR/USD at the lower end of a 1.2225-75 range, eyeing ZEW next, but really the ECB on Thursday, USD/CHF still firmly above 0.9600 and USD/CAD nudging towards 1.2500 within a 1.2400-1.2600 broad recent range as NAFTA talks resume.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German ZEW Economic Sentiment (Jan) 20.4 vs. Exp. 17.8 (Prev. 17.4)<br />ZEW Current Conditions (Jan) 95.2 vs. Exp. 89.8 (Prev. 89.3).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early Eurex dip buyers will be encouraged by the fact that 161.00 did not really present much of an obstacle or psychological barrier as Bunds climbed steadily to a 161.13 peak. 161.40 is the next upside objective before the 161.55 intraday best from January 11, while failure to advance further and a pull-back would leave longs vulnerable on a break of the early 160.68 low, and expose 160.57 support ahead of yesterday&rsquo;s 160.38 session base. Gilts have extended gains to 123.61 (+17 ticks), while USTs are edging higher and flattening a bit further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany sell EUR 4.033bln vs. Exp. EUR 3bln 0% 2019 Schatz with a b/c 1.1 (prev. b/c 1.7), average yield -0.61% (Prev. -0.74%) and retention of 19.3% (Prev. 19.6%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures both traded higher as markets continue to digest the recent information regarding upbeat growth and demand outlook vs. fears of an increase in US shale output as prices remain elevated. Barclays have raised their forecasts for Brent after the strong start to the year but still maintain a bearish view in the quarters ahead. Gold and silver were mostly flat while copper declined around 1% as iron ore fell on the Dalian exchange.</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile the Bank of Japan renewed their commitment to loose monetary policy until they reach the price target while Kuroda added that the recent change &nbsp;in Rinban operations was not an indication of future monetary policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DAX opened at a new record high with all major European bourses higher. easyJet led the FTSE 100 higher after a strong trading update while Sky shares rose despite the UK regulator saying that the deal with Fox is not in the public interests. However, the CMA proposed remedies to address the concerns and Sky have said it will review its position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early Eurex dip buyers will be encouraged by the fact that 161.00 did not really present much of an obstacle or psychological barrier as Bunds climbed steadily to a 161.13 peak. 161.40 is the next upside objective before the 161.55 intraday best from January 11, while failure to advance further and a pull-back would leave longs vulnerable on a break of the early 160.68 low, and expose 160.57 support ahead of yesterday&rsquo;s 160.38 session base. Gilts have extended gains to 123.61 (+17 ticks), while USTs are edging higher and flattening a bit further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only modest support for the Dollar in wake of the White House funding extension, as Senate approval was only achieved on the proviso that immigration issues will be sorted out by February 8th when the stop-gap bill expires. USD/JPY rebounded above 111.00 with the aid of dovish BoJ policy guidance and tones from the post-meeting press conference, as Governor Kuroda pledged to maintain QQE and YCC until the 2% inflation target is met (forecast by FY 2019/20). However, the headline pair has reversed course with ample supply/offers noted above the figure and currently mid-range ahead of 110.50 support. AUD the worst G10 performer and helping the DXY hold around 90.500 as AUD/USD recoils from 0.8000+ levels towards 0.7950 amidst weaker copper, iron ore and consumer sentiment. Cross flow also undermining the AUD as it slides below 1.0900 vs the NZD and the Kiwi maintains 0.7300+ status against the Greenback. Other major USD rivals all softer, with Cable back in the mid-1.3950 area after a spike to 1.4000 (new post-Brexit vote high amidst reports that a Norway style transition deal has been agreed in principle) &ndash; little response to much better than forecast UK public finance data. EUR/USD at the lower end of a 1.2225-75 range, eyeing ZEW next, but really the ECB on Thursday, USD/CHF still firmly above 0.9600 and USD/CAD nudging towards 1.2500 within a 1.2400-1.2600 broad recent range as NAFTA talks resume.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures both traded higher as markets continue to digest the recent information regarding upbeat growth and demand outlook vs. fears of an increase in US shale output as prices remain elevated. Barclays have raised their forecasts for Brent after the strong start to the year but still maintain a bearish view in the quarters ahead. Gold and silver were mostly flat while copper declined around 1% as iron ore fell on the Dalian exchange. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

However, the bond trades at rich levels in RV terms, offering just a 0.2bps discount on the roll in OIS terms. Cross market, front-end Germany has outperformed recently, and Germany traders at or near 3-month highs in terms of yield give up here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK: The UK DMO taps the IL 26 today via a GBP 1bln notional auction, equivalent to GBP 1.25bln in cash terms and a fairly modest GBP 1mln/bps of risk. The bond shows few signs of concession in trading on Monday despite it being fairly rich on the curve. While it does not look particularly expensive in spot breakevens, forwards into the IL 26 out of the 5yr sector do not look cheap and we see shorter breakevens as better value. The IL26 has also richened on the real yield curve since early November, taking the IL Mar24/26/29 fly out of the relatively tight range in which it had traded for much of 2017. The bond has cheapened somewhat on this fly so its richness does not look extreme. The bond also looks expensive relative to its peers in relative asset swap. It is possible that either the market is short the bond, in which case the auction could go well, or that the liquidity event could generate some demand. However, we do not see a strong case for owning the issue.</p>\r\n",

If so, 161.40 is the next upside objective before the 161.55 intraday best from January 11, while failure to advance further and a pull-back would leave longs vulnerable on a break of the early 160.68 low, and expose 160.57 support ahead of yesterday&rsquo;s 160.38 session base. Gilts have extended gains to 123.61 (+17 ticks), but remain wary about looming PSNB deficits, while USTs are edging higher and flattening a bit further.</p>\r\n",

The corresponding benchmark yield has eased back towards 0.55% accordingly amidst broad curve flattening ahead of the 2 year Schatz sale, with the data focus on ZEW&rsquo;s latest survey, which should be upbeat given the relative strength of Germany&rsquo;s economy and robust outlooks from various institutions. On that very note, 2018 export growth has been upgraded despite the firm Eur, albeit not as strong on a TWI basis. Looking a bit further ahead, Thursday&rsquo;s ECB meeting should provide the next major directional lead for Bunds even though policy will not change and fresh guidance is not anticipated until March.</p>\r\n",

The last tap on August 8 was strong with a bid to cover of 2.98 and the tap before that on June 27 was super strong with a bid to cover ratio of 3.10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indications are that this auction should also deliver a smooth sale. Since the last tap, the breakeven is higher by around 15bp and expectations remain elevated with inflation running at around 3.00%. The curve offers some incentive on a RV basis where the stock is offering around 4bp inverted to the 0.125% 2024 and 1.25% 2027 fly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of historical data:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prev. b/c 2.99, real yield -1.853%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bids are submitted by 1030GMT and results are published shortly after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"_Hlk504405684\">AUCTION</a> PREVIEW: US to sell USD 26bln 2-year notes at 1800 GMT (1300 ET)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury will sell a total of USD 103.0bln during the week, with USD 104.5bln set to mature at month-end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shorter dated Treasury yields have continued to move higher over the past month, and as a result TD Securities expect 5-year &amp; 7-year coupons to be 25bps higher in this auction cycle compared with December&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also worth noting that CME Fed Fund Futures are pricing in just shy of a 75% chance of a 25bps Fed hike at its March meeting, with the same instrument currently pricing a 60% chance of 3 hikes this calendar year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month&rsquo;s shorter dated note auctions came in on the softer side, although the supply took place between Christmas and the turn of the year, and many expect the recent uptick in yields to garner extra demand in this cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TD Securities note that the &ldquo;2-year sector has cheapened substantially on the curve and we expect to see strong demand at auction as the yield stands near post crisis highs. While recent 2-year sales have seen lacklustre demand, we believe the crossing of the psychological 2% yield threshold and sharp cheapening on the curve can help draw in buyers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Societe Generale note that investment funds&rsquo; share at the 2-year note auctions have been dropping since September. The bank also suggests that the 2-year note appears to be trading fair on asset swap terms versus off-the-run 2-year notes at this point in the auction cycle compared with the previous two cycles. SocGen also posits that the cheapening of the 2-year sector on an outright basis and on the curve should support the upcoming auction though it might need concession to be underwritten smoothly. In terms of headwinds, SocGen highlights the poor performance of the sector at recent auctions, underscored by a steady decline in the bid/cover ratio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- High yield: Previous 1.922% (vs six-auction average of 1.581%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Tail size: Previous tailed by 0.3bps (vs six-auction average of 0.1bps tail)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Bid-to-cover: Previous 2.52x (vs six-auction average of 2.80x)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Dealers: Previous 45.5% (vs six-auction average of 37.9%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Directs: Previous 14.5% (vs six-auction average of 15.7%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Indirects: Previous 40.0% (vs six-auction average of 46.4%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) were positive with Australia led higher by the energy sector as it tracked the outperformance of its counterpart stateside, while Nikkei 225 outperformed to reclaim the 24000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) were positive with gambling names underpinned in Hong Kong as Wynn Macau shares surged following strong Q4 results from its parent. Conversely, LG Electronics felt the brunt of trade protectionism measures with losses of as much as 5% in early trade after the US imposed a 30% tariff on solar imports to the US and approved safeguard tariff action on imported washing machines. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild upside in the latter half of trade, as participants took comfort from an unsurprising BoJ which kept its bond buying intentions stable and eased some tapering concerns.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BoJ kept policy unchanged as expected in which QQE with YCC was maintained and NIRP held at -0.10%. (Newswires)<br />The decision on YCC was made by 8-1 vote with Kataoka the dissenter again and the central bank also extended the deadline for its loan program by 1yr. BoJ commented that inflation is likely to continue increasing to 2% target but risks to prices tilted to the downside and that inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged, while the central bank affirmed all forecasts for Real GDP and Core CPI.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day, CNY 80bln via 14-day and CNY 10bln via 63-day reverse repos.

This provided early support for its major counterparts and pushed GBP/USD briefly above 1.4000 for the first-time post-referendum, before moves were later pared. AUD also fluctuated as it benefited in early trade after the PBoC set the firmest fix since December 7th 2015, but then reversed gains on cross-related technical selling and amid a slump in iron prices. Elsewhere, the BoJ policy decision provided no surprises as the central bank maintained QQE with YCC and NIRP at -0.10% as expected, although JPY strengthened in a continuation of the moves seen prior to the announcement and amid some slight disappointment after hopes of an upgrade to growth forecasts failed to transpire. Furthermore, analysts at Informa also noted a tweak in the BoJ&rsquo;s language that &lsquo;inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged&rsquo; compared to its previous statement that &lsquo;inflation expectations were weakening&rsquo;. </a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed with oil higher as WTI crude futures eyed a retest of the USD 64/bbl level, while gold just about held on to the early mild support from the initial weakness in the greenback. Conversely, copper was subdued and failed to benefit from the broad heightened-risk appetite, amid a sell-off in Chinese commodity trade as Dalian iron ore futures tumbled 5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea is to mark a new army founding day just before the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.

Attention was once again on the 10-year yield, which rose above 2.67% at one point in the session, the highest level since 2014. This week, the Treasury will auction USD 103bln of notes this week. With USD 104bln set to mature at month-end, net Treasury supply is seen at -USD 1.5bln by month end.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US imposed a 30% tariff on solar imports to the US and approved safeguard tariff action on imported washing machines. This resulted to various comments from other nations including China which said it was dissatisfied with the tariffs on US solar imports. Furthermore, Mexico said it regretted that it was not excluded from the measures, while South Korea stated it is seeking to reinstate tariffs on US products and have asked WTO to stop trade concessions.

        "content": "<p><strong>Asia equity markets took impetus from the record levels seen across all major indices on Wall St. and after the US Congress passed the spending bill to end the government shutdown. ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) were positive with Australia led higher by the energy sector as it tracked the outperformance of its counterpart stateside, while Nikkei 225 outperformed to reclaim the 24000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) were positive with gambling names underpinned in Hong Kong as Wynn Macau shares surged following strong Q4 results from its parent. Conversely, LG Electronics felt the brunt of trade protectionism measures with losses of as much as 5% in early trade after the US imposed a 30% tariff on solar imports to the US and approved safeguard tariff action on imported washing machines. Finally, 10yr JGB are relatively flat as participants remain tentative ahead of the BoJ policy announcement. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild upside in the latter half of trade, as participants took comfort from an unsurprising BoJ which kept its bond buying intentions stable and eased some tapering concerns.</strong></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade higher as the region takes impetus from the record levels seen across all major indices on Wall St. and after the US Congress passed the spending bill to end the government shutdown. ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) are positive with Australia led higher by the energy sector as it tracks the outperformance of its counterpart stateside, while Nikkei 225 reclaimed the 24000 level to the upside amid a broadly weaker JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) are positive with gambling names underpinned in Hong Kong as Wynn Macau shares surge following strong Q4 results from its parent. Conversely, LG Electronics felt the brunt of trade protectionism measures and was down by as much as 5% in early trade after the US imposed a 30% tariff on solar imports to the US and approved safeguard tariff action on imported washing machines. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD remains subdued despite the breakthrough in Washington where both the House and Senate passed the stop gap measure to fund the government to February 8<sup>th</sup>, which gives lawmakers another 3 weeks to work on a full-year spending bill. This has supported its major counterparts in which EUR/USD extended on the prior day&rsquo;s highs and GBP/USD briefly rose above 1.4000 for the first-time post-referendum. Antipodeans also initially benefited after the PBoC set the firmest fix since December 7<sup>th</sup> 2015, but gains in AUD were later pared on cross-related technical selling, while the positive tone spurred outflows from safe-haven JPY which was seen in related crosses and with focus now turning to the BoJ decision due later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGB are relatively flat as participants remain tentative ahead of the BoJ policy announcement.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Preview, Due On Tuesday 23rd January",
        "content": "<p>The Bank of Japan&rsquo;s (BoJ) 2-day policy meeting will conclude on Tuesday, and the central bank is expected to continue the inaction seen throughout the entirety of 2017 by maintaining its QQE with Yield Curve Control policy, and leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged at -0.10%. The upcoming meeting will also include the release of the latest Outlook Report, containing the board members&#39; median forecasts for real GDP and core CPI. The current BoJ Board Members&#39; median forecasts can be found below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real GDP:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2017 forecast at 1.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2018 forecast at 1.4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2019 forecast at 0.7%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core CPI:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2017 forecast at 0.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2018 forecast at 1.4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2019 forecast at 1.8% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much has changed in terms of central bank&nbsp;rhetoric since the previous&nbsp;meeting, as Governor Kuroda has stuck with the profusely repeated statement that the BoJ will maintain its QQE with YCC for as long as is required to reach 2% inflation in a stable manner, while he also suggested that the economy is experiencing steady growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, economic data releases since the previous meeting haven&#39;t been much of a game changer, despite the latest national CPI (0.6% vs. Exp. 0.5%, Prev. 0.2%) and core CPI (0.9% vs. Exp. 0.8%, Prev. 0.8%) releases beating expectations, although inflation remains well shy of the Bank&rsquo;s 2.0% target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As policy tweaks are widely seen to be off the table for quite some time, the near-term focus regarding the BoJ seems to be on whether Governor Kuroda will be reinstated for another 5-year term&nbsp;when his current term expires in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants will also be looking out for any commentary regarding the recent bout of JPY strength with USD/JPY sitting on the 110&nbsp;handle vs. the 113&nbsp;seen at the December meeting. BoJ watchers will also be on the lookout for clues surrounding the BoJ&#39;s bond buying intentions&nbsp;after a recent reduction of 10yr-25 year and 25 year maturities in the Bank&rsquo;s Rinban operations triggered tapering fears and spooked markets earlier this month. Since then, sources close to the BoJ have stated that the market overreacted to the change, noting that the move wasn&rsquo;t meant to signal a broader policy shift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, there is no scheduled time for the decision, which usually comes any time after the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0230GMT/2030CST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What The Bank Desks Are Saying: -</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Barclays:</strong> We expect the BoJ to keep policy intact, while revising up its GDP forecasts and retaining its CPI projections.&nbsp; All-industry index: We estimate that the all-industry index rose again in November, with higher readings for both the tertiary index, which accounts for over 70% of the total, and industrial production, which has a weighting of more than 20%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BAML: </strong>After a quiet 2017, interest in the BoJ is rising once again. On 9 January, the BoJ&#39;s announcement of a &yen;10bn reduction in its &quot;rinban&quot; purchase of JGBs in the 10-25yr and 25-40yr segment caused a strong reaction in the markets and reignited headlines of early BoJ normalization. As we noted last week, we think the markets (in particular FX) over-reacted to the announcement. Our view is that the modest trimming of purchases is not, in and of itself, a signal of a new policy bias. Questions at 23 January&#39;s post-MPM press conference will nonetheless focus on the BoJ&#39;s &quot;stealth tapering&quot; of JGB purchases and the recent market reaction. We expect the governor to reiterate the central banks&#39; stance that the quantity of JGB purchases is an endogenous variable under YCC and could slow or reaccelerate depending on trends in the economy and financial markets. That said, we think the governor will strike an overall dovish tone at the conference to minimize risks that speculation over a pre-mature BoJ exit would trigger unwanted yen appreciation. The risk of rate hikes in 2018 has ranked top in our client conversations this week. We remain confident that this won&#39;t happen in spite of early change to communication. Inflation dynamics will matter for rate moves. FX enters in these considerations. Consequently, we stick to our view that the depo rate will be raised in 2Q19 and 4Q19 (20bp each). Last week&#39;s ECB speak, even among hawks, supports this view. Markets suggested we were (unusually) hawkish until recently. Pricing has now moved our way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Daiwa: </strong>Given the upbeat econmic sentiment reflected in today&rsquo;s Reuters Tankan, and what might well have been another quarter of above-trend growth at the end of 2017, Kuroda will be able to remain pretty bullish about the economic outlook. Nevertheless, with core CPI inflation still less than half the BoJ&rsquo;s 2% target, we (like the consensus) expect the Bank to retain its existing main policy settings, i.e. the -0.1% interest rate on banks&rsquo; marginal excess reserves and the pledge to keep 10Y JGB yields &lsquo;at around zero per cent&rsquo;. However, in light of the slight reduction in the size of the Bank&rsquo;s longer-term JGB purchases at its operations so far this month, unless we suddenly see significant upward pressure on yields (which, given the large share of the market already held by the BoJ, as well as its highly credible and rarely used unlimited fixed-rate purchase facility, might seem unlikely), we think it is clear that the BoJ has no intention to meet the &yen;80trn annual rate of increase in its holdings still specified in its recent policy statements. After all, the moves this month follow a year in which actual purchases amounted to just &yen;58trn. So, while the Bank will likely re-commit to maintaining purchases &lsquo;at more or less the current pace&rsquo;, this might just be the month that it explicitly acknowledges that this will result in net purchases closer to last year&rsquo;s total than &yen;80trn, or, better still, formally de-link achievement of the yield curve control target to a specific level of JGB purchases.&nbsp; While it&rsquo;s not expected, the BoJ might also finally wish to tweak its programme of ETF purchases. We continue to think that there is little sense in the Bank continuing to support an equity market that has risen to levels not seen since the early 1990s. While it seems unlikely that the Policy Board would decide to bring such purchases to an abrupt halt, a reduction in the annual pace &ndash; which was doubled to &yen;6trn in mid-2016 &ndash; would be neither a large surprise nor unwelcome. That said, the BoJ may be reluctant to make too many tweaks to policy settings at a single meeting, especially in light of recent yen strengthening. However, we do expect it to extend by one year its special fund-supply facilities. More prosaically, revisions to the projections issued in the Outlook Report will likely be minor. Given stronger-than-expected GDP growth in Q3, positive signs for Q4 and benign trends abroad, it would not be surprising to see a modest upward revision to the Board&rsquo;s collective sense of growth prospects in FY17 and perhaps FY18 (the median forecasts in October were 1.9%Y/Y and 1.4%Y/Y respectively). Until it has seen the outcome of the spring wage round, it seems unlikely to revise up significantly its forecasts of inflation (the median Board member forecasts of core inflation in October were 0.8%Y/Y, 1.4%Y/Y and 1.8%Y/Y for FY17, FY18 and FY19 respectively, the latter excluding the impact of the scheduled hike in consumption tax). Nevertheless, it will continue to suggest that it expects the 2% target to be met around FY19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HSBC:</strong> Underlying inflation pressures have been absent so far, despite positive q-o-q growth for seven consecutive quarters. Strong economic activity is not translating into higher prices, with wage growth showing limited signs of acceleration due to various structural factors. Consequently, the BoJ is likely to maintain its extremely easy monetary policy in the foreseeable future, as a premature pullback will dampen medium-term inflation expectations and also result in a notable correction in financial market instruments including the value of the yen. Meanwhile, this is likely to push the Bank&rsquo;s real GDP forecast for FY2018 slightly higher from the current 1.4%. Market participants will be closely watch whether the Bank keeps its optimistic core CPI forecast of 1.4% for FY2018, while we see risks that this could be marked marginally lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nomura: </strong>We expect the BOJ to leave monetary policy unchanged at the meeting. The economy has been solid and, although core inflation (inflation based on all items in the CPI index less fresh food) has been rising, it is far from the 2% target, indicating there is little justification for making any changes to monetary policy. In the Outlook for the Economy and Prices (Outlook Report) that will be released at the time of the meeting, we expect GDP growth forecasts for FY17 and FY18 to be raised. Since the Outlook Report was last released in October 2017, growth in the global economy has gathered pace, and we expect this to be reflected in the upcoming release of the report. Annual revisions to GDP data might also affect FY17 forecasts. We think the forecast for core inflation will be left unchanged. Recent increases in crude oil prices are likely to boost inflation, but yen strengthening against the dollar is likely to counter this boost and we do not expect changes to the core inflation forecast resulting from changes to import prices to be carried out this time.&nbsp; At the BOJ governor&#39;s press conference after the meeting, the governor might be asked about the decision to reduce the amount of longer-term bonds it purchases and his view of the market&#39;s reaction, as JPY strengthened after the purchase amount was scaled back on 9 January. We expect Governor Kuroda to reiterate the position that intentions with regard to changes to monetary policy are not reflected in daily market operations and that, regardless of the market&#39;s reaction, tenacious easing efforts will continue.</p>\r\n",
