        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP – 21st December: Trump repeats shutdown threats; Fed’s Williams hints at balance sheet flexibility; Navarro sees difficulties reaching deal with China",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities down, treasuries flat, dollar up, crude down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Trump repeats govt shutdown threat if border security funding is not approved; Fed&rsquo;s Williams notes Fed could revise balance sheet, Quadruple Witching, ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny sees need of faster normalisation, US GDP (Final) miss, Durables miss, Canadian GDP beat.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>** Business as usual up to 1845GMT Monday 24th December 2018; Closed for business 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 31st December 2018 and 1st January 2019; Normal service will resume at 0630GMT on Wednesday 2nd of January 2019 for the beginning of the EU Session**</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GOVT SHUTDOWN: </strong>US President Trump tweeted that if the Senate does not pass the spending bill measure approved by the US House &quot;it will be a Democratic shutdown&quot; and added that if Democrats vote no on the funding bill &ldquo;there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time&rdquo;. Trump noted there are &ldquo;pretty good&rdquo; chances of a shutdown and praised House Republicans for a vote on the wall funding bill, highlighting that Republican Senators want border security. Nonetheless, US Democrat leader Schumer warned that the Senate does not have votes to approve Trump&rsquo;s boarder wall request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Williams (Voter, Neutral) noted that the Fed could consider its balance sheet policy, if there is a deterioration in the economy, but stressed that we are not at the point where this policy should be reconsidered; Williams clarified that Fed Chair Powell, at his press conference earlier in the week, was referring to baseline forecasts when asked if balance sheet run-off will remain on autopilot. On the economy, he believes fundamentals are strong and he expects a healthy economy into 2019, though he sees risks to the outlook which could therefore change in the next few months. He stressed that the Fed will be data-driven in policy decisions and thinks currently we are at the bottom-end of the estimate of the neutral rate range. Alongside this, he denied reports that the Fed hiked to assert its independence in the face of criticism from US President Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>China Foreign Ministry &quot;resolutely&quot; opposed US reports on cyber security, adding that China will take necessary steps to safeguard its cyber security and interests following reports in the Washington Post on Thursday that US, UK, Australia, Canada, Japan and Germany plan to openly accuse China about its economic espionage activities. US trade adviser Navarro told Nikkei that a trade deal with China will be difficult to achieve in 90 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Nowotny (Hawk) said that the ECB should normalise monetary policy quicker than the market expects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US FINAL Q3 GDP </strong>fell slightly to 3.4% from 3.5%, a tad below expectations. GDP Deflator posted at 1.5% above the 1.4% consensus. Consumption spending and export growth were revised lower but partially offset by inventories; government expenditure was unchanged at 2.6%. Analysts at Oxford economics noted however that the latest reading does not alter the picture of an economy growing at the fastest pace since 2015; looking ahead &ldquo;solid fundamentals and lingering fiscal stimulus should make this the longest expansion on record in the next few months, growing headwinds from tighter financial conditions, higher input and borrowing costs, increased protectionism, and slower global growth will bring GDP growth down from 3% currently to 2% by the end of next year,&rdquo; Oxford Economics writes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US DURABLE GOODS </strong>rose by 0.8% in November, significantly below the 1.6% consensus, though rebounding from the previous fall of 4.3%. The headline was helped by a rise in non-defence aircraft offsetting declines in vehicles and parts. Core orders, excluding aircraft and defence, have slowed down recently posting -0.6% in November indicating that capital spending is losing momentum. Analysts at Wells Fargo warns that the &ldquo;weakness in orders suggests the rebound will be short lived.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADIAN GDP </strong>rose 0.3% in October from -0.1% and slightly above the 0.2% consensus amid a rebound in transportation orders. &nbsp;Retail sales rose 0.3% slightly below the 0.4% expectations; consumer spending softened in October following a sharp surge in Q2. Scotiabank notes &ldquo;at risk is how they hold up into the holiday shopping season given postal delivery disruptions and backlogs owing to a recovery from the Canada Post strike&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI SETTLES 0.29 LOWER AT USD 45.59/BBL; BRENT SETTLES 0.53 LOWER AT USD 53.82/BBL. </strong>A torrid session for crude leaves the complex lower at settlement; Brent and WTI found LOD in the US pre-market, before gradually moving higher, although the journey was less straightforward for WTI. Macro themes once again seemed to be the driving force, and oil moved higher in line with stocks after Fed&#39;s Williams suggested there may be some flexibility around balance sheet policy; while the gains made in equities were faded, , crude generally held on to them. And then there was the economic data slate: &quot;The revised US GDP data for 3Q may have also reminded the market that while growth may be slowing, neither the 3.4% rate for the third quarter or the expected 2.9% rate for the final three months of the year are anywhere close to recession levels,&quot; Citi said. &quot;There may be fears of recession and there may even be an actual recession somewhere out in the future, but there is no recession now. In oil-specific news, IEA chief Birol reportedly said that US production could rival Saudi Arabia and Russia combined by 2025. &quot;If we assume he&rsquo;s referring to barrels of oil equivalent, that would imply US overall output of some 17.8mln BPD for 2018, climbing to roughly 22.5mln BPD over the next seven years, a further increase of 26.4%,&quot; Citi said. &quot;As with the macroeconomic demand fears, this prospect of rising US supply feeds bearish anxiety regarding the future, but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate into oversupply if demand continues to grow and OPEC+ policy remains accommodative.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Nike (NKE) outperformed today after reporting a beat on EPS and revenue estimates, as well as benefiting from upgrades at JPMorgan and Pivotal Research; this helped Foot Locker (FL) to outperform on the day too. Altria (MO) opened lower following news of JUUL labs, which it has a 35% stake in, having to pay investors and employees USD 4bln to ease tensions over the acquisition; Citi also downgraded the stock. Perrigo (PRGO) nosedived on the back of news it was appealing a EUR 1.6bln fine in Ireland, creating uncertainty for its future. Conagra Brands (CAG) continued its fall from yesterday as JPMorgan and Credit Suisse both cut their price targets. FAANG stocks (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOGL) drifted lower through the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES. </strong>US T-Note futures were pretty much flat by settlement on Friday. There were some downticks after the Fed&rsquo;s Williams suggested that if the economic outlook deteriorated materially, the FOMC could consider its policy to keep the balance sheet unwind on autopilot. However, the Williams moves were faded, before T-Notes resumed modest up ticks, while equities resumed their slide. There is some focus on next week&rsquo;s auctions of 2s, 5s, 7s, with around USD 131bln of supply on tap, however, at the end of play, Treasuries were little changed, with most of the moves seeing the 2s sector, where yields were around 3bps lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP - USD: </strong>Arguably the most eagerly anticipated Fed, if not global Central Bank policy meeting of the year lived up to its billing in terms of market reaction, as the Dollar initially rebounded from circa 96.500 to just over 97.000, but then recoiled to a wtd low of 96.163 as the FOMC&rsquo;s updated dot plots, statement and press conference were dissected and digested. In sum, the Fed delivered a &lsquo;dovish&rsquo; 25 bp hike by scaling down 2019 tightening projections to &frac12; point in total from 75 bp previously and trimming the neutral rate to 2.8% vs 3% in September&rsquo;s SEP. However, &lsquo;gradual further tightening&rsquo; was only toned down with the insertion of the word &lsquo;some&rsquo; and not omitted altogether as a growing number were looking (or hoping) for. Hence, Dollar and DXY rallied on the 1st take before perceptions quickly changed in view of Chair Powell&rsquo;s caution and uncertainty regarding forward guidance given heighted economic risks and downward inflation pressures. Index currently consolidating around 96.600 vs 97.440 at the start of the final full trading week of 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>A net beneficiary of the weaker Greenback, with independent support/relief on the fiscal convergence between Italy and the EU after Rome&rsquo;s coalition Government reduced its 2019 deficit goal to 2.04%. Eur/Usd holding just above 1.1400 vs 1.1485 at best and a few pips below 1.1300 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Yet another week of Brexit bluster and nothing to show for it, as UK PM May faced more confidence challenges and EU intransigence on the key back-stop assurances needed to get approval for the withdrawal agreement. On that note, debating will start again after Parliament&rsquo;s Xmas and end of year recess on January 9th before the rearranged meaningful vote on the 15th. UK data was somewhat mixed, with CPI softer than expected and retail sales surprisingly strong, albeit seasonally skewed given Black Friday, Cyber Monday and seemingly permanent promotions/discounts on offer. No real surprises from the BoE expected or given, although the MPC revised down its growth and inflation outlooks amidst heightened Brexit uncertainly since the November policy meeting and QIR. Cable is now around 1.2650 within a 1.2705-1.2590 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The outstanding G10 winner amidst pronounced and at times quite severe risk aversion, with Usd/Jpy down through 111.00 vs a high of 113.50+, as certain Japanese stock indices entered bear market territory, inflation data missed expectations and the BoJ reiterated the need to maintain powerful easing, with a leaning towards more stimulus if required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, AUD, NZD: </strong>A miserable week for the non-US Dollars, with the Loonie suffering alongside crude prices and unable to glean any real or lasting traction from any snippets of upbeat or better than forecast Canadian data. Indeed, Usd/Cad rallied to new ytd peaks circa 1.3560 vs 1.3370 at the other extreme, as the ongoing diplomatic stand-off with China saw a 3rd Canadian national detained. The Aud fell victim to the general slump in risk sentiment and the RBA underscoring no haste to hike rates, and is now only just off sub-0.7100 lows and holding above 1.0500 vs the Kiwi by virtue of the fact that the Nzd has been hit even harder. Disappointing NZ Q3 GDP compounded reports that the RBNZ is in consultation about jacking up bank capital requirements by 100% for high grade assets and the last straw came via a very dovish call from ANZ for a 25 bp OCR reduction in November 2019. Nzd/Usd down to 0.6725 at worst from 0.6880 at the peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK, NOK: </strong>Contrasting fortunes for the Scandi Crowns as the Sek got an early Xmas surprise in the form of a Riksbank rate hike, albeit with 1 dissenting vote and shallower repo rate path out to 2021, while the Nok was undermined by the aforementioned slump in oil. Eur/sek briefly down to test 10.2400 vs Eur/Nok nudging 10.0000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Monday - Data: Chinese NBS Manufacturing PMI Tuesday - Data: Australian AIG Manufacturing Index.

Macro themes once again seemed to be the driving force, and oil moved higher in line with stocks after Fed&#39;s Williams suggested there may be some flexibility around balance sheet policy; while the gains made in equities were faded, , crude generally held on to them. And then there was the economic data slate: &quot;The revised US GDP data for 3Q may have also reminded the market that while growth may be slowing, neither the 3.4% rate for the third quarter or the expected 2.9% rate for the final three months of the year are anywhere close to recession levels,&quot; Citi said. &quot;There may be fears of recession and there may even be an actual recession somewhere out in the future, but there is no recession now. In oil-specific news, IEA chief Birol reportedly said that US production could rival Saudi Arabia and Russia combined by 2025. &quot;If we assume he&rsquo;s referring to barrels of oil equivalent, that would imply US overall output of some 17.8mln BPD for 2018, climbing to roughly 22.5mln BPD over the next seven years, a further increase of 26.4%,&quot; Citi said. &quot;As with the macroeconomic demand fears, this prospect of rising US supply feeds bearish anxiety regarding the future, but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate into oversupply if demand continues to grow and OPEC+ policy remains accommodative.&quot;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Italian budget breakthrough, Brexit recess and Central Bank surprises",
        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguably the most eagerly anticipated Fed, if not global Central Bank policy meeting of the year lived up to its billing in terms of market reaction, as the Dollar initially rebounded from circa 96.500 to just over 97.000, but then recoiled to a wtd low of 96.163 as the FOMC&rsquo;s updated dot plots, statement and press conference were dissected and digested. In sum, the Fed delivered a &lsquo;dovish&rsquo; 25 bp hike by scaling down 2019 tightening projections to &frac12; point in total from 75 bp previously and trimming the neutral rate to 2.8% vs 3% in September&rsquo;s SEP. However, &lsquo;gradual further tightening&rsquo; was only toned down with the insertion of the word &lsquo;some&rsquo; and not omitted altogether as a growing number were looking (or hoping) for. Hence, Dollar and DXY rallied on the 1st take before perceptions quickly changed in view of Chair Powell&rsquo;s caution and uncertainty regarding forward guidance given heighted economic risks and downward inflation pressures. Index currently consolidating around 96.600 vs 97.440 at the start of the final full trading week of 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A net beneficiary of the weaker Greenback, with independent support/relief on the fiscal convergence between Italy and the EU after Rome&rsquo;s coalition Government reduced its 2019 deficit goal to 2.04%. Eur/Usd holding just above 1.1400 vs 1.1485 at best and a few pips below 1.1300 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet another week of Brexit bluster and nothing to show for it, as UK PM May faced more confidence challenges and EU intransigence on the key back-stop assurances needed to get approval for the withdrawal agreement. On that note, debating will start again after Parliament&rsquo;s Xmas and end of year recess on January 9th before the rearranged meaningful vote on the 15th. UK data was somewhat mixed, with CPI softer than expected and retail sales surprisingly strong, albeit seasonally skewed given Black Friday, Cyber Monday and seemingly permanent promotions/discounts on offer. No real surprises from the BoE expected or given, although the MPC revised down its growth and inflation outlooks amidst heightened Brexit uncertainly since the November policy meeting and QIR. Cable is now around 1.2650 within a 1.2705-1.2590 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outstanding G10 winner amidst pronounced and at times quite severe risk aversion, with Usd/Jpy down through 111.00 vs a high of 113.50+, as certain Japanese stock indices entered bear market territory, inflation data missed expectations and the BoJ reiterated the need to maintain powerful easing, with a leaning towards more stimulus if required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A miserable week for the non-US Dollars, with the Loonie suffering alongside crude prices and unable to glean any real or lasting traction from any snippets of upbeat or better than forecast Canadian data. Indeed, Usd/Cad rallied to new ytd peaks circa 1.3560 vs 1.3370 at the other extreme, as the ongoing diplomatic stand-off with China saw a 3rd Canadian national detained. The Aud fell victim to the general slump in risk sentiment and the RBA underscoring no haste to hike rates, and is now only just off sub-0.7100 lows and holding above 1.0500 vs the Kiwi by virtue of the fact that the Nzd has been hit even harder. Disappointing NZ Q3 GDP compounded reports that the RBNZ is in consultation about jacking up bank capital requirements by 100% for high grade assets and the last straw came via a very dovish call from ANZ for a 25 bp OCR reduction in November 2019. Nzd/Usd down to 0.6725 at worst from 0.6880 at the peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes for the Scandi Crowns as the Sek got an early Xmas surprise in the form of a Riksbank rate hike, albeit with 1 dissenting vote and shallower repo rate path out to 2021, while the Nok was undermined by the aforementioned slump in oil. Eur/sek briefly down to test 10.2400 vs Eur/Nok nudging 10.0000.</p>\r\n",

Outperformance is seen in the FTSE 100 (-0.2%) after Anglo American (+1.6%) are up after resuming operations in their Minas-Rio iron ore plant; with other mining names such as Antofagasta (+2.3%), Glencore (+1.2%) and Rio Tinto (+1.0%) also in the green. Sectors are similarly in the red, with some outperformance seen in the materials sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable movers include Just Eat (+3.9%) who are up in sympathy after Delivery Hero (+9.0%) sold their German assets to takeaway.com. Danske Bank (-1.8%) firmly in the red after issuing their second profit warning for 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The Greenback has rebounded from overnight lows and the index appears to be forming a firmer base above 96.000, albeit thanks in part to counterpart currency weakness as broad risk sentiment remains bleak ahead of the festive break. Indeed, the DXY has ventured back over 96.600 vs 96.241 at one stage and a post-FOMC low of 96.163 ahead of a packed release schedule on the final full trading session of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi has extended losses vs its US peer in wake of Thursday&rsquo;s much weaker than expected NZ GDP data, news that the RBNZ is mulling a 2-fold increase in bank reserve holdings of high grade assets and a call by one prominent regional bank for the OCR to be cut by 25 bp late next year. Nzd/Usd is hovering around 0.6725 and Aud/Nzd is holding above 1.0500 even though the Aussie Dollar has fallen in sympathy and under the weight of broader risk aversion, not to mention another US-China spat that could derail efforts to resolve trade issues. Aud/Usd is pivoting 0.7100 with a hefty 2.1 bn option expiry at the strike perhaps exerting a gravitational pull.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/EUR - All succumbing to the latest Usd revival, as the Franc slips back below 0.9900 and Loonie hits fresh, albeit marginal new 2018 lows circa 1.3535 against the backdrop of still precarious crude prices, ahead of top tier and potentially pivotal Canadian data in the form of GDP and retail sales. Meanwhile, the single currency continues to mirror Dollar moves and perhaps respect more technical/flow-related levels with another fade ahead of 1.1500 and the 100 DMA at 1.1482 culminating in a drift back towards 1.1400 where 1.4 bn expiries reside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP - Both holding up relatively well, if not quite bucking the overall trend, although the Jpy is displaying its characteristic greater allure in risk-off climes and trades near the top of a 111.05-45 range. Cable is also pretty restrained between 1.2700-1.2645, with a raft of UK data largely shrugged off in the Brexit hiatus and consolidation in vogue before Xmas and New Year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - The Scandi Crowns are somewhat mixed as Eur/Sek rebounds from post-Riksbank rate hike lows and a key chart level at 10.2400 even though Swedish retail sales were firmer than forecast, while Eur/Nok has eased back from near 9.9500 highs and the Norwegian Krona sees some respite from the ongoing rout in oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a great deal of deviation in core debt as the upcoming holidays really begin to crimp trade and dampen the enthusiasm to implement new positions. Gilts did manage another minor new Liffe peak in wake of the UK data raft, at 123.21 (-9 ticks vs -36 ticks at one stage), but could not muster much more from the smaller than anticipated PSNB shortfalls before topping out. Bunds have also firmed up a bit and are back near their Eurex highs, as BTPs reverse from 127.77 to just below 127.00 after latest Italian sentiment indices revealing deeper declines in consumer and business confidence than forecast. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are narrowly mixed after some bear re-steepening on Thursday and eyeing a data deluge alongside Senate and White House decisions on funding to avert a Government shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-2.0%) and WTI (-1.0%) have seen a further decline in prices amidst ongoing concerns over global growth and excess supply. Recent news flow has seen comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak that they are sticking to plan to cut oil production by 228,000 BPD with Russian oil producers confirming their readiness to cut output. Separately, IEA&rsquo;s Birol has commented that US oil production will equal the combined production of Russia and Saudi Arabia by 2025. El Sharara oil field is still closed, contradicting earlier reports that the filed had reopened; as NOC the state oil firm is resisting pressure from some officials to pay off the protestors which initially caused the field to close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold prices which remained steady for much of the session have dropped into the red as the dollar has strengthened, although the yellow metal is still within a narrow USD 5/oz range on the day. Elsewhere, Chinese aluminium producers are estimated to cut more than 800,000 tonnes of capacity each year according to Antaike although no specific time period is given; for reference Chinese smelters have closed over 3.2mln tonnes of capacity in 2018. As according to the International Copper Study Group global refined copper market had a 168,000 tonnes deficit in September compared to 43,000 tonnes in August.</p>\r\n",

Recent news flow has seen comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak that they are sticking to plan to cut oil production by 228,000 BPD with Russian oil producers confirming their readiness to cut output. Separately, IEA&rsquo;s Birol has commented that US oil production will equal the combined production of Russia and Saudi Arabia by 2025. El Sharara oil field is still closed, contradicting earlier reports that the filed had reopened; as NOC the state oil firm is resisting pressure from some officials to pay off the protestors which initially caused the field to close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold prices which remained steady for much of the session have dropped into the red as the dollar has strengthened, although the yellow metal is still within a narrow USD 5/oz range on the day. Elsewhere, Chinese aluminium producers are estimated to cut more than 800,000 tonnes of capacity each year according to Antaike although no specific time period is given; for reference Chinese smelters have closed over 3.2mln tonnes of capacity in 2018. As according to the International Copper Study Group global refined copper market had a 168,000 tonnes deficit in September compared to 43,000 tonnes in August.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback has rebounded from overnight lows and the index appears to be forming a firmer base above 96.000, albeit thanks in part to counterpart currency weakness as broad risk sentiment remains bleak ahead of the festive break. Indeed, the DXY has ventured back over 96.600 vs 96.241 at one stage and a post-FOMC low of 96.163 ahead of a packed release schedule on the final full trading session of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi has extended losses vs its US peer in wake of Thursday&rsquo;s much weaker than expected NZ GDP data, news that the RBNZ is mulling a 2-fold increase in bank reserve holdings of high grade assets and a call by one prominent regional bank for the OCR to be cut by 25 bp late next year. Nzd/Usd is hovering around 0.6725 and Aud/Nzd is holding above 1.0500 even though the Aussie Dollar has fallen in sympathy and under the weight of broader risk aversion, not to mention another US-China spat that could derail efforts to resolve trade issues. Aud/Usd is pivoting 0.7100 with a hefty 2.1 bn option expiry at the strike perhaps exerting a gravitational pull.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All succumbing to the latest Usd revival, as the Franc slips back below 0.9900 and Loonie hits fresh, albeit marginal new 2018 lows circa 1.3535 against the backdrop of still precarious crude prices, ahead of top tier and potentially pivotal Canadian data in the form of GDP and retail sales. Meanwhile, the single currency continues to mirror Dollar moves and perhaps respect more technical/flow-related levels with another fade ahead of 1.1500 and the 100 DMA at 1.1482 culminating in a drift back towards 1.1400 where 1.4 bn expiries reside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both holding up relatively well, if not quite bucking the overall trend, although the Jpy is displaying its characteristic greater allure in risk-off climes and trades near the top of a 111.05-45 range. Cable is also pretty restrained between 1.2700-1.2645, with a raft of UK data largely shrugged off in the Brexit hiatus and consolidation in vogue before Xmas and New Year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scandi Crowns are somewhat mixed as Eur/Sek rebounds from post-Riksbank rate hike lows and a key chart level at 10.2400 even though Swedish retail sales were firmer than forecast, while Eur/Nok has eased back from near 9.9500 highs and the Norwegian Krona sees some respite from the ongoing rout in oil.</p>\r\n",

The 10 year benchmark subsequently registered a marginal new high at 123.14 vs Thursday&rsquo;s 123.30 settlement alongside Bunds that bounced off 163.28 (-28 ticks on the day) and is now consolidating ahead of multi domestic data releases including the last Q3 GDP revision, current account balance and last month&rsquo;s public sector finance balances. Meanwhile, the Short Sterling strip is also hovering above worst levels and currently flat to 1.5 ticks adrift, with Brexit on the back-burner for a change given Parliament recess and the debating starts all over again in earnest from January 9 through to the meaningful vote on the 15th of next month.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac stocks are lower across the board as the global stock rout continues into the region following the losses in US amid fears of a government shutdown. The DJIA posted a fifth consecutive day in the red as the index fell to a 14-month low, while the Nasdaq briefly dipped into bear market territory amid weakness in Amazon and Apple and the S&amp;P printed its sixth day of back-to-back losses. ASX 200 (-1.3%) hovers at a two-year low as the index is pressured by financial names as the &ldquo;Big Four&rdquo; banks sit firmly in the red. Meanwhile, Nikkei 225 (-1.6%) falls deeper into bear market as regional shares are poised for the worst week since October, with downside exacerbated by the firmer JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) opened with firm losses and extended the decline amid the soured risk sentiment with all sectors in Hong Kong in the red, while Mainland China suffered from losses in financials and real estate names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets have quietened amid a sparse overnight calendar, the DXY trades within a narrow range after the prior day&rsquo;s continued weakness and EUR/USD holds on to most its recent gains with the pair hovering around 1.1450, ahead of its 100 DMA at 1.1484. GBP/USD is flat around 1.2650 after moving in tandem with the USD, with Brexit starting to fade away with the UK Parliament now on Christmas recess (20th Dec to 7th Jan) and Brexit debates to restart on Jan 9th; according to House of Commons leader Leadsom. &nbsp;Elsewhere, USD/JPY continues to be dictated by the risk sentiment as the pair briefly dipped below 111.00 before testing its 200 DMA to the downside at around 110.90.</p>\r\n",
