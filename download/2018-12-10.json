The PM will return to Brussels, ahead of the EU Summit later this week, to seek reassurance that the backstop will not be indefinite, which appears to be a major source of concern among MPs. European Council President Tusk said the deal, including the backstop, will not be renegotiated but stands ready to discuss how it can facilitate UK ratification. TD Securities notes that reassurance could come in the form of a non-binding legal opinion issued by the EU Commission stating the backstop cannot be permanent under Article 50; a letter by the UK and Irish governments on possible alternatives on the backstop arrangements; a vote in parliament on the implementation of a backstop. There is no set timing on when the vote will be delayed to as this will depend on negotiations while PM pledged MPs they will have a say on her deal by January 21st, the latest possible date a deal can be put to parliament. A source suggested the vote could take place in early January while Conservatives and Labour MPs pressured the PM to have a say before Christmas. Looking ahead, HSBC predicts three possible outcomes 1) PM May could call a vote of no confidence or one could arise if 48 letters are submitted to the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs 2) PM May could lose the no confidence vote or resign leading to a leadership context which might not solve the issue and delay the negotiating process 3) MPs could take control of the process from the current government, after the so-called Grieve amendment was approved by the parliament last week, opening the door to a possible second referendum, an extension of Article 50, a Norway option or a no deal exit. Elsewhere, the ECJ voted this morning that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50, without consulting the other member states. In later comments, UK Opposition Leader Corbyn announced the Labour party will not table a no confidence motion prior to the Brexit vote. According to TD Securities the likelihood is &ldquo;that the deadlock will need to be broken by the general public, be it via a general election or a second referendum&rdquo; warning that a late-February election could happen if called in the first half of January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> The US is to issue an anti-dumping order on Chinese aluminium alloy sheets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Ahead of Wednesday, when PM Conte may present the revised budget to the EU, EU Commissioner Dombrovskis warned that time is very limited for Italians to make any substantial changes to the 2019 budget while EU&rsquo;s Moscovici stated that the country has been showing more willingness to cooperate as talks continue though he is preparing the next steps for a possible disciplinary procedure against Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 1.61 LOWER AT USD 51.00/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 1.70 LOWER AT USD 59.97/BBL.</strong> Optimism from the OPEC+ deal at the tail end of the week has faded, and crude was defensive on Monday amid equities sliding, the DXY up. &quot;The market is also continuing to digest the impact of the OPEC+ production cuts announced on Friday, with at least some significant slice of market participants unconvinced that a floor for prices has been established,&quot; Citi said. However, others were more optimistic: &quot;The agreement is bullish for oil, first because it is a strong signal from OPEC that they are willing to step in to defend the oil price, and second because a cut of the magnitude agreed pushes global supply/demand from a surplus of ~500kb/d into a 700kb/d deficit (based on October levels and a call on OPEC of 32.4mb/d).&quot; UBS said. UBS believes the recent slide in oil prices has been more a function of sour sentiment over the last couple of months, and argues that the OPEC+ agreement is bullish both from a fundamental and a sentiment perspective. &quot;Together with data last week showing a falling US rig count and a decline in US crude inventories, sentiment may be poised for a swing into bullish territory,&quot; the bank adds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;SPX +0.17% at 2628, NDX +1.05% at 6683, DJI +0.14% at 24423. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -1.62%, Materials +0.28%, Industrials +0.25%, Cons Discretionary +0.13%, Cons Staples +0.01%, Healthcare +0.32%, Financials -1.41%, Tech +1.42%, Telecoms +0.74%, Utilities +0.30%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Qualcomm (QCOM) opened higher after winning a preliminary court hearing in China, over claims Apple (AAPL) had stolen IP from it, Apple in turn opened lower following the ruling that China. Chipmakers (NVDA, INTC, AVGO, AMD) broke out of a 3-day losing streak. Defence stocks (LMT, NOC, RTN) outperformed after a new spending bill was announced from the Trump administration. Facebook (FB) announced an additional USD 9bln share repurchase programme pushing it higher on the open. PayPal (PYPL) traded higher following positive comments from UBS and Barron&rsquo;s magazine. As oil retraced some of its gains from the end of last week, energy stocks (XOM, OXY, SLB, EOG, PSX, COP) fell too. FedEx (FDX) opened lower following a downgrade at BoAML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 2+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-22.</strong> Treasuries ended Monday&rsquo;s session lower as equities rebounded and pared back some of their losses. The complex hit session highs at the European close on confirmation that PM May will delay Tuesday&rsquo;s Brexit vote in parliament, before edging lower ahead of this week&rsquo;s supply. Most of the action was concentrated in the front end of the curve were yields were higher by c1bps at settlement. 2s30s and 5s30s were narrower by c.3bps while 2s5s widened by less than 1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 3-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 38bln of 3-year notes (Tues), USD 24bln of 10-year notes (Wed) and USD 16bln of 30-year bonds (Thu). Analysts have suggested that demand at 3-year auctions has not kept up pace with the rising auction sizes. Barclays points out that bid-to-cover ratios have been trending lower in recent auction cycles (falling from 3.1x at the start of the year, to 2.5x at the previous auction; tail sizes have also been of note; in the first half of the year, 3-year auctions stopped through by 0.1bps on average, though in the second half of the year, has seen an average tail size of 0.3bps. Barclays also observes that direct bidder participation has also declined, falling to near post-crisis lows. &ldquo;This was largely due to a smaller takedown from domestic investors, falling from 42% in October to 35% in November,&rdquo; Barclays says, &ldquo;broker dealers have had to take down more in recent months.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Sterling has endured yet another whip-saw session, as the UK government confirmed Tuesday&rsquo;s meaningful vote has been called off. Cable finished the US session just off 1.2600 and a new ytd low circa 1.2606, while Eur/Gbp almost reached 0.9050 before pulling back just ahead of chart resistance around 0.9052, with the Pound sharply reversing from early peaks printed when the ECJ delivered its verdict on Article 50 in line with recommendations from a top EU legal advisor allowing the UK unilateral rights to revoke the withdrawal process. Note, broadly weaker than forecast data hardly helped the Gbp, but in truth it was all about the scheduled December 11 Parliament vote that looked set to be on even though the withdrawal agreement was widely anticipated to fail, but now seems destined for a delay to allow May more time to negotiate with the EU on the back-stop terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>Mixed fortunes for the non-US Dollars, as the Aussie and Kiwi managed to recover overnight losses made on the back of weaker than forecast Chinese imports and exports, but the Loonie lost ground alongside oil prices and failed to derive any support from better than expected Canadian housing data (starts and permits). Aud/Usd is slipped just below 0.7200 and the Kiwi under 0.6900 as Aud/Nzd meanders midway between 1.0455-1.0500 on the wide. However, Usd/Cad is back above 1.3400 having traded well below 1.3300 after last Friday&rsquo;s contrasting Canadian and US employment reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> A gradual grind down from 112.25 to just under 113.00 for the Jpy after revised Q3 GDP revealed a steeper contraction in the Japanese economy than initially reported; the pair rebounded firmly above 113.00. Moreover, techs and option-related flows also underpinned the headline pair with a key Fib at 112.46 effectively splitting decent interest (1+ bn) from 112.40-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, CHF: </strong>Both showing relative resilience as the broad Usd rebounded from post-NFP lows (DXY extending gains above 97.100), with the single currency back towards 1.1350 and the Franc pivoting 0.9900 as Eur/Chf slipped from just over 1.1300 towards 1.1265 ahead of the next Italian budget presentation to Brussels (scheduled for Wednesday).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>A bearish start to the week for most regional currencies amidst ongoing US-China trade concerns, as Usd/Cnh rebounded through 6.9000, Usd/Zar extended gains above 14.0000 and Usd/Try climbed above 5.3000 a significant miss on Q3 Turkish GDP.</p>\r\n",

However, others were more optimistic: &quot;The agreement is bullish for oil, first because it is a strong signal from OPEC that they are willing to step in to defend the oil price, and second because a cut of the magnitude agreed pushes global supply/demand from a surplus of ~500kb/d into a 700kb/d deficit (based on October levels and a call on OPEC of 32.4mb/d).&quot; UBS said. UBS believes the recent slide in oil prices has been more a function of sour sentiment over the last couple of months, and argues that the OPEC+ agreement is bullish both from a fundamental and a sentiment perspective. &quot;Together with data last week showing a falling US rig count and a decline in US crude inventories, sentiment may be poised for a swing into bullish territory,&quot; the bank adds.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling has endured yet another whip-saw session, and is approaching official statements from UK PM May, House of Commons head Leadsom and Brexit Secretary Barclay (from 15.30GMT) under heavy selling pressure in anticipation of confirmation that Tuesday&rsquo;s meaningful vote has been called off. Cable is currently just off 1.2600 and a new ytd low circa 1.2606, while Eur/Gbp almost reached 0.9050 before pulling back just ahead of chart resistance around 0.9052, with the Pound sharply reversing from early peaks printed when the ECJ delivered its verdict on Article 50 in line with recommendations from a top EU legal advisor allowing the UK unilateral rights to revoke the withdrawal process. Note, broadly weaker than forecast data hardly helped the Gbp, but in truth it was all about the scheduled December 11 Parliament vote that looked set to be on even though the withdrawal agreement was widely anticipated to fail, but now seems destined for a delay to allow May more time to negotiate with the EU on the back-stop terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed fortunes for the non-US Dollars, as the Ausie and Kiwi managed to recover overnight losses made on the back of weaker than forecast Chinese imports and exports, but the Loonie lost ground alongside oil prices and failed to derive any support from better than expected Canadian housing data (starts and permits). Aud/Usd is holding just above 0.7200 and the Kiwi is keeping tabs on 0.6900 as Aud/Nzd meanders midway between 1.0455-1.0500 on the wide. However, Usd/Cad is back above 1.3350 having traded well below 1.3300 after last Friday&rsquo;s contrasting Canadian and US employment reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A gradual grind down from 112.25 to just under 113.00 for the Jpy after revised Q3 GDP revealed a steeper contraction in the Japanese economy than initially reported. Moreover, techs and option-related flows also underpinned the headline pair with a key Fib at 112.46 effectively splitting decent interest (1+ bn) from 112.40-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both showing relative resilience as the broad Usd rebounded from post-NFP lows (DXY nudging towards 96.900 vs 96.358 at worst), with the single currency surviving a sub-1.1400 test, albeit in sympathy in Cable, and the Franc pivoting 0.9900 as Eur/Chf slipped from just over 1.1300 towards 1.1265 ahead of the next Italian budget presentation to Brussels (scheduled for Wednesday).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bearish start to the week for most regional currencies amidst ongoing US-China trade concerns, as Usd/Cnh rebounded through 6.9000, Usd/Zar extended gains above 14.0000 and Usd/Try climbed above 5.3000 following a significant miss on Q3 Turkish GDP.</p>\r\n",

Hence, heightened uncertainty and if an adjournment is confirmed at 15.30GMT then simply more uncertainty for even longer, which has given Gilts more impetus to set a marginal new contract best at 123.84, +48 ticks, while Short Sterling futures have been 4 ticks ahead and the Pound extended losses, to a fresh 2018 low at 1.2640 vs the Usd and hit 0.9035 on the Eur cross.</p>\r\n",

Over in Germany, DAX (-0.5%) is hampered by shares in heavyweight BASF (-4.9%) after the Co. significantly lowered their 2018 EBIT forecasts. Major sectors are largely in the red, with underperformance seen in materials in the wake of softer-than-expected Chinese CPI alongside further strain on US-China trade relations after the Huawei CFO is to face prosecution in the US for fraud charges as China demands her release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable movers include technology names such as Dialog Semiconductor (-2.5%) who are in the red in sympathy with poor performance in tech names overnight in Asia, while Standard Chartered (-1.5%) declined amid reports that the Co. was amongst the banks who have been misled by Huawei.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP,EUR&nbsp; &ndash; More volatile trade for the Pound amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty with all eyes on the 11.30GMT Cabinet conference call where Minister are now assuming PM May will delay the meaningful vote due to wide anticipation that the deal will be rejected in Parliament. GBP/USD currently languishing below 1.2700 ahead of the recently-made YTD low of 1.2657 having seen some reprieve following the ECJ ruling that the UK can unilaterally reverse Brexit without consulting the EU27 members. However, the upside was short-lived ahead of UK data which was weaker overall, with industrial productions considerably weaker than forecasts. Meanwhile, EUR benefits from the softer buck and pound with EUR/GBP near the top of a 0.8988-57 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK, SEK &ndash; Stronger than expected Norwegian inflation data just ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s Norges Bank interest rate decision, weighed on EUR/NOK with the pair making a substantial move sub-9.7000 post-data with a low print of around 9.6500, before paring back a fraction of the move to stabilise around 9.6700. Conversely, further political angst in Sweden after the Centre party leader Loof noted that talks with Social Democrats have failed, adding they will not support their leader Leader Lofven as PM. This subsequently (alongside the NOK/SEK spillover) pushed EUR/SEK to session highs north of 10.3350 vs. a low print of 10.2973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Moving in tandem with swings in risk sentiment more so than the wider-than-expected contraction in Japanese Q3 GDP, with USD/JPY currently nearer the highs of a 112.75-25 range with the downside contained&nbsp; by big options (1.13bln at 112.40-50) and a fib at 112.46.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMs &ndash; USD/CNY rose to just shy of 6.9150 in the wake of lower-than-expected inflation data alongside continuous US pressure after US Trade Representative Lightizer solidified the 90-day negotiating period as &ldquo;a hard deadline&rdquo; with new tariffs imposed by March 1st should the parties not reach an agreement. Meanwhile, TRY has largely recovered from the miss in Turkish GDP with USD/TRY clipping 5.3000 post-data before edging lower to around 5.2800. Elsewhere, ZAR is on the backfoot on a more technical note as traders cite the USD/ZAR breach above 14.2000 as the catalyst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Still on the backfoot, albeit off worst levels, in a continuation of the move following Friday&rsquo;s NFP miss with the index and broad dollar closer to the top of a 96.684-358 range and awaiting more impetus data in the form of JOLTS and employment trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; Antipodeans deriving support from their softer US counterpart having initially wobbled on weaker Chinese trade data overnight. Kiwi hovers just below 0.6900 as the AUD/NZD remains capped ahead of 1.0500 and AUD/USD struggles to hold above 0.7200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts were essentially unreactive to the disappointing UK output data and in-line GDP data, trading at the top of a 123.40-123.71 range with the UK benchmark driven mixed reports of the possible delay on Tuesday&rsquo;s meaningful, with some support found from stock weakness. Bunds have broken the key 163.17 support level to the downside and hover around the 163.10 level vs. 163.02 at worst as technical factors have taken hold of the benchmark. This has squeezed the in-focus OAT-Bund spread, that has widened to over 40bps (double that of a month ago) with widening driven by the yellowjacket protests that have lowered the Bank of France&rsquo;s GDP forecast by 10 bps, as investors look ahead to President Macron&rsquo;s speech at 7pm. BTPs are outperforming and testing 124.00 to the upside post lower-house budgetary approval and strong output data, as reports circulate that PM Conte is reportedly seeking a 2% level with Tria looking for 1.9% ahead of&nbsp; top-level talks today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasuries are essentially flat as yields hang above the 2.85% with support found at 2.78-80% as traders look forward to the JOLTS data and supply on the short end in the form of USD 39bln in 13-week bills and USD 36bln in 26-week bills later in the day</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.0%) and WTI (-1.3%) have retreated somewhat from gains seen after Friday&rsquo;s agreement by OPEC+ to cut output by 1.2mln BPD from October levels for 6 months, with the deal to be reviewed in April. Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that Russia is to cut production by 228,000 BPD as part of this agreement. Separately, sources have commented that congress is increasingly likely to vote on the NOPEC bill, which will allow the DoJ to sue OPEC on anti-trust violations. Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s NOC has declared a force majeure following a production suspension at the Sharara oil field due to safety concerns because of protestors at the oil field; which will result in a 315k BPD production cut, while Zawiya refinery is also at risk due to its dependence on the Sharara field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (Unch) has remained steady following Friday&rsquo;s NFP miss which led to some speculation that the Fed may halt interest rates hikes sooner than was previously expected. Elsewhere, a Chinese government consultancy expects 2018 crude steel output to hit an annual record of 923mln tonnes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraq oil Minister Ghadhban says that the county&#39;s oil exports have improved after November&#39;s drop in exports due to bad weather</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/20736/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European bourses are red across the board (Euro Stoxx 50 -0.3%) with the FTSE 100 (-0.1%) outperforming its peers amid currency effects (with the ongoing Brexit turmoil) and a boost by BAE Systems (+0.8%) following the Co. being shortlisted to build the next Royal Navy frigates. Over in Germany, DAX (-0.5%) is hampered by shares in heavyweight BASF (-4.9%) after the Co. significantly lowered their 2018 EBIT forecasts. Major sectors are largely in the red, with underperformance seen in materials in the wake of softer-than-expected Chinese CPI alongside further strain on US-China trade relations after the Huawei CFO is to face prosecution in the US for fraud charges as China demands her release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable movers include technology names such as Dialog Semiconductor (-2.5%) who are in the red in sympathy with poor performance in tech names overnight in Asia, while Standard Chartered (-1.5%) declined amid reports that the Co. was amongst the banks who have been misled by Huawei.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP,EUR&nbsp; &ndash; More volatile trade for the Pound amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty with all eyes on the 11.30GMT Cabinet conference call where Minister are now assuming PM May will delay the meaningful vote due to wide anticipation that the deal will be rejected in Parliament. GBP/USD currently hovering around 1.2700 ahead of the recently-made YTD low of 1.2657 having seen some reprieve following the ECJ ruling that the UK can unilaterally reverse Brexit without consulting the EU27 members. However, the upside was short-lived ahead of UK data which was weaker overall, with industrial productions considerably weaker than forecasts. Meanwhile, EUR benefits from the softer buck and pound with EUR/GBP near the top of a 0.8988-57 range.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK, SEK &ndash; Stronger than expected Norwegian inflation data just ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s Norges Bank interest rate decision, weighed on EUR/NOK with the pair making a substantial move sub-9.7000 post-data with a low print of around 9.6500, before paring back a fraction of the move to stabilise around 9.6700. Conversely, further political angst in Sweden after the Centre party leader Loof noted that talks with Social Democrats have failed, adding they will not support their leader Leader Lofven as PM. This subsequently (alongside the NOK/SEK spillover) pushed EUR/SEK to session highs north of 10.3350 vs. a low print of 10.2973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Moving in tandem with swings in risk sentiment more so than the wider-than-expected contraction in Japanese Q3 GDP, with USD/JPY currently nearer the highs of a 112.75-25 range with the downside contained&nbsp; by big options (1.13bln at 112.40-50) and a fib at 112.46.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMs &ndash; USD/CNY rose to just shy of 6.9150 in the wake of lower-than-expected inflation data alongside continuous US pressure after US Trade Representative Lightizer solidified the 90-day negotiating period as &ldquo;a hard deadline&rdquo; with new tariffs imposed by March 1st should the parties not reach an agreement. Meanwhile, TRY has largely recovered from the miss in Turkish GDP with USD/TRY clipping 5.3000 post-data before edging lower to around 5.2800. Elsewhere, ZAR is on the backfoot on a more technical note as traders cite the USD/ZAR breach above 14.2000 as the catalyst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Still on the backfoot, albeit off worst levels, in a continuation of the move following Friday&rsquo;s NFP miss with the index and broad dollar closer to the top of a 96.684-358 range and awaiting more impetus data in the form of JOLTS and employment trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; Antipodeans deriving support from their softer US counterpart having initially wobbled on weaker Chinese trade data overnight. Kiwi hovers just below 0.6900 as the AUD/NZD remains capped ahead of 1.0500 and AUD/USD struggles to hold above 0.7200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts were essentially unreactive to the disappointing UK output data and in-line GDP data, trading in the middle of a 21-tick range between 123.40 and 123.61 with the UK benchmark driven by Brexit jitters ahead of the key conference call at 11:30am amid suggestions the meaningful vote may be delayed, with some support found from stock weakness. Bunds have broken the key 163.17 support level to the downside and hover around the 163.10 level vs. 163.02 at worst as technical factors have taken hold of the benchmark. This has squeezed the in-focus OAT-Bund spread, that has widened to over 40bps (double that of a month ago) with widening driven by the yellowjacket protests that have lowered the Bank of France&rsquo;s GDP forecast by 10 bps, as investors look ahead to President Macron&rsquo;s speech at 7pm. BTPs are outperforming and testing 124.00 to the upside post lower-house budgetary approval and strong output data, as reports circulate that PM Conte is reportedly seeking a 2% level with Tria looking for 1.9% ahead of&nbsp; top-level talks today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasuries are essentially flat as yields hang above the 2.85% with support found at 2.78-80% as traders look forward to the JOLTS data and supply on the short end in the form of USD 39bln in 13-week bills and USD 36bln in 26-week bills later in the day</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.0%) and WTI (-1.3%) have retreated somewhat from gains seen after Friday&rsquo;s agreement by OPEC+ to cut output by 1.2mln BPD from October levels for 6 months, with the deal to be reviewed in April. Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that Russia is to cut production by 228,000 BPD as part of this agreement. Separately, sources have commented that congress is increasingly likely to vote on the NOPEC bill, which will allow the DoJ to sue OPEC on anti-trust violations. Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s NOC has declared a force majeure following a production suspension at the Sharara oil field due to safety concerns because of protestors at the oil field; which will result in a 315k BPD production cut, while Zawiya refinery is also at risk due to its dependence on the Sharara field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (Unch) has remained steady following Friday&rsquo;s NFP miss which led to some speculation that the Fed may halt interest rates hikes sooner than was previously expected. Elsewhere, a Chinese government consultancy expects 2018 crude steel output to hit an annual record of 923mln tonnes</p>\r\n",

BTPs are outperforming and testing 124.00 to the upside post lower-house budgetary approval and strong output data, as reports circulate that PM Conte is reportedly seeking a 2% level with Tria looking for 1.9% ahead of &nbsp;top-level talks today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasuries are essentially flat as yields hang above the 2.85% with support found at 2.78-80% as traders look forward to the JOLTS data and supply on the short end in the form of USD 39bln in 13-week bills and USD 36bln in 26-week bills later in the day</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP,EUR </strong>&nbsp;&ndash; More volatile trade for the Pound amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty with all eyes on the 11.30GMT Cabinet conference call where Minister are now assuming PM May will delay the meaningful vote due to wide anticipation that the deal will be rejected in Parliament. GBP/USD currently hovering around 1.2700 ahead of the recently-made YTD low of 1.2657 having seen some reprieve following the ECJ ruling that the UK can unilaterally reverse Brexit without consulting the EU27 members. However, the upside was short-lived ahead of UK data which was weaker overall, with industrial productions considerably weaker than forecasts. Meanwhile, EUR benefits from the softer buck and pound with EUR/GBP near the top of a 0.8988-57 range.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOK, SEK </strong>&ndash; Stronger than expected Norwegian inflation data just ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s Norges Bank interest rate decision, weighed on EUR/NOK with the pair making a substantial move sub-9.7000 post-data with a low print of around 9.6500, before paring back a fraction of the move to stabilise around 9.6700. Conversely, further political angst in Sweden after the Centre party leader Loof noted that talks with Social Democrats have failed, adding they will not support their leader Leader Lofven as PM. This subsequently (alongside the NOK/SEK spillover) pushed EUR/SEK to session highs north of 10.3350 vs. a low print of 10.2973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY </strong>&ndash; Moving in tandem with swings in risk sentiment more so than the wider-than-expected contraction in Japanese Q3 GDP, with USD/JPY currently nearer the highs of a 112.75-25 range with the downside contained &nbsp;by big options (1.13bln at 112.40-50) and a fib at 112.46.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EMs </strong>&ndash; USD/CNY rose to just shy of 6.9150 in the wake of lower-than-expected inflation data alongside continuous US pressure after US Trade Representative Lightizer solidified the 90-day negotiating period as &ldquo;a hard deadline&rdquo; with new tariffs imposed by March 1st should the parties not reach an agreement. Meanwhile, TRY has largely recovered from the miss in Turkish GDP with USD/TRY clipping 5.3000 post-data before edging lower to around 5.2800. Elsewhere, ZAR is on the backfoot on a more technical note as traders cite the USD/ZAR breach above 14.2000 as the catalyst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY </strong>&ndash; Still on the backfoot, albeit off worst levels, in a continuation of the move following Friday&rsquo;s NFP miss with the index and broad dollar closer to the top of a 96.684-358 range and awaiting more impetus data in the form of JOLTS and employment trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, NZD </strong>&ndash; Antipodeans deriving support from their softer US counterpart having initially wobbled on weaker Chinese trade data overnight. Kiwi hovers just below 0.6900 as the AUD/NZD remains capped ahead of 1.0500 and AUD/USD struggles to hold above 0.7200.</p>\r\n",

The latter briefly boosted the Gbp and weighed on Gilts (Cable up to circa 1.2760 and bonds down to 123.40), but the 3 month strip retains an underlying bid (1-2 ticks above parity) ahead of a relatively busy domestic docket for a Monday, and more importantly tomorrow&rsquo;s key Brexit vote. Note, BoE&rsquo;s Cunliffe is scheduled to speak today, but after hours and the event does not look likely to yield anything on the policy or economic front.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (-2.3%) was led lower by tech and financials to print lows last seen in around 2 years, while Nikkei 225 (-2.1%) was pressured by a firmer JPY and larger than expected downward revision to Q3 GDP which had already been in contraction territory. Hang Seng (-1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) were also negative after Chinese Exports and Imports data fell short of estimates and amid concerns regarding US-China trade tensions. This was after USTR Lighthizer declared the 90-days was a &#39;hard deadline&#39; for China, while there were also reports China&rsquo;s Vice Foreign Minister summoned the US and Canadian Ambassadors to China regarding the arrest of Huawei&rsquo;s CFO and warned of consequences if she is not immediately released. Finally, 10yr JGBs were underpinned by safe-haven demand and with the BoJ also present in the market for a respectable JPY 1.2tln of JGBs with 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week mostly lower following last Friday&#39;s sell-off on Wall St and Non-Farm Payrolls miss, with sentiment also dampened by disappointing Japanese GDP and Chinese trade data, as well as uncertainty regarding US-China trade relations. ASX 200 (-2.0%) declined from the open and hit lows last seen in around 2 years with tech and financials leading the downside, while Nikkei 225 (-2.2%) is pressured by a firmer JPY and larger than expected downward revision to Q3 GDP which had already been in contraction territory. Hang Seng (-1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) have also declined after Chinese Exports and Imports data fell short of estimates and amid concerns regarding US-China trade tensions. This was after USTR Lighthizer declared the 90-days was a &#39;hard deadline&#39; for China, while there were also reports China&rsquo;s Vice Foreign Minister summoned the US and Canadian Ambassadors to China regarding the arrest of Huawei&rsquo;s CFO and warned of consequences if she is not immediately released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is softer in a continuation of the weakness from the US job data miss which added to recent discouraging releases and supports the case for the Fed to take a time out after a 4th hike later this month. This helped its major counterparts recover from the early pressure that saw EUR/USD initially decline below the 1.1400 handle on opening jitters and in which GBP/USD had briefly tested support at 1.2700 ahead of PM May&rsquo;s crunch Brexit deal vote tomorrow. Elsewhere, antipodeans also began downbeat with AUD/USD retreating below 0.7200 in the aftermath of the weak Chinese Imports and Exports figures but then recovered in tandem with the broad softness in the greenback, while USD/JPY underperforms as the risk averse tone spurs flows into safe-haven JPY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher on safe-haven demand and with the BoJ also present in the market for a respectable JPY 1.2tln of JGBs with 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",
