Friday&rsquo;s gains being led by healthcare. The defensive utilities sector was the laggard, but still green. Stock futures largely looked through the softer than expected US advanced GDP print for Q4, and instead took their cue from earnings. Solid earnings from Intel on Thursday helped boost tech stocks; Intel shares were up around 10% to 17-year highs and received a host of broker upgrades. Elsewhere on the earnings slate, Abbvie reported top- and bottom-line beat and raised guidance, and the story was similar for Honeywell. Colgate-Palmolive was more in-line with forecasts, while Nextera beat on EPS, but posted a small revenue miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields were higher on Friday, with the underperformance mostly in the belly of the curve.

The dollar was given some reprieve after US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s comments on Thursday (which were on the face of it, contrary to the comments of his Treasury Secretary) when he expressed a desire for a &ldquo;strong dollar&rdquo;. However, he said that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin&rsquo;s comments were apparently &ldquo;even handed&rdquo; and that where the buck is in the short-term was not a concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR again took advantage of the dollar weakness, but failed to test the post-ECB highs printed on Thursday, with price action capped by the 1.25 handle. Next week the docket is packed full of ECB speakers (Coeure, Lautenschlager, Praet, Mersch) that will put into perspective the ECB&rsquo;s latest meeting. Yesterday, sources stories suggested that the ECB remains split about its next move, and the immediate debate centres around when the ECB will amend its forward guidance (March seems to be the consensus).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yen, meanwhile, was among the top performers in the G10 space after BOJ Governor Kuroda again said that he expects only moderate economic growth, and inflation expectations were rising slightly. The comments sent USDJPY to visit the 108.50 mark, and were clearly misinterpreted by the market; later in the session, a BOJ released a statement saying that the governor&rsquo;s comments were not a revision of his views, prompting the yen to retreat to 109.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other havens were bid on USD weakness, and gold continued its rise, settling above $1,350, but the yellow metal didn&rsquo;t manage to test weekly highs around $1,366.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling was lingering around the 1.42 mark, but has backed away from highs against the EUR, despite newsflow over the last couple of days suggesting that Europeans may be more open to a flexible approach to Brexit, including flexibility over the transitional period. On the data front, GDP growth was encouraging, and at 1.8% in 2017, is four times the level most analysts were forecasting after the Brexit referendum. In late US trade, the greenback found some strength, contributing to GBP weaknesss, and pushing cable down towards the 1.4150 area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD advanced against the buck; although CPI fell, we are still knocking around the midpoint of the BOC tolerance band, and all three BOC metrics suggested that the inflationary landscape is firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk504673747\">COMMODITIES</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI futures settle 63 cents higher at USD 66.14 per barrel, Brent futures settle 10 cents higher at USD 70.52 per barrel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Brent and WTI are rounding off a solid week, rising between 3% and 4%. There was no specific, meaningful crude related news explaining Friday&rsquo;s gains, and analysts were content to attribute the rise to stronger stocks, a firmer dollar. Oil drillers added 12 rigs, according to Baker Hughes, the most since March, and the second rise in three weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh stated that output declined in some oil fields due to lack of resources and added that Iran will seek lower production in coming years if it cannot be fixed.
