With volatility easing slightly, carry trades &ndash; which have been battered in 2018 &ndash; were once again in vogue, helping the likes of AUDJPY and NZDJPY rally by around 1.25%. The price action in EUR was fairly narrow (range 1.2304 to 1.2377) considering the bounce after Nowotny&rsquo;s comments; there were reports of offers through 1.2350 to 1.2400 which prevented price action from reaching the 1.24 level. Comments from hawkish BOE member McCafferty helped GBP rise, though 1.42 is proving elusive.

There were some negative ticks in PM trade after an ECB spokesperson walked back from hawkish comments made earlier in the session by Nowotny, which saw Bunds bid, Treasuries rise in sympathy, putting pressure on the equity complex and seeing gains pared. However, while stocks were higher, futures were traversing sideways for much of the US session, with ES straddling 2650, only making moves above that area in late trade. In stock specifics, autos were bid after China&rsquo;s Business Journal stated the country is considering cutting import duties on cars by half, with all major names closing green, led by Tesla (TSLA). M&amp;A news today in pre-market saw Verifone (PAY) be acquired by Francisco Partners for $3.4bln which saw PAY rise over 51%. During trading hours WSJ reported Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) started off deal talks again, which was followed by higher spikes in both companies, as well as AT&amp;T (T), Time Warner (TWX) and Verizon (VZ), however cell tower stocks such as Crown Castle (CCI), SBA Communications (SBAC) and American Tower (AMT) spiked lower and closed the day in the red. In late trade, tech was in focus as Facebook&rsquo;s (FB) CEO Zuckerberg testified to lawmakers; there was little by way of new information, though tech and FB itself had an upside bias.&nbsp; Shares traded higher throughout most the testimony but came off highs as Zuckerberg stated there will always be a free version of Facebook. SPX +1.67% at 2657, NDX +2.2% at 6616, DJI +1.8% at 24409.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bear-flattening was the theme, with short-end yields higher by around 3bps, while the longer-end of the curve was more or less unchanged at settlement. President Xi&rsquo;s speech overnight was the catalyst, helping to drive decent overnight volumes. However, as we entered the European day, the tplex was happy to range trade, with 10-year T-Notes patrolling the 120-24 to 120-29 bracket. There was some attention on the 5s30s part of the curve, which flattened to the narrowest since 2007. In the late part of the European afternoon, Treasuries were for a short while dictated by Bund action, which caught a bid after the ECB backtracked from Nowotny&rsquo;s hawkish comments, made earlier in the day. However, the effect was short lived. The US sold $30bln of 3yr notes, which tailed by 0.1bps, with the yield the highest at auction since May 2007. Cover was more-or-less in line with recent averages, though indirect participation dropped to the lowest since September; dealers took the most since September 2017. This week&rsquo;s $64bln of 3s/10s/30s will see a net paydown of around $12.5bln by the US Treasury, given the $74.5bln of maturities at the mid-month settlement. US 10y T-notes futs settled down 4+ ticks at 120-24+.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 10 April 2018: Easing trade war concerns buoy risk sentiment  ",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT:</strong><strong> </strong>Stocks up, USD lower, treasuries lower, oil higher<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW: </strong>President XI conciliatory comments, Hawkish Nowotny, Hawkish McCafferty, US PPI<br /><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>RBA Governor Lowe to speak (Overnight), China CPI (Overnight), US CPI (Weds), Fed Minutes (Weds)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS:</strong> The risk tone was more constructive on Tuesday after overnight comments from China President Xi signalled that China would continue to open-up its economy. Later in the session, China&rsquo;s Business Journal reported that the country was considering cutting auto import tariffs by 50% (taking to around 12.5%), which was welcomed by US President Trump, although the White House said that while it was encouraged by China&rsquo;s moves, it wants to see concrete action. Trade war fears eased slightly, which helped risk assets to rally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> There seems to be a growing consensus towards the idea that the US is preparing military action in Syria over the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. The Trump administration is yet to make a final decision on action, the White House said, with an announcement likely to come within 48 hours. Elsewhere, chemical weapons watchdog OPCW said it would send a fact-finding mission to the Douma region of Syria. The US was attempting for a UN Security Council vote, though Russia vetoed the manoeuvre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CENTRAL BANK SPEAK:</strong> ECB hawk <strong>Nowotny</strong> on Tuesday said the ECB could lift the deposit rate by 20bps to -0.20% to begin the process of rate hikes, the first phase, before then raising the refi rate. The reaction was predictably hawkish, resulting in an ECB spokesperson to later clarify Nowotny&rsquo;s comments, saying that those were his own views, not those of the Governing Council. Fed non-voter<strong> Kaplan</strong> reiterated his view of three hikes in 2018, data-dependent. Kaplan also expects inflation to gradually move towards target. BOE hawk <strong>McCafferty</strong> again called for the central bank to &ldquo;not dally&rdquo; over raising rates, arguing that no slack remains in the labour market, while wages have begun ticking higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX +1.67% at 2657, NDX +2.2% at 6616, DJI +1.8% at 24409 SECTORS: CONS CYC (XLY): +1.15%, CONS NON-CYC (XLP): +0.53%, ENERGY (XLE): +3.42%, FINANCIALS (XLF): +1.28%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +1.78%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): +1.66%, MATERIALS (XLB): +2.16%, TECH (XLK): +2.52%, TELECOMS (XTL): +2.32%, UTLITIES (XLU): -0.71%. </strong>US Equity futures were buoyed by an improved risk sentiment following China President Xi&rsquo;s speech overnight. There were some negative ticks in PM trade after an ECB spokesperson walked back from hawkish comments made earlier in the session by Nowotny, which saw Bunds bid, Treasuries rise in sympathy, putting pressure on the equity complex and seeing gains pared. However, while stocks were higher, futures were traversing sideways for much of the US session, with ES straddling 2650, only making moves above that area in late trade.<strong> </strong>In stock specifics, autos were bid after China&rsquo;s Business Journal stated the country is considering cutting import duties on cars by half, with all major names closing green, led by Tesla (TSLA). M&amp;A news today in pre-market saw Verifone (PAY) be acquired by Francisco Partners for $3.4bln which saw PAY rise over 51%. During trading hours WSJ reported Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) started off deal talks again, which was followed by higher spikes in both companies, as well as AT&amp;T (T), Time Warner (TWX) and Verizon (VZ), however cell tower stocks such as Crown Castle (CCI), SBA Communications (SBAC) and American Tower (AMT) spiked lower and closed the day in the red.<strong> </strong>In late trade, tech was in focus as Facebook&rsquo;s (FB) CEO Zuckerberg testified to lawmakers; there was little by way of new information, though tech and FB itself had an upside bias. &nbsp;Shares traded higher throughout most the testimony but came off highs as Zuckerberg stated there will always be a free version of Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: US 10y T-notes futs settled down 4+ ticks at 120-24+</strong> Bear-flattening was the theme, with short-end yields higher by around 3bps, while the longer-end of the curve was more or less unchanged at settlement. President Xi&rsquo;s speech overnight was the catalyst, helping to drive decent overnight volumes. However, as we entered the European day, the tplex was happy to range trade, with 10-year T-Notes patrolling the 120-24 to 120-29 bracket. There was some attention on the 5s30s part of the curve, which flattened to the narrowest since 2007. In the late part of the European afternoon, Treasuries were for a short while dictated by Bund action, which caught a bid after the ECB backtracked from Nowotny&rsquo;s hawkish comments, made earlier in the day. However, the effect was short lived. The US sold $30bln of 3yr notes, which tailed by 0.1bps, with the yield the highest at auction since May 2007. Cover was more-or-less in line with recent averages, though indirect participation dropped to the lowest since September; dealers took the most since September 2017. This week&rsquo;s $64bln of 3s/10s/30s will see a net paydown of around $12.5bln by the US Treasury, given the $74.5bln of maturities at the mid-month settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI futures (May) settle $2.09 higher at $65.51/bbl; Brent (June) settled $2.39 higher at $71.04/bbl.</strong> Crude put in a solid performance on Tuesday, buoyed overnight after constructive comments from China President Xi Jinping. The complex was again lifted in the European morning after IEA&rsquo;s head of oil industry and markets division suggested that steel tariffs might impact the ability of the US to produce and transport crude oil, while also arguing that OPEC+ ambitions to trim global crude inventories toward its five-year average could be achieved in 2-3 months. Ahead of this week&rsquo;s monthly reports from OPEC and the IEA, EIA released its short-term energy outlook where it raised 2018 and 2019 world demand growth forecasts, cutting 2018 US production estimates, though did raise US production estimates for 2019. After the bell, the API is expected to report crude stocks to draw by 200k, Cushing stocks are seen rising by 1.5mln, gasoline stocks are expected to draw by 1.4mln, while distillates are seen unchanged. Plenty of OPEC-speak on Tuesday. Some reports suggest that Saudis are seeking oil prices near $80/bbl (recall in March the WSJ reported that OPEC was divided on the issue, with Iran seeking a price near $60 to disincentivise US shale production, while the Saudis were keen on prices near $70, it was reported in March), which helped add further upside to crude (the Saudis are also said to be keeping May exports beneath 7mln BPD). Elsewhere, the UAE energy minister said rebalancing the oil market is progressing well and will likely be complete this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> <strong>DXY</strong> negative amid a firm risk tone, with flows moving out of havens (<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>CHF</strong>) and into risk (<strong>AUD</strong>, <strong>CAD</strong>, <strong>NZD</strong>, buoyed by commodities and metals). With volatility easing slightly, carry trades &ndash; which have been battered in 2018 &ndash; were once again in vogue, helping the likes of AUDJPY and NZDJPY rally by around 1.25%. The price action in <strong>EUR</strong> was fairly narrow (range 1.2304 to 1.2377) considering the bounce after Nowotny&rsquo;s comments; there were reports of offers through 1.2350 to 1.2400 which prevented price action from reaching the 1.24 level. Comments from hawkish BOE member McCafferty helped GBP rise, though 1.42 is proving elusive. EMFX action was mixed, though the <strong>RUB</strong> continued to be plagued by last week&rsquo;s application of further sanctions by the US.</p>\r\n",

The complex was again lifted in the European morning after IEA&rsquo;s head of oil industry and markets division suggested that steel tariffs might impact the ability of the US to produce and transport crude oil, while also arguing that OPEC+ ambitions to trim global crude inventories toward its five-year average could be achieved in 2-3 months. Ahead of this week&rsquo;s monthly reports from OPEC and the IEA, EIA released its short-term energy outlook where it raised 2018 and 2019 world demand growth forecasts, cutting 2018 US production estimates, though did raise US production estimates for 2019. After the bell, the API is expected to report crude stocks to draw by 200k, Cushing stocks are seen rising by 1.5mln, gasoline stocks are expected to draw by 1.4mln, while distillates are seen unchanged.</li>\r\n  <li>OPEC: Plenty of OPEC-speak on Tuesday. Some reports suggest that Saudis are seeking oil prices near $80/bbl (recall in March the WSJ reported that OPEC was divided on the issue, with Iran seeking a price near $60 to disincentivise US shale production, while the Saudis were keen on prices near $70), which helped add further upside to crude (the Saudis are also said to be keeping May exports beneath 7mln BPD). Elsewhere, the UAE energy minister said rebalancing the oil market is progressing well and will likely be complete this year.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The bidding deadline for the auction is 1800BST (1300 eastern time) with results expected shortly after.</li>\r\n  <li>Last month&rsquo;s 3-year note auction was relatively uneventful; stopping through by 0.2bps but the auction was covered just 2.94x, below the 6-auction average of 3.09x. Dealers were also left with a higher than average proportion of the issuance, but recently foreign demand has picked up, despite the increase in auction sizes.</li>\r\n  <li>TD Securities believes the 3-year point remains relatively attractive on the curve as the market remains priced for two more hikes this year and 1&frac12; in 2019.

The Index is just off 89.500 and session lows with the aid of firmer than forecast PPI leads ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s more pivotal CPI release and March FOMC minutes, which collectively or independently could dictate further loss of impetus below 90.000 and a test of the round number below. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The commodity bloc continues to outperform amidst the improved risk appetite largely due to China offering to significantly reduce auto import tariffs in the initial rounds of trade war negotiations. Aud/Usd is now above 0.7750, Nzd/Usd over 0.7360 and Usd/Cad down through 1.2650 and close to the next chart support at 1.2615 with the Loonie getting additional fuel from better than expected Canadian housing starts and extended oil price gains on bullish Saudi comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A somewhat unexpected boost for the single currency from ECB hawk Nowotny who revealed a personal preference for hiking the depo rate by 20 bp to start the next stage of policy normalisation, before looking to tighten the main refi.

His preference for a 20 bp depo hike in one fell swoop as a start before moving on to the main refi would be a significantly quicker normalisation pace than markets were factoring in and appeared to have approval for from the ECB. Hence, Bunds down sharply to 159.01 (-29 ticks vs +29 ticks at the Eurex high), Euribor strip 2.5 ticks adrift (Mar20 contract) and Eur/Usd up to circa 1.2375.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asia stocks traded mostly higher as the region focused on Chinese President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s address at the Boao Forum which struck a conciliatory tone as he stated that cold war mentality is out of place and that China will expand the opening up of its economy. Furthermore, President Xi also vowed to lower auto tariffs and repeated the suggestion of a win-win scenario. As such, ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were underpinned as markets reacted positively to President Xi&rsquo;s bullish speech with Japan helped by a weaker currency and as automakers cheered the news of the reduced tariffs. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU equities trade higher (Eurostoxx +0.20%) on the back of an improved risk sentiment throughout the market. This comes off the back of positive comments from Chinese president Xi Jinping striking a conciliatory tone and advocating the expansion of the Chinese economy. This allowed for the paring back of losses seen overnight for US equity futures that came as a result of President Trump&rsquo;s lawyer Cohen being raided in relation to the Stormy Daniels case. US equities however corrected slightly in morning trade as there were mentions of a breakdown in talks between the US and China due to disagreements over the high-tech industry. Leading sectors include industrials and consumer discretionary. Outperformance has come from individual stock moves in LVMH (+5.2%) with sales figures providing positive signals for the luxury sector, lifting Christian Dior (+3.7%) and Kering (+3.1%) in sympathy. Material names have also been lifted as a result of the aforementioned improving risk sentiment positively affecting the sector due to their exposure to the tariff effects. Further individual stock news to note includes the approval of Bayer&rsquo;s (+4.4%) acquisition of Monsanto which has allowed for a strong DAX in early trade (+1.4%) due to their weighting within the index. Underperformance was noted in Givaudan (-3.4%) due to uninspiring financial results</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX, the DXY looks top-heavy again having lost momentum after its latest flirtation with the 90.000 pivot, and a breakdown of the basket reveals a distinct revival of appetite for riskier currencies. AUD has reversed relative losses and more vs the USD and NZD in wake of conciliatory remarks from Chinese President Xi on import tariffs and wider economic reforms to leap ahead of its G10 counterparts and clear several major technical obstacles in the process. AUD/USD finally soaked up offers at the 0.7700 level, including option-related supply, and the 20 DMA at 0.7719 on the way to 0.7740, while the Kiwi has crossed 0.7300 vs the Greenback as AUD/NZD holds just below 1.0550. GBP has retained its recent bid tone with the aid of hawkish comments from BoE&rsquo;s McCafferty and strong May MPC hike expectations, with Cable up above 1.4160 again and EUR/GBP retesting bids/support around 0.8700. CAD/EUR/CHF are all pretty flat vs the Dollar, but with the Loonie still underpinned by NAFTA deal hopes/anticipation and breaching some chart levels after the BoC&rsquo;s upbeat business survey yesterday. USD/CAD has subsequently slipped down through a Fib at 1.2723, the 55 DMA at 1.2715 and 100 DMA at 1.2691 on its way to a circa 1.2675 low before consolidating. EUR/USD has settled above 1.2300, but appears capped by offers around 1.2330 and 1.2345 resistance, while USD/CHF resides just above 0.9550. JPY The stand-out, but not outsize loser given the broad improvement in risk sentiment, as USD/JPY continues to find 107.00 alluring ahead of hefty option expiry interest at the big figure this week, plus upside technical barriers from 107.10-15 (55 DMA) to 107.50-55 (Fib). No respite for RUB or Russian assets in general, as USD/RUB extends to the upside and peaks just shy of 64.000 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have drifted down from best levels, but not before advancing further to a fresh 159.59 Eurex intraday peak (+29 ticks), with market contacts suggesting that dip-buyers were encouraged by the fact that Monday&rsquo;s 159.24 session low held in (just). Moreover, a decent block purchase (7k lots) and techs looking to fill a gap (circa 159.46) exacerbated the bounce and outperformance, as Gilts slip to new Liffe lows in wake of BoE McCafferty&rsquo;s characteristically hawkish comments and little of note from Haldane &ndash; 122.15 (-20 ticks) and US Treasuries remain underwater amidst neutral commentary from Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan, latest PPI data and the first of this week&rsquo;s auctions. Talking supply, Germany&rsquo;s linker just about edged it vs the UK&rsquo;s 40 year fixed tap with a decent bid/cover (nearly twice oversubscribed), but lengthy tail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures are both trading higher, in-fitting with the global risk picture and amid lingering geopolitical tensions. This comes after US President Trump yesterday condemned the reported chemical attack in Syria and stated that the US is to make a decision on next steps in 24-48 hours; Trump refused to rule out military action. Furthermore, traders will also be mindful of the recent comments from Iran yesterday who threatened a strong response if the US pulls out of the nuclear deal and reapplies sanctions. Upcoming focus for the energy sector will likely centre around any developments on this front and tonight&rsquo;s API inventory release. In metals markets, spot gold is trading with little in the way of firm direction after Xi-inspired downside overnight has been pared back during European hours. Elsewhere, aluminium prices continue to be lifted by the fallout of Russian sanctions, whilst Chinese Dalian iron ore futures were seen higher during Asia-Pac hours amid the broader risk sentiment seen overnight.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: Equities open higher as risk sentiment improves, overshadowing concerns over Trump-lawyer raid",
        "content": "<p>EU equities trade higher (Eurostoxx +0.20%) on the back of an improved risk sentiment throughout the market. This comes off the back of positive comments from Chinese president Xi Jinping striking a conciliatory tone and advocating the expansion of the Chinese economy. This allowed for the paring back of losses seen overnight for US equity futures that came as a result of President Trump&rsquo;s lawyer Cohen being raided in relation to the Stormy Daniels case. US equities however corrected slightly in morning trade as there were mentions of a breakdown in talks between the US and China due to disagreements over the high-tech industry. Leading sectors include industrials and consumer discretionary. Outperformance has come from individual stock moves in LVMH (+5.2%) with sales figures providing positive signals for the luxury sector, lifting Christian Dior (+3.7%) and Kering (+3.1%) in sympathy. Material names have also been lifted as a result of the aforementioned improving risk sentiment positively affecting the sector due to their exposure to the tariff effects. Further individual stock news to note includes the approval of Bayer&rsquo;s (+4.4%) acquisition of Monsanto which has allowed for a strong DAX in early trade (+1.4%) due to their weighting within the index. Underperformance was noted in Givaudan (-3.4%) due to uninspiring financial results</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX, the DXY looks top-heavy again having lost momentum after its latest flirtation with the 90.000 pivot, and a breakdown of the basket reveals a distinct revival of appetite for riskier currencies. AUD has reversed relative losses and more vs the USD and NZD in wake of conciliatory remarks from Chinese President Xi on import tariffs and wider economic reforms to leap ahead of its G10 counterparts and clear several major technical obstacles in the process. AUD/USD finally soaked up offers at the 0.7700 level, including option-related supply, and the 20 DMA at 0.7719 on the way to 0.7740, while the Kiwi has crossed 0.7300 vs the Greenback as AUD/NZD holds just below 1.0550. GBP has retained its recent bid tone with the aid of hawkish comments from BoE&rsquo;s McCafferty and strong May MPC hike expectations, with Cable up above 1.4160 again and EUR/GBP retesting bids/support around 0.8700. CAD/EUR/CHF are all pretty flat vs the Dollar, but with the Loonie still underpinned by NAFTA deal hopes/anticipation and breaching some chart levels after the BoC&rsquo;s upbeat business survey yesterday. USD/CAD has subsequently slipped down through a Fib at 1.2723, the 55 DMA at 1.2715 and 100 DMA at 1.2691 on its way to a circa 1.2675 low before consolidating. EUR/USD has settled above 1.2300, but appears capped by offers around 1.2330 and 1.2345 resistance, while USD/CHF resides just above 0.9550. JPY The stand-out, but not outsize loser given the broad improvement in risk sentiment, as USD/JPY continues to find 107.00 alluring ahead of hefty option expiry interest at the big figure this week, plus upside technical barriers from 107.10-15 (55 DMA) to 107.50-55 (Fib). No respite for RUB or Russian assets in general, as USD/RUB extends to the upside and peaks just shy of 64.000 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have drifted down from best levels, but not before advancing further to a fresh 159.59 Eurex intraday peak (+29 ticks), with market contacts suggesting that dip-buyers were encouraged by the fact that Monday&rsquo;s 159.24 session low held in (just). Moreover, a decent block purchase (7k lots) and techs looking to fill a gap (circa 159.46) exacerbated the bounce and outperformance, as Gilts slip to new Liffe lows in wake of BoE McCafferty&rsquo;s characteristically hawkish comments and little of note from Haldane &ndash; 122.20 (-15 ticks) and US Treasuries remain underwater amidst neutral commentary from Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan, latest PPI data and the first of this week&rsquo;s auctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures are both trading higher, in-fitting with the global risk picture and amid lingering geopolitical tensions. This comes after US President Trump yesterday condemned the reported chemical attack in Syria and stated that the US is to make a decision on next steps in 24-48 hours; Trump refused to rule out military action. Furthermore, traders will also be mindful of the recent comments from Iran yesterday who threatened a strong response if the US pulls out of the nuclear deal and reapplies sanctions. Upcoming focus for the energy sector will likely centre around any developments on this front and tonight&rsquo;s API inventory release. In metals markets, spot gold is trading with little in the way of firm direction after Xi-inspired downside overnight has been pared back during European hours. Elsewhere, aluminium prices continue to be lifted by the fallout of Russian sanctions, whilst Chinese Dalian iron ore futures were seen higher during Asia-Pac hours amid the broader risk sentiment seen overnight. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Eur/Usd has settled above 1.2300, but appears capped by offers around 1.2330 and 1.2345 resistance, while Usd/Chf resides just above 0.9550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stand-out, but not outsize loser given the broad improvement in risk sentiment, as Usd/Jpy continues to find 107.00 alluring ahead of hefty option expiry interest at the big figure this week, plus upside technical barriers from 107.10-15 (55 DMA) to 107.50-55 (Fib).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RUB </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No respite for the Rouble or Russian assets in general, as Usd/Rub extends to the upside and peaks just shy of 64.000 at one stage.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade mostly higher as the region focuses on Chinese President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s address at the Boao Forum which struck a conciliatory tone as he stated that cold war mentality is out of place and that China will expand the opening up of its economy. Furthermore, President Xi also vowed to lower auto tariffs and repeated the suggestion of a win-win scenario. As such, ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) are underpinned as markets reacted positively to President Xi&rsquo;s bullish speech with outperformance in Japan helped by a weaker currency and as automakers cheered the news of the reduced tariffs. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) and Hang Seng (+1.0%) conform to the optimism, while US equity futures have also recovered from the selling pressure seen from reports that FBI raided Trump lawyer Michael Cohen amid investigation related to possible bank fraud, campaign finance and the payment made to Stormy Daniels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses rose on the back of President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s speech which further doused trade war fears and resulted to safe-haven outflows, while CNH gained on the speech and AUD was also propped as a proxy for China. Elsewhere, the greenback marginally benefitted with the DXY eyeing the 90.00 level to the upside, which in turn kept overnight price action in counterparts EUR and GBP restricted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued with demand lacking as focus centres on riskier assets and with participants side-lined ahead of an enhanced-liquidity auction in the long-to super-long end later, while T-notes were pressured overnight as President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s address spurred safe-haven outflows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
