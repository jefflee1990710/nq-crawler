While EUR was magnetic to 1.22, after EU&#39;s Juncker complained and suggested that the EU would take its own action in response, the single currency printed fresh highs; meanwhile, the CAD dropped from fresh YTD highs just beneath 1.2895, moving back towards the 1.2850 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After US stocks tanked on protectionist fears, and the SPX tripped through its 100dma, there was a broad flight away from the USD (and the bid in Tsys), led by USDJPY moving lower, breaking the bottom-end of its overnight range (near 106.50), to find support around 106.20 - a level that was in focus in the early part of Feb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><a name=\"_Hlk507704203\">COMMODITIES</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude is still nursing losses incurred after this week&rsquo;s bearish inventory data rounds-off the first negative month for oil prices since August 2017.

The former was the key driver, and while steel names were firmer, companies in the industrial and autos sector bemoaned the likely production cost hikes (O&amp;G names, as well as autos). The result was the EMINI tumbling through multiple technical levels to print lows around 2660, before consolidating around 2670.

The former was the key driver, and while steel names were firmer, companies in the industrial and autos sector bemoaned the likely production cost hikes (O&amp;G names, as well as autos). The result was the EMINI tumbling through multiple technical levels to print lows around 2660, before consolidating around 2670.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SECTORS:&nbsp;<br />* ENERGY -0.2%: </strong>RRC among the top performers after earnings on Weds.&nbsp;<br /><strong>* MATERIALS -1.1%: </strong>Steel names (AA, CENX, AKS, NUE, STLD, X) buoyed after Trump said US will impose steel/aluminium import tariffs next week.&nbsp;<br /><strong>* INDUSTRIALS -2.0%: </strong>BRK.A said to be building take in UPS.<br /><strong>* CONS DISC -1.1%: </strong>FCAU Feb vehicle sales better than exp -1.4% vs -11%; F Feb sales worse than exp -6.9% vs exp -6%; GM feb sales worse than exp -6.9% vs -4.5%; BBY earnings and rev beat, boosts dividend; gun names AOBC and RGR higher after WMT and KR raise minimum age to buy guns.

The narrowing the short end saw 2s yields back to the bottom of its recent range, a reprieve after printing new cyclical highs this week. The long-end underperformed. The Tplex was bid all day, but found fresh buying impetus amid risk-off inspired by protectionist news that the US would impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports next week.&nbsp;<br />* At settlement: 2s 2.2137% (-4.8bps), 5s 2.5814% (-6.9bps), 10s 2.8114% (-5.7bps), 30s 3.09 (-3.9bps). Major curve spreads were little changed; with 2s5s 2bps narrower, while 5s30s was 2.5bps wider.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 65 cents lower at $61.99/bbl; Brent futures settle 90 cents lower at $63.83/bbl.&nbsp;</strong><br />* Crude is still nursing losses incurred after this week&rsquo;s bearish inventory data rounds-off the first negative month for oil prices since August 2017. The sour equity tone also weighed, pushing crude towards lows above $60/bbl for WTI, and Brent just above $63/bbl.<br />* Ineos says Forties flows are continuing normally; Forties oil loading restrictions stated as lifted at Hound Point.<br />* There was limited support from UAE, where production has been trimmed 70k BPD due to maintenance. Some desks believe that seasonal date unlikely to offer much support, and as noted yesterday, some desks cannot see many bullish catalysts for crude in the weeks ahead, absent unforeseen supply shocks.&nbsp;<br />* Libyan crude output said to have reached 1.1mln BPD.<br />* Russia energy min Novak says Russia in full compliance with its production cuts deal in February, oil market rebalancing is going well.&nbsp;<br />* American Petroleum Institute says Trump tariffs on aluminium and steel would raise costs in the oil and gas sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>XAU:</strong><br />* While Fed chair Powell was slightly cautious in his Senate testimony vs his House testimony on Tues, a hawkish Dudley (voter) provided today&#39;s dose of Fed hawkishness (four hikes is seen as gradual - see USD). But even before then, XAU had breached YTD lows around 1308, going as low as the $1302 support level. There was an afternoon bounce higher as US stocks sold-off, however, the magnitude of gains weren&#39;t particularly hugeand we returned to the $1308 mark.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD:</strong><br />* After it emerged that the US will impose steel and aluminium tariffs on imports next week, the DXY began giving back some of the gains it had printed in the day (as high as 90.932). While EUR was magnetic to 1.22, after EU&#39;s Juncker complained and suggested that the EU would take its own action in response, the single currency printed fresh highs; meanwhile, the CAD dropped from fresh YTD highs just beneath 1.2895, moving back towards the 1.2850 mark.&nbsp;<br />* Trump advisor Cohn was said to have objected to Trump tariff decision today.<br />* Fed chair Powell leaned-back struck a more cautious tone in his testimony to the Senate, suggesting that evidence of a decisive pick-up in wages is lacking. Powell did, however, state that he expects wages to increase going forward, and repeated his view for gradual hikes. Powell also mentioned global trade, arguing that tariffs may not be the more appropriate way to deal with trade disputes.<br />* Fed&#39;s Dudley (voter), who on 8/Feb said three hikes in 2018 was very reasonable, today made the case the four hikes is consistent with &#39;gradually&#39; lifting rates.<br />* US Jan core PCE &nbsp;1.5% yy (exp 1.5%) vs 1.5%; 0.3% mm (exp 0.3%) vs 0.2%.<br />* US Jan personal income 0.4% (exp 0.3%) vs 0.4%; personal spending 0.2% mm (exp 0.2%) vs 0.4%; analysts noted that core inflation rose as real spending weakened.<br />* US Feb ISM mfg 60.8 (Exp 58.7) vs 59.1; analysts noted that while the headline was stellar, it was buoyed mostly by lagging metrics (inventories, deliveries and employment), while new orders and production slipped slightly.&nbsp;<br />* US weekly claims 210k (exp 226k) vs 222k, 4wk moving avg vs 226k; cont claims 1.931mln (exp 1.93mln) vs 1.847mln (from 1.875mln).<br />* US Feb final mfg PMI 55.3 (exp 55.9) vs 55.5.<br />* US Jan construction spending 0.0% mm (exp 0.3%) vs 0.7%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP:</strong><br />* Sterling was hit by Brexit news flow as well as broader USD strength. GBP saw lows above 1.37 (the figure held) and fell to just shy of 0.89. Analysts are struggling to find a bullish narrative for sterling amid the Brexit negativity. However, some desks warn that recent declines on souring Brexit sentiment may be vulnerable to correct sharply higher on any hint of &#39;good news&#39;, and accordingly, attention now falls on PM May&#39;s Friday speech on Brexit.<br />* Tusk/May&rsquo;s meeting was said to be &lsquo;open and honest&rsquo;, with the focus on content and process towards the future relationship post-Brexit; Northern Ireland transition was discussed. Source says real political difficulties lie ahead.<br />* UK PM May spokesperson says good progress has been made in reaching agreement on transition period, following May&#39;s meeting with EU Council President Tusk.<br />* EU&#39;s Barnier says UK is closing the door on Brexit solutions, and he suggests the only model left is a free trade agreement. Adds all other models available if the UK is willing to accept balance of rights and obligations.<br />* Reports suggest that Brexit Sec Davis has threatened that the UK will refuse to pay a divorce bill until EU backs down on attempts to keep Northern Ireland within the customs union, and UK will not agree any bill until &quot;all the issues&quot; have been finalised.<br />* UK Feb mfg PMI 55.2 (exp 55.0) vs 55.3; headline at lowest since June 2017, points to UK mfg sector has lost momentum in Q1 (pointing to 0.5% mfg output growth in Q1 vs 1.3% in Q4). Some note signs that the boost to exports from the drop in sterling is fading after export orders slipped.&nbsp;<br />* UK Jan Money supply 1.5% vs -0.6%; Jan mortgage lending 3.39bln (exp 3.6bln) vs 3.683bln; Jan consumer credit 1.357bln (exp 1.4bln) vs 1.58bln (from 1.52bln). Generally data gives reasons to think that the broader economy has not lost too much momentum, some analysts argued.<br />* Feb Nationwide -0.3% mm (exp 0.2%) vs 0.6%; 2.2% yy (exp 2.6%) vs 3.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY:</strong><br />* After US stocks tanked on protectionist fears, and the SPX tripped through its 100dma, there was a broad flight away from the USD (and the bid in Tsys), led by USDJPY moving lower, breaking the bottom-end of its overnight range (near 106.50), to find support around 106.20 - a level that was in focus in teh early part of Feb.&nbsp;<br />* Japan Q4 capex 4.3% yy (exp 3.0%) vs 4.2%. Data suggests that Q4 capex was stronger than initially reported, but some analysts say alone won&#39;t lift GDP growth. This data is the basis for any revisions to non-resi investment in the second Q4 gdp estimate, due next week.&nbsp;<br />* (Overnight) Japan Feb mfg PMI 54.1 (exp 54.0) vs 54.0.<br />* (Overnight) BOJ gov Kuroda said easing has added to Japanese growth, though added wages and inflation have been somewhat weak.<br />* (Overnight) BOJ Kataoka said BOJ must ease more to lower 10yr+ yields and reach price target quickly, and add additional easing if achieving price goals are delayed; added there is still quite a distance to policy normalisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD:&nbsp;</strong><br />* The CAD firmed against the USD, sending USDCAD from fresh YTD highs below 1.29 back to the 1.2830 region, which was capping price action yesterday.&nbsp;<br />* Q4 current account -16.4bln (exp -17.65bln) vs -19.35bln.<br />* CA Feb mfg PMI 55.6 vs prev 55.9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MXN:&nbsp;</strong><br />* Moves in the MXN were more muted than say the CAD after today&#39;s protectionist news out of the US, and amid the afternoon dollar route, the peso remained within its range (18.82 to 18.94).<br />* Mexico Steel Industry body says Mexico should respond reciprocally and immediately to any US steel tariffs.<br />* In the latest round in Mexico City, NAFTA negotiators said to have completed work on regulatory practices &#39;chapter&#39; (which would complete the fourth of 30 chapters), sources report.<br />* Banxico inflation report (weds) highlights inflation risks are to the upside given economic uncertainties (potential weakening of MXN amid NAFTA uncertainty, Fed tightening cycle, volatility around Jul election). Banxico exps inflation to hit 3.0% target Q1 19 (vs Q4 18 in the prev Nov QIR). Growth forecasts unchanged. Some analysts argue risks to inflation could motivate the Banxico to hike 25bps on 4/Apr.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The DXY has inched further above 90.500-600 chart resistance and tested the next upside target (90.886 key Fib) with the aid of a near universally stronger than forecast ISM manufacturing survey, and is now awaiting the 2<sup>nd</sup> take from Fed chair Powell before President Trump&rsquo;s statement on steel and aluminium tariffs. Looking at the index basket, Eur/Usd posted a marginal new ytd low around 1.2155, but left a decent 1.2150 expiry unscathed over the NY cut, while Cable remained below 1.3750 on more tough talk from the EU on Brexit and despite positive comments from UK PM May&rsquo;s spox before her keynote speech on Friday. Usd/Cad still seems inclined towards a test of the next big figure above 1.2850 despite better than consensus Canadian current account data and a less frothy manufacturing PMI vs its NA neighbour. Usd/Chf is inching closer to 0.9500 and Usd/Jpy has rebounded over 107.00 from circa 106.55 lows to pick off more exporter offers, but options continue to hamper the upside with some Usd10 bn expiring next week at the strike, and plenty of interest reported in 106.00/105.00 puts via spreads. In metals, another sign of the Greenback&rsquo;s renewed strength via Gold&rsquo;s decline to just a few bucks from 1300/oz.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>1st March 2018&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />&bull; European bourses have followed on from performance in their US and Asia-Pac counterparts (Eurostoxx 50 1.1%) to trade lower across the board</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Core bonds are gradually building on earlier positive momentum and advancing further amidst what appears to be heightened risk-off or averse sentiment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Looking ahead, highlights include US manufacturing PMI, US PCE, US manufacturing ISM and a slew of speakers including Fed&rsquo;s Powell&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA&nbsp;<br />Asian equity markets were mostly lower as the downbeat tone rolled over from Wall St. where the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA posted their worst monthly performance in over 2 years following the market turmoil seen in early February. This weighed on the Asia-Pac majors from the open with ASX 200 (-0.7%) led lower by weakness in energy names after similar underperformance of the sector in US due to declines in crude, while Nikkei 225 (-1.6%) suffered broad losses amid a firmer JPY. Chinese bourses outperformed, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) with pressure somewhat alleviated following better than expected Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI data and the resumption of PBoC liquidity operations. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued with prices contained after yesterday&rsquo;s reduced-Rinban-induced selling, while a 10yr auction also failed to spur firm demand as the results were mixed with b/c slightly softer and accepted prices higher than prior.&nbsp;<br />Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI (Feb) 51.6 vs. Exp. 51.3 (Prev. 51.5). (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />PBoC injected CNY 100bln via 7-day reverse repos, CNY 30bln via 28-day reverse repos &amp; CNY 20bln via 63-day reverse repos. (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3352 (Prev. 6.3294)&nbsp;<br />BoJ Governor Kuroda said easing has added to Japan&#39;s growth, while he also stated that wages and inflation have been somewhat weak. (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />BoJ&#39;s Kataoka said BoJ must ease more to reach price target quickly and that Japan they are still quite a distance to considering shift from easy policy. Kataoka added the BoJ should take additional easing steps if there is a delay to reach the 2% price target and that the sales tax hike next year is to put downward pressure on prices. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US&nbsp;<br />US Special Counsel Mueller is reportedly examining President Trump&#39;s alleged attempts to force Attorney General Sessions out in July. (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />UK Brexit Secretary Davis reportedly threatens to not pay the EU divorce bill in Irish hard border spat. (The Times)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS &nbsp;<br />Riksbank&rsquo;s Ingves states that monetary policy needs to remain cautious going forward. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES&nbsp;<br />European bourses have followed on from performance in their US and Asia-Pac counterparts (Eurostoxx 50 -1.1%) to trade lower across the board. In terms of sector specific moves, losses are relatively broad-based with all ten sectors trading with losses; minor underperformance in the IT sector with Dialog Semiconductor paring back some of yesterday&rsquo;s earnings-inspired gains. Ultimately, this morning&rsquo;s trade has been one dominated by earnings with notable movers including: Cobham (+11.6%), Peugeot (+6.6%), AB Inbev (+5.3%), Eiffage (+2%), WPP (-13.2%), Adecco (-8.5%), Carrefour (-6.5%), Beiersdorf (-3.4%).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX&nbsp;<br />The DXY has cleared another chart hurdle having climbed above 90.500-600 resistance on Wednesday, and has maintained positive momentum to edge towards the next upside technical objective around 90.886 (Fib level) despite Usd/Jpy and the Jpy in general bucking the overall trend (on safe-haven grounds). Eur/Usd is retesting sub-1.2200 bids around 1.2180 ahead of Fib support at 1.2173, and with decent option expiries between 1.2150 and 1.2200 (1 bn and 2 bn respectively) also in the mix. Cable continues to weaken on Brexit-related factors and trending even lower under 1.3750, while Eur/Gbp has breached 0.8850 even though the single currency is relatively soft independently (more long liquidation and political premium ahead of Italian and German votes on Sunday). On that note, Eur/Jpy is hovering just above 130.00 having dipped below overnight, and back on track to hit TOTW profit targets for a couple of major banks. The Aud is underperforming G10 peers again, and heading for a 0.7700 test after significantly weaker than forecast Aussie Capex data. Having breached key support at 0.7759, bears will be eyeing 0.7695, while Nzd/Usd is only just holding above 0.7200. Usd/Cad hovering around 1.2850 ahead of Canadian current account data and&nbsp;manufacturing PMI. Elsewhere, Eur/Sek continues to climb after some choppy trade and mixed Riksbank rhetoric, with the overriding message caution on monetary policy due to uncertainty over the outlook for inflation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME&nbsp;<br />Core bonds are gradually building on earlier positive momentum and advancing further amidst what appears to be heightened riskoff or averse sentiment, which in turn is turning the technical landscape more bullish. Bunds just climbed to a new 159.90 peak and Gilts extended their Liffe high to 121.60 for gains of 46 and 52 ticks on the day respectively, while US Treasuries continue to retrace from recent lows in futures and yield peaks, as the curve flattens further. No real sign of any major FTQ, but EU bourses are succumbing to more selling pressure and there is plenty of potential risk looming given the ongoing disparities in Brexit negotiations, Italian voters heading for the polling stations and Germany&rsquo;s SPD yet to give the grand coalition a rubber stamp.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES &nbsp;<br />WTI and Brent crude futures have seen very little in the way of price action during Asia-Pac and European trade following yesterday&rsquo;s DoE-inspired sell-off with newsflow today otherwise particularly light. In metals markets, spot gold has been unable to benefit from the risk aversion seen in European equity markets as the firmer USD supresses prices and extends on recent losses. Elsewhere, Chinese steel futures were seen higher overnight as the prospects of additional output cuts supports prices, whilst copper prices endured another session of losses despite encouraging Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Sea Buzzard oil field production is still restricted; according to sources.

Bunds just climbed to a new 159.86 peak and Gilts extended their Liffe high to 121.60 for gains of 42 and 52 ticks on the day respectively, while US Treasuries continue to retrace from recent lows in futures and yield peaks, as the curve flattens further. No real sign of any major FTQ, but EU bourses are succumbing to more selling pressure and there is plenty of potential risk looming given the ongoing disparities in Brexit negotiations, Italian voters heading for the polling stations and Germany&rsquo;s SPD yet to give the grand coalition a rubber stamp. Looming and heavy issuance may cap the steady march upwards, while UK debt may be undermined by another increase in net foreign sales, according to January data.</p>\r\n",

Bunds started relatively flat vs Wednesday&rsquo;s 159.44 close before climbing to a 159.63 early high, but in truth still not out of recent range extremes and likely to wait for more/clearer direction from the ECB next Thursday. More immediately, Eurozone manufacturing PMIs, Spanish and French supply along with some key US data, including PCE inflation, on top of the aforementioned semi-annual speech part 2. Turning to Gilts, further outperformance within 121.30-16 trading parameters vs yesterday&rsquo;s 121.08 settlement and Short Sterling futures also bid, albeit mildly ahead of the UK manufacturing PMI and post-weaker then forecast Nationwide house prices, but mainly due to latest Brexit developments that underscore major points of contention between the UK and EU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This weighed on the Asia-Pac majors from the open with <strong>ASX 200 (-0.7%)</strong> led lower by weakness in energy names after similar underperformance of the sector in US due to declines in crude, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (-1.8%)</strong> suffered broad losses amid a firmer JPY. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.5%)</strong> was indecisive and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%)</strong> outperformed with pressure somewhat alleviated following better than expected Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI data and the resumption of PBoC liquidity operations. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued with prices contained after yesterday&rsquo;s reduced-Rinban-induced selling, while a 10yr auction also failed to spur firm demand as the results were mixed with b/c slightly softer and accepted prices higher than prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI (Feb) 51.6 vs. Exp. 51.3 (Prev. 51.5). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 100bln via 7-day reverse repos, CNY 30bln via 28-day reverse repos &amp; CNY 20bln via 63-day reverse repos. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3352 (Prev. 6.3294)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BoJ Governor Kuroda</strong> said easing has added to Japan&#39;s growth, while he also stated that wages and inflation have been somewhat weak. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BoJ&#39;s Kataoka</strong> said BoJ must ease more to reach price target quickly and that Japan they are still quite a distance to considering shift from easy policy. Kataoka added the BoJ should take additional easing steps if there is a delay to reach the 2% price target and that the sales tax hike next year is to put downward pressure on prices.

Furthermore, the latest reports added that UK Brexit Secretary Davis is now threatening to not pay the divorce bill until the EU backs down regarding the Irish hard border spat. <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was also pressured following a miss on Q4 Private Capex data, although a higher estimate for 2017-2018 and upward revisions to the prior figures helped stem losses. Elsewhere, <strong>JPY</strong> resisted bowing to the greenback for most of Asia trade as safe-haven flows underpinned the currency, while comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda and calls for further easing from dovish dissenter Kataoka were unsurprising and failed to provide any meaningful relief for <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Private Capital Expenditure (Q4) -0.2% vs. Exp. 1.0% (Prev. 1.0%, Rev. 1.9%).

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was further pressured overnight as the greenback remained firm and <strong>copper</strong> was stable after the recent risk-averse triggered losses.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EIA said US crude oil production fell 108k BPD in December to 9.949mln BPD (Prev. revised 10.057mln BPD in November).

In addition, there were also separate reports that trade talks between China and US officials are to take place today at the White House. (Washington Post/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trump Administration official stated that US is considering oil-related sanctions on Venezuela to place pressure on President Maduro and doesn&#39;t rule out a full US oil embargo on Venezuela which could cause a fairly significant shock to the oil-market in the short-term.

Short-end Treasury yields, however, did touch fresh cycle highs in the day, with yields on 2s hitting 2.2862%. But with that said, at settlement, major curves were still narrower: 2s10s -1.7bps, 2s30s -2.2bps, 5s30s 1.7bps (to 48bps).

This weighed on the Asia-Pac majors from the open with ASX 200 (-0.9%) led lower by weakness in energy names after similar underperformance of the sector in US due to declines in crude, while broad losses are seen across the Nikkei 225 (-1.4%) amid a firmer JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) are mixed with pressure somewhat alleviated following better than expected Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI data and the resumption of PBoC liquidity operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD remains firmer overnight with EUR/USD sitting near the prior day&rsquo;s lows at the 1.2100 handle and as GBP/USD languishes significantly below 1.3800 amid discord related to the draft EU withdrawal agreement. Furthermore, the latest reports added that UK Brexit Secretary Davis is now threatening to not pay the divorce bill until the EU backs down regarding the Irish hard border spat. AUD/USD was also pressured following a miss on Q4 Private Capex data, although a higher Capex Estimate for 2017-2018 and upward revisions to the prior figures helped stem losses. Elsewhere, JPY continues to defy the trend amongst its major peers as safe-haven flows underpin the currency, while comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda and calls for further easing from dovish dissenter Kataoka were unsurprising and failed to provide any meaningful relief for USD/JPY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower with prices subdued after yesterday&rsquo;s reduced-Rinban-induced-selling, with demand also lacking as participants look ahead to a 10yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
