There were also comments from Turkish Finance Minister Albayrak that the government has an action plan regarding the currency and will take necessary measures on Monday to ease market concerns, while he stated they will not convert nor seize FX deposits and that the currency is being directly targeted by the US President. In related news, Turkish Presidency Communication Chief Altun stated Erdogan&rsquo;s comments were a warning against FX flight, while the banking regulator also announced to limit swap transactions in which banks&rsquo; total swap transactions has been capped at 50% of banks&rsquo; equity.

However the morning sell off in the US futures complex calmed down but stocks were further pressured as Turkey announced they will retaliate as necessary to the &lsquo;doubling&rsquo; tariffs,&nbsp; extending losses to just shy of 1% before the near agreement on Pastor Brunson was announced which saw a small reversal. Microchip (MCHP) beat on EPS and revenues fell in line with expectations, however the co. provided forecasts for its next quarter revenue which was lower than the street&rsquo;s estimates. Also, the CEO of the co. said the excessive Microsemi (MSCC) inventory is a headwind for revenue in the next couple of quarters. Dropbox (DBX) were also lower after their earnings report despite beats and raising guidance, which initially saw the stock higher pre-market but as they announced they are to bring forward the lock up change to August 23rd from September 18th, gains were lost and extended to losses of ~8%.

Amid decent volume, the short end of the curve was hit more than the long end; 5yr yields were lower by c.7bps and 30yr yields were lower by c.6bps.The 10yr yield posted the biggest one-day fall since late May, hitting a low of 2.85%. 2s5s narrowed by c2.5bps, 2s10 by c.2bps, whilst 5s30 widened by c.1.5bps.
