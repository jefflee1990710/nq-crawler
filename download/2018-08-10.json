The TRY hit new record lows and was down over 20% at one stage, after US President Trump announced that he would be doubling up on tariffs on steel at 50% and aluminium at 20%. In response to the US move, the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced they would retaliate as necessary to the new tariffs. Following Friday&rsquo;s TRY depreciation a &nbsp;spokesperson the IMF stated they have received no indication from Turkish authorities that they are contemplating a request for financial assistance. Heading towards the weekend. US President Trump&rsquo;s Lawyer Sekulow announced they are close to reaching an agreement on Pastor Brunson which in a slightly delayed reaction saw riskier assets catch a bid from their lows and safe haven assets saw the opposite. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>RIA reported on Friday that Russia&rsquo;s President Putin and the security council discussed possible sanctions on the US. This came after Russia&#39;s PM Medvedev said they would have to respond economically, politically or by other means to the new US sanctions. Following the US tariff announcement on Turkey, Turkish President Erdogan spoke with Russian President Putin on economic ties and announced they are pleased with the direction of the TurkishRussian trade relations.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* US CPI: </strong>CPI MM ticked up by 0.2% from 0.1% seen in June meeting expectations, though the increase was only enough to keep the YY headline to 2.9%, consensus was at 3%; this remains the fastest rate in six years. The yearly figure remained unchanged mainly because of energy prices which have edged lower in the last two months and were down 0.5% in July. In contrast, Core CPI surprised to the upside and hit a fresh cycle high, with headline YY rising to 2.4% from 2.3%, beating expectations. Ex-food and energy prices in July continued their ascent, increasing 0.2% mostly on the back of higher new and used car prices. Analysts at Wells Fargo expect headline inflation to ease in the coming months as oil prices retreat but Core inflation to remain close to the current level as they see willingness from firms to raise prices; this should &lsquo;keep the Fed on track to raise rates in September and most likely again in December.&rsquo; &nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;<br />* CANADIAN EMPLOYMENT CHANGE: </strong>The employment change for July came in strong posting an increase of 54.1k jobs, consensus was for a 17k rise. Nonetheless, the breakdown &nbsp;was weak, where a full time employment fell by 28k and part time employment increased by 82k. Average Hourly Wages fell from June, to 3.0% from 3.5%. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* SPX -0.71% at 2833, NDX -0.79% at 7408, DJI -0.77% at 25313.</strong> SECTORS: Energy +0.26%, Materials -1.43%, Industrials -0.81% Cons Discretionary -0.82%, Cons Staples 0.32%, Healthcare -0.39%, Financials -1.16%, Tech -0.81%, Telecoms -0.75%, Utilities -0.41%.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* FUTURES:</strong> US futures followed on from the selloff in European equities amid the ongoing concerns in Turkey, which saw the Nasdaq snap its 8th daily consecutive gain. However the morning sell off in the US futures complex &nbsp;calmed down but stocks were further pressured as Turkey announced they will retaliate as necessary to the &lsquo;doubling&rsquo; tariffs, &nbsp;extending losses to just shy of 1% before the near agreement on Pastor Brunson was announced which saw a small reversal. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Microchip (MCHP) beat on EPS and revenues fell in line with expectations, however the co. provided forecasts for its next quarter revenue which was lower than the street&rsquo;s estimates. Also, the CEO of the co. said the excessive Microsemi (MSCC) inventory is a headwind for revenue in the next couple of quarters. Dropbox (DBX) were also lower after their earnings report despite beats and raising guidance, which initially saw the stock higher pre-market but as they announced &nbsp;they are to bring forward the lock up change to August 23rd from September 18th, gains were lost and extended to losses of ~8%. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;<br />* Stock Specifics:</strong> Tesla&rsquo;s (TSLA) board is said to meet with banks next week to analyse the going private proposal where funding will be addressed. Elsewhere, Pershing Square&rsquo;s Bill Ackman sees substantial upside for Lowe&rsquo;s (LOW) under the new CEO of the company, Marvin Ellison. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* M&amp;A:</strong> Cigna (CI) issued yet another letter showing &nbsp;further support for the deal with Express Scripts (ESRX), which was also backed by ISS who also urged shareholders to vote in favour of the deal.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* WTI CRUDE FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 82c HIGHER AT USD 67.63; BRENT CRUDE FUTURES (V8) SETTLE 74c HIGHER AT USD 72.81&nbsp;</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />As crude markets slightly recovered yesterday from the prior day&rsquo;s sell off, the rebound carried over into Friday&rsquo;s session where Citi noted &ldquo;The gains certainly make a bullish statement considering that weaker equities and a stronger US dollar would normally result in some risk-off selling across the broader commodity space.&rdquo; News flow was relatively light again today apart from the ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the IEA report where they forecast oil demand growth for 2018 to rise 110kBPD to a total of 1.49mln BPD, and saw risks to&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;oil demand growth in 2019 due to trade disputes and rising prices if oil supply is constrained. Baker Hughes rig counts added the most oil rigs since may, oil was up 10 to 869 rigs, natgas rose 3 to 186 bringing the total to 1057 this week.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE &nbsp;21 TICKS HIGHER AT 120-12. &nbsp;</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Treasuries rallied throughout the day, with yields falling to a 3week low at one point, as risk-aversion spurred by the currency crisis in Turkey shifted investors&rsquo; position away from risky assets into a bid for safe-havens. Amid decent volume, the short end of the curve was hit more than the long end; 5yr yields were lower by c.7bps and 30yr yields were lower by c.6bps.The 10yr yield posted the biggest one-day fall since late May, hitting a low of 2.85%. 2s5s narrowed by c2.5bps, 2s10 by c.2bps, whilst 5s30 widened by c.1.5bps. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP: &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />* DXY: </strong>Another bullish weak for the broad Dollar and index as a bi-product, as all bar the safest of G10 havens suffer severe contagion from the EM exodus that reached fully-fledged FTQ status on Friday. In short, USD/pairings plummeted as the LIRA and ROUBLE continued to collapse to the point of capitulation for the Try that lost 20% at one stage on the final day of the week, having succumbed to a circa 10% dump late Tuesday/early Wednesday. In extremely fast market conditions, USDTRY got close to 7.0000 or 6.8000+ at least with only fleeting respite from rousing rhetoric from Turkish President Erdogan and his Finance Minister, but crucially no actual action. However, the final straw came from US President Trump who promptly doubled import tariffs on steel and aluminium from Turkey. Meanwhile, USDRUB has rallied to 67.6535 vs 63.3450 at the start of the week. Back to the DXY, 96.000 has been cleared to a fresh ytd peak at 96.313, and chart-watchers will now be eyeing 96.512 resistance ahead of a couple more upside tech levels before 97.000.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* AUD, EUR: </strong>Friday&rsquo;s major fall guys, but also among the worst non-EM performers over the week with some downbeat data and dovish RBA/ECB impulses (former via the policy meeting, commentary and SOMP, and latter from the latest bulletin) compounding the aforementioned risk-averse flows. AUDUSD has retreated sharply from just above 0.7450 to sub0.7300, while EURUSD finally breached strong support at the previous 2018 base to take about barriers and trip mega-stops to almost test 1.1400, while sliding through 1.1400 to 1.1350 vs the CHF.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* GBP: </strong>Another big loser on a mix of ongoing Brexit jitters/uncertainty, political upheaval and BoE policy perceptions as &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; prospects increased. Cable has tumbled from just over 1.3000 to circa 1.2725 and new ytd lows, but clawed back some lost ground vs the EUR as TRY woes hit the single currency harder to trade around 0.8950 vs 0.9030 at one stage, with the aid of some encouraging UK data (preliminary Q2 GDP, June trade and industrial output, plus a 0.5% NIESR forecast for Q3 growth).&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* CAD, NZD:</strong> Another crazy week for the Loonie in terms of volatility amidst better NAFTA news and mixed data, but mainly on an escalation in tensions between Canada and Saudi Arabia, with the latter instructing investors to liquidate Canadian assets and suspending other projects on top of diplomatic measures. USDCAD is mid-range between 1.31201.2955 trading parameters, with a degree of support from the latest jobs report revealing a big headline payroll beat, but not so upbeat internals. Returning down under, the Kiwi was significantly undermined by the RBNZ that trimmed OCR forecasts out to the end of 2019 and added that while the next move could go either way, rate cut chances have risen. This, along with overall themes leaves USDNZD hovering around 0.6600 vs 0.6761 at best and 0.6568 at worst, while the AUDNZD cross reached 1.1175 at one stage vs 1.1060 currently and 1.0950 or thereabouts at the beginning of the week.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* JPY: </strong>The exception to the rule and only G10 to end the week on the up vs the USD and other currency counterparts as the effects of BoJ policy tweaks under the guise of flexibility continued to reverberate and stronger the anticipated Japanese GDP data exacerbated the JPY&rsquo;s allure in times of aversion to risk/safety flights. Indeed, USDJPY is back below 111.00 following some choppy moves amidst huge option expiry interests layered between the big figure and 112.00.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* SCANDI, EM: </strong>Even though firmer than forecast Swedish and Norwegian inflation data provided some protection for the SEK, and NOK especially, weak services metrics hampered the former and risk aversion in general prevented the latter from getting too carried away ahead of next week&rsquo;s Norges Bank policy meeting.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* NEXT WEEK: </strong>&nbsp;Monday: No tier 1 data or notable events Tuesday: Chinese Industrial Output and Retail Sales, German GDP Flash, UK Jobs data, German ZEW Survey, Home Depot Earnings Wednesday: UK CPI, US Retail Sales, Cisco Earnings Thursday: Australian Jobs data, Norges Bank Interest Rate Decision, Walmart Earnings Friday: EZ and Canadian CPI, University of Michigan Sentiment. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/week-in-focus-week-commencing-13th-august-now-available-in-the-research-suite-10-08-2018\">For the full RANsquawk Week in Focus click here. &nbsp;</a><br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Try and Rub rout sparks EM and broader safety flight",
        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another bullish weak for the broad Dollar and index as a bi-product, as all bar the safest of G10 havens suffer severe contagion from the EM exodus that reached fully-fledged FTQ status on Friday. In short, Usd/pairings plummeted as the LIRA and ROUBLE continued to collapse to the point of capitulation for the Try that lost 20% at one stage on the final day of the week, having succumbed to a circa 10% dump late Tuesday/early Wednesday. In extremely fast market conditions, Usd/Try got close to 7.0000 or 6.8000+ at least with only fleeting respite from rousing rhetoric from Turkish President Erdogan and his Finance Minister, but crucially no actual action. However, the final straw came from US President Trump who promptly doubled import tariffs on steel and aluminium from Turkey. Meanwhile, Usd/Rub has rallied to 67.6535 vs 63.3450 at the start of the week. Back to the DXY, 96.000 has been cleared to a fresh ytd peak at 96.313, and chart-watchers will now be eyeing 96.512 resistance ahead of a couple more upside tech levels before 97.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friday&rsquo;s major fall guys, but also among the worst non-EM performers over the week with some downbeat data and dovish RBA/ECB impulses (former via the policy meeting, commentary and SOMP, and latter from the latest bulletin) compounding the aforementioned risk-averse flows. Aud/Usd has retreated sharply from just above 0.7450 to sub-0.7300, while Eur/Usd finally breached strong support at the previous 2018 base to take about barriers and trip mega-stops to almost test 1.1400, while sliding through 1.1400 to 1.1350 vs the CHF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another big loser on a mix of ongoing Brexit jitters/uncertainty, political upheaval and BoE policy perceptions as &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; prospects increased. Cable has tumbled from just over 1.3000 to circa 1.2725 and new ytd lows, but clawed back some lost ground vs the Eur as Try woes hit the single currency harder to trade around 0.8950 vs 0.9030 at one stage, with the aid of some encouraging UK data (preliminary Q2 GDP, June trade and industrial output, plus a 0.5% NIESR forecast for Q3 growth).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another crazy week for the Loonie in terms of volatility amidst better NAFTA news and mixed data, but mainly on an escalation in tensions between Canada and Saudi Arabia, with the latter instructing investors to liquidate Canadian assets and suspending other projects on top of diplomatic measures. Usd/Cad is mid-range between 1.3120-1.2955 trading parameters, with a degree of support from the latest jobs report revealing a big headline payroll beat, but not so upbeat internals. Returning down under, the Kiwi was significantly undermined by the RBNZ that trimmed OCR forecasts out to the end of 2019 and added that while the next move could go either way, rate cut chances have risen. This, along with overall themes leaves Usd/Nzd hovering around 0.6600 vs 0.6761 at best and 0.6568 at worst, while the Aud/Nzd cross reached 1.1175 at one stage vs 1.1060 currently and 1.0950 or thereabouts at the beginning of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exception to the rule and only G10 to end the week on the up vs the Usd and other currency counterparts as the effects of BoJ policy tweaks under the guise of flexibility continued to reverberate and stronger the anticipated Japanese GDP data exacerbated the Jpy&rsquo;s allure in times of aversion to risk/safety flights. Indeed, Usd/Jpy is back below 111.00 following some choppy moves amidst huge option expiry interests layered between the big figure and 112.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCANDI/EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though firmer than forecast Swedish and Norwegian inflation data provided some protection for the Sek, and Nok especially, weak services metrics hampered the former and risk aversion in general prevented the latter from getting too carried away ahead of next week&rsquo;s Norges Bank policy meeting.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Although Thursday&rsquo;s PPIs surprised to the downside, dragged lower by softer services&rsquo; prices, the CPI release due on Friday is anticipated to come in strong. Expectations for headline CPI are for an increase of 0.2% M/M, which would bring the Y/Y figure to 3.0%; RBC notes that some mean reversion would suggest a more significant contribution to inflation is in the offing this month as shelter prices rose just 0.1% in June. The core measure is expected to remain steady at 2.3% Y/Y, the highest since the beginning of 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scotiabank expects this to be &lsquo;the strongest reading since the end of 2011&rsquo; supported by base effects and elevated oil prices. Nevertheless gasoline prices saw a modest decline of 1% in July which may subtract from the headline figure, analysts at RBC say. Since the economy is robust and advancing at a strong GDP rate of 4.1%, the sustained growth is likely to place further pressure on prices which could lead inflation to &lsquo;mildly overshoot the Fed target&rsquo;, analysts at Barclays note. Further upside risks, of cost-push nature, may originate from the recent escalation of trade tariffs between US and China, with the latest seeing China&rsquo;s implementation of 15% tariff on USD 16bln imports in response to US levies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall the CPI release should keep the Fed on track for another hike in September given the robust economic conditions in the US, BMO argues. In terms of longer term outlook, CIBC states &lsquo;there is no reason for the Fed for accelerate its rate hike path.&rsquo;</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (flat) and Hang Seng (-0.8%) traded choppy amid a lack of fresh drivers and after the PBoC refrained from operations again for a neutral position for the week. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher with demand spurred by losses in riskier assets and with the BoJ also present in the market for nearly JPY 800bln in JGBs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral for the week vs. last week&#39;s CNY 210bln net drain.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities have started the day negative (Euro Stoxx 50 -1.4%) as reports suggest the ECB is expressing concerns of a weak TRY on European banks. This is pressuring European banks as a whole (STOXX&reg; Europe 600 Banks (SX7P) -1.7%) as investors are repositioning into safe-haven assets and away from the financial sector, which is the current sector underperformer. BNP Paribas (-3.7%), BBVA (-3.3%) and UniCredit (-3.1%) are bringing up the rear of the Stoxx 600 on the back of high exposure to Turkish assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No surprise to see UK debt and STIR futures correct higher (bar the very front end of the curve) given confirmation of a weak start in EU stocks and the ongoing, albeit not so intense as it was pre-Liffe, Try-inspired safety flight. Gilts gapped up to 123.45 from yesterday&rsquo;s 123.02 settlement level, so above &lsquo;strong&rsquo; technical resistance around 123.39 from the off, and have advanced further to 123.53 for a 51 tick gain on the day before topping out, but Bunds have marginally extended their upside on Eurex to 163.13 (+63 ticks) with a bit more premium due to the latest decline in BTPs perhaps. Back to Liffe, 3 month contracts are still factoring &lsquo;dovish&rsquo; BoE policy guidance and building in potential for a reversal of the latest rate hike on rising Brexit no deal risks. Note the raft of heavyweight UK data, including preliminary Q2 GDP, June ip, manufacturing and construction output, was mixed or close to consensus and had little impact. Turning to US Treasuries, firmer and flatter not far from overnight session highs on broad risk-aversion and ahead of potentially key data in the form of CPI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY - Almost relentless selling early Friday, to the point of a full-on capital flight at one stage, saw the Lira collapse to new all time lows vs the Usd with vendors and price feeds quoting levels for the pair anywhere between 6.0000-50 in fast, if not frantic market conditions. However, some respite for the Try ahead of and after Turkish current account data that was slightly better than forecast in the event, but the focus now very much on speeches from President Erdogan (midday and 14.30BST), and more importantly the Finance Minister&rsquo;s new economic model (12.30BST).

However, some respite for the Try ahead of and after Turkish current account data that was slightly better than forecast in the event, but the focus now very much on speeches from President Erdogan (midday and 14.30BST), and more importantly the Finance Minister&rsquo;s new economic model (12.30BST).

Gilts gapped up to 123.45 from yesterday&rsquo;s 123.02 settlement level, so above &lsquo;strong&rsquo; technical resistance around 123.39 from the off, and have advanced further to 123.53 for a 51 tick gain on the day before topping out, but Bunds have marginally extended their upside on Eurex to 163.13 (+63 ticks) with a bit more premium due to the latest decline in BTPs perhaps. Back to Liffe, 3 month contracts are still factoring &lsquo;dovish&rsquo; BoE policy guidance and building in potential for a reversal of the latest rate hike on rising Brexit no deal risks. Note the raft of heavyweight UK data, including preliminary Q2 GDP, June ip, manufacturing and construction output, was mixed or close to consensus and had little impact.

Chart-wise, 110.53 represents nearest support and bids/stops are likely situated around 110.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding up better than other G10s vs the Usd circa mid-range between 0.9975-30, but forging more gains relative to the Eur just through 1.1400 as the single currency suffers from Try contagion and warnings from the ECB about Euro area banks that are especially exposed to Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/EUR/GBP/CAD/NZD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a list, and ordered by performance from worst hit to not quite so badly affected for all the well documented reasons ranging from ongoing trade wars, diplomatic sanctions and implications for the global economy/Central bank policy. Aud/Usd has slipped under 0.7300 as the YUAN loses recovery momentum, Eur/Usd tumbled through 1.1500 unceremoniously as barriers broke and stops were triggered and Cable caved through 1.2800 with little aid from mixed UK data (although a near 1 bn option expiry at the strike may help the Pound to remain off 1.2740 lows), while the Loonie is back below 1.3100 vs its US rival ahead of Canadian jobs data. The Kiwi has lost grip of 0.6600, but holding up better than its antipodean counterpart as the cross slips back below 1.1100 from 1.1175 highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RUB/SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also victims of the latest deterioration in sentiment, with the Rouble rout squeezing Usd/Rub up beyond 67.0000 before a modest pull-back, while the Scandi crowns are somewhat mixed after inflation data revealing bigger upside vs expectations from Norway compared to Sweden. Eur/Sek midway between 10.3580-4615 parameters, but Eur/Nok hugging the base of a 9.5410-5940 band.</p>\r\n",

Antipodeans were also subdued and failed to make any meaningful recovery from the recent descent in which NZD/USD tested 0.6600 to the downside in the wake of the dovish RBNZ, while AUD/USD languished after an unsurprising SOMP which reiterated the view for no near-term change in rates and lowered underlying inflation forecasts. Elsewhere, USD/JPY retreated below 111.00 and JPY-crosses extended on losses amid flows into JPY spurred by a risk averse tone and firmer than expected GDP numbers, while TRY continued to tumble and extended on fresh record lows amid the ongoing diplomatic spat related to the detained US pastor and as reports noted increasing concern at the ECB of banks&rsquo; exposure to Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA Statement on Monetary Policy reiterated that the board sees no strong case for a change in rates in the near-term and that higher rates are likely to be appropriate at some time if the economy evolves as forecast.

Elsewhere, gold was also uneventful and remained near the prior day&rsquo;s lows as the greenback remained firm, while copper mirrored the risk averse sentiment and lacklustre trade across the complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Satellite images suggested that North Korea is continuing work on a secondary cooling system at its 5MWe reactor, according to 38 North.

The yield curve bull-flattened with yields hitting session lows following the 30yr auction; 5yr yields lower by c.3bps and the 30yr yield by c.4bps. The US sold $18bln in 30yr bonds tailing by 0.3bps at a high yield of 3.09%. The bid-to-cover posted at 2.27x, below the previous auction and the 6wk average, at the lowest level since February. In terms of internals, dealers were awarded the biggest share since February, indirects were awarded shares well above the trendline whilst directs took the smallest portion since January. US 10YR T-notes settled 7 ticks higher at 119-23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Evans (Non-Voter, Dove) said the US economy is performing &lsquo;very well&rsquo; and that one or two more rate hikes is reasonable by the end of year. Evans also commented that fundamentals are &lsquo;extremely strong&rsquo; with uncertainty surrounding trade offset by business confidence following tax cuts and moves towards deregulation, while he added that he now feels inflation has returned to near the 2% target and is likely to remain there.&nbsp; Furthermore, Evans commented that debate over whether to pause or continue higher into restrictive policy to intensify the next year as they approach the neutral interest rate.

Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (-0.4%) traded choppy amid a lack of fresh drivers and after the PBoC refrained from operations again for a neutral position for the week. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher with demand spurred by losses in riskier assets and with the BoJ also present in the market for nearly JPY 800bln in JGBs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed with the region indecisive after a lacklustre lead from Wall St. where weakness in energy and financials dragged the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, while the Nasdaq just about remained afloat to notch its 8th consecutive gain. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are subdued with energy stocks weighing on Australia, while Tokyo trade fails to benefit from stronger than expected GDP numbers amid a firmer currency. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) are choppy amid a lack of fresh drivers and after the PBoC refrained from operations again for a neutral position for the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is relatively flat and takes a breather from yesterday&rsquo;s gains against its major counterparts which has kept EUR/USD and GBP/USD at the lower halves of the 1.1500 and 1.2800 handles respectively. Antipodeans are also subdued and have failed to make any meaningful recovery from the recent descent with NZD/USD now testing 0.6600 to the downside in the wake of the dovish RBNZ, while AUD/USD languishes after an unsurprising SOMP which reiterated the board sees no strong case for a near-term change in rates and lowered underlying inflation forecasts. Elsewhere, USD/JPY retreated below 111.00 and JPY-crosses extended on losses, due to flows into JPY spurred by a risk averse tone in Tokyo and firmer than expected GDP numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as riskier assets in Tokyo are pressured, while the BoJ are also present in the market for nearly JPY 800bln in JGBs. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
