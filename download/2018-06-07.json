Furthermore,&nbsp;Trump added Japan has been purchasing more defence products from the US including jets and had earlier stated he would talk with PM Abe about US buying cars from Japan, as well as the trade deficit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said they have reached a deal with China&rsquo;s ZTE, where ZTE is to pay a USD 1bln fine and put USD 400mln into an Escrow.

Furthermore, the UK government stated they do not ignore the possibility that there may be technical delays. (Newswires/Huffington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Brussels source stated EU will accept no time limit in the withdrawal agreement but noted the government can expect it by end of 2021 and that it does not commit the EU. (Sky)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Deputy Governor Ramsden said he backed the MPC view in May that ongoing tightening of policy is appropriate and that he believes that the period of subdued wage growth appears to be coming to an end. Furthermore, Ramsden also stated that persistently above target inflation and a sustained period of excess demand, would represent a failure of the MPC to meet its remit.

US President Trump later commented he would be willing to walk away from talks with North Korea, but that he does not want this to be the case and stated if talks go well he will invite Kim Jong Un to the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Pompeo said North Korea confirmed to the US its willingness to denuclearise but also commented that North Korea&#39;s programmes threaten the US.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Equity futures traded rangebound overnight but selling was observed at the US cash equity open, which was further extended amid a reported &lsquo;fat finger&rsquo; which triggered stops on US 10yr which then pressured the US equity futures amongst falling yields and a rising VIX. The Emini500 futures then consolidated around the 2760 level heading into the close. Sectors were very mixed today, with tech being the laggard, and energy being the outperformer following higher oil prices. The Nasdaq was a massive underperformer today, with semiconductor names lower after WSJ reported China is said to be ready to sign off the deal between NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Qualcomm (QCOM), with competitors such as AMD, WDC, AMAT all posting losses well in the red, among Lam Research (LRCX). SPX -0.1%, NDX -0.8%, DJI +0.4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following range-bound overnight trade, Treasuries began to rise as the North America session got underway -- contrary to the price action in Bunds (which edged lower over as European political risks abate, and the ECB prepares to signal policy normalisation next week) whose price action Treasuries have tended to track in early trade -- on the back of increasing tensions between the US and its major trade partners, ahead of the G7 summit. The Tplex got more of an aggressive bid in afternoon trade, after US President Trump once again stipulated that NK must denuclearise fully in order for any peace deal to be reached, while contentious rhetoric between trade partners continued to aid the upside, seeing Treasury futures move higher. There was a further boost to the Tplex in afternoon trade: reportedly fat fingers pushed large buy orders through in the 10yr space, eventually triggering stops, which saw yields spike lower, before paring back; the EM complex was under pressure at the time, and some suggest that CTA/momentum accounts accelerated selling of EMFX against the USD, selling equities in general (nudging the VIX higher), ultimately supporting the Treasury bid. The yield curve bull-flattened on Thursday with shorter dated yields lower by c.4bps and longer dated yields lower by c.6bps; 2s30s and 2s20s were narrower by c.2bps at settlement. US 10YR T-Notes futures (Sep 2018) settled 10 ticks higher at 119-90.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/19340/download\">here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;</strong>Equities mixed, Treasuries up, DXY down, Crude up</li>\r\n  <li><strong>* REAR-VIEW: </strong>UK backstop plan unveiled; pre-G7 contentious chatter; ZTE deal cleared; BoE&#39;s Ramsden upbeat; US weekly jobless claims inline; Treasuries mini flash crash.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>* AHEAD: G7; </strong>Japan GDP, Chinese Trade Balance overnight; Canada labour market.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* G7 SUMMIT: </strong>Canada PM Trudeau said he remains positive on the upcoming discussions at the G7 summit; trade will be discussed, though he expects disagreements, and reiterated his position that US tariffs are unacceptable. France&#39;s Macron said Trump may not care about being isolated from the summit, arguing that as a &#39;G6&#39; the group represents a &quot;real force&quot;, but Macron insisted the that US should stick with them, since they are allies. Macron also added he will call on the WTO to challenge Trump&rsquo;s trade decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US Commerce Secretary Ross reported on Thursday to have reached a deal with China&rsquo;s ZTE, where ZTE is to pay a USD 1bln fine and put USD 400mln into an Escrow. Previously, sources suggested ZTE has signed an agreement in principle with the US that would lift commerce department ban and the US is to claim approx. USD 1.7bln against ZTE. Note that on Wednesday NEC Director Kudlow stated a deal has not been reached on either side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BOE Deputy Governor Ramsden said he backed the MPC view in May that ongoing tightening of policy is appropriate. He added that inflation remains persistently above target, and a sustained period of excess demand would represent a failure of the MPC to meet its remit. He believes that the period of subdued wage growth appears to be coming to an end. The MPC&#39;s view that UK GDP slowdown in early 2018 was temporary appears to have been borne out by recent data, Ramsden says, and he expects the UK to resume steady but unspectacular growth. He noted MPC view is contingent on data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> US President Trump said the summit with North Korea is ready to go ahead on 12 June, though added sanctions on the nation cannot be lifted. Trump once again stipulated that there will be no deal with North Korea unless it denuclearises. The US President does not believe the meeting will be a &#39;single meeting affair&#39;, which suggests further talks will take place if the initial discussions prove productive. In later trade, at the press conference with Japan PM Abe, US President Trump said to be working on strengthening trade relationship with Japan, noting that Japan has been purchasing more defence products, including jets, from the US and will invest more in the country. The main focus of the meeting fell was on the situation with North Korea ahead of the summit in Singapore, with both leaders agreeing that they are ready to help the region, if North Korea takes the right steps after the talks. The US President also stated an agreement could be signed with Kim on the summit in Singapore, noting the US would certainly like to see normalisation of ties with North Korea. He also emphasized that maximum pressure still in effect in North Korea and Abe confirms the statement. Finally, he warned he would be willing to walk away from talks with North Korea, but he does not want this to be the case. In late trade, reports in SCMP stated that China has reportedly moved or hidden missile systems from the disputed South China Sea island, according to satellite imagery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, US Commerce Secretary Ross said he doesn&#39;t think the US will grant sanction relief to Iran. And ahead of the G7 meeting, NATO Chief Stoltenberg said that European NATO members as well as Canada will raise defence budgets to 3.8% of GDP in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RIKSBANK:</strong> Deputy Governor Jochnick said the central bank would like to see development in underlying inflation before hiking rates. She added if rates are raised too fast, there is a risk the inflation target won&#39;t be reached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK Prime Minister Theresa May was said to have avoided an immediate political crisis, after the government published its long-awaited plan that keeps the UK tied to the EU&rsquo;s customs rules through the end of 2021. Agreeing a customs agreement is crucial hurdle the UK faces, and the plan aims to ensure that there will be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland post-Brexit (which was a condition of the Good Friday Agreement). EU Brexit negotiator Barnier said he would examine the proposals, reiterating that they must respect the integrity of the single market, and have a &lsquo;workable solution&rsquo; to the Irish border issue. EU Parliament&rsquo;s Brexit chief Verhofstadt was more forceful, saying that the latest plan was not a &lsquo;workable solution&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>US Weekly Jobless Claims were in line with expectations at 222k (vs consensus 223k). The recent trend seems to be around 220k, a new low for the cycle, analysts at Pantheon said, and that companies are afraid to lay off workers as they believe their replacement will be difficult. Claims are likely to fall even further given GDP growth for this year is to be above 3%, the consultancy believes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* SPX -0.09%, NDX -0.79%, DJI +0.35%.&nbsp;SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +0.36%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.33%, Energy: +1.54%, Financials: +0.25%, Health Care: -0.16%, Industrials: 0.00%, Materials: -0.55%, Telecoms: +1.09%, Tech: %, Utilities: +0.36%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Equity futures traded rangebound overnight but selling was observed at the US cash equity open, which was further extended amid a reported &lsquo;fat finger&rsquo; which triggered stops on US 10yr which then pressured the US equity futures amongst falling yields and a rising VIX.&nbsp;The Emini500 futures then consolidated around the 2760 level heading into the close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sectors were very mixed today, with tech being the laggard, and energy being the outperformer following higher oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nasdaq was a massive underperformer today, with semiconductor names lower after WSJ reported China is said to be ready to sign off the deal between NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Qualcomm (QCOM), with competitors such as AMD, WDC, AMAT all posting losses well in the red, among Lam Research (LRCX).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Stock Specifics: Lam Research (LRCX) one of the largest underperformers in the SPX today following a cautious note from Evercore which stated risks to the company&rsquo;s Q2 and Q3 shipments, but does only see this pause a temporary one, and maintained its outperform target of USD 300. JM Smucker (SJM) also underperformed on Thursday following a poor earnings reports, where EPS missed estimates by 25c, and revenue was just slightly short of the consensus. SJM issued guidance for FY19, which was also below analyst expectations. The stocks which tried to keep the SPX in the green saw Allergan (AGN) amongst outperformers as Carl Icahn took a small stake in the name after it announced it has plans to spin off its women health unit following pressure from activist investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; M&amp;A NEWS:</strong> Following ZTE deal with the US, WSJ reported China is said to be ready to sign off on the Qualcomm (QCOM) / NXPI Semiconductors (NXPI) deal. Also, Fujifilm&rsquo;s CEO claimed he could walk away from the deal with Xerox (XRX) if there is no progress in discussion.&nbsp; Fortive (FTV) made an offer to acquire Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s (JNJ) Advanced Sterilisation products unit for roughly USD 2.7bln in cash, JNJ have 120 days to decide upon the offer. Financial times reported AIG&rsquo;s (AIG) CEO stated in an interview they have agreed to acquire Validus (VR) for USD 5.6bln and that it is looking to expand its life and retirement division overseas. AmTrust Financial (AFSI) agreed to be bought by a group of investors for USD 2.95bln, higher than the previous offer of USD 2.7bln. Carl Icahn who holds a 9.4% stake in the co. was opposed to this originally, but did accept under the new terms, he also supports AFSI&rsquo;s decision to go private. Finally, Taylor Morrison (TMHC) announced it is to acquire AV Homes (AVHI for USD 21.50/shr.&nbsp; During Trade, reports suggested the US DoJ is probing the T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) merger because on pricing in the wireless wholesale market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (JULY 18) SETTLE USD 1.22 HIGHER AT USD 65.95/BBL, BRENT FUTURES (AUGUST 18) SETTLE USD 1.96 HIGHER AT USD 77.32/BBL. </strong>Oil edged higher on Thursday, shrugging off the unexpected build in DoEs and last week&rsquo;s increase in oil rig counts, amid concerns of a sharp drop in Venezuelan oil output as the economic crisis in the country is posing a threat to state-run PDVSA. The oil producer warned to declare force majeure as it is struggling to meet oil demand from its customers. The crisis in Venezuela comes in at a time when OPEC is looking to ease production cuts in order to replace Iran&rsquo;s output and remove some pressure from oil prices. In news flow, sources reported US President Trump requested oil support from Saudi ahead of the Iran nuclear deal decision, with Saudi saying there was no need to raise output but <strong>then shifted its position following a phone call. Russia&#39;s Finance Ministry proposed to lift maximum level of export duty for light oil products to 90% of the oil duty.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) SETTLED 10 TICKS HIGHER AT 119-90.</strong> Following range-bound overnight trade, Treasuries began to rise as the North America session got underway -- contrary to the price action in Bunds (which edged lower over as European political risks abate, and the ECB prepares to signal policy normalisation next week) whose price action Treasuries have tended to track in early trade -- on the back of increasing tensions between the US and its major trade partners, ahead of the G7 summit. The Tplex got more of an aggressive bid in afternoon trade, after US President Trump once again stipulated that NK must denuclearise fully in order for any peace deal to be reached, while contentious rhetoric between trade partners continued to aid the upside, seeing Treasury futures move higher. There was a further boost to the Tplex in afternoon trade: reportedly fat fingers pushed large buy orders through in the 10yr space, eventually triggering stops, which saw yields spike lower, before paring back; the EM complex was under pressure at the time, and some suggest that CTA/momentum accounts accelerated selling of EMFX against the USD, selling equities in general (nudging the VIX higher), ultimately supporting the Treasury bid. The yield curve bull-flattened on Thursday with shorter dated yields lower by c.4bps and longer dated yields lower by c.6bps; 2s30s and 2s20s were narrower by c.2bps at settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FX:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD, EUR: </strong>The dollar index dropped in overnight trade towards 93.20, before gradually rising through the course of European/US trade, though still closes out the session in the red, with the 93.50 region proving stubborn; concerns about US international isolation ahead of the G7 summit was being cited. The EUR side of the equation strongly contributed to the USD weakness; the driving force was with this week&rsquo;s ECB sources story that the GC will discuss an exit from its QE programme followed up by hawkish ECB speak yesterday before the &lsquo;blackout period&rsquo; ahead of next week&rsquo;s policy meeting. Thursday trade saw a breach of 1.18, and the pair remains at&nbsp;the level heading into APAC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY: </strong>A bout of risk contributed to EURJPY and USDJPY downside in afternoon trade, brought on by a wave of selling in EMFX; there was a bounce in late trade amid headlines from Japan PM Abe, who pledged the Japanese would invest more in the US, and the nations were looking to improve trade ties &ndash; a welcome positive development amid generally negative trade newsflow. Buying support was seen around 109.50, though the 200dma at 110.20 caps the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD:</strong> Weak trade data overnight set the tone, and the Aussie remained offered in North America trade, with havens catching a bit, and high beta risk FX losing out. With that said, the 0.76 area is holding up, and there is a feeling of congestion ahead of the figure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling struggled to take advantage of the USD weakness, though doggedly remains above 1.34, perhaps supported by decent home prices data. While Brexit news flow whipsawed the currency, ultimately, the next catalyst for the direction of the pair will be determined by the EU Withdrawal Bill vote in Parliament next Tuesday, and the EU summit at the end of the month. EURGBP was also getting a bounce as Italian-related EUR shorts continue to cover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EMFX: </strong>The complex was whacked on Thursday, almost negating some of the interventions and policy moves EM policymakers have undertaken to stabilise their currencies, and consequently, price pressures. CBT hiked rates in a continued effort to tackling inflation pressures, and while USDTRY is significantly down on the day (LOD beneath 4.46, HOD around 4.58), we trade in the middle of the range heading into the APAC session. The BCB was intervening in FX again on Thursday, with today&rsquo;s level reported to be around 3.90 (you&rsquo;ll recall it attempted a defence of 3.80 earlier in the week). USDZAR was nearly 2.5% higher &ndash; South Africa has notable external dollar funding pressures, and the notion that the FOMC will likely lift rates next week, and by extension yields too, is heaping pressure (ARS and TRY are the other EMFX traders are watching, given high USD-debt exposure). MXN was also caught up in the EM rout, not helped by AMLO extending his lead in recent polls, as well as NAFTA negotiations hitting the buffers once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The crisis in Venezuela comes in at a time when OPEC is looking to ease production cuts in order to replace Iran&rsquo;s output and remove some pressure from oil prices. In news flow, sources reported US President Trump requested oil support from Saudi ahead of the Iran nuclear deal decision, with Saudi saying there was no need to raise output but then shifted its position following a phone call. Russia&#39;s Finance Ministry proposed to lift maximum level of export duty for light oil products to 90% of the oil duty.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Brexit back in the driving seat for GBP. EUR still supported by ECB expectations. Focus to turn to G7",
        "content": "<p>GBP was a key source of focus for FX markets today as Brexit headlines returned with a vengeance after taking more of a backseat to the BoE and domestic data over the past few weeks. GBP was initially resilient to the reports of clashes between UK PM May and Brexit Secretary Davis with GBP/USD breaching 1.3450 to the upside and eyeing May 22nd highs at 1.3492. However, optimism for GBP proved to be short-lived as markets began to take a more cynical view on proceedings. In summary, Davis refrained from resigning after forcing UK PM May to &lsquo;fudge&rsquo; her backstop proposal be stating that the government &lsquo;expects&rsquo; the temporary customs union to cease by the end of 2021. Commentary was mixed on who was the actual victor out of May and Davis but ultimately, the Tory in-fighting did little to appease investor concern or raise expectations that the UK will be able to present the EU with a suitable solution; subsequently GBP wiped out the earlier gains with a GBP/USD low print for the session at 1.3377.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the broader FX sphere, USD lost further ground on an index basis with the DXY lower by around -0.2% and back below 93.50. This was largely a by-product of the firmer EUR as positioning ahead of next week&rsquo;s &lsquo;live&rsquo; ECB meeting remains the dominant force. Subsequently EUR/USD reclaimed 1.1800 to the upside and breached the 30DMA at 1.1818 with ECB speakers now in their blackout period. USD also gave up initial gains against the JPY as USD/JPY gave back the 110.00 level after running into resistance at the 200DMA (110.19) with the pair largely tracking the broader risk sentiment. Bucking the trend against the USD was the CAD which was marginally softer against the greenback after NEC Director Kudlow poured cold water over the reports that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin requested exemptions for Canada is &lsquo;patently false&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of central bank activity, the CBRT provided some support for the TRY after the central bank unexpectedly hiked its one-week repo rate by 125bps to 17.75%. Capital Economics note that the decision was &ldquo;a tentative sign that it is shifting its focus away from simply shoring up the lira and towards tackling high and rising inflation. The key now is whether more orthodox policymaking lasts beyond this month&rsquo;s election. If President Erdogan emerges victorious and renews his calls for lower interest rates, the lira would sell-off and (ironically) strengthen the case for further rate hikes&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus going forward will likely turn towards the G7 (G6+1) meeting in Canada which could stoke further international tensions with US President Trump set to be grilled on his confrontational stance on trade. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) both opened higher on the tailwind from Wall St and with commodity related sectors leading Australia higher, while the Japanese benchmark continued to benefit as the recent weak JPY-risk appetite dynamic remained intact despite the currency attempting to nurse losses overnight. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. b and Hang Seng (+0.8%) conformed to the optimism seen across global stock markets with trade concerns placed on the back burner, although gains in the mainland were capped following a net drain by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially lacklustre amid similar price action in T-notes and due to the broad appetite for risk, although prices later saw mild gains on reopen from the break and following an enhanced liquidity auction in the super-long end which attracted a higher b/c than prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Mofcom reiterated China doesn&#39;t want trade tensions with US to escalate and that China is willing to raise imports from US and other countries. Furthermore, Mofcom stated some specific progress was made in just completed trade talks with US which included discussions on agriculture and energy.

Furthermore, Kudlow also commented that there are currently no deals with China and that no decision has been reached on both sides for ZTE. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May and Brexit Secretary Davis reported to be at loggerheads regarding EU customs split, which sparked some rumours that Davis was close to resigning, according to reports. (The Sun) however, the latest reports have suggested no Cabinet resignations are to be tendered today. (BBC) Further to this Kuenssberg added that &ldquo;more clarity&rdquo; will be provided on the time limit on the backstop later in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House will vote on rescission package today.

(Washington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is said to be planning on adopting a confrontational tone at G7 in response to the other 6 nations collectively pressuring him regarding tariffs. In related news, France joined Germany in warning US President Trump that they will not sign a joint statement at the G7 summit, with President Macron stating that progress must be made on tariffs, Iran agreement and Paris climate accord for him to be willing to sign a joint statement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equities followed suit from Asia with all the major bourses opening firmly in the green (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.4%) with broad-based gains across all indices. UK&rsquo;s FTSE failed to open with its peers due to a technical glitch, trading resumed at 0900BST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financials lead the gains as banks surge, boosted by rising yields on speculation the ECB may soon start to wind down stimulus, with the first discussions signalled to start at the monetary policy meeting next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of individual movers, Remy Cointreau shares are eyeing losses of 6% despite reporting strong numbers as investors show concern over flat dividend and valuation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD remains on the back foot (DXY -0.3%) as EUR strength and jitters ahead of the G7 meeting this weekend hampers the greenback. With regards to the G7, some traders might opt to take a cautious view on the USD amid the latest reports that US President Trump is said to be planning on adopting a confrontational tone at G7 in response to the other 6 nations collectively pressuring him regarding tariffs. Nonetheless, the broader risk tone has seen the USD out-muscle the JPY with USD/JPY approaching 110.00 to the upside where there is 2bln of option expiries is due to roll-off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a EUR perspective, EUR/USD losses from the unexpected contractionary German factory orders proved to be short-lived as positioning ahead of next week&rsquo;s &lsquo;live&rsquo; ECB meeting remains the dominant force. Subsequently EUR/USD has reclaimed 1.1800 to the upside and breached the 30DMA at 1.1818 with ECB speakers now in their blackout period. BNP Paribas look for EUR/USD at 1.23 in the next 3-months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, GBP was initially resilient to some of the latest Brexit-related turmoil. GBP/USD reclaimed 1.3450 to the upside in early trade before traders began selling GBP ahead of the US entrance to market despite news that there are to be no resignations in the Cabinet. Sentiment may have soured for the GBP as it remains unclear what concessions (if any) May might have been forced to make to Davis and the Brexiteers in order to avoid mutiny.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a NAFTA perspective, CAD is unable to benefit from the broadly softer USD after NEC Director Kudlow poured cold water over the reports that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin requested exemptions for Canada is &lsquo;patently false&rsquo;. Kudlow also stated there will be discussions on trade at G7 meeting as well as a bilateral meeting with Canadian PM Trudeau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus going forward will likely fall on TRY ahead of the CBRT rate decision with consensus looking for the Bank to stand pat on its one week-repo rate at 16.5%. Capital Economics suggests that the recent appreciation of the TRY following the central bank&rsquo;s emergency rate hike and tweaking of its policy framework suggests that the CBT will stand pat, but concedes that there is marginal risks of a rate rise, particularly so given its recent tough talk and an emphasis on tackling high, unanchored inflation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the fixed income space, paper continues to be dominated by the fallout of the recent activity surrounding the ECB ahead of next week&rsquo;s meeting as discussed above. Subsequently, Bunds have extended their decline back below 160.00 ahead of the ECB&rsquo;s blackout period. BTPs initially diverged from their core counterparts amid a continuation of the IT/GE spread tightening play before falling back into line with EU paper. This morning also saw supply from Spain and France hit the market; both of which were relatively well received. However, IFR suggest that the amount of French duration could eventually weigh on paper at some stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are mostly higher on the day, with Oil +0.6%, extending the reprieve following a dip on yesterday&rsquo;s surprise DoE crude stockpile build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope Gold is marginally positive on tailwinds offered by a weaker USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copper has hit 2018 highs, with gains for the 6th straight session, as supply concerns are being exacerbated through Chilean mine disruption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steel futures have hit 6-month highs as environmental inspections have slowed suggestions of a supply glut in China and boosted market sentiment</p>\r\n",

UK&rsquo;s FTSE failed to open with its peers due to a technical glitch, trading resumed at 0900BST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financials lead the gains as banks surge, boosted by rising yields on speculation the ECB may soon start to wind down stimulus, with the first discussions signalled to start at the monetary policy meeting next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Material names are showing a strong performance, buoyed by stronger base metal prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of individual movers, Remy Cointreau shares are eyeing losses of 5% despite reporting strong numbers as investors show concern over flat dividend and valuation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD remains on the back foot (DXY -0.3%) as EUR strength and jitters ahead of the G7 meeting this weekend hampers the greenback. With regards to the G7, some traders might opt to take a cautious view on the USD amid the latest reports that US President Trump is said to be planning on adopting a confrontational tone at G7 in response to the other 6 nations collectively pressuring him regarding tariffs. Nonetheless, the broader risk tone has seen the USD out-muscle the JPY with USD/JPY approaching 110.00 to the upside where there is 2bln of option expiries is due to roll-off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a EUR perspective, EUR/USD losses from the unexpected contractionary German factory orders proved to be short-lived as positioning ahead of next week&rsquo;s &lsquo;live&rsquo; ECB meeting remains the dominant force. Subsequently EUR/USD has reclaimed 1.1800 to the upside and breached the 30DMA at 1.1818 with ECB speakers now in their blackout period. BNP Paribas look for EUR/USD at 1.23 in the next 3-months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, GBP is remaining relatively resilient to some of the latest Brexit-related turmoil. GBP/USD has reclaimed 1.3450 to the upside and is eyeing some of the highs seen around late May at 1.3492 as traders await updates on how May and Davis will realign their differences regarding the UK&rsquo;s backstop options with some commentators suggesting that Davis could step down from his position. Should this materialise, serious doubts will be raised over the sustainability of May&rsquo;s position and a potential leadership challenge. If the Conservative Party are forced to elect a new leader; it is plausible that a more hard-lined Brexiteer will take the helm and set the UK up for more friction with the EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a NAFTA perspective, CAD is unable to benefit from the broadly softer USD after NEC Director Kudlow poured cold water over the reports that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin requested exemptions for Canada is &lsquo;patently false&rsquo;. Kudlow also stated there will be discussions on trade at G7 meeting as well as a bilateral meeting with Canadian PM Trudeau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus going forward will likely fall on TRY ahead of the CBRT rate decision with consensus looking for the Bank to stand pat on its one week-repo rate at 16.5%. Capital Economics suggests that the recent appreciation of the TRY following the central bank&rsquo;s emergency rate hike and tweaking of its policy framework suggests that the CBT will stand pat, but concedes that there is marginal risks of a rate rise, particularly so given its recent tough talk and an emphasis on tackling high, unanchored inflation</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the fixed income space, paper continues to be dominated by the fallout of the recent activity surrounding the ECB ahead of next week&rsquo;s meeting as discussed above. Subsequently, Bunds have extended their decline back below 160.00 ahead of the ECB&rsquo;s blackout period. BTPs have diverged from their core counterparts with BTPs higher by circa 50 ticks as the IT/GE spread tightens further with Italian paper also outperforming some of its peripheral counterparts. This morning also saw supply from Spain and France hit the market; both of which were relatively well received. However, IFR suggest that the amount of French duration could eventually weigh on paper at some stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are mostly higher on the day, with Oil +0.3%, extending the reprieve following a dip on yesterday&rsquo;s surprise DoE crude stockpile build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope Gold is marginally positive on tailwinds offered by a weaker USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copper has hit 2018 highs, with gains for the 6th straight session, as supply concerns are being exacerbated through Chilean mine disruption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steel futures have hit 6-month highs as environmental inspections have slowed suggestions of a supply glut in China and boosted market sentiment.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "FX MORNING COLOUR: USD softer ahead of G7. ECB expectations continue to be readjusted. GBP holding steady against latest political turmoil",
        "content": "<p>USD remains on the back foot (DXY -0.3%) as EUR strength and jitters ahead of the G7 meeting this weekend hampers the greenback. With regards to the G7, some traders might opt to take a cautious view on the USD amid the latest reports that US President Trump is said to be planning on adopting a confrontational tone at G7 in response to the other 6 nations collectively pressuring him regarding tariffs. Nonetheless, the broader risk tone has seen the USD out-muscle the JPY with USD/JPY approaching 110.00 to the upside where there is 2bln of option expiries is due to roll-off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a EUR perspective, EUR/USD losses from the unexpected contractionary German factory orders proved to be short-lived as positioning ahead of next week&rsquo;s &lsquo;live&rsquo; ECB meeting remains the dominant force. Subsequently EUR/USD has reclaimed 1.1800 to the upside and breached the 30DMA at 1.1818 with ECB speakers now in their blackout period. BNP Paribas look for EUR/USD at 1.23 in the next 3-months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, GBP is remaining relatively resilient to some of the latest Brexit-related turmoil. GBP/USD has reclaimed 1.3450 to the upside and is eyeing some of the highs seen around late May at 1.3492 as traders await updates on how May and Davis will realign their differences regarding the UK&rsquo;s backstop options with some commentators suggesting that Davis could step down from his position. Should this materialise, serious doubts will be raised over the sustainability of May&rsquo;s position and a potential leadership challenge. If the Conservative Party are forced to elect a new leader; it is plausible that a more hard-lined Brexiteer will take the helm and set the UK up for more friction with the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a NAFTA perspective, CAD is unable to benefit from the broadly softer USD after NEC Director Kudlow poured cold water over the reports that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin requested exemptions for Canada is &lsquo;patently false&rsquo;. Kudlow also stated there will be discussions on trade at G7 meeting as well as a bilateral meeting with Canadian PM Trudeau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus going forward will likely fall on TRY ahead of the CBRT rate decision with consensus looking for the Bank to stand pat on its one week-repo rate at 16.5%. Capital Economics suggests that the recent appreciation of the TRY following the central bank&rsquo;s emergency rate hike and tweaking of its policy framework suggests that the CBT will stand pat, but concedes that there is marginal risks of a rate rise, particularly so given its recent tough talk and an emphasis on tackling high, unanchored inflation</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks traded higher as the regional bourses took impetus from the gains in their US counterparts in which the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq notched a 4th consecutive win streak, while the DJIA atoned for Tuesday&rsquo;s underperformance and led the advances to surmount the 25K level. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) both opened higher on the tailwind from Wall St and with commodity related sectors leading Australia higher, while the Japanese benchmark continued to benefit as the recent weak JPY-risk appetite dynamic remained intact despite the currency attempting to nurse losses overnight. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) and Hang Seng (+0.7%) conformed to the optimism seen across global stock markets with trade concerns placed on the back burner, although gains in the mainland were capped following a net drain by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially lacklustre amid similar price action in T-notes and due to the broad appetite for risk, although prices later saw mild gains on reopen from the break and following an enhanced liquidity auction in the super-long end which attracted a higher b/c than prior.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade higher as the regional bourses take impetus from the gains in their US counterparts in which the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq notched a 4th consecutive win streak, while the DJIA atoned for Tuesday&rsquo;s underperformance and led the advances to surmount the 25K level. ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) both opened higher on the tailwind from Wall St and with commodity related sectors leading Australia higher, while the Japanese benchmark continues to benefit as the recent weak JPY &ndash; risk appetite dynamic remains intact despite the currency attempting to nurse losses overnight. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (+0.8%) conform to the optimism seen across global stock markets with trade concerns placed on the back burner, although gains in the mainland have been capped following a net drain by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD is weaker with the DXY index around the 93.50 level to the benefit of its major counterparts with EUR/USD eyeing 1.1800 to the upside ahead of next week&rsquo;s &lsquo;live&rsquo; ECB meeting, while GBP/USD is also firmer after support held at 1.3400. Elsewhere, mild profit taking is seen in USD/JPY and JPY-crosses following this week&rsquo;s gains, with AUD/JPY leading the pullback as AUD underperforms in a delayed reaction to the slightly narrower than expected Australian Trade Surplus and contraction in Exports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lacklustre amid similar price action in T-notes due to the broad improved risk appetite, while an enhanced liquidity auction in the super-long end also keeps demand side-lined.</p>\r\n",
