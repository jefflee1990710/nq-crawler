However, the index really needs rebound firmly above 90.000 to mount a sustainable recovery and turn the tech outlook around from bearish. The Loonie maintains gains vs the Greenback, albeit a slender advantage on the back of stronger than expected Canadian manufacturing sales. USDCAD is hovering just below 1.2550 having briefly breached last Wednesday&rsquo;s low (at 1.2540 vs 1.2545), with the next big event looming tomorrow in the form of the BoC policy meeting. No changes expected given ongoing NAFTA/global trade uncertainty, but with options indicating another hefty break-even of 120 pips and some hefty expiry interest lying between 1.2585-1.2600 in 2.1 bn. The biggest loser and underperformer, with USDCHF up to 0.9650+ while EURCHF extended its rally through 1.1900 to circa 1.1945 and close to the 1.2000 floor that was pulled by the SNB back in January 2015. Aside from any official intervention, Russia liquidating Swiss assets is still touted as a major factor. Another G10 laggard ahead with the Kiwi only just hovering around 0.7340 vs the USD and keeping tabs on 1.0600 vs the AUD ahead of Q1 CPI data on Wednesday that is seen mixed (firmer q/q, but weaker in y/y terms). Note, only a modest reaction and uptick on the latest GDT auction showing a 2.6% increase in prices and 0.6% rise in whole milk. Not quite architects of their own downfall but undermined by weak data and survey releases (UK labour/wages and German ZEW expectations respectively). Cable is struggling to retain 1.4300 having registered a new post-Brexit vote high and approaching 1.4400 barriers, while EURUSD is back above its 55 DMA at 1.2365 from 1.2400+ at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said yesterday&#39;s Trump tweet was a warning to Russia and China on FX devaluation, Trump wants to ensure China does not devalue its currency as it has in the past.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAFTA nations are not in position to say, at this point, that any more chapters have been closed, according to Canada Government sources who add Washington meeting on Thursday is unlikely to produce any kind of announcement.

(Newswires)<br />US Manufacturing Output MM (Mar) 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.1% (Prev. 1.3%, Rev. 1.5%)<br />US Housing Starts Number (Mar) 1.319M vs. Exp. 1.269M (Prev. 1.236M, Rev. 1.295M)<br />US Building Permits: Number (Mar) 1.354M vs. Exp. 1.330M (Prev. 1.321M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures had a gradual, upward bias in pre-market trade, but struggled with resistance just beneath the 2700, keeping the S&amp;P 500 Emini in a tight range between 2690 and 2700. As cash trading got underway, the Emini pushed ahead but quickly ran into the next hurdle ahead of 2710, and after failing to negotiate the level, backed-off and consolidated underneath 2710. In late trade, the Emini did breach 2710 to the upside. Despite earnings season now being underway, and a fair amount of equity-specific news, Emini volume levels remained subdued on Tuesday. And earnings dominated Tuesday&rsquo;s session with Netflix (NFLX) outperforming the SPX and NDX, after it added subscribers beating the Street&rsquo;s estimates. Toy names hampered the NDX (Hasbro (HAS) &amp; Mattel (MAT)) which were among the worst performers as bankrupt Toys &lsquo;R&rsquo; Us ruled-out an offer to keep some of its US and Canadian stores open. General Electric (GE) and UnitedHealth (UNH) were among top performers in the DJI, as GE is looking for opportunities in the bio technology field and looking to expand into medicine and cell therapies, as well as cancer treatments and vaccines. UNH boosted by a strong earnings report, beating both top and bottom line expectations and also raising guidance. On the negative side, Goldman Sachs (GS) at the bottom of the DJI despite a strong earnings report as well as decent trading revenue, GS initially opened higher but closed in the red as it halted its share repurchase programme. SPX +1.06% at 2706, NDX +2.12% at 6816, DJI +0.87% at 24786.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amid thin volume on Tuesday, US Treasuries saw selling pressure at the short-end of the curve, which pushed 2yr yields up to fresh cyclical highs. However, the rest of the curve found buyers, particularly the long-end, where 30yr yields fell by c.3bps at settlement, and causing 2s30s to narrow to cyclical lows c.60bps. Most other major curves narrowed on the session with attention also on the 5s30s which was another that saw cyclical lows on Tuesday c.32bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 3 ticks higher at 120-18.</p>\r\n",

A slightly more positive development was the news that North and South Korea are discussing an announcement of a permanent end to military conflict. President Trump said the North and South &ldquo;have my blessing&rdquo; to end their war, adding that he hopes for a summit with Kim Jon Un, though it is possible it might not take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS:</strong> NEC Director Kudlow on Tuesday said that the Chinese were offering a &ldquo;constructive&rdquo; tone with regards to trade disputes, and referring to Trump&rsquo;s tweets on Monday, said that the President was not trying to engage in trade wars. Kudlow also said that the US continues to mull additional sanctions on Russia in response to the chemical weapons attack in Syria, contrary to some press reports on Monday. China is reported to be prepared and ready to start trade countermeasures against the US in response to earlier reports stating the US Trade Representative was gathering new trade complaint against Chinese high-tech services. China&rsquo;s International Trade Representative will meet EU ambassadors to seek support over US protectionism. Elsewhere, after dodging being labelled an FX manipulator by the US, India has filed a WTO complaint against the US, demanding compensation for steel and aluminium tariffs (the EU and China have sought compensation for the same issue). In the context of NAFTA, Canadian government sources reported that the three nations are not in a position to say at this point that any more chapters have been closed or agreed on, warning that the meeting in Washington on Thursday is unlikely to provide any announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong>&nbsp;Fed&rsquo;s <strong>Williams</strong> (voter, hawk, soon to be NY Fed President) largely reiterated his monetary policy views, suggesting a course of gradual hikes is appropriate. Williams&rsquo; view on the US economy was positive, and sees inflation returning to target and the labour market continuing to strengthen. Williams sees the fed funds rate between 3%-4% by 2020 (Fed dots indicate 3.4%), and also sees wage pressure building and believes this will continue and sees productivity growth remaining low over the next 5-10 years. Elsewhere, Williams warned on the potential of negative impacts if a full-blown trade war were seen. Fed&rsquo;s <strong>Bostic</strong> (voter, dove) is set to speak after hours. <strong>Fed&rsquo;s Harker</strong> (non-voter, dovish) noted that labour market conditions are tight. <strong>Fed&rsquo;s Evans</strong> (non-voter, dove) showed a slight tilt of tone by noting interest rates can be gradually raised without risk of a surge in inflation, which he sees moving towards the 2% target. He also added that global growth is picking up, although trade remains an uncertainty. The <strong>Fed&rsquo;s discount rate minutes</strong> said regional Fed directors saw tight labour markets, rising wages, and solid economic conditions, with some noting uncertainty around the impact of US tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOJ: </strong>In Japan, <strong>BOJ sources</strong> reported that the central bank will most likely stick with their forecast that inflation will hit 2% during the next FY in next week&#39;s quarterly review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PBOC:</strong> <strong>China&rsquo;s PBoC </strong>cut its Required Reserve Ratio for some banks by 100bps as of April 25th; funds will be used to pay back medium-term lending facility to the PBoC, which said it will maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy. The operation will boost liquidity conditions by around CNY 400bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>In Europe, <strong>ECB&rsquo;s Hansson</strong> (hawk) is confident on inflation developments. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>US industrial production</strong> beat expectations (0.5% MM vs 0.3% exp), while manufacturing output was in line with expectations (+0.1% MM), mainly boosted by a rise in utilities output as the weather improved. Analysts said that, combined with survey evidence, the health of the manufacturing sector was positive, and the outlook is bright, though some warn that there are signs of peaking ahead. <strong>US housing starts </strong>and<strong> building permits </strong>both beat expectations, though analysts warn about volatility in the data, particularly in the multi-family sector. <strong>Global Dairy Trade</strong> price index rose 2.7%, and whole milk powder prices rose 0.9%, in line with what futures were indicating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES:</strong> <strong>SPX +1.06% at 2706, NDX +2.12% at 6816, DJI +0.87% at 24786 // SECTORS: CONS CYC (XLY): +1.64%, CONS NON-CYC (XLP): +0.47%, ENERGY (XLE): +0.78%, FINANCIALS (XLF): +0.40%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +0.88%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): +1.03%, MATERIALS (XLB): +1.32%, TECH (XLK): +2.59%, TELECOMS (XTL): +0.24%, UTLITIES (XLU): +1.22%.</strong> US equity futures had a gradual, upward bias in pre-market trade, but struggled with resistance just beneath the 2700, keeping the S&amp;P 500 Emini in a tight range between 2690 and 2700. As cash trading got underway, the Emini pushed ahead but quickly ran into the next hurdle ahead of 2710, and after failing to negotiate the level, backed-off and consolidated underneath 2710. In late trade, the Emini did breach 2710 to the upside. Despite earnings season now being underway, and a fair amount of equity-specific news, Emini volume levels remained subdued on Tuesday.<strong> </strong>And earnings dominated Tuesday&rsquo;s session with Netflix (NFLX) outperforming the SPX and NDX, after it added subscribers beating the Street&rsquo;s estimates. Toy names hampered the NDX (Hasbro (HAS) &amp; Mattel (MAT)) which were among the worst performers as bankrupt Toys &lsquo;R&rsquo; Us ruled-out an offer to keep some of its US and Canadian stores open. General Electric (GE) and UnitedHealth (UNH) were among top performers in the DJI, as GE is looking for opportunities in the bio technology field and looking to expand into medicine and cell therapies, as well as cancer treatments and vaccines. UNH boosted by a strong earnings report, beating both top and bottom line expectations and also raising guidance. On the negative side, Goldman Sachs (GS) at the bottom of the DJI despite a strong earnings report as well as decent trading revenue, GS initially opened higher but closed in the red as it halted its share repurchase programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*TREASURIES:</strong> <strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 3 ticks higher at 120-18.</strong> Amid thin volume on Tuesday, US Treasuries saw selling pressure at the short-end of the curve, which pushed 2yr yields up to fresh cyclical highs. However, the rest of the curve found buyers, particularly the long-end, where 30yr yields fell by c.3bps at settlement, and causing 2s30s to narrow to cyclical lows c.60bps. Most other major curves narrowed on the session with attention also on the 5s30s which was another that saw cyclical lows on Tuesday c.32bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI future settles up 30 cents at USD 66.52, Brent futures settle up 16 cents at USD 71.58. </strong>Oil prices steadied on Tuesday as geopolitical fear in the Middle East faded, ahead of the Tuesday&rsquo;s API weekly inventories release (expectations: crude -1.4mln, Cushing -1.2mln, gasoline -0.2mln, distillates -0.3mln). With that said, NEC Director Kudlow leaned against reports yesterday which suggested that the US had ruled-out further sanctions on Russia; Kudlow on Tuesday said that further sanctions remained under consideration. Traders are also awaiting tomorrow&rsquo;s OPEC monitoring committee meeting where members are to discuss oil production cuts for 2019. News flow was limited to Russia&#39;s Energy Minister Novak stating that a bilateral deal on oil supplies between Russia and Iran could be extended for another five years, while traders continued to cite the positive comments from the Kuwaiti oil minister on Monday (who said that OPEC was considering a supply cut extension beyond 2018). While some question whether such a deal is necessary, others point to the threat from US shale, which is said to be more serious and persistent than OPEC had anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOR</strong><strong>EX: </strong>The <strong>DXY</strong> saw decent if not solid recovery from early lows below some key chart support levels to reclaim 89.500+ status, initially by virtue of weakness or rather a retracement in major counterparts, but also underpinned by some better than forecast US data (housing starts, permits and IP). However, the index really needs rebound firmly above 90.000 to mount a sustainable recovery and turn the tech outlook around from bearish. The Loonie maintains gains vs the Greenback, albeit a slender advantage on the back of stronger than expected Canadian manufacturing sales. <strong>USDCAD</strong> is hovering just below 1.2550 having briefly breached last Wednesday&rsquo;s low (at 1.2540 vs 1.2545), with the next big event looming tomorrow in the form of the BoC policy meeting. No changes expected given ongoing NAFTA/global trade uncertainty, but with options indicating another hefty break-even of 120 pips and some hefty expiry interest lying between 1.2585-1.2600 in 2.1 bn. The biggest loser and underperformer, with <strong>USDCHF</strong> up to 0.9650+ while <strong>EURCHF</strong> extended its rally through 1.1900 to circa 1.1945 and close to the 1.2000 floor that was pulled by the SNB back in January 2015. Aside from any official intervention, Russia liquidating Swiss assets is still touted as a major factor. Another G10 laggard ahead with the <strong>Kiwi</strong> only just hovering around 0.7340 vs the USD and keeping tabs on 1.0600 vs the <strong>AUD</strong> ahead of Q1 CPI data on Wednesday that is seen mixed (firmer q/q, but weaker in y/y terms). Note, only a modest reaction and uptick on the latest GDT auction showing a 2.6% increase in prices and 0.6% rise in whole milk. Not quite architects of their own downfall but undermined by weak data and survey releases (UK labour/wages and German ZEW expectations respectively). <strong>Cable</strong> is struggling to retain 1.4300 having registered a new post-Brexit vote high and approaching 1.4400 barriers, while EURUSD is back above its 55 DMA at 1.2365 from 1.2400+ at one stage.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A decent if not solid recovery from early lows below some key chart support levels to reclaim 89.500+ status, initially by virtue of weakness or rather a retracement in major counterparts, but also underpinned by some better than forecast US data (housing starts, permits and ip). However, the index really needs rebound firmly above 90.000 to mount a sustainable recovery and turn the tech outlook around from bearish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie is the lone G10 currency to maintain a gain vs the Greenback, albeit a slender advantage on the back of stronger than expected Canadian manufacturing sales. Usd/Cad is hovering just above 1.2550 having briefly breached last Wednesday&rsquo;s low (at 1.2540 vs 1.2545), with the next big event looming tomorrow in the form of the BoC policy meeting. No changes expected given ongoing NAFTA/global trade uncertainty, but with options indicating another hefty break-even of 120 pips and some hefty expiry interest lying between 1.2585-1.2600 in 2.1 bn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest loser and underperformer, with Usd/Chf up to 0.9650+ and close to a very large option expiry at 0.9650 (1.75 bn), while Eur/Chf extended its rally through 1.1900 to circa 1.1930 and close to the 1.2000 floor that was pulled by the SNB back in January 2015. Aside from any official intervention, Russia liquidating Swiss assets is still touted as a major factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another G10 laggard ahead with the Kiwi only just hovering above 0.7325 vs the Usd and keeping tabs on 1.0600 vs the Aud ahead of Q1 CPI data on Wednesday that is seen mixed (firmer q/q, but weaker in y/y terms). Note, only a modest reaction and uptick on the latest GDT auction showing a 2.6% increase in prices and 0.6% rise in whole milk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP/EUR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not quite architects of their own downfall, but undermined by weak data and survey releases (UK labour/wages and German ZEW expectations respectively). Cable is struggling to retain 1.4300 having registered a new post-Brexit vote high and approaching 1.4400 barriers, while Eur/Usd is testing its 55 DMA at 1.2336 from 1.2400+ at one stage.</p>\r\n",

Bunds and Gilts have actually just carved out fresh session highs at 159.19 and 121.85 respectively (+4 and +8 ticks vs -20 and -29 ticks at worst). The turnaround began just ahead of UK data, but gathered pace thereafter and picked up a bit more momentum after an arguably even bleaker German ZEW survey, although global trade wars and Syria weighed on sentiment, and the latter at least has subsequently receded on the scale of major risk factors. Tech impulses may also have impacted as nearest downside chart supports held in again, around 158.92 and then 158.74-72 for Bunds, and at 121.44 (just). Ahead, some decent US data and plenty more Fed speak to potentially provide further direction.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.2%) saw mild gains amid a slew of corporate updates, while Nikkei 225 (Unch) was flat with price action contained by a firm JPY. Hang Seng (-0.83%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%) were choppy in reaction to the mixed data figures in which GDP Y/Y printed inline with estimates at 6.8% which surpasses the official target for 2018, while Q/Q printed slightly below estimates at 1.4% vs. Exp. 1.5%. Furthermore, Industrial Production also disappointed but was counterbalanced by solid growth in Retail Sales. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat amid a similar picture seen in riskier assets in Japan, while a 5yr JGB auction also failed to spur price action despite slightly firmer demand and higher prices, as this was in tandem with a lower amount sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC sets CNY mid-point at 6.2771 (Prev. 6.2884)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC offers CNY 367.5bln in 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility with the rate increased by 5bps to 3.30% (inline with increase in short-term rate in March and hikes in Reverse Repo rates)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese GDP YY (Q1) 6.8% vs. Exp. 6.8% (Prev. 6.8%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese GDP QQ SA (Q1) 1.4% vs. Exp. 1.5% (Prev. 1.6%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Industrial Output YY (Mar) 6.0% vs. Exp. 6.3% (Prev. 6.2%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Retail Sales YY (Mar) 10.1% vs. Exp. 9.7% (Prev. 9.4%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Urban investment YTD YY (Mar) 7.5% vs. Exp. 7.7% (Prev. 7.9%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Hansson (Hawk) sees more confidence in inflation developments.

This is most noted in the materials and IT sectors, with both leading their peers. Negativity is noted in consumer discretionary, led by Reckitt Benckiser (-2.6%) on a broker downgrade by Credit Suisse. Elsewhere, Chinese permission for foreign auto companies to set up more than two ventures has led to auto names strengthening with Daimler rising from EUR 65.24 to EUR 65.44 and BMW up from EUR 90.47 to EUR 91.10. GKN (2.2%) have been supported with Melrose expecting an offer to become unconditional by April 19th, AB food (+2.6%) are higher amid an earnings beat and Bayer (2.0%) have been lifted by the news that the co. has agreed to sell 3.6% of new shares to Singaporean state investment company Temasek for EUR 3bln; this comes as the company plans for a USD 62.5bln takeover of Monsanto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Usd remains under pressure, and the index slipped through chart support in the 89.355-325 area that houses a recent April low and rising channel, to expose 89.250 ahead of 89.000 and another major downside technical level around 88.942 (end of March base), before regaining a foothold on disappointing EU data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/GBP&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still vying for top spot within the G10, as the cross remains in a broad 0.8650-00 range amidst decent buying interest between 0.8625-30, but both making further headway against the Greenback. Eur/Usd finally absorbed offers ahead of 1.2400 to trade above on stops (briefly), while Eur/Chf climbed to a fresh post-SNB floor removal peak just over 1.1900 as Usd/Chf hovers around 0.9600. Cable has also notched up a landmark after setting a new post-Brexit vote best around 1.4375 and now eyeing 1.4400 barrier resistance assuming no major set-back in wake of broadly softer than expected UK labour and earnings data &ndash; 1.4300 is holding in thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retreating from recent 107.00+ highs and pivoting around the big figure with daily chart support around 106.89 underpinning the pair vs hefty 1.5 bn option expiry interest at 107.20 that appears to be capping the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed Chinese data overnight and RBA minutes underlining the likelihood of no changes in rates for some time have weighed on the Aud, with 0.7800 vs the Usd rejected again, but the Kiwi has lost more ground vs its antipodean peer and the Usd as the cross rebounds further to touch 1.0600 and Nzd/Usd trades sub-0.7350. Note, a major bank favours a short from 0.7360.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds now consolidating off worst levels on a considerably weaker than expected German ZEW survey, especially in terms of the forward-looking expectations component, which is somewhat at odds with a 2018 GDP forecast upgrade from the major institutes, but more in keeping with a rise in recession risk to circa 30%. The 10 year debt future is back above 159.00 and only 7 ticks adrift vs -20 ticks at the low, while Gilts have also bounced from worst levels to 121.71 vs 121.48 (-29 ticks) on the sub-consensus UK jobs/wage data. Elsewhere, US Treasuries off overnight lows in tandem ahead of more data and a raft of Fed speakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at the commodities complex, oil prices consolidated from the overnight gains with WTI (-0.1%) and Brent Crude (-0.1%) modestly lower on the day as concerns of supply disruptions in the Middle East temporarily fade, whilst rising US shale outputs is on traders&rsquo; minds ahead of the API weekly inventories later today. Moving onto the metals bloc, gold (-0.4%) prices have dipped lower, closer to the bottom of the range but losses are modest at best. Overnight, Chinese GDP printed in line at 6.8%, above the government&rsquo;s target of around 6.5%. However, industrial output came short of the expected 6.3%, whilst daily steel output in March climbed to the highest level since September. In turn, Chinese iron ore futures extended losses and hit a 10-month low on concerns of a supply glut. On the flip side, London aluminium futures extend their rally to the highest level in almost seven years, buoyed by growing concerns that the aftermath of the US sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal will result in tighter supply conditions.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities have shown strength (Eurostoxx +0.3%) on the back of improved risk sentiment with Syrian tensions continuing to abate. This is most noted in the materials and IT sectors, with both leading their peers. Negativity is noted in consumer discretionary, led by Reckitt Benckiser (-2.6%) on a broker downgrade by Credit Suisse. Elsewhere, Chinese permission for foreign auto companies to set up more than two ventures has led to auto names strengthening with Daimler rising from EUR 65.24 to EUR 65.44 and BMW up from EUR 90.47 to EUR 91.10. GKN (2.2%) have been supported with Melrose expecting an offer to become unconditional by April 19th, AB food (+2.6%) are higher amid an earnings beat and Bayer (2.0%) have been lifted by the news that the co. has agreed to sell 3.6% of new shares to Singaporean state investment company Temasek for EUR 3bln; this comes as the company plans for a USD 62.5bln takeover of Monsanto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Usd remains under pressure, and the index slipped through chart support in the 89.355-325 area that houses a recent April low and rising channel, to expose 89.250 ahead of 89.000 and another major downside technical level around 88.942 (end of March base), before regaining a foothold on disappointing EU data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/GBP&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still vying for top spot within the G10, as the cross remains in a broad 0.8650-00 range amidst decent buying interest between 0.8625-30, but both making further headway against the Greenback. Eur/Usd finally absorbed offers ahead of 1.2400 to trade above on stops (briefly), while Eur/Chf climbed to a fresh post-SNB floor removal peak just over 1.1900 as Usd/Chf hovers around 0.9600. Cable has also notched up a landmark after setting a new post-Brexit vote best around 1.4375 and now eyeing 1.4400 barrier resistance assuming no major set-back in wake of broadly softer than expected UK labour and earnings data &ndash; 1.4300 is holding in thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retreating from recent 107.00+ highs and pivoting around the big figure with daily chart support around 106.89 underpinning the pair vs hefty 1.5 bn option expiry interest at 107.20 that appears to be capping the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed Chinese data overnight and RBA minutes underlining the likelihood of no changes in rates for some time have weighed on the Aud, with 0.7800 vs the Usd rejected again, but the Kiwi has lost more ground vs its antipodean peer and the Usd as the cross rebounds further to touch 1.0600 and Nzd/Usd trades sub-0.7350. Note, a major bank favours a short from 0.7360.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds now consolidating off worst levels on a considerably weaker than expected German ZEW survey, especially in terms of the forward-looking expectations component, which is somewhat at odds with a 2018 GDP forecast upgrade from the major institutes, but more in keeping with a rise in recession risk to circa 30%. The 10 year debt future is back above 159.00 and only 7 ticks adrift vs -20 ticks at the low, while Gilts have also bounced from worst levels to 121.71 vs 121.48 (-29 ticks) on the sub-consensus UK jobs/wage data. Elsewhere, US Treasuries off overnight lows in tandem ahead of more data and a raft of Fed speakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at the commodities complex, oil prices consolidated from the overnight gains with WTI (-0.1%) and Brent Crude (-0.1%) modestly lower on the day as concerns of supply disruptions in the Middle East temporarily fade, whilst rising US shale outputs is on traders&rsquo; minds ahead of the API weekly inventories later today. Moving onto the metals bloc, gold (-0.4%) prices have dipped lower, closer to the bottom of the range but losses are modest at best.&nbsp;Overnight, Chinese GDP printed in line at 6.8%, above the government&rsquo;s target of around 6.5%. However, industrial output came short of the expected 6.3%, whilst daily steel output in March climbed to the highest level since September. In turn, Chinese iron ore futures extended losses and hit a 10-month low on concerns of a supply glut. On the flip side, London aluminium futures extend their rally to the highest level in almost seven years, buoyed by growing concerns that the aftermath of the US sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal will result in tighter supply conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Furthermore, Industrial Production also disappointed but was counterbalanced by solid growth in Retail Sales. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat amid a similar picture seen in riskier assets in Japan, while a 5yr JGB auction also failed to spur price action despite slightly firmer demand and higher prices, as this was in tandem with a lower amount sold.</p>\r\n",
