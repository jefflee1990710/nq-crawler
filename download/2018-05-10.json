The key question raised by Governor Carney during the press conference, was whether the weakness seen in Q1 was temporary, after some of the drop-off was attributed to adverse weather conditions at the start of the year. Nonetheless, the MPC placed more weight on labour data and business surveys, reiterating that any future rate increases are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. Later in the day, Governor Carney told the BBC he expects an interest rate hike this year. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*NAFTA: </strong>Canada&#39;s Freeland is willing to work as long as necessary for a NAFTA agreement and she remains optimistic about reaching a deal, noting that parties &lsquo;definitely getting close to the final objective&rsquo;. Sources added that the US has set a deadline of May 17th or 18th for a deal to be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*DATA: </strong>US CPI figures rose from the previous month but posted smaller than expected gains. The softness in the core measures was attributed to new and used car prices, airline fares and health care commodities costs, whilst shelters prices placed mild pressure on the figures. Nevertheless, analysts at Oxford Economics noted that overall inflation continues to indicate a gradual build up of inflationary-pressure, as the economic momentum remains strong, supported by the fiscal stimulus effect and a tight labour market</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX +0.94% at 2793, NDX +1.02% at 6964, DJI +0.80% at 24739.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS:&nbsp;Cons Cyclicals: +0.35%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.73%, Energy: +0.81%, Financials: +0.71%, Health Care: +1.20%, Industrials: +0.74%, Materials: +0.79%, Technology: +1.13%, Telecoms: +1.80%, Utilities: +1.28%.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures rose from the Wall Street open and boosted from the slightly softer US CPI report which hints the Fed may decide to hike rates at a slower pace, also from a technical perspective the Emini broke back above 2700 and the April high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All sectors finished in the green on Thursday trade, with Telecoms and Healthcare outperforming. Stock specifics, Booking Holdings (BKNG) beat on both top and bottom line, however they forecast their Q2 results to be lower than analyst estimates which saw the stock as low as 5.5% on Thursday. L Brands also an underperformer today as they lowered Q1 eps guidance, LB saw intraday lows of ~10%. On the flipside, SPX outperformers were Century Link (CTL), who gave a strong boost to the telecom sector, following a strong earnings report. EnvisionHealthcare (EVHC) were higher today following reports in the NY Post that KKR (KKR) are considering an USD 11bln bid for the company. Retailers were hit today with Macy&rsquo;s (M) underperforming the retail complex following a downgrade from Morgan Stanley, who predict they will report earnings below street estimates for the fiscal year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI crude futures settle higher by USD 0.22 at USD 71.36/bbl, Brent crude futures settle higher by USD 0.26 at USD 77.57/bbl.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices came off their best levels seen this week as traders took profits in the wake of the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement. Prices also remained subdued after Iran&#39;s oil minister Zanganeh noted he does not see an impact on Tehran&#39;s oil and after OPEC stated it is too soon to tell whether extra oil is needed due to US sanctions, as it evaluates shortfalls in crude output. Note the he matter will be discussed at the monitoring committee meeting on May 22nd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran oil minister says he prefers oil prices of USD 65/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES:&nbsp;US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 4 ticks higher at 119-15+.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries finished slightly higher for the day, following the miss on CPI which alleviated fear of inflation gearing up in the economy. Yields on the long-end of the curve were lower by c.3bps at settlement. The 5s30s spread was the lowest since 2007 and narrower by c.4bps following the solid 27bln 30yr bond auction, which stopped-through by 0.8bps. The stop-through was the largest for a new bond at auction since November 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FOREX: *DXY: </strong>The index has recoiled further from fresh 93.400+ YTD peaks to circa 92.500 in wake of more underwhelming US inflation data and rebounded slightly later in the session just above 93.600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*GBP, NZD: </strong>The GBP fell after the Bank of England decision where they lowered inflation forecasts and kept interest rates unchanged. Carney&rsquo;s suggestion that rates will still rise this year provided some support as the pair regained 1.3500. NZDUSD has pared losses amid broad based USD weakness and rebounded above 0.6950 from a near 0.6900 after some pressure seeing after the latest RBNZ meeting revealed a 2-way stance on the outlook for rates with new Governor Orr underlining that the prospect of an ease or hike are evenly balanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*AUD: </strong>The best G10 performer, partly on the back of the Kiwi&rsquo;s plummet as AUDNZD jumped over 1.0800, but also on strength in commodity prices, with AUDUSD stronger against the Greenback and holding well-above 0.7500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*EUR, CAD: </strong>EURUSD reclaimed the 1.1900 handle, but perhaps conscious of more on Friday (1.75bln) as the pair drifted back from recovery peaks just shy of 1.1950. The Loonie extended its gains against the USD to just over 1.2750, amid some relatively positive NAFTA updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*JPY, CHF: </strong>The safe-havens also prospered from the Dollar&rsquo;s data-related downturn, with USDJPY now back below 109.50 from around 110.00 at one stage and USDCHF retesting parity from just over 1.0050 at the high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*TRY:</strong> The Lira endured more choppy trade, with another bout of weakness and slump to 4.3000 vs the USD after day 1 of the emergency meeting to discuss the Try&rsquo;s plight and state of the economy promising action, but not producing anything concrete. However, USDTRY pulled back to around 4.2200 in the hope that the 2nd day of talks between the Government and CBRT delivers.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index has recoiled further from fresh 93.400+ ytd peaks to circa 92.500 in wake of more underwhelming US inflation data as core CPI missed consensus in m/m and y/y terms. The Greenback is lower almost across the board as a result, with only dovish Central Bank impulses preventing 2 of its major rivals from benefiting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aforementioned exceptions to the rule, with the Pound buffeted by the BoE and a wait-and-see stance on further policy normalisation from the majority of the MPC, as only McCafferty and Saunders retained their votes for a hike. Cable is now testing bids around and just under 1.3500 again having squeezed up to 1.3600 just ahead of the start of &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday at high noon, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded over 0.8800. Similarly, the Kiwi remains pressured after the latest RBNZ meeting revealed a 2-way stance on the outlook for rates with new Governor Orr underlining that the prospect of an ease or hike are evenly balanced. Nzd/Usd has pared some losses, but is struggling the rebound above 0.6950 from a near 0.6900 low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best G10 performer, partly on the back of the Kiwi&rsquo;s plummet as Aud/Nzd jumped over 1.0800, but also on strength in commodity prices, with Aud/Usd overcoming resistance and big option expiry interest at 0.7500 before the NY cut.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both ending the EU session around 0.5% ahead vs the Buck, with Eur/Usd reclaiming the 1.1900 handle, and again ahead of decent expiry interest at the big figure (2.5 bn) rolling off today, but perhaps conscious of more on Friday (1.75 bn) as the pair drifted back from recovery peaks just shy of 1.1950. The Loonie extended its gains against the Usd to just over 1.2750, but bounced towards 1.2800 as oil prices retreat from their best levels and Canadian new house prices came in flat, albeit bang in line with expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The safe-havens also prospered from the Dollar&rsquo;s data-related downturn, with Usd/Jpy now back below 109.50 from around 110.00 at one stage and Usd/Chf retesting parity from just over 1.0050 at the high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira endured more choppy trade, with another bout of weakness and slump to 4.3000 vs the Usd after day 1 of the emergency meeting to discuss the Try&rsquo;s plight and state of the economy promising action, but not producing anything concrete. However, Usd/Try pulled back to around 4.2200 in the hope that the 2nd day of talks between the Government and CBRT delivers.</p>\r\n",

However, MPC believe that the slowing in Q1 GDP growth has been overstated in the prelim release and believe that over time Q1 will be revised higher to 0.3% and thereafter look for 0.4% in Q2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inflation: 2.5% CPI in March was lower than expected in the Feb QIR. Inflation rates of the most import-intensive components of CPI appear to have peaked. Impact of GBP depreciation while remains significant, is likely to fade a little faster than previously thought. CPI target is expected to be met in two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rates: No mention of the historical guidance of: rates will need to rise at a somewhat faster pace and greater extent than markets are currently pricing in. Reiterated that any future rate increases were likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brexit: Minutes offer no new view by the MPC on the matter</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wages: Wage growth are firming gradually and broadly as expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labour market: Hiring intentions remain strong and the unemployment rate has fallen slightly further over the past 3 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slack: MPC continues to judge that the UK economy has a limited degree of slack</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Case for unchanged: Members saw value in seeing how data unfolded in the coming months and to see whether softness in Q1 would persist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Case for lifting rates: Saw Q1 GDP as erratic and due to temp factors.

As such, ASX 200 (+0.2%) was led by the energy sector as oil edged fresh multi-year highs last seen in 2014 and with RBOB also at its best levels since mid-2015, while Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) was also marginally higher amid earnings and with Mitsubishi Motors shares outpacing the broader market after it beat on its FY net and guided sales higher. Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) and Hang Seng (+0.9%) shrugged off another liquidity drain by the PBoC to trade positive in which Hong Kong resumed its recent trend of outshining its regional peers, while participants also digested mixed Chinese inflation figures that showed CPI missed estimates at 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.9% although PPI growth gathered pace for the 1st time in 7-months to 3.4% as expected. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with demand lacking amid gains in riskier assets while a 10yr inflation-indexed auction was also largely ignored and failed to spur price action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 20bln via 7-day and CNY 10bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily drain of CNY 20bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3768 (Prev. 6.3733)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese CPI (Apr) Y/Y 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.9% (Prev. 2.1%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese PPI (Apr) Y/Y 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.4% (Prev. 3.1%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Summary of Opinions for April 26th-27th meeting stated it is appropriate to pursue powerful monetary easing under current guidelines as inflation is still a distant from the 2% target. Furthermore, the release noted that the rate of CPI Y/Y growth is likely to continue on its uptrend and increase toward 2%, while it added that BoJ is buying ETFs and risky assets as part of efforts to reach inflation goal but must look at potential merits and demerits of this action. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House commented that the US is preparing to add additional sanctions on Iran as soon as next week. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel Defense Forces conducted operations on Iran targets in Syria overnight. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deputy head of Iran&#39;s revolutionary guards Salami said Europe cannot confront the US in the nuclear accord, adds diplomacy cannot help Iran, the only way is confrontation.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBNZ said that it expects to maintain OCR at this expansionary level for a considerable time and that current level is best to maximize sustainable employment and stable inflation, while it also noted the next direction in rates is equally a hike or cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBNZ said domestic economic growth is robust, while it cited subdued wages, low food &amp; import price inflation for low inflation. RBNZ also maintained forecasts for where it sees OCR through to September 2019 in which it OCR estimates were kept at 1.8% for September 2018 and June 2019, while the estimate for September 2019 was maintained at 1.90%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Lane (Dovish) said he doesn&#39;t think this monetary policy rates are going to change dramatically in the coming years.

This resulting from Randgold Resources and BT&rsquo;s (-8.2% and -9.0% respectively) uninspiring earnings, as well as BT&rsquo;s announcement of job cuts. Financials are lower by 0.3% while RBS&rsquo;s (+4.3%) lower than expected pay-out on MBS sales during the financial crisis, and UniCredit&rsquo;s (+0.9%) positive financial results. Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB is underperforming on the recent Italian political developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stock specific news Next (+6.2%) raised guidance on warm weather boosting sales, and Alstom (+0.9%) announced a USD 3bln agreement with GE to exit multiple energy joint ventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Losing a bit more impetus below 93.000 and looking for some support from US CPI data amidst expectations for firmer headline and core prints, but softer leads via PPI in the run up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very dovish hold from the RBNZ last night has hit the Kiwi hard, as the Central Bank signalled an even more prolonged period of unchanged policy and 50-50 odds that the next move in the OCR could be up or down. Nzd/Usd subsequently dived from a recovery high not far from 0.7000 to within a few pips of 0.6900, while the Aud/Nzd cross catapulted to just over 1.0800 from circa 1.0700 and lower in recent sessions. Conversely and consequently, Aud/Usd has continued its rebound from near 0.7400 lows towards 0.7500, but could be capped by mega option expiry interest at the big figure spread over the next few days (5 bn in total from today to May 16).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie continues to outperform G10 counterparts and climb alongside oil prices that have extended to the upside on the US-Iran nuclear deal breakdown and with draws in US crude inventories adding to supply concerns. Usd/Cad is now bids/support around 1.2775 vs peaks earlier in the week just over 1.3000 and may derive further direction from Canadian new house price data later (although the US inflation data is likely to be more influential for the pair).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/GBP/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All holding tight lines vs the Greenback, as Eur/Usd meanders between 1.1845-90 and largely shrugs off the latest ECB monthly economic report that essentially echoes the less upbeat tone of last month&rsquo;s policy meeting assessment. Note, hefty expiries at 1.1900 today and on Friday of 2.5 bn and 1.75 bn respectively. Usd/Chf is back in familiar territory and recent trading parameters of 1.0000-50 having edged over the top at one stage, while Cable is choppy after regaining 1.3500+ status ahead of the May version of BoE &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday that is almost bound to prompt a major reaction given all the variables around the rate verdict from the vote split, minutes, QIR and presser by Governor Carney. Note, little reaction to UK data which on balance was worse than forecast, especially March&rsquo;s trade balance, but Gbp/Usd is now trying to extend its rebound beyond 1.3600. Usd/Jpy retested 110.00, with stops seen on a break of 110.05 and a major Fib around 110.20 after dovish BoJ vibes from the Summary of Opinions overnight that reiterated the need for &lsquo;powerful&rsquo; monetary easing given the inflation remains a long way from the 2% target. However, the headline pair is drifting back down again towards 109.50 amidst a general Usd retracement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and US Treasuries appear to be steering the latest broad upturn in fixed, while Gilts tread more cautiously as the clock ticks down to the BoE. Market contacts were looking the 159.03-06 area to be tested after 158.94 and 159.00, with a breach then exposing 159.18 vs the new 159.10 (+1/4 point) Eurex high so far, and more accurately flagged support bang on the current low where a chart gap lay. Similarly, near term support around Wednesday&rsquo;s session base held in UST futures and the 10 year contract has also found dip buyers to revisit a rising trend-line that now forms a first line of resistance (119-13+ to 119-15). A break would bring 119-19 into the equation, then 119-24+ before the month to date peak at 119-31+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy prices are currently coming off overnight highs in which crude prices extended on the advances as traders adjust to supply disruption concerns in the wake of the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement. Following this withdrawal, Israeli military have increased the number of strikes targeted at dozens of Iranian facilities in retaliation to an Iranian rocket attack on the occupied Golan Heights, signalling a continued escalation of geopolitical tensions in the region. Yesterday&rsquo;s DOE printed a larger than expected drawdown, providing some support to the complex. WTI (+0.7%) and Brent (+0.6%) crude prices are firmly above the USD 71.00/bbl and USD 77.00/bbl respectively. UBS expects Brent to trade at USD 80/bbl in 6 months (prior forecast at USD 65/bbl) and WTI to trade at a USD 5/bbl discount to Brent (prior USD 4/bbl discount). Elsewhere, gold prices are trading flat amid a slight easing of the greenback, while London copper saw modest gains on the back of lower inventories.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equites trading mixed (Euro Stoxx 50 flat) ahead of the BoE rate decision, with the energy and telecoms sectors underperforming (-0.9% and -0.8% respectively). This resulting from Randgold Resources and BT&rsquo;s (-7.9% and -8.3% respectively) uninspiring earnings, as well as BT&rsquo;s announcement of job cuts. Financials are up 0.1% aided by RBS&rsquo;s (+4.1%) lower than&nbsp;&nbsp;expected pay-out on MBS sales during the financial crisis, and UniCredit&rsquo;s (+2.4%) positive financial results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stock specific news Next (+6.8%) raised guidance on warm weather boosting sales, and Alstom (+0.8%) announced a USD 3bln agreement with GE to exit multiple energy joint ventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy prices are currently coming off overnight highs in which crude prices extended on the advances as traders adjust to supply disruption concerns in the wake of the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement. Following this withdrawal, Israeli military have increased the number of strikes targeted at dozens of Iranian facilities in retaliation to an Iranian rocket attack on the occupied Golan Heights, signalling a continued escalation of geopolitical tensions in the region. Yesterday&rsquo;s DOE printed a larger than expected drawdown, providing some support to the complex. WTI (+0.7%) and Brent (+0.6%) crude prices are firmly above the USD 71.00/bbl and USD 77.00/bbl respectively. UBS expects Brent to trade at USD 80/bbl in 6 months (prior forecast at USD 65/bbl) and WTI to trade at a USD 5/bbl discount to Brent (prior USD 4/bbl discount). Elsewhere, gold prices are trading flat amid a slight easing of the greenback, while London copper saw modest gains on the back of lower inventories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10 year UK benchmark is back on a firmer footing and close to 122.00 again having retreated into negative territory ahead of the raft of domestic data that missed consensus overall and will underpin expectations for a steady hand from the BoE at noon. Gilts are now likely to sit tight between 121.82-122.11 Liffe extremities, with Bunds largely side-lined, but broadly tracking moves within wider Eurex parameters of 159.01-158.21 vs their previous 158.85 settlement price. No real reaction to the earlier ECB bulletin, but any comments from Draghi or Coeure may spark some price action. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are essentially unchanged to a fraction firmer after a relatively well taken down 10 year auction and ahead of CPI data before the final refunding leg.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Straddling the 93.000 level and looking for more impetus from US CPI data amidst expectations for firmer headline and core prints, but softer leads via PPI in the run up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very dovish hold from the RBNZ last night has hit the Kiwi hard, as the Central Bank signalled an even more prolonged period of unchanged policy and 50-50 odds that the next move in the OCR could be up or down. Nzd/Usd subsequently dived from a recovery high not far from 0.7000 to within a few pips of 0.6900, while the Aud/Nzd cross catapulted to just over 1.0800 from circa 1.0700 and lower in recent sessions. Conversely and consequently, Aud/Usd has continued its rebound from near 0.7400 lows towards 0.7500, but could be capped by mega option expiry interest at the big figure spread over the next few days (5 bn in total from today to May 16).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie continues to outperform G10 counterparts and climb alongside oil prices that have extended to the upside on the US-Iran nuclear deal breakdown and with draws in US crude inventories adding to supply concerns. Usd/Cad is now bids/support around 1.2775 vs peaks earlier in the week just over 1.3000 and may derive further direction from Canadian new house price data later (although the US inflation data is likely to be more influential for the pair).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/GBP/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All holding tight lines vs the Greenback, as Eur/Usd meanders between 1.1845-80 and largely shrugs off the latest ECB monthly economic report that essentially echoes the less upbeat tone of last month&rsquo;s policy meeting assessment. Note, hefty expiries at 1.1900 today and on Friday of 2.5 bn and 1.75 bn respectively. Usd/Chf has firmed up a degree and is now closer to the upper end of recent trading parameters having edged over 1.0050, while Cable is choppy after regaining 1.3500+ status ahead of the May version of BoE &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday that is almost bound to prompt a major reaction given all the variables around the rate verdict from the vote split, minutes, QIR and presser by Governor Carney. Note, little reaction to UK data which on balance was worse than forecast, especially March&rsquo;s trade balance. Usd/Jpy retesting 110.00, with stops seen on a break of 110.05 and a major Fib around 110.20 after dovish BoJ vibes from the Summary of Opinions overnight that reiterated the need for &lsquo;powerful&rsquo; monetary easing given the inflation remains a long way from the 2% target.</p>\r\n",

Nzd/Usd subsequently dived from a recovery high not far from 0.7000 to within a few pips of 0.6900, while the Aud/Nzd cross catapulted to just over 1.0800 from circa 1.0700 and lower in recent sessions. Conversely and consequently, Aud/Usd has continued its rebound from near 0.7400 lows towards 0.7500, but could be capped by mega option expiry interest at the big figure spread over the next few days (5 bn in total from today to May 16).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie continues to outperform G10 counterparts and climb alongside oil prices that have extended to the upside on the US-Iran nuclear deal breakdown and with draws in US crude inventories adding to supply concerns. Usd/Cad is now bids/support around 1.2775 vs peaks earlier in the week just over 1.3000 and may derive further direction from Canadian new house price data later (although the US inflation data is likely to be more influential for the pair).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/GBP/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All holding tight lines vs the Greenback, as Eur/Usd meanders between 1.1845-80 and largely shrugs off the latest ECB monthly economic report that essentially echoes the less upbeat tone of last month&rsquo;s policy meeting assessment. Note, hefty expiries at 1.1900 today and on Friday of 2.5 bn and 1.75 bn respectively. Usd/Chf has firmed up a degree and is now closer to the upper end of recent trading parameters having edged over 1.0050, while Cable is choppy after regaining 1.3500+ status ahead of UK data and the May version of BoE &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday that is almost bound to prompt a major reaction given all the variables around the rate verdict from the vote split, minutes, QIR and presser by Governor Carney. Usd/Jpy retesting 110.00, with stops seen on a break of 110.05 and a major Fib around 110.20 after dovish BoJ vibes from the Summary of Opinions overnight that reiterated the need for &lsquo;powerful&rsquo; monetary easing given the inflation remains a long way from the 2% target.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (+0.3%) was led by the energy sector as oil edged fresh multi-year highs last seen in 2014 and with RBOB also at its best levels since mid-2015, while Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) was also marginally higher amid earnings and with Mitsubishi Motors shares outpacing the broader market after it beat on its FY net and guided sales higher. Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.9%) shrugged off another liquidity drain by the PBoC to trade positive in which Hong Kong resumed its recent trend of outshining its regional peers, while participants also digested mixed Chinese inflation figures that showed CPI missed estimates at 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.9% although PPI growth gathered pace for the 1st time in 7-months to 3.4% as expected. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with demand lacking amid gains in riskier assets while a 10yr inflation-indexed auction was also largely ignored and failed to spur price action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 20bln via 7-day and CNY 10bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily drain of CNY 20bln.

Furthermore, the release noted that the rate of CPI Y/Y growth is likely to continue on its uptrend and increase toward 2%, while it added that BoJ is buying ETFs and risky assets as part of efforts to reach inflation goal but must look at potential merits and demerits of this action.

However, PM Najib Razak commented that no party received a simple majority and that it is up to the King to select a new PM with the decision to be made on who will get the trust of the members of parliament, while PM-Elect Mahathir stressed the importance to have a government formed today and hopes to be sworn in as PM by 5pm local time today.

Furthermore, the RBNZ noted that the next direction in rates is equally a hike or cut, while a couple of financial institutions pushed back their forecasts for a rate hike in response to the rhetoric. Elsewhere, the rest of the G10 currencies were relatively quiet with the DXY slightly easing back to the 93.00 level and with commodity-linked currencies remaining firm following the strength across the energy complex, while MYR non-deliverable forwards declined on uncertainty following the surprise opposition win at the general elections and with incumbent PM Najib Razak seemingly refusing to concede.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBNZ Interest Rate Decision (May) 1.75% vs. Exp. 1.75% (Prev. 1.75%).

RBNZ also maintained forecasts for where it sees OCR through to September 2019 in which it OCR estimates were kept at 1.8% for September 2018 and June 2019, while the estimate for September 2019 was maintained at 1.90%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities traded higher in which crude prices extended on the advances seen in the wake of the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement and following the larger than expected DOE crude inventory drawdown, with WTI and Brent crude prices firmly above the USD 71.00/bbl and USD 77.00/bbl respectively.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade positive across the board following the energy-fuelled upside on Wall St, where oil names outperformed as crude gained in the wake of Trump&#39;s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement and following a larger than expected drawdown in DoE crude stockpiles. As such, ASX 200 (+0.2%) is led by the energy sector strength as oil edges fresh multi-year highs last seen in 2014 and with RBOB also at its best levels since mid-2015, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) is also marginally higher amid earnings and with Mitsubishi Motors shares outpacing the broader market after it beat on its FY net and guided sales higher. Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (+0.9%) have shrugged off another liquidity drain by the PBoC to trade positive with Hong Kong resuming its recent trend of outshining its regional peers, while participants also digest mixed Chinese inflation figures in which CPI missed estimates at 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.9% although PPI growth gathered pace for the 1st time in 7-months to 3.4% as expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, NZD stole the spotlight overnight with the currency pressured after the RBNZ policy meeting in which it kept rates unchanged as expected and stated that it expects to maintain the OCR at the current expansionary level for a considerable time to maximize sustainable employment and stable inflation. Furthermore, the RBNZ noted that the next direction in rates is equally a hike or cut, while a couple of financial institutions pushed back their forecasts for a rate hike in response to the rhetoric. Elsewhere, the rest of the G10 currencies were relatively quiet with the DXY slightly easing back to the 93.00 level, while commodity-linked currencies AUD and CAD remain firm following the strength across the energy complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful with demand lacking amid gains in riskier assets and with a 10yr inflation-indexed auction due later.</p>\r\n",
