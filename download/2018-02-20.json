The retail giant fell as much as 10% and also dragged down some of its peers, including Kroger who fells over 4%. On the other hand, Amazon&rsquo;s shares jumped 2% as Walmart&rsquo;s challenge falters and after the company announced perks for users of Amazon Prime credit cards. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES:&nbsp;&nbsp;US&nbsp;T-Note futures (March 2018) settle down 3 ticks at 120-15+ </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US treasuries fell on Tuesday as markets attempt to absorb the mammoth US supply this week. The Treasury sold a total of USD 151bln of bills and USD 28bln worth of 2-year notes on Tuesday, ahead of 5-year note and 2-year FRN auctions on Wednesday and a 7-year auction on Thursday. Nevertheless, the 2-year sale seemed to go OK as the yield stopped through the WI at the bidding deadline, although demand &ndash; measured by the B/C &ndash; declined from its multi-year high in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY stronger ahead of FOMC Minutes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD was stronger across the board as it attempts to mount a recovery from the multi-year lows hit late last week, ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s FOMC minutes release. GBP was one of the better performers after a Business Insider article suggested the European Parliament was preparing to deliver a report that would call for increased flexibility in future relationship talks with the UK. The TRY tumbled after reports that Turkish forces had launched airstrikes in Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 22 cents higher at $61.90 per barrel; Brent futures settle 42 cents lower at $65.25 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WTI Brent crude spread narrowed today as the US benchmark held onto minor gains while the Brent fell on the stronger USD. Some had pointed to a private inventory report which showed another decline in inventories at the Cushing hub in Oklahoma behind the gains for WTI, ahead of the API inventory report (delayed until Wednesday after Presidents&rsquo; Day).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The DXY edged a little closer to reclaiming another milestone on its ongoing recovery from 88.250 approximate lows, but was thwarted on its advance towards 90.000 by latest charges by US Special Council Mueller against a Russian official. Usd/Jpy eclipsed the nearest upside chart resistance level at 107.32 (last year&rsquo;s high) before retreating back to just above the 107.00 level, while Eur/Usd breached more interim supports under 1.2350, but stopped just a pip short of a key Fib at 1.2319. Cable revisited the lower end of its 1.3930-1.4015 broad range, but recovered well after earlier reports that EU Parliament would back privileged single market access for the UK post-Brexit. Usd/Cad (belatedly) surpassed 1.2610 resistance and its 100 DMA at 1.2623 in wake of much weaker than forecast Canadian wholesale trade data, but will be eyeing tier 1 releases later in the week for more independent impetus. Aud/Usd failed to regain 0.7900 after neutral RBA minutes, with the focus now on wages that have been sluggish, while Nzd/Usd bounced off strong tech support around 0.7338 ahead of the RBNZ&rsquo;s annual review (one of acting head Spencer&rsquo;s final official appointments), with no real reaction to flattish GDT auction prices. Elsewhere, Eur/Sek rallied sharply on the back of weak Swedish inflation data, from session lows of 9.9050 to just short of 9.9900 and with early February peaks around 10.000 the obvious draw. In the EM region, Usd/Try jumped on wire news of an escalation in the Turkey-Syria conflict, to 3.8000+ from sub-3.7600 at one stage.</p>\r\n",

In Australia, the <strong>ASX 200 (flat)</strong> has come under pressure from material and financial names, with many of the large banks reversing the prior days gains. Over in Japan, the <strong>Nikkei (-1.0%)</strong> had tripped through 22,000 amid softness in tech names. The <strong>Hang Seng (-0.8%)</strong> reopened for the first time since last week, however initial gains had been short-lived, with the index conforming to the sombre tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JGBs are flat in thin-trade, March futures contract down 2 ticks and hovering near yesterday&rsquo;s levels. USTs off by 6+ ticks with yields continuing to pick up, 2yr yields now at the highest since Sep&rsquo;08 after hitting 2.22%, while the US curve is also flattening this morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RBA meeting minutes failed to provide any fireworks with the central bank sticking with its neutral tone. As such, AUD had been largely unmoved post the release of the minutes and instead focus will fall on the wage price index due out tomorrow. RBA February minutes states that low rates are helping reduce unemployment and lift inflation, additionally rising AUD would impede pickup in economic growth and inflation, however AUD TWI is still within narrow range of past couple of years.

(Business Insider)</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK is said to have a secret plan to withhold Brexit payments if the EU refuses to provide the UK with a desirable trade deal. (Newswires) Elsewhere, according to a letter seen last week, Netherlands government has linked its decision to activate hard Brexit plan amid a lack of clarity from the UK. (Sky)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Economy Minister says the EU will respond appropriately if the US puts a tariff on European steel imports.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Hansson (hawk) says he&#39;s not interested in becoming ECB President. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities have trimmed initial gains (Eurostoxx 50 flat) to trade with little in the way of firm direction ahead of the US return to market. The FSTE 100 modestly lags its peers (-0.4%) after disappointing earnings from index heavyweights HSBC (-4%) and BHP Billiton (-4%), dampening sentiment for UK stocks and the former leading to underperformance in the financial sector. Other individual movers include Hikma Pharmaceuticals (+9%) after appointing their new CEO, Fidessa (+21.4%) are also seen higher after reports that Swiss-listed Temenos (-6.8%) are to make an offer for the Co., while Intercontinental Hotels (-3.9%) have faced selling pressure this morning following a lacklustre earnings update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY has now rebounded above 89.500, and on broad-based gains vs G10 rivals, albeit mainly inspired by another round of short covering. A major French bank notes that the market remains very short of Dollars (in line with latest weekly CFTC spec positioning data) and modestly long Jpy and moves in the headline pairing off last week&rsquo;s circa 105.55 low support the rebalancing theory as spot trades back over 107.00. 107.32 offers eyed next, and as a recap this level now forms resistance rather than support on the way down as the 2017 low. Similar price moves elsewhere, as Eur/Usd recoils further from recent peaks and briefly testing bids at 1.2350 with small stops just below, but not challenging key Fib support at 1.2319. Cable briefly reclaimed the 1.4000 handle after reports in Business Insider suggested that the EU Parliament is to call for Britain to have privileged single market access after Brexit. Usd/Chf now inching closer to 0.9350 and Usd/Cad just shy of 1.2600 amidst the ongoing Greenback recovery, while Aud/Usd is retesting 0.7900 on the downside with little direction gleaned from RBA minutes overnight, but key data to come tomorrow (wage growth). Nzd/Usd straddling 0.7350, with strong chart support around 0.7338.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A rather mixed 2 year German Schatz reception has not really deflected core bonds from what seems like an asset-related recovery as stocks retreat from earlier highs. Indeed, Bunds and Gilts remain close to fresh, albeit marginal intraday peaks at 158.29 and 121.07 respectively (+2 ticks and -6 ticks) and EZ peripheral paper is now all above parity as books for Spain&rsquo;s 2048 issuance continues to swell. Not much traction being gleaned by US Treasuries that still have a mountain of supply to absorb, although futures are off worst levels and yields have eased a shade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures are seen higher albeit off best levels as the firmer USD caps gains; WTI holds above the USD 62.00bbl level (note the weekly API inventories will be released tomorrow, not today due to yesterday&rsquo;s US market holiday). In terms of energy news flow, the Joint OPEC/non-OPEC Technical Committee concluded that the oil glut is dissipating at a faster pace than anticipated, according to sources. Additionally, UAE energy minister claims OPEC and allies are to continue oil cooperation beyond 2018 and notes UAE, Saudi Arabia and Russia all support an extension cut beyond 2018. In metals markets, spot gold trades lower alongside the aforementioned firmer USD while copper prices have seen little in the way of firm direction as Chinese participants remain away from market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UAE Energy Minister says the UAE is expected to over-deliver on production cuts in Q1 due to maintenance commitment with OPEC-led pact.

        "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade mostly firmer (Eurostoxx 50 +0.3%) despite an initially negative lead from the Asia-Pac region. The FSTE 100 modestly lags its peers (-0.1%) after disappointing earnings from index heavyweights HSBC (-4%) and BHP Billiton (-3.0%), dampening sentiment for UK stocks and the former leading to underperformance in the financial sector. Other individual movers include Hikma Pharmaceuticals (+8%) after appointing their new CEO, Fidessa (+23%) are also seen higher after reports that Swiss-listed Temenos (-5.2%) are to make an offer for the Co., while Intercontinental Hotels (-4.3%) have faced selling pressure this morning following a lacklustre earnings update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY has now rebounded above 89.500, and on broad-based gains vs G10 rivals, albeit mainly inspired by another round of short covering. A major French bank notes that the market remains very short of Dollars (in line with latest weekly CFTC spec positioning data) and modestly long Jpy, and moves in the headline pairing off last week&rsquo;s circa 105.55 low support the rebalancing theory as spot trades back over 107.00. 107.32 offers eyed next, and as a recap this level now forms resistance rather than support on the way down as the 2017 low. Similar price moves elsewhere, as Eur/Usd recoils further from recent peaks and briefly testing bids at 1.2350 with small stops just below, but not challenging key Fib support at 1.2319. Cable has reclaimed the 1.4000 handle after reports in Business Insider suggested that the EU Parliament is to call for Britain to have privileged single market access after Brexit. Usd/Chf now inching closer to 0.9350 and Usd/Cad just shy of 1.2600 amidst the ongoing Greenback recovery, while Aud/Usd is retesting 0.7900 on the downside with little direction gleaned from RBA minutes overnight, but key data to come tomorrow (wage growth). Nzd/Usd straddling 0.7350, with strong chart support around 0.7338.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some upside in core debt futures in the most recent exchanges, as Bunds reclaim 158.00+ status having slipped to a new 157.90 Eurex low (-37 ticks) and Gilts touched 121.00 vs 120.81 (-32 ticks) at worst. However, the partial recovery appears to be little more than consolidation at this stage and the real litmus test will come as auction results roll in. As usual, strong demand for syndicated paper as books swell to over Eur22.5 bn for Spain&rsquo;s 2048 offering, albeit with a bigger premium and yield concession &ndash; note, Bono futures outperforming and just above parity in contrast to Eurozone peers. ZEW up soon. US Treasures still mired towards the lows of the overnight session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures are seen higher albeit off best levels as the firmer USD caps gains; WTI holds above the USD 62.00bbl level (note the weekly API inventories will be released tomorrow, not today due to yesterday&rsquo;s US market holiday). In terms of energy newsflow, the Joint OPEC/non-OPEC Technical Committee concluded that the oil glut is dissipating at a faster pace than anticipated, according to sources. Additionally, UAE energy minister claims OPEC and allies are to continue oil cooperation beyond 2018 and notes UAE, Saudi Arabia and Russia all support an extension cut beyond 2018. In metals markets, spot gold trades lower alongside the aforementioned firmer USD while copper prices have seen little in the way of firm direction as Chinese participants remain away from market.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity markets are somewhat fragile, with major Asian bourses off to a weaker start. US markets were closed for President&rsquo;s day and as such, Asian participants took the cue from European equities which slipped in yesterday&rsquo;s session. In Australia, the ASX 200 (-0.4%) has come under pressure from material and financial names, with many of the large banks reversing the prior days gains. As a reminder, investors will be keeping a close eye on BHP earnings. Over in&nbsp;Japan, the Nikkei (-1.3%) had&nbsp;tripped through 22,000 amid softness in tech names. The Hang Seng reopened for the first time since last week, however initial gains had been short-lived, with the index conforming to the sombre tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today saw the release of the RBA meeting minutes which had failed to provide any fireworks with the central bank sticking with its neutral tone. As such, AUD had been largely unmoved post the release of the minutes and instead focus will fall on the wage price index due out tomorrow. AUD briefly dipped below 0.79 amid the push higher in the USD index , while AUD/NZD ran into resistance at 1.0750. Elsewhere, a leg lower in equity markets, provided support for the JPY with major cross falling to intra-day lows, with the exception of the USD/JPY which has benefited from some short-covering. NZD will be in focus later today with participants awaiting the latest Fonterra GDT auction.&nbsp;According to CBA, WMP futures are suggesting that prices will be flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the EM space, PHP had outperformed against the greenback after comments from the Philippine Central Bank chief, who stated that the BSP will not hesitate to raise rates if inflation risks persist. KRW fell amid rising fears of American protectionist&nbsp;policy&rsquo;s (namely proposal to impose hefty steel tariffs), which has prompted South Korea to threaten that a retaliation is possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JGBs are flat in thin-trade, March futures contract down 2 ticks and hovering near yesterday&rsquo;s levels. USTs off by 6+ ticks with yields continuing to pick up, 2yr yields now at the highest since Sep&rsquo;08 after hitting 2.22%, while the US curve is also flattening this morning.</p>\r\n",
