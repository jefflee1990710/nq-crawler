        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities mixed, Treasuries up, crude up, dollar down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: US proposes new China talks; EU&rsquo;s Juncker welcomes close partnership with UK; DOE showed draw in crude stocks; OPEC MOMR cut demand estimates, reports rise in production; US PPI soft; Beige Book warns on trade; Fed&rsquo;s Bullard fords not expect inflation surge.<br />* AHEAD: BoE, ECB and CBT Rate Decisions; US CPI and Initial Jobless Claims; French and German CPI.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The WSJ reported the US is said to propose a new round of trade talks with China in the near future aimed at getting bilateral economic negotiations back on track. Earlier there were reports that trade talks between the two countries may start after the November US mid-term elections. On the NAFTA front, Mexican Economy Minster Guajardo said to see a high chance of a US-Canadian trade deal, emphasizing the preliminary NAFTA agreement is written as trilateral, though he cannot rule that such an outcome will be achieved, and is ready to pursue a bilateral agreement with the US. On the Canada side, PM Trudeau reiterated his view that no deal is better than getting a bad NAFTA deal. Elsewhere, sources reported that Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister will be returning to Washington tonight for talks, with the sources also noting that Canada is not under immediate pressure to sign a NAFTA deal, noting that there are issues that require more than a days&rsquo; work; that said, the Canadian source was optimistic a deal can be reached next week.,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Brainard (Voter, Dovish) said further gradual interest rate increases are likely to be appropriate over the next year or two noting the US economic growth is strong and that the economy is meeting the Fed&#39;s employment and inflation targets. She believes trade is a source of uncertainty right now but she does not see discernible impact on prices and confidence. Fed&#39;s Bullard (Dove, Non-voter) believes an inflation surge is unlikely and US interest rates are neutral to restrictive and there is &quot;some room to run&quot; in the labour market. He said to expect more forecasters in 2019 to increase estimates for GDP growth to a low 2% range and he would personally consider marking up his current long-run growth forecast of 2% if growth remains above that level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BEIGE BOOK:</strong> The Fed&#39;s latest Beige Book was once again noting trade concerns; most districts noted concerns about trade tensions, particularly but not only for manufacturers. Tariffs were reported to be contributing to rising input costs, mainly for manufacturers. Businesses in&nbsp; a number of districts scaled back or postponed capital investment due to trade tensions. Fed says labour markets tights throughout the US with most districts reporting labour shortages. Fed says final goods and services process rising at modest-to-moderate rate in most districts though showing signs of deceleration. US economy expanded at moderate pace in recent weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU&#39;s Juncker on Wednesday welcomed UK PM May&#39;s close partnership proposal and was said to agree with Chequers proposal to start a close partnership on trade, and the European Commission will not be the body to stand in the way of an orderly exit for the UK. However, Juncker once again said the EU Britain needs to understand &ldquo;if you leave EU you will lose privileges&rdquo;. On the UK side, PM May is said to be working to get a Brexit deal that is advantageous for the whole of the UK noting that without a Brexit deal, the position on the divorce payment to the EU changes. Also, a PM May spokesperson said a no-deal Brexit is not a likely scenario and that the focus is on taking forward the Chequers plan. He said the commitment is to have a no hard border with Ireland, noting that over the course of two years the government has looked at options for the Northern Irish border and the Chequers is the only credible plan. Later sources suggested the EU has reportedly begun redrafting an Irish Brexit protocol in order to appease the UK. Finally, former Junior Brexit Minister Steve Baker denied reports that he or any other officers of the ERG are plotting to remove UK PM May, after 50 Conservative MPs were reportedly said to oppose her Brexit plan in a meeting took place to discuss how and when they could force her to stand down. Elsewhere, sources reported that the EU has reportedly begun redrafting an Irish Brexit protocol in order to appease the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US PPI </strong>fell by 0.1% in August missing the expectations of a 0.2% rise, taking the YY headline to 2.8% below the 3.2% consensus. Core PPI also surprised to the downside and posted a 0.1% fall with Pantheon attributing the weakness to a big correction in the trade services component which makes up 23% of the measure, taking the index temporarily below trend. Also lower scrap metals and prescription drug prices added to the downside pressure. Analysts at Pantheon note it is unlikely PPI has peaked and despite data softened in the last two months, a rebound in both core goods and services is expected in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.0% at 2889, NDX -0.3% at 7488, DJI +0.1% at 25998. SECTORS: Energy +0.5%, Materials +0.0%, Industrials +0.4%, Cons Discretionary +0.2%, Cons Staples +1.3%, Healthcare +0.5%, Financials -0.9%, Tech -0.5%, Telecoms +1.4%, Utilities -0.1%.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) shares were still lower as it unveiled the new iPhones and iWatch devices at its Special Event; the new Apple watch Series 4 GPS model will be priced at USD 399 and the LTE model will be available for USD 499, iPhone XS with a 5.8inch display and iPhone&nbsp; XS Max with a 6.6inch display; Apple (AAPL) says iPhone XR will start from USD 749; iPhone XS will start at USD 999 and iPhone XS Max will start from USD 1099. Discovery (DISCA) spent much of the session at the top of the performance table after announcing it will exclusively stream shows on Hulu, which will broaden its viewership as consumers move away from traditional TVs; the deal also includes a tie-up with Oprah&rsquo;s OWN network. Tobacco names were higher after the FDA announced a clampdown on e-cigarette companies, due to teen use, helping Altria (MO), British American Tobacco (BATS) and Philip Morris (PM) to gain. Micron (MU) saw another day of losses after a downgrade at Goldman Sachs. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) shrugged-off bullish commentary in its analyst presentation, as well as Oppenheimer&rsquo;s bullish outlook, trading red after a downgrade at Stifel. Semis were generally mixed at the open, though some (WDC, and AMD for instance) went positive after positive news flow on China trade talks (others, like KLAC and AVGO, QCOM, could not manage to turn green). Lam Research (LRCX) was hit after a downgrade at Goldman Sachs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES $1.12 HIGHER AT $70.37/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLES $0.68 HIGHER AT $79.74. </strong>Crude prices were supported by inventory data, weather-related fears related to the US hurricane season, as well as OPEC&#39;s MOMR report, which struck a bullish tone. Elsewhere, North Sea&#39;s Buzzard oilfield did not restart yesterday due to adverse weather. On the subject of weather, Florence is still expected to weaken on Thursday, though will still be &quot;extremely dangerous&quot; when it makes landfall, NHC said. The DOE reported crude stocks drew down more than anticipated (-5.3mln vs -0.805mln expected; Cushing -1.2mln vs +0.549mln expected); products, however, saw builds, with distillate stocks up more than expected (6.2mln vs 1.4mln expected) while gasoline saw a smaller than expected build (1.25mln vs 1.3mln expected). While headline crude stocks did not match the draw reported by the API on Tuesday, crude prices remained supported by the data, also taking comfort from weekly production falling to 10.9mln from 11mln. The OPEC MOMR saw downward revisions to demand estimates, but Citi&#39;s analysts were unconcerned: &quot;The 20,000 bpd reduction in demand for 2018 and 2019 is more of a rounding error than a market-moving development, particularly since they also subtracted 64,000 bpd from their non-OPEC supply estimate for 2018,&quot; Citi said, adding that &quot;the 278,000 bpd increase in OPEC production to 32.565 mmbpd was an added supply, of course, although already widely anticipated and still not enough to match the OPEC Q3 demand for OPEC crude oil of 33.37 mmbpd. In other words, OPEC already sees a deficit, even before a likely drop in Iranian supply.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 3+ TICKS HIGHER AT 119-14 .</strong> Yields were slightly lower at settlement, driven by a disappointing PPI report. The 10-year auction was well received, stopping through the screens by 0.5bps. Cover was a touch above recent averages, and in the breakdown, dealers took more than the previous auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 30-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 73bln in 3s (USD 35bln, Tuesday), 10s (USD 23bln on Wednesday) and 30s (USD 15bln on Thursday); with USD 24bln maturing at he month-end settlement, the auctions will raise a net USD 49bln in new cash, according to TD Securities. The Fed will allow all USD 19bn maturing at month-end (the amount is below the $24bn cap) to run off at month-end. TD Securities has noted that the US curve has steepened as of late, running &quot;in stark contrast to Fed rate hike pricing, which rebounded following the payroll report,&quot; adding that &quot;while the auction may see some caution given the impending September 15 tax advantage date for pension contributions, we believe long-end demand should remain robust in Q4.&quot; Focussing specifically on Thursday&#39;s auction, Barclays analysts point out that demand hs been easing at 30-year auctions, of late, with bid/cover falling to 2.27x in August, but Barclays says that demand for the long bond has still been higher this year compared to 2017. Nevertheless, performance in 2018 has been mixed, with three of this year&#39;s auctions tailing (Brclays says tails have been less volatile this year too). In terms of participation, &quot;domestic and foreign investor participation has been consistent at the auctions this year, averaging 60% and 10% takedown each month, respectively,&quot; Barclays says, &quot;compared with 2017, participation for both groups is marginally higher, by 1-2%.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Ahead of Thursday&#39;s ECB meeting, the EUR was patrolling a familiar range (roughly 1.1550 and 1.1650). The ECB&#39;s meeting is expected to be a dull affair, according to most on the Street. However, that does give scope for choppy price action if there are unexpected deviations from the script, and a few analysts have raised the possibility of a dovish Draghi given trade wars, some weakening data, geopolitical concerns, as well as concerns regarding exposure to EMs. &quot;A possible wild card would be if Draghi used these risks to express the idea that a rate hike could easily come much later than summer 2019,&quot; Credit Suisse says, &quot;under this scenario, we would expect EURUSD support at 1.1520 to break and the pair to move into a 1.13-1.15 range.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Cable managed to reclaim the 1.30 handle, after losing it early doors; Lloyds notes that the pound is struggling to maintain upside momentum, despite getting back through the 1.30-1.3050 region. &quot;A decline back through 1.2970/50 support would disappoint bulls in the near- term and suggest a range centred at 1.2900 develops as we await new news,&quot; and while it remains above 1.2825-1.2780 support, the bank says it is directionally biased toards 1.33-1.35. WA decline through this support would suggest the latest rebound towards 1.31 was merely another correction for a test of the 1.26-1.25 support region,&quot; the bank says. Other desks have suggested that the lack of upside momentum is likely due to questions hanging over whether PM May will survive beyond the Tory Party conference at the end of the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie rallied to sub-1.30 on Wednesday as the positive NAFTA commentary gains traction as well as a tail wind from oil prices. Credit Suisse said that while the fundamental outlook on Canada remains solid in the light of the recent data and BoC rhetoric, it believes that positioning in USDCAD limits the potential for the loonie to rally significantly in the event of a benign outcome from NAFTA negotiations, and continues to expect the loonie to remain in a broad range vs the USD, and sees potential for CAD to further outperform the rest of the G10 commodity complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Outperformed and pulling back further from 111.60+ recent peaks through expiry option strikes between 111.50-65 towards 111.25 on a combination of broad risk aversion amidst more US-China trade barbs and mainly soft US PPI metrics ahead of headline inflation data on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Overcame weak Aussie consumer sentiment to reclaim 0.7100+ status. Attention is on labour market data due out overnight; the data is volatile, but analysts expect it to be in keeping with an economy that is growing above its trend rates. RBC looks for a print above the trend 22k, and also is looking out for a rise in participation, which may see the jobless rate tick higher by 0.1ppts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB Monetary Policy Decision </strong>Due at 12:45BST/07:45 EDT followed by Press Conference Due At 13:30BST/08:30EDT on Thursday 13th September 2018. Unanimous expectations look for the ECB to leave its three key rates unchanged. Macroeconomic projections are set to see a minor downgrade to growth expectations. Draghi set to be grilled on trade protectionism, concerns surrounding Italy and the Bank&rsquo;s reinvestment policy. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20066/download\"><em><strong>Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</strong></em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BoE Monetary Policy Decision </strong>due at 12:30BST/07:30EDT on Thursday 13th September 2018. The Bank of England (BoE) is widely expected to keep the Bank Rate unchanged at 0.75%, with all 71 analysts surveyed by Reuters forecasting the central bank will remain on hold. Money markets are pricing in a 0.0% chance of a hike at the upcoming meeting. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20068/download\"><em><strong>Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</strong></em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Central Bank of Turkey Policy Decision </strong>due at 1200BST/07:00EDT on Thursday 13th September 2018. Turkey&#39;s central bank is expected to lift its weekly repo rate to 22.00% from 17.75% (range of forecasts is between 20.00% on the low, and 25.00% on the high); anything less may than 22.00% may disappoint traders. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20070/download\"><em><strong>Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview</strong></em></a>.</p>\r\n",

While headline crude stocks did not match the draw reported by the API on Tuesday, crude prices remained supported by the data, also taking comfort from weekly production falling to 10.9mln from 11mln.</li>\r\n  <li>OPEC MOMR: The OPEC MOMR saw downward revisions to demand estimates, but Citi&#39;s analysts were unconcerned: &quot;The 20,000 bpd reduction in demand for 2018 and 2019 is more of a rounding error than a market-moving development, particularly since they also subtracted 64,000 bpd from their non-OPEC supply estimate for 2018,&quot; Citi said, adding that &quot;the 278,000 bpd increase in OPEC production to 32.565 mmbpd was an added supply, of course, although already widely anticipated and still not enough to match the OPEC Q3 demand for OPEC crude oil of 33.37 mmbpd. In other words, OPEC already sees a deficit, even before a likely drop in Iranian supply.&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The Fed will allow all USD 19bn maturing at month-end (the amount is below the $24bn cap) to run off at month-end.&nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>Analysts at Societe Generale say the 10-year note appears to be trading rich on the curve versus off-the-runs when compared to the last two auction cycles, and argues that it is also rich versus 5s and 30s. &quot;The 10y outright yield is near the top of this month&rsquo;s range and has cheapened by more than 8bp from Thursday&rsquo;s level. Any concession that brings it closer to 3% should draw in buyers,&quot; SocGen writes.&nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>&quot;The auction may also benefit from any short covering demand from leveraged funds, which are at a record net short in TY futures,&quot; SocGen adds.

ASX 200 (flat) was subdued as losses in telecoms and financials overshadowed the upside in energy stocks and with Myer shares hit after it reported a full-year loss, while Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) slipped amid a pullback in USD/JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) delved deeper into bear market territory and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) also conformed to the downbeat tone despite the PBoC&rsquo;s first open market operation after a 15-session hiatus, as trade uncertainty lingered and amid Chinese commodity losses. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with trade kept in a very tight range as prices failed to benefit despite the risk averse tone and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market in the belly to super-long end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 60bln via 7-day reverse repos. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8546(Prev. 6.8488)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BREXIT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A source report noted that Brexit deal summit said to be likely by mid-November, with UK and EU preparing for meeting with leaders to sign deal and that a plan will likely be announced at September 19th-20th meeting in Austria. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Downing Street is reportedly drawing up secret plans and has 2 escape options if the EU rejects PM May&#39;s Chequers proposal. The first option would see Chequers parked until talks resume after Brexit day for a loosely-worded fudge on the future relationship instead. The second, is to abandon it altogether and return to a more basic Canada style free trade agreement - but only if the EU gives way on its Irish border hardline. (The Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 50 Conservative MPs opposed to PM May&#39;s Brexit plan have met to discuss how and when they could force her to stand down. At least 48 letters of no confidence need to be submitted to 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady to trigger a vote on her premiership, and Sky sources suggest it could arrive within just a few weeks. Former Junior Brexit Minister Steve Baker denied reports that he or any other officers of the ERG were plotting to remove UK PM May. (BBC/Sky)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU official said UK is to definitely exit the EU in March but will never be an ordinary third country for the EU, while the official added that EU&rsquo;s Juncker is to say the bloc will remain firm on its divorce demands but wants a close partnership with UK post-Brexit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ERG released their alternative for the NI-Irish border, where they promised technological solutions, trusted-trader schemes and equivalence of standards on agricultural products. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Juncker welcomes UK PM May&#39;s close partnership proposal and agrees with Chequers proposal to start a close partnership on trade. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source reports suggested that the ECB had lowered their projections for economic growth, and see downside risk to growth due to weaker external demand, but keep inflation outlook unchanged. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Times&rsquo; shadow MPC believes the BoE should begin paving the way for more monetary tightening this week but leave interest rates unchanged to let August&rsquo;s rate increase bed in. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada is ready to allow US dairy access in NAFTA talks and is reportedly to offer the US limited access to the Canadian dairy market in order to try and reach an agreement, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Governor Carney warned against complacency in the 10th anniversary of the GFC, while he outlined risks to the UK economy including high levels of household debt, no-deal Brexit, high debt for China&#39;s economy and a catastrophic cyber-attack. (BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core European bourses trade mostly higher (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.2%) despite the negative lead from Asia. UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 lags its peers as the index is weighed on by currency effects and weakness in utility names following a profit warning from SSE (-7.6%), dragging the sector (-1.0%) and fellow utility names such as Centrica (-3.7%) and National Grid (1.6%) in sympathy. In terms of individual movers, FTSE 100 heavyweight Rolls-Royce (-3.0%) rests near the foot of the index, while traders cite reports of an emergency landing made by an Iberian flight with Rolls-Royce XWB engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - More positive EU Brexit vibes, and this time from EC President Juncker have given Sterling another boost, with Cable back on the 1.3000 handle after a dip below on more reports about Tory plots against UK PM May, while EUR/Gbp slips back towards 0.8900 irrespective of the single currency&rsquo;s rebound vs the Usd to retest 1.1600 before dipping again amidst ECB &lsquo;source&rsquo; reports suggesting downgrades to staff GDP forecasts and downside risks to the growth outlook tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD - Vying for best performer vs a flagging Greenback (DXY back down near 95.000 again vs just shy of 95.300 at best) honours with Usd/Jpy retreating to the 111.50 pivot and just under a daily chart cloud top that falls midway between decent option expiry interest from 111.50-65 (1.1 bn), while the Loonie is straddling 1.3050 against its US counterparts following reports that Canada may be willing to concede some dairy access to the US in the interests of reaching a NAFTA accord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - Narrowly mixed vs their US rival with the Aud recovering quite well from another 0.7100 downside probe given deteriorating Aussie consumer confidence overnight, and the Kiwi also keeping its head above a big figure (0.6500), albeit just.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF - The Franc remains relative rangebound and side-lined vs the Dollar and Euro within 0.9725-50 and 1.1305-1.1270 respective parameters, as the SNB&rsquo;s next policy review comes a week after the ECB and is widely expected to maintain current policy alongside all the usual currency assessments and measures to curb excessive Chf strength/demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Some comparative calm across the region ahead of what could well be another storm or at least volatile session on Thursday when the CBRT decides on policy and needs to deliver given aggressive/hawkish market expectations. However, reports about potential intervention from India have lifted the Rupee pre-emptively and to the benefit of others to a degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh peaks for bonds following dire Eurozone data and reports that the ECB staff forecasts will reflect weaker growth indicators and downside risks within the updates due alongside September&rsquo;s policy meeting on Thursday. Bunds have now been as high as 159.65, +35 ticks, but not quite able to match or breach yesterday&rsquo;s 159.67 Eurex session best, while Gilts extended gains to 19 ticks at 121.88 before fading ahead of resistance around 121.92. German long end supply before the 2nd of this week&rsquo;s US Treasury auctions in the form of Usd23 bn 10 year notes was well received overall. In terms of upcoming data, weekly mortgage apps and PPI, while the Fed also in focus via speakers Bullard and Brainard who are both scheduled ahead of the Beige Book for this month&rsquo;s FOMC. In the run-up, USTs hold a firmer and flatter line post-Tuesday&rsquo;s 3 year supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures are taking a breather following yesterday&rsquo;s rally amid hurricane concerns, the move was exacerbated by a larger than expected draw API crude inventories. Inventories showed a draw of 8.636mln barrels against the expected draw of 800k barrels. WTI futures retreated back below USD 70/bbl in recent trade. The latest from the NHC states Hurricane Florence heading towards the US East Coast and is expected to bring life-threatening storm surge and rainfall to portions of the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic states. While there are only a few refineries in Florence&rsquo;s path, the hurricane poses problems in terms of cargo shipping. Laden energy cargos have not been heading towards the North/South Carolina region ahead of the hurricane. Elsewhere, gold is uneventful while copper outperforms following the recent decline in the red metal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (7 Sep) -8.636M vs. Exp. -0.800M (Prev. -1.200M).

UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 lags its peers as the index is weighed on by currency effects and weakness in utility names following a profit warning from SSE (-7.6%), dragging the sector (-1.0%) and fellow utility names such as Centrica (-3.7%) and National Grid (1.6%) in sympathy. In terms of individual movers, FTSE 100 heavyweight Rolls-Royce (-3.0%) rests near the foot of the index, while traders cite reports of an emergency landing made by an Iberian flight with Rolls-Royce XWB engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - More positive EU Brexit vibes, and this time from EC President Juncker have given Sterling another boost, with Cable back on the 1.3000 handle after a dip below on more reports about Tory plots against UK PM May, while EUR/Gbp slips back towards 0.8900 irrespective of the single currency&rsquo;s rebound vs the Usd to retest 1.1600 before dipping again amidst ECB &lsquo;source&rsquo; reports suggesting downgrades to staff GDP forecasts and downside risks to the growth outlook tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD - Vying for best performer vs a flagging Greenback (DXY back down near 95.000 again vs just shy of 95.300 at best) honours with Usd/Jpy retreating to the 111.50 pivot and just under a daily chart cloud top that falls midway between decent option expiry interest from 111.50-65 (1.1 bn), while the Loonie is straddling 1.3050 against its US counterparts following reports that Canada may be willing to concede some dairy access to the US in the interests of reaching a NAFTA accord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - Narrowly mixed vs their US rival with the Aud recovering quite well from another 0.7100 downside probe given deteriorating Aussie consumer confidence overnight, and the Kiwi also keeping its head above a big figure (0.6500), albeit just.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF - The Franc remains relative rangebound and side-lined vs the Dollar and Euro within 0.9725-50 and 1.1305-1.1270 respective parameters, as the SNB&rsquo;s next policy review comes a week after the ECB and is widely expected to maintain current policy alongside all the usual currency assessments and measures to curb excessive Chf strength/demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Some comparative calm across the region ahead of what could well be another storm or at least volatile session on Thursday when the CBRT decides on policy and needs to deliver given aggressive/hawkish market expectations. However, reports about potential intervention from India have lifted the Rupee pre-emptively and to the benefit of others to a degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh peaks for bonds following dire Eurozone data and reports that the ECB staff forecasts will reflect weaker growth indicators and downside risks within the updates due alongside September&rsquo;s policy meeting on Thursday. Bunds have now been as high as 159.65, +35 ticks, but not quite able to match or breach yesterday&rsquo;s 159.67 Eurex session best, while Gilts extended gains to 19 ticks at 121.88 before fading ahead of resistance around 121.92. German long end supply before the 2nd of this week&rsquo;s US Treasury auctions in the form of Usd23 bn 10 year notes was well received overall. In terms of upcoming data, weekly mortgage apps and PPI, while the Fed also in focus via speakers Bullard and Brainard who are both scheduled ahead of the Beige Book for this month&rsquo;s FOMC. In the run-up, USTs hold a firmer and flatter line post-Tuesday&rsquo;s 3 year supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures are taking a breather following yesterday&rsquo;s rally amid hurricane concerns, the move was exacerbated by a larger than expected draw API crude inventories. Inventories showed a draw of 8.636mln barrels against the expected draw of 800k barrels. WTI futures retreated back below USD 70/bbl in recent trade. The latest from the NHC states Hurricane Florence heading towards the US East Coast and is expected to bring life-threatening storm surge and rainfall to portions of the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic states. While there are only a few refineries in Florence&rsquo;s path, the hurricane poses problems in terms of cargo shipping. Laden energy cargos have not been heading towards the North/South Carolina region ahead of the hurricane. Elsewhere, gold is uneventful while copper outperforms following the recent decline in the red metal.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.1%) was subdued as losses in telecoms and financials overshadowed the upside in energy stocks and with Myer shares hit after it reported a full-year loss, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) slipped amid a pullback in USD/JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.4%) delved deeper into bear market territory and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) also conformed to the downbeat tone despite the PBoC&rsquo;s first open market operation after a 15-session hiatus, as trade uncertainty lingered and amid Chinese commodity losses. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with trade kept in a very tight range as prices failed to benefit despite the risk averse tone and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market in the belly to super-long end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 60bln via 7-day reverse repos.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Downing Street is reportedly drawing up secret plans and has 2 escape options if the EU rejects PM May&#39;s Chequers proposal. The first option would see Chequers parked until talks resume after Brexit day for a loosely-worded fudge on the future relationship instead. The second, is to abandon it altogether and return to a more basic Canada style free trade agreement - but only if the EU gives way on its Irish border hardline. (The Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 50 Conservative MPs opposed to PM May&#39;s Brexit plan have met to discuss how and when they could force her to stand down. At least 48 letters of no confidence need to be submitted to 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady to trigger a vote on her premiership, and Sky sources suggest it could arrive within just a few weeks. (BBC/Sky)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU official said UK is to definitely exit the EU in March but will never be an ordinary third country for the EU, while the official added that EU&rsquo;s Juncker is to say the bloc will remain firm on its divorce demands but wants a close partnership with UK post-Brexit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Governor Carney warned against complacency in the 10th anniversary of the GFC, while he outlined risks to the UK economy including high levels of household debt, no-deal Brexit, high debt for China&#39;s economy and a catastrophic cyber-attack. (BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Times shadow MPC believes the BoE should begin paving the way for more monetary tightening this week but leave interest rates unchanged to let August&rsquo;s rate increase bed in. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback was mixed against its major counterparts with EUR/USD back below 1.1600 and as GBP/USD approached 1.3000 to the downside after the recent fluctuations triggered by a deluge of Brexit-related headlines. Elsewhere, USD/JPY pulled-back amid the risk averse tone and AUD/USD gave up the 0.7100 handle after weakness in metals prices and disappointing Consumer Confidence data, while CAD was boosted by source reports Canada is prepared to allow US dairy access in NAFTA talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Westpac Consumer Confidence Index (Sep) 100.5 (Prev. 103.6). (Newswires)<br />Australian Westpac Consumer Confidence (Sep) M/M -3.0% (Prev. -2.3%)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed with WTI crude futures firmer after prices gained 3.5% the prior day and briefly broke above USD 70.00/bbl amid US hurricane and Iran related uncertainty, with upside further exacerbated by a significantly larger than expected draw in headline API crude inventories. Elsewhere, the metals complex was less inspiring as gold retreated and copper traded subdued amid weakness in Chinese commodity prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (7 Sep) -8.636M vs. Exp. -0.800M (Prev. -1.200M). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia Energy Minister Novak said the oil market remains fragile on output decline in some countries including Venezuela and that he sees oil market impacted by geopolitics such as Iran-related uncertainty. Furthermore, Novak commented that they will discuss oil markets with OPEC this month in Algeria and will make decision on what more to do, while he also stated countries have potential to raise oil output. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EIA cut 2018 world oil demand growth forecast by 80k BPD and now sees 1.58mln BPD YY rise, while it reduced 2018 crude output estimate to 10.66mln BPD (prev. 10.68mln BPD) and lowered 2019 world oil demand growth view by 100k BPD to 1.47mln BPD YY rise. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NHC said Florence is forecast to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through landfall which is expected to bring a life-threatening storm surge and rainfall to the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic states.

(Nikkei)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short end was sold seeing yields on 2s and 3s rise to fresh decade highs. There was some talk of short covering cited, as well as concession heading into this week&rsquo;s supply. In early trade, there were reports of a large 5s30s flattener going through, but by settlement, the spread was unchanged, while other curve spreads were biased towards extremely modest widening. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 9+ ticks lower at 119-10+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump commented that trade talks are going well and Canada wants to make a deal with both sides operating in good faith. Trump also stated it would be good if US makes a deal with Canada but would be ok if it doesn&#39;t, and that the US is taking a very tough stance with China on trade. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada is ready to allow US dairy access in NAFTA talks and is reportedly to offer the US limited access to the Canadian dairy market in order to try and reach an agreement, according to sources.

(-0.3%) also conformed to the downbeat tone despite the PBoC&rsquo;s first open market operation after a 15-session hiatus, as trade uncertainty lingered and amid Chinese commodity losses. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with trade kept in a very tight range as prices failed to benefit despite the risk averse tone and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market in the belly to super-long end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are lower across the board after the region failed to sustain the early momentum from US, where the Nasdaq outperformed as Apple shares were lifted ahead of its special event and with energy names boosted by a rally in oil prices. ASX 200 (-0.1%) is negative as losses in telecoms and financials overshadowed the upside in energy stocks and with Myer taking a considerable hit after it posted a FY loss, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) slipped amid a pullback in USD/JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) delves deeper into bear market territory and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) also conforms to the downbeat tone despite the PBoC&rsquo;s first open market operation after a 15-session hiatus, as trade uncertainty lingers and amid Chinese commodity losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is mixed against its major counterparts with EUR/USD back below 1.1600 and with GBP/USD approaching 1.3000 to the downside after the recent fluctuations triggered by a deluge of Brexit-related headlines. Elsewhere, USD/JPY pulled-back amid the risk averse tone and AUD/USD gave up the 0.7100 handle after weakness in metals prices and disappointing Consumer Confidence data, while CAD was boosted by source reports Canada is prepared to allow US dairy access in NAFTA talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with trade kept in a very tight range as prices failed to benefit despite the risk averse tone and BoJ presence in the market in the belly to super-long end. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
