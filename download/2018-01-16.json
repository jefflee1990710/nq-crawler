The sources also suggest that the ECB&#39;s policy-making governing council stated any fundamental change to guidance was likely to come only later, with the March meeting, when policymakers get updated economic forecasts, seen as a more likely option. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Villeroy said that the recent euro increase is a source of uncertainty that requires monitoring because of its possible downward effects on imported prices. He also highlighted that the Eurozone has not yet reached its inflation target and not in a self-sustaining way, while opining that the Eurozone still needs accommodative monetary policy, but can gradually reduce the intensity of monetary policy support. Villeroy was also confident that the ECB can manage a smooth exit from ultra-loose monetary policy.

Elsewhere, EUR initially took a hit as the latest dovish ECB sources piece and comments from ECB&rsquo;s Villeroy pointed to worry over the recent bout of EUR strength. EURUSD briefly printed below 1.22, before recovering to circa 1.2280. This came after ECB member Jens Weidmann noted that he is of the belief that the central bank should end its asset purchase programme in 2018 would be appropriate. Weidmann again warned about undesired consequences of the ECB&#39;s easing programme, and he also said that analyst&rsquo;s expectation for a mid-2019 rate hike is roughly in line with ECB guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian energy minister Novak said that the oil market is not yet balanced and sticks to previous forecast for 2018 oil prices&nbsp;of USD 50-60/bbl.

        "content": "<p><strong><em>EQUITIES: SPX -0.35% at 2776, DJI -0.02% at 25796, NDX -0.32% at 6737</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Top sectors: Healthcare +0.47%, Consumer Staples +0.39%, Utilities -0.26%<br />Bottom sectors: Energy -1.23%, Materials -1.16%, Industrials -0.92%</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equities fell afoul of lower crude prices despite decent enough pre-market earnings, as we moved back from fresh intra-day highs for the three major US indices DJIA, before me moved lower as the Dow failed to consolidate above 26,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>TREASURIES: US T-Note Futures settled 1+ ticks higher at 122-31+</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US curve flattened as the 2-year space was subjected to selling pressure after the elongated US weekend, although the Treasury space operated in a narrow range today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY -0.62% heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The greenback managed to post modest gains&nbsp;before the DXY edged back towards session lows. In terms of US specifics, reports suggested that former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has reportedly been subpoenaed by special counsellor Mueller. With subsequent source reports suggesting that Bannon was told to not answer questions before House Intel Committee about the White House and transition period. Elsewhere a Republican lawmaker told reporters that the possibility of a US government shutdown is a real possibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR took a hit as the latest dovish ECB sources piece and comments from the ECB&rsquo;s Villeroy pointed to worry over the recent bout of EUR strength. EURUSD briefly printed below 1.22, before recovering to circa 1.2280. This came after ECB member Jens Weidmann noted that he is of the belief that the central bank should end its asset purchase programme in 2018 would be appropriate. Weidmann again warned about undesired consequences of the ECB&#39;s easing programme<a name=\"m_-6002682288055759318__Hlk503893851\">, and he also said that analyst&rsquo;s expectation for a mid-2019 rate hike is roughly in line with ECB guidance.</a>&nbsp;It would seem that the EUR benefitted from a fresh bough of dollar weakness, as opposed to Weidmann&rsquo;s (typically) hawkish comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USDJPY topped out in front of 111.00 following some verbal intervention from Japanese ministers in Asian dealing. The pair turned against a weaker dollar and moved in sympathy with US stocks, and last trades around 1.1030.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUDUSD ran out of steam around 0.7975 as copper prices and iron ore futures fell (with Barclays predicting an imminent drop in the latter), before the USD weakness left the pair virtually unchanged on the day. The NZD/USD also fell back from best levels, with the pair not receiving much support a rise in the latest GDT dairy auction prices, as results were in line with futures market pricing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USDCAD was choppy, but rangebound in front of tomorrow&rsquo;s BOC decision. The cross moved away from 1.2400 as sources reports suggested that US President Trump is not inclined to pull out of NAFTA, but they did note that his standing is subject to a daily change. The pair finished the day around 1.2425.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SNB President Jordan reiterated that the CHF is still highly valued, and gave no expectations when Swiss interest rates will normalise. His verbal intervention did little as the CHF moved to best levels vs. the USD as the greenback softened across the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES: WTI crude futures settled at USD 63.73/bbl, down USD 0.57, Brent crude futures settled at USD 69.15/bbl, down USD 1.11</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude oil unwound the bulk of yesterday&rsquo;s gains as various banks upgraded their price forecasts to lower levels than we are currently trading at. We also heard from the Russian energy minister Novak who remained cautious, stressing that the oil market is not yet balanced and stuck to Russia&rsquo;s previous forecast for 2018 oil process of USD 50-60/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold benefitted from the softer greenback, hovering around USD 1,340/oz in spot trade.</p>\r\n",

Eur/Usd briefly traded sub-1.2200 vs almost 1.2300 yesterday, with a couple of German SPD regional votes against the coalition Government proposal also weighing, but the headline pair held above support in the 1.2188-70 area, while Eur/Jpy pulled back further from 136.00+levels after earlier selling. Eur/Gbp extended the downside from 0.8900 despite some softer than expected UK inflation data that weighed on Cable (down to sub-1.3750 from 1.3800+ peaks). Usd/Jpy returning towards 111.00 compared to lows just under 110.50 and within the realms of heavy option expiries that run off on Thursday (some 2.5 bn between 110.80-111.00). Offers reportedly waiting at 111.00, and stops on a break above 111.20. Aud/Usd losing a bit more ground from 0.7978-86 key and fib resistance to sub-0.7950 lows amidst declines in copper prices and iron ore futures (with Barclays predicting an imminent drop in the latter). Nzd/Usd also back-tracking from best levels (0.7300+ to circa 0.7260) and not getting much in the way of support from a rise in GDT auction prices (virtually in line with futures). Usd/Cad trading nearer the bottom of a tight 1.2400-50 range ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC policy meet with options indicating the prospect of a marked reaction (more than a big figure), as consensus for a 25 bp hike comes with a few calls (8/36 in a Reuters poll) for a hawkish on hold outcome (due to ongoing NAFTA caution). However, Usd/Mxn continues to fall on hopes of a positive NAFTA resolution (around 18.7500 at one stage). DXY looking to build a base above 90.500.</p>\r\n",

In particular, similar to last year,&nbsp;air fares&nbsp;rose sharply in December; however, because air fares accounted for a smaller proportion of the basket of goods and services in 2017, the impact of the rise in prices on the contribution of air fares to the headline rate was smaller in 2017 than in 2016. Meanwhile,&nbsp;recreational and culture&nbsp;prices also came in on the weak side, with prices falling between November and December 2017, having been unchanged in the same period a year ago. This fall follows three successive months of relatively large increases in prices when compared with previous years. As we have highlighted in the past, the largest effects came from prices for&nbsp;games and toys, which fell between November and December 2017 by more than they did a year ago, along with&nbsp;audio-visual products, for which prices fell between November and December 2017, having risen in the same period last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite inflation falling back to 3.0%, the BoE is still committed to initiating an exchange of letters with the Chancellor to explain why inflation in November printed more than 100bp above target. That letter will be sent together with the publication of the inflation report on 8 February.</p>\r\n",

In the meantime, some short covering/long liquidation or position paring and profit taking, with the EUR seeing a bit of negativity on reports the Berlin branch of the SPD vote against a grand coalition &ndash; EUR/USD now around 1.2250 vs 1.2217 low and near 1.2300 peak yesterday. 1.2302 remains the nearest upside chart objective (another December 2014 high) before strong tech resistance at 1.2350, while support comes in around 1.2188-70. Cable retreated after (and before) the UK inflation data although the moves were relatively as the headline was in line with forecasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In equity markets, most of the major bourses traded in positive territory with the FTSE 100 benefitting from a decline in the GBP after the inflation data. Continental and Michelin topped their respective bourses after reports that the former has hired JPMorgan to look at a break up of the business. There was more to cheer for the UK high street as Greggs and JD Sports both reported strong sales over the Christmas period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures are trading mixed with a number of big banks commenting on prices this morning. Goldman Sachs said they see increasing upside risks to their calls for the two major benchmarks, although this isn&rsquo;t too surprising considering both trade above Goldman&rsquo;s average forecast this year. Morgan Stanley, Soc Gen and Bank of America have all lifted their forecasts. Precious metals have slipped back as the USD has regained some ground, with palladium pulling back from the record high hit on Monday. Base metals have seen similar price action with copper down just shy of 1% on the LME.</p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) and ASX 200 (-0.5%) traded mixed as Japan coat-tailed on a rebound in USD/JPY, while sentiment in Australia was dampened by weakness across commodity names including Rio Tinto which was pressured despite a beat on Q4 iron ore shipments, as the Co. also maintained full year guidance against expectations for an upgrade. Elsewhere. Hang Seng (+1.1%) outperformed and is on course for a record close, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) was also in the green amid several positive profit alerts and after a firm liquidity operation by the PBoC, which resulted to a net daily injection of CNY 270bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with prices range-bound throughout the day amid a lack of catalysts and after mixed results from a 5yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly positive as region digests corporate updates and picks up from the holiday-quietened lead due to the US market closure for Martin Luther King Jr Day. Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) and ASX 200 (-0.2%) are mixed with Japan coat-tailing on a rebound in USD/JPY, while sentiment in Australia is dampened by weakness across commodity names including Rio Tinto which was pressured despite a beat on Q4 iron ore shipments, as the Co. also maintained full year guidance against expectations for an upgrade. Elsewhere. Hang Seng (+0.8%) looks to reattempt a claim on the all-time closing high level and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) is also in the green amid several positive profit alerts and after a firm liquidity operation by the PBoC, which resulted to a net daily injection of CNY 270bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD/JPY found some reprieve from the recent selling and approaches the 111.00 level, while JPY-crosses were also underpinned in tandem, with GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY reclaiming the 153.00 and 136.00 handles respectively. This was despite comments from Japanese Finance Minister Aso who downplayed the importance of recent FX market conditions and said he doesn&rsquo;t see a big deal with USD/JPY at around 110.80. Elsewhere, the rest of major currencies are quiet and hold on to the prior day&rsquo;s gains against the greenback, with EUR/USD mildly extending on from the recent hawkish tone from ECB&rsquo;s Hansson who said QE could be ended in one step without any problems, and with AUD/USD supported after the PBoC set the firmest reference rate since December 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, price action in 10yr JGBs is flat amid a lack of catalysts and as participants are also side-lined ahead of a 5yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
