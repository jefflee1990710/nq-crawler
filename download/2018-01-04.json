        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback initially held close to &lsquo;best&rsquo; levels vs G10 currency counterparts, bar its Dollar peers in wake of the December Fed minutes, and pre-NFP, with the DXY extending gains to just over 92.250 at one stage. Markets seemed to latch on to the hawkish take from a few members that think the central &lsquo;3 hikes in 2018&rsquo; scenario may prove too conservative, conscious of the fact that this year&rsquo;s policy-making line up will be more prone to tightening. However, the USD Index was unable to build on recovery gains and slipped into negative territory after the 92.00 level gave way despite a decent ADP beat with the index looking towards 91.750 ahead of strong tech support at 91.526.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were all back in the ascendency vs the Greenback, with AUD/USD absorbing at least some 0.7850 offers overnight on the back of China&rsquo;s services PMI beat and another rise in iron ore prices. Chart-wise, 0.7861 is the 200 WMA, before further resistance from 0.7885-97, while support is seen either side of the 0.7800 level. Kiwi reclaimed the 0.7100 handle having tested, but not clearly breaching key tech DMAs around 0.7105-0.7100 yesterday despite a short dip below the big figure. On the upside, strong resistance remains at 0.7132. Usd/Cad still drawn to 1.2500 (ahead of a key fib level at 1.2492) amidst a range up to circa 1.2550, with the Loonie supported by firm crude prices and considerably firmer than forecast PPI and raw materials data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another gainer vs the Usd, as Cable rebounded from sub-1.3500 lows to trade above 1.3550 in wake of a headline beat in the UK services PMI, but unable to reclaim recent 1.3600 peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.2000 still holding firm in Eur/Usd, ahead of strong chart support in the 1.1970-60 zone, with Eurozone services PMIs underscoring the more upbeat/bullish economic tone. However, 1.2092 (last year&rsquo;s peak) and a fibo just above (1.2097) continue to contain rallies. Usd/Jpy extending topside ranges just beyond above heavy offers seen between 112.60-70, and eclipsing a daily cloud top at 112.79 by a few pips &ndash; 112.96 (55 DMA) the nearest upside chart target before the next big figure.</p>\r\n",

Markets seemed to latch on to the hawkish take from a few members that think the central &lsquo;3 hikes in 2018&rsquo; scenario may prove too conservative, conscious of the fact that this year&rsquo;s policy-making line up will be more prone to tightening. However, the USD Index has not been able to build on recovery gains and still looks vulnerable above 92.000 amidst more Trump/advisor/Russia/NK-related acrimony and accusation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All back in the ascendency vs the Greenback, with Aud/Usd absorbing at least some 0.7850 offers overnight on the back of China&rsquo;s services PMI beat and another rise in iron ore prices. Chart-wise, 0.7885-97 is the closest resistance area, while support is seen either side of the 0.7800 level. The Kiwi has reclaimed the 0.7100 handle having tested, but not clearly breaching key tech DMAs around 0.7105-0.7100 yesterday despite a short dip below the big figure. On the upside, strong resistance remains at 0.7132. Usd/Cad still drawn to 1.2500 amidst a range up to circa 1.2550, with the Loonie supported by firm crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another gainer vs the Usd, as Cable rebounds from sub-1.3500 lows ahead of the UK services PMI, but unable to reclaim recent 1.3600 peaks with the bias around consensus for the headline print towards the downside after manufacturing and construction misses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.2000 still holding firm in Eur/Usd, ahead of strong chart support in the 1.1970-60 zone, with Eurozone services PMIs underscoring the more upbeat/bullish economic tone. However, 1.2092 (last year&rsquo;s peak) and a fibo just above (1.2097) continue to contain rallies. Usd/Jpy extending topside ranges just beyond above heavier offers seen between 112.60-70, but not quite testing or breaching a daily cloud top at 112.79.</p>\r\n",

On the domestic data front, a better than expected Nationwide hpi will be overshadowed by the big UK PMI release &ndash; services &ndash; especially after headline misses in both the manufacturing and construction headlines.

More generally, the 5-year sector offers some value against longer-dated sectors, e.g. bearish pressure should favour a steeper 5s10s Bono. In the long end, 15s30s SPGB looks steep compared to the directionality; this may help demand at the margin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Analysts at IFR</strong> note there is a reasonably mixed set up for the auctions as there is a good natural concession and the longer issues are either unchanged or have underperformed swaps. It makes sense to extend duration into the 5-yr and 10-yr, and the 29-yr does not look too bad on the Spanish curve, if only modestly expensive. IFR add, however, there is not much micro-RV for any of the issues, and all bonds look more expensive against Italy, so there are no cross market switching opportunities. That said, there is a slight risk-on bias in the market today and we foresee the auctions passing without too much issue as there is little credit negative news in the market at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of historical data:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>0.45% 2022 <a name=\"_Hlk502733037\">prev. b/c 1.87 and average yield 0.29%</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.45% 2027 prev. b/c 1.95 and average yield 1.184%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.9% 2046 prev. b/c 1.55 and average yield 2.874%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.00% 2030 I/L&nbsp; prev. b/c 3.3 and average yield 0.832%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bids are submitted by 0930GMT and results are published shortly after</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: French EUR 8-9bln 0.75% 2028, 1.25% 2036 and 2.0% 2048 Bond Auction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SocGen</strong>: The OAT May 2048 has seen some pre-auction cheapening against other OATs, while in contrast the OAT 2028 and 2036 on offer have remained more stable relative to the curve.
