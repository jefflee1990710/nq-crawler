Recent comments by Governor Kuroda indicate that an exit in FY 18 might not be under consideration, while financial conditions have tightened following the recent equity market selloff and JPY appreciation. However, we also believe the BoJ&rsquo;s window of opportunity to normalize could narrow with fiscal contraction linked to the consumption tax hike, a derailed normalization process among major central banks, particularly the Fed, and/or mounting risk of JPY appreciation&quot;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May invited Conservative MP&rsquo;s who were trying to soften her Brexit stance into Downing Street for peace talks this evening. (Independent) In addition, there were also earlier reports that UK PM May was said to be close to an agreement on Brexit transition. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&rsquo;s Barnier aide Rynck said unlikely to have clarity on UK regarding a future relationship by this autumn and that a transition agreement is only certain at the end of Brexit talk when legal text is approved, while it was also reported that EU is planning to offer vague trade deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Markit/CIPS Services PMI (Feb) 54.5 vs. Exp. 53.3 (Prev. 53.0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Retail Sales MM (Jan) -0.1% vs. Exp. 0.3% (Prev. -1.1%, Rev. -1.0%)<br />EU Retail Sales YY (Jan) 2.3% vs. Exp. 2.1% (Prev. 1.9%, Rev. 2.1%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Markit Services Final PMI (Feb) 56.2 vs. Exp. 56.7 (Prev. 56.7)<br />EU Markit Comp Final PMI (Feb) 57.1 vs. Exp. 57.5 (Prev. 57.5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX<a name=\"_Hlk503148913\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148890\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148850\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD was stable on Monday amid trade war rhetoric out of the US, and promises of retaliation from other countries; the buck was supported by Treasury yields, with the curve bear-steepening; there was little action after generally upbeat non-mfg ISM and Markit PMIs.<br /><br />JPY has gradually weakened since the dovish testimonies of BOJ Dep Gov Wakatabe and Amamiya at their confirmation hearing before lawmakers overnight, but action seems capped by 106.20, which was solid support last week.<br /><br />CAD was the day&rsquo;s highest profile casualty, and USDCAD printed fresh YTD highs near 1.30 (said to be a barrier in play at the level) after US Pres Trump tweeted about &ldquo;large&rdquo; trade deficits with Canada and Mexico, and that NAFTA has been a bad deal for the US. MXN was also on the back foot, though the air seems thin as USDMXN approaches the 19 handle, and the USDMXN dropping to session lows in late trade as the NAFTA press conference was underway (lows around 18.7750 at the US cash close).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR was battling competing drivers: on the one hand good news from Germany, after the SPD members voted to join a grand coalition, however, weekend elections in Italy raise uncertainty levels, with M5S the largest party, though some note it will be difficult for them to form a coalition; the net effect was EUR trading neutral around the 1.2325 area. AUD trades flat ahead of this evening&rsquo;s RBA rate decision, where it is expected to keep rates unchanged at 1.50%, while the NZD&rsquo;s price action was being dictated by the USD-side of the pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP was boosted after solid services PMI in the European morning, which rose above expectations, helping to push cable above 1.38. The currency got a lift before the European close, after reports suggested that the UK is close to a transition agreement, which pushed GBP through the 1.3850-60 resistance; but the currency couldn&rsquo;t stay at those levels, and after sobering talk from Barnier aide who said a transition agreement is only certain at the end of Brexit talks, GBP began to ease.<br /><br /><a name=\"_Hlk507704203\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC Secretary General Barkindo stated that everyone has gained from OPEC-led output cuts and that demand has not been this solid &amp; positive in a long time. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IEA sharply raised US oil output growth estimates by over 2mln bpd to 2023 and sees global oil demand increasing by 6.9mln bpd by 2023. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is said to consider new military action against the Syrian government. (Washington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korean Leader Kim states that it is his firm will to advance inter-Korean relations and write new history of unification, while Kim is also reported to have agreed to meet with South Korean President Moon following talks. (KCNA/Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said if a good deal can be made on NAFTA then steel tariffs can be addressed for Canada and Mexico, while he also stated that he is not backing down on Trade and that he doesn&rsquo;t think there will be a trade war. Furthermore, President Trump tweeted that &quot;tariffs will only come off if new and fair NAFTA agreement is signed&quot;, states NAFTA has been a bad deal for the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said NAFTA talks have not made progress they had hoped for, while he added that Canada and Mexico will get a tariff exclusion with a new NAFTA agreement which will be an incentive to conclude a deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada sees any tariffs on steel or aluminium as unacceptable and stated they would take suitable measures to protect workers and industries if necessary. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Republican Senator Cochran is to resign on April 1<sup>st</sup> amid ongoing health issues. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US ISM N-Manufacturing PMI (Feb) 59.5 vs. Exp. 58.9 (Prev. 59.9)<br />US Markit Services PMI Final (Feb) 55.9 (Prev. 55.9)<br />US Markit Comp Final PMI (Feb) 55.8 (Prev. 55.9)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity traders ignored the spectre of trade wars, with indices swinging higher in afternoon trade, with the EMINI S&amp;P 500 climbing back to the 2720 level. Gains were broad-based, with all major sectors in the green. Some expect Trump to back-down from his tough trade talk, as senior GOP members, like Paul Ryan today, urge the President to not implement tariffs. SPX +1.1% at 2721, DJI +1.3% at 24880, NDX +1.0 at 6881.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were bid in the US pre-market, with concerns about the potential fallout from trade wars keeping traders looking for safe assets, and some traders also cited Italian political risks as being supportive at the margin. Treasuries were also said to be influenced by the impending corporate supply from CVS after its $69bln acquisition of Aetna (could see $40bln of supply from CVS), which has been well telegraphed. The risk tone improved after the US open, when equities and crude began rising, helping the curve to modestly bear-steepen (2s +0.4bps at 2.2418%; 5s +2.6bps at 2.6485%; 10s +3.1bps at 2.8881%; 30s +3.3bps at 3.1646%). Ex-bills, there is no supply out of the US Treasury this week, though it is expected to announce $62bln of 3s/10s/30s to be auctioned next week. US 10yr T-note futures settled 4+ ticks lower at 120-21.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li>DOWNLOAD FULL MARKET WRAP REPORT WITH NEWS SUMMARY AND DAY-AHEAD PREVIEW <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/18718/download\">HERE</a></li>\r\n  <li><strong>US major equity indices up, Treasuries lower, dollar slightly higher, crude up</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Trump continues tough trade talk, hitting CAD and MXN</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>EUR neutral as German SPD vote off-sets Italian election uncertainty</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>RBA overnight; BOC, ECB, BOJ later this week; CERA week in focus for energy traders</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +1.1% at 2721, DJI +1.3% at 24880, NDX +1.0 at 6881. Sectors: Energy +1.1%, Materials +1.4%, Industrials 1.2%, Consumer Discretionary +1.1, Consumer Staples +0.9%, Healthcare +0.9, Financials +1.4, IT +0.9%, Telecoms +1.0, Utilities +2.0.</strong><br />Equity traders ignored the spectre of trade wars, with indices swinging higher in afternoon trade, with the EMINI S&amp;P 500 climbing back to the 2720 level. Gains were broad-based, with all major sectors in the green. Some expect Trump to back-down from his tough trade talk, as senior GOP members, like Paul Ryan today, urge the President to not implement tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY +0.2% HEADING INTO APAC TRADE AT 90.084.</strong><br />The <strong>USD</strong> was stable on Monday amid trade war rhetoric out of the US, and promises of retaliation from other countries; the buck was supported by Treasury yields, with the curve bear-steepening; there was little action after generally upbeat non-mfg ISM and Markit PMIs. <strong>JPY</strong> has gradually weakened since the dovish testimonies of BOJ Dep Gov Wakatabe and Amamiya at their confirmation hearing before lawmakers overnight, but action seems capped by 106.20, which was solid support last week. The <strong>CAD</strong> was the day&rsquo;s highest profile casualty, and USDCAD printed fresh YTD highs near 1.30 (said to be a barrier in play at the level) after US Pres Trump tweeted about &ldquo;large&rdquo; trade deficits with Canada and Mexico, and that NAFTA has been a bad deal for the US. <strong>MXN</strong> was also on the back foot, though the air seems thin as USDMXN approaches the 19 handle, and the USDMXN dropping to session lows in late trade as the NAFTA press conference was underway (lows around 18.7750 at the US cash close). <strong>EUR</strong> was battling competing drivers: on the one hand good news from Germany, after the SPD members voted to join a grand coalition, however, weekend elections in Italy raise uncertainty levels, with M5S the largest party, though some note it will be difficult for them to form a coalition; the net effect was EUR trading neutral around the 1.2325 area. <strong>AUD</strong> trades flat ahead of this evening&rsquo;s RBA rate decision, where it is expected to keep rates unchanged at 1.50%, while the <strong>NZD</strong>&rsquo;s price action was being dictated by the USD-side of the pair. <strong>GBP</strong> was boosted after solid services PMI in the European morning, which rose above expectations, helping to push cable above 1.38. The currency got a lift before the European close, after reports suggested that the UK is close to a transition agreement, which pushed GBP through the 1.3850-60 resistance; but the currency couldn&rsquo;t stay at those levels, and after sobering talk from Barnier aide who said a transition agreement is only certain at the end of Brexit talks, GBP began to ease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI FUTURES SETTLE $1.32 HIGHER AT $62.57 PER BARREL; BRENT FUTURE SETTLE $1.17 HIGHER AT $65.54 PER BARREL. </strong><br />Oil was trading higher pre-US open, after weekend news that production at Libya&rsquo;s Sharara field had been halted; however, NOC is said to have resumed pumping, with output expected to rise towards 300k BPD on Tuesday. The familiar narrative that has been weighing on crude returned, however, when IEA forecast US production would by 2.7mln BPD to 12.1mln BPD by 2023. This kept crude on the defensive, but oil did catch a bounce after Genscape reported that Cushing may show a draw of 687k barrels this week. This week, analysts expect crude stocks to build by 3.0mln, distillates are seen drawing 1.3mln barrels, and Gasoline is forecast to draw 1.8mln barrels. Attention will also be on comments from CERA week, where some big wigs of the energy industry are speaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME: US 10-YEAR T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLE 4+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-21. </strong><br />Treasuries were bid in the US pre-market, with concerns about the potential fallout from trade wars keeping traders looking for safe assets, and some traders also cited Italian political risks as being supportive at the margin. Treasuries were also said to be influenced by the impending corporate supply from CVS after its $69bln acquisition of Aetna (could see $40bln of supply from CVS), which has been well telegraphed. The risk tone improved after the US open, when equities and crude began rising, helping the curve to modestly bear-steepen (2s +0.4bps at 2.2418%; 5s +2.6bps at 2.6485%; 10s +3.1bps at 2.8881%; 30s +3.3bps at 3.1646%). Ex-bills, there is no supply out of the US Treasury this week, though it is expected to announce $62bln of 3s/10s/30s to be auctioned next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DOWNLOAD FULL MARKET WRAP REPORT WITH NEWS SUMMARY AND DAY-AHEAD PREVIEW <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/18718/download\">HERE</a></p>\r\n",

Later, the familiar narrative that has been weighing on crude returned; IEA forecast US production would by 2.7mln BPD to 12.1mln BPD by 2023. This kept crude on the defensive, but oil did catch a bounce after Genscape reported that Cushing may show a draw of 687k barrels this week. This week, analysts expect crude stocks to build by 3.0mln, distillates are seen drawing 1.3mln barrels, and Gasoline is forecast to draw 1.8mln barrels. Attention will also be on comments from CERA week, where some big wigs of the energy industry are speaking, including OPEC SecGen Barkindo on Monday evening and Tuesday. Additionally, tomorrow&#39;s STEO from the EIA will be eyed (Tuesday at 1700 GMT/1200 ET). (RANsquawk)</p>\r\n",

The 100 WMA around 1.2891 was breached on the way and now only 1.2994 (upper end of a 21 week band) protects the 1.3000 level where offers are touted ahead of more sell orders at 1.3025 and 1.3045. Note, Usd/Mxn traded north of 18.900 and the 3 NAFTA nations are due to issue a statement at the end of the 7<sup>th</sup> round of negotiations later today amidst reports that the next phase of talks could be in early April. Back to US Dollar/majors, the Aud and Nzd both remained weak on broad risk off sentiment and sub-consensus Chinese PMIs, around 0.7730 and 0.7220 respectively, while the Jpy and Chf traded towards the top of 105.90-35 and 0.9400-0.9350 ranges as EU equities pared some of their initial trade war and Italian election-related losses, with exporter supply seen in the former pair at 106.00. Indeed, the Eur managed to reclaim the 1.2300 handle and Eur/Gbp remained above 0.8900 despite Cable bouncing above 1.3800 from circa 1.3770 lows. The DXY is just keeping tabs on 90.000, but largely at the expense of others again, although the ISM services survey was mostly better than forecast.</p>\r\n",

This ongoing political uncertainty and rise of the Euro sceptics dampened the risk tone with <strong>ASX 200 (-0.6%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) </strong>negative throughout the session, while Japanese steel names and automakers remained pressured on lingering tariff/trade war concerns. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-2.3%)</strong> underperformed and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%)</strong> bucked the trend as participants contemplated over China&rsquo;s economic work report in which the official GDP growth target was maintained at 6.5% as widely expected, before disappointing Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI data. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher and reclaimed the 151.00 level, amid a rebound in Tnotes and a flight-to-quality due to the subdued risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Premier Li delivered the Economic Work Report at the NPC in which he announced that China maintained GDP growth target at about 6.5% this year but dropped reference to &lsquo;higher if possible&rsquo;. Premier Li further stated that China will keep prudent monetary policy neutral and maintain proactive fiscal policy, while China will also take further measures to lower tax burden for companies.

In related news, EU&#39;s Juncker said on Friday the EU will respond to US steel action which may involve tariffs on motorcycles, while there were also source reports that EU duties of about USD 3.5bln are to be considered if the US goes ahead with its tariff plan.

Following the results, Italian League Head Salvini says the party is not available for bizarre coalitions, adding that the centre right coalition has won and can govern, adding that he is open to talks with all parties but rules out a broad coalition.

(BBC) Merkel is set to be sworn in for her fourth term on 14th March. Note, the SPD is yet to formally appoint their new ministers but, as previously announced, Olaf Scholz, looks set to be the new finance minister. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU is reportedly set to uncover differences with the UK in draft <strong>Brexit</strong> guidelines with the proposals to be vague to force UK to explain what it is seeking, according to reports. (Guardian) Elsewhere, EU negotiators will this week offer a Canada-style trade deal putting pressure on Theresa May&rsquo;s Brexit &lsquo;red lines&rsquo;. (Telegraph) Further reports suggest, the European Commission is preparing to take a hard line over plans to &ldquo;roll over&rdquo; 50 EU free trade agreements during the Brexit transition period, in a threat to British exports.

As of now, major bourses have pared back earlier losses <strong>(Eurostoxx 50 +0.3%)</strong> with the exception of <strong>FTSE MIB (-1.2%)</strong> as a clear underperformer. Financials lag with banks amongst the worst performers on the FTSE MIB with BPER Banca (-7.3%), Banco BPM (-6.2%), Ubi Banca (-4.6%) seen at the foot of the index dragged down by the Italian elections. The Berlusconi-controlled Mediaset (-5.4%) are also lower following projections showing the centre-right coalition fronted by the former PM falling short of an absolute majority. Following US President Trump&rsquo;s latest threat to hike tariffs in EU auto imports, German auto names are underperforming with DAX 30 heavyweights BMW (-1.1%) and Daimler (-0.4%) seen lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY has given up 90.000 status after last week&rsquo;s roller-coaster ride when the index almost recovered to 91.000 before recoiling on US President Trump&rsquo;s plans to slap import tariffs on steel and aluminium that sparked another wave of global trade war and protectionism jitters. However, a recovery in the EUR has moved EUR/USD back above 1.2300 and moved the DXY back into negative territory for the session. Meanwhile, <strong>Eur/Jpy</strong> initially breached strong technical support at 129.50 before reclaiming 130.00 amid the recent EUR strength. Elsewhere, the <strong>Nzd, Aud</strong> and <strong>Cad</strong> are G10 underperformers after Chinese PMI misses and a general risk-off tone on the Trump proposals and pledges of retaliation, with the <strong>Kiwi</strong> extending gains above 0.7200 vs the Greenback, <strong>Aud/Usd</strong> trading around 0.7750 and <strong>Usd/Cad</strong> just off fresh 2018 highs but back below 1.2900 and just shy of key resistance in the 1.2915-25 area. The <strong>Jpy</strong> and <strong>Chf</strong> are both benefiting from their safe-haven appeal, with the former around 105.50 vs the <strong>Usd</strong> (strong barriers still reported at 105.00) and the latter within a 0.9750-85 range vs its US counterpart. <strong>Cable</strong> at session highs above 1.3800 and <strong>Eur/Gbp</strong> still above 0.8900 between 0.8905-50 with Sterling continuing to be hampered by Brexit uncertainty amidst more reports about the EU&rsquo;s hard-line stance on transition terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bit more follow-through selling, partly o the back of the UK services PMI beat, which for the record also chimes with the CBI&rsquo;s 3 month rolling index for the sector that hit 20 in February from 9 previously. <strong>Gilts</strong> have now been as low 121.47, -13 ticks vs +33 ticks at best, while <strong>Bunds</strong> erased all their gains and tad more at 159.71 having been 61 ticks ahead at one stage &ndash; inching closer to a technical gap at 159.65. Safe-haven bonds also acknowledging the recovery in EU bourses. <strong>US Treasuries</strong> remain firm and still in bull-flattening mode amidst heightened global trade war risk and ramifications. Back to Eurex, there is a chart gap down to 159.65.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> crude futures traded higher despite the firmer USD as Libyan supply disruptions provide some reprieve after Libya&rsquo;s Sharara oil field (largest in the nation) has halted pumping crude amid domestic protests. However, it was then later reported that production has resumed at the oil field. In terms of other energy newsflow, the IEA have upgraded their US oil output growth estimates by over 2mln bpd through 2023. Focus ahead will be on any comments from the meeting between OPEC and US shale producers as both sides look to address the ongoing global oil glut. In metals markets, <strong>gold</strong> prices remain modestly supported by the general risk tone with gains capped by the firmer USD. Elsewhere, Chinese <strong>steel</strong> futures were seen lower for a second consecutive session as demand in the region remains soft and despite China announcing that they will reduce around 30mln tonnes of steel capacity this year. Focus going forward will be on how Trump views/responds to threats made by the EU and Canada over counter-measures to last week&rsquo;s tariff announcements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libya&#39;s NOC declared a force majeure on loadings at El Sharara, according to sources.

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: Italian assets lag their peers as political concerns take centre-stage. EU bourses claw back initial losses. Trade wars remain a hot topic",
        "content": "<p>Amidst the prospects of ongoing global &lsquo;trade wars&rsquo; and the political uncertainty stemming from the Italian elections, European equities saw a pessimistic open following a similar tone in the Asia-Pac session. As of now, major bourses have pared back earlier losses (Eurostoxx 50 +0.4%) with the exception of FTSE MIB (-1.0%) as a clear underperformer. Financials lag with banks amongst the worst performers on the FTSE MIB with Banco BPM (-6.7%), BPER Banca (-5%), Ubi Banca (-4.7%) seen at the foot of the index dragged down by the Italian elections. The Berlusconi-controlled Mediaset (-5%) are also lower following projections showing the centre-right coalition fronted by the former PM falling short of an absolute majority. Following US President Trump&rsquo;s latest threat to hike tariffs in EU auto imports, German auto names are underperforming with DAX 30 heavyweights BMW (-1.2%) and Daimler (-0.3%) seen lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY has recaptured 90.000+ status (just) after last week&rsquo;s roller-coaster ride when the index almost recovered to 91.000 before recoiling on US President Trump&rsquo;s plans to slap import tariffs on steel and aluminium that sparked another wave of global trade war and protectionism jitters. However, the latest Dollar revival is largely due to the Eur&rsquo;s demise and weakness in wake of no clear result at the weekend Italian general election. Eur/Usd is trying to keep hold of the 1.2300 handle, but has been down to 1.2270, with some also noting that AXA&rsquo;S $15 bn bid for XL may have been a factor. Meanwhile, Eur/Jpy breached strong technical support at 129.50 on its way down to a circa 129.35 low before what looks like a short-covering bounce. Elsewhere, the Nzd, Aud and Cad are G10 underperformers after Chinese PMI misses and a general risk-off tone on the Trump proposals and pledges of retaliation, with the Kiwi only just keeping its head above 0.7200 vs the Greenback, Aud/Usd trading below 0.7750 and Usd/Cad at fresh 2018 highs around 1.2910 and just shy of key resistance in the 1.2915-25 area. The Jpy and Chf are both benefiting from their safe-haven appeal, with the former around 105.50 vs the Usd (strong barriers still reported at 105.00) and the latter within a 0.9750-85 range vs its US counterpart. Cable hovering either side of 1.3800 and Eur/Gbp still above 0.8900 between 0.8905-50 with Sterling continuing to be hampered by Brexit uncertainty amidst more reports about the EU&rsquo;s hard-line stance on transition terms and conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A sharp pull-back in Bunds and back down below 160.00 with little fuss, as the core EZ bond trades in lock-step with Italian BTPs that have recouped a lot of their election fall-out losses to sit near the top of a 136.71-135.90 range vs last Friday&rsquo;s 137.22 close. The German 10 year debt future just retreated to 159.81 having failed to test rising channel resistance around 160.45 or the 50% retracement at 160.52 with the high at 160.38. Similarly, Gilts have fallen back from 121.93 Liffe highs to 121.52 (-8 ticks), but didn&rsquo;t really track the initial/early rally with as much vigour due to ongoing Brexit factors, in contrast to US Treasuries that remain firm and still in bull-flattening mode amidst heightened global trade war risk and ramifications. Note, a knee-jerk downward reaction in UK bonds on the much better than expected services PMI that boosted the composite reading, but not enough to warrant IHS Markit changing its Q1 GDP forecast much from the previous quarter (almost 0.4% q/q vs 0.4% q/q respectively). Back to Eurex, there is a chart gap down to 159.65. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures traded higher despite the firmer USD as Libyan supply disruptions provide some reprieve after Libya&rsquo;s Sharara oil field (largest in the nation) has halted pumping crude amid domestic protests. However, it was then later reported that production has resumed at the oil field. In terms of other energy newsflow, the IEA have upgraded their US oil output growth estimates by over 2mln bpd through 2023. Focus ahead will be on any comments from the meeting between OPEC and US shale producers as both sides look to address the ongoing global oil glut. In metals markets, gold prices remain modestly supported by the general risk tone with gains capped by the firmer USD. Elsewhere, Chinese steel futures were seen lower for a second consecutive session as demand in the region remains soft and despite China announcing that they will reduce around 30mln tonnes of steel capacity this year. Focus going forward will be on how Trump views/responds to threats made by the EU and Canada over counter-measures to last week&rsquo;s tariff announcements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The German 10 year debt future just retreated to 159.90 having failed to test rising channel resistance around 160.45 or the 50% retracement at 160.52 with the high at 160.38. Similarly, Gilts have fallen back from 121.93 Liffe highs to 121.62 (+2 ticks), but didn&rsquo;t really track the initial/early rally with as much vigour due to ongoing Brexit factors, in contrast to US Treasuries that remain firm and still in bull-flattening mode amidst heightened global trade war risk and ramifications. Back to Eurex, 159.82 is interim support and there is a chart gap down to 159.65. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Note, Mattarella will choose the candidate which he deems to have the best chance of forming a government, not necessarily the candidate whose party gained the largest share of the vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- **In the week that follows this, the candidate will either accept the mandate and both houses will hold a vote on the appointment. Alternatively, if no deal can be agreed, Italy will then move on to a fresh round of consultations.**</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Potential outcomes</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Centre-right coalition (Forza Italia/Northern League): This had been touted as a likely option heading into the election. However, that&rsquo;d been under the assumption that Forza Italia would outperform the Northern League. Since this has not been the case, serious questions have been raised over the possibility of this partnership being formed as Berlusconi (Forza Italia) is unlikely to want to play junior to the Northern League or back its leader Matteo Salvini as a candidate for PM. Therefore, some serious compromises would need to be made in order for this option to go-ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Grand coalition (Forza Italia/Democratic Party): Heading into the election, this had been touted as the most likely outcome. However, the below-par performance by the Democratic Party makes this option mathematically difficult without involving the support of one of the more radical parties; an unlikely outcome. Furthermore, the poor performance of the Democratic Party makes the prospect of a centre-left coalition unviable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Populist Government (Five Star/Northern League/Brothers of Italy): Such a coalition would depend on the willingness of the Five Star Movement which at this stage appears to be unlikely (despite a recent softening of their opposition to coalitions) given their anti-establishment views. Furthermore, despite being of the populist mould, the coalition would hold fairly wide-ranging views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Repeat elections: Should all of the above options fail, Italian voters would be sent back to the voting booths in an attempt to break the deadlock. During this period, the current Gentiloni government would operate on a caretaker basis but the ongoing political uncertainty would likely act as a negative to Italian assets.</p>\r\n",

However, the latest Dollar revival is largely due to the Eur&rsquo;s demise and weakness in wake of no clear result at the weekend Italian general election. Eur/Usd is trying to keep hold of the 1.2300 handle, but has been down to 1.2270, with some also noting that AXA&rsquo;S $15 bn bid for XL may have been a factor. Meanwhile, Eur/Jpy breached strong technical support at 129.50 on its way down to a circa 129.35 low before what looks like a short-covering bounce. Elsewhere, the Nzd, Aud and Cad are G10 underperformers after Chinese PMI misses and a general risk-off tone on the Trump proposals and pledges of retaliation, with the Kiwi only just keeping its head above 0.7200 vs the Greenback, Aud/Usd trading below 0.7750 and Usd/Cad at fresh 2018 highs around 1.2910 and just shy of key resistance in the 1.2915-25 area. The Jpy and Chf are both benefiting from their safe-haven appeal, with the former around 105.50 vs the Usd (strong barriers still reported at 105.00) and the latter within a 0.9750-85 range vs its US counterpart. Cable hovering either side of 1.3800 and Eur/Gbp still above 0.8900 between 0.8905-50 with Sterling continuing to be hampered by Brexit uncertainty amidst more reports about the EU&rsquo;s hard-line stance on transition terms and conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began a risk-packed week with a downbeat tone as region digested Italian elections, China economic announcements and continued trade war concerns. Overnight focus was dominated by the elections in Italy which is headed for a hung parliament with no side on track for a majority. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement are projected to emerge as the largest single party and the Centre-Right bloc as the leading coalition, but with far-right junior coalition partner Northern League having possibly outperformed Berlusconi&rsquo;s Forza Italia. This ongoing political uncertainty and rise of the Euro sceptics dampened the risk tone with ASX 200 (-0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) negative throughout the session, while Japanese steel names and automakers remained pressured on lingering tariff/trade war concerns. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.2%) underperformed and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) initially bucked the trend as participants contemplated over China&rsquo;s economic work report in which the official GDP growth target was maintained at 6.5% as widely expected, before disappointing Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI data eventually weighed on the mainland. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher and reclaimed the 151.00 level, amid a rebound in Tnotes and a flight-to-quality due to the subdued risk tone.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin a risk-packed week with a downbeat tone as region digests Italian elections, China&rsquo;s economic targets and continued trade war concerns. Overnight focus has been dominated by the Italian elections which suggest the country is heading for a hung parliament with no side on track for a majority. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement are projected to emerge as the largest single party and Centre-Right bloc as the largest coalition, but with far-right junior coalition partner Northern League party possibly outperforming Berlusconi&rsquo;s Forza Italia. This ongoing political uncertainty and rise of the Euro sceptics has dampened the risk tone with ASX 200 (-0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) languishing in negative territory, while Japanese steel names and automakers remain pressured on lingering tariff/trade war concerns. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.3%) underperforms and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) initially bucked the trend as participants contemplated over the China economic work report in which the official GDP growth target was maintained at 6.5% as widely expected, before disappointing Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI data eventually weighed on the mainland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, EUR/USD took centre stage with the pair as indecisive as the stalemate in Sunday&rsquo;s election, with the political landscape likely to be unclear possibility for weeks amid coalition talks. This saw EUR/USD choppy with participants second-guessing the impact of the early projections, which also wiped out the initial upside from news over the weekend that German Chancellor Merkel is set to form a 4<sup>th</sup> government after the SPD voted in favour of a coalition with Merkel&rsquo;s conservatives. Elsewhere, the greenback somewhat benefitted from EUR-woes and as commodity-linked currencies were dampened after the disappointing Chinese data, while JPY outperforms on safe-haven flows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices attempting a reclaim of the 151.00 level, amid a rebound in Tnotes and a flight-to-quality due to the subdued risk tone.</p>\r\n",
