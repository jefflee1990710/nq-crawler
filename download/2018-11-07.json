He briefly touched on trade, stating he will try to make a deal with China whilst highlighting that Japan does not treat the US fairly on trade as it exports cars at low prices. He announced there will be changes in top administration jobs, but &quot;nothing monumental&quot;; he finally mentioned he does not like the OPEC monopoly. In later comments, Leader of the House of Representatives Pelosi revealed that the infrastructure plan could tackle water systems, roads, high-speed broadband, schools and housing and she expects to tackle efforts to lower prescription drug prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JEFF SESSIONS</strong> has resigned from the US Attorney General position on request of US President Trump who announced Matthew G. Whitaker, previously Sessions&#39; Chief of Staff, will become acting Attorney General. Trump added that a permanent replacement to be nominated at a later date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RBNZ: </strong>The RBNZ kept the OCR unchanged at 1.75% as expected and stated that the timing and the direction of any future rate OCR moves remain data dependent. Guidance was unchanged up to 2020, but upgraded for 2021, with the RBNZ now seeing the OCR at 2.41% in December 2021 (Prev. 1.8%). The central bank highlighted that higher fuel prices are boosting headline inflation with CPI expected to gradually rise towards the 2% midpoint. It partially attributed the pickup in GDP in Q2 to temporary factors, noting that business surveys are likely to continue suggesting soft growth in near term, but a pick-up is expected over 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May was said to have invited key ministers to look over a &quot;nearly there&quot; Brexit draft, although No.10 sources noted the draft withdrawal agreement does not include the Irish backstop, as that has not yet been agreed; this makes the emergency meeting likely to be delayed until next week. With regards to UK-EU negotiations, EU&#39;s Chief Negotiator Barnier said on Wednesday that talks with UK remain intensive, stressing that without a backstop on the Irish border there will be no Brexit deal. On a more positive note, Irish PM Varadkar announced they are entering what he hopes will be the final few weeks of striking a deal while showing his willingness to consider a review clause in the backstop; he nonetheless warned a deal in November is unlikely. Despite this, there were reports suggesting that the DUP was &lsquo;very;&rsquo; unhappy over the proposal of NI being tied more closely to the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Sources reported the US Commerce department is set to impose final anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties of 96.3% to 176.2% on Chinese common aluminium sheet; this is subject to final injury determination by the US International Trade Commission, scheduled for December 20th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> ECB&#39;s President Draghi told Italian Finance Minister Tria, at the closed-door EZ Finance Minister meeting, to stick to fiscal discipline beyond EU rules whilst Tria told ministers that he acted as a politician rather than an economist in budget talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +2.12% at 2814, NDX +3.07% at 7203, DJI +2.13% at 26181. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +1.66%, Materials +1.88%, Industrials +1.68%, Cons Discretionary +3.12%, Cons Staples +0.55%, Healthcare +2.93%, Financials +1.34%, Tech +2.87%, Telecoms +1.93%, Utilities +1.05%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and Noble Energy (NBL) were top movers today after the state of Colorado voted for policies that didn&rsquo;t restrict the co&rsquo;.s oil drilling. Healthcare stocks also made gains today as election results came in as expected with WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Centene (CNC) and Anthem (ANTM) all trading higher. Michael Kors (KORS) bagged itself a loss today following a miss on revenue and cutting its EPS guidance. Coty (COTY) and DXC Technologies (DXC) also reported earnings where both missed revenue estimates making them bottom movers. Several utility names also traded lower today such as General Electric (GE) and Emerson Electric (EMR).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.54 LOWER AT USD 61.67/BBL, BRENT (F8) SETTLES USD 0.06 LOWER AT USD 72.07/BBL.</strong> Oil prices rose in early trade today after a report that Russia, Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ countries are discussing oil production cuts. Russian Energy Minister Novak said he will gather the nation&#39;s key oil executives to discuss plans and an agenda this Thursday, ahead of the OPEC+ meeting in Abu Dhabi this weekend. OPEC delegates laid blame on Russia and Saudi for drops in oil prices and suggested they cut production by 1mln bpd immediately. Oil prices later pared back gains turning negative following a greater than expected build in the DoE releases where headline crude showed a larger than expected build. More downward pressure came after the FT reported sources saying that Russia is looking to increase crude output next year by 0.3mln bpd unless a deal is struck with Saudi Arabia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES HALF-A-TICK LOWER AT 117-31+. </strong>Treasuries drifted lower in post-elections trade as the Republicans kept the majority in Senate and Democrats retained control of the House, as expected, with the complex unreactive to US Attorney General Sessions resignation. The curve saw some modest bear-flattening as short-dated yields were higher by c.2bps while the long end showed yields below 1bps at settlement. 2s30s and 2s30s narrowed by c.3bps. The US Treasury sold 19bln in 30yr bonds, at a high yield of 3.344% tailing by 2.3bps. Demand was significantly weak with the bid-to-cover at the lowest level since February 2009. Looking at the breakdown, directs were awarded the smallest portion since September 2009, indirects took the smallest share since March and dealers were left with the largest slice since August 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD:</strong> The Dollar has staged a pretty impressive recovery after extending losses across the board in wake of the US mid-term election results that saw the Republicans lose control of the House, but strengthen its grip of the Senate. The DXY is back up near 96.000 having tested and breached rather than convincingly break below a Fib support level circa 95.700, though whether it can reclaim its 21 DMA around 96.030 remains to be seen. Thursday&rsquo;s FOMC statement may be key and for a full preview please check out our Research Suite or the Headline Feed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD: </strong>Off best levels amidst the broad Greenback bounce, but still some distance ahead of their major counterparts as the Kiwi hovers just below 0.6800 and the Aud unwinds some of its underperformance down under with the aid of cross-winds to edge closer to 0.7300 and 1.0750 respectively. The RBNZ did not provide much fireworks for the Nzd/Usd keeping the currency close to session highs just above 0.6780. Focus now turn to RBNZ press-conference just after the market close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, EUR, GBP, CAD, JPY:</strong> All retaining relatively healthy gains vs the Buck, with the Franc still towards the upper end of a 1.0050-0.9950 range and not unduly deterred by official rhetoric (SNB via the Swiss Government) reiterating that the Chf is highly valued and inflation is low, so intervention and accommodation remain appropriate. The single currency has given 1.1500 a severe test, but now back down around its 30DMA (1.1479), while the Pound has eased back towards 1.3150 vs 1.3175, and Eur/Gbp is midway between 0.8710-45 even though reports continue to lean positively with regard to Brexit (PM May said to be convening key Ministers to cast eyes over a nearly done draft, although EU&rsquo;s Barnier repeats that more negotiation is needed and work to be done). Usd/Cad retreated from the 1.3160-1.3055 parameters seen earlier in the session towards 1.3100 as the crude complex gave up some of its gains, while the Jpy failed to really clear resistance at 113.00 when the Buck appeared unable to stop the rot and has retreated towards 113.50, albeit some distance from overnight lows closer to 113.80.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: </strong>PREVIEW: FOMC Meeting due at 1400 EST/1900 GMT on Thursday 8th November 2018. Rate decision and statement to be published at 1400 EST/1900 BST on Thursday 8th November 2018 due to election day on November 6th. The FOMC will likely hold the fed funds rate target between 2.00 &ndash; 2.25%, no economic projections or post-meeting press conference with Chair Powell will leave focus on the statement. There are risks that the FOMC could issue a statement on financial conditions following the recent market fallout. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20503/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>* SUPPLY: The US Treasury will auction USD 83bln in 3-year (USD 37bln, Monday), 10-year (USD 27bln, Tuesday), and 30-year (USD 19bln, Wednesday). With USD 54.3bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, the auctions are set to raise USD 28.7bln of new supply. TD Securities also notes that there will be USD 34.3bln of SOMA holdings maturing at the mid-month, and the Fed set to add-on USD 7.6bln to 3s, USD 5.5bln to 10s, and USD 3.9bln to the 30s; TD also notes that the Fed balance sheet run-off hit full pace last month, with the central bank now allowing USD 30bln to roll-off per month. Looking at this week&#39;s auctions as a whole, TD Securities says &quot;higher yields and equity market volatility present an interesting opportunity for investors to dip their toes in long end rates,&quot; and &quot;the steepening of the curve also represents an opportunity for investors to re-engage in flatteners, particularly as growth momentum remains strong (as evidenced by Friday&#39;s payroll data).&quot; But TD does note that the previous cycle of auctions a fortnight ago suggested some softness in direct bidder participation, and as of late, dealer inventories have also risen in recent weeks, and the bank believes that could suggest the potential for upward pressure on rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent history depicts strong results for the 30yr which &ldquo;was the only tenor that saw a pickup in demand&rdquo;, Barclays says. On top of this, recent steepening and recent rates uphold are expected to provide even further support to the bid-to-cover which posted at 2.4x in October, the highest so far since the start of the year, TD Securities notes. In terms of participation, foreign and domestic investors continue to show strong interest, taking on around 60% of supply. Similarly, foreign investors&rsquo; slice of the cake has risen significantly after securing 13% of total supply in October, rising from 8% in July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent Auction History:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Tail size: (Prev. on the screws, six-auction average: stops-through by 0.2bps)</li>\r\n  <li>Bid-to-Cover: (Prev. 2.42x, six-auction average 2.36x)</li>\r\n  <li>High-yield (Prev. 3.344%, six-auction average: 3.118%)</li>\r\n  <li>Dealers (Prev. 22.8%, six-auction average: 27.3%)</li>\r\n  <li>Directs % (Prev. 12.8%, six-auction average: 10.2%)</li>\r\n  <li>Indirects (Prev. 64.4%, six-auction average: 62.5%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Kiwi aloft ahead of RBNZ, but Buck needs fillip from FOMC ",
        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar has staged a pretty impressive recovery after extending losses across the board in wake of the US mid-term election results that saw the Republicans lose control of the House, but strengthen its grip of the Senate. The DXY is back up near 96.000 having tested and breached rather than convincingly break below a Fib support level circa 95.700, though whether it can reclaim its 21 DMA around 96.030 remains to be seen. Thursday&rsquo;s FOMC statement may be key and for a full preview please check out our Research Suite or the Headline Feed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Off best levels amidst the broad Greenback bounce, but still some distance ahead of their major counterparts as the Kiwi hovers just below 0.6800 and the Aud unwinds some of its underperformance down under with the aid of cross-winds to edge closer to 0.7300 and 1.0750 respectively. For the Nzd, attention turns to the RBNZ and realistic prospect of a more upbeat economic assessment (akin to the RBA last week) given overnight data showing a much rosier than expected NZ jobs market in Q3, on top of CPI rising towards the middle of its target range in the previous quarter &ndash; as per the Fed, a full RBNZ outlook is available via the Ransquawk website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/GBP/CAD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All retaining relatively healthy gains vs the Buck, with the Franc still towards the upper end of a 1.0050-0.9950 range and not unduly deterred by official rhetoric (SNB via the Swiss Government) reiterating that the Chf is highly valued and inflation is low, so intervention and accommodation remain appropriate. The single currency has given 1.1500 a severe test, but now back down around its 30DMA (1.1479), while the Pound has eased back towards 1.3150 vs 1.3175, and Eur/Gbp is midway between 0.8710-45 even though reports continue to lean positively with regard to Brexit (PM May said to be convening key Ministers to cast eyes over a nearly done draft, although EU&rsquo;s Barnier repeats that more negotiation is needed and work to be done). A couple of independent props for the Loonie keeping Usd/Cad nearer the base of 1.3160-1.3055 parameters, including a crude rebound and perky Canadian Ivey PMI, while the Jpy failed to really clear resistance at 113.00 when the Buck appeared unable to stop the rot and has retreated towards 113.50, albeit some distance from overnight lows closer to 113.80.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires) Note, the outcome of Democrats taking control of the house and Republicans of the Senate was the market consensus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian equity markets traded cautious as all focus centred on the US mid-term election results. A strong start for the Democrats weighed on US equity futures in early trade, although stock futures then recovered after further results and projections trickled in which suggested the unlikelihood of a Blue Tsunami (Democrat-controlled House and Senate) as the Republicans won in key Senate battlegrounds such as Indiana and tightly-contested Texas. As such, there was a non-committal tone in most Asia bourses with ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) choppy, while Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) was initially bolstered by recent favourable currency moves before dipping into the red. Hang Seng (+0.1%) briefly outperformed amid a tech-led surge, before slipping into the red. Finally, price action in 10yr JGBs reflected the non-committal risk tone as participants second-guessed the election results and amid jittery trade in T-notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.9065 (Prev. 6.9075)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is planning new tax-cut measures. (Economic Information Daily)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May has created five new business councils to advise on how to create the best business conditions in the UK after Brexit. (BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DUP Chief Whip Donaldson says we don&#39;t want a no deal, and the backstop is about annexing Northern Ireland from Britain; adding that it is in the public&#39;s interest for UK government legal advice on the backstop to be published. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irish PM Varadkar says that we are entering what he hopes will be the final few weeks of striking a deal on Brexit; the objective of avoiding a hard border is more important than the mechanism and is willing to consider a backstop review clause. Adding that it is possible to come to an agreement on Brexit in November, with the view of having a summit in December. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg tweets that chatter that an amendment calling for Irish border legal advice may be laid next week, and would have the support of the DUP and Brexiteers. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swiss government states that following talks with SNB&#39;s Jordan, the CHF remains highly valued, inflation is too low, the FX market is fragile and are ready to intervene in FX markets. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s President Draghi told Italian Finance Minister Tria to stick to fiscal discipline beyond EU rules at the closed-door EZ Finance Minister meeting; according to sources. Italy&#39;s Finance Minister Tria told EZ finance Ministers that he acted as a politician rather than an economist in budget talks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are positive across the board as investors digest the consequences of a split Congress, with US equity futures edging higher as some traders see the Democratic House majority as a prospect for trade policies to be reeled in slightly, albeit a lot of powers will still be retained by Trump. It is also worth noting the split Congress may translate to less fiscal stimuli as US tax reforms would face greater obstacles when passing through Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of how the results could affect specific sectors, infrastructure names may be impacted as a split in Congress could further delay the process to pass Trump&rsquo;s ambitious spending boosts, while healthcare names may also take a hit as Democrats pledged to lower drug prices in a response to US citizens&rsquo; concerns about healthcare. On the flip side, automakers and miners may fare better if markets believe the Democrat win might be able to water down Trump&rsquo;s trade reform. Finally, clean-energy names may also be supported as a&nbsp; greater Dem influence would benefit these companies given Trump&rsquo;s scepticism on global warming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going back to Europe, sectors are largely experiencing broad-based gains, while IT names lag. Spain&#39;s IBEX outperforms as banking names (Caixabank +3.8%, Sabadell +2.9%, Santander +2.8%, BBVA +2.4%) benefit from reports the Supreme court ruled that banks are not required to pay mortgage stamp duty, which saves the banks from potentially having to reimburse billions of EUR to borrowers, although source reports noted that the Spanish government is to propose a law change so banks pay mortgage stamp duties, which contradicts the ruling. In terms of individual movers, Adidas (-1.9%) is the laggard in the German benchmark after revenues missed expectations, while Fresenius Medical (+9.0%) and Mediclinic (+5.0%) rose to the top of their respective indices after voters in California rejected a proposal to cap profits on dialysis companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - A relatively marked retreat in the index amidst broad Greenback losses in wake of the US mid-term elections, as currency markets factor in the prospect of policy protraction and a more difficult passage for President Trump&rsquo;s fiscal agenda through a divided Congress. The DXY has lost grip of the 96.000 handle and also breached pre-NFP lows to test support/underlying bids around 95.700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi is just outperforming G10 peers with the added incentive of strong Q3 NZ jobs data in the run-up to tonight&rsquo;s RBNZ policy meeting following an acceleration in Q2 inflation. Nzd/Usd has flown through 0.6750 and now approaching 0.6800, with the possibility of a more upbeat accompanying statement from the RBNZ likely to provide more momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/AUD/GBP - Also firmly ahead vs the Usd, with the Franc back above parity and almost testing 0.9950 resistance despite latest SNB assurances that an accommodative and proactive stance is necessary due to fragile FX moves. The single currency has put aside persistent Italian budget concerns to clear some key upside technical levels, including 21 and 30 DMAs (1.1453 and 1.1479 respectively) to test a Fib just a fraction below 1.1500 where a whole host of orders are anticipated ranging from stops, option expiry and barrier hedging. The Aud is partially piggy-backing its antipodean counterpart, as the cross holds above 1.0700, but also extending post-RBA gains after upgrades to the 2018 and 2019 growth outlooks to probe offers/resistance ahead of 0.7300. Meanwhile, Cable continues to climb on Brexit hopes as well as the indirect bid via Buck weakness, and has now advanced above 1.3150 to circa 1.3175.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD - Both lagging other majors amidst the post-midterm Dollar demise, but still well ahead and rebounding from recent lows around 113.00 and 1.3075 respectively, with the Loonie also benefiting from a recovery in oil prices amidst reports that Russia and Saudi Arabia may discuss crude output cuts in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Everyone&rsquo;s a winner vs the increasingly down-trodded Usd, and even the Rouble that could yet face more US sanctions &ndash; Usd/Rub sub-66.0000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.0%) and WTI (+0.9%) are both higher on the day due to dollar weakness and general market sentiment, with a recent uptick in prices attribute to sources noting that Russia and Saudi Arabia are to begin discussing production cuts in 2019. In regards to Iran, the Nigerian oil minister stated that OPEC needs data on Iranian oil production ahead of the 6th December meeting, while adding that Iranian sanctions may not lead to a &quot;nose dive&quot; in Iranian oil output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last night&rsquo;s API crude inventories showed a build of 7.8mln barrels, which was more than three times the expected 2.4mln barrels. Traders will be mindful of the weekly DoE crude inventories for any signs of rising US crude production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.7%) hovering near session highs of USD 1235.4/oz as a weaker dollar boosts the yellow metal.

Turning to US Treasuries, futures remain firm and the curve flatter on the more taxing and less fiscally expansive outlook for policy post-midterms rather than the prospect of 30 year supply and a still relatively hawkish FOMC.</p>\r\n",

The DXY has lost grip of the 96.000 handle and also breached pre-NFP lows to test support/underlying bids around 95.700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is just outperforming G10 peers with the added incentive of strong Q3 NZ jobs data in the run-up to tonight&rsquo;s RBNZ policy meeting following an acceleration in Q2 inflation. Nzd/Usd has flown through 0.6750 and now approaching 0.6800, with the possibility of a more upbeat accompanying statement from the RBNZ likely to provide more momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/AUD/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also firmly ahead vs the Usd, with the Franc back above parity and almost testing 0.9950 resistance despite latest SNB assurances that an accommodative and proactive stance is necessary due to fragile FX moves. The single currency has put aside persistent Italian budget concerns to clear some key upside technical levels, including 21 and 30 DMAs (1.1453 and 1.1479 respectively) to test a Fib just a fraction below 1.1500 where a whole host of orders are anticipated ranging from stops, option expiry and barrier hedging. The Aud is partially piggy-backing its antipodean counterpart, as the cross holds above 1.0700, but also extending post-RBA gains after upgrades to the 2018 and 2019 growth outlooks to probe offers/resistance ahead of 0.7300. Meanwhile, Cable continues to climb on Brexit hopes as well as the indirect bid via Buck weakness, and has now advanced above 1.3150 to circa 1.3175.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both lagging other majors amidst the post-midterm Dollar demise, but still well ahead and rebounding from recent lows around 113.00 and 1.3075 respectively, with the Loonie also benefiting from a recovery in oil prices amidst reports that Russia and Saudi Arabia may discuss crude output cuts in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone&rsquo;s a winner vs the increasingly down-trodded Usd, and even the Rouble that could yet face more US sanctions &ndash; Usd/Rub sub-66.0000.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets traded cautious as all focus centred on the US mid-term election results in which the Democrats took control of the House and Republicans retained the Senate which was the consensus heading into the election. A strong start for the Democrats weighed on US equity futures in early trade, although stock futures then recovered after further results and projections trickled in which suggested the unlikelihood of a Blue Tsunami (Democrat-controlled House and Senate) as the Republicans won in key Senate battlegrounds such as Indiana and tightly-contested Texas. As such, there was a non-committal tone in most Asia bourses with ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) rangebound, while Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) was bolstered by recent favourable currency moves and the Hang Seng (-0.1%) briefly outperformed amid a tech-led surge, before slipping into the red. Finally, price action in 10yr JGBs reflected the non-committal risk tone as participants second-guessed the election results and amid jittery trade in T-notes.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Equity markets trade with cautious gains as all focus centres on the US mid-term election results, which are still in the early stages but would suggest a tighter race than the earlier projections of a firm Democrat win. Reports initially suggested an over-90% probability for the Democrats to take a majority in the House which subsequently weighed on US equity futures. However, US stocks futures then recovered as pollsters briefly readjusted the possibility of a Democrat-controlled House to just over 50% as further results and projections trickled which suggested a more even race. As things currently stand, the Democrats have already picked up a net 11 seats out of the 23 needed in the House, although prospects of Blue Tsunami (Democrat-controlled House and Senate) look bleak after the Republicans picked up key the Senate battleground of Indiana. As such, there is a non-committal tone in most Asia bourses with ASX 200 (+0.1%), Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) rangebound, while Nikkei 225 outperforms as it coat-tails on recent favourable currency moves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX markets mostly trade choppy in which the greenback eventually recovered from early election-related pressure with price action at the whim of a closely-fought race for the House. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD are range-bound at the 1.1400 and 1.3100 handles respectively, while antipodeans are mixed as AUD mirrors the swings in risk sentiment and with NZD buoyed by strong jobs data in which the Unemployment Rate unexpectedly declined to 3.9% from 4.5%.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
