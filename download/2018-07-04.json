However, China&rsquo;s Finance Ministry later stated they will not implement tariffs before the US does. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is said to have asked Chancellor Hammond and Business Secretary Clarke to warn colleagues of the dangers in pressing for a hard Brexit at the meeting on Friday at Chequers. Elsewhere, there were also reports that ministers warned PM May not to sidestep controversial Brexit issues at the meeting amid concern focus on customs may neglect issues such as services sector and freedom of movement. (Newswires/Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary David Davis wrote to PM May in a last ditch attempt to warn her that her Brexit plan to be presented at Chequers is unworkable. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irish PM Varadkar said a hard Brexit is unlikely but must prepare and stated that UK-wide customs plan could apply. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB Supervisory Board Member Hakkarainen said 20 out of 50 UK banks and financial companies they had discussed exploring options on keeping banking passport, have applied for a license to operate in EU in time to get approval before Brexit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Markit/CIPS Services PMI (Jun) 55.1 vs. Exp. 54.0 (Prev. 54.0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some ECB policymakers are said to be concerned regarding some investors&rsquo; expectations for a hike in end-2019 which it views as too late, according to sources which suggested that the door is open for possible rate move in September or October next year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US ambassador to Germany told car industry bosses that US is ready to compromise regarding tariffs and that US would not impose tariffs if EU lifts tariffs on US cars, while it was also reported that BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen executives are to meet with the US ambassador today on tariffs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Markit Services Final PMI (Jun) 55.2 vs. Exp. 55.0 (Prev. 55.0). (Newswires)<br />EU Markit Composite Final PMI (Jun) 54.9 vs. Exp. 54.8 (Prev. 54.8)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that OPEC must remember gas prices are up and they are driving prices higher, while he urged them to reduce pricing now. (Twitter)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK police state that the 2 recent poisonings in Amesbury involved the same substance that was used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in March. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US markets were shut for Independence Day, while European equities were mixed but with auto names in the green, on reports that the EU is considering talks with the leading global auto exporters in efforts to avoid a full-blown trade war and that heads of Daimler, BMW and VW are set to meet the US ambassador to Germany on Wednesday in an effort to avoid US tariffs. Conversely, European tech names were under pressure after Micron lost a patent lawsuit in China, while US equity futures were open for a shortened holiday session, though trade was subdued with US traders away and with ES price action was stuck around the 50dma at 2725.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thin, rangebound trade with little of note standing out. Attention is on trade headlines, with the EU said to be flirting with cutting tariffs on autos; however, with USD 34 billion of tariffs on Chinese products coming into effect on 6 July, China is expected to retaliate, likely resulting in trade concerns rising once again. FOMC minutes on Thursday and June&rsquo;s labour market report on Friday may provide the next fundamental catalysts.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "MARKET WRAP 4 July 2018: Markets mixed amid trade concerns, geopolitics, and US holiday",
        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES: </strong>Asian equities were lower overnight on a combination of lingering concerns about global trade wars, and the PBOC draining a net 80bln yuan. European equities are mixed; auto names are in the green, however, on reports that the EU is considering talks with the leading global auto exporters in efforts to avoid a full-blown trade war &ndash; heads of Daimler, BMW and VW are set to meet the US ambassador to Germany on Wednesday in an effort to avoid US tariffs, Handelsblatt reported. European tech names were under pressure after Micron lost a patent lawsuit in China. US equity futures have been open for a shortened holiday session, though trade has been expectedly subdued with US traders out for the Independence Day holiday; ES price action was capped by the 50dma at 2725, and the ~2710 level has held action above it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: </strong>Thin, rangebound trade with little of note standing out. Attention is on trade headlines, with the EU said to be flirting with cutting tariffs on autos; however, with USD 34 billion of tariffs on Chinese products coming into effect on 6 July, China is expected to retaliate, likely resulting in trade concerns rising once again. FOMC minutes on Thursday and June&rsquo;s labour market report on Friday may provide the next fundamental catalysts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: </strong>There was thin trade in crude futures, though Brent (up slightly on geopolitics and continuing supply disruptions) and WTI diverged (technical factors around backwardation). The Iranians have been vocal, with Iran&#39;s revolutionary guards reportedly ready to start a policy of preventing oil exports if Iranian oil sales are banned; Iranian President Rouhani said the nation will remain in the nuclear pact without the US, if its benefits are guaranteed; and Iran&#39;s OPEC governor says Trump&#39;s pressure on international firms to not purchase oil from Iran is &#39;self-harm&#39; as it pushes up oil prices. WTI, meanwhile, was lower despite a bigger-than-expected crude draw reported by the API on Tuesday. One desk suggested that WTI may see selling pressure given the prominent backwardations in the front-months; the desk noted that it was June 2014 when this degree of backwardation was last observed in WTI, and subsequently, the front month selling off, and periods of contango saw the front contract rally. The rationale seems to be that when the front month goes highly bid (which implies a shortage of supply in the underlying commodity) it encourages fresh supplies to come to the market; nevertheless, the desk noted that the term structure of WTI still implies downside risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR: </strong>The CDU/CSU deal on immigration only provided a fleeting bounce for EURUSD, which is in negative territory (albeit, slight). 1.1635 was support in thin trade, though there were a few downside breaches, and we are consolidating between that level and 1.1650 as we close out the day in Europe. Technicians suggest the topside level to watch is 1.1720-30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD: </strong>The PBOC fixing the yuan stronger capped USD upside in Asia trade &ndash; and yuan strength was also aided by firmer Caixin PMIs &ndash; though the buck found strength in late Asia/early European trade, though trading volumes have been thin. The DXY is a touch stronger in generally rangebound action in the European afternoon. Attention is now on tomorrow&rsquo;s FOMC minutes, Friday&rsquo;s payrolls report, and of course, lingering concerns on global trade wars &ndash; tariffs on USD 34bln of goods coming into effect on 6 July, with China expected to retaliate quickly after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP: </strong>Solid PMI data helped Sterling reclaim 1.32 against the buck, though backed-off the weekly high around 1.3225, and cable has been consolidating above the 1.32 handle; the pound briefly breached 0.88 versus the EUR, though is trading above the figure as we close out the session in Europe. Attention will likely fall back on Brexit newsflow towards the back-end of the week, when UK PM May will meet with her Cabinet at Chequers, and decisions will reportedly be taken on the UK&rsquo;s future partnership with the EU, and the details of the highly anticipated &lsquo;white paper&rsquo; also said to be unveiled (expectations are for a very soft version of Brexit, according to reports).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITY FX: </strong>The complex is flat and rangey vs the buck amid quiet AUD: Broad USD strength in the latter part of Asia trading/early European trade resulted in the Aussie paring away gains made after decent retail sales data overnight. The 0.74 handle was given once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK: </strong>The EURSEK sell-off has extended into Wednesday trade, following Tuesday&rsquo;s hawkish Riksbank, helped along by rising PMI data. Given how far the SEK has come in such a short space of time, some desks are looking to fade rallies near 10.30.</p>\r\n",

Microfocus (-1.9%), Infineon (-1.5%) and STMicroelectronics (-2.6%) are seen at the foot of their respective bourses. European auto names are in the green after reports the EU in considering talks with the leading global auto exporters in efforts to avoid a full-blown trade war. In stocks specifics, Altice (-6.1%) is the worst performer in the Stoxx 600 amid reports the company does not intend to sell their French telecom component SFR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - Another broad downturn in the Dollar after reports of further sales in China to prop up the YUAN, although the PBoC will be less aggressive in terms of intervention than it was in 2015, according to sources, and with leverage names said to be net sellers of the Greenback over July 4. However, the index has bounced off overnight lows below 94.500 in holiday-thinned trading conditions that are exacerbating price moves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/JPY - Early outperformers, with the Kiwi holding the bulk of its recovery gains vs the Usd and 0.6750+ status, while the Jpy has bounced off 111.00+ lows again as the headline pair seems to be forming multi-peak resistance alongside the EUR cross at 129.50. Moreover, Eur/Usd remains pivotal around its 30 DMA (1.1666) and faces mega option-related offers on top of psychological sellers at the 1.1700 level where a total of 4 bn expiries run off tomorrow and Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - 3 out of 3 (or 4 if you count the knock-out win vs Colombia of course!) in terms of PMI beats for the UK, and a very impressive services headline has helped Cable retest 1.3200, while Eur/Gbp has retreated through 0.8850 yet again. However, the Pound has not been able better its wtd peak vs the Greenback around 1.3225, yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/CHF - All narrowly mixed vs the Usd, with the Aud unable to sustain momentum above 0.7400 even though retail sales data came in above forecast overnight, as the Nzd cross reverses further from highs just shy of 1.1000 to almost 1.0900. The Loonie remains close to recent highs vs its US counterpart in the 1.3150 area, but off best levels just above 1.3100 in wake of Tuesday&rsquo;s stronger Canadian manufacturing PMI. The Franc is even more rangebound between 0.9905-30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/TRY - Starkly contrasting fortunes for the Krona and Lira, with the former getting another lift from hawkish Riksbank rhetoric and a Swedish services PMI beat to extend gains vs the Eur (sub-10.2500), but the latter weakening further vs the Usd (4.7000+) on political jitters over high inflation/CBRT tightening prospects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar pattern of trade to Tuesday panned out for a while, as Bunds and Gilts both forged fresh intraday highs, at 162.87 and 123.45 respectively (+15 and +4 ticks), but then recoiled ahead of chart and recent session peak resistance, with UK bonds (and Short Sterling contracts) also sold on the back of the stellar services PMI. To recap, the headline index not only exceeded forecasts by a big margin, but in doing so also posted a new ytd best, and as the largest sector in overall growth terms could well prompt more BoE neutrals to join the 3 MPC hawks. Hence, Gilts are just off a new Liffe base (123.17) and the STIR strip is up to 3 ticks adrift (-4 ticks at worst), while Bunds have recovered from a knee-jerk/sympathy retreat to 162.58 amidst choppy trade in Italian BTPs following press reports suggesting more Euro exit studies focusing on bond contracts. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are essentially static and fractionally below par for obvious July 4 reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities trade relatively mixed with WTI (-0.4%) losing the USD 74/bbl handle in recent trade. Brent (Unch) initially edged higher as the global benchmark continues to be buoyed by looming threats of supply disruptions (with Iranian and Venezuelan sanctions as well as Libya&rsquo;s 850K stunt in production) on traders&rsquo; minds. Last night&rsquo;s APIs printed a larger than expected inventory drop of 4.5mln barrels. Some traders mentioned the decline in inventories was largely due to the outage at Syncrude Canada&rsquo;s 360K BPD oil facility. There has been reports that US sour crude sellers have cut offers for Asian buyers as over concerns of a potential fall in demand after China threatened to impose tariffs on US oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, gold rebounds to one-week highs of USD 1261.10/oz, accelerated by the recovery in the Chinese yuan from 11-month lows. Elsewhere London copper climbed almost 1% as the red metal recovered from 9-month lows amid the second largest Chilean copper mine potentially facing a 24-hour stoppage within two weeks due to a strike.</p>\r\n",

To recap, the headline index not only exceeded forecasts by a big margin, but in doing so also posted a new ytd best, and as the largest sector in overall growth terms could well prompt more BoE neutrals to join the 3 MPC hawks. Hence, Gilts are just off a new Liffe base (123.17) and the STIR strip is up to 3 ticks adrift (-4 ticks at worst), while Bunds have recovered from a knee-jerk/sympathy retreat to 162.58 amidst choppy trade in Italian BTPs following press reports suggesting more Euro exit studies focusing on bond contracts. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are essentially static and fractionally below par for obvious July 4 reasons.</p>\r\n",

Moreover, Eur/Usd remains pivotal around its 30 DMA (1.1666) and faces mega option-related offers on top of psychological sellers at the 1.1700 level where a total of 4 bn expiries run off tomorrow and Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 out of 3 (or 4 if you count the knock-out win vs Colombia of course!) in terms of PMI beats for the UK, and a very impressive services headline has helped Cable retest 1.3200, while Eur/Gbp has retreated through 0.8850 yet again.

The Loonie remains close to recent highs vs its US counterpart in the 1.3150 area, but off best levels just above 1.3100 in wake of Tuesday&rsquo;s stronger Canadian manufacturing PMI.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade mostly lower following a subdued lead from the holiday-shortened US session, where all majors finished in the red and tech underperformed as Micron shares tumbled almost 7% after losing a patent suit in China, which in turn weighed on other chipmakers. As such, ASX 200 (-0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are negative with Industrials and Financials the laggards in Australia, while a firmer currency weighs on Japanese exporter names including index heavyweight Fast Retailing which also reported a decline in same-store sales. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) conform to the downbeat tone following another consecutive net liquidity drain and although Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMIs were more encouraging than the recent misses in the factory gauges, the support from the data was only brief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback languishes after the prior day&rsquo;s losses against its major counterparts and with participants away for Independence Day. This saw the DXY stuck near Tuesday&rsquo;s lows while EUR/USD and GBP/USD extended on gains, in which the latter just about reclaimed the 1.3200 handle. Elsewhere, AUD is underpinned by better than expected retail sales data and CNH has also firmed against the greenback, with the currency unfazed despite another weaker reference rate by the PBoC, to extend on yesterday&rsquo;s intervention-spurred rebound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher with mild support seen from the risk averse tone, as well as the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 960bln of JGBs ranging from 1yr-10yr maturities. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
