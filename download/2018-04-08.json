GBP also notably outperformed although the immediate reasoning was unclear with Bank of England Governor Carney avoiding monetary policy in his speech. Historically, April is a strong month for GBP and some analysts were pinning the move higher on seasonal factors. The CAD strengthened after relatively strong jobs data where job creation was higher than expected. However, lower oil prices, trade concerns and NAFTA uncertainty saw USD/CAD rebound to close relatively flat.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian PM Trudeau said he is hopeful to get promising news on NAFTA in the coming time, while Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said they have had good NAFTA conversations so far and that they are a in a new more intensive phase of discussions.

Furthermore, Kudlow also stated that a tariff solution is possible in 3 months and that tariffs are not a bluff. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the US is willing to continue negotiations but that President Trump is prepared to defend US interests. Mnuchin also commented that there is a potential for a trade war and that progress is being made on NAFTA as well as North Korea. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Non-Farm Payrolls (Mar) 103k vs. Exp. 193k (Prev. 313k, Rev. 326k); 2-month net adjustment -50K. (Newswires)<br />US Unemployment Rate (Mar) 4.1% vs. Exp. 4.0% (Prev. 4.1%)<br />US Average Earnings YY (Mar) 2.7% vs. Exp. 2.7% (Prev. 2.6%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity markets declined on Friday after President Trump&rsquo;s desire to increase Chinese tariff levels to USD 100bln. This led to futures dipping heavily in an immediate reaction on trade war concerns, which were paired slightly, but not enough to avoid a negative opening on Friday. This was maintained as the largest impetus for movement in equities throughout the day despite uninspiring employment data that missed expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This miss on employment data, whilst seeing a small sell off in equities, was overawed by continued trade comments hammering stocks, with the Fed&rsquo;s chair Powell saying trade wars are not a concern implying that rate increases will continue along the same path, putting further pressure on equities. This as well as comments from the White House seemingly shifting their focus from stock market prosperity to trade deficit reduction by accepting stock market volatility, saw equities close lower on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sectors you&rsquo;d expect to underperform, underperformed. Materials (-2.4%) and industrials (-2.7%) sank as trade war concerns are expected to dampen global growth while financials (-2.4%) also struggled as rates declined amid the broad risk off tone. In stock specific news, all the companies in the Dow finished lower with just 12 companies in the S&amp;P 500 higher on the day. SPX -2.2% at 2604.27, NDX -2.5% at 6433.21, DJI -2.3% at 23930.76.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasuries closed higher as trade concerns and soft jobs data sent rates lower. Donald Trump&rsquo;s threat to slap further tariffs on Chinese goods lifted treasuries before the CME open with the curve initially bull-steepening. The disappointing jobs data gave further impetus for bond bulls as the 10y yield dropped back below 2.8%. Fed Chairman Powell reiterated that further gradual rate hikes would be necessary, which saw market pricing for a June hike remain around 70%. However, odds of a fourth rate hike are still remarkably low as Powell said it was too early to say how tariffs and trade talk will affect the outlook. T-Note futures (June 2018) settled up 14+ ticks at 121-00+.</p>\r\n",
