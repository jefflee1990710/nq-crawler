Before then, indices were under slight downward pressure; however, a bottom was seen around 2835, which coincided with an article on Business Insider, suggesting that Turkish diplomats are ready to release Pastor Brunson. However, this news was seen hours beforehand in the Middle Eastern Eye, and in between the two releases, a Turkish appeals court rejected the plea to release Pastor Brunson. Nasdaq futures underperformed following poor earnings from Applied Materials (AMAT) which sparked a sell off in semiconductors, with the ETF (SOX) seeing declines just shy of 3%, before paring back most of the losses as trade progressed.&nbsp; Tesla (TSLA) also pressured the Nasdaq following reports the SEC is placing pressure on the automaker&rsquo;s directors to understand how much details CEO Elon Musk shared with them prior to the announcement of his plan to take the co. private.

There was little move after a miss on the University of Michigan sentiment data, and Treasuries edged higher. The complex was positive up until a news report suggesting that the US and Chinese were working on a roadmap to reach a resolution in their trade dispute by November. The headline saw a move into risk, to the detriment of Treasuries. US 10-YEAR T-notes settled half-a-tick tick lower at 120-08.</p>\r\n",
