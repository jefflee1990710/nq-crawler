(Newswires)<br /><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May spokesman said the UK is making sure it has the right preparations in place to make sure the UK will prosper in the event of a no deal, while there were also comments from the EU that they are working constructively to reach a Brexit deal. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Union at Chile&#39;s Escondida copper mine said it was preparing a strike contingency plan, as it awaits the final response from BHP. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is to reimpose Iranian sanctions tonight and is not looking to grant exemptions or waivers but will examine requests on a case-by-case basis. In related news, White House National Security Advisor Bolton said if Iran block the strait of Hormuz it would be their worst mistake although he does believe it is a bluff, while a senior US official stated its policy is to get as many countries as possible to reduce imports of Iranian crude to zero. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian President Rouhani said Iran is open to negotiations as long as the US is sincere, while he added that talks alongside sanctions are meaningless and that the US must prove it is willing to solve problems through talks. Furthermore, Rouhani commented that practical actions are required from the EU to save the JCPOA and also warned the US will regret placing sanctions on Iran. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump stated that fixing the terrible trade deals for the US is a priority and going very well, while he also noted great financial numbers are being announced on almost a daily basis. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo said there are many NAFTA subjects which still remain on the table and that he has sent his proposed Rules of Origin to the US who are studying it. Guajardo also stated he will return to Washington this week and that talks with Canada may take place next week depending upon the progress made this week. In related news, Mexico&rsquo;s NAFTA chief negotiator Smith said Mexico will not accept anything that restricts agricultural trade and will not accept an automatic debt clause. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US stocks finished positive with the Nasdaq leading the upside while the S&amp;P 500 notched a 3rd consecutive gain and moved to just over 20 points from all time highs. However, the gains were modest with volumes light and atypical of the post-NFP lull as well as due to summer. In terms of earnings, Newell Brands&rsquo; (NWL) sales missed Wall St&rsquo;s revenue expectations but EPS came in higher than expected; the co also cut its FY18 forecasts. Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) traded higher after its earnings; revenues were higher than expectations, but EPS fell short. Jacob&rsquo;s Engineering (JEC) almost hit a 10 year high after beats on both ends as well as raising its profit forecast for 2018. Elsewhere, Both T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) benefited from reports which said that regulators suggest the need for more competitors in the 5G complex which may boost the merger chances between the two network providers. Later, sources reported that DOJ officials were in early stage of reviewing T-Mobile (TMUS) deal to buy Sprint (S); regulators are said to think at least three US wireless carriers are needed, sources said. Elsewhere, Praxair (PX) were lower after the FTC said PX and Linde (LIN GY) may have to sell more assets than previously expected to gain antitrust approval. Linde announced it would consider more asset sales in order to get approval. Finally, Amcor confirmed Friday reports they are to acquire Bemis (BMS) for USD 6.8bln in an all-stock transaction, and Penn National Gamin (PENN) traded lower after William Hill (WMH LN) held talks with the co. as it looks to expand its market share in US sports betting. SPX +0.35% at 2851, NDX +0.59% at 7439 , DJI at +0.16% at 25503.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries remained in a tight range on Monday amid thin volumes across the complex, as the dog days of summer set in. Yields were mixed across the curve, but ultimately, close to the unchanged mark. The US Treasury will auction a total of USD 78bln in 3-year (USD 34bln, Tuesday), 10-year (USD 26bln, Wednesday) and 30-year (USD 18bln, Thursday), all to settle on 15 August; analysts at TD Securities note that USD38.2bln matures at the mid-month settlement, implying net supply of USD 33.8bln in new cash. TD also points out that USD 23.1bn matures on the Fed&#39;s balance sheet, and the Fed will allow USD 12.6bn to run-off, reinvesting USD 10.5bn, which will add-on USD 4.6bn to 3s, USD 3.5bn to the 10s, and USD 2.4bn to 30s. It is also worth noting that this series of auctions has a higher issuance amount, per the August refunding, though TD Securities believe that the drift higher in yields is likely to support demand. Looking to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 3s, analysts at Barclays note that the sector saw healthy demand at the beginning of the year, but that has moderated, and the monthly bid-cover ratio fell from 3.1x in January to 2.5x at the July auction, with demand at 3-year the softest of all the tenors. In terms of participation, broker/dealer takedown has been edging up in 2018 at 3-year auctions, rising from 36% in January to 54% in July, which Barclays says is a function of smaller participation by investment funds. Barclays says that the 3-year WI roll is slightly rich when compared with previous auction cycles, given the larger add-ons (USD 4.6bln) and increased size at the upcoming auction. It also suggests that current on-the-run 3s trade slightly rich when compared to older 3s. US 10YR T-notes settled 4 ticks higher at 119-23+.</p>\r\n",

Finally, Amcor confirmed Friday reports they are to acquire Bemis (BMS) for USD 6.8bln in an all-stock transaction, and Penn National Gamin (PENN) traded lower after William Hill (WMH LN) held talks with the co. as it looks to expand its market share in US sports betting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (U8) SETTLED $0.52 HIGHER AT $69.01; BRENT (V8) SETTLES $0.54 HIGHER AT $73.75.</strong> Crude starts the week on the front foot, with traders citing Friday&rsquo;s reports that Saudi Arabia cut oil output in July, and Baker Hughes saw oil drillers cutting rigs for the second time in three weeks. On Monday, traders were also citing the US announcement to renew sanctions against Iran, with the &ldquo;snap-back&rdquo; sanctions set to be reinstated after midnight. Talks alongside sanctions are meaningless, and the US must prove it is willing to solve problems through talks. Traders seemed to dismiss the news that Saudi Arabia has resumed oil shipments through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, after Houthi rebels halted attacks in the Red Sea in an effort to support peace efforts. Elsewhere, Iran is planning to lift oil production to more than 7.5mln BPD by 2024 (currently around 4.54mln), it&rsquo;s oil minister said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE 4 TICKS HIGHER AT 119-23+: </strong>Treasuries remained in a tight range on Monday amid thin volumes across the complex, as the dog days of summer set in. Yields were mixed across the curve, but ultimately, close to the unchanged mark. The US Treasury will auction a total of USD 78bln in 3-year (USD 34bln, Tuesday), 10-year (USD 26bln, Wednesday) and 30-year (USD 18bln, Thursday), all to settle on 15 August; analysts at TD Securities note that USD38.2bln matures at the mid-month settlement, implying net supply of USD 33.8bln in new cash. TD also points out that USD 23.1bn matures on the Fed&#39;s balance sheet, and the Fed will allow USD 12.6bn to run-off, reinvesting USD 10.5bn, which will add-on USD 4.6bn to 3s, USD 3.5bn to the 10s, and USD 2.4bn to 30s. It is also worth noting that this series of auctions has a higher issuance amount, per the August refunding, though TD Securities believe that the drift higher in yields is likely to support demand. Looking to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 3s, analysts at Barclays note that the sector saw healthy demand at the beginning of the year, but that has moderated, and the monthly bid-cover ratio fell from 3.1x in January to 2.5x at the July auction, with demand at 3-year the softest of all the tenors. In terms of participation, broker/dealer takedown has been edging up in 2018 at 3-year auctions, rising from 36% in January to 54% in July, which Barclays says is a function of smaller participation by investment funds. Barclays says that the 3-year WI roll is slightly rich when compared with previous auction cycles, given the larger add-ons (USD 4.6bln) and increased size at the upcoming auction. It also suggests that current on-the-run 3s trade slightly rich when compared to older 3s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The DXY got to within striking distance of its 2018 peak at 95.523 vs 95.652 before running out of steam. Latest CFTC data shows IMM Dollar longs only marginally pared from 18-month peaks and still just over $20bln.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, TRY: </strong>The GBP continues to weaken in wake of last week&rsquo;s BoE policy meeting on a combination of &lsquo;dovish&rsquo; rate guidance and concern about a no deal or hard Brexit. UK Trade Secretary Fox believes the prospects of the UK leaving without an agreement with the EU are now less than even (60-40 to be precise), and Cable has hit new ytd lows of 1.2920 in response, with only minor support around 1.2910 protecting the next big figure on the downside. Meanwhile, EURGBP is grinding above 0.8900 again irrespective of independent declines in the single currency. However, the TRY is suffering even more than the G10 laggard and has extended losses through 5.0000 vs the USD to breach 5.3 to the upside as US sanctions over the detention of Pastor Brunson add to Turkey&rsquo;s economic and fiscal woes. Note, however, the CBRT has attempted to stem the tide via a cut in the foreign currency reserve option to 40% from 45% previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, CAD: </strong>USDCHF is heading back towards parity (and EURCHF has recovered 1.1500+ status) and USDCAD has now rebounded further from last Friday&rsquo;s post-NFP breaching 1.3000 amidst broad Greenback strength after the initial disappointment of sub-forecast headline payrolls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>Both softer ahead of RBA (Tuesday) and RNBZ (Thursday) policy meetings this week that are widely expected to see the respective Central Banks maintain benchmark rates, and signal unchanged policy for even longer. AUDUSD has backed off 0.7400 again to circa 0.7380 and the Kiwi is testing 0.6730 as the cross hovers above 1.0950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, JPY: </strong>The single currency has managed to stave off offers ahead of its 2018 base vs the Dollar and supply into bids said to be protecting that level at 1.1520 with a bounce off the 1.1530 Monday session low to 1.1550. However, this may yet be a temporary stay of execution as USDJPY extends its range to the upside and absorbs some offers at 111.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* YUAN: </strong>More signs of official intervention after &lsquo;direct&rsquo; devaluation and another higher PBoC USDCNY mid-point fix overnight, as &lsquo;sources&rsquo; claim that some currency options may be subject to bigger reserve margins to discourage speculation against the Yuan. Note, these derivatives are currently subject to a 10% margin and the new 20% reserve for FX Forwards came into effect today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP &ndash; RBA. </strong>Policy announcement due at 0530BST/2330CDT. The RBA is set to decide on rates this Tuesday, and expectations remain one-sided for the central bank to keep the Cash Rate Target at the record low 1.50% where it has been for 2 years. This is reflected in ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures which price in 100% expectations for no change in rates and with its associated implied yield curve suggesting August 2019 as the earliest date for a hike. The RBA hasn&#39;t provided any fresh rhetoric to change the outlook for the central bank since the last meeting, where it continued to reiterate that the board judged it was appropriate to maintain policy, while it also repeated the next rate move is likely to be a hike if economy improves as expected, although it saw no strong case for a near-term change. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19789/download\"><strong>Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</strong></a></p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: fresh week, but familiar themes as Gbp and Try underperform",
        "content": "<p>Pound/Lira</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The Gbp continues to weaken in wake of last week&rsquo;s BoE policy meeting on a combination of &lsquo;dovish&rsquo; rate guidance and concern about a no deal or hard Brexit. UK Trade Secretary Fox believes the prospects of the UK leaving without an agreement with the EU are now less than even (60-40 to be precise), and Cable has hit new ytd lows of 1.2920 in response, with only minor support around 1.2910 protecting the next big figure on the downside. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp is grinding above 0.8900 again irrespective of independent declines in the single currency. However, the Try is suffering even more than the G10 laggard and has extended losses through 5.0000 vs the Usd to just over 5.1950 as US sanctions over the detention of Pastor Brunson add to Turkey&rsquo;s economic and fiscal woes. Note, however, the CBRT has attempted to stem the tide via a cut in the foreign currency reserve option to 40% from 45% previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Franc/Loonie&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Chf is heading back towards parity (and Eur/Chf has recovered 1.1500+ status) and Usd/Cad has now rebounded further from last Friday&rsquo;s post-NFP lows towards 1.3050 amidst broad Greenback strength after the initial disappointment of sub-forecast headline payrolls. Indeed, the DXY got to within striking distance of its 2018 peak at 95.523 vs 95.652 before running out of steam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aud/Nzd</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both softer ahead of RBA (Tuesday) and RNBZ (Thursday) policy meetings this week that are widely expected to see the respective Central Banks maintain benchmark rates, and signal unchanged policy for even longer. Aud/Usd has backed off 0.7400 again to circa 0.7375 and the Kiwi is testing bids near 0.6925 as the cross hovers above 1.0950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eur/Jpy&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has managed to stave off offers ahead of its 2018 base vs the Dollar and supply into bids said to be protecting that level at 1.1520 with a bounce off the 1.1530 Monday session low to 1.1550. However, this may yet be a temporary stay of execution as Usd/Jpy extends its range to the upside and absorbs some offers at 111.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yuan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More signs of official intervention after &lsquo;direct&rsquo; devaluation and another higher PBoC Usd/Cny mid-point fix overnight, as &lsquo;sources&rsquo; claim that some currency options may be subject to bigger reserve margins to discourage speculation against the Yuan. Note, these derivatives are currently subject to a 10% margin and the new 20% reserve for FX Forwards came into effect today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Latest CFTC data shows IMM Dollar longs only marginally pared from 18 month peaks and still just over $20 bn. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) was led higher by commodity-related stocks and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) was positive but with upside limited by recent JPY strength. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) were mixed as the mainland failed to hold on to early gains due to trade uncertainty and further PBoC inaction. Finally, 10yr JGBs were quiet overnight but still edged mild gains as yields slightly eased from last week&rsquo;s BoJ-triggered surge, while reports also noted that the BoJ bought a record amount of 5yr-10yr JGBs last week in its efforts to cap gains in yields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China state media commented that China is prepared for a long trade battle with the US, while it also noted that US is escalating trade friction with China and is turning international trade as a zero-sum game.

Fox also placed the chances of leaving the EU without a deal at &quot;60-40&quot; and stated that EU Chief Negotiator Barnier dismissed the UK&#39;s Chequers proposals simply because &quot;we have never done it before&quot;. This also comes alongside commentary in the Sunday Times over the weekend that businesses and investors are scrambling to protect themselves against a plunge in the value of the pound if Britain crashes out of the EU in March. (BBC/Sunday Times) However, there were later reports that UK PM May is said to be confident of reaching a Brexit agreement according to sources who insisted there is only a very small probability of failing to reach an agreement with the EU. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU is reportedly considering softening backstop powers for Northern Ireland to avert a no-deal Brexit, according to a senior EU diplomat. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond has warned senior figures in the City that France could attempt to bind Britain&rsquo;s financial services sector in red tape post-Brexit, leading to a potential loss of access to European markets.

Furthermore, US Secretary of State Pompeo said the White House will make an announcement detailing reinstatement of some Iran sanctions on Monday. Note: The first round of Iran sanctions imposed by the US to come into effect on Tuesday &ndash; the Iranian government will no longer be able to purchase US banknotes and broad sanctions will be imposed on Iranian industries. (Twitter/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venezuela said there was an assassination attempt on President Maduro by far-right opponents after several drones armed with explosives blew up near President Maduro, while reports also noted Maduro was unharmed and that 7 people were being treated for injuries. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equites opened the week modestly lower (Euro Stoxx 50 -0.2%) as trade concerns weighed on indices initially. Most major European indices were in the red, with the DAX leading the losses and breaking through its 100DMA (12,582) to the downside following Linde (-3.5%) announcing that they and Praxair may need to shed more assets to get antitrust approval, casting doubt over the viability of their merger. The losses in the DAX and Euro Stoxx were short-lived, however, seeing choppy trade and paring back early losses into positive territory on no fundamental catalyst in a news-thin day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The materials sector (-1.2%) is underperforming on the back of softer base metals, as the US-Sino trade spat continues to weigh on the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HSBC (-0.4%) reported earnings, where the bank highlighted rising expenses alongside a civil penalty of USD 765mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>William Hill (+0.3%) have reportedly entered into talks with US casino &ldquo;giant&rdquo; Penn National Gaming that would provide the co. with a greater share of the US sports betting market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts returned to Liffe on the back foot, albeit modestly between 122.71-57 vs their previous 122.74 settlement, and in relatively subdued trade at the start of the new week with little on the domestic agenda bar Halifax house prices. The Short Sterling strip was also moderately softer off the open, but only a tick offside at worst after last week&rsquo;s net gains beyond the very front end of the curve following the BoE rate hike and guidance signalling no further tightening this year. Moreover, Governor Carney underlined Brexit contingency and concerns about no deal that could prompt the MPC to change course on policy, and comments from Trade Secretary Fox over the weekend chime with his view that the risk of that scenario is rising. Hence, the 10 year UK has subsequently rebounded to 122.86 and 3 month contracts are flat to 1 tick ahead presently, while Bunds have reclaimed 162.00+ status and a marginal new Eurex high at 162.16 vs. 161.83 at worst and US Treasuries remain largely side-lined with the curve marginally flatter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - More negative news for the Pound as UK Trade Secretary Fox claims that the risk of a no deal Brexit has risen to 60% after EU chief negotiator Barnier rejected the Chequers White Paper, with Cable back down through 1.3000 and hitting marginal new lows around 1.2950, while Eur/Gbp is back above 0.8900 even though the single currency is relatively weak in its own right. Note also, a major US bank has initiated a short Cable trade at 1.2986, looking for 1.2700 and with a 1.3150 stop, while market contacts suggest stops are likely if the aforementioned ytd base is breached from 1.2950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY - The Lira remains under heavy pressure and one of if not the EM underperformer again as Usd/Try soars further above 5.0000 to almost 5.1600 and fresh all-time highs.

Most major European indices are in the red, with the DAX (-0.5%) leading the losses and breaking through its 100DMA (12,582) to the downside following Linde (-3.5%) announcing that they and Praxair may need to shed more assets to get antitrust approval, casting doubt over the viability of their merger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The materials sector (-1.2%) is underperforming on the back of softer base metals, as the US-Sino trade spat continues to weigh on the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HSBC (-0.4%) reported earnings, where the bank highlighted rising expenses alongside a civil penalty of USD 765mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>William Hill (+0.3%) have reportedly entered into talks with US casino &ldquo;giant&rdquo; Penn National Gaming that would provide the co. with a greater share of the US sports betting market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - More negative news for the Pound as UK Trade Secretary Fox claims that the risk of a no deal Brexit has risen to 60% after EU chief negotiator Barnier rejected the Chequers White Paper, with Cable back down through 1.3000 and almost testing previous 2018 lows around 1.2958, while Eur/Gbp is back above 0.8900 even though the single currency is relatively weak in its own right. Note also, a major US bank has initiated a short Cable trade at 1.2986, looking for 1.2700 and with a 1.3150 stop, while market contacts suggest stops are likely if the aforementioned ytd base is breached from 1.2950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY - The Lira remains under heavy pressure and one of if not the EM underperformer again as Usd/Try soars further above 5.0000 to almost 5.1600 and fresh all-time highs. The catalyst, ongoing US-Turkey diplomatic strains due to Pastor Brunson on top of the latter&rsquo;s domestic political situation and investor angst over the economy, perceived Government interference with the CBRT and a whole lot more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF - Back to the G10 and the next biggest losers after Sterling, with the Loonie back under 1.3000 vs its US rival due to Canada&rsquo;s row with Saudi Arabia over an activist being held in the Kingdom. Meanwhile, the Franc is straddling 0.9950 vs the Greenback, but firmer again vs the Eur around 1.1500, which will keep the SNB fully monitoring the situation and ready to maintain a dovish stance on policy (to recap, Jordan said last Friday that the Bank has more room to cut rates if needed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/NZD/AUD/JPY - All holding up relatively well vs a bid Dollar in general (DXY over 95.300 and still poised for a test of 95.652 highs for the year so far), but the Eur only just keeping its head above 1.1550 and layered bids down to 1.1520 ahead of the 2018 low (1.1510), while the Kiwi remains under 0.6750 and is lagging its antipodean counterpart that is holding firm after PBoC Yuan intervention near 0.7400 and circa 1.0975 on the cross ahead of the RBA policy meeting tomorrow (full preview available via our headline feed). Usd/Jpy is very rangebound again between 111.15-35 with bids at 111.00 and offers at 111.50, 111.60 and 111.73, according to market observers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts returned to Liffe on the back foot, albeit modestly between 122.71-57 vs their previous 122.74 settlement, and in relatively subdued trade at the start of the new week with little on the domestic agenda bar Halifax house prices. The Short Sterling strip was also moderately softer off the open, but only a tick offside at worst after last week&rsquo;s net gains beyond the very front end of the curve following the BoE rate hike and guidance signalling no further tightening this year. Moreover, Governor Carney underlined Brexit contingency and concerns about no deal that could prompt the MPC to change course on policy, and comments from Trade Secretary Fox over the weekend chime with his view that the risk of that scenario is rising. Hence, the 10 year UK has subsequently rebounded to 122.86 and 3 month contracts are flat to 1 tick ahead presently, while Bunds have reclaimed 162.00+ status and a marginal new Eurex high at 162.16 vs. 161.83 at worst and US Treasuries remain largely side-lined with the curve marginally flatter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is higher on the day with WTI +0.6% and Brent +0.4% amid a Saudi crude output cut on Friday alongside the US rig count falling for the second time in three weeks, seeing a decline of 4 to 1044.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia&rsquo;s energy minister Novak reported that future output is to be in line with the OPEC+ 1mln BPD boost plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is essentially unmoved and is still languishing around 17-month lows, currently trading at USD 1211.90/oz. London Copper has fallen for the 3rd session in 4 as trade concerns weigh on the construction material. Zinc is also faring poorly and has fallen 2.2%, with Shanghai lead also down 1.4%.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More negative news for the Pound as UK Trade Secretary Fox claims that the risk of a no deal Brexit has risen to 60% after EU chief negotiator Barnier rejected the Chequers White Paper, with Cable back down through 1.3000 and almost testing previous 2018 lows around 1.2958, while Eur/Gbp is back above 0.8900 even though the single currency is relatively weak in its own right. Note also, a major US bank has initiated a short Cable trade at 1.2986, looking for 1.2700 and with a 1.3150 stop, while market contacts suggest stops are likely if the aforementioned ytd base is breached from 1.2950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira remains under heavy pressure and one of if not the EM underperformer again as Usd/Try soars further above 5.0000 to almost 5.1500 and fresh all time highs. The catalyst, ongoing US-Turkey diplomatic strains due to Pastor Brunson on top of the latter&rsquo;s domestic political situation and investor angst over the economy, perceived Government interference with the CBRT and a whole lot more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to the G10 and the next biggest losers after Sterling, with the Loonie back under 1.3000 vs its US rival due to Canada&rsquo;s row with Saudi Arabia over an activist being held in the Kingdom. Meanwhile, the Franc is straddling 0.9950 vs the Greenback, but firmer again vs the Eur around 1.1500, which will keep the SNB fully monitoring the situation and ready to maintain a dovish stance on policy (to recap, Jordan said last Friday that the Bank has more room to cut rates if needed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/NZD/AUD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All holding up relatively well vs a bid Dollar in general (DXY over 95.300 and still poised for a test of 95.652 highs for the year so far), but the Eur only just keeping its head above 1.1550 and layered bids down to 1.1520 ahead of the 2018 low (1.1510), while the Kiwi remains under 0.6750 and is lagging its antipodean counterpart that is holding firm after PBoC Yuan intervention near 0.7400 and circa 1.0975 on the cross ahead of the RBA policy meeting tomorrow (full preview available via our headline feed). Usd/Jpy is very rangebound again between 111.15-35 with bids at 111.00 and offers at 111.50, 111.60 and 111.73, according to market observers.</p>\r\n",

The Short Sterling strip was also moderately softer off the open, but only a tick offside at worst after last week&rsquo;s net gains beyond the very front end of the curve following the BoE rate hike and guidance signalling no further tightening this year. Moreover, Governor Carney underlined Brexit contingency and concerns about no deal that could prompt the MPC to change course on policy, and comments from Trade Secretary Fox over the weekend chime with his view that the risk of that scenario is rising. Hence, the 10 year UK has subsequently nudged up to flat and 3 month contracts are flat to 1 tick ahead presently.</p>\r\n",

However, Bunds were actually marked down off the open to 162.01 vs last Friday&rsquo;s 162.05 close and dipped a bit further below the big figure to 161.95 before finding some underlying bids to trade up at 162.13, but are now back in the red and slipping to fresh lows at 161.84. Core bonds may be acknowledging a partial recovery or some stability in Italian BTPs after last week&rsquo;s rout and underperformance on concerns about the budget meeting in Rome and more speculation about Finance Minister Tria potentially clashing with other Government ministers. Note, the 10 year Italian benchmark is currently &frac34; point or so above parity around 125.77. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began the week mostly positive as bourses followed suit from Friday&rsquo;s gains on Wall St, although upside was limited as the region took its first opportunity to digest Friday&rsquo;s key events including China&rsquo;s tariff retaliation list announcement and the mixed US jobs data. ASX 200 (+0.5%) was led higher by commodity-related stocks and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) was positive but with upside limited by recent JPY strength, while Isuzu and NTT were among the best performers in Japan with the former underpinned by earnings and as NTT plans to combine its units into an IT giant. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) were mixed as the mainland failed to hold on to early gains due to trade uncertainty and further PBoC inaction. Finally, 10yr JGBs were quiet overnight but still edged mild gains as yields slightly eased from last week&rsquo;s BoJ-triggered surge, while reports also noted that the BoJ bought a record amount of 5yr-10yr JGBs last week in its efforts to cap gains in yields.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week mostly positive as bourses follow suit from Friday&rsquo;s gains on Wall St, although upside is limited as the region takes its first opportunity to digest Friday&rsquo;s key events including China&rsquo;s tariff retaliation list announcement and the mixed US jobs data. ASX 200 (+0.6%) is led higher by commodity-related stocks and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) is also positive but with upside limited by recent JPY strength, while Isuzu and NTT are among the best performers with the former underpinned by earnings and NTT planning to combine its units into an IT giant. Hang Seng (+1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch) are mixed with broad strength in tech, energy, pharma and banks although the mainland is choppy on trade uncertainty and further PBoC inaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively flat with the DXY remaining near the prior week&rsquo;s highs above 95.00, while its counterparts languish with EUR/USD below 1.1600 and GBP/USD breaching 1.3000 to the downside amid continued Brexit woes. There were comments over the weekend from UK Trade Secretary Fox that the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit is increasing and placed the chances of leaving the EU without a deal at 60%, although Whitehall sources later contradicted this and stated UK PM May is confident of reaching a Brexit agreement and insisted there is only a very small probability of not reaching a deal. Elsewhere, CAD briefly wobbled on reports that Saudi Arabia froze all trade investment with Canada and halted diplomatic ties in a dispute over the arrest of a women&rsquo;s rights activist in Saudi Arabia, although CAD later pared the losses given its relatively small exposure the middle-east nation and as high-beta currencies found mild support from a bout of CNY strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are quiet overnight but have managed very mild gains as yields slightly ease from last week&rsquo;s BoJ-triggered surge, while reports also noted that the BoJ bought a record amount of 5yr-10yr JGBs last week in its efforts to cap gains in yields.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)<br />- China state media commentary stated that US administration&rsquo;s extreme pressure and blackmail are clear to the world but added that these methods will not be fruitful against China. (Xinhua)<br />- White House spokesperson said on Friday that the US has had a high level of discussions with China on trade over the past few months and noted they are open to having further conversations. However, there were also comments from a senior US administration official that there has been zero engagement between US president Trump &amp; China, apart from one call in the last few days which resolved nothing.
