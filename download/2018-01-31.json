There were, however, more hawkish upgrades in the language of the central banks&rsquo; statement, dropping its reference to inflation remaining beneath 2% in the near-term, and sees price pressures moving higher this year. It also acknowledged market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased over the last few months, though they still remain &ldquo;low&rdquo;. Regarding growth and household spending, the FOMC now characterises both as &ldquo;solid&rdquo;, and sounded upbeat on the economy. In wake of the release, markets price c.90% chance of a March hike, with the probability of three rate rises in 2018 at c.67% vs 60% at the close of trade on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BoJ said that it plans to maintain the current pace of bond purchases in February for all maturities.

The short-end of the curve saw yields rise towards session highs in wake of the FOMC&rsquo;s signal that inflation pressures are seen firming, keeping it on course to continue its hiking trajectory. However, the long end of the curve found buyers, helping major curve spreads to continue flattening. 2s10s was c.1bps lower at settlement, 2s30s were c.4bps narrower, 5s30s c.4bps flatter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US Treasury&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding announcement, the US Treasury raised the sizes of the 2- and 3-year note auctions by $2bln per month. As a result, the size of 2- and 3-year note auctions will increase by $6bln by the end of the quarter. In addition, Treasury will increase the auction size of the next 2-year FRN auction by $2bln in February. Finally, Treasury will increase auction sizes by $1bln to each of the next 5-, 7-, and 10-year notes and the 30-year bond auctions starting in February. In total, these adjustments will result in an additional $42 billion of new issuance for the upcoming quarter.

He also noted that QE will not go on forever but there is a broad agreement at the ECB for patience and prudence, adding that the ECB will not be too hasty. In a separate interview, ECB&#39;s Coeure says we really expect interest rates to remain very low for an extended period of time; ECB is not targeting FX rates and says ECB has not discussed whether to extend asset purchases through September.

        "content": "<p><strong>FOMC: Rates unchanged as expected, firms language on inflation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Janet Yellen&rsquo;s final meeting as Fed chair, the FOMC maintained its fed funds target at 1.25%-1.50%, as expected. There were, however, more hawkish upgrades in the language of the central banks&rsquo; statement, dropping its reference to inflation remaining beneath 2% in the near-term, and sees price pressures moving higher this year. It also acknowledged market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased over the last few months, though they still remain &ldquo;low&rdquo;. Regarding growth and household spending, the FOMC now characterises both as &ldquo;solid&rdquo;, and sounded upbeat on the economy. In wake of the release, markets price c.90% chance of a March hike, with the probability of three rate rises in 2018 at c.67% vs 60% at the close of trade on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPEAKERS: ECB&rsquo;s Coeure notes FX volatility</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Coeure reiterated the ECB&rsquo;s rate guidance, stating that there is currently no reason to believe that the distribution of upcoming inflation risks have moved permanently lower. He also argued that QE will not go on forever, though there is a broad agreement at the ECB for patience and prudence, adding that the ECB will not be too hasty. On the EUR, he noted that the ECB does not target FX rates, however, he acknowledged the recent volatility, and said that if that kind of volatility would lead to an unwarranted tightening of our monetary policy, the ECB would have to reassess and consider its position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX + 0.08% at 2825 , DJI +0.30% at 26154 , NDX +0.28% at 6950</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top sectors: Utilities +1.1%, IT +0.7% &amp; Industrials + 0.4%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom sectors: Healthcare -1.45%, Consumer Staples -0.4%, Consumer Discretionary -0.36%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stocks began the cash session on the front foot, after an earnings beat from Boeing boosted the Dow. EA also gave upbeat guidance, sending its shares higher, and insurers were buoyed after Anthem&rsquo;s firm earnings and guidance which also lifted other health insurers after they were hit by yesterday&rsquo;s news that Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway&rsquo;s moves to lower healthcare costs. Stocks struggled to cling on to gains following the FOMC rate decision, where it saw inflation pressures building, keeping it on track to raise rates again in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: 10-Year T-Note futures settle 2 ticks lower at 121-18+ </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields were mixed on Wednesday. The short-end of the curve saw yields rise towards session highs in wake of the FOMC&rsquo;s signal that inflation pressures are seen firming, keeping it on course to continue its hiking trajectory. However, the long end of the curve found buyers, helping major curve spreads to continue flattening. 2s10s was c.1bps lower at settlement, 2s30s were c.4bps narrower, 5s30s c.4bps flatter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US Treasury&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding announcement, the US Treasury raised the sizes of the 2- and 3-year note auctions by $2bln per month. As a result, the size of 2- and 3-year note auctions will increase by $6bln by the end of the quarter. In addition, Treasury will increase the auction size of the next 2-year FRN auction by $2bln in February. Finally, Treasury will increase auction sizes by $1bln to each of the next 5-, 7-, and 10-year notes and the 30-year bond auctions starting in February. In total, these adjustments will result in an additional $42 billion of new issuance for the upcoming quarter. The increased issuance was a little more aggressive than markets had anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: Dollar Index is flat heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY was lingering around the neutral mark on Wednesday, but continues to consolidate around the 89.20 level; the USD was supported after the FOMC upgraded its language on inflation, keeping the prospect of three hikes in 2018 alive (probability has risen slightly to around 67%), helping to pare back losses. The next major catalyst for the buck will be Friday&rsquo;s payrolls data; the DXY did gradually strengthen after a solid ADP beat, however, attention will be on the AHE data in Friday&rsquo;s NFP report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR eased after ECB&rsquo;s Coeure highlighted FX volatility in an interview; while he said that the central bank does not target FX, he noted that any unwarranted tightening in monetary conditions may compel the ECB to &ldquo;reassess.&rdquo; Meanwhile, EZ inflation saw the core measure strengthen slightly, though the headline measure fell in January. Meanwhile, the 1.24 handle continues to act like a magnet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP firmed vs the EUR and the USD, with traders noting month-end flows as being supportive. Sterling also shrugged-off news that EU officials reportedly have told UK banks that it would not allow a Brexit deal that would allow UK banks to operate in the EU without barriers. Nevertheless, GBP trades at around 1.42 against the USD and .8750 against the EUR; analysts still maintain that the pound is a sell on rallies, though that approach has been costly for traders as of late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dollar was mixed against havens. USDJPY is running into cloud resistance at 109.10, inspired by dovish comments from BOJ officials overnight; however, the Swiss franc and gold have advanced against the buck, with the latter trading near session highs at $1345.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CAD strengthened against the dollar as GDP came in line with expectations. But the Aussie was still under pressure after headline CPI came in below expectations overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 23 cents higher at $64.73 per barrel; Brent futures settle 3 cents higher at $69.05 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude stocks built much more than expected in the week (the first build in 10 weeks), though stocks at Cushing drew down in line with expectations. Products, meanwhile, both drew down. Crude output, meanwhile, rose above 10mln barrels for the first time since 1970, the EIA said, while production levels rose by 0.4%. Markets were, apparently, supported by the product demand, and after knee-jerking lower, crude firmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Reuters survey found that compliance with the OPEC/Non-OPEC deal to curb production was running at 138%, rising slightly vs December. Iraq and Venezuela are seen trimming the most production, however, overall OPEC output is seen rising by 100k BPD led by Nigeria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, UBS initiated a short Brent position at $68.5 per barrel, it was reported, targeting $61.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks (w/e 26th Jan) 6.776M vs. Exp. 0.126M (Prev. -1.071M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Crude production rose 0.42% to 9.919mln bpd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Dist.

Nzd/Usd reclaimed 0.7400+ status as the Kiwi benefited from relative Aud underperformance (cross below 1.1000 again) on a CPI miss and RBA policy implications, the Aud/Usd did rebound from sub-0.8050 levels to 0.8100+, again highlighting the Greenback&rsquo;s plight.

        "subject": "The big Canadian banks weigh in on today's GDP release",
        "content": "<p><strong>BMO: </strong>November GDP came in at a solid +0.4%, matching the consensus call and the best reading since May. Growth was broad-based with 17 of 20 sectors seeing gains in the month. Goods sectors led the way higher, with manufacturing activity surging 1.8% as autos rebounded following production shutdowns that weighed on the prior two months. A chemical plant restarting after a few months of maintenance also contributed to the strength in manufacturing. Other sectors seeing good gains include utilities (+0.7%) amid more normal weather, retail (+0.6%), wholesale (+0.5%), and real estate (+0.4%) as home sales picked up ahead of the mortgage rule changes. Mining, oil &amp; gas also rose 0.5%, as oil sands activity picked up after a maintenance shutdown hit October, though softness in mining and support services provided some negative offset. The firm headline print is a welcome bounce back from October&rsquo;s flat reading, but will make it tough to hit the Bank of Canada&rsquo;s forecast for 2.5% GDP growth for all of Q4. Even so, GDP is still up a very solid 3.5% y/y, with every sector except agriculture and management above year-ago levels. After a sluggish start to Q4, the Canadian economy rebounded in November as some one-time factors reversed. While hitting the BoC&rsquo;s Q4 GDP forecast is going to be challenging, this report won&rsquo;t change much from a policy perspective for the Bank, which remains in cautious tightening mode</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CIBC:&nbsp;</strong>This winter started with some warmer-than-usual temperatures, and Canadian output in November had some heat in it as well. The 0.4% gain was the strongest reading on monthly GDP in six months, and catches up to more or less where we thought we would be, before a string of recent disappointments on growth indicators. Still, today&rsquo;s results only keep us in the 2% or so range for Q4, slightly under the BoC&rsquo;s recently released, and unchanged, 2.5% forecast. That suggests a pause through the winter and spring is still the most likely outcome for rates. The star of the show in today&rsquo;s release was the factory sector, which contributed roughly half of the economy&rsquo;s overall increase. A strong month was signalled early on, with the trade report highlighting a pop in two-way trade. Most of the strength in manufacturing was tied to autos, which after four straight months of declines totalling over 20%, closed most of the gap by expanding at a 14.3% clip. Still the rest of manufacturing grew by just over 1%, and ex-transportation factory production is tracking a 5% annual pace. Oil &amp; gas was also on the positive side of the ledger (+1.6%), with stronger output reported in non-conventional production as facilities return to more normal production after maintenance turnarounds which started in the fall. We&rsquo;re looking for more growth in the sector in the year ahead, as firmer pricing for light crude incentivizes conventional production, while a major oil sands facility gears up for what is likely to be 200k bbl/day of output sometime in 2018. Retail/wholesale trade saw modest increases as we had expected, with the continued rotation toward an earlier shopping season and the release of a popular new phone helping to lift core consumer spending. The monthly track to consumption isn&rsquo;t going to fall off a cliff, but we don&rsquo;t think that the 5% pace in real retailing, or the 10% growth in wholesale volumes, is going to hold up in the year ahead. Eventually interest hikes will start biting, and as we near full employment, the pace to job gains should slow. November was as good as we thought it would be, but it&rsquo;s not enough to change our outlook for 2% growth in Q4, or what we think will be a wait-and-see approach from the Bank of Canada through the spring. Today&rsquo;s report showed a bounce back in manufacturing but to sustain further meaningful growth, we&rsquo;re going to need to see investment in export capacity&mdash; something we&rsquo;re not convinced is coming in the near-term given the increased attractiveness of the US in light of recent tax cuts, and serious concerns on the trade front regarding NAFTA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBC:&nbsp;</strong>GDP rose 0.4% in November after a surprisingly weak flat reading in October. Nonconventional oil extraction bounced back 3.7% to reverse a 3.4% decline in October that was reportedly the result of transitory maintenance shutdowns. A 1.8% surge in manufacturing output also reflected a retracement of earlier weakness as shutdowns of some motor vehicle and chemical production in earlier months ended. Increases outside of those two components were generally more modest but widespread. Statistics Canada noted 17 of 20 industries posted increases in November. Yes, uncertainties remain about the outcome of NAFTA renegotiations and that could have significant implications in particular for the manufacturing sector that accounted for a big chunk of November&rsquo;s GDP growth. Looking through monthly volatility, though, the GDP numbers add to the evidence that the Canadian economy as a whole continues to grow at an &lsquo;above-potential&rsquo; pace even as it increasingly looks to be operating at or beyond its long-run capacity. With inflation still remaining well-behaved, the Bank of Canada can continue be cautious about raising interest rates, particularly in light of elevated household debt levels. Absent a downside surprise on near-term growth or an unexpectedly &rsquo;bad&rsquo; outcome from NAFTA negotiations, though, we expect the central bank will continue to ease off on the accelerator in terms of monetary policy and look for gradual interest rate hikes to continue this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scotiabank:&nbsp;</strong>Strong growth in November combined with last week&rsquo;s further increase in core CPI (here) present evidence to somewhat hawkishly inform the BoC&rsquo;s data dependent posture in support of our forecast for another rate hike by Spring. The economy grew at its strongest monthly pace since May and this materially raised tracking of Q4 growth. Manufacturing played a major role in driving growth (see weighted contributions below). Indeed this is a global phenomenon backed by rising trend readings across purchasing managers indices drawn from the manufacturing sectors of numerous countries and regions. Canada is no exception to this which emphasizes how zero-sum trade policies have no role to play in today&rsquo;s global economy. Integrated global manufacturing operations of multinationals can indeed be a case of how a rising tide lifts all boats. The data did not add to pre-release momentum in CAD or the 2 year GoC yield but on net it reinforced a stronger currency and mild cheapening at the front end of the rates curve this morning. 17 of 20 sectors advanced and the broad details are at least as good as the headline. The sector details slightly improved the dispersion of growth readings but not by much because the weighted contributions were skewed. In weighted contribution terms, the goods sector accounted for about 58% of GDP growth in November and services accounted for the remainder. Within goods, manufacturing accounted for the lion&rsquo;s share and represented 45% of overall GDP growth during the month. Within manufacturing, durable goods were up 2.5% m/m and led by autos as we saw in the manufacturing report for the month, while nondurables advanced by 1.1%. Manufacturing GDP has been trending higher since late 2016 and so some of the strength in November is transitory following prior shutdowns in the auto sector while some of it fits a trend. Across other goods sectors, the mining/quarrying and oil/gas extraction sector accounted for 9% of GDP growth. Utilities accounted for 4% of GDP growth, construction accounted for less than 1% of GDP growth and agriculture/forestry/fishing was a mild net drag on GDP growth. Within services, the biggest contributor to weighted GDP growth was real estate and rental/leasing that explained 13% of GDP growth during the month. Retail trade (about 8% of GDP growth), wholesale trade (about 7%), finance/insurance/real estate (about 5%) and the professionals category (4%) were the next biggest contributors to GDP growth. Growth tracking incorporating back months is now 1.7% q/q SAAR. That&rsquo;s up about a full percentage point compared to prior to the November figures. This is progress toward the BoC&#39;s 2 &frac12;% Q4 GDP growth forecast in the January MPR but we&#39;ll still need a rather strong December reading or difference in GDP tracking sources to get there. How strong? About 0.6% m/m, or tied with last May. I think that&#39;s unlikely, not least of which because the autos contribution is unlikely to repeat in December in my opinion since it largely reflected a transitory gain following prior shutdowns that were somewhat seasonally unusual. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the BoC&rsquo;s growth forecast is impossible to achieve but the risk is clearly skewed lower. Monthly GDP incomeside figures often don&#39;t track expenditure-based GDP figures very well and differences of +/- &frac12;% between the two are not uncommon and are sometimes bigger. Major reasons for this include the fact that the income side of the GDP accounts doesn&#39;t consider why production changed or how, like inventory investment changes or swings in import content.</p>\r\n",

However, UK Gilts did extend their underperformance/divergence vs Bunds when declining through parity earlier to a 122.26 low (-12 ticks vs +17 ticks at best) amidst positive headlines about deals with China. Similar overall muted response in the currency markets, with only Usd/Jpy really maintaining a bid close to 109.00 and session highs just above. Indeed, Usd/Cad dipped through 1.2256 tech support at one stage on the firmer elements of the Canadian data, but has rebounded on no clear breach.

        "subject": "PRIMER: CANADIAN GDP (NOV), DUE FOR RELEASE AT 13:30 GMT, 08:30 EDT",
        "content": "<p>There are no expectations for the release, and October&rsquo;s print was flat in M/M terms. The BoC continues to focus on the output gap&nbsp;as opposed to inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the bank desks are saying:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BMO: </strong>The Canadian economy likely expanded 0.4% in November, bouncing back from the prior month&rsquo;s flat reading. Manufacturing activity was up sharply, and there&rsquo;s some additional upside risk from a chemicals plant that came back online in the month. Wholesale and retail trade were both modestly firmer, and should contribute to growth. Oil sands production is expected to rebound after maintenance weighed on October&rsquo;s activity, while higher oil prices could boost conventional production and support services. Home sales jumped in November as well, which should lift real estate activity, but could boost other services, like finance and legal. Hours worked were down sharply in the month, which is a potential negative. However, if the Bank of Canada&rsquo;s forecast for 2.5% Q4 growth is accurate, November GDP needs to be at least 0.5% and more likely 0.6%, so that&rsquo;s a potential rational for upside risk. Our call would put Q4 growth closer to 2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CIBC: </strong>It&rsquo;s going to be a great month for Canadian output, with November readings already in hand pointing to an advance on the order of 0.4%. That comes off the heels of a flat performance for the economy heading into the release, symbolizing what&rsquo;s going to partly be a catch-up month for GDP. Some of the strength will be tied to factories, which benefited from a surge in two-way trade, and saw volumes expand by an extremely healthy 2.5%. The pulling forward of the holiday shopping season also meant that the underlying consumption trend was healthy, and solid volume growth in retail/wholesale trade will lend a helping hand as well. The Bank hiked earlier this month and released a new set of forecasts for the economy. It didn&rsquo;t, however, lower its Q4 estimate, which still stands at 2.5%. Even with a strong November, growth is likely to undershoot that modestly at 2%, removing some of the perceived impetus for another hike in the near term, which markets continue to place decent odds on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBC: </strong>We are forecasting 0.4% m/m growth in November GDP after a flat reading in October. Part of the reasoning behind the flat reading was unscheduled maintenance shutdowns at oil sands facilities, leading to the mining, oil and gas component detracting 0.1pp from headline growth. A reversal is expected for the category in November and the uncertain magnitude could be an upside risk to our forecast. Activity reports have been firmer in November, with manufacturing ex-autos volumes up 0.8% m/m, wholesale volumes up 0.5% m/m, and retail volumes up 0.3% m/m. The forecasted 0.4% gain is consistent with Q4 growth ~2% annualized, about 0.5pp below the BoC&rsquo;s re-affirmed estimate for the quarter in the January 17th MPR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scotiabank: </strong>The economy probably put in a healthy pace of growth in November such that tracking for Q4 GDP growth likely improved to about the 2% annualized pace. That compares to the BoC&rsquo;s estimated growth rate of 2.5% for Q4 as provided in the January edition of the Monetary Policy Report. I figure the economy grew by about 0.5% m/m in November based upon a regression model of GDP versus several high-frequency readings. Manufacturing shipment volumes soared by 2.5% m/m and housing starts advanced by 13% m/m in seasonally adjusted terms. Retail sales volumes were up 0.3% m/m. Hours worked fell 0.7% m/m which requires a solid productivity gain in order to get decent GDP growth but hours worked then advanced by about double that pace the following month. Wholesale trade also put in a solid performance. Somewhat large declines in output in the agricultural, mining and utility sectors may reverse and add to headline gains although more of the upside through utilities is likely to come in ensuing months. After Canada&rsquo;s recent growth run a glass-half -empty bias would say the back half of 2017 was disappointing but a glass-half-full bias would say it was a minor miracle to get still pretty decent growth after the rapid growth experienced over the prior four quarters.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>31<sup>st</sup> January 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>European equities trade broadly higher albeit modestly so, as earnings dictate the state of play for Europe. </strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>The DXY remains vulnerable under the 89.000 handle as January draws to a close and month end portfolio hedging indices continue to flag sell signals</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Looking ahead, highlights include US ADP, Quarterly Refunding Announcement and FOMC rate decision.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mixed tone was gradually seen in Asia, as equity markets somewhat recovered from the initial spill-over selling from Wall St. where the S&amp;P 500 posted its worst 2-day performance since May last year. The overnight rebound in sentiment was alongside President Trump&rsquo;s first State of the Union Address, which Trump was viewed to have delivered a composed and conventional speech, while he also refrained from any comments that would have unnerved markets. As such, ASX 200 (+0.2%) pared early losses and finished positive, although the commodity-related sectors continued their underperformance, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) swung between gains and losses with Japanese stock news dominated by earnings. Furthermore, the region also mulled over mixed Chinese Official PMI data in which Non-Manufacturing PMI topped estimates but Manufacturing PMI disappointed, which in turn clouded over the Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) and Hang Seng (+0.1%), despite a brief turnaround which momentarily saw most stocks lifted with the tide. Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher, with prices supported from today&rsquo;s Rinban operation in which the BoJ were in the market for JPY 850bln of JGBs across the curve and upped its purchases of 3yr-5yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Manufacturing PMI (Jan) 51.3 vs. Exp. 51.6 (Prev. 51.6). (Newswires)<br />- Non-Manufacturing PMI (Jan) 55.3 vs. Exp. 54.9 (Prev. 55.0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Summary of Opinions from January meeting said must continue with powerful easing policy as inflation remains weak. There summary noted the opinion that BoJ must look at effects and costs of BoJ&#39;s ETF and risky asset purchases given stock prices and corporate profits improving sharply, while there also may be a chance for the BoJ to consider adjusting level of yield targets if economy and prices continue improving. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ says it plans to keep the current pace of bond purchases in Feb for all maturities. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian CPI (Q4) Q/Q 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.7% (Prev. 0.6%). (Newswires)<br />- CPI (Q4) Y/Y 1.9% vs. Exp. 2.0% (Prev. 1.8%)<br />- CPI Trimmed Mean (Q4) Q/Q 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.4%)<br />- CPI Trimmed Mean (Q4) Y/Y 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.9% (Prev. 1.8%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Coeure states that QE will not go on forever but there is a broad agreement at the ECB for patience and prudence, adding that the ECB will not be too hasty. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swedish Central Bank Governor Ingves says they are now on target with inflation. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May said that there was a long-term job to do in Brexit and that she will publish Brexit impact studies during February speech in Munich. Furthermore, PM May said the UK is seeking a free trade deal with China and wants more access in the interim before trade deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump delivered his first State of the Union Address in which he stated the US is finally seeing rising wages and that unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. Trump also called on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least USD 1.5tln for new infrastructure investment and said that they will work to fix bad trade deals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU officials are to reject the City of London&#39;s intention to strike a post-Brexit free trade deal for financial services, according to financial executives. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade broadly higher (Eurostoxx 50 +0.2%) albeit modestly so, as earnings dictate the state of play for Europe. In terms of sector specifics, utility names have seen some support with SSE (+1.6%) sitting near the top of the FTSE after lifting their guidance, while IT names are seen softer with Ericsson (-8%) lower following earnings and Infineon (-0.7%) at the bottom of the DAX after cutting guidance alongside earnings. Elsewhere, stock specifics have been dominated by earnings with reports from the likes of Electrolux (+6.3%), Volvo (+3.4%), H&amp;M (-4.8%), Lonza (-3.6%), Julius Baer (-3.2%) and focus once again on Capita (-35%) with shares slammed following their latest profit warning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY remains vulnerable under the 89.000 handle as January draws to a close and month end portfolio hedging indices continue to flag sell signals, and strong for several USD/G10 pairs. The Dollar did derive some support from a buoyant from US President Trump&rsquo;s buoyant SOTU address&nbsp; and clarification by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that a strong Greenback is in the country&rsquo;s best interest (long term at least). However, EUR/USD looks solid above 1.2400 and around the 1.2433 level (200 MMA), with decent option expiries between 1.2400-40 (1.5 bn) and 1.2450-55 (1.7 bn) perhaps adding to the aforementioned rebalancing bid tone. Cable briefly reclaimed 1.4200+ status before easing back again amid EUR/GBP month-end demand and news that EU officials are to reject the City of London&#39;s intention to strike a post-Brexit free trade deal for financial services. USD/JPY is back below 109.00, but still within a broad 108.50-109.50 range. USD/CAD has dipped under 1.2300 and eyeing strong chart support just ahead of the 1.2250 level, while NZD/USD has rebounded firmly towards 0.7400 with extra Kiwi impetus gleaned from AUD cross flows as the latter declined on sub-forecast inflation data, China&rsquo;s manufacturing PMI miss and a drop in metals prices (AUD/USD capped around 0.8100 and AUD/NZD circa 1.0950). Back to the US Dollar&rsquo;s ongoing weakness, USD/CNY has declined again to under 6.3000 and USD/ZAR is sub-11.8300 with the Rand boosted by reports that the ANC will begin discussions with outgoing President Zuma about an official departure date. Elsewhere, EUR/SEK hit a circa 9.7460 low after comments from Riksbank Governor Ingves claiming that the Swedish CB has now achieved its inflation target.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Inflation, Flash YY (Jan) 1.3% vs. Exp. 1.3% (Prev. 1.4%)<br />Infl Ex Food &amp; Enr Flash (Jan) 1.2% vs. Exp. 1.0% (Prev. 1.1%)<br />Unemployment Rate (Dec) 8.7% vs. Exp. 8.7% (Prev. 8.7%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and even fundamentally challenged Gilts have extended recovery gains as bonds benefit from the final position and portfolio tweaking for month end, while specs and shorter term traders appear to be taking stock ahead of the big risk events to come (US refunding, FOMC and NFP). The 10 year Eurex benchmark has been as high as 159.26 (+35 ticks on the day) and its UK equivalent to 122.55 (+17 ticks) amidst some blocked flows at 122.51 (3k lots in 1500 clips). USTs also firmer and re-flattening after Tuesday&rsquo;s long end underperformance when the 30 year yield got to within a few basis points of the 3% mark. Back to Bunds, a bit more loss of momentum on firmer core Eurozone inflation just as ECB&rsquo;s Coeure warns about the market not factoring in the prospect of higher prices, and perhaps with Germany&rsquo;s new Bobl offering also impacting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures trade lower in the wake of last night&rsquo;s larger than expected build in headline API crude oil inventories with energy newsflow otherwise relatively light ahead of today&rsquo;s official EIA release. In metals markets,&nbsp; gold prices are seen higher amid a lacklustre greenback while copper was marginally supported overnight by the improvement in risk tone. Finally, Chinese steel futures were seen lower overnight as adverse weather conditions capped demand in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (26 Jan, w/e) 3.229M vs. Exp. 0.100M (Prev. 4.755M).

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: GBP softer amid fears for the UK’s financial services sector post-Brexit. Earnings dominate European equities",
        "content": "<p>European equities trade broadly higher (Eurostoxx 50 +0.2%) albeit modestly so, as earnings dictate the state of play for Europe. In terms of sector specifics, utility names have seen some support with SSE (+1.6%) sitting near the top of the FTSE after lifting their guidance, while IT names are seen softer with Ericsson (-8%) lower following earnings and Infineon (-0.7%) at the bottom of the DAX after cutting guidance alongside earnings. Elsewhere, stock specifics have been dominated by earnings with reports from the likes of Electrolux (+6.3%), Volvo (+3.4%), H&amp;M (-4.8%), Lonza (-3.6%), Julius Baer (-3.2%) and focus once again on Capita (-35%) with shares slammed following their latest profit warning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY remains vulnerable under the 89.000 handle as January draws to a close and month end portfolio hedging indices continue to flag sell signals, and strong for several USD/G10 pairs. The Dollar did derive some support from a buoyant from US President Trump&rsquo;s buoyant SOTU address&nbsp; and clarification by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that a strong Greenback is in the country&rsquo;s best interest (long term at least). However, EUR/USD looks solid above 1.2400 and around the 1.2433 level (200 MMA), with decent option expiries between 1.2400-40 (1.5 bn) and 1.2450-55 (1.7 bn) perhaps adding to the aforementioned rebalancing bid tone. Cable briefly reclaimed 1.4200+ status before easing back again amid EUR/GBP month-end demand and news that EU officials are to reject the City of London&#39;s intention to strike a post-Brexit free trade deal for financial services. USD/JPY is back below 109.00, but still within a broad 108.50-109.50 range. USD/CAD has dipped under 1.2300 and eyeing strong chart support just ahead of the 1.2250 level, while NZD/USD has rebounded firmly towards 0.7400 with extra Kiwi impetus gleaned from AUD cross flows as the latter declined on sub-forecast inflation data, China&rsquo;s manufacturing PMI miss and a drop in metals prices (AUD/USD capped around 0.8100 and AUD/NZD circa 1.0950). Back to the US Dollar&rsquo;s ongoing weakness, USD/CNY has declined again to under 6.3000 and USD/ZAR is sub-11.8300 with the Rand boosted by reports that the ANC will begin discussions with outgoing President Zuma about an official departure date. Elsewhere, EUR/SEK hit a circa 9.7460 low after comments from Riksbank Governor Ingves claiming that the Swedish CB has now achieved its inflation target. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and even fundamentally challenged Gilts have extended recovery gains as bonds benefit from the final position and portfolio tweaking for month end, while specs and shorter term traders appear to be taking stock ahead of the big risk events to come (US refunding, FOMC and NFP). The 10 year Eurex benchmark has been as high as 159.26 (+35 ticks on the day) and its UK equivalent to 122.55 (+17 ticks) amidst some blocked flows at 122.51 (3k lots in 1500 clips). USTs also firmer and re-flattening after Tuesday&rsquo;s long end underperformance when the 30 year yield got to within a few basis points of the 3% mark. Back to Bunds, a bit more loss of momentum on firmer core Eurozone inflation just as ECB&rsquo;s Coeure warns about the market not factoring in the prospect of higher prices, and perhaps with Germany&rsquo;s new Bobl offering also impacting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures trade lower in the wake of last night&rsquo;s larger than expected build in headline API crude oil inventories with energy newsflow otherwise relatively light ahead of today&rsquo;s official EIA release. In metals markets, &nbsp;gold prices are seen higher amid a lacklustre greenback while copper was marginally supported overnight by the improvement in risk tone. Finally, Chinese steel futures were seen lower overnight as adverse weather conditions capped demand in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The DXY remains vulnerable under the 89.000 handle as January draws to a close and month end portfolio hedging signals continue to flag sell signals, and strong for several Usd/G10 pairs. The Dollar did derive some support from a buoyant from US President Trump&rsquo;s buoyant SOTU address &nbsp;and clarification by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that a strong Greenback is in the country&rsquo;s best interest (long term at least). However, Eur/Usd looks solid above 1.2400 and around the 1.2433 level (200 MMA), with decent option expiries between 1.2400-40 (1.5 bn) and 1.2450-55 (1.7 bn) perhaps adding to the aforementioned rebalancing bid tone. Cable has also recovered more ground after yesterday&rsquo;s sub-1.4000 visit, and briefly reclaimed 1.4200+ status before easing back again. Usd/Jpy is back below 109.00, but still within a broad 108.50-109.50 range. Usd/Cad has dipped under 1.2300 and eyeing strong chart support just ahead of the 1.2250 level, while Nzd/Usd has rebounded firmly towards 0.7400 with extra Kiwi impetus gleaned from Aud cross flows as the latter declined on sub-forecast inflation data, China&rsquo;s manufacturing PMI miss and a drop in metals prices (Aud/Usd capped around 0.8100 and Aud/Nzd circa 1.0950). Back to the US Dollar&rsquo;s ongoing weakness, Usd/Cny has declined again to under 6.3000 and Usd/Zar is sub-11.8300 with the Rand boosted by reports that the ANC will begin discussions with outgoing President Zuma about an official departure date. Elsewhere, Eur/Sek hit a circa 9.7460 low after comments from Riksbank Governor Ingves claiming that the Swedish CB has now achieved its inflation target.</p>\r\n",

Moreover, survey data overnight was better than expected (Gfk consumer confidence not as downbeat as expected and Lloyds&rsquo; business barometer, which has correlated well with PMI, improved markedly) and this may all weigh on Gilts despite positive external leads. Hence, the 10 year debt future is prone to underperform its core fixed counterparts and remain capped on any advance from the previous 122.38 settlement when it returns to Liffe shortly.</p>\r\n",

The overnight rebound in sentiment was alongside President Trump&rsquo;s first State of the Union Address, which Trump was viewed to have delivered a composed and conventional speech, while he also refrained from any comments that would have unnerved markets. As such, ASX 200 (+0.2%) pared early losses and finished positive, although the commodity-related sectors continued their underperformance, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) swung between gains and losses with Japanese stock news dominated by earnings. Furthermore, the region also mulled over mixed Chinese Official PMI data in which Non-Manufacturing PMI topped estimates but Manufacturing PMI disappointed, which in turn clouded over the Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) and Hang Seng (+0.1%), despite a brief turnaround which momentarily saw most stocks lifted with the tide. Finally, 10yr JGBs&nbsp; are higher, with prices supported from today&rsquo;s Rinban operation in which the BoJ were in the market for JPY 850bln of JGBs across the curve and upped its purchases of 3yr-5yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Manufacturing PMI (Jan) 51.3 vs. Exp. 51.6 (Prev. 51.6).

There summary noted the opinion that BoJ&nbsp;must look at effects and costs of BoJ&#39;s ETF and risky asset purchases given stock prices and corporate profits improving sharply, while there also may be a chance for the BoJ to consider adjusting level of yield targets if economy and prices continue improving.

Elsewhere, AUD underperformed on data releases including softer than expected CPI numbers and disappointing Chinese Official Manufacturing PMI, which dragged AUD/NZD to below the 1.1000 handle. Furthermore, JPY briefly saw safe-haven inflows upon the release of the aforementioned Chinese data, although this was pared shortly after as JGBs were underpinned and Japanese yields fell following the BoJ&rsquo;s bond purchase announcement.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian CPI (Q4) Q/Q 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.7% (Prev. 0.6%).

All major curves were wider, with 2s30s up by circa 5bps, 5s30s circa 2bps higher, and 2s10s around 3bps steeper. Some traders expect the FOMC to hawkishly tweak its language at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday (preview below), to prepare markets for a rate hike. CME Fedwatch indicates there is only a 5% probability of a hike at this week&rsquo;s meeting, and a 60% chance of three hikes in 2018 (as the Fed has forecast). US T-Note futures settle 5+ ticks lower at 121.20+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump delivered his first State of the Union Address in which he stated the US is finally seeing rising wages and that unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. Trump also called on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least USD 1.5tln for new infrastructure investment and said that they will work to fix bad trade deals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former White House Strategist Bannon will not be appearing before The House Intelligence Committee tomorrow, according to reports.

        "content": "<p>A mixed tone was gradually seen in Asia, as equity markets somewhat recovered from the initial spill-over selling from Wall St. where the S&amp;P 500 posted its worst 2-day performance since May last year. The overnight rebound in sentiment was alongside President Trump&rsquo;s first State of the Union Address, which Trump was viewed to have delivered a composed and conventional speech, while he also refrained from any comments that would have unnerved markets. As such, ASX 200 (+0.2%) pared early losses and finished positive, although the commodity-related sectors continued their underperformance, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) swung between gains and losses with Japanese stock news dominated by earnings. Furthermore, the region also mulled over mixed Chinese Official PMI data in which Non-Manufacturing PMI topped estimates but Non-Manufacturing PMI disappointed, which in turn clouded over the Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) and Hang Seng (Unch.), despite a brief turnaround which momentarily saw most stocks lifted with the tide. Finally, 10yr JGBs&nbsp; are higher, with prices supported from today&rsquo;s Rinban operation in which the BoJ were in the market for JPY 850bln of JGBs across the curve and upped its purchases of 3yr-5yr maturities.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People &mdash; and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams.&nbsp; That night, our new Administration had already taken swift action.&nbsp; A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission &mdash; to make America great again for all Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success.&nbsp; We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined.&nbsp; We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship.&nbsp; We endured floods and fires and storms.&nbsp; But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America&rsquo;s soul, and the steel in America&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We saw the volunteers of the &ldquo;Cajun Navy,&rdquo; racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania.&nbsp; Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey.&nbsp; Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives.&nbsp; Thank you, Ashlee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg.&nbsp; He is here with us too.&nbsp; David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and everywhere else &mdash; we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally.&nbsp; With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House &mdash; a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later:&nbsp; the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people.&nbsp; But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy.&nbsp; Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew:&nbsp; that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans.&nbsp; If there is a mountain, we climb it.&nbsp; If there is a frontier, we cross it.&nbsp; If there is a challenge, we tame it.&nbsp; If there is an opportunity, we seize it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone.&nbsp; After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low.&nbsp; African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small business confidence is at an all-time high.&nbsp; The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value.&nbsp; That is great news for Americans&rsquo; 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone.&nbsp; Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free.&nbsp; We also doubled the child tax credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 &mdash; slashing their tax bill in half.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system &mdash; and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year &mdash; forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans.&nbsp; We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare &mdash; the individual mandate is now gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world.&nbsp; These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing &mdash; a small business in Ohio.&nbsp; They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history.&nbsp; Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of Staub&rsquo;s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight.&nbsp; Corey is an all-American worker.&nbsp; He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder.&nbsp; Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax‑cut raise into his new home and his two daughters&rsquo; education.&nbsp; Please join me in congratulating Corey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses &mdash; many of them thousands of dollars per worker.&nbsp; Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is our new American moment.&nbsp; There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So to every citizen watching at home tonight &mdash; no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time.&nbsp; If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be.&nbsp; All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, we are rediscovering the American way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life.&nbsp; Our motto is &ldquo;in God we trust.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans&rsquo; graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day.&nbsp; He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes.&nbsp; Preston:&nbsp; a job well done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans.&nbsp; Preston&rsquo;s reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americans love their country.&nbsp; And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions.&nbsp; Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act.&nbsp; Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve &mdash; and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All Americans deserve accountability and respect &mdash; and that is what we are giving them.&nbsp; So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers &mdash; and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have ended the war on American Energy &mdash; and we have ended the war on clean coal.&nbsp; We are now an exporter of energy to the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America&rsquo;s autoworkers &mdash; so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States &mdash; something we have not seen for decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama.&nbsp; Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country.&nbsp; This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing &mdash; for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us.&nbsp; But now they are coming back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exciting progress is happening every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure &mdash; I want to give them a chance right here at home.&nbsp; It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the &ldquo;right to try.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.&nbsp; In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States.&nbsp; That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities.&nbsp; Prices will come down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation&rsquo;s wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The era of economic surrender is over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>America is a nation of builders.&nbsp; We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year &mdash; is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment &mdash; to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process &mdash; getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, we can reclaim our building heritage.&nbsp; We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land.&nbsp; And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; We want every child to be safe in their home at night.&nbsp; And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training.&nbsp; Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.&nbsp; And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens.&nbsp; That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities.&nbsp; They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans.&nbsp; Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers:&nbsp; Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens.&nbsp; Their two teenage daughters &mdash; Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens &mdash; were close friends on Long Island.&nbsp; But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa&rsquo;s 16th Birthday, neither of them came home.&nbsp; These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.&nbsp; Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa&rsquo;s murders.&nbsp; Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors ‑- and wound up in Kayla and Nisa&rsquo;s high school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert:&nbsp; Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you.&nbsp; Everyone in America is grieving for you.&nbsp; And 320 million hearts are breaking for you.&nbsp; We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country.&nbsp; We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States is a compassionate nation.&nbsp; We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world.&nbsp; But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America&rsquo;s children, America&rsquo;s struggling workers, and America&rsquo;s forgotten communities.&nbsp; I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things.&nbsp; I want our poor to have their chance to rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties &mdash; Democrats and Republicans &mdash; to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed.&nbsp; My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans &mdash; to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream.&nbsp; Because Americans are dreamers too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country:&nbsp; Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez &mdash; he goes by CJ.&nbsp; CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets.&nbsp; At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ&rsquo;s murder.&nbsp; But he did not cave to threats or fear.&nbsp; Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island.&nbsp; His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CJ:&nbsp; Great work.&nbsp; Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform.&nbsp; Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise &mdash; one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the four pillars of our plan:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age &mdash; that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration.&nbsp; Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second pillar fully secures the border.&nbsp; That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe.&nbsp; Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country &mdash; and it finally ends the dangerous practice of &ldquo;catch and release.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third pillar ends the visa lottery &mdash; a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people.&nbsp; It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system &mdash; one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration.&nbsp; Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.&nbsp; Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children.&nbsp; This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration.&nbsp; In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem.&nbsp; This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first.&nbsp; So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses:&nbsp; 174 deaths per day.&nbsp; Seven per hour.&nbsp; We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need.&nbsp; The struggle will be long and difficult &mdash; but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico.&nbsp; Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department.&nbsp; He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca.&nbsp; Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin.&nbsp; When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep.&nbsp; She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him:&nbsp; &ldquo;You will do it &mdash; because you can.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids.&nbsp; Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca.&nbsp; In an instant, she agreed to adopt.&nbsp; The Holets named their new daughter Hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan and Rebecca:&nbsp; You embody the goodness of our Nation.&nbsp; Thank you, and congratulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we rebuild America&rsquo;s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values.&nbsp; In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression.&nbsp; Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we are not there yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth.&nbsp; One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.&nbsp; But there is much more work to be done.&nbsp; We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight.&nbsp; Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion.&nbsp; Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape.&nbsp; He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway.&nbsp; He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin&rsquo;s selfless love for a fellow warrior.&nbsp; Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas.&nbsp; Raqqa is liberated.&nbsp; And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a &ldquo;V&rdquo; for &ldquo;Valor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Staff Sergeant Peck:&nbsp; All of America salutes you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil.&nbsp; When possible, we annihilate them.&nbsp; When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them.&nbsp; But we must be clear:&nbsp; Terrorists are not merely criminals.&nbsp; They are unlawful enemy combatants.&nbsp; And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield &mdash; including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So today, I am keeping another promise.&nbsp; I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guant&aacute;namo Bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa&rsquo;ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists &mdash; wherever we chase them down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement.&nbsp; Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before:&nbsp; I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America&rsquo;s sovereign right to make this recognition.&nbsp; American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America&rsquo;s friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.&nbsp; America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea&rsquo;s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.&nbsp; I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia.&nbsp; On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea.&nbsp; At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state.&nbsp; After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June &mdash; horribly injured and on the verge of death.&nbsp; He passed away just days after his return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otto&rsquo;s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight &mdash; along with Otto&rsquo;s brother and sister, Austin and Greta.&nbsp; You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all.&nbsp; Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto&rsquo;s memory with American resolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime.&nbsp; His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea.&nbsp; One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food.&nbsp; In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.&nbsp; He woke up as a train ran over his limbs.&nbsp; He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain.&nbsp; His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves &mdash; permanently stunting their own growth.&nbsp; Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China.&nbsp; His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians.&nbsp; He had &mdash; and he resolved to be free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.&nbsp; Most of his family followed.&nbsp; His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most ‑- the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come.&nbsp; Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seong-ho&rsquo;s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America.&nbsp; It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness.&nbsp; But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea:&nbsp; that they could rule themselves.&nbsp; That they could chart their own destiny.&nbsp; And that, together, they could light up the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is what our country has always been about.&nbsp; That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom.&nbsp; She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monuments to Washington and Jefferson &mdash; to Lincoln and King.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga &mdash; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond.&nbsp; And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And freedom stands tall over one more monument:&nbsp; this one.&nbsp; This Capitol.&nbsp; This living monument to the American people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us &mdash; defending hope, pride, and the American way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They work in every trade.&nbsp; They sacrifice to raise a family.&nbsp; They care for our children at home.&nbsp; They defend our flag abroad.&nbsp; They are strong moms and brave kids.&nbsp; They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But above all else, they are Americans.&nbsp; And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americans fill the world with art and music.&nbsp; They push the bounds of science and discovery.&nbsp; And they forever remind us of what we should never forget:&nbsp; The people dreamed this country. The people built this country.&nbsp; And it is the people who are making America great again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our families will thrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our people will prosper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you, and God bless America.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade with a lacklustre tone amid several key releases and after the losses in US where the S&amp;P 500 posted its worst 2-day performance since May last year. ASX 200 (Unch) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) are cautious as the energy sector continues to underperform in Australia, while Japanese stock news has been dominated by earnings. Furthermore, the region also mulls over mixed Chinese Official PMI data in which Non-Manufacturing PMI topped estimates but Non-Manufacturing PMI disappointed, which in turn has clouded over Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD trades relatively flat against its major counterparts amid a non-committal tone ahead of President Trump&rsquo;s State of the Union Address. Nonetheless, AUD underperforms on the data releases including softer than expected CPI numbers and disappointing Chinese Official Manufacturing PMI data, which dragged AUD/NZD to below the 1.1000 handle. Furthermore, JPY briefly saw safe-haven inflows upon the release of the aforementioned Chinese PMI, although this was pared shortly after as JGBs were underpinned and Japanese yields fell following the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement in which it upped its purchase amounts in 3yr-5yr maturities.</p>\r\n",
