He added that he is comfortable with rates rising towards the neutral level, but he is unsure how many more hikes it will take to get o neutral (NOTE: previous to last week&rsquo;s FOMC, estimated that was between 2.25-2.75%). Bostic noted neither wages nor inflation seem to be heading for an unsustainable increase, with the latter likely to remain around the target of 2%. He noted the economy is in a pretty good place, but he feels the recent strength is due to temporary factors and is not a major shift in momentum. Business optimism is being affected by trade and tariff concerns. He warned about being cavalier over a possible yield inversion and stated a press conference after every policy meeting a good thing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB SPEAK: ECB&#39;s Vasiliauskas (Hawkish)</strong> noted risks to the Euro-area economy are balanced, and said the decision on interest rate change can be expected towards Autumn next year (in line with the ECB&rsquo;s guidance).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>North Korean leader is to arrive in Beijing as early as Tuesday for his third meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA:</strong> The NAHB Housing Market Index for June came in at 68, 2 points below the recent average and consensus of 70. Economic growth is expected to keep demand strong though buyers face affordability struggles, Wells Fargo said, adding that the fall in the index was largely due to higher lumber prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.21%, NASDAQ COMP -0.06%, DJI -0.41%.</strong> SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -1.48%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.16%, Energy: +1.13%, Financials: -0.07%, Health Care: -0.98%, Industrials: -0.38%, Materials: -0.26%, Telecoms: -1.97%, Tech: +0.26%, Utilities: +0.35%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intel (INTC) was lower following a downgrade at Northland, which predicts a decline in server growth in Q3 and sees no clear catalyst for the chipmaker following its last earnings report; Northland sees more competition from Advanced Macro Devices (AMD).

On the flipside, China&rsquo;s JD.com (JD) was higher following a $550mln investment from Alphabet&rsquo;s (GOOGL) Google as part of a strategic partnership. CVX outperformed in the DJI as it is to reduce costs by looking to introduce shared pipelines in its new $88bln Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG plants in Australia, also the energy giant benefitted from Monday&rsquo;s higher oil prices, as did Range Resources (RRC) despite being replaced by Broadridge (BR) in the S&amp;P500 at the open today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) UNCHANGED AT 119-19. </strong>Treasuries were little changed, and traded relatively rangebound on Monday, though some downside pressure was seen across the complex in afternoon trade as the dollar weakened moderately, and as equities recovered some of the losses seen previously after China retaliated to US tariffs. Bumper issuance from Bayer added downside pressure to the complex, launching an 8-part USD 15bln to finance the acquisition of Monsanto. Volumes were generally thin, and at settlement, major curve spreads were little changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (N8) SETTLE 79 CENTS HIGHER AT $65.85/BBL; BRENT (Q8) FUTURES SETTLE $1.90 HIGHER AT $75.34/BBL. </strong>Ahead of the series of OPEC/OPEC+ meetings this week, the groups are to discuss relaxing output as to add between 300k BPD to 600k BPD of supply to the market, sources reported on Monday. The amount looks to be a compromise from the 1.5mln BPD that Russia has argued for in recent weeks, likely to appease the likes of Iran, Iraq and Venezuela, who are happy with the status quo &ndash; there were reports over the weekend that the three will veto any OPEC decision to lift output by that magnitude (OPEC require unanimous decision in order to change their output quotas). UAE&rsquo;s oil minister on Monday said the global oil market is close to rebalancing; Ecuador&rsquo;s oil minister also delivered comments on Monday, stating that OPEC is to discuss oil production increase by 1.5mln BPD. According to UBS&rsquo; calculations, 400k BPD supply rise will likely be needed to offset declines in Venezuelan production in H2 2018, and this estimate could be subject to upward revisions if Iranian exports begin to slip in response to US sanctions on the nation. And on Monday, there was a reminder that the fragile geopolitical situation in Libya could add to supply outages, with Libyan production shut-ins to rise to 400k BPD is the oil port shutdowns continue, according to the NOC (note: supply disruptions currently stand at 240k BPD, according to PVM). Elsewhere, there are continued signs that the Saudis are nudging exports up: JODI data on Monday reported Saudi exports rose by 190k MM to 7.312mln BPD in April. Elsewhere, according to EIA data, US total shale regions oil production (July) is seen higher by 141k BPD at 7.34mln BPD (June expected a 128k BPD rise). Ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s API, the latest Reuters poll finds analysts expect headline crude stocks to draw by 2.7mln this week, distillates are seen drawing by 0.4mln and gasoline by 0.5mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>An early attempt to retest 95.000+ highs fell just shy of last Friday&rsquo;s new 2018 high, and the index subsequently faded to circa 94.700 before stabilising again. US-China trade wars are back to the fore after reciprocal $50bln tariffs, but this only partially undermined the Dollar alongside rebounds in certain rival currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>A G10 underperformer through most of Monday&rsquo;s session amidst niggling Brexit uncertainty ahead of parliament votes on amendments to amendments of the EU withdrawal bill that were rejected last week, and in the run up to Thursday&rsquo;s BoE policy calls that could arguably be more dovish/less hawkish than the ECB last week. Cable meandered between 1.3225-85 and EURGBP from 0.8730-80 as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, JPY: </strong>The Franc was a gradual gainer and just eclipsed its safe-haven peer as it rebounded a bit further from parity vs the USD and 1.1600 vs the EUR on renewed safe-haven demand as Germany&rsquo;s ruling coalition continued to discuss the contentious immigration issue and the CSU set an end of June deadline to Merkel&rsquo;s CDU to come up with a mutually acceptable resolution. Meanwhile, USDJPY continued to trade either side of 110.50, and mainly lower as the day wore on and Greenback lost its initial momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, CAD, NZD, AUD:</strong> All losinf moderately vs the USD as the single currency recovered to reclaim 1.1600, while the USDCAD defended 1.3200, with the aid of a rebound in oil prices. Looking down under, the Kiwi and AUD were both very constrained around 0.6950 and just over 0.7400 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>More pain for the likes of the Lira, Peso, Rand and Real on a combination of negative/bearish factors and regardless of concerted attempts to draw lines in the sand via daily intervention and some new moves/initiatives aimed at curbing local currency depreciation. On that note, Turkish President Erdogan issued a plea for citizens to exchange USDs and Euros into TRY.</p>\r\n",

The amount looks to be a compromise from the 1.5mln BPD that Russia has argued for in recent weeks, likely to appease the likes of Iran, Iraq and Venezuela, who are happy with the status quo &ndash; there were reports over the weekend that the three will veto any OPEC decision to lift output by that magnitude (OPEC require unanimous decision in order to change their output quotas). UAE&rsquo;s oil minister on Monday said the global oil market is close to rebalancing. According to UBS&rsquo; calculations, 400k BPD supply rise will likely be needed to offset declines in Venezuelan production in H2 2018, and this estimate could be subject to upward revisions if Iranian exports begin to slip in response to US sanctions on the nation. And on Monday, there was a reminder that the fragile geopolitical situation in Libya could add to supply outages, with Libyan production shut-ins to rise to 400k BPD is the oil port shutdowns continue, according to the NOC (note: supply disruptions currently stand at 240k BPD, according to PVM). Elsewhere, there are continued signs that the Saudis are nudging exports up: JODI data on Monday reported Saudi exports rose by 190k MM to 7.312mln BPD in April. Elsewhere, according to EIA data, US total shale regions oil production (July) is seen higher by 141k BPD at 7.34mln BPD (June expected a 128k BPD rise). Ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s API, the latest Reuters poll finds analysts expect headline crude stocks to draw by 2.7mln this week, distillates are seen drawing by 0.4mln and gasoline by 0.5mln.</p>\r\n",

US-China trade wars are back to the fore after reciprocal $50 bn tariffs, but this only partially undermined the Dollar alongside rebounds in certain rival currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A G10 underperformer through most of Monday&rsquo;s session amidst niggling Brexit uncertainty ahead of parliament votes on amendments to amendments of the EU withdrawal bill that were rejected last week, and in the run up to Thursday&rsquo;s BoE policy calls that could arguably be more dovish/less hawkish than the ECB last week. Cable meandered between 1.3225-85 and Eur/Gbp from 0.8730-80 as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc was a gradual gainer and just eclipsed its safe-haven peer as it rebounded a bit further from parity vs the Usd and 1.1600 vs the Eur on renewed safe-haven demand as Germany&rsquo;s ruling coalition continued to discuss the contentious immigration issue and the CSU set an end of June deadline to Merkel&rsquo;s CDU to come up with a mutually acceptable resolution. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy continued to trade either side of 110.50, and mainly lower as the day wore on and Greenback lost its initial momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All now pretty flat vs the Usd as the single currency recovered to reclaim 1.1600, while the Loonie defended 1.3200 lows with the aid of a rebound in oil prices (prompted by latest pre-OPEC summit speculation that the cartel and other major producers are mulling a 300-600k bpd output rise vs circa 1.5-1.8 mn touted previously). Looking down under, the Kiwi and Aud were both very constrained near 0.6950 and just over 0.7400 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A marked underperformer as Sweden&rsquo;s Democratic Party called for an EU referendum, and the Krona handed back a chunk of its recent gains towards 10.2800 vs 10.2000 at one stage and the June low just below 10.1000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More pain for the likes of the Lira, Peso, Rand and Real on a combination of negative/bearish factors and regardless of concerted attempts to draw lines in the sand via daily intervention and some new moves/initiatives aimed at curbing local currency depreciation. On that note, Turkish President Erdogan issued a plea for citizens to exchange Usds and Euros into Try.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Rightmove House Prices (Jun) Y/Y 1.7% (Prev. 1.1%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities (Eurostoxx 50 -1.1%) took impetus from Asia as the fallout from the US-China tariff dispute continue to subdue the market. FTSE 100 (-0.3%) outperforms its major peers as the index is kept afloat by currency effects. Broad-based losses are seen across all sectors while energy names outperform following the rebound of oil prices (following OPEC source reports that a smaller than expected output hike is to be discussed). Looking at stock specifics, Aviva (+1.6%) and RSA (+0.7%) are amongst UK&rsquo;s top performers after reports that DAX 30 heavyweight Allianz (-1.0%) is considering the companies for a large UK deal. Elsewhere, Hermes (-0.4%) replaced Lafargeholcim (-0.9%) in the CAC 40 today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Dollar is mixed overall, but the index did revisit 95.000+ ytd peaks (around 95.150) forged in wake of last week&rsquo;s divergent Fed and ECB policy actions/guidance in early EU trade before losing momentum as EUR and GBP regained some composure. A clearer or convincing break above the big figure would bring strong resistance just ahead of 95.500, but this may also require other G10 pairs to breach levels that have held so far, like 111.00 in Usd/Jpy and 1.3200 in Usd/Cad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - As noted, the major laggards as Eur/Usd struggles to recover from last week&rsquo;s dovish ECB rate guidance, while Cable is range-bound between 1.3225-85 amidst ongoing Brexit jitters and ahead of this week&rsquo;s BoE policy meeting that is widely if not unanimously expected to see the MPC stand pat again and signal no urgency to normalise policy further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD -Relative outperformers with Usd/Jpy pivoting around 110.50 and the Jpy benefiting from a degree of safe-haven demand amidst the latest import tariff trade-off between the US and China, while the Loonie has recovered some lost ground to trade back above 1.3200 vs its US peer after sliding in wake of the G7 fall-out. Note, latest OPEC spec suggesting 300-600k BPD output increase has boosted crude prices and the Cad to a degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD/NZD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with the Franc holding just above parity, Aud above 0.7400 and Kiwi at 0.6900+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY - Attempting to pare some of its recent losses beyond 4.7000 vs the Usd, but still looking very vulnerable against the backdrop of widespread EM weakness relative to the Dollar as Turkey&rsquo;s election looms and polls indicate a very unpredictable outcome. Indeed, even improvements in the jobless rate and a swing in the budget balance to a surplus from deficit is not offering the Lira any real comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some debt market observers and practitioners are pointing to the fact that Bunds were able to stave off a deeper set-back in early Eurex trade and defended the 161.00 line, while Gilts fended off sellers at the 122.50 level and this resilience prompted dip-buyers to chance their arm. However, this notion has more specific technical backing as the 161.02 low in the German 10 year future also closed a chart gap and the rebound achieved a bullish target around 161.31 on the way to the 161.41 peak, but with 161.48-52 not yet threatened and the upper end of that range housing last Friday&rsquo;s post-ECB high. Back to Liffe, the core 10 year bond reached 122.80 before fading, and weakness in EU stocks may well be impacting too. Turning to US Treasuries, the complex is poised</p>\r\n\r\n<p>close to mid-range levels between overnight session parameters and with the curve mildly flatter yet again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is extending the losses seen at the end of last week as concerns over Chinese crude tariffs hit the market. WTI is down as investors are selling the fossil fuel on this news, as well as ahead of the upcoming OPEC meetings this week that are set to announce increased production for the cartel. Brent is outperforming WTI on Libyan internal conflicts affecting refinery production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source reports stated that OPEC is said to discuss an output hike of 300k-600k bpd, while Saudi and Russia are said to work on making the oil alliance permanent. Furthermore, OPEC members are said to be looking for a compromise to overcome the Iran dissent. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weekend reports noted that Russian Energy Minister Novak stated OPEC and non-OPEC countries will discuss raising oil output by 1.5mln bpd in Q3 only. However, Iran stated that 3 OPEC members (Iraq, Iran &amp; Venezuela) will veto a proposed production increase. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope gold is in the green (+0.2%) as market sentiment sours on Chinese trade concerns and investors are flocking to safe haven assets. Copper has slipped for the second straight session and is at USD 6,997/tonne hovering just above 2 week lows as supply concerns continue to ease. Aluminium is also falling and has hit 2 month lows at USD 2,193/tonne, with support seen at the 200dma of USD 2,175/tonne</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libya&rsquo;s NOC said a fire at two storage tanks in Libya&rsquo;s Ras Lanuf reduced storage capacity to 550k barrels from 950k barrels. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venezuela&rsquo;s PDVSA Isla refinery in Curacao is closed due to lack of crude, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

Nearest support is 1.3210 and for Eur/Usd the 2018 base at 1.1510.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD - Marginal outperformers with Usd/Jpy pivoting around 110.50 and the Jpy benefiting from a degree of safe-haven demand amidst the latest import tariff trade-off between the US and China, while the Loonie has recovered some lost ground to trade back above 1.3200 vs its US peer after sliding in wake of the G7 fall-out. Note, latest OPEC spec suggesting 300-600k BPD output increase has boosted crude prices and the Cad to a degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD/NZD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with the Franc holding just above parity, Aud above 0.7400 and Kiwi at 0.6900+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY - Attempting to pare some of its recent losses beyond 4.7000 vs the Usd, but still looking very vulnerable against the backdrop of widespread EM weakness relative to the Dollar as Turkey&rsquo;s election looms and polls indicate a very unpredictable outcome. Indeed, even improvements in the jobless rate and a swing in the budget balance to a surplus from deficit is not offering the Lira any real comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some debt market observers and practitioners are pointing to the fact that Bunds were able to stave off a deeper set-back in early Eurex trade and defended the 161.00 line, while Gilts fended off sellers at the 122.50 level and this resilience prompted dip-buyers to chance their arm. However, this notion has more specific technical backing as the 161.02 low in the German 10 year future also closed a chart gap and the rebound achieved a bullish target around 161.31 on the way to the 161.41 peak, but with 161.48-52 not yet threatened and the upper end of that range housing last Friday&rsquo;s post-ECB high. Back to Liffe, the core 10 year bond reached 122.80 before fading, and weakness in EU stocks may well be impacting too. Turning to US Treasuries, the complex is poised close to mid-range levels between overnight session parameters and with the curve mildly flatter yet again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is extending the losses seen at the end of last week as concerns over Chinese crude tariffs hit the market. WTI is down as investors are selling the fossil fuel on this news, as well as ahead of the upcoming OPEC meetings this week that are set to announce increased production for the cartel. Brent is outperforming WTI on Libyan internal conflicts affecting refinery production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports have noted that Russian energy minister Novak stated OPEC and non-OPEC countries will discuss raising the oil output by 1.5mln bpd in Q3 only. However, Iran stated that 3 OPEC members (Iraq, Iran &amp; Venezuela) will veto a proposed production increase. Ahead of this meeting banks are expecting production increases of 700k BPD (SocGen &amp; Barclays) to 1mln BPD (Goldman Sachs). Sources in EU trade suggested that this would be a smaller hike than expected, however, with 300-600k BPD the stated figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope gold is in the green (+0.15%) as market sentiment sours on Chinese trade concerns and investors are flocking to safe haven assets. Copper has slipped for the second straight session and is at USD 6,997/tonne hovering just above 2 week lows as supply concerns continue to ease. Aluminium is also falling and has hit 2 month lows at USD 2,193/tonne, with support seen at the 200dma of USD 2,175/tonne</p>\r\n",

Global trade wars are back in the spotlight after last week&rsquo;s major focus on CB policy, and especially the ECB that sprang several surprises via the timing of the announcement to terminate QE at the end of December, while signalling at least a 9 month lead time from then until a rate hike. Looking ahead, President Draghi may expand further on the policy outlook at Sintra later today, but it is hard to imagine what he can add in terms of fresh guidance, while today&rsquo;s data slate is sparse so Bunds could continue to consolidate off recent peaks awaiting new drivers.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks backpedal at the start of the week amid several market closures and as the region also digests the tit-for-tat trade spat between US and China, in which the US confirmed tariffs on USD 50bln of Chinese goods and China responded with reciprocal tariffs of the same value against the US. ASX 200 and Nikkei 225 are both negative with Australia led lower by commodity-related sectors although upside in financials and healthcare have limited the downside, while Japan underperforms due to a firmer JPY and amid a fatal earthquake in Osaka. Elsewhere, KOSPI weakness is another fallout from the US-China tariff dispute due to fears South Korea could feel the brunt of the trade war between its 2 largest trading partners, and with index-heavyweight Samsung Electronics pressured after it was ordered to pay USD 400mln for patent infringement related to semiconductor technology. As a reminder, markets in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Indonesia are all closed for holiday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD is slightly firmer overnight as safe-haven currencies find some support from the risk averse tone and as the greenback holds on to the momentum from last week&rsquo;s more hawkish Fed undertone and divergence with the ECB on rates. This has weighed on its major counterparts with EUR/USD at a sub-1.1600 handle and with GBP/USD firmly below 1.3300, while commodity-linked currencies are also lacklustre amid a continued slip in oil prices and with NZD dampened by a softer growth outlook. Conversely, CHF and JPY fare better with JPY the biggest gaining currency overnight due to its safe-haven status and after Exports data topped estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful despite the risk averse tone, as prices take a breather from last week&rsquo;s upside and amid a lack of a Rinban announcement by the BoJ.</p>\r\n",
