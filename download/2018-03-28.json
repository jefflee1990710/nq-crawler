The buck is said to be supported by month-end rebalancing along with a more constructive tone regarding Trade Wars, many are attributing the USD strength to an unwind of the premium within safe haven FX, with USDJPY flirting with 107.00 in Wednesday trade (the north Korea headlines helped buoy the pair), while gold slides towards $1320. Month-end models also see EUR selling, and the single currency gradually slid against the USD through the course of US trading, coming back to test the 1.23 level, which has been cited as key support. In quiet trade, GBPUSD mirrored EURUSD action, sliding by around 0.5% to the ~1.41 level, trading slightly below the figure as we head into Asia. The oil slide/risk-off tone did nothing to help AUD or NZD; the former has backed-off 0.77 towards 0.7650, while the latter has found support above 0.72. EMFX was a function of USD strength, though positive NAFTA landscape (the focus in Trade Wars has shifted to China) has helped the peso.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SNB&#39;s Maechler said CHF is still highly valued and that raising rates too soon would be counter-productive, while Maechler added that if SNB ended expansive policy there is a risk of jeopardising favourable developments.

The cash contract was meandering around the neutral line for most of US trade. Defensives were better performers amid a generally soft risk tone. Most FAANG saw another day of selling (though Alphabet and FB fared well). In stock specifics, a number of brokerages cut their estimates for AAPL iPhone production in Q2 citing soft demand for high-end smartphones. For CVS and AET, an FDA official expressed concerns about consolidation within the pharmacy benefit management sector. In M&amp;A, CACI withdrew its offer to buy CSRA (GD also recently made an offer). And in earnings, WBA beat on the top and bottom lines.

Naturally, there was focus on 10-year yields, after they moved below the 200dma. At settlement, the curve was mixed; there was more clarity in curve spreads, however, with 2s10s c.2bps flatter, 2s30s c.4bps flatter (to the narrowest since 2007), 5s10s 2bps flatter, and 5s30s 4bps flatter. 2s5s was relatively unchanged. This week&#39;s bumper supply out of the US Treasury was capped by a weak 7-year auction, which tailed by 1.9bps, with cover softer than recent averages.

The cash contract was meandering around the neutral line for most of US trade. Defensives were better performers amid a generally soft risk tone. Most FAANG saw another day of selling (though Alphabet and FB fared well).&nbsp;In stock specifics, a number of brokerages cut their estimates for AAPL iPhone production in Q2 citing soft demand for high-end smartphones. For CVS and AET, an FDA official expressed concerns about consolidation within the pharmacy benefit management sector. In M&amp;A, CACI withdrew its offer to buy CSRA (GD also recently made an offer). And in earnings, WBA beat on the top and bottom lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: US T-Note Futures (Jun)&nbsp;unchanged at 120-29. </strong>Yields started out the day lower on risk-aversion, while portfolio re-balancing was also being cited ahead of month-end (extensions are said to be supportive this month). Naturally, there was focus on 10-year yields, after they moved below the 200dma. At settlement, the curve was mixed; there was more clarity in curve spreads, however, with 2s10s c.2bps flatter, 2s30s c.4bps flatter (to the narrowest since 2007), 5s10s 2bps flatter, and 5s30s 4bps flatter. 2s5s was relatively unchanged.&nbsp;This week&#39;s bumper supply out of the US Treasury was capped by a weak 7-year auction, which tailed&nbsp;by 1.9bps, with cover softer than recent averages. Other internals were also weak, with dealer take down rising to 32% (12 ppts higher than recent averages), while indirect participation was the lowest since Feb 2016. Yields ticked higher after the auction, moving into negative territory.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX: DXY +0.8% heading into APAC trade.&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;<strong>DXY&nbsp;</strong>closes green for the second day, rising above 90.00, now eyeing the 90.50 level which marks the top-end of its recent range. The buck is said to be supported by month-end rebalancing. along with a more constructive tone regarding Trade Wars, many are attributing the USD strength to an unwind of the premium within safe haven FX, with&nbsp;<strong>USDJPY&nbsp;</strong>flirting with 107.00 in Wednesday trade (the north Korea headlines helped buoy the pair), while gold slides towards $1320. Month-end models also see&nbsp;<strong>EUR&nbsp;</strong>selling, and the single currency gradually slid against the USD through the course of US trading, coming back to test the 1.23 level, which has been cited as key support. In quiet trade, GBPUSD mirrored EURUSD action, sliding by around 0.5% to the ~1.41 level, trading slightly below the figure as we head into Asia. The oil slide/risk-off tone did nothing to help AUD or NZD; the former has backed-off 0.77 towards 0.7650, while the latter has found support above 0.72. EMFX was a function of USD strength, though positive NAFTA landscape (the focus in Trade Wars has shifted to China) has helped the peso.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE:&nbsp;</strong><strong>WTI futures for May settle 87 cents lower at $64.38/bbl; Brent settles 58 cents lower at $69.53/bbl.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>WTI red for the third straight session, with inventory data and USD strength weighing on the complex. DOE energy inventory data showed headline crude stocks building more moderately than was suggested by API data on Tuesday, helping crude prices to stage a small rally. However, that rally proved fleeting, and as the dust settled, prices came back within the day&rsquo;s range, before continuing the drift lower beneath $64, before gradually making its way back above the figure. Crude looked-through another dose of OPEC jawboning; on Tuesday, Iraq&rsquo;s oil minister said that some crude exporters would like to extend the supply cut agreement for another six months (when it expires at the end of the year), while OPEC&rsquo;s Sec Gen Barkindo said oil industry investments are on an upswing, though is yet to reach pre-crisis levels. Crude traders have been taking their cues from geopolitical developments in recent trade, rather than fundamentals/OPEC jawbone; today EU envoys said Iranian sanctions is being sought at the next foreign minister&rsquo;s meeting on 16/April (recall, US President Trump has until 12/May to make a decision on whether to reapply sanctions on Iran)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;* GEOPOLITICS:&nbsp;</strong>North Korea continues to signal a dovish approach to peace negotiations through&nbsp;conciliatory actions. After it was confirmed that it held talks with China over the weekend, today Japanese press reported the nation was looking to hold a summit with Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US Q4 GDP:&nbsp;</strong>The third reading of Q4 GDP data saw upward revisions to the headline (2.9% vs 2.7% exp) putting 2017 growth at 2.6%. Q4 growth was buoyed by consumer sector (Strongest showing in three years) and less drag from inventories. Analysts noted that the conditions are in place for continued growth in 2018 (tax cuts and fiscal expenditure), which should keep the Fed on course to tighten policy through the year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>THIS WEEK&rsquo;S SUPPLY:&nbsp;Ex-bills, the US Treasury will sell USD 109bln this week in 2-year (USD 30bln, Monday), 5-year notes (USD 35bln, Tuesday), 7-year (USD 29bln, Wednesday), as well as a 2-year FRN (USD 15bln, Wednesday). With USD 66.3bln maturing at end-month settlement, net supply is implied at USD 42.7bln, according to TD Securities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:&nbsp;The January auction of 7-year notes was poor, tailing by 0.7bps versus the 1pm when issued yield, while the auction saw the softest cover since November. In terms of positioning, SocGen has noted that dealers are long in the 6 to 7-year bucket to the tune of USD 5.7bln, the highest in five weeks. SocGen argues that the current 7-year trades cheap on asset swap versus off-the-runs, though trades rich on the fly versus 5s and 10s. The bank therefore has a negative bias heading into the 7-year auction. The bank notes that month-end extension may provide support for the auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"350\" src=\"/system/ckeditor_assets/pictures/27/content_7y_history.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Aside from a few interruptions and minor corrections, the overriding trend has been more Dollar buying for end of March, Q1 and Japanese fiscal year end portfolio rebalancing purposes. Indeed, with only one full trading session left of the current month the Greenback has extended gains vs all G10 counterparts plus other majors and EM currencies. The DXY has subsequently staged a firmer bounce from recent sub-89.000 lows to within striking distance of the 90.000 level again, and could continue its revival on any residual/last minute demand ahead of the long Easter weekend. The &lsquo;safe-havens&rsquo; are underperforming as ongoing global trade/protectionism tensions appear to be less pronounced vs latest signs of progress on the geopolitical front via NK-SK-US nuclear talks. Usd/Chf is up around 0.9550 again and Eur/Chf not far off 1.1800+ year-to-date peaks (in fact, highest since the SNB peg was removed back in January 2015) amidst more Swiss CB commentary about the highly valued Franc and dovish monetary policy rhetoric. Usd/Jpy eclipsed its 200 HMA and a key Fib on the way through 106.00-20 offers, with the Jpy also undermined by selling interest from domestic importers and potential M&amp;A related flows (due to Takeda&rsquo;s designs on Shire). Eur/Usd tried to hang around 1.2400, but caved and breached its 100 HMA and is now testing support in the 1.2339-35 area, which includes the 30 DMA. Cable looks to have topped out again circa 1.4200 and eventually took out macro offers between 1.4135-25 to lose grip of the 1.4000 handle, while the commodity bloc also lost more ground vs the Usd &ndash; Aud testing 0.7750 and a fib, Nzd under 0.7250 and a decent option expiry at the strike and Cad testing the psychological 1.2900 level again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>European equities have extended losses after tech slipped on Wall St. and Asia</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>USD firmer vs. all G10 approaching quarter and Japanese financial year end</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Looking ahead, highlights include US GDP, PCE Prices, Pending Home Sales, DoEs and Fed&rsquo;s Bostic</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian equity markets traded negative across the board as the region followed suit from the losses on Wall St&nbsp;where trade concerns lingered and tech sold-off, while some also attributed the exacerbated pressure to flows heading into month-end and Easter break. As such,&nbsp;<strong>ASX 200 (-0.7%)&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Nikkei 225 (-1.3%)</strong>&nbsp;were lower as tech stocks conformed to the losses in their counterparts stateside, while weakness in commodities also contributed to the glum. Elsewhere<strong>,&nbsp;KOSPI (-1.3%)</strong>&nbsp;pharmaceutical and metal stocks joined the tech underperformance after reports stated South Korea steel exports to US would decline 30% under the new trade agreement and that South Korea will amend its premium pricing program for pharmaceuticals to allow participation of US drug makers.&nbsp;<strong>Hang Seng (-2.5%)</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%)</strong>&nbsp;were also dragged by the tech slide, while encouraging earnings from big 4 banks ICBC and China Construction Bank only provided brief support and was eventually engulfed by the stock rout. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw a tale of two-halves as they initially tracked the gains in T-notes amid a flight to quality from the stock market sell-off and with the BoJ also present in the market under its bond buying program, before gains were then pared on return from the Tokyo break in which prices returned flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations again today for a net drain of CNY 10bln. (Newswires)<br /><a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/pboc-sets-cny-mid-point-at-6-2785-prev-6-2816-28-03-2018\">PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.2785 (Prev. 6.2816)</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda reiterates to continue pursuing powerful easing and says commitment is vital to increase policy impact. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK is said to inform Irish officials that a resolution to the hard border issue is imminent, according to sources. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities (Eurostoxx -1.0%) have extended on the risk-averse tone seen in the US and Asia, triggered by a tech sell-off which prompted losses within the IT sector in Europe this morning, augmented by month-end flows. As such, semiconductors are the laggards with Dialog Semiconductors (-13.0%), Infineon (-4.0%), ASML Holding (-4.4%) and STMicroelectronics (-5.2%) the worst performers whereas utilities remain slightly supported. In terms of individual movers, Shire (+15.5%) is leading the FTSE 100 and lifting the healthcare sector (+0.5%) after Takeda confirmed to be considering an offer for the Co., although considerations are at a prelim stage and no approach has been made yet. Elsewhere, Melrose (-0.5%) have continued to defend their approach for GKN ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another rebalancing model is Usd positive for month, quarter and Japanese financial year end, albeit &lsquo;moderately&rsquo;, while a separate bank is looking to buy the Greenback vs the Pound, Loonie, Aud and Nok if global stocks fall further. Hence, the Dollar retains an underlying bid on dips and is firmer vs all G10 peers bar the Gbp, which is deriving some independent support on latest Brexit headlines (reports that an Irish border resolution is in the offing). Cable and Eur/Gbp are bucking the broader trend, with the former hovering just below 1.4200 after a retreat to test the first layer of bids said to be macro-related in the 1.4135-25 area, and the latter seeing some resistance around 0.8750. Eur/Usd is also holding up relatively well near 1.2400 where decent option expiry interest lies (1.6 bn), but also as tech support at the 100 HMA (1.2379) holds. In fact, the Eur is defying some end of March &lsquo;strong&rsquo; selling calls and outperforming other majors, like the Sek and Nok in wake of weaker than expected retail sales data from both Scandi nations overall. Even the Chf is weaker despite the resurgence of risk aversion, while its traditional safe-haven counterpart, Jpy, is caught between the aforementioned downturn in sentiment and more positive geopolitical vibes on the NK-SK-US front. Usd/Jpy rangy between 105.69 and 105.96 200 HMA and Fib levels respectively. Usd/Cad is back around 1.2900 despite constructive NAFTA negotiations, while Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd remain bearish, as the former has breached its recent 0.7672 low and the latter tests support/bids at 0.7250.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10-year EU benchmarks have received another fillip as bearish pre-equity open indications come to fruition, and Bunds have now extended gains through initial tech resistance and yesterday&rsquo;s 159.42 Eurex intraday apex, at 159.69 (+46 ticks), with 159.62 next on the radar. Similarly, Gilts resumed Liffe on the front foot and have already surpassed the Jun18 contract peak set last Thursday (122.26) at 122.69 (+55 ticks vs +10 ticks at the early low) and the upside objective from here is 123.00, as 122.65 represented a continuation chart high. US Treasuries tagging along and now more firmly back in bull-flattening mode, as asset correlations/positioning take on traditional FTQ characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The commodities complex continues to be subdued amid the dampened risk appetite. WTI (-0.9%) and Brent (-0.6%) futures are extending losses with prices pressured by the surprise build in API crude inventories (5.321M vs. Exp. -0.300M). Additionally, the Iraqi oil Minister Luaibi stated that Iraq will not deviate from any OPEC decisions on crude supply; this follows the Saudi Crown Prince stating OPEC seeks a 10 to 20-year supply co-operation with Russia as well as other producers. Gold (-0.1%) slipped from a 5-week high as a firmer dollar is weighing on the yellow metal. Fears of a trade war continue to cast a shadow over the base metal market with copper (-0.6%) lower and Dalian iron ore futures slipping to their lowest since June shortly after the open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US API weekly crude stocks (23 Mar) 5.321M vs. Exp. -0.300M (Prev. -2.739M). (Newswires)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraq says it is not difficult to boost oil output capacity to 12mln bpd. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some oil exporting nations have proposed a 6-month supply cut extension, according to the Iraqi oil minister. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phillips 66 reported a unit upset at the Wood River refinery. (Newswires)<em> This refinery has a crude capacity of 314k bpd. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports confirmed that North Korean Leader Kim met with Chinese President Xi in which they exchanged views on improving ties and the situation in Korean peninsula, while North Korea Leader Kim was also said to be committed to denuclearization of Korean peninsula. (Xinhua)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Foreign Minister said ballistic missiles were launched by Iranian and Hezbollah agents and that Saudi has evidence of Iran arming Houthis with ballistic missiles. Furthermore, the Saudi Foreign Minister stated that the kingdom reserves the right to respond at appropriate time, while there were also separate Saudi Arabia and UN inked agreement to support Yemen.

As such, semiconductors are the laggards with Dialog Semiconductors (-10.4%), Infineon (-4.0%), ASML Holding (-4.8%) and STMicroelectronics (-5.1%) the worst performers whereas utilities remain slightly supported. In terms of individual movers, Shire (+2.8%) is leading the FTSE 100 amid an unconfirmed rumour cited in the Telegraph that Takeda could launch a takeover for the Co. whilst Melrose (-0.7%) have continued to defend their approach for GKN ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another rebalancing model is <strong>Usd</strong> positive for month, quarter and Japanese financial year end, albeit &lsquo;moderately&rsquo;, while a separate bank is looking to buy the Greenback vs the Pound, <strong>Loonie</strong>, <strong>Aud</strong> and <strong>Nok</strong> if global stocks fall further. Hence, the Dollar retains an underlying bid on dips and is firmer vs all G10 peers bar the <strong>Gbp</strong>, which is deriving some independent support on latest Brexit headlines (reports that an Irish border resolution is in the offing). Cable and <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Gbp</strong> are bucking the broader trend, with the former hovering just below 1.4200 after a retreat to test the first layer of bids said to be macro-related in the 1.4135-25 area, and the latter seeing some resistance around 0.8750. <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> is also holding up relatively well near 1.2400 where decent option expiry interest lies (1.6 bn), but also as tech support at the 100 HMA (1.2379) holds. In fact, the <strong>Eur</strong> is defying some end of March &lsquo;strong&rsquo; selling calls and outperforming other majors, like the <strong>Sek</strong> and <strong>Nok</strong> in wake of weaker than expected retail sales data from both Scandi nations overall. Even the <strong>Chf</strong> is weaker despite the resurgence of risk aversion, while its traditional safe-haven counterpart, <strong>Jpy</strong>, is caught between the aforementioned downturn in sentiment and more positive geopolitical vibes on the NK-SK-US front. <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong> rangy between 105.69 and 105.96 200 HMA and Fib levels respectively. <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Cad</strong> is back around 1.2900 despite constructive NAFTA negotiations, while <strong>Aud</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> and <strong>Nzd</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> remain bearish, as the former has breached its recent 0.7672 low and the latter tests support/bids at 0.7250.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10-year EU benchmarks have received another fillip as bearish pre-equity open indications come to fruition, and <strong>Bunds</strong> have now extended gains through initial tech resistance and yesterday&rsquo;s 159.42 Eurex intraday apex, at 159.69 (+46 ticks), with 159.62 next on the radar. Similarly, <strong>Gilts</strong> resumed Liffe on the front foot and have already surpassed the Jun18 contract peak set last Thursday (122.26) at 122.69 (+55 ticks vs +10 ticks at the early low) and the upside objective from here is 123.00, as 122.65 represented a continuation chart high. <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> tagging along and now more firmly back in bull-flattening mode, as asset correlations/positioning take on traditional FTQ characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The commodities complex continues to be subdued amid the dampened risk appetite. <strong>WTI</strong> (-0.9%) and <strong>Brent</strong> (-0.6%) futures are extending losses with prices pressured by the surprise build in API crude inventories (5.321M vs. Exp. -0.300M). Additionally, the Iraqi oil Minister Luaibi stated that Iraq will not deviate from any OPEC decisions on crude supply; this follows the Saudi Crown Prince stating OPEC seeks a 10 to 20-year supply co-operation with Russia as well as other producers. <strong>Gold</strong> (-0.1%) slipped from a 5-week high as a firmer dollar is weighing on the yellow metal. Fears of a trade war continue to cast a shadow over the base metal market with <strong>copper</strong> (-0.6%) lower and <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> futures slipping to their lowest since June shortly after the open.</p>\r\n",

In terms of positioning, SocGen has noted that dealers are long in the 6 to 7-year bucket to the tune of $5.7bln, the highest in five weeks. SocGen argues that the current 7-year trades cheap on asset swap versus off-the-runs, though trades rich on the fly versus 5s and 10s. The bank therefore has a negative bias heading into the 7-year auction. The bank notes that month-end extension may provide support for the auction.</p>\r\n",

In terms of futures, a clean break up and out of the early 159.24-34 range exposes a bullish rising channel objective and another symbolic marker at 159.50, but further gains are likely to hinge on how (badly) EU bourses react to the latest meltdown on Wall Street and knock-on losses in Asia-Pac equities overnight.

As such, <strong>ASX 200 (-0.7%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-1.6%)</strong> were lower as tech stocks conformed to the losses in their counterparts stateside, while weakness in commodities also contributed to the glum. Elsewhere, <strong>KOSPI (-1.6%)</strong> pharmaceutical and metal stocks joined the tech underperformance after reports stated South Korea steel exports to US would decline 30% under the new trade agreement and that South Korea will amend its premium pricing program for pharmaceuticals to allow participation of US drug makers. <strong>Hang Seng (-1.4%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%)</strong> were also dragged by the tech slide, while encouraging earnings from big 4 banks ICBC and China Construction Bank only provided brief support and was eventually engulfed by the stock rout. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw a tale of two-halves as they initially tracked the gains in T-notes amid a flight to quality from the stock market sell-off and with the BoJ also present in the market under its bond buying program, before gains were then pared on return from the Tokyo break in which prices returned flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations again today for a net drain of CNY 10bln.

As was the case on Monday, much of the action was focussed in the belly, where yields on 10s breached 2.80% falling to six-week lows. There was flattening in 2s5s, 2s10s, 2s30s by between 5-6bps, though 5s30s widened modestly at settlement. The US Treasury sold $35bln 5-year notes, tailing by 0.3bps &ndash; the fifth straight tail at a 5s auction. Cover was slightly higher than recent averages, while higher indirect participation was encouraging. Some remain impressed that the auction performed as it did given the bumper supply this week (slightly short of $300bln including bills).

As such, ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.6%) were lower as tech stocks conformed to the losses in their counterparts stateside, while weakness in commodities also contributed to the glum. Elsewhere, KOSPI (-1.6%) pharmaceutical and metal stocks joined the tech underperformance after reports stated South Korea steel exports to US would decline 30% under the new trade agreement and that South Korea will amend its premium pricing program for pharmaceuticals to allow participation of US drug makers. Hang Seng (-1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%) were also dragged by the tech slide, while encouraging earnings from big 4 banks ICBC and China Construction Bank only provided brief support and was eventually engulfed by the stock rout. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw a tale of two-halves as they initially tracked the gains in T-notes amid a flight to quality from the stock market sell-off and with the BoJ also present in the market under its bond buying program, before gains were then pared on return from the Tokyo break in which prices returned flat.</p>\r\n",
