EU27 envoys will also hold a Brexit meeting late on Wednesday afternoon and similarly Irish PM Varadkar has called for a special cabinet meeting to consider the EU-UK draft agreement. In response, UK opposition parties called for a meaningful vote on any Brexit withdrawal agreement; hard Brexiteers, including Rees-Mogg, were hostile to the announcement since the deal fails to keep the commitments made by PM May, keeping the UK in the customs union, and similarly Former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson announced he will vote against the deal. The Labour party also appeared sceptical with Leader Corbyn claiming that if the technical agreement does not work for the whole country, they will stand against it whilst a Liberal Democrat Leader claimed PM May will not get her Brexit deal through parliament. Following the announcement, diplomatic sources reported that EU leaders could meet for November 25th summit to seal Brexit deal if the technical agreement is approved by the Cabinet on Wednesday. Elsewhere, DUP Deputy Leader Dodds, said it is no surprise that technical talks have ended, stating that the crucial issue is when it comes to Cabinet as the Brexit deal will be a very hard sell, adding the party&#39;s concern is that the backstop becomes the default position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Today was the official EU deadline for a budget re-submission which saw the Italian government confirming it will stick to its 2.4% deficit and to its 1.5% growth target in 2019 draft reply to the EU. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Optimism continued on this front after White House Economic adviser Kudlow announced to be having &lsquo;very positive&#39; talks with China whilst adding that the benefit of a steady dollar is low inflation. In related comments, an official noted China and the US are engaging in in-depth contact and coming to a mutual understanding after the Trump-Xi call earlier this month.&nbsp; US National Security Advisor Bolton said the Trump-Xi meeting at G20 will be significant in trade talks although China officials have previously stated they do not expect the trade dispute to be resolved at the G20. In later trade, the SCMP suggested that China&#39;s key negotiator is set for US talks on trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.15% at 2722%, NDX +0.03% at 6931, DJI -0.40% at 25286. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -2.38%, Materials -0.30%, Industrials +0.45%, Cons Discretionary -0.03%, Cons Staples -0.37%, Healthcare -0.68%, Financials +0.54%, Tech +0.09%, Telecoms -0.26%, Utilities +0.35%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) surged today after beating EPS and revenue estimates whilst raising full year guidance. General Electric (GE) traded higher after announcing plans to sell USD 4bln of its stake in Baker Hughes (BHGE). Johnson Controls (JCI) was another top mover following its announcement that it will sell its Power Solutions unit. Trade-sensitive stocks Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX) rose on the back of China/US trade talk developments. Apple (AAPL) resisted a rally today after Goldman lowered its estimates for iPhone unit sales, iPhone revenue and its price target for the co. Tyson Foods (TSN) was a bottom mover, affected by its revenue missing estimates. Boeing (BA) dragged down the Dow Jones index today as safety reports determined that it had failed to give the correct pilot preparations for the Lion Air crash. Home Depot (HD) another bottom mover after it gave a negative outlook on demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 4.24 LOWER AT USD 55.69/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 4.65 LOWER AT USD 65.47/BBL.</strong> Crude ended the session in the red on Tuesday, extending losses on Trump&rsquo;s tweet that oil prices should be lower. The downfall was further supported by the monthly OPEC report which saw both 2018 and 2019 oil demand being revised lower from previous estimates whilst supply for 2018 and 2019 was upwardly revised; both elements are adding to the bearish narrative for the complex. A breakdown of the OPEC report saw crude oil output increase mostly in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Libya and Angola, while production declined in Iran, Venezuela, Kuwait and Nigeria. Elsewhere, the NNPC announced it is looking to increase oil production in 2019 to 1.8mln BPD from its current 1.6mln BPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 4 TICKS HIGHER AT 118-16+. </strong>The Treasury complex edged higher as European traders left their desks and as US equities began to slide with risk-sentiment deteriorating. Most of the action was concentrated in the front and belly of the curve were yields were lower by c.5bps. The curve was mixed as 2s5s and 2s10s narrowed by c,1bps while 5s30s and 10s30s steepened by c.2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling has staged another rebound from sub-1.2850 levels vs the Usd, and 0.8740+ vs the Eur to be precise, to just above 1.3040 at one point after the UK-EU agreed on a technical withdrawal agreement draft; nonetheless most of the moves were pared back after the text (details yet to be released) faced scepticism from lawmakers, with Cable ending the US session around 1.2950. In terms of flows and other specific price moves, Cable held above Monday&rsquo;s 1.2828 lows in early EU trade and also derived some encouragement from decent UK wage data, but again it was far from plain-sailing or one-way traffic until 1.2900 was reclaimed convincingly and then 1.2950 on the way to a few stops through yesterday&rsquo;s 1.2965 high and a circa 1.2980 peak. Meanwhile, momentum sellers were reported around 0.8690 in Eur/Gbp following a break of 0.8700 and some underlying bids around 0.8680.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, EUR, AUD:</strong> The next best majors and beneficiaries of a general pull-back in the Greenback, with the antipodean Dollars also drawing support from some tentative signs of mediation between the US and China on trade, with the Kiwi and Aud revisiting 0.6750 and 0.7200+ respectively and the latter just in time or around the NY cut when almost 2bn expiries at the 0.7200 strike rolled off. Meanwhile, the single currency bounced pretty firmly off new 2018 lows vs the Usd not far from big option barriers at 1.1200 and in part on the coat-tails of the Gbp even though Italian budget issues continue to weigh approaching the deadline of EU resubmission of the 2019 fiscal draft. Eur/Usd reached 1.1280 and largely shrugged off Economy Minister Tria&rsquo;s comments that implied no shaving of the GDP forecast for next year, but perhaps some compensation via an upgraded privatisation programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, JPY: </strong>The traditional safe-havens both pared losses as the Usd and DXY retreated (index to 97.229 vs 97.665 at one stage) with the Franc back above 1.0100 and Jpy through 114.00 again &ndash; Chf not really reacting to more benign Swiss price data via producer and import metrics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie lost further ground vs its US counterpart as crude prices continue to capitulate and slide deeper into bear market territory, with the negative streak all set to extend to 12 consecutive sessions. Moreover, the Cad and MXN (latter down through 20.5000) were also ruffled by doubts about the USMCA getting US Congressional approval, with Usd/Cad trading both sides of 1.3250 and multi-month highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK: </strong>The Norwegian Krona also underperformed vs the Eur and its SEK peer in wake of a miss in mainland Norwegian GDP, with Eur/Nok up near 9.5700 vs Eur/Sek slipping towards 10.2100.</p>\r\n",

A breakdown of the OPEC report saw crude oil output increase mostly in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Libya and Angola, while production declined in Iran, Venezuela, Kuwait and Nigeria.

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling has staged another relatively impressive rally or rebound from sub-1.2850 levels vs the Usd and 0.8740+ vs the Eur to be precise hope if not great expectation that a Brexit deal can secured before deadline day tomorrow. The Pound&rsquo;s latest recovery has not been smooth or consistent given another barrage of contradictory headlines and reports, typified by UK Cabinet Secretary Lidington saying an accord is possible within 24-48 hours vs EU officials not envisaging an agreement this week. However, both sides maintain that talks lasting long into the night are productive and even the sceptical DUP acknowledges that a compromise is getting closer. In terms of flows and specific price moves, Cable held above Monday&rsquo;s 1.2828 lows in early EU trade and also derived some encouragement from decent UK wage data, but again it was far from plain-sailing or one-way traffic until 1.2900 was reclaimed convincingly and then 1.2950 on the way to a few stops through yesterday&rsquo;s 1.2965 high and a circa 1.2980 peak. Meanwhile, momentum sellers were reported around 0.8690 in Eur/Gbp following a break of 0.8700 and some underlying bids around 0.8680.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/EUR/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best majors and beneficiaries of a general pull-back in the Greenback, with the antipodean Dollars also drawing support from some tentative signs of mediation between the US and China on trade, with the Kiwi and Aud revisiting 0.6750 and 0.7200+ respectively and the latter just in time or around the NY cut when almost 2bn expiries at the 0.7200 strike rolled off. Meanwhile, the single currency bounced pretty firmly off new 2018 lows vs the Usd not far from big option barriers at 1.1200 and in part on the coat-tails of the Gbp even though Italian budget issues continue to weigh approaching the deadline of EU resubmission of the 2019 fiscal draft. Eur/Usd reached 1.1280 and largely shrugged off Economy Minister Tria&rsquo;s comments that implied no shaving of the GDP forecast for next year, but perhaps some compensation via an upgraded privatisation programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional safe-havens both pared losses as the Usd and DXY retreated (index to 97.229 vs 97.665 at one stage) with the Franc back above 1.0100 and Jpy through 114.00 again &ndash; Chf not really reacting to more benign Swiss price data via producer and import metrics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie lost further ground vs its US counterpart as crude prices continues to capitulate and slide deeper into bear market territory, with the negative streak all set to extend to 12 consecutive sessions. Moreover, the Cad and MXN (latter down through 20.5000) were also ruffled by doubts about the USMCA getting US Congressional approval, with Usd/Cad up at 1.3250+ and multi-month highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Norwegian Krona also underperformed vs the Eur and its SEK peer in wake of a miss in mainland Norwegian GDP, with Eur/Nok up near 9.5700 vs Eur/Sek slipping towards 10.2100.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.8%) and Nikkei 225 (-2.1%) weakened from the open with the tech sector the underperformer in the region as another Apple supplier Japan Display reported a loss for H1 and downgraded its outlook. Furthermore, Japanese exporters suffered from recent flows into the JPY and large automakers were pressured after the US Commerce Department submitted a draft recommendation on potential auto tariffs to the White House. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) and Hang Seng (+0.6%) both opened lower although gradually recovered amid hopes for an improvement in US-China trade relations amid reports that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by phone on Friday about a deal that could ease trade tensions and with some US officials reportedly expecting China to make a trade offer ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially supported as the broad risk averse tone spurred a flight to safety, but then failed to hold on to the marginal gains as prices mirrored a pullback in T-notes despite stronger 30yr auction results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Reports also noted that China officials do not expect to resolve the trade dispute at G20 but are instead hoping for a broad framework deal, while some US officials expect China to make a trade offer ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting and USTR Lighthizer is said to want tariffs to continue to force China into concessions.

Furthermore, there were reports that UK PM May had rejected the latest draft Brexit deal with the EU as it didn&rsquo;t provide a clear exit from the customs union if the EU began acting in bad faith in discussions regarding a future trade agreement.

Babcock (-2.5%) are under scrutiny from the Ministry of Defence over their handling of a contract relating to the UK&rsquo;s Trident Submarines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G10 - An almost clear and defining line between the &lsquo;so called&rsquo; risk or high beta/yield currencies vs safer-havens, as US-China trade tensions ease somewhat amidst reports of constructive discussions between key officials, while the YUAN also pares some losses with the aid of intervention via local banks overnight (said to have been defending 6.9700 vs the Usd).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, the DXY and broad Dollar are off Monday&rsquo;s peaks, with the latter only maintaining gains/positive momentum vs the JPY above 114.00 and CHF (to a lesser degree) over 1.0100. However, the index remains underpinned around the 97.500 mark and still poised to build on yesterday&rsquo;s new ytd high at 97.704 given high levels of ongoing uncertainty and global risks, with only one major chart hurdle seen ahead of 98.000 (97.871 Fib resistance).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - Outperforming on the aforementioned US-China &lsquo;understanding&rsquo;, with the Kiwi staying within striking distance of 0.6750 and the latter not far from 0.7200, but perhaps capped by mega option expiry interest at the strike (1.6 bn), while still feeling the adverse effects of bearish cross-positioning as Aud/Nzd inches further below 1.0700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR/CAD - All holding up relatively well, or at least consolidating off worst levels, with the Pound retesting 1.2900 vs the Greenback and 0.8700 vs the single currency on hopes if not high expectations of a Brexit breakthrough in time before tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline. Note, some independent support from Sterling via firm UK wage data, but limited. The Eur is just keeping its head above 1.1200 vs the Usd awaiting Italy&rsquo;s budget resubmission to the EU that is widely expected to reveal a concession or compromise, but no white flag. Option barriers at the big figure are underpinning the headline pair, though by the same token 1 bn expiry interest at 1.1250 are also keeping upside attempts in check. Looking at the Loonie, only fleeting intraday recoveries in oil prices are keeping the commodity unit pressured and it is struggling to stem losses beyond 1.3250.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.1%) is marginally up after reaching 16-month highs yesterday. Of note, traders are gathering in Shanghai for Asia Copper Week, as copper prices have fallen by approximately 17% this year, on track for their worst year since 2015. Intra-day, copper and other metals have moved higher following reports that Liu He, China&rsquo;s top trade negotiator, may visit Washington in preparation for Trump Xi talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-2.2%) and Brent (-2.1%) are in the red after a failed intervention by US President Trump who tweeted that oil prices should be lower, and he hopes Saudi and OPEC do not cut oil production. Note, the monthly OPEC report to be published today at 1115GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC monthly report: OPEC crude production rose 127k bpd in October to average 32.9mln bpd, according to secondary sources. Crude oil output increased mostly in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Libya and Angola, while production declined in IR Iran, Venezuela, Kuwait and Nigeria. In 2018, oil demand growth is anticipated to increase by 1.5mln bpd, a downward revision of 40k bpd from last month&rsquo;s projection. For 2019, world oil demand is forecast to grow by 1.29mln bpd, a minor downward adjustment of 70k bpd from the previous month&rsquo;s assessment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-OPEC oil supply in 2018 is expected to grow by 2.31mln bpd, an upward revision of 90k bpd. Non-OPEC oil supply in 2019 is forecast to grow by 2.23mln bpd, a minor upward revision of 120k bpd</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inverse correlations with Italian BTPs are never too far from the surface it seems, and certainly a dynamic that persists while debt markets await the next exchanges between Italy and the EU on 2019 budget divergences. Hence, a further downturn in the 10 year benchmark to just below 121.00 amidst rather tepid auction results, for obvious reasons, has helped Bunds rebound to a new Eurex high, at 160.39, +10 ticks vs -26 ticks at one stage, while Gilts continue to lag on Brexit deal aspirations, albeit paring losses to 9 ticks vs 36 ticks at best, and US Treasuries shadow moves elsewhere ahead of the return of cash participants after Monday&rsquo;s Veterans Day holiday &ndash; futures off worst levels seen overnight, but curve still fractionally steeper.</p>\r\n",

Rome resubmission and OPEC report ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All major European indices are in the green, with the DAX (+0.6%) out in front, led by the likes of Lufthansa (+2.4%) who are benefiting from lower oil prices and Bayer (+0.3%) who presented an increase in earnings and confirmed their outlook. FTSE MIB (-0.3%) is lagging its peers weighed on by Telecom Italia (-1.4%) who removed their CEO to the dismay of Vivendi (23.9% shareholder). Italian financial names are also softer&nbsp;ahead of today&rsquo;s budget re-submission deadline. Sectors are predominantly higher with outperformance in Telecoms post-earnings from Vodafone (+9.0%). Energy names lag, in-fitting with price action in the complex.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding individual equities, BTG (+9.2%) are leading the Euro Stoxx 600 after presenting an increase in half year revenue and operating profit. Elior Group (+8.0%) are off best levels but remain supported by news that they have hired advisors to initiate the sale of their catering business. Babcock (-2.5%) are under scrutiny from the Ministry of Defence over their handling of a contract relating to the UK&rsquo;s Trident Submarines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G10 - An almost clear and defining line between the &lsquo;so called&rsquo; risk or high beta/yield currencies vs safer-havens, as US-China trade tensions ease somewhat amidst reports of constructive discussions between key officials, while the YUAN also pares some losses with the aid of intervention via local banks overnight (said to have been defending 6.9700 vs the Usd).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, the DXY and broad Dollar are off Monday&rsquo;s peaks, with the latter only maintaining gains/positive momentum vs the JPY above 114.00 and CHF (to a lesser degree) over 1.0100. However, the index remains underpinned around the 97.500 mark and still poised to build on yesterday&rsquo;s new ytd high at 97.704 given high levels of ongoing uncertainty and global risks, with only one major chart hurdle seen ahead of 98.000 (97.871 Fib resistance).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - Outperforming on the aforementioned US-China &lsquo;understanding&rsquo;, with the Kiwi staying within striking distance of 0.6750 and the latter not far from 0.7200, but perhaps capped by mega option expiry interest at the strike (1.6 bn), while still feeling the adverse effects of bearish cross-positioning as Aud/Nzd inches further below 1.0700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR/CAD - All holding up relatively well, or at least consolidating off worst levels, with the Pound retesting 1.2900 vs the Greenback and 0.8700 vs the single currency on hopes if not high expectations of a Brexit breakthrough in time before tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline. Note, some independent support from Sterling via firm UK wage data, but limited. The Eur is just keeping its head above 1.1200 vs the Usd awaiting Italy&rsquo;s budget resubmission to the EU that is widely expected to reveal a concession or compromise, but no white flag. Option barriers at the big figure are underpinning the headline pair, though by the same token 1 bn expiry interest at 1.1250 are also keeping upside attempts in check. Looking at the Loonie, only fleeting intraday recoveries in oil prices are keeping the commodity unit pressured and it is struggling to stem losses beyond 1.3250.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inverse correlations with Italian BTPs are never too far from the surface it seems, and certainly a dynamic that persists while debt markets await the next exchanges between Italy and the EU on 2019 budget divergences. Hence, a further downturn in the 10 year benchmark to just below 121.00 amidst rather tepid auction results, for obvious reasons, has helped Bunds rebound to a new Eurex high, at 160.39, +10 ticks vs -26 ticks at one stage, while Gilts continue to lag on Brexit deal aspirations, albeit paring losses to 9 ticks vs 36 ticks at best, and US Treasuries shadow moves elsewhere ahead of the return of cash participants after Monday&rsquo;s Veterans Day holiday &ndash; futures off worst levels seen overnight, but curve still fractionally steeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.1%) is marginally up after reaching 16-month highs yesterday. Of note, traders are gathering in Shanghai for Asia Copper Week, as copper prices have fallen by approximately 17% this year, on track for their worst year since 2015. Intra-day, copper and other metals have moved higher following reports that Liu He, China&rsquo;s top trade negotiator, may visit Washington in preparation for Trump Xi talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-2.2%) and Brent (-2.1%) are in the red after a failed intervention by US President Trump who tweeted that oil prices should be lower, and he hopes Saudi and OPEC do not cut oil production. Note, the monthly OPEC report to be published today at 1115GMT.</p>\r\n",

However, some of the selling appears pre-emptive, or maybe presumptive is more apt, on the premise that a Brexit breakthrough and solution to the Irish back-stop can be forged before Wednesday&rsquo;s deadline. Indeed, the Short Sterling strip has flipped from a firmer stance off the open to trade as much as 3 ticks below parity, as attention turns to domestic data and the latest labour report, at least momentarily.</p>\r\n",

The timing is particularly pertinent as heavy BTP issuance is due, and Italian debt futures are conceding some ground in the run up having attempted to probe above parity at one stage (within a 121.72-41 range vs their 121.61 previous settlement). However, amidst a broader upturn in risk sentiment on the back of some conciliatory noises from China and the US with regard to trade, Bunds have slipped back to a marginal new 160.10 base. Also scheduled today, Eur4 bn Schatz supply, ZEW&rsquo;s October survey that may well highlight further growth pangs for Germany and the wider Eurozone economy, and a raft of ECB speakers on top of Praet.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-2.2%) weakened from the open with the tech sector the underperformer in the region as another Apple supplier Japan Display reported a loss for H1 and downgraded its outlook. Furthermore, Japanese exporters suffered from recent flows into the JPY and large automakers were pressured after the US Commerce Department submitted a draft recommendation on potential auto tariffs to the White House. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) both opened lower although mainland stocks gradually recovered amid hopes for an improvement in US-China trade relations amid reports that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by phone on Friday about a deal that could ease trade tensions and with some US officials reportedly expecting China to make a trade offer ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting.

Reports also noted that China officials do not expect to resolve the trade dispute at G20 but are instead hoping for a broad framework deal, while some US officials expect China to make a trade offer ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting and USTR Lighthizer is said to want tariffs to continue to force China into concessions. (WSJ) In related news, China Vice Premier Liu He is to visit the US to pave the way for the Xi-Trump meeting. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Premier Li said China&#39;s economy faces fresh challenges and is slowing down but long-term fundamentals are good.

Furthermore, there were reports that UK PM May had rejected the latest draft Brexit deal with the EU as it didn&rsquo;t provide a clear exit from the customs union if the EU began acting in bad faith in discussions regarding a future trade agreement. (Newswires/The Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior ministers led by UK Brexit Secretary Raab told UK PM May no deal is preferable to the current offer from the EU and that the current deal will not get through Parliament.

(Il Sole)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD held on to most the prior day&rsquo;s gains although has pulled back from 17-month highs, which provided EUR/USD and GBP/USD some much needed reprieve below the 1.1300 and 1.2900 handles respectively. Elsewhere, JPY-crosses were initially pressured as the risk averse tone continued to spur flows into the safe-haven JPY and commodity-linked currencies began the session subdued following the 11th consecutive drop in oil prices. However, currencies then staged an intraday comeback amid some encouraging trade-related reports and as CNY strengthened on suspected intervention with major state-owned banks seen to have been selling USD against CNY in the onshore spot market at around 6.9700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed with WTI crude futures subdued after prices dropped over 2% to briefly below USD 59.00/bbl in the prior session on further Trump jawboning, which was its 11th consecutive loss and longest losing streak on record. Elsewhere, gold and copper prices nursed losses as the USD pulled back from 17-month highs and with the red metal also underpinned by outperformance in its largest consumer amid US-China trade-related hopes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted &quot;Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!&quot;. (Twitter)<br /><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Treasury futures were thin, with cash markets closed for Veteran&rsquo;s Day, leaving the complex to trade off broader risk themes. With the risk-off tone begotten by a stronger USD, weighing on equities, and seeing the VIX rise above 20, the mood was defensive, and as such, Treasuries rose. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 8+ ticks higher at 118-12+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Department submitted a draft recommendation on potential auto tariffs to the White House which are undergoing interagency review and are sign of US administration&#39;s increasing frustration at EU and Japan over lack of progress on auto trade issues, while the Section 232 recommendations will be discussed at White House trade meeting on Tuesday. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Daly (Voter) said she will not be surprised by a December hike and sees at least a couple of hikes in 2019, while she added that the &quot;modal&quot; forecast is for 2-3 hikes over the next period of time and that she is thinking seriously about December rate hike but not definite. Daly also commented that the Fed should head towards neutral and that neutral is uncertain so doesn&#39;t see it as a stopping point. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The major Asian equity markets mostly followed suit to the sell-off on Wall St where tech led the declines after Apple shares dropped 5% following an outlook cut by supplier Lumentum Holdings and with energy names hit again after oil posted an 11th consecutive decline. ASX 200 (-1.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-2.2%) weakened from the open with the tech sector the underperformer in the region as another Apple supplier Japan Display reported a loss for H1 and downgraded its outlook. Furthermore, Japanese exporters suffered from recent flows into the JPY and large automakers were pressured after the US Commerce Department submitted a draft recommendation on potential auto tariffs to the White House. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) both opened lower although mainland stocks gradually recovered amid hopes for an improvement in US-China trade relations amid reports that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by phone on Friday about a deal that could ease trade tensions and with some US officials reportedly expecting China to make a trade offer ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially supported as the broad risk averse tone spurred a flight to safety, but then failed to hold on to the marginal gains as prices mirrored a pullback in T-notes despite stronger 30yr auction results.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-3.1%) weakened from the open with the tech sector also underperforming in the region as another Apple supplier Japan Display reported a loss for H1 and downgraded its outlook. Furthermore, Japanese exporters suffered from recent flows into the JPY and large automakers were pressured after the US Commerce Department submitted a draft recommendation on potential auto tariffs to the White House. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (-1.5%) are also lower, but with losses in the mainland stemmed amid hopes for an improvement in US-China trade relations as reports noted that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by phone on Friday about a deal that could ease trade tensions and with some US officials reportedly expecting China to make a trade offer ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD remains firm to hold on to most the prior day&rsquo;s gains in which the DXY hit a 17-month high and although its major counterparts attempt to nurses, the recovery has been minimal with EUR/USD and GBP/USD firmly below the 1.1300 and 1.2900 handles respectively. JPY-crosses are pressured as the risk averse tone spurs flows into the safe-haven JPY although declines in USD/JPY have been contained by the outperformance of the greenback. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies are subdued following the 11th consecutive drop in oil prices, but with antipodeans off sessions lows as CNY pares some of its losses on suspected intervention with major state-owned banks seen to have been selling USD against CNY in the onshore spot market at around 6.9700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher with prices mildly supported as the risk averse tone spurs a flight to safety, but with upside also capped ahead of a 30yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
