        "content": "<p>The BoJ are to release the minutes from the January meeting, where the central bank kept monetary policy unchanged as expected, with NIRP held at -0.10% and the 10yr yield target maintained at around 0%. The decision on YCC was made by 8-1 vote with Kataoka the dissenter again, while the bank maintained all its median forecasts for Real GDP and Core CPI in its Outlook Report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the meeting, the BoJ commented that inflation is likely to continue increasing to 2% target, but risks to prices tilted to the downside and that it viewed Japan&rsquo;s economy to expand moderately, while it also extended the deadline for loan program by 1yr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Summary of Opinions for that meeting stated BoJ must continue with powerful easing policy as inflation remains weak, while it added that Japan&#39;s economy is expanding moderately and is likely to continue expanding on the back of highly accommodative financial conditions and government past stimulus measures. Furthermore, there were opinions that BoJ must look at effects and costs of BoJ&#39;s ETF and risky asset purchases, that the banks needs to show strong stance of hitting 2% target, and that there may be a chance for BoJ to consider adjusting level of yield targets if economy and prices continue improving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the market reaction to the actual meeting, USD/JPY saw minor weakness on the announcement amid disappointment as expectations of an upgrade to growth forecasts failed to materialize, and as markets focused on a slight tweak in the language in which the BoJ stated inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged vs. Prev. statement that inflation expectations were weakening. However, today&rsquo;s release is not expected to impact markets much considering that a more recent meeting was held last week.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump administration is looking to impose tariffs of USD 60bln on Chinese goods which would target tech and telecom products, according to sources. (Newswires) This followed earlier reports that US was eyeing Tariffs to punish China for intellectual property infringements and that US Trade Representative Lighthizer offered US President Trump a USD 30bln package to tariffs on Chinese imports, but Trump said to aim for a higher number. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Finance minister Hammond said he expects an important step forward on Brexit at the European council next week. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OBR raised 2018 UK growth forecast by 0.1ppts to 1.5%, while 2019 growth forecast was unchanged at 1.3% and 2020 was unchanged at 1.3%. OBR also expects UK inflation is expected to fall back to 2% target over next year and believes that the settlement for UK on Brexit would cost GBP 37.1bln with 75% falling due within 5-year forecast period. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;S Lane said there is no concern on the current level of EUR. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX<a name=\"_Hlk503148913\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148890\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148850\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD: The air was thin for the DXY above 90.000. The buck was hit after CPI data failed to convince traders that the US was on the cusp of an inflation spike, and accordingly, the Fed might not be inclined to pencil in a fourth hike in 2018. The data fit into the &#39;goldilocks&#39; description, subsequently equities rallied as the buck eased. News of US Sec of State Tillerson&#39;s firing soured risk sentiment, adding to the buck&#39;s woes, with DXY crashing through 89.7 level, though trades slightly above that level heading into Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP: No big surprises in Spring Statement; the OBR forecast continuing improvement in the labour market, and sees real wages rising eventually, though it only sees inflation returning to target in 2019. Part of GBP&#39;s rise today was of course attributed to the USD weakness, which helped cable rise to within reaching distance of 1.40, though couldn&#39;t test the level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD: Dovish comments from BOC Gov Poloz helped USDCAD rally. Poloz generally toed the BOC line, but emphasised untapped potential in the Canadian economy where growth could occur without stoking inflation. USDCAD jumped through 1.29 to highs around 1.2977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR: Early boost on possible exemptions of Euro countries on tariffs. Comments from ECB&rsquo;s Lane about no concerns over the level of EUR saw the single currency test the 1.2350 level, which was broken later in trading on US CPI data due to a Dollar sell-off. In later trade, the 1.24 handle was breached again, and EUR seems to be consolidating around that level as we head into APAC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY: The yen was a beneficiary of dollar weakness, and USDJPY gains above 107.00 could not be held amid the weaker risk sentiment, after Tillerson was fired. The macro backdrop turned negative, with equities and oil sliding, helping JPY and CHF to catch a bid. JPY once again is eyeing the 106.20 level, according to technicians, though we linger around the 106.50 mark heading into Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoC&rsquo;s Poloz said cannot take mechanical approach to policy even though interest rates are likely to move higher over time, while he added that uncertain processes entail upside and downside risks to inflation. Poloz also reiterated plan is to remain cautious in considering future adjustments to policy guided by data.

The risk-off saw the front-month spreads move into contango, which added more bearish impetus. There was additional downside pressure after news from Libya&rsquo;s Zawiya oil port, where a deal was struck with workers, preventing further strike action. After the bell today, API reports weekly inventories. The Street expects a Crude build +1.5 Mln, Cushing build +320k, gasoline draw -2.1mln, distillates draw -1.4mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (Mar 9) 1.156M vs. Exp. 1.500M (Prev. 5.661M).

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US CPI (Feb) Y/Y 2.2% vs. Exp. 2.2% (Prev. 2.1%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Real Weekly Earnings (Feb) M/M 0.3% vs. Exp. 0.3% (Prev. -0.8%, Rev. -0.6%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a Goldilocks CPI report, which came in line with expectations, and does little to support the notion that the Fed will aggressively revise higher its dots, the SPX made a run for the 2800 level. Even though it managed to cross that level, holding gains later proved difficult and the index slid lower amid the risk-off environment catalysed after US Sec of State Tillersons&rsquo; dismissal. SPX -0.64% at 2765, DJI -0.68% at 2506, NDX -1.19% at 7047.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the distinctly risk-off tone, once again Treasury action wasn&rsquo;t as stark as other havens, even though volume in the June contract was pretty healthy. The curve bull-flattened with the long-end yields c.3bps lower while shorted-dated yields rallied by 1bps. The US treasury sold USD 13bln of 30yr bonds at high yield of 3.109% softer cover than recent averages (2.38x vs 2.41x over the last six), with uninspiring internals (smallest indirect participation since November 2016, while directs took the largest share since October 2015). US 10-year T-note futures (June 2018) settled 4 ticks higher at 120.10+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li>SNAPSHOT: Equities down; USD down; GBP up; Treasuries flat; Oil down</li>\r\n  <li>REAR VIEW: Tillerson Dismissed; Spring Statement uneventful</li>\r\n  <li>AHEAD: US PPI; ECB conference, DoE Inventories</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.64% at 2765, DJI -0.68% at 2506, NDX -1.19% at 7047</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SECTORS: CONS DISC (XLY): -0.69%, CONS STAP (XLP): -0.01%, ENERGY (XLE): -0.72%, FINANCIALS (XLF): -1.09%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +0.15%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): -0.54%, MATERIALS (XLB): -0.41%, TECH (XLK): -1.21%, TELECOMS (XTL): -0.17%, UTILITIES (XLU): +0.21%</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* After a Goldilocks CPI report, which came in line with expectations, and does little to support the notion that the Fed will aggressively revise higher its dots, the SPX made a run for the 2800 level. Even though it managed to cross that level, holding gains proved difficult, seeing the index slide lower. The slide was given impetus by the risk-off environment catalysed after US Sec of State Tillersons&rsquo; dismissal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>USD</strong>: The air was thin for the DXY above 90.000. The buck was hit after CPI data failed to convince traders that the US was on the cusp of an inflation spike, and accordingly, the Fed might not be inclined to pencil in a fourth hike in 2018. The data fit into the &#39;goldilocks&#39; description, subsequently equities rallied as the buck eased. News of US Sec of State Tillerson&#39;s firing soured risk sentiment, adding to the buck&#39;s woes, with DXY crashing through 89.7 level, though trades slightly above that level heading into Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>GBP</strong>: No big surprises in Spring Statement; the OBR forecast continuing improvement in the labour market, and sees real wages rising eventually, though it only sees inflation returning to target in 2019. Part of GBP&#39;s rise today was of course attributed to the USD weakness, which helped cable rise to within reaching distance of 1.40, though couldn&#39;t test the level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CAD</strong>: Dovish comments from BOC Gov Poloz helped USDCAD rally. Poloz generally toed the BOC line, but emphasised untapped potential in the Canadian economy where growth could occur without stoking inflation. USDCAD jumped through 1.29 to highs around 1.2977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>EUR</strong>: Early boost on possible exemptions of Euro countries on tariffs. Comments from ECB&rsquo;s Lane about no concerns over the level of EUR saw the single currency test the 1.2350 level, which was broken later in trading on US CPI data due to a Dollar sell-off. In later trade, the 1.24 handle was breached again, and EUR seems to be consolidating around that level as we head into APAC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>JPY</strong>: The yen was a beneficiary of dollar weakness, and USDJPY gains above 107.00 could not be held amid the weaker risk sentiment, after Tillerson was fired. The macro backdrop turned negative, with equities and oil sliding, helping JPY and CHF to catch a bid. JPY once again is eyeing the 106.20 level, according to technicians, though we linger around the 106.50 mark heading into Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>US 10-YEAR T-NOTE FUTURES (JUNE 2018) SETTLED 4 TICKS HIGHER AT 120.10</strong>+. Despite the distinctly risk-off tone, once again Treasury action wasn&rsquo;t as stark as other havens, even though volume in the June contract was pretty healthy. The curve bull-flattened with the long-end yields c.3bps lower while shorted-dated yields rallied by 1bps. The US treasury sold USD 13bln of 30yr bonds at high yield of 3.109% softer cover than recent averages (2.38x vs 2.41x over the last six), with uninspiring internals (smallest indirect participation since November 2016, while directs took the largest share since October 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>WTI </strong>momentum stalled after a failure to negotiate the $62.00 level, with the slide helped along as risk sentiment turned sour after news US Sec of State Tillerson was sacked by President Trump. The risk-off saw the front-month spreads move into contango, which added more bearish impetus.&nbsp; There was additional downside pressure after news from Libya&rsquo;s Zawiya oil port, where a deal was struck with workers, preventing further strike action. After the bell today, API reports weekly inventories. The Street expects a Crude build +1.5 Mln, Cushing build +320k, gasoline draw -2.1mln, distillates draw -1.4mln.</p>\r\n",

Investment fund takedown was the softest since May, though foreign bidders&nbsp;raised their participation to the most since March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SocGen believes that the current 30-year bond trades rich versus old 30s, and notes that the 5s30s curve has narrowed by more than 9bps since the last auction cycle.

        "content": "<p>An eventful 2<sup>nd</sup> half, but not due to what appeared to be Tuesday&rsquo;s headline data as US CPI metrics matched consensus and hardly budged 2018 Fed rate hike expectations as a result. The UK&rsquo;s Spring Budget did lift the Pound with a modest GDP forecast upgrade from the OBR for this year arguably understating Chancellor Hammond&rsquo;s upbeat economic assessment, but fiscal projections underlining improved revenues and smaller deficits, although the DMO issuance remit was at the upper end of the survey range and above consensus. Cable reclaimed 1.3900+ status and then hit highs around 1.3975 amidst a broad Usd sell-off on news that US President Trump has ousted Secretary of State Tillerson and plans to replace him with CIA chief Pompeo. This also saw Nzd/Usd climb further above 0.7300 and test 0.7350 as macro offers between 0.7340-50 were absorbed before some squaring up and consolidation ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s big NZ&nbsp;data (Q4 GDP). Eur/Usd surpassed 1.2350 and its 30 DMA around 1.2345, but needs to close above for further gains towards 1.2400 and resistance from 1.2405-10 from a technical perspective, while Aud/Usd almost toughed 0.7900 before easing back alongside the Kiwi. Usd/Jpy retreated through 107.00 having traded just over 107.20 resist on all round Jpy selling as stops/buy-orders were triggered in the headline pair and crosses, while Usd/Chf pulled back to sub-0.9450 levels vs 0.9500+ recent peaks. Conversely, Usd/Cad rebounded sharply from around 1.2830 to test offers through 1.2900 and up to 1.2910, but stopped just short of the next supply at 1.2950 as the latest Trump inspired Greenback selling was more than offset by a still cautious BoC Governor Poloz (citing slack in economy and labour market). Still to come, RBA Deputy Governor Kent and BoJ minutes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

HSBC expect this to be cut further to GBP 44bln this time around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growth is expected to be revised marginally higher after GDP growth was higher than expectations in 2017 (1.7% vs. 1.5% expected).

Furthermore, trade across the Asia-Pac region was quiet in which stocks lacked any significant drivers for price action. As such, ASX 200 (-0.4%) was subdued as mining and commodity-related stocks dragged on Australia, while the largest weighted financials sector was also lower as the royal commission began hearings on mortgage fraud. Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) spent most the session in negative territory, but later coat-tailed on a rebound in USD/JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) were choppy with trade indecisive after the PBoC kept its liquidity efforts tepid. Sector-wise, the Hang Seng Telecom Index underperformed following some downward broker moves, while banking names benefitted from proposals to consolidate regulatory agencies and after &lsquo;Big 4&rsquo; AgBank reported preliminary earnings as well as a private placement to raise as much as USD 15.8bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs lack demand and retreated below the 151.00 level amid a late recovery in Japanese stocks and following mixed 5yr auction results which attracted reduced interest than prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 30bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 30bln via 28-day reverse repos. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3218 (Prev. 6.3333)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkish military says its troops, Syrian opposition fighters begin siege of Syrian Kurdish-held city. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian military says that in the event of US missile strikes in Syria, the Russian military would respond. (RIA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Lane says no concern over EUR level and ECB must judge implications of any EUR volatility. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equity open followed the mixed sentiment seen in Asia as investors focus on the pending US inflation data. Sectors are mixed with energy among the outperformers as oil prices recover from yesterday&rsquo;s losses, despite the rise in US crude output whilst sector heavyweight Total (+1.4%) at the top of the CAC 40 following an upgrade at Barclays. Likewise, BP (+0.9%) and Royal Dutch Shell (+0.6%) are moving in sympathy. Telecom sector is underperforming after France&rsquo;s Iliad (-5.7%) slumped after the company FY 2017 results miss forecast, whilst Mediaset (-3.1%) is at the foot of the FTSE MIB following a downgrade at JP Morgan. Elsewhere, German utilities company E.ON (+5.7%) is again performing strong amid reports of the company expecting as many as 5000 job cuts and EUR 600mln to EUR 800mln of synergies as part of its asset swaps with RWE (+1.3%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY is still straddling 90.000, with the Usd largely rangebound vs G10 majors aside from the Jpy and Nzd that have broken out of Monday&rsquo;s narrow bands in opposite directions. Usd/Jpy saw importer demand in the low 106.20 area and then short covering from leveraged accounts on the way up towards offers at 106.90 before eclipsing yesterday&rsquo;s peak and retesting highs just over 107.00 seen after Friday&rsquo;s NFP release. Follow through buying pushed the pair up to and just over nearest resistance around 107.20. Conversely, the Kiwi is looking to consolidate and build on gains above 0.7300 with the aid of some upbeat minor NZ data overnight (land prices), and ahead of tonight&rsquo;s top tier Q4 GDP and current account updates. Aud/Usd continues to encounter resistance/offers in advance of 0.7900, and will look for further direction from RBA Assistant Governor Kent later. Eur/Usd remains in a tight band above 1.2300, and with a key Fib still limiting dips below the handle (1.2266), while the 30 DMA (1.2350) provides a near term cap. Cable is sticking close to the 1.3900 handle awaiting the UK Budget and any further Brexit news after some positive reports about transition implementation on Monday, while Usd/Cad is slightly firmer above 1.2850 after comments from Canada&rsquo;s PM claiming that exemptions of US import tariffs are not contingent on NAFTA negotiations. Note, BoC Governor Poloz is due to speak this afternoon, and staying with Central Banks the January BoJ minutes will be released shortly before midnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts have extended pre-UK Budget gains to 20 ticks at a fresh 121.43 Liffe high, but not their advantage over Bunds as the core Eurozone debt future plays catch-up and a bit more on the back of stops once yesterday&rsquo;s Eurex intraday high was breached. The 10 year benchmark just topped out at 157.49 (+22 ticks), but next on the radar could be the March to date peak at 157.69. Not seeing much in the way of fundamental drivers for the latest upturn in bonds, but perhaps some spread positioning as US Treasuries remain nearer the lows of the overnight session, ahead of CPI data and more bill/long end issuance. This does not really resemble a risk-on or FTQ move given Jpy weakness in FX and firmer EU stocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices are taking a breather, with WTI and Brent trading with marginal gains, the latter back above USD 65/bbl from the sell-off seen yesterday fuelled by a Genscape build in stockpiles and the relentless rise in US Crude output reported by EIA. US April shale output is expected to hit record highs at 6.95mln bpd. In the metals complex, Iron ore continued the longest stretch of losses since 2016 whereas gold prices are creeping lower awaiting the US CPI data to gauge the outlook for inflation.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "EU mid-session: Mixed sentiment in Europe as focus falls on US Inflation data",
        "content": "<p><strong>Equities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equity open followed the mixed sentiment seen in Asia as investors focus on the pending US inflation data. Sectors are mixed with energy among the outperformers as oil prices recover from yesterday&rsquo;s losses, despite the rise in US crude output whilst sector heavyweight Total (+1.4%) at the top of the CAC 40 following an upgrade at Barclays. Likewise, BP (+0.9%) and Royal Dutch Shell (+0.6%) are moving in sympathy. Telecom sector is underperforming after France&rsquo;s Iliad (-5.7%) slumped after the company FY 2017 results miss forecast, whilst Mediatset (-3.1%) is at the foot of the FTSE MIB following a downgrade at JP Morgan. Elsewhere, German utilities company E.ON (+5.7%) is again performing strong amid reports of the company expecting as many as 5000 job cuts and EUR 600mln to EUR 800mln of synergies as part of its asset swaps with RWE (+1.3%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY is still straddling 90.000, with the Usd largely rangebound vs G10 majors aside from the Jpy and Nzd that have broken out of Monday&rsquo;s narrow bands in opposite directions. Usd/Jpy saw importer demand in the low 106.20 area and then short covering from leveraged accounts on the way up towards offers at 106.90 before eclipsing yesterday&rsquo;s peak and retesting highs just over 107.00 seen after Friday&rsquo;s NFP release. Follow through buying pushed the pair up to and just over nearest resistance around 107.20. Conversely, the Kiwi is looking to consolidate and build on gains above 0.7300 with the aid of some upbeat minor NZ data overnight, and ahead of tonight&rsquo;s top tier Q4 GDP and current account updates. Aud/Usd continues to encounter resistance/offers in advance of 0.7900, and will look for further direction from RBA Assistant Governor Kent later. Eur/Usd remains in a tight band above 1.2300, and with a key Fib still limiting dips below the handle (1.2266), while the 30 DMA (1.2350) provides a near term cap. Cable is sticking close to the 1.3900 handle awaiting the UK Budget and any further Brexit news after some positive reports about transition implementation on Monday, while Usd/Cad is slightly firmer above 1.2850 after comments from Canada&rsquo;s PM claiming that exemptions of US import tariffs are not contingent on NAFTA negotiations. Note, BoC Governor Poloz is due to speak this afternoon, and staying with Central Banks the January BoJ minutes will be released shortly before midnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fixed Income</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts have extended pre-UK Budget gains to 20 ticks at a fresh 121.43 Liffe high, but not their advantage over Bunds as the core Eurozone debt future plays catch-up and a bit more on the back of stops once yesterday&rsquo;s Eurex intraday high was breached. The 10 year benchmark just topped out at 157.49 (+22 ticks), but next on the radar could be the March to date peak at 157.69. Not seeing much in the way of fundamental drivers for the latest upturn in bonds, but perhaps some spread positioning as US Treasuries remain nearer the lows of the overnight session, ahead of CPI data and more bill/long end issuance. This does not really resemble a risk-on or FTQ move given Jpy weakness in FX and firmer EU stocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Commodities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices are taking a breather, with WTI and Brent trading with marginal gains, the latter back above USD 65/bbl from the sell-off seen yesterday fuelled by a Genscape build in stockpiles and the relentless rise in US Crude output reported by EIA. US April shale output is expected to hit record highs at 6.95mln bpd. In the metals complex, Iron ore continued the longest stretch of losses since 2016 whereas gold prices are creeping lower awaiting the US CPI data to gauge the outlook for inflation.</p>\r\n",

Conversely, the Kiwi is looking to consolidate and build on gains above 0.7300 with the aid of some upbeat minor NZ data overnight,&nbsp;and ahead of tonight&rsquo;s top tier Q4 GDP and current account updates. Aud/Usd continues to encounter resistance/offers in advance of 0.7900, and will look for further direction from RBA Assistant Governor Kent later. Eur/Usd remains in a tight band above 1.2300, and with a key Fib still limiting dips below the handle (1.2266), while the 30 DMA (1.2350) provides a near term cap. Cable is sticking close to the 1.3900 handle awaiting the UK Budget and any further Brexit news after some positive reports about transition implementation on Monday, while Usd/Cad is slightly firmer above 1.2850 after comments from Canada&rsquo;s PM claiming that exemptions of US import tariffs are not contingent on NAFTA negotiations. Note, BoC Governor Poloz is due to speak this afternoon, and staying with Central Banks the January BoJ minutes will be released shortly before midnight.</p>\r\n",

Investment fund takedown was the softest since May, though foreign bidders&nbsp;raised their participation to the most since March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SocGen believes that the current 30-year bond trades rich versus old 30s, and notes that the 5s30s curve has narrowed by more than 9bps since the last auction cycle. The bank argues that the sector lacks set-up ahead of the auction from a RV perspective, while the higher re-opening size is a negative also. That said, cheaper outright levels of the 30-year may provide support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recent auction history:</strong><br />- High yield: (prev. 3.121% % vs six-auction average of 2.876%)<br />- Tail: (prev. 1.2bps tail vs six-auction average of 0.2bps stop-through)<br />- Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.26x vs six-auction average of 2.41x)<br />- Dealers: (prev. 30.8% vs six-auction average of 29.0%)<br />- Directs: (prev. 8.1% vs six-auction average of 8.0%)<br />- Indirects: (prev. 61.2% vs six-auction average of 63%)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are subdued following an uninspiring tone on Wall St where S&amp;P 500 and DJIA finished negative as Trump tariff overhang weighed heavily on industrials, while the Nasdaq outperformed to post a 7<sup>th</sup> consecutive gain and fresh record high amid tech resilience. Furthermore, trade across the Asia-Pac region was quiet with stocks lacking any significant drivers for price action. As such, ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) are subdued with mining and commodity-related stocks dragging on Australia, while the largest weighted financials sector is also downbeat as the royal commission begins hearings on mortgage fraud. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are choppy with trade indecisive as the PBoC kept its liquidity efforts tepid. In terms of sectors, Hang Seng Telecom Index underperforms following some downward broker moves, while banking names benefit from proposals to consolidate regulatory agencies and after &lsquo;Big 4&rsquo; AgBank reported preliminary earnings as well as a private placement to raise as much as USD 15.8bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is little changed overnight with the DXY below 90.00 as ongoing trade war concerns restrict price action, while EUR/USD and GBP/USD are also flat with the latter stuck around the 1.3900 level. Elsewhere, AUD is range-bound amid mixed data releases and NZD/USD outperforms after reclaiming the 0.7300 handle, while JPY trades mixed although the safe-haven has held on to most of the gains seen following the resurfacing of the government land-sale scandal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid an indecisive tone across riskier assets and with participants side-lined ahead of today&rsquo;s 5yr auction.</p>\r\n",
