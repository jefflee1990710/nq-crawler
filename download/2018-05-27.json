In the pre-market, ES tested the 2715 area, before ranging between 2715-2725 heading into the long weekend. Sectors were mixed on Friday with energy continuing to post losses greater than 3% on the back of plummeting oil prices driven by potential easing of the oil supply curbs by OPEC+. Materials and industrials also posted losses. On the flip side, consumer cyclicals and non-cyclicals held in positive territory, lifted by retailer names. SPX -0.2% at 2,722, NDX +0.2% at 6,961, DJI -0.2% at 24,751.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields fell across the curve amid continued uncertainty in Europe around the upsurge of the new populist government in Italy, which sent the spread between 10yr Bunds and BTPS above 200bps, and also on the prospect that Spanish PM Rajoy will likely face a confidence vote. Treasuries caught a bid during European hours as safe haven assets drew demand, and stabilised near session highs as investors squared-up their books ahead of the long weekend in the US/UK. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve with 10yr yields higher by c.5bps, the front end of the curve was higher by c.3bps and the long end by c.4bps. 2s5s and 2s10s narrowed by c.2bps whilst 5s30 and 10s30s widened by c.2bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 11+ ticks higher at 119-27+.</p>\r\n",
