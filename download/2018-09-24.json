There was also an opinion that it was time for the BoJ to strengthen commitment to reaching price target due to weak price moves, while there was also an opinion that the BoJ should expand monetary stimulus and adopt forward guidance to spur demand and inflation expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actual decision was interpreted as less hawkish than some had feared and as such USD/JPY rose around 40 pips to 111.30 from 110.90 in the 3 minutes following the announcement, while Nikkei 225 also pared losses and moved into positive territory. However, today&rsquo;s minutes release is not expected to spur any major price moves considering that there has been a more recent meeting last week where the BoJ maintained its policy settings as expected.</p>\r\n",

In addition, fresh US-tariffs took effect from today with 10% US tariffs on USD 200bln worth of Chinese goods and China had previously announced a retaliation of 5-10% tariffs on USD 60bln of US goods. Elsewhere, EU trade commissioner Malmstrom said EU talks with the US are still in an exploratory phase. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Pressure is mounting on PM May to adjust her stance given the fallout of last week&#39;s Salzburg summit with weekend press reports suggesting that a majority of her cabinet are in favour of a Canada-style trade deal; on the matter, a PM May&rsquo;s spokesperson noted such an agreement will not resolve the Northern Ireland border issue. Moreover PM&rsquo;s May team has been working over the weekend on a contingency plan that includes snap elections in November, a proposal backed by Labour leader Corbyn. On the flip side, UK Brexit Minister Raab played down the chances of the government pivoting towards a Canada-style deal as he believes the Chequers plan is the only credible plan for Brexit. Additionally, following today&rsquo;s cabinet meeting, Raab said to have held a healthy discussion on Brexit and he emphasized to be seeking a negotiated deal. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> US Secretary of State Pompeo said to expect US talks with Turkish officials this week for the release of Pastor Brunson. Elsewhere, US President Trump said he had extraordinary talks on trade with South Korea&#39;s Moon. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Progress was made in talks over the deficit target today PM Conte, Interior Minister Salvini, Deputy PM Di Maio and Finance Minister Tria held top level talks. Italy&#39;s League economy adviser says that a 2.5% deficit/GDP ratio would be credible and markets would be calm, adds that an exit from the Euro is out of the question. Italy Deputy PM Salvini said government decree is to cut spending related to migration. PM Conte is seeking a ruling coalition agreement over economic and financial 2019-2021 targets by Tuesday morning.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Draghi said that he sees a &ldquo;vigorous&rdquo; pick-up in underlying inflation, domestic price pressures are strengthening and broadening, and he sees wage growth continuing to pick-up. Draghi added that the realignment of market expectations with those of the governing council was immediate and smooth. On asset prices, Draghi said highyield debt, and in some areas of real estate, valuations are stretched, and the ECB was monitoring financial stability intensively. ECB&#39;s Dolenc said that interest rates will remain low through the summer of 2019 though he can&#39;t comment on when they will change. &nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;<br />* SPX -0.32% at 2919, NDX +0.23% at 7548, DJI -0.68% at 26561.</strong> SECTORS: Energy +1.47%, Materials -1.40%, Industrials -1.32%, Cons Discretionary -0.57%, Cons Staples -1.50%, Healthcare +0.16%, Financials -1.06%, Tech +0.31%, Telecoms +0.21%, Utilities -0.89%.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Alexion (ALXN) was boosted after blockbuster drug Soliris was successful in a late stage study. Abiomed (ABMD) surged on strong performance of Impella heart pumps. Nektar (NKTR) rose after reports that it had expand partnership with BioXcel in possible treatment for pancreatic cancer. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was initiated at RBC, rated outperform, helping shares rise. In M&amp;A, Michael Kors (KORS) was hit on news that it was set to acquire Versace for $2bln. Sirius (SIRI) has agreed a $3.5bln deal to acquire Pandora (P). Comcast (CMCSA) was lower after it on the weekend beat FOXA to acquire SKY LN; the news helped buoy Disney (DIS) shares. Newell Brands (NWL) was lower after news that Sears (SHLD) is nearing bankruptcy. Arconic (ARNC) was lower after a NY Post report suggest that its price tag could scare-off potential bidders. Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was among the better performers on press reports that it could be a target for Johnson and Johnson (JNJ); separately, JNJ talc powder cancer case in California ended in a mistrial. United Technologies (UTX) was said to explore the sale of Chubb Fire &amp; Security for over $3bln. Bain and Elliot are reportedly not partnering on a deal for Athenahealth (ATHN), Dealreporter said. Jewellers (SIG, TIF) were under pressure on news that Amazon (AMZN) was preparing to expand jewellery sales; separately, Snap Inc (SNAP) announced a shopping partnership with Amazon. Elsewhere, energy names were outperforming as Brent prices jumped to a four-year high, as OPEC/OPEC+ refrained from boosting output at the meeting of its monitoring committee over the weekend. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES $1.30 HIGHER AT $72.08/BBL, BRENT (X8) SETTLES &nbsp;$2.40 HIGHER AT $81.20/BBL. </strong>Brent hit fresh four-year highs following the weekend meeting of OPEC&#39;s monitoring committee, as the group refrained from signalling a boost to output. OPEC&#39;s JMMC meeting did not conclude with any agreement to raise output, as was expected, with the Saudis describing OPEC&#39;s current response &quot;satisfactory.&quot; Ministers also agreed that there remains capacity available to lift crude output at a later date, if required (Aramco&#39;s CEO says the oil giant has 1.5mln BPD spare capacity, and stands ready to boost supply); but with Brent above $80/bbl, the market remains sceptical, UBS said, noting that Trafigura and Mercuria have said crude prices could rise above $90/bbl in Q4 -- and perhaps over $100/bbl in early 2019 - because there is no possible near-term supply response to the loss of Iranian oil exports; UBS itself has argued that recent export data paints a more worrying picture of Iran&rsquo;s contribution to global markets, and suggests oil price risk remains skewed to the upside. The terrorist attack in Iran over the weekend did not hit any major energy infrastructure&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;or oil output, but UBS says the incident highlights that supply risk in an already tight market with shrinking spare capacity. Elsewhere, reports suggest that Libyan production is running at the highest clip since July 2015, offsetting some of the supply outages from Venezuela and Iran. From Iraq, southern oil exports are reportedly running close to a record 3.6mln BPD. Analysts at Citi said they agree with the Saudi Energy Minister &quot;that no refiners are actually unable to source barrels at the moment,&quot; adding &quot;the bullish issue is still whether there will be an eventual robust response to future declines in Iranian output as US sanctions on exports take hold.&quot; Meanwhile, BofAML&rsquo;s analysts raised its 2019 Brent forecast by $5/bbl to $80/bbl. &nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;<br />* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 1+ TICKS LOWER AT 118-20. </strong>Treasuries saw modest selling on Monday; in the European afternoon, the TPLEX fell in sympathy with Bunds, which sold-off after ECB President Draghi said he sees a &ldquo;vigorous&rdquo; pick-up in inflation. Yield on 2s and 3s printed fresh decade+ highs. &nbsp;The US sold 2-year paper at a high yield of 2.829%, tailing by 0.4bps &ndash; the largest tail since April. Cover was also soft at &nbsp;2.44x, below recent auction averages. The poor showing may have been a result of the FOMC&rsquo;s anticipated 25bps hike on Wednesday, analysts said. &nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;<br />* US 5-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> The US Treasury will auction USD 93bln in 2s (USD 37bln on Monday), 5s (USD 38bln on Tuesday) and 7s (USD 31bln on Thursday); with USD 13bln maturing at the end of the week. The US will also sell USD 17bln of 2yr FRN this week. This week brings approx. USD 93bln of redemptions and approx. USD 8bln of coupon payments. Monday&rsquo;s 2-year auction saw weak cover, with the Fed expected to lift rates by 25bps on Thursday, and analysts suggest that some of this sentiment may also be on view at the 5-year auction. Analysts at Societe Generale argue that the current 5-year note is trading rich on the spline compared to older 5s, but the sector has seen some cheapening on the curve after hitting its richest levels since last September against 2s and 10s, which SocGen suggests could be a positive for the auction. &ldquo;The recent sell-off has pushed 5-year yields towards the cheapest the sector has been since 2008 and more than 18bps cheaper than the August auction result,&rdquo; and adds that it holds a slightly positive bias going into the auction, though notes the risks of a small tail.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The index has looked vulnerable since the start of Monday&rsquo;s EU session, and only just held above 94.000 until the EUR took flight to challenge the GBP for top spot within the G10 community. The single currency reacted to headlines quoting ECB President Draghi describing the recent rise in underlying inflation as &lsquo;vigorous&rsquo;, and finally overcame Fib resistance at 1.1780 vs the Usd on its way through 1.1815, so far. Technically, some are looking at 1.1801 as pivotal on a closing basis, while the next bullish chart levels are 1.185051. However, Cable is actually still outperforming as Eur/Gbp remains capped ahead of 0.9000 vs other Eur crosses that are testing/breaching big figures on the upside, like Eur/Jpy at 133.00 and Eur/Chf at 1.1300, and latest Brexit commentary alongside Sky&rsquo;s acquisition by Comcast seem to be helping Sterling&rsquo;s revival. Cable rebounded over 100 pips from worst&nbsp;levels (around 1.3055 and close to daily cloud support) at one stage, but faded some way ahead of 1.3200.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> The antipodean Dollars were unable to shake off renewed global trade jitters after China formally declined to resume official talks with the US ahead of the latest batch of import tariffs. Hence, neither derived any traction from bouts of Usd weakness and remained nearer 0.7250 and 0.6650 compared to last week&rsquo;s late peaks of 0.7300+ and 0.6700+ respectively. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>The next biggest major loser vs the Greenback, and Eur post-Draghi (as noted above), with the Franc slipping back towards 0.9600 vs last week&rsquo;s peaks around 0.9540.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CAD: </strong>Both on course to end the first trading day of the week on a relatively even keel against the Usd, with Usd/Jpy rotating around 112.50 and the Loonie mostly at the upper end of 1.2950-10 parameters. Some, belated Cad support from better than expected Canadian wholesale trade data, but ultimately awaiting further NAFTA news from talks planned to restart this week.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM:</strong> The Lira lagged the Rouble for the most part, but accelerated recovery gains vs the Usd through 6.2000 after some stops were triggered in wake of press reports suggesting that Turkey may release US Pastor Brunson next month, and thereby go a long way towards improving relations with the US. Back to the Rub, and Brent&rsquo;s extended rally over $80/bbl through $80.50 and almost $81 was the main prop that saw resistance at 66.0000 vs the Usd cleared. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

OPEC&#39;s JMMC meeting did not conclude with any agreement to raise output, as was expected, with the Saudis describing OPEC&#39;s current response &quot;satisfactory.&quot; Ministers also agreed that there remains capacity available to lift crude output at a later date, if required (Aramco&#39;s CEO says the oil giant has 1.5mln BPD spare capacity, and stands ready to boost supply); but with Brent above $80/bbl, the market remains sceptical, UBS said, noting that Trafigura and Mercuria have said crude prices could rise above $90/bbl in Q4 -- and perhaps over $100/bbl in early 2019 - because there is no possible near-term supply response to the loss of Iranian oil exports; UBS itself has argued that recent export data paints a more worrying picture of Iran&rsquo;s contribution to global markets, and suggests oil price risk remains skewed to the upside. The terrorist attack in Iran over the weekend did not hit any major energy infrastructure or oil output, but UBS says the incident highlights that supply risk in an already tight market with shrinking spare capacity. Elsewhere, reports suggest that Libyan production is running at the highest clip since July 2015, offsetting some of the supply outages from Venezuela and Iran. From Iraq, southern oil exports are reportedly running close to a record 3.6mln BPD. Analysts at Citi said they agree with the Saudi Energy Minister &quot;that no refiners are actually unable to source barrels at the moment,&quot; adding &quot;the bullish issue is still whether there will be an eventual robust response to future declines in Iranian output as US sanctions on exports take hold.&quot; Meanwhile, BofAML&rsquo;s analysts raised its 2019 Brent forecast by $5/bbl to $80/bbl.</p>\r\n",

The US will also sell USD 17bln of 2yr FRN this week. This week brings approx. USD 93bln of redemptions and approx. USD 8bln of coupon payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RECENT PERFORMANCE:</strong> Analysts at Citi note that foreign demand has been deteriorating recently with one possible reason being reserve managers pulling back to defend their currencies amid the on-going EM crisis. A second reason could be a classic hiking cycle migration of foreign investors moving out the front end into the back end of the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RECENT 2-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Tail size: (Prev. tail on the screws, six-auction average: 0.2bps)</li>\r\n  <li>Bid-to-cover: (Prev. 2.89%, six-auction average: 2.77%)</li>\r\n  <li>High-yield % (Prev. 2.655%, six-auction average: 1.79%)</li>\r\n  <li>Dealers % (prev. 42.5%, six-auction average: 41%)</li>\r\n  <li>Directs % (prev. 13.68%, six-auction average: 15%)</li>\r\n  <li>Indirects % (prev. 43.82%, six-auction average: 44%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index has looked vulnerable since the start of Monday&rsquo;s EU session, and only just held above 94.000 until the EUR took flight to challenge the GBP for top spot within the G10 community. The single currency reacted to headlines quoting ECB President Draghi describing the recent rise in underlying inflation as &lsquo;vigorous&rsquo;, and finally overcame Fib resistance at 1.1780 vs the Usd on its way through 1.1815, so far. Technically, some are looking at 1.1801 as pivotal on a closing basis, while the next bullish chart levels are 1.1850-51. However, Cable is actually still outperforming as Eur/Gbp remains capped ahead of 0.8900 vs other Eur crosses that are testing/breaching big figures on the upside, like Eur/Jpy at 133.00 and Eur/Chf at 1.1300, and latest Brexit commentary alongside Sky&rsquo;s acquisition by Comcast seem to be helping Sterling&rsquo;s revival. Cable rebounded over 100 pips from worst levels (around 1.3055 and close to daily cloud support) at one stage, but faded some way ahead of 1.3200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The antipodean Dollars were unable to shake off renewed global trade jitters after China formally declined to resume official talks with the US ahead of the latest batch of import tariffs. Hence, neither derived any traction from bouts of Usd weakness and remained nearer 0.7250 and 0.6650 compared to last week&rsquo;s late peaks of 0.7300+ and 0.6700+ respectively. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next biggest major loser vs the Greenback, and Eur post-Draghi (as noted above), with the Franc slipping back towards 0.9600 vs last week&rsquo;s peaks around 0.9540.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both on course to end the first trading day of the week on a relatively even keel against the Usd, with Usd/Jpy rotating around 112.50 and the Loonie mostly at the upper end of 1.2950-10 parameters. Some, belated Cad support from better than expected Canadian wholesale trade data, but ultimately awaiting further NAFTA news from talks planned to restart this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira lagged the Rouble for the most part, but accelerated recovery gains vs the Usd through 6.2000 after some stops were triggered in wake of press reports suggesting that Turkey may release US Pastor Brunson next month, and thereby go a long way towards improving relations with the US. Back to the Rub, and Brent&rsquo;s extended rally over $80/brl through $80.50 and almost $81 was the main prop that saw resistance at 66.0000 vs the Usd cleared.</p>\r\n",

In addition, fresh US-tariffs took effect from today with 10% US tariffs on USD 200bln worth of Chinese goods and China had previously announced a retaliation of 5-10% tariffs on USD 60bln of US goods. ASX 200 (-0.1%) losses were led by weakness in the metals sector, while healthcare and financial names also weighed on the index.

(Xinhua)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&rsquo;s aides have reportedly begun contingency planning for a snap election in November to save the Brexit talks and her job after EU leaders rebuffed the PM&rsquo;s Chequers plan. Strategists have begun &ldquo;war-gaming&rdquo; an autumn vote to win public backing for a new plan. (Times) However, there were also reports UK Brexit Secretary Raab dismissed claims of a snap general election in Autumn, while playing down the chances of the government pivoting towards a Canada-style deal and EU officials are also thought to be working on a counter-proposal to Chequers, which is likely to appear in early October. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A majority of the UK cabinet is now supporting moves towards a Canada-style Brexit deal. As such, May will now be asked to reassess her approach and opt for a free trade agreement that represents a &lsquo;clean Brexit&rsquo;. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Cabinet Ministers will be required to grant limitless access to European Union migrants for more than two years after a &ldquo;no-deal&rdquo; Brexit, according to the Times. Such a move proposed by Home Secretary Javid will likely anger Brexiteers. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn plans to use Conservative Brexit rebels to force PM May into a General Election as early as November. Furthermore, the Labour leader will reluctantly back a second EU referendum if his party conference calls for it. (Daily Mirror)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&#39;s spokesman says cabinet will meet at 1400BST, adding that the cabinet gave full backing to the Chequers proposal and that remains the case.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities have started the day on the back foot as trade concerns have come back into the fray after US-China sanctions have taken effect and China cancelled US trade talks. The automotive sector is struggling in the wake of this, with weakness in Daimler (-1.3%) and Volkswagen (-1.0%) pressuring both the DAX and consumer discretionary sector into underperformance. This is being further exacerbated by The German Government and carmakers failing to strike a deal on hardware retrofits for older diesel vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The energy sector is the outperformer and benefitting from higher oil prices as market participants digest commentary from the JMMC meeting in Algiers over the weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2 year takeover saga of Sky (+9.0%) has reached a conclusion as the Co. have accepted Comcast&rsquo;s bid of GBP 17.28/share made in a blind auction over the weekend. Comcast beat out 21st Century Fox and value the UK broadcaster at over GBP 30bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Randgold Resources (+4.9%) and Barrick Gold have confirmed they are in late stage discussions regarding a merger valued at USD 18bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR - The Pound has regained some composure after last week&rsquo;s fall from grace, and its recovery is perhaps even more impressive given weekend UK press reports full of talk about a snap election. Moreover, some market observers are pinning the rebound on latest remarks from Raab striking a defiant message amidst all the growing criticism of and opposition to PM May&rsquo;s Chequers plan as he maintains that this is the best formula for a deal with the EU, but M&amp;A flows also look supportive given Comcast&rsquo;s conquest in the battle for Sky. Cable has reclaimed 1.3100+ status, and techs are also noting the fact that a daily cloud base around 1.3055 has held on a couple of occasions, while Eur/Gbp is back below 0.8900 even though the single currency looks more solid around 1.1750 bs the Dollar. In fact, Eur/Usd is trying to probe higher towards 1.1800 in wake of Germany&rsquo;s Ifo survey that saw a clean sweep of beats vs consensus and only minor moderation in components from the previous month. However, a 1.1780 Fib still needs to be breached from a chart perspective and there is decent option expiry interest from 1.1740-50 (1.4 bn) exerting a gravitational pull.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/NZD/CHF/AUD/CAD - All softer vs the Greenback to varying degrees, and essentially keeping the DXY afloat, or above 94.000 at least. Usd/Jpy is holding near the higher end of its recent range and above 112.50, while the Kiwi and Aud have both retreated from big figure levels (0.6700 and 0.7300 respectively) amidst an escalation in US-China trade wars, as Beijing rejects talks and the latest tit-for-tat import tariffs go live. The Franc remains relatively firm just above 0.9600, but the Loonie is back below 1.2900 even though crude prices continue to rally on lingering NAFTA no deal disappointment ahead of yet another round of talks planned this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - In contrast to the Cad, Brent&rsquo;s outperformance vs WTI and further advances towards $81/brl have boosted the Rub to test sub-66.0000 peaks vs the Usd, while the Try has resumed its recovery momentum vs the Usd and bounced off 6.3300+ lows to sit just off 6.2150.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bonds have succumbed to further selling pressure, albeit relatively gradual rather than quick-fire even though near term technical levels have been breached on the way down to fresh intraday lows, while oil prices continue to simmer and are fuelling bearish activity to an extent. Bunds just extended losses to 26 ticks at 158.74 having slipped through 158.86, but held in above last Friday&rsquo;s session low of 158.68, which now obviously becomes the next technical support/target to aim for. Turning to Liffe, and Gilts have also probed below nearest tech and pysch support at 121.00, to 120.96 (-24 ticks) , but remain some way off last Thursday&rsquo;s 120.77 base and the Dec18 contract low (120.54), though not really deriving any traction from a weaker than forecast UK CBI Trends survey. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are declining in sympathy with EU equivalents and steepening ahead of 2 year supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil sector is benefitting from commentary over the weekend where OPEC stated that they would only boost production should customers require it, with Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih also saying that the &ldquo;market is well supplied&rdquo;, and that demand will increase in October. This commentary disregarded US President Trump&rsquo;s calls to markedly increase output to reduce oil prices, and also came amid the OPEC world outlook that stated demand is expected to continue growing at a healthy rate in the medium-term. This has seen Brent up over 2% today and with it finding a firm footing above USD 80/bbl in European trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reaction to this markets are gearing up for higher oil prices in the medium-term, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch revising their 2019 oil price forecasts. This has gone from USD 75/bbl to USD 80/bbl for Brent and USD 65/bbl to USD 67/bbl for WTI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals space, gold is essentially unmoved after declining over a percent on Friday, with the yellow metal trading within a thin USD 5/oz range. London copper has fallen from 10 week highs as trade concerns hit the market, with the construction material trading around USD 6,330/T in Monday&rsquo;s session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC+ monitoring compliance rose to 129% in August from 109% in July, while there were separate source reports on Friday OPEC and Non-OPEC countries discussed a 0.5mln BPD increase. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia was said to be concerned about oil prices being above USD 80, according to sources that added Saudis are running low of Arab Light for October allocations. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Aramco&#39;s CEO says that they have 1.5mln barrels of space capacity and they can provide additional barrels if needed.

The automotive sector is struggling in the wake of this, with weakness in Daimler and Volkswagen pressuring both the DAX and consumer discretionary sector into underperformance. This is being further exacerbated by The German Government and carmakers failing to strike a deal on hardware retrofits for older diesel vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The energy sector is the outperformer and benefitting from higher oil prices as market participants digest commentary from the JMMC meeting in Algiers over the weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2 year takeover saga of Sky has reached a conclusion as the Co. have accepted Comcast&rsquo;s bid of GBP 17.28/share made in a blind auction over the weekend. Comcast beat out 21st Century Fox and value the UK broadcaster at over GBP 30bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Randgold Resources and Barrick Gold have confirmed they are in late stage discussions regarding a merger valued at USD 18bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR - The Pound has regained some composure after last week&rsquo;s fall from grace, and its recovery is perhaps even more impressive given weekend UK press reports full of talk about a snap election. Moreover, some market observers are pinning the rebound on latest remarks from Raab striking a defiant message amidst all the growing criticism of and opposition to PM May&rsquo;s Chequers plan as he maintains that this is the best formula for a deal with the EU, but M&amp;A flows also look supportive given Comcast&rsquo;s conquest in the battle for Sky. Cable has reclaimed 1.3100+ status, and techs are also noting the fact that a daily cloud base around 1.3055 has held on a couple of occasions, while Eur/Gbp is back below 0.8900 even though the single currency looks more solid around 1.1750 bs the Dollar. In fact, Eur/Usd is trying to probe higher towards 1.1800 in wake of Germany&rsquo;s Ifo survey that saw a clean sweep of beats vs consensus and only minor moderation in components from the previous month. However, a 1.1780 Fib still needs to be breached from a chart perspective and there is decent option expiry interest from 1.1740-50 (1.4 bn) exerting a gravitational pull.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/NZD/CHF/AUD/CAD - All softer vs the Greenback to varying degrees, and essentially keeping the DXY afloat, or above 94.000 at least. Usd/Jpy is holding near the higher end of its recent range and above 112.50, while the Kiwi and Aud have both retreated from big figure levels (0.6700 and 0.7300 respectively) amidst an escalation in US-China trade wars, as Beijing rejects talks and the latest tit-for-tat import tariffs go live. The Franc remains relatively firm just above 0.9600, but the Loonie is back below 1.2900 even though crude prices continue to rally on lingering NAFTA no deal disappointment ahead of yet another round of talks planned this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - In contrast to the Cad, Brent&rsquo;s outperformance vs WTI and further advances towards $81/brl have boosted the Rub to test sub-66.0000 peaks vs the Usd, while the Try has resumed its recovery momentum vs the Usd and bounced off 6.3300+ lows to sit just off 6.2150.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bonds have succumbed to further selling pressure, albeit relatively gradual rather than quick-fire even though near term technical levels have been breached on the way down to fresh intraday lows, while oil prices continue to simmer and are fuelling bearish activity to an extent. Bunds just extended losses to 26 ticks at 158.74 having slipped through 158.86, but held in above last Friday&rsquo;s session low of 158.68, which now obviously becomes the next technical support/target to aim for. Turning to Liffe, and Gilts have also probed below nearest tech and pysch support at 121.00, to 120.96 (-24 ticks) , but remain some way off last Thursday&rsquo;s 120.77 base and the Dec18 contract low (120.54), though not really deriving any traction from a weaker than forecast UK CBI Trends survey. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are declining in sympathy with EU equivalents and steepening ahead of 2 year supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil sector is benefitting from commentary over the weekend where OPEC stated that they would only boost production should customers require it, with Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih also saying that the &ldquo;market is well supplied&rdquo;, and that demand will increase in October. This commentary disregarded US President Trump&rsquo;s calls to markedly increase output to reduce oil prices, and also came amid the OPEC world outlook that stated demand is expected to continue growing at a healthy rate in the medium-term. This has seen Brent up over 2% today and with it finding a firm footing above USD 80/bbl in European trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reaction to this markets are gearing up for higher oil prices in the medium-term, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch revising their oil price forecasts. This has gone from USD 75/bbl to USD 80/bbl for Brent and USD 65/bbl to USD 67/bbl for WTI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals space, gold is essentially unmoved after declining over a percent on Friday, with the yellow metal trading within a thin USD 5/oz range. London copper has fallen from 10 week highs as trade concerns hit the market, with the construction material trading around USD 6,330/T in Monday&rsquo;s session.</p>\r\n",
