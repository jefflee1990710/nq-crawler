(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said the US will conduct a meeting in the next 30 days with Japan regarding trade barriers to US goods. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary Raab said the UK customs proposal respects integrity of the EU and the constitutional integrity of the UK, while he added the Irish backstop should be time-limited. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&rsquo;s Barnier stated the UK customs proposal is not new and the plan is little changed from what was presented a year ago, while he also stated that talks with UK Brexit Secretary Raab have been constructive and that he wants talks to be concluded in October but added there are still major issues to be discussed. Furthermore, Barnier said we agreed that future financial market access will be governed by autonomous decisions on both sides and that the UK wants the Irish backstop to be UK-wide which the EU do not object in principle to but are doubtful that it can be done, while he also commented the EU cannot delegate customs policy to Britain and any customs arrangement must respect this principle.

Furthermore, ECB repeated the GC intends to reinvest principal payments from maturing securities under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of net asset purchases. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Draghi said money market expectations are very well aligned with the Governing Council&#39;s and that the uncertainty component in money market term structures may have increased due to various factors including trade, while Draghi also commented that uncertainties relating to trade environment remain prominent but the Euro area economy is solid and broad-based. (Newswires)<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior figures in the Australian government stated they believe the US is ready to strike Iran&#39;s nuclear capability, perhaps as soon as next month, and that Australia is set to assist in identifying potential targets. (ABC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said they will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long-time detainment of Pastor Brunson which followed earlier comments from US VP Pence who said the US will apply sanctions on Turkey if Pastor Brunson is not released. In response, the Turkish Foreign Minister said no one dictates Turkey and that they will never tolerate threat from anybody, while he added the rule of law if for everyone with no exceptions. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump believes GDP figures this Friday will be terrific and that he will be pleased with a figure that has a 4 in front of it, while he stated that some forecast 5.3% but he&#39;s not so certain. Furthermore, US President also commented that drug prices are going to come tumbling down and criticised Canada for having &lsquo;close markets&rsquo;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said auto tariffs with the EU will be on hold and that he hopes metal tariffs with the EU will be resolved fast, while Mnuchin also stated they are ready for negotiations at any time with China. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said Trump has instructed his department to continue the probe on auto tariffs in EU, but not to implement anything and noted that Trump wants trade talks with EU to go faster than NAFTA. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior White House official said US President Trump keeps leverage to place tariffs if EU and US cannot reach an agreement, while the official added that EU needs to open to more US auto exports. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said the 232 tariffs are negotiable in NAFTA talks and that he was unsure regarding getting a deal with NAFTA but hopes to have Mexico conclusion on NAFTA soon which he aims to have a conclusion sometime in August with Canada to follow. Elsewhere, there were also comments from Mexico&#39;s Economy Minister Guajardo who said he is looking to speed up NAFTA negotiations.

The slew of bad figures resulted in the market cap of FB falling roughly $140bln, resulting in the greatest market cap loss in stock market history. Qualcomm (QCOM) also reported AMC on Wednesday, beating on both top and bottom lines, and more interestingly, it abandoned the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) as China&rsquo;s anti-trust regulators rejected it. As a result, QCOM announced a $30bln buyback, which had been touted at before if they were to abandon the deal; also, its CEO announced his resignation. BMO on Thursday, McDonalds (MCD) reported a beat on both top and bottom lines, however, US sales cooled; MCD underperformed in the DJI on Thursday. AMD (AMD) soared to the top of the SPX after beating on both top and bottom line, among with Arconic (ARNC) which is attracting interest from PE firms, prepared to pay roughly $25/shr. The two names were the top 2 performers in the SPX. Biogen (BIIB) was lower after its Alzheimer&rsquo;s drug trial did not show a significant improvement. Nielsen (NLSN) lost almost 25% of its market cap after earnings missed. On Thursday, it was reported that Walmart (WMT) ended their partnership with Synchrony Financial (SYF) for in-store credit cards, and chose to partner with Capital One (COF) instead. SYF shares fell over 10% as a result. SPX -0.30% at 2837, NDX -1.44% at 7400, DJI +0.45% at 25527.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries edged lower on Thursday ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s GDP release, which analysts expect to come in strong, per hints from the Trump administration, which noted on Thursday there are a &ldquo;lot of predictions, a lot of predictions,&rdquo; including some &ldquo;with a 5 in front of it.&rdquo; Yields were higher by c.3-4bps across the curve; 2s10s, 2s30s and 5s30s narrowed by c.2bps while 5s10s, 2s5s by c.1bps. US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 10 ticks lower at. 119-11.</p>\r\n",

Nonetheless, China&rsquo;s MOFCOM reiterated that it does not want a trade war, but is not afraid of one. On the US side, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin told China they are ready for negotiations at any time and, following yesterday&rsquo;s reconciliatory approach from Trump on the EU, he confirmed auto tariffs with the EU will be on hold and expressed hopes for metal tariffs with the EU to be resolved fast, emphasizing this will be the first step. Also commenting on the meeting, NEC Director Kudlow noted EU&#39;s Juncker made it clear that he would help on the &ldquo;China problem&rdquo;. Additionally, US Trade Representative Lighthizer said China has a clear, chronic problem with the US, and the plan with China is going to take time. Elsewhere, US Commerce Secretary Ross said Trump has told his department to continue the probe on auto tariffs in EU, but not to implement anything, as Trump wants trade talks with EU to go faster than NAFTA. He reported a conclusion on auto tariffs is set to come in a month or so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*NAFTA: </strong>US Trade Representative Lighthizer hopes we are in the final stages of the NAFTA negotiations, emphasizing that the President believes the US will be better off with bilateral deals. He has confidence that the 232 tariffs (taking action due to national security) are negotiable in NAFTA talks, but he does not know that we are going to get a deal. US President Trump criticised Canada for having &lsquo;closed markets&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>As expected, the European Central Bank stood pat on policy, in a meeting where the Governing Council once again apparently discussed little of actual significance, and accordingly, there was little by way of new information. In his Q&amp;A, Draghi reiterated the central bank&rsquo;s intention to wind down its net asset purchases by the end of the year, and keep rates at present levels through the Summer of 2019. There was no meaningful updates on how the ECB will go about handling reinvestments from maturing securities, though Draghi pointed us towards the ECB&rsquo;s capital key, as a guide. Draghi repeated his PPP approach (prudence, patience, and persistence), which analysts at Lloyds have said is consistent with gradual removal of policy accommodation contingent on the economic outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*BREXIT:</strong> EU&rsquo;s Barnier said that the UK customs proposal is not new, and the plan is little changed from what was presented a year ago. He noted talks with UK Brexit Secretary Raab have been constructive as they have agreed that future financial market access will be governed by autonomous decisions on both sides; however, they are not at end of road yet, as there are still major issues to be discussed. In particular he urged for a conclusion on a legally operational Irish backstop, explaining the UK wants it to be UK-wide though EU do not object in principle but are doubtful that it can be done. He said the next round of talks will be in mid-August and he wants talks to be concluded in October. He added the EU cannot delegate customs policy to Britain and any customs arrangement must respect this principle and that it is clear for the EU that what the UK has already agreed to has been definitively agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DURABLE GOODS </strong>rose by 1% in June, but missed expectations of 3%, with the advance data attributed to gains across most categories, especially in motor vehicles and aircraft orders. Non-defence posted at 0.6%, beating the 0.4% consensus and given upwardly revised data from May and this latest release orders are up 8.6% y/y. Analysts at Oxford Economics forecast &lsquo;strong business investment in H2 2018&rsquo; though they warn the fiscal stimulus effect, energy prices and global demand will wind down whilst trade tensions will continue to pose a risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* INTERNATIONAL TRADE BALANCE f</strong>or June showed a deficit of 68.33bln, a smaller deficit compared to the 64.77bln in May. Imports remain strong, amid the fiscal stimulus and a stronger Greenback whereas exports have suffered. Analysts at Oxford Economics see this trend continuing, export growth is to moderate as demand is set to wind down whilst exports will remain supported. They note &lsquo;trade policy could take a major bite out of US trade flows, depending on how significantly the Trump administration ramps up trade tensions&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX&nbsp;-0.30% at 2837, NDX -1.44% at 7400, DJI +0.45% at 25527.</strong> SECTORS: Energy: +1.00%, Materials: +0.60%, Industrials: +0.85%, Cons Discretionary: -0.50%, Cons Staples: +0.52%, Health Care: -0.19%, Financials: -0.13%, Tech: -1.64%, Telecoms: +0.46%, Utilities: +1.14%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: </strong>AMC on Wednesday,&nbsp;Facebook&rsquo;s (FB)&nbsp;EPS came in slightly above expectations, however revenues fell short of Wall St expectations, as did its monthly active users and its daily active users, as well as weak guidance. The slew of bad figures resulted in the market cap of FB falling roughly $140bln, resulting in the greatest market cap loss in stock market history. Qualcomm (QCOM)&nbsp;also reported AMC on Wednesday, beating on both top and bottom lines, and more interestingly, it abandoned the acquisition of&nbsp;NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)&nbsp;as China&rsquo;s anti-trust regulators rejected it. As a result, QCOM announced a $30bln buyback, which had been touted at before if they were to abandon the deal; also, its CEO announced his resignation. BMO on Thursday,&nbsp;McDonalds (MCD)&nbsp;reported a beat on both top and bottom lines, however, US sales cooled; MCD underperformed in the DJI on Thursday.&nbsp;AMD (AMD)&nbsp;soared to the top of the SPX after beating on both top and bottom line, among with&nbsp;Arconic (ARNC)&nbsp;which is attracting interest from PE firms, prepared to pay roughly $25/shr. The two names were the top 2 performers in the SPX.&nbsp;Biogen (BIIB)&nbsp;was lower after its Alzheimer&rsquo;s drug trial did not show a significant improvement. Nielsen (NLSN)&nbsp;lost almost 25% of its market cap after earnings missed. On Thursday, it was reported that&nbsp;Walmart (WMT)&nbsp;ended their partnership with&nbsp;Synchrony Financial (SYF)&nbsp;for in-store credit cards, and chose to partner with&nbsp;Capital One (COF)&nbsp;instead. SYF shares fell over 10% as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (U8) SETTLES 31 CENTS HIGHER AT $69.61; BRENT (U8) SETTLES 61 CENTS HIGHER AT $74.54. </strong>Oil prices were higher on Thursday, for the third consecutive session, amid tensions in on the Red Sea, where Saudi Arabia oil shipments were suspended through the Bab-El-Mandeb strait after Houthi attacks in the regions. Kuwait was deciding on whether to halt oil exports via the Bab El-Mandeb, even though the impact was touted to be limited on Kuwait&rsquo;s oil shipments. Further support was given to oil prices following the latest Genscape inventory estimate for Cushing. Elsewhere Goldman Sachs said oil is likely to retest USD 80/bbl this year. Nigeria&#39;s exports of Forcados crude oil fell to 225k BPD in September from August&#39;s original 259k BPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 10 TICKS LOWER AT. 119-11. </strong>Treasuries edged lower on Thursday ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s GDP release, which analysts expect to come in strong, per hints from the Trump administration, which noted on Thursday there are a &ldquo;lot of predictions, a lot of predictions,&rdquo; including some &ldquo;with a 5 in front of it.&rdquo; Yields were higher by c.3-4bps across the curve; 2s10s, 2s30s and 5s30s narrowed by c.2bps while 5s10s, 2s5s by c.1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 7-YEAR AUCTION REVIEW: </strong>The $30bln 7yr notes auction came in on the screws at a high yield of 2.93. The demand was the lowest since March with a bid-to-cover of 2.49x. Directs were awarded the lowest share since January whist dealers and indirects took portions close to recent averages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Back above 94.500 and firmly on all the above, having survived a downturn through support in the 94.200 area and holding in above 94.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The single currently was effectively static on the unchanged ECB policy announcement that was unanimously anticipated, then steady during the prepared text from President Draghi before retesting peaks vs the USD just shy of 1.1750 when he reiterated upbeat economic assessments and confidence about inflation remaining on a sustainable upward path towards target. However, ramming home guidance about a hike through Summer 2019, at the earliest, via a clear message that current market expectations concur with the GC consensus prompted a EUR sell-off back down through 1.170, basing around 1.1650.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> Although the EUR suffered an abrupt fall from grace and reversal from highs seen in wake of the US-EU tariff spat adjournment for more negotiations, ongoing Washington vs Beijing trade angst and heightened verbal threats continue to undermine the AUD, and the NZD to a lesser extent. Indeed, AUDUSD is back below the 0.7400 handle while the Kiwi also had big option expiry interest to contend with at 0.6800 and drifted down from 0.6850 into the NY cut as a result (or in part at least).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> For once it seems that Pound weakness was not really due to UK-specifics and anything bad data or Brexit-wise, but instead Cable tracked overall trends and climbed above 1.3200 when the USD was at its weakest before pulling back in sympathy with the EUR when Draghi &lsquo;intervened&rsquo; to revisit sub-1.3100 territory. There was, however, a reminded that Brexit headlines can weigh on the pound, and 1.31 was eyed after the Barnier/Raab presser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, CAD, JPY: </strong>All ending Thursday&rsquo;s slightly weaker vs the Greenback, with the Franc stuck between 0.9940-05 and Loonie equally mired even though it retreated a bit further from best levels vs its US counterpart (to 1.3065 at one stage vs 1.3025 at the other extreme). Meanwhile, the JPY lost some hawkish BoJ momentum earlier in the session under 111.00, but then reclaimed the level to trade as high as 111.22 as the USD appreaciated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>CNH back under pressure amidst another ramp up in aggressive rhetoric between the US and China having regained composure on a stronger CNY fix and market talk about local banks active in the forward market selling USD 12 months ahead. Conversely, the MXN is consolidating gains above 19.0000 vs the USD on more reports that a NAFTA deal may be forthcoming, but the TRY is also unwinding recent gains on threats of more US sanctions against Turkey.</p>\r\n",

SocGen added that any short covering because of the record net shorts from leveraged funds in TY futures should benefit the auction, along with demand from the month-end extension. &ldquo;And even as the 7y sector has cheapened on the fly versus 5s and 10s since Thursday, the sector remains rich, as the fly is trading near its lowest level since 2013,&rdquo; SocGen says. Results will be published just after 1800 BST/1300 EST.</p>\r\n",

However, ramming home guidance about a hike through Summer 2019, at the earliest, via a clear message that current market expectations concur with the GC consensus prompted a Eur sell-off back down through 1.1700 and close to chart support around 1.1665.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Eur suffered an abrupt fall from grace and reversal from highs seen in wake of the US-EU tariff spat adjournment for more negotiations, ongoing Washington vs Beijing trade angst and heightened verbal threats continue to undermine the Aud, and the Nzd to a lesser extent. Indeed, Aud/Usd is back on the 0.7400 handle having failed yet again to build on gains above the big figure and 0.7450, while the Kiwi also had big option expiry interest to contend with at 0.6800 and drifted down from 0.6850 into the NY cut as a result (or in part at at least).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For once it seems that Pound weakness was not really due to UK-specifics and anything bad data or Brexit-wise, but instead Cable tracked overall trends and climbed above 1.3200 when the Usd was at its weakest before pulling back in sympathy with the Eur when Draghi &lsquo;intervened&rsquo; to revisit sub-1.3150 territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All ending Thursday&rsquo;s EU session relatively unchanged vs the Greenback, with the Franc stuck between 0.9940-05 and Loonie equally mired even though it retreated a bit further from best levels vs its US counterpart (to 1.3065 at one stage vs 1.3025 at the other extreme). Meanwhile, the Jpy lost some hawkish BoJ momentum to trade back under 111.00, just, but could be cushioned by supply stacked beyond the big figure and reported exporter activity (LHS) for month end,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back above 94.500 and firmly on all the above, having survived a downturn through support in the 94.200 area and holding in above 94.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cnh back under pressure amidst another ramp up in aggressive rhetoric between the US and China having regained composure on a stronger Cny fix and market talk about local banks active in the forward market selling Usd 12 months ahead. Conversely, the Mxn is consolidating gains above 19.0000 vs the Usd on more reports that a NAFTA deal may be forthcoming, but the Try is also unwinding recent gains on threats of more US sanctions against Turkey.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (Unch) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) were subdued with M&amp;A news the catalyst for the biggest movers in Australia as Fairfax surged from a takeover deal by Nine Entertainment which subsequently weighed on the latter, while the Japanese benchmark was dampened by a firmer currency and reports the BoJ could adjust its ETF purchases more towards those associated with the TOPIX and less at those associated with Nikkei indices. Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) and Hang Seng (-0.5%) were also lower alongside the broad lacklustre tone in the regional majors and following another consecutive liquidity drain by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as yields continued to gain in which the 10yr yield rose to its highest level in a year of 0.1% amidst the speculation of a possible BoJ policy tweak next week, while today&rsquo;s 2yr JGB auction was also weaker than previous on nearly all metrics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 70bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7662 (Prev. 6.8040)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ is reportedly to review the allocation of ETF purchases and is considering purchasing more ETFs linked to TOPIX and less associated with Nikkei indices, but is likely to maintain the total annual ETF buying at JPY 6tln. In separate reports, Twitter sources noted the BoJ may consider dropping JGB buying operation dates release and may allow slight JGB yield curve steepening, while there BoJ were also said to see higher super long yields having a favourable effect. (Nikkei/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC plans to adjust two structural parameters in its macro prudential assessment, and the MPA adjustment is to vary depending on province; according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports suggest that Large domestic Chinese banks are offering 1yr USD for CNY; driving lower USD/CNY 1yr swaps to as low as 0-125 points (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRADE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were initial reports that Europe was said to have made concessions to US President Trump in trade talks in which they agreed to lower industrial tariffs and import more US soybeans. This was then confirmed in a joint press conference in which US President Trump stated they agreed to work on zero tariffs, zero barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods and that the EU has agreed to buy more US soybeans. Furthermore. Trump stated they will resolve steel and aluminium tariffs, and that there will be no new tariffs against EU after parties agreed to trade negotiations, while EU&#39;s Juncker stated they have agreed to begin dialogue on standards as well as WTO reform and he later commented the major concession from US was that it agreed not to raise tariffs on autos and parts during negotiations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross reiterated Section 232 investigation on autos is ongoing and that there has not been any action proposed, while there were also reports that US Senators introduced a bipartisan bill to delay auto tariffs until a study has been completed. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Commerce Ministry says China does not want a trade war but are not afraid of one. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU leaders are looking to let UK PM May sell her Brexit blueprint directly to member states in an effort to kickstart stalled talks on Britain&rsquo;s departure. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>British officials are reportedly considering letting the EU impose market regulations on Northern Ireland as the remainder of the UK breaks away after Brexit, in an attempt to break the current deadlock in negotiations, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European bourses trade mostly higher across the board as markets digest the fallout of yesterday&rsquo;s EU-US trade talks and react to a slew of large cap earnings. Sentiment for the auto sector in particular has been boosted by news that the EU and US agreed to not raise tariffs on autos and parts during negotiations. This has boosted the likes of Volkswagen (+3.1 %), BMW (+3.0%) and Daimler (+2.3%) with the latter seeing gains capped by its pre-market earnings report; DAX outperforms its peers with gains of 1.4% (vs. Eurostoxx 50 +0.8%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, on a sector basis, energy names lag their peers amid losses in Shell (-2.1%) with the Co.&rsquo;s USD 25bln buyback and 30% increase in profits not enough to satisfy investors with some flagging concerns surrounding cashflow; FTSE 100 (Unch) lags its peers given Shell&rsquo;s weighting in the index, with the FTSE also hampered by recent gains in the GBP and an overall lack of upside catalysts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable movers post-earnings include: Airbus (+5.0%), British American Tobacco (+4.5%), Smith &amp; Nephew (+3.8%), KPN (+3.4%), Roche (+2.0%), Nestle (+1.7%), Nokia (-8.1%), Valeo (-6.7%), AB Inbev (-5.1%), Schneider Electric (-1.4%), Anglo American (-1.2%) and Diageo (-1.1%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nasdaq 100 futures were pressured overnight as Facebook&rsquo;s market cap dropped by around USD 140bln after revenue and active user numbers missed expectations. Facebook is currently down 16.8% pre-market. Elsewhere, NXP Semiconductors (-10.2% pre-market) confirmed Qualcomm&rsquo;s (+5.5% pre-market) exit from the deal. Qualcomm are to pay a USD 2bln termination fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Another downturn and breach of near term support for the index in wake of a truce on tariffs struck between Trump and Juncker yesterday, pending more talks to resolve the trade barriers and import restrictions at issue. The DXY is trying to stabilise and pare some losses after hitting a new low for the week just above 94.000 vs 94.206 at worst on Monday. Chart-wise, 93.950 is now within striking distance if the index fails to sustain recovery momentum and loses more ground vs G10 peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The biggest beneficiary of the latest Usd downturn, but also in its own right as hawkish BoJ reports continue to circulate ahead of next week&rsquo;s policy meeting. Consequently, the headline pair is back under 111.00 and looking at bearish/downside tech levels around 110.65 (50% Fib) before 110.51 (55 DMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - Back to the bottom of the pile and heavy again above 0.7400 vs its US counterpart as initial euphoria over the aforementioned US-EU &lsquo;agreement&rsquo; wanes amidst ongoing US-China strains that have more bearing down under.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CHF/EUR/GBP - All modestly softer, or off best levels seen overnight vs the Usd to be precise, with the Kiwi easing back from 0.6850 and still wary about those mega option expiries at the 0.6800 strike (circa 1.75 bn) rolling off later today. Meanwhile, the Franc remains rangebound, albeit nearer the top of 0.9905-40 parameters, and the single currency has topped out ahead of Monday&rsquo;s 1.1750 best ahead of the ECB with options pricing a relatively tame 60 pip break-even on the event risk &ndash; for a full preview visit the Ransquawk Research Suite. Elsewhere, Cable is pivoting 1.3200 amidst the general, if not broad Greenback declines, but capped ahead of its weekly cloud base around 1.3227.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - Another relative outperformer and holding the bulk of its gains vs the Usd, with the Loonie meandering between 1.3025-50 and deriving support (alongside the MXN) from upbeat NAFTA noises of late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YUAN - Intervention of sorts, with a marked drop in the PBoC&rsquo;s official Usd/Cny fix overnight (to 6.7662 vs 6.8040 on Wednesday) and widespread reports of 1 year forward selling down to flat points from 100+ against spot at 6.7800 and 6.7900 for the Cnh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts both extended recovery gains to post fresh intraday highs at 162.14 and 123.21 respectively (-23 and -9 ticks vs -49 and -31 ticks at one stage), but topped out amidst further strength in EU equities, and perhaps some technical trading ahead of potential fundamental leads via the ECB and a relatively busy US data agenda. Market contacts note that 162.18 represents a 50% Fib of yesterday&rsquo;s move on Eurex, while the UK benchmark is still not threatening to test this week&rsquo;s 122.94 low (from Tuesday), albeit just dipping under 123.00 to a marginal new Liffe low of 122.99. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain pressured and the curve steeper again ahead of more supply in the form of $30 bn 7 year notes that usually draw decent investor demand, especially foreign buyers, but have been preceded by relatively strong 2 and 5 year sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again markets are seeing a divergence in the performance of WTI (-0.1%) and Brent (+0.8%) with the latter supported by reports that Saudi Arabia have temporarily halted shipments via the Red Sea shipping lane after 2 vessels were attacked by Houthi rebels. This was then followed by reports that Kuwait are debating whether to halt oil exports via the passage given recent events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In metals markets, spot gold (-0.2%) is slightly softer in European trade amid the modestly firmer USD after the PBoC bucked their recent trend by strengthening the CNY fix rate. Elsewhere, metals prices in London have broadly been supported by the aforementioned breakthrough in trade talks between the EU and US. Steel prices were seen higher during Asia-Pac trade with gains capped by fears over the Chinese crackdown on domestic pollution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Global crude steel output +5.8% y/y to 151mln tonnes.

Sentiment for the auto sector in particular has been boosted by news that the EU and US agreed to not raise tariffs on autos and parts during negotiations. This has boosted the likes of Volkswagen (+3.3%), BMW (+2.4%) and Daimler (+0.5%) with the latter seeing gains capped by its pre-market earnings report; DAX outperforms its peers with gains of 1.4% (vs. Eurostoxx 50 +0.8%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, on a sector basis, energy names lag their peers amid losses in Shell (-1.9%) with the Co.&rsquo;s USD 25bln buyback and 30% increase in profits not enough to satisfy investors with some flagging concerns surrounding cashflow; FTSE 100 (-0.1%) lags its peers given Shell&rsquo;s weighting in the index, with the FTSE also hampered by recent gains in the GBP and an overall lack of upside catalysts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable movers post-earnings include: Airbus (+5.0%), British American Tobacco (+5.4%), Smith &amp; Nephew (+3.8%), KPN (+2.8%), Roche (+2.1%), Nestle (+2.1%), Nokia (-7.6%), Valeo (-6.7%), AB Inbev (-5.1%), Schneider Electric (-1.4%), Anglo American (-1.2%) and Diageo (-1.1%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Another downturn and breach of near term support for the index in wake of a truce on tariffs struck between Trump and Juncker yesterday, pending more talks to resolve the trade barriers and import restrictions at issue. The DXY is trying to stabilise and pare some losses after hitting a new low for the week just above 94.000 vs 94.206 at worst on Monday. Chart-wise, 93.950 is now within striking distance if the index fails to sustain recovery momentum and loses more ground vs G10 peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The biggest beneficiary of the latest Usd downturn, but also in its own right as hawkish BoJ reports continue to circulate ahead of next week&rsquo;s policy meeting. Consequently, the headline pair is back under 111.00 and looking at bearish/downside tech levels around 110.65 (50% Fib) before 110.51 (55 DMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - Back to the bottom of the pile and heavy again above 0.7400 vs its US counterpart as initial euphoria over the aforementioned US-EU &lsquo;agreement&rsquo; wanes amidst ongoing US-China strains that have more bearing down under.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CHF/EUR/GBP - All modestly softer, or off best levels seen overnight vs the Usd to be precise, with the Kiwi easing back from 0.6850 and still wary about those mega option expiries at the 0.6800 strike (circa 1.75 bn) rolling off later today. Meanwhile, the Franc remains rangebound, albeit nearer the top of 0.9905-25 parameters, and the single currency has topped out ahead of Monday&rsquo;s 1.1750 best ahead of the ECB with options pricing a relatively tame 60 pip break-even on the event risk &ndash; for a full preview visit the Ransquawk Research Suite. Elsewhere, Cable is pivoting 1.3200 amidst the general, if not broad Greenback declines, but capped ahead of its weekly cloud base around 1.3227.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - Another relative outperformer and holding the bulk of its gains vs the Usd, with the Loonie meandering between 1.3025-50 and deriving support (alongside the MXN) from upbeat NAFTA noises of late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YUAN - Intervention of sorts, with a marked drop in the PBoC&rsquo;s official Usd/Cny fix overnight (to 6.7662 vs 6.8040 on Wednesday) and widespread reports of 1 year forward selling down to flat points from 100+ against spot at 6.7800 and 6.7900 for the Cnh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts both extended recovery gains to post fresh intraday highs at 162.14 and 123.21 respectively (-23 and -9 ticks vs -49 and -28 ticks at one stage), but topped out amidst further strength in EU equities, and perhaps some technical trading ahead of potential fundamental leads via the ECB and a relatively busy US data agenda. Market contacts note that 162.18 represents a 50% Fib of yesterday&rsquo;s move on Eurex, while the UK benchmark is still not threatening to test this week&rsquo;s 122.94 low (from Tuesday) and keeping its head above 123.00. However, US Treasuries remain pressured and the curve steeper again ahead of more supply in the form of $30 bn 7 year notes that usually draw decent investor demand, especially foreign buyers, but have been preceded by relatively strong 2 and 5 year sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again markets are seeing a divergence in the performance of WTI (-0.1%) and Brent (+0.5%) with the latter supported by reports that Saudi Arabia have temporarily halted shipments via the Red Sea shipping lane after 2 vessels were attacked by Houthi rebels; energy newsflow is otherwise relatively light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In metals markets, spot gold (-0.2%) is slightly softer in European trade amid the modestly firmer USD after the PBoC bucked their recent trend by strengthening the CNY fix rate. Elsewhere, metals prices in London have broadly been supported by the aforementioned breakthrough in trade talks between the EU and US. Steel prices were seen higher during Asia-Pac trade with gains capped by fears over the Chinese crackdown on domestic pollution. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

In the interim, external impulses will continue to provide the main direction/impetus along with any further Brexit and or global trade war developments of course. So, ECB today, BoJ next Tuesday, and last but not necessarily least the Fed on Wednesday. Back to debt futures, Bunds have regained a bit more composure to trade up at 162.12, -1/4 point vs -49 ticks at worst.</p>\r\n",

However, the overall bearish trend has resumed amidst a broad upturn in risk sentiment on the back of a &lsquo;breakthrough&rsquo; in talks between US President Trump and EU&rsquo;s Juncker to avert the immediate threat of tit-for-tat trade sanctions via import tariffs and other protectionist measures. Meanwhile, ongoing speculation about potential hawkish policy tweaks by the BoJ next week has prompted another JGB sell-off overnight, with the 10 year yield up to 0.1%, and this could all overshadow the ECB later, especially if President Draghi remains tight-lipped on rate guidance, or sticks to the somewhat vague &lsquo;at least through Summer 2019&rsquo; timeframe announced at June&rsquo;s policy meeting. Technically, 161.85 is nearest support vs the 161.88 low, so far. Also ahead, Italian supply and the $30 bn 7 year note auction.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (Unch) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) were subdued with M&amp;A news the catalyst for the biggest movers in Australia as Fairfax surged from a takeover deal by Nine Entertainment which subsequently weighed on the latter, while the Japanese benchmark was dampened by a firmer currency and reports the BoJ could adjust its ETF purchases more towards those associated with the TOPIX and less at those associated with Nikkei indices. Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) and Hang Seng (-0.7%) were also lower alongside the broad lacklustre tone in the regional majors and following another consecutive liquidity drain by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as yields continued to gain in which the 10yr yield rose to its highest level in a year of 0.1% amidst the speculation of a possible BoJ policy tweak next week, while today&rsquo;s 2yr JGB auction was also weaker than previous on nearly all metrics.<br /><br />PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 70bln.

In separate reports, Twitter sources noted the BoJ may consider dropping JGB buying operation dates release and may allow slight JGB yield curve steepening, while there BoJ were also said to see higher super long yields having a favourable effect. (Nikkei/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU leaders are looking to let UK PM May sell her Brexit blueprint directly to member states in an effort to kickstart stalled talks on Britain&rsquo;s departure. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>British officials are reportedly considering letting the EU impose market regulations on Northern Ireland as the remainder of the UK breaks away after Brexit, in an attempt to break the current deadlock in negotiations, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD remained softer overnight after having lost ground against the EUR due to the positive trade developments in which US and EU agreed to work on zero tariffs, barriers and subsidies on non-auto industrial goods. Furthermore, they also agreed not to raise tariffs on autos and parts during negotiations, as well as resolve steel and aluminium tariffs. The weakness in the greenback helped GBP/USD reclaim the 1.3200 handle and kept USD/JPY below 111.00, while the PBoC also strengthened its reference rate accordingly. Elsewhere, the remainder of FX pairs were uneventful amid a lack of tier-1 data releases although high-beta currencies AUD and NZD slightly pullied back amid the lacklustre risk-tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities kept range-bound overnight in which WTI crude futures remained above USD 69.00/bbl and held on to the prior day&rsquo;s gains which were spurred by a larger than expected drawdown in DoE crude inventories. Elsewhere, gold prices were also flat as initial upside due to a softening greenback was capped by resistance once again at the USD 1235/oz level, while copper prices were higher fuelled by the positive trade EU-US trade developments but are off today&rsquo;s best levels amid the lacklustre risk tone in Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia halted oil shipments through Bab-el-Mandeb strait near Yemen after 2 vessels were attacked by Houthi rebels. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury sold USD 36bln of 5-year notes in a decent sale which saw a stop-through of 1bps, and better participation from indirects. The curve was mixed on Wednesday, with 2-year yields printing fresh near-decade highs ahead of next week&rsquo;s FOMC. US new home sales data garnered little price action, with traders opting to keep their powder dry ahead of the Trump/Juncker meeting. The curve continued to flatten, with 2s30s narrow by around 3bps at settlement, 2s5s flatter by slightly less than that, while other major curve spread were narrower modestly. US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 3 ticks higher at 119-21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were initial reports that Europe was said to have made concessions to US President Trump in trade talks in which they agreed to lower industrial tariffs and import more US soybeans. This was then confirmed in a joint press conference in which US President Trump stated they agreed to work on zero tariffs, zero barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods and that the EU has agreed to buy more US soybeans. Furthermore. Trump stated they will resolve steel and aluminium tariffs, and that there will be no new tariffs against EU after parties agreed to trade negotiations, while EU&#39;s Juncker stated they have agreed to begin dialogue on standards as well as WTO reform and he later commented the major concession from US was that it agreed not to raise tariffs on autos and parts during negotiations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross reiterated Section 232 investigation on autos is ongoing and that there has not been any action proposed, while there were also reports that US Senators introduced a bipartisan bill to delay auto tariffs until a study has been completed. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo said essence of NAFTA is trilateral and will continue to be trilateral, while he also stated that the three sides need to show flexibility to reach an agreement. In related news, Mexico&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Minister Videgaray said NAFTA negotiations are at a very advanced stage but challenges remain, while Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland said a renewed NAFTA deal can be realised.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade with subdued tone as a plethora of earnings and corporate updates dominates news flow. Furthermore, the region also digests US-EU trade talks in which concessions were made to avoid a trade war, as well as weakness in Nasdaq 100 futures after Facebook&rsquo;s market cap dropped by around USD 140bln after-market due to revenue and active user numbers missing expectations. ASX 200 (Unch) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are subdued with M&amp;A news the catalyst for the biggest movers in Australia with Fairfax surging from a takeover deal by Nine Entertainment which subsequently weighed on the latter, while the Japanese benchmark is dampened by a firmer currency and reports the BoJ could adjust its ETF purchases more towards those associated with the TOPIX and less associated with Nikkei indices. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.5%) are also lower alongside the broad lacklustre tone in the region and following another consecutive daily liquidity drain by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback remains softer overnight after having lost ground against the EUR due to the positive trade developments in which US and EU agreed to work on zero tariffs, barriers and subsidies on non-auto industrial goods. Furthermore, they agreed not to raise tariffs on autos and parts during negotiations and for the EU to purchase more US soybeans, as well as resolve steel and aluminium tariffs. The weakness in the greenback helped GBP/USD reclaim the 1.3200 handle and kept USD/JPY below 111.00, while the PBoC also strengthened its reference rate accordingly. Elsewhere, the remainder of FX pairs were uneventful amid a lack of tier-1 data releases and with high-beta antipodean currencies slightly pulling back amid the lacklustre risk-tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as prices track the losses in T-notes following the &lsquo;breakthrough&rsquo; in trade discussions, and as yields continue to gain amidst the speculation of a possible BoJ policy tweak next week.</p>\r\n",
