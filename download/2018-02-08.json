Equity futures were slightly negative -- though generally moving horizontally -- heading into the US cash open. On the open, however, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 fell, with the latter shedding 200 points. As the session wore on, the risk tone soured, piling pressure on indices.&nbsp;There was a period in quiet afternoon trade the losses were pared, but the buying interest wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to make any meaningful dent in the losses incurred over the last five sessions. Into the close, trade became choppy, with major indices extending their losses.&nbsp; Financials led the declines, closely followed by tech stocks. The defensive utilities sector was a better performer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10-Year T-Note Futures settle 3+ ticks lower at 120-28+. Those seeking havens amid the risk-off mood will have been encouraged how Treasuries caught a bid amid the equity slide. As we entered NY trade, the curve was bear-steepening influenced by a decent slate of corporate supply, as well as some suggesting that the gilt sell-off post-BOE was leading fixed-income price action; but the steepness of the Treasury curve was unwound as equities fell, and havens caught a bid. The US auctioned $16bln in 30-year bonds, tailing by 1.2bps. The internals of the 30-year auction weren&#39;t particularly attractive: cover was softer,&nbsp;foreign takedown appears week (indirects were below recent averages), and dealers took the most since the November auction. The curve began flattening in wake if the auction.&nbsp;There has been nothing from this week&#39;s supply of 3s, 10s and 30s which suggests that there is strong demand for US paper at the higher yields seen as of late, which is demanding caution about the current &lsquo;stabilisation&rsquo; in yields. Elsewhere, the US Treasury announced it will auction $7bln of 30-year TIPS next week.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANK SPEAK:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Dudley (voter) said as long as inflation is beneath 2% the Fed can afford to be patient with rate hikes, and that he thinks 3 hikes in 2018 still seems very reasonable but 4 hikes are possible if the economic outlook improves. &nbsp;Dudley also said the US is possibly moving to a path of faster wage growth but noted the FOMC shouldn&rsquo;t put too much faith in one number, while he also said it is unlikely there will be a reason not to hike in March. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Harker (non-voter) noted that the inflation outlook was still an &#39;open question&#39;, while he added that he was in the two hikes camp, although if inflation and financial conditions improved, he would support three hikes.&nbsp;(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter) said that 2018 will be a strong year for the US economy, although he expects that the pace of growth will ease in 2019 and 2020. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (non-voter) was uncertain about the potential impact of tax cuts on raising wages and hiring rates. He again reiterated his dovish credentials, questioning the need for further rate hikes while the Fed is waiting for compensation inflation to rise. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BOC&#39;s Wilkins said high household debt and NAFTA uncertainties the biggest risks to Canada economy. She notes that the quarter didn&rsquo;t get off to the best start, but is in line with expectations. The economy and consumption are expected to continue growing. On the market choppiness, she says that stock market volatility amid rising yields is to be expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banxico hiked rates by 25bps, as expected,&nbsp;citing the need to anchor inflation expectations, as well as due to expected Fed hikes. The central bank said there was an upward bias in the risks to inflation, and that unfavourable evolution of NAFTA talks pose a risk to price pressures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Weidmann argued that the recent rise in the EUR was unlikely to weigh on Eurozone expansion, adding that ECB policy should remain loose beyond the end of QE purchases. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Praet&nbsp;said if data confirms the gradual build-up of inflationary pressures, it would not necessarily be sufficient to affirm a sustained adjustment. He also said that the ECB should be more specific on what it means by &quot;well past&quot; in its forward guidance (current guidance: &quot;we continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases&quot;), as the QE programme nears its end.&nbsp;(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Mersch and Villeroy said little by way of new information.&nbsp;(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BOE voted 9-0 to keep rates on hold at 0.50% (some were expecting McCafferty and Saunders to hawkishly dissent), but made its forward guidance more aggressive, saying policy will need to be tightened somewhat earlier and somewhat more than previously expected. The BOE said that possible inflation may rise above 3% soon and is expected to stay there; wages are expected to rise further due to tightening labour market; Brexit remains the most significant source of uncertainty for UK economic outlook; GBP projections are higher by around 3% because of a weaker USD. The meeting minutes stated rates will need to rise earlier and by a greater extent than anticipated in November, but future rate hikes will be gradual. During the press conference, Governor Carney said the message is not that rates will rise more rapidly, it is somewhat sooner and at a somewhat greater extent. He also notes fiscal policy has been loosened, though it will still likely be a drag over the next few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Prime Minister May reportedly told her Cabinet that she wants a bold Brexit deal that lasts a generation. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Minister Davis said EU threats on market access are &lsquo;unwise&rsquo; and &lsquo;discourteous&rsquo; and EU threat over Brexit transition is &lsquo;not in good faith&rsquo;.

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: Risk-off! Dow down 1000 points, SPX down 100 points as slump continues",
        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES:&nbsp;S&amp;P500 -3.75% at 2581, Dow Jones -4.15% at 23860, Nasdaq -3.9% at 6777</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The equity sell-off continues, with major US bourses finishing in the red for the second day, with traders remaining nervous after the recent price drop. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity futures were slightly negative -- though generally moving horizontally -- heading into the US cash open. On the open, however, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 fell, with the latter shedding 200 points. As the session wore on, the risk tone soured, piling pressure on indices.&nbsp;There was a period in quiet afternoon trade the losses were pared, but the buying interest wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to make any meaningful dent in the losses incurred over the last five sessions. Into the close, trade became choppy, with major indices extending their losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financials led the declines, closely followed by tech stocks. The defensive utilities sector was a better performer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES:&nbsp;10-Year T-Note Futures settle 3+ ticks lower at 120-28+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those seeking havens amid the risk-off mood will have been encouraged how Treasuries caught a bid amid the equity slide. As we entered NY trade, the curve was bear-steepening influenced by a decent slate of corporate supply, as well as some suggesting that the gilt sell-off post-BOE was leading fixed-income price action; but the steepness of the Treasury curve was unwound as equities fell, and havens caught a bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US auctioned $16bln in 30-year bonds, tailing by 1.2bps. The internals of the 30-year auction weren&#39;t particularly attractive: cover was softer,&nbsp;foreign takedown appears week (indirects were below recent averages), and dealers took the most since the November auction. The curve began flattening in wake if the auction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been nothing from this week&#39;s supply of 3s, 10s and 30s which suggests that there is strong demand for US paper at the higher yields seen as of late, which is demanding caution about the current &lsquo;stabilisation&rsquo; in yields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the US Treasury announced it will auction $7bln of 30-year TIPS next week.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX:&nbsp;DXY flat heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD was bid as US traders were getting into work, however, as equities were offered in afternoon trade, the havens began to rise, with USDJPY falling towards the 109.10-20 support, while USDCHF and EURCHF printed lows (at 1.1510 and 0.9390 respectively), while XAU picked up off lows, it continues to struggle with the $1320 level (strong support turned resistance).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the risk tone soured after the European close, USDJPY breached 109 temporarily, before remaining around the figure; CHF meanwhile, breached 1.15 and 0.94 (against the USD and EUR, respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After dropping yesterday (on USD strength and ECB speak from Weidmann and Nowotny) the EUR was generally traversing sideways around the 1.2250 level, looking through abundant central bank speak to trade flat at the end of US trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BOE&nbsp;reinserted guidance that if the economy grows as expected, policy will need to be tightened &quot;somewhat earlier and somewhat more than expected,&quot; putting a rocket under sterling; the pound added over a figure to trade at the 1.40 handle against the dollar, while EURGBP slumped to session lows near 0.8730 (though sterling struggled to hold on to lofty highs as the risk-tone soured in US afternoon trade).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets also began more aggressively pricing the BOE&#39;s rate trajectory, with an August hike fully priced, and the probability of a May hike up to around 70%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Antipodeans traded lower; Kiwi, which was under pressure following the RBNZ&#39;s policy meeting, where it expects the value of the NZD to ease over its forecast horizon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early European trade, USDCNH gave back some of the sharp gains printed overnight following Chinese trade data after the trade surplus narrowed on rising imports, and the PBOC fixes the yuan lower; however, the pair continued to grind higher and heads into APAC trade just off overnight highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In EMFX, the MXN was in vogue, weakening after inflation data showed that on a 12-month basis, inflation dropped sharply in January.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE:&nbsp;WTI futures settle 64 cents lower at $61.15 per barrel; Brent futures settle 70 cents lower at $64.81 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude traded a narrow range in early US trade, seemingly tracking risk sentiment lower, ultimately finding supoprt at the 55DMA around $60.70.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per yesterday&#39;s announcement, the Forties pipeline re-opened, but there was little movement in prices, given that most of the upside relating to the initial announcement of the closure was erased after yesterday&#39;s DOE inventory data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Genscape forecast for Cushing was reported to have shown a draw of 1.48mln barrels vs 2/Feb, and a draw of 1.21mln since 30/Jan, though there was no immediate impact on crude prices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In OPEC/Non-OPEC watch, Gazpromneft said&nbsp;Russian producers&#39; cooperation with OPEC cuts could last even until the first half of 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS RECAP:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BOE voted 9-0 to keep policy on hold, but made its forward guidance more aggressive, saying policy will need to be tightened somewhat earlier and somewhat more than previously expected. Governor Carney&#39;s press conference revealed little by way of new information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Dudley (voter) reiterated support for three hikes in 2018 and a March hike, if the US economy continues to grow at an above-trend level, and even said there could be scope for more than three hikes. Dudley dismissed the recent market sell-off as &quot;small potatoes&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Harker (non-voter) noted that the inflation outlook was was still an &#39;open question&#39;. Not that it matters given he is a non-voter, but Harker said he was in the two hikes camp, though if inflation and financial condition improved, he would support three hikes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter) said that 2018 will be a strong year for the US economy, though he expects that the pace of growth will ease in 2019 and 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (non-voter) was uncertain about the potential impact of tax cuts on raising wages and hiring rates. He again reiterated his dovish credentials, questioning the need for further rate hikes while the Fed is waiting for compensation inflation to rise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Weidmann argued that the recent rise in the EUR was unlikely to weigh on Eurozone expansion, adding that ECB policy should remain loose beyond the end of QE purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Praet&nbsp;says if data confirms the gradual build-up of inflationary pressures, it would not necessarily be sufficient to affirm a sustained adjustment. He also said that the ECB should be more specific on what it means by &quot;well past&quot; in its forward guidance (current guidance: &quot;we continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases&quot;), as the QE programme nears its end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Mersch and Villeroy said little by way of new information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA Governor Lowe, speaking at an aftermarket dinner, said the central bank does not see a strong case for lifting rates in the near-term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BOC&#39;s Wilkins says high household debt and NAFTA uncertainties the biggest risks to Canada economy. She notes that the quarter didn&rsquo;t get off to the best start, but is in line with expectations. The economy and consumption are expected to continue growing. On the market choppiness, she says that stock market volatility amid rising yields is to be expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banxico hiked rates by 25bps, as expected,&nbsp;citing the need to anchor inflation expectations, as well as due to expected Fed hikes. The central bank said there was an upward bias in the risks to inflation, and that unfavourable evolution of NAFTA talks pose a risk to price pressures.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK&rsquo;S TREASURY SUPPLY: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury will sell USD 68bln of new 3s (USD 28bln, Tuesday), new 10s (USD 24bln, Wednesday), and new 30s (USD 16bln, Thursday). With USD 46.6bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is seen at USD 21.4bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month&rsquo;s series of auctions comes at a key inflection point, with bonds selling-off aggressively at the beginning of the year. The 10-year note, for instance, has added c.40bps in 2018, a trend exacerbated by strong US data and hints that the Fed may lift rates more aggressively than anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>January&rsquo;s 30-year auction was very well received, with a large stop through, and stronger cover, all pointing towards healthy demand in the long-end of the Treasury curve. Of note was the participation of funds, which took their highest share since 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent positioning data shows that primary dealers have trimmed their net long positions in the 11-years+ sectors to $21.7bln (w/e 24/January), the lowest since October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SocGen&rsquo;s analysts are of the view that the current 30-year bond trades fair versus off-the-runs, when compared to the previous two auction cycles, and points out that 5s30s has steepened significantly over that horizon. Both valuations and the steepness of curve should act as positives for the auction, the bank says. Elsewhere, yields on benchmark 30s are above the previous stop-out rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, SocGen says that some concession may be required going into the auction &ldquo;as bearish momentum at the back end of the curve will likely keep investors on the sidelines.&rdquo; Other negatives include the larger auction sizes after last week&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding announcement, as well as concerns over wage inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY (JANUARY AUCTION VS SIX-AUCTION AVERAGE) VIA TD SECURITIES:</strong><br />- High-yield: 2.867% (vs six-auction average of 2.825%)<br />- Tail: Stopped-through 2.1bps (vs six-auction stopping-through of 0.5bps)<br />- Bid-to-cover: 2.74x (vs six-auction average of 2.42x)<br />- Dealers: 21.2% (vs six-auction average of 28.5%)<br />- Directs: 7.3% (vs six-auction average of 7.6%)<br />- Indirects: 71.5% (vs six-auction average of 63.9%)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>An arguably more hawkish than expected message from the BoE, and not much in the way of tweaking in the ensuing QIR press conference or Q&amp;A prompted a sharp Gbp rebound, with Cable up around 100 pips instantly before extending gains above the 1.4000 level to circa 1.4065 at one stage (through 1.4040 near term resistance), significantly more than the 120 pip break-even implied by break-even option volatility. Specifically, the MPC stated that inflation could exceed 3% again and given better than forecast economic developments since the previous QIR it may need to normalise policy somewhat faster and more than envisaged last November. Consequently, even Eur/Gbp that had been trending higher on heightened UK political-Brexit concerns pulled back below 0.8800 and just under 0.8750. Meanwhile, another Wall Street wobble has seen Jpy and Chf safe-havens regain some allure to trade down from 109.80 and 0.9470 respective session peaks vs the Usd, and the DXY slip back from 90.500 at best towards 90.000 again. Usd/Cad just held below a serious of key chart Fib levels ahead and a little over 1.2600 after mixed Canadian housing data (starts beat, but prices missed) and ahead of a speech by BoC Governor Wilkins. The Aud and Nzd remained laggards in the G10 space, around 0.7800 and 0.7200 vs the Greenback (and other major peers) respectively, with RBA Governor Lowe seeing no pressing need to hike rates anytime soon and the RNBZ keeping policy options open, albeit base case a hike in mid-2019.</p>\r\n",

The vote was unanimous on rates as well as on asset purchase programs, highlighting that the BoE is currently still comfortably in wait and see mode. We now look forward to&nbsp;the May inflation report to discuss the next steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bank Rate was left unchanged at 50bp in February, following the increase last November.&nbsp;This was widely expected (all of the 58 economists surveyed by Bloomberg last week, including us, expected no change). The vote regarding rates was unanimous (9-0) in favor of the&nbsp;<em>status quo</em>. The vote regarding the stock of the Asset Purchase Facility program was unanimous (9-0) for the&nbsp;<em>status quo,</em>&nbsp;and accordingly it was left unchanged at &pound;435bn for UK gilts. The vote regarding the corporate bond purchase program was also unanimous (9-0) for the&nbsp;<em>status quo,</em>&nbsp;and it was left unchanged at &pound;10bn for non-financial GBP investment-grade corporate bonds. A unanimous vote was also largely (if not unanimously) expected by the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minutes show the MPC upbeat regarding the outlook for the economy.&nbsp;In line with upside revision of its growth forecast the MPC also toughened its rhetoric regarding inflation highlighting inflationary risks stemming from the labour market as it presented the results of its annual review of supply side conditions. With its new equilibrium unemployment rate at 4.25% and trend growth at 1,5%, it believes spare capacity is &ldquo;very limited&rdquo;. Such stronger confidence in the economy also translates into a further diminished growth/inflation trade off, and a greater inclination when setting monetary policy to consider a &ldquo;more conventional horizon&rdquo; for inflation to return to target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We now look at the 22 March MPC to bring more insights and clarify the MPC view regarding the appropriateness of market expectations. In today&rsquo;s statement, the MPC judged that rates might have to increase &ldquo;somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November Report&rdquo;. While that seems to point towards a hike in August, the BoE could also consider a hike in May but would then need to argue much more convincingly that the British economic and political backdrop supports such a step change.</p>\r\n",

Any future increases are expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inflation: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is possible that inflation could rise temporarily back above 3% and is expected to remain around 3% in the short term. The pass through of the past GBP depreciation was likely to make a positive but diminishing contribution over the forecast period. Recent rise in global oil prices meant that the projected fall in inflation was more gradual than anticipated in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There were risks to the inflation outlook in both directions</strong>. Upside risks include: momentum in global growth, tightness of domestic labour market. Downside risks include: business survey indicators of output weakened, housing and retail sales data softened, net trade impact from global growth could be lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Demand and Supply Growth: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK has only a <strong>very limited degree of slack</strong> and supply capacity will grow only modestly over the forecast period, averaging around 1.5% per year. GDP growth is expected to average 1.75% over the forecast period and a small margin of <strong>excess demand emerges by 2020</strong> and builds thereafter. Risks around the projection for GDP growth are skewed to the upside, stemming from the upside risks to global growth. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Labour Market: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pay growth is expected to rise further</strong> in response to the tightening labour market. Surveys of hiring intentions remained firm. Long term equilibrium rate of unemployment is slightly lower than that judged a year ago at around 4.25%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Brexit: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developments regarding <strong>Brexit remain the most significant influence on and source of uncertainty about the UK economic outlook. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Projections assume that, in the interim, households and companies base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to the eventual trading relationship with the EU. Since the Committee&rsquo;s previous meeting, indicators of corporate and household confidence had not reacted significantly to the progress made in the first phase of Article 50 negotiations. Brexit related effects appear to have weighed on investment plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conditioning path for GBP underpinning February&rsquo;s projections was around 3% higher than that contained in November&rsquo;s report, primarily reflecting a pronounced weakening in the USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Housing Market:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>December saw a drop in mortgage approvals but it is unclear how much of a signal should be taken from this for the broader outlook. House price inflation had been a little stronger than expected. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reinvestment:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Committee agreed to reinvest GBP 18.3bln of cash flows relating to the redemptions of March 2018 gilt held by the APF.</p>\r\n",

Nzd/Usd has pared some losses to trade back over 0.7200</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Looking ahead, highlights include the BoE rate decision and a slew of speakers including ECB&rsquo;s Villeroy, BoE Governor Carney, Fed&rsquo;s Harker, Fed&rsquo;s Kashkari, BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins </strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian equity markets traded mixed with the region somewhat cautious following the subdued lead from Wall St. where price action was choppy and all majors closed in the red. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.2%)</strong> was lower for most of the day as weakness in the commodity complex weighed on mining names, and with industry giant Rio Tinto also pressured after investors bought the rumour and sold on the news of a strong earnings report. However, the index then gradually pared losses as strong Chinese Imports provided some encouragement. Elsewhere, <strong>Nikkei 225 (+1.1%)</strong> outperformed with corporate earnings back in the limelight, while <strong>Hang Seng (+0.4%) </strong>and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%)</strong> ignored strong trade data and were indecisive after the PBoC skipped open market operations for the 11th consecutive occasion, and with heavy losses seen across the big 4 banks in the mainland. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally lower with demand subdued amid gains in Japanese risk assets, while the 30yr JGB auction also failed to provide support despite increased demand and higher accepted prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations and was net neutral on the day. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.2822 (Prev. 6.2882)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chinese Trade Balance (CNY)(Jan) 135.80B vs. Exp. 330.00B (Prev. 361.98B).

Williams added that recent market turmoil has not changed policy or economic outlook and that the economy can clearly cope with gradual rate hikes. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan says sees slower growth in 2019 and 2020; says 2018 will be a strong year for the US economy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Weidmann says EUR appreciation is unlikely to weigh on expansion, adding that ECB policy should remain loose beyond QE.

In terms of sector specifics, the financial sector is the outperformer with earnings from the likes of <strong>Commerzbank (+2.4%), SocGen (+4.1%), UniCredit (+2.6%) </strong>and<strong> Zurich Insurance (+3.8%)</strong> lifting the sector with <strong>Swiss Re (+3.8%)</strong> also lending a helping hand near the top of the SMI after news that Softbank could acquire a stake in the Co. Elsewhere,<strong> GSK (+2.3%)</strong> has been supported by news that Novartis&rsquo; launch of their Advair copy will be delayed.

        "content": "<p><strong>ANZ: </strong>The RBNZ maintained the OCR at 1.75% as universally expected. Recent developments were acknowledged with plenty of changes in the language, but the broad spirit of its assessment is unchanged. It is a case of lots of moving parts largely cancelling each other out. The RBNZ remains cautious - especially with regards to the inflation outlook &ndash; and reinforces that &ldquo;numerous uncertainties remain&rdquo;. The RBNZ&rsquo;s forecasts imply hikes from around mid-to-late 2019. It is a view we share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASB:</strong> The new Government is bringing a greater focus on economic and environmental sustainability, and the RBNZ has taken this to heart in a Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) that recycles the policy bias and interest rate forecasts from its November MPS.No-one will have been surprised the RBNZ kept the Official Cash Rate on hold. The interest was more in how the RBNZ would interpret the implications of extensive upward revisions to the past three years of growth, as well as the recent weak inflation outcome. On the back of the extensive upward growth revisions published late last year, the RBNZ has revised up its &lsquo;speed limit&rsquo; for economic growth, one contributor to the RBNZ&rsquo;s slightly lower inflation outlook for 2018 and 2019. But as the RBNZ&rsquo;s forecasts stand, the RBNZ still has inflation comfortably tracking close to the 2% target mid-point from June 2019. On the back of that, the RBNZ&rsquo;s outlook for interest rates hasn&rsquo;t changed: low for a considerable period. But, also, there were no overt concerns that inflation may need another nudge higher from further OCR cuts. As we finalise our own Quarterly Forecasts, a clear theme of inflation remaining lower for longer is emerging. There is some risk that the first OCR hike may come later than our long-held view of February 2019. There is a lot of water to run under the bridge anyway until the RBNZ needs to lift interest rates: a new Governor, an added monetary policy objective, and the continued bedding in of a new government and fine-tuning of what that means for future inflation pressures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BNZ: </strong>We see no need to change our view that the RBNZ starts raising interest rates in February 2019 and then it moves relatively aggressively. However, we equally concede that there are multiple risks around our hypothesis. In addition to economic developments, we will have a new RBNZ Governor for the next Monetary Policy Statement and, potentially, a very different Policy Targets Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Westpac:</strong> As expected, the RBNZ left the OCR unchanged and repeated its neutral guidance for the OCR outlook. However, the RBNZ&rsquo;s thinking has become more dovish, with a downgrade to the inflation outlook. The RBNZ still expects to keep the OCR unchanged until around mid-2019, before gradually lifting interest rates. The RBNZ&rsquo;s GDP forecasts still look too optimistic to us. We expect the recent plunge in business confidence combined with a housing market slowdown will lead to slower GDP growth in 2018 than the RBNZ expects. Consequently, we think the risks are tilted towards later OCR hikes than the RBNZ is currently planning.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "FX Morning Colour: RBNZ ruffles the Kiwi’s feathers, BoJ jolts the Jpy",
        "content": "<p>Nzd/Usd has pared some losses to trade back over 0.7200 from a circa 0.7175 low overnight after the RBNZ stood pat on rates as widely expected, but surprised with a broadly dovish accompanying statement and additional comments projecting a further downturn in the Kiwi on a TWI basis. While maintaining guidance for tightening from Q2 next year, Governor Spencer and his assistant McDermott cautioned that the next move could be a cut or hike. Hence, the Aud/Nzd cross has rebounded above 1.0800 again and almost touched 1.0900 at one stage, as Aud/Usd keeps its head above 0.7800 just ahead of a speech by RBA chief Lowe. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy has climbed towards the top of a broad 109.00-110.00 range amidst a renewed pledge from BoJ head Kuroda to continue with powerful QE to achieve price stability as it remains some way from reaching the inflation target. Eur/Usd has also broken out from recent trading parameters, partly on ECB claims that the US is keeping the Dollar weak, but mainly as the Greenback gleans more of a yield advantage. The headline pair has bounced in advance of a series of key chart supports in the 1.2222-27 area, but may not get close to decent option expiry strikes between 1.2300-10 (1.35 bn). Sterling is holding up relatively well in the run up to a potentially more hawkish BoE post-meeting QIR with Cable above 1.3850 and Eur/Gbp sub-0.8850 vs 0.8900 and over of late. Note, option pricing suggests a big market move on the event, 120 pips either way.&nbsp;Usd/Cad still hovering just below 1.2600 as Canadian President Trudeau repeats that no NAFTA deal is better than the wrong one, while Usd/Chf is sitting near the top of a higher 0.9425-50 band having pushed through strong tech resistance at the lower end. Usd/Cny has bounced firmly on a much smaller than forecast Chinese trade surplus and reports about relaxed capital controls &ndash; hence the DXY has rallied above 90.000 and as far as 90.500.</p>\r\n",

Another relatively weak US auction, hawkish Fed comments from December rate hike dissenter Evans and a 2 year budget proposal that would lift the debt ceiling and increase spending by some Usd300 bn all combined to undermine Treasuries, with the curve bear-steepening ahead of the final leg of this week&rsquo;s refunding. Although Wall Street failed to maintain its recovery momentum USTs decoupled from their inverse asset correlation and yields are back probing the peaks seen in wake of last Friday&rsquo;s NFP data, with the long bond now firmly above 3% and perhaps enticing enough to draw stronger investor demand for the 30 year issue.

The auction of 10s follows the soft auction of 3s on Tuesday; markets were keeping an eye out to see if current yields are at attractive levels for investors to step in, arresting the sharp rise in yields witnessed recently; however, evidence of this remains to be seen.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed with the region somewhat cautious following the subdued lead from Wall St. where price action was choppy and all majors closed in the red. ASX 200 (-0.2%) is subdued as weakness in the commodity complex weighs on mining names, and with industry giant Rio Tinto also pressured after investors bought the rumour and sold on the news of a strong earnings report. Conversely, Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) has weathered a firmer JPY to trade higher with corporate earnings taking back the limelight, while Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) are varied amid indecision ahead of Chinese trade data and with the PBoC net neutral on the day after an 11<sup>th</sup> skip in open market operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD holds on to the majority of the prior day&rsquo;s yield-driven gains, although its major counterparts are off worst levels with GBP/USD attempting a reclaim of the 1.3900 handle. NZD was also a notable mover with pressure from the RBNZ rate decision in which the central bank kept rates unchanged at 1.75% as expected and stated that it assumes NZD will ease over its forecast horizon. Furthermore, the central bank also commented that policy will remain accommodative for a considerable period and maintained its forecast to begin raising rates during Q2 next year, although Governor Spencer and Assistant Governor McDermott both kept all options on the table and suggested that the next rate move could either be a cut or hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally lower with demand subdued amid gains in Japanese risk assets and with participants sidelined ahead of a 30yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
