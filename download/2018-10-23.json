(The Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May reportedly held a cabinet meeting that some noted as &lsquo;impassioned&rsquo; while others described it to have been a row, in which several ministers insisted she negotiate a time limit to any Brexit backstop and reports noted increases the pressure to achieve a deal she can sell to her own party. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May spokesman said that any circumstance in which Northern Ireland could be in a separate customs treaty from the UK is unacceptable, while it was separately reported that the UK was said to be drawing up plans to charter ships to bring in emergency food and medicines in the event of a no-deal Brexit. (Newswires/FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was earlier reported that the EU will offer PM May a UK wide customs arrangement but that it will require a separate treaty. (RTE)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Dombrovskis said the EU Commission has rejected Italy&#39;s draft budget and asked for revised plans in three weeks.<br />Furthermore, he stated that Italy&#39;s clarifications on the 2019 draft from Monday are not convincing and that the Italian budget is openly and consciously going against past commitments made, while he added Italy cannot &#39;cure debt with more debt&#39;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian PM Conte said 2.4% deficit/GDP goal for 2019 &quot;will not be touched at the moment&quot;, while the Italian Treasury said EU rejection was expected, that they want constructive dialogue with the EU and will reply within the 3-week timetable.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said OPEC&#39;s current policy bias was to &quot;produce as much as you can&quot; to reassure customers that the cartel and its partners can meet &quot;any demand that materialises.&quot;, while he added that the Saudis were able to ramp up production to 12mln BPD within three months from current levels of around 10.7mln. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said Saudi Arabia have been a good ally to the US and will leave consequences for Saudi Arabia up to congress in consultation with him. Furthermore, US Secretary of State Pompeo said will revoke visas for those identified as responsible for killing journalist Khashoggi and that it would not be the last step but added shared strategic interests with Saudi Arabia remain, while Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said to stay tuned regarding Canada&#39;s arms exports to Saudi Arabia. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said the 10% tax cut for the middle class will be revenue neutral and that the tax cut will not impact corporation taxes, while Ways and Means Chair Brady said he will begin work in the coming weeks to develop Trump&#39;s 10% middle class tax cut and that the tax cut plan will be advanced if Republicans retain control of the House and Senate in the November midterm elections. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bostic (voter, dove) said possible headwinds are not throwing the economy or the Fed off track and that unless data surprises to the downside, the Fed should continue its gradual rate increases a &quot;few&quot; more times. Bostic added he would favour a fourth rate hike this year and that Q3 GDP made him more comfortable for a hike. (Newswires)<br /><br />Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, dove) reiterated the Fed should gradually raise rates towards neutral which he estimates is in the lower half of 2.5%-3.5%, while he added wage pressures are building but does not see runaway inflation and is mindful of the US dollar&#39;s rise as the Fed lifts rates. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earnings reports today saw a wide spread of winners and losers with McDonald&rsquo;s (MCD) and Verizon (VZ) moving higher after beating EPS estimates as well as showing strong growth, whereas industrial bellwether Caterpillar (CAT) fell sharply despite earnings and revenue beats, with newswires attributing the weakness to a failure for CAT to raise its 2018 earnings forecast; 3M (MMM) was also in the red after cutting its full year profit forecasts. Homebuilder PulteGroup (PHM) traded higher after strong earnings which spread optimism into the wider industry with Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) also both up on the day. The energy sector lead losses today on the back of a slide in oil prices, with stocks such as Marathon Oil (MRO), Phillips 66 (PSX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) all down on the day. SPX -0.56% at 2741, NDX -0.32% at 7119, DJI -0.50% at 25191.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury sold $38bln of 2-year notes, stopping through by 0.1bps, and the highest yield at a 2s auction since 2008. Cover was slightly softer than recent averages, but the internals were encouraging, with indirect takedown the highest since December 2016 and above recent averages, and directs taking the lowest since August 2009. Some analysts noted that the strength of the auction might have been partly due to weakness in the equities complex. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 8+ ticks at 118-8+.</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, pressure on UK PM May softened after BBC reported 48 letters threshold to trigger a confidence vote had not been reached; yesterday it was suggested that more MPs would be submitting letters of no confidence to the 1922 Backbench Committee. A spokesperson confirmed UK PM May is to appear before the Committee of Backbench conservative lawmakers on Wednesday evening, and noted that the PM requested to address the committee, she was not summoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>As widely expected, the EU Commission took the unprecedented action of requesting Italy resubmit its 2019 budget draft; Italy now has three weeks to revise the fiscal plan. EU&#39;s Dombrovskis said that Italy&#39;s clarifications on the draft from Monday were not convincing, adding that the budget is openly and consciously going against past commitments made on the budget. In response, Italy&#39;s Deputy PM Di Maio said they could not continue with past policies given the damage they caused, and asked the EU commission to treat Italians and their government with respect. In recent days Italy has positioned itself to be willing to talk to EU officials on the budget, but have seemed reticent in backing away from the budget&rsquo;s 2.4% deficit/GDP ratio, which PM Conte on Tuesday said &quot;will not be touched at the moment&quot;. Elsewhere, La Stampa reported the country is hopeful the ECB will purchase their securities if necessary, after the ECB announced a few weeks ago it would not come to Italy&rsquo;s rescue if the government and banks run out of cash unless the EU bailout is in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>NEC Director Kudlow said US President Trump and Chinese President Xi will meet at G20 in Argentina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TAX REFORM: </strong>US President Trump says the 10% tax cut for the middle class will be revenue neutral; says tax cut will not impact corporation taxes. NEC director Kudlow said new tax cuts are in planning stage and probably to be introduced after the elections. Ways and Means Chair Brady says he will begin work in the coming weeks to develop Trump&#39;s 10% middle class tax cut; adding that the tax cut plan will be advanced if Republicans retain control of the House and Senate in the November midterm elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Bostic (voter, dove) appeared in favour of a fourth rate hike this year, stating that Q3 GDP has made him more comfortable. He once again endorsed a gradual path of rate hikes, and said the central bank should lift rates &ldquo;a few&rdquo; more times. Bostic noted that headwinds are not throwing the economy or the Fed off-track, and suggested that the Fed should stick to its course unless data surprises to the downside. Ahead of this week&rsquo;s Q3 GDP data, Bostic said he expected strong growth in Q3, which signals the US may have shifted into a higher gear; Bostic added that the Fed should guard against allowing the economy to run too hot. Fed&#39;s Kaplan (dove, non-voter) reiterated the Fed should gradually raise rates towards neutral, his neutral estimate is in the lower half of the Fed&#39;s 2.5%-3.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.56% at 2741, NDX -0.32% at 7119, DJI -0.50% at 25191. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -2.68%, Materials -1.16%, Industrials -1.61%, Cons Discretionary -0.11%, Cons Staples +0.41%, Healthcare -1.27%, Financials -0.82%, Tech -0.40%, Telecoms +0.40%, Utilities -0.52%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Earnings reports today saw a wide spread of winners and losers with McDonald&rsquo;s (MCD) and Verizon (VZ) moving higher after beating EPS estimates as well as showing strong growth, whereas industrial bellwether Caterpillar (CAT) fell sharply despite earnings and revenue beats, with newswires attributing the weakness to a failure for CAT to raise its 2018 earnings forecast; 3M (MMM) was also in the red after cutting its full year profit forecasts. Homebuilder PulteGroup (PHM) traded higher after strong earnings which spread optimism into the wider industry with Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) also both up on the day. The energy sector lead losses today on the back of a slide in oil prices, with stocks such as Marathon Oil (MRO), Phillips 66 (PSX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) all down on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 2.93 LOWER AT USD 66.43/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 3.39 LOWER AT USD 76.44/BBL. </strong>Crude was tracking the weakness in risk sentiment in early European trade, before the Saudi energy minister Al Falih came on the wires stating that OPEC&#39;s current policy bias was to &quot;produce as much as you can&quot; to reassure customers that the cartel and its partners can meet &quot;any demand that materialises.&quot; Al Falih also added that the Saudis were able to ramp up production to 12mln BPD within three months, from current levels around 10.7mln, and his comments injected more selling impetus into the crude complex. In the US afternoon, crude continued tracking risk sentiment, though struggled to see upticks despite equites seeing some buying action. After the bell, the API reports inventory data ahead of Wednesday&#39;s DOE inventory data; analysts expect crude +3.7mln, Cushing +1.1mln, distillate -1.9mln, and gasoline -1.9mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 8+ TICKS AT 118-8+. </strong>The US Treasury sold $38bln of 2-year notes, stopping through by 0.1bps, and the highest yield at a 2s auction since 2008. Cover was slightly softer than recent averages, but the internals were encouraging, with indirect takedown the highest since December 2016 and above recent averages, and directs taking the lowest since August 2009. Some analysts noted that the strength of the auction might have been partly due to weakness in the equities complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 5-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The last 5-year auction saw a tail of 0.5bps, the largest this year. &ldquo;While this could suggest some investor caution, allotments showed a pickup in foreign buying despite a decline in investment fund takedowns,&rdquo; TD Securities says, &ldquo;while averages suggest a stop on the screws, we see the potential for a modest tail,&rdquo; the bank adds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> Extending relative gains amidst ongoing risk aversion, with Usd/Jpy chipping away at hefty bids said to be sitting between 112.00-10 after topping out just below yesterday&rsquo;s peaks overnight and ahead of 113.00 before consolidating around 112.50. To recap, stops were tripped in early EU trade through 112.25 and 112.20, while Eur/Jpy and Aud/Jpy are also maintaining bearish momentum towards the next round number/psychological levels at 128.00 and 79.00 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Off best levels as Cable lost momentum just ahead of 1.3050, but still holding up better than other G10 amidst broad risk-off sentiment/flows on the back of latest Brexit reports chiming with recent talk that the EU may be willing to offer the UK and nation-wide customs union deal via a separate treaty from the main withdrawal agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The single currency is also retreating from recovery highs after fading before 1.1500 and hefty option expiry interest from the big figure to 1.1520 in 1.4 bn, as the EU formally rejected Italy&rsquo;s budget proposal and requested a resubmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>All softer vs their US peer amidst the deterioration in risk appetite that has nudged the DXY back up towards 96.000 from a low around 95.820 at one stage. Aud/Usd is only just holding above 0.7050 and the Kiwi has temporary slipped below 0.6550 after the NY cut when a 450mn expiry rolled off, with the focus now switching to NZ trade data on Wednesday. The Loonie is also looking at tomorrow&rsquo;s agenda for independent impetus and withstanding a deeper pull-back in crude prices on the premise that the BoC will deliver a 25 bp hike &ndash; Usd/Cad just below 1.3100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRY: </strong>The biggest EM loser among widespread losses across the region and undermined by multiple negatives ranging from renewed political instability after the nationalist opposition party cut ties with its current AK allies to weaker consumer sentiment and a rise in the Dollar FX RRR ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s CBRT policy meet. The Lira has pared some declines to circa 5.8000 but remains closer to lows vs the Usd than highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: </strong>BOC RATE DECISION due on Wednesday 24 October at 1500 BST/1000 EST; press conference with Gov Poloz and Dep Gov Wilkins scheduled for 1615 BST/1115 EST. BOC expected to lift rates by 25bps to 1.75%, retain language that further rates rises will be warranted, and retain its data-dependency. Recent economic activity has generally been positive relative to the BOC&#39;s July forecasts, and uncertainty has diminished significantly following the USMCA trade agreement. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20373/download\">Click here to access the full RAN squawk Preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: </strong>RIKSBANK RATE DECISION due on Wednesday 24th October at 0830BST/0330EDT and Press Conference at 1000BST/0500EDT. The Riksbank is unanimously expected to maintain interest rates at -0.5%, according to 18 Reuters economists polled. Analysts expect the purchase programme to also be untouched, while the language in the statement is predicted to be similar to that of the last meeting. Governor Ingves and the Head of Monetary Policy Department Hansson will participate in the press conference due to start at 1000BST/0500EDT. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20375/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk Preview.</a></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 127bln in 2-year (USD 38bln, Tuesday), 5-year (USD 39bln, Wednesday), 7-year (USD 31bln, Thursday), as well a 2-year FRN (USD 19bln, Wednesday). With around USD 110.7bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, the auctions will raise USD 16.3bln in new cash, TD Securities notes; the bank also points out that the Fed&#39;s balance sheet run-off will get into full swing this month, with the cap rising to USD 30bln (though USD 23.8bln in Fed holdings will mature), and TD says that the Fed will therefore allow the entire amount to run off and will not add on to any auctions this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> Recent auctions in the 2-year have come in near the 1pm when-issued yield, though the previous auction saw a larger tail due to foreign participation falling to approximately half the typical average at 6.6%, and as such, analysts and traders will be keeping an eye on foreign demand, which if it raises back towards typical levels, could provide support. The recent move higher in yields has certainly made investors nervous, but has also increased the attractiveness of short-dated Treasuries,&quot; TD Securities writes. &quot;We view 2-year Treasury yields in the vicinity of 3% as attractive from a longer-term perspective, particularly with the market already pricing in 80% odds of a December hike, two more hikes in 2019 and a terminal funds rate around 2.9%.&quot; TD also believes that the front-end and belly of the curve &quot;similarly look attractive amid the recent backup in rates.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>High-yield: prev. 2.829% vs 6-auction average of 2.628%</li>\r\n  <li>Tail: prev. 0.3bps vs 6-auction average of 0.1bps</li>\r\n  <li>Bid/cover: prev. 2.44x vs 6-auction average of 2.75x</li>\r\n  <li>Dealers: prev. 46.6% vs 6-auction average of 43.4%</li>\r\n  <li>Direct: prev. 13.4% vs 6-auction average of 14.6%</li>\r\n  <li>Indirect: prev. 40.0% vs 6-auction average of 42.0%</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.05%) was dragged lower by weakness across the large industries including financials, energy and resources, while Nikkei 225 (-2.67%) slumped as Japanese exporters suffered the ill-effects of a firmer currency. Hang Seng (-3.08%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.26%) conformed to the downbeat tone as buying in the mainland eased following the prior day&rsquo;s over 4% rally, while US equity futures declined alongside their Asian peers with pressure exacerbated as the E-mini S&amp;P broke below US session lows around the 2750.00 level. Finally, 10yr JGBs were quiet and only marginally benefitted from the downbeat risk tone, while the enhanced-liquidity auction for 10yr, 20yr and 30yr JGBs failed to spur any meaningful demand with the b/c unchanged from the prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 120bln via 7-day reverse repos.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All major European indices are drowning in a sea of red as sentiment continues from Asia amid trade woes and growing concerns surrounding Saudi and the West; Germany&#39;s DAX (-2.1%) is lagging its peers, largely due to downside in Bayer (-8.0%) after a US judge affirmed a verdict in regards the weed-killer which was linked to cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key sectors are broadly in the red, with IT (-3.8%) the lagging index, significantly weighed on by Atos (-22.4%) following a cut to their financial year growth guidance. Meanwhile, AMS (-27.0%) slumped amid earnings, with the likes of STMicroelectronics (-4.8%), Infeneon (-5.0%) and Wirecard (-5.8%) dragged lower in sympathy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The standout G10 outperformer on safe-haven grounds, with Usd/Jpy retreating further from Monday&rsquo;s near 112.90 highs towards 112.25 where stops are anticipated down to 112.20 and Jpy crosses also trending lower again as big figure levels give way (like 129.00 vs the Eur and 80.00 vs the Aud).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - A sterling effort to avoid another leg-down and loss of a round number, as Cable rebounds firmly from sub-1.2950 lows to retest 1.3000 with the aid of reported model buying around 1.2985. However, the Pound remains precarious and prone to further Brexit-related pressure, as Eur/Gbp hovers above 0.8800 having broken above a couple of Mas yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi is also relatively resilient to broad risk aversion and hovering around 0.6650 vs its US counterpart, albeit partly on favourable cross-flows again as AUD/Nzd remains capped around 1.0800 and the Aud loses 0.7100 support alongside ongoing weakness in the Yuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/EUR - Both pretty flat vs the Greenback, as the Loonie clings to 1.3100 ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC policy meeting and an almost unanimously expected 25 bp hike, while the single currency saw dip-buying interest around 1.1440, ahead of a cluster of downside technical levels (1.1422-33 encompasses a double bottom and Fib) to trade back over 1.1450 awaiting the EU&rsquo;s official ruling on Italy&rsquo;s 2019 fiscal plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Lira has lost more of its recent recovery momentum on a mixture of factors including a move from the CBRT ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s rate meeting to raise the RRR on Usd, renewed political uncertainty following the national party announcing that it will not continue its AK party allowance and a further deterioration in consumer confidence. Usd/Try just off near 5.8700 highs, but still significantly above lows circa 5.6670.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent are both in the red with prices currently hovering under USD 68.50/bbl and USD 78.50/bbl respectively, this price dip comes as Saudi Arabia pledges to be responsible in energy markets removing some of the market&rsquo;s risk sentiment ahead of the step-up in Iranian sanctions. Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih later said supply and demand have uncertainties but the oil market is in a good position now and they will continue to monitor it. Traders will be keeping an eye on the latest release of the weekly API crude inventories due later today. Of interest, Saudi Arabia are planning to sign deals worth more than USD 50bln in oil, gas, industries and infrastructure sectors during today&rsquo;s Riyadh investment conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is trading with gains in excess of 1% amid safe haven flows due to political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Western countries. Elsewhere, China&rsquo;s alumina exports for September have increased by over 5 times to 165.8k tonnes compared to August. Separately, world refined copper market showed a 47k tonnes deficit in July vs. June&rsquo;s deficit of 38k tonnes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih said the oil market is in a good place now and will continue to monitor the oil market, but supply and demand have their uncertainties. Al-Falih sees a lot of output decline in many regions and does not rule out that Saudi output is going to be 1-2mln BPD higher. He said that the nation will be able to produce 12mln bpd of oil in less than three months. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia plans to sign deals worth more than USD 50bln in oil, gas, industries and infrastructures sectors on Tuesday during the investment conference in Riyadh. The companies include: Trafigura, Total, Hyundai, Norinco, Schlumberger, Haliburton and Baker Hughes; according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran said they are not concerned about maintaining oil production. Iranian Oil Minister said the country&#39;s oil exports cannot be stopped and sanctions on Iran will keep the market volatile (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much additional movement or price action in EU bonds, but Bunds and Gilts did slip to fresh lows on Eurex and Liffe, at 159.43 and 121.63 (+9 and +7 ticks vs +29 and +32 ticks at the earlier intraday peaks), as BTPs extended their topside to 121.62 (+77 ticks vs -68 ticks at one stage). However, the latter have subsequently drifted back towards 121.00 awaiting the EU verdict and core 10 year benchmarks have ticked back up in response. Conversely, US Treasuries have rallied quite sharply to post new overnight session peaks and the curve has flattened considerably amidst the downturn in global stocks and risk sentiment, with perhaps an element of pre-2 year issuance positioning also impacting.</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, AMS (-28.3%) slumped amid earnings, with the likes of STMicroelectronics (-5.9%), Infeneon (-5.7%) and Wirecard (-6.1%) dragged lower in sympathy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The standout G10 outperformer on safe-haven grounds, with Usd/Jpy retreating further from Monday&rsquo;s near 112.90 highs towards 112.25 where stops are anticipated down to 112.20 and Jpy crosses also trending lower again as big figure levels give way (like 129.00 vs the Eur and 80.00 vs the Aud).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - A sterling effort to avoid another leg-down and loss of a round number, as Cable rebounds firmly from sub-1.2950 lows to retest 1.3000 with the aid of reported model buying around 1.2985. However, the Pound remains precarious and prone to further Brexit-related pressure, as Eur/Gbp hovers above 0.8800 having broken above a couple of Mas yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi is also relatively resilient to broad risk aversion and hovering around 0.6650 vs its US counterpart, albeit partly on favourable cross-flows again as AUD/Nzd remains capped around 1.0800 and the Aud loses 0.7100 support alongside ongoing weakness in the Yuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/EUR - Both pretty flat vs the Greenback, as the Loonie clings to 1.3100 ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC policy meeting and an almost unanimously expected 25 bp hike, while the single currency saw dip-buying interest around 1.1440, ahead of a cluster of downside technical levels (1.1422-33 encompasses a double bottom and Fib) to trade back over 1.1450 awaiting the EU&rsquo;s official ruling on Italy&rsquo;s 2019 fiscal plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Lira has lost more of its recent recovery momentum on a mixture of factors including a move from the CBRT ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s rate meeting to raise the RRR on Usd, renewed political uncertainty following the national party announcing that it will not continue its AK party allowance and a further deterioration in consumer confidence. Usd/Try just off near 5.8700 highs, but still significantly above lows circa 5.6670.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much additional movement or price action in EU bonds, but Bunds and Gilts did slip to fresh lows on Eurex and Liffe, at 159.43 and 121.66 (+9 and +10 ticks vs +29 and +32 ticks at the earlier intraday peaks), as BTPs extended their topside to 121.62 (+77 ticks vs -68 ticks at one stage). However, the latter have subsequently drifted back towards 121.00 awaiting the EU verdict and core 10 year benchmarks have ticked back up in response. Conversely, US Treasuries have rallied quite sharply to post new overnight session peaks and the curve has flattened considerably amidst the downturn in global stocks and risk sentiment, with perhaps an element of pre-2 year issuance positioning also impacting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent are both in the red with prices currently hovering under USD 68.50/bbl and USD 78.50/bbl respectively, this price dip comes as Saudi Arabia pledges to be responsible in energy markets removing some of the market&rsquo;s risk sentiment ahead of the step-up in Iranian sanctions. Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih later said supply and demand have uncertainties but the oil market is in a good position now and they will continue to monitor it. Traders will be keeping an eye on the latest release of the weekly API crude inventories due later today. Of interest, Saudi Arabia are planning to sign deals worth more than USD 50bln in oil, gas, industries and infrastructure sectors during today&rsquo;s Riyadh investment conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is trading with gains in excess of 1% amid safe haven flows due to political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Western countries. Elsewhere, China&rsquo;s alumina exports for September have increased by over 5 times to 165.8k tonnes compared to August. Separately, world refined copper market showed a 47k tonnes deficit in July vs. June&rsquo;s deficit of 38k tonnes.</p>\r\n",

The 10 year bond has been as high as 121.88 vs its 121.56 previous Liffe settlement, but currently consolidating off a 121.69 base alongside retreating Bunds (+12 ticks at 159.46 vs +29 ticks at best), as Italian BTPs reverse earlier losses between 120.15-121.54 parameters amidst reports that the Government will tweak its deficit target if markets react negatively. Back to Liffe, 3 month contracts are also off peaks, but still firm at 1-2 ticks above parity ahead of the CBI&rsquo;s October trends survey, BoE speeches and DMO linker supply.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were pressured by the safe-haven flows, while high-beta currencies were mixed with antipodeans subdued by the risk-averse environment and with CAD resilient ahead of a widely anticipated BoC rate hike this week which markets are pricing in a 97% probability of occurring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities lacked any major catalysts overnight which was evident in prices with WTI crude futures subdued and in proximity to retest the 69.00/bbl level to the downside. Furthermore, yesterday saw the expiry of the November contract, while focus shifts to this week&rsquo;s inventory releases beginning with the API report in US after-market. Elsewhere, attempts by gold to nurse losses were restricted as the greenback held on to recent gains and copper prices reflected the subdued risk sentiment in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he is not satisfied with what he has heard from Saudi Arabia but does not want to lose investment, while he later commented that there are many possible penalties for Saudi Arabia.

US T-note futures (Z8) settled 1+ ticks higher at 118-00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said his administration will be doing a resolution for a 10% tax cut for middle income earners, while US President Trump later said that drug prices will soon plunge. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland said US steel and aluminium tariffs are &lsquo;unjustified and illegal&rsquo;, while Mexican Deputy Economy Minister said he is confident a deal can be struck with the US and Canada on steel tariffs soon. Furthermore, the Mexican Deputy Economy Minister said Mexico hasn&#39;t ruled out all possible actions against Canada vis-a-vis steel tariffs including going to the WTO. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.9%) was dragged lower by weakness across the large industries including financials, energy and resources, while Nikkei 225 (-2.4%) slumped as Japanese exporters suffered the ill-effects of a firmer currency. Hang Seng (-2.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%) conformed to the downbeat tone as buying in the mainland eased following the prior day&rsquo;s over 4% rally, while US equity futures declined alongside their Asian peers with pressure exacerbated as the Emini S&amp;P broke below US session lows around the 2750.00 level. Finally, 10yr JGBs were quiet and only marginally benefitted from the downbeat risk tone, while the enhanced-liquidity auction for 10yr, 20yr and 30yr JGBs failed to spur any meaningful demand with the b/c unchanged from the prior.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.9%) is negative with the index dragged lower by weakness across the large industries including financials, energy and resources, while Nikkei 225 (-2.2%) is the worst hit as Japanese exporters suffer the ill-effects of a firmer currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) conform to the downbeat tone as buying in the mainland eases following the prior day&rsquo;s more than 4% rally, but with downside somewhat contained after another respectable liquidity injection by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is unchanged and just about holds onto the 96.00 level following the recent safe-haven flows and further deterioration in its major counterparts with EUR/USD below 1.1500, while GBP/USD languishes near the prior day&rsquo;s lows at a sub-1.3000 handle amid the ongoing Brexit-related qualms. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were dragged by the safe-haven flows, while high-beta currencies are mixed with antipodeans subdued by the risk-averse environment and with CAD resilient ahead of a widely anticipated BoC rate hike this week which markets are pricing a 97% probability of occurring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are quiet as prices fail to take advantage of the downbeat risk tone, while participants also look ahead to the enhanced-liquidity auction for 10yr, 20yr and 30yr JGBs later.</p>\r\n",
