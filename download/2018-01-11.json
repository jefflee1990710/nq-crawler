As you would expect this put a bid into Treasuries during the overnight session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The space hovered around best levels heading in to the release of the latest ECB meeting minutes, which were deemed hawkish as a result of the following passage: &ldquo;Looking ahead, the view was widely shared among members that the Governing Council&rsquo;s communication would need to evolve gradually, without a change in sequencing, if the economy continued to expand and inflation converged further towards the Governing Council&rsquo;s aim.

Disc. +1.6%, Industrials +1.3%<br />Bottom sectors: Utilities -0.4%, Cons. Stap -0.1%, Telecoms +0.1%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major US bouerses printed fresh record highs on Thursday. Energy stocks were lifted by crude prices surging towards three-year highs, with Brent clearing $70, while WTI climbed to $64. Airlines were also stronger following decent earnings from Delta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were a few equity market jitters after a batch of poor PPI data out of the US, hinting at lower inflationary pressures in the pipeline. However, equities were quick to shrug off the weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financials were little changed on the day ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s earnings from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, BlackRock and PNC Financial Services. The Street looks for aggregated S&amp;P 500 earnings growth of 12%, on average, with energy companies likely to drive gains, according to Reuters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Note Futures settle +4 ticks higher at 123-04</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US paper moved lower on decent enough volume. The Asia session was dominated by China-related headlines, with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-bonds-china/china-fx-regulator-report-on-slowing-us-bond-buying-may-be-based-on-erroneous-information-idUKB9N1OT01O\" target=\"_blank\">SAFE playing down the Bloomberg sources piece that hit yesterday</a>, regarding China&rsquo;s purchases of US government debt. As you would expect this put a bid into Treasuries during the overnight session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The space hovered around best levels heading in to the release of the latest ECB meeting minutes, which were deemed hawkish as a result of the following passage: &ldquo;Looking ahead, the view was widely shared among members that the Governing Council&rsquo;s communication would need to evolve gradually, without a change in sequencing, if the economy continued to expand and inflation converged further towards the Governing Council&rsquo;s aim. The language pertaining to various dimensions of the monetary policy stance and forward guidance could be revisited early in the coming year.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This allowed some concession heading in to today&rsquo;s 30-year supply which stopped screens by 2.1bps, foreign buyers stepped in leaving the indirect takedown at the highest level on record, while the BTC was the highest since December 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY -0.4% heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FX space experienced another very whippy session, with the USD ultimately edging lower after the DXY traded above 92.50 in early European dealing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weaker than forecast US data undermined the greenback, after a relatively hawkish ECB meeting minutes release boosted the EUR, with the EURUSD cross settling around 1.2050 and EURGBP consolidating hovering around 0.8900</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY continued to grind higher, with USDJPY hitting fresh lows in lieu of the solid US 30-year auction. Oil selling-off towards settlement also put pressure on USDJPY, with 111.00 in sight as we head into APAC trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodity FX drifted upwards on the back of crude gains, however, NAFTA headline risk kept the CAD subdued; the Loonie has been content with sideways trade</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 23 cents higher at $63.80 per barrel; Brent futures settle 6 cents higher at $69.26 per barrel </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude continued to push higher, helped by higher bond yields, a rumour of an explosion at the Escravos-Lagos gas pipeline in Nigeria and the softer USD. Brent briefly printed above USD 70.00/bbl before pulling back. Crude did come under selling pressure heading into settlement, with profit-taking being cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural Gas futures broke above USD 3.00 in early US trade, pushing to fresh highs as the weekly EIA storage data revealed a record drawdown, exceeding the estimated drawdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Earnings season kicks off this week with some of the larger US financials reporting, including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. For Q4, the S&amp;P 500 is expected to see earnings grow by 11.8% Y/Y, a faster pace of growth than the last two quarters. The sectors leading the growth are expected to be Energy, Materials, Technology, and Financials, while the Telecoms sector is the only one forecast to provide negative earnings growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THINGS TO WATCH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As is always the case, the unofficial earnings season kick-off starts with the Financial sector which will be in focus after the recent Fed rate hikes and upcoming tax changes. A number of banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have already said the impending tax changes will cause a hit in the short term, although in the long-term lower corporation tax should be beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tax changes will make this reporting season &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; as companies are expected to report charges and other &ldquo;special items&rdquo; while also lifting expectations for 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Companies with excessive overseas cash piles, particularly tech names, are expected to take large one-off charges as they had previously been able to defer US tax on offshore cash but will now have to pay the tax, albeit over the next 8 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, those companies with deferred tax liabilities should book large one-off profits. The FT reports that AT&amp;T could report a one-off gain of approx. USD 25bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next question is what will happen to repatriated cash from offshore. Prudential Financial Chief Market Strategist said what they want to see and hear from companies is what they do with the cash, be that M&amp;A, increasing capex or share buybacks and dividends. JPMorgan say that increasing investment may be better for the economy but would ultimately disappoint investors.</p>\r\n",

Weaker than forecast US data (PPI and weekly jobless claims) undermined the Greenback independently, but the <strong>EUR</strong> was boosted by hawkish ECB minutes prior to that, with Eur/Usd up more than a full point from 1.1930 lows and then nudging further ahead to reach 1.2050+. Eur/Gbp back on the 0.8900 handle as <strong>Sterling</strong> lagged, albeit Cable reclaiming 1.3500+ status and almost 1.3550. The <strong>Kiwi</strong> and <strong>Aud </strong>extended recent gains vs their US peer with Nzd/Usd through 0.7230 and nearly testing psychological resistance at 0.7250 at the base of the next bullish upside chart area up to 0.7270. Aud/Usd revisited overnight peaks just below 0.7890, with stops just above the next big figure increasingly enticing. <strong>CAD</strong> not really bothered about a slightly sub-consensus Canadian new house price index and outperforming its US counterpart to trade at the bottom end of a 1.2590-25 range, with the Loonie underpinned by a sharp rally in oil prices and positive, albeit conditional comments from the Foreign Minister on NAFTA negotiations (prepared for any eventuality, but potential for talks to end well). <strong>JPY </strong>vs the Usd within a 111.90-30 range and ending close to the base where bids are seen ahead of 111.00. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>As a recap, last month saw the bank reiterate guidance that it expects rates to remain at current levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of net asset purchases. Furthermore, despite the Bank being relatively upbeat on the Eurozone&rsquo;s growth prospects (large upgrade to 2018 growth projections), Draghi quashed market expectations over the potential end-date for the ECB&rsquo;s QE programme by stating that the matter was not discussed at the meeting. However, this was then followed by ECB Sources suggesting that a minority of ECB Rate Setters wanted to signal guidance may change if inflation keeps accelerating, hawks were easily outnumbered and the debate was not heated. Therefore, any guidance on the scope of the discussions and the split of views will be of interest to the market going forward, particularly in the context of recent comments from Mersch who warned against too slow an exit from monetary policy and Coeure who sees &ldquo;a reasonable chance&rdquo; the ECB&#39;s PSPP will not be extended again when it expires in September. HSBC are also looking out for details on any debate surrounding the split between public and corporate bond purchases from January 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

However, the former might be preferred if the BoJ eventually aims to converge YCC toward more conventional monetary policy focused on short-term policy rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normalizing monetary policy through a revision to YCC when realized CPI inflation is undershooting targeted inflation at around 1% even in H2 18 might be justified by the following: 1) a stepwise adjustment in interest rates based on a Taylor rule-type policy reaction function for managing YCC; 2) a tilting of the trade-off between the benefits of prolonged monetary easing (eg, higher inflation expectations, accommodative financial conditions) and the side-effects (eg, decline in fiscal discipline, deterioration in earnings of financial institutions) toward the latter, as evident from the extensive discussion on the reversal rate since last year; and 3) tailwinds to normalization from the external environment, eg, the government&rsquo;s anticipated declaration of an end to deflation around mid2018, the prospect of sustained rate hiking by the Fed. At the same time, we expect the BoJ to retain its negative interest rate policy through 2018, unwinding NIRP (restoring the zero interest rate policy, ZIRP) in Q1 19 rather than in Q4 18, as we previously forecast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of quantitative easing (QE) &ndash; the other major component of the current monetary policy program &ndash; we expect the BoJ to retain its current guideline for the supply of base money through JGB purchases (JPY80trn/year), while continuing to allow actual buying to decrease (stealth tapering) in accordance with JGB supply and demand. Even under our new forecasts, we continue to expect the focus of monetary policy to shift from &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; to &ldquo;rates&rdquo; and from the long-term to the short-term sector under YCC.</p>\r\n",

As noted, the Aud and Nzd are bucking the weaker vs Greenback trend, with Aud/Usd through 0.7860-65 stops and 0.7870 macro offers on the way to a 0.7885 overnigh high in wake of much stronger than expected Aussie retail sales data. 0.7900+ stops lie ahead, as the Aud/Nzd cross reclaims 1.0900 and the Kiwi stalls just above 0.7200 vs the Usd.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fixed Income</strong><br />Core debt extending to the upside after a brief period of consolidation and pull-back, with trading volumes picking up, albeit nowhere near as heavy as they were on the sell-side when China&rsquo;s false US Treasury claims sparked a near rout. Nevertheless, decent clips&nbsp; have been bought in 10 year US T-note futures in a relatively short space of time, while Bunds and Gilts climbed to fresh Eurex and Liffe session highs at 161.54 and 124.50 (+47 and +38 ticks), the former achieving a 50% retrace of this week&rsquo;s move, at 161.48, and stopping just short of the 161.56-60 zone that could trip stops before 161.76. For the 10 year UK benchmark, 124.56, 124.73 and 124.95 form the next upside tech objectives, but as noted looming supply may deter bulls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Commodities</strong><br />Price action in WTI and Brent crude had been somewhat uneventful overnight, however prices have recently broken out of its tight range, to trade at intra-day highs, with the latter breaking yesterday&rsquo;s high of USD 69.37/bbl.</p>\r\n",

Usd/Chf is back up near 0.9800 vs yesterday&rsquo;s lows below 0.9750, and Usd/Jpy over 111.50 and through the 200 DMA at 111.72 and 111.85 supply to a high just shy of 111.90 at one stage, eyeing 112.00 offers/psychological resistance, before a 112.08 Fib and the 112.26 100 DMA. 111.40-35 provides support on the downside.

        "content": "<p>The 10 year German benchmark gapped up &frac14; point-plus off the open and is looking to build on healthy recovery gains as China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry follows SAFE with a firm denial of Wednesday&rsquo;s reports suggesting foreign bond portfolio diversification away from US Treasuries. Core debt also encouraged by a stellar 10 year auction as yields approaching 2.6% drew strong demand, and perhaps poignantly from indirect bidders that incorporate overseas buyers. The Eurex high so far is 161.44 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 161.07 close and the 161.91 intraday low, with the yield backing off from the 0.5% area (on the 2027 maturity) vs 0.54% for the new 2028 maturity when issued. Tech-wise, 161.56-60 represents the next upside chart resistance area, but Bunds may be reluctant to extend that far ahead of ECB minutes, which could highlight more hawkish views about setting an end date for QE (as per the tone of recent commentary from several Board members). Indeed, initial/early momentum is already stalling amidst a pull-back to 161.31, and on the downside 161.20 is nearest support.</p>\r\n",

Longer dated paper has sold off more aggressively amid a bear steepening. Good concession for BTPs against Bonos.. Concession for longer dated BTPs also in against core markets and swaps, however a good concession was no help for weak 2/28 Bund auction yesterday. Competing supply an issue, but big redemptions coming to provide support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical Data</p>\r\n\r\n<p>0.2% Oct&rsquo;2020 Prev. b/c 1.794 and average yield -0.02%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.45% Nov&rsquo;2024 Prev. b/c 1.438 and average yield 1.21%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bids are submitted by 1000GMT and results are published shortly after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: UK GBP 2.25bln 1.75% 2037 Gilt Auction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>History indicates that results have always been a little on the soft side for the line. Looking at the curve, the line has lost around 13bp since the last tap, so there is little in the way of any natural concession in place. 10s/20s also offers little incentive with the curve around 6bp flatter than the October tap at 52.5bp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As ever though with relatively new Gilts, the issue sits at an inherently cheap kink on the curve, trading around 6bp cheap on the mismatched fly between the 4Q36s and the 4T38s, which should also help the cause. So all in all, considering that longer dated sales historically attract institutional demand, little drama is in prospect although risks must be skewed towards softer results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical Data</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.75% Sep&rsquo;2037 Prev. b/c 1.85, average yield 1.941% and a tail of 0.4bps</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bids are submitted by 1030GMT and results are published shortly after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: US Treasury will sell USD 12bln of 30-year bonds</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US Treasury will auction USD 12bln of 30-year bonds on 11 January at 1800 GMT/1300 ET</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THIS WEEK&rsquo;S TREASURY SUPPLY:&nbsp;</strong>Excluding bills, the US will this week sell a total of USD 56bln in 3s, 10s and 30s this week (USD 24bln of 3s on Tuesday, USD 20bln in a 10s reopening on Wednesday, USD 12bln in a 30s reopening on Thursday). The sales will raise a net USD 15.5bln in new cash, given the USD 40.5bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, according to TD Securities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> Ahead The Treasury complex is being driven by news that Chinese officials have recommended a slowing or complete halt of its US Treasury purchases, saying that the attractiveness of US Treasuries are diminishing relative to other assets. The news has helped push long-end yields up by over 10bps in the week thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Auction in the 30-year sector have improved, as of late. All of the previous three have stopped-through the 1pm WI yield, and over the last six, the average tail as been 0bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Final demand has increased somewhat,&rdquo; Barclays writes. &ldquo;On a three-month moving average basis, foreign demand has increased 5ppts, which has only been partially offset by slightly lower demand from investment funds.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest positioning data indicates that Primary Dealers have trimmed their long positions in the 11-years+ since the last auction cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing before news from china, analysts at Societe Generale hold a small positive bias going into the auction on the back of continuing demand for the long-end of the curve. &ldquo;From an RV perspective, the current 30y is cheap on asset swap versus the old 30s compared with the previous two auctions, whereas the 5s30s curve has flattened by around 8bp since the last auction.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank did believe that concession would be required, given that the sector appeared rich given that the 5s30s curve continues to flatten towards the lowest levels since 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>30-YEAR PREVIOUS AUCTION HISTORY:</strong><br /><strong><strong>- High-yield:</strong></strong> 2.804% (vs six auction average of 2.837%)<br /><strong>- Tail:</strong> -0.3bps (stops-through) (vs six auction average of 0.0bps)<br /><strong>- Bid-to-cover:</strong> 2.48x (vs six auction average of 2.35x)<br /><strong>- Dealers:</strong> 29.1% (vs six auction average of 30.3%)<br /><strong>- Directs: 9.0% </strong>(vs six auction average of 7.4%)<br /><strong>- Indirects:</strong> 61.9% (vs six auction average of62.3%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mostly lower amid a dampened global risk tone, which was triggered by China concerns after officials were said to see US Treasuries as less attractive and recommended either cutting back or halting purchases altogether. This was viewed by some as an implicit threat by the world&rsquo;s largest foreign holder of USTs against trade measures by the US, although China&rsquo;s SAFE later suggested that the report may have cited a wrong source or could be fake news. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) were both subdued with broad-based weakness across nearly all sectors in Australia, while Japanese stocks remained at the whim of the recent JPY strength. Chinese markets also conformed to the sombre picture with both Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (Unch.) cautious as the PBoC&rsquo;s liquidity efforts continued to be on the light-side. Finally, 10yr JGBs found some reprieve from this week&rsquo;s selling o mild short-covering and after the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement in which purchases in 1yr-10yr maturities were maintained at a respectable amount of nearly JPY 1tln.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly lower amid a dampened global risk tone, which was triggered by China concerns after officials were said to see US Treasuries as less attractive and recommended either cutting back or halting purchases altogether. This was viewed by some as an implicit threat by the world&rsquo;s largest foreign holder of USTs against trade measures by the US, which spooked the greenback, bond market and resulted to a negative close across all major US indices. ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) are both subdued with broad-based weakness across nearly all sectors in Australia, while Japanese stocks remain at the whim of the recent JPY strength. Chinese markets also conform to the sombre picture with both Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) and Hang Seng (-0.2%) cautious as the PBoC&rsquo;s liquidity efforts continue to be on the light-side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, AUD outperforms its major peers after better than expected Retail Sales data which pushed AUD/NZD back above the 1.0900 handle, while EUR/AUD briefly slipped below 1.5200. Elsewhere, USD/JPY attempts to nurse recent weakness, but with the recovery only marginal after this week&rsquo;s flows into JPY and China&rsquo;s US Treasury sabre-rattling. NAFTA-related currencies weakened with CAD initially pressured on reports that Canada feared the US would pull out of NAFTA which the White House later denied, while MXN was also offered in sympathy and amid reports Mexico will leave NAFTA negotiations if President Trump triggers a 6-month process to withdraw from the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs found some reprieve from this week&rsquo;s selling on some mild short-covering and after the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement in which purchases in 1yr-10yr maturities were maintained at a respectable amount of nearly JPY 1tln.</p>\r\n",
