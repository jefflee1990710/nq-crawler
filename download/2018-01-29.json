Energy losses were inspired by weaker crude prices; tech was hit after reports that Apple will slash iPhoneX production in half. Telecoms stocks were also in focus; US officials denied anything had been finalised to nationalise 5G networks on national security fears. In M&amp;A, Keurig Green Mountain said it will but Dr Pepper in a $21bln deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earnings slate has some huge hitters this week: On Tuesday, McDonald&rsquo;s and Pfizer are the highlights; on Wednesday, Eli Lilly, Lockheed Martin and Anthem stand-out; on Thursday, Apple, Amazon, DowDuPont, Time Warner are on the slate; and on Friday, Exxon, Chevron and Merck are the standouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREASURIES: US 10-Year T-Note futures settle 8 ticks lower at 121-26<br /><br />Bear-steepening was the theme for the US Treasury curve on Monday, with yields on 10s rising above 2.72% to the highest levels since 2014. Technical analysts were pointing out that 10-year yields had broken key technical trendlines dating back to the 1980s. Major curve spreads were also wider at settlement (2s5s +c.2bps, 2s10s +c.3bps, 2s30s +c3bps). Traders are expecting the US Treasury&rsquo;s quarterly funding announcement on Wednesday to see UST issuance raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, some are also expecting the FOMC to hawkishly tweak its language at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday, to prepare markets for a rate hike. CME Fedwatch indicates there is only a 4.1% probability of a hike at this week&rsquo;s meeting, and a 60% chance of three hikes in 2018 (as the Fed has forecast).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAFTA: After the sixth round of NAFTA negotiations, US says progress being made to warrant moving forward with a fresh round of talks, but pace needs to pick up. Meanwhile Canada has welcomed a 5-ear NAFTA review, but noted that there is a significant gap with the US&rsquo; position. Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo says we are at a better moment in this NAFTA negotiation process, says there has been flexibility from the three nations which is leading to constructive proposals, adding negotiations can conclude between February and July, and says we could reach an agreement within this time frame, and said that Mexico does not have the luxury of suspending this NAFTA negotiation process due to elections in Mexico and US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU offered to allow the UK to keep membership benefits for 21 months post-Brexit, but the UK would also not be able to block new EU laws during the transition period. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MPs could lose seats in new sexual harassment sanctions, say sources. MPs could lose their seats if found to have engaged in sexual harassment or bullying under proposed new guidelines, the Guardian understands. The proposed sanctions, put together by a cross-party working group set up to formulate a new process for sexual harassment complaints, include the parliamentary commissioner for standards being granted powers to suspend MPs, which could lead to recall &ndash; a process whereby MPs can lose their seat. Sources close to the working group said the recommendations would be &ldquo;serious and heavyweight&rdquo;. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY up 0.3% heading into APAC trade</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD was supported by a steepening US yield curve, driven by expectations that the Federal Reserve may hawkishly tweak its post-meeting statement at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday to prepare markets for an upcoming hike. There is also an eye on employment data at the end of the week, which is expected to show 180k nonfarm payrolls were added to the US economy in January, and AHE Y/Y is seen ticking up to 2.6%. The USD also gained vs the EUR on portfolio rebalancing on month-end, following another rise in spec longs to fresh all time highs for the single currency. The buck was little changed following the mixed PCE data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR continues to linger just beneath the 1.24 handle against the buck, having fallen to as low as 1.2340 in European trade as the dollar advanced. However, some traders find EUR weakness an opportunity to buy given the narrative of a recovering Eurozone economy, inflation expectations rising (the 5y5y inflation swap forward hit 1.80% last week), as well as a tilt towards righter policy among some ECB policymakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP was hit by USD strength, but managed to defend the 1.40 level successfully. There was little positive reaction from news that the EU has agreed its position on its Brexit stance, and that stance is aligned with the UK&rsquo;s own position, though there remains a gap between the EU and the UK on a number of issues regarding the eventual transitional deal. EURGBP advanced to the 0.88 figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Havens were lower on USD strength, with gold slopping to the $1340 mark, while the yen is flirting with 109, though USDCHF couldn&rsquo;t get its head back above 0.94.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD was mostly drifted sideways, seemingly caught between positive comments after the conclusion of the sixth round of NAFTA talks, though crude prices slipping kept the Loonie negative against the Buck. EM&rsquo;s were generally on the back foot in the face of Greenback strength, and the MXN was no different, losing out by 0.66%.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk504673747\">COMMODITIES</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI futures settle 58 cents lower at $65.56 per barrel; Brent futures settle $1.06 lower at $69.46 per barrel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With little fundamental newsflow, the dollar strength was being attributed to commodity weakness on Monday, though crude is still likely to put in the best January showing in five years. The Street looks for a small build in crude stocks this week, the first build in 11 weeks; headline crude stocks are seen rising by 100k barrels, distillates are expected to drawdown by 1.5mln barrels, gasoline is seen building by 1.4mln barrels. Genscape was said to have forecast Cushing stocks will draw by 2.6mln barrels in the latest week.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: Quiet before the storm; USD flexes its muscles ahead of SOTU, FOMC, NFP",
        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX -19 points at 2853, DJI -181 points at 26436, NDX -35 points at 6988&nbsp;</strong><br />Top sectors: Healthcare +0.02%, Consumer Cyclicals&nbsp;-0.07%, Consumer Non-Cyclicals -0.08%<br />Bottom sectors: Energy -1.01%, Utilities -0.83%, Materials -0.71%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stocks retreated from record highs in Monday trade, with losses broad-based across sectors. Energy losses were inspired by weaker crude prices; tech was hit after reports that Apple will slash iPhoneX production in half. Telecoms stocks were also in focus; US officials denied anything had been finalised to nationalise 5G networks on national security fears. In M&amp;A, Keurig Green Mountain said it will but Dr Pepper in a $21bln deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earnings slate has some huge hitters this week: On Tuesday, McDonald&rsquo;s and Pfizer are the highlights; on Wednesday, Eli Lilly, Lockheed Martin and Anthem stand-out; on Thursday, Apple, Amazon, DowDuPont, Time Warner are on the slate; and on Friday, Exxon, Chevron and Merck are the standouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US 10-Year T-Note futures settle 8 ticks lower at 121-26</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bear-steepening was the theme for the US Treasury curve on Monday, with yields on 10s rising above 2.72% to the highest levels since 2014. Technical analysts were pointing out that 10-year yields had broken key technical trendlines dating back to the 1980s. Major curve spreads were also wider at settlement (2s5s +c.2bps, 2s10s +c.3bps, 2s30s +c3bps). Traders are expecting the US Treasury&rsquo;s quarterly funding announcement on Wednesday to see UST issuance raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, some are also expecting the FOMC to hawkishly tweak its language at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday, to prepare markets for a rate hike. CME Fedwatch indicates there is only a 4.1% probability of a hike at this week&rsquo;s meeting, and a 60% chance of three hikes in 2018 (as the Fed has forecast).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY up 0.3% heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD was supported by a steepening US yield curve, driven by expectations that the Federal Reserve may hawkishly tweak its post-meeting statement at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday to prepare markets for an upcoming hike. There is also an eye on employment data at the end of the week, which is expected to show 180k nonfarm payrolls were added to the US economy in January, and AHE Y/Y is seen ticking up to 2.6%. The USD also gained vs the EUR on portfolio rebalancing on month-end, following another rise in spec longs to fresh all time highs for the single currency. The buck was little changed following the mixed PCE data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR continues to linger just beneath the 1.24 handle against the buck, having fallen to as low as 1.2340 in European trade as the dollar advanced. However, some traders find EUR weakness an opportunity to buy given the narrative of a recovering Eurozone economy, inflation expectations rising (the 5y5y inflation swap forward hit 1.80% last week), as well as a tilt towards righter policy among some ECB policymakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP was hit by USD strength, but managed to defend the 1.40 level successfully. There was little positive reaction from news that the EU has agreed its position on its Brexit stance, and that stance is aligned with the UK&rsquo;s own position, though there remains a gap between the EU and the UK on a number of issues regarding the eventual transitional deal. EURGBP advanced to the 0.88 figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Havens were lower on USD strength, with gold slipping to the $1340 mark, while the yen is flirting with 109, though USDCHF couldn&rsquo;t get its head back above 0.94.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD mostly drifted sideways, seemingly caught between positive comments after the conclusion of the sixth round of NAFTA talks, though crude prices slipping kept the Loonie negative against the Buck; but essentially trade was uneventful and horizontal. EM&rsquo;s were generally on the back foot in the face of Greenback strength, and the MXN was no different, losing out by 0.66%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 58 cents lower at $65.56 per barrel; Brent futures settle $1.06 lower at $69.46 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With little fundamental newsflow, the dollar strength was being attributed to commodity weakness on Monday, though crude is still likely to put in the best January showing in five years. The Street looks for a small build in crude stocks this week, the first build in 11 weeks; headline crude stocks are seen rising by 100k barrels, distillates are expected to drawdown by 1.5mln barrels, gasoline is seen building by 1.4mln barrels. Genscape was said to have forecast Cushing stocks will draw by 2.6mln barrels in the latest week.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The Eur and Gbp both lost more ground vs the Greenback, the former breaching trend-line support around 1.2378 and filling bids in the 1.2380-70 area on the way down to sub-1.2350 levels and almost testing a key Fib level at 1.2344. Cable also retreated further from 2018 highs and best levels since the Brexit vote to trade just under 1.4060, but marginally outperformed the single currency as the EU adopted the UK&rsquo;s Brexit transition stance, and despite a healthy German Government 2018 GDP forecast upgrade - Eur/Gbp slipped below 0.8800 towards 0.8875. It seems that the Eur suffered more from positioning and rebalancing after another rise in spec longs to a new all time high amidst month end portfolios indicating Dollar buying for neutrality. The DXY marginally extended recovery gains towards 89.500, but was hampered by a more resilient Jpy, Chf, Cad and Aud. Usd/Jpy remained capped by 109.00 offers, Usd/Chf pivoted 0.9350, Usd/Cad circa 1.2330 amidst prospects of prolonged NAFTA talks and Aud/Usd close to 0.8100. The Kiwi continued to ease back from 0.7400-plus highs towards the 0.7300 handle in wake of last week&rsquo;s sub-forecast NZ inflation data and with trade next up.</p>\r\n",

Both the <strong>Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%)</strong> initially conformed to the gains in which the former continued to post fresh record levels, although the tone later deteriorated amid increases in money market rates after the PBoC skipped open market operations, coupled with underperformance in Shenzhen where Leshi fell limit down for a 4th consecutive day. In addition, Wynn Macau was a notable underperformer in Hong Kong and slumped around 5% due to allegations of sexual misconduct by Wynn Resorts Chairman, CEO and founder Steve Wynn. Finally, 10yr JGBs are mildly lower as prices fell amid an initial positive risk tone in the region and alongside spill-over selling from their US counterparts, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban operation was relatively light with the central bank in the market for only JPY 435bln of JGBs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 140bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3267 (Prev. 6.3436).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Knot stated that the ECB should make it clear how it will end its asset purchases after September when its current purchase program finishes and that there isn&rsquo;t any reason to continue with bond purchases. Knot also stated that the current program should end ASAP, but noted it was better to continue the program until September for credibility. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he has a lot of problems with EU from a trade standpoint and that the US response would be very much to their detriment.

In terms of sector specifics, material names outperform following price action in the metals complex with Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Glencore, Antofagasta and BHP all near the top of the FSTE 100. Elsewhere, focus has also been on the IT sector with AMS (+20%) and Wirecard (+1.7%) soaring in the wake of earnings. Other notable equity specific newsflow includes Sanofi acquiring Ablynx (+3.5%) for EUR 3.9bln and a double upgrade at BAML for Volkswagen (+1.5%) with BAML commenting on whether the Co. could be a potential break-up candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback is a broad winner (for once), as high/rising US Treasury yields are finally offering the <strong>USD</strong> some support, while month end rebalancing could also prompt short covering given buy signals and latest weekly CTFC spec positioning showing another increase in shorts. The <strong>DXY</strong> looks firmer above the 89.000 level, but really needs to extend recovery gains beyond 89.500 for a more sustained retracement and to prevent bears from further attacks on key supports below 88.500. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> has bounced off 108.50 again, but remains top heavy around 109.00 amidst offers at the big figure and a fib just above (109.07). <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> is straddling 1.2400, but firmly supported above a 1.2344 Fib and via hawkish comments from ECB&rsquo;s Knot, while Cable has retreated sharply from post-Brexit vote highs (1.4345) to 1.4100 or a few pips under amidst more UK political and EU divorce agreement uncertainty. USD/CAD is back up near 1.2350 after mixed NAFTA noises as some reports suggest progress and others big sticking points. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>CHF</strong> around the middle of a 0.9335-0.9385 range with the SNB declining comment on any intervention, while <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> have both backed off from recent 0.8100+ and 0.7400+ peaks on the back of softer metals/commodity prices and cross currency flows (clear rebound over 1.1000 in <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>NZD</strong>).

The earlier upside option flow only provided temporary support or incentive for dip buyers, and market participants are now suggesting that the 162.50 strike bought for 4 ticks in 4k lots (and subsequently for 4.5 ticks in the same size) was short covering rather than a fresh position. However, <strong>Gilts</strong> are holding the bulk of their recovery gains within a 122.28-122.56 range vs last Friday&rsquo;s 122.63 close amidst ongoing domestic and EU-related Brexit issues, and despite <strong>USTs</strong> remaining vulnerable towards the bottom of overnight trading parameters and the 10 year note future under 122-225 technical support/yield nudging further above 2.70%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI crude futures marginally extended above the USD 66.00/bbl level while Brent remains above USD 70bbl. Notable energy newsflow has included comments from the Iranian oil minister who stated that output declined in some oil fields due to lack of resources and added that Iran will seek lower production in coming years if it cannot be fixed. In metals markets, gold trades modestly lower as prices are hampered by the reprieve seen thus far for the USD.

The DXY looks firmer above the 89.000 level, but really needs to extend recovery gains beyond 89.500 for a more sustained retracement and to prevent bears from further attacks on key supports below 88.500. Usd/Jpy has bounced off 108.50 again, but remains top heavy around 109.00 amidst offers at the big figure and a fib just above (109.07). Eur/Usd is straddling 1.2400, but firmly supported above a 1.2344 Fib and via hawkish comments from ECB&rsquo;s Knot, while Cable has retreated sharply from post-Brexit vote highs (1.4345) to 1.4100 or a few pips under amidst more UK political and EU divorce agreement uncertainty. Usd/Cad is back up near 1.2350 after mixed NAFTA noises as some reports suggest progress and others big sticking points. Usd/Chf around the middle of a 0.9335-0.9385 range with the SNB declining comment on any intervention, while Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd have both backed off from recent 0.8100+ and 0.7400+ peaks on the back of softer metals/commodity prices and cross currency flows (clear rebound over 1.1000 in Aud/Nzd).

The longer end of the curve is also deriving a degree of relative support from the overall bear flattening, as Germany&rsquo;s 5 year yield trades at parity from negative, and perhaps some market participants take heed of hawkish QE comments from ECB&rsquo;s Knot. On that note, Lautenschlaeger could well echo similar sentiments, albeit balanced by the more neutral/dovish leanings of Praet and Coeure.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac bourses traded somewhat mixed, as the region failed to maintain the early broad momentum from last Friday&rsquo;s gains on Wall St. where sentiment was underpinned by earnings and in which all major indices closed at their all-time highs. ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) opened positive with Australia buoyed by M&amp;A activity including AWE shares which rose 16% on reports of a bid from Mitsui &amp; Co., while Japan stocks were less decisive with price action dictated by currency moves. Elsewhere, both Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) initially conformed to the gains in which the former continued to post fresh record levels, although the tone later deteriorated amid increases in money market rates after the PBoC skipped open market operations, coupled with underperformance in Shenzhen where Leshi fell limit down for a 4th consecutive day. In addition, Wynn Macau was a notable underperformer in Hong Kong and slumped around 5% due to allegations of sexual misconduct by Wynn Resorts Chairman, CEO and founder Steve Wynn. Finally, 10yr JGBs are mildly lower as prices fell amid an initial positive risk tone in the region and alongside spill-over selling from their US counterparts, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban operation was relatively light with the central bank in the market for only JPY 435bln of JGBs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD strengthened against its major counterparts in which EUR/USD briefly slipped below 1.2400 and AUD/USD gave up the 0.8100 handle. This was triggered by a rise in the US 10yr yield, which rose closer towards 2.690% as T-notes tripped through stops at prior support around 122.00, although the USD then gradually pared some of the gains which saw USD/JPY hit resistance at 109.00. Elsewhere, aside from the moves in the greenback, price action across FX markets was relatively uneventful amid a lack of data releases, quiet weekend newsflow and as participants looked ahead to this week&rsquo;s main events including President Trump&rsquo;s State of the Union Address, the FOMC policy meeting and the latest NFP jobs data.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac bourses begin the week with a positive tone, as the region takes impetus from last Friday&rsquo;s gains on Wall St. where sentiment was underpinned by earnings and in which all major indices closed at their all-time highs. ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) are positive with Australia buoyed by M&amp;A activity including AWE shares which rose over 16% on reports of a bid from Mitsui &amp; Co., while Japan stocks are supported amid a rebound in USD/JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) conform to the gains with the former continuing its record-setting performance, although all is not rosy with Shenzhen underperforming as Leshi falls limit down for a 4<sup>th</sup> consecutive day and with Wynn Macau slumping in Hong Kong due to allegations of sexual misconduct by its Chairman, CEO and founder Steve Wynn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD strengthened against its major counterparts in which EUR/USD gave up the 1.2400 handle and AUD/USD slipped back below 0.8100. This was triggered by a rise in the US 10yr yield, which rose closer towards 2.690% as T-notes tripped through stops at prior support around 122.00. Elsewhere, aside from the stronger greenback, price action across FX markets was relatively uneventful amid a lack of data releases, quiet weekend newsflow and as participants look ahead to this week&rsquo;s main events including President Trump&rsquo;s State of The Union, the FOMC policy meeting and latest NFP jobs data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are mildly lower amid a positive risk tone in the region and alongside spill-over selling from their US counterparts, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban operation was relatively light with the central bank in the market for only JPY 435bln of JGBs.</p>\r\n",
