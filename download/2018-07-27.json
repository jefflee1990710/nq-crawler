        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP – 27 July 2018: Stocks skid, weighed by tech",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities down, Treasuries flat, crude down, dollar down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: &nbsp;US Q2 GDP jumped to 4.1%; Oil drillers add rigs for the first week in three; Tech shares slammed.<br />* NEXT WEEK: FOMC, BoE and BoJ, Banxico, BCB; US Labour Market Report and PCE, ISM Manufacturing, EZ CPI, GDP; US to impose tariffs on another USD 16bln of Chinese goods; Earnings from AAPL, PFE, TSLA, BRKb, CAT.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US ADVANCED Q2 GDP </strong>posted at 4.1%, in line with expectations, a reading that appeared to disappoint traders after hints earlier in the week that the headline number could be closer to 5.0%. Gains were seen in consumer spending, investment and government expenditure. Consumer spending was supported by tax cuts and gains durables, non-durables and services, government spending contributed through gains in the state and local sector and finally business investment was supported by advances in structures, equipment and intellectual properties. However, some &ndash; like Pantheon Macroeconomics &ndash; noted that the stellar reading may be an aberration; Pantheon specifically noted that consumer spending cannot continue to rise at such a clip given that real wage growth is not seen sustainably supporting it. Other components, like soybean exports, are also likely to fall back after solid performances in Q2. Additionally, the business investment component was dominated by the mining sector, which is unlikely to repeat the performance in Q3. Nevertheless, after the data, US President Trump talked up the economy, pointing out the solid run of data, ahead of November&rsquo;s midterms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US Defence Secretary Mattis dismissed reports of possible US strikes on Iran, stating they are complete fiction. This followed REPORTS ON Thursday from Australian ABC, which stated the US could soon launch air strikes in Iran targeting nuclear capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Mexico Economy Minister Guajardo said working teams are ready to begin talks and landed some of the specifics of a new NAFTA agreement, adding that Mexico has agreed to begin less complex NAFTA talks and then move on to more complex issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.65% at 2819, NDX -1.40% at 7297, DJI -0.29% at 25452. </strong>SECTORS: Energy: -0.50%, Materials: -0.35%, Industrials: 0.0%, Cons Discretionary: -0.28%, Cons Staples: +0.16%, Health Care: -0.71%, Financials: +0.25%, Tech: -1.99%, Telecoms: +1.96%, Utilities: -0.40%</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>After the US cash equity open the ES -- which was going sideways overnight -- saw selling action. A combination of reasons was being thrown around: the FAANG weakness (add Twitter to that mix) this week was said to weigh on investor confidence, the VIX rose towards highs of the week, while haven currencies (JPY) were bid, while oil was sliding (Oil drillers add rigs for the first week in three, Baker Hughes said). Some also suggest that, ahead of next week&#39;s central bank activity (BOJ, FOMC, BOE), investors were taking chips off the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>LAM Research (LRCX) was among the leaders after beating on the top and bottom-lines, and with management declaring the September quarter as the bottom, which helped boost other tech stocks. Although Chevron (CVX) missed expectations, its chairman noted that earnings were up significantly on the year, benefiting from higher crude prices and higher production, as well as strong operations. Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) was higher, with numbers aided by knee and hip products. Expedia (EXPE) beat on EPS, in line on revenues. On the other side of the coin, Twitter (TWTR) user data disappointed, sending shares lower; Edwards Lifesciences reported lower than expected revenue, while Intel (INTC) beat on top and bottom-lines, boosted guidance, but said that new chips wouldn&#39;t be rolled out until next year, pressuring shares on concerns that the chipmaker would be vulnerable to rivals who are pushing in on its space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITY SPECIFICS: </strong>CBS (CBS) posted losses of 6% after CEO Moonves was said to be accused of sexual misconduct; Viacom (VIAB) gained and was up 4% on the back of the news. N.Y. state rescinded approval of the merger between Charter (CHTR) (Spectrum) and Time Warner Cable, citing repeated failure to meet agreed-to targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (U8) settles $0.92 lower at $68.69/bbl; Brent (U8) settles $0.25 lower at $74.29/bbl. </strong>Russian Energy Minister Novak said OPEC+ countries were not discussing options to boost production above 1mln BPD. Novak said Russia itself is targeting an output increase of between 200K-250K BPD versus the 2016 quota, and added that Russia does not use stockpiles to help boost oil output. The crude complex saw some downticks in US morning trade, after US Defence Secretary Mattis said that Thursday&#39;s reports (which stated that the US is prepared to bomb Iranian nuclear capabilities as soon as next month) were &#39;complete fiction&#39;. There was also some negative ticks in the afternoon after Mexican leader Lopez Obrador said his administration will boost crude production to 2.5mln BPD from the current 1.9mln BPD. This week, Baker Hughes reported oil drillers added rigs for the first week in three, taking the oil rig count to 861 (prev. 858), gas drillers cut 1 rig (to 186) taking the total rig count +2 to 1048.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 3 TICKS HIGHER AT 119-14</strong>. The complex was higher, with the curve garnering some support as the tech slide continued, though volume was thin, and yields only came in modestly; at one point, however, three-year yields found fresh highs not seen in over a decade. There was choppy trade around the GDP release (bias to the upside), but ultimately, there was not a lot to sing home about. Attention on next week&rsquo;s quarterly refunding and FOMC, and, given its impact on Treasuries recently, the BOJ meeting at the early part of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Contrasting fortunes and conflicting impulses for the index and Greenback overall, with a loss of momentum on Friday due to data in the form of advance Q2 US GDP that was hyped up to beat consensus by some distance (5% or even more), but &lsquo;only&rsquo; came in as expected. This prompted the proverbial sell fact reaction after the DXY nudged above 94.900 pre-release to sub-94.700, but the index and USD in general remain on course to end the week firmer on various other factors and largely due to declines in rival currencies. Looking ahead, the Fed and NFP dominate the agenda next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CNY, CNH: </strong>A combination of official PBoC action via higher mid-point fixings, spec positioning/bets and heightened US-China import tariff tensions sparked a marked depreciation in both on and off-shore Yuans to circa 6.8500 vs the USD, with only minor recoveries amidst reports of intervention and defensive measures in the spot and forward markets, on top of buy-side stock market activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Arguably the biggest G10/major loser on the week and largely due to clarification from ECB President Draghi that market pricing for rate hike in September/October next year is in line with GC guidance, adding that the only version that accurately conveys policy for the purposes of communication is the English translation. The single currency hit a 1.1750 high vs the USD just before this, as the post-meeting prepared text was broadly upbeat on growth and confident on inflation staying on a path towards target, but then reversed sharply through several technical support levels on the way to 1.1700 and below before finding a base around 1.1620, with EURGBP retreating under 0.8900 at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Conversely, &lsquo;hawkish&rsquo; BoJ speculation ahead of next Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting, centring on policy tweaks that allow more flexibility to exit from the ultra-easy stance when the time is deemed right, looks set to leave the JPY firmer than it was on Monday. Indeed, from around 111.50 at the start of the week the headline pair is back near the big figure and midway between 111.55-110.60 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*CAD: </strong>Another net winner vs USD, but more volatile than the Jpy amidst whippy oil prices, mixed data on either side of the NA divide and unfolding global trade developments. However, considerably more positive news on the NAFTA front ultimately boosted the Loonie to 1.3020 at best vs 1.3190 at the opposite extreme and 1.3135 at the beginning of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>Also relatively volatile and prone to swings in global trade sentiment, and Yuan moves, but the AUSD also undermined to a degree by softer than anticipated Q2 CPI. Nevertheless, AUDUSD is back on the 0.7400 handle from a circa 0.7355 low, while the Kiwi has rebounded towards 0.6800 from 0.6760 and back to the strike that saw mega expiry options run off on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, CHF: </strong>Both relatively side-lined this week, in terms of UK and Swiss specific drivers, but Cable has lost a big figure to 1.3100 from 1.3200 on more White Paper fall-out, and this time as EU chief Brexit negotiator Barnier rejected the Facilitated Customs proposal. However, a widely expected BoE hike next week could revive Sterling&rsquo;s fortunes, for a while at least. Back to the Franc, it&rsquo;s been a churn for the most part in a 0.9980-00 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Ups and downs all week for EM currencies, but the Lira was dealt a major blow as the CBRT confounded expectations for a 100-125 bp hike by standing pat, and USDTRY swiftly spiked back above 4.8000 in response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Monday: Swedish GDP, German CPI (Prelim), US Pending Home Sales. Tuesday: Japan Labour Market, China PMI, BoJ Decision, German Labour Market, EZ CPI, EZ GDP, US PCE, Canadian GDP, US SOMA Redemptions, Apple Earnings. Wednesday: NZ Labour Market, EZ Manufacturing PMI, UK Manufacturing PMI, US ADP Employment Change, US Quarterly Refunding Announcement, US ISM Manufacturing, FOMC Decision, Brazil Rate Decision. Thursday: Australian Trade Balance, UK Construction PMI, BoE Decision &amp; QIR, Banxico Rate Decision. Friday: Australian Retail Sales, China Caixin Services PMI, EZ Services PMI, Norwegian Labour Market, UK Services PMI, EZ Retail Sales, US Labour Market Report, US ISM Non-Manufacturing.

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: ‘disappointing’ US GDP, ‘dovish’ ECB, ‘devalued’ Yuan and more…..",
        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes and conflicting impulses for the index and Greenback overall, with a loss of momentum on Friday due to data in the form of advance Q2 US GDP that was hyped up to beat consensus by some distance (5% or even more), but &lsquo;only&rsquo; came in as expected. This prompted the proverbial sell fact reaction after the DXY nudged above 94.900 pre-release to sub-94.700, but the index and Usd in general remain on course to end the week firmer on various other factors and largely due to declines in rival currencies. Looking ahead, the Fed and NFP dominate the agenda next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNY/CNH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A combination of official PBoC action via higher mid-point fixings, spec positioning/bets and heightened US-China import tariff tensions sparked a marked depreciation in both on and off-shore Yuans to circa 6.8500 vs the Usd, with only minor recoveries amidst reports of intervention and defensive measures in the spot and forward markets, on top of buy-side stock market activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguably the biggest G10/major loser on the week and largely due to clarification from ECB President Draghi that market pricing for rate hike in September/October next year is in line with GC guidance, adding that the only version that accurately conveys policy for the purposes of communication is the English translation. The single currency hit a 1.1750 high vs the Usd just before this, as the post-meeting prepared text was broadly upbeat on growth and confident on inflation staying on a path towards target, but then reversed sharply through several technical support levels on the way to 1.1700 and below before finding a base around 1.1620, with Eur/Gbp retreating under 0.8900 at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, &lsquo;hawkish&rsquo; BoJ speculation ahead of next Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting, centring on policy tweaks that allow more flexibility to exit from the ultra-easy stance when the time is deemed right, looks set to leave the Jpy firmer than it was on Monday. Indeed, from around 111.50 at the start of the week the headline pair is back near the big figure and midway between 111.55-110.60 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another net winner vs Usd, but more volatile than the Jpy amidst whippy oil prices, mixed data on either side of the NA divide and unfolding global trade developments. However, considerably more positive news on the NAFTA front ultimately boosted the Loonie to 1.3020 at best vs 1.3190 at the opposite extreme and 1.3135 at the beginning of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also relatively volatile and prone to swings in global trade sentiment, and Yuan moves, but the Aud also undermined to a degree by softer than anticipated Q2 CPI. Nevertheless, Aud/Usd is back on the 0.7400 handle from a circa 0.7355 low, while the Kiwi has rebounded towards 0.6800 from 0.6760 and back to the strike that saw mega expiry options run off on Thursday,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both relatively side-lined this week, in terms of UK and Swiss specific drivers, but Cable has lost a big figure to 1.3100 from 1.3200 on more White Paper fall-out, and this time as EU chief Brexit negotiator Barnier rejected the Facilitated Customs proposal. However, a widely expected BoE hike next week could revive Sterling&rsquo;s fortunes, for a while at least. Back to the Franc, it&rsquo;s been a churn for the most part in a 0.9980-00 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ups and downs all week for EM currencies, but the Lira was dealt a major blow as the CBRT confounded expectations for a 100-125 bp hike by standing pat, and Usd/Try swiftly spiked back above 4.8000 in response.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were both higher with the Australian benchmark the outperformer as it attempted to reclaim the 6300 level and approached to within a whisker of its highest in over a decade. BHP was among the biggest gainers after it announced the sale of its US onshore assets to BP for USD 10.8bln and return the net proceeds to shareholders, while Japanese stocks also gained and were driven by earnings although a firmer JPY capped upside. Conversely, China lagged its regional peers with both Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) were subdued after the PBoC skipped open market operations all week which resulted to a net weekly drain of CNY 370bln, while China also signalled defiance on trade and were said to plan retaliating regardless of the amount of US tariffs. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as the 10yr yield rose to above 0.1% for a 2nd consecutive day amid firmer than expected Tokyo CPI data coupled with speculation of a BoJ policy adjustment next week. Pressure in JGBs was also exacerbated after the Rinban announcement in which the BoJ disappointed some calls for a special fixed-rate operation and instead stuck to its regular operation for 1yr-10yr JGBs. However, losses were pared heading into the EU open after the BoJ eventually announced an offer to buy unlimited amount of 5yr-10yr JGBs in fixed rate operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 370bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 540bln net injection. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7942 (Prev. 6.7662)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Industrial Profits (Jun) Y/Y 20.0% (Prev. 21.1%).

(Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Trump lawyer Cohen reportedly prepared to say that President Trump was aware of the meeting with Russians that were expected to offer dirt on Hillary Clinton.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are mostly higher (Eurostoxx 50 +0.4%) amid a slew of pre-market earnings. France&rsquo;s CAC 40 underperforms on the back of Kering and L&rsquo;Oreal (3rd and 4th largest index constituent, currently -7.2% and -3.6% respectively) weighing on the index post-earnings. Telecom names are the clear outperformers after BT&rsquo;s (+3.8%) earnings boosted the sector, dragging up Italy&rsquo;s Telecom Italia (+4.8%) and Germany&rsquo;s Deutsche Telekom (also influenced by a broker move, +2.7%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable movers post-earnings: Carrefour (+11.5%), SES (+8.0%), Reckitt Benckiser (+7.8%), Capgemini (-2.8%) and Banco de Sabadell (-2.6%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stateside, Amazon shares currently trade higher by 4.1% pre-market after posting a record USD 2.5bln profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from, or as well as bullish US GDP aspirations, other macro/fundamental impulses and cross-asset flows, technicals appear to be impacting trade to a degree in the run up to Friday&rsquo;s &lsquo;big&rsquo; and headline data event. In fact, Bunds are adhering very closely to the script having topped out at 162.18, as a market contact flags this level as near term resistance that would prompt offers if not breached, targeting 161.99 support vs the 161.97 new intraday Eurex low. Meanwhile, Gilts faded at 123.21 and have subsequently retreated to 123.05 for a 12 tick loss on the day and US Treasuries are essentially flat awaiting the advance look at Q2 growth before the final read of July&rsquo;s Michigan survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index is trying to build on recovery gains back above the 94.500 level and inch towards 94.900 amidst broad-based Dollar gains and lofty expectations for strong US growth in Q2 as forecasts range from 4 to 5% for the headline y/y annualised rate. However, an in line print could be deemed somewhat disappointing and risk a buy rumour/sell fact reaction, especially with at least one bank model flagging a &lsquo;strong&rsquo; Usd sell signal for month end portfolio rebalancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/NZD - The main victims of renewed Greenback buying even though weakness in other G10 currencies are indirectly responsible, and for specific reasons, with the Franc slipping a bit further from recent lows and now in a 0.9965-30 range and the Kiwi losing grip of 0.6800 after yesterday&rsquo;s mega option expiry at the strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - The single currency has retreated further from pre-ECB highs above 1.1700 vs the Usd and almost 1.1750 at one stage as dovish rate guidance continues undermine sentiment and highlight policy divergence vs the Fed. The headline pair failed to hold above a Fib around 1.1642 and is now testing key technical support at 1.1626, with a breach exposing 1.1600 ahead of another Fib down at 1.1575. The Pound, meanwhile, has been hit by negative Brexit news as EU chief negotiator Barnier dismissed the Chequers White Paper customs plan, and Cable is back below 1.3100 as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD/AUD - Relative outperformers, or at least holding their own against the Usd, with the Jpy containing losses beyond the 111.00 mark ahead of next Tuesday&rsquo;s BoJ meeting and a decent (near 1 bn) option expiry at 111.50 , the Loonie still bolstered by improved NAFTA deal prospects within 1.3050-80 parameters and the Aud resilient between 0.7370-95 even though the CNY and CNH are both on the ropes again (6.8000+) after a rebound in the PBoC&rsquo;s mid-point fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - Significantly weaker than forecast Swedish retail sales rattling the Krona, with Eur/Sek rallying towards 10.3000 vs Eur/NOK steady and sub-9.5500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - More pain for the Lira following Thursday&rsquo;s threat of additional sanctions by the US, as Usd/Try trades above 4.8500, but the Rouble and Rand are both keeping their heads above water, with Usd/Rub around 62.9800 and Usd/Zar just below 13.2500 ahead of the CBR rate decision (unchanged consensus) and after the SARB repeated a willingness to act if inflation exceeds target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.3%) and Brent (-0.2%) trades lower on the day with both benchmarks just under USD 69.50/bbl and USD 74.50/bbl respectively. The Russian Energy Minister Novak emerged this morning to point out OPEC+ countries are not discussing options to boost production above 1mln BPD, adding Russia targets a 200K-250K BPD output hike from the 2016 quota. Traders will be eyeing any development in the Red Sea shipping lane (after reports yesterday that Saudi halted shipments amid rebel attacks) while the weekly Baker Hughes rig count is released later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spot gold (-0.2%) continues to be pressured by a firmer dollar. Meanwhile, global steel output (a gauge of economic health) jumped in the first half of the year after major producing countries ramped up production due to strong margins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Telecom names are the clear outperformers after BT&rsquo;s (+3.8%) earnings boosted the sector, dragging up Italy&rsquo;s Telecom Italia (+4.4%) and Germany&rsquo;s Deutsche Telekom (also influenced by a broker move, +2.7%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable movers post-earnings: Carrefour (+11.5%), SES (+8.0%), Reckitt Benckiser (+7.3%), Capgemini (-2.8%)and Banco de Sabadell (-2.6%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index is trying to build on recovery gains back above the 94.500 level and inch towards 94.900 amidst broad-based Dollar gains and lofty expectations for strong US growth in Q2 as forecasts range from 4 to 5% for the headline y/y annualised rate. However, an in line print could be deemed somewhat disappointing and risk a buy rumour/sell fact reaction, especially with at least one bank model flagging a &lsquo;strong&rsquo; Usd sell signal for month end portfolio rebalancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/NZD - The main victims of renewed Greenback buying even though weakness in other G10 currencies are indirectly responsible, and for specific reasons, with the Franc slipping a bit further from recent lows and now in a 0.9965-30 range and the Kiwi losing grip of 0.6800 after yesterday&rsquo;s mega option expiry at the strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - The single currency has retreated further from pre-ECB highs above 1.1700 vs the Usd and almost 1.1750 at one stage as dovish rate guidance continues undermine sentiment and highlight policy divergence vs the Fed. The headline pair failed to hold above a Fib around 1.1642 and is now testing key technical support at 1.1626, with a breach exposing 1.1600 ahead of another Fib down at 1.1575. The Pound, meanwhile, has been hit by negative Brexit news as EU chief negotiator Barnier dismissed the Chequers White Paper customs plan, and Cable is back below 1.3100 as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD/AUD - Relative outperformers, or at least holding their own against the Usd, with the Jpy containing losses beyond the 111.00 mark ahead of next Tuesday&rsquo;s BoJ meeting and a decent (near 1 bn) option expiry at 111.50 , the Loonie still bolstered by improved NAFTA deal prospects within 1.3050-80 parameters and the Aud resilient between 0.7370-95 even though the CNY and CNH are both on the ropes again (6.8000+) after a rebound in the PBoC&rsquo;s mid-point fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - Significantly weaker than forecast Swedish retail sales rattling the Krona, with Eur/Sek rallying towards 10.3000 vs Eur/NOK steady and sub-9.5500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - More pain for the Lira following Thursday&rsquo;s threat of additional sanctions by the US, as Usd/Try trades above 4.8500, but the Rouble and Rand are both keeping their heads above water, with Usd/Rub around 62.9800 and Usd/Zar just below 13.2500 ahead of the CBR rate decision (unchanged consensus) and after the SARB repeated a willingness to act if inflation exceeds target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from, or as well as bullish US GDP aspirations, other macro/fundamental impulses and cross-asset flows, technicals appear to be impacting trade to a degree in the run up to Friday&rsquo;s &lsquo;big&rsquo; and headline data event. In fact, Bunds are adhering very closely to the script having topped out at 162.18, as a market contact flags this level as near term resistance that would prompt offers if not breached, targeting 161.99 support vs the 161.97 new intraday Eurex low. Meanwhile, Gilts faded at 123.21 and have subsequently retreated to 123.05 for a 12 tick loss on the day and US Treasuries are essentially flat awaiting the advance look at Q2 growth before the final read of July&rsquo;s Michigan survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.2%) and Brent (-0.1%) trades lower on the day with both benchmarks just under USD 69.50/bbl and USD 74.50/bbl respectively. The Russian Energy Minister Novak emerged this morning to point out OPEC+ countries are not discussing options to boost production above 1mln BPD, adding Russia targets a 200K-250K BPD output hike from the 2016 quota. Traders will be eyeing any development in the Red Sea shipping lane (after reports yesterday that Saudi halted shipments amid rebel attacks) while the weekly Baker Hughes rig count is released later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spot gold (-0.2%) continues to be pressured by a firmer dollar. Meanwhile, global steel output (a gauge of economic health) jumped in the first half of the year after major producing countries ramped up production due to strong margins. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

On the flip-side, forecasts for US GDP are high and rising, with some looking for 5%+ growth, and this is keeping a lid on core bonds/prop under yields, alongside yet more chat about BoJ policy adjustments next week to allow more flexibility and lay the groundwork for an eventual unwind of its ultra-easy stance.

Pressure in JGBs was also exacerbated after the Rinban announcement in which the BoJ disappointed some calls for a special fixed-rate operation and instead stuck to its regular operation for 1yr-10yr JGBs. However, losses were pared heading into the EU open after the BoJ eventually announced an offer to buy unlimited amount of 5yr-10yr JGBs in fixed rate operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 370bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 540bln net injection.

Barnier stated that talks with UK Brexit Secretary Raab have been constructive and that he wants talks to be concluded in October but added there are still major issues to be discussed. Furthermore, Barnier said we agreed that future financial market access will be governed by autonomous decisions on both sides and that the UK wants the Irish backstop to be UK-wide which the EU do not object in principle to but are doubtful that it can be done, while he also commented the EU cannot delegate customs policy to Britain and any customs arrangement must respect this principle; effectively shooting down the Chequers deal.

Furthermore, the greenback was also aided by weakness in its main counterparts in which EUR/USD languished following an uneventful ECB meeting, while GBP/USD tested 1.3100 to the downside after EU chief Brexit negotiator Barnier effectively shot down PM May&rsquo;s Chequers plan in which he labelled the Facilitated Customs Arrangement as a non-starter and stated the proposal was little changed from what was presented a year ago. Elsewhere, antipodeans were lacklustre after recent declines in metals and a weaker fix by the PBoC which saw USD/CNY briefly approach the 6.8200 level, while JPY was firmer across the board on higher yields and expectations of a looming BoJ policy tweak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly quiet overnight as prices took a breather from yesterday&rsquo;s price action with WTI crude futures heading into European trade little changed above the USD 69/bbl level where it found support the prior day.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed after a similar varied performance on Wall St where focus remained on earnings season and Facebook&rsquo;s historic market cap wipeout. ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) are both higher with the Australian benchmark outperforming as it tests the 6300 level and approaches closer to its highest in over a decade. BHP is among the biggest gainers after it announced the sale of its US onshore assets to BP for USD 10.8bln and return the net proceeds to shareholders, while Japanese stocks have also gained and are being driven by earnings but with a firmer JPY capping upside. Conversely, China lags its regional peers with both Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) negative after the PBoC skipped open market operations all week which resulted to a net weekly drain of CNY 370bln, while China also signalled defiance regarding trade and are said to plan retaliating regardless of the amount of US tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback remains firm and has held on to the prior day&rsquo;s gains amid higher yields and expectations of a solid GDP report. Furthermore, the greenback was also aided by weakness in its main counterparts with EUR/USD languishing from an uneventful ECB which reiterated it expects key rates are to remain at present levels at least through the summer of 2019, while GBP/USD tests 1.3100 to the downside after EU chief Brexit negotiator Barnier effectively shot down PM May&rsquo;s Chequers plan which he stated was not new and little changed from what was presented a year ago. Elsewhere, antipodeans are also lacklustre after recent declines in metals and a weaker fix by the PBoC which saw USD/CNY briefly approach the 6.8200 level, while JPY is firmer across the board on higher yields and expectations of a looming policy tweak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as the 10yr yield rose to 0.1% for a 2nd consecutive day amid firmer than expected Tokyo CPI data and speculation of BoJ policy adjustments at its meeting next week. Pressure in JGBs was also exacerbated after the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement in which it stuck to a regular operation for 1yr-10yr JGBs and disappointed some suggestions it may announce a special fixed-rate operation for an unlimited amount of 10yr JGBs.</p>\r\n",
