At the conference Trump dismissed the criticism calling the news as fake and showed a much more positive stance on the US ties with the UK; he stated &lsquo;whatever&rsquo; the UK decided&nbsp; to do after Brexit is fine with him and defined the relationship between the two countries &quot;the highest level of special&quot;. Trump also touched on geopolitics, appearing hopeful for a good relationship with Russia whilst he reiterated the horrible trade relationship with the EU will change. UK PM May&rsquo;s focus was on Brexit, she confirmed the UK will leave the EU on the set date and the nation will pursue an ambitious UK/US trade deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* FED: The Fed&#39;s Monetary Policy report reiterated the Fed&rsquo;s case for gradual rate hikes &#39;consistent with a sustained expansion&#39; and noted that, on balance, the economic activity in the US appears to have expanded at a solid pace in the first half of 2018 noting valuations are &#39;elevated&#39; for some assets. Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan stated that he only expects one more rate hike this year but could be convinced of a fourth depending on how the outlook evolves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* BOE: BoE&#39;s Cunliffe noted a significant drop of activity in the UK was driven by poor weather and added it is likely the economy is expanding around or its potential growth rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* SPX +0.1% at 2801.20, NDX +0.1% at 7375.8, DJI +0.4% at 25018. SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +0.6%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.3%, Energy: +0.56%, Financials: -0.5%, Health Care: +0.2%, Industrials: +0.6%, Materials: 0.0%, Telecoms: -0.8%, Tech: 0.0%, Utilities: +0.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SPX hit a five-month high in early trade with the DJI breaking above 25,000 for the first time in over a month before paring back later in the session. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EARNINGS: Major US banks officially kicked off earnings season after reporting mixed numbers. Wells Fargo (WFC) fell 2% as it showed a bigger than forecasted drop in its quarterly profits due to slower lending and higher costs. Citigroup (C ) posted similar losses on the back of lower debt underwriting. On the flip side, JP Morgan (JPM) and PNC Financial (PNC) held in positive territory after reporting a beat on both top and bottom line. The results overall dragged the financial sector in the red.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: AT&amp;T (T) posted losses of 2% and weighed on the telecom sector on the news that the US DoJ launched an appeal on Friday against the USD 80bln merger of AT&amp;T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) after the deal won approval in June by a Judge who did not impose any conditions. Elsewhere, major retailers namely Ulta Beauty, Best Buy and Lowe&rsquo;s outperformed in the index and lifted the consumer non-cyclicals. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) was at the bottom of the DJI after being charged USD 4.69bln in damages in a lawsuit filed by women claiming some of its products containing asbestos caused cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 6+ TICKS HIGHER AT 120.11+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries held in positive ground on Friday amid decent volume on the buy side heading into the weekend and supported by marginal flow factors coming from Europe and Japan. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were lower by c.2bps. Spread were mixed as 2s5s and 2s10s narrowed by c.1bps whilst 5s30s widened by c.1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* WTI CRUDE FUTURES (Q8) SETTLE 68C HIGHER AT $71.01; BRENT (U8) SETTLES 88c HIGHER AT $75.33.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil drifted higher on Friday, on no major fundamentals, with prices supported by strike action continuing in Norway and by Russia reporting a lower than agreed oil production in June, touted by Russian Energy Minister Novak to be 120k bpd below the OPEC+ set level. The oil complex overall ended the second consecutive week lower amid easing supply in Libya, where major ports have reopened, and on the possibility Iran could still export some of its oil, though the French request for Iranian sanction waiver was rejected by the US on Friday. A decline of the highs was seen late in the session on reports that the Trump administration could tap the SPR to keep gasoline prices lower ahead of the mid-term elections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count (13 Jul) 863 (Prev. 863)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count (13 Jul) 1054 (Prev. 1052)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Gas Rig Count (13 Jul) 189 (Prev. 187)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* WEEKLY FX WRAP:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* DXY: Back on the 95.000 handle and on course to end the week stronger than it was before last Friday&rsquo;s US jobs data that sparked a broad Dollar sell-off. Firmer than expected inflation, ramped up US-China trade threats, a volatile, but ultimately renegotiated NATO deal and the demise of rival currencies has all combined to push the index back up, and not far from best levels seen so far in 2018 (95.531 at the end of June).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* NZD: Ending the week as worst G10 performer, but not necessarily the biggest loser overall, with a disappointing NZ manufacturing PMI adding to more general global tariff/protectionism tensions. The Kiwi is currently just under 0.6750 vs the Usd and considerably closer to circa 0.6725 lows than 0.6850+ peaks on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* CHF: Another big net loser vs the Usd, and Eur, with the Franc back below parity and down to fresh ytd lows near 1.0070, while the cross has hit 1.1700 after stops were tripped on a break of 1.1660. No real independent props for the Chf having traded as high as 0.9855 vs the Usd on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* GBP: A bad week for the Pound, largely on Brexit factors and more UK political instability after last Friday&rsquo;s cabinet summit at Chequers to formulate a White Paper. The perceived &lsquo;soft&rsquo; plan for a future relationship with the EU prompted more divisions within the Tory party and led to the resignations of Brexit Minister Davis and Foreign Secretary Johnson, while Cable tumbled from circa 1.3360 at the start of the week to effectively 1.3100 earlier today. Back up near 1.3175 now (where stops were triggered incidentally on the way down) after a joint press conference from UK PM May and US President Trump went a long, if not all the way towards denouncing reports that a soft Brexit would scotch any chance of a US-UK trade agreement (attributed to Trump).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EUR: Aside from the aforementioned Greenback revival, the single currency was undermined by a mixture of dovish-leaning ECB minutes (emphasizing the open-ended nature of QE and rate guidance in stark contrast to sources suggesting some GC members prefer tightening in July 2019 vs at least through Summer), re-positioning and bearish technicals &ndash; Eur/Usd down to 1.1610 vs 1.1790 at best before paring some losses into a decent (1.2 bn) option expiry at the 1.1650 strike at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* JPY: Perhaps the underperforming over the week on balance, and like the Eur partly on negative CB impulses, as sources claim that the BoJ may downgrade its inflation outlook again at the end of July policy meeting, to only reach target in 3 years. Usd/Jpy also saw stop-driven flows on the way up to almost 112.80 from 110.30 at the start of the week, as recent multi-peaks were cleared, major fibs and other chart resistance levels were breached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* CAD: The Loonie has endured a very volatile 2nd half, with a decent rally in wake of the BoC rate hike on Wednesday completely wiped out and more by the end of the day as oil prices plunged. Back to the policy meeting, a 25 bp tightening was almost unanimously anticipated and priced in, but the accompanying statement was upbeat overall as guidance was for more, albeit gradual and data pending, hikes, and factoring in headwinds caused by US-Canadian reciprocal import tariffs. Usd/Cad range for the week, 1.3220 (Thursday) to 1.3060 (Wednesday), and circa 1.3170 at present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/YUAN: Buffeted by global trade winds and the heightened US vs China tariff threat (up to $200 bn goods now being lined up for a 10% tax by the former, on top of the initial $34 bn already imposed and further $16 bn pending). The Aud failed several times ahead of 0.7500 vs the Usd and recoiled to a fresh 2018 low circa 0.7360 yesterday before recovering some composure due to no direct retaliation from Beijing, thus far. However, as the Cny and Cnh both weaken sharply, some are of the opinion that China is deploying other measures (weapons), with the former being fixed by the PBoc and off-shore Yuan down below levels (4.7000+) that previously prompted intervention (both verbally and actively via local banks).</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: unlucky Friday 13th (and week) for more than a few, but fine for the Usd",
        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back on the 95.000 handle and on course to end the week stronger than it was before last Friday&rsquo;s US jobs data that sparked a broad Dollar sell-off. Firmer than expected inflation, ramped up US-China trade threats, a volatile, but ultimately renegotiated NATO deal and the demise of rival currencies has all combined to push the index back up, and not far from best levels seen so far in 2018 (95.531 at the end of June).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending the week as worst G10 performer, but not necessarily the biggest loser overall, with a disappointing NZ manufacturing PMI adding to more general global tariff/protectionism tensions. The Kiwi is currently just under 0.6750 vs the Usd and considerably closer to circa 0.6725 lows than 0.6850+ peaks on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another big net loser vs the Usd, and Eur, with the Franc back below parity and down to fresh ytd lows near 1.0070, while the cross has hit 1.1700 after stops were tripped on a break of 1.1660. No real independent props for the Chf having traded as high as 0.9855 vs the Usd on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bad week for the Pound, largely on Brexit factors and more UK political instability after last Friday&rsquo;s cabinet summit at Chequers to formulate a White Paper. The perceived &lsquo;soft&rsquo; plan for a future relationship with the EU prompted more divisions within the Tory party and led to the resignations of Brexit Minister Davis and Foreign Secretary Johnson, while Cable tumbled from circa 1.3360 at the start of the week to effectively 1.3100 earlier today. Back up near 1.3175 now (where stops were triggered incidentally on the way down) after a joint press conference from UK PM May and US President Trump went a long, if not all the way towards denouncing reports that a soft Brexit would scotch any chance of a US-UK trade agreement (attributed to Trump).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the aforementioned Greenback revival, the single currency was undermined by a mixture of dovish-leaning ECB minutes (emphasizing the open-ended nature of QE and rate guidance in stark contrast to sources suggesting some GC members prefer tightening in July 2019 vs at least through Summer), re-positioning and bearish technicals &ndash; Eur/Usd down to 1.1610 vs 1.1790 at best before paring some losses into a decent (1.2 bn) option expiry at the 1.1650 strike at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the underperforming over the week on balance, and like the Eur partly on negative CB impulses, as sources claim that the BoJ may downgrade its inflation outlook again at the end of July policy meeting, to only reach target in 3 years. Usd/Jpy also saw stop-driven flows on the way up to almost 112.80 from 110.30 at the start of the week, as recent multi-peaks were cleared, major fibs and other chart resistance levels were breached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has endured a very volatile 2nd half, with a decent rally in wake of the BoC rate hike on Wednesday completely wiped out and more by the end of the day as oil prices plunged. Back to the policy meeting, a 25 bp tightening was almost unanimously anticipated and priced in, but the accompanying statement was upbeat overall as guidance was for more, albeit gradual and data pending, hikes, and factoring in headwinds caused by US-Canadian reciprocal import tariffs. Usd/Cad range for the week, 1.3220 (Thursday) to 1.3060 (Wednesday), and circa 1.3170 at present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/YUAN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buffeted by global trade winds and the heightened US vs China tariff threat (up to $200 bn goods now being lined up for a 10% tax by the former, on top of the initial $34 bn already imposed and further $16 bn pending). The Aud failed several times ahead of 0.7500 vs the Usd and recoiled to a fresh 2018 low circa 0.7360 yesterday before recovering some composure due to no direct retaliation from Beijing, thus far. However, as the Cny and Cnh both weaken sharply, some are of the opinion that China is deploying other measures (weapons), with the former being fixed by the PBoc and off-shore Yuan down below levels (4.7000+) that previously prompted intervention (both verbally and actively via local banks).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/TRY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tough week for the Swedish Krona on benign inflation data and dovish elements of the latest Riksbank minutes, while the Lira saw more investor angst and a fresh record low vs the Usd around 5.0000 in wake of the new Treasury and Finance Minister appointment by President Erdogan (handed the role to his son-in-law and removed 2 market favourites in the process). Back to the Sek, it fell to 10.3900+ vs the Eur at one stage on Friday vs 10.2175 at best on Monday.</p>\r\n",

This led to a positive open for ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) although the Australia index then floundered amid weakness in its top-weighted financials sector, while the Japanese benchmark sustained its outperformance as exporters cheered a weaker currency and with a surge in Fast Retailing on strong earnings. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) conformed to the predominantly positive risk tone in the region, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) was negative after the PBoC refrained from reverse repo operations and with some jitters ahead of Chinese Trade Data, although the mainland index has since moved off its lows after the PBoC later announced an MLF operation and after data printed mixed with a larger than expected surplus, which eased some of the data-related fears. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with demand sapped amid outperformance of riskier assets in Japan, although downside was also stemmed by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence for JPY 670bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC refrained from reverse repos, but later announced to lend CNY 188.5bln via 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility.

(Telegraph) This also comes amid reports that UK PM May could suffer the defeat of a crucial Brexit bill as early as Monday after Eurosceptics reacted angrily to the white paper she published yesterday. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said will sell all his equity holdings and buy US Treasuries. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are largely in the green, with the Euro Stoxx 50 (+0.2%) breaking through its 50DMA in late European trade yesterday and finding support at this level (3,452) this morning. Tech stocks are leading the gains (Infineon +1.7%, Micro Focus +4.3%) and all sectors positive as the positive sentiment from the US continues into European trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IBEX (-0.3%) is once again the only index in the red, and fallen through its 50DMA, with bank stocks extending the losses seen in yesterday&rsquo;s trade (BBVA -1.2%, Santander -1.1%). The FTSE 100 is outperforming as the GBP is softer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ThyssenKrupp (-0.6%) have named Guido Kerkhoff as their new CEO</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Debt futures have built up a head of steam and sufficient bullish momentum to breach upside levels that were holding firm, with Bunds through 163.00 and Gilts almost reaching 123.50, albeit in relatively thin trading conditions. The precise Eurex and Liffe intraday highs are 163.19 and 123.49, +42 and +34 ticks respectively, and the comparatively low Summer volumes may actually be exacerbating price moves, although the catalyst and impetus for buyers appears to have come from an unlikely or at least indirect source in the form of widespread Usd gains in FX markets. Back to bonds, and from a chart perspective Bunds will be eyeing channel resistance up at 163.40, while Gilts have 123.64 to aim for before 123.88. Turning to US Treasuries, more flattening and knock-on gains in keeping with their EU counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index is back above 95.000 and seemingly heading for strong close to the week, with momentum to challenge the current ytd high (95.531 from June 28) given blanket gains vs G10 peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD - An unfortunate, if not unlucky Friday 13th for the Pound and Kiwi thus far, with Cable hit by more negative White Paper headlines amidst reports that US President Trump has delivered a damning verdict via a warning to UK PM May about the &lsquo;soft&rsquo; proposal killing prospects of a trade deal between the 2 nations. Market contacts noted stops on a break of 1.3175 after the loss of 1.3200 and there is little in the way of support before the next psychological level at 1.3100 vs a circa 1.3105 low, and ahead of a speech from BoE&rsquo;s Cunliffe due at 12.30BST. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd has retreated through 0.6750 following a disappointing NZ manufacturing PMI overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency also a victim of overall Dollar strength, or vice-versa, and looking vulnerable for a deeper pull-back from recent peaks having breached some key chart supports (like the 20 DMA at 1.1654 and a 50% Fib at 1.649 from the 1.1508-1.1790 rally from 2018 low to nearly July peak), with 1.1600 next in sight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD - The Aud is back below 0.7400 after deriving some relative and temporary support from China&rsquo;s bigger than expected trade surplus overnight, while the Loonie is back down near 1.3200 vs the Usd and also feeling the weight of another retreat in crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Both extending recent losses vs the Greenback, with BoJ sources suggesting another push-back in inflation target expectations at the end of month policy meeting sparking a further rise in the headline pair through any residual supply at 112.50 to 112.80, and with 113.00 the obvious objective. Similarly, Usd/Chf is grinding higher with no real support for the Franc via a pick-up in Swiss producer/import prices (y/y), and this year&rsquo;s previous high at 1.0057 now only 5 pips away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNH - The off-shore Yuan is back below 4.7000 vs the Usd and levels that prompted intervention not so long ago, both verbal and physical, but no official or unofficial &lsquo;action&rsquo; seen so far to leave conspiracy theorists thinking about devaluation in the US-China trade dispute rather than counter import tariff measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is currently in the red, with Brent -1.0% and WTI -0.3% as we approach the weeks end, and is set for its second consecutive weekly fall. Both measures are finding support at moving average levels, however, with WTI still supported by its 50DMA (USD 69.43/BBL), and Brent finding support at its 100DMA (USD 73.07/BBL) level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Energy Minister Novak said he is not ruling out an output adjustment depending on other countries or a quick move on >1mln BPD from OPEC+ if needed. He also said he sees Russia&#39;s output boost by the end of July at 200k BPD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold prices are sliding as the DXY is extending its rally past the 95.000 level. Shanghai steel has hit a 10 month high on the back of low inventories and source reports suggesting the closure of steel mills in China&rsquo;s largest steel making city, Tangshan, for 5 days amid pollution concerns. Copper is down 0.5% and set for the 5th consecutive weekly fall as US-China trade concerns are weighing on the construction material.</p>\r\n",

Tech stocks are leading the gains (Infineon +2.2%, Micro Focus +5.0%) and all sectors positive as the positive sentiment from the US continues into European trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IBEX (-0.3%) is once again the only index in the red, and fallen through its 50DMA, with bank stocks extending the losses seen in yesterday&rsquo;s trade (BBVA -1.0%, Santander -1.1%). The FTSE 100 is outperforming as the GBP is softer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ThyssenKrupp (+0.3%) have named Guido Kerkhoff as their new CEO</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index is back above 95.000 and seemingly heading for strong close to the week, with momentum to challenge the current ytd high (95.531 from June 28) given blanket gains vs G10 peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD - An unfortunate, if not unlucky Friday 13th for the Pound and Kiwi thus far, with Cable hit by more negative White Paper headlines amidst reports that US President Trump has delivered a damning verdict via a warning to UK PM May about the &lsquo;soft&rsquo; proposal killing prospects of a trade deal between the 2 nations. Market contacts noted stops on a break of 1.3175 after the loss of 1.3200 and there is little in the way of support before the next psychological level at 1.3100 vs a circa 1.3105 low, and ahead of a speech from BoE&rsquo;s Cunliffe due at 12.30BST. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd has retreated through 0.6750 following a disappointing NZ manufacturing PMI overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency also a victim of overall Dollar strength, or vice-versa, and looking vulnerable for a deeper pull-back from recent peaks having breached some key chart supports (like the 20 DMA at 1.1654 and a 50% Fib at 1.649 from the 1.1508-1.1790 rally from 2018 low to nearly July peak), with 1.1600 next in sight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD - The Aud is back below 0.7400 after deriving some relative and temporary support from China&rsquo;s bigger than expected trade surplus overnight, while the Loonie is back down near 1.3200 vs the Usd and also feeling the weight of another retreat in crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Both extending recent losses vs the Greenback, with BoJ sources suggesting another push-back in inflation target expectations at the end of month policy meeting sparking a further rise in the headline pair through any residual supply at 112.50 to 112.80, and with 113.00 the obvious objective. Similarly, Usd/Chf is grinding higher with no real support for the Franc via a pick-up in Swiss producer/import prices (y/y), and this year&rsquo;s previous high at 1.0057 now only 15 pips away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNH - The off-shore Yuan is back below 4.7000 vs the Usd and levels that prompted intervention not so long ago, both verbal and physical, but no official or unofficial &lsquo;action&rsquo; seen so far to leave conspiracy theorists thinking about devaluation in the US-China trade dispute rather than counter import tariff measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Debt futures have built up a head of steam and sufficient bullish momentum to breach upside levels that were holding firm, with Bunds through 163.00 and Gilts almost reaching 123.50, albeit in relatively thin trading conditions. The precise Eurex and Liffe intraday highs are 163.13 and 123.49, +36 and +34 ticks respectively, and the comparatively low Summer volumes may actually be exacerbating price moves, although the catalyst and impetus for buyers appears to have come from an unlikely or at least indirect source in the form of widespread Usd gains in FX markets. Back to bonds, and from a chart perspective Bunds will be eyeing channel resistance up at 163.40, while Gilts have 123.64 to aim for before 123.88. Turning to US Treasuries, more flattening and knock-on gains in keeping with their EU counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is currently in the red, with Brent -1.0% and WTI -0.3% as we approach the weeks end, and is set for its second consecutive weekly fall. Both measures are finding support at moving average levels, however, with WTI still supported by its 50DMA (USD 69.43/BBL), and Brent finding support at its 100DMA (USD 73.07/BBL) level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold prices are sliding as the DXY is extending its rally past the 95.000 level. Shanghai steel has hit a 10 month high on the back of low inventories and source reports suggesting the closure of steel mills in China&rsquo;s largest steel making city, Tangshan, for 5 days amid pollution concerns. Copper is down 0.5% and set for the 5th consecutive weekly fall as US-China trade concerns are weighing on the construction material.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index is back above 95.000 and seemingly heading for strong close to the week, with momentum to challenge the current ytd high (95.531 from June 28) given blanket gains vs G10 peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An unfortunate, if not unlucky Friday 13th for the Pound and Kiwi thus far, with Cable hit by more negative White Paper headlines amidst reports that US President Trump has delivered a damning verdict via a warning to UK PM May about the &lsquo;soft&rsquo; proposal killing prospects of a trade deal between the 2 nations. Market contacts noted stops on a break of 1.3175 after the loss of 1.3200 and there is little in the way of support before the next psychological level at 1.3100 vs a circa 1.3115 low, and ahead of a speech from BoE&rsquo;s Cunliffe due at 12.30BST. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd has retreated through 0.6750 following a disappointing NZ manufacturing PMI overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency also a victim of overall Dollar strength, or vice-versa, and looking vulnerable for a deeper pull-back from recent peaks having breached some key chart supports (like the 20 DMA at 1.1654 and a 50% Fib at 1.649 from the 1.1508-1.1790 rally from 2018 low to nearly July peak), with 1.1600 next in sight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aud is back below 0.7400 after deriving some relative and temporary support from China&rsquo;s bigger than expected trade surplus overnight, while the Loonie is back down near 1.3200 vs the Usd and also feeling the weight of another retreat in crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both extending recent losses vs the Greenback, with BoJ sources suggesting another push-back in inflation target expectations at the end of month policy meeting sparking a further rise in the headline pair through any residual supply at 112.50 to 112.80, and with 113.00 the obvious objective. Similarly, Usd/Chf is grinding higher with no real support for the Franc via a pick-up in Swiss producer/import prices (y/y), and this year&rsquo;s previous high at 1.0057 now only 15 pips away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The off-shore Yuan is back below 4.7000 vs the Usd and levels that prompted intervention not so long ago, both verbal and physical, but no official or unofficial &lsquo;action&rsquo; seen so far to leave conspiracy theorists thinking about devaluation in the US-China trade dispute rather than counter import tariff measures.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) conformed to the predominantly positive risk tone in the region, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) was negative after the PBoC refrained from reverse repo operations and with some jitters ahead of Chinese Trade Data, although the mainland index has since moved off its lows after the PBoC later announced an MLF operation and after data printed mixed with a larger than expected surplus, which eased some of the data-related fears. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with demand sapped amid outperformance of riskier assets in Japan, although downside was also stemmed by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence for JPY 670bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FTSE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BT (BT/A LN) &ndash; The co. has lost UK broadcasting rights for Serie A matches to rival Eleven Sports.

This led to a positive open for ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.1%) although the Australia index then floundered amid weakness in its top-weighted financials sector, while the Japanese benchmark sustained its outperformance as exporters cheered a weaker currency and with a surge in Fast Retailing on strong earnings. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) conformed to the predominantly positive risk tone in the region, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) was negative after the PBoC refrained from reverse repo operations and with some jitters ahead of Chinese Trade Data, although the mainland index has since moved off its lows after the PBoC later announced an MLF operation and after data printed mixed with a larger than expected surplus, which eased some of the data-related fears. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with demand sapped amid outperformance of riskier assets in Japan, although downside was also stemmed by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence for JPY 670bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>PBoC refrained from reverse repos, but later announced to lend CNY 188.5bln via 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>US President Trump has warned UK PM May that a soft Brexit would probably kill a potential future trade deal between UK and US as they would be dealing with the EU instead of the UK. (Telegraph) This also comes amid reports that UK PM May could suffer the defeat of a crucial Brexit bill as early as Monday after Eurosceptics reacted angrily to the white paper she published yesterday. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>French finance minister Le Maire said if the US trade war persists, EU will take new decisions and commented that specific deal on autos with the US threatens jobs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>FX markets remained uneventful during Asia-Pac trade with the DXY flat but in proximity to retest the 95.00 level to the upside, while EUR/USD consolidated at yesterday&rsquo;s levels below 1.1700 and GBP/USD mildly underperformed after reports that US President Trump is said to warn UK PM May a soft Brexit would probably kill a potential future UK-US trade deal. Elsewhere. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were underpinned by the risk appetite, which also helped high-beta currencies hold on to recent gains.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>WTI crude futures were relatively unmoved alongside quiet overnight trade across commodities and ahead of the contract rollover this weekend, although prices are back above USD 70/bbl after having briefly slipped below it on Thursday in a mild extension of the aggressive pullback seen mid-week. Elsewhere, gold was slightly dampened and the greenback held steadfast and copper traded flat as the mostly positive risk tone provided a base for prices.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>CME raised RBOB gasoline futures margins to USD 4000 per contract from USD 3450 per contract for August. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>US</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>The treasury complex moved sideways on Thursday. The yield curve modestly bear-flattened with most of the yields higher by under 2bps. Major curve spreads saw another session of flattening by c.1bps; 2s10s fell to as low as 25bps for another fresh low, while 2s30s and 5s30s also narrowed by 2bps and 1bps respectively. US 10YR T-notes futures (u8) settled 3 ticks lower at 120-05.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Fed&rsquo;s Powell (Chair, Neutral) reiterated the Fed is hearing concerns regarding trade wars and that sustained high tariffs could be a negative for the economy. Furthermore, Powell said low wage growth is a puzzle, but added the labour market is strong by any measure and the US economy is in a really good place. (Marketplace)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Fed&rsquo;s Harker (Non-Voter, Dove) stated he welcomes 4 rate hikes this year if inflation accelerates, but added he still sees 3 hikes this year and that Fed rate hikes could lift policy rate to 3.00%-3.25%. Furthermore, Harker said inflation is moving towards the 2% target, while he also noted the inflation goal is symmetric and he would be comfortable for inflation to move to 2.5%.

This led to a positive open for ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) although the Australia index then floundered amid weakness in its top-weighted financials sector, while the Japanese benchmark sustained its outperformance as exporters cheer a weaker currency and with Fast Retailing surging on strong earnings. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) is negative after the PBoC refrained from reverse repo operations but instead later announced to lend though its Medium-term Lending Facility and with Chinese Trade Data eyed, while Hang Seng (+0.4%) conforms to the predominantly positive tone across the rest of the regional bourses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets continue to lack any major drivers for Asia-Pac trade with the DXY flat but in proximity to retest the 95.00 level to the upside, while EUR/USD consolidates at yesterday&rsquo;s levels below 1.1700 and GBP/USD slightly underperforms after reports that US President Trump is said to warn UK PM May a soft Brexit would probably kill a potential future UK-US trade deal as they would be dealing with the EU instead of the UK. Elsewhere. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses remain underpinned by the risk appetite, which has also helped high-beta currencies hold on to recent gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand sapped amid outperformance of riskier assets in Japan, although downside is also stemmed by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence for JPY 670bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end.</p>\r\n",
