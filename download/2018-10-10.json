There was little if any movement after PPI data. The complex was taking its cue from the wider risk environment (risk-off) as stocks sold-off, VIX rose, and oil ran into sellers. The US Treasury sold USD 36bln of 3-year notes tailing by 0.2bps at a high yield of 2.989, the highest since May 2007.

Italian Economy Minister Tria stated the government is to keep fiscal targets despite the rejection, stressing the economic forecasts were approved and views only differed on the growth forecast of 1.5% and therefore he expects a compromise. He unveiled more details about the budget plan which next year will amount to EUR 22bln whilst Interior Minister Salvini noted EUR 1.7bln will be dedicated to the flat tax. Finally, Italy&#39;s League Lawmaker Bagnai says a sovereign debt downgrade is possible due to the climate that has been created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECONOMIC ADVISOR HASSET</strong> said the White House respects the independence of the Fed and noted a strong dollar is part of the strong US economy. He expressed concern over emerging markets and is hopeful that the US making trade deals with other countries will bring China to the table. Commenting on the oil market, he believes oil prices are a risk to the economic outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Optimism around Brexit continued on Wednesday as EU Barnier noted 80%-85% of the Brexit deal has been agreed with the UK, noting they are doing their best to reach an agreement on an orderly withdrawal. He highlighted they are still negotiating on governance, geographical indicators and the Irish border. In terms of concessions, he said the EU is ready to cooperate closely with the UK over financial services, on a free trade area with the UK as well as in keeping a customs union. Elsewhere, EU Diplomatic sources reported that the EU is no longer expecting a separate new proposal from Britain on the Irish Border, with negotiators on both sides looking for an agreement in direct talks. This followed from yesterday when UK PM May&#39;s negotiator Robbins reported meaningful progress was made in talks with EU&#39;s Chief Negotiator Barnier on the Irish border backstop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PPI</strong> for September rose 0.2% in line with expectations; analysts at Pantheon note the trend before August was edging close to 0.3% and therefore it seems like the recent surge in oil prices is beginning to fade. Core goods rose 0.2% whilst Core services were up 0.3% lifted by a 5.5% increase in airline fares amid rising fuel prices. Pantheon also noted that although the correlation between PPI and CPI airfares is low, this does raise the risk of an unexpected jump in CPI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed&#39;s Evans (Non-Voter, Dove) noted we have got a &quot;little bit more to go&quot; on hikes before reaching neutral of 2.75%-3%. On the economy he said it is doing quite well on inflation and employment, he expects the unemployment rate to bottom out at 3.5% and then to rise slowly to about 4.5%. He sees growth at 3.2% this year and at 2.5% next year and believes wages have been rising but not as much as you would expect. He also pointed out it is unusual for the President to comment on monetary policy, but noted that asking why rates need to rise is a fair question. He believes tariff GDP effects on a national level could only be a few tenths of a percentage point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -3.27% at 2786, NDX -1.65% at 7250, DJI -3.13% at 25604.

US stocks under pressure lead lower by tech in early trade; further pressured as the VIX continued its march higher, rising over 20.0 for the first time since April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Perrigo (PRGO) was a top mover on the day, paring back yesterday&rsquo;s losses. Campbell Soup (CPB) caught a bid after Daniel Loeb&rsquo;s Third Point increased its stake, and other food processing names also gained on the day including General Mills (GIS), Kraft Heinz (KHC) and JM Smucker (SJM). Tech stocks were the down the most on the day with Netflix (NFLX) taking a big hit, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) also pulled indexes down on the back of reports a top Republican senator is demanding a briefing on potential malicious hardware in their devices.

Today&#39;s cocktail of bearishness seemed to be driven by a few factors, including fragile risk sentiment, which saw equities sell-off while Treasury futures were bid. Traders also continued to cite the IMF report from earlier in the week, where it trimmed global growth estimates. On Wednesday, the EIA&#39;s monthly report saw the organisation cut forecasts for 2018 world oil demand growth, though 2019 was raised; the EIA also forecast US crude production will continue to tick higher thorugh 2018 and 2019. Hurricanes are also in vogue, and traders were citing comments from an energy economist at WTRG Economics, who noted that &quot;while [Hurricane Michael] may be the most damaging hurricane in decades, it turns out to be a non-event for oil and gas production. We now know the hurricane will not damage production areas, so the shut-in production will return to normal within [four to five] days as the platforms are repopulated with workers.&quot; Also adding bearish pressure on Wednesday, Libya&#39;s oil production levels continue to tick up, with the NOC chief saying it had hit 1.3mln BPD (note at the end of September, it was running at a clip around 1.05mln BPD). On Wednesday, Iran said it wants to supply 1mln barrels of crude at the Energy Stock Exchange by the end of October; Iran are to offer the oil via their own exchange as US sanctions will prevent the nation from exporting much of its crude, and there is a suggestion that this approach is being taken as Iran has no intention of curtailing its oil production. After the bell, the API will report weekly inventories (delayed by a day on account of the Columbus Day holiday on Monday), and the DOE will publish its inventory data on Thursday. Analysts expect headline crude stocks to build by 2.6mln, Cushing stocks are seen building 1.7mln (vs 28/September); products are seen drawing, with the street expecting gasoline stocks to draw 200k barrels, and distillates to draw by 1.9mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 2 TICKS LOWER AT 117-24.&nbsp;</strong>US Treasuries ended Wednesday session undecided as, despite the general risk-off tone, the heavy supply this week may have limited upside action. Most of the selling action was seen at the long-end of the curve were yields were higher by c.2bps whilst buying action was in the short end sending yields lower by c.2bps. There was little if any movement after PPI data. The complex was taking its cue from the wider risk environment (risk-off) as stocks sold-off, VIX rose, and oil ran into sellers. The US Treasury sold USD 36bln of 3-year notes tailing by 0.2bps at a high yield of 2.989, the highest since May 2007. Demand was weak as indicated by the bid-to-cover which was the lowest since July. Directs took the smallest share since July whilst indirects the biggest portion since June leaving dealers with a share well within recent averages. The US Treasury also sold &nbsp;USD 23bln 10-year bonds, tailing by 0.3bps; demand was scarce and cover was below the 6-week average. Indirects were awarded the biggest portion since July, directs took the smallest share since February and dealers took the largest share since April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD:</strong> The rationale or catalyst remains unclear or uncertain, but moderately softer than consensus US PPI, ahead of CPI on Thursday, broadly coincided with a loss of the Dollar&rsquo;s recovery momentum, if not its actual reversal. Another dip in Treasury yields may also be offered up as a valid factor, before long bonds tomorrow, so the downturn looks more positional and indirectly due to relative gains elsewhere, as the DXY slips back to 95.500 levels vs almost 95.800 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, EUR: </strong>Both ending whippy Wednesday&rsquo;s back in the ascendency vs the Greenback, with Cable inching a bit closer to 1.3200 and still riding on the crest of a Brexit wave amidst further reports suggesting progress towards a deal between the UK and EU in time for next week&rsquo;s Summit. Meanwhile, the single currency withstood more Italian fiscal fluctuations to reclaim 1.1500+ status and clear option expiries from the figure to 1.1505 in 1.5 bn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> Another major currency to rebound from lows against the Usd, and now staging a more serious attempt to overcome chart resistance around 112.73 (key Fib) having held in circa 113.30 at the other extreme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF:</strong> Also testing recent range highs with added vigour, and indicative of broader risk-off sentiment (as the VIX also climbs again) as the Franc regains a degree of safe-haven allure. Usd/Chf close to 0.9900 and Eur/Chf easing towards 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD, CAD:</strong> All bucking the overall trend and not benefiting from their US counterpart&rsquo;s demise, as the Kiwi struggles to revisit overnight peaks not far from 0.6500 and the Aud remains capped ahead of 0.7100. Ongoing US-China strains on the trade and wider protectionist front are weighing alongside more specific factors impacting other high betas like EMs. Usd/Cad extend gains in US trade, hitting session highs just below 1.3050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM:</strong> A pretty poor session virtually across the board, as the Brl suffered from renewed political angst amidst investigations into fraud against Bolsonaro&rsquo;s pick for Brazilian Finance Minister, while the Zar lost some shine after initially greeting SA&rsquo;s new Finance Minister with open arms. However, the Try regained some traction following Tuesday&rsquo;s new measures to combat target-busting Turkish inflation having given them the thumbs down at first glance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PRIMER:</strong> ECB September Minutes due to be released Thursday 11th October at 1230BST/0630CDT. As was the case with the July meeting, September&rsquo;s policy announcement delivered little in the way of fireworks with the governing council&rsquo;s statement broadly unchanged from the prior release. The press conference saw Draghi note that incoming data confirmed the Bank&rsquo;s previous assessment that growth is broad-based, inflation is rising and the strength of the economy supports confidence. In terms of the latest economic projections 2018 and 2019 growth forecasts were lowered to 2.0% and 1.8% respectively with all other projections maintained. As such, this aspect of the release will likely garner little attention from markets this time around. Instead, markets once again might instead opt to focus on whether there was a more detailed discussion on the Bank&rsquo;s reinvestment policy; something which Draghi stated was not discussed but will be a topic of discussion at one of the meetings before year-end (note, Draghi&rsquo;s account of proceedings can differ from the official account). Furthermore, markets are still eager to pin the Bank down on a precise timing for the next rate hike but are likely to be left disappointed by this month&rsquo;s account. On this matter, ECB&rsquo;s Knot recently stated that the ECB are comfortable with the wording of forward guidance adding that a hike may come sooner or later than guided. Knot even went on to state that one potential option for the Bank would be publishing how many times they intend to raise rates in a given year. However, such discussions at this stage appear to be more theoretical (possibly confined to the hawks at the ECB) and are unlikely to be detailed in the account of the September meeting; Knot suggested the ECB will begin discussions on the timing of rate lift-off in January. Finally, there might have been some discussion regarding the risks surrounding Italy but such discussions could be considered stale by the market given that the meeting was 4 weeks ago.</p>\r\n",

Hurricanes are also in vogue, and traders were citing comments from an energy economist at WTRG Economics, who noted that &quot;while [Hurricane Michael] may be the most damaging hurricane in decades, it turns out to be a non-event for oil and gas production. We now know the hurricane will not damage production areas, so the shut-in production will return to normal within [four to five] days as the platforms are repopulated with workers.&quot; Also adding bearish pressure on Wednesday, Libya&#39;s oil production levels continue to tick up, with the NOC chief saying it had hit 1.3mln BPD (note at the end of September, it was running at a clip around 1.05mln BPD).

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rationale or catalyst remains unclear or uncertain, but moderately softer than consensus US PPI, ahead of CPI on Thursday, broadly coincided with a loss of the Dollar&rsquo;s recovery momentum, if not its actual reversal. Another dip in Treasury yields may also be offered up as a valid factor, but in truth they remain elevated in the run up to 3 and 10 year supply, before long bonds tomorrow, so the downturn looks more positional and indirectly due to relative gains elsewhere, as the DXY slips back to sub-95.500 levels vs almost 95.800 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clear G10 winner and most consistent outperformer after early EU session data showing upside beats in Norwegian core and headline inflation metrics &ndash; Eur/Nok extending its retreat from close to 9.5100 ahead of the CPI release to 9.4400 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both ending whippy Wednesday&rsquo;s back in the ascendency vs the Greenback, with Cable inching a bit closer to 1.3200 and still riding on the crest of a Brexit wave amidst further reports suggesting progress towards a deal between the UK and EU in time for next week&rsquo;s Summit. Meanwhile, the single currency withstood more Italian fiscal fluctuations to reclaim 1.1500+ status and clear option expiries from the figure to 1.1505 in 1.5 bn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major currency to rebound from lows against the Usd, and now staging a more serious attempt to overcome chart resistance around 112.73 (key Fib) having held in circa 113.30 at the other extreme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also testing recent range highs with added vigour, and indicative of broader risk-off sentiment (as the VIX also climbs again) as the Franc regains a degree of safe-haven allure. Usd/Chf close to 0.9900 and Eur/Chf easing towards 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All bucking the overall trend and not benefiting from their US counterpart&rsquo;s demise, as the Kiwi struggles to revisit overnight peaks not far from 0.6500 and the Aud remains capped ahead of 0.7100. Ongoing US-China strains on the trade and wider protectionist front are weighing alongside more specific factors impacting other high betas like EMs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pretty poor session virtually across the board, as the Brl suffered from renewed political angst amidst investigations into fraud against Bolsonaro&rsquo;s pick for Brazilian Finance Minister, while the Zar lost some shine after initially greeting SA&rsquo;s new Finance Minister with open arms. However, the Try regained some traction following Tuesday&rsquo;s new measures to combat target-busting Turkish inflation having given them the thumbs down at first glance.</p>\r\n",

The timing of the auctions could cause the market some issues at a time when it has been struggling to digest larger auction sizes,&quot; UBS fixed income strategists said, &quot;on Wednesday the treasury issues both US 3y and US 10y bonds, but the real test for the market will be Thursday&#39;s USD 15bn of US 30-year, especially given the recent steepening of the UST curve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FED ADD-ONS:</strong> There are no Fed holdings maturing at the mid-month settlement, TD Securities notes.

Over the last three auctions, dealer takedown has been edging lower (51.3% in July vs 43.0% in September), the tail size has narrowed (0.6bps in July vs 0.1bps in September); over that same period, direct participation has risen, but the rise in indirect participation has been more notable (39.6% in July vs 46.3% in September).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US to sell USD 36bln of 3-year notes on 10 October 2018 at 1630 BST/1130 EST</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>&bull; High-yield: prev. 2.821% vs 6-auction average of 2.757%</li>\r\n  <li>&bull; Tail: prev. 0.1bps vs 6-auction average of 0.2bps</li>\r\n  <li>&bull; Bid/cover: prev. 2.68x vs 6-auction average of 2.71x</li>\r\n  <li>&bull; Dealers: prev. 43.0% vs 6-auction average of 43.7%</li>\r\n  <li>&bull; Direct: prev. 10.7% vs 6-auction average of 10.8%</li>\r\n  <li>&bull; Indirect: prev. 46.3% vs 6-auction average of 45.5%</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US to sell USD 23bln of 10-year notes on 10 October 2018 at 1800 BST/1300 EST </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>The past few 10-year auctions has seen solid demand, TD Securities says. &quot;Averages suggest that strong auctions are likely to continue, and we believe higher yields could draw end-user participation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION RECENT HISTORY:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>&bull; High-yield: prev. 2.957% vs 6-auction average of 2.921%</li>\r\n  <li>&bull; Tail: prev. -0.5bps vs 6-auction average of -0.1bps</li>\r\n  <li>&bull; Bid/cover: prev. 2.58x vs 6-auction average of 2.55x</li>\r\n  <li>&bull; Dealers: prev. 22.6% vs 6-auction average of 28.2%</li>\r\n  <li>&bull; Direct: prev. 13.4% vs 6-auction average of 11.4%</li>\r\n  <li>&bull; Indirect: prev. 63.9% vs 6-auction average of 60.4%</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The article stated, &quot;The most important development would be that the EU seems close to agreeing that the backstop would apply to the whole UK and not just to Northern Ireland, as it originally demanded - or at least it would apply to the whole UK for customs.&quot; (ITV)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is reportedly to &quot;force&quot; cabinet into a new Brexit compromise, while a government source said that ministers feared they could be bounced into swallowing several potential changes to the customs arrangement, and the areas of EU law that the UK must follow after Brexit. A separate article by The Times reported that around 30 Labour MPs are said to be prepared to support UK PM May&#39;s Chequers deal.

To recap, the broad Dollar and DXY recoiled from best levels in relatively quick order, with the index down to 95.500 vs 96.000+ and circa 95.750 now, as rival currencies also derived bullish momentum on independent factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The Pound has run into some resistance and profit taking headwinds ahead of 1.3200 in Cable and around 0.8725 vs the Eur, but retains a firm underlying bid on another boost in Brexit deal prospects after reports that the UK and EU are getting even closer to resolving the remaining issues (regarding Ireland), and could get over the line by Monday, &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; ahead of the October summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Back below 113.00 vs the Usd and still unable to really test a key Fib level at 112.73, but perhaps drawn towards decent option interest from the big figure to 113.05 (1.2 bn) if the headline pair fails to break above 113.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - Also giving way to a general Usd recovery having outperformed overnight on strong data and upbeat surveys along with a rise in iron ore shipments to China.

Note, option expiry interest may factor into the NY cut with 1.5 bn running off between 1.1500-10. Meanwhile, the Franc is meandering between 0.9905-35 and Loonie within a 1.2965-25 range having derived support from offers at and around 1.3000, but not breaching all the downside interest said to be residing from 1.2930-20.

Eur/Nok down from almost 9.5100 to sub-9.4500 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Some retracement from peaks for the Zar after a broadly positive reaction to the new SA Finance Minister appointment, while in contrast the Try has pared losses following initial disappointment over the Turkish Government&rsquo;s inflation-fighting measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both WTI and Brent are down just under 0.5%, trading just under USD 75/bbl and USD 85/bbl following further supply shortages from Hurricane Michael with 40% of Gulf of Mexico production now suspended in preparation.

However, the latest upturn in Italian debt cannot be discounted as a bearish impulse for core bonds, with BTPs just eclipsing their opening high at 120.52 before the latest comments from Rome, and further persistence to push ahead with the MTP regardless of outside opposition and interference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the latest rebound in US Treasury yields and bear-steepening with 3 and 10 year notes looming before long bonds on Thursday.

However, the latest upturn in Italian debt cannot be discounted as a bearish impulse for core bonds, with BTPs just eclipsing their opening high at 120.52 before the latest comments from Rome, and further persistence to push ahead with the MTP regardless of outside opposition and interference.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback has regained some composure overall after Tuesday&rsquo;s rather sharp and abrupt sell-off on a degree of US Treasury yield retracement, and to a lesser extent another expression of dissent about the rate of Fed tightening from President Trump. To recap, the broad Dollar and DXY recoiled from best levels in relatively quick order, with the index down to 95.500 vs 96.000+ and circa 95.750 now, as rival currencies also derived bullish momentum on independent factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound has run into some resistance and profit taking headwinds ahead of 1.3200 in Cable and around 0.8725 vs the Eur, but retains a firm underlying bid on another boost in Brexit deal prospects after reports that the UK and EU are getting even closer to resolving the remaining issues (regarding Ireland), and could get over the line by Monday, &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; ahead of the October summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back below 113.00 vs the Usd and still unable to really test a key Fib level at 112.73, but perhaps drawn towards decent option interest from the big figure to 113.05 (1.2 bn) if the headline pair fails to break above 113.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also giving way to a general Usd recovery having outperformed overnight on strong data and upbeat surveys along with a rise in iron ore shipments to China. The Kiwi has pulled back from just shy of 0.6500 to 0.6455 and the Aud from 0.7130 to 0.7090, while the cross remains capped ahead of 1.1000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All holding up better against the Greenback (comparatively) , with the single currency pivoting 1.1500 and displaying resilience in the face of more Italian Government intransigence over its budget plans and fiscal policies. Note, option expiry interest may factor into the NY cut with 1.5 bn running off between 1.1500-10. Meanwhile, the Franc is meandering between 0.9905-35 and Loonie within a 1.2965-25 range having derived support from offers at and around 1.3000, but not breaching all the downside interest said to be residing from 1.2930-20. Canadian building permits ahead after weaker than forecast housing starts yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A major outperformer, and largely on significantly stronger than expected Norwegian CPI that will keep the Norges Bank on track to continue policy normalisation. Eur/Nok down from almost 9.5100 to sub-9.4500 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some retracement from peaks for the Zar after a broadly positive reaction to the new SA Finance Minister appointment, while in contrast the Try has pared losses following initial disappointment over the Turkish Government&rsquo;s inflation-fighting measures.</p>\r\n",

On that note, trade in BTPs has been considerably more erratic, as usual, with an initial mark-up to 120.50 from Tuesday&rsquo;s 119.30 settlement price immediately sold into and the 10 year future now attempting to consolidate off a 119.55 low. Government officials continue to insist no change to budget plans irrespective of criticism, concern and doubt about how realistic or achievable they might be, with Salvini also expressing confidence that the yield premium over Germany will not diverge further to 400 bp, which might be seen as intervention and an attempt to turn the tide or simply a challenge for bears to pounce and test what appears to be a tolerance limit.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pacific equity markets trade mixed as the region mimics the lead from Wall St. where the S&amp;P notched its fourth day of losses while the Nasdaq snapped its three-day losing streak. The Dow closed in the red as the major indices swung between positive and negative territory throughout the day. ASX 200 (+0.2%) is supported by strength in the healthcare and consumer discretionary sectors, while Nikkei 225 (Unch) gains are capped on currency effect. Elsewhere, China is mixed with Hang Seng (+0.5%) supported by oil names while Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) trades with no firm direction after opening in the green. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback trades little changed whilst in a tight range following a pullback to levels close to 95.50. Subsequently, EUR/USD and GBP/USD are marginally higher, above 1.1500 and 1.3150 respectively, while USD/JPY straddles around the 113.00 key psychological level. Elsewhere, antipodeans are outperforming amid a rise in iron ore shipments to China alongside decent data in the form of NZ electronic card retail sales (which account for almost 70% of core NZ retail sales) and an improvement in Australia&rsquo;s Westpac consumer confidence.</p>\r\n",
