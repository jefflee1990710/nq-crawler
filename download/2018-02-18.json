After this week&rsquo;s CPI and retail sales data, there hasn&rsquo;t been anything specific for FX traders to latch on to, and data and politics have generally played second fiddle to position adjusting. Many now are resuming the narrative of a weaker dollar based on expected twin deficits, trade protectionism, and other central banks playing catch-up to the US tightening cycle &ndash; helping their currencies appreciate &ndash; all amid a background of decent global growth. EUR gave up the 1.25 handle, GBP gave up 1.41, and JPY climbed back above 106 after falling to 105.50 overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 34 cents higher at $61.68 per barrel; Brent futures settle 51 cents higher at $64.84 per barrel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crude complex was shaken in the early part of the week by bearish updates from the EIA, IEA as well as OPEC, whose forecasts all showed that global supply growth was set to outpace demand growth. However, at the end of the week &ndash; and looking with a wider lens &ndash; crude has generally looked-through the news, in part supported by comments from Saudi Arabia and Russia (Saudis set to trim production next month), but mainly taking its cue from &lsquo;recovering&rsquo; global risk sentiment and optimism about global growth prospects, as well as the USD weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong><a name=\"_Hlk506494646\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk506494612\">GEOPOLITICAL </a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korean President Moon could visit North Korea if the N.Korean stance changes, according to reports.

The risk tone was once again firm on Friday, until headlines hit stating that Special Counsel Mueller had indicted 13 Russians and three entities with regards to interference in the 2016 Presidential Election. At the time, stock indices were losing steam, with ES March&rsquo;18 contract struggling to negotiate the 2750 handle, and the news brought out the sellers. The indictments contained no allegations that an American citizen was knowingly involved in US election meddling, and after stocks skidded lower into negative territory, buyers emerged around the key 2725 level, and stocks once again found themselves in positive territory, though the social media names weighed on the Nasdaq, which finished red.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREASURIES:&nbsp; US T-Note futures (March 2018) settle 4 ticks higher at 120-18+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury complex was immune to headlines that Special Counsel Mueller had indicted 13 Russians and three entities for meddling in the 2016 US Presidential Election. The curve was slightly higher pre-market, though buyers emerged for a second day, with no specific news catalyst. Some had rationalised the moves by suggesting that US Treasuries were oversold in many places, from a technical perspective. Either way, the net impact was narrowing in major curve spreads (2s10s -c4bps, 2s30s -c3bps, hough 5s30s was up slightly)</p>\r\n",
