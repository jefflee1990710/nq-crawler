Moreover, a Washington correspondent reported that a potential outcome for tomorrow would be both sides agreeing to continue talks and possibly the US even announcing to hold off on Jan 1 tariff increases to help discussions continue. The positive tone has contributed to some pockets of risk-on. Saturday&rsquo;s meeting between US President Trump and China President Xi at the G20 Leader&rsquo;s Summit in Buenos Aires (30/Nov-1/Dec) will set the tone for the next leg of the trade conflict between the two nations. In early comments on Friday, US President Trump stated there are some good signs on China trade adding &ldquo;if we could make a deal it would be good&rdquo; while US Trade Representative Lightizer said he would be surprised if Saturday&#39;s dinner between Trump and Chinese President Xi fails, adding that there will be good discussion on &quot;very serious issues&quot;, and appeared confident there will be a &quot;positive feel&quot; for both parties. In terms of the news flow, the WSJ reported that the two nations are working towards a new trade framework, where China would first make concessions in the agriculture and energy sectors, in return for the US suspending tariffs, which will be hiked from 10% to 25% in January on around USD 185bln (after exemptions) of US imports of Chinese goods in January. Other news reports suggest that China economic advisor Liu He could visit Washington for talks. However, on the other side of the coin, US trade advisor and China hawk Peter Navarro, who was reportedly not going to be part of discussions at the G20 between Trump/Xi, will now be part of the mix, which analysts suggest could be a negative. If Trump and Xi cannot come to a d&eacute;tente, the path may be laid for Trump to once again threaten to impose tariffs on remaining Chinese imports into the US (approximately USD 260bln), which may see a further ramping up of tensions, weighing on global growth expectations further. However, analysts at Citi remain optimistic: &ldquo;The bar seems low for a positive surprise. As a reminder, we expect a joint US-China statement and perhaps plans to continue negotiating but without providing a credible signal that trade tensions have peaked,&rdquo; the bank says, adding &ldquo;we don&#39;t think anything material comes out with any level of detail. The market probably takes this scenario positively on Monday open, but optimism might fade if no further details are forthcoming into the rest of the week.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump, Canada&#39;s PM Trudeau and Mexico&#39;s Pena Nieto have signed the USMCA trade agreement; Trump noted the deal will help to stop auto jobs from going overseas and bring back auto jobs that already left, while Canada Foreign Minister Freeland said that the US and Canada are to provide transparency on dairy, pointing out that the steel tariff issue is different from the trade deal (note the dairy issue was said to be a sticking point in the trade pact); she also opposed the legality of 232 tariffs. Similarly, Canadian PM Trudeau warned that steel and aluminium tariffs are an obstacle to prosperity, adding there is a lot of more work to do to lower trade tariffs. The 10-year yield managed to keep its head above 3.00% at settle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; ITALY: </strong>EU Commission President Juncker announced that progress in talks with Italy on budget are being made while reports suggested that Italian PM Conte and Economy Minister Tria are studying cutting the 2019 deficit/GDP target to around 2% in order to reach a deal with the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Williams (Voter, Neutral) did not comment on current rate policy; he sees the neutral rate low for the foreseeable future, and added that if the Fed sticks to its 2% inflation target, expectations could slip. Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Dove, Non-voter) thinks the Fed should pause on rate hikes as now close to neutral rates but believes there is a lot of uncertainty where neutral is. &nbsp;On the economy, he highlighted that labour market keeps surprising and slack remains while the extent of labour force expansion is still unknown; inflation expectations are very anchored. He sees China as a big uncertainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHICAGO PMI </strong>leaped to 66.4 in November from 58.4, beating significantly the 58.5 consensus and rising to a 11-month high. The headline is well known for its sensitivity to Boeing&rsquo;s aircraft orders though this year it has been more responsive to the US-China trade dispute, Pantheon notes. Moreover, the figure is often highly correlated to the ISM PMI Index but does not always guarantee a rebound in the ISM reading which touched a 6-month low last month. Analysts at Pantheon note that &ldquo;manufacturing remains under pressure from the tariffs, but the sector is not rolling over&rdquo; and they argue that the narrative would change &ldquo;if the current 10% tariff rate jumps to 25% in January&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADIAN GDP </strong>on a quarterly basis posted at 0.5% below the 0.7% consensus while the yy headline came in at 2.0%, as expected. Scotiabank notes that the components were somehow mixed since investment disappointed relative to the BoC&rsquo;s Business Outlook Survey intentions; consumption added 0.7 point to the headline in Q3 while inventories subtracted 1.3 pct points and imports added 2.8 pct points, an interesting figure which could be &ldquo;flagging a substitution effect from accelerating domestic oil production that has crowded out oil imports&rdquo;. Nonetheless, the broad growth should keep the BoC on track on its current path also as uncertainty diminishes following the latest validation of the USMCA agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.79% at 2759, NDX +0.82% at 6949, DJI +0.75% at 25530. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -0.24%, Materials +0.39%, Industrials +1.01%, Cons Discretionary +0.63%, Cons Staples +0.83%, Healthcare +1.01%, Financials +0.59%, Tech +1.05%, Telecoms +0.42%, Utilities +1.52%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Airlines (DAL, AAL, LUV, UAL) opened higher due to a fall in crude prices, on the flipside oil producers lagged (EOG, HAL, SLB). AT&amp;T (T) rose on it announcing increased cash flow in 2019 and a reduced debt ratio. Under Armour (UA, UAA) benefitted from an upgrade at Wells Fargo. Chipmakers NVIDIA (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) drifted higher through the day. Laboratory Corporation of America (LH) was an underperformer after announcing a soft business outlook. Marriott International (MAR) tanked after news broke of a major guest data breach. General Electric (GE) opened lower following reports it had not made adequate reserves for insurance losses. Goldman Sachs (GS) traded lower on the back of the Federal Reserve ramping up its investigation into the bank&rsquo;s involvement with the Malaysian 1MDB fund. Symantec (SYMC) drifted lower after its COO resigned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 0.52 LOWER AT USD 50.93/BBL, BRENT (F8) SETTLES USD 0.80 LOWER AT USD 58.71. </strong>The attention is on the G20 ahead of next week&rsquo;s OPEC meeting; the positive noises US President Trump has been making about doing a deal with China has supported crude, as traders&rsquo; reason that positive relations between the world&rsquo;s two largest economies is likely to be positive for global trade, and therefore growth, and therefore oil demand. Looking to next week&rsquo;s OPEC meeting, Russia&rsquo;s energy minister said OPEC and non-OPEC producers were happy comfortable with oil at current prices (echoing comments from Putin earlier in the week, who said he was happy with oil at $60/bbl), with the Russian oil minister also stating that Russian oil companies agree to change output levels in 2019, if needed. The consensus expects OPEC to announce some sort of cut to current output levels, with the Street looking for at least 1mln BPD to be cut (though earlier reports have suggested that a figure of 1.4mln was discussed, with some reports on Friday suggesting that OPEC&rsquo;s economic panel had floated 1.3mln BPD cut to balance the oil market). The key question is who will trim inventories, with nations unwilling to be the one that bears the burden of most of the cuts (read: Saudi Arabia, and Russia); Novak commented that Russian production in 2019 is seen at the same levels as 2018, for now. OPEC&rsquo;s November oil output was down by 160k BPD to 33.1mln BPD after US sanctions on Iran, according to reports; members raised compliance in November to 120% of pledged cuts vs. revised to 110 % in October; record Saudi oil supply, higher UAE output make up for much of Iranian decline. Elsewhere, Baker Hughes this week reported total rigs were down by 3 at 1076; oil rigs up 2 at 887, while gas rigs were down 5 rigs at 189.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 4 TICKS HIGHER AT 119-17+. </strong>The Treasury complex seems to have been detached from the broader themes (G20/trade/etc), once again putting in a lacklustre performance with a thin range, as traders refrain from making any major moves ahead of the outcome of the dinner between Trump/Xi, as well as on month-end. Fed&rsquo;s Kashkari (dove, non-voter) also lent some support to the complex, though in reality, it was a rattling-off of his usual dovish views. Major curve spreads narrowed modestly by between 0.5bps to 2bps, though 10s30s were a touch wider. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Dollar is ending a relatively topsy-turvy week pretty mixed vs currency counterparts, and perhaps remarkably the DXY is not that far from where it started within a 97.543-96.622 range just under 97.000.&nbsp; The major catalysts and drivers have been Fed and flow-related, but the Greenback has also been taking cues or rather influenced by moves elsewhere. In terms of independent impulses, the Buck has benefited from tax repatriation demand and earlier in the week a moderate month end rebalancing bid that only switched around to a similar sell signal on Friday, along with the latest SOMA settlement that represented a net $12.6 bn Usd shortfall to be covered. However, on the flipside, FOMC chair Powell and minutes from the November policy meeting effectively tweaked forward guidance ahead of the next meeting and widely anticipated 4th rate hike of 2018, with references to Fed Funds now being near neutral vs &lsquo;a long way off&rsquo; in the case of the Fed chair previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>On the back foot vs the Usd, and as usual the main loser over SOMA, with the single currency still finding 1.1400 a tough level to breach amidst a barrage of offers, the ongoing Italian-EU budget impasse (albeit discussions reportedly making progress towards a compromise), more soft Eurozone data and expectations that the ECB could downgrade is risk assessment next month in acknowledgement of the fact. Eur/Usd has now slipped under 1.1350 where hefty option expiries were sitting but remains well off worst levels traded this week near 1.1265, with support coming indirectly via Eur/Gbp amidst the usual end of month RHS interest (cross hovering around 0.8900 vs a 0.8925 peak and circa 0.8850 trough).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Aside from the aforementioned and customary selling vs the single currency, the Pound was buffeted by Brexit headlines and growing Parliamentary opposition to UK PM May draft withdrawal plan despite her best efforts to persuade doubters to back it, plus more Cabinet members signalling their support. Cable is currently just below 1.2750 and heading for another test of recent lows around 1.2725 from 1.2850+ at best, with a pretty bleak assessment of the economy in a no deal scenario from the Government looking almost upbeat compared to BoE analysis in that eventuality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK, CHF: </strong>Major underperformers due to data and totally unexpected 0.2% q/q GDP contractions (unlike the -0.1% from Italy vs stagnant flash estimate that hardly surprised given all its well documented issues), with the Swedish Krona retreating sharply vs the Eur towards 10.3500 and Swiss Franc back down near parity vs the Usd/sub-1.1300 against the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, AUD, NZD: </strong>Contrasting fortunes for the non-US Dollars, with the Loonie not deriving much encouragement from the historic or symbolic signing of the USMCA (nor the Mxn for that matter) even though Canada is said to have secured dairy concessions. Sliding crude prices, mixed data and diplomatic issues as it implemented sanctions against Saudi Arabia, all weighed on sentiment and pushed Usd/Cad up through 1.3300, close to the wtd high of 1.3360 vs sub-1.3200 at the other extreme. Conversely, the Aud looks on course to register net gains vs its US peer, albeit modest as a proxy for China and latest PMI surveys showing a worrying slowdown in the official manufacturing headline to bang on 50.0 just ahead of the eagerly awaited Trump-Xi dinner on Saturday evening. On that note, expectations have been lifted by Whitehouse commentary suggesting a &lsquo;successful&rsquo; meeting and the US President himself declaring he is close to a trade agreement with Beijing, but unsure if he wants to accept it. However, prospects for something positive appear better than they were. Staying down under, the Kiwi has benefited from bullish cross-winds as Aud/Nzd retreated through 1.0650, confirmation of more relaxed mortgage rules announced in the RBNZ&rsquo;s FSR, and the broader Usd retracement from highs. Nzd/Usd got to within a whisker of its 200 DMA circa 0.6850 vs 0.6750 at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>As usual, the safe-haven has been largely tracking overall swings in risk sentiment and inversely vs the Usd, but is weaker on balance within relatively restrained 112.85-114.00 parameters after slipping down through several chart supports, but gleaning some comfort from a downturn in US Treasury yields (10s hovering around 3% and briefly under).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>A volatile week for many regional currencies for a variety or myriad of reasons/factors, including oil&rsquo;s extended sell-off, geopolitics, macro releases, Central Bank impulses and the Usd&rsquo;s changing fortunes. However, the Try was a standout mover and outperformer as it continued to rally through the technical 5.2000 mark and almost breached a key technical level (Fib around 5.1550) before losing momentum in wake of 2 failed attempts to close above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Monday: Nikkei Mfg PMI, Japanese Mfg PMI, Chinese Caixin Mfg PMI, Eurozone Markit Mfg PMI (Final), US ISM &amp; Markit Mfg PMIs, US Construction Spending, US Vehicle Sales Tuesday: RBA Rate Decision, Brexit vote debate begins in Commons, ECJ to publish Article 50 opinion, UK Construction PMI Wednesday: BoC Interest Rate Decision, Fed&#39;s Beige Book, Australian GDP, Chinese Caixin Services PMI, Eurozone &amp; US Markit &amp; Services PMIs, US ISM Non-Mfg PMIs Thursday: OPEC Meeting, Australian Retail Sales, US &amp; Canadian Trade Balance, US Factory Orders Friday: Eurozone GDP &amp; Employment Change, US &amp; Canadian Labour Market Report. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20674/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk reports.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CENTRAL BANK WEEKLY: FED: </strong>Data-dependence and no pre-set course gives Fed flexibility in 2019&nbsp; BOC: Inflation beat/GDP miss unlikely to sway BOC, which will likely stand pat on rates RBA: Expected to stand pat and reiterate guidance &nbsp;ECB: Policymakers said to be leaning towards only nuanced tweaks in reinvestment policy BOE: Old Lady&rsquo;s Brexit scenario warnings dismissed as political acrobatics BANXICO: Minutes/QIR confirm Banxico&rsquo;s hawkish approach RBI: India central bank to stand pat despite &lsquo;calibrated tightening&rsquo; bias BOJ: Analysts see NIRP hike in Q3 2020, but it might come sooner, some say RIKSBANK: Weak Q3 GDP might not derail December hike SNB: Weak GDP has only limited implications for SNB BOK: South Korea central bank hikes for first time in a year. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20676/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk reports.</a></p>\r\n",

Looking to next week&rsquo;s OPEC meeting, Russia&rsquo;s energy minister said OPEC and non-OPEC producers were happy comfortable with oil at current prices (echoing comments from Putin earlier in the week, who said he was happy with oil at $60/bbl), with the Russian oil minister also stating that Russian oil companies agree to change output levels in 2019, if needed. The consensus expects OPEC to announce some sort of cut to current output levels, with the Street looking for at least 1mln BPD to be cut (though earlier reports have suggested that a figure of 1.4mln was discussed, with some reports on Friday suggesting that OPEC&rsquo;s economic panel had floated 1.3mln BPD cut to balance the oil market). The key question is who will trim inventories, with nations unwilling to be the one that bears the burden of most of the cuts (read: Saudi Arabia, and Russia); Novak commented that Russian production in 2019 is seen at the same levels as 2018, for now. OPEC&rsquo;s November oil output was down by 160k BPD to 33.1mln BPD after US sanctions on Iran, according to reports; members raised compliance in November to 120% of pledged cuts vs. revised to 110 % in October; record Saudi oil supply, higher UAE output make up for much of Iranian decline. Elsewhere, Baker Hughes this week reported total rigs were down by 3 at 1076; oil rigs up 2 at 887, while gas rigs were down 5 rigs at 189.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Usd/pairs gyrate ahead of G20 and into month end",
        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar is ending a relatively topsy-turvy week pretty mixed vs currency counterparts, and perhaps remarkably the DXY is not that far from where it started within a 97.543-96.622 range just under 97.000. &nbsp;The major catalysts and drivers have been Fed and flow-related, but the Greenback has also been taking cues or rather influenced by moves elsewhere. In terms of independent impulses, the Buck has benefited from tax repatriation demand and earlier in the week a moderate month end rebalancing bid that only switched around to a similar sell signal on Friday, along with the latest SOMA settlement that represented a net $12.6 bn Usd shortfall to be covered. However, on the flipside, FOMC chair Powell and minutes from the November policy meeting effectively tweaked forward guidance ahead of the next meeting and widely anticipated 4th rate hike of 2018, with references to Fed Funds now being near neutral vs &lsquo;a long way off&rsquo; in the case of the Fed chair previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the back foot vs the Usd, and as usual the main loser over SOMA, with the single currency still finding 1.1400 a tough level to breach amidst a barrage of offers, the ongoing Italian-EU budget impasse (albeit discussions reportedly making progress towards a compromise), more soft Eurozone data and expectations that the ECB could downgrade is risk assessment next month in acknowledgement of the fact. Eur/Usd has now slipped under 1.1350 where hefty option expiries were sitting, but remains well off worst levels traded this week near 1.1265, with support coming indirectly via Eur/Gbp amidst the usual end of month RHS interest (cross hovering around 0.8900 vs a 0.8925 peak and circa 0.8850 trough).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the aforementioned and customary selling vs the single currency, the Pound was buffeted by Brexit headlines and growing Parliamentary opposition to UK PM May draft withdrawal plan despite her best efforts to persuade doubters to back it, plus more Cabinet members signalling their support. Cable is currently just below 1.2750 and heading for another test of recent lows around 1.2725 from 1.2850+ at best, with a pretty bleak assessment of the economy in a no deal scenario from the Government looking almost upbeat compared to BoE analysis in that eventuality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/CHF &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major underperformers due to data and totally unexpected 0.2% q/q GDP contractions (unlike the -0.1% from Italy vs stagnant flash estimate that hardly surprised given all its well documented issues), with the Swedish Krona retreating sharply vs the Eur towards 10.3500 and Swiss Franc back down near parity vs the Usd/sub-1.1300 against the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/NZD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes for the non-US Dollars, with the Loonie not deriving much encouragement from the historic or symbolic signing of the USMCA (nor the Mxn for that matter) even though Canada is said to have secured dairy concessions. Sliding crude prices, mixed data and diplomatic issues as it implemented sanctions against Saudi Arabia, all weighed on sentiment and pushed Usd/Cad up through 1.3300, close to the wtd high of 1.3360 vs sub-1.3200 at the other extreme. Conversely, the Aud looks on course to register net gains vs its US peer, albeit modest as a proxy for China and latest PMI surveys showing a worrying slowdown in the official manufacturing headline to bang on 50.0 just ahead of the eagerly awaited Trump-Xi dinner on Saturday evening. On that note, expectations have been lifted by Whitehouse commentary suggesting a &lsquo;successful&rsquo; meeting and the US President himself declaring he is close to a trade agreement with Beijing, but unsure if he wants to accept it. However, prospects for something positive appear better than they were. Staying down under, the Kiwi has benefited from bullish cross-winds as Aud/Nzd retreated through 1.0650, confirmation of more relaxed mortgage rules announced in the RBNZ&rsquo;s FSR, and the broader Usd retracement from highs. Nzd/Usd got to within a whisker of its 200 DMA circa 0.6850 vs 0.6750 at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, the safe-haven has been largely tracking overall swings in risk sentiment and inversely vs the Usd, but is weaker on balance within relatively restrained 112.85-114.00 parameters after slipping down through several chart supports, but gleaning some comfort from a downturn in US Treasury yields (10s hovering around 3% and briefly under).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A volatile week for many regional currencies for a variety or myriad of reasons/factors, including oil&rsquo;s extended sell-off, geopolitics, macro releases, Central Bank impulses and the Usd&rsquo;s changing fortunes. However, the Try was a standout mover and outperformer as it continued to rally through the technical 5.2000 mark and almost breached a key technical level (Fib around 5.1550) before losing momentum in wake of 2 failed attempts to close above.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) initially followed suit to the lacklustre lead from their counterparts stateside with Australia the underperformer on broad weakness in which nearly all sectors declined, while Japanese exporters were hampered by recent flows into the JPY before staging a late recovery. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) were initially indecisive due to trade uncertainty amid a &lsquo;hot and cold&rsquo; stance by US President Trump who stated he is close to doing something on trade with China but is unsure if he wants to, while reports noted that White House Trade Adviser and &lsquo;China hawk&rsquo; Navarro is back on the guest list for the Trump-Xi dinner tomorrow evening. Furthermore, the latest Chinese PMI data left much to be desired as both Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs missed expectations with the former at its lowest since June 2016. The indices closed higher on the day, however. Finally, 10yr JGB traded lacklustre after having failed to benefit from the risk averse tone in Japan and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the bond market, as prices marginally pulled back from recent gains which had seen long-term yields hit their lowest levels since the beginning of August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are lower across the board (Eurostoxx 50 -0.3%) after the region gave up opening gains amid trade jitters heading the US-Sino showdown at the G20 Summit. UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 (-0.7%) underperforms peers as heavyweight miners are pressured by the price action in the base metals complex, while Germany&rsquo;s DAX (-0.6%) feels the burden of falling auto names after Daimler (-2.7%) was downgraded to sell at HSBC, in turn moving the likes of Volkswagen (-1.1%) and BMW (-1.8%) lower in sympathy. Sector wise, consumer discretionary (weighed by auto names) lags, closely followed by financials as Morgan Stanley downgraded the EU banking sector, while Deutsche bank (-3.0%) shares hit an all time low as the bank feels the brunt of a double whammy from the aforementioned downgrade alongside a second day of raids amid the money laundering probe. In terms of stock specifics, Altice (+8.0%) rose to the top of the Stoxx 600 (-0.5%) after the company sold its 49.9% stake in SFR GTTH for EUR 1.8bln, while Faurecia (-7.1%) is the worst performer in Europe amid a downgrade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The Greenback remains off pre-Powell highs in wake of the latest FOMC minutes that effectively affirm a shift in the approach towards forward guidance that may start in December after a final rate hike this year, with less pre-set indications and more flexibility to take on board incoming data. However, the Buck is ahead vs all G10 counterparts bar the Kiwi that is benefiting from favourable cross-winds, with the index edging just over 97.000 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has been more volatile than most ahead of the looming G20 Summit and month end, with more spikes vs the Pound through 0.8900 around fixes due to ongoing/residual RHS interest, but another failure at 1.1400 vs the Usd on round number offers and option expiry flows as circa 1.6 bn roll off between the big figure and 1.1410 at the NY cut. Moreover, some Usd12.6 bn SOMA-related Dollar demand coincides with the final trading day of November, and this usually weighs most heavily on Eur/Usd vs potential bids at 1.1350 where another 1.6bn expiries reside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD - Also underperforming vs the Greenback, with the Aud bearing the brunt of a weaker than forecast Chinese manufacturing PMI overnight ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting on Saturday, and struggling top keep hold of 0.7300 as the Aud/Nzd cross pivots 1.0650 and the Kiwi remains within striking distance of its 200 DMA (0.6870). Meanwhile, the Loonie is back below 1.3300 as crude prices resume their slide amidst reports from Russia suggesting that OPEC+ are content with current levels, which have also piled more pressure on the Rub for obvious reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Sterling is feeling the weight of the aforementioned Eur cross demand for month end, and also vs the Usd as Cable continues to hit resistance at 1.2800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - The Swedish crown has extended losses made on the back of Thursday&rsquo;s shock contraction in Swedish Q3 GDP, with Eur/Sek up towards 10.3500 at one stage and only marginally easing back on relatively hawkish/supportive Riksbank rhetoric (Floden seeing further upside in prices, a 5-10% rise in the currency from &lsquo;undervalued&rsquo; levels and contending that the economy could withstand a December hike, but that is still up in the air pending more data before the policy meeting, ie CPI)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bund and BTP correlations have returned to the forefront as the Italian-German spread once again widens beyond 300bps as Bunds recently hit a fresh Eurex peak at 161.49 and BTP&rsquo;s slipped to a Eurex base of 124.26. This came after initial positivity from Rome on the budget only provided a fleeting lift as month end positioning and technical factors came into play. On the fundamental side more poor data in the form of contracting QQ GDP and rising unemployment pushed the Italian 10 year to session lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts remain marginally on the back foot but staged a slight comeback to break previous highs of 122.66 hitting a liffe high of 122.69 (+1 tick) before reverting to trade around the 122.60 area after suggestions that UK MP Mordant may resign over the Brexit deal. Traders will now be looking out for updates from the G20 summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US fixed income market is seeing some further bull flattening as US 10 year yields continue to trade around the 3% area. This comes as investors await trade updates from the G20 summit and comments from Fed&rsquo;s Williams after the Fed&rsquo;s minutes noted multiple members believe base interest rates may be &ldquo;near its neutral level&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-1.4%) and Brent (-1.0%) lost the USD 51/bbl and USD 60/bbl handles respectively with sentiment deteriorating as the G20 Summit goes underway, where participants will be looking out for leaks in regard to any potential supply change discussed by key policy makers. Meanwhile, ahead of the Dec 6th OPEC meeting, Russian Energy Ministry stated that OPEC and non-OPEC producers are comfortable with the current oil price, while the country&rsquo;s Energy Minister Novak said Russia plans to maintain the average oil output level until year-end. Note: yesterday he said Russia proposes an output cut for next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals complex, gold (-0.2%) erodes post-Powell gains and remains in the November range of USD 1200-1240/oz as the yellow metal mirrors the rising USD, with traders noting a clean break above the top of the range could result in further bullish action. Copper (-0.3%) trade lower amid the cautious risk tone ahead of the Trump-Xi G20 showdown, with moves to the downside exacerbated by the disappointing Chinese manufacturing PMIs overnight. Elsewhere, Shanghai aluminium prices declined to their lowest level in over two years to print their third consecutive monthly decline amid oversupply fused with downbeat Chinese PMIs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran and other oil producers are to press Saudi Arabia to bear the brunt of production cuts at the upcoming OPEC meeting; according to WSJ. (WSJ) Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih previously said that Saudi will not and cannot reduce output on its own</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Energy Ministry says OPEC and non-OPEC producers are comfortable with the current oil prices; according to TASS (TASS)</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, the Loonie is back below 1.3300 as crude prices resume their slide amidst reports from Russia suggesting that OPEC+ are content with current levels, which have also piled more pressure on the Rub for obvious reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Sterling is feeling the weight of the aforementioned Eur cross demand for month end, and also vs the Usd as Cable continues to hit resistance at 1.2800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - The Swedish crown has extended losses made on the back of Thursday&rsquo;s shock contraction in Swedish Q3 GDP, with Eur/Sek up towards 10.3500 at one stage and only marginally easing back on relatively hawkish/supportive Riksbank rhetoric (Floden seeing further upside in prices, a 5-10% rise in the currency from &lsquo;undervalued&rsquo; levels and contending that the economy could withstand a December hike, but that is still up in the air pending more data before the policy meeting, ie CPI)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bund and BTP correlations have returned to the forefront as the Italian-German spread once again widens beyond 300bps as Bunds recently hit a fresh Eurex peak at 161.49 and BTP&rsquo;s slipped to a Eurex base of 124.26. This came after initial positivity from Rome on the budget only provided a fleeting lift as month end positioning and technical factors came into play. On the fundamental side more poor data in the form of contracting QQ GDP and rising unemployment pushed the Italian 10 year to session lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts remain marginally on the back foot but staged a slight comeback to break previous highs of 122.66 hitting a liffe high of 122.69 (+1 tick) before reverting to trade around the 122.60 area after suggestions that UK MP Mordant may resign over the Brexit deal. Traders will now be looking out for updates from the G20 summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US fixed income market is seeing some further bull flattening as US 10 year yields continue to trade around the 3% area. This comes as investors await trade updates from the G20 summit and comments from Fed&rsquo;s Williams after the Fed&rsquo;s minutes noted multiple members believe base interest rates may be &ldquo;near its neutral level&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.9%) and Brent (-0.5%) lost the USD 51/bbl and USD 60/bbl handles respectively with sentiment deteriorating as the G20 Summit goes underway, where participants will be looking out for leaks in regard to any potential supply change discussed by key policy makers. Meanwhile, ahead of the Dec 6th OPEC meeting, Russian Energy Ministry stated that OPEC and non-OPEC producers are comfortable with the current oil price, while the country&rsquo;s Energy Minister Novak said Russia plans to maintain the average oil output level until year-end. Note: yesterday he said Russia proposes an output cut for next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals complex, gold (-0.3%) erodes post-Powell gains and remains in the November range of USD 1200-1240/oz as the yellow metal mirrors the rising USD, with traders noting a clean break above the top of the range could result in further bullish action. Copper (-0.5%) underperforms amid the cautious risk tone ahead of the Trump-Xi G20 showdown, with moves to the downside exacerbated by the disappointing Chinese manufacturing PMIs overnight. Elsewhere, Shanghai aluminium prices declined to their lowest level in over two years to print their third consecutive monthly decline amid oversupply fused with downbeat Chinese PMIs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) initially followed suit to the lacklustre lead from their counterparts stateside with Australia the underperformer on broad weakness in which nearly all sectors declined, while Japanese exporters were hampered by recent flows into the JPY before staging a late recovery. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) were indecisive due to trade uncertainty amid a &lsquo;hot and cold&rsquo; stance by US President Trump who stated he is close to doing something on trade with China but is unsure if he wants to, while reports noted that White House Trade Adviser and &lsquo;China hawk&rsquo; Navarro is back on the guest list for the Trump-Xi dinner tomorrow evening. Furthermore, the latest Chinese PMI data left much to be desired as both Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs missed expectations with the former at its lowest since June 2016. Finally, 10yr JGB traded lacklustre after having failed to benefit from the risk averse tone in Japan and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the bond market, as prices marginally pulled back from recent gains which had seen long-term yields hit their lowest levels since the beginning of August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations.

BoK Governor Lee said the rate decision was not unanimous as 2 board members voted to maintain rates, while Lee also commented that the policy rate is still not at neutral and that he is not worried much about capital outflows due to further Fed rate hikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May said Britain will be a more divided country if Parliament votes against her Brexit deal, while she also urged MPs to think about delivering on Brexit vote and answered that she is focused on December 11th vote when asked if she has a plan B if her deal is not approved by Parliament. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is turning to Eurosceptics in her cabinet to launch a last gasp effort to sell her compromise Brexit deal, according to the FT.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY traded rangebound following an uneventful FOMC minutes. The reaction was muted as analysts viewed the minutes to be consistent with an upcoming hike in December, but suggested a potential flexible approach moving forward. Elsewhere, most major pairs consolidated with EUR/USD eyeing the 1.1400 handle to the upside and with GBP/USD little changed below 1.2800, while antipodeans are flat with AUD/USD only momentarily pressured by the Chinese data miss and with AUD/NZD having fully recovered from early turbulence in which the cross dropped over 30 pips in less than a minute as NZD/USD tested the 200DMA at 0.6870.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly uneventful with WTI crude futures taking breather from the prior day&rsquo;s volatility in which prices briefly broke below the USD 50/bbl level to print its lowest level in more than a year, before aggressively rebounding on reports Russia may be prepared to trim oil output in cooperation with OPEC. Elsewhere, gold and copper traded sideways amid similar price action in the greenback and an indecisive risk tone, while palladium outperformed the metals complex in an extension of its multi-month uptrend to hit a fresh record high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC delegates said oil at USD 60 is hurting US shale and strengthening OPEC&#39;s hand to introduce higher quotas, while delegates added production cut is increasingly necessary although volumes are undecided.

The release of the FOMC minutes did little to the complex with yields back around levels seen pre-Powell dovish comments on Wednesday. Most MPC members agreed that rate hikes are likely warranted &ldquo;fairly soon&rdquo; subject to inflation and US jobs. Most of the action was in the belly of the curve where yields were lower by c.1bps at settlement; mixed data also contributed to depressed yields.&nbsp; 2s10s narrowed by c.3bps while 2s30s and 2s5s were narrower by c.2bps.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are mixed amid a cautious global risk tone ahead of the US-China showdown at the G20 and as participants digest disappointing Chinese PMI data. ASX 200 (-1.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are lower following the lacklustre lead from their counterparts stateside with Australia underperforming as nearly all sectors trade with losses, while Japanese exporters are hampered by flows into the JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) are indecisive due to trade uncertainty amid a &lsquo;hot and cold&rsquo; stance by President Trump who stated he is close to doing something on trade with China but is unsure if he wants to, while reports noted that White House Trade Adviser and &lsquo;China hawk&rsquo; Navarro is back on the guest list for the Trump-Xi dinner tomorrow evening. Furthermore, the latest Chinese PMI data left much to be desired as both Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs missed expectations with the former at its lowest since June 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY traded rangebound following an uneventful FOMC minutes which stated all policy makers said rate hikes likely warranted &quot;fairly soon&quot; if the US job and inflation data were in line with or stronger than the Fed&#39;s current expectations and that policy was not on a pre-set course. The reaction was muted as analysts viewed the minutes to be consistent with an upcoming hike in December, but suggested a potential flexible approach moving forward. Elsewhere, most major pairs consolidated with EUR/USD eyeing the 1.1400 handle to the upside and with GBP/USD little changed below 1.2800, while antipodeans are also flat with AUD/USD only momentarily pressured by the Chinese data miss and with AUD/NZD having fully recovered from early turbulence in which the cross dropped over 30 pips in less than a minute as NZD/USD tested the 200DMA at 0.6870.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGB are lacklustre after having failed to benefit from the risk averse tone in Japan and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the bond market, with prices marginally pullback from recent gains which had seen long-term yields hit their lowest levels since beginning of August.</p>\r\n",
