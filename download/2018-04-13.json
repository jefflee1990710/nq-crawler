        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 13 April 2018: Investors take risk off the table ahead of potential geopolitics over the weekend",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: </strong>Stocks down, USD flat, treasuries flat, oil up<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW: </strong>Waiting US decision on Syria, NAFTA updates, Weak Uni of Michigan report, Fed&rsquo;s speak<br /><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>BoC Rate Decision, RBA Minutes, Canada CPI, UK CPI</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Whilst markets await for an upcoming strike, the US Ambassador for the UN Haley reported Trump has not yet made a decision over the plan of action on Syria whilst the US Pentagon warned that US military assets have entered the Mediterranean area, positioning the USS Winston Churchill into the sea. Amid expectations of an imminent attack, the UN Chief Guterres warned deadlock Security Council could lead to full-blow military escalation. In late trade, the US State Department expressed confidence that Syria&rsquo;s government is responsible for the chemical weapons attack. Elsewhere, the Russian Deputy PM stated counter measures on the US will come once the full impact of US sanctions on Russia are analysed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS</strong>: On the NAFTA front, Mexico Trade Representative Kalach noted the deal contingency is dependent upon the political will from the Trump&rsquo;s administration, pointing out that 5/6 demands from the US are bad for Mexico. US Commerce Secretary Ross appeared optimistic on reaching a deal, in principle, on NAFTA, possibly in the third week of May; if no accord is reached by the Mexican election, deal unlikely to be reached until the end of the year. Separately, China said to stall key M&amp;A deals amid trade negotiations with the US, citing Qualcomm and Toshiba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED SPEAK:</strong> Fed&#39;s Rosengren (non-voter, hawk) suggested that somewhat more tightening than the FOMC forecasts might be needed. As a reminder, he has previously hinted he is in the four-hike camp whilst the current FOMC median projections (March) remain for three hikes in 2018. Emphasis fell on its own economic forecast which called for an even more pronounced decline in the unemployment rate, given his expectation that cyclical strength in labour force participation will provide only a partial offset to solid gains in payrolls. Finally, he warned the Fed must consider risks to the outlook. Fed&rsquo;s Bullard (non-voter, dove) noted the lower than expected Q1 GDP growth will not have an impact on the medium-term outlook, adding there is currently too much of uncertainty around trade tariffs to assess its impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA:</strong> University of Michigan confidence data missed expectations in April, and the inflation expectations metrics slipped; analysts were quick to attribute the disappointing print on the stock market correction in February. March&rsquo;s spike also led some to expect some paring back. JOLTs data was also a miss, with job openings falling by more than expected in February after January&rsquo;s record high, while the quits rate was unchanged. Analysts said the data continues to indicate that labour market conditions remain tight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.29% at 2656, NDX -0.42% at 6628, DJI -0.50% at 24360&nbsp; SECTORS: CONS CYC (XLY): -0.57%, CONS NON-CYC (XLP): +0.50%, ENERGY (XLE): +1.10%, FINANCIALS (XLF): -1.55%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): -0.08%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): -0.24%, MATERIALS (XLB): -0.10%, TECH (XLK): -0.33%, TELECOMS (XTL): -0.15%, UTLITIES (XLU): +0.69%.&nbsp; </strong><br />Overnight equity futures took out yesterday&rsquo;s highs rising to 2680 just before the cash open, when the gains were reversed and the EMINI faded back down. Further pressured by softer University of Michigan and JOLTS data was seen, with the EMINI returning to the 2650 area, a level that was revisited plenty of times this week.<br />Despite earnings for three major financial names today (JPM, Citi, Wells &ndash; all beating the top and bottom line), the sector closes red on Friday, with the financial sector underperforming. Energy was the outperformer, supporting the SPX for the session on the back of higher oil prices. Apart from the financial earnings, the main story stock specific stories today surrounded chip names, Qualcomm (QCOM) &amp; Broadcom (AVGO), with the latter announcing a $12bln share repurchase programme after market on Thursday, and the former reportedly looking to become private in the next few months according to sources. M&amp;A news was relatively light compared to recent sessions, where the focus was on Mylan (MYL) reportedly in advanced negotiations for German Merck&rsquo;s KGaA (MRK GY) consumer health unit, sources suggest the bidding value is around $3.5bln.<br />Leading the S&amp;P today was Alaska Air (ALK) following its March traffic report, and one of the laggards being PNC Financial (PNC) following earnings which EPS matched analyst expectations, but revenues missed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE:</strong> <strong>WTI (May) settles 32 cents higher at USD 67.39 per barrel and Brent (June) settles 56 cents higher at USD 72.58 per barrel.</strong> Crude put in a solid performance this week, rising to fresh multi-year highs, and taking out strong resistance above $66/bbl. This month&rsquo;s OPEC and EIA reports erred on the bullish side, and on Friday, the IEA own monthly report said non-OPEC supply would grow by 1.8mln BPD (unchanged from prev.) in 2018, global oil demand growth also remains unchanged. IEA also said that OPEC oil production was down 200k BPD in March to 31.83mln BPD on Venezuela and Africa, while compliance with output deal reached 163%. But the most supportive factor for the crude complex was on geopolitical tensions &ndash; with a likely imminent strike on Syria stole the headlines, Yemen upped missile attacks into Saudi, which has some analysts more concerned. This week, Baker Hughes reported oil rigs rose by 7, the second straight week of rising rigs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES:</strong> <strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle half-a-tick higher at 120-15+.</strong> Treasury yields were little changed on Friday with most action in the short end of the curve where 2yr yields rose to fresh (almost) decade highs. The rise in 2yr yields resulted in further flattening of the 2s10s and 2s30s curves (by around 3pbs). Treasuries were generally fulfilling their haven role, inversely moving to the direction of equities &ndash; particularly so after weak US data. Elsewhere, ahead of next week&rsquo;s auction of 5yr TIPS, the US Treasury has asked primary dealers opinion on increasing 5yr TIPS issuance in the second half of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> DXY ended a tough week off worst levels, but still below the 90.000 axis and considerably weaker than it was prior to last Friday&rsquo;s NFP report that missed consensus on the headline payroll count. The China vs US import tariff stand-off, Syria and Russian sanctions have largely dominated risk sentiment and directed moves in the broad Dollar with little on the data front to provide impetus as CPI was more or less in line with consensus. Hawkish FOMC minutes did give the Greenback a relatively modest lift, but a charm offensive between the US President and his Chinese counterpart was arguably equally supportive (for the Greenback and improved investor appetite for risk in general). However, this all paled into comparison vs a Trump tweet alleviating concerns about an imminent strike against Syria, which was only partly offset by Russia unveiling a list of counter-sanctions vs the US. The index around 89.800 vs a circa 89.355 low on Wednesday. AUD/NZD/CAD: the AUD was Friday&rsquo;s stand-out commodity bloc and G10 outperformer, but all 3 have been big net winners on the week on a mixture of the aforementioned improving risk climate, data and CB leads, plus flows and re-positioning. AUDUSD eventually hurdled some major barriers in the high 0.7700s, with stops tripped above 0.7780 to a multi-week high just shy of 0.7810 and the next upside tech levels from 0.7812-15 (former a Fib and latter the 200 DMA). The Kiwi has challenged resistance at the psychological 0.7400 level several times, and got closest when the AUDNZD cross slipped under 1.0500 amidst the height of US-China trade tensions, but has pulled back amidst the AUD short squeeze and paring back of heavily oversold positions. However, the Loonie has starred overall this week, with USDCAD down from almost 1.2820 on Monday to around 1.2550 at one stage on positive NAFTA deal prospects, some firmer than forecast data, an upbeat BoC business survey and sharp rally in oil prices. However, the BoC is not expected to be prompted into (hike) action as soon as next week. The bullish April story continues, but GBP also got a boost from BoE hawk McCafferty who underscored his dissenting vote for a hike with a warning to the MPC not to delay any further, as expectations for a 2nd tightening in May topped 90%. The Pound also received some good news on the Brexit front via reports that EU&rsquo;s Barnier could be will to offer the UK more flexibility on the timing to agree transition terms. Cable almost hit 1.4300 vs the 2018 high so far at 1.4345, while EURGDP finally breached 0.8700 to trade down to 0.8625 or thereabouts. A bearish week for the EUR overall vs major rivals, and largely due to dovish/cautious ECB minutes that more than counterbalance the hawkish lone or at least personal view of Nowotny. EURUSD&nbsp; faded after a few attempts at 1.2400 and needs to close above the 21 DMA at 1.2323 to avoid re-visiting recent lows on the 1.2200 handle. USDJPY rallying through the key 107.50-55 area that has been capping the pair and threatening 107.90 resistance before 108.00. USDCHF and EURCHF also on an upward trajectory, though the Franc remains decoupled from usual/traditional safe-haven and risk correlations amidst capital outflows (Russian repatriation touted) and spec about official intervention. Finally, softer than forecast Norwegian and Swedish inflation data weighed on both Kronas whilst the RUB, TRY and HKD all benefiting from intervention to trade off worst levels.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: calmer global trade and still geopolitical waters",
        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending a tough week off worst levels, but still below the 90.000 axis and considerably weaker than it was prior to last Friday&rsquo;s NFP report that missed consensus on the headline payroll count by some distance. The China vs US import tariff stand-off, Syria and Russian sanctions have largely dominated risk sentiment and directed moves in the broad Dollar with little on the data front to provide impetus as CPI was more or less in line with consensus. Hawkish FOMC minutes did give the Greenback a relatively modest lift, but a charm offensive between the US President and his Chinese counterpart was arguably equally supportive (for the Greenback and improved investor appetite for risk in general). However, this all paled into comparison vs a Trump tweet alleviating concerns about an imminent strike against Syria, which was only partly offset by Russia unveiling a list of counter-sanctions vs the US. The index is currently around 89.800 vs a circa 89.355 low on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aud is Friday&rsquo;s stand-out commodity bloc and G10 outperformer, but all 3 have been big net winners on the week on a mixture of the aforementioned improving risk climate, data and CB leads, plus flows and re-positioning. Aud/Usd eventually hurdled some major barriers in the high 0.7700s, with stops tripped above 0.7780 to a multi-week high just shy of 0.7810 and the next upside tech levels from 0.7812-15 (former a Fib and latter the 200 DMA). The Kiwi has challenged resistance at the psychological 0.7400 level several times, and got closest when the Aud/Nzd cross slipped under 1.0500 amidst the height of US-China trade tensions, but has pulled back amidst the Aud short squeeze and paring back of heavily oversold positions. However, the Loonie has starred overall this week, with Usd/Cad down from almost 1.2820 on Monday to around 1.2550 at one stage on positive NAFTA deal prospects, some firmer than forecast data, an upbeat BoC business survey and sharp rally in oil prices. However, the BoC is not expected to be prompted into (hike) action as soon as next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bullish April story continues, but Sterling also got a boost from BoE hawk McCafferty who underscored his dissenting vote for a hike with a warning to the MPC not to delay any further, as expectations for a 2<sup>nd</sup> tightening in May topped 90%. The Pound also received some good news on the Brexit front via reports that EU&rsquo;s Barnier could be will to offer the UK more flexibility on the timing to agree transition terms. Cable almost hit 1.4300 vs the 2018 high so far at 1.4345, while Eur/Gbp finally breached 0.8700 to trade down to 0.8625 or thereabouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bearish week for the single currency overall vs major rivals, and largely due to dovish/cautious ECB minutes that more than counterbalance the hawkish lone or at least personal view of Nowotny. Eur/Usd faded after a few attempts at 1.2400 and needs to close above the 21 DMA at 1.2323 to avoid re-visiting recent lows on the 1.2200 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed fortunes, but with Usd/Jpy rallying through the key 107.50-55 area that has been capping the pair and threatening 107.90 resistance before 108.00. Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf also on an upward trajectory, though the Franc remains decoupled from usual/traditional safe-haven and risk correlations amidst capital outflows (Russian repatriation touted) and spec about official intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK/NOK </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Softer than forecast Norwegian and Swedish inflation data weighed on both Kronas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rub, Try and HKD all benefiting from intervention to trade off worst levels.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter source report US President Trump put off his final decision regarding strikes on Syria after meeting with security advisers, amid internal conflict with US Secretary of Defense Mattis and National Security Adviser Bolton.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equities trade modestly higher (Stoxx 600 +0.3%). This is largely due to the US (at the time of writing) having taken no decision on what (if any) military action should be taken on Syria with today&#39;s light calendar also failing to provide any major impetus for stocks. As such, moves have largely been noted in individual stock rather than broader based macro ones with equities resilient against new Russian sanctions vs. the US. Individual movers include Sage Group (-13%) after cutting guidance, Hammerson (-12%) are also lower after Klepierre&rsquo;s (+1%) withdrawal of their acquisition offer. Finally, Volkswagen shares up 1.0% after their current CEO is to be replaced by Diess, who will be responsible for group research. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No sign of contagion or concern over a surprise Chinese trade deficit despite the ongoing import tariff spat with the US, as Aud/Usd finally broke through major chart resistance around 0.7785 and triggered stops to probe just above 0.7800 before running out of steam ahead of a fib at 0.7812 and the 200 DMA at 0.7815.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kiwi also firmer vs the Usd and nudging up towards 0.7400 again, but lagging its antipodean peer as the Aud/Nzd cross rebounds from just below 1.0500 to 1.0550+ on Aud short covering from a more oversold base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another G10 outperformer, with Cable almost up to 1.4300 having breached the recent 1.4244-50 range high and now looking at the 1.4345 ytd peak if the nearest big figure is taken out. On that note, further Eur/Gbp selling could give the Pound another boost with market contacts hearing talk of decent demand for downside option strikes and little in the way of technical support before 0.8600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still lagging amongst majors and the main victim of less aversion/tension surrounding trade wars and Syria (for now at least), with Usd/Jpy up through the 107.50-55 zone, which marked the top of late and included a fib level, before tripping some buy orders above 107.60.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choppy trade in the Franc, with Usd/Chf higher early in the EU session and eyeing the 200DMA at 0.9650-60 amidst speculation about Russian outflows, but back down towards 0.9600 as Russia unveils counter-sanctions vs the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just about maintaining positive momentum above 89.500 with more support coming from US President Trump who is now open to re-joining the TPP, if the terms are favourable, and is still holding off from any strike against Syria to assess chemical attack evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has recouped data-related losses and more to retest recent highs vs the Usd close to 1.2550 amidst more constructive NAFTA reports, and could get a helping hand from cross positioning as a big US bank implements a short Chf/Cad trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extended weakness vs Sterling aside, the single currency remains rangebound vs the Usd between 1.2300-1.2350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU bonds have recovered relatively well from the depths seen earlier on Eurex and Liffe when losses for the 10 year benchmarks reached 34 and 36 ticks in Bunds and Gilts respectively. Technicals may have been a catalyst for the turned around as nearest downside supports/targets held, while from a fundamental perspective Russia&rsquo;s retaliatory moves vs US sanctions could have rattled a few nerves that were calmer on the cooling off in US-Chinese trade tensions (for the time being). It&rsquo;s probably too premature, but some pre-weekend position squaring and paring is also feasible, or simply a few intraday traders/specs taking a few chips off the table ahead of the US open. Suffice to say that Bunds have revisited very early session highs (159.31) and Gilts have gone a step further to post a fresh peak (121.93, just 4 ticks below the previous close). US Treasuries mildly firmer and just a few ticks shy of best levels seen overnight, with the curve re-flattening after the 30 year auction drew the best results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the commodities complex, WTI (+0.8%) and Brent (+0.8%) are setting new weekly highs, as ongoing tensions over Syria fuel the rally. This follows initial reports that the US was planning to strike 8 targets in Syria, but traders are mindful that US Press Secretary Sanders said no final decision was made. Furthermore, the UK cabinet backed military action against Syria. Elsewhere, the IEA monthly oil market report highlighted forecasts for 2018 global oil demand growth to remain unchanged from the prior month&rsquo;s report of 1.5mln bpd. Moving onto metals, Gold (+0.1%) is marginally higher as the yellow metal tracks dollar weakness. In terms of base metals, copper (+0.6%) is higher on the day, however, the upside is capped by disappointing Chinese trade data. Aluminium (+13.8% this week) set for its best week since 1987 amid rising concerns of supply disruptions regarding Russian sanctions.</p>\r\n",

As such ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were positive with Australian financials mostly kept afloat following an upbeat Financial Stability Review, while Japan benefitted from the weaker currency-heightened risk dynamic. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp.

        "content": "<p><strong>Equities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equities trade modestly higher (Stoxx 600 +0.3%). This is largely due to the US (at the time of writing) having taken no decision on what (if any) military action should be taken on Syria with today&#39;s light calendar also failing to provide any major impetus for stocks. As such, moves have largely been noted in individual stock rather than broader based macro ones with equities resilient against new Russian sanctions vs. the US. Individual movers include&nbsp;Sage Group (-13%) after cutting guidance, Hammerson (-12%) are also lower after Klepierre&rsquo;s (+1%) withdrawal of their acquisition offer.&nbsp;Finally, Volkswagen shares up 1.0% after their current CEO is to be replaced by Diess, who will be responsible for group research</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No sign of contagion or concern over a surprise Chinese trade deficit despite the ongoing import tariff spat with the US, as Aud/Usd finally broke through major chart resistance around 0.7785 and triggered stops to probe just above 0.7800 before running out of steam ahead of a fib at 0.7812 and the 200 DMA at 0.7815.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kiwi also firmer vs the Usd and nudging up towards 0.7400 again, but lagging its antipodean peer as the Aud/Nzd cross rebounds from just below 1.0500 to 1.0550+ on Aud short covering from a more oversold base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another G10 outperformer, with Cable almost up to 1.4300 having breached the recent 1.4244-50 range high and now looking at the 1.4345 ytd peak if the nearest big figure is taken out. On that note, further Eur/Gbp selling could give the Pound another boost with market contacts hearing talk of decent demand for downside option strikes and little in the way of technical support before 0.8600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still lagging amongst majors and the main victim of less aversion/tension surrounding trade wars and Syria (for now at least), with Usd/Jpy up through the 107.50-55 zone, which marked the top of late and included a fib level, before tripping some buy orders above 107.60.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choppy trade in the Franc, with Usd/Chf higher early in the EU session and eyeing the 200DMA at 0.9650-60 amidst speculation about Russian outflows, but back down towards 0.9600 as Russia unveils counter-sanctions vs the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just about maintaining positive momentum above 89.500 with more support coming from US President Trump who is now open to re-joining the TPP, if the terms are favourable, and is still holding off from any strike against Syria to assess chemical attack evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has recouped data-related losses and more to retest recent highs vs the Usd close to 1.2550 amidst more constructive NAFTA reports, and could get a helping hand from cross positioning as a big US bank implements a short Chf/Cad trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extended weakness vs Sterling aside, the single currency remains rangebound vs the Usd between 1.2300-1.2350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fixed income</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK debt and STIR futures under pressure, as Gilts continue to underperform against the backdrop of high/rising May BoE rate hike expectations, positive Brexit impulses, bearish positioning/technical and less risk-averse global sentiment overall. The core bond gapped down 8 ticks on its return to Liffe and then succumbed to more pronounced downside pressure to hit a 121.63 base, 30 ticks below Thursday close. Sellers/shorts will now be eyeing nearest chart support at 121.44, while the obvious objective for cash traders is 1.50% for the 10 year benchmark yield, which is not far from circa 1.472% at present. Short Sterling contracts down 1-2 ticks, bar Jun18 that is just a tick adrift. Back to fixed, Bunds are also extending losses and testing buying interest around 159.00 (158.95 base just printed, -26 ticks), which could clear the way to challenge last week&rsquo;s 158.89 Eurex low if breached convincingly and expose stops set below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Commodities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the commodities complex, WTI (+0.8%) and Brent (+0.8%) are setting new weekly highs, as ongoing tensions over Syria fuel the rally. This follows initial reports that the US was planning to strike 8 targets in Syria, but traders are mindful that US Press Secretary Sanders said no final decision was made. Furthermore, the UK cabinet backed military action against Syria. Elsewhere, the IEA monthly oil market report highlighted forecasts for 2018 global oil demand growth to remain unchanged from the prior month&rsquo;s report of 1.5mln bpd. Moving onto metals, Gold (+0.1%) is marginally higher as the yellow metal tracks dollar weakness. In terms of base metals, copper (+0.6%) is higher on the day, however, the upside is capped by disappointing Chinese trade data. Aluminium (+13.8% this week) set for its best week since 1987 amid rising concerns of supply disruptions regarding Russian sanctions.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>UK debt and STIR futures under pressure, as Gilts continue to underperform against the backdrop of high/rising May BoE rate hike expectations, positive Brexit impulses, bearish positioning/technical and less risk-averse global sentiment overall. The core bond gapped down 8 ticks on its return to Liffe and then succumbed to more pronounced downside pressure to hit a 121.66 base, 33 ticks below Thursday close. Sellers/shorts will now be eyeing nearest chart support at 121.44, while the obvious objective for cash traders is 1.50% for the 10 year benchmark yield, which is not far from circa 1.472% at present. Short Sterling contracts down 1-2 ticks, bar Jun18 that is just a tick adrift. Back to fixed, Bunds are also extending losses and testing buying interest around 159.00 (158.99 base just printed, -30 ticks), which could clear the way to challenge last week&rsquo;s 158.89 Eurex low if breached convincingly and expose stops set below. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This resulted to firm gains across all US major indices, while the financial sector outperformed as yields rose in the wake of the recent hawkish FOMC minutes. As such ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were positive with Australian financials mostly kept afloat following an upbeat Financial Stability Review, while Japan benefitted from the weaker currency-heightened risk dynamic. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp.

This resulted to firm gains across all US major indices, while the financial sector outperformed as yields rose in the wake of the recent hawkish FOMC minutes. As such <strong>ASX 200 (+0.3%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (+0.6%)</strong> were positive with Australian financials mostly kept afloat following an upbeat Financial Stability Review, while Japan benefitted from the weaker currency-heightened risk dynamic. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (Unch.)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%)</strong> were underpinned at the open but then pared gains as the risk tone deteriorated following disappointing Chinese trade data and a CNY 100bln net weekly drain by the PBoC, while the White House was also reported to be planning to escalate trade pressure on China. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally softer with demand subdued by a positive tone seen in Japanese stocks, although downside was stemmed amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 840bln in maturities across the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 100bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 10bln net drain.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majors were relatively inconclusive overnight in which the DXY somewhat maintained the gradual upward trajectory seen since this week&rsquo;s hawkish FOMC minutes, while <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> consolidated following the selling pressure that was triggered by cautious ECB minutes. <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> took a breather after real money buying interest helped a reclaim of the 1.4200 handle on Thursday, while <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses were propped up amid the overall risk-tone. Elsewhere, the HKMA authority continued to intervene and bought <strong>HKD</strong> 3.26bln in defence of the peg, while SGD initially strengthened after the MAS tightened its FX-based policy, although this was later pared as the decision was as expected and the central bank also suggested a cautiousness regarding the ongoing trade spat between US and China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures pulled back below the USD 67.00/bbl as the geopolitical concerns, which had fuelled oil to levels last seen in 2014, took a back seat. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> prices found some reprieve from the pressure seen since Wednesday&rsquo;s hawkish FOMC minutes, while <strong>copper</strong> is indecisive following disappointing Chinese trade data which showed an unexpected trade deficit, surprise contraction in exports and a miss on imports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China March iron ore imports fell 10% Y/Y to 85.8mln tons, while copper and copper product imports rose 2.1% Y/Y to 438k tons. (Newswires)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There were initial source reports that the US was planning to strike 8 targets in Syria. However, White House Press Secretary Sanders later said no final decision was made regarding Syria</strong> after President Trump finished meeting with his national security team. Furthermore, Twitter sources reported US President Trump put off his final decision regarding strikes on Syria in meeting with security advisers amid internal conflict between Secretary of Defense Mattis and National Security Advisor Bolton. (Newswires/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK PM May and US President Trump spoke on Thursday and agreed it was vital to deter the further use by Syrian government of chemicals weapons</strong>, while the leaders agreed to keep working closely on international response to Syria chemical weapons use and stated that chemical weapons use must not go unchallenged. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK cabinet backed military action against Syria</strong> in which it agreed on the need to take action to alleviate humanitarian distress and to deter the further use of chemical weapons by Assad. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State nominee Pompeo said more work needs to be done on Russian sanctions as Putin has not yet received the message sufficiently, while he added that there is no sign Iran is racing towards a nuclear weapon and that there is &#39;long way to go&#39; on North Korea even after talks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European diplomat believes progress is being made towards Trump concerns on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear deal. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury yields were higher on Thursday with short-dated yields up by 4bps and long-end yields up around 5bps by settlement, although most of the selling was in the belly of the curve. Selling pressure was seen pre-market after Trump&rsquo;s tweet hinted that military action might not be in the offing. Even later in the session, when it emerged the US was close to military action, the Treasury complex struggled to catch a bid. The US completed this week&rsquo;s supply offering with an auction of 30-year bonds, which stopped through the screens by 0.1bps, the strongest auction this week. Traders were encouraged by the direct bidders after the weakness seen this week, while indirects took down 61%, in line with recent averages. US 10yr T-Notes settle 12 ticks lower at 120-15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>White House is planning to increase trade pressure on China and the US Trade Representative will detail a list of goods as early as next week</strong> that may be subject to 25% tariffs as part of possible USD 100bln of additional tariffs on China. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Special Counsel Mueller is said to be preparing a minimum of 4 findings to make case of obstruction of justice against US President Trump, while there were also reports that excerpts from former FBI Director Comey&rsquo;s new book stated it is possible President Trump sought to obstruct justice (NBC/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Republican Senator Roberts said President Trump indicated in a meeting that he assigned NEC Director Kudlow, US Trade Representative Lightizer and other advisers to have another look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership. However, President Trump later noted that the US would only join TPP if deal was substantially better than what was offered to prior administration. (Newswires/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter sources noted that Trump administration is to send spending cancellation proposal early next month in an effort to reduce some of the spending agreed to in the omnibus package, although senior GOP sources are said to be sceptical. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said to issue order related to task force to probe US postal system pricing on packages. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Non-Voter, Dove)</strong> repeated that he has not seen much wage growth nationally, while he added that the US must avert a trade war with China and that it is difficult to gauge where a trade dispute will end up.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as region initially took its cue from Wall St, where sentiment was underpinned after US President Trump tweets further alleviated fears of an imminent strike on Syria. This resulted to firm gains across all US major indices, while the financials sector outperformed as yields rose in the wake of the recent hawkish FOMC minutes. As such ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) are positive with Australian financials mostly kept afloat following an upbeat Financial Stability Review, while Japan benefits from the weaker currency - heightened risk dynamic. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) were underpinned at the open but then pared gains as the risk tone slightly deteriorated following a CNY 100bln net weekly drain by the PBoC and with the White House said to be planning to escalate trade pressure on China, while the region also digests disappointing Chinese trade data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the majors are relatively inconclusive overnight with the DXY maintaining the gradual upward trajectory seen since this week&rsquo;s hawkish FOMC minutes, while EUR/USD consolidates following the selling pressure that was triggered by cautious ECB minutes. GBP/USD takes a breather after real money buying interest helped a reclaim of the 1.4200 handle on Thursday, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are propped up amid the overall risk-tone. Elsewhere, the HKMA authority continued to intervene and bought HKD 3.26bln in defence of the peg, while SGD initially strengthened after the MAS tightened its FX-based policy, although this was later pared as the decision was as expected and the central bank also suggested a cautiousness ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand subdued by a positive tone seen in Japanese stocks, but with downside also stemmed amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 840bln in maturities across the curve.</p>\r\n",
