        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities down, Treasuries up, DXY down, Crude down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Trump applies tariffs on China, China applies counter tariffs on US; US Industrial Production soft; Canada&rsquo;s Manufacturing Sales disappoint; hawkish Dudley, dovish Kaplan.<br />* NEXT WEEK: BoE, SNB, Norges Bank and Banxico Rate Decision; OPEC Meeting; RBA Minutes.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WAR: </strong>The US confirmed it will implement 25% tariffs on USD 50bln of Chinese imports; US President Trump stated that further tariffs will be applied if China retaliates. The list of goods subjects to tariffs was said to include high-tech goods on China&rsquo;s 2025 Plan. The first set of tariffs will be placed on 818 of goods, totalling USD 34bln, and will be applied from the 6 July; the second set will be USD 16bln announced at a later date and will contain 284 product lines. The USTR said the list will include a total of 1,102 goods and does not include products used often by American consumers, such as mobile phones or TV&#39;s. Despite Trump&rsquo;s warnings, China retaliated later in the day, China announced USD 34bln of retaliatory tariffs on US 659 agricultural and autos goods from 6 July &ndash; seemingly mimicking the US&rsquo; moves; additionally, 25% tariffs on chemicals, medical equipment, energy products and soybeans will be applied too. China will also impose tariffs on US crude oil, natgas, some refined products at a later date. Analysts noted that aircrafts were not on china&rsquo;s tariff list Separately Fox sources reported that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is said to have warned Trump of dire economic consequences and possible market collapse if China tariffs were imposed; the report added that people close to Mnuchin said he had no plans to resign, despite losing the battle on tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Dudley (Voter, Dovish) said to expect rates to climb a bit above neutral to a &lsquo;slightly restrictive policy stance&rsquo; in this cycle, and added that the US&rsquo; &#39;unsustainable&#39; fiscal position could affect policy through 2020. He pressed that inflation be kept in check to safeguard employment, and sees risks that trade and immigration policy could negatively impact the US economy. Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter) says Fed should move towards neutral in a gradual manner, and was careful not to prejudge if the Fed should pause at that point or now. He sees the near-term outlook as strong; says base case is for three hikes in 2018; he suggested that the yield curve has been flattening due to sluggish expectations about the future, adding that the Fed will not knowingly raise interest rates in a manner that inverts the yield curve; Kaplan also said that the size of US debt is a factor the Fed considers in its rate policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>Industrial Production was down 0.1% MM, short of the expected 0.2%. Looking at the breakdown, Manufacturing Output was down 0.7% and also missed on the expected 0.1% mainly due to the auto sector which fell by 6.5%. Capacity Utilization came in slightly lower at 77.9% vs. consensus of 78.1%. Utility Output was up 1.1% amid the warmer weather which saw heating perhaps being replaced by demand for air-conditioning. Despite the softer reading, the ISM Survey remains strong and there is no source of worry given that core manufacturing is up by around 2% YY, Pantheon said, and this is likely to persist going forward. Elsewhere, Canadian Manufacturing Sales disappointed and posted a 1.3% fall against the expected 0.6% increase on the back of partial closure of Canadian refineries, which pushed oil and coal sales down 10.9% in April. The outlook does appear weak for sales, with the most notable gains in primary manufacturing which could have reflected temporary exemption from US tariffs which arguably will soon turn into heavy losses, analysts at Capital Economics noted. Overall, the data shows that economic growth hasn&rsquo;t shown a rebound from the Q1 weakness which would keep the BoC to stay put on interest rate hikes, it added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.1%, NASDAQ COMP -0.2%, DJI -0.3%. </strong>US equity futures endure a choppy session, falling from premarket levels beneath the key ~2790 area, before basing above 2770 after the US announced tariffs on China. We entered a consolidation pattern, before seeing sharp gains higher in late trade towards 2785, which traders were attributing to a mixture of technical, as well as quad witching day; however ES retreated from those levels after a list of products the China would impose tariffs on emerged. Shares with a large exposure to China were hit after the US announced tariffs on Chinese goods, and warned against retaliation; IE JD.com (JD), Alibaba (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU) were particularly hit. Steel companies AK Steel (AKS), US Steel (X), Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) were also whacked. M&amp;A news today focused on NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Qualcomm (QCOM) where initial reports stated it received approval from China, however sources familiar with the matter stated this was not the case and approval is still needed. In other stock Specifics: Adobe (ADBE) reported its numbers after market on Thursday, and they were better than expected, with the company also providing firmer guidance for Q3. On a negative note, the CFO did announce the closing of &lsquo;Magento&rsquo; is likely to be slightly dilutive to the Q3 EPS target next quarter. Nonetheless, many large banks/brokers did increase their price targets on Abode. Elsewhere, Apple (AAPL) is reportedly planning to focus on cheaper display screens for its next line up, which hit the price of Universal Display (OLED)..</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) SETTLE 4+ TICKS higher AT 119.28+.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (N8) SETTLE $1.83 LOWER AT $65.06/BBL; BRENT (Q8) SETTLES $2.50 LOWER AT $73.44/BBL. </strong>The crude complex plunged on Friday, with traders suggesting the option expiries, and positing for OPEC, and some murmurs of the Mexico hedge, begin cited. Brent was down more than $2 as investors prepare for next week&rsquo;s OPEC+ meeting during which the world&rsquo;s largest oil producers are expected to agree on relaxing supply curbs. The Russian Energy Ministry Novak confirmed OPEC+ participants will discuss possible changes to production quotas and further cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC countries in meetings next week. Elsewhere, Russian President Putin has discussed question on the OPEC+ deal extension with his security council. Finally, two sources reported Saudi Arabia is planning a leaders&#39; summit this year for OPEC and allies to build a framework of cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;* WEEKLY FX WRAP: </strong>USD: Ending Friday&rsquo;s session some way off best levels in outright and aggregate terms after some disappointing US data in the form of IP, manufacturing output and capacity utilisation, but mainly as tariff tensions resurfaced via Usd50 bn import taxes on Chinese goods and the threat of retaliatory action from Beijing. However, the Dollar and DXY are still on course sign off with healthy gains on the week as a whole, as the index hovers around 94.700 vs circa 93.500 early on Monday, albeit down from its new 95.138 best for the year so far. The historic US-NK summit and pledge to work towards denuclearisation gave the Greenback a lift, but Wednesday&rsquo;s &lsquo;hawkish&rsquo; Fed hike that saw the FOMC raise its 2018 rate guidance to 2 further rises from 1 previously actually left the Usd unimpressed and softer after a knee-jerk rally, before other factors propelled it higher again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The biggest G10 loser after the ECB&rsquo;s &lsquo;dovish&rsquo; QE taper and signal that asset buying is likely to cease completely after a 3 month extension from September to December at a reduced Eur15 bn/monthly pace vs Eur30 bn currently. The single currency spiked initially to around 1.1850 vs the Usd, but then slumped on rate guidance for the first tightening after summer next year, at the earliest, vs market expectations for mid-2019 ahead of the latest policy meeting. Eur/Usd reversed even further through the press conference as President Draghi stressed optionality and conditionality, with all conventional and non-conventional tools remaining available if inflation fails to remain on a sustained path towards target. A low just south of 1.1550 was posted earlier today, but the aforementioned broad Usd pull-pack and some Eur short covering prompted a recovery back to and just over 1.1600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Undermined by weak UK data from the off (ip, manufacturing/construction output and trade), Cable remained relatively steady through some mixed releases, like CPI and jobs/earnings, but then received a welcome boost via much stronger than expected retail sales. However, the Pound then retreated in sympathy and tandem with the Eur to hit 1.3210 from almost 1.3450 at best, largely shrugging off various Brexit bill amendment debates/votes that were semi-successful for PM May until compromises on the meaningful vote made by the Government were rejected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The G7 war of words between Canadian PM Trudeau and US President Trump that resulted in the latter refusing to sign the official communique put the Loonie on the backfoot and sentiment continued to sour almost throughout the week on a combination of heightened NAFTA uncertainty (that also undermined the Peso as Usd/Mxn accelerated further above 20.0000) and disappointing data (like Canadian manufacturing sales that slumped 1.3% vs +0.6% expected). Usd/Cad has surpassed chart resistance around 1.3165 to 1.3180 peak having been as low as 1.2945 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>USDJPY has traded from 109.20-110.90, and most on an upward trajectory inversely with the Dollar and in lock-step with overall risk sentiment. However, the highs were seen after the BoJ downgraded its inflation outlook and Governor Kuroda effectively laid to rest any prospect of an &lsquo;early&rsquo; exit from powerful QQE, while a string of weak data also justified this dovish stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>RBA commentary focused on weak wage growth yet again, and the latest Aussie labour report merely compounded concerns as the headline payroll number fell short of expectations, while permanent jobs actually fell. Hence, alongside global trade tensions the Aud and Nzd underperformed markedly with the latter down below 0.7450 vs 0.7625 at the high and the Kiwi under 0.6950 for a roughly full point drop from peak to trough this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>Somewhat mixed and caught between Usd strength vs Eur weakness to trade near parity and 1.1500 respectively, but almost certain to see the SNB maintain a loose stance on monetary policy next week, but tight rein on currency moves for fear of an overvalued Franc become even stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SCANDI, EM: </strong>Starkly contrasting fortunes for the Sek and Nok compared to Try, Ars, Brl and Zar etc, as upbeat surveys from both the Riksbank and Norges Bank offset soft Swedish and Norwegian inflation updates to keep them on track to hike rates ahead of the ECB (and given latter&rsquo;s latest guidance probably even quicker). Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok both hit fresh 2018 lows in response (former sub-10.1000 and latter sub-9.400 and latter , but EMs only derived limited support/reprieves from ongoing official intervention, direct and via monetary tightening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NEXT WEEK: OPEC MEETING: </strong>On 21 June, the JMMC will meet ahead of OPEC&rsquo;s 174 the Meeting on 22 June, and then a joint OPEC non-OPEC meeting will take place on 23 June. Participants are set to review the current pact to that restricts oil output by 1.8mln BPD. Russia and Saudi Arabia has heavily hinted in recent weeks that supply curbs may be eased in order to offset production declines in Venezuela and Angola, and looking ahead, possibly (likely) Iran due to the re-imposition of US sanctions on the nation, and maintain market stability. &ldquo;Saudi Arabia and Russia have been heavily hinting at an easing of production quotas, ostensibly in the interest of maintaining market stability in the context of downside risk to Venezuelan and Iranian supply, growing demand, and evident success in normalising the market,&rdquo; UBS writes. &ldquo;Inventories have fallen below the 5-year average and Brent prices are above $70/bbl.&rdquo; But there have been comments from other OPEC+ members &ndash; Iraq and Venezuela being the loud voices &ndash; indicating that it may not be as straightforward. UBS suggests that OPEC will have memories of 1997, where it raised production into a weakening market; however, this occasion appears to be different, with global demand growth forecasts generally holding up quite well in the latest batch of EIA/IEA/OPEC monthly reports. Additionally, it remains to be seen to what extent capacity can be lifted: among OPEC members, UBS estimates spare capacity of just 1.1mln BPD, though over a horizon of 90 days, that could be seen around 3.4mln BPD. &ldquo;As a non-OPEC member we expect Russia to be keen to return to unconstrained production as quickly as possible. We also think Saudi has shown itself to be willing to go it alone (as it did in 2011 and 2014) but would prefer to reach consensus,&rdquo; UBS says, and its expectation is that around 300k BPD to 400k BPD will be released, implying balanced markets in 2H18, but with flexibility retained.&rdquo; For the full &lsquo;<a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19405/download\">Week in Focus&rsquo; report click here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NEXT WEEK: BOE: </strong>Thursday sees the latest policy announcement from the Bank of England (no QIR and no post-meeting press conference with Governor Carney) with the Bank expected to keep rates at 0.50% in a 7-2 vote. Last month, the MPC drew criticism after the lack of clarity in its forward guidance after its findings appeared to be at odds with the messages presented by the February QIR. This was largely as a by-product of the soft Q1 GDP figures, which showed QQ growth of just 0.1%. At the time, the BoE stated that it thought the impact of adverse weather conditions was larger than that suggested by the ONS, and thus the meeting will likely see the MPC look to buy time to confirm its viewpoint. Capital Economics highlights &ldquo;May&rsquo;s Markit/CIPS surveys suggest that the economy is expanding at a quarterly pace of around 0.4%, in line with the Bank of England&rsquo;s latest Inflation Report forecast&rdquo;. Capital Economics also goes on to suggest that &ldquo;since the survey does not account for activity on the high street &ndash; which has surged in Q2 so far &ndash; if anything it might be understating growth&rdquo;. As such, the research consultancy expects rate hikes to resume later in the year with the possibility of two hikes if wages recover and inflation falls at a faster rate than envisaged by the BoE. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19347/download\">For the full &lsquo;Central Bank Weekly&rsquo; report click here.</a></p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: G7 rifts, Central Bank policy shifts and more trade tiffs",
        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Friday&rsquo;s session some way off best levels in outright and aggregate terms after some disappointing US data in the form of ip, manufacturing output and capacity utilisation, but mainly as tariff tensions resurfaced via Usd50 bn import taxes on Chinese goods and the threat of retaliatory action from Beijing. However, the Dollar and DXY are still on course sign off with healthy gains on the week as a whole, as the index hovers around 94.700 vs circa 93.500 early on Monday, albeit down from its new 95.138 best for the year so far. The historic US-NK summit and pledge to work towards denuclearisation gave the Greenback a lift, but Wednesday&rsquo;s &lsquo;hawkish&rsquo; Fed hike that saw the FOMC raise its 2018 rate guidance to 2 further rises from 1 previously actually left the Usd unimpressed and softer after a knee-jerk rally, before other factors propelled it higher again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest G10 loser after the ECB&rsquo;s &lsquo;dovish&rsquo; QE taper and signal that asset buying is likely to cease completely after a 3 month extension from September to December at a reduced Eur15 bn/monthly pace vs Eur30 bn currently. The single currency spiked initially to around 1.1850 vs the Usd, but then slumped on rate guidance for the first tightening after summer next year, at the earliest, vs market expectations for mid-2019 ahead of the latest policy meeting. Eur/Usd reversed even further through the press conference as President Draghi stressed optionality and conditionality, with all conventional and non-conventional tools remaining available if inflation fails to remain on a sustained path towards target. A low just south of 1.1550 was posted earlier today, but the aforementioned broad Usd pull-pack and some Eur short covering prompted a recovery back to and just over 1.1600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Undermined by weak UK data from the off (ip, manufacturing/construction output and trade), Cable remained relatively steady through some mixed releases, like CPI and jobs/earnings, but then received a welcome boost via much stronger than expected retail sales. However, the Pound then retreated in sympathy and tandem with the Eur to hit 1.3210 from almost 1.3450 at best, largely shrugging off various Brexit bill amendment debates/votes that were semi-successful for PM May until compromises on the meaningful vote made by the Government were rejected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The G7 war of words between Canadian PM Trudeau and US President Trump that resulted in the latter refusing to sign the official communique put the Loonie on the backfoot and sentiment continued to sour almost throughout the week on a combination of heightened NAFTA uncertainty (that also undermined the Peso as Usd/Mxn accelerated further above 20.0000) and disappointing data (like Canadian manufacturing sales that slumped 1.3% vs +0.6% expected). Usd/Cad has surpassed chart resistance around 1.3165 to 1.3180 peak having been as low as 1.2945 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Jpy has traded from 109.20-110.90, and most on an upward trajectory inversely with the Dollar and in lock-step with overall risk sentiment. However, the highs were seen after the BoJ downgraded its inflation outlook and Governor Kuroda effectively laid to rest any prospect of an &lsquo;early&rsquo; exit from powerful QQE, while a string of weak data also justified this dovish stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA commentary focused on weak wage growth yet again, and the latest Aussie labour report merely compounded concerns as the headline payroll number fell short of expectations, while permanent jobs actually fell. Hence, alongside global trade tensions the Aud and Nzd underperformed markedly with the latter down below 0.7450 vs 0.7625 at the high and the Kiwi under 0.6950 for a roughly full point drop from peak to trough this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhat mixed and caught between Usd strength vs Eur weakness to trade near parity and 1.1500 respectively, but almost certain to see the SNB maintain a loose stance on monetary policy next week, but tight rein on currency moves for fear of an overvalued Franc become even stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCANDI/EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starkly contrasting fortunes for the Sek and Nok compared to Try, Ars, Brl and Zar etc, as upbeat surveys from both the Riksbank and Norges Bank offset soft Swedish and Norwegian inflation updates to keep them on track to hike rates ahead of the ECB (and given latter&rsquo;s latest guidance probably even quicker). Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok both hit fresh 2018 lows in response (former sub-10.1000 and latter sub-9.400 and latter , but EMs only derived limited support/reprieves from ongoing official intervention, direct and via monetary tightening.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) traded higher with Australia the outperformer on broad gains across all sectors. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) were lower despite the PBoC conducting a net weekly injection of CNY 240bln and Pledged Supplementary Lending operation, as Trump&rsquo;s decision to impose tariffs on USD 50bln of Chinese goods overshadowed the central bank&rsquo;s liquidity efforts. Finally, price action in 10yr JGBs was uneventful throughout the morning amid gains in Japanese stocks and with participants side-lined prior to the BoJ conclusion, although JGBs later saw mild support on following the BoJ announcement in which the central bank kept policy unchanged but downgraded its assessment on inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump has decided to impose tariffs on USD 50bln of Chinese imports. In related news, President Trump is preparing to release a refined USD 100bln tariff list which will target technologies China aims to be a leader in according to sources, while there were also reports that China is said to be prepared to retaliate against US tariffs. (WSJ/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 7-day reverse repos, JPY 30bln via 14-day reverse repos and CNY 20bln via 28-day reverse repos, for a net weekly injection of CNY 270bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 300bln net drain. PBoC also announced a CNY 60.5bln Pledged Supplementary Lending facility operation.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ kept monetary policy unchanged as expected with NIRP held at -0.1% and 10yr JGB yield target at around 0%, while the decision was made by 8-1 vote with Kataoka the dovish dissenter again. Furthermore, the BoJ maintained its assessment of Japan&#39;s economy which it stated is expanding moderately, although the central bank cut its assessment on inflation and said that inflation expectations are proceeding sideways. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Nowotny (Hawkish) said inflation is in line with the ECB&#39;s target, adds ECB is beginning normalization without setting off a taper tantrum, sees a trend toward USD appreciation.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European stocks are mixed in the wake of a rally driven by the ECB policy announcement in yesterday&rsquo;s trade. The outperforming bourse is currently the CAC (+0.2%) with the IBEX (-0.8%) underperforming on the back of poor Spanish bank performance (Bankia -2.0%, Santander -1.8% and BBVA -1.3%). Lower yields are weighing on the baking sector as a whole, with the EU financial sector underperforming. The energy sector is seeing some pressure from lower oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rolls Royce (+10.0%) is leading gains as the co. affirmed FCF guidance for 2018, and outlined a mid-term ambition to deliver GBP 1 per share of FCF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesco (+2.2%) is also up on the back of positive earnings results and encouraging comments on the Bookers merger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H&amp;M (-4.5%) reported uninspiring earnings and are negative for the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Fresh 2018 highs for the index around 95.140 before a retracement back below the 95.000 mark amidst latest US vs China tariff talk ahead of the anticipated announcement targeting an initial $50 bn goods. However, the Greenback is still firmly bid against the bulk of its rivals on further divergence in monetary policy following this week&rsquo;s FOMC rate hike and shift to tighter guidance for H2 this year. Technically, DXY bulls will be eyeing 95.150 and then 95.470 assuming no major trend reversal and or deeper Usd pull-back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - Extended post-ECB losses for the single currency and a concerted attack against barrier defences vs the Greenback at 1.1550, but only a minor breach and subsequent recovery to just over 1.1600. However, the Eur still looks heavy across the board in wake of Thursday&rsquo;s dovish QE unwind from the ECB and rate guidance flagging a 6+ month gap between the end of asset purchases and first tightening move. For reference, 1.1510 is the ytd low and in terms of option expiries, 1.4 bn at the 1.1600 strike could be influential, but also 1 bn in Eur/Jpy at 127.50 as the cross straddles 128.00. No reaction to unrevised Eurozone inflation data or relatively hawkish comments from ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny who also noted the Dollar&rsquo;s stronger trend, but selling and buying in fast market conditions on reports about Germany&rsquo;s CDU/CSU partnership ending were swiftly &ldquo;rubbished&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD - All victims of the Usd rally to new ytd peaks as the Aud loses grip of another big figure to test support ahead of 0.7450, but actually holds up better than its NZ peer in a role-reversal with the Kiwi failing to stay above 0.7000 and down through 0.6950, and the Aud/Nzd cross bouncing off 1.0700. Meanwhile, the Loonie continues to languish post-G7 with the US-Canada row hardly conducive to resolving NAFTA issues, and Usd/Cad has climbed just over 1.3150 accordingly to expose 1.3165 chart resistance ahead of 1.3200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF/GBP - Relative G10 outperformers or at least consolidating, with Usd/Jpy fading ahead of 111.00 even though the BoJ downgraded its inflation outlook and appears on course to continuing powerful QQE for even longer. Now around 110.50 and back under a key fib (110.62) decent option expiry interest may come into play (1.1 bn). The Franc remains just above parity, but obviously strong vs the Eur circa 1.1550 and likely to prompt more overvalued proclamations from the SNB next week, while Cable continues to track wider moves (mainly in line with the Eur) and has rebounded from near 1.3210 lows with option-related bids said to be in place from 1.3200-05</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some consolidation, profit-taking, pure fatigue and perhaps hawkish-leaning rhetoric from ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny has dented the bond rally, with Bunds drifting back down towards 161.00 and Gilts actually unwinding all their earlier gains to trade just below par at 122.37. However, this looks like a pause for breath overall even though the scale of gains made in wake of yesterday&rsquo;s ECB meeting are pronounced and arguably over-extended, as month end looms and could come with debt-supportive factors like lengthy index durations. On the flip-side, the Eur and non-Usd counterparts are rebounding further off worst levels and pre-weekend positioning will also impact as Friday&rsquo;s session draws to a close. Elsewhere, US Treasuries have also eased back from overnight highs but remain firm and in bull-flattening mode ahead of a busy end of week data docket, and awaiting the US vs China tariff list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is negative on the day as the week end approaches, with WTI -0.2% and Brent -0.7%, as investors look forward to further developments of the OPEC cut deal, OPEC&rsquo;s meeting late next week, and rig counts later in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope Gold is stagnant at ~USD 1300/oz. Steel has hit over 9 month highs as Chinese property data posted firm results, and is set to be in the green for the 3rd straight week.

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh 2018 highs for the index around 95.140 before a retracement back below the 95.000 mark amidst latest US vs China tariff talk ahead of the anticipated announcement targeting an initial $50 bn goods. However, the Greenback is still firmly bid against the bulk of its rivals on further divergence in monetary policy following this week&rsquo;s FOMC rate hike and shift to tighter guidance for H2 this year. Technically, DXY bulls will be eyeing 95.150 and then 95.470 assuming no major trend reversal and or deeper Usd pull-back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extended post-ECB losses for the single currency and a concerted attack against barrier defences vs the Greenback at 1.1550, but only a minor breach and subsequent recovery towards 1.1600. However, the Eur still looks heavy across the board in wake of Thursday&rsquo;s dovish QE unwind from the ECB and rate guidance flagging a 6+ month gap between the end of asset purchases and first tightening move. For reference, 1.1510 is the ytd low and in terms of option expiries, 1.4 bn at the 1.1600 strike could be influential, but also 1 bn in Eur/Jpy at 127.50 as the cross straddles 128.00. No reaction to unrevised Eurozone inflation data or relatively hawkish comments from ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny who also noted the Dollar&rsquo;s stronger trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All victims of the Usd rally to new ytd peaks as the Aud loses grip of another big figure to test support ahead of 0.7450, but actually holds up better than its NZ peer in a role-reversal with the Kiwi failing to stay above 0.7000 and down through 0.6950, and the Aud/Nzd cross bouncing off 1.0700. Meanwhile, the Loonie continues to languish post-G7 with the US-Canada row hardly conducive to resolving NAFTA issues, and Usd/Cad has climbed just over 1.3150 accordingly to expose 1.3165 chart resistance ahead of 1.3200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative G10 outperformers or at least consolidating, with Usd/Jpy fading ahead of 111.00 even though the BoJ downgraded its inflation outlook and appears on course to continuing powerful QQE for even longer. Now around 110.50 and back under a key fib (110.62) decent option expiry interest may come into play (1.1 bn). The Franc remains just above parity, but obviously strong vs the Eur circa 1.1550 and likely to prompt more overvalued proclamations from the SNB next week, while Cable continues to track wider moves (mainly in line with the Eur) and has rebounded from near 1.3210 lows with option-related bids said to be in place from 1.3200-05.</p>\r\n",

As such, EUR/USD trades with a 1.15 handle, while GBP/USD languished firmly below 1.3300 amid Brexit-bickering with the government&rsquo;s compromise on the &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo; rejected by influential pro-EU Tory MPs who deemed it as &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and which reports suggest could lead to another Brexit rebellion next week.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were somewhat mixed as region digested a dovish ECB in which the central bank announced to taper its monthly net purchases from September but also suggested no rate hikes until the summer of 2019 at the earliest, while participants also mulled over Trump&rsquo;s decision to impose tariffs on China. ASX 200 (+1.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) traded higher with Australia the outperformer on broad gains across all sectors and with Sirtex among the biggest movers after the Co. recommended shareholders vote for the CDH Investments bid which it determined was superior to Varian&rsquo;s proposal. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) were lower despite the PBoC conducting a net weekly injection of CNY 240bln and Pledged Supplementary Lending operation, as Trump&rsquo;s decision to impose tariffs on USD 50bln of Chinese goods overshadowed the central bank&rsquo;s liquidity efforts. Finally, price action in 10yr JGBs was uneventful throughout the morning amid gains in Japanese stocks and with participants side-lined prior to the BoJ conclusion, although JGBs later saw mild support on following the BoJ announcement in which the central bank kept policy unchanged but downgraded its assessment on inflation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are somewhat mixed as region digests a dovish ECB in which the central bank announced to taper its monthly net purchases from September but also suggested no rate hikes until the summer of 2019 at the earliest, while participants also mull over Trump&rsquo;s decision to impose tariffs on China. ASX 200 (+1.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) are higher in which Australia outperforms on broad gains across all sectors and with Sirtex among the biggest movers after the Co. recommended shareholders vote for the CDH Investments bid which it determined was superior to Varian&rsquo;s proposal. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are lower despite the PBoC conducting a net weekly injection of CNY 240bln and Pledged Supplementary Lending operation, as Trump&rsquo;s decision to impose tariffs on USD 50bln of Chinese goods overshadows the central bank&rsquo;s liquidity efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD remains firm against all counterparts with the DXY approaching the 95.00 level in the wake of this week&rsquo;s central bank action, in which the dovish taper by the ECB was at a sharp contrast to the more hawkish undertone by the FOMC. As such, EUR/USD remains below the 1.1600 handle, while GBP/USD languishes firmly below 1.3300 amid Brexit-bickering with the government&rsquo;s compromise on the &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo; rejected by influential pro-EU Tory MPs who deemed it as &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and which suggests the government may face another Brexit rebellion next week. Elsewhere, antipodeans are lacklustre with all currencies swept by the rising greenback and JPY is indecisive amid the mixed risk tone and ahead of today&rsquo;s BoJ decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid gains in Japanese stocks and with participants side-lined prior to the BoJ policy announcement. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The BoJ is to conclude its 2-day policy meeting later in which the central bank is expected to maintain its QQE with Yield Curve Control and keep NIRP at -0.10%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expectations for the BoJ to maintain its ultra-loose policy have been supported by a slew of disappointing data since the last meeting including Q1 GDP Y/Y -0.6% vs. Exp. -0.4% (Prev. -0.6%), while inflation is also at a considerable distance to the 2% target with April headline CPI at 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.7% (Prev. 1.1%) and Core CPI at 0.7% vs. Exp. 0.8% (Prev. 0.9%). Furthermore, Exports, Imports, Industrial Production and Household Spending figures have also missed estimates which lessens the likelihood the central bank will be rushing to tighten policy and could increase calls for more supportive measures if the weak data trend persists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rhetoric from the central bank continues to suggest no policy changes in the near term as BoJ Governor Kuroda stated they are currently not seeing conditions rife to study timing of exit and will not exit easy policy prior to reaching 2% price target, while Kuroda also commented that there are no plans to move the 10yr yield target for the time being as inflation is still at a distance from 2% target. BoJ Deputy Governor Wakatabe advocated a similar view and stated the economy is still distant from the price goal and thus too early to talk about specific exit strategies, while board member Sakurai also noted it is currently time to patiently maintain easy monetary policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other factors that are also likely to influence the BoJ to stand pat include recent gains in oil prices in which WTI rose towards USD 73/bbl last month to print its highest since 2014 and although prices have since pulled back, the overall firmer prices this year would be seen as a tailwind in Japan&rsquo;s pursuit of the inflation goal. Elsewhere, next year&rsquo;s scheduled sales tax hike also supports calls for the BoJ to maintain a prolonged wait-and-see approach considering the detrimental effects the last sales tax hike had on Japan&rsquo;s economy 4 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;As usual, there is no exact scheduled release time for the BoJ which tends to be anytime following the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0330BST/2130CDT. The announcement is also not expected to be eventful in terms of price action as has been the case for quite a while, unless there are any major surprises or significant changes to the rhetoric especially given the recent streak of substandard data. However, it is also worth noting that at the last meeting the BoJ surprisingly removed its reference to reaching the inflation target around FY19, which didn&rsquo;t get much of a reaction from markets and was seen to be an acknowledgement of the arduous road towards the price target, but also effectively relieves pressure on the BoJ to ease further.</p>\r\n",
