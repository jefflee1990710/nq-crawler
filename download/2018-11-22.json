Friday the desk will operate a normal service on Friday until 1845GMT/1245CST, upon which the desk will close given the US market closures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The European Commission and British negotiators have struck an agreement on the text of their political declaration for future EU-UK ties post-Brexit. European Council President Tusk said the text has been agreed at the negotiators level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the Leaders&rdquo; ahead of Sunday&#39;s summit. The draft document outlined that the EU and UK are determined to replace the backstop in the future, the EU are to recognise the UK&#39;s independent trade practice and the transition period can be extended once for a maximum of two years with a joint decision to be taken before 1st July 2020. In briefing the parliament, UK PM May added that the text makes explicit reference to development of independent trade policy for the UK, it ends free movement and protects the union while it would imply leaving the common agricultural policy and common fisheries policy; she also made clear that to the Spanish PM that Gibraltar&#39;s British sovereignty must be protected. Elsewhere, UK PM May&rsquo;s spokesperson noted that no final deal can be agreed without the approval of the EU council on Sunday. Sources suggested that the EU 27 leaders aim to endorse separate declaration on Sunday along with Brexit package to cover fisheries, environmental standards and Gibraltar given that the issues do not appear to be resolved. Separately, Northern Ireland DUP Lawmaker Donaldson if the UK wants DUP support it needs to see the end of the backstop while some reports suggested that over 50% of Tory backbenchers have publicly indicated they will not vote for the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> There were mixed opinions on Thursday over whether the government is open to negotiations with the EU over the resubmitted 2019 budget plan as Deputy PMs Salvini and Di Maio continue to appear reluctant to make any adjustments. In comments, Salvini stressed the country will not backtrack on the budget law noting that the only thing the EU cannot ask Italy is to change is the unwinding of the pension reform and accused EU commissioner Moscovici of insulting Italy; PM Conte stated EU demands to cut the deficit aren&#39;t compatible with the state of the economy and he will ask for a long time-frame to implement EU requests on the budget; Di Maio ruled out any changes to the plan prior to EU elections while remaining open for discussion with the EU. Eurosceptic European Affairs Minister Savona was also said to be strongly in favour of amending the budget plan, voices later denied. In related news, Italian President Mattarella urged PM Conte to reach a deal with European Commission President Juncker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> US President Trump said that China wants to make a deal on trade &quot;very badly&quot; and if we can make a deal we will. Elsewhere, Chinese Commerce Ministry said that China and US work teams remain in close contact to implement mutual understandings achieved by the countries&#39; leaders; China is deeply concerned about US new section 301 report update</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB MINUTES:</strong> In-fitting with the release itself, the account of the October meeting failed to instigate much in the way of price action. The minutes saw some members concerned &ldquo;that the uncertainties related to global factors remained prominent, and the risks related to the external environment were assessed to be tilted to the downside&rdquo;. This wasn&rsquo;t necessarily too surprising for markets as the ECB bulletin suggested that this was the case despite the ECB maintaining their language at the October announcement that risks to the Euro Area economy itself are broadly balanced. Nonetheless, the comment served as a timely reminder ahead of the December meeting that the Bank could be forced reassess their view of the domestic economy. Recent commentary from policymakers has helped highlight this issue with ECB&rsquo;s Draghi early this month stating that &ldquo;the current slowdown has raised questions about the strength of the growth outlook, and we&#39;re seeing a temporary soft patch&rdquo;. The question ahead of December is now whether or not a &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; soft patch will be enough to derail policymakers in their assessment of the Euro area and if that could impact the Bank&rsquo;s plan to lift rates in 2019; something which markets are eager to pin the bank down on. Elsewhere, the only reference to TLTRO&rsquo;s was that &ldquo;some TLTRO maturities would fall below 1yr, which could impact banks&#39; liquidity position&rdquo;, however, this offered little insight into whether or not the Bank will opt to launch a further round of TLTROs next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Praet said he is confident that underlying inflation pressures are rising but it will time and it requires monetary policy to remain accommodative; he noted that downside risks have increased but at this stage the picture remains broadly balanced. Core inflation at around 1% is enough to reach our aim in sustained manner while he believes it is too early to decide on new TLTRO now and early adjustments to key interest rates and their constellation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>* SARB:</strong> The central bank hiked its Repo rate by 25bps to 6.75% at its meeting on Thursday; the vote was split on the decision with 3 members voting to hold rates at 6.50% and 3 pushing&nbsp; for a 25bps hike. The decision was based on the MPC view that the rising inflation trajectory which, while remaining within target range, continues to deviate from the mid-point of target range; the central bank will continue to assess risks to the longer term inflation outlook to be on the upside. Additionally, the MPC noted that near-term outlook on inflation has improved but longer term risks still remain as growth is subdued and lacking any pressure on CPI driven by demand, TD Securities pointed out. Nonetheless, the SARB&rsquo;s model still projects an increase in headline inflation, even if slower than the September forecasts, with CPI seen averaging 4.7% in 2018 (September forecast 4.8%) and averaging 5.5% in 2019 (September forecast 5.7%). Looking ahead, Governor Kganyago announced that the implied path model shows 4 rate hikes of 25bps to 7.5% by end of 2020 suggesting a very gradual pace of hiking, Informa argued, adding that &ldquo;this may limit ZAR gains as it is clear the MPC has acted now to avoid deeper hikes down the line&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling has soared to the top of the G10 rankings, albeit rather belatedly, as news broke and details emerged on the political declaration for future ties between the UK and EU reached by the Brexit negotiators in advance of Sunday&rsquo;s summit. Cable took a while to clear 1.2800, but then gathered pace when 1.2850 was surpassed and only lost momentum through 1.2900 after failing to breach resistance just above that big figure convincingly. Similarly, EURGBP appeared somewhat reluctant to take out 0.8900, but when the cross broke below the round number selling accelerated to just under 0.8850, and before the Pound ran in to resistance, profit taking and the realisation that euphoria could be overdone or at least premature given ratification by EU leaders and UK Parliament is still needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The single currency has been stabilising amid thin trading conditions, and has brushed off the latest contentious commentary out of Italy after the EU rejected its 2019 budget. However, clearly the Italians and Europeans are maintaining channels of dialogue, helping to keep the euro in positive territory, supported also by Brexit headlines too. There was little reaction after the publication of the ECB&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes, where it flagged uncertainty around global factors, noting that external environment were judged to be to the downside, while there were also comments made that TLTRO maturities falling beneath one year could impact banks&rsquo; liquidity positions. As we go to print, the EUR is consolidating around 1.14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The buck was mixed on Thanksgiving, with US players out for the market holiday. Haven FX JPY and CHF were sold, the latter on optimism around Brexit. The DXY itself trades negative, with increasing noises about growth concerns weighing on the greenback after a few weak data points &ndash; next week&rsquo;s docket of Fed speakers (including Powell) and FOMC minutes may provide a catalyst, after the cautious tone expressed by some Fed speakers after the last fortnight (Clarida).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ZAR: </strong>Despite a split vote, the SARB rate hike lifted the Rand, in thing, holiday trading conditions, seeing USDZAR print a low of the day around 13.73. Technicians have suggested that a second close beneath the 14.00 level would be significant, and potentially open the door to the 13.30 region.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP: Sterling has soared to the top of the G10 rankings, albeit rather belatedly, as news broke and details emerged on the political declaration for future ties between the UK and EU reached by the Brexit negotiators in advance of Sunday&rsquo;s summit. Cable took a while to clear 1.2800, but then gathered pace when 1.2850 was surpassed and only lost momentum through 1.2900 after failing to breach resistance just above that big figure convincingly. Similarly, EURGBP appeared somewhat reluctant to take out 0.8900, but when the cross broke below the round number selling accelerated to just under 0.8850, and before the Pound ran in to resistance, profit taking and the realisation that euphoria could be overdone or at least premature given ratification by EU leaders and UK Parliament is still needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR: The single currency has been stabilising amid thin trading conditions, and has brushed off the latest contentious commentary out of Italy after the EU rejected its 2019 budget. However, clearly the Italians and Europeans are maintaining channels of dialogue, helping to keep the euro in positive territory, supported also by Brexit headlines too. There was little reaction after the publication of the ECB&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes, where it flagged uncertainty around global factors, noting that external environment were judged to be to the downside, wile there were also comments made that TLTRO maturities falling beneath one year could impact banks&rsquo; liquidity positions. As we go to print, the EUR is consolidating around 1.14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD: The buck was mixed on Thanksgiving, with US players out for the market holiday. Haven FX JPY and CHF were sold, the latter on optimism around Brexit. The DXY itself trades negative, with increasing noises about growth concerns weighing on the greenback after a few weak data points &ndash; next week&rsquo;s docket of Fed speakers (including Powell) and FOMC minutes may provide a catalyst, after the cautious tone expressed by some Fed speakers after the last fortnight (Clarida).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZAR: Despite a split vote, the SARB rate hike lifted the Rand, in thing, holiday trading conditions, seeing USDZAR print a low of the day around 13.73. Technicians have suggested that a second close beneath the 14.00 level would be significant, and potentially open the door to the 13.30 region.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>As has been the case for several months now, October&rsquo;s ECB policy announcement saw little in the way of fireworks after the central bank opted to maintain their current policy settings before unwinding their PSPP at the end of the year. Heading into the release, analysts speculated over whether recent developments in the Eurozone economy would force the hand of the governing council to suggest that risks surrounding growth are &lsquo;tilted to the downside&rsquo;. However, the Bank refrained from potentially disturbing markets before the conclusion of its QE programme and maintained its &lsquo;broadly balanced&rsquo; viewpoint. That said, any debate around this matter will be closely watched by the market: if there are any indications that it was a close decision to stick to their current assessment, markets could potentially expect an adjustment in the coming months if economic conditions fail to improve. Elsewhere, Draghi was quick to bat-away any questions on capital key recalculations, an extension to QE and what the Bank would do if the economic situation deteriorates by stating that they were not discussed. As such, the account of the meeting might be light in terms of clues about the Bank&rsquo;s future path of monetary policy. Furthermore, investors will likely be interested in any debate at the meeting regarding policymakers&rsquo; views on the Italian situation. However, commentary will likely echo remarks made by Draghi who, at the time, suggested that Italy should respect EU rules. Finally, market participants will also be looking out for any discussions on a potential further round of TLTRO&rsquo;s after speculation the Bank could embark on measures to help support domestic banks in 2019 as its PSPP draws to a close. However, such discussions may not necessarily feature in the October account after source reports at the beginning of November suggested the topic is not an urgent one at the ECB and may not feature in discussions at the Dec meeting.</p>\r\n",

Broad-based losses are experienced across major European bourses while UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 (-1.4%) underperforms on currency effects as the details of the draft Brexit political declaration emerged. UK banks have received a boost after the draft PD stated that the EU foresees equivalence for UK banks and as a result, Barclays (+0.3%), RBS (+1.9%) and Lloyds Banking Group (-0.3%) spiked to session highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB (-0.8%) is lower amid conflicting press reports in Italian politics, with the latest news stating that Italian Deputy PM Salvini will not backtrack on the budget, after it was rejected by the European Commission yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sectors are red across the board with underperformance in material names amid a decline in base metal prices amid the risk averse tone.&nbsp; In terms of individual movers, Altice (-13.3%) rests at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after revenues missed expectations, while investors keep an eye on Renault shares (-1.3%) with the Nissan board meeting underway to discuss the ousting of Nissan&rsquo;s chairman Ghosn after his arrest earlier this week due to alleged financial misconduct. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The marked outliers and major underperformers, with the Kiwi back below 0.6800 and Aud under 0.7250 as the cross pivots the 1.0650 level. Nothing really new in terms of NZ or Aussie specific catalysts for the relatively sharp retreats from recent highs, although ANZ predicted a 20% slump in property prices in Melbourne and Sydney overnight, but as usual the high-beta commodity currencies are more responsive to swings in overall sentiment and aversion is rearing its head again after faint respite ahead of the US Thanksgiving break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CHF/GBP/CAD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback in thin US holiday trade, with the single currency remaining close to the 1.1400 handle and its 100 HMA (1.1404) amidst more token or half-hearted murmurings from Rome about 2019 budget in an effort to appease the EU and avoid punitive deficit measures, which are hampering upside attempts along with decent option expiry interest (1.1 bn between 1.1430-40). Usd/Jpy is pivoting 113.00 on the aforementioned resumption of risk-off positioning/flows, which is also supporting the Franc to a degree within a 0.9930-50 range. Elsewhere, Cable has rebounded firmly over 1.2800, through 1.2850 and just shy of 1.2900+ resistance, while Eur/Gbp is back below 0.8900 and eyeing 0.8850 bids/support following reports that EU and UK negotiators have now reached an accord on the political declaration for post-Brexit relations. Meanwhile, the Loonie is holding up relatively well against the backdrop of retreating crude prices ahead of a speech from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK - The Scandi crowns are not immune from the loss of risk appetite and downturn in oil, with Eur/Nok up above 9.7500 and Eur/Sek touching 10.3300 after Riksbank commentary courtesy of Skingsley downplaying minor deviations and fluctuations in the rate of inflation, but keeping policy intentions under wraps awaiting more data before the December meeting (including and pivotally the next Swedish CPI report on December 12th).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proof remains very much in the pudding and pending Parliament approval assuming EU leaders sign off on the draft this Sunday, but for now at least the markets are giving the draft declaration their benefit of doubt. Indeed, the 10 year UK bond has reversed markedly, albeit rather belatedly from a minor new Liffe high of 123.19 to a fresh and deeper 122.58 trough (-41 ticks), with Bunds retreating in sympathy from 160.87 to retest the early 160.63 base vs Wednesday&rsquo;s 160.58 close and US Treasuries also acknowledging the turnaround, but marginally in holiday-thinned conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-1.6%) and Brent (-1.3%) resumed their decline amid the downbeat sentiment across the market, with some traders also attributing the recent fall to technical factors amid thin liquidity in the complex. Elsewhere, gold (+0.2%) is outperforming given the softer USD and safe-haven demand, while copper (-0.8%) underperforms amid the sour risk tone fused with concerns over global economic growth slowdown. Finally, China&rsquo;s steel sector is flirting with the on the fence between a bear market, with prices declining almost 20% in the last three months as record production meets concerns of slower global growth and trade disputes.</p>\r\n",

Nothing really new in terms of NZ or Aussie specific catalysts for the relatively sharp retreats from recent highs, although ANZ predicted a 20% slump in property prices in Melbourne and Sydney overnight, but as usual the high-beta commodity currencies are more responsive to swings in overall sentiment and aversion is rearing its head again after faint respite ahead of the US Thanksgiving break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CHF/GBP/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback in thin US holiday trade, with the single currency remaining close to the 1.1400 handle and its 100 HMA (1.1404) amidst more token or half-hearted murmurings from Rome about 2019 budget in an effort to appease the EU and avoid punitive deficit measures, which are hampering upside attempts along with decent option expiry interest (1.1 bn between 1.1430-40). Usd/Jpy is pivoting 113.00 on the aforementioned resumption of risk-off positioning/flows, which is also supporting the Franc to a degree within a 0.9930-50 range. Elsewhere, Cable has rebounded firmly over 1.2800, through 1.2850 and just shy of 1.2900+ resistance, while Eur/Gbp is back below 0.8900 and eyeing 0.8850 bids/support following reports that EU and UK negotiators have now reached an accord on the political declaration for post-Brexit relations. Meanwhile, the Loonie is holding up relatively well against the backdrop of retreating crude prices ahead of a speech from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scandi crowns are not immune from the loss of risk appetite and downturn in oil, with Eur/Nok up above 9.7500 and Eur/Sek touching 10.3300 after Riksbank commentary courtesy of Skingsley downplaying minor deviations and fluctuations in the rate of inflation, but keeping policy intentions under wraps awaiting more data before the December meeting (including and pivotally the next Swedish CPI report on December 12th).</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, Italian BTPs are meandering between 121.85-42 vs their previous 121.45 settlement price amidst completely mixed messages, at least according to latest press reports, from Government officials over potential adjustments to the 2019 budget after official EU condemnation on Wednesday.

ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) traded positive with Australia led by healthcare as Primary Health Care shares outperformed following encouraging updates at its AGM, while sentiment in Japan was turbulent ahead of its long weekend and as financials lagged including MUFG shares on news US prosecutors are investigating the Japanese banking powerhouse. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) failed to hold onto opening gains as the PBoC remained side-lined and refrained from liquidity operations for a 20th consecutive occasion, although downside was stemmed amid trade related hopes after reports US Trade Advisor and known &lsquo;China hawk&rsquo; Navarro is to be excluded from the Trump-Xi summit. Finally, 10yr JGBs were quiet with price action subdued by the choppy risk sentiment and after weaker demand at today&rsquo;s enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated JGBs.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equities are mixed as the region struggles to sustain the rebound seen on Wall St, where a recovery in the energy and tech sectors underpinned most major US indices but which subsequently closed off their highs on position squaring heading into Thanksgiving. ASX 200 (+0.6%) is higher with healthcare front running the advances in Australia as Primary Health Care shares outperform following encouraging updates at its AGM, while the Nikkei 225 (Unch) shrugged off early advances and traded flat with weakness seen in financials including MUFG on news US prosecutors are investigating the Japanese banking powerhouse. Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) failed to hold onto opening gains as the PBoC remained side-lined and refrained from liquidity operations for a 20th consecutive occasion, but with downside stemmed amid trade related hopes after reports US Trade Advisor and known &lsquo;China hawk&rsquo; Navarro is to be excluded from the Trump-Xi summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are quiet with the USD subdued as US participants head into the Thanksgiving holiday season and with the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts EUR/USD and GBP/USD attempting to nurse recent losses. In terms of the latest Brexit-related developments, EU&#39;s Juncker and UK PM May failed to finalise a deal on terms of Brexit but were said to have made very good progress and PM May will return to Brussels on Saturday, while negotiators were said to work through the night in the hope of finalising an agreement. Elsewhere, AUD/USD and NZD/USD are lacklustre as the rebound in oil prices stalls overnight, while USD/JPY and its related-crosses are indecisive amid a similar risk tone and inconclusive inflation data in which all components conformed to expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are quiet with price action restricted by the choppy risk sentiment and ahead of an enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated JGBs.</p>\r\n",
