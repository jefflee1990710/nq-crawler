The decision on YCC was made by 8-1 vote with Kataoka the dissenter again, while the bank maintained all its median forecasts for Real GDP and Core CPI in its Outlook Report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the meeting, the BoJ commented that inflation is likely to continue increasing to 2% target, but risks to prices tilted to the downside and that it viewed Japan&rsquo;s economy to expand moderately, while it also extended the deadline for loan program by 1yr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the market reaction, USD/JPY saw minor weakeness on the announcement amid disappointment as expectations of an upgrade to growth forecasts failed to materialize, and as markets focused on a slight tweak in the language in which the BoJ stated inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged vs. Prev. statement that inflation expectations were weakening.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Consumer Confidence (Jan) 125.4 vs. Exp. 123.1 (Prev. 122.1, Rev. 123.1).

Additionally, analysts were noting that the recent quick rise in yields may not be playing a role in the equity weakness see over the last couple of days. There were also stock specific stories for traders to sink their teeth into: the healthcare sector was slammed after Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan announced a venture aimed at reducing healthcare costs. Insurer MetLife took a hit from the healthcare news, but was hammered after it said it was placed under an SEC investigation to pay pensions to around 600k customers. The company also said its reserves were not as large as analysts had expected, and would raise those reserves by circa 550mln USD. In earnings, Pfizer fell after its earnings, as did Harley Davidson. Meanwhile, in tech, continued fears that Apple would cut iPhoneX production &ndash; possibly due to its staggering price which CNBC says has scared buyers &ndash; pressured the company&rsquo;s shares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREASURIES: US T-Note futures settle 5+ ticks lower at 121.20+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bear-steepening was again the theme on Tuesday, with shorter-dated yields flattish, while longer-yields were around 4-5bps higher. All major curves were wider, with 2s30s up by circa 5bps, 5s30s circa 2bps higher, and 2s10s around 3bps steeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some traders expect the FOMC to hawkishly tweak its language at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday (preview below), to prepare markets for a rate hike. CME Fedwatch indicates there is only a 5% probability of a hike at this week&rsquo;s meeting, and a 60% chance of three hikes in 2018 (as the Fed has forecast).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PREVIEW: US Treasury will publish its Quarterly Refunding announcement (Q1 2018) at 1330 GMT/0830 ET on Weds 31 Jan 2018. Barclays estimates that the Treasury will raise the 3-year note issue size by $1bln (to $25bln), and keep the 10-year note and 30-year bond issue sizes unchanged (at $23bln and $15bln respectively). Analysts believe that the Treasury will announce increasing issuance sizes in the coming months, after the debt ceiling negotiations have been completed. &ldquo;We expect the Treasury to convey that increases in auction sizes will be skewed toward the front to intermediate sector,&rdquo; Barclays writes, and expects the Treasury to initially focus on 2-year, 2-year FRN, 3-year, and 5-year tenors but at a later date, while raising the 7-year+ issuance sizes as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Knot said that it&rsquo;s reasonable to end QE in September, and that he could accept a slow taper. He also suggested that price stability is not at risk and that normalisation is justified.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Trade Minister Fox said that he won&#39;t accept EU deal that keeps the UK in the customs union. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Governor Carney said that wages are picking up, but they are not growing spectacularly. He expects investment in the UK to pick up in 2019 and stressed that the important thing with monetary policy is that as slack in UK&#39;s economy is removed, focus is increasingly on returning inflation to target. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Tenreyro said that we have no reason to think that a no deal Brexit scenario will materialise, would prefer a Norway style deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Vlieghe has been re-appointed to the MPC by government. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX FOREX: DXY trades 0.10% lower heading into APAC trade</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD trade was choppy on Tuesday; month-end models were said to point towards selling of the buck, but towards the end of the day, and ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s FOMC meeting (preview below), the buck began paring back some of the losses seen overnight and through European trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts are pointing out, however, that the general narrative of a weaker dollar in 2018 hasn&rsquo;t shifted very much, and this sentiment will likely get an endorsement from Trump&rsquo;s State of the Union address overnight (see below for preview).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR continues to linger around the 1.24 mark, and will likely take its cue from tomorrow&rsquo;s Eurozone inflation data, and then in the evening, the FOMC. The EUR did see highs around 1.2450 after news agencies reported positive developments in the coalition talks between the CDU and SPD regarding refugees. Later in the day, the currency looked through a repeat of the hawkish comments ECB&rsquo;s Knot made over the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although analysts have suggested Sterling is a sell-on-rallies, GBP found strength against the USD in month-end dollar selling, and has made its way towards 1.4150 heading into the APAC session (rebounding from beneath the 1.40 level printed overnight), and rose towards .8850 against the EUR. Comments from BOE&rsquo;s Carney (below) revealed little by way of new information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Havens were generally bid in overnight Asia trade, inspired by a risk-off tone overnight, and stayed that way in European and US trade. Gold, however, couldn&rsquo;t rally amid the early USD weakness, likely on the back of rising Treasury yields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD trades flat for the second day ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s GDP data for November (0.4% M/M rise pencilled in) and producer prices data for December (seen slipping 0.1% M/M). The Loonie was more resilient to soft crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian CPI data overnight is in focus, and the AUD is lower against other G10 majors heading into APAC trade. The Street looks for a small rise in the Q/Q and Y/Y metrics (from 1.8% to 2.0% Y/Y and 0.7% and 0.6% Q/Q).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk504673747\">COMMODITIES: WTI futures settle $1.06 lower at $64.50 per barrel; Brent futures settle 44c lower at $69.02</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (22 Jan, w/e) 3.229M vs. Exp. 0.100M (Prev. 4.755M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much by way of fundamental newsflow in the crude space, with oil taking its cue from the macro tone, which was distinctly &ldquo;risk-off.&rdquo; Although crude is in the red for the second day, they have put in a run of five consecutive monthly gains. Prices were then further pressured in late trade after the release of the API inventory report which showed a larger than expected build in headline crude stockpiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research from WoodMac was receiving some attention, with the consultancy predicting that the Brent/WTI arb will average $3.90 in 2018, the widest in four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of this evenings API energy inventory data, and tomorrow&rsquo;s DOE data, analysts expect a small build in crude stocks, the first build in 11 weeks; headline crude stocks are seen rising by 100k barrels, distillates are expected to drawdown by 1.5mln barrels, gasoline is seen building by 1.8mln barrels. Genscape was said to have forecast Cushing stocks will draw by 2.6mln barrels in the latest week.</p>\r\n",

Additionally, analysts were noting that the recent quick rise in yields may not be playing a role in the equity weakness see over the last couple of days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there were stock specific stories for traders to sink their teeth into: the healthcare sector was slammed after Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan announced a venture aimed at reducing healthcare costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurer MetLife took a hit from the healthcare news, but was hammered after it said it was placed under an SEC investigation to pay pensions to around 600k customers. The company also said its reserves were not as large as analysts had expected, and would raise those reserves by circa 550mln USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In earnings, Pfizer fell after its earnings, as did Harley Davidson. Meanwhile, in tech, continued fears that Apple would cut iPhoneX production &ndash; possibly due to its staggering price which CNBC says has scared buyers &ndash; pressured the companies shares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After-market earnings highlights include AMD, Chubb and EA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Note futures settle 5+ ticks lower at 121.20+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bear-steepening was again the theme on Tuesday, with shorter-dated yields flattish, while longer-yields were around 4-5bps higher. All major curves were wider, with 2s30s up by circa 5bps, 5s30s circa 2bps higher, and 2s10s around 3bps steeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some traders expect the FOMC to hawkishly tweak its language at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday (preview below), to prepare markets for a rate hike. CME Fedwatch indicates there is only a 5% probability of a hike at this week&rsquo;s meeting, and a 60% chance of three hikes in 2018 (as the Fed has forecast).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PREVIEW: US Treasury will publish its Quarterly Refunding announcement (Q1 2018) at 1330 GMT/0830 ET on Weds 31 Jan 2018.<strong> </strong>Barclays estimates that the Treasury will raise the 3-year note issue size by $1bln (to $25bln), and keep the 10-year note and 30-year bond issue sizes unchanged (at $23bln and $15bln respectively). Analysts believe that the Treasury will announce increasing issuance sizes in the coming months, after the debt ceiling negotiations have been completed. &ldquo;We expect the Treasury to convey that increases in auction sizes will be skewed toward the front to intermediate sector,&rdquo; Barclays writes, and expects the Treasury to initially focus on 2-year, 2-year FRN, 3-year, and 5-year tenors but at a later date, while raising the 7-year+ issuance sizes as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY trades 0.10% lower heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD trade was choppy on Tuesday; month-end models were said to point towards selling of the buck, but towards the end of the day, and ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s FOMC meeting (preview below), the buck began paring back some of the losses seen overnight and through European trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts are pointing out, however, that the general narrative of a weaker dollar in 2018 hasn&rsquo;t shifted very much, and this sentiment will likely get an endorsement from Trump&rsquo;s State of the Union address overnight (see below for preview).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR continues to linger around the 1.24 mark, and will likely take its cue from tomorrow&rsquo;s Eurozone inflation data, and then in the evening, the FOMC. The EUR did see highs around 1.2450 after news agencies reported positive developments in the coalition talks between the CDU and SPD regarding refugees. Later in the day, the currency looked through a repeat of the hawkish comments ECB&rsquo;s Knot made over the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although analysts have suggested Sterling is a sell-on-rallies, GBP found strength against the USD in month-end dollar selling, and has made its way towards 1.4150 heading into the APAC session (rebounding from beneath the 1.40 level printed overnight), and rose towards .8850 against the EUR. Comments from BOE&rsquo;s Carney (below) revealed little by way of new information. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Havens were generally bid in overnight Asia trade, inspired by a risk-off tone overnight, and stayed that way in European and US trade. Gold, however, couldn&rsquo;t rally amid the early USD weakness, likely on the back of rising Treasury yields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD trades flat for the second day ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s GDP data for November (0.4% M/M rise pencilled in) and producer prices data for December (seen slipping 0.1% M/M). The Loonie was more resilient to soft crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian CPI data overnight is in focus, and the AUD is lower against other G10 majors heading into APAC trade. The Street looks for a small rise in the Q/Q and Y/Y metrics (from 1.8% to 2.0% Y/Y and 0.7% and 0.6% Q/Q).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES: WTI futures settle $1.06 lower at $64.50 per barrel; Brent futures settle 44c lower at $69.02</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much by way of fundamental newsflow in the crude space, with oil taking its cue from the macro tone, which was distinctly &ldquo;risk-off.&rdquo; Although crude is in the red for the second day, they have put in a run of five consecutive monthly gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research from WoodMac was receiving some attention, with the consultancy predicting that the Brent/WTI arb will average $3.90 in 2018, the widest in four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of this evenings API energy inventory data, and tomorrow&rsquo;s DOE data, analysts expect a small build in crude stocks, the first build in 11 weeks; headline crude stocks are seen rising by 100k barrels, distillates are expected to drawdown by 1.5mln barrels, gasoline is seen building by 1.8mln barrels. Genscape was said to have forecast Cushing stocks will draw by 2.6mln barrels in the latest week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANK SPEAK: BOE&rsquo;s Carney, ECB&rsquo;s Knot </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Governor Carney, speaking to the House of Lords economic affairs committee, said that wages in the UK are picking up, but they are not growing spectacularly. He expects investment in the UK to pick up in 2019. On monetary policy, he said that the important thing with was that as slack in the economy is eroded, the focus increasingly returns to the inflation target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Knot reiterated his hawkish comments, saying it is reasonable for the ECB to end its QE programme after September, but he could accept a short tapering period after September. &nbsp;Knot expressed confidence that inflation will rise to target in the medium term, and believes that price stability is not at risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann and Mersch also spoke, but said little regarding ECB monetary policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PREVIEW: US President Trump will deliver his first State of Union address at 2100 ET/0200 GMT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s first State of the Union address to Congress unlikely of much of surprise for markets. &nbsp;Trader&#39;s primary will be on the US infrastructure plan; the Financial Times reports that the Trump administration will invest USD 1trln, whereas Reuters has reported that the plan will initially be USD 200bln, though will probably end up rising to USD 1.7trln, with firm details expected in February. Immigration issues will also be in focus, with the US President expected to push for its proposal of granting the US citizenship to the 1.8mln &lsquo;dreamers&rsquo;. This would come in exchange for Democrats to support Trump&rsquo;s own plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border &ndash; which is a key factor in the negotiations between the Republicans and Democrats on the funding bill, which is due to expire the 8th February. Trump is expected to highlight his economic accomplishments and set out his 2018 policy agenda, ahead of the midterms elections in November. Some, therefore, believe that he will strike a more &lsquo;campaigning&rsquo; tone in his speech, rather than the conciliatory diplomatic tone he struck at Davos. &nbsp;During the speech, the USD remains on the look-out for comments on US trade action and on any relating remarks regarding the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un over missiles threats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PREVIEW: FOMC January Meeting</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A large majority of analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged at 1.25%-1.50%. Focus on language in the statement regarding the inflation outlook. FOMC voting rotation means voters are likely to be more hawkish.

This would come in exchange for Democrats to support Trump&rsquo;s own plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border &ndash; which is a key factor in the negotiations between the Republicans and Democrats on the funding bill, which is due to expire the 8th February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-&nbsp;Trump is expected to highlight his economic accomplishments and set out his 2018 policy agenda, ahead of the midterms elections in November. Some, therefore, believe that he will strike a more &lsquo;campaigning&rsquo; tone in his speech, rather than the conciliatory diplomatic tone he struck at Davos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-&nbsp;During the speech, the USD remains on the look-out for comments on US trade action and on any relating remarks regarding the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un over missiles threats.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The broad Dollar is ending a topsy-turvy session under renewed pressure with at least 3 major banks calling for end of January rebalancing sales of the US unit. The DXY has reversed sharply from early 89.600+ peaks to sub-89.000 levels again, with individual G10 pairings eyeing key chart levels and/or recent highs/lows vs the Greenback. The Chf and Jpy extended safe-haven gains vs the Usd (having outperformed for the most part) to trade close to big figure support at 0.9300 (and the 0.9290 ytd base) and just below 108.50 vs 109.20 overnight (amidst some Japanese data misses) with the 108.25-30 lows of 2018 so far not far away. Eur/Usd and Cable both bounced 100+ pips from their worst levels to around 1.2450 and 1.4150 respectively at best, as the Eur/Gbp cross pivoted 0.8800 amidst more UK-EU Brexit verbal banter. Usd/Cad tested the water near 1.2300 despite mixed NAFTA messages (some progress, but still big divisions) and a further retreat in crude. Aud/Usd fell just shy of the 0.8100 handle amidst the Dollar&rsquo;s &lsquo;turnaround Tuesday&rsquo;, but will draw independent impetus from Aussie inflation data alongside the US specific events ahead. However, the Kiwi continued to lag (Nzd/Usd below 0.7350) after only a fleeting lift from better than expected trade data and internal import/export tallies. Cross flows and IMM spec positioning said to be hampering the Nzd, but also last week&rsquo;s below forecast Q$ CPI report. Trump up next, and volatility rising in the currency, stock and bond markets.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>We expect the Japanese economy to sustain its trajectory of above-potential growth in 2018, driven by strong exports and a capex recovery backed by elevated corporate earnings. Contrary to such Goldilocks economic conditions (with a gradually improving output gap), we expect tepid CPI inflation of around +1% y/y due in part to structural factors in wage setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, we expect the government to declare an end to deflation around midyear with the 2018 &ldquo;shunto&rdquo; spring wage negotiations expected to yield larger hikes again prior to a string of major political and policy events. We believe such a declaration could increase the BoJ&rsquo;s flexibility in managing monetary policy by changing the political dynamics that have influenced it to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We expect the BoJ to take its first step toward normalization through a revision to its yield curve controls (shortening the targeted sector) in Q3, assuming core CPI inflation accelerates to around +1% y/y at that time. We also believe stealth tapering of QE will continue, sustaining the shift from &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; to &ldquo;rates&rdquo; and, within YCC, from the longterm to the short-term sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe Japanese share prices will continue to trend higher on support from fundamentals (recovery in corporate earnings with higher profits on higher sales), supply and demand (correction of underweighting by overseas investors) and cheap valuations. In the event of a full-fledged breakaway from deflation, we believe currently undervalued real estate and banking sectors could correct. The biggest game changer for Japanese equities could be the trend in the abundant liquidity held by Japanese corporations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look for the JGB market to be driven by expectations around BoJ normalization in 2018. As noted above, we forecast that the BoJ will begin to revise its YCC framework in Q3 by shortening the sector targeted for yield control to the 5y from the 10y. In H2 18, we believe yields are likely to come under upward pressure with the 10-20y sectors underperforming on the curve. In the FX space, we expect USDJPY to range-trade around 110-115 in H1 18 as the US economy moves along the recovery path on support from tax cuts. In H2, however, we look for downward pressures to strengthen with broad-based USD depreciation and the start of normalization by the BoJ, taking the USDJPY to 105 by year-end.</p>\r\n",

Solid Eurozone data and survey-based indicators may have propped the Eur more than any drag from softer on balance German state CPIs, while progress on a key issue from the German coalition talks could have outweighed impending strike action. Tech-wise, overnight lows holding in ahead of a key 1.2306 Fib may also have prompted a bounce, while some participants possibly viewed the earlier dip as an ideal opportunity to sell Usds for the touted month end rebalancing. Probably a mixture of all the above, with Cable seeing an approx big figure turnaround from sub-1.4000 lows. Usd/Jpy retesting 108.50 support, Usd/Chf the 0.9325 area and Usd/Cad bids just ahead of 1.2300. Aud/Usd almost back up to 0.8100, and some traders could also be wary about comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin later following his softer Greenback good for trade, but stronger policy still favoured confusing message at Davos.</p>\r\n",

Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as Japanese yields played catch up to their US counterparts in which the US 10yr yield rose above 2.7% to its highest since April 2014, while firmer demand for the 2yr JGB auction only briefly provided relief as the Japanese 10yr yield then continued to rise to above 0.09%, which was the highest since July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations again today for a daily net drain of CNY 240bln.

Gilts continue to lag with only a fractional extension of the Liffe session high to 122.65, but no adverse reaction to BoE data revealing a sharp slowdown in foreign buying of UK debt in December from the previous month. US Treasuries have climbed a few ticks above par, with the 10 year yield back below 2.70% and favourable month end portfolio/balance sheet requirements could well be impacting before attention turns to less supportive impulses like Trump&rsquo;s keynote speech, quarterly refunding and the FOMC.</p>\r\n",

Indeed, the DXY has now climbed above 89.500 on widespread gains vs its G10 rivals, bar the traditional safe-havens (Jpy and Chf) as Wall Street indices retrace&nbsp;further from record peaks and global equity peers follow suit. Eur/Usd briefly retested overnight lows around 1.2337 on a weak inflation read from German state Saxony, but very mixed data from others ahead of heavyweight NRW prompted a marked rebound towards 1.2400. Similarly, Cable lost the 1.4000 handle with stops triggered on a break to 1.3980, but has recovered to trade around 1.4030 in choppy price action. Aud/Usd mid-range between 0.8040-0.8100 and undermined by ongoing weakness in metals/commodities, while Nzd/Usd has retreated further towards 0.7300 despite decent NZ trade data as CFTC shorts continue to pare positions. Usd/Cad nudging higher again between 1.2330-1.2380 as some positive NAFTA discussions are offset by another downturn in oil prices. Ahead, US President Trump&rsquo;s State of the Union address kicks off a busy line up of risk events, with the FOMC concluding its 2-day meeting on the last trading day of January and NFP looming on Friday. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Major curve spreads were also wider at settlement (2s5s +c.2bps, 2s10s +c.3bps, 2s30s +c3bps). Traders are expecting the US Treasury&rsquo;s quarterly funding announcement on Wednesday to see UST issuance raised. Additionally, some are also expecting the FOMC to hawkishly tweak its language at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday, to prepare markets for a rate hike. CME Fedwatch indicates there is only a 4.1% probability of a hike at this week&rsquo;s meeting, and a 60% chance of three hikes in 2018 (as the Fed has forecast).

        "content": "<p>Asia markets traded lower across the board as the selling in US equity futures and retreat from record highs gathered pace overnight. ASX 200 (-0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.5%) were both negative with Australia led lower by weakness across commodity-related sectors, while Japanese participants digested earnings and a slew of data including a contraction in Household Spending, as well as higher Unemployment. Furthermore, selling then accelerated in late trade amid a slump in US equity futures, in which DJIA futures fell over 200 points after a breakdown of near-term support at 26,400. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) conformed to the losses after continued PBoC inaction which resulted to a daily net drain of CNY 240bln and amid reports that banks were ordered to curb overnight lending, while tech names and Apple suppliers in the region were also mostly downbeat after the tech giant was said to reduce Q1 iPhone X orders by 50% due to slower than expected sales. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as Japanese yields played catch up to their US counterparts in which the US 10yr yield rose above 2.7% to its highest since April 2014, while firmer demand for the 2yr JGB auction only briefly provided relief as the Japanese 10yr yield then continued to rise to above 0.09%, which was the highest since July.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac markets trade mostly lower as the subdued tone in US where the major indices retreated from record levels amid rising yields and energy underperformance, rolled over to the region. As such, ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) are both negative with Australia led lower by weakness across commodity-related sectors, while Japanese participants digest earnings and a slew of data including a contraction in Household Spending, as well as higher Unemployment. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are cautious after continued PBoC inaction which resulted to a daily net drain of CNY 240bln and amid reports that banks were ordered to curb overnight lending, while tech names and Apple suppliers in the region were also mostly pressured. This was after the tech giant was said to reduce Q1 iPhone X orders by 50% due to slower than expected sales, although Pegatron bucked the trend following&nbsp;reports it received orders for iPhone LCDs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD attempts to resume gains against its major counterparts with USD/JPY reclaiming the 109.00 handle and with GBP/USD below 1.4050. However, the moves in the greenback are relatively light amid slight fatigue following the prior day&rsquo;s advances, which were supported by rising yields and expectations for a hawkish language tweak at this week&rsquo;s FOMC. Elsewhere, NZD saw initial support after better than expected Trade Data and JPY was briefly underpinned by safe-haven flows, although this was later outweighed by the broad USD strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as Japanese yields play catch up to their US counterparts in which the US 10yr yield rose above 2.7% to its highest since April 2014, while participants also look ahead to a 2yr JGB auction later.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
