The market had expected a cut between 1mln and 1.4mln, and as such, this is in the middle of consensus views, but short of the 1.3mln BPD cut that was recommended by OPEC&#39;s economic committee last week. The new oil cut deal will last for a period of six months, starting in January, and will be reviewed in April 2019. Later, the Russian energy minister said that the deal could be amended based on market conditions. Delegates were reticent to provide a detailed breakdown of the magnitude of cuts per country, though Russia has indicated it will cut 228k BPD (Saudis were said to be pushing for 300k on Thursday). Although it wasn&#39;t in the official statement, three countries have been granted exemptions (Venezuela, Iran, Libya).
