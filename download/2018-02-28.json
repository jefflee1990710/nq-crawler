JPY, however, wasn&#39;t dancing to the USD&#39;s tune, and backed-off the key 107 level, while EURJPY breached the key 131.00 level to the downside. USD strength and sentiment souring over Brexit hit sterling. The key 1.3860 level that acted as support overnight in GBP/USD gave way in European trade after European policymakers said there was no guarantee that a Brexit transition period will be agreed, which saw the pair retreat throughout the session to firmly below 1.3800.</a><br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude saw the first down month since August 2017, as concerns about rising US production and inventories edges-out optimistic OPEC jawboning and arguments of strong global demand being able to outpace US supply. This week&#39;s energy data is a case in point, while sharply weaker Chinese PMIs overnight demands caution around the assumption of firm global growth continuing indefinitely (softer economic surprise indices have also been hinting at this, recently). WTI sold-off after the weekly DOE energy data, with WTI falling beneath $63 towards the $62.50 mark, continuing to slide in the aftermath of the release to back below the $62.00 handle</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks (w/e) 3.019M vs. Exp. 2.077M (Prev. -1.616M). (Newswires)<br />US crude production up 0.13% to 10.283mln bpd</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EIA said US crude oil production fell 108k BPD in December to 9.949mln BPD (vs. revised 10.057mln BPD in November). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major US bourses print a second day of losses, and after the position-related adjustment in the early part of the month, the SPX is on course to see its largest monthly decline since January 2016. US shares opened on the front foot after reasonably good GDP data, but couldn&rsquo;t hang on to gains. Energy was the laggard, tracking weakness in crude prices, although consumer sectors fared better after decent numbers from retail names. Lower bond yields have offered support to equities in recent weeks, though that wasn&rsquo;t the case on Wednesday, especially since the VIX ticked higher towards the 20-handle. In late trade, the SPX breached the key 50dma around 2736, which then opened the door lower to beneath 2720 as we headed into the close. SPX -1.05%, DJI -1.51%, NDX -0.67%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the US dollar has held onto gains made in wake of Fed chair Powell&#39;s hawkish testimony, Treasuries saw yields narrow, as the curve bull-flattened. Short-end Treasury yields, however, did touch fresh cycle highs in the day, with yields on 2s hitting 2.2862%. But with that said, at settlement, major curves were still narrower: 2s10s -1.7bps, 2s30s -2.2bps, 5s30s 1.7bps (to 48bps).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>MACRO: Stocks up, bonds up, USD up, crude down, gold down</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>STOCKS: SPX -1.05%, DJI -1.51%, NDX -0.67%</strong><br />* Major US bourses print a second day of losses, and after the position-related adjustment in the early part of the month, the SPX is on course to see its largest monthly decline since January 2016. US shares opened on the front foot after reasonably good GDP data, but couldn&rsquo;t hang on to gains. Energy was the laggard, tracking weakness in crude prices, although consumer sectors fared better after decent numbers from retail names. Lower bond yields have offered support to equities in recent weeks, though that wasn&rsquo;t the case on Wednesday, especially since the VIX ticked higher towards the 20-handle. In late trade, the SPX breached the key 50dma around 2736, which then opened the door lower to beneath 2720 as we headed into the close.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SECTORS: &nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>* ENERGY -2.15%: </strong>tracked crude weakness lower. Refiners ANDV was underperforming after DOE and API yesterday reported a net product build. CHK sank after Oklahoma toughened its fracking rules.&nbsp;<br /><strong>* MATERIALS -1.62%: </strong>ALB weighed after Q4 loss.<br /><strong>* INDUSTRIALS -1.34%: </strong>Activist investor Pershing Square said to have taken position in UTX.<br /><strong>* CONS DISC -0.34%: </strong>LOW earnings miss, sales beat; TJX same-store sales beat sends shares to record high), also lifting M; DISCK hit after disappointing guidance.&nbsp;<br /><strong>* CONS STAP -0.91%: </strong>earnings MNST (amc)<br /><strong>* HEALTH -1.48%: </strong>earnings MYL (bmo); CELG sharp losses after approval denied for a MS drug.<br /><strong>* FINANCIALS -1.16%:&nbsp;<br />* IT -0.57%: </strong>earnings ADI (bmo); CRM (amc).<br /><strong>* TELECOMS </strong>-1.11%: TMUS weighing a &lsquo;very large&rsquo; buyback, CEO says.&nbsp;<br /><strong>* UTILITIES -0.57%:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME: US T-Note future settled 8+ ticks higher at 120-21.</strong><br />* Although the US dollar has held onto gains made in wake of Fed chair Powell&#39;s hawkish testimony, Treasuries saw yields narrow, as the curve bull-flattened. Short-end Treasury yields, however, did touch fresh cycle highs in the day, with yields on 2s hitting 2.2862%. But with that said, at settlement, major curves were still narrower: 2s10s -1.7bps, 2s30s -2.2bps, 5s30s 1.7bps (to 48bps).&nbsp;<br />* Treasuries bull-flattened: 2s -0.8bps at 2.258%, 5s -1.9bps at 2.6502%, 10s -4bps at 2.8679%, 30s -4.7bps 3.1275%.<br />* Germany&#39;s sale of 3bln of 10yr notes saw weak demand, covered 1.2x vs 1.5x.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle $1.37 lower at $61.64 per barrel; Brent futures settle $0.85 lower at $65.78 per barrel.</strong><br />* Crude sees the first down month since August 2017, as concerns about rising US production and inventories edges-out optimistic OPEC jawboning and arguments of strong global demand being able to outpace US supply. This week&#39;s energy data is a case in point, while sharply weaker Chinese PMIs overnight demands caution around the assumption of firm global growth continuing indefinitely (softer economic surprise indices have also been hinting at this, recently). WTI sold-off after the weekly DOE energy data, with WTI falling beneath $63 towards the $62.50 mark, continuing to slide in the aftermath of the release to back below the $62.00 handle.&nbsp;<br />* US EIA weekly inventories: Crude +3.019mln (exp +2.7mln, API +0.9mln), Cushing -1.218mln (exp -0.88mln, API -1.3mln), Gasoline +2.483mln (exp -0.6mln, API +1.9mln), Distillates -0.96mln (exp -0.7mln, API -1.4mln); US production +0.13% to 10.283mln BPD, a new record high.<br />* Some desks were warning that the crude price bias is to the downside through the end of Q1, absent a supply disruption.&nbsp;<br />* EIA says US crude oil production fell 108k BPD in December, to 9.949mln BPD (vs revised 10.057mln BPD in November)<br />* Russian oil output stands at 10.95mln BPD (1 Feb to 27 Feb), sources report.<br />* Angola lowers April crude oil exports to 1.47mln BPD on 46 cargoes (initially was seen around 1.51mln), and state oil company Sonangol estimates 2018 oil production around 1.6mln BPD.&nbsp;<br />* Loadings of Forties crude oil were said to have slowed at the Hound Port terminal, as bad weather prevented pilot access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>XAU:</strong><br />* After skidding below its 20dma ($1332) in on Tuesday following Fed chair Powell&#39;s hawkish testimony, the yellow metal traded in an approximate range between $1316/18 on the downside and $1332 on the upside.&nbsp;<br />* Some desks were noting little appetite to buy dips aggressively, but the mood was said to not be entirely bearish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD:&nbsp;</strong><br />* DXY extended gains printed in wake of Tuesday&#39;s hawkish testimony by Fed chair Powell, assisted by month-end buying (models pointed towards strong USD buying into month-end, and in afternoon trade, the DXY was bought aggressively, with the price action pushing EUR to beneath 1.22, Cable beneath 1.38, and CAD to fresh YTD highs above 1.28. JPY, however, wasn&#39;t dancing to the USD&#39;s tune, and backed-off the key 107 level, while EURJPY breached the key 131.00 level to the downside, likely as the overnight narrative was JPY-positive (see JPY below).<br />* Some analysts were arguing that, as the market reprices the Fed hike trajectory, USD should remain supported in the short-term. However, others warn that if four hikes is not signalled at the March FOMC, USD could find fresh 2018 lows.<br />* US Q4 GDP 2nd Estimate 2.5% (exp 2.5%) vs 2.6%; PCE prices prelim 2.7% (exp 2.8%) vs 2.8%; core PCE prices prelim 1.9% (exp 1.9%) vs 1.9%; Headline revised on slightly weaker growth in business investment and inventories. However, consumer spending was unrevised at 3.8%. Analysts were generally of the view that the US economy ended 2017 in good shape.&nbsp;<br />* Jan pending home sales fell -4.7% mm (exp 0.4%) vs 0.5%; Higher mortgage rates have weighed on home sales as of late. This month&rsquo;s data was likely hit by colder weather conditions, as well as low inventory of homes for sale. Some suggest a bounce-back is on the card next month, as weather improves.&nbsp;<br />* Fed&#39;s Kashkari (non-voter, dove) says the lack of wage growth signals that slack remains in the labour market; wants to see evidence inflation is rising<br />* US Feb Chicago PMI, exp 64.2 vs 65.7.<br />* US releases 2018 Trade Policy Agenda, says it will use all tools, including unilateral action, on trade issues; US says it is free to respond to unfair China trade policies.<br />* Special Counsel Mueller said to be investigating whether US President Trump was aware of the DNC hack</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP:&nbsp;</strong><br />* USD strength, and sentiment souring over Brexit hit sterling. The key 1.3860 level that acted as support overnight amid USD strength gave way in European trade, after European policymakers said there was no guarantee that a Brexit transition period will be agreed. The draft also seeks to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union (UK officials have already said they will reject this), and additionally, the stated UK single market access can be suspended during any transition period, sending GBP to support at 1.3820.<br />* In the afternoon, USD strength pushed cable beneath 1.38 towards 1.3775; technicians are now focussing on 1.3750, a key fib level. EURGBP, meanwhile, trades around 0.8850, up by around 0.75%.<br />* UK Conservative rebellion on Customs Union grows to 10 lawmakers, according to reports, and a conservative MP was quoted as saying a &quot;large majority&quot; of Parliament now favours a soft Brexit.&nbsp;<br />* UK Feb BRC shop price index -0.8% yy (exp -0.6%) vs -0.5%.<br />* UK Feb GfK Consumer Confidence -10 (exp -10) vs -9.<br />* REC data showed confidence in hiring and investment decisions has fallen to the lowest since the Brexit referendum in mid-2016.<br />* UK govt official (tues) said PM May will not agree to ECJ as an arbiter of exit deal.<br />* This week: PM May Brexit speech on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY:&nbsp;</strong><br />* Action has been contained within the 106-50 to 107.50 area, with yen knocking around the bottom-end of that range heading into APAC trade.&nbsp;<br />* EURJPY was talked-about as a short near 132.00 by some desks in the morning, and a EUR weakness alongside the JPY strength saw the pair drop to lows just above 130.00.<br />* Early European trade, BOJ Gov Kuroda reiterated that BOJ easing is to achieve price target, easing will not continue if CPI is 2% in a stable manner, any normalization will take into account economic impact.<br />* Jan retail sales (overnight) -1.8% m/m (exp -0.6%). Hints private consumption may be sluggish in Q1, Fri&#39;s household spending data may give more insight.<br />* Jan industrial production (overnight) -6% m/m (sharpest since 2011 quake), slump suggests economic expansion may have paused at the start of Q1.<br />* BoJ Rinban (overnight): lowered purchases in 25yr+ maturities (to 70bln from 80bln), as some had expected; kept March JGB buying plans unchanged vs February, but removes reference to amount of expected T-Bill purchases.<br />* Desks warn that Rinban tweaks shouldn&#39;t be conflated with tightening, and as long as policy changes are telegraphed clearly and gradual, the yen will likely continue to depreciate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR:&nbsp;</strong><br />* The EUR managed to reclaim the 1.22 handle, after dropping beneath the level in the US afternoon amid a wave of month-end USD buying. The single currency has been largely taking its cues from the USD, and that was evidenced after flash Feb inflation data released in the European morning. Next week&#39;s ECB meeting remains the key focus, and analysts will be keeping an eye on whether the central bank adjusts its guidance.&nbsp;<br />* EZ Feb flash inflation 1.2% (exp 1.2%) vs 1.3%, core unch 1.2% yy (exp 1.1%) vs 1.2%. Headline temporarily constrained, while core rate really ought to have increased, Pantheon says, while CapEco notes slower inflation won&rsquo;t stop ECB from changing forward guidance next week.<br />* GE Feb unemployment 5.4% (unch as exp), change (SA) -22k (exp -17k) vs prev -25k</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF:&nbsp;</strong><br />* A narrow range on month-end, with EURCHF trading between 1.1486 to 1.1535, roughly in the middle of the range heading into APAC. Some note risk has traded weak, keeping a lid on EURCHF action; attention on 1.1560, seen as resistance above, while buying interest around 1.15 has been noted.&nbsp;<br />* Swiss Feb KOF indicator 108.0 (exp 106.1) vs 107.6 (rev up).<br />* Swiss Feb investor sentiment 25.8 vs 34.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD:</strong><br />* Weaker oil prices and a stronger USD seemed to be weighing on CAD, which rose to fresh YTD highs above 1.28. As the market reprices Fed hike trajectory, USD strength may in the short-term put pressure on commodities, and by-extension commodity FX, some desks warn. Attention is now being focussed on next week&#39;s BOC.&nbsp;<br />* CA Jan producer prices, 0.3% mm (exp +0.5%) mm vs -0.1%; 2% yy vs 2.3% (rev up).&nbsp;<br />* Fin min Morneau said reducing defecit now would lead to job losses, says Canada has budget room for all eventualities.<br />* Federal Budget (tues eve): No major new tax/spending measures in 2018, despite US corporate tax cuts + NAFTA concerns.<br />* Next week: BOC 7/Mar</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD:&nbsp;</strong><br />* The Aussie has been hit by a hawkish Fed chair, while weaker metals prices aren&#39;t helping. The 100dma ~0.7775 held for most of the session, though was breached as we approached APAC trade.<br />* Chatter that the Chinese clean-up of the copper scrap trade will boost prices from ~March, may support Aussie and other commodity FX.<br />* AU Jan private sector credit 0.3% mm (exp 0.4%) vs 0.3%; 4.9% yy (exp 5.0%) vs 4.8%. Data showed a low level of resi investment lending. Some banks say the slowdown in the overall aggregate credit data looks like a rate hike; &#39;regulators have engineered tighter financial conditions, meaning that the case for a hike is weak&#39;.&nbsp;<br />* 2230 AU Feb AIG mfg index&nbsp;<br />* This week: Capex data on Thurs. Next week: RBA, retail, trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD:&nbsp;</strong><br />* Sell-off after hawkish Powell break&#39;s upward trend line that has been in play since Dec, opening downside scenarios, technicians say. Consolidation around 0.7220 seemed to be the theme on Wednesday, though the currency did go as low as 0.7205 as APAC trade approached. &nbsp;<br />* Feb NBNZ Own Activity 20.4% vs 15.6%, business outlook -19.0% vs -37.8%; further modest recovery in biz conf, still well below pre-election levels. Inflation expectations down also, in line with the latest CPI reading.<br />* 2145 NZ Q4 Terms of trade (exp -0.2% qq) vs 0.7%; exports &amp; imports exp to rebound&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK:&nbsp;</strong><br />* The SEK has continued the theme of weakness on Wednesday, taking out the YTD to reach highs last seen in 2010.

        "content": "<p>The DXY remains &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; above the psychological 90.000 marker, but it remains to be seen whether a close above the next upside technical target area is achieved (90.500-600). The Greenback has cleared some big figure levels vs G10 counterparts, albeit largely due to weakness in the Eur, Gbp and Cad rather than in its own right, although favourable month end flows have been a persistent theme. Eur/Usd lost 1.2200, Cable 1.3800 and Usd/Cad scaled 1.2800 on a mixture of long liquidation, negative Brexit developments (EU and UK still poles apart on the big issues) and data in the form of weaker than forecast Canadian PPI. However, Usd/Jpy remains very rangebound around 107.00, and arguably in an even tighter concentric circle as more option expiries at the strike run off (some 10 bn in total spanning over the week). Aud/Usd also had option interest in size to consider (1.1 bn at 0.7800) and pivoted the big figure, while Nzd/Usd continues to slip towards 0.7200. In terms of chart and other meaningful levels, Eur/Usd is exposed to 1.2165 (2018 base so far) and Cable 1.3765 (February 9 range low). On that note, Eur/Sek overcame some resistance around yesterday&rsquo;s circa 10.0950 peak, but eventually climbed to another new multi-year high around 10.1365 after some Swedish data misses (Q4 GDP and January retail sales) and comments from the country&rsquo;s Finance Minister urging fiscal restraint.</p>\r\n",

The inaugural testimony by Fed Chair Powell provided a hawkish view on inflation and was also optimistic on economic growth, which raised the prospects of 4 hikes for this year and subsequently weighed on equity markets across the globe. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.7%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (-1.4%) were</strong> lower with the worst performers in Australia also dampened by poor earnings results, while Nikkei 225 suffered from a firmer JPY as well as weak Industrial Production and Retail Sales data. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-1.4%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%)</strong> were the early laggards with investor sentiment dragged following a miss on Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI data in which the former printed its weakest since September 2016, while aluminium names also felt the brunt after the US confirmed tariffs on aluminium foil imports from China. Finally, 10yr JGBs lacked demand despite the broad global risk-averse tone, as Japanese yields tracked the upside in their US counterparts and which also followed a reduction of the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban purchases in the super-long end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese NBS Manufacturing PMI (Feb) 50.3 vs. Exp. 51.1 (Prev. 51.3), lowest since September 2016.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European bourses kicked the session off on the back-foot following similar performance in their Asia-Pac counterparts, post-Powell. However, losses have been pared throughout the morning (Eurostoxx 50 -0.4%). In terms of sector specific performance, movements have been relatively broad-based with support for IT names following strong earnings from Dialog Semiconductor (+10%) which has sent their shares to the top of the Stoxx 600, energy names also firmer as crude modestly recoups some of its post-API losses. Other notable movers this morning post-earnings include St James Place (+3.9%), Ahold (+2.8%), Travis Perkins (-6.2%), Taylor Wimpey (-2.4%), ITV (-6.2%) and Bayer (-3.4%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Dollar continues to benefit from month end positioning and a more hawkish tone emanating from Fed chair Powell during the live testimony and Q&amp;A session. The index is retesting near term chart resistance in the 90.500-600 area, and could establish a firmer recovery base if it manages to close above. Eur/Usd may be pivotal on this front as the pair only just held the 1.2200 level having breached 1.2206 support, with stops expected on a clear break below and exposing several tech supports (1.2181/1.2173 Fibs and 55DMA at 1.2176) ahead of the January 18 ytd low at 1.2165. Above forecasts German jobs data has subsequently seen the headline pair move back into the 1.2220 area. The Greenback is also extending gains vs the Jpy, but struggling around 107.00 again amidst decent offers above the big figure and option expiries at the strike (today and more running off this week). Cable looks prone to a deeper pull-back from 1.4000 and while under 1.3900 further declines could see techs target double bottom support circa 1.3855 (especially if the EU&rsquo;s draft Brexit paper is particularly hard-line). Aud/Usd is also hovering above key downside levels and a hefty 0.7800 expiry (1.1 bn), including 200 and 100 DMAs from 0.7784-76 and the 2018 low at 0.7758, while Nzd/Usd is inching closer to 0.7200 after Tuesday&rsquo;s trade data miss. Usd/Cad is holding just below strong resistance at 1.2796 ahead of Canadian PPI and raw material price data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK STIR futures have largely picked up where they left off on Tuesday, with the front end underpinned amidst some levelling off in short term rates (and recent relatively shallow gradient in 3 month Libor fixings), despite more curve flattening in the US on hawkish Fed policy perceptions. Some supportive survey news overnight, ahead of a blank domestic docket, but another potentially big day on the Brexit front as the EU unveils its blueprint. Back to Liffe, Gilts are advancing following a volatile Liffe open to trade up at 120.80 (+17 ticks) from a 120.57 low and 120.58 initial print. Weak German auction results by any of the standard measure, bar the average yield perhaps, and especially without a near 20% retention, but the 10 year future is actually a tad firmer around 159.26 having dipped just below parity in the run up to the cash bidding deadline. Core debt maintaining an underlying bid amidst some supportive end of February portfolio positioning, albeit more pronounced in USTs where futures and yields are consolidating off respective post-Powell lows and highs. Back to Bunds, perhaps the modest uptick is more to do with supply hedges being unwound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures have seen a mild uptick in recent trade following last night&rsquo;s API-inspired losses. Whereby, prices suffered despite a smaller than expected build to headline crude stockpiles, as it was also accompanied by an unexpected build to gasoline inventories. Traders will also be mindful of yesterday&rsquo;s source reports stating that OPEC are set to meet with US shale producers next Monday. In metals markets, spot gold is particularly flat today in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s Powell-inspired sell-off whilst Chinese steel futures were seen higher overnight with the move to the upside capped by soft demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Crude stocks (Feb 23) 0.933M vs. Exp. 2.700M (Prev. -0.907M).

        "content": "<p>European bourses kicked the session off on the back-foot following similar performance in their Asia-Pac counterparts, post-Powell. However, losses have been pared throughout the morning to see the Eurostoxx 50 trade flat. In terms of sector specific performance, movements have been relatively broad-based with support for IT names following strong earnings from Dialog Semiconductor (+7.2%) which has sent their shares to the top of the Stoxx 600, energy names also firmer as crude modestly recoups some of its post-API losses. Other notable movers this morning post-earnings include St James Place (+2.6%), Ahold (+2.2%), Admiral (+1.5%), Travis Perkins (-9.0%), Taylor Wimpey (-6.3%), ITV (-5.9%) and Bayer (-2.8%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Dollar continues to benefit from month end positioning and a more hawkish tone emanating from Fed chair Powell during the live testimony and Q&amp;A session. The index is retesting near term chart resistance in the 90.500-600 area, and could establish a firmer recovery base if it manages to close above. Eur/Usd may be pivotal on this front as the pair is hovering around 1.2200 having breached 1.2206 support, with stops expected on a clear break below and exposing several tech supports (1.2181/1.2173 Fibs and 55DMA at 1.2176) ahead of the January 18 ytd low at 1.2165. The Greenback is also extending gains vs the Jpy, but struggling around 107.00 again amidst decent offers above the big figure and option expiries at the strike (today and more running off this week). Cable looks prone to a deeper pull-back from 1.4000 and while under 1.3900 further declines could see techs target double bottom support circa 1.3855 (especially if the EU&rsquo;s draft Brexit paper is particularly hard-line). Aud/Usd is also hovering above key downside levels and a hefty 0.7800 expiry (1.1 bn), including 200 and 100 DMAs from 0.7784-76 and the 2018 low at 0.7758, while Nzd/Usd is inching closer to 0.7200 after Tuesday&rsquo;s trade data miss. Usd/Cad is holding just below strong resistance at 1.2796 ahead of Canadian PPI and raw material price data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK STIR futures have largely picked up where they left off on Tuesday, with the front end underpinned amidst some levelling off in short term rates (and recent relatively shallow gradient in 3 month Libor fixings), despite more curve flattening in the US on hawkish Fed policy perceptions. Some supportive survey news overnight, ahead of a blank domestic docket, but another potentially big day on the Brexit front as the EU unveils its blueprint. Back to Liffe, Gilts are advancing following a volatile Liffe open to trade up at 120.80 (+17 ticks) from a 120.57 low and 120.58 initial print, and Bunds have also recovered from a more concerted test of bids/support ahead of 159.00 to post a new 159.37 Eurex high (+17 ticks vs -17 ticks at the early base).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures have seen a mild uptick in recent trade following last night&rsquo;s API-inspired losses. Whereby, prices suffered despite a smaller than expected build to headline crude stockpiles, as it was also accompanied by an unexpected build to gasoline inventories. Traders will also be mindful of yesterday&rsquo;s source reports stating that OPEC are set to meet with US shale producers next Monday. In metals markets, spot gold is particularly flat today in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s Powell-inspired sell-off whilst Chinese steel futures were seen higher overnight with the move to the upside capped by soft demand.</p>\r\n",

A myriad of impulses impacting core bonds at present, and first and foremost another ratchet up in US Treasury yields amidst more curve flattening on the back of Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s testimony that turned somewhat hawkish after the prepared text during the formal presentation and Q&amp;A. As usual the last trading session of the month comes with a pretty packed agenda, including German jobs data, French, Italian and pan-Eurozone preliminary inflation reports, plus another slug of sovereign supply via a Eur3 bn Bund tap, not to mention the 2<sup>nd</sup> US Q4 GDP revision and PCE price metrics. All this on top of month end positioning that often favours fixed over equities, though Euro index extensions are not especially long for February vs average duration weightings (and compared to USTs). &nbsp;Technically, Bunds have some chart support just ahead of 159.00 and again around 158.85 if the big figure is breached.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are negative across the board as the impact from Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s testimony reverberated in the region and with participants also digesting disappointing Chinese PMI data. The inaugural testimony by Fed Chair Powell provided a hawkish view on inflation and was also optimistic on economic growth, which raised the prospects of 4 hikes for this year and subsequently weighed on equity markets across the globe. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are weaker with the worst performers in Australia also dampened by poor earnings results, while Nikkei 225 suffers from a firmer JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) are the laggards with investor sentiment dragged following a miss on Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI data in which the former printed its weakest since September 2016, while aluminium names also felt the brunt after the US confirmed tariffs on aluminium foil imports from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD remains firmer in the wake of Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s testimony which boosted yields across the curve and saw the probability of 3 hikes this year lifted to 73% from 60%, while chances of 4 hikes increased to 34% from 24%. This dampened its major counterparts with EUR/USD firmly below the 1.2300 handle and with GBP/USD testing a breakdown of 1.3900. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies were also subdued after declines in metals and oil prices, as well as the disappointing Chinese PMI data, while JPY bucked the trend amongst the majors amid safe-haven flows and on quasi-tightening concerns after the BoJ lowered its Rinban purchases of 25yr+ maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower despite the broad global risk-averse tone, as Japanese yields track the upside in their US counterparts and following a reduction of the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban purchases in the super-long end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
