The EUR was generally soft across the board, coming back to the 1.2250 region after a weak ZEW survey out of Germany; notably the single currency dipped beneath 1.17 against the CHF, while EURGBP fell further before finding 0.8750 supportive. GBP was subject to a bit of profit-taking after a CPI miss, ultimately falling towards 1.40, where it consolidated through NY trade; the data means the BOE can afford to be a little less hawkish on Super Thursday, though markets still expect a May hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodity FX couldn&#39;t take its cue from higher oil prices, with the CAD, NZD, AUD and NOK all losing out to the buck in North America trade, as high-beta FX was sold, and weakness in industrial metals added to the selling pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMFX was mixed, with MXN and BRL lower on USD strength, though the RUB was buoyed by news that EU will not apply sanctions on the country at this week&#39;s EU summit.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (16 Mar) -2.739M vs. Exp. 3.200M (Prev. 1.156M).

Oracle (ORCL) underperformed after its quarterly earnings report, which saw cloud revenue growth much lower than guidance. Facebook (FB) was once again in the red following its data breach reports, with the FTC rumoured to be investigating, though the NDX showed resilience, trading higher. SPX +0.15% at 2717, DJI +0.48% at 24728 and NDX up 0.3% at 6886.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields were higher by between 3-4bps across the curve in thinner trading conditions ahead of tomorrow&#39;s FOMC meeting, where a 25bps hike is priced with almost certainty. The main focus will be on the FOMC&#39;s rate path. Lifting rates may see a modest rally along the front of the curve, with risks that if inflation doesn&rsquo;t materialise in the medium/longer-run, a curve inversion could be on the cards. A steeper curve will likely require the Fed to raise expectations of the terminal rate by notching up its long-term rate forecast, which could see underperformance in the five-year sector, BoAML says; the bank sees the 2s5s curve steepening, and the 5s30s flattening. US T-Note Futures (June) settled 9+ ticks lower at 120-03.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>- SNAPSHOT: Equities up, Treasuries down, crude up, dollar up<br />- REAR-VIEW: G20 avoids protectionism language, reiterates FX commitments<br />- AHEAD: FOMC (Weds), RBNZ (Weds), UK labour market (Weds)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX +0.15% at 2717, DJI +0.48% at 24728 and NDX up 0.3% at 6886. SECTORS: CONS DISC (XLY): +0.6%, CONS STAP (XLP): -0.3%, ENERGY (XLE): +0.8%, FINANCIALS (XLF): +0.2%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +0.1%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): +0.3%, MATERIALS (XLB): -0.1%, TECH (XLK): 0.00%, TELECOMS (XTL): -1%, UTLITIES (XLU): +0.5%.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Equity futures traded mixed heading into Asia Pac trade, led by energy names -- with the sector up 1% on the day due to rising oil prices. Oracle (ORCL) underperformed after its quarterly earnings report, which saw cloud revenue growth much lower than guidance. Facebook (FB) was once again in the red following its data breach reports, with the FTC rumoured to be investigating, though the NDX showed resilience, trading higher.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: US T-Note Future (June) settled 9+ ticks lower at 120-03</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Treasury yields were higher by between 3-4bps across the curve in thinner trading conditions ahead of tomorrow&#39;s FOMC meeting, where a 25bps hike is priced with almost certainty. The main focus will be on the FOMC&#39;s rate path. Lifting rates may see a modest rally along the front of the curve, with risks that if inflation doesn&rsquo;t materialise in the medium/longer-run, a curve inversion could be on the cards. A steeper curve will likely require the Fed to raise expectations of the terminal rate by notching up its long-term rate forecast, which could see underperformance in the five-year sector, BoAML says; the bank sees the 2s5s curve steepening, and the 5s30s flattening.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:&nbsp;</strong><strong>DXY +0.7% heading into APAC trade</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Against JPY, the USD seemed to be tracking widening yield differentials, and USDJPY tested the 106.60 region. The EUR was generally soft across the board, coming back to the 1.2250 region after a weak ZEW survey out of Germany; notably the single currency dipped beneath 1.17 against the CHF, while EURGBP fell further before finding 0.8750 supportive. GBP was subject to a bit of profit-taking after a CPI miss, ultimately falling towards 1.40, where it consolidated through NY trade; the data means the BOE can afford to be a little less hawkish on Super Thursday, though markets still expect a May hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Commodity FX couldn&#39;t take its cue from higher oil prices, with the CAD, NZD, AUD and NOK all losing out to the buck in North America trade, as high-beta FX was sold, and weakness in industrial metals added to the selling pressure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EMFX was mixed, with MXN and BRL lower on USD, though the RUB was buoyed by news that EU will not apply sanctions on the country at this week&#39;s EU summit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE:&nbsp;</strong><strong>WTI crude April futures settle up $1.34 at $63.40, May futures settle $1.41 at $63.54; Brent crude May futures settle up $1.37 at $67.42.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* While the April/May WTI contango widened by 7 cents (to 14 cents), it is worth noting that most of the volume and OI is in the May contract, which settled 1.51 higher on the day at USD 63.54. The continued narrative on global over-supply took a pause as Venezuela&#39;s (involuntary) output declines were bullish for crude. Along with that, a dose of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia and Iran), and cold weather conditions on the east coast of the US, kept a bid in crude on Tuesday. Crude was unphased by reports suggesting that OPEC was looking to move the goal posts in terms of how it measures the success of its output cuts deal, with the focus moving towards inventory levels; such a proposal could impact the speed at which the cartel achieves its goals. After the bell, the API reports energy inventories, and the street is looking for crude stocks to see a build of +3.2mln, distillates drawing -1.7mln and gasoline drawing &nbsp;-2.0mln; Genscape was said to have forecast a small build at Cushing, which if seen in the DOE data too, would be the second build in 12 weeks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Along with that, a a dose of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia and Iran), and cold weather conditions on the east coast of the US, kept a bid in crude on Tuesday.&nbsp;<br />* Crude was unphased by reports suggesting that OPEC was looking to move the goal posts in terms of how it measures the success of its output cuts deal, with the focus moving towards inventory levels; such a proposal could impact the speed at which the cartel achieves its goals.&nbsp;<br />* After the bell, the API reports energy inventories, and the street is looking for crude stocks to see a 3.2mln, distillates drawing 1.7mln and gasoline drawing 2.0mln; Genscape was said to have forecast a small build at Cushing, which if sseen in the DOE data too, wold be the second build in 12 weeks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Eur/Usd has been undermined by a weak ZEW survey overall and after losing 1.2300+ status got to within a few pips of stops touted near Monday&rsquo;s low, but regrouped somewhat since. Usd/Jpy saw some lively price action above 106.00 after rallying in Asia, extending the topside to 106.50+ on stops and largely dovish BoJ rhetoric before one of the new Deputy Governor&rsquo;s threw in a spanner about potentially tweaking rates before inflation hits its 2% target to give the Jpy a knew-. Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf both remain elevated following the SNB&rsquo;s latest Franc is highly valued assertions and reports of intervention below 1.1700 in the cross. Aud/Usd held above 0.7700 into the NY cut when a decent 800 mn or so option expiry at the 0.7710 strike ran off, but has retreated below the round number again with no support emanating from &lsquo;on hold&rsquo; RBA minutes. Cable lost traction above 1.4050 on the back of UK inflation data misses to trade below 1.4000, but has stabilised with the aid of a positive assessment from DBRS on the Brexit transition deal and despite several EU members raising doubts about the agreement in principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>A lot of the recent/latest moves could rationally be related to if not directly assigned to pre-FOMC positioning, but further relative weakness in the Eur and Gbp does have a more fundamental basis given data/survey misses in the am session. Eur/Usd and Cable have subsequently relinquished big figures at 1.2300 and 1.4000 respectively, with the single currency slipping to around 1.2270 and not far from yesterday&rsquo;s low or stops seen at 1.2257. Market contacts also note daily charts looking more bearish for the Eur vs other currencies, like the Gbp and Jpy. Meanwhile, the Dollar index has managed to recover 90.000+ status, but still needs to make a run on 90.500 before building a firmer (chart) recovery base. Turning to core debt, Bunds have probed a bit lower and back under 158.00 to a fresh Eurex intraday base at 157.91 (-32 ticks), and nearest support is around 157.80, then Monday&rsquo;s 157.67 low.

Elsewhere,&nbsp;<strong>Hang Seng (+0.1%)</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%)</strong>&nbsp;were subdued for a bulk of the session (Shanghai Comp. ebbed back into positive territory in the latter stages of trade) after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations and amid trade war concerns with US President Trump said to be preparing a USD 60bln package of tariffs for China. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lacklustre alongside subdued trade in T-note futures during Asia hours, and with price action also restricted amid an enhanced liquidity auction for long to super-long bonds which saw a lower b/c then prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations.

The minutes also stated that AUD TWI remains in range seen in previous couple of years and that low rates are contributing to lowering unemployment and lifting inflation.

Sectors are broadly in the red, with the exception of materials which has been supported after Rio Tinto (+0.6%) announced the sale of its Hail Creek and Valeria units in a USD 1.7bln deal with Glencore. The media-sector initially outperformed at the open after the world&#39;s third-largest advertising group Publicis (-0.5%) reported its latest strategy action, before Co. shares were dragged lower as markets continued to digest the update. Elsewhere, banks are showing mild gains across the region lifting financials, ahead of tomorrow&#39;s widely expected Fed rate hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Jpy</strong> extended overnight losses amidst what seemed to be a stop-driven run in early European trade, with <strong>Usd/Jpy</strong> up through 106.50 and its 20 DMA (106.50-55) to circa 106.60 at one stage, while <strong>Eur/Jpy</strong> spiked to around 131.70 as the single currency retains a bid in its own right on hawkish ECB source reports. However, recent comments from one of the new BoJ Deputy Governor&rsquo;s (Amamiya) suggesting that rates could be adjusted before inflation reaches the 2% target has prompted some <strong>Jpy</strong> demand/short covering. Meanwhile, <strong>Eur/Usd</strong> has rallied further above 1.2300, reaching 1.2355 at best and eyeing offers at 1.2360 next, while bids are seen in the 1.2330-20 area, but in terms of the G20 arena overall, Sterling remains the top performer after yesterday&rsquo;s UK-EU Brexit transition deal and despite weaker than expected UK inflation data almost across the board that only sparked a knee-jerk Pound sell-off. Cable is back to mid-range between 1.4067-20 parameters and <strong>Eur/Gbp</strong> still sub-0.8800 as attention switches to the latest labour/wage update on Wednesday and then the BoE on Thursday. At the opposite end of the spectrum the <strong>Aud</strong> and <strong>Nzd</strong> remain laggards with the former not helped by very neutral, still in wait and see mode RBA minutes or a further dump in iron ore prices and around 0.7700 vs the <strong>Usd</strong>, while the <strong>Kiwi</strong> is just keeping its head above 0.7200 vs the Greenback awaiting the RBNZ. Conversely, <strong>Usd/Cad</strong> is attempting to retrace a bit further below 1.3100 on better NAFTA vibes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Core EU bonds</strong> have seen some volatile price action after the opening markdowns and early extended moves to the downside, with Gilts especially whippy in wake of softer than forecast CPI, RPI and PPI data from the UK. The 10-year benchmark rebounded sharply and briefly into positive territory at 121.94 (+13 ticks) before retreating again on reflection and the likelihood that one month&rsquo;s inflation figures probably won&rsquo;t materially change the BoE&rsquo;s policy leanings, particularly after potentially pivotal progress on the Brexit transition front. <strong>Gilts</strong> now 20 ticks below parity, albeit off worst levels (-34 ticks at one stage). Similar, though less pronounced 2-way trade in <strong>Bunds</strong> on the ZEW miss and beforehand hand within a wider 158.17-157.95 range than seen in earlier Eurex exchanges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the energy complex, WTI and Brent crude futures remain in close proximity to yesterday&rsquo;s highs which were seen after reports that the US was exploring sanctions on Venezuelan oil. Elsewhere, energy newsflow remains light with markets now awaiting the latest API report. In metals markets, gold is sat in negative territory albeit modestly so alongside the slightly firmer USD. Elsewhere, Chinese iron ore continued its decline overnight after yesterday&rsquo;s slump as mounting inventories and soft domestic demand hampers prices while copper was also lacklustre amid the risk-averse tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The Jpy extended overnight losses amidst what seemed to be a stop-driven run in early European trade, with Usd/Jpy up through 106.50 and its 20 DMA (106.50-55) to circa 106.60 at one stage, while Eur/Jpy spiked to around 131.70 as the single currency retains a bid in its own right on hawkish ECB source reports. However, recent comments from one of the new BoJ Deputy Governor&rsquo;s (Amamiya) suggesting that rates could be adjusted before inflation reaches the 2% target has prompted some Jpy demand/short covering. Meanwhile, Eur/Usd has rallied further above 1.2300, reaching 1.2355 at best and eyeing offers at 1.2360 next, while bids are seen in the 1.2330-20 area, but in terms of the G20 arena overall, Sterling remains the top performer after yesterday&rsquo;s UK-EU Brexit transition deal and despite weaker than expected UK inflation data almost across the board that only sparked a knee-jerk Pound sell-off. Cable is back to mid-range between 1.4067-20 parameters and Eur/Gbp still sub-0.8800 as attention switches to the latest labour/wage update on Wednesday and then the BoE on Thursday. At the opposite end of the spectrum the Aud and Nzd remain laggards with the former not helped by very neutral, still in wait and see mode RBA minutes or a further dump in iron ore prices and around 0.7700 vs the Usd, while the Kiwi is just keeping its head above 0.7200 vs the Greenback awaiting the RBNZ. Conversely, Usd/Cad is attempting to retrace a bit further below 1.3100 on better NAFTA vibes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

A reading in line with expectations of 2.8% would be below the Bank of England&rsquo;s forecast of 2.9% Y/Y from their February Quarterly Inflation Report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The February fall is partly due to base effects related to food and transport,&rdquo; writes Nomura in a client note. &ldquo;But more generally a decline this year should be related to fading exchange rate effects.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ING echo this sentiment and expect core CPI to be virtually back at target by the end of the summer. This time around the core measure is expected to slow to 2.5% from 2.7%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the very near term, this data shouldn&rsquo;t have much of an impact on the Bank of England&rsquo;s thoughts for policy on Thursday as the Monetary Policy Committee are not expected to make any changes. However, a greater slowdown in price growth could give the BoE room to wait further before hiking interest rates, after last month they suggested rates may have to rise somewhat sooner and to a somewhat greater extent than previously thought.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> initially extended on gains from the news that UK and EU reached an agreement on Brexit transition terms, while <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses ignored the risk-averse tone and rose amid continued short-covering and touted Gotobi demand.

ASX 200 (-0.4%) was weaker with miners pressured in Australia as Dalian iron ore futures extended on losses due to rising inventories, while Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) underperformed despite a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.4%) &amp; Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) were also subdued after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations and amid trade war concerns with US President Trump said to be preparing a USD 60bln package of tariffs for China. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lacklustre alongside subdued trade in T-note futures during Asia hours, and with price action also restricted amid an enhanced liquidity auction for long to super-long bonds which saw a lower b/c then prior.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.2%) are weaker with miners pressured in Australia as Dalian iron ore futures extend on losses on rising inventories, while Japan underperforms despite a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.7%) &amp; Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) are also softer after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations and amid trade war concerns with US President Trump said to be preparing a USD 60bln package of tariffs on China that could be announced by Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action has quietened overnight with currencies taking a breather from yesterday&rsquo;s moves in which EUR was underpinned by source reports that the ECB is comfortable with the market pricing a first-rate hike in Q2 2019, and that the debate is shifting towards the steepness of the rate path amid unison in ending QE this year. Elsewhere, GBP/USD also extends on gains above 1.4000 after the UK and EU reached an agreement on Brexit transition terms, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses ignored the risk-averse tone and rose amid continued short-covering and touted Gotobi demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lacklustre alongside a pullback in T-note futures during Asia hours, with demand also dampened as participants await the enhanced-liquidity auction for long to super-long bonds.</p>\r\n",
