China said the moves were necessary counter-measures to US tariffs. The US is also set to begin collecting 25% duties on USD 16bln on the same day. Levies from China will be implemented on 333 products including crude oil, coal, steel, diesel, bikes and cars, medical equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>Canada was said to join talks in Washington as soon as next week, and US &amp; Mexico were touted to focus on getting a deal on autos this week. Previously, on Monday, Mexico&#39;s Economy Minister Guajardo said talks with Canada may take place next week, depending upon the progress made this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Following their diplomatic spat, Saudi Arabia has reportedly been selling Canadian assets since Tuesday this week, with Riyadh angry with Canadian demands that two women&#39;s rights activists be released from prison. Canadian PM Trudeau then stated they will continue to work with the Saudis and will maintain the approach. On the Iranian front, the German government on Wednesday did not see any reason to halt cash transfers to Iran, according to German newspaper Handelsblatt. US National Adviser Bolton says the US is looking at imposing other sanctions on Iran and further sanction are &quot;very real&quot;. US Secretary of State Pompeo tweets &#39;Today, the regime in Iran is at odds with world peace. We urge our allies and partners to join the US and deny Iran&rsquo;s leadership the funds to oppress the Iranian people and to foment terrorism around the world.&#39; Separately, Trump reportedly offered to send Pompeo to North Korea again for talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Richmond Fed&#39;s Barkin (Voter) toed the FOMC line, and said the Fed should continue to raise rates and that the Fed&rsquo;s benchmark rate is not yet at its normal level. On tariffs, he said tariff concerns were rising and the economy was facing risks from geopolitics, market volatility and higher interest rates effects. He did note that the labour market is very tight and inflation at target, and added that if economy needs stimulus in future, the Fed might need to use unconventional policies like those used following the great depression. Barkin sees gradual rate increases as sensible, and tit-for-tat tariffs are likely to cancel out in terms of effect on US inflation, adding he can imagine pausing hikes at some point or keep going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BoE&#39;s McCafferty (Hawk) said he finds it hard to believe the UK will end up in a better trade situation than it could have been because of Brexit, at least for a significant period. Note McCafferty is set to leave the BoE in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The UK said to be planning a &quot;no-deal&quot; Brexit meeting in September, with the ideal of keeping the Irish border open should a &quot;no-deal&quot; happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.03% at 2857, NDX +0.09% at 7470 , DJI at -0.18% at 25583. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.66%, Materials -0.13%, Industrials -0.26%, Cons Discretionary -0.53%, Cons Staples +0.37%, Healthcare +0.22%, Financials +0.29%, Tech +0.48%, Telecoms +0.16%, Utilities -0.61%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Disney (DIS) reported AMC on Tuesday where both EPS and revenues fell short of Wall St expectations which led to the name being one of the laggards in the DJI. Snap (SNAP) reported beats on both top and bottom lines, however, its DAU&rsquo;s fell 2% from the previous quarter to 188mln, despite average revenue per user increasing 40% y/y to $1.40 from $1.05, SNAP were extremely volatile aftermarket but closed ~6% lower. Michael Kors (KORS) &amp; Albemarle (ALB) outperformed in the SPX after both names beat on the top and bottom line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla&rsquo;s (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the board are having open talks about going private, and the board met several times over the last week and will evaluate the next steps. The discussion included how being private could be beneficial to the company and it also addressed funding requirements and methods. In later trade, the WSJ reported the SEC has made inquiries into Elon Musk&rsquo;s consideration of taking Tesla private via Twitter. In addition, an RBC note reiterated Celgene (CELG) as outperform as they revisit the notion of Celgene going private at $120/shr. Regeneron (REGN) were hit after reports last night that US President Trump is forcing pharmaceutical names to negotiate on prices for more medications paid for by Medicare.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>CVS (CVS) who also benefitted from a strong earnings report, were further boosted as the co. and Aetna (AET) passed an antitrust hurdle which AT&amp;T (T) faced in its takeover of Time Warner (TWX). Cigna (CI) responded following Icahn&rsquo;s recent outcry on the deal with Express Scripts (ESRX), Cigna stated they strongly disagree with his views and believe the deal will bring &lsquo;tremendous&rsquo; shareholder value. During hours sources reported that Hong Kong billionaire, Lui Che-Woo of Galaxy Entertainment group is reportedly interested in buying Wynn Resorts (WYNN) for close to $204/share, however this is unconfirmed. Elsewhere, SJW Group (SJW) announced the Moss family, who own a 31% stake in the co., said they approve the deal with Connecticut Water Services (CTWS).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U8) SETTLE LOWER BY USD 2.23 AT USD 66.94; BRENT FUTURES (V8) SETTLE LOWER BY USD 2.37 AT USD 72.28.</strong> Oil markets are trading red with renewed concerns about tensions with China manifesting in crude markets. Overnight, China (world&#39;s largest crude importer) reported that July crude imports recovered slightly, but were still at the third lowest of the year. PVM said this was on the back of lacklustre demand from the country&#39;s independent refiners. EIA weekly data sowed crude stocks drawing down less than forecast (-1.35mln vs -3.33mln exp), with Cushing stocks off by 590k. Crude oil production in the US fell for the second week, but just under 1% to 10.8mln BPD. Looking at the fundamentals, however, analysts at UBS are still encouraged, and say supply is set to tighten: &quot;global markets are very tight this year and look set to remain tight through 2019,&quot; and points out that the recent EIA STEO forecasts have been conservative on their views for downside in Iranian and Venezuelan supply this year, and says that the numbers for lost exports from these countries will push crude markets into extreme undersupply.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE 1 TICK HIGHER AT 119-16.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries ended the session pretty much flat and yields mostly unchanged; yields were lower across the curve by less than 1bps. The 30yr yield hit session lows at 3.110 following solid auction demand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US sold $26bln in 10yr notes stopping on the screws at a high yield of 2.96%. Overall a relatively average auction, the cover was slightly stronger than the 6wk average but was slightly beneath the previous. Dealers took lower than the 6wk average and indirects took 61.3% just beneath the auction average of 61.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US TO SELL USD 18BLN 30-YEAR BONDS: </strong>The US Treasury will auction a total of USD 78bln in 3-year (USD 34bln, Tuesday), 10-year (USD 26bln, Wednesday) and 30-year (USD 18bln, Thursday), all to settle on 15 August; analysts at TD Securities note that USD38.2bln matures at the mid-month settlement, implying net supply of USD 33.8bln in new cash. TD also points out that USD 23.1bn matures on the Fed&#39;s balance sheet, and the Fed will allow USD 12.6bn to run-off, reinvesting USD 10.5bn, which will add-on USD 4.6bn to 3s, USD 3.5bn to the 10s, and USD 2.4bn to 30s. It is also worth noting that this series of auctions has a higher issuance amount, per the August refunding, though TD Securities believe that the drift higher in yields is likely to support demand. Analysts at SocGen are cautious on the 30s auction, noting that the July&rsquo;s auction saw a tail, while cover was softer than recent auctions. It does however point out that participation of investment funds continues to notable. &ldquo;This is partly explained by ongoing demand for long duration securities from pension funds and is likely to help with the upcoming auction takedown as well,&rdquo; SocGen explains. In terms of set up, SG says that the 30s sector remains rich on the curve, though has cheapened since last month, when 5s30s hit fresh decade lows. The bank notes that positioning is likely to be supportive, as speculators&rsquo; have been further increasing net shorts in the ultra-bond to record levels. &ldquo;Any short covering from them is a positive for the auction,&rdquo; SocGen says, but adds that &ldquo;dealers have increased their holdings in the 11+ year sector to the highest level since 2001, which is a negative.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The index and broad Dollar have regained composure after an overnight/early Wednesday wobble, but largely at the expense of other rather than anything USD supportive, with comments from Fed&rsquo;s Barkin covering all bases, but ultimately advocating further policy normalisation to get rates back to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; levels in line with FOMC guidance. The DXY looks just above 95.000 after another dip below but remains capped around 95.500 and the ytd high (95.656), so more entrenched within recent ranges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> A real mid-week mauling for Sterling with Cable down to new 2018 lows just ahead of technical &lsquo;support&rsquo; at 1.2850 and EURGBP breaching 0.9000 to the upside on persistent Brexit concerns, and unconfirmed reports that the UK Government is set to convene next month for a no deal meeting with the focus on a plan to keep the Irish border open in that event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Another underperformer with AUDUSD fading once more before 0.7450 and key technical resistance just under in wake of comments from RBA&rsquo;s Lowe about no compelling reason to raise rates and renewed pressure on the YUAN, as China unveiled its list of US goods to be subject to import tariffs on August 23 if Washington goes ahead with the next $16bln batch from Beijing. Chart support from 0.7415-10 has subsequently been tested and breached, marginally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD:</strong> Some mad moves for the Loonie that has been under pressure alongside oil prices and due to the ongoing Saudi-Canadian rift, but lurched below 1.3100 vs its US rival as new broke of more action taken by the Kingdom via an instruction from the Central Bank and Pension Fund to asset managers to liquidate Canadian stock, bond and cash holdings. However, USDCAD retreated sharply through 1.3100 as later headlines said that the edict to sell assets was actually issued on Tuesday and Canadian investments in Saudi Arabia were unaffected and CAD further strengthened after sources reported Canada is to join talks in Washington next week. Note, much weaker than expected Canadian building permits were shrugged off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, CHF, EUR:</strong> All relatively flat vs the USD, with the Kiwi underpinned between 0.6760-25 ahead of the RBNZ policy meeting later and after an uptick in NZ inflation expectations overnight. The Franc, meanwhile, stuck in a 0.9970-30 range, while the single currency pivoted 1.1600 and technical levels (daily chart resistance and Fibs) amidst a lack of EUR specific drivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The major outperformer all day having broken resistance at 111.00 vs the Greenback, but unconvincingly and still trading either side ahead of some hefty option expiries tomorrow from the level through 111.50 to 112.00. Note, the headline pair also held just above the 10 WMA at 110.83 and 55 DMA at 110.69.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Wednesday seemed like a make or break day for regional currencies after widespread rebounds yesterday, but those proved short-lived as gains were handed back, reversed or even more in the case of the RUB that slumped towards ytd lows vs the USD circa 65.0375 vs 65.446 back in April on a mixture of crude losses, bearish chart breaks, US-Russia strains and broader risk off sentiment. The RUB was further weakened as the US announced sanctions on Russia are to take place on August 22nd, as they determined the Russians were behind the use of the Novichok nerve agent. New lows were seen just shy of 65.66.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>RBNZ Interest rate Decision due at 2200BST/16CDT. The RBNZ are to decide on rates later in which forecasts are one-side for the central bank to keep policy on hold for a 12th consecutive meeting with all economists surveyed unanimously expecting the Official Cash Rate to be maintained at 1.75% where it has been since November 2016. In addition, many do not anticipate a move by the RBNZ throughout this year although around two-thirds of those surveyed expect a hike by Q4 2019. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19812/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview. </a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Overnight, China (world&#39;s largest crude importer) reported that July crude imports recovered slightly, but were still at the third lowest of the year. PVM said this was on the back of lacklustre demand from the country&#39;s independent refiners. EIA weekly data sowed crude stocks drawing down less than forecast (-1.35mln vs -3.33mln exp), with Cushing stocks off by 590k. Crude oil production in the US fell for the second week, but just under 1% to 10.8mln BPD. Looking at the fundamentals, however, analysts at UBS are still encouraged, and say supply is set to tighten: &quot;global markets are very tight this year and look set to remain tight through 2019,&quot; and points out that the recent EIA STEO forecasts have been conservative on their views for downside in Iranian and Venezuelan supply this year, and says that the numbers for lost exports from these countries will push crude markets into extreme undersupply.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

TD also points out that USD 23.1bn matures on the Fed&#39;s balance sheet, and the Fed will allow USD 12.6bn to run-off, reinvesting USD 10.5bn, which will add-on USD 4.6bn to 3s, USD 3.5bn to the 10s, and USD 2.4bn to 30s. It is also worth noting that this series of auctions has a higher issuance amount, per the August refunding, though TD Securities believe that the drift higher in yields is likely to support demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts at Societe Generale note that outright 10-year yields are cheaper (at the time of writing) than July&rsquo;s high yield rate, which should provide support. SocGen says, however, that some concession will be needed in order to account for the increased auction size, and the resumption of Treasury curve flattening. The auction may benefit from short covering demand from speculators, who are at a record net short in 10y futures, SocGen say, and in addition, the last 10-year auction stopped through, with a sharp increase in investment fund participation, which SocGen says is a positive for Wednesday&rsquo;s auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Results will be published after 1800 BST/1300 EST on 8 August.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index and broad Dollar have regained composure after an overnight/early Wednesday wobble, but largely at the expense of other srather than anything Usd supportive, with comments from Fed&rsquo;s Barkin covering all bases, but ultimately advocating further policy normalisation to get rates back to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; levels in line with FOMC guidance. The DXY looks firm again above 95.000 after another dip below, but remains capped around 95.500 and the ytd high (95.656), so more entrenched within recent ranges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A real mid-week mauling for Sterling with Cable down to new 2018 lows just ahead of technical &lsquo;support&rsquo; at 1.2850 and Eur/Gbp breaching 0.9000 to the upside on persistent Brexit concerns, and unconfirmed reports that the UK Government is set to convene next month for a no deal meeting with the focus on a plan to keep the Irish border open in that event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another underperformer with Aud/Usd fading once more before 0.7450 and key technical resistance just under in wake of comments from RBA&rsquo;s Lowe about no compelling reason to raise rates and renewed pressure on the YUAN, as China unveiled its list of US goods to be subject to import tariffs on August 23 if Washington goes ahead with the next $16 bn batch from Beijing. Chart support from 0.7415-10 has subsequently been tested and breached, marginally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some mad moves for the Loonie that has been under pressure alongside oil prices and due to the ongoing Saudi-Canadian rift, but lurched below 1.3100 vs its US rival as new broke of more action taken by the Kingdom via an instruction from the Central Bank and Pension Fund to asset managers to liquidate Canadian stock, bond and cash holdings. However, Usd/Cad retreated sharply through 1.3100 as later headlines said that the edict to sell assets was actually issued on Tuesday and Canadian investments in Saudi Arabia were unaffected. Note, much weaker than expected Canadian building permits were shrugged off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CHF/EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All relatively flat vs the Usd, with the Kiwi underpinned between 0.6760-25 ahead of the RBNZ policy meeting later (see Ransquawk&rsquo;s preview via the Research Suite or headline feed) and after an uptick in NZ inflation expectations overnight. The Franc, meanwhile, stuck in a 0.9970-40 range, while the single currency pivoted 1.1600 and technical levels (daily chart resistance and Fibs) amidst a lack of Eur specific drivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major outperformer all day having broken resistance at 111.00 vs the Greenback, but unconvincingly and still trading either side ahead of some hefty option expiries tomorrow from the level through 111.50 to 112.00. Note, the headline pair also held just above the 10 WMA at 110.83 and 55 DMA at 110.69.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wednesday seemed like a make or break day for regional currencies after widespread rebounds yesterday, but those proved short-lived as gains were handed back, reversed or even more in the case of the Rub that slumped towards ytd lows vs the Usd circa 65.0375 vs 65.446 back in April on a mixture of crude losses, bearish chart breaks, US-Russia strains and broader risk off sentiment.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.3%) was led higher by miners and surprisingly financials despite weaker earnings from Australia&rsquo;s largest lender CBA and scandal-ridden AMP. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) was initially supported throughout most the day by earnings and a weaker currency but then pared gains in late trade, while Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%) were mixed with underperformance in the mainland amid increased trade tensions after the US finalized the 2nd tranche of tariffs in which it will impose 25% tariffs on USD 16bln of Chinese goods from August 23rd. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher for most the session despite as prices rebounded from this week&rsquo;s pressure and support near the 150.00 level, while the BoJ were also in the market for nearly JPY 1tln of government bonds concentrated in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China NDRC said they will use monetary policy including targeted RRR reductions to support debt-to-equity swaps, while it added it will require banks to be stricter in limiting corporate debt and restrict high leverage firms from borrowing too much.

There was also the opinion that it will likely take more time than expected to achieve 2% inflation and that is time for BoJ to strengthen commitment to reaching price target due to weak price moves. Furthermore, it was suggested that the BoJ should permit long-term rates to move around -0.25% to 0.25% and should expand monetary stimulus and adopt forward guidance to spur demand and inflation expectations.

(Il Sole 24)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equites have largely opened the day mixed, as the focus remains on large cap earnings. Uninspiring earnings from both Munich Re (-3.5%) and E.ON (-1.8%) have hit the DAX, which alongside the SMI are both in the red. The healthcare sector is the underperforming sector after Novo Nordisk reported a miss on both EBIT and revenue expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earnings for AEX heavyweights ABN AMRO (+3.3%) and Ahold Delhaize (-2.0%) were also released, with the Ahold missing on net profit expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Southern Co (SO) Q2 EPS loss USD 0.15 vs. Exp. USD 0.69 (may not compare), revenue USD 5.62bln vs. Exp. USD 5.3bln</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After opening mark-ups and early retracements a period of even choppier price action has seen debt futures extend both sides of their trading ranges in rather erratic, but typically Summer fashion. Bunds appeared to spark or lead the more frantic moves with a dip through 162.00 to 161.96 (-5 ticks on the day), but then a sharper rebound to 162.23 (+22 ticks), with Gilts tagging along, but not quite as volatile. The 10 year UK benchmark has posted a marginal new Liffe trough at 122.65 (-3 ticks), though no fresh top, with DMO issuance to absorb. On that note, the GBP 2.5bln auction saw decent demand but at a higher yield and came with a slightly longer tail. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are just off overnight session peaks, but only fractionally firmer from Tuesday&rsquo;s CBOT closes with supply also in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Stops and another rebound in the YUAN have prompted all round Jpy buying and a break in the hitherto tight Usd/Jpy range to the downside through 111.00. This, after resistance above the big figure held on several attempts to rally towards heavy offers at 111.50, but the headline pair may not decline much further from circa 110.85 so far given multiple option expiries running off on Thursday and starting from 111.00-05 (1.4 bn) through 111.50-55 (1.9 bn) all the way up to 111.90, 112.00 and then 112.10-20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - Another relative G10 outperformer vs the Greenback, but the Kiwi is still struggling to take flight above 0.6750 ahead of the RBNZ policy meeting that is widely expected to keep the status quo going in terms of unchanged rates and on hold guidance going. Firmer 2 year NZ inflation expectations overnight have given the Nzd a modest lift, but unlikely to alter the Central Bank&rsquo;s rate decision or guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD - The Pound continues to languish amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and benign BoE policy intentions after only a second hike since the GFC last week, with Cable slipping to a fresh ytd sub-1.2900 and Eur/Gbp crossing 0.9000 to the upside, but the Loonie has also extended its retreat after weaker Canadian PMI prints yesterday, as Usd/Cad grinds higher towards 1.3100 supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD/EUR - All narrowly mixed and holding up relatively well vs the Dollar as the Franc continues to straddle 0.9950 and Aud retains 0.7400+ status between 0.7450 and the 55 DMA (0.7448), with support seen from 0.7410-15 ahead of the aforementioned big figure. However, the single currency is back below 1.1600 following offers at 1.1620 and with a Fib plus daily/weekly cloud resistance also capping the upside (1.1629, 1.1653 and 1.1632 respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - It could be a watershed mid-week session for regional currencies after turnaround Tuesday for many that staged decent recovery rebounds vs the Usd, especially the Lira as US-Turkey talks resume to try and resolve the current dispute, while the Cny/Cnh will be eyeing further tariff developments after the US finalised the next $16 bn Chinese imports to be taxed from August 23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil market is currently uneventful with WTI consolidating around its 100DMA of USD 74.53/BBL as news flow has been light for the fossil fuel after yesterday&rsquo;s larger than expected draw in crude stockpiles in the weekly API report alongside a surprise build in gasoline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (03 Aug) -6.00M vs. Exp. -3.30M (Prev. 5.59M).

London copper is also up on the day, and has set the scene for base metals, with all of nickel (+1.5%), zinc (+0.5%), lead (+2.6%) and aluminium (+0.2%) up on an improved risk sentiment</p>\r\n",

Uninspiring earnings from both Munich Re (-3.5%) and E.ON (-1.8%) have hit the DAX, which alongside the SMI are both in the red. The healthcare sector is the underperforming sector after Novo Nordisk reported a miss on both EBIT and revenue expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earnings for AEX heavyweights ABN AMRO (+3.3%) and Ahold Delhaize (-2.0%) were also released, with the Ahold missing on net profit expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prudential (flat) reported a beat on expectations for operating profit and an increase in their interim dividend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally in the M&amp;A scope,&nbsp; 21st Century Fox filed the relevant paperwork for an unchanged GBP 14/share bid for Sky overnight, and the Smiths Group is reportedly close to pulling out of the ICU tie-up on suggestions that Baxter International may be interested in a similar deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Stops and another rebound in the YUAN have prompted all round Jpy buying and a break in the hitherto tight Usd/Jpy range to the downside through 111.00. This, after resistance above the big figure held on several attempts to rally towards heavy offers at 111.50, but the headline pair may not decline much further from circa 110.85 so far given multiple option expiries running off on Thursday and starting from 111.00-05 (1.4 bn) through 111.50-55 (1.9 bn) all the way up to 111.90, 112.00 and then 112.10-20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - Another relative G10 outperformer vs the Greenback, but the Kiwi is still struggling to take flight above 0.6750 ahead of the RBNZ policy meeting that is widely expected to keep the status quo going in terms of unchanged rates and on hold guidance going. Firmer 2 year NZ inflation expectations overnight have given the Nzd a modest lift, but unlikely to alter the Central Bank&rsquo;s rate decision or guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD - The Pound continues to languish amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and benign BoE policy intentions after only a second hike since the GFC last week, with Cable slipping to a fresh ytd low just ahead of 1.2900 and Eur/Gbp creeping further towards 0.9000, but the Loonie has also extended its retreat after weaker Canadian PMI prints yesterday, as Usd/Cad grinds higher towards 1.3100 supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD/EUR - All narrowly mixed and holding up relatively well vs the Dollar as the Franc continues to straddle 0.9950 and Aud retains 0.7400+ status between 0.7450 and the 55 DMA (0.7448), with support seen from 0.7410-15 ahead of the aforementioned big figure. However, the single currency is back below 1.1600 following offers at 1.1620 and with a Fib plus daily/weekly cloud resistance also capping the upside (1.1629, 1.1653 and 1.1632 respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - It could be a watershed mid-week session for regional currencies after turnaround Tuesday for many that staged decent recovery rebounds vs the Usd, especially the Lira as US-Turkey talks resume to try and resolve the current dispute, while the Cny/Cnh will be eyeing further tariff developments after the US finalised the next $16 bn Chinese imports to be taxed from August 23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After opening mark-ups and early retracements a period of even choppier price action has seen debt futures extend both sides of their trading ranges in rather erratic, but typically Summer fashion. Bunds appeared to spark or lead the more frantic moves with a dip through 162.00 to 161.96 (-5 ticks on the day), but then a sharper rebound to 162.23 (+22 ticks), with Gilts tagging along, but not quite as volatile. The 10 year UK benchmark has posted a marginal new Liffe trough at 122.65 (-3 ticks), though no fresh top, with DMO issuance on the way. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are just off overnight session peaks, but only fractionally firmer from Tuesday&rsquo;s CBOT closes with supply also in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil market is currently uneventful with WTI consolidating around its 100DMA of USD 74.53/BBL as news flow has been light for the fossil fuel after yesterday&rsquo;s larger than expected draw in crude stockpiles in the weekly API report alongside a surprise build in gasoline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&#39;s President Xi has instructed Chinese state oil companies to lift production, according to CNOOC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals sector gold (-0.1%) is up slightly, currently trading around the USD 1215/OZ level. London copper is also up on the day, and has set the scene for base metals, with all of nickel (+1.5%), zinc (+0.5%), lead (+2.6%) and aluminium (+0.2%) up on an improved risk sentiment</p>\r\n",

The 10 year UK benchmark has posted a marginal new Liffe trough at 122.65 (-3 ticks), though no fresh top, with DMO issuance on the way.

This, after resistance above the big figure held on several attempts to rally towards heavy offers at 111.50, but the headline pair may not decline much further from circa 110.85 so far given multiple option expiries running off on Thursday and starting from 111.00-05 (1.4 bn) through 111.50-55 (1.9 bn) all the way up to 111.90, 112.00 and then 112.10-20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another relative G10 outperformer vs the Greenback, but the Kiwi is still struggling to take flight above 0.6750 ahead of the RBNZ policy meeting that is widely expected to keep the status quo going in terms of unchanged rates and on hold guidance going. Firmer 2 year NZ inflation expectations overnight have given the Nzd a modest lift, but unlikely to alter the Central Bank&rsquo;s rate decision or guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound continues to languish amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and benign BoE policy intentions after only a second hike since the GFC last week, with Cable slipping to a fresh ytd low just ahead of 1.2900 and Eur/Gbp creeping further towards 0.9000, but the Loonie has also extended its retreat after weaker Canadian PMI prints yesterday, as Usd/Cad grinds higher towards 1.3100 supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed and holding up relatively well vs the Dollar as the Franc continues to straddle 0.9950 and Aud retains 0.7400+ status between 0.7450 and the 55 DMA (0.7448), with support seen from 0.7410-15 ahead of the aforementioned big figure. However, the single currency is back below 1.1600 following offers at 1.1620 and with a Fib plus daily/weekly cloud resistance also capping the upside (1.1629, 1.1653 and 1.1632 respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could be a watershed mid-week session for regional currencies after turnaround Tuesday for many that staged decent recovery rebounds vs the Usd, especially the Lira as US-Turkey talks resume to try and resolve the current dispute, while the Cny/Cnh will be eyeing further tariff developments after the US finalised the next $16 bn Chinese imports to be taxed from August 23.</p>\r\n",

Hence, the 10 year UK bond saw no follow-through buying and has retreated to 122.69, while the Short Sterling strip is also drifting down from 2 ticks above par at one stage to sit flat to 1 tick ahead. Back to debt futures, looming DMO supply may impact further into the Gbp2.5 bn 2028 tap, and after, as the UK auction goes head to head, albeit in advance of $26 bn 10 year notes.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.3%) was led higher by miners and surprisingly financials despite weaker earnings from Australia&rsquo;s largest lender CBA and scandal-ridden AMP. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) was initially supported throughout most the day by earnings and a weaker currency but then pared gains in late trade, while Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) were mixed with underperformance in the mainland amid increased trade tensions after the US finalized the 2nd tranche of tariffs in which it will impose 25% tariffs on USD 16bln of Chinese goods from August 23rd. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher for most the session despite as prices rebounded from this week&rsquo;s pressure and support near the 150.00 level, while the BoJ were also in the market for nearly JPY 1tln of government bonds concentrated in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China NDRC said they will use monetary policy including targeted RRR reductions to support debt-to-equity swaps, while it added it will require banks to be stricter in limiting corporate debt and restrict high leverage firms from borrowing too much.

(Newswires)<br />Chinese Exports (CNY)(Jul) Y/Y 6.0% vs. Exp. 5.6% (Prev. 3.1%)<br />Chinese Imports (CNY)(Jul) Y/Y 20.9% vs. Exp. 12.5% (Prev. 6.0%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8313 (Prev. 6.8431)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Summary of Opinions from July 30th-31st meeting stated it is necessary to persistently continue with the current powerful monetary easing as the momentum toward 2 percent inflation is maintained. There was also the opinion that it will likely take more time than expected to achieve 2% inflation and that is time for BoJ to strengthen commitment to reaching price target due to weak price moves. Furthermore, it was suggested that the BoJ should permit long-term rates to move around -0.25% to 0.25% and should expand monetary stimulus and adopt forward guidance to spur demand and inflation expectations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY was subdued after the prior day&rsquo;s softness and eyes a retest of the 95.00 level to the downside, while its counterparts were eventually underpinned after the Chinese trade data in which EUR/USD gained a firmer footing above the 1.1600 handle and GBP/USD rebounded from near 11-month lows. Antipodeans also benefitted in the aftermath of the release which some attributed to the surge in Chinese imports which could benefit other nations given the increasing US-China trade tensions and with NZD also lifted on increased inflation expectations, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses held on to most its recent gains but have pulled back from intraday highs as risk sentiment in Tokyo subsided.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA Governor Lowe reiterated that the board sees no strong case for near-term change in rates and that next move is likely to be higher if economy evolves as expected. Lowe added it is natural for rates to eventually move back to more normal levels and that financials risks are moving in correct direction but stated he has not found arguments for a hike in rates convincing.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were marginally higher overnight with WTI crude futures edging mild gains after support held at USD 69.00/bbl and following the weekly API report which showed a larger than expected draw in crude stockpiles, although the support from the inventory data was only brief given amid a surprise build in gasoline. Elsewhere, metals were also modestly higher as gold benefitted from a weaker USD, while copper extended on gains amid the Chinese trade data which showed imports of copper concentrates and ores were at the highest on record in July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (03 Aug) -6.00M vs. Exp. -3.30M (Prev. 5.59M).

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were lower for the session amid an improvement in the risk-tone. Most of the selling action was in the belly of the curve where 5yr yield was up by c.4bps whilst yields at the front and end of the curve were higher by c.3bps. The US sold $34bln in 3yr notes, tailing for the fifth consecutive time, by 0.2bps (in line with recent averages) at a high yield of 2.765%, the highest yield at a 3s auction since May 2007. Overall an unpleasant auction, analysts said: cover was softer than recent averages, and internals were also non-eventful, indirects took the smallest share since December 2016, directs took the smallest portion and dealers were left with the highest share also since December 2016. US 10YR T-notes settled 8+ ticks lower at 119-15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said 2nd tranche of tariffs on USD 16bln of imports from China has been finalized which includes 279 out of the 284 tariff lines proposed in June, while he added the US will begin to collect the additional 25% duties on the Chinese imports from August 23rd.

        "content": "<p>Asia stock markets traded mostly positive as they sustained the momentum from US where the majors eked modest gains with the DJIA led by strength in energy and industrials, while the S&amp;P 500 inched closer towards all-time highs. ASX 200 (+0.3%) was led higher by miners and surprisingly financials despite weaker earnings from Australia&rsquo;s largest lender CBA and scandal-ridden AMP, with shares in the top bank underpinned as its cash profit excluding one-offs was actually higher by 3.7% Y/Y and the Co. also marginally increased its dividend. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) was initially supported throughout most the day by earnings and a weaker currency but then pared gains in late trade, while Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) were mixed with underperformance in the mainland amid increased trade tensions after the US finalized the 2nd tranche of tariffs in which it will impose 25% tariffs on USD 16bln of Chinese goods from August 23rd. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher for most the session despite as prices rebounded from this week&rsquo;s pressure and support near the 150.00 level, while the BoJ were also in the market for nearly JPY 1tln of government bonds concentrated in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.3%) is led higher by miners and surprisingly financials despite weaker earnings results by Australia&rsquo;s largest lender CBA and scandal-ridden AMP, with the top bank gaining as its cash profit excluding one-offs was actually higher by 3.7% Y/Y and the Co. also marginally increased its dividend. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) is underpinned by earnings and a weaker currency, while Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) are subdued with underperformance in the mainland amid looming trade data and on increased tensions after the US finalized the 2nd tranche of tariffs in which it will impose 25% tariffs on USD 16bln of Chinese goods beginning August 23rd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is subdued after the prior day&rsquo;s softness although it remains above the 95.00 level, while its counterparts are mixed as EUR/USD attempts a firmer footing at the 1.1600 handle and with GBP/USD languishing near 11-month lows on Brexit-related woes. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses have held on to recent gains amid a mostly positive risk tone, while antipodeans tread water amid a somewhat indecisive CNY and ahead of the Chinese trade data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher despite the positive risk tone in Tokyo as prices rebound from this week&rsquo;s pressure and support near the 150.00 level, while the BoJ were also in the market for nearly JPY 1tln of government bonds concentrated in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",
