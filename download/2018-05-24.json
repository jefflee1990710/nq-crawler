        "content": "<p>US MARKET WRAP 24 May 2018: Trump pulls out of North Korea summit</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities down, Treasuries up, DXY down, Crude down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Boring ECB minutes, BoE&#39;s Carney warns on Brexit again, Little new in Fedspeak.<br />* AHEAD: Earnings from ADSK, ROST, DXC after-market; Japanese Tokyo CPI overnight; German IFO, UK GDP, US Durables, more BoE Carney, ECB&#39;s Coeure &amp; Liikanen and multiple Fed&#39;s speak including Powell on Friday.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NORTH KOREA: </strong>US President Trump pulled out of the 12 June summit with North Korea leader Kim, adding that the meeting is inappropriate at this time due to the &ldquo;tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in [Kim&rsquo;s] most recent statement.&rdquo; Trump, however, said that he looks very much forward to meeting Kim some day; A White House official later said that back channels for discussions with North Korea remain open, but North Korean rhetoric must change. Separately, a US official suggested further sanctions could be place on North Korea perhaps as soon as next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* IRAN: </strong>US Secretary of State Pompeo says preparations are well under way for further sanctions on Iran, and he hopes that they will be backed by the UN and other nations. Pompeo also again said that regime change was not the US objective. Earlier, Russia&rsquo;s Energy Minister Novak stated that Russia will work with Iran, despite possible US sanctions. And the IAEA again said that Iran has stayed within the limits of uranium enrichment outlined in the 2015 nuclear deal. France President Macron stressed he does not want to renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal; he possible talks to completeness the deal, but not replace it</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>with the exception of Ford and General Motors, auto stocks were getting slammed after yesterday&rsquo;s aftermarket report that the Trump administration was mulling 25% auto tariffs. The decision news has caused some angst even among Republican lawmakers; Senate Finance Committee Chair Hatch says possible US auto tariffs are &ldquo;deeply misguided&rdquo;. On NAFTA, Canada&#39;s Trudeau said US move on possible auto tariffs &ldquo;on even flimsier logical ground than argument in favour of steel and aluminium tariffs&rdquo;, and that the US auto tariffs are clearly linked to NAFTA talks. Trudeau noted there is a long way to go before the US actually sets tariffs on autos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Following reports that UK PM May was to ask EU for an Brexit transition period extension through 2023 in order to avoid a hard Irish border, a UK government source denied the report, and said this proposed exit remains end-2020. Separately, the UK Chancellor Hammond said the UK wants a partnership with the EU on financial services, and on the model of Brexit, said both Brexit customs models are a work in process. Elsewhere, an EU official said there was no discussion of the Irish border issue at the Eurogroup meeting today; Irish officials in parliament continue to demand details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE SPEAK: </strong>BOE Governor Carney said that Brexit is entering a &lsquo;critical phase&rsquo;, BOE has tools to deal with all outcomes; if the process becomes disorderly, BOE could take steps as it did after the Brexit referendum. On rate hikes, Carney again endorsed a gradual path, but said it could be accelerated if growth rises above the trend rate, and if business investment recovers more strongly. Carney again said Q1 weakness was likely temporary, but uncertainty around consumer spending is somewhat greater now due to slower lending and spending, as well as the housing market. Carney also said that the BOE could tolerate a lengthier inflation overshoot, up to a point. BOE deputy governor Ramsden said he is comfortable that Q1 slowdown was temporary and looks for gently increasing rates over the forecast horizon. BOE governor Carney gave some comments in the morning but veered away from monetary policy and the economic outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FEDSPEAK: </strong>Although there was a lot of Fedspeak on the docket today, there was little for traders to sink their teeth into, with the likes of Fed&rsquo;s Dudley (outgoing NY Fed President) staying away from monetary policy comments. The almost ever-present Bostic (voter, dovish) again said he was in the three hikes camp, and sees the neutral rate between 2.25% and 2.75%. Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan (non-voter, neutral) sees the FOMC lifting rates another four rate times before ending the hiking cycle and reaches neutral levels, and added that inflation could run at a rate above 2% for a bit before the Fed takes action. Fed&#39;s Harker (non-voter, dovish) sees 3 rate hikes this year and 3 rate hikes next year, but would be open to a fourth 2018 hike if inflation accelerates. He also said the Fed is getting closer to neutral rate, and sees the Fed ending the hiking cycle in 2019. The NY Fed Primary Dealer Survey was also released and anticipated three more rate hikes this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB MINUTES: </strong>The account of the ECB&rsquo;s meeting saw members agree that the more pronounced weakening of demand cannot be ruled out, and noted that uncertainty of outlook has increased, with the slowdown remaining broad-based. The Council agreed that inflation will gradually reach the desired target. A view that the ECB is close to a sustained adjustment of inflation was also expressed but most disagreed. There was barely any immediate market reaction to the minutes. Note that at the post-meeting press conference, President Draghi said that the ECB discussed little directly on monetary policy &ldquo;per se&rdquo;, and that seems to be reflected in the minutes, and accordingly, the market reaction. The main takeaways of the meeting indicate the ECB is unlikely to change tone in June and strengthen the view that the ECB will wait until July to announce its QE plan, Capital Economics said..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* ECB SPEAK: ECB&rsquo;s Praet says economic conditions are good despite clouds, and that the slowdown in economic indicators reflects supply constraints, though he did concede that there may be a more fundamental problem of confidence. ECB&#39;s Vasiliauskas said that he doesn&#39;t disagree with forecasts of ECB rate hike in six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SARB: </strong>The South Africa Reserve Bank kept both its Prime Rate and Report Rate unchanged at 10.00% and 6.50% respectively, in line with expectations. The tone was fairly hawkish, with the Governor stating that inflation pressures had bottomed-out, and price pressures would firm in the months ahead driven by higher fuel prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>US Jobless Claims came in at 234k beating the consensus at 220k, though revised lower to 223k. The rebound suggests that prior figures around 210k was led by seasonal adjustments. Nonetheless, analysts at Pantheon still see the underlying trend edging lower towards the 220k mark. US Existing Home Sales edged lower to 5.46mln missing expectations at 5.56mln mostly attributed to a fall in re-sale of single family homes which fell by 3% and an absence of inventories. Wells Fargo noted that despite the decline in sales, demand remains strong and prices continue to be sustained, though higher prices and rising interest rates will be determining the strength of buyers&rsquo; demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: </strong>SPX -0.2% at 2727, NDX -0.1% at 6949, DJI -0.3% at 24812.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS:&nbsp;Cons Cyclicals -0.1%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: 0.2%, Energy: -1.7%, Financials: -0.7%, Health Care: -0.3%, Industrials: 0.6%, Materials: -0.4%, Telecom: 0.6%, Tech: -0.1%, Utilities: 0.8%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures continue to shrug-off news flow, and the thin range seen in ES this week continued on Thursday ahead of the Memorial Day long weekend. The 2720-2730 range was prevalent premarket, and after the cash day got underway, news Trump pulled out from the North Korea peace summit in June brought a risk-off tone, sending ES to test 2705 once again; however, later in the session, Trump gave more colour and floated the possibility that a summit could take place at a later day, if North Korea&rsquo;s rhetoric was to become more constructive. ES resumed its drift upwards into the range, moving back into the range of the weekly horizontal drift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sectors, energy lagged on the back of lower oil prices immediately followed by financials, which took a hit amid the broad-based risk-off tone and a flattening yield curve. Utility and telecom held in positive territory as defence sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In earnings, L Brands (LB) was one of the top performers on the S&amp;P after reporting its numbers, despite a slight miss on EPS; whereas BestBuy (BBY) and Hormel Food (HRL) suffered losses above 7% and were the worst performers in the index, the former after cutting its EPS guidance and the latter after reporting a miss on both top and bottom line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In equity specific stories, General Electric (GE) was boosted following reports from CNBC&rsquo;s Faber&rsquo;s suggesting the co. is not looking to cut its dividend again. Celgene (CELG) also printed gains on the back of its USD 3bln repurchase programme announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In M&amp;A news, activist investor Chris Hohn insisted that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) engaged with Comcast (CMCSA) if it is to make a better offer than Disney (DIS) which was at USD 52bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>WTI futures settle USD 1.13 lower at USD 70.71/bbl, Brent futures settle USD 1.01 lower at USD 78.79/bbl. WTI extended losses on Thursday as risk-off sentiment lingered, and losses were exacerbated after US President Trump cancelled the summit with North Korea&rsquo;s Kim; traders also continue to cite the surprise inventory build in the week. Additionally, OPEC&rsquo;s intent to to offset supply disruptions caused by Iran and Venezuela, perhaps by boosting oil output for some producers, remained on traders&rsquo; minds. Russian Energy Minister Novak on Thursday said OPEC+ participants are planning to keep the production deal in place for now, specifying that restrictions on oil production could be eased &quot;softly&quot; if OPEC+ sees oil market balance in June, where gradual oil output recovery will be discussed. Novak currently sees the average oil price at more than USD 60/bbl, and also said Russia is of similar mind with Saudi Arabia on oil output. That wasn&rsquo;t the view of Russian oil producer Lukoil, which believes now is the right time to boost production. Elsewhere, Eastern Libyan oil company AGOCO raised its output to 180k BPD (vs 146k bpd on Wednesday).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 16+ ticks higher at 119-15+. Treasuries edged higher in the session amid growing geopolitical tensions between North Korea and the US which deteriorated risk sentiment and pushed investors into safe havens. The yield curve bull-flattened with most of the buying action focused in the long end of the curve, where 10yr and 30yr yields were down by c.2bps at settlement, seeing 5s30s and 10s30s narrow by c.1bps. The Treasury auctioned 30bln in 7yr notes, stopping-through by 0.5bps at a high yield of 2.930%. The bid-to-cover came in at 2.62 the highest since January. 65.5% was awarded to indirects, dealers took 21.6% whilst directs saw the biggest share since February, just under 13%.

Additionally, OPEC&rsquo;s intent to to offset supply disruptions caused by Iran and Venezuela, perhaps by boosting oil output for some producers, remained on traders&rsquo; minds. Russian Energy Minister Novak on Thursday said OPEC+ participants are planning to keep the production deal in place for now, specifying that restrictions on oil production could be eased &quot;softly&quot; if OPEC+ sees oil market balance in June, where gradual oil output recovery will be discussed. Novak currently sees the average oil price at more than USD 60/bbl, and also said Russia is of similar mind with Saudi Arabia on oil output. That wasn&rsquo;t the view of Russian oil producer Lukoil, which believes now is the right time to boost production. Elsewhere, Eastern Libyan oil company AGOCO raised its output to 180k BPD (vs 146k bpd on Wednesday).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>FX markets initially traded in a more relaxed fashion compared to yesterday&rsquo;s sizeable moves with most majors stuck to their recent ranges in the first half of trade with the USD back below 94.00 in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s FOMC minutes. However, the final stages of trade saw the greatest bout of volatility for the session after news that US President Trump withdrew from peace talks with North Korea which saw USD/JPY break below the earlier low of 109.34 and the 30DMA at 109.20 before stopping short of testing 109.00 to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the EUR was granted some reprieve by the softer USD with EUR/USD reclaiming the 1.1700 handle after yesterday&rsquo;s data-inspired rout with today&rsquo;s ECB minutes offering very little in the way of new information for traders other than the Bank wishing to see as much data as possible before curtailing bonds purchases. Capital Economics subsequently view July as a more opportune time for Draghi and Co. to announce their decision to taper its purchases to zero over the final three months of the year. In terms of prospects for downside in EUR/USD setback are said to be well supported ahead of the 1.1600 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/USD initially reclaimed 1.3400 to the upside after an across the board beat for UK retail sales, allied with upward revisions for 3/4 metrics. However, the support for GBP was relatively short-lived as focus turned to tomorrow&rsquo;s secondary Q1 GDP reading and Brexit related rhetoric amid mixed messages once again coming from UK press and the government after government sources denied reports suggesting UK PM May was to ask the EU for a new transition period until 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the TRY pared a bulk of its gains seen against the USD yesterday after the CBRT held an extraordinary meeting to evaluate recent developments in which it raised the Late Liquidity Window (the lending rate) by 300bps to 16.50%, while it added that it will use strong monetary tightening to support price stability. Given the price action in recent trade, it appears that markets still cast serious doubts over the autonomy of the CBRT and whether attempts to defy Erdogan will be sustainable in the long-term ahead of domestic elections next month.</p>\r\n",

In addition, increasing uncertainty whether the US-North Korea summit will take place added to dampened tone, which in turn has collectively overshadowed a slightly-dovish perceived FOMC minutes. Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) was the underperformer as currency strength sapped exporter sentiment and with automakers reeling from the prospects of the hefty import duties, while ASX 200 (-0.1%) was led lower by financials amid the ongoing banking royal commission grilling on the sector, although broader losses in the index were stemmed by strength in consumer stocks. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) and Hang Seng (+0.3) traded indecisive following a net neutral liquidity operation by the PBoC and mixed signals on trade talks from President Trump who stated discussions are moving along nicely, but then suggested a change in the structure may be needed. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat despite the underperformance seen in Japanese stocks, as prices took a breather from the prior day&rsquo;s gains and with weaker demand seen in today&rsquo;s enhanced-liquidity auction for 10yr-30yr JGBs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Mofcom said it will encourage companies to import more from US and that it welcomes US sending officials to China, although it reiterated that China has not promised to reduce trade deficit by a certain amount and will unswervingly protect its interests.

FTSE 100 (-0.1%) is currently the underperforming bourse amid GBP strength post- Retail Sales. Auto names are being hit by the US import probe, with names such as Daimler (-2.9%), BMW (-2.8%), Volkswagen (-2.8%) and Peugeot (-2.1%) affected negatively by this news. In the M&amp;A scope, the touted Barclays/Standard Chartered merger is stated to have created a rift between Barclays&rsquo; chief executive and chairman. Elsewhere, for Smurfit Kappa, a group of shareholders at the co. have asked the company to enter into talks with International Paper. However, the Smurfit board later reaffirmed their position against the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets thus far are trading in a more relaxed fashion compared to yesterday&rsquo;s sizeable moves seen in the early stages of European trade. Most majors are sticking to their recent ranges with the USD back below 94.00 (DXY -0.2%) in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s FOMC minutes release which was perceived as a tad dovish and did little to change the current &lsquo;gradual hikes&rsquo; backdrop, while it also indicated the Fed would tolerate inflation temporarily above 2% and that there was a range of views on how many rate hikes are required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/JPY remains a key focus for the market with the JPY broadly firmer against its major peers (albeit off best levels) with the major pair sitting just above 109.50 after the move to the downside ran out of steam ahead of the 30DMA seen at 109.20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the EUR has also been a beneficiary from the softer USD with EUR/USD reclaiming the 1.1700 handle after yesterday&rsquo;s data-inspired rout with traders mindful over today&rsquo;s ECB minutes release which will look to see if the official account of proceedings corroborates with Draghi&rsquo;s vague overview of proceedings which left investors unclear as to what the ECB actually discussed at the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP has reclaimed 1.3400 to the upside after an across the board beat for UK retail sales, allied with upward revisions for 3/4 metrics. As can often be the case for UK data, GBP caught a bid ahead of the figures before the official release confirmed what markets had suspected. Markets also chose to look through dour comments from the ONS stating that the underlying position for retail sales is still subdued despite Aprils bounce-back, longer term growth has slowed considerably. With just one more tier 1 release from the UK due this week (Q1 GDP secondary reading tomorrow), market focus will eventually return to Brexit talks with mixed messages once again coming from UK press and the government after government sources denied reports suggesting UK PM May was to ask the EU for a new transition period until 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, NAFTA currencies will likely remain in vogue despite not seeing much in the way of a sustained reaction to news that the US President ordered the Commerce Department to consider a probe on auto imports for national security purposes under Section 232 which was seen as an attempt to prod NAFTA counterparts for a better deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the TRY has pared around half of its gains seen against the USD yesterday after the CBRT held an extraordinary meeting to evaluate recent developments in which it raised the Late Liquidity Window (the lending rate) by 300bps to 16.50%, while it added that it will use strong monetary tightening to support price stability. Given the price action in recent trade, it appears that markets still cast serious doubts over the autonomy of the CBRT and whether attempts to defy Erdogan will be sustainable in the long-term ahead of domestic elections next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixed income markets have pulled back from their post-FOMC levels which were seen after treasuries caught a bid as traders modestly scaled back their expectations for 4 rate hikes this year. EU paper initially saw a choppy start to the session post-Eurex open before the complex gained traction to the downside following an across the board beat for UK retail sales which saw Gilts pressured before finding support just above the 122.00 level. In terms of the follow though for Bunds, the GE 10yr took out support seen at 159.50 before stopping shy of an hourly trend line around 159.40 as highlighted by IFR. Elsewhere across the continent, today&rsquo;s session has seen some much needed reprieve for Italian paper with touted short-covering said to be behind the latest move with markets also likely taking comfort from reports that the 5SM could turn towards a potentially more market-friendly finance minister appointment with Zingales said to be in the running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are mixed as markets focus on US President Trump&rsquo;s protectionist policies. WTI crude (-0.7%) and Brent (-0.8%) continue to extend losses alongside the lacklustre risk tone and following the prior day&rsquo;s surprise DoE crude inventory build. Expectations that OPEC could boost output to offset the supply disruptions caused by Iran and Venezuela remain on traders&rsquo; minds. Meanwhile, gold (+0.5%) continues to creep higher as the yellow metal tracks the softer dollar. Elsewhere, Shanghai copper prices snapped a five-day winning streak and closed lower amid Trump stating that any deal with China will &ldquo;need a different structure&rdquo;. On the flip side, Chinese steel and iron ore futures closed higher, snapping its 7-day losing streak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Energy Novak says that gradual oil output recovery will be discussed in June.

Most majors are sticking to their recent ranges with the USD back below 94.00 (DXY -0.2%) in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s FOMC minutes release which was perceived as a tad dovish and did little to change the current &lsquo;gradual hikes&rsquo; backdrop, while it also indicated the Fed would tolerate inflation temporarily above 2% and that there was a range of views on how many rate hikes are required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/JPY remains a key focus for the market with the JPY broadly firmer against its major peers (albeit off best levels) with the major pair sitting just above 109.50 after the move to the downside ran out of steam ahead of the 30DMA seen at 109.20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the EUR has also been a beneficiary from the softer USD with EUR/USD reclaiming the 1.1700 handle after yesterday&rsquo;s data-inspired rout with traders mindful over today&rsquo;s ECB minutes release which will look to see if the official account of proceedings corroborates with Draghi&rsquo;s vague overview of proceedings which left investors unclear as to what the ECB actually discussed at the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP has reclaimed 1.3400 to the upside after an across the board beat for UK retail sales, allied with upward revisions for 3/4 metrics. As can often be the case for UK data, GBP caught a bid ahead of the figures before the official release confirmed what markets had suspected. Markets also chose ot look through dour comments from the ONS stating that the underlying position for retail sales is still subdued despite Aprils bounce-back, longer term growth has slowed considerably. With just one more tier 1 release from the UK due this week (Q1 GDP secondary reading tomorrow), market focus will eventually return to Brexit talks with mixed messages once again coming from UK press and the government after government sources denied reports suggesting UK PM May was to ask the EU for a new transition period until 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, NAFTA currencies will likely remain in vogue despite not seeing much in the way of a sustained reaction to news that the US President ordered the Commerce Department to consider a probe on auto imports for national security purposes under Section 232 which was seen as an attempt to prod NAFTA counterparts for a better deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the TRY has pared around half of its gains seen against the USD yesterday after the CBRT held an extraordinary meeting to evaluate recent developments in which it raised the Late Liquidity Window (the lending rate) by 300bps to 16.50%, while it added that it will use strong monetary tightening to support price stability. Given the price action in recent trade, it appears that markets still cast serious doubts over the autonomy of the CBRT and whether attempts to defy Erdogan will be sustainable in the long-term ahead of domestic elections next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixed income markets have pulled back from their post-FOMC levels which were seen after treasuries caught a bid as traders modestly scaled back their expectations for 4 rate hikes this year. EU paper initially saw a choppy start to the session post-Eurex open before the complex gained traction to the downside following an across the board beat for UK retail sales which saw Gilts pressured before finding support just above the 122.00 level. In terms of the follow though for Bunds, the GE 10yr took out support seen at 159.50 before stopping shy of an hourly trend line around 159.40 as highlighted by IFR. Elsewhere across the continent, today&rsquo;s session has seen some much needed reprieve for Italian paper with touted short-covering said to be behind the latest move with markets also likely taking comfort from reports that the 5SM could turn towards a potentially more market-friendly finance minister appointment with Zingales said to be in the running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are mixed as markets focus on US President Trump&rsquo;s protectionist policies. WTI crude (-0.5%) and Brent (-0.7%) are lower alongside the lacklustre risk tone and following the prior day&rsquo;s surprise DoE crude inventory build. Expectations that OPEC could boost output to offset the supply disruptions caused by Iran and Venezuela remain on traders&rsquo; minds. Meanwhile, gold (+0.5%) continues to creep higher as the yellow metal tracks the softer dollar. Elsewhere, Shanghai copper prices snapped a five-day winning streak and closed lower amid Trump stating that any deal with China will &ldquo;need a different structure&rdquo;. On the flip side, Chinese steel and iron ore futures closed higher, snapping its 7-day losing streak.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "FX Morning Colour: USD takes a breather. GBP awaits more key data. TRY needs to try harder",
        "content": "<p>FX markets thus far are trading in a more relaxed fashion compared to yesterday&rsquo;s sizeable moves seen in the early stages of European trade. Most majors are sticking to their recent ranges with the USD back below 94.00 (DXY -0.2%) in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s FOMC minutes release which was perceived as a tad dovish and did little to change the current &lsquo;gradual hikes&rsquo; backdrop, while it also indicated the Fed would tolerate inflation temporarily above 2% and that there was a range of views on how many rate hikes are required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/JPY remains a key focus for the market with the JPY broadly firmer against its major peers (albeit off best levels) with the major pair sitting just above 109.50 after the move to the downside ran out of steam ahead of the 30DMA seen at 109.20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the EUR has also been a beneficiary from the softer USD with EUR/USD reclaiming the 1.1700 handle after yesterday&rsquo;s data-inspired rout with traders mindful over today&rsquo;s ECB minutes release which will look to see if the official account of proceedings corroborates with Draghi&rsquo;s vague overview of proceedings which left investors unclear as to what the ECB actually discussed at the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP will once again likely take focus from a data perspective with the second of this week&rsquo;s trio of tier 1 releases from the UK due at 0930BST in the form of Retail Sales. Expectations for the event are relatively mixed with Y/Y readings set to see a downtick from the prior&rsquo;s with the converse trend expected from the M/M metrics. Given yesterday&rsquo;s inflation print and fears over UK growth prospects, it&rsquo;s hard to see how sustained any reprieve for the GBP will be if markets are presented with an upbeat retail report. Furthermore, participants may wait for tomorrow&rsquo;s GDP print before taking an overview of the UK economy and assessing the prospects of rate hikes by the BoE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, NAFTA currencies will likely remain in vogue despite not seeing much in the way of a sustained reaction to news that the US President ordered the Commerce Department to consider a probe on auto imports for national security purposes under Section 232 which was seen as an attempt to prod NAFTA counterparts for a better deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the TRY has pared around half of its gains seen against the USD yesterday after the CBRT held an extraordinary meeting to evaluate recent developments in which it raised the Late Liquidity Window (the lending rate) by 300bps to 16.50%, while it added that it will use strong monetary tightening to support price stability. Given the price action in recent trade, it appears that markets still cast serious doubts over the autonomy of the CBRT and whether attempts to defy Erdogan will be sustainable in the long-term ahead of domestic elections next month.</p>\r\n",

In addition, increasing uncertainty whether the US-North Korea summit will take place added to dampened tone, which in turn has collectively overshadowed a slightly-dovish perceived FOMC minutes. Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) was the underperformer as currency strength sapped exporter sentiment and with automakers reeling from the prospects of the hefty import duties, while ASX 200 (-0.2%) was led lower by financials amid the ongoing banking royal commission grilling on the sector, although broader losses in the index were stemmed by strength in consumer stocks. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) and Hang Seng (Unch.) traded indecisive following a net neutral liquidity operation by the PBoC and mixed signals on trade talks from President Trump who stated discussions are moving along nicely, but then suggested a change in the structure may be needed. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat despite the underperformance seen in Japanese stocks, as prices took a breather from the prior day&rsquo;s gains and with weaker demand seen in today&rsquo;s enhanced-liquidity auction for 10yr-30yr JGBs.</p>\r\n",
