Policy makers anticipated that further gradual rate hikes would be consistent with a sustained economic expansion, strong labour market and near-target inflation. Almost all members considered it appropriate to remove reference in statement to monetary policy being &#39;accommodative&#39;. Participants also noted that economic, policy divergence with other countries were a downside risk as it could further strengthen the USD; additionally, almost all policy makers saw little change in economic outlook, while a few had said that data pointed to stronger growth than they had expected earlier this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May briefed EU27 leaders on Wednesday evening at the EU summit on the current Brexit position. With regards to her speech, European Parliament head Tajani said that there was nothing new in content from PM May. He proposed to extend the post-Brexit transition period to three years, clarifying that PM May gave a &#39;neutral&#39; response when he raised the issue of transition period. Nonetheless there were reports suggesting UK PM May was said to consider extending the Brexit period. Brexit negotiator Barnier announced they are not there yet on a Brexit deal, highlighting the need of much more time, and they will continue to work in the following weeks whilst UK Brexit Minister Raab warned anything other than straightforward approval of a Brexit deal by meaningful vote in Parliament will bring huge uncertainty for businesses. Earlier in the day, an EU official reported the EU are open to debating new ideas relating to the Irish backstop, noting it could publish EU no deal plan in either January or February and reiterating that November 17-18 is no longer a definite summit date. Elsewhere, the FT reported the EU is open to extending Brexit transition by another year if UK PM May accepts a &lsquo;two-tier&rsquo; backstop to avert a border in Northern Ireland although several sources then suggested there is no change to UK&rsquo;s position on the transition period and that they are not looking for an extension as proposed by EU&rsquo;s Negotiator Barnier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Italy&#39;s Finance Minister appeared open to negotiations with the EU stating they are committed to collaborate regarding budget talks. On the EU side, Commissioner Oettinger reiterated familiar narrative that Italy&#39;s submitted draft is not in line with EU guidelines, announcing that a letter from Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Moscovici to Italy should arrive on Thursday or Friday in Rome. Additionally, European Parliament President Tajani stressed that the EU Commission should read the Italian budget before rejecting it; he also noted the Italian government should change some measures in its plan. In response to this,&nbsp; PM Conte said there is not great scope to change the plan. In later comments, EU&#39;s Commissioner Moscovici said the EU Commission has a lot of questions on Italy&#39;s budget. Elsewhere, Italian Government Official Buffagni warned on Wednesday a credit rating downgrade cannot be ruled out and the country must be prepared; he added the premise for EU rejection of budget exists, but the PM Conte will explain to the EU the reasoning for budget choices. As a reminder, Moody&#39;s will publish its credit rating by the end of October, S&amp;P due October 26th whilst Fitch last decision was on Aug 31st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump said China are not ready for trade talks. With regards to trade with the EU, a US Ambassador to the EU warned the commission is intransigent on moving forward regarding trade issues as Trump would not consider that negotiations with the EU are moving satisfactorily. Similarly, US Commerce Secretary Ross announced the US wants EU action on standards, not tariffs alone noting that EU trade chief comments are very discouraging. On the EU side, Commissioner Malmstrom said he is happy to continue the discussions with the US on a new trade deal, but highlighted negotiations have not yet begun; he does not expect a deal with the US in 2018. He added that the intention of the Italian government is to conduct a thorough analysis before making a decision on the EU-Canada trade deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Praet said our forward guidance on rates and reinvestment policy offers an effective combination of instruments, which will support a robust return of inflation to just below 2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BoE&#39;s Cunliffe noted domestic inflation pressures, while strengthening a little, are not yet established at levels consistent with inflation target adding there remains considerable uncertainty about the supply capacity of the UK economy going forward. He warned the case for publishing a rate path for UK interest is not clear cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BUILDING PERMITS </strong>fell in September posting at 1.241mln missing expectations 1.278mln, indicating a steep drop in starts aggravated by hurricane Michael. Multi-family starts were down 6.8% and reversed much of the gains seen in August whilst single-family rose 2.9%, right in the middle of the range. Analysts at Pantheon expect a rebound in sales and permits in the next couple of months though warn the &lsquo;uptick will be short-lived&rsquo; given the ~30bps rise in mortgage rates; they believe housing the housing market has peaked for this cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* HOUSING STARTS </strong>were down 5.3% in September, coming in at 1.201mln, below the 1.22mln consensus. Most of the weakness was in the South most likely as a result of hurricane Florence. Analysts at wells Fargo warn however that higher mortgage rates and constantly rising home prices have reduced affordability significantly. Nonetheless, builder confidence edged up in October and remains elevated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.03% at 2809, NDX +0.03% at 7279, DJI -0.35% at 25709. SECTORS:</strong> Energy -0.70%, Materials -0.83%, Industrials -0.69%, Cons Discretionary -0.69%, Cons Staples +0.48%, Healthcare +0.48%, Financials +0.91%, Tech -0.47%, Telecoms +0.52%, Utilities -0.15%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Netflix (NFLX) surged after beating earnings and smashing expectations of new international subscribers. United Airlines (UAL) jumped following strong earnings and raising its 2018 outlook, this helped fuel optimism for other airlines such as Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines Group (AAL). Chipmaker ASML Holding NV (ASML) was another top mover following strong earnings and outlook. IBM (IBM) was a big loser today on the back of missing its revenue estimates. Vehicle service stocks, AutoZone (AZO), O&rsquo;Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP), found themselves bottom movers too today. Asset manager Northern Trust (NTRS) dipped lower after missing earnings expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 2.17 LOWER AT USD 69.75/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 1.36 LOWER AT USD 80.05/BBL. </strong>Crude was on the defensive on Wednesday, despite energy data on Tuesday from the API reported a surprised draw in crude stocks. The weak risk sentiment in European trade also kept crude on the back foot, and in the US afternoon, as equities went positive, crude struggled to mount a comeback after weekly DOE data showed a larger than expected build in headline oil stocks (crude +6.49mln vs exp +2.167; Cushing +1.776mln; gasoline -2.016mln vs exp -1.074mln; distillates -0.827mln vs exp -1.28mln). Additionally, comments from the US administration with regards to Saudi Arabia (and the case of the &#39;missing&#39; journalist) have suggested that Trump wants to see evidence before endorsing sanctions on the Kingdom and/or key individuals, and that has deflated some of the bid out of Brent which pushed the marker up to USD 87 earlier in the month. Elsewhere, OPEC has requested its members to refrain from mentioning oil prices in policy talks, with a mindful eye on avoiding the risk of US legal action for market manipulation; on the oil market itself, OPEC&#39;s Sec Gen Barkindo said OPEC+ has decided to sustain market balance and is cautiously optimistic that the oil market will remain well supplied, adding that Saudi Arabia has assured that it is &quot;committed , capable and willing&quot; to ensure there is no shortage in the oil market. On the Iranian sanctions front (which kick in on 5 November), India&#39;s Reliance said is not planning on buying Iranian crude in November, due to the US sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 5+ TICKS LOWER AT 118-01+.</strong> There was limited reaction to the FOMC Minutes though the complex was trading at day&rsquo;s lows ahead of the event. Disappointing housing starts and building permits only gave a temporary lift to the complex. Most of the action contracted in belly of the curve were yields were higher by c.2bps at settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The broad Usd and index are not quite over the psychological 95.500 hump, but have set some new highs for the week and extended recent range tops. However, the Greenback&rsquo;s gains are not all self-generated by any means as the Dollar benefits at the expense of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>More post-UK CPI pain for the Pound, not to mention ongoing Brexit-related anxiety ahead of PM May&rsquo;s appearance at the EU summit and bilateral meetings, including with Commissioner Juncker and French President Macron. Cable just survived a serious test of 1.3100 where the top of a band of buying interest is touted down to 1.3080, but remains almost a big figure below Tuesday&rsquo;s post-average earnings peaks, while Eur/Gbp rebounded just over 0.8900 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, EUR: </strong>The Loonie gleaned no real support at all from better than expected Canadian manufacturing sales data as tech supports vs the Greenback were tested just ahead of 1.3000 and crude prices fell amidst a broad downturn in risk assets ahead of November WTI option expiries and DoE inventories. Similarly, the single currency slipped through some downside chart levels amidst ongoing Italian budget angst and looks set to close below a daily cloud (1.1546) having breached 1.1525 briefly and marginally.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Unable to maintain short covering momentum as risk sentiment soured and its US peer prospered, with Aud/Usd pulling back further from 2 week highs circa 0.7160 and towards decent option expiry interest at 0.7125 (1.1 bn) around the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, NZD, JPY: </strong>Narrowly mixed vs the Usd, as the Franc remained relatively contained between 0.9900-40, but Kiwi also lost traction like its antipodean counterpart and retreated from 0.6600 to 0.6560 before ticking up again. However, the Jpy continued to claw back lost ground and regain its safe-haven allure to revisit 112.05 from 112.40 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM:</strong> Against the broadly weaker trend in regional currencies, the Try erased and reversed some losses from almost 5.7150 to 5.6700 on the prospect that some US sanctions imposed due to Pastor Brunson may be lifted, per Secretary of State Pompeo.</p>\r\n",

The weak risk sentiment in European trade also kept crude on the back foot, and in the US afternoon, as equities went positive, crude struggled to mount a comeback after weekly DOE data showed a larger than expected build in headline oil stocks (crude +6.49mln vs exp +2.167; Cushing +1.776mln; gasoline -2.016mln vs exp -1.074mln; distillates -0.827mln vs exp -1.28mln). Additionally, comments from the US administration with regards to Saudi Arabia (and the case of the &#39;missing&#39; journalist) have suggested that Trump wants to see evidence before endorsing sanctions on the Kingdom and/or key individuals, and that has deflated some of the bid out of Brent which pushed the marker up to USD 87 earlier in the month. Elsewhere, OPEC has requested its members to refrain from mentioning oil prices in policy talks, with a mindful eye on avoiding the risk of US legal action for market manipulation; on the oil market itself, OPEC&#39;s Sec Gen Barkindo said OPEC+ has decided to sustain market balance and is cautiously optimistic that the oil market will remain well supplied, adding that Saudi Arabia has assured that it is &quot;committed , capable and willing&quot; to ensure there is no shortage in the oil market. On the Iranian sanctions front (which kick in on 5 November), India&#39;s Reliance said is not planning on buying Iranian crude in November, due to the US sanctions.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>FOMC September meeting minutes will be published on 17 October 2018 at 1400 EST/1900 BST; to download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/20321/download\">here</a>.</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>RATE/NEUTRAL RATE: </strong>FOMC hiked rates by 25bps at its September meeting, as was expected, and removed the reference in its statement that policy is &#39;accommodative&#39;. Forecasts were little changed, though the central bank&#39;s new dot sees rates at between 3.25-3.50% in 2021, matching the level of its 2020 projection, hinting that the FOMC has put a soft end-date to its hiking cycle. Additionally, it appears that the FOMC does not intend to raise rates above its estimate of neutral (the broadest estimate of the Fed&#39;s neutral rate range, determined from FOMC speakers over the past few months, is between 2.50-3.50%). In his press conference, Powell endorsed a gradual approach, and noted that some participants saw a moderate overshoot of neutral rate.&nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li><strong>FED INDEPENDENCE: </strong>On the central bank&rsquo;s independence, he claimed the Fed does not consider political factors when deciding policy as it focuses on the mandate, following the recent criticisms of US President Trump. Some argued that the Fed&#39;s chair Powell tilted hawkish in a recent moderated discussion as a shot across Trump&#39;s bow, a defiant move to signal the Fed&#39;s independence. (Powell said &quot;interest rates are still accommodative, but we&rsquo;re gradually moving to a place where they&rsquo;ll be neutral,&quot; and added that &quot;[the FOMC] may go past neutral. But we&rsquo;re a long way from neutral at this point, probably&quot; - comments which were taken as hawkish by rates traders). However, SGH Macro are dismissive of this view: &quot;We do not think his remarks were meant as a hardening per se of a hawkish messaging on the Fed&#39;s already presumed base rate path. He was instead delivering pretty much the same message but speaking to a more lay audience,&quot; SGH says, adding &quot;Powell in fact has made a point of not only speaking in plain English but also reaching to a wider public than the markets or any particular tweeters.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>FORWARD GUIDANCE: </strong>Related to the neutral rate and staff economic projections, UBS says there will likely be discussion of its intention of dialing back forward guidance, &quot;that theme has come out in Powell&#39;s speeches, but may increasingly show up more broadly,&quot; UBS says.&nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li><strong>US ECONOMY: </strong>At his press conference, Powell sounded upbeat about US economic prospects, defining this as a particularly bright moment for the US economy. Powell noted dropping the &#39;accommodative&#39; language was a sign that monetary policy is proceeding in line with the Fed&#39;s expectations, and does not signal a change of the rate path. He however noted that if inflation surprised to the upside, the Fed would have to move quicker, but stressed he did not see that happening; similarly, a slowing down in the economy or in the financial conditions is something the Fed would react to, Powell said.&nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li><strong>TRADE WARS: </strong>Powell said trade was a downside risk, though the effects of trade tensions have been relatively small so far. The Fed chair referred to the recent Beige Book, which contained many references to difficulties agents were facing on the back of trade relations. In terms of the inflationary impact, Powell said tariffs might provide a basis to companies to raise prices, while noting the uncertainty that trade still represents.&nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li><strong>BALANCE SHEET: </strong>HSBC will be keeping an eye on comments relating to balance sheet policy after the FOMC&#39;s August meeting minutes stated that the central bank will begin discussions on its balance sheet policy in the fall. &quot;A drift upward in the federal funds rate within the FOMC&#39;s target range suggests that bank reserves are becoming less abundant, raising questions about how long the Fed can go on reducing its balance sheet,&quot; HSBC said.</li>\r\n  <li><em><strong>If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the Research Suite section of the portal.

        "content": "<p>Not even a notable pause or knee-jerk on the broadly weak US housing data, as core bonds continue to climb and clear more upside resistance levels, with Bunds just registering a fresh Eurex high at 159.24 and Gilts following suit to print 121.12 (+52 and +49 ticks on the day). US Treasuries have also emerged from sub-par terrain and the curve is re-flattening a tad, as the reverse trend intensifies in Italy and BTPs retreat further from 121.71 to 120.33. Turning to the currency market, the Dollar is gaining more momentum or headway to the detriment of others as the DXY attempts a more assertive bounce from the low 95.000+ area that has been capping the index. Back to debt futures, next upside tech objectives for the 10 year EU benchmarks come in around 159.46-53 and 121.24.</p>\r\n",

Ahead of its publication, reports have suggested that the Treasury is concerned about the recent CNY depreciation and are monitoring developments, a sentiment that was expressed by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin in an interview recently. Goldman Sachs does not expect the US to name any nation as a currency manipulator, though it does see China, Japan, Germany, Korea, India and Switzerland remaining on the Treasury&#39;s monitoring list, and it also suggests Taiwan could be re-added to the list. &quot;For China, officials have been taking steps to stem FX depreciation. That does not preclude being named a manipulator, but it certainly makes it less likely,&quot; GS says, noting that &quot;the actual policy consequences of being named a &#39;manipulator&#39; are minor relative to the tariff actions the US has already taken. Nonetheless, labelling China could be considered another escalation of the bilateral trade conflict.&quot; Goldman also suggests that another possibility in this report, or perhaps in future reports, is that the US could expand the list of countries that it considers which could shift the focus onto smaller nations in Asia like Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, GS says, countries that have recently increased exports to the US and meet at least two of the criteria. (The three criteria are (1) a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States is one that is at least $20bln; (2) a material current account surplus is one that is at least 3% of GDP; (3) persistent, one-sided intervention occurs when net purchases of foreign currency are conducted repeatedly and total at least 2% of an economy&#39;s GDP over a 12-month period.)</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.2%) gained from the open with the tech sector mimicking the outperformance of its counterpart stateside, although miners underperformed as BHP suffered from weak quarterly output figures. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) benefitted from the broad optimism and edged closer towards the 23k level, while Hang Seng was closed for holiday and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) was higher amid some quasi-measures including a relaxation of FX related regulations to promote trade and facilitate investment.

On the flip side, the tech sector outperforms following optimistic earnings from ASML (+4.0%) which in turn lifted the likes of STMicroelectionics (+3.0%) and Infineon (+1.0%) in sympathy. Elsewhere, Fresenius SE (-11.9%)&nbsp; rests at near the foot of the DAX after the company cut guidance, while Crest Nicholson (-4.7%) is firmly in the red amid a profit warning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Having been boosted by above average earnings yesterday, softer than forecast UK CPI has undermined Sterling in the run up to Wednesday&rsquo;s EU summit on Brexit and pre-dinner speech by PM May. Cable is now down around one full point from 1.3200+ peaks as a result, while Eur/Gbp is retesting 0.8800. Note, bids are said to be waiting at 1.3100 and 1.3080 if the low so far circa 1.3130 is breached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/EUR - All moderately weaker vs the Usd, but relatively rangebound as the DXY remains top-heavy above 95.000, with the Loonie still pivoting 1.2950, the Franc holding just below 0.9900 and single currency not deviating far from 1.1550 within 1.1500-1.1600 parameters more broadly. Technically, 1.1624 is a 50% Fib and on the flip-side a close below daily support at 1.1546 could be deemed bearish for Eur/Usd in the short term.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY/NZD - Marginal outperformance against the Greenback, but again very confined ahead of FOMC minutes, with the Aud benefiting from a short squeeze overnight and climbing above 0.7150, but now drifting back down and perhaps wary about a hefty 1.1 bn option expiry at the 0.7125 strike. Meanwhile, the Jpy has recovered from 112.40 lows as heavy supply up to 112.50 continues to provide support and the Kiwi has retested 0.6600, but remains capped near the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - Extending gains on bullish Swedish impulses via strong inflation data and Riksbank policy implications, as Eur/Sek breaches 10.3000 support and opens up the next downside chart target at 10.2855 (close to 200 DMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil trades in the red and in close proximity to recent lows with WTI approaching USD 71.50/bbl to the downside while Brent edges further below USD 82.00/bbl following a surprise draw on yesterday&rsquo;s API crude data. OPEC Secretary General Barkindo emerged stating that OPEC+ have decided to sustain market balance and are cautiously optimistic the oil market will remain well supplied, while Saudi are to ensure there is no shortage in the oil market. Traders will be eying the weekly DoE crude inventory data release along with any developments surrounding journalist Khashogghi who went missing at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Elsewhere, metals are mixed with gold mirroring dollar action while copper came off lows. Separately, mining giant BHP has reported a 8% increase in Q1 iron ore production on the back of strong Chinese demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC Secretary General Barking said Saudi has assured it is &quot;committed , capable and willing&quot; to ensure there is no shortage in the oil market, while he added OPEC+ have decided to sustain market balance and are cautiously optimistic the oil market will remain well supplied. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (8 Oct) -2.13mln vs. Exp. +2.2mln (Prev. +9.75mln). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still not quite enough momentum to reach 121.00, but the 10 year UK benchmark extended its pre-UK inflation data Liffe peak by 3 ticks at 120.96 before topping out again, while Short Sterling futures are now a more uniform 1-2 ticks above parity and the curve less flat as a result. In truth, the headline CPI miss will not materially alter the BoE policy outlook from a Brexit vigil and wait-and-see stance, while PPI metrics were firmer than expected. Elsewhere, Bunds also advanced further from early Eurex highs to touch 159.00, but failed to breach that level and expose the next chart resistance circa 159.15, but Italian BTPs have lost more ground after their near &frac34; point advance from 121.00 as a government official acknowledges the prospect of EU budget disapproval and negative credit rating potential. Meanwhile, US Treasuries remain a tad softer around the middle of relatively tight overnight session ranges ahead of housing data and FOMC minutes.</p>\r\n",

On the flip side, the tech sector outperforms following optimistic earnings from ASML (+4.0%) which in turn lifted the likes of STMicroelectionics (+3.0%) and Infineon (+1.0%) in sympathy. Elsewhere, Fresenius SE (-11.9%)&nbsp; rests at near the foot of the DAX after the company cut guidance, while Crest Nicholson (-4.7%) is firmly in the red amid a profit warning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having been boosted by above average earnings yesterday, softer than forecast UK CPI has undermined Sterling in the run up to Wednesday&rsquo;s EU summit on Brexit and pre-dinner speech by PM May. Cable is now down around one full point from 1.3200+ peaks as a result, while Eur/Gbp is retesting 0.8800. Note, bids are said to be waiting at 1.3100 and 1.3080 if the low so far circa 1.3130 is breached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All moderately weaker vs the Usd, but relatively rangebound as the DXY remains top-heavy above 95.000, with the Loonie still pivoting 1.2950, the Franc holding just below 0.9900 and single currency not deviating far from 1.1550 within 1.1500-1.1600 parameters more broadly. Technically, 1.1624 is a 50% Fib and on the flip-side a close below daily support at 1.1546 could be deemed bearish for Eur/Usd in the short term.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marginal outperformance against the Greenback, but again very confined ahead of FOMC minutes, with the Aud benefiting from a short squeeze overnight and climbing above 0.7150, but now drifting back down and perhaps wary about a hefty 1.1 bn option expiry at the 0.7125 strike. Meanwhile, the Jpy has recovered from 112.40 lows as heavy supply up to 112.50 continues to provide support and the Kiwi has retested 0.6600, but remains capped near the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending gains on bullish Swedish impulses via strong inflation data and Riksbank policy implications, as Eur/Sek breaches 10.3000 support and opens up the next downside chart target at 10.2855 (close to 200 DMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still not quite enough momentum to reach 121.00, but the 10 year UK benchmark extended its pre-UK inflation data Liffe peak by 3 ticks at 120.96 before topping out again, while Short Sterling futures are now a more uniform 1-2 ticks above parity and the curve less flat as a result. In truth, the headline CPI miss will not materially alter the BoE policy outlook from a Brexit vigil and wait-and-see stance, while PPI metrics were firmer than expected. Elsewhere, Bunds also advanced further from early Eurex highs to touch 159.00, but failed to breach that level and expose the next chart resistance circa 159.15, but Italian BTPs have lost more ground after their near &frac34; point advance from 121.00 as a government official acknowledges the prospect of EU budget disapproval and negative credit rating potential. Meanwhile, US Treasuries remain a tad softer around the middle of relatively tight overnight session ranges ahead of housing data and FOMC minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil trades in the red and in close proximity to recent lows with WTI approaching&nbsp; USD 71.50/bbl to the downside while Brent edges further below USD 82.00/bbl following a surprise draw on yesterday&rsquo;s API crude data. OPEC Secretary General Barkindo emerged stating that OPEC+ have decided to sustain market balance and are cautiously optimistic the oil market will remain well supplied, while Saudi are to ensure there is no shortage in the oil market. Traders will be eying the weekly DoE crude inventory data release along with any developments surrounding journalist Khashogghi who went missing at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Elsewhere, metals are mixed with gold mirroring dollar action while copper came off lows. Separately, mining giant BHP has reported a 8% increase in Q1 iron ore production on the back of strong Chinese demand.</p>\r\n",

In truth, the headline CPI miss will not materially alter the BoE policy outlook from a Brexit vigil and wait-and-see stance, while PPI metrics were firmer than expected. Elsewhere, Bunds also advanced further from early Eurex highs to touch 159.00, but failed to breach that level and expose the next chart resistance circa 159.15, while US Treasuries remain a tad softer around the middle of relatively tight overnight session ranges ahead of housing data and FOMC minutes.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equity markets are higher across the board as the region gets a tail wind from the earnings-fuelled momentum in US, where all majors gained over 2% and the tech sector led the advances after strong earnings including Netflix which beat on EPS and subscriber additions. ASX 200 (+1.1%) gained from the open with the tech sector mimicking the outperformance of its counterpart stateside, although miners underperformed as BHP suffered from weak quarterly&nbsp;output figures. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+1.5%) benefitted from the broad optimism and edged closer towards the 23k level, while Hang Seng was closed for holiday and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) is higher amid some quasi-measures including a relaxation of FX related regulations to promote trade and facilitate investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FX space is quiet overnight amid a lack of tier-1 data and as currency markets consolidate from the prior day&rsquo;s price action. As such, the DXY is flat and remains in close proximity to the 95.00 level, while EUR/USD has kept to within a tight range and GBP/USD has also stabilized from yesterday&rsquo;s swings which were triggered by ongoing Brexit uncertainty. Elsewhere, USD/JPY has held on to the risk-inspired gains and antipodeans are mixed with AUD/USD slightly underperforming amid cross-related flows as well as a softer CNY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat as focus is centred on riskier assets but with downside also stemmed amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for a respectable JPY 1.2tln of JGBs.</p>\r\n",
