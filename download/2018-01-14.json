Banks began reporting their numbers, with JPMorgan reporting a top and bottom-line beat; Wells Fargo, however, could only beat on the Adj EPS front, with revenues falling slightly short of expectations. The former&rsquo;s trading revenues were glum, as expected, with fixed income trading off by over 30%, while equities trading revenues were flat. Consumer discretionary led the gains after retail sales increased. Energy was also higher, tracking crude prices. On the other end of the scale, utilities were the laggard, once again.

Corporate supply had been healthy for the week, with high-grade raising $32bln, according to Reuters. US 10-Year T-Note Futures settle 6 ticks lower at 122-30.</p>\r\n",
