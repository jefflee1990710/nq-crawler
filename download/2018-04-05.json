Treasuries had been lower from the off, before catching an early bid amid a chunky block buy prior to the CME open. IFR noted that volume was notably light ahead of Friday&rsquo;s Nonfarm Payrolls report. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX: </strong>USD strength ahead of Friday&rsquo;s NFP<br />The USD strengthened against most of its major counterparts particularly GBP and JPY. Cable tumbled after the UK services PMI tumbled to an almost two-year low, although this was partly linked to disruption from the Beast from the East, no not Vladimir Putin, but a vicious storm that brought heavy snow. The surveys indicated growth of below 0.3% for the quarter, down from the already sluggish 0.4% seen in Q4 2017. The JPY fell amid improving risk sentiment as equities rallied again, with USD/JPY rising back above 107.00. The TRY dropped to a record low against the USD, initially amid reports that Deputy PM Simsek was to resign, however, Simsek wrote on social media that he will work until his last breath to rebuild Turkey, quashing rumours that he&rsquo;s set to quit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>WTI futures (May) settle 17 cents higher at $63.54; Brent futures (June) settle 31 cents higher at $68.33<br />WTI and Brent crude futures both closed in positive territory amid improving risk appetite and as Larry Kudlow played down fears of an all out trade war. Oil prices were benefitting &ldquo;as signs emerge that the trade dispute is easing between the U.S. and China,&quot; wrote Commerzbank. The broad USD strength did seem to cap gains in oil prices but overall news in the energy sector was relatively light, although the Qatar energy minister said that OPEC should maintain production cuts.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European bourses opened higher with 88% of the Stoxx 600 in the green as it sustained the momentum and risk appetite from Wall St. and Asia. The improvement in sentiment was aided by comments from White House economic adviser Kudlow stating that the US measures were a form of trade negotiations and that Trump&rsquo;s tariffs on China are all proposals, while he added that back-channel talks with China were occurring. All sectors sit firmly in the green with material and technology names top-performers. Financials are also higher as banks benefit from the US 10y yield rising back above 2.80%. In terms of stock specifics, Telecom Italia (+3.0%) is higher on sources reporting Italian state lender CDP is to purchase a 5% stake in the company. Lagging behind, Just Eat (-3.3%) is failing to deliver on the back of a downgrade by JP Morgan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Index looks a bit more comfortable back above the psychological 90.000 level and with the Greenback firmer vs all G10 peers, bar the Loonie that continues to glean encouragement from broadly constructive NAFTA developments (negotiations said to be progressing well, albeit with some major issues yet to be resolved, and on track for an agreement in principle by mid-April). A truce or rather a time out for talks between the US and China on proposed import tariffs has calmed trade war fears, underpinning the Dollar and risk sentiment in general to the detriment of traditional safe-havens. However, the DXY really needs to reclaim 90.500 and above to maintain momentum vs highs around 90.335 thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bucking the broader trend due to the aforementioned positive NAFTA impulses and back near recent peaks vs the Usd within 1.2780-45 parameters ahead of Canadian (and US) trade data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also a bit of an outlier among majors with firmer than forecast Swiss CPI data supporting the Franc between 0.9600-30 and 1.1790-1.1805 vs the Usd and Eur respectively, but the Chf still not really trading like a safe-haven amidst market talk of SNB intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another mover on independent factors, or to be precise in the run up to a much weaker than expected UK services PMI, with Cable drifting back from yet another test of 1.4100 resistance/multiple tops to around 1.4035 and Eur/Gbp nudging towards 0.8740.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Losing more ground from recent 1.2300+ peaks vs the Usd and seriously probing stops around 1.2250 ahead of more layered bids in the 1.2240-20 area and decent tech support at the upper end of that range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also extending losses vs the Usd and the headline pair probing a bit higher above 107.00, but not quite challenging offers said to be sitting at 107.20 and 107.30, which could expose stops above the 107.33 level (55 DMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhat contrasting fortunes for the Antipodean units continue with market observers noting macro offers in the cross, which remains around 1.0550 or just below, while the Aud has been unable to derive support from data again and recoils from another 0.7700+ venture, as better than consensus trade data was tainted by a downgrade to the previous month and weak internals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only fleeting respite for Gilts in wake of another significant UK PMI miss, and this time from the key services sector, as the Beast from the East appears to have wreaked havoc in keeping with the destruction caused in construction activity. Hence, discounting the weather UK debt has quickly returned to trading off broader risk sentiment and alongside core bond peers are conceding more ground amidst heavy supply from the Eurozone. The 10 year UK benchmark has now been down to 122.14, -56 ticks on the day, with Bunds as low as 158.95, -52 ticks, and US Treasuries are seeing more pronounced/deeper bear steepening.

Gold has lost support from safe-haven flows with prices pulling back from one-week highs as the risk tone returns to the market. Copper traded sideways during Asia hours with its largest consumer China shut for the rest of the week due to holidays, while improved market sentiment lifted London copper, which has recouped the losses seen in the previous session. Elsewhere, Shanghai aluminium stocks tumbled for the first time in nine months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The&nbsp;RBI&nbsp;is to conclude its first bi-monthly policy meeting for the 2018-2019 fiscal year later, where the central bank is expected to stand pat with all economists surveyed unanimously anticipating the central bank to maintain the Repurchase Rate at 6.00%, Reverse Repo Rate at 5.75% and Cash Reserve Ratio at 4.00%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the one-sided expectations for today&rsquo;s announcement, forecasts are less clear-cut for what the central bank may do throughout the financial year as one survey showed 6 out of 15 economists expect a hike, 2 were calling for a cut, 4 forecast a prolonged pause by the&nbsp;RBI&nbsp;and 3 anticipate the&nbsp;RBI&nbsp;to be data dependent. Furthermore, a separate larger poll suggested 60% were predicting the central bank to shift to a policy tightening stance by year-end and that the consensus was for a 25bps hike during Q1 2019 vs. Prev. forecast for a first hike during H2 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent data releases from India hints to a lack of urgency to adjust policy rates as India CPI for February eased to 4.4% vs. Exp. 4.7% (Prev. 5.1%) and although this effectively increases the scope for rate cuts, stronger Industrial Production growth at 7.5% vs. Exp. 6.4% (Prev. 7.1%) would suggest that looser policy is currently unwarranted. Furthermore, the backdrop of policy normalization or intentions thereof, amongst some of the major global central banks would also be a hindrance for the&nbsp;RBI&nbsp;to lower rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent notable development which has been the centre of focus in India was the bank loan fraud in which the country&rsquo;s 2nd biggest lender Punjab National Bank discovered the largest loan fraud in the nation&rsquo;s history. This resulted to the&nbsp;RBI&nbsp;banning the use of Letters of Undertaking and Letters of Comfort as trade credits for imports, which in turn raised concerns for businesses and that importers&rsquo; costs would increase as they would now need more USD for payments to overseas suppliers which would also pressure INR. Therefore, the uncertainty following the ban of these guarantees would be another factor likely to persuade the&nbsp;RBI&nbsp;to maintain a wait-and-see approach in the near-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another fall-out of the banking fraud scandal, was the differences between the government and&nbsp;RBI&nbsp;regarding regulatory powers over public sector banks in which the government dismissed calls by the central bank for increased authority over the nation&rsquo;s banking sector. This refusal by the government to the&nbsp;RBI&rsquo;s request may somewhat place a dampener on their relationship and could in turn lessen the&nbsp;RBI&rsquo;s susceptibility to conform next time the government pressures again for rate cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s decision is due out at 10:00BST and as forecasts are one-sided for no changes in rates, focus will turn to the accompanying statement for any hints on the central bank&rsquo;s thinking and whether there is any shift from its current neutral stance. As a reminder, the impact to INR from&nbsp;RBI&nbsp;announcements are not so straight-forward as dovish surprises have in the past underpinned the currency instead of weakening it, which is due to the suspected inflows of funds on the back of more favourable policies.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>All change again for the 10 year German benchmark and counterpart core bonds as Wall Street staged another impressive recovery rally on a marked swing in sentiment surrounding the US-China trade spat after both sides sought to soothe fears over extensive import tariff lists. In short, the proposals are statements of intent and designed to form the basis of talks that are already underway behind closed doors, so there is room for negotiation before any implementation. As usual, Bunds have largely shrugged off German factory orders that are relatively old in terms of a reference point given more timely economic indicators already released (ie final March manufacturing PMIs), and following an initial markdown to 159.22 from Wednesday&rsquo;s 159.47 Eurex close price action has continued mostly on the downside within a 159.15-25 range. Ahead, services PMIs may offer some macro impetus along with Eurozone PPI, but for debt markets hefty Spanish and French supply is far more likely to impact via pre-auction hedging and unwinding after the results.</p>\r\n",

Comments from NEC Director Kudlow helped, after he stated that the US measures were a form of trade negotiations, and back-channel talks with China were occurring; analysts, have also noted that the impact of the initially announced tariffs seems manageable, and perhaps markets have over reacted; the fear arises from any escalation which could lead to further more destructive measures.

Conversely, <strong>gold</strong> loss some shine and weakened on safe-haven outflows, while <strong>copper</strong> traded sideways during Asia hours with its largest consumer China shut for the rest of the week due to holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk509518493\">SocGen said it sees a 70% chance of Iran oil sanctions coming back into effect by May 12<sup>th</sup> which would remove 500K bpd of Iranian crude supply from the market.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was modest bear-steepening along the Treasury curve, after the pre-market risk-averse sentiment was shaken-off. Again, block trades in TYM8 helped some of the selling bias, as yesterday. Decent ADP employment data (beat expectations, prior revised up) has raised hopes of a stellar NFP report on Friday, seeing Tsys back-off highs, though analysts offered the usual caution about reading too much into the ADP data as a guide for the official NFP data. Additionally, risk sentiment was stoked in the US morning after constructive comments by US NEC Director Kudlow, where he intimated that the US and Chinese were in discussions over trade, and the market shouldn&rsquo;t over-react to the initial, small steps taken to fight against China&rsquo;s alleged theft of US intellectual property. T-Note futures (June 2018) settled half a tick lower at 120-26+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump signed order to deploy the National Guard to its southern border, while there were earlier reports that Mexico Senate rejected US President Trump&#39;s border militarization plan and asked the government to halt migration cooperation with the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There were reports that President was said to soften NAFTA autos proposal and lower 85% demand on some auto parts</strong>, while White House Economic Adviser Kudlow said that NAFTA negotiations are proceeding rather well. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NAFTA negotiators are said to be reviewing alternatives on origin rules for autos, with US officials showing a more flexible approach to the issue according to sources</strong>. In related news, Canadian NAFTA negotiators are said to be open to US ideas on agreeing on a deal but are skeptical on completing the remaining chapters in the next 2 weeks as big gaps remain. However, they think a symbolic agreement in principle showing consensus on some important issues is possible, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Ambassador to Canada Craft said they have every confidence that US and Canada will fix NAFTA, while Canada Ambassador to the US MacNaughton, said &#39;a lot of issues&#39; remain on NAFTA but noted that he is pleased with the positive tone of discussions.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks traded mostly higher as the region sustained the momentum from Wall St where all major indices recovered from the initial losses seen after US and China&rsquo;s tit-for-tat tariff announcements, with fears later soothed as the US hinted at a willingness for negotiations. The improvement in sentiment was helped by comments from White House economic adviser Kudlow who stated that the US measures were a form of trade negotiations and that Trump&rsquo;s tariffs on China are all proposals, while he added that back-channel talks with China were occurring. Furthermore, the White House noted there will be a couple of months before China tariffs are implemented with the review period ongoing, and some analysts also viewed the impact from proposed tariffs to be manageable. As such, ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) were higher with strength in Australia&rsquo;s largest weighted financials sector leading the local index, and the Japanese benchmark was among the outperformers as exporters cheered a weaker JPY. Elsewhere, KOSPI (+1.6%) also advanced and Straits Times Index (+1.8%) saw its largest intraday gain in over a year alongside the rising tide across stocks, while mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan remained shut for holidays. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued following losses in T-notes and with safe-havens shunned amid the heightened risk appetite, while an enhanced-liquidity auction in the super-long end also kept participants side-lined during early trade and after results showed weaker demand.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade mostly higher as the region sustains the momentum from Wall St where all major indices recovered from the initial losses seen from US and China&rsquo;s tit-for-tat tariff announcements, with fears later soothed as US hinted at a willingness for negotiations. The improvement in sentiment was helped by comments from White House economic adviser Kudlow who stated that the US measures were a form of trade negotiations and that Trump&rsquo;s tariffs on China are all proposals, while he added that back-channel talks with China were occurring. Furthermore, the White House noted there will be a couple of months before China tariffs are implemented with the review period ongoing, and some analysts also viewed the impact from proposed tariffs to be manageable. As such, ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.7%) are higher with strength in Australia&rsquo;s largest weighted financials sector leading the local index, and the Japanese benchmark is among the outperformers as exporters cheer a weaker JPY. Elsewhere, KOSPI (+1.4%) is also lifted and Straits Times Index (+2.0%) saw its largest intraday gain in over a year alongside the rising tide across stocks, while mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan remained shut for holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses extend on their upside amid the heightened-risk appetite with the pair eyeing the 107.00 level to the upside, while CHF was also subdued by the safe-haven outflows with USD/CHF reclaiming the 0.9600 handle. Elsewhere, the other majors trade range-bound amid a flat greenback and several holiday closures, while AUD/USD slightly pulled back and failed to benefit from a wider than expected trade surplus as the data also showed a downward revision to the prior and exports flattening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued following losses in T-notes and with safe-havens shunned amid the heightened risk appetite, while an enhanced-liquidity auction in the super-long end is also likely to keep participants side-lined during early trade.</p>\r\n",
