European Council President Tusk said to have held &quot;long and frank discussion&quot; with the British PM and showed willingness to help but the question remains how. Meanwhile, there were conflicting reports from ERG sources suggesting that 48 letters to trigger a vote of no confidence in her leadership have been submitted by MPs; some have suggested the number has been reached while others believe they are close to hitting the 48 letters threshold. In late trade, a UK senior government source is expecting a confidence vote imminently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> China was said to make a proposal in order to cut tariffs on US auto imports to 15% from 40%; while the offer has been submitted for review, the decision has not been finalised and could still change. This followed Trump&rsquo;s tweet post-G20 meeting announcing that China had agreed to cut auto tariffs, a concession that wasn&rsquo;t however reflected in the official statement. As such, market participants were unclear whether China was truly committed to achieving a deal with regards to autos, or whether US President Trump had embellished the outcome of his meeting with China. Today&#39;s news suggested that such an agreement was discussed, and as such, is positive in terms of taking steps to resolve the trade dispute. Elsewhere, the Washington Post reported that the Trump administration is to condemn China over hacking and economic espionage, escalating tensions between superpowers. Also, US House Representatives have introduced a bill that would ban the sale of US goods to Chinese telecom firms who are in violation of US export and sanctions laws. With regards to the Huawei CFO arrest, the Canadian Judge is set to make a decision on the bail at 1400 pacific time (2200 GMT) while earlier reports suggested the US State Department is mulling travel advisory for China to caution the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; ITALY: </strong>An Italian Government source stated that there are &quot;excellent&quot; chances that the EU will not discipline Italy if they provide a deficit/GDP target for 2019 of 2.0% though neither party wants to lower deficit/GDP target to below 2.2%. &nbsp;Finance Minister Tria said once again the government will not make major changes to the budget; adds Italy&#39;s fiscal targets may be revised and is confident an EDP can be avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FRANCE:</strong> The European Commission announced it will revise the 2019 French budget in the spring when economic forecasts will also be released. The recent measures introduced to calm the Yellow Vests protests are anticipated to have an impact on the budget figure; these include fuel-tax cuts, a monthly bonus for those on minimum wages, and no extra taxes for those retired and earning less than EUR 2,000. The Budget Minister currently sees the 2019 public deficit at 2.5% of GDP (excluding the one-off impact of payroll tax rebate transformation) though noted that expenditure could amount to around EUR 10bln, adding 0.5 percentage point to the 2019 deficit and boost the gap to 3.4 percent of GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US PPI</strong> rose 0.1% in November, decelerating from the 0.6% in October amid a slump in oil prices. Looking at the other components, airline fares were up 2.3% while transportation costs by road and rail rose around 1% on the back of labour and truck shortages. The Core measure rose 0.3% (Oct. 0.5%) and may have peaked for this cycle. Analysts at Pantheon note that oil prices have a greater influence on PPI inflation compared to CPI or PCE and argue that &ldquo;the plunge in crude prices soon will start to work its way through production and distribution costs&rdquo; and therefore anticipate the core measures &ldquo; to slow sharply over the next six-to-nine months, with a big drop likely to start before the end of the winter&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 0.65 HIGHER AT USD 51.65/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 0.23 HIGHER AT USD 60.20/BBL.</strong> &nbsp;Crude trades higher, helped in the early part of the day by improved equity market sentiment, which was driven by suggestions that US/China trade talks are ongoing. However, that sentiment proved temporary, and stocks slid as Trump threatened a government shutdown, dragging oil with it, leaving the complex mixed going into settlement. Some analysts continue to suggest that the OPEC deal reached last week should help to turn around crude sentiment; &quot;the OPEC+ cut agreement achieved last Friday represents a strong statement of intent to defend the oil price in the face of internal political difficulties and pressure from the US to allow the price to fall further,&quot; UBS said. &quot;The 1.2mln BPD cut agreed should also be more than enough to swing the market from a small surplus into a deficit both in the near-term and for 2019 if OPEC chooses to maintain the cuts beyond the current 6-month plan.&quot; UBS suggests that it could be a failure to achieve a cut agreement at or above the top of the 1mln to 1.4mln BPD consensus range, but its oil analyst said he cannot believe that sentiment will remain so relentlessly negative as the impact of the production cuts, continued production declines from Venezuela and Iran and outages in Libya filter through the fundamental data in coming weeks.&quot; Elsewhere, the IEA&#39;s STEO saw world oil demand in 2018 raised by 20k BPD to 1.54mln BPD YY; 2019 forecast was raised by 80k BPD to 1.52mln BPD YY. For output, the EIA forecast 2019 US crude oil output will rise by 1.18mln BPD (prev. 1.16mln) to 12.06mln BPD. This week&rsquo;s oil inventories data see crude -3.0mln, distillate +1.8mln, gasoline +2.5mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.04% at 2637, NDX +0.32% at 6704, DJI -0.22% at 24370. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +0.03%, Materials -0.36%, Industrials -0.59%, Cons Discretionary +0.04%, Cons Staples +0.85%, Healthcare +0.30%, Financials -1.02%, Tech +0.09%, Telecoms +0.15%, Utilities +0.30%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Stocks opened higher following progressive US-China trade developments before drifting lower through the day, trade sensitive semiconductors (AVGO, MU, TXN, INTC) and industrials (CAT, DE) started the session as outperformers. After reports China would be reducing car tariffs, automakers (GM, F, FCAU, TSLA) pushed higher on the open. AT&amp;T (T) outperformed in earlier trade on the back of an upgrade at Citi. The energy sector traded higher on the open and then drifted lower, in line with oil prices, also suppressed by a string of downgrades in the sector by JPMorgan. Pfizer (PFE) weighed down healthcare following a downgrade at JPMorgan. Financials (WFC, BLK, GS, C) underperformed as yields moved lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 7+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-14+.</strong> Treasuries traded lower in Asia amid low volume and continued to sell into the European open. As US traders sat at their desks, the complex edged gradually higher and extended gains on reports suggesting Trump administration is condemning China over hacking and economic espionage Trump administration to condemn China over hacking and economic espionage as well as Trump threatening a government shutdown. Nonetheless the complex finished Tuesday&rsquo;s session in negative territory as equities pared back some of their losses and turned positive heading into the close. &nbsp;Most of the action was concentrated in the front end of the curve where yields were higher by c.5bps at settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The treasury sold USD 38bln in 3-year notes tailing by 0.3bps at a high yield of 2.748%, the lowest since July. Demand for the auction, as indicated by the bid-to-cover, was slightly below recent averages. Looking at the breakdown, directs participation rebounded from recent weakness as directs secured the biggest share since July 2016; indirects were awarded the largest share since June and primary dealers were left with the smallest portion since January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 10-YEAR NOTES PREVIEW:</strong> The US Treasury will auction USD 38bln of 3-year notes (Tues), USD 24bln of 10-year notes (Wed) and USD 16bln of 30-year bonds (Thu). With 10-year yields beneath the November auction stop-out rate (and all the stop-out rates going to July), analysts at SocGen say Wednesday&rsquo;s auction will likely be &ldquo;under pressure&rdquo;. &ldquo;On relative value metrics, the current note is trading rich on the Treasury spline versus old 10s compared with the previous two cycles, while it has slightly cheapened over the past two sessions on the curve versus 5s and 30s, though it is still rich compared with the previous auction levels,&rdquo; the bank writes. It also suggests that the recent flattening of the 2s10s curve could be a negative, as well as the recent increase in dealer holdings. It is also worth noting that ahead of the auction, the November CPI data will be released, which could influence the tone of the auction. On the flip side, SocGen notes that current 10s are trading special in repo, which indicates a short base, which could offset headwinds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, SEK, NOK: </strong>All benefiting from a pronounced rebound in risk appetite, prompted in part by positive developments on the US-China trade front following reports about constructive dialogue between Washington and Beijing, and news that the latter has put forward proposals to slash US auto tariffs to 15% from 40% for review. Aud/Usd is consolidating recovery gains above 0.7200, with the Kiwi back within striking distance of 0.6900, while Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok have retreated below 9.7000 and 10.3000 respectively post-forecast beating Norwegian inflation data yesterday and pre-Swedish CPI on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency has dropped to the bottom of the G10 pile and through 1.1350 support vs the Dollar that held on Monday amidst heightened Eurozone fiscal concerns in the run up to Wednesday&rsquo;s 2019 draft budget representation from Italy to the EU. Rome&rsquo;s coalition parties and key Government officials are still at loggerheads over how far to bridge the gap between Brussels&rsquo; demands and the initial 2.4% deficit target that was rejected and threatens the imposition of EDP measures. However, the Eur came under additional pressure from French President Macron&rsquo;s climbdown to quell civil unrest and the prospect of an even bigger overshoot in public finances vs GDP in Paris next year. Eur/Usd has retreated further from 1.1400 as a result and now eyeing bids/support just ahead of 1.1300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, GBP, CAD, CHF: </strong>The Jpy appears to have eluded another test of a key fib level around 113.34, but equally could not gather enough recovery momentum to breach resistance at 113.00 and a decent option expiry at the strike (1.5 bn) as the aforementioned revival in risk appetite kept the safe-haven in check. Similarly, the Pound failed to sustain its return to 1.2600+ status and recoiled in sympathy (to a degree) with the Eur) amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty, even though UK average earnings were upbeat towards 1.2550. However, the Loonie and Franc both held up better against the backdrop of a firmer Greenback overall in wake of stronger than forecast US core PPI (DXY up to 97.358 vs 96.867 at one stage) with the aid of higher oil and relative gains vs the single currency. Hence, Usd/Cad continued to pivot 1.3400, and while Usd/Chf climbed back above 0.9900, Eur/Chf stayed nearer the base of 1.1225-60 trading parameters.</p>\r\n",

However, that sentiment proved temporary, and stocks slid as Trump threatened a government shutdown, dragging oil with it, leaving the complex mixed going into settlement. Some analysts continue to suggest that the OPEC deal reached last week should help to turn around crude sentiment; &quot;the OPEC+ cut agreement achieved last Friday represents a strong statement of intent to defend the oil price in the face of internal political difficulties and pressure from the US to allow the price to fall further,&quot; UBS said. &quot;The 1.2mln BPD cut agreed should also be more than enough to swing the market from a small surplus into a deficit both in the near-term and for 2019 if OPEC chooses to maintain the cuts beyond the current 6-month plan.&quot; UBS suggests that it could be a failure to achieve a cut agreement at or above the top of the 1mln to 1.4mln BPD consensus range, but its oil analyst said he cannot believe that sentiment will remain so relentlessly negative as the impact of the production cuts, continued production declines from Venezuela and Iran and outages in Libya filter through the fundamental data in coming weeks.&quot; Elsewhere, the IEA&#39;s STEO saw world oil demand in 2018 raised by 20k BPD to 1.54mln BPD YY; 2019 forecast was raised by 80k BPD to 1.52mln BPD YY. For output, the EIA forecast 2019 US crude oil output will rise by 1.18mln BPD (prev. 1.16mln) to 12.06mln BPD.</p>\r\n",

Barclays also observes that direct bidder participation has also declined, falling to near post-crisis lows. &ldquo;This was largely due to a smaller takedown from domestic investors, falling from 42% in October to 35% in November,&rdquo; Barclays says, &ldquo;broker dealers have had to take down more in recent months.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent history</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Tail: Prev. 0.3bps tail, 6 auction avg. 0.3bps tail</li>\r\n  <li>High Yield % (Prev. 2.98%, 6 auction avg. 2.307%)</li>\r\n  <li>Bid to Cover (Prev. 2.54x, 6 auction avg. 2.63x)</li>\r\n  <li>Dealers (Prev. 48%, 6 auction avg. 38.83%)</li>\r\n  <li>Directs (Prev. 3%, 6 auction avg. 10.33%)</li>\r\n  <li>Indirects % (Prev. 49%, 6 auction avg. 51.33%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Aud/Usd is consolidating recovery gains above 0.7200, with the Kiwi back within striking distance of 0.6900, while Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok have retreated below 9.7000 and 10.3000 respectively post-forecast beating Norwegian inflation data yesterday and pre-Swedish CPI on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has dropped to the bottom of the G10 pile and through 1.1350 support vs the Dollar that held on Monday amidst heightened Eurozone fiscal concerns in the run up to Wednesday&rsquo;s 2019 draft budget representation from Italy to the EU. Rome&rsquo;s coalition parties and key Government officials are still at loggerheads over how far to bridge the gap between Brussels&rsquo; demands and the initial 2.4% deficit target that was rejected and threatens the imposition of EDP measures. However, the Eur came under additional pressure from French President Macron&rsquo;s climbdown to quell civil unrest and the prospect of an even bigger overshoot in public finances vs GDP in Paris next year. Eur/Usd has retreated further from 1.1400 as a result and now eyeing bids/support just ahead of 1.1300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP/CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jpy appears to have eluded another test of a key fib level around 113.34, but equally could not gather enough recovery momentum to breach resistance at 113.00 and a decent option expiry at the strike (1.5 bn) as the aforementioned revival in risk appetite kept the safe-haven in check. Similarly, the Pound failed to sustain its return to 1.2600+ status and recoiled in sympathy (to a degree) with the Eur) amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty, even though UK average earnings were upbeat towards 1.2550. However, the Loonie and Franc both held up better against the backdrop of a firmer Greenback overall in wake of stronger than forecast US core PPI (DXY up to 97.358 vs 96.867 at one stage) with the aid of higher oil and relative gains vs the single currency. Hence, Usd/Cad continued to pivot 1.3400, and while Usd/Chf climbed back above 0.9900, Eur/Chf stayed nearer the base of 1.1225-60 trading parameters.</p>\r\n",

The Franc remains relatively firm within a 0.9905-0.9865 range and above 1.1250 vs the Eur, while the Scandi crowns have clawed back recent losses amidst an improvement in risk sentiment, and with the Sek awaiting Swedish inflation data on Wednesday after significantly stronger than forecast Norwegian CPI metrics yesterday. Eur/Nok is around 9.7000 and Eur/Sek back below 10.3000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Also trying to pare losses vs the Dollar after extending its downturn from 112.25 to 113.35 and extremely close to a Fib level, but unable to rebound through 113.00 where heavy supply is touted and a 1.5 bn option expiry resides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/NZD - Mixed fortunes once again as the Aud reclaims 0.7200+ status vs its US counterpart, albeit just, on more promising vibes regarding US-China trade, which have also nudged the Aud/Nzd cross back up towards 1.0500, as the Kiwi losses sight of 0.6900 vs the Usd. Meanwhile, the Loonie is back on the 1.3400 handle and regaining some composure alongside crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Try continues to underperform on bearish technical rather than fresh fundamental impulses, but did glean support from another upbeat snapshot of Turkey&rsquo;s current account to trade back near 5.3500 vs the Dollar from 5.4000+ at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU debt has slipped further into the red, with Gilts still lagging peers (down over 50 ticks) as the UK benchmark saw a little more bearish reaction to UK wage data, despite focus remaining on Brexit updates, with no-confidence speculation mounting. Traders are now eyeing a fib at 123.48 on the downside as support vs. Liffe lows of 123.59. Bunds saw little reaction to a decent Schatz auction (b/c and average yield falling in line with prev.) or ZEW with 10-year yields now firmer above 0.25% as the risk-on tone has replaced yesterday&rsquo;s safe haven flight (for now at least). Back to futures on a technical basis 162.82 is up next as support as the benchmark&nbsp; hangs around the 162.90 handle vs. 162.83 at worst. BTPs remain cautious ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s Italian-EU budget showdown as sources suggest Rome is not stepping back from its 2.2% target. OATs are also deeply in the red, with the French 10-year yield rising above 0.75% at one point and hitting a three week high, as protestors seem unappeased by President Macron&rsquo;s concessions amid calls for a 5th week of action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, US Treasury futures are seeing most of the action in the belly ahead of the USD 38bln 3yr auction amidst a concessionary tone as 10-year futures broke the 120-16/17 level to the downside with 120-06 eyed next up and yields above 2.85%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.9%) and WTI (+1.0%) prices have strengthened, despite drifting lower at the start of the session following comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak that Russia plans to cut oil output by 50k-60k BPD in January; which is significantly below the 228,000 BPD figure targeted as part of the latest OPEC deal. Novak adds that they will gradually reduce oil output. Separately, high level internal reports are to cut output by 139k BPD following the OPEC deal. Looking ahead today sees the API weekly data release, which saw a crude stocks build of 5.6mln last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has strengthened on a softer dollar, although the yellow metal is still off of the 5-month high of USD 1250.55/oz reached in the previous session. Separately, exploration by Rio Tinto in Australia has yet to find any economically viable copper ore veins; the site had been touted as being potentially rich in copper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian oil exports have improved since early November according to the Iranian President.

The SMI is also bolstered by LafargeHolcim (+3.3%), which is benefitting from outperformance in the materials sector seen today on the back of US and Chinese representatives planning the next steps in trade discussions. FTSE 100 (+0.9%) is lagging its peers, amidst currency effects from ongoing Brexit developments, with Morrisons (-1.0%) and Tesco (-0.5%) lower following the latest Kantar data. Other notable equity movers are WPP (+6.4%) after an update to guidance, and Ashtead Group (+3.7%) after they announced full year expected results to be ahead of expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Far from zero to hero, but Sterling is ahead of the pack in terms of broad G10 currency advances vs the Greenback as the DXY ducks back under the 97.000 level. Cable has bounced further from yesterday&rsquo;s new 2018 low circa 1.2507, through the pre-official cancellation of the Brexit vote base around a big figure higher and just shy of 1.2640, mainly on short covering and consolidation, but also with the aid of strong UK average earnings. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp has retreated towards 0.9000 having cleared 0.9050 and topped out not too far from 0.9100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/SEK/NOK - The next best majors, with the single currency maintaining its recovery momentum off 1.1350 lows vs the Usd, but capped ahead of 1.1400 and perhaps conscious of hefty option interest between 1.1390 and the bog figure (2 bn). The Franc remains relatively firm within a 0.9905-0.9865 range and above 1.1250 vs the Eur, while the Scandi crowns have clawed back recent losses amidst an improvement in risk sentiment, and with the Sek awaiting Swedish inflation data on Wednesday after significantly stronger than forecast Norwegian CPI metrics yesterday.

Traders are now eyeing a fib at 123.48 on the downside as support vs. Liffe lows of 123.59. Bunds saw little reaction to a decent Schatz auction (b/c and average yield falling in line with prev.) or ZEW with 10-year yields now firmer above 0.25% as the risk-on tone has replaced yesterday&rsquo;s safe haven flight (for now at least). Back to futures on a technical basis 162.82 is up next as support as the benchmark hangs around the 162.90 handle vs. 162.83 at worst.

Cable has bounced further from yesterday&rsquo;s new 2018 low circa 1.2507, through the pre-official cancellation of the Brexit vote base around a big figure higher and just shy of 1.2640, mainly on short covering and consolidation, but also with the aid of strong UK average earnings. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp has retreated towards 0.9000 having cleared 0.9050 and topped out not too far from 0.9100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best majors, with the single currency maintaining its recovery momentum off 1.1350 lows vs the Usd, but capped ahead of 1.1400 and perhaps conscious of hefty option interest between 1.1390 and the bog figure (2 bn). The Franc remains relatively firm within a 0.9905-0.9865 range and above 1.1250 vs the Eur, while the Scandi crowns have clawed back recent losses amidst an improvement in risk sentiment, and with the Sek awaiting Swedish inflation data on Wednesday after significantly stronger than forecast Norwegian CPI metrics yesterday. Eur/Nok is around 9.7000 and Eur/Sek back below 10.3000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also trying to pare losses vs the Dollar after extending its downturn from 112.25 to 113.35 and extremely close to a Fib level, but unable to rebound through 113.00 where heavy supply is touted and a 1.5 bn option expiry resides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed fortunes once again as the Aud reclaims 0.7200+ status vs its US counterpart, albeit just, on more promising vibes regarding US-China trade, which have also nudged the Aud/Nzd cross back up towards 1.0500, as the Kiwi losses sight of 0.6900 vs the Usd. Meanwhile, the Loonie is back on the 1.3400 handle and regaining some composure alongside crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Try continues to underperform on bearish technical rather than fresh fundamental impulses, but did glean support from another upbeat snapshot of Turkey&rsquo;s current account to trade back near 5.3500 vs the Dollar from 5.4000+ at one stage.</p>\r\n",

The downturn is partly corrective, as Bunds also made more room for the rebound in EU stocks and risk appetite in general (162.94 low, -46 ticks), but largely Brexit-related following Monday&rsquo;s antics that culminated in the cancellation of today&rsquo;s meaningful vote.

However, the core Eurozone bond may retain an underlying bid as BTPs remain cautious ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s Italian-EU budget showdown and as French OATs continue to decline on the deteriorating fiscal outlook following President Macron&rsquo;s U-turn on budget plans amidst all the protests. Moreover, Bunds may glean some traction via December&rsquo;s ZEW survey if sentiment is worse than forecast like Sentix on Monday, though there could be a bit more concession at the short end ahead of Eur3 bn Schatz supply. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed as sentiment in the region finds only mild solace from the tech-led recovery on Wall St. ASX 200 (+0.1%) was firmer at the open as outperformance in the tech sector helped the index pick itself up from around 2-year lows although this later stalled amid weakness in energy and financials, while Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) swung between gains and losses amid a lack of fresh drivers and an indecisive currency. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) &nbsp;and Hang Seng (+0.1%) are also choppy on trade uncertainty amid lingering concerns the Huawei situation could spill-over to US-China trade talks, although there were comments from Mofcom which noted that Vice Premier Liu spoke with US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and US Trade Representative Lighthizer in which they exchanged views on pushing forward the timetable and road map for the next stages of trade discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the major pairs have quietened from yesterday&rsquo;s price moves which has provided GBP/USD with some much-needed respite following its slip to its lowest level in more than 20 months in the fall-out of PM May&rsquo;s 11th hour cancellation of the Brexit deal vote. EUR/USD also languishes after its recent weakness and although it has bounced off support at 1.1350 the recovery has only been trivial as the DXY remains firm above 97.00. Elsewhere, AUD/USD is choppy around the 0.7200 level and USD/JPY struggles to hold on the 113.00 handle amid the mixed risk-tone, while focus now shifts to the open in India after RBI Governor Patel&rsquo;s shock resignation and where participants will eye how PM Modi&rsquo;s BJP perform in closely contested state assembly elections ahead of next year&rsquo;s general election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid the indecisive risk tone and with participants sidelined ahead of a 30yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
