Worries resurfaced as the US 10-year yield crossed 3%, while the 2-year yield rose above 2.50%. Others cited concerns in the tech sector (AAPL fifth red day on concerns over iPhone demand, while GOOGL weighed after earnings, FAANG&rsquo;s weak); others cited geopolitical uncertainties. The S&amp;P 500 Emini was consolidating beneath 2700 pre-market, but not even decent numbers from Caterpillar (which lent some premarket strength to the Dow mini) could keep indices bid, and the grind lower was gradual yet persistent, accelerating in the latter part of the session, before basing around 2620. SPX -1.3% at 2634, NDX -2.10% at 6509, DJI -1.7% at 24017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was an extraordinary amount of attention on 10-year yields temporarily breaching the 3.00% handle for the first time in four years, as the curve steepened, which also saw yields on 2s above 2.50% at one point. Traders were attributing the rise in yields to the notion that the Fed hikes will take an &lsquo;autopilot&rsquo; approach (as was hinted by the Fed&rsquo;s Williams over the weekend) as well as the increased size of issuance out of the US Treasury, which will auction a total of $113bln this week ($32bln 2-year notes on Tuesday; $35bln 5-year notes on Wednesday; $17bln 2-year FRN on Wednesday; $29bln 7-year notes on Thursday. Net supply is implied at $3.6bln given that $109.4bln maturing at the mid-month settlement. Analysts also note that over the next month, gross supply (including next week&rsquo;s auction of $73bln in 3s, 10s, 30s) is around $169bln, with large cashflows due, estimated around $208bln. Traders are also cognizant of the Q2 refunding announcement on 2/May, where the US Treasury may raise the size of auction issuance, according to some analysts. Today&rsquo;s auction of 2s saw a tail of 0.5bps, while the yield at auction was the highest since 2008. The internals weren&rsquo;t particularly bright, with cover beneath recent averages and direct takedown slightly higher than recent averages.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: </strong>Stocks lower, USD lower, treasuries flat, oil down.<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW: </strong>Macron open to new Iran deal; US consumer confidence and new home sales beat.<br /><strong>* AHEAD:</strong> &nbsp;API inventories (aftermarket); DOE inventories (Weds); ECB speak (unlikely to feature policy comments); Earnings on Weds include AT&amp;T, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Qualcomm, Comcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS: </strong>US President Trump said that there was a good chance of coming to an agreement with <strong>China</strong> over trade, once again highlighting his principles of fairness and reciprocity, and talking-up his belief that the current trade arrangement is unfair. Trump will be sending Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to China in the next few days to continue talks with the nation. In <strong>NAFTA</strong> talks, Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said intensive NAFTA negotiations were progressing well, and a win-win deal was possible, while reiterating the sensitivities around the auto side of negotiations, which she didn&rsquo;t specifically make comments on. Mexican policymakers continued to express optimism over reaching a NAFTA agreement, with the head of business lobby CEE making comments that were in line with the timing suggested by US, Canadian and Mexican policymakers last week. Meanwhile, the Mexican economy minister reiterated his optimism, but said that Mexico is unwilling to accept restrictions on steel and aluminium. Elsewhere, EU trade chief Malmstrom repeated the <strong>EU&rsquo;s</strong> desire for permanent exemption from US levies, arguing that metal tariffs breach WTO rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>President Trump and French President Macron delivered a press conference that gave both hot and cold signals with regards to the Iran nuclear accord; Trump had earlier suggested that a deal was close, and during the press conference between the two leaders, Macron suggested that he wanted to advance work on a new deal with Iran. However, Trump reiterated that his mind was not made up, and told Iran that if it threatened the US, it would pay a large price (Iran had earlier threatened to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if the US pulled out of the nuclear accord). The US must make its decision on whether to pull out of the Iran deal and apply new sanctions on the country by the 12/May. On North Korea, Trump said that denuclearisation of the nation means &lsquo;getting rid of its nukes&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA</strong>: US <strong>consumer confidence</strong> rose in April to 128.7 against expectations of a decline. However, the Conference board also noted that the percentage of consumers claiming jobs are &ldquo;plentiful&rdquo; declined from 39.5% to 38.1%, and those claiming jobs are &ldquo;hard to get&rdquo; also declined from 15.7% 15.2%, resulting in a narrowing of the differential between the two to 22.9 in April from 25.0 in March (a higher differential is preferred by economists as a sign of the economy&rsquo;s health). US <strong>new home</strong> sales also surprised to the upside in March, bringing the data set in line with other, more optimistic home builder confidence surveys, which are near cyclical highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX -1.36% at 2634, NDX -2.10% at 6509, DJI -1.77% at 24017 SECTORS</strong>: Cons Cyclicals:&nbsp; -1.59%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.61%, Energy: -1.18%, Financials: -0.64%, Health Care: -0.88%, Industrials: -2.59%, Materials: -2.81%, Technology: -2.46%, Telecoms: +0.92%, Utilities: +0.56%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a single specific catalyst for the stock slide on Tuesday, however, a collection of reasons applied pressure, leaving a risk-off taste in the mouth of traders. Worries resurfaced as the US 10-year yield crossed 3%, while the 2-year yield rose above 2.50%. Others cited concerns in the tech sector (AAPL fifth red day on concerns over iPhone demand, while GOOGL weighed after earnings, FAANG&rsquo;s weak); others cited geopolitical uncertainties. The S&amp;P 500 Emini was consolidating beneath 2700 pre-market, but not even decent numbers from Caterpillar (which lent some premarket strength to the Dow mini) could keep indices bid, and the grind lower was gradual yet persistent, accelerating in the latter part of the session, before basing around 2620.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX</strong> was led by Cadence Design systems (CDNS) and Whirlpool (WHR) as CDNS showed a strong earnings report, and WHR, despite missing estimates on EPS &amp; Revenue, said it agreed to sell its Embraco compressor unit to Japan&rsquo;s Nidec in a $1.1bln deal so it can focus on its consumer business. However, weighing on the index,&nbsp; Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) closed down ~15% following poor earnings and concerns regarding a new work contract in Indonesia may be delayed due to Indonesia presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outperformers in the <strong>NDX</strong> included Shire (SHPG) following later confirmed reports that Takeda (4502 JT) was offering another provisional offer for SHPG, also Biogen (BIIB) beating EPS expectations among NDX leaders. On the flip side, Alphabet (GOOG) reported earnings after the bell on Monday, which beat on both top and bottom lines but the $3.40 added due to tax benefit was seen as a negative to traders as well as increasing costs and narrowing margins. GOOG closed Tuesday trade among Incyte (INCY) after the FDA suggested the approval of 2mg dose, instead of the 4mg dose for treatment of arthritis in adult patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Verizon (VZ) led the <strong>DJI</strong> on Tuesday following a strong earnings report, and also leading the telecom sector making it today&rsquo;s outperformer with utilities who gained due to its defensive nature. However, the DJI entered into correction territory following 10yr yields crossing 3.00%, also being hampered by Caterpillar (CAT), who started the day off with a strong earnings report and was an outperformer, but as the conference call took place concerns were raised where the CEO noted Q1 will be the &lsquo;high water mark&rsquo; for the year and stated that steel costs will continue to rise which led to all of the recent gains paring back and extending to losses of greater than 6% closing among 3M (MMM) in the DJI as the underperformers as 3M cut its FY EPS forecast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>M&amp;A News today focused on Shire as both Shire and Takeda confirmed a revised proposal was made, but there was no certainty of a firm offer, nor the terms on any potential offers. Also pre market SS&amp;C Technologies (SSNC) stated they do not intend to make an offer for UK&rsquo;s Fidessa (FDSA LN), and both Cigna (CI) and Express Scripts (ESRX) were asked to hand over additional information to the DoJ. In smaller M&amp;A news, Trimble (TRMB) stated it would acquire Viewpoint from Bain Capital for roughly $1.2bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI futures (M8) settle 7 cents higher at 68.40/bbl; Brent futures settle 28 cents higher at 74.06/bbl </strong>Crude was supported in the early part of the session as geopolitical tensions continue to simmer in the Middle East. Some analysts also cited production outages in Venezuela, while the Nigerians said crude exports would fall slightly in June to 1.796m BPD. However, there were offsetting factors for the crude complex, which made the air thin for Brent near $75.50 and WTI near $69.50: The Kazakhstan energy minister said output at Kashagan was up to 300k BPD, while repairs to the Libyan Waha pipeline had now completed, after militant attacks over the weekend. The US crude benchmark printed fresh session lows beneath $68/bbl amid the Trump/Macron press conference; it was a wishy washy press conference &ndash; Macron suggested that work on a new Iran deal should be advanced, though Trump struck a more belligerent line, warning Iran against making threats to restart its nuclear programme, or face a high price. Trump characteristically left the situation unclear towards the end of the press conference, hinting that his made was still not made up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES:</strong> <strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle unchanged at 119-10+ . </strong>There was an extraordinary amount of attention on 10-year yields temporarily breaching the 3.00% handle for the first time in four years, as the curve steepened, which also saw yields on 2s above 2.50% at one point. Traders were attributing the rise in yields to the notion that the Fed hikes will take an &lsquo;autopilot&rsquo; approach (as was hinted by the Fed&rsquo;s Williams over the weekend) as well as the increased size of issuance out of the US Treasury, which will auction a total of $113bln this week ($32bln 2-year notes on Tuesday; $35bln 5-year notes on Wednesday; $17bln 2-year FRN on Wednesday; $29bln 7-year notes on Thursday. Net supply is implied at $3.6bln given that $109.4bln maturing at the mid-month settlement. Analysts also note that over the next month, gross supply (including next week&rsquo;s auction of $73bln in 3s, 10s, 30s) is around $169bln, with large cashflows due, estimated around $208bln. Traders are also cognizant of the Q2 refunding announcement on 2/May, where the US Treasury may raise the size of auction issuance, according to some analysts. Today&rsquo;s auction of 2s saw a tail of 0.5bps, while the yield at auction was the highest since 2008. The internals weren&rsquo;t particularly bright, with cover beneath recent averages and direct takedown slightly higher than recent averages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> <strong>DXY</strong> Not strictly dancing to the Treasury market tune and unable to revisit overnight highs just over the 91.000 handle even though UST yields have at last breached key/psychological levels on the upside, ie 10 year touching 3% and 2 year 2.5% ahead of $32bln supply. <strong>JPY</strong> The clear G10 underperformer, as debt yield differentials and carry plays propel the headline pair through 109.00 and the 100 DMA and then pairing back losses finding support around 108.70. <strong>NZDAUD</strong> Kiwi still grounded and pressured by the firm Greenback and cross positioning as the AUD holds above 1.0660 resistance and has reclaimed 0.7600+ status vs the USD, albeit just and with fund offers said to be parked up at 0.7620-30. <strong>NZDUSD</strong> floundering towards the bottom end of a 0.7105-55 range. <strong>GBP/CAD/EUR</strong> All ending Tuesday&rsquo;s choppy session firmer vs the USD on a mixture of technical buying, short covering and supportive cross activity to the detriment of the <strong>JPY</strong>. Cable has bounced off a 1.3920 low that aligned with chart support, but looks offered ahead of 1.4000, while <strong>USDCAD</strong> has pulled back from 1.2850+ peaks amidst ongoing hopes (some substantiated by latest updates on negotiations) of a NAFTA agreement in the not too distant future. <strong>EURUSD</strong> has reclaimed 1.2220 after post-Ifo selling stopped short (marginally) of breaching yesterday&rsquo;s base and is back above the 100 DMA (1.2210).</p>\r\n",

Some analysts also cited production outages in Venezuela, while the Nigerians said crude exports would fall slightly in June to 1.796m BPD. However, there were offsetting factors for the crude complex, which made the air thin for Brent near $75.50 and WTI near $69.50: The Kazakhstan energy minister said output at Kashagan was up to 300k BPD, while repairs to the Libyan Waha pipeline had now completed, after militant attacks over the weekend. The US crude benchmark printed fresh session lows beneath $68/bbl amid the Trump/Macron press conference; it was a wishy washy press conference &ndash; Macron suggested that work on a new Iran deal should be advanced, though Trump struck a more belligerent line, warning Iran against making threats to restart its nuclear programme, or face a high price. Trump characteristically left the situation unclear towards the end of the press conference, hinting that his made was still not made up.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>ISSUANCE:</strong> US Treasury will auction a total of $113bln this week ($32bln 2-year notes on Tuesday; $35bln 5-year notes on Wednesday; $17bln 2-year FRN on Wednesday; $29bln 7-year notes on Thursday. Net supply is implied at $3.6bln given that $109.4bln maturing at the mid-month settlement. Analysts also note that over the next month, gross supply (including next week&rsquo;s auction of $73blnin 3s, 10s, 30s) is around $169bln, with large cashflows due, estimated around $208bln. Traders are also cognizant of the Q2 refunding announcement on 2/May, where the US Treasury may raise the size of auction issuance, according to some analysts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> Since the previous auction cycle, 2-year yields have printed a series of fresh cyclical highs, though parts of the curve have not kept up with the rise in the short-end, resulting in fresh cyclical narrows for the likes of 2s30s. some policymakers have warned that the curve could invert (Fed&rsquo;s non-voter Bullard suggested it could happen within six-months), which could portend a recession; others, however, note that the cyclical dynamic is different this time given the activist monetary policy that central bank&rsquo;s engaged in through the great financial crisis, which saw them build bond holdings. Goldman Sachs, for instance, does not see an inversion in this cycle. Either way, this cheapening of the 2s sector on the curve is likely to be a positive for the auction. Elsewhere, recent auction of 2s have been lukewarm, generally stopping through or tailing by +/- 1bps on average over the last six and 12-months. There has also been attention on dealer participation, which has been edging up over the last few auctions amid declining direct and indirect participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"333\" src=\"/system/ckeditor_assets/pictures/39/content_2s_history.JPG\" width=\"800\" /></p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%)</strong> and <strong>Hang Seng (+1.3%)</strong> outperformed after a mild net liquidity injection by the PBoC, as well as press reports that China has further room to cut RRR and is likely to ease liquidity tension this week. Furthermore, Rusal shares rose by around 30% in Hong Kong on hopes of sanction relief, while the blue-chip energy and property names led the upside in the Hang Seng. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively uneventful with demand subdued amid the improvement in risk appetite, although downside was also limited as USTs nursed losses and following a relatively uneventful 2yr auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China has additional room to reduce RRR and repay maturing Medium-term Lending Facility loans, while it is also likely to ease liquidity tension during the week, according to reports.

Looking at the sectors, energy names are outperforming amid the rise in oil prices. Telecom names lag behind with Telenor (-2.5%) weighing on the sector following weak earnings. In terms of stock specifics, William Hill (-14.0%) are at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after reports that UK Chancellor Hammond has accepted the proposal for GBP 2 fixed-odd betting terminals limit. Semi-conductor names took a hit following earnings from AMS (-9.0%) with Dialog Semiconductors (-6.0%) and STMicroelectronics (-1.6%) lower in sympathy. On the flip side SAP (+3.2%) shares are higher post-earnings while BP (+1.4%) shares are fuelled by an upgrade at Goldman Sachs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index has cleared another key upside technical level amidst more widespread Dollar gains and has also eclipsed 91.000 to expose fair resistance around 91.526 ahead of a stronger chart hurdle circa 91.751.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi has really taken fright amidst the latest Usd leg-up, but also as cross flows vs its antipodean neighbour weigh heavily. Nzd/Usd is hovering precariously just above 0.7100, while Aud/Nzd is only a few pips below 1.0700 after accelerated buying (stops and orders) on a break of 1.0660. However, Aud/Usd has breached a major downside equality level at 0.7611 after mixed/soft Aussie inflation overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/JPY/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All pivoting or skirting key/psychological/big figure levels vs the Greenback, with Eur/Usd currently bang on 1.2200 after a slip below on soft German Ifo indices, but finding some underlying support around Monday&rsquo;s low and just ahead of a 1.2173 Fib. Note, 1.1 bn option expiries at the figure and the 100 DMA at 1.2210 may also cap the upside. Usd/Jpy is edging closer towards 109.00 and its 100 DMA just a pip above, while Usd/Chf is not far from 0.9800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD/GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative &lsquo;outperformers&rsquo; among the G10 community, but still weak overall vs the Usd and well off recent peaks, as Usd/Cad dips back below 1.2850 and Cable holds above the top of a support band extending from 1.3920-1.3890.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flat or softer than anticipated CBI industrial orders depending on the consensus forecast used in comparison to the actual figure coincided with a tepid uptick in Gilts off a fresh 121.17 Liffe low, -5 ticks vs +20 ticks at best, but still lagging a bit vs Bunds that remain a few ticks in positive territory. In truth the 10 year EU benchmarks are relatively rangebound in low key/volume trade after the more pronounced price action and moves yesterday, and awaiting bigger events/calendar items for further direction as USTs idle sideways ahead of the US open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil has maintained the climb seen on Monday with the Brent front month contract hitting USD 75.27, its highest level since late 2014, following suggestions that the US may still entertain the possibility of exiting the Iran nuclear deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is uneventful, with the yellow metal remaining around the USD 1326.50/oz level, as safe-haven demand fades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals complex, aluminium saw a fall following an announcement from the US of deadline extensions for Rusal, whilst Dalian iron ore prices recovered from early pressure overnight triggered by a slump in Shanghai aluminium at the open.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities opened on the backfoot but since then have recovered (Eurostoxx 50 +0.2%) amid relatively light newsflow thus far. Taking a look at the sectors, energy names are outperforming amid the rise in oil prices. Telecom names lag behind with Telenor (-3.4%) weighing on the sector following weak earnings. In terms of stock specifics, William Hill (-12.7%) are at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after reports that UK Chancellor Hammond has accepted the proposal for GBP 2 fixed-odd betting terminals limit. Semi-conductor names took a hit following earnings from AMS (-11.0%) with Dialog Semiconductors (-6.0%) and STMicroelectronics (-1.6%) lower in sympathy. On the flip side, Saipem (+1.2%) and SAP (+3.8%) shares are higher post-earnings while BP (+1.7%) shares are fuelled by an upgrade at Goldman Sachs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index has cleared another key upside technical level amidst more widespread Dollar gains and has also eclipsed 91.000 to expose fair resistance around 91.526 ahead of a stronger chart hurdle circa 91.751.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi has really taken fright amidst the latest Usd leg-up, but also as cross flows vs its antipodean neighbour weigh heavily. Nzd/Usd is hovering precariously just above 0.7100, while Aud/Nzd is only a few pips below 1.0700 after accelerated buying (stops and orders) on a break of 1.0660. However, Aud/Usd has breached a major downside equality level at 0.7611 after mixed/soft Aussie inflation overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All pivoting or skirting key/psychological/big figure levels vs the Greenback, with Eur/Usd currently bang on 1.2200 after a slip below on soft German Ifo indices, but finding some underlying support around Monday&rsquo;s low and just ahead of a 1.2173 Fib. Note, 1.1 bn option expiries at the figure and the 100 DMA at 1.2210 may also cap the upside. Usd/Jpy is edging closer towards 109.00 and its 100 DMA just a pip above, while Usd/Chf is not far from 0.9800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative &lsquo;outperformers&rsquo; among the G10 community, but still weak overall vs the Usd and well off recent peaks, as Usd/Cad dips back below 1.2850 and Cable holds above the top of a support band extending from 1.3920-1.3890.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds had already extended recovery gains to 24 ticks and just above 158.00 in the run up to weaker than forecast German Ifo survey metrics amidst some hefty downward revisions to the previous month ahead of the official release, and perhaps perversely are now easing back a tad (buy rumour/sell fact?). Similarly, Gilts inched a tad higher to 121.41 (+19 ticks) before fading again, but this probably more understandable given the impending UK finance data. US Treasuries still underpinned and the curve slightly flatter ahead of the 2 year and a raft of data focusing on the housing sector, but also including consumer confidence and the Richmond Fed manufacturing survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil has maintained the climb seen on Monday with the Brent front month contract hitting USD 75.27, its highest level since late 2014, following suggestions that the US may still entertain the possibility of exiting the Iran nuclear deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is uneventful, with the yellow metal remaining around the USD 1326.50/oz level, as safe-haven demand fades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals complex, aluminium saw a fall following an announcement from the US of deadline extensions for Rusal, whilst Dalian iron ore prices recovered from early pressure overnight triggered by a slump in Shanghai aluminium at the open.</p>\r\n",

From a relative value perspective, Barlcays do not think the bond offers particularly interesting value and as a quite recently issued bond it faces several more reopening events. Supply for the rest of the quarter is scheduled to be notably shorter on the real yield curve, which should ensure a reasonable reception for the auction. Given that long linker breakevens are at the cheaper end of their recent range, there is also potential for interest to emerge on this basis.</p>\r\n",

The bidding deadline is 1030BST with results expected a few minutes past the bidding deadline. IFR are constructive on the auction, saying that the on a relative value basis, the 2048 line offers around 1bps of value on the 2047 and 2037 fly, adding that the modest size should deliver a drama free result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: German EUR 4bln 0% 2020 Schatz </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Germany reopens its EUR 4bln March 2020 Schatz with the bidding deadline at 1030BST (0530EDT) and results expected shortly after. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>They last sold this Schatz on March 20<sup>th</sup>, selling EUR 4bln with a B/C of 1.41, yield of -0.59% and retention of 19.0%.

Net supply is implied at $3.6bln given that $109.4bln maturing at the mid-month settlement. Analysts also note that over the next month, gross supply (including next week&rsquo;s auction of $73blnin 3s, 10s, 30s) is around $169bln, with large cashflows due, estimated around $208bln. Traders are also cognizant of the Q2 refunding announcement on 2/May, where the US Treasury may raise the size of auction issuance, according to some analysts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> Since the previous auction cycle, 2-year yields have printed a series of fresh cyclical highs, though parts of the curve have not kept up with the rise in the short-end, resulting in fresh cyclical narrows for the likes of 2s30s. some policymakers have warned that the curve could invert (Fed&rsquo;s non-voter Bullard suggested it could happen within six-months), which could portend a recession; others, however, note that the cyclical dynamic is different this time given the activist monetary policy that central bank&rsquo;s engaged in through the great financial crisis, which saw them build bond holdings. Goldman Sachs, for instance, does not see an inversion in this cycle. Either way, this cheapening of the 2s sector on the curve is likely to be a positive for the auction. Elsewhere, recent auction of 2s have been lukewarm, generally stopping through or tailing by +/- 1bps on average over the last six and 12-months. There has also been attention on dealer participation, which has been edging up over the last few auctions amid declining direct and indirect participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"333\" src=\"/system/ckeditor_assets/pictures/43/content_bond3.png\" width=\"800\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: TD Securities. </em></p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) traded positive with Australia supported by gains in financials and energy names, while Japanese exporters benefited from a weaker JPY. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+2.1%) and Hang Seng (+1.1%) outperformed after a mild net liquidity injection by the PBoC, as well as press reports that China has further room to cut RRR and is likely to ease liquidity tension this week. Furthermore, Rusal shares rose by around 30% in Hong Kong on hopes of sanction relief, while the blue-chip energy and property names led the upside in the Hang Seng.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac stock markets are mostly in the green with an improvement in tone seen in comparison to the lacklustre performance on Wall St where rising yields and declines in basic materials dampened sentiment. ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) are positive with Australia supported by gains in financials and energy names, while Japanese exporters benefit from a weaker JPY. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+1.8%) and Hang Seng (+1.0%) are the outperformers after a mild net liquidity injection by the PBoC and amid press reports China is likely to ease liquidity tension this week. Furthermore, Rusal shares are higher by over 28% in Hong Kong on hopes of sanction relief, while the blue-chip energy and property names have led the upside in the Hang Seng.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD remains firm following the recent advances and rising yields with the DXY within close proximity of the 91.00 level to the upside. The strength in the greenback saw its counterparts languish in which EUR/USD briefly slipped below 1.2200 and with GBP/USD a distance from the 1.4000 handle, while PBoC also weakened the reference rate in response and USD/JPY gained a solid footing above 108.50. Elsewhere, antipodeans are subdued with AUD/USD choppy following mixed CPI data which remained below the 2%-3% target range and further supported calls for the RBA to maintain a wait-and-see stance, while NZD underperformed its counterpart across the Tasman on technical buying as AUD/NZD broke through resistance at 1.0660 and the prior week&rsquo;s highs to print its best level in a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively uneventful with demand subdued amid the improvement in risk appetite, although downside is also limited as USTs nurse losses and with a 2yr auction scheduled later.</p>\r\n",
