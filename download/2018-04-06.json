This led to futures dipping heavily in an immediate reaction on trade war concerns, which were paired slightly, but not enough to avoid a negative opening on Friday. This was maintained as the largest impetus for movement in equities throughout the day despite uninspiring employment data that missed expectations. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"_Hlk510811271\">This miss on employment data, whilst seeing a small sell off in equities, was overawed by continued trade comments hammering stocks, with the Fed&rsquo;s chair Powell saying trade wars are not a concern implying that rate increases will continue along the same path, putting further pressure on equities. This as well as comments from the White House seemingly shifting their focus from stock market prosperity to trade deficit reduction by accepting stock market volatility, saw equities close lower on the day. </a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The sectors you&rsquo;d expect to underperform, underperformed. Materials (-2.4%) and industrials (-2.7%) sank as trade war concerns are expected to dampen global growth while financials (-2.4%) also struggled as rates declined amid the broad risk off tone. In stock specific news, all the companies in the Dow finished lower with just 12 companies in the S&amp;P 500 higher on the day. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: <a name=\"_Hlk510811037\">T-Note futures (June 2018) settled up 14+ ticks at 121-00+.</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US Treasuries closed higher as trade concerns and soft jobs data sent rates lower. Donald Trump&rsquo;s threat to slap further tariffs on Chinese goods lifted treasuries before the CME open with the curve initially bull-steepening. The disappointing jobs data gave further impetus for bond bulls as the 10y yield dropped back below 2.8%. Fed Chairman Powell reiterated that further gradual rate hikes would be necessary, which saw market pricing for a June hike remain around 70%. However, odds of a fourth rate hike are still remarkably low as Powell said it was too early to say how tariffs and trade talk will affect the outlook. &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: USD softer after lower NFP and increased trade talk</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The USD was weaker with USD/JPY one of the notable movers as the safe-haven JPY weakened amid swooning stocks and higher bonds. GBP also notably outperformed although the immediate reasoning was unclear with Bank of England Governor Carney avoiding monetary policy in his speech. Historically, April is a strong month for GBP and some analysts were pinning the move higher on seasonal factors. The CAD strengthened after relatively strong jobs data where job creation was higher than expected. However, lower oil prices, trade concerns and NAFTA uncertainty saw USD/CAD rebound to close relatively flat. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures (May) settle down $1.48 at $62.06; Brent futures (June) settle down $1.22 at $67.11</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Oil was flat in early US trade, shrugging off concerns seen from the US&rsquo;s employment data initially but seeing a sell off as trade concerns battered the commodity complex on potential global growth concerns. This sell off was weighed on further by an accompanied shedding in equities. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This all occurred In the wake of Baker Hughes data revealing that US oil rigs had increased by 11 in the week, as well as OPEC related news emanating from Russia stating that OPEC cooperation may be indefinite. The black liquid continued its slide as stocks again tumbled to close down $1.48 at $62.06.</strong></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A holiday-shortened week for many financial centres, but plenty of choppy trade in the currency markets around the central driver &ndash; US vs China trade wars. President Trump got the ball rolling with Usd50 bn tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting an equal and opposite response from Beijing before a brief period of calm as officials from either side sought to play down the tit-for-tat moves as a basis for talks. However, the truce was broken by Trump upping the stakes via a further Usd100 bn Chinese goods under consideration for taxation and China&rsquo;s warning about like-for-like retaliation, adding that negotiations have not begun (as White House economic advisor Kudlow inferred) and cannot take place in the circumstances. In terms of the Dollar, volatile, divergent and dislocated moves vs G10, other major and EM counterparts, as the index rebounded from sub-90.000 levels to circa 90.600, but is back under pressure and struggling to stay above the psychological marker. Note, NFP data was mixed and largely overshadowed by unfolding/latest US-China developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Friday&rsquo;s session as top G10 performer, with Cable back up near 1.4100 and Eur/Gbp retreating towards 0.8700 after several set-backs during the week on significantly weaker than forecast UK services and construction PMIs (both suffering Beast of East bad weather effects).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional safe-havens are back in demand after falling in and out of favour (not in sync), with the Franc also underpinned close to 0.9600 vs the Usd in wake of firmer than expected Swiss CPI data that countered more verbal and probably actual SNB intervention. Usd/Jpy has extended the topside of recent ranges, but met resistance into 107.50 and needs to close out above a pivotal technical zone from 107.00-30 to confirm a more bullish chart pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency survived several tests of downside support into 1.2200 vs the Usd, but remains top heavy under 1.2300 amidst more moderate Eurozone data and dovish/cautious ECB policy rhetoric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the US, Canadian jobs data was significantly stronger than anticipated on the headline payroll count and the fact that full-time employment more than reversed the previous month&rsquo;s decline, so the Loonie has compounded gains made on positive NAFTA reports (significant progress made towards a mid-month deal) to trade around 1.2750 vs the Greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes amidst swings in broad risk sentiment, a neutral RBA and 2-way cross flows, the Kiwi outperforming earlier in the week, but the Aud now in the ascendency. Nzd/Usd testing 0.7250 support, Aud/Usd nudging back up towards 0.7700 and Aud/Nzd closer to 1.0600 vs almost 1.0500 at one stage.</p>\r\n",

Almost all the sectors are in the red with the exception of utilities, supported by Suez (+1.8%), benefiting from an upgrade at Raymond James. Material names are underperforming amid the weakness in base metals. In terms of individual stocks, DAX heavyweight Daimler (-5.7%) shares are seen lower following company going ex-dividend. On the flip side, UK-based Shire (+1.6%) is again at the top of the FTSE 100 after continued speculation in UK press that the Co. could be subject to a takeover attempt by Japanese Takeda Pharmaceuticals. Finally, Dufry (+3.0%) surged higher after the Co. proposed a dividend and announced the launch of a share buyback programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Greenback is somewhat mixed vs G10 peers overall, net gains vs high beta/riskier counterparts compared to losses vs safer-havens are sufficient to keep the index on an upward trajectory ahead the latest monthly US jobs data. Indeed, the DXY has probed above 90.500 again within a 90.600-300 range and remains on course to close the 1st week of April and Q2 on a firmer footing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi has gone from recent hero to bottom of the G10 pile as repeated failures to rally through 0.7300 vs the Usd has resulted in a loss of momentum, while the Nzd has also unwound relative gains vs the AUD, as the cross rebounds towards 1.0600. Note, however, Aud/Usd continues to reject 0.7700 and above advances with macro supply seen at 0.7690.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has lost some of its NAFTA-related positivity within a 1.2790-45 band vs its US rival, with a more cautious tone evident in the run up to Canada&rsquo;s employment update and perhaps a bit more spill-over in wake of Thursday&rsquo;s wider than forecast trade deficit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk-off sentiment due to a ramp up in US-China trade hostilities only partially underpinning the Jpy, as the headline pair trades between 107.00-45 parameters amidst reports underlying bids from Tokyo fund managers and charts flagging the 107.00-30 area as pivotal on a closing basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk510774185\"><strong>CHF/EUR/GBP</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All very rangebound vs the Dollar with little independent impetus before attention turns to NFP, but the Franc remains capped by latest SNB warnings about its high value that warrants ongoing attention, while Eur/Usd hovers above 1.2200 and Cable straddles 1.4000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may be somewhat premature, but by no means unprecedented to suggest that bonds could have marked out the boundaries for trade until US jobs data provides more direction and price movement. Certainly, activity has quietened down markedly in terms of turnover and volatility, but the overall risk averse tone remains intact with core debt underpinned vs underperformance in the Eurozone periphery, which some attribute to a combination of post-auction unwinding after Spain&rsquo;s latest issuance on Thursday plus simple profit taking following relative gains made in wake of ratings upgrades. Bunds and Gilts currently at 159.28 and 122.31, while US Treasuries tread cautiously just a few ticks above parity ahead of the big NFP event, and with the curve marginally flatter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices softened in late Asian trade and remain in close proximity to these levels after Trump&rsquo;s Administration responded to China&rsquo;s retaliation. Newsflow was restricted to comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak who claimed cooperation agreements with OPEC could be indefinite and does not expect proposals for a global oil deal extension to H1 2019. Gold remains subdued as the Greenback is firmer across the board with safe-haven flows seen overnight failing to support prices. In the base metals bloc, London copper retreats from yesterday&rsquo;s rally but remains stable as seasonal demand is expected to pick in Q2.</p>\r\n",

This latest announcement was in response to China&rsquo;s retaliation and dragged US stock index futures, while pressure in ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) was contained and later reversed amid commodity sector strength in Australia and JPY weakness. KOSPI (-0.5%) was lower with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics failing to benefit from better than expected prelim. Q1 oper. profit, as it also missed on revenue while some cited participants selling on the news and booking profits after the prior day&rsquo;s rally. Elsewhere, mainland China remained shut and Hang Seng (+1.2%) bucked the trend to trade firmly higher as it played catch up to the gains during the holiday closure. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful amid an indecisive risk tone in Japan and following a tepid Rinban announcement, with the BoJ in the market for just over JPY 600bln in up to 5yr JGBs.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat indecisive with the region pondering over US trade policies in which the recent effort by US officials to ease trade concerns which helped Wall St notch a 3<sup>rd</sup> consecutive gain, was thwarted after President Trump&rsquo;s order to consider an additional USD 100bln of tariffs against China. This latest announcement which was in response to China&rsquo;s retaliation, pressured US stock index futures with the mini Dow briefly declining around 500 points to test 24000 to the downside, while pressure in ASX 200 (Unch) and Nikkei 225 (Unch) has so far been contained by commodity sector strength in Australia and after the prior day&rsquo;s JPY weakness. KOSPI (-0.3%) is lower with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics failing to benefit from better than expected prelim. Q1 oper. profit, as it also missed on revenue while some cited participants selling on the news and booking profits after the prior day&rsquo;s rally. Elsewhere, mainland China remains shut and Hang Seng bucks the trend to trade firmly higher as it plays catch up to the gains during the holiday closure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD and CNH are softer overnight as US-China trade war concerns resurfaced after President Trump responded to China&rsquo;s retaliation with a possible USD 100bln of additional tariffs. This provided mild reprieve for the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts with GBP/USD recovering back above the 1.4000 level, while the announcement also spurred some flows into safe-haven JPY. However, the pull-back in USD/JPY was limited as support held at 107.00 and with markets tentative ahead of the key US NFP jobs data later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid an indecisive risk tone in Japan and following a tepid Rinban announcement, in which the BoJ were in the market for just over JPY 600bln in up to 5yr JGBs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
