On Thursday; US Initial jobless claims, Mexican Interest Rate, ECB&#39;s Constancio, Fed&#39;s Kashkari &amp; Kaplan, and BoE&#39;s Haldane to speak</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*ITALIAN POLITICS: On Wednesday, focus fell on political developments in the country as the 5-Star and League alliance gets closer to a Government coalition deal, that appears set to challenge EU on various fronts. The League and the M5S were looking to ask the ECB to scrape out EUR 250bln of the country&rsquo;s debt, though this was later denied. Italian BTPs were sold heavily, falling over 2 points in the session as uncertainty grew over the timing of a government agreement, initially scheduled for last Sunday.&nbsp; Later in the session, BTPs took a breather and moved-off lows after the League&rsquo;s economics chief said the two parties have completed the joint policy programme and passed on the document to leaders for its approval; other sources reported that the contract did not to include a Euro exit option. Italy&#39;s M5S leader Di Maio said details regarding the government contract will be distributed over the weekend, and will be followed by a M5S new online referendum vote. The FTSE MIB was also the lagged its peers, ending the session down more than 2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*BANK OF CANADA: BoC Deputy Governor Schembri recognised that lower interest rates creates financial vulnerabilities, arguing rates were below neutral due to NAFTA uncertainty, noting that the uncertainty is having a negative impact on businesses&rsquo; investment decisions. Schembri also argued that April&#39;s upward revision to potential output means that BOC has more room than expected to support demand without causing inflationary pressures in the near term, adding that Canada&#39;s recent deals on CETA and TPP are helping reduce trade barriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* TRADE: US President Trump said in a tweet the US has little to give to China whilst China has much to give, noting he has not seen demands from the country. On ZTE, he said it &lsquo;pertains to the larger trade deal&rsquo;. Separately, Trump claimed &#39;we&#39;ll have to see&#39; if the North Korea summit is still on and he will insist on its denuclearisation. Trump Security Adviser Bolton, during a Fox News radio interview, said the Trump-Kim summit should still happen even though North Korea is threatening to back out. House Ways and Means Chair Brady said Chinese Vice-Premier Liu wants to increase Chinese demand for US products, he does see problems in trade relations. Liu appeared optimistic about his expectations for talks this week. Elsewhere, White House Trade Adviser Navarro is said to be excluded from China talks, according to reports. Other reports suggested he will not be one of the principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL: EU&#39;s Juncker said he would like to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive, noting it is important for peace, highlighting the EU is very attached to multilateral system. Iran&rsquo;s oil minister mentioned that Iran will be doing its best to maintain production and continue exports</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*NAFTA: Mexico&rsquo;s economy minister Guajardo said it was impossible to reach an agreement on NAFTA by tomorrow, the soft &lsquo;deadline&rsquo; imposed by House Speaker Ryan last week. NAFTA deal negotiations remain ongoing. US President committed to getting better trade deal, as according to White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FED SPEAK: Fed&rsquo;s Williams (Voter, Hawkish) said the yield curve does not worry him but he will not ignore its signal and repeated comments from yesterday, &ldquo;he does not see inflation running away&rdquo;. Fed&rsquo;s Bostic (Voter, Dovish) sees strong consumer spending, but uncertainty remains depending on how people and firms will respond to tax cuts. He sees 3 rate hikes in 2018 given the US fiscal stimulus. On geopolitics, he noted the surplus could become a deficit if Iran oil not accessible. Fed&#39;s Bullard (Dove, Non-Voter) noted the US is close to neutral rate. He does not see yield curve inversion danger just now stating it has s a nice slope. Global rates are still low, and urged to keep this in mind. He believes it is unlikely that the US economy will outperform current forecasts</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*DATA: US Housing Starts Number fell to 1,287K in April missing expectations at 1,310K. Building Permits also fell but the figure came in at 1,352K and was pretty much in line with consensus. The breakdown appears much more encouraging than the headlines, as the drop was mostly attributed to multi-family activity, which surged back in March and saw some adjustment last month. Single-family starts rose by more than anticipated amid the bad weather hitting in March and April. Permits also rose for the period but remain overall flat for the last six months. Analysts at Pantheon noted housing activity has reached a peak for this cycle. US Industrial Production printed at 0.7%, beating slightly the consensus at 0.6% on the back of faster output growth signalling faster economic activity for Q2. Manufacturing Output was in line but encouraging enough to lift 3-year annualised growth to 4.6% in April. Business equipment production also provided support to the figure implying the fall seen in Q1 was only temporary. Analysts at Capital Economics argued that given the current economic conditions, a weaker dollar&nbsp; and improving relationships between US and China on trade, growth in the industrial sector will remain strong in the incoming months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EQUITIES: SPX +0.39% at 2722, NDX +0.60% at ,6929 DJI +0.24% at 24700.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS:&nbsp;Cons Cyclicals: +0.88%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.68%, Energy: +0.33%, Financials: -0.01%, Health Care: +0.48%, Industrials: +0.23, Materials: +0.93%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Equity futures consolidated around Tuesday&rsquo;s closing level until US traders got to their desks on Wednesday, content to roam in the range between 2705 and 2720 until afternoon trade, when the ES broke out, but couldn&rsquo;t manage to hold ground too far above the level after a bout of political headlines from the US (Navarro).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sector specifics, utilities underperformed given the defensive nature of the sector as it was the only sector in the red at market close following a risk on tone being taken by markets, on the flipside, materials outperformed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stocks specifics, Macy&rsquo;s (M) provided a strong earnings report and also boosted its FY guidance, this also boosted others in the retail sector (KSS, JWN, JCP). Micron (MU) another outperformer in the SPX on Wednesday following a new buy rating at RBC with a price target of $80. Pressuring the SPX was IQVIA Holdings (IQV) following reports during hours from the FDA that quality problems have been related to data provided by IQV, it said they found discrepancy in data which showed more than a 20% drop in the amount of fentanyl sold over five years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In M&amp;A news, National Amusements reportedly amended CBS&#39;s (CBS) bylaws to require a super majority of CBS board to approve dividends. This comes after CBS sued National Amusements, owned by the Redstones, to dilute their voting power on the board (the move would be from 80% to 17% on CBS&#39;s board) in a hope to prevent a merger with Viacom (VIAB). Later, Gasparino reported that CBS is still worried that Redstone will fire the board at tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting. Elsewhere, Zoetis (ZTS) is to acquire Abaxis (ABAX) for USD 83/shr, which equates to USD 2bln deal. Finally, the European Commission and DOJ hope to complete Monsanto (MON) and Bayer (BAYN GY) review by the end of May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*CRUDE: WTI futures settle USD 0.18 higher at 71.49/bbl, Brent futures settle USD 0.85 at 79.28/bbl. Brent continues to outperform WTI; today&rsquo;s divergence can be explained by lingering geopolitical tensions in the Middle East keeping a premium in Brent prices, while US crude output continuing to scale fresh highs weighed on WTI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The DOE energy inventory data was at odds with the data reported by the API on Tuesday; crude stocks drew down by 1.4mln (exp draw of 800k), while production continued to rise, this week by around 0.2% to 10.723mln BPD. Cushing stocks, meanwhile showed a small build, in line with the API data and the Genscape Cushing forecast, gasoline stocks drew deeper than expected 3.79mln (exp draw 1.4mln) and distillates drew by 92k, shallower than the expected 2.16mln draw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The IEA&rsquo;s monthly report cut 2018 global oil demand growth forecast to 1.4mln BPD due to rising oil prices. It also said OECD commercial oil inventories declined below the five-year average in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* OPEC chief Barkindo said compliance with the OPEC+ output cut deal was running at a record 149% in March. Separately, sources reported that Saudi Arabia believes a brief oil price spike driven by speculators is not a reason for producers to increase output, and said oil prices at $79/bbl are &lsquo;not yet&rsquo; too high; the rally towards $80/bbl is driven by Geopolitical tensions, not a supply shortage, according to four OPEC sources. Finally, Iran&#39;s oil minister says oil prices at $60-65/bbl are &#39;logical&#39; - and said that the US wanted higher prices to boost shale production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Elsewhere, Iran asked Chinese refiners to maintain imports in the face of US sanctions, and Nigeria&rsquo;s Trans-Forcados was shut due to a leak, though the news had little impact on prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* TREASURIES:&nbsp;US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 2 ticks lower at 118-17+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries ended the day pretty much unchanged, despite decent volumes and a busy day in the European fixed income complex, where Italian BTPs tumbled amid political uncertainty whilst German bunds acted as a safe haven alternative. Treasury yields were higher by less than 1bps, with the exception of the 10yr yield which was higher by just about 1bps, consolidating yesterday&rsquo;s gains above the 3% level. Heading towards settlement, 2s10s widened by c.1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FOREX: EUR: Bottom of the G10 pile as the single currency extended losses through 1.1800 after some barrier resistance and also breached a Fib around 1.1790 on the way to circa 1.1765 and fresh 2018 lows with events in Rome took their toll on the currency. However, a late and broad round of Greenback selling/profit taking after the latest official EM efforts to shore up increasingly depreciating currencies saw the headline pair re-test the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD, AUD, CAD: The non-US Dollars have displayed solid resilience for the most part, even when the DXY carved out a new YTD peak around 93.640, and proffered more when their peer pulled up, with the Kiwi nudging around 0.6900 again, AUDUSD recouping more data-related losses (wages missed overnight) and reclaiming 0.7500. Similarly, the Loonie rebounded further r from recent lows vs the USD, but with the aid of firmer than forecast Canadian factory orders and ongoing hopes that remaining NAFTA &lsquo;Is and Ts&rsquo; can be dotted and crossed before Thursday&rsquo;s soft deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, JPY, CHF: All narrowly mixed and choppy vs the USD as Cable lost grip of 1.3500 again before finding some underlying support (albeit on the aforementioned Buck retreat) and USDJPY meandered between 110.00-40, with the JPY seeing intermittent bids on safe-haven grounds vs offers after a surprise negative Japanese GDP read overnight. Meanwhile, the Franc pivoted around parity, but outperformed the EUR as the cross slipped under 1.1800, possibly prompting some verbal attention from the SNB, but then&nbsp; rebounded above the figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* COMING UP: AUSTRALIAN LABOUR MARKET (Overnight): Australia releases labour market data on Thursday and employment is expected to increase 15K, keeping the unemployment rate at 5.5%. &ldquo;While it never seemed likely that the exceptionally fast pace of job creation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>throughout 2017 would be sustained for long in 2018, we doubt the 6,300 fall in employment in February and lacklustre 4,900 rise in March is a sign of things to come,&rdquo; said Capital Economics. Looking at labour market indicators, the NAB business conditions index &nbsp;rose 6 point to +21, its equal highest level since the survey began in 1997 with NAB noting that employment conditions posted strong gains in the month. NAB Group Chief Economist Oster said, &ldquo;The improvement in the employment index was particularly welcome in the light of the ABS reporting a slowdown in jobs growth in recent months. Historically, the NAB Survey does a good job at looking through short-term cycles in the ABS data and so we think the labour market continues to improve.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

Separately, sources reported that Saudi Arabia believes a brief oil price spike driven by speculators is not a reason for producers to increase output, and said oil prices at $79/bbl are &lsquo;not yet&rsquo; too high; the rally towards $80/bbl is driven by Geopolitical tensions, not a supply shortage, according to four OPEC sources. Finally, Iran&#39;s oil minister says oil prices at $60-65/bbl are &#39;logical&#39; - and said that the US wanted higher prices to boost shale production.</li>\r\n  <li>* Elsewhere, Iran asked Chinese refiners to maintain imports in the face of US sanctions, and Nigeria&rsquo;s Trans-Forcados was shut due to a leak, though the news had little impact on prices.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

From a fundamental and flow perspective, events in Rome took their toll on the Eur as the 5-Star and League alliance get closer to a Government coalition deal that looks set to challenge EU and Brussels on various front, while the market base is still long and arguably top heavy. However, a late and broad round of Greenback selling/profit taking after the latest official EM efforts to shore up increasingly depreciating currencies saw the headline pair re-test the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The non-US Dollars have displayed solid resilience for the most part, even when the DXY carved out a new ytd peak around 93.640, and proffered more when their peer pulled up, with the Kiwi nudging over 0.6900 again, Aud/Usd recouping more data-related losses (wages missed overnight) and reclaiming 0.7500 just in time or perhaps too soon for another big option expiry at the round number. Similarly, the Loonie rebounded further from recent lows vs the Usd, but with the aid of firmer than forecast Canadian factory orders and ongoing hopes that remaining NAFTA &lsquo;Is and Ts&rsquo; can be dotted and crossed before Thursday&rsquo;s soft deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed and choppy vs the Usd as Cable lost grip of 1.3500 again before finding some underlying support (albeit on the aforementioned Buck retreat) and Usd/Jpy meandered between 110.00-40, with the Jpy seeing intermittent bids on safe-haven grounds vs offers after a surprise negative Japanese GDP read overnight. Meanwhile, the Franc pivoted around parity, but outperformed the Eur as the cross slipped under 1.1800 &ndash; possibly prompting some verbal attention from the SNB.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) was also dampened by disappointing GDP data from Japan which contracted for the first time in over 2 years and the KOSPI (+0.2%) was kept subdued for most the session by a withering of the geopolitical climate after North Korea cancelled a high-level inter-Korean meeting in resentment to US-South Korea joint military drills and also threatened to reconsider summit with US if they insist on North Korea giving up its nuclear program. Elsewhere, the widespread downbeat tone overshadowed a firm liquidity injection by the PBoC which ensured the Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) conformed to the losses, while ASX 200 (+0.5%) bucked the trend with gains seen across a broad range of sectors and after subdued wage growth data added to the case for the RBA to continue holding off on rate adjustments. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat and held near the prior day&rsquo;s lows as yields attempted to track the upside in US counterparts after the US 10yr briefly approached 3.1% and its highest in around 7 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 140bln via 7-day &amp; CNY 120bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily injection of CNY 200bln.

(BBC/Nikkei)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea said it will never engage in economic trade with US in return for dropping nuclear program and that it rejects Libya-style denuclearization for the country, according to state media reports. Furthermore, North Korea added that it will need to reconsider summit with US if it insists on North Korea giving up nuclear program and that US President Trump will remain as failed leader if he chooses to follow along the lines of past US presidents. (KCNA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korea Unification Ministry said the decision by North Korea to cancel high-level meeting for today is regrettable and it urged North Korea to return to talks, while the South Korean Defence Ministry said it will go ahead with drills with US as planned.

Later reports stated that the populist parties proposed debt bought by ECB not be calculated in EU stability pact evaluations for all countries. As a result, Italian banks including Ubi Banca (-1.9%), Bper Banca (-1.0%). Finecobank (-2.3%), UniCredit (-2.6%), Banca Mediolanum (-3.0%) and Banco BPM (-2.7%) are all resting at the bottom of the index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, material names are benefitting from the firmer base metal prices with the sector outperforming its peers. In terms of individual movers, Micro Focus (+8.8%) is at the top of the FTSE following expectations of better earnings than shown in their guidance. Paddy Power (+5.8%) is also riding high after reports the company is in talks to acquire FanDuel amid the sudden lifting of federal ban on sports betting in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY has now climbed above 93.500 and tested major chart resistance just above, largely at the expense of extended EUR weakness as the single currency sinks to the bottom of the G10 pile. Eur/Usd held above 1.1800 for a while amidst reported barrier option interest, but big figure psychological and sentimental support have way relatively quickly after that with market contacts also noting sell stops in the Eur cross vs AUD. Note, the Aud was an overnight laggard on softer than forecast Aussie wage data that highlights RBA guidance based on benign pay trends and the impact on inflation overall. Moving back to the DXY it remains firmly underpinned and on course for further upside technically, while the fundamental backdrop also looks supportive as US Treasury yields consolidate close to their highs. However, NK&rsquo;s decision to postpone its meeting with South Korea and dithering over a summit with the US is a potential counterweight along with ongoing heightened tensions with Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also on a weaker footing as Cable retreats below 1.3500 again amidst more negative Brexit headlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, the Kiwi is the biggest G10 winner by virtue of short covering with Nzd/Usd hovering near the upper end of a 0.6895-50 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhat caught between conflicting impulses in wake of unexpectedly weak Japanese GDP data overnight (1st contraction in 2 years) and safe-haven demand due to the breakdown in NK-SK/US &lsquo;entente cordiale&rsquo;, with Usd/Jpy above 110.00, but not yet breaking up/out of the 200 DMA resistance zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrowly mixed with the Franc seeing some FTQ in-flows as Usd/Chf pivots around parity and Eur/Chf tests 1.1800, while the Loonie meanders between 1.28540-75 just 24 hours before a potential NAFTA agreement that Canadian PM Trudeau believes is possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much further deviation in core debt, or upside for German debt even though investors scrambled to get their hands on the latest 10 year Bund cash offering (auction almost 3 times oversubscribed and cover double compared to the previous sale). However, core Eurozone bonds remain firmly underpinned as Italian BTPs succumb to more heavy selling pressure and losses stack up to over 100 ticks, while US Treasuries continue to consolidate and unwind some of Tuesday&rsquo;s marked bear-steepening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surprise build in API crude inventories overnight is still weighing on oil, as the fossil fuel is negative for the day, with WTI currently down 0.36% and Brent 0.65% lower. Morgan Stanley (MS) forecasts WTI prices at USD 71/BBL for Q4 2018 and USD 73/BBL for Q1 2019. Safe haven flows and a slightly softer greenback are resulting in Gold trading higher, currently up 0.31% on the day. Chinese Steel and Iron ore futures have undone the gains seen on Tuesday following but still hover close to a 8 week high, with the two metals at USD 577.23/tonne and USD 75.65/tonne respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IEA says global oil demand forecast to 1.4mln BPD vs. prev. 1.5mln BPD in prev. month, &quot;too soon&quot; to predict impact on Iranian crude from sanctions, call on OPEC crude to average 32.35mln BPD for 2018, nearly 600K BPD above April output.

Finecobank (-2.3%), UniCredit (-2.6%), Banca Mediolanum (-3.0%) and Banco BPM (-2.7%) are all resting at the bottom of the index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, material names are benefitting from the firmer base metal prices with the sector outperforming its peers. In terms of individual movers, Micro Focus (+8.8%) is at the top of the FTSE following expectations of better earnings than shown in their guidance. Paddy Power (+5.8%) is also riding high after reports the company is in talks to acquire FanDuel amid the sudden lifting of federal ban on sports betting in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index has pulled back from pulled back from fresh 2018 peaks just shy of 93.500, to the benefit of most major rivals, but not EM currencies that continue to flounder (Usd/Try climbing further to 4.5000 for example). The DXY remains firmly above 93.000 and on course for further upside technically, while the fundamental backdrop also looks supportive as US Treasury yields consolidate close to their highs. However, NK&rsquo;s decision to postpone its meeting with South Korea and dithering over a summit with the US is a potential counterweight along with ongoing heightened tensions with Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bucking the broad trend of recovering some lost ground vs the Dollar, as Cable retreats below 1.3500 again amidst more negative Brexit headlines, while the single currency continues to feel the weight of heavy long positioning (market base bordering on overbought levels perhaps), more evidence of a downturn in Eurozone economic momentum and renewed Italian political angst. Eur/Usd is slipping to new ytd lows just above 1.1800, after hitting fast money offers around 1.1850 and with final pan Eurozone/German inflation data showing unrevised and still soft prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is the biggest G10 winner by virtue of Greenback consolidation and relative Aud underperformance following softer than expected Aussie wage data overnight that merely backs up the RBA&rsquo;s benign outlook on pay and overall inflation. Nzd/Usd is hovering near the upper end of a 0.6895-50 range, while Aud/Usd is midway between 0.7495-50 and may be stifled by more big option expiry interest at 0.7500, as the Aud/Nzd cross settles towards the bottom of 1.0900-1.0860 trading parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhat caught between conflicting impulses in wake of unexpectedly weak Japanese GDP data overnight (1st contraction in 2 years) and safe-haven demand due to the breakdown in NK-SK/US &lsquo;entente cordiale&rsquo;, with Usd/Jpy above 110.00, but not yet breaking up/out of the 200 DMA resistance zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both firmer vs the Usd on balance, with the Franc seeing some FTQ in-flows as Usd/Chf pivots around parity and Eur/Chf tests 1.1800, while the Loonie meanders between 1.28540-75 just 24 hours before a potential NAFTA agreement that Canadian PM Trudeau believes is possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much further deviation in core debt, or upside for German debt even though investors scrambled to get their hands on the latest 10 year Bund cash offering (auction almost 3 times oversubscribed and cover double compared to the previous sale). However, core Eurozone bonds remain firmly underpinned as Italian BTPs succumb to more heavy selling pressure and losses stack up to over 100 ticks, while US Treasuries continue to consolidate and unwind some of Tuesday&rsquo;s marked bear-steepening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surprise build in API crude inventories overnight is still weighing on oil, as the fossil fuel is negative for the day, with WTI currently down 0.36% and Brent 0.65% lower. Morgan Stanley (MS) forecasts WTI prices at USD 71/BBL for Q4 2018 and USD 73/BBL for Q1 2019. Safe haven flows and a slightly softer greenback are resulting in Gold trading higher, currently up 0.31% on the day. Chinese Steel and Iron ore futures have undone the gains seen on Tuesday following but still hover close to a 8 week high, with the two metals at USD 577.23/tonne and USD 75.65/tonne respectively.</p>\r\n",

Nothing on the domestic calendar today, so cues and direction will continue to be gleaned from elsewhere as Bunds extend gains to 45 ticks at 158.21 on the aforementioned Italian coalition situation that looks set to result in a populist partnership and put the new regime in Rome on a collision path with Brussels on various issues.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD remained firm with the DXY above the 93.00 level after the rise in US yields and with markets leaning more towards the likelihood of 4 hikes this year following an upward revision to Retail Sales. This kept the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts subdued, while data was also in focus for Asia-Pac currencies as AUD staggered on softer than expected wages which the RBA have cited on numerous occasions as a factor for the subdued inflation. Elsewhere, the risk averse tone spurred flows into safe-haven JPY, but with price action relatively contained as disappointing GDP data also stoked some calls for future BoJ action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Wage Price Index (Q1) Q/Q 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.6%); (Q1) Y/Y 2.1% vs. Exp. 2.1% (Prev. 2.1%). (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were lacklustre mainly due to a firmer greenback which pressured gold heavily in the prior session and although the precious metal has nursed losses overnight, prices still remain as a sub-USD1300/oz level. Elsewhere, copper traded flat after the prior day&rsquo;s declines as the negative risk tone kept prices subdued, while WTI crude futures were marginally weaker and struggled to hold above USD 71.00 following the USD-induced pullback and surprise build in API crude inventories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (May 11) +4.854mln vs. Exp. -0.8mln (Prev. -1.850mln).

(BBC/Nikkei)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea said it will never engage in economic trade with US in return for dropping nuclear program and that it rejects Libya-style denuclearization for the country, according to state media reports. Furthermore, North Korea added that it will need to reconsider summit with US if it insists on North Korea giving up nuclear program and that US President Trump will remain as failed leader if he chooses to follow along the lines of past US presidents. (KCNA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korea Unification Ministry said the decision by North Korea to cancel high-level meeting for today is regrettable and it urged North Korea to return to talks, while the South Korean Defence Ministry said it will go ahead with drills with US as planned. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif stated that after Brussels talks we are on the right track and a lot will depend on what we can do in the next few weeks, while he also stated it is a good start and that political was agreement reached on steps to take. Elsewhere, the Iranian Nuclear Chief stated on state TV the EU should make up for US withdrawal from the deal or else Tehran will enrich uranium &ldquo;stronger than before&rdquo;, while the top adviser to Iran&rsquo;s Supreme leader stated that Tehran will not renegotiate the nuclear deal and will not talk about its missile programme.

The curve bear-steepened with 2yr yields higher by c.3bps and 30yr yields higher by c.7bps. The10yr yield hit the highest level since May 2011 and took out the April 25th high at 3.033%, 2s30s and 2s10s both widened by c.4bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled down 20+ ticks lower at 118-19+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Williams (Voter, Hawkish) said gradual rate rises and 3 or 4 hikes this year are the right direction for policy but also stated he is conscious rates will remain lower versus historical levels. Williams also commented that he is not concerned if inflation overshoots its target by a few tenths and sees wages rising later this year as economy continues to strengthen, while he added that guidance on &lsquo;accommodative&rsquo; policy may need to be tweaked at some point. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan (Non-Voter, Neutral) said the US could achieve 3% economic growth but hinges on Labour participation and productivity, while he also stated he is not set on 2 or 3 more hikes this year and is watching the yield curve.

Furthermore, Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) was also dampened by disappointing GDP data from Japan which contracted for the first time in over 2 years and the KOSPI (+0.2%) was kept subdued for most the session by a withering of the geopolitical climate after North Korea cancelled a high-level inter-Korean meeting in resentment to US-South Korea joint military drills and also threatened to reconsider summit with US if they insist on North Korea giving up its nuclear program. Elsewhere, the widespread downbeat tone overshadowed a firm liquidity injection by the PBoC which ensured the Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) conformed to the losses, while ASX 200 (+0.5%) bucked the trend with gains seen across a broad range of sectors and after subdued wage growth data added to the case for the RBA to continue holding off on rate adjustments. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat and held near the prior day&rsquo;s lows as yields attempted to track the upside in US counterparts after the US 10yr briefly approached 3.1% and its highest in around 7 years.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are mostly negative on spill-over selling from US where the DJIA snapped its 8-day win streak and stocks posted their worst performance in around 3 weeks amid rising yields as markets priced the chances of 4 hikes this year. Furthermore, Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) is also dampened by disappointing GDP data from Japan which contracted for the first time in over 2 years and the KOSPI (-0.1%) was kept subdued by a withering of the geopolitical climate after North Korea cancelled a high-level inter-Korean meeting and threatened to pull out of summit with US in resentment to US-South Korea joint military drills. Elsewhere, the widespread downbeat tone overshadowed a firm liquidity effort by the PBoC which saw Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.8%) conform to the losses, while ASX 200 (+0.5%) bucks the trend with gains seen across a broad range sectors and after subdued wage growth data added to the case for the RBA to keep holding off on rate adjustments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD remains firm with the DXY above the 93.00 level after the rise in US yields and with markets leaning more towards the likelihood of 4 hikes this year following upward revision to Retail Sales. This kept the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts subdued, while data was also in focus for Asia-Pac currencies with AUD pressured on softer than expected wages which the RBA have cited on numerous occasions as a factor for the subdued inflation. Elsewhere, the risk averse tone has spurred flows into safe-haven JPY, but with price action relatively contained as disappointing GDP data also stokes some calls for future BoJ action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat and hold near the prior day&rsquo;s lows as yields attempt to track the upside in US counterparts after the US 10yr briefly approached 3.1% and its highest in around 7 years.</p>\r\n",
