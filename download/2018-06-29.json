After announcing the tariffs, Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland, said that Canada had no choice to retaliate. On NAFTA, Freeland said she expects talks to resume after Mexico&rsquo;s Presidential election on Sunday, where AMLO is expected to have a commanding victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>* DATA: </strong>Friday&rsquo;s personal consumption data was mixed with the inflationary data largely higher than expected, while the growth elements were weaker than forecast. Headline PCE rose to 2.3% while Core PCE rose to 2.0% Y/Y, the first time it has reached the Fed&rsquo;s 2.0% target in six years (give yourselves a pat on the back). Scotiabank note that this may not be a time for celebration. &ldquo;The rise may be driven by somewhat transitory considerations,&rdquo; the Canadian bank said, &ldquo;One is gasoline prices with energy up 12.8% Y/Y. Two is that there are transitory upsides of some one-off components that were exerting transitory downsides last year, such a mobile phone service pricing. Three is probably the temporary lagging effect of prior USD movements.&rdquo; Real personal spending in April was revised lower to 0.3%, while May spending was flat, prompting a number of nowcast models (NY Fed, Atlanta Fed etc) to cut their forecast for Q2 GDP growth. &nbsp;<br />Canadian GDP rose 0.1% in April vs. expectations of 0.0%, which should reinforce expectations of a July rate hike from the Bank of Canada. Market pricing of a rate hike next month jumped to 80% from 67% in the wake of the data and TD Securities say this key hurdle to a July hike has now been overcome. &nbsp;<br /><strong>* SPX +0.08% at 2719, NASDAQ COMP +0.13% at 7041, DJI +0.24% at 24275.</strong> SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -0.15%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.17%, Energy: +0.65%, Financials: 0.12%, Health Care: +0.16%, Industrials: +0.21%, Materials: +0.23%, Telecoms: -0.62%, Tech: +0.02%, Utilities: +0.03%. &nbsp;<br />*<strong> FUTURES:</strong> A quiet day for the Emini500 as it grinded higher amid no specific newsflow, however the gains were not enough for the index to finish in the green for the week. The ES found some support around the 50dma at 2722 before climbing higher at the open and settling around the 2740 level. In late trade a large market imbalance was seen which led to some selling in the ES erasing some of the earlier gains.&nbsp;<br /><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Vertex (VRTX), Nike (NKE), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Celgene (CELG) led the SPX on Friday. Vertex spiked higher after analyst chatter said that they will benefit from Galapagos&rsquo;s (GLPG) disappointing study results. Nike had a strong earnings report, Wells Fargo (WFC) received the Fed stress test results, and then announced a $24.5bln share repurchase programme and increased&nbsp;<br />dividend by 10% to $0.43/shr, and Celgene&rsquo;s phase 3 Medalist study met its primary and secondary endpoints. On the bottom end of the SPX, Under Armour (UAA) and Gap (GPS) underperformed despite initially benefiting from Nike&rsquo;s forward guidance. Constellation Brands (STZ) were the biggest laggard today after its earnings. &nbsp;<br /><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Nike (NKE) beat on both top and bottom line, announced a $15bln share repurchase programme and raised its revenue growth rate view for FY19. This saw the stock outperform in the SPX among WFC and VRTX. At the bottom of the SPX saw Constellation Brands (STZ) which beat on EPS, revenues were in line however it provided estimates for FY19 EPS which came in lower than analyst expectations.&nbsp;<br /><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) SETTLES UNCHANGED AT 120-06. &nbsp;</strong><br />Treasury trading was particularly quiet, despite it being monthend, quarter-end, and half-end. Heading into the afternoon, volumes declined as it appeared most market players tried to get away early ahead of the Independence Day holiday next week. Despite equities trending higher, the risk-on sentiment failed to send bonds lower with IFR noting slightly month-end demand keeping bonds elevated. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q8) SETTLE $0.70 HIGHER AT $74.15/BBL, BRENT (Q8) FUTURES SETTLE $1.59 HIGHER AT $79.44/BBL&nbsp;</strong><br />The crude rally continued into Friday trade despite comments from Russia&rsquo;s energy minister Novak who stated Russian energy companies are to keep increases proportional to the previous cuts, and that following the OPEC+ deal, Russia will increase production by 200kBPD. Brent did outperform on Friday following news from Libya that they are expecting to call Force Majeur on its Zueitina and Hariga ports from Sunday, where they expect an output loss of 350kBPD, which makes total loss from current disruption at 800k BPD. &nbsp;The weekly rally has continued since Tuesday&rsquo;s report that the US is pushing allies to reduce imports from Iran to zero.&nbsp;<br />US Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count (29 Jun) 858 (Prev. 862) US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count (29 Jun) 1047 (Prev. 1052) US Baker Hughes Gas Rig Count (29 Jun) 187 (Prev. 188)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;* FX - WEEKLY&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>DXY &ndash; </strong>Climbed throughout the week to temporarily reclaim a 95.00 handle in a week dominated by trade developments as focus on the Fed took a backseat. Tensions were spurred by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stating that measures are not just specific to China but to all countries trying to steal US technology. Trump then adopted a more conciliatory stance by opting channels already in place such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. On the data front,&nbsp;sentiment for the USD was partially soured by Q1 final GDP being unexpectedly revised lower to 2.0% from 2.2%. DXY gave back 95.00 after a resurgent EUR towards the end of the week, whilst month-end models also pointed to USD selling.&nbsp;<br /><strong>EUR &ndash;</strong> Fell victim to the firmer USD as the week progressed with EUR/USD surrendering both the 1.17 and 1.16 handles but avoided breaching lows seen last week. EUR was lent a helping hand at the back-end of the week by a breakthrough at the EU leaders summit on the issue of migration which tempered political tensions in Germany and soothed sentiment by seeing Italy refrain from walking away from the table. EUR/USD ran out of steam at 1.1666 with sentiment then soured by source reports suggesting ECB&#39;s Draghi is said to have warned Eurozone leaders that countries are facing lower confidence, adding that EU trade tensions will have a larger impact.&nbsp;<br /><strong>GBP &ndash;</strong> GBP slipped to a 7-month low of 1.3068 throughout the week vs. the USD as the aforementioned greenback outmuscled its peers. Momentum to the downside for GBP was exacerbated by BoE newbie Haskel who made a less hawkish impression than his predecessor McCafferty at his confirmation hearing and is subsequently unlikely to represent a direct replacement of his voting pattern. Reprieve was granted and 1.3100 reclaimed in GBP/USD amid an upward revision to Q1 UK GDP from 0.1% to 0.2% (BoE had hoped for 0.3%). EU summit unsurprisingly delivered little in the way of progress with EU leaders more than happy to relay that message to the public.&nbsp;<br /><strong>CAD &ndash;</strong> Cagey start to the week before Poloz took time to note the uncertainties facing the Canadian economy which saw pricing for a rate hike decline to beneath 50%. USD/CAD upside was short-lived as greenback softness emerged before USD/CAD took out 1.3200 to the downside amid domestic GDP figures which reported M/M growth of 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.0%.&nbsp;<br /><strong>NZD </strong>&ndash; NZD slid throughout the week with the latest RBNZ policy announcement seeing the Bank keep rates unchanged as expected and reiterate that rates will remain at the current level for a considerable period and that the possibilities of a future hike or cut were evenly balanced. From a technical perspective, with the recent move to the downside leading to fresh 2018 lows, the next target to the downside for markets after the psychological 0.6700 figure could be that of the May 2016 low at 0.6676.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY &ndash; Climbed throughout the week to temporarily reclaim a 95.00 handle in a week dominated by trade developments as focus on the Fed took a backseat. Tensions were spurred by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stating that measures are not just specific to China but to all countries trying to steal US technology. Trump then adopted a more conciliatory stance by opting channels already in place such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. On the data front, sentiment for the USD was partially soured by Q1 final GDP being unexpectedly revised lower to 2.0% from 2.2%. DXY gave back 95.00 after a resurgent EUR towards the end of the week, whilst month-end models also pointed to USD selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; Fell victim to the firmer USD as the week progressed with EUR/USD surrendering both the 1.17 and 1.16 handles but avoided breaching lows seen last week. EUR was lent a helping hand at the back-end of the week by a breakthrough at the EU leaders summit on the issue of migration which tempered political tensions in Germany and soothed sentiment by seeing Italy refrain from walking away from the table. EUR/USD ran out of steam at 1.1666 with sentiment then soured by source reports suggesting ECB&#39;s Draghi is said to have warned Eurozone leaders that countries are facing lower confidence, adding that EU trade tensions will have a larger impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; GBP slipped to a 7-month low of 1.3068 throughout the week vs. the USD as the aforementioned greenback out-muscled it&rsquo;s peers. Momentum to the downside for GBP was exacerbated by BoE newbie Haskel who made a less hawkish impression than his predecessor McCafferty at his confirmation hearing and is subsequently unlikely to represent a direct replacement of his voting pattern. Reprieve was granted and 1.3100 reclaimed in GBP/USD amid an upward revision to Q1 UK GDP from 0.1% to 0.2% (BoE had hoped for 0.3%). EU summit unsurprisingly delivered little in the way of progress with EU leaders more than happy to relay that message to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &ndash; Cagey start to the week before Poloz took time to note the uncertainties facing the Canadian economy which saw pricing for a rate hike decline to beneath 50%. USD/CAD upside was short-lived as greenback softness emerged before USD/CAD took out 1.3200 to the downside amid domestic GDP figures which reported M/M growth of 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.0%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD &ndash; NZD slid throughout the week with the latest RBNZ policy announcement seeing the Bank keep rates unchanged as expected and reiterate that rates will remain at the current level for a considerable period and that the possibilities of a future hike or cut were evenly balanced. From a technical perspective, with the recent move to the downside leading to fresh 2018 lows, the next target to the downside for markets after the psychological 0.6700 figure could be that of the May 2016 low at 0.6676.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

However, it was not all doom and gloom for stocks as a late breakthrough at the EU summit later provided the region with a mild uplift. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.1%) rallied amid outperformance in tech and plans to ease foreign investment restrictions which overshadowed the switch to a weekly net liquidity drain by the PBoC, although the 3 big telecom names were mixed after their spin-off JV China Tower received approval for a Hong Kong IPO which is set to be the largest globally since Alibaba. Finally, 10yr JGBs were slightly softer amid modest gains in Japanese stocks and after the BoJ cut its purchase amounts in the 5yr-10yr maturities, although the reaction to the Rinban was muted in comparison to previous similar reductions. &nbsp;<br />US Ambassador to China Branstad said the Trump administration is unconvinced China is willing to make enough progress on trade issues soon enough while he added there is scepticism regarding promises China has made and the US wants to see openings carried out. (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />China has reduced the amount of industrial sectors restricted from foreign investment, as Beijing increases its appeal to international businesses ahead of a looming trade war with the US. (FT)&nbsp;<br />PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day reverse repos, for a weekly drain of CNY 370bln vs. CNY 140bln injection W/W. (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.6166 (Prev. 6.5960)&nbsp;<br />EU/UK/US&nbsp;<br />EU leaders reached an agreement on migration at the EU summit which include Mediterranean centres for migrants to be kept in on a voluntary basis and in which refugees will be shared among EU members on a voluntary basis. Furthermore, the leaders agreed they must ensure effective control of external borders and prevent uncontrolled migration that was seen in 2015, while EU leaders also agreed to extend economic sanctions against Russia for another 6 months. Additionally, EU leaders also signalled intentions to respond to potential tariffs on cars, should trade tensions escalate. (Newswires) Note: EU leaders had initially failed to formally approve a final EU summit joint conclusions statement after Italy blocked all agreements until demands regarding migration were included in the final conclusions which had prompted the EU to cancel the press conference. &nbsp;<br />ECB sources say they are considering buying bonds with longer maturities as of next year in order to keep duration at the same level. Sources added that minor deviations from capital keys may be tolerated during reinvestments. (Newswires) &nbsp;<br />EU&#39;s Barnier says that progress has been made on Brexit but divergences remain with official European Council statement stating that no substantial progress has been made on Ireland, adding further progress is welcome on the withdrawal pact.

Italian and German bourses are benefitting the most from reduced tensions, with the two respective indexes up 1.7% and 1.5% on the day after hitting multi-month lows earlier in the week. FTSE 100 is being weighed on by a stronger GBP as the UK posted positive GDP figures. US equity futures hampered in recent trade by reports via Axios that US President Trump is said to have told advisors he wants the US to withdraw from the WTO.&nbsp;<br />IT names are benefitting from the improved risk tone as investors return to higher Beta assets, with the sector the current outperformer (+1.9%). &nbsp;<br />Bank stock are in focus, with the US Fed approving 34 of 35 capital plans in the second part of the bank stress tests.

Optimism surrounding the deal has largely been spurred by relief regarding recent tensions within the CDU/CSU alliance in Germany. CSU&rsquo;s Michelbach has viewed the deal as a &lsquo;positive signal&rsquo; and thus markets are optimistic that this could pave the way for a mending of relations. Furthermore, the fact that Italy were able commit to the deal and avoid walking away has been met with positivity in the market; albeit Salvini has stressed the need for &lsquo;concrete commitments. In terms of price action, EUR/USD soared through the 1.1600 level during thin Asia-Pac trading hours to make a high print of 1.1666 but still some distance of the 1.1720 high seen earlier in the week. EUR unfazed by in-line EZ CPI (Y/Y 2.0%)&nbsp;<br />The sharp rise in the EUR has naturally pressured the DXY which has given up its 95.00 handle to trade lower by around 0.5%. Subsequently, the USD is softer against a bulk of its major counterparts with JPY the exception to the rule amid the broader risk environment spurred by events in Brussels. USD/JPY sits marginally higher for the session with the move to the upside running out of steam ahead of 110.80 with exporter offers from 110.80-90 capping gains.&nbsp;<br />GBP is also firmer vs. the USD (but softer vs. EUR) and has subsequently reclaimed a 1.3100 handle. Brexit-related rhetoric from overnight was unsurprisingly inconclusive and generic with PM May stating that she wants a deal on Brexit that will work for both UK and EU. Perhaps more interestingly, Business Insider sources suggest the EU will reject any Brexit deal that stipulates the UK remains with the goods single market. GBP boosted above 1.3150 to a high of 1.3183 after Q1 GDP Q/Q was revised higher to 0.2% from 0.1% and thus provided some food for thought at the BoE ahead of their August meeting (albeit the MPC had been looking for a firmer upward revision to 0.3%).&nbsp;<br />Elsewhere, broad USD softness has lent a helping hand to AUD with AUD/USD paring the softness seen in the wake of another PBoC devaluation which had earlier pressured CNH to its weakest since November.&nbsp;<br />FIXED INCOME&nbsp;<br />Fixed income markets initially saw a softer open during early Eurex trade amid an uptick in risk appetite after the aforementioned deal on migration at the EU summit. The exception to the rule was that of BTPs with a narrowing of the IT/GE spread as markets digested the ramifications for domestic German politics and relief that Italy hadn&rsquo;t caused a breakdown in negotiations given the anti-immigration views held by the newly appointed government. Thereafter, in what has been a choppy morning of price action thus far, curve flattening was seen in Europe after ECB sources stated the Bank are considering buying bonds with longer maturities as of next year in order to keep duration at the same level. Sources went onto state that minor deviations from capital keys may be tolerated during reinvestments. Prices then reversed course once again in a move lead by Gilts as markets repriced expectations for a move by the BoE at their August meeting with the UK 10yr extending losses below 123.00&nbsp;<br />COMMODITIES&nbsp;<br />Diverging performance in energy markets, with WTI -0.3% and Brent +0.25%, after WTI hit its highest level in 4 years during Thursdays trade and set for its longest quarterly rise in 8 years, as supply disruptions continue to squeeze the US oil market alongside overarching trade tariff concerns. &nbsp;<br />In the metals scope, gold is up slightly around USD 1,250/Oz level, as the dollar falls off. This comes after gold hit a 6-month low in the previous session, and was set for its worst monthly performance in over 1 year. Shanghai steel is set for its best quarter in 5 as Chinese demand continues to grow, with the construction material up 2% on the day, and +15% in April-June. Zinc has parred the losses seen in early trade following planned output cuts of 10% by smelters, but is still set for its worst quarter since 2015. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Positive UK GDP figures lift GBP, pressure FTSE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equity bourses are higher (Stoxx 600 +1.19%) after the EU struck a deal for immigrants in the most recent EU summit, settling tensions within the region. Italian and German bourses are benefitting the most from reduced tensions, with the two respective indexes up 1.7% and 1.5% on the day after hitting multi-month lows earlier in the week. FTSE 100 is being weighed on by a stronger GBP as the UK posted positive GDP figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IT names are benefitting from the improved risk tone as investors return to higher Beta assets, with the sector the current outperformer (+1.9%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bank stock are in focus, with the US Fed approving 34 of 35 capital plans in the second part of the bank stress tests. CaixaBank (+4.8%) also reached an agreement to sell 80% of its real estate business to private equity fund Lone Star. Gross book value of real estate assets as of end-October 2017 was around EUR 12.8bln</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early European trade has been dictated by the firmer EUR seen in the wake of EU leaders reaching an agreement on migration at the EU summit. Optimism surrounding the deal has largely been spurred by relief regarding recent tensions within the CDU/CSU alliance in Germany. CSU&rsquo;s Michelbach has viewed the deal as a &lsquo;positive signal&rsquo; and thus markets are optimistic that this could pave the way for a mending of relations. Furthermore, the fact that Italy were able commit to the deal and avoid walking away has been met with positivity in the market; albeit Salvini has stressed the need for &lsquo;concrete commitments. In terms of price action, EUR/USD soared through the 1.1600 level during thin Asia-Pac trading hours to make a high print of 1.1666 but still some distance of the 1.1720 high seen earlier in the week. EUR unfazed by in-line EZ CPI (Y/Y 2.0%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sharp rise in the EUR has naturally pressured the DXY which has given up its 95.00 handle to trade lower by around 0.5%.

USD/JPY sits marginally higher for the session with the move to the upside running out of steam ahead of 110.80 with exporter offers from 110.80-90 capping gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP is also firmer vs. the USD (but softer vs. EUR) and has subsequently reclaimed a 1.3100 handle. Brexit-related rhetoric from overnight was unsurprisingly inconclusive and generic with PM May stating that she wants a deal on Brexit that will work for both UK and EU. Perhaps more interestingly, Business Insider sources suggest the EU will reject any Brexit deal that stipulates the UK remains with the goods single market. GBP boosted above 1.3150 to a high of 1.3183 after Q1 GDP Q/Q was revised higher to 0.2% from 0.1% and thus provided some food for thought at the BoE ahead of their August meeting (albeit the MPC had been looking for a firmer upward revision to 0.3%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, broad USD softness has lent a helping hand to AUD with AUD/USD paring the softness seen in the wake of another PBoC devaluation which had earlier pressured CNH to its weakest since November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixed income markets initially saw a softer open during early Eurex trade amid an uptick in risk appetite after the aforementioned deal on migration at the EU summit.

This comes after gold hit a 6-month low in the previous session, and was set for its worst monthly performance in over 1 year. Shanghai steel is set for its best quarter in 5 as Chinese demand continues to grow, with the construction material up 2% on the day, and +15% in April-June. Zinc has parred the losses seen in early trade following planned output cuts of 10% by smelters, but is still set for its worst quarter since 2015.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Early European trade has been dictated by the firmer EUR seen in the wake of EU leaders reaching an agreement on migration at the EU summit. Optimism surrounding the deal has largely been spurred by relief regarding recent tensions within the CDU/CSU alliance in Germany. CSU&rsquo;s Michelbach has viewed the deal as a &lsquo;positive signal&rsquo; and thus markets are optimistic that this could pave the way for a mending of relations. Furthermore, the fact that Italy were able commit to the deal and avoid walking away has been met with positivity in the market; albeit Salvini has stressed the need for &lsquo;concrete commitments. In terms of price action, EUR/USD soared through the 1.1600 level during thin Asia-Pac trading hours to make a high print of 1.1666 but still some distance of the 1.1720 high seen earlier in the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sharp rise in the EUR has naturally pressured the DXY which has given up its 95.00 handle to trade lower by around 0.5%. Subsequently, the USD is softer against a bulk of its major counterparts with JPY the exception to the rule amid the broader risk environment spurred by events in Brussels. USD/JPY sits marginally higher for the session with the move to the upside running out of steam ahead of 110.80 with exporter offers from 110.80-90 capping gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP is also firmer vs. the USD (but softer vs. EUR) and has subsequently reclaimed a 1.3100 handle. Brexit-related rhetoric from overnight was unsurprisingly inconclusive and generic with PM May stating that she wants a deal on Brexit that will work for both UK and EU. Perhaps more interestingly, Business Insider sources suggest the EU will reject any Brexit deal that stipulates the UK remains with the goods single market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, broad USD softness has lent a helping hand to AUD with AUD/USD paring the softness seen in the wake of another PBoC devaluation which had earlier pressured CNH to its weakest since November.</p>\r\n",

There was little in the way of newsflow which may have helped the general picture as trade wars took a back seat and risk sentiment improved in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

However, it was not all doom and gloom for stocks as a late breakthrough at the EU summit later provided the region with a mild uplift. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) rallied amid outperformance in tech and plans to ease foreign investment restrictions which overshadowed the switch to a weekly net liquidity drain by the PBoC, although the 3 big telecom names were mixed after their spin-off JV China Tower received approval for a Hong Kong IPO which is set to be the largest globally since Alibaba. Finally, 10yr JGBs were slightly softer amid modest gains in Japanese stocks and after the BoJ cut its purchase amounts in the 5yr-10yr maturities, although the reaction to the Rinban was muted in comparison to previous similar reductions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Ambassador to China Branstad said the Trump administration is unconvinced China is willing to make enough progress on trade issues soon enough while he added there is scepticism regarding promises China has made and the US wants to see openings carried out.

Furthermore, the leaders agreed they must ensure effective control of external borders and prevent uncontrolled migration that was seen in 2015, while EU leaders also agreed to extend economic sanctions against Russia for another 6 months. Additionally, EU leaders also signalled intentions to respond to potential tariffs on cars, should trade tensions escalate. (Newswires) Note: EU leaders had initially failed to formally approve a final EU summit joint conclusions statement after Italy blocked all agreements until demands regarding migration were included in the final conclusions which had prompted the EU to cancel the press conference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said EU came to him to negotiate on trade. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets initially provided very little excitement as the DXY traded sideways above the 95.00 level and with its counterparts across the pond languishing near prior lows. However, the announcement that EU leaders reached an agreement on migration which had earlier been delayed by Italian demands, then lifted EUR/USD to reclaim the 1.1600 handle which its major peers were quick to latch on to at the detriment of the greenback. This saw GBP/USD reclaim the 1.3100 handle, while AUD/USD also pared the softness seen in the wake of another PBoC devaluation which had earlier pressured CNH to its weakest since November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities traded mixed with WTI crude futures paring some of its gains following its 2-week surge that saw prices briefly break above USD 74/bbl during the prior US session, although the overnight pullback was relatively mild and support was seen at the USD 73/bbl level. Elsewhere, gold was underpinned after the greenback weakened following the breakthrough at the EU summit, while copper also gained amid outperformance in its largest consumer China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CME raised crude oil NYMEX maintenance margins by 7.3% to USD 2950/contract for August and raises Brent futures maintenance margins by 4.4% to USD 2975/contract for July.

The 7y note auction went off without a hitch with the yield stopping on the screws and the line covered 2.53x, in line with the 6-auction average. IFR noted much of the activity was seen as quarter-end and month-end portfolio rebalancing with the geopolitical and trade news relatively quiet.

Bostic also commented the fed is worried about overheating and he is concerned about an unpleasant economic snapback. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bullard (Non-voter, Dove) said risk of inversion should result in the Fed to slow down rate hikes until it is obvious that inflation pressures or long-term yields are increasing, while he also commented that it does not look like there is much inflation risk today.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks struggle for direction and trade mixed as the region fails to sustain the positive momentum from Wall St, where all majors finished positive as trade concerns took a back seat for the time being. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) were initially lifted at the open but then pared the gains on month-, quarter- and half-year end rebalancing, while better than expected Industrial Production and a 25-year low Unemployment Rate in Japan failed to underpin the local benchmark. Conversely, it was not all gloomy for stocks with Sharp shares surging over 15% after the Co. reversed course on a planned share issuance and cancelled the sale due market instability on trade uncertainty. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) have been kept afloat by outperformance in tech and plans to ease foreign investment restrictions although gains are limited following a switch to a weekly net liquidity drain by the PBoC, while the 3 big telecom names are mixed after their spin-off JV China Tower received approval for a Hong Kong IPO which is set to be the largest globally since Alibaba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets initially provided very little excitement as the DXY traded sideways above the 95.00 level and its counterparts across the pond languishing near prior lows. However, the announcement of EU leaders reaching an agreement on migration which had earlier been delayed by Italian demands, then lifted EUR/USD to reclaim the 1.1600 handle which its major peers were quick to latch on to at the detriment of the greenback. This saw GBP/USD reclaim the 1.3100 handle, while AUD/USD also pared the softness seen in the wake of another PBoC devaluation which pressured CNH to its weakest since November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are slightly softer despite the risk averse tone in Japan, as the BoJ cut its purchase amounts in the 5yr-10yr maturities although the reaction to the Rinban was muted in comparison to previous similar reductions. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
