(The Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May refused to say whether she thinks the UK will be better or worse off in the event of a &#39;no-deal&#39; Brexit and stated the government is working to make a success of leaving the EU &quot;whatever the outcome of the negotiations&quot;. (Sky)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Coveney said chances of a no deal Brexit are very slim as no one would benefit and that it is possible to get a deal on Brexit well before the year-end, while Coveney added that talks of surviving a no deal Brexit is more of a negotiation tactic than a reality.

Furthermore, the minutes noted that Kansas City (George) and Cleveland (Mester) urged raising discount rate by 0.25% due to the continued solid economic growth outlook, tight labour markets and inflation remaining near 2%, but the remaining 10 wanted to maintain as they felt it was appropriate during the current economic conditions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said he expects a trade agreement with Canada can conclude this week and does not expect a lot of sticking points on the trade talks with Canada, while he repeated that US will focus on Mexico if talks with Canada fall through. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said the US is asking Canada to consider joining the US-Mexico trade deal but also noted that Canada has made troubles in drugs and biologics for US firms, while he also stated that the US is not accusing Mexico of currency manipulation as the MXN has been falling which impacts US trade deficit.

However, it forecast Q3 EPS lower than consensus and beneath the previous year&rsquo;s figures. Tiffany&rsquo;s (TIF) was slightly higher after earnings and revenue beats, as well firmer outlook for FY18.

Starbucks (SBUX) and Nestle (NESN SW) announced they have now closed the $7.15bln licensing deal which gives permission to Nestle to sell products from SBUX outside of their coffee shops, which will result in 500 employees from Starbucks moving to Nestle.

A strong Consumer Confidence reading also contributed to some weakness across the complex, pushing equities to a new record high. Amid decent volume, the yield curve steepened with most of the action concentrated in the belly and long end of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps. US 10-year T-notes settled 8 ticks lower at 120-30.</p>\r\n",

US Commerce Secretary Ross stressed Canada&rsquo;s necessity for a trade deal with the US, asking Canada to consider joining the US-Mexico trade deal. He also claimed the US is not accusing Mexico of currency manipulation as the MXN has been falling and is impacting the US trade deficit. Also, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin reiterated he sees a trade agreement with Canada coming this week, as he does not expect a lot of sticking points in the trade talks. He restated that if talks with Canada fall through, the US will focus on Mexico, mentioning this deal with Mexico has strong currency chapter. He also noted he does not expect auto prices to rise following the new agreement. On the Mexican front, Economy Minister Guajardo said there will be free trade on North American auto market and indicated the outstanding issues with Canada include dairy and government procurement. Elsewhere, Canada&#39;s PM Trudeau said his position on supply hasn&#39;t changed, but he looks forward to a NAFTA deal if it is good for Canada, adds there has been progress on auto&#39;s and Canada is studying the US-Mexico terms of the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHINA TRADE TALKS:</strong> On China, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin claimed tariffs are about US workers and US economy and clarified they are not trying to hurt China whilst he urged for better US access in Chinese markets. NEC director Kudlow said he believes China is on the defensive as the US is showing momentum in trade talks and finally Commerce Secretary Ross said Trump is interested to see how new duties impact China talks but reiterated there has been no breakthrough in the talks last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> An internal memo reported France has told diplomats to delay any non-essential trips to Iran due to a foiled bomb plot as well as a tougher attitude towards France from Tehran. Separately, Germany said to be looking at other options to aid Turkey, as opposed to financial help, in response to WSJ article stating they were to offer financial aid. This came amid suggestions from a German official that they could consider bilateral aid in the form of untied financial credits, adding &ldquo;[they] would do a lot to try to stabilize Turkey [they] don&rsquo;t have much choice.&quot; Saudi Energy Adviser says Iran is unable to completely, or partially, close the Straits of Hormuz or Bab Al-Mandab, following from US Secretary of State Pompeo&rsquo;s comments who noted Iran does not control the Stait of Hormuz. Defence Secretary Mattis also on the matter said Iran has been put on notice and they will be held accountable for mischief throughout the region. The Saudi Energy Minister also does not see current US sanctions stopping Iranian exports completely; as a reminder the energy related sanctions against Iran are to come into effect in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed&rsquo;s Kashkari (Dove, Non-Voter) said expansions do not last forever and the Fed is aiming at extending one; he added the effects of monetary policy operate with a lag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DISCOUNT RATE MINUTES: </strong>2 Regional banks supported a hike at the July meeting and the remaining 10 decided to leave rates unchanged. Kansas City (George) and Cleveland (Mester)&nbsp; urged raising the discount rate by 0.25% due to the continued solid economic growth outlook, tight labour markets, and with inflation remaining near 2%. However, the remaining 10 wanted to maintain the rate as they felt it was appropriate during the current economic conditions. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>&nbsp;An article published in PoliticsHome reported the UK Government might not spell out risks of no-deal Brexit before crunch Commons vote, Downing Street has refused to confirm whether MPs will be told the full consequences of a no-deal Brexit before they get the chance to vote for one in Parliament. In later trade, it was reported UK PM May refused to say whether she thinks the UK will be better or worse off in the event of a &#39;no-deal&#39; Brexit telling Sky News the government is working to make a success of leaving the EU &quot;whatever the outcome of the negotiations&rdquo;. Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Coveney said the chances of a no deal Brexit are very slim as no one would benefit and it is possible to get a deal on Brexit well before the year end. He then went on to note talks of surviving a no deal Brexit is more of a negotiation tactic than a reality. US Treasury Sec. Mnuchin said the US is very much ready to do a trade deal with the UK and French President Macron said the EU is working to avoid a domino effect following Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Praet (Dovish) reiterated patient, prudent and persistent monetary policy is still needed, and the risk channel of policy has to be closely monitored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.03% at 2897, NDX +0.15% at 7570, DJI +0.60% at 26065. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.45%, Materials -0.34%, Industrials -0.12%, Cons Discretionary +0.18%, Cons Staples -0.32%, Healthcare +0.1%, Financials -0.1%, Tech +0.2%, Telecoms -0.47%, Utilities -0.21%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS</strong>: Best Buy (BBY) was lower after its earnings report, which saw beats on the top and bottom lines, and raised its FY19 guidance. However, it forecast Q3 EPS lower than consensus and beneath the previous year&rsquo;s figures. Tiffany&rsquo;s (TIF) was slightly higher after earnings and revenue beats, as well firmer outlook for FY18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> AMD (AMD) promoted Saeid Moshkelani to senior vice president and general manager, as Jim Anderson left to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC). Coty (COTY) soared after an upgrade to overweight from equal weight at Morgan Stanley. Qualcomm (QCOM) announced the preliminary results of its tender offer which said it sold 76mln shares at or below USD 67.50 in cash. US President Trump says Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) &amp; Alphabet (GOOGL) had better be careful, and US tech giants are treading on troubled territory. This follows from pre-market tweeting from Trump stating Google&rsquo;s (GOOGL) search engine is &ldquo;rigged&rdquo; and that it will be &ldquo;addressed&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A:</strong> Starbucks (SBUX) and Nestle (NESN SW) announced they have now closed the $7.15bln licensing deal which gives permission to Nestle to sell products from SBUX outside of their coffee shops, which will result in 500 employees from Starbucks moving to Nestle</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES 34 CENTS LOWER AT $68.53/BBL; BRENT (V8) SETTLES&nbsp; 26 CENTS LOWER AT $75.95/BBL.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil futures held in positive territory for most of the morning session supported by positive risk sentiment which attracted investors into the energy complex and kept equities higher in early trade. However, WTI gave up its gains heading into negative territory following &nbsp;strong US Consumer Confidence data which contributed to a USD rebound. Further, looming Iranian supply shortages continue to upward pressures even after reassuring comments from Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s energy minister who downplayed the impact of US sanctions stating they are unlikely to stop Iranian exports completely. Citi also sees &lsquo;the apparent drop in Iranian export shipments for August as supportive&rsquo; though they note seasonal variability may be exaggerating the effect of looming US sanctions. Iraq Prime Minister also said to be optimistic of continued rise in oil prices. In later trade, it was reported the Mexico&#39;s incoming government is mulling an &#39;indefinite&#39; suspension of competitive auctions for oil and gas producers and pemex venture partners and is to consider withdrawing IEA and forge closer ties with OPEC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tonight&rsquo;s API data Crude is expected to show a drawdown of 700k barrels, Cushing expecting a draw of 42k barrels (according to Genscape), distillates expecting a build of 1.6mln barrels and gasoline expected to report a build of 400k barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10-YEAR T-NOTES SETTLED 8 TICKS LOWER AT 120-30:</strong> The treasury complex drifted lower on Tuesday, after trading within a tight range overnight, as US and Mexico were optimistic about a trade agreement coming soon with Canada. A strong Consumer Confidence reading also contributed to some weakness across the complex, pushing equities to a new record high. Amid decent volume, the yield curve steepened with most of the action &nbsp;concentrated in the belly and long end of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US sold $37bln in 5yr notes today with not much fireworks, the auction stopped through by 0.1bps at 2.745%. The bid to cover came in at 2.39x beneath the average of 2.52 where it showed the lowest BC since April. Dealers took just shy of 25%, better than the average of 28%,&nbsp; Directs took 9% and Indirects took 66%, higher than the average of 61.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> Lost grip of previous August lows amidst widespread Greenback weakness and retreats vs EMs, with the index through 94.500 and down near 94.425 before regaining some composure after a jump in US consumer confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, CHF:</strong> A real tussle to end Tuesday&rsquo;s EU session ahead of the G10 pack, with the Loonie making a late charge on the back of latest US-Canada trade comments via Mnuchin who claims that a deal, aka Mexico, may be struck this week and he does not foresee many contentious issues to be resolved. USDCAD moved down through 1.2900, though reclaimed that level on more trade-related comments &nbsp;from Ross and Guajardo. &nbsp;The Franc that continues to test the same key tech support circa 0.9750 on more short covering and positional adjustment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;* EUR, NZD: </strong>The next best majors and grinding out gains vs the USD for much of the day, with the single currency up through 1.1700 for the majority of the session before it fell back beneath the level amid the USD rebound. Kiwi extended its rebound from recent lows a bit further above 0.6700 on a broad improvement in risk sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, AUD, JPY: </strong>A bit more reluctant to join the overall trend with Cable unable to really build on 1.2900+ levels and the Pound slipping to fresh multi-month lows vs the Eur (around 0.9080) on heightened risk of a hard or no deal Brexit. Meanwhile, political instability and the US-China trade impasse continue to hamper the AUD around 0.7350, while USDJPY &nbsp;remained anchored to 111.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM:</strong> TRY and ZAR among the big movers yet again, and both very volatile, with the Lira retesting lows vs the USD in the 6.2000+ area, then paring declines briefly on reports that Germany may be mulling financial assistance for Turkey, before re-weakening on later headlines suggesting that the aid being considered is not in cash form. Similarly, the Rand got a boost on the news that SA&rsquo;s expropriation bill proposed by the ANC has been withdrawn, but fell back when details revealed that the constitutional change is still on the agenda for review. USDZAR down through 14.0000 at one stage vs 14.2425 at the high, and now circa 14.2000.</p>\r\n",

The average tail was 0bp, compared with +0.5bp during the same period in 2017.&rdquo; In terms of breakdown, last month, domestic investors took 65% of the issue (highest in a decade). &ldquo;Rarely has domestic participation breached the 60% threshold, underscoring continued interest from this investor category,&rdquo; Barclays wrote. However, on the other side of the coin, foreign participation continues to decline, dropping to 8% in July vs levels just under 20% at the start of the year.</p>\r\n",

Usd/Cad down through 1.2900 and eyeing the 200 DMA next (around 1.2842) to rival the Franc that continues to test the same key tech support circa 0.9750 on more short covering and positional adjustment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lost grip of previous August lows amidst widespread Greenback weakness and retreats vs EMs, with the index through 94.500 and down near 94.425 before regaining some composure after a jump in US consumer confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best majors and grinding out gains vs the Usd for much of the day, with the single currency up through 1.1700 and Kiwi extending its rebound from recent lows a bit further above 0.6700 on a broad improvement in risk sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/AUD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bit more reluctant to join the overall trend with Cable unable to really build on 1.2900+ levels and the Pound slipping to fresh multi-month lows vs the Eur (around 0.9080) on heightened risk of a hard or no deal Brexit. Meanwhile, political instability and the US-China trade impasse continue to hamper the Aud around 0.7350, while Usd/Jpy remained anchored to 111.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try and Zar among the big movers yet again, and both very volatile, with the Lira retesting lows vs the Usd in the 6.2000+ area, then paring declines briefly on reports that Germany may be mulling financial assistance for Turkey, before re-weakening on later headlines suggesting that the aid being considered is not in cash form. Similarly, the Rand got a boost on the news that SA&rsquo;s expropriation bill proposed by the ANC has been withdrawn, but fell back when details revealed that the constitutional change is still on the agenda for review. Usd/Zar down through 14.0000 at one stage vs 14.2425 at the high, and now circa 14.1500.</p>\r\n",

Hence, the index has been drifting down further below 95.000 within a new 94.920-595 range, with nearest supports seen at early August lows (circa 94.491), assuming 94.500 does not hold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF - The Franc is benefiting most from the weaker Greenback and trading close to 0.9750, though not really outperforming in cross terms as Eur/Chf holds firmly above 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/NZD - All mildly firmer vs the Usd, with the single currency extending yesterday&rsquo;s post-Ifo recovery gains to around 1.1700 and not really hindered by considerably weaker than forecast Eurozone headline M3 data, while the Loonie has breached 1.2950 through heavy offers layered down to 1.2940 and the Kiwi is back probing 0.6700. Back to the Cad, renewed NAFTA or updated US-Mexican style trade agreement hopes continue to prop the currency and on that note a phone call between President Trump and Canadian PM Trudeau is said to have been constructive, according to the latter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Mixed fortunes for the Pound as Cable revisits 1.2900 by virtue of the aforementioned broad Usd downturn, but Eur/Gbp climbs towards 0.9075 on heightened prospects of a no deal Brexit. Note: reports about Governor Carney being approached to extend his term until 2020 from 2019 sparked some limited Gbp weakness but not sustained and UK Treasury has declined to comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY - Narrowly mixed vs the Usd around 0.7350 and 111.00 respectively, with the Aud undermined by the ongoing US-China import tariff stand-off, but Jpy gleaning some support due to its safe-haven status, the Dollar&rsquo;s demise and key chart levels/supply (unlike Eur/Jpy that touched 130.00 earlier amidst macro, leverage and fast money buying).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - The G10 laggard, and largely due to significantly weaker than expected Swedish retail sales data, with Eur/Sek up to 10.6675 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have bounced relatively firmly from worst levels to trade up at a fresh Eurex peak of 162.87 (+23 ticks) on a combination of receding EU cash bourses, more downside in Italian debt pre-CTZ auction (mixed to respectable in the event) and renewed underlying demand due to broader risk-off themes (ie global trade, diplomatic and political factors). Elsewhere, Gilts continue to lag on catch-up dynamics, but have pared losses to just 11 ticks at 123.22 vs 37 ticks at worst reflecting its safe-haven properties as a core bond. However, US Treasuries remain largely side-lined and flat ahead of more supply and a pretty busy data line-up including the first take of July trade that obviously takes on extra importance given all the tariff impositions and threats of more to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are benefitting from the slight pullback of the dollar with Brent futures marginally higher while WTI futures test the USD 69/bbl level to the upside. Saudi Energy Adviser stated the current US sanctions are unlikely to completely stop Iranian exports, ahead of oil-related sanctions are to come into effect in November. News flow has been relatively light, traders will be keeping an eye on the API crude inventories released after-market today; the Street expects crude stocks to draw by 500k bbls in the week, distillates are seen building by 1.4mln, and gasoline is expected to build by 400k bbls; according to a Reuters poll. Traders are also citing reports on Monday that showed OPEC+ compliance fell, though output still remains below target.&nbsp; Elsewhere, gold has gained a firmer footing above USD 1200/oz, attributed to the ongoing dollar weaker.</p>\r\n",

In terms of sectors, material names outperform on the back of firmer base metal prices while telecom names underperform. For stock specifics, Faurecia (+4.4%) climbed to the top if the Stoxx 600 following an upgrade at Kepler Cheuvreux while Sybank (-9.8%) and Baloise (-3.4%) share fell amid disappointing earnings</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Dollar has lost more ground vs most G10/major rivals, but remains mixed vs EMs, as the Try continues to weaken in contrast to the Cny (and Cnh in response) that saw the strongest fixing in more than a year overnight. Hence, the index has been drifting down further below 95.000 within a new 94.920-665 range, with nearest supports seen at early August lows (circa&nbsp; 94.610 and 94.491).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF - The Franc is benefiting most from the weaker Greenback and trading above 0.9800, though not really outperforming in cross terms as Eur/Chf holds firmly above 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/NZD - All mildly firmer vs the Usd, with the single currency extending yesterday&rsquo;s post-Ifo recovery gains towards 1.1700 and not really hindered by considerably weaker than forecast Eurozone headline M3 data, while the Loonie is seriously testing heavy offers reportedly at 1.2950 and the Kiwi is back probing 0.6700. Back to the Cad, renewed NAFTA or updated US-Mexican style trade agreement hopes continue to prop the currency and on that note a phone call between President Trump and Canadian PM Trudeau is said to have been constructive, according to the latter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Mixed fortunes for the Pound as Cable revisits 1.2900 by virtue of the aforementioned broad Usd downturn, but Eur/Gbp climbs towards 0.9075 on heightened prospects of a no deal Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY - Narrowly mixed vs the Usd around 0.7350 and 111.00 respectively, with the Aud undermined by the ongoing US-China import tariff stand-off, but Jpy gleaning some support due to its safe-haven status, the Dollar&rsquo;s demise and key chart levels/supply (unlike Eur/Jpy that touched 130.00 earlier amidst macro, leverage and fast money buying).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - The G10 laggard, and largely due to significantly weaker than expected Swedish retail sales data, with Eur/Sek up to 10.6600 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have bounced relatively firmly from worst levels to trade up at a fresh Eurex peak of 162.87 (+23 ticks) on a combination of receding EU cash bourses, more downside in Italian debt pre-CTZ auction (mixed to respectable in the event) and renewed underlying demand due to broader risk-off themes (ie global trade, diplomatic and political factors). Elsewhere, Gilts continue to lag on catch-up dynamics, but have pared losses to just 11 ticks at 123.22 vs 37 ticks at worst reflecting its safe-haven properties as a core bond. However, US Treasuries remain largely side-lined and flat ahead of more supply and a pretty busy data line-up including the first take of July trade that obviously takes on extra importance given all the tariff impositions and threats of more to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are benefitting from the slight pullback of the dollar with Brent futures marginally higher while WTI futures test the USD 69/bbl level to the upside. Saudi Energy Adviser stated the current US sanctions are unlikely to completely stop Iranian exports, ahead of oil-related sanctions are to come into effect in November. News flow has be relatively light, traders will be keeping an eye on the API crude inventories released after-market today; the Street expects crude stocks to draw by 500k bbls in the week, distillates are seen building by 1.4mln, and gasoline is expected to build by 400k bbls; according to a Reuters poll. Traders are also citing reports on Monday that showed OPEC+ compliance fell, though output still remains below target.&nbsp; Elsewhere, gold has gained a firmer footing above USD 1200/oz, attributed to the ongoing dollar weaker.</p>\r\n",

This lifted the ASX 200 (+0.7%) back above the 6300 level with gains led by outperformance in financials, while Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) was underpinned by a weaker currency but with upside capped by resistance around 23000. Shanghai Comp. (Unch) and Hang Seng (+0.3%) both initially conformed to the positive tone although the mainland then failed to sustain gains amid ongoing US-China trade uncertainty and as focus shifts to earnings with 3 of China&rsquo;s big 4 banks to announce results today. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded subdued with demand sapped as focus centred on riskier assets and following weaker demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for longer dated JGBs.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as the region gets a tail wind from US where the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq extended on record highs with sentiment supported after US and Mexico reached a trade agreement. This lifted the ASX 200 (+0.7%) back above the 6300 level with gains led by outperformance in financials, while Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) is underpinned by a weaker currency but with further upside capped by resistance around 23000. Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (+0.3%) initially conformed to the positive tone but the mainland then failed to sustain gains amid ongoing US-China trade uncertainty and as focus shifts to earnings with 3 of China&rsquo;s big 4 banks to announce results today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remains subdued and sits below the 95.00 level following a 2-day selldown, although resistance in EUR/USD and GBP/USD at 1.1700 and 1.2900 respectively has provided the greenback some mild reprieve overnight. Elsewhere, JPY is predominantly weaker on the heightened risk appetite with USD/JPY edging a firmer footing on the 111.00 handle, while antipodeans have marginally pulled back as CNY gives back some of its gains despite the PBoC strengthening the fix by the most in over a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand sapped as focus centres on riskier assets and ahead of an enhanced liquidity auction for longer dated bonds.</p>\r\n",
