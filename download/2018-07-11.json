It is worth pointing out that ranges were, in fact, hardly indicative of a crisis, with the ES patrolling the familiar 2770-2787.5 territory in Wednesday trade. There was a slip in afternoon trade, likely as the crude oil slide intensified, seeing stocks move in sympathy and Treasuries catch a bid. But looking at daily charts, the moves in the ES have been benign; although Tuesday&rsquo;s low was taken out, the low from Monday&rsquo;s session around 2760 hasn&rsquo;t been tested, which has left some technicians optimistic. SPX -0.7% at 2774.35, NDX -0.53% at 7243.98, DJI -0.86% at 24705.99.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The treasury complex drifted higher modestly on Wednesday as trade tensions between US and China intensified, with the latter working on alternatives to tariffs retaliation measures to the recently announced US tariffs. In late afternoon trade, Treasuries caught a bid as oil and equities slid. The yield curve further flattened on Wednesday, with yields lower by c.3bps across the curve, with the exception of the 2yr yield which was lower by c.2bps. 2s30s and 2s10s narrowed by c.2bps (the latter fell below 27bps), 2s5s narrowed by c.1bps. US 10YR T-notes futures (u8) settled 7+ ticks higher at 120-08.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities down, Treasuries up, crude down, dollar up<br />* REAR-VIEW: Libya to raise output as NOC regains control of ports; China suggests talks to de-escalate trade conflict; BOC hikes; sources say ECB split over &lsquo;through summer&rsquo; guidance.<br />* COMING-UP: ECB minutes, Riksbank minutes; US CPI.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>There was mixed news flow regarding trade on Wednesday. After the US on Tuesday announced it would levy 10% tariffs on an additional $200bln of Chinese imports, Chinese policymakers initially responded suggesting it will mull countermeasures. However, in European trade, a Chinese commerce official called for talks to de-escalate trade conflict with US, adding that China will be forced to defend interests in a trade war; the news initially calmed markets as it appeared Chinese was taking a more constructive approach, rather than reciprocal trade measures. However, the WSJ followed with a report which suggested China cannot match Washington&rsquo;s new tariffs as it has in previous rounds, so it is reviewing plans to hit back in other ways; the touted measures included holding up licenses for US companies doing business in China, delaying approval of mergers and acquisitions involving US companies, as well as ramping up inspections of American products at borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>The BOC fired its fourth rate rise of the cycle, lifting rates by 25bps to 1.50%, as expected. Ahead of the decision, some were expecting a dovish hike, since the Bank said it would include the impact of the recently announced steel and aluminium tariffs. The tone was cautious, and the BOC reiterated it would be data dependent in setting policy (specifically wages, it said and capacity), but the BOC said again that higher rates will be warranted to keep inflation near target and it will continue to gradually normalise policy. Its latest forecast saw near-term growth cut by 0.1ppts to 2.0%, though nudged up its view for 2019 by 0.2ppts to 2.2%; inflation forecasts for 2018 were raised slightly (+0.1% to 2.5%), and 2019 CPI view was maintained at 2.1%. In his post-meeting press conference, Governor Poloz said the risk of a bigger shock to the economy could be seen of more tariffs were announced (noting that the autos sector was vulnerable), but said he cannot base policy on hypotheticals; the press conference was more dovish than the rate decision and statement, and amid broader dollar strength, the CAD gave back gains carved out in wake of the rate decision to trade flat after the press conference. Markets are pricing another hike in Q4 with 80% probability after the rate decision/press conference, according to RBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Sources reported that the ECB is split with regards to its guidance that rates will remain on hold at least &ldquo;through the summer&rdquo; of 2019, with some policy makers saying a rate hike is possible as early as July 2019, and others arguing that rates will not me lifted until the autumn, with the October meeting being touted as the earliest opportunity for a move, according to some sources. ECB&rsquo;s Draghi avoided comments on monetary policy in his speeches today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Evans (non-voter) said he is now comfortable with one or two more rate hikes this year; citing recent tax cuts, spending increases and more-stable price pressures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>US PPI showed pipeline price pressures modestly firming in the US economy. Final Demand m/m came in at 0.3% against consensus of 0.2% and the y/y headline at 3.4% versus expectations for 3.2%. In particular, transportation costs have been rising steadily since the start of Q2 with Barclays suggesting a number of surveys cited truckers shortages and new regulations as possible explanations. The less volatile Core measures ex also rose with the m/m ex Food/Energy and ex Food/Energy/Trade figure both rising by 0.3%. Barclays notes the annual pace of both CPI and PPI is strong and indicates the economy continues to outperform &lsquo;its growth potential&rsquo; which mean &lsquo;inflation pressures could firm further in the months to come&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.7% at 2774.35, NDX -0.53% at 7243.98, DJI -0.86% at 24705.99. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -0.33%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.34%, Energy: -2.16%, Financials: -0.52%, Health Care: -0.78%, Industrials: -1.61%, Materials: -1.69%, Telecoms: -1.05%, Tech: -0.51%, Utilities: +0.88%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>After gapping lower at the reopen, the ES managed to pare back some of those losses in the Asia session/European morning, and closed the gap on news that China floated the idea of talks to de-escalate trade tensions. It is worth pointing out that ranges were, in fact, hardly indicative of a crisis, with the ES patrolling the familiar 2770-2787.5 territory in Wednesday trade. There was a slip in afternoon trade, likely as the crude oil slide intensified, seeing stocks move in sympathy and Treasuries catch a bid. But looking at daily charts, the moves in the ES have been benign; although Tuesday&rsquo;s low was taken out, the low from Monday&rsquo;s session around 2760 hasn&rsquo;t been tested, which has left some technicians optimistic. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Fastenal (FAST) was the top performer in the SPX, posting 10%+ gains after earnings beat on both top- and bottom-lines. First Energy (FE) was lifted after entering into an agreement with Stalking Horse to sell its loan-serving division. China exposed names were hit amid trade tensions, with the likes of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM), Acacia (ACIA), Lumentum (LITE) suffering on the news that China is looking to delay the approval process of mergers as a retaliatory response to the recent US tariffs, but in afternoon trade pared back some of the losses on news that the US has signed an Escrow agreement with China&#39;s ZTE, which paves the way for the ban to be lifted on the company. American Airlines (AAL) underperformed after cutting their Q2 TRASM and CASM forecasts, and drifted lower with other airline names ahead of Delta (DAL) earnings report tomorrow. In broker moves, Barclays upgraded TripAdvisor (TRIP) and downgraded Hess Corp (HES). In M&amp;A news, Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) increased its bid for Sky (SKY LN) to GBP 14.00/shr (around GBP 32.5bln); CNBC later reported that Comcast (CMCSA) is expected to counter Fox&rsquo;s bid for Sky (SKY LN) as early as this week, though the offer will likely be lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLES 7+ TICKS HIGHER AT 120-08.</strong> The treasury complex drifted higher modestly on Wednesday as trade tensions between US and China intensified, with the latter working on alternatives to tariffs retaliation measures to the recently announced US tariffs. In late afternoon trade, Treasuries caught a bid as oil and equities slid. The yield curve further flattened on Wednesday, with yields lower by c.3bps across the curve, with the exception of the 2yr yield which was lower by c.2bps. 2s30s and 2s10s narrowed by c.2bps (the latter fell below 27bps), 2s5s narrowed by c.1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 10-YEAR AUCTION REVIEW: </strong>Wednesday&#39;s auction of 10s was a lot better than Tuesday&#39;s auction of 3s; the 10s auction saw a stop-through of 0.3bps, with cover coming in slightly above recent averages. Dealer takedown was lower than recent averages, leaving directs with the smallest takedown since January, and the indirect takedown the highest since March. Treasury yields edged&nbsp; lower on the back of the auction results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 30-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>The Treasury will this week auction USD 69bln in new supply (USD 33bln of 3-year notes on Tuesday, USD 22bln 10-year reopening on Wednesday, USD 14bln of reopened 30-year bonds on Thursday). USD 28.7bln in new cash will be raised, given the USD 40.3bln maturing mid-month, according to TD Securities. Recent auctions in the 30-year sector have been well-received, with the last four auctions all stopping-through (only three of the last 12 30-year auctions has seen a tail, suggesting that demand remains firm for long-dated debt). Analysts at SocGen suggest that the decent performance in the long-end can be attributed to corporations rushing to increase their pension plan contributions before the September deadline, to take advantage of higher tax deductions. However, there are some negatives: benchmark 30-year yields are beneath the stop-out rate of the last five auctions, which SocGen says will likely warrant some concession heading into Thursday&rsquo;s sale. Additionally, the bank argues that the sector remains rich on the curve, with 5s30s near the lowest levels in over a decade. On the flip side, current 30s are cheap on the spline versus the older 30s relative to the previous two auction <strong>cycles.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Q8) SETTLES $3.73 LOWER AT $70.38/BBL; BRENT (U8) SETTLES $5.46 LOWER AT $73.40/BBL. </strong>Crude traded with an offered tone on Wednesday on news from Libya, where the official Tripoli based NOC was handed back control of four oil export terminals by the rival (unofficial) NOC, which will see production normalise, with some suggesting may see between 300k BPD and 400k BPD return to the market within days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>OPEC MOMR: </strong>OPEC&rsquo;s monthly oil market report saw the cartel&rsquo;s crude production rose 173k bpd in June to average 32.33mln bpd, according to secondary sources. OPEC said oil output increased mostly in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Nigeria, Kuwait and UAE, while production showed declines in Libya, Venezuela and Angola. 2018 global oil demand growth forecast was unchanged (increase by around 1.65mln bpd to average 98.85mln bpd), and in 2019, initial projections indicate a global increase of around 1.45mln bpd, with annual average global consumption anticipated to surpass the 100mln bpd threshold. Non-OPEC oil supply (now excluding the Republic of the Congo) in 2018 was revised up from the previous MOMR by 140k bpd to average 59.54mln bpd; an increase of 2mln BPD YY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE INVENTORIES: </strong>The EIA reported a bigger than expected decline in crude stock piles, with headline crude stocks drawing by 12.6mln barrels, the largest since September 2016; Cushing stocks drew down by 2.1mln. Products, meanwhile were mixed, with distillates posting a larger than expected build (+4.1mln vs exp +1.2mln) and gasoline drew down by 694k, slightly short of the 750k draw expected. Weekly crude production remained unchanged again at 10.9mln BPD, imports declined by 1.6mln barrels, and exports declined by 309k BPD. The market reaction to the inventory report, which saw oil prices spike higher, proved to be short-lived, with prices suffering from USD strength, as well as the market&rsquo;s focus on the anticipated rebound in Libyan supply, and OPEC&rsquo;s latest monthly report, which sees some weakening demand in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>After overnight news that the US is escalating trade wars, the buck (which tends to strengthen as trade sentiment sours) traded with a bid tone. The move was somewhat pared back as we approached the US cash open, with headlines suggesting China was seeking talks to attempt a de-escalation, which saw strength in havens deflate. Nevertheless, the DXY itself remained positive, printing HOD above 94.77. There was an extension of dollar strength in afternoon trade, perhaps aided by the slide in commodities and equities. EMFX was a victim of the dollar strength, with the complex oscillating based on risk sentiment, but ultimately yielded to the mighty Greenback, giving back some of the sharp gains seen this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie was a victim of whipsaw trade, sharply strengthening after the BOC raised rates, accompanying the hike with an upbeat assessment of the Canadian economic outlook, even allowing for negative effects of the trade spat with the US. Hence, further rate rises are appropriate, albeit at a gradual pace and according to unfolding data. The initial gains, which saw USDCAD fall to as low as 1.3060 was pared back as the US dollar caught another bid amid trade tensions, seeing USDCAD settle around 1.31 (flat) post the press conference with BOC governor Poloz and Dep Governor Wilkins., though in the afternoon, USDCAD crossed 1.32 as the USD caught a bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>The Aussie was one of the stand-out victims of the escalation in US/China trade tensions, falling to 0.7385 by the middle of the European morning, before reports signalled that China was seeking talks to de-escalate tensions with the US, lending to a bounce, before finding resistance at 0.7415, after which it resumed lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRY: T</strong>he Lira fell sharply against the USD after President Erdogan said interest rates will go down in the upcoming period, though said he still sees the dollar depreciating against the Lira. The contradictory remarks confirm investor&rsquo;s fears that Erdogan will more actively intervene in monetary policy, and follows news earlier in the week that the President now has the power to appoint central bank governors, and assembling a cabinet that did not include the market friendly Mehmet Simsek, instead naming his son-in-law as finance chief. In recent sessions, bank desks have warned that Turkey could be facing an imminent currency crisis. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP &ndash;</strong> ECB MINUTES: ECB June Minutes will be released Thursday 12th July at 1230BST/0630CDT. At its June meeting, the Bank opted to reduce monthly sovereign bond purchases to EUR 15bln/month, through the end of 2018 (current EUR 30bln/month programme ends in September 2018). Furthermore, the ECB stated that interest rates will remain at present levels through the summer of 2019, and in any case, for as long as necessary. In terms of economic forecasts, notable highlights from the staff projections saw 2018 GDP lowered from 2.4% to 2.1% with 2018 and 2019 HICP both raised to 1.7% from 1.4%. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19583/download\">Click here to read full preview.</a></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The Treasury will this week auction USD 69bln in new supply (USD 33bln of 3-year notes on Tuesday, USD 22bln 10-year reopening on Wednesday, USD 14bln of reopened 30-year bonds on Thursday). USD 28.7bln in new cash will be raised, given the USD 40.3bln maturing mid-month, according to TD Securities. Last month&rsquo;s 10s auction saw the highest cover since January, though the stop-out rate was the lowest since April. Dealer positioning suggests that dealers are net long to the tune of USD 3.82bln in the 7-11 year sector, also the lowest since April. Analysts at Societe Generale say the current 10s appear slightly cheap on the curve versus old 10s relative to the previous two auction cycles, and continues to trade near the cheapest level in years versus the 5s and 30s, though it has richened from May. SocGen notes, however, that 2s10s continues to flatten, and at 29bps, the spread is close to decade lows. Nevertheless, SocGen says the cheapness of the sector from a relative value perspective is a positive, but believes some concession may be required given benchmark 10-year yields are below the last two stop-out rates.</p>\r\n",

Hence, further rate rises are appropriate, albeit at a gradual pace and according to unfolding data. Usd/Cad down to 1.3080 vs 1.3175 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some respite for the worst G10 performers amidst heightened US vs China trade tensions as a Chinese official countered earlier more retaliatory statements with the offer to engage in dialogue in response to the additional $200 bn import tariffs drawn up by Washington. Aud/Usd rebounded towards 0.7400 having held just above a fib level around 0.7375 when risk-off flows were flowing faster, but was capped after later reports (WSJ) suggesting that Beijing is considering alternative measures to strike back at the US. Similarly, the Kiwi recouped some losses vs the Usd through 0.6800, but remains fragile alongside other commodity and high beta currencies as the YUAN continues to weaken on official and speculative grounds, with devaluation still amongst the obvious weapons available to China. Note, Usd/Cnh briefly tested technical resistance circa 6.7000 after another higher Usd/Cny mid-point from the PBoC and close to levels that recently &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More divisions within the ECB on rate guidance, per sources, helped the single currency regain 1.1700+ status vs the Dollar and a firmer footing vs a relatively side-lined GBP (cross back above 0.8850). The latest reports noted a split amongst rate setters on the specific timing of a likely first hike implied by &lsquo;through Summer 2019&rsquo; between Autumn or July next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both weaker vs the broadly firm Greenback (DXY keeping its head above 94.000), but rangebound between 0.9900-50 and either side of 111.00 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More volatile trade for the Lira, but ultimately another slide on a widening Turkish current account gap that merely compounded fiscal and overall economic jitters. Usd/Try up around 4.8000 before a small fade after comments from President Erdogan aimed at curbing investor angst.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, the new list was said to include electric vehicle batteries, leather products, air conditioners, fridges, furniture, tv components and several metals. (Newswires</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Assistant Commerce Minister said US is escalating trade tensions and that tariffs are a disruption to globalization and international order. The official stated that it is vital to send a positive signal of cooperation and stated &lsquo;if they go low, we go high&rsquo; concerning trade. However, Mofcom later commented it strongly opposes US action and reiterated China will take countermeasures, while there were also later comments from China that the US putting out a list is unacceptable, and it will be forced to strike back. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian stocks slumped across the board with sentiment spooked on increased trade concerns after the US announced a new tariff list on an additional USD 200bln worth of Chinese goods. The renewed US trade offensive picks up from Trump&rsquo;s threats made last month and in turn weighed heavily on US equity futures as well as Asia-Pac bourses, while some commodities in Shanghai went into free fall alongside the broad risk-averse tone. ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.2%) were lower with commodity-related sectors in Australia suffering after declines in the complex in which Shanghai Zinc fell 6% to hit limit down and copper fell to its lowest in about a year, while losses in Tokyo were exacerbated by safe haven flows into the JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.8%) took the brunt of the increased trade tensions, although both were off the day&rsquo;s lows after an initial composed response from China which stated it was vital to send a positive signal of cooperation and suggested that if the US will go low, it will go high. Finally, T-note futures traded higher overnight with prices spurred by the tariff list announcement, while 10yr JGBs were flat after they failed to benefit from the broad risk-averse tone, as well as the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 960bln in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 40bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.6234 (Prev. 6.6259)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Conservative Party rebels are said to weigh voting against PM May&#39;s Brexit deal which reports suggest could bring down PM May&#39;s government later this year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Villeroy reiterated the ECB&#39;s forward guidance by saying that QE should end in December, and the first rate hike may take place at the earliest &quot;through the summer &quot; of 2019 depending on the inflation outlook. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Evans states he is now comfortable with one or two more rate hikes this year; citing recent tax cuts, spending increases and more-stable price pressures. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities (Euro Stoxx 50 -1.1%) are following in step with Asian stocks and falling sharply on the back of trade concerns as the US begun the process of imposing new 10% tariffs on a further USD 200bln of Chinese imports. This new list was said to include several metals and as such material names are underperforming alongside energy names (on softer oil prices), but losses are broad based and being seen across all sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>21st Century Fox have increased their bid for Sky (-0.6%) to GBP 14.00/share, an independent committee from Sky has said they have reached an agreement on this increased recommended pre-conditional cash offer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts both recorded new session peaks earlier, albeit very marginal in the case of the latter, at 162.80 and 123.16 respectively (+42 and +24 ticks), before waning amidst a recovery of sorts in EU stock markets (or a degree of stability to be precise). Core debt futures may also have lost momentum due to issuance ahead of Germany&rsquo;s new 10 year cash bond and during book building for the UK linker syndication (2041 maturity). In the event, the German auction was relatively well received and orders for the UK I/L swelled to more than GBP 20bln, with GBP 3.25bln sold at the tight end of price indications. Similarly, US Treasuries are off best levels, though still firm awaiting Wall Street&rsquo;s reaction to latest US-China trade war manoeuvres that started after the closing bell on Tuesday and in advance of a busy agenda that includes PPI data and 10 year note supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - Extending recent losses vs its US counterpart and underperformance within the G10 bloc, with a further retreat from near 0.7500 peaks to breach support just ahead of the big figure below (0.7401 was the 10 DMA and support from there not seen until the 61.8% fib around 0.7377). The Aud continues to track US-China import tariff developments as a barometer for wider global trade contagion and repercussions given closest links and relations with China, while its NZD antipodean peer is less sensitive and has held up better as a result &ndash; cross back below 1.0900 but Kiwi losing 0.6800 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNH/CNY - Taking a direct hit from threats to raise the bar on imports to $250 bn in total by Beijing in response to a further $200 bn Chinese goods and services listed by the White House, but also weaker via the latest PBoC Cny fix amidst ongoing speculation that depreciation could be deployed as another trade war weapon. Usd/Cny closed around 6.6667, with resistance for Usd/Cnh just above 6.7000 subsequently tested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - Still rangy between 1.3110-75 vs its US rival and largely immune to fluctuating oil prices as attention turns to an almost completely priced in 25 bp hike from the BoC later today. Indeed, break-evens via options over the event are relatively low around +/- 80 pips, but the accompanying statement and post-policy meeting press conference by Poloz and Wilkins to present the latest MPR all provide plenty of potential to surprise with the emphasis on forward guidance and whether it&rsquo;s a dovish, hawkish or neutral hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP/JPY/CHF - All very narrowly mixed vs the Dollar, with perhaps a mild preference for the safer-havens, as the single currency meanders between 1.1695-1750, Cable flits from 1.3235-85, Jpy straddles 111.00 and Franc trades within a 0.9905-50 band, eyeing further global protectionism moves, Brexit and any other drivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM/SCANDI - Weaker across the board on general risk-off position and more independent bearish factors as the Lira lurches again on more fall-out from President Erdogan&rsquo;s cabinet appointments and Usd/Try rallies to circa 4.7600+ again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is currently being hit by the risk-off mood, with both Brent and WTI in the red. Brent is falling faster than WTI as a result of Libya&#39;s NOC resuming control of Eastern oil ports, with operations set to resume to normal levels &ldquo;in a few hours&rdquo; as of 08:45 BST. This is undoing the support offered on Tuesday by a larger than expected draw in API crude inventories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The metals sector is also seeing broad based losses, with Gold down 0.2%, copper fell over 3% during Asia-Pac trade to its lowest in around a year, Shanghai zinc fell limit down shortly after the Chinese open and lead is languishing around near 1 year lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Platinum is also in negative territory with the market set for its 4th consecutive surplus this year, on the back of falling demand in the auto sector, as according to the CPM Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (6 Jul) -6.795M vs. Exp. -4.500M (Prev. -4.500M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Cushing Number (6 Jul) -1.925M (Prev. -2.600M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Gasoline Stocks (6 Jul) -1.590M vs. Exp. -0.800M (Prev. -3.000M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Distillate Stocks (6 Jul) 1.952M vs. Exp. 1.200M (Prev. -0.438M)</p>\r\n",

This new list was said to include several metals and as such material names are underperforming alongside energy names (on softer oil prices), but losses are broad based and being seen across all sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>21st Century Fox have increased their bid for Sky to GBP 14.00/share, an independent committee from Sky has said they have reached an agreement on this increased recommended pre-conditional cash offer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indivior shares are crashing after the co. cut FY guidance and see lower revenues than analysts expect for the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - Extending recent losses vs its US counterpart and underperformance within the G10 bloc, with a further retreat from near 0.7500 peaks to test support just ahead of the big figure below (0.7401 is the 10 DMA and support from there not seen until the 61.8% fib around 0.7377). The Aud continues to track US-China import tariff developments as a barometer for wider global trade contagion and repercussions given closest links and relations with China, while its NZD antipodean peer is less sensitive and has held up better as a result &ndash; cross back below 1.0900 and Kiwi keeping its head over 0.6800 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNH - Taking a direct hit from threats to raise the bar on imports to $250 bn in total by Beijing in response to a further $200 bn Chinese goods and services listed by the White House, but also weaker via the latest PBoC Cny fix amidst ongoing speculation that depreciation could be deployed as another trade war weapon. Usd/Cnh closed around 6.6667, with resistance seen just above 6.7000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - Still rangy between 1.3110-55 vs its US rival and largely immune to fluctuating oil prices as attention turns to an almost completely priced in 25 bp hike from the BoC later today. Indeed, break-evens via options over the event are relatively low around +/- 80 pips, but the accompanying statement and post-policy meeting press conference by Poloz and Wilkins to present the latest MPR all provide plenty of potential to surprise with the emphasis on forward guidance and whether it&rsquo;s a dovish, hawkish or neutral hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP/JPY/CHF - All very narrowly mixed vs the Dollar, with perhaps a mild preference for the safer-havens, as the single currency meanders between 1.1705-50, Cable flits from 1.3250-85, Jpy straddles 111.00 and Franc trades within a 0.9905-30 band, eyeing further global protectionism moves, Brexit and any other drivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM/SCANDI - Weaker across the board on general risk-off position and more independent bearish factors as the Lira lurches again on more fall-out from President Erdogan&rsquo;s cabinet appointments and Usd/Try rallies to circa 4.7500 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts both recorded new session peaks earlier, albeit very marginal in the case of the latter, at 162.80 and 123.16 respectively (+42 and +24 ticks), before waning amidst a recovery of sorts in EU stock markets (or a degree of stability to be precise). Core debt futures may also have lost momentum due to issuance ahead of Germany&rsquo;s new 10 year cash bond and during book building for the UK linker syndication (2041 maturity). Similarly, US Treasuries are off best levels, though still firm awaiting Wall Street&rsquo;s reaction to latest US-China trade war manoeuvres that started after the closing bell on Tuesday and in advance of a busy agenda that includes PPI data and 10 year note supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is currently being hit by the risk-off mood, with both Brent and WTI in the red. Brent is falling faster than WTI as a result of Libya&#39;s NOC resuming control of Eastern oil ports, with operations set to resume to normal levels &ldquo;in a few hours&rdquo; as of 08:45 BST. This is undoing the support offered on Tuesday by a larger than expected draw in API crude inventories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The metals sector is also seeing broad based losses, with Gold down 0.2%, copper fell over 3% during Asia-Pac trade to its lowest in around a year, Shanghai zinc fell limit down shortly after the Chinese open and lead is languishing around near 1 year lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Platinum is also in negative territory with the market set for its 4th consecutive surplus this year, on the back of falling demand in the auto sector, as according to the CPM Group.</p>\r\n",

The 10 year benchmark has rebounded firmly over 123.00, as expected, to a 123.15 high so far vs yesterday&rsquo;s 122.92 close, as Bunds marginally extend their upside to 162.71 (+33 ticks on the day). Ahead, no UK data scheduled, but an after hours speech from BoE Governor Carney could be influential as Gilts succumb to some selling pressure and retreat to 122.91 for no obvious reason, while Cable ticks up towards 1.3300 again, but also absent of a clear catalyst.</p>\r\n",

As such, copper dropped over 3% to its lowest in around a year and Shanghai zinc fell limit down shortly after the open, while gold prices were pressured in tandem with the blood bath across the metals complex. Elsewhere, crude also declined in which Brent crude briefly fell below USD 78.00/bbl and WTI was also weaker as the risk averse tone overshadowed the initial support from a larger than expected draw in API crude inventories,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (6 Jul) -6.795M vs. Exp. -4.500M (Prev. -4.500M). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UAE Energy Minister Al Mazrouei said he is concerned about supply and not about demand, while he added that demand will be robust over the next decade and that OPEC will fail if it targets an oil price. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US officials held discussions in Saudi Arabia to help partners find alternatives to Iranian oil and discussed maintaining a well-stocked oil market to guard against volatility. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EIA cut forecast for 2018 world oil demand growth by 80k BPD to a total 1.72mln BPD Y/Y rise, while it also cut forecast for 2019 world oil demand growth by 10k BPD to a total 1.71mln BPD Y/Y rise. (Newswires)<br /><br />Credit Suisse raised 2018 WTI crude price forecast to USD 67.25/bbl from USD 66.00/bbl and raised 2018 Brent crude forecast to USD 73.50 from USD 71.00/bbl. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chile government raised its view of 2018 copper prices to USD 3.12/lb from USD 2.88/lb and stated that copper price fall is transitory. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite thin volumes, the familiar theme of flattening was again seen on Tuesday; 2s30s and 5s30s printed fresh narrows not seen in a decade, while 2s10s narrowed further, and was beneath 28bps at settlement. US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 3+ ticks lower at 120-00+. However, prices were then buoyed on safe-haven bids following the announcement of a fresh US tariff list on Chinese goods which saw T-notes higher by as much as 10 ticks overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Discount Rate Minutes stated that Fed directors reported solid economic activity and that some regional Fed directors were concerned by trade risks, while it also noted that 11 banks sought a hike to the discount rate in which all but the NY Fed voted for a hike.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks slumped across the board with sentiment spooked on increased trade concerns after the US announced a new tariff list on an additional USD 200bln worth of Chinese goods. The renewed US trade offensive picks up from Trump&rsquo;s threats made last month and in turn weighed heavily on US equity futures as well as Asia-Pac bourses, while some commodities in Shanghai went into free fall alongside the broad risk-averse tone. ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) were lower with commodity-related sectors in Australia suffering after declines in the complex in which Shanghai Zinc fell 6% to hit limit down and copper fell to its lowest in about a year, while losses in Tokyo were exacerbated by safe haven flows into the JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.9%) took the brunt of the increased trade tensions, although both were off the day&rsquo;s lows after an initial composed response from China which stated it was vital to send a positive signal of cooperation and suggested that if the US will go low, it will go high. Finally, T-note futures traded higher overnight with prices spurred by the tariff list announcement, while 10yr JGBs were flat after they failed to benefit from the broad risk-averse tone, as well as the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 960bln in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks slumped across the board with sentiment spooked on increased trade concerns after the US announced a new tariff list on an additional USD 200bln worth of Chinese goods. The renewed US trade offensive picks up from Trump&rsquo;s threats made last month and in turn weighed heavily on US equity futures as well as Asia-Pac bourses, while some commodities in Shanghai went into free fall alongside the broad risk-averse tone. ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) are lower with commodity-related sectors in Australia suffering after declines in the complex in which Zinc fell 6% to hit limit down in Shanghai and copper fell to its lowest in about a year, while losses in Tokyo were exacerbated by safe haven flows into the JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.6%) took the brunt of the increased trade tensions, although both are off the day&rsquo;s lows after China refrained from adding fuel to the fire through an immediate retaliation, but instead stated it was vital to send a positive signal of cooperation and suggested that if the US will go low, it will go high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the risk averse tone from the increased trade tensions spurred flows into safe-haven JPY which briefly dragged USD/JPY below the 111.00 handle, while JPY crosses were similarly pressured. Elsewhere, AUD, NZD and CAD suffered due to their high beta properties and amid declines across commodities, while China&rsquo;s currency was the worst performer in which CNH dropped as much as 500 pips against the greenback on the tariff threat and continued expectations the currency may be used as a future trade weapon. Conversely, the DXY is flat after it largely ignored the fresh tariff list announcement and with its main counterparts across the pond also unmoved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, T-note futures trade higher overnight with prices spurred by the tariff list announcement, while 10yr JGBs are flat and failed to benefit from the broad risk-averse tone, as well as the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 960bln in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",
