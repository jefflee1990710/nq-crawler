        "subject": "PREVIEW: RBI unanimously expected to keep rates unchanged in policy announcement due later at 1000BST/0400CDT/1700HKT",
        "content": "<p>The RBI is to conclude its first bi-monthly policy meeting for the 2018-2019 fiscal year later, where the central bank is expected to stand pat with all economists surveyed unanimously anticipating the central bank to maintain the Repurchase Rate at 6.00%, Reverse Repo Rate at 5.75% and Cash Reserve Ratio at 4.00%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the one-sided expectations for today&rsquo;s announcement, forecasts are less clear-cut for what the central bank may do throughout the financial year as one survey showed 6 out of 15 economists expect a hike, 2 were calling for a cut, 4 forecast a prolonged pause by the RBI and 3 anticipate the RBI to be data dependent. Furthermore, a separate larger poll suggested 60% were predicting the central bank to shift to a policy tightening stance by year-end and that the consensus was for a 25bps hike during Q1 2019 vs. Prev. forecast for a first hike during H2 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent data releases from India hints to a lack of urgency to adjust policy rates as India CPI for February eased to 4.4% vs. Exp. 4.7% (Prev. 5.1%) and although this effectively increases the scope for rate cuts, stronger Industrial Production growth at 7.5% vs. Exp. 6.4% (Prev. 7.1%) would suggest that looser policy is currently unwarranted. Furthermore, the backdrop of policy normalization or intentions thereof, amongst some of the major global central banks would also be a hindrance for the RBI to lower rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent notable development which has been the centre of focus in India was the bank loan fraud in which the country&rsquo;s 2nd biggest lender Punjab National Bank discovered the largest loan fraud in the nation&rsquo;s history. This resulted to the RBI banning the use of Letters of Undertaking and Letters of Comfort as trade credits for imports, which in turn raised concerns for businesses and that importers&rsquo; costs would increase as they would now need more USD for payments to overseas suppliers which would also pressure INR. Therefore, the uncertainty following the ban of these guarantees would be another factor likely to persuade the RBI to maintain a wait-and-see approach in the near-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another fall-out of the banking fraud scandal, was the differences between the government and RBI regarding regulatory powers over public sector banks in which the government dismissed calls by the central bank for increased authority over the nation&rsquo;s banking sector. This refusal by the government to the RBI&rsquo;s request may somewhat place a dampener on their relationship and could in turn lessen the RBI&rsquo;s susceptibility to conform next time the government pressures again for rate cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s decision is due out at 10:00BST and as forecasts are one-sided for no changes in rates, focus will turn to the accompanying statement for any hints on the central bank&rsquo;s thinking and whether there is any shift from its current neutral stance. As a reminder, the impact to INR from RBI announcements are not so straight-forward as dovish surprises have in the past underpinned the currency instead of weakening it, which is due to the suspected inflows of funds on the back of more favourable policies.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, there were also reports that new tariffs on US products were worth USD 50bln and that China is to start the retaliatory levies whenever the US starts their tariffs. (Newswires/Securities News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House said there will be a couple of months before China tariffs are implemented, while it noted the review period is ongoing and if China does not make changes, the US will go ahead with their tariffs. In related news, the White House also said there is no new big trade initiative directed at China planned at this time which has not already been announced but said new actions could come in time. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said we are not in a trade war with China and that the Trade Deficit cannot continue, while White House Economic Adviser Kudlow thinks China will &quot;back down&quot; and &quot;play ball&quot; regarding trade. Furthermore, Kudlow also added that President Trump&#39;s tariffs on China are all proposals. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Ambassador said China prefers to resolve trade dispute with US through negotiations, but it takes two to tango. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />NAFTA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAFTA negotiators are said to be reviewing alternatives on origin rules for autos, with US officials showing a more flexible approach to the issue according to sources. In related news, Canadian NAFTA negotiators are said to be open to US ideas on agreeing on a deal but are skeptical on completing the remaining chapters in the next 2 weeks as big gaps remain. However, they think a symbolic agreement in principle showing consensus on some important issues is possible, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Ambassador to Canada Craft said they have every confidence that US and Canada will fix NAFTA, while Canada Ambassador to the US MacNaughton, said &#39;a lot of issues&#39; remain on NAFTA but noted that he is pleased with the positive tone of discussions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were reports that President is said to soften NAFTA autos proposal and lower 85% demand on some auto parts, while White House Economic Adviser Kudlow said that NAFTA negotiations are proceeding rather well.

There was a small bid in USD after ADP data, but moves were fleeting. On Wednesday, some of the bid in havens had deflated slightly, helping USDJPY to move towards the top end of its recent range, eyeing 107.00 as we head into Asia. CHF was lower against the EUR and USD, and though gold trades positive at pixel time, it has given up most of its gains on the day having failed to test the $1350 level. In Europe, HICP data ticked-up in line with expectations, though core inflation remains subdued, which contributed to a very small bout of EUR weakness. But with that said, the common currency remains within the well-worn range between ~1.2250 and ~1.2450; the next catalyst for EURUSD is likely to be Friday&rsquo;s NFP report, and Powell&rsquo;s speech later in the afternoon. GBP initially dropped after a weak construction PMI, though losses were pared back, and the pound trades up against the buck, flat against the EUR. CAD continues to ride the wave of positive NAFTA commentary, falling outside the bottom-end of its recent range (around 1.28); today&rsquo;s positive comments were sponsored by NEC director Kudlow, Canada Foreign Minister Freeland, and the US ambassador to Canada.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks (29 Mar) -4.617M vs. Exp. 1.400M (Prev. 1.643M). (Newswires)<br />US crude production rose 0.26% to 10.46mln bpd. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Bullard (Non-Voter, Dove) said current interest rate is close to neutral and repeated it is not necessary to raise rates. Bullard added he has not observed a lot of wage inflation in the domestic economy, while he also commented that a trade war presents downside risks and that more uncertainty is likely to keep rates lower for. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US ADP National Employment (Mar) 241k vs. Exp. 210k (Prev. 235k, Rev. 246k). (Newswires)<br />US ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI (Mar) 58.8 vs. Exp. 59.0 (Prev. 59.5)<br />US Factory Orders MM (Feb) 1.2% vs. Exp. 1.7% (Prev. -1.4%, Rev. -1.3%)<br />US Markit Services PMI Final (Mar) 54.0 vs. Exp. 54.3 (Prev. 54.1)<br />US Markit Comp Final PMI (Mar) 54.2 (Prev. 54.3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Equity futures started trade on Wednesday deeply in the red; trade war uncertainties hit Wall St. after China retaliated against US tariffs with their own reciprocal measures, which led to a decline in industrial names such as Boeing (BA) and Deere (DE). However, as trade progressed, markets seemed to shake-off the tariff concerns, paring back losses and closing higher. Comments from NEC Director Kudlow helped, after he stated that the US measures were a form of trade negotiations, and back-channel talks with China were occurring; analysts, have also noted that the impact of the initially announced tariffs seems manageable, and perhaps markets have over reacted; the fear arises from any escalation which could lead to further more destructive measures. In M&amp;A news CNBC&rsquo;s Faber reported CBS (CBS) offered Viacom (VIAB) USD 0.55/shr and that Viacom immediately rejected the offer. Sources later reported that VIAB is preparing a counter-proposal by asking for over USD 0.62/shr. Elsewhere in tech, sentiment around Amazon (AMZN) was further buoyed on Wednesday after White House officials told CNBC that there are almost certainly no specific policy actions going from the White House which target AMZN. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) reported that the recently reported data leak hit 87mln users &ndash; it had previously said it was around 50mln users. SPX +1.14% at 2645, NDX +1.57% at 6560, DJI +0.96% at 24265.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modest bear-steepening along the Treasury curve, after the pre-market risk-averse sentiment was shaken-off. Again, block trades in TYM8 helped some of the selling bias, as yesterday. Decent ADP employment data (beat expectations, prior revised up) has raised hopes of a stellar NFP report on Friday, seeing Tsys back-off highs, though analysts offered the usual caution about reading too much into the ADP data as a guide for the official NFP data. Additionally, risk sentiment was stoked in the US morning after constructive comments by US NEC Director Kudlow, where he intimated that the US and Chinese were in discussions over trade, and the market shouldn&rsquo;t over-react to the initial, small steps taken to fight against China&rsquo;s alleged theft of US intellectual property. T-Note futures (June 2018) settled half a tick lower at 120-26+.</p>\r\n",

However, as trade progressed, markets seemed to shake-off the tariff concerns, paring back losses and closing higher. Comments from NEC Director Kudlow helped, after he stated that the US measures were a form of trade negotiations, and back-channel talks with China were occurring; analysts, have also noted that the impact of the initially announced tariffs seems manageable, and perhaps markets have over reacted; the fear arises from any escalation which could lead to further more destructive measures. In M&amp;A news CNBC&rsquo;s Faber reported CBS (CBS) offered Viacom (VIAB) USD 0.55/shr and that Viacom immediately rejected the offer. Sources later reported that VIAB is preparing a counter-proposal by asking for over USD 0.62/shr. Elsewhere in tech, sentiment around Amazon (AMZN) was further buoyed on Wednesday after White House officials told CNBC that there are almost certainly no specific policy actions going from the White House which target AMZN. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) reported that the recently reported data leak hit 87mln users &ndash; it had previously said it was around 50mln users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: T-Note futures (June 2018) settled half a tick lower at 120-26+.</strong><br />Modest bear-steepening along the Treasury curve, after the pre-market risk-averse sentiment was shaken-off. Again, block trades in TYM8 helped some of the selling bias, as yesterday. Decent ADP employment data (beat expectations, prior revised up) has raised hopes of a stellar NFP report on Friday, seeing Tsys back-off highs, though analysts offered the usual caution about reading too much into the ADP data as a guide for the official NFP data. Additionally, risk sentiment was stoked in the US morning after constructive comments by US NEC Director Kudlow, where he intimated that the US and Chinese were in discussions over trade, and the market shouldn&rsquo;t over-react to the initial, small steps taken to fight against China&rsquo;s alleged theft of US intellectual property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY flat heading into APAC trade.</strong><br />The DXY trades flat in late trade; Fed speakers (Mester, voter; Bullard, non-voter) has little sway on price action, more-or-less repeating recent remarks. There was a small bid in USD after ADP data, but moves were fleeting. On Wednesday, some of the bid in havens had deflated slightly, helping USDJPY to move towards the top end of its recent range, eyeing 107.00 as we head into Asia. CHF was lower against the EUR and USD, and though gold trades positive at pixel time, it has given up most of its gains on the day having failed to test the $1350 level. In Europe, HICP data ticked-up in line with expectations, though core inflation remains subdued, which contributed to a very small bout of EUR weakness. But with that said, the common currency remains within the well-worn range between ~1.2250 and ~1.2450; the next catalyst for EURUSD is likely to be Friday&rsquo;s NFP report, and Powell&rsquo;s speech later in the afternoon. GBP initially dropped after a weak construction PMI, though losses were pared back, and the pound trades up against the buck, flat against the EUR. CAD continues to ride the wave of positive NAFTA commentary, falling outside the bottom-end of its recent range (around 1.28); today&rsquo;s positive comments were sponsored by NEC director Kudlow, Canada Foreign Minister Freeland, and the US ambassador to Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures (May) settle down 14 cents at $63.37; Brent futures (June) settles 10 cents lower at $68.02.</strong><br />Although crude entered Wednesday supported by API data which signalled a surprise draw in headline crude stocks, concerns that trade conflicts could escalate kept risk assets soggy. The latest DOE energy inventory data helped crude to pare back some of those losses. DOE reported headline crude stocks drew 4.6mln (versus an expected build of 1.6mln), Cushing built by 3.6mln (vs expected build of 1.8mln), gasoline drew in line with expectations at 1.1mln, while distillates built 537k versus expectations of a draw. The headline build was supported by a 738k BPD rise in total demand and a 223k BPD fall in supply. WTI prices ticked up in the aftermath of the release. Ahead of the OPEC MOMR report, a Reuters poll finds analyst see OPEC crude output falling by 90k BPD M/M to 32.19mln BPD in March, which would be the lowest since April 2017, with declines driven by Venezuela, Angola and Libya. Analysts see compliance with the OPEC+ output cut deal at 159%, up from 154% in February. Elsewhere, UAE&rsquo;s ADNOC has retroactively cut its March crude prices for all three grades, and in geopolitics, the Saudi energy minister said that attacks by Yemen&rsquo;s Houthis had not impacted Saudi supplies.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Asia traded somewhat indecisive as the region failed to take full impetus from the rebound on Wall St</strong>, where all major indices recovered lost ground and reprieve for tech stocks pushed the Nasdaq back into the green YTD<strong>. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%)</strong> initially caught a tail wind from the momentum stateside and both opened higher, but then failed to hold on to the gains as trade concerns lingered after the US announced its proposed China tariff list. This was met by condemnation from China which is also said to be planning reciprocal tariffs of equal scale and strength. Conversely, <strong>Hang Seng (-2.2%)</strong> was choppy and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) </strong>shrugged-off the trade tensions and disappointing Caixin PMI data, to trade with a positive tone ahead of the extended weekend for the mainland and following reports of a USD 9.7bln bailout for Chinese conglomerate Anbang Insurance. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful amid the indecisive risk tone in the region and as JGBs took a breather from yesterday&rsquo;s gains which saw the 20yr yield drop to its lowest since late 2016. The BoJ were also present in the market under its bond buying program for 1yr-10yr JGBs, although it maintained the purchase amounts in line with the prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Services PMI (Mar) 52.3 vs. Exp. 54.5 (Prev. 54.2).

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets have been shaken up amid China&rsquo;s most recent tit-for-tat tariff announcement on 106 US products. As a result, European equities have slipped firmly into the red (Eurostoxx 50 -1.3%). The tech sector opened softer following US President Trump proposing a tariff list on China consisting mostly of tech products. Industrials and materials have edged lower amid fears of a lag in global growth as trade disputes escalate. Elsewhere, in terms of stocks specifics, WPP (-1.8%) is lower as CEO Martin Sorrell is under investigation for misconduct claims. Swiss Re (-3.4%) shares are lower following reports the company is in talks with Softbank over a minority stake of no more than 10%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi has extended gains and outperformance in the G10 arena to trade up near 0.7300 vs the Usd, as cross flows underpin the NZ unit and offset bullish macro fundamentals for its antipodean peer &ndash; Aud/Usd briefly above 0.7700 overnight on the back of significantly stronger than expected Aussie retail sales data, but Aud/Nzd down below 1.0550 from 1.0600+ peaks yesterday and a major US bank favours a long Nzd/Jpy position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar index is just about clinging to 90.000+ levels amidst more US vs China import tariff measures and countermeasures as the trade war ratchets up a few more notches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the more volatile majors again, but this time on broader risk sentiment factors rather than BoJ policy statements and misperceptions. Usd/Jpy hit highs near 106.70 overnight, but is now retreating through modest bids at 106.40 to a circa 106.00 low as China backs up strong words with action via 25% taxes on 106 US products totalling Usd50 bn (ie equal and opposite to the US).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both now firmer vs the retreating Greenback and revisiting recent peaks (around 1.2300+ and 0.9550 respectively) as aversion and safe-haven positioning resurfaces. EUR was largely unphased by the latest Eurozone CPI data with the headline printing in-line with expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling undermined by a much weaker than expected UK Construction PMI (47.0 vs. consensus 50.9), with cable down below 1.4050 vs almost 1.4100 at best and Eur/Gbp close to 0.8750 from near 0.8715.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loonie losing some NAFTA-related gains and the headline pair back over 1.2800 vs 1.2775 earlier, with the global trade rift threatening to undermine if not neutralise any positives from a tri-party agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD/CNY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up sharply on the latest US-Chinese protectionism offensives to around 6.3000 vs the PBOC&rsquo;s 6.2926 mid-point fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honours pretty even on the 5 year auction front, but probably Germany just shading it with a negative yield and clearly better financing conditions vs the UK&rsquo;s DMO at just over 1%. Hence, benchmark Bunds are now climbing a new intraday peaks on Eurex at 159.65, +35 ticks vs Gilts at 122.99 for a 21 tick gain on the day. USTs just off best levels and back in flattening mode as global stocks succumb to more selling pressure on the ramp up in China-US import tariff trade-off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of commodities, oil is trading at session lows after China responded with extensive retaliatory measures against the US. Oil prices continue to slip further after yesterday&rsquo;s APIs, which showed a surprise drawdown of 3.3mln for headline crude, but a build in the other product components.

In the middle of March, ECB President Draghi said he wants to see further evidence that inflation is moving towards target (close to, but below 2%), noting underlying inflation pressures remain subdued compared to previous recoveries, and that there are still risks.

        "content": "<p>Asia trades somewhat mixed as region fails to take full impetus from the rebound on Wall St, where all major indices recovered lost ground and reprieve for tech stocks pushed the Nasdaq back into the green YTD. ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) initially caught a tail wind from the momentum stateside and both opened higher, but then failed to hold on to the gains as trade concerns lingered after the US announced its proposed China tariff list. This was then met by condemnation from China which are also said to be planning reciprocal tariffs of equal scale and strength. Conversely, Hang Seng (+0.1%) trades choppy and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) shrugs off the trade tensions and disappointing Caixin PMI data, to trade with a positive tone ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s holiday closure and the start of the extended weekend for the mainland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback has weakened against its major counterparts overnight amid US trade policy concerns which has helped EUR/USD nurse some of the prior day&rsquo;s losses, while GBP/USD rose to just shy of the 1.4100 handle. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY crosses remain elevated following the risk-related flows seen during US hours, while antipodeans have also gained with AUD/USD underpinned by better than expected Retail Sales data to break back above 0.7700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid the indecisive risk tone in the region and as JGBs take a breather from yesterday&rsquo;s gains which saw the 20yr yield drop to its lowest since late 2016. Furthermore, the BoJ are present in the market under its bond buying program for 1yr-10yr JGBs, although it maintained the intended purchase amounts in line with the prior.</p>\r\n",
