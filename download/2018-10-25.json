Its statement reiterated that inflation is on track to converge to target and that risks for growth remain broadly balance. The ECB acknowledged that recent data was somewhat weaker than expected, though highlighted that domestic demand and pro-cyclical fiscal policies were encouraging. At the conference, the key message from ECB&rsquo;s Draghi was that core inflation is expected to pick-up and converge to target, supported by expanding and tightening labour markets as well as increasing negotiated wages in some countries. He also stressed economic conditions would have to deteriorate significantly for the ECB to change its current policy framework; a QE extension was not discussed. Alongside this, the current stalemate between US and China, Brexit and Italy were cited as sources of uncertainty. When asked about Italy, Draghi said he cannot exclude a spill over effect, though was likely to be limited. He touched on reinvestment policy, stating the ECB intends to invest maturing securities for an extended period of time after the end of asset purchases, and as long as necessary to maintain ample monetary accommodation and liquidity conditions. ING argues that the latest meeting demonstrated the ECB&rsquo;s commitment to end QE in December and only &ldquo;a severe downturn of the economy&rdquo; in the next 6 weeks could change that. On the flip side, ABN AMRO believes a &ldquo;growth downgrade could well still follow in December&rdquo;; they see the first 10bps hike coming in December next year, as they warn &ldquo;financial markets are too aggressive in their current pricing&rdquo;. Following the meeting, sources reported that ECB is looking to distribute large PSPP reinvestments over longer period from next year. ECB&#39;s Villeroy spoke and noted the ECB is increasingly confident in the inflation path; he added the question of TLROs will need to be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed Vice Chair Clarida (permanent voter) said some further rate hikes are warranted; he sees current policy as accommodative and believes higher rates will be appropriate. He noted the Fed is at its price stability goal and sees forward guidance as an effective tool, but depends on how far a central bank is from its goals. He also highlighted productivity is beginning to improve and inflation is not flashing red; he added alarm bells are going off from the labour market. He went on to say he would not rule out QE from the Fed&#39;s tool kit and is uncomfortable with the Fed getting too deeply into influencing asset prices; he feels the later rounds of QE were less effective with higher potential costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The WSJ reported the US will not resume trade talks without a firm proposal from China, highlighting that the impasse between the nations threatens to undermine a meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping scheduled for the end of November at the G20 meeting. A Senior White House Official said: &quot;If China wants [the G-20 session] to be a meaningful meeting, we need to do the groundwork&quot; adding that &quot;if they don&rsquo;t give us any information, it&rsquo;s just hard to see how that becomes fruitful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>The EU said they have not received a reply from Italy in regard to their budget. Meanwhile, the government continues to defend its fiscal plan as leaders believe the 2019 deficit target of 2.4% of GDP should not be changed; the two Deputy PMs Salvini and Di Maio said to be monitoring the banking system and to be prepared to offer any assistance to companies or banks that need support. Di Maio is also confident the IT/GE bond yield spread will fall in the next few weeks, adding that the spread is widening over fear of an Italexit. In related comments, Italy&#39;s EU Minister Savona said if the Italian/German bond yields rises and nobody intervenes then the banks could be put in a difficult situation; he added the ECB should indicate solutions to problems in the banking system and potentially intervene if there is a crisis. Also, Salvini, when asked about Draghi&#39;s confidence in a budget deal between Italy and EU commission, said to be wanting a deal but on Italy&rsquo;s terms. In later trade, Finance Minister Tria said once again there is no way Italy wants to leave the Euro adding the budget plan is not a threat to the Eurozone or to the stability of our European partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK Brexit Secretary Raab noted that planning and preparations are in place to mitigate and deal with the risks of a no deal, noting the risk of a no-deal is real if the EU engages in an intransigent approach. He also noted good progress has been made and they are close to a deal; he believes a second referendum would erode the public&#39;s trust in democracy. Similarly, a UK PM May spokesperson said negotiations with the EU are ongoing and reported that PM May rules out a second referendum and will deliver on Brexit. Elsewhere, Irish PM Varadkar said the UK proposal is not an alternative to the Irish backstop, but it may be part of the solution; he stressed the UK proposal would have to be on the basis of a level playing field with a single market. In late trade, it was reported Brexit talks are on hold as UK PM May&#39;s team cannot agree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DURABALE GOODS</strong> rose 0.8% in September, expectations were for a 1% fall, on the back of a 119.1% rise in defence aircraft orders which more than doubled last month. Gains were more modest elsewhere; transportation orders were up 1.9% and motor vehicles and part orders gained 1.3% whilst capital goods fell 0.1%. Analysts at Wells Fargo note that although trends in today&rsquo;s report were positive, business spending signals were soft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PENDING HOME SALES </strong>rose 0.5%, consensus was for a 0.1% drop, suggesting hurricanes Michael and Florence had limited impact. Nonetheless, analysts at Pantheon warn the &ldquo;overall housing market picture is discouraging&rdquo; amid modest declines in mortgage applications; higher mortgage rates and tighter lending standards are also hurting activity. Pantheon has &ldquo;no expectation that this picture will change anytime soon&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +1.87% at 2705, NDX +3.43% at 7022, DJI +1.63% at 24985. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +1.15%, Materials +1.38%, Industrials +0.73%, Cons Discretionary +3.41%, Cons Staples +0.20%, Healthcare +1.25%, Financials +1.64%, Tech +3.32%, Telecoms +2.66%, Utilities -1.47%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Today saw the most single-day earnings reports out of this quarter where big names such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V) beat EPS estimates causing them to trade higher. Tesla (TSLA) also moved higher after posting a profit for the first time in two years and Twitter (TWTR) made gains into double digits following strong EPS and monthly average user numbers. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) was a top mover too after its latest game &ldquo;Red Dead Redemption 2&rdquo; came in with strong reviews. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dipped sharply following a revenue miss and lower than expected Q4 revenue guidance. Raytheon (RAN) traded lower on the back of comments that it expects its 2019 profit margins will not grow from the 2018 levels. Other bottom movers coming out of earnings reports included EQT Corporation (EQT) and Equifax (EFX) which both missed EPS estimates and Newmont Mining (NEM) which missed on its revenue estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.51 HIGHER AT USD 67.33/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.72 HIGHER AT USD 76.89/BBL.</strong> Some bargain hunting was being cited for crude&rsquo;s moves higher on Thursday. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s gains are being supported by an apparent pivot on the part of Saudi Arabia and OPEC away from reassuring customers that the response to US sanctions on Iran will maintain adequate supply towards keeping inventories under control,&rdquo; Citi said. The bank has been highlighting the larger supply/demand imbalance, with rising non-OPEC supply and weaker first half seasonal demand, the call on OPEC crude will drop from 32.67mln BPD in Q4 to 31.53mln BPD in Q1, &ldquo;suggesting that the market will remain in balance if Iranian output falls by a similar amount, but a need for production restraint on the part of other OPEC producer if it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Citi says, adding that &ldquo;OPEC may need the &lsquo;options&rsquo; that they are asking their technical committees to prepare, but in the meantime, the market may view the wider OPEC concern over a potential surplus as support.&rdquo; OPEC+ JMMC on Thursday said it was concerned about rising inventories in recent weeks and looming macroeconomic uncertainties which may require changing course; S. Russia Novak said Russia was ready to continue its cooperation with OPEC/NOPEC producers, adding that the market was currently in balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE DOWN 3 TICKS AT 118-17. </strong>Treasuries remained marginally lower on Thursday, moving in opposite direction to equities which strongly rebounded from yesterday&rsquo;s sell-off. The complex shrugged off solid UK data including durables goods and pending home sales; most of the action was in the belly of the curve were yields were higher by just over 1bps at settlement. 2s5s were wider by c.1bps whilst 5s30s were narrower by c.2bps. The US Treasury sold USD 31bln of 7-year notes, tailing by 0.5bps; demand for the auction was soft with the bid-to-cover coming in at 2.39x, slightly below recent averages but highest since January. Directs took a portion less than half recent averages and the lowest since 2011 and indirects were awarded the biggest slice of the auction together securing ~70%; dealers were left with the remining ~30%, slightly above recent averages. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FX: </strong>FX markets started off on a tentative footing with the DXY initially contained towards the mid-point of its recent 96.00-96.50 range. Subsequently, most majors followed suit with EUR/USD hovering around 1.1400 ahead of today&rsquo;s ECB monetary policy announcement. In terms of today&rsquo;s policy release from the ECB, the decision itself and accompanying statement saw little in the way of material changes with focus instead on the accompanying press conference. Draghi refrained from downgrading the Eurozone economic outlook to suggest that risks were now &lsquo;tilted to the downside&rsquo; and instead continued to view risks as &lsquo;broadly balanced&rsquo;. This allied with bullish commentary on wage prospects lent a helping hand to EUR/USD to touch a high of 1.1432. However, the move was short-lived as the USD-index breached 96.50 to the upside alongside the Wall St open which then set the tone for the rest of the session with EUR/USD subsequently moving to a 1.1300 handle to probe levels last seen in mid-August, and ending the US session jus over 1.1350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD strength also placed further weight on the GBP which was initially resilient in early EU trade with cable straddling the 1.2900 level amid limited fallout from Mrs May&rsquo;s appearance in front of the 1922 committee. May supporters were granted some reprieve from the meeting with opposition seemingly unable to put forward a replacement candidate, but the Parliamentary arithmetic remains complex for the PM and as such Lloyds continue to float the prospect of a potential move to 1.2800 for the pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere in the central bank scope, both the Norges and CBRT came to market with their latest policy announcements. Starting off with events in Norway, price action for NOK was relatively contained after the Bank stood pat on rates, stuck to the script laid out in September and continue to view Q1 2019 as their next opportunity to lift rates with the Bank&rsquo;s economic assessment broadly unchanged from the prior release. Over in Turkey, the CBRT opted to stand pat on rates after their mammoth hike last time around. In the accompanying statement, the Bank vowed to deliver further monetary tightening if needed, will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of price stability. This saw the TRY gain ground against the USD with CBRT suggesting that their rate-hike cycle might still have some room to run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, USD/JPY managed to reclaim 112.00 to the upside overnight with some suggestions of selling fatigue with the move to the upside further aided by the positivity seen alongside the Wall St open which lifted the pair above 112.50. However, flow activity indicates that markets are mindful of a potential move towards 110.00 if recent stock turbulence becomes a more prevalent theme in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: PRIMER: CBR Rate Decision to be published at 1130 BST on Friday 26 October 2018. </strong>After the CBR unexpectedly raised rates by 25bps at its previous policy meeting, the consensus expects the central bank to maintain its one-week auction rate at 7.50%. Analysts at Barclays suggest that September&#39;s rate hike has probably done enough to contain the pressure in the RUB and given the still below target inflation and a weak economy. Accordingly, the central bank is also seen leaving its FX purchase on pause until the end of the year. Since the previous meeting, the RUB has strengthened by around 7% against the USD; HSBC notes that &quot;the suspension of FX purchases effectively removes almost USD 30bln of potential demand for hard currency in September-December, allowing the RUB to benefit from high oil prices,&quot; and additionally, &quot;the policy move has stemmed capital outflows, with non-residents&#39; OFZ selling easing to RUB 45bln in September after spiking to almost RUB 100bln the preceding month.&quot; Inflation is also now in line with the central bank&#39;s end-2018 forecast of between 3.8% and 4.2% YY. And additionally, the geopolitical situation may also warrant caution. HSBC explains that &quot;The 90-day deadline for Russia to avoid possible further sanctions relating to the Skripal case expires 10 days after the MPC, suggesting policymakers might wait to see if any fresh action is taken,&quot; and also that the US&#39; Congress will not have an opportunity to consider two additional legislative initiatives on Russian sanctions prior to mid-term elections on 6 November.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: EUR/USD back on a 1.13 handle after DXY strength out-muscles optimistic Draghi",
        "content": "<p>FX markets started off on a tentative footing with the DXY initially contained towards the mid-point of its recent 96.00-96.50 range. Subsequently, most majors followed suit with EUR/USD hovering around 1.1400 ahead of today&rsquo;s ECB monetary policy announcement. In terms of today&rsquo;s policy release from the ECB, the decision itself and accompanying statement saw little in the way of material changes with focus instead on the accompanying press conference. Draghi refrained from downgrading the Eurozone economic outlook to suggest that risks were now &lsquo;tilted to the downside&rsquo; and instead continued to view risks as &lsquo;broadly balanced&rsquo;. This allied with bullish commentary on wage prospects lent a helping hand to EUR/USD to touch a high of 1.1432. However, the move was short-lived as the USD-index breached 96.50 to the upside alongside the Wall St open which then set the tone for the rest of the session with EUR/USD subsequently moving to a 1.1300 handle to probe levels last seen in mid-August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD strength also placed further weight on the GBP which was initially resilient in early EU trade with cable straddling the 1.2900 level amid limited fallout from Mrs May&rsquo;s appearance in front of the 1922 committee. May supporters were granted some reprieve from the meeting with opposition seemingly unable to put forward a replacement candidate, but the Parliamentary arithmetic remains complex for the PM and as such Lloyds continue to float the prospect of a potential move to 1.2800 for the pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere in the central bank scope, both the Norges and CBRT came to market with their latest policy announcements. Starting off with events in Norway, price action for NOK was relatively contained &nbsp;after the Bank stood pat on rates, stuck to the script laid out in September and continue to view Q1 2019 as their next opportunity to lift rates with the Bank&rsquo;s economic assessment broadly unchanged from the prior release. Over in Turkey, the CBRT opted to stand pat on rates after their mammoth hike last time around. In the accompanying statement, the Bank vowed to deliver further monetary tightening if needed, will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of price stability. This saw the TRY gain ground against the USD with CBRT suggesting that their rate-hike cycle might still have some room to run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, USD/JPY managed to reclaim 112.00 to the upside overnight with some suggestions of selling fatigue with the move to the upside further aided by the positivity seen alongside the Wall St open which lifted the pair above 112.50. However, flow activity indicates that markets are mindful of a potential move towards 110.00 if recent stock turbulence becomes a more prevalent theme in the market.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (-2.8%) and Nikkei 225 (-3.7%) slumped from the open amid heavy pressure in tech and with losses in Japan magnified by a firmer currency, while corporate updates failed to provide any reprieve as Sharp shares slumped following a cut in its revenue forecasts. Shanghai Comp. (Unch) closed little changed and Hang Seng (-1.2%) saw firm losses with Cathay Pacific shares descending on reports of a data breach that could affect around 9.4mln passengers, although losses in the mainland were to a somewhat lesser extent amid further liquidity efforts by the PBoC and continued supportive rhetoric by Chinese agencies. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked upside in T-notes and with demand underpinned as the stock sell-off spurred a flight to quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 100bln via 7-day reverse repos.

Furthermore, banks in multiple Chinese cities have lowered mortgage rates in what was the first coordinated move since last year, with the rates said to be mostly for first-time buyers.

In Parliament, routine business will be essentially suspended and replaced with a rolling programme of no-deal Brexit legislation. (The Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&#39;s Brexit deal with the EU will be almost impossible to get out of, the Attorney General has warned amid mounting Cabinet opposition. Geoffrey Cox has reportedly made clear that ministers will not be able to change the customs backstop once the UK is signed up to it. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary Raab said the risk of a no-deal is real if the EU engages in an intransigent approach. He added that planning and preparations are in place to mitigate and deal with the risks of a no deal while stating good progress has been made and are close to a deal. Raab also said that a second referendum would erode the public&#39;s trust in democracy.

Eurostoxx 50 (+0.9%) resurfaced after opening in the red while the SMI (-0.4%) failed to take advantage of the rebound as the index is pressured by shares in ABB (-3.0%) and Lonza (-1.7%) amid weak earnings. On the flip side, CAC (+1.4%) is buoyed as 75% of the index is in the green (with the top gainers fuelled by earnings), and Spain&rsquo;s IBEX (+1.3%) is lifted by banking names after Bankinter (+1.5%) reported inspiring earnings. In terms of sectors, telecom names lag along with healthcare while consumer discretionary and materials outperform. Moving onto individual movers, WPP (-18.0%) rests at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after cutting guidance, dragging Publicis (-5.0%) shares lower in sympathy, while AB InBev (-9.0%) shares are also trading with hefty losses amid disappointing earnings across all metrics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets have begun the session on a relatively tentative footing with most majors relatively unchanged thus far alongside a broadly flat DXY which remains contained by its recent 96.00 to 96.50 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European markets await updates from the ECB with EUR/USD contained by offers around 1.1420-25 with analysts also flagging 1.1bln in option expiries for the pair between 1.1420-30. Focus for the ECB release today will likely centre around the Bank&rsquo;s view on risks to the Eurozone&rsquo;s economic outlook and whether risks will continue to be viewed as &lsquo;balanced&rsquo; or &lsquo;tilted to the downside&rsquo;; expectations for any material adjustments to the ECB&rsquo;s forward guidance are relatively low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, GBP has seen little in the way of material price action as GBP/USD straddles the 1.2900 handle (note, 627mln expiry Friday) as political jitters keep any potential moves to the upside contained for now with Lloyds touting the possibility that daily momentum suggest the pair could extend recent losses towards 1.2800. May appears to have survived any potential catastrophic fallout from yesterday&rsquo;s 1922 Committee meeting but intra-party tensions remain a threat to the Brexit process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus during Asia-Pac trade continues to focus on the seemingly one-way moves in USD/CNY with CNY posting its weakest close vs. USD since Jan 3rd 2017. Commentary continuing to speculate over what action (if any the PBoC) will take against defending the 7.00 barrier with this week&rsquo;s measures taken by policymakers unable to reassure markets against the threat of trade conflict from the US. Elsewhere for Asia-Pac currencies, USD/JPY managed to reclaim 112.00 to the upside overnight with some suggestions of selling fatigue, that said, the current stock market rout could lead any optimism to be relatively short-lived; UBS recommends selling rallies between 112.25-35. Notable option expiries for USD/JPY includes 1.3bln at 112.00-10, 815mln at 111.75-85 and 1.7bln at 112.50-60.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s first central bank meeting saw the Norges bank stick to the script laid out in September and continue to view Q1 2019 as their next opportunity to lift rates with the Bank&rsquo;s economic assessment broadly unchanged from the prior release. NOK gained some modest ground against the EUR with the NB looking through growth concerns; EUR/NOK is now back towards 9.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norges Bank left the key policy rate unchaged at 0.75% as expected. The decision was unanimous, the central bank added the outlook and balance of risks do not appear to have changed much from the September report and imply a gradual increase in the key policy rate, repeating plans to lift rates in Q1 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand Trade Balance Sep -1560M vs. Exp. -1365M (Prev. -1484.0M, Rev. -1470M) (Newswires)<br />New Zealand Annual Trade Balance Sep -5.19B vs. Exp. -5.02B (Prev. -4.81B, Rev. -4.79B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is trading flat just above USD 1230/oz, following the overnight equity sell off in Asia, where the yellow metal rose to session highs of as investor sought a safe haven, but has since come off highs. Copper prices have again fallen for the third day in a row, reaching a two-week low as the red metal tracked overnight sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over in the oil complex, WTI (+0.1%) and Brent (+0.4%) are both in the green, with prices eyeing USD 67.00/bbl and USD 76.50/bbl to the upside respectively, with traders mindful of increases in US crude stocks as countries are importing less from Iran and storing most of what they import ahead of Iranian sanctions coming into effect at the start of November. Additionally, Saudi Arabia and Russia have agreed to extend their agreement to preserve oil market stability. Elsewhere, Sinopec and CNPC have not placed a November oil order from Iran due to concerns over how the sanctions will impact their global operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraq Oil Minister Ghadhban said Iraq will help maintain a fair price for producers and consumers, adding that Iraq will cooperate with OPEC members to stabilize oil market. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia and Russia have agreed to extend their agreement to preserve the oil markets stability; according to Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds currently trade in a 35 tick range thus far and sit just above 160.00 despite having reached levels not seen since September (160.35) earlier in the session. The rebound in equities led to a brief move back below 160.00 but was short-lived (low print 159.98) as markets await any further direction from the ECB; high print stands at 160.35 around Sep highs. Asides from looking for any greater clarity on how the Bank views economic risks to the Eurozone, FI markets will be awaiting any prospective announcements on reinvestment adjustments after Draghi revealed that the matter would be discussed at one of the meetings before the end of the year. Speculation over the past few months has touted the idea of a Fed-esque &lsquo;operation twist&rsquo; adjustment. However, HSBC are &ldquo;of the view that any formal announcement in that direction is unlikely&rdquo; with the ECB more inclined to adopt a more flexible approach to bond purchases. In the periphery, BTPs are faring better with IT/GE spread tighter by around 10bps with policymakers in Italy remaining optimistic that the spread will continue to narrow as the markets accepts its plan despite the populist government refusing to giver ground to the EU. Elsewhere, USTs trade little changed after prices met resistance at 118.27+ overnight, of note, some commentators highlighted overnight treasury option flow which was indicative of purchases potentially looking for a break through YTD highs in the US 10yr yield. Finally, Gilts also little changed with UK paper more likely to take direction from any Brexit-related commentary which is currently tying the hands of the MPC ahead of next week&rsquo;s QIR.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PRIMER: CBRT Rate Decision to be published at 1200 BST on Thursday 25 October 2018",
        "content": "<p>The consensus expects the Turkish Central Bank to maintain its Repo Rate at 24.00%. The TRY has appreciated after the Turkish authorities took action to de-escalate tensions with the US, as well as the announcement of a fiscal plan to improve public finances; however, the inflation situation still remains a concern, after September CPI jumped from 17.9% to 24.5%. &quot;The Taylor Rule tells us that rates should be hiked to 36.3% based on these numbers. Core inflation at 24% suggests only slightly lower rates at 35.6%. Whichever view one prefers, with CPI expected to rise in the coming months, the level of interest rates remains too low,&quot; TD Securities writes. But TD observes that the central bank has been lifting rates this year in response to currency weakness, not after bad inflation prints. And, therefore, given the recent appreciation of the currency, TD suggests that the CBRT will not feel compelled to pre-empt any further rises in CPI, most likely opting to hold rates. In terms of the market reaction, TD believes the USDTRY pair will remain relatively unchanged if the central bank leaves rates unchanged, but delivers convincing hawkish language of tightening to come as we are looking for could lead to a knee-jerk moves of between 0.5% and 1.0% while the market digests the details of the announcement. And in terms of risks, &quot;a surprise hike could push USDTRY 1-3% lower, depending on its magnitude,&quot; TD says, &quot;while a hold accompanied by markedly less hawkish rhetoric would push USDTRY higher, with the 6.95/6.00handle back in sight.&quot;</p>\r\n",

Next up ECB rate announcement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are mixed in early trade despite the mass sell-off experienced overnight in Asia after the soured sentiment from US spilled over onto the region. Eurostoxx 50 (+0.2%) resurfaced after opening in the red while the SMI (-0.6%) failed to take advantage of the rebound as the index is pressured by shares in ABB (-3.9%) and Lonza (-3.0%) amid weak earnings. On the flip side, CAC (+0.6%) is buoyed as 75% of the index is in the green (with the top gainers fuelled by earnings), and Spain&rsquo;s IBEX (+0.8%) is lifted by banking names after Bankinter (+0.7%) reported inspiring earnings. In terms of sectors, telecom names lag along with healthcare while consumer discretionary and materials outperform. Moving onto individual movers, WPP (-15%) rests at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after cutting guidance, dragging Publicis (-5%) shares lower in sympathy, while AB InBev (-8.0%) shares are also trading with hefty losses amid disappointing earnings across all metrics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets have begun the session on a relatively tentative footing with most majors relatively unchanged thus far alongside a broadly flat DXY which remains contained by its recent 96.00 to 96.50 range.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European markets await updates from the ECB with EUR/USD contained by offers around 1.1420-25 with analysts also flagging 1.1bln in option expiries for the pair between 1.1420-30. Focus for the ECB release today will likely centre around the Bank&rsquo;s view on risks to the Eurozone&rsquo;s economic outlook and whether risks will continue to be viewed as &lsquo;balanced&rsquo; or &lsquo;tilted to the downside&rsquo;; expectations for any material adjustments to the ECB&rsquo;s forward guidance are relatively low.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, GBP has seen little in the way of material price action as GBP/USD straddles the 1.2900 handle (note, 627mln expiry Friday) as political jitters keep any potential moves to the upside contained for now with Lloyds touting the possibility that daily momentum suggest the pair could extend recent losses towards 1.2800. May appears to have survived any potential catastrophic fallout from yesterday&rsquo;s 1922 Committee meeting but intra-party tensions remain a threat to the Brexit process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus during Asia-Pac trade continues to focus on the seemingly one-way moves in USD/CNY with CNY posting its weakest close vs. USD since Jan 3rd 2017. Commentary continuing to speculate over what action (if any the PBoC) will take against defending the 7.00 barrier with this week&rsquo;s measures taken by policymakers unable to reassure markets against the threat of trade conflict from the US. Elsewhere for Asia-Pac currencies, USD/JPY managed to reclaim 112.00 to the upside overnight with some suggestions of selling fatigue, that said, the current stock market rout could lead any optimism to be relatively short-lived; UBS recommends selling rallies between 112.25-35. Notable option expiries for USD/JPY includes 1.3bln at 112.00-10, 815mln at 111.75-85 and 1.7bln at 112.50-60.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s first central bank meeting saw the Norges bank stick to the script laid out in September and continue to view Q1 2019 as their next opportunity to lift rates with the Bank&rsquo;s economic assessment broadly unchanged from the prior release. NOK gained some modest ground against the EUR with the NB looking through growth concerns; EUR/NOK is now back towards 9.50.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have traded in a relatively contained 26 tick range thus far above the 160.00 handle as markets await any further direction from the ECB; high print stands at 160.35 around Sep highs. Asides from looking for any greater clarity on how the Bank views economic risks to the Eurozone, FI markets will be awaiting any prospective announcements on reinvestment adjustments after Draghi revealed that the matter would be discussed at one of the meetings before the end of the year. Speculation over the past few months has touted the idea of a Fed-esque &lsquo;operation twist&rsquo; adjustment. However, HSBC are &ldquo;of the view that any formal announcement in that direction is unlikely&rdquo; with the ECB more inclined to adopt a more flexible approach to bond purchases. In the periphery BTPs faring better with IT/GE spread modestly tighter by around 5bps with policymakers in Italy remaining optimistic that the spread will continue to narrow as the markets accepts its plan. Speculation continues to mount over whether Italy wants Russia to purchase domestic debt; something which Salvini has denied in the wake of PM Conte&rsquo;s meeting with Putin yesterday. Elsewhere, USTs trade little changed after prices met resistance at 118.27+ overnight, of note, some commentators highlighted overnight treasury option flow which was indicative of purchases potentially looking for a break through YTD highs in the US 10yr yield. Finally, Gilts also little changed with UK paper more likely to take direction from any Brexit-related commentary which is currently tying the hands of the MPC ahead of next week&rsquo;s QIR.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is trading flat at around USD 1232/oz, following the overnight equity sell off in Asia where the yellow metal rose to session highs of as investor sought a safe haven, but has since come off highs. Copper prices have again fallen for the third day in a row, reaching a two-week low as the red metal tracked overnight sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over in the oil complex, WTI (-0.1%) and Brent (+0.1%) are both little changed, with prices currently hovering above USD 66.5/bbl and USD 76/bbl respectively; with traders mindful of increases in US crude stocks as countries are importing less from Iran and storing most of what they import ahead of Iranian sanctions coming into effect at the start of November. Additionally, Saudi Arabia and Russia have agreed to extend their agreement to preserve oil market stability. Elsewhere, Sinopec and CNPC have not placed a November oil order from Iran due to concerns over how the sanctions will impact their global operation.</p>\r\n",

Focus for the ECB release today will likely centre around the Bank&rsquo;s view on risks to the Eurozone&rsquo;s economic outlook and whether risks will continue to be viewed as &lsquo;balanced&rsquo; or &lsquo;tilted to the downside&rsquo;; expectations for any material adjustments to the ECB&rsquo;s forward guidance are relatively low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, GBP has seen little in the way of material price action as GBP/USD straddles the 1.2900 handle (note, 627mln expiry Friday) as political jitters keep any potential moves to the upside contained for now with Lloyds touting the possibility that daily momentum suggest the pair could extend recent losses towards 1.2800. May appears to have survived any potential catastrophic fallout from yesterday&rsquo;s 1922 Committee meeting but intra-party tensions remain a threat to the Brexit process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus during Asia-Pac trade continues to focus on the seemingly one-way moves in USD/CNY with the pair hitting its highest level in around 21-months overnight with commentary continuing to speculate over what action (if any the PBoC) will take against defending the 7.00 barrier. Elsewhere for Asia-Pac currencies, USD/JPY managed to reclaim 112.00 to the upside overnight with some suggestions of selling fatigue, that said, the current stock market rout could lead any optimism to be relatively short-lived; UBS recommends selling rallies between 112.25-35. Notable option expiries for USD/JPY includes 1.3bln at 112.00-10, 815mln at 111.75-85 and 1.7bln at 112.50-60.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s first central bank meeting saw the Norges bank stick to the script laid out in September and continue to view Q1 2019 as their next opportunity to lift rates with the Bank&rsquo;s economic assessment broadly unchanged from the prior release. NOK gained some modest ground against the EUR with the NB looking through growth concerns; EUR/NOK is now back towards 9.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overnight FX price action was predominantly a slight pull-back of the prior day&rsquo;s risk-averse driven moves in which the DXY marginally pared the recent safe-haven flows which helped EUR/USD reclaim the 1.1400 handle, while GBP/USD sat below 1.2900 amid the continued lack of Brexit-related progress. Elsewhere, USD/JPY initially extended on its retreat to briefly below 112.00 where it found support amid touted selling fatigue and Gotobi demand, while antipodeans also attempted to partially nurse recent losses.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities trade reflected the risk-averse tone in which WTI crude futures held near the prior day&rsquo;s lows and in proximity to retest USD 66.00/bbl to the downside. Copper prices extended on losses with demand subdued by the widespread stock sell-off, while gold bucked the trend with the precious metal underpinned by safe-haven demand.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bias was towards lower yields as equities saw another red day; although yields fell by between 2-6bps across the curve, major curve spreads were mixed, and with bull-steepening observed. The Treasury 5-year auction saw a tail of 0.6bps, with some desks noting that the lack of concession and the larger auction size was a negative. The internals were grim, with dealer participation rising sharply, and direct bidder participation collapsing &ndash; similar to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 2-year paper. US T-note futures (Z8) settle 11+ ticks higher at 118-20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Beige Book stated that US manufacturers reported higher prices as tariffs pushed up the costs of raw materials and that consumer spending increased at a modest pace, while inflation ranged from modest to moderate. Several Fed districts also reported that firms faced rising materials and shipping costs, as well as uncertainties over trade and difficulty finding qualified workers. Furthermore, the Beige Book noted the US economy expanded and that most districts reported modest to moderate growth. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Mester (Voter, Hawk) said a prolonged market downturn and build up in risks would affect US economic data and added she is not adjusting her policy stance based on the recent market drop. Furthermore, Mester said inflation expectations have been very stable and that the Fed will not overreact to temporary moves in inflation, while she also suggested Fed is getting closer to &quot;neutral&quot; policy and are more sensitive to incoming data. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bostic (Voter, dove) said the Fed is of the mind to let the economy stand on its own and that the US economy is chugging along quite well. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (-2.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-3.3%) slumped from the open amid heavy pressure in tech and with losses in Japan magnified by a firmer currency, while corporate updates failed to provide any reprieve as Sharp shares slumped following a cut in its revenue forecasts. Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%) and Hang Seng (-1.8%) also saw firm losses with Cathay Pacific shares descending on reports of a data breach that could affect around 9.4mln passengers, although losses in the mainland were to a somewhat lesser extent amid further liquidity efforts by the PBoC and continued supportive rhetoric by Chinese agencies. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked upside in T-notes and with demand underpinned as the stock sell-off spurred a flight to quality.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (-2.0%) and Nikkei 225 (-3.0%) slumped from the open amid heavy pressure in tech and with losses in Japan magnified by a firmer currency, while corporate updates failed to provide any reprieve as Sharp shares slumped following a cut in its revenue forecasts. Shanghai Comp. (-1.6%) and Hang Seng (-2.2%) also saw firm losses with Cathay Pacific shares descending on reports of a data breach that could affect around 9.4mln passengers, although losses in the mainland are to a somewhat lesser extent amid further liquidity efforts by the PBoC and continued supportive rhetoric by Chinese agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overnight FX price action has predominantly been some moderation in the prior day&rsquo;s risk-averse driven moves with the DXY marginally pulling back from the recent safe-haven flows, which has helped EUR/USD reclaim the 1.1400 handle while GBP/USD sits below 1.2900 amid the continued lack of Brexit-related progress. Elsewhere, USD/JPY initially extended on its retreat to briefly below 112.00 but has since found a base amid touted selling fatigue and Gotobi demand, while antipodeans also attempted to partially nurse recent losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track upside in T-notes and with demand underpinned as the stock sell-off spurred a flight to quality.</p>\r\n",
