The Fed stated that the outlook has strengthened, although also added that activity has been rising at a &ldquo;moderate rate&rdquo; which was a slight downgrade from the previous assessment where it has been judged solid. In the post meeting press conference, Fed Chair Powell struck a balanced tone revealing little by way of new information and reiterated the Fed data-dependent stance.

Lighthizer confirmed NAFTA partners were converging on autos after the US dropped auto-content proposal in NAFTA discussions last week, which would have demanded vehicle imports to the US from Mexico and Canada should consist of 50% content from US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian PM Trudeau said a successful NAFTA deal is likely, while there were also comments from Canada&rsquo;s Unifor union head that US NAFTA negotiators have dropped demand for 50% US content in vehicles produced in member nations.

(Newswires)<br />US crude production rose 26k to 10.407mln bpd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DOE crude inventory figures showed a draw of 2.622mln &ndash; against expectations of a build &ndash; helping crude prices bounce higher. The narrative over the last couple of sessions has moved away from oversupply concerns, towards tensions in the middle east between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and curtailed Venezuelan output. Following on from this week&rsquo;s reports that OPEC is looking to shift its targets towards average inventory levels, rather than the level of output cuts, the cartel today said that commercial oil stocks are now 44mln bbls above the 5-year average. And elsewhere, OPEC/non-OPEC technical committee sees compliance with oil output cuts in February at 138%, the highest level yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Informal talks between North Korea, South Korea and the US have finished with delegates discussing the talks as &quot;constructive&quot; and taking place in a &quot;positive atmosphere&quot;.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer that the US will take countermeasures if there is retaliation on agriculture products from China, while Lighthizer also commented that he hopes to complete tariffs exemptions by end of April and that the countries likely to be exempted from tariffs are NAFTA partners, South Korea, EU, Argentina and Brazil. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity indices were choppy after the FOMC&rsquo;s rate decision and continued to trade erratically through the press conference. Ultimately, however, the net result was that the Emini, mini Dow and mini Nasdaq ended the press conference around the levels that it entered the rate decision, as traders struggle to digest the exact meaning from the FOMC. Equity traders seem to have settled on the narrative that conditions will remain accommodative, and the normalisation process will be gradual. Financials performed well as the FOMC rate path projection rose from 5 to 6 hikes through 2019 due to their sensitivity to interest rates. Away from the Fed, energy led gains after a bullish DOE report buoyed the sector. Consumer staples underperformed today being led by General Mills (GIS) following weak FY guidance in its earnings report, which also weighed on competitors like Kellogg&rsquo;s (K), Conagra Brands (CAG) and JM Smucker (SJM); with the 4 companies closing the day as some of the largest underperformers. SPX -0.10% at 2714, DJI -0.07% at 24702 and NDX -0.42% at 6854.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries endured a rollercoaster ride through the FOMC today ultimately however there was little by way of new information and while 2s5s saw a knee jerk steepening the steepness pared back through the course of the press conference settling the day relatively unchanged at 61bp. 5s30s did see some knee jerk flattening but like other major curve spreads moves were pared back leave the 5s30s spread unchanged for the session at 159bp. 10year T-notes settled down 4+ ticks at 119-30+.</p>\r\n",

Consumer staples underperformed today being led by General Mills (GIS) following weak FY guidance in its earnings report, which also weighed on competitors like Kellogg&rsquo;s (K), Conagra Brands (CAG) and JM Smucker (SJM); with the 4 companies closing the day as some of the largest underperformers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong>Treasuries endured a rollercoaster ride through the FOMC today ultimately however there was little by way of new information and while 2s5s saw a knee jerk steepening the steepness pared back through the course of the press conference settling the day relatively unchanged at 61bp. 5s30s did see some knee jerk flattening but like other major curve spreads moves were pared back leave the 5s30s spread unchanged for the session at 159bp. 10 YEAR T-NOTE SETTLED DOWN 4+ TICKS AT 119-30+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:&nbsp;</strong>After treading water ahead of the FOMC rate decision USD was subjected to 2-way action after the rate decision and during the press conference as trader digested on one hand a steeper rate trajectory in 2019/2020 though remained unchanged for 2018, ultimately, the market chose to latch on to the dovish aspects of the decision/press conference with USDEUR rising to 1.2340. GBP was a beneficiary of USD weakness rising back above 1.41 where it has found resistance around 1.4150 the JPY resumes its course of strengthening &ndash; despite EURJPY catching a strong bid ahead of the Fed &ndash; USDJPY fell below the 106 handle heading into ASIAPAC. Commodity FX was stronger on the session helped by a bullish DoE inventory report as well as the USD weakness. EMFX also found strength against the USD and continued strengthening after the decision. CAD also continued the strength seen overnight after Lighthizer confirmed NAFTA partners were converging on autos after the US dropped auto-content proposal in NAFTA discussions last week, which would have demanded vehicle imports to the US from Mexico and Canada should consist of 50% content from US</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI (May) crude futures settle up USD 1.63 at USD 65.17; Brent (May) crude May futures settle up $2.05 at $69.47. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* DOE crude inventory figures showed a draw of 2.622mln &ndash; against expectations of a build &ndash; helping crude prices bounce higher. The narrative over the last couple of sessions has moved away from oversupply concerns, towards tensions in the middle east between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and curtailed Venezuelan output. Following on from this week&rsquo;s reports that OPEC is looking to shift its targets towards average inventory levels, rather than the level of output cuts, the cartel today said that commercial oil stocks are now 44mln bbls above the 5-year average. And elsewhere, OPEC/non-OPEC technical committee sees compliance with oil output cuts in February at 138%, the highest level yet.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The Loonie leap-frogged Sterling amidst more bullish NAFTA noises to reclaim top G10 spot in the run up to the FOMC, and Usd/Cad continued its retracement from year to date highs as a result. The psychological 1.3000 level took some effort to breach, as layers of bids/support at 1.2980 and 1.2960, but the pair is now testing the 1.2950 area. There was a brief bounce on a bigger than expected rebound in US exiting home sales, but the next independent driver for the Greenback will come from the Fed via the SEP, dot plots and tone of new Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s first post-meeting presser. Meanwhile, Cable got close to weekly highs just ahead of 1.4100 with the aid of stronger UK wage data and some jobs components, which could prompt some of the more hawkish BoE voters to declare intentions if not their hand on Thursday. The Chf and Eur are vying for 3<sup>rd</sup> place among majors, with the former up to 0.9520 vs the Usd and close to 1.1700 vs the single currency amidst talk of a large Franc buy order. Eur/Usd hugged the top of a 1.2240-95 range and near extremely large option expiries (1.4 bn at the 1.2280 strike for example), and Usd/Jpy also drifted back towards big expiries (3 bn+ at 106.00) from a peak around 106.50, but with a fair degree of safe-haven positioning after reports that China is preparing to retaliate against US plans to impose import tariffs. However, the Aud held around 0.7700 vs its US counterpart with promise of exemptions from the US steel and aluminium taxes in contrast to its Nzd antipodean peer that saw more selling/underperformance and a decline through 0.7180 chart support to test 0.7150 at one stage on the likelihood that the RBNZ will not be anywhere near as hawkish as the FOMC might or is seen to be. Note, options see a 70 pip break even on the 2 Central Bank events. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The utilities sector is boosted following upgrades of Italy&rsquo;s A2A (+2.3%) and Germany&rsquo;s E.ON (+1.9%) by Kepler Chevreux. The FTSE 100 is weighed on by a firmer sterling. Simultaneously, UK retailers are taking a hit amid signs of consumer spending downturn; Moss Bros (-19.8%) crashing after the issue of a profit warning. Carpetright (-0.3%) has taken a loan from a significant shareholder to cover short-term capital requirements, Kingfisher (-6.8%) amongst the laggards following the Co. reporting a fall in earnings and expressing concerns on the outlook for the retail sector, warning that the UK market is tough. On the flip side, LSE (+0.9%) is at the top of the FTSE 100 amid talks that the 21-month Brexit transition deal agreed this week could prompt Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) of the US to make another bid approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound has jumped to the top of the G10 pile on above consensus (and CPI) UK earnings, the lowest unemployment rate since 1975 and a much bigger than expected rise in employment. In truth, the Gbp was already firmer back above 1.4000 vs a broadly softer Usd, but Cable climbed further towards Monday&rsquo;s post-Brexit transition deal peak of 1.4088 to around 1.4075. Eur/Gbp retreated to the lower end of its 0.8760-25 range and 0.8700 support despite Eur/Usd rebounding from circa 1.2240 lows to just shy of 1.2300 before fading against the backdrop of mega expiry option interest between 1.2250-80 (total of 3.7 bn). The Greenback has handed back a chunk of yesterday&rsquo;s net gains, and market contacts note a big drop in Usd/Chf that seemed order-based as the pair fell from highs near 0.9565 to 0.9520 or thereabouts, with Eur/Chf down around 1.1700 from 1.1750+ recent highs. However, the DXY is back near 90.000 from 90.400 at best with Usd/Cad retreating further from 1.3100+ to just above 1.3000 on reports that the US has softened its stance on autos in latest NAFTA talks, which also boosted the Peso (Usd/Mxn sub-18.6000 at one stage). Usd/Jpy trapped in tight 106.55-25 parameters and trade impacted by a Japanese holiday on top of typical pre-Fed caution, but the Kiwi continuing to underperform and in danger of triggering stops said to be situated at 0.7170 and 0.7150 ahead of the RBNZ that is expected to remain neutral if not dovish compared to the FOMC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No surprise to see renewed selling across the UK rates space on the back of forecast beating wages and other elements of the latest jobs data showing further strength, with Gilts now down through 121.00 at 120.84 (-51 ticks) and Short Sterling futures as much as 8 ticks adrift. Certainly, fuel for the BoE hawks ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s rate verdict and of course another uptick in May hike probability. Bunds also creeping lower again, but incrementally, to 157.82 (-24 ticks) so far.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI (+0.4%), and Brent Crude (+0.5%) are extending gains fuelled by Middle East tensions, and a fall in Venezuelan oil output, the 6th largest OPEC oil producer. Yesterday&rsquo;s API weekly inventories printed a surprise draw, providing additional support to the bullish oil movements. Looking at metals, gold (+0.3%) has edged higher having held above the key 1300 level.

The utilities sector is boosted following upgrades of Italy&rsquo;s A2A (+2.3%) and Germany&rsquo;s E.ON (+1.9%) by Kepler Chevreux. The FTSE 100 is weighed on by a firmer sterling. Simultaneously, UK retailers are taking a hit amid signs of consumer spending downturn; Moss Bros (-19.8%) crashing after the issue of a profit warning. Carpetright (-0.3%) has taken a loan from a significant shareholder to cover short-term capital requirements, Kingfisher (-6.8%) amongst the laggards following the Co. reporting a fall in earnings and expressing concerns on the outlook for the retail sector, warning that the UK market is tough. On the flip side, LSE (+0.9%) is at the top of the FTSE 100 amid talks that the 21-month Brexit transition deal agreed this week could prompt Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) of the US to make another bid approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound has jumped to the top of the G10 pile on above consensus (and CPI) UK earnings, the lowest unemployment rate since 1975 and a much bigger than expected rise in employment. In truth, the Gbp was already firmer back above 1.4000 vs a broadly softer Usd, but Cable climbed further towards Monday&rsquo;s post-Brexit transition deal peak of 1.4088 to around 1.4075. Eur/Gbp retreated to the lower end of its 0.8760-25 range and 0.8700 support despite Eur/Usd rebounding from circa 1.2240 lows to just shy of 1.2300 before fading against the backdrop of mega expiry option interest between 1.2250-80 (total of 3.7 bn). The Greenback has handed back a chunk of yesterday&rsquo;s net gains, and market contacts note a big drop in Usd/Chf that seemed order-based as the pair fell from highs near 0.9565 to 0.9520 or thereabouts, with Eur/Chf down around 1.1700 from 1.1750+ recent highs. However, the DXY is back near 90.000 from 90.400 at best with Usd/Cad retreating further from 1.3100+ to just above 1.3000 on reports that the US has softened its stance on autos in latest NAFTA talks, which also boosted the Peso (Usd/Mxn sub-18.6000 at one stage). Usd/Jpy trapped in tight 106.55-25 parameters and trade impacted by a Japanese holiday on top of typical pre-Fed caution, but the Kiwi continuing to underperform and in danger of triggering stops said to be situated at 0.7170 and 0.7150 ahead of the RBNZ that is expected to remain neutral if not dovish compared to the FOMC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No surprise to see renewed selling across the UK rates space on the back of forecast beating wages and other elements of the latest jobs data showing further strength, with Gilts now down through 121.00 at 120.84 (-51 ticks) and Short Sterling futures as much as 8 ticks adrift. Certainly, fuel for the BoE hawks ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s rate verdict and of course another uptick in May hike probability.

Similarly, 3 month contracts were containing losses to just a tick for a while, but have been as much as 5 ticks underwater more recently. It remains highly uncertain whether the FOMC ratchets up rate guidance beyond the 3 hikes currently pencilled in for this year, but the BoE may be emboldened enough by Brexit developments to signal more policy normalisation and underpin market expectations for a &frac14; point rise in May. Yesterday&rsquo;s softer than expected inflation data could keep MPC hawks at bay, but any sign of wages picking up pace today may offset and on that note the latest IHS Markit survey suggests that household incomes are at post-GFC highs. Labour/earnings aside, public sector finances are also on show, but perhaps the biggest market-mover on the domestic front looms from Brussels and EU member states that are due air reservations about the preliminary transition &lsquo;deal&rsquo; (news may be forthcoming on this front from midday). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.2%) and KOSPI (+0.2%) are marginally positive with Australia&rsquo;s energy sector tracking the outperformance seen in its US counterparts, although gains were contained approaching today&rsquo;s FOMC and with Japan closed for Vernal Equinox national holiday. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) outperform the region as focus turns to earnings with the top performers in Hong Kong spurred by recent financial results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, CAD and MXN are the biggest overnight movers with the currencies lifted on news that the US dropped contentious auto-content proposal in NAFTA discussions. Elsewhere, the rest of currency markets were uneventful ahead of the upcoming Fed decision and dot-plot projections, with EUR/USD faintly attempting to nurse losses and with GBP/USD just about holding on to the 1.4000 handle after the prior day&rsquo;s CPI miss, while USD/JPY is also relatively unchanged amid the absence of market participants in Japan.</p>\r\n",
