There was some weakness at the cash open, following in the vein of Tuesday trade. But in later trade, there was upside, helping the Emini push above 2640 temporarily, though a batch of headlines regarding AG Sessions brought some caution once again, and indices slipped back into ranges. Pre-market earnings from Boeing (BA) managed to support the Mini Dow, but the gains struggled to hold, and the selling overpowered the strong earnings from the largest Dow component. Stock specifics, the SPX was led by Norfolk Southern (NSC) beating on both the top and bottom end, also supported by comments of a promising outlook and raising the annual repurchase programme by USD 1.5bln. Hampering the SPX on Wednesday Trade, Trade Advisor (TRVG) underperforming following earnings from competitor Trivago (TRGO) who lowered its next forecasts. NDX was led by Texas Instrumentals (TXN) following strong earnings and guidance, which then led to a string of price target increases from names like Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. The other end of the scale, saw Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Checkpoint Software (CHKP). WYNN was led lower following weaker than expected revenue from Wynn Macau, and CHKP weaker as it trimmed its 2018 outlook, which saw Deutsche, Morgan Stanley and Cowen, trim company price targets also. DJI the outperformer of the trio boosted by strong Boeing (BA) earnings as it equates to roughly 10% of the index, however General Electric (GE) limiting the gains as the largest underperformer today as its first annual shareholder meeting went underway, where it was met with protests from both employees and shareholders about recent underperformance, where shareholders called for an ousting of some directors, and voted for a smaller board with three new members, and also voted down six proposals from shareholders. In M&amp;A news, the narrative continued for Shire (SHPG) after confirmation it received a revised offer from Takeda for USD 30.30/shr. Sources suggested after market yesterday, a preliminary announcement for the USD 65bln deal was expected today, but nothing was seen, further GSK ruled out purchasing the pharmaceutical name. Also, Comcast (CMCSA) made a superior cash offer for Sky (SKY LN), implying a value of GBP 22.0bln. Later, Sky (SKY LN) told holders to take no action regarding the offer; Sky are withdrawing their recommendation for the 21st Century Fox (FOX) offer. On smaller scale M&amp;A sources voiced that Kroger (KR) is considering a bid for Supervalu (SVU), but this was unconfirmed, elsewhere Promedica, Welltower (WELL) are in a bid to acquire Quality Care Properties (QCP) for around USD 20/shr.

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: </strong>Stocks higher, USD higher, treasuries lower, oil higher.<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW: </strong>Boeing earnings, Turkey interest rate decision, US not looking to renegotiate/reopen JCPOA.<br /><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>after-market; BoC&rsquo;s Poloz; Visa, Facebook earnings. Thursday; ECB, Riksbank rate decisions, earnings from Amazon, Microsoft, AbbVie, Intel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*GEOPOLITICAL:</strong> A US official said that the agenda for the 24th April NAFTA meeting includes financial burden sharing, and ahead of Germany Chancellor Merkel&rsquo;s visit to the US on Friday, the US official singled-out the nation for &ldquo;financial burden sharing&rdquo; on defence. Elsewhere, the official said other topics will include Syria, and &ldquo;Russian aggression.&rdquo; The official dodged a question on whether the likely next US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be in attendance. Latest on Iran, the US Non- Proliferation Envoy Ford said the US is not looking to reopen or renegotiate the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action Iran deal, but a supplementary agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*TRADE WARS:</strong> On the NAFTA front newsflow was thin, however updates came from Canada Foreign Minister Freeland who expects more negotiations on NAFTA auto rules to take place later on Wednesday. She also repeated that Canada expects to have permanent exemptions from US steel and aluminium tariff and highlighted the issue over tariffs is separate from NAFTA tall the US position is currently unclear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*ECB SPEAK:</strong> Attention is on tomorrow&rsquo;s ECB meeting (<a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19042/download\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\">full preview here</a>)<strong>.</strong> The central bank is unanimously expected to leave its <strong>three key rates unchanged</strong>. Ultimately, this week&rsquo;s press conference is set to offer little in the way of fireworks with June/July touted as a more opportune time for the ECB to unveil their next stage of major policy announcements. Draghi will likely make some reference to the recent softness in data but ultimately maintain that risks to economic growth are &lsquo;broadly balanced.

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>EXPECTATIONS: </strong>The central bank is expected to keep the repo rate unchanged at 0.50% on Thursday. TD Securities argues that the market is pricing a dovish outcome at the April meeting, with focus falling mostly on what will be said on the size of its first rate hike, which has not been subject of public discussions yet. Some are expecting the Riksbank to tweak its current guidance after weakness in recent inflation data, which only hinted at mild price pressures building in the economy.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>INFLATION: </strong>in Q1, the central bank had pencilled in a rate of inflation around 1.7%, but the Q1 data came in at 1.5% in January, and remained at that level. Growth forecasts may also be revised lower, as business surveys continued to indicate softer economic conditions with a 7% drop in house prices in the March-August period weighing on the narrative.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>OUTLOOK: </strong>Analysts at Capital Economics are confident that rate rises will still be forthcoming in 2018: &ldquo;The Riksbank&rsquo;s previous guidance was consistent with either two interest rate increases of around 10bps in July and September or a 25bp rise in September,&rdquo; CapEco says. Analysts at Nordea, however, sees the first-rate hike coming slightly later (in Q4 2019) and expects the repo rate to be at -0.25% by the end of 2019, and argue that the Riksbank will most likely move in synchronisation with the ECB.&nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li><strong>MARKET REACTION: </strong>The Riskbank&rsquo;s previous forecasts were based on the krona being relatively unchanged, however, since the last meeting (14/Feb) it has weakened, with EURSEK moving from 9.9042 to around 10.42). Barclays believes that if the Riksbank kept the rate path unchanged, it would signal some normalisation in H2 2018, and that give some support to the SEK. TD Securities suggests that a dovish market reaction will likely be seen if the Riksbank hinted at initial rate hikes between 10-12bps, while a more hawkish response would come in the event of a 25bps rate hikes signal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) and KOSPI (-0.6%) were lower with participants also digesting earnings releases, while Takeda was among the worst performers in Japan after the Co. further sweetened its offer in pursuit of Shire. ASX and NZX were shut for ANZAC Day, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (-1.0%) conformed to the downbeat tone after the PBoC skipped open market operations which resulted to a net daily drain of CNY 150bln, However, the losses in the mainland were contained amid continued chatter regarding further RRR cuts and as the previously announced cut took effect from today. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful and have failed to benefit from the broad risk averse tone as well as the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 710bln in the belly to super-long end, while USTs were choppy overnight with early pressure seen after the US 10yr yield continued to test the 3.000% level which it had earlier reclaimed for the 1st time since January 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China researcher noted that deflation in China is possible as soon as Q4 this year and added that further reductions in RRR are expected, while there were also reports that a Chinese official sees large room for RRR reductions and sees it lowered by between 600-800bps in 3 years. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net drain of CNY 150bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3066 (Prev. 6.3229) (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Vasiliauskas (Hawkish) is more confident that it is time to &#39;transition&#39; from QE, adds closure of bond buying should not be abrupt. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Mersch (Hawkish) says that his confidence on inflation has moved higher recently. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU is said to be ready to offer UK a better trade deal if it chooses to remain in the customs union, according to an EU official. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK&#39;s Brexit Minister Davis says he does not expect an extension of the customs union. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada&#39;s Foreign Minister Freeland said they are in intensive NAFTA talks and noted good progress is being made on autos but the issue is complex. Freeland also commented after meeting with US Trade Representative Lighthizer that creative ideas by the US in regards to autos has helped progress discussions, while she added discussions will continue on Wednesday and that they are ready to respond to fresh proposals. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are seeing a lacklustre start following on from the sentiment seen yesterday on Wall Street and overnight during Asia-Pac trade. In terms of stock specifics, Shire (+0.2%) shares have been supported after recommending Takeda&rsquo;s revised GBP 46bln takeover offer to its shareholders. In the earnings scope, markets have seen positive results from Kering, (6.4%) and Credit Suisse (+3.3%) with negative reports from Mediaset (-0.8%). Significant news later in the session from Comcast (CMCSA) whom make a superior cash offer for Sky (SKY LN), implying a value of GBP 22.0bln</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback continues to piggy-back rising US Treasury yields after a relatively brief pause for breath as bond bears and bulls tussled for supremacy around the 3% mark in 10s. A more decisive break above has given the Dollar further impetus and the index has reclaimed 91.000+ status as a result, with fair resistance around 91.526 back on the radar ahead of 91.751 and a few more upside chart levels before early 2018 highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both extending recent losses vs the Usd and now clearly down through round number supports (0.7600 and 0.7100 respectively), albeit with the markets bereft of depth in terms of volume and potential local dip-buyers given the ANZAC market holiday. However, the cross is back up near 1.0700 again to the relative benefit of the Aud over the Kiwi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The renowned safe-havens are not deriving any real support, or much from the latest decline in global equity markets against the more compelling Usd ascent, mainly on the aforementioned ratchet up in US rates, but also perhaps amidst some early month-end positioning as rebalancing models point to net Dollar demand. Eur/Usd is pivoting 1.2200 where huge option expiries roll off on ECB day tomorrow (3+ bn), with Fib support around 1.2173 still underpinning the pair, but the upside capped ahead of 1.2250. Usd/Jpy has carved out a fresh multi-month top circa 109.25 after a brief dip below 109.00 and is back above the 100 DMA at 108.98 eyeing offers at 109.50 before a major fib at 109.65. Usd/Chf remains above 0.9800 and Eur/Chf is rebounding towards 1.2000 again with the Franc hardly helped by a sharp deterioration in ZEW&rsquo;s Swiss Investor Sentiment index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding up better than major counterparts, though still weaker vs the Usd as Cable straddles 1.3950 and the Loonie 1.2850. Some independent positives for the Pound and Cad via latest Brexit and NAFTA reports indicating progress towards deals on transition and tri-party trade deals.&nbsp; Note, BoC&rsquo;s Poloz and Wilkins are due to speak later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some respite for core bonds, but not before bears pounced to push debt futures down to fresh lows, while UST yields climbed more convincingly above the round number levels that had been resisting further advances. Bunds and Gilts extended losses to 31 and 32 ticks respectively at 157.45 and 120.73, while the equivalent 10 year T-note only stopped half a tick below 119-00 level as the corresponding yield approached 3.02%. Charts are all flashing red for futures, with market contacts highlighting a break below Tuesday&rsquo;s base for the benchmark UST contract and potential stops targeting 118-29, then 118-15 and ultimately 117-27. For Bunds the next/nearest downside tech targets are 157.46-43, latter yesterday&rsquo;s Eurex low, while Gilt sellers have a couple of &lsquo;strong&rsquo; objectives in sight at 120.69 and 120.48.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In commodities, oil has pulled back from Q4 2014 highs and remains flat on the day as the bullish market was slowed by US inventories increasing by 1.1mln barrels as according to API and traders taking profits following highs hit on Tuesday. Gold is currently seen around five week lows amid currency effects and rising treasury yields. Aluminium also maintained its recent slide due to the aforementioned effects as well as the Rusal sanctions announcement on Monday, with a fall noted for the 5th session in a row.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libya&#39;s oil output at the Waha oil field said to be back up to 300k bpd.

        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are seeing a lacklustre start following on from the sentiment seen yesterday on Wall Street and overnight during Asia-Pac trade. The energy sector lags its peers following declining oil prices. In terms of stock specifics, Shire (-0.5%) shares have been supported after recommending Takeda&rsquo;s revised GBP 46bln takeover offer to its shareholders. In the earnings scope, markets have seen positive results from Kering, (6.4%) and&nbsp;Credit Suisse (+3.3%)) with negative reports from&nbsp;and Mediaset (-0.8%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In commodities, oil has pulled back from Q4 2014 highs and remains flat on the day as the bullish market was slowed by US inventories increasing by 1.1mln barrels as according to API and traders taking profits following highs hit on Tuesday. Gold is currently seen around five week lows amid currency effects and rising treasury yields. Aluminium also maintained its recent slide due to the aforementioned effects as well as the Rusal tariffs announcement on Monday, with a fall noted for the 5th session in a row</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback continues to piggy-back rising US Treasury yields after a relatively brief pause for breath as bond bears and bulls tussled for supremacy around the 3% mark in 10s. A more decisive break above has given the Dollar further impetus and the index has reclaimed 91.000+ status as a result, with fair resistance around 91.526 back on the radar ahead of 91.751 and a few more upside chart levels before early 2018 highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both extending recent losses vs the Usd and now clearly down through round number supports (0.7600 and 0.7100 respectively), albeit with the markets bereft of depth in terms of volume and potential local dip-buyers given the ANZAC market holiday. However, the cross is back up near 1.0700 again to the relative benefit of the Aud over the Kiwi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The renowned safe-havens are not deriving any real support, or much from the latest decline in global equity markets against the more compelling Usd ascent, mainly on the aforementioned ratchet up in US rates, but also perhaps amidst some early month-end positioning as rebalancing models point to net Dollar demand. Eur/Usd is pivoting 1.2200 where huge option expiries roll off on ECB day tomorrow (3+ bn), with Fib support around 1.2173 still underpinning the pair, but the upside capped ahead of 1.2250. Usd/Jpy has carved out a fresh multi-month top circa 109.25 after a brief dip below 109.00 and is back above the 100 DMA at 108.98 eyeing offers at 109.50 before a major fib at 109.65. Usd/Chf remains above 0.9800 and Eur/Chf is rebounding towards 1.2000 again with the Franc hardly helped by a sharp deterioration in ZEW&rsquo;s Swiss Investor Sentiment index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding up better than major counterparts, though still weaker vs the Usd as Cable straddles 1.3950 and the Loonie 1.2850. Some independent positives for the Pound and Cad via latest Brexit and NAFTA reports indicating progress towards deals on transition and tri-party trade deals.&nbsp; Note, BoC&rsquo;s Poloz and Wilkins are due to speak later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some respite for core bonds, but not before bears pounced to push debt futures down to fresh lows, while UST yields climbed more convincingly above the round number levels that had been resisting further advances. Bunds and Gilts extended losses to 31 and 32 ticks respectively at 157.45 and 120.73, while the equivalent 10 year T-note only stopped half a tick below 119-00 level as the corresponding yield approached 3.02%. Charts are all flashing red for futures, with market contacts highlighting a break below Tuesday&rsquo;s base for the benchmark UST contract and potential stops targeting 118-29, then 118-15 and ultimately 117-27. For Bunds the next/nearest downside tech targets are 157.46-43, latter yesterday&rsquo;s Eurex low, while Gilt sellers have a couple of &lsquo;strong&rsquo; objectives in sight at 120.69 and 120.48.</p>\r\n",

A more decisive break above has given the Dollar further impetus and the index has reclaimed 91.000+ status as a result, with fair resistance around 91.526 back on the radar ahead of 91.751 and a few more upside chart levels before early 2018 highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both extending recent losses vs the Usd and now clearly down through round number supports (0.7600 and 0.7100 respectively), albeit with the markets bereft of depth in terms of volume and potential local dip-buyers given the ANZAC market holiday. However, the cross is back up near 1.0700 again to the relative benefit of the Aud over the Kiwi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/JPY/CHF </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The renowned safe-havens are not deriving any real support, or much from the latest decline in global equity markets against the more compelling Usd ascent, mainly on the aforementioned ratchet up in US rates, but also perhaps amidst some early month-end positioning as rebalancing models point to net Dollar demand. Eur/Usd is pivoting 1.2200 where huge option expiries roll off on ECB day tomorrow (3+ bn), with Fib support around 1.2173 still underpinning the pair, but the upside capped ahead of 1.2250. Usd/Jpy has carved out a fresh multi-month top circa 109.25 after a brief dip below 109.00 and is back above the 100 DMA at 108.98 eyeing offers at 109.50 before a major fib at 109.65. Usd/Chf remains above 0.9800 and Eur/Chf is rebounding towards 1.2000 again with the Franc hardly helped by a sharp deterioration in ZEW&rsquo;s Swiss Investor Sentiment index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP/CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding up better than major counterparts, though still weaker vs the Usd as Cable straddles 1.3950 and the Loonie 1.2850. Some independent positives for the Pound and Cad via latest Brexit and NAFTA reports indicating progress towards deals on transition and tri-party trade deals.&nbsp; Note, BoC&rsquo;s Poloz and Wilkins are due to speak later.</p>\r\n",

A failure to hike the liquidity window&nbsp;rate on Wednesday would be taken negatively by the markets - we would expect USDTRY to move up by about 1%,&rdquo; TD says. Rabo, meanwhile, believes anything less than a 100bps hike would be insufficient to support TRY sentiment in the long term.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Traders were attributing the rise in yields to the notion that the Fed hikes will take an &lsquo;autopilot&rsquo; approach (as was hinted by the Fed&rsquo;s Williams over the weekend) as well as the increased size of issuance out of the US Treasury, which will auction a total of $113bln this week ($32bln 2-year notes on Tuesday; $35bln 5-year notes on Wednesday; $17bln 2-year FRN on Wednesday; $29bln 7-year notes on Thursday. Net supply is implied at $3.6bln given that $109.4bln maturing at the mid-month settlement. Analysts also note that over the next month, gross supply (including next week&rsquo;s auction of $73bln in 3s, 10s, 30s) is around $169bln, with large cashflows due, estimated around $208bln. Traders are also cognizant of the Q2 refunding announcement on 2/May, where the US Treasury may raise the size of auction issuance, according to some analysts. Today&rsquo;s auction of 2s saw a tail of 0.5bps, while the yield at auction was the highest since 2008. The internals weren&rsquo;t particularly bright, with cover beneath recent averages and direct takedown slightly higher than recent averages. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle unchanged at 119-10+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada&#39;s Foreign Minister Freeland said they are in intensive NAFTA talks and noted good progress is being made on autos but the issue is complex.

Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) and KOSPI (-1.0%) are lower with participants also digesting earnings releases, while Takeda is among the worst performers in Japan after the Co. had to further sweeten its offer in pursuit of Shire. Elsewhere, ASX and NZX were shut for ANZAC Day, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) and Hang Seng (-0.9%) conformed to the downbeat tone after the PBoC skipped open market operations which resulted to a net daily drain of CNY 150bln, although the losses in the mainland are contained as the previously announced RRR cuts take effect from today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action has been kept rangebound amid a lack of data releases and market closures in the region. Nonetheless, the greenback attempts to nurse some of the prior session&rsquo;s losses which saw a mild pullback in EUR/USD and GBP/USD, while USD/JPY momentarily reclaimed the 109.00 level. Elsewhere, AUD and NZD are subdued as participants stayed away for ANZAC Day with AUD/USD pressured after slipping below the 0.7600 handle, while NZD/USD tests 0.7100 to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful and have failed to benefit from the broad risk averse tone as well as the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 710bln in the belly to super-long end, while USTs were choppy overnight with early pressure seen after the US 10yr yield continued to test the 3.000% level which it had earlier reclaimed for the 1<sup>st</sup> time since January 2014.</p>\r\n",
