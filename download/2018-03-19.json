Monday&rsquo;s weakness was led by tech shares with Facebook (FB) down heavily after a data breach, and Apple (AAPL) weighing on the tech sector after reports that it plans to develop its own micro LED screens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD </strong>lower amid a risk-off tone, which saw flows into safe havens (though less so the T-Note). The DXY dropped beneath the 90-handle, closing below the 90 level as we head into APAC trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP </strong>saw strong moves after news that the UK had provisionally agreed a transition deal; however, the Irish border issue is still to be resolved. EU ministers will evaluate the situation on Friday before signing-off, which will allow the UK to move onto talks on a future relationship with the EU. Cable, rose past the key level of 1.4020, to a highs just beneath 1.41. Data ahead such as UK CPI on Tuesday will now be driving GBP following pound-positive Brexit news<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR </strong>ticked-up sharply after sources reported that the ECB is comfortable with the market pricing a first rate hike in Q2 2019 with the debate shifting towards the steepness of the rate path looking in to the future, as QE resoundingly being agreed to end this year. This led to stops being tripped through the 1.23 level and saw sustained EUR strength into market close, with the USDEUR knocking around 1.2350.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY </strong>saw overnight strengthening after poor approval stats for PM Abe amid the cronyism scandal. But USDJPY came off the overnight lows in European trade with the 106.20 level remaining a focus. Nevertheless, as the risk tone soured, USDJPY resumed declines, though the 1056.75 level provided support.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD </strong>caught a bid after positive comments from Canadian finance minister Morneau said NAFTA talks were making progress, and there is a consensus among partners to reach a deal quickly. USDCAD probed lower levels, though support around 1.3050 was strong.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong>10 YEAR T-NOTE FUTURES (JUNE 2018) SETTLES UP 1+ TICKS AT 120-12+.<strong> </strong>Ahead of FOMC, the fixed income was taking its cue from the risk-tone. The T-Note was taking its lead from the Bund in early US trade, heading south after hawkish ECB sources. However, after touching 120-02, the T-Note began to find buyers, rising towards 120-16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Crude </strong>saw a large fall after the US open on risk-off tone of trade. Those losses were pared back, with some suggesting that this on reports that the US was exploring sanctions on Venezuelan oil. Elsewhere JODI reported Saudi oil exports increased Saudi oil exports from 7.045mln bpd to 7.170mln bpd adding to the over-supply narrative. We also had OPEC Secretary General Barkindo stating that the worst in the oil market is over. Meanwhile, Japanese crude oil imports for February fell by 13.8% YoY to 3.16mln bpd. Ahead of this week&#39;s inventories, Genscape was said to have reported a build at Cushing of 22k, hinting at a second consecutive build at the hub. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Markets looked pretty settled into a pre-Fed vigil, albeit with existing themes and trends intact (Jpy still bucking the wider pattern of G10 losses vs the Greenback on safe-haven demand due to PM Abe&rsquo;s sliding popularity amidst the land sale scandal), but were jolted by latest Brexit developments and a hawkish ECB piece penned by 5 &lsquo;sources&rsquo; said to be in the know. In short, the UK and EU held an emergency meeting ahead of the end of week Summit, with a press statement set for 11.45GMT. Cable started to climb and Eur/Gbp decline in the run up and expectation that a positive update on transition negotiations would be forthcoming, and Sterling bulls were not disappointed as a broad agreement with an Irish border back-stop was unveiled. Cable got to 1.4088 and Eur/Gbp just dipped below 0.8750 support, but the latter quickly based and bounced on the aforementioned ECB story that essentially ratified market rate expectations for a tightening around Q2 next year and a complete termination of QE by the end of 2018. Eur/Gbp has recovered towards 0.8780 and Eur/Usd rebounded over 1.2300 to circa 1.2325. Meanwhile, some positive NAFTA comments from Canada&rsquo;s Morneau (talks progressing and consensus for a swift accord) helped the underperforming Cad and Mxn pare some recent losses with the Loonie back above 1.3100 vs the Usd from 1.3125 lows. A slightly less risk-off tone as a result of all the above lifted Usd/Jpy to higher peaks over 106.00 at one stage (around 106.30 to be more precise), but yet again the big figure proves to be magnetic and exerted a gravitational pull. As a result of all the above, the DXY failed to build further on early gains and challenge 90.500 nearest resistance, before easing back below 90.000 and now looking for some respite if not renewed momentum to continue its recovery.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

(+0.3%) </strong>were indecisive and traded choppy amid mixed property data from China, a neutral PBoC open market operation and after China signalled stable monetary policy continuity as it chose PBoC Deputy Governor Yi Gang to be the next central bank head. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid an indecisive risk-tone in the region, while an unsurprising Summary of Opinions release and unchanged Rinban announcement also kept prices range-bound. As such, Japanese yields were mixed while their US counterparts were higher ahead of the FOMC in which the US 2-year yield rose to its highest since 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China approved the nomination of PBoC Deputy Governor Yi Gang to be the next PBoC Governor, while China also nominated former Vice-Finance Minister Liu Kun to be the new Finance Minister and nominated Hu Chunhua and Xi economic advisor Liu He for Vice Premier positions.

Energy and materials are amongst the worst performing sectors as concerns of US drilling activity points to higher output. Mining names are feeling the pressure from a firmer dollar with Antofagasta (-2.9%), Anglo American (2.8%), BHP (-2.7%), Rio (-2.5%) all seen at the foot of the FTSE 100; FSTE also hampered by the firmer GBP. On the flip side, the financial sector is outperforming with Barclays (+3.8%) higher after reports that activist investor, Sherborne Investors have acquired a 5.2% stake in the bank. Additionally, SocGen (+1.0%) is providing some support to the sector after the Co. said they expect resolution over the LIBOR probe in the coming weeks. Separately, sources stated the company is applying for a banking license in Australia. In terms of individual movers, Hammerson shares leapt 26% after the Co. rejected a GBP 5bln offer from French retail property developer Klepierre (-3.4%). Micro Focus (-55.6%) plummeted to the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following a double whammy from worse than expected revenue outlook and the departure of their short-lived CEO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although <strong>Usd/Jpy</strong> remains capped at 106.00 or just above (on decline in PM Abe&rsquo;s rating and broader global trade concerns), the Greenback has extended recovery gains vs the rest of the G10, other majors and EM currency counterparts. Indeed, the <strong>DXY</strong> looks relatively underpinned and more comfortable above 90.000, eyeing interim and psychological resistance at 90.500 following last Friday&rsquo;s big IP data beat and a think tank report suggesting that the FOMC may well start prepping the market for the prospect of 4 rather than 3 hikes this year after an almost unanimously anticipated 1st 25 bp tightening this week. The Greenback is especially bid vs the commodity bloc, as <strong>Usd/Cad</strong> breaches upside tech objectives in the low 1.3100 area to target 1.3132 next (61.8% Fib retracement), while <strong>Aud/Usd</strong> has now lost the 0.7700 handle and is looking at 0.7680 near term support as weakness in iron ore prices compound the pair&rsquo;s sharp retreat. <strong>Nzd/Usd</strong> is only just keeping tabs with the 0.7200 level and a prominent UK bank is predicting further downside via a trade of the week targeting 0.7130 with a 0.7315 stop. <strong>Usd/Chf</strong> is in a 0.9550-20 range and <strong>Eur/Chf</strong> is still hugging the 1.1700 marker amidst some speculation that the SNB is on the bid below the figure. Cable has rallied firmly above 1.4000 and through interim resistance at 1.4020 from just over 1.3900 at the overnight low and <strong>Eur/Gbp</strong> has retreated through 0.8800 to 0.8760 ahead of a Brexit statement from the EU (11.45GMT) after hastily arranged emergency convene before this week&rsquo;s key Summit. <strong>Eur/Usd</strong> has bounced mildly from a 1.2260 low and reclaimed a key Fib around 1.2666 in the process amidst some upbeat ECB rhetoric on growth and inflation. Ahead of the Fed, the G20 meeting will be in focus for any further trade war/protectionism verbal exchanges, beyond the draft communique already circulated last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Core bonds</strong> are deriving some support from the relatively steep pull-back in EU stocks, with <strong>Bunds</strong> paring losses to just 5 ticks vs 18 ticks at one stage, and perhaps more poignantly holding in above the 158.00 level, albeit just. Note, last Friday&rsquo;s Eurex session low was 157.98 and stops are seen on a break down to 157.81, while resistance via a market contact sits just above the early intraday high at 158.23 and ahead of the peak from the previous session at 158.35. However, <strong>Gilts</strong> still lagging/underperforming only a handful of ticks off worst levels (121.51, -40 ticks) and awaiting confirmation of reports that the UK and EU have agreed Brexit transition details, while <strong>USTs</strong> remain heavy after last week&rsquo;s strong run of data and hedging/positioning defensively for a hawkish Fed, ie 2 year yield now above 2.30% and 3 month Libor continuing its squeeze higher (2.20%+, and perhaps nearer 2.22% at today&rsquo;s fix?). Looking at <strong>10 year Treasuries</strong> from a tech perspective, 120-06+ forms rising trend-line support below last Friday&rsquo;s 120-08+ base and before 120-03, which protects the 120-00 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the commodities complex, WTI (-0.6%) and Brent (-0.7%) are pressured by concerns of oversupply arising as US drilling activity increases. The weekly Baker Hughes rig count added four oil rigs on Friday bringing the total oil rig number to 800 compared to 631 a year ago.&nbsp; Moving on to metals, Gold (-0.1%) continued to edge lower on a firmer dollar but has seen a slight bounce in recent trade. Dalian iron ore fell by 4% to its lowest level since November weighed by high inventories and weaker steel demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Energy Minister Novak affirmed pledge to see OPEC production deal through to the end and reiterated that Russia is willing to extend cuts if necessary, while he added that Russia is open to discussing phase-out from the deal when appropriate. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said they&rsquo;re beginning to see that stability is gradually returning to the oil market. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

Note, last Friday&rsquo;s Eurex session low was 157.98 and stops are seen on a break down to 157.81, while resistance via a market contact sits just above the early intraday high at 158.23 and ahead of the peak from the previous session at 158.35. Gilts still lagging/underperforming only a handful of ticks off worst levels (121.60, -31 ticks) and awaiting news on the Brexit front, while USTs remain heavy after last week&rsquo;s strong run of data and hedging/positioning defensively for a hawkish Fed, ie 2 year yield now above 2.30% and 3 month Libor continuing its squeeze higher (2.20%+, and perhaps nearer 2.22% at today&rsquo;s fix?). Looking at 10 year Treasuries from a tech perspective, 120-06+ forms rising trend-line support below last Friday&rsquo;s 120-08+ base and before 120-03, which protects the 120-00 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the commodities complex, WTI (-0.6%) and Brent (-0.7%) are pressured by concerns of oversupply arising as US drilling activity increases. The weekly Baker Hughes rig count added four oil rigs on Friday bringing the total oil rig number to 800 compared to 631 a year ago. &nbsp;Moving on to metals, Gold (-0.1%) continued to edge lower on a firmer dollar but has seen a slight bounce in recent trade. Dalian iron ore fell by 4% to its lowest level since November weighed by high inventories and weaker steel demand .</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Although Usd/Jpy remains firmly capped at 106.00 or just above, the Greenback has extended recovery gains vs the rest of the G10, other majors and EM currency counterparts. Indeed, the DXY looks relatively underpinned and more comfortable above 90.000, eyeing interim and psychological resistance at 90.500 following last Friday&rsquo;s big IP data beat and a think tank report suggesting that the FOMC may well start prepping the market for the prospect of 4 rather than 3 hikes this year after an almost unanimously anticipated 1<sup>st</sup> 25 bp tightening this week. The Greenback is especially bid vs the commodity bloc, as Usd/Cad breaches upside tech objectives in the low 1.3100 area to target 1.3132 next (61.8% Fib retracement), while Aud/Usd has now lost the 0.7700 handle and is looking at 0.7680 near term support as weakness in iron ore prices compound the pair&rsquo;s sharp retreat. Nzd/Usd is only just keeping tabs with the 0.7200 level and a prominent UK bank is predicting further downside via a trade of the week targeting 0.7130 with a 0.7315 stop. Usd/Chf is in a 0.9550-20 range and Eur/Chf is still hugging the 1.1700 marker amidst some speculation that the SNB is on the bid below the figure. Cable has perked up a bit within 1.3915-50 parameters and Eur/Gbp is softening towards 0.8800 ahead of a Brexit statement from the EU (11.45GMT) after hastily arranged emergency convene before this week&rsquo;s key Summit. Eur/Usd has bounced mildly from a 1.2260 low and reclaimed a key Fib around 1.2666 in the process amidst some upbeat ECB rhetoric on growth and inflation. Ahead of the Fed, the G20 meeting will be in focus for any further trade war/protectionism verbal exchanges, beyond the draft communique already circulated last week.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.2%) finished positive as strength in energy kept the index afloat, while Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) underperformed amid a firmer JPY and as support for PM Abe&rsquo;s administration slumped to 33% (Prev. 45%) in the wake of the land-sale scandal. KOSPI (-0.8%) suffered losses in its top-weighted stocks in which Samsung Electronics fell on news Apple is to develop displays to replace Samsung screens, while Hyundai Motor was hit by a stateside investigation into fatal incidents involving airbag failure which could affect a total of 425K Hyundai and Kia cars. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) were indecisive and traded choppy amid mixed property data from China, a neutral PBoC open market operation and after China signalled stable monetary policy continuity as it chose PBoC Deputy Governor Yi Gang to be the next central bank head. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid an indecisive risk-tone in the region, while an unsurprising Summary of Opinions release and unchanged Rinban announcement also kept prices range-bound. As such, Japanese yields were mixed while their US counterparts were higher ahead of the FOMC in which the US 2-year yield rose to its highest since 2008.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed with the region indecisive ahead of a widely anticipated Fed rate hike this week. ASX 200 (+0.2%) is choppy with strength in energy just about keeping the index afloat, while Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) underperforms amid a firmer JPY and with support for PM Abe&rsquo;s administration slumping to 33% (Prev. 45%) in the wake of the land-sale scandal. KOSPI is subdued by losses in the index&rsquo;s top-weighted stocks with Samsung Electronics reeling on news that Apple is to develop displays to replace Samsung screens, while Hyundai Motor is hit by a stateside investigation into 4 fatal incidents due to airbag failure which could impact as much as 425K Hyundai and Kia cars. Elsewhere, Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp are indecisive and trade relatively flat amid mixed property data from China, a neutral PBoC open market operation and after China signalled stable monetary policy continuity as it chose PBoC Deputy Governor Yi Gang to be the next central bank head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback remains firmer with the DXY above the 90.00 level after last Friday&rsquo;s stronger than expected Industrial Production and ahead of a widely expected rate hike from the Fed. This pressured most of its counterparts with EUR/USD once again taking the brunt of the moves and with commodity-linked currencies also kept subdued by weakness in the metals complex, while USD/HKD rose to print a fresh 33yr high. Conversely, JPY was the exception and out-strengthened USD amid the indecisive risk-tone and after USD/JPY failed to hold onto the 106.00 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid an indecisive risk-tone in the region, while an unsurprising Summary of Opinions release and unchanged Rinban announcement also contributed to the directionless trade. As such, Japanese yields are mixed while their US counterparts are higher ahead of the FOMC in which the US 2-year yield rose to its highest since 2008.</p>\r\n",
