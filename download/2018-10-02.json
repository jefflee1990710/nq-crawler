Similarly, EU Commissioner Dombrovskis stressed once again the necessity to apply EU budget rules on Italy as the deficit plans go well beyond the rules, but noted the EU are open to dialogue with Italian authorities. In response to EU&rsquo;s criticism, Deputy PM Di Maio said the unelected EU Commission pretends to lecture Italy&#39;s government declaring they will go ahead with budget plan despite threats from EU; he also added that spending cuts and economic growth are to ensure lower debt/GDP stressing they will not change the 2.4% debt/GDP target. He finally highlighted the government is not willing to exit the Euro; League&rsquo;s Borghi shared the same view.&nbsp; Alongside this, League&#39;s Economic Head said that Italy would solve most of its own problems if it had its own currency and added he would set the deficit at 3.1% if it wanted to confront the EU, whilst Deputy PM Salvini Italy is ready to ask for damages from Juncker and EU bureaucrats that are upsetting markets with their attacks on Italy. In later trade, Italian deputy PM Di Maio confirmed the outlines of the 2019 budget, &nbsp;to include EUR 10bln for &quot;Citizen&#39;s Income&quot; and reiterating the 2.4% of GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>China are said to maintain communication with the US on talks, and said it was the US who proposed to delay the security meeting. Separately, White House Advisor Kudlow said the USMCA is sending a signal to China saying &ldquo;we are acting as one&rdquo;; he added the new NAFTA was negotiated in consultation with Democrats. On China, Kudlow noted the region has not made a serious enough effort at appeasing the US. Separately, US Senator Cornyn said that the Senate may lack votes to approve the USMCA, adding the earliest vote could occur is after November elections. Later, US President Trump said there seems to be great support for the trade deal in Congress whilst stating the US will have a great relationship with China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The Times reported overnight that PM May is to propose a &lsquo;Grand Bargain&rsquo; to keep the UK within the EU customs union for goods after the transition period ends in December 2020 to break the deadlock in negotiations. This triggered responses from other leaders at the Tories Conference on Tuesday including UK Former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson who said to support UK PM May&#39;s original plan, likely referring to her Mansion House speech rather than her Chequers proposal. Elsewhere, after PM May noted the best way to solve the Irish border issue is based on the Chequers proposal, the DUP Leader Foster stated that there is no way they can accept different regulations in Northern Ireland and the rest of the country, not even as a backstop. UK Brexit Minister Raab said the UK is open to other deals adding he cannot let the EU off the hook for cavalier rebuff of Chequers plan, noting there is no such thing as pure independence. He said to expect a deal in time for Christmas, and urged to get an agreement in November otherwise will be too short on time for legislative time-frame. UK PM May later noted in the event of a no deal, WTO tariffs would come into effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; FED:</strong> Fed&rsquo;s Powell, speaking to the NABE, once again stuck to his upbeat message on the US economy, though remains cognizant of the risks facing the Fed. Powell said gradual rates are meant to balance risks and sees a &quot;remarkably positive outlook&quot; on inflation and employment; he stands ready to act &quot;with authority&quot; if inflation expectations drift from their target and does not expect significant inflation rise but is taking risk seriously. There was limited market reaction following his remarks. Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan (Dove, non-voter) also spoke today where he said the Fed should be gradually moving rates towards the neutral stance, which he believes to be between 2.5% to 2.75%, and added it should assess once there, also mentioning that he is hopeful this can happen without inverting the yield curve. On the US economy, he noted that it is at or over full employment, GDP growth will be 3% this year whilst next year 2.5% as the fiscal stimulus fades; he further added that the debt-fuelled stimulus could turn into a headwind. He said he is happy with one more rate hike this year in December and the base case is two next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Villeroy (Dovish) sees spillover effects from EM as limited; he added there can be no influence of fiscal policy on monetary policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX 0.00% at 2930, NDX -0.22% at 7628, DJI +0.47% at 26775 SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.12%, Materials +0.45%, Industrials +0.19%, Cons Discretionary -1.43%, Cons Staples +0.62%, Healthcare -0.09%, Financials +0.04%, Tech -0.01%, Telecoms +0.11%, Utilities +1.28%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Intel (INTC) was one of the day&rsquo;s biggest movers after giving constructive forward guidance.

PG&amp;E (PCG) and other utilities also benefitted from a risk off sentiment as defensive sectors lead on the day. AMD (AMD) moved downwards against the semiconductor industry. Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell on a disappointing earnings view which had a knock on effect on the wider airline industry. Guggenheim downgraded Edwards Lifesciences (EW) making it the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s biggest underperformer at the time of writing. Some China based names were also other big losers with NetEase (NTES) and Baidu (BIDU) dragging down the Nasdaq.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 0.07 LOWER AT USD 75.23/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.18 LOWER AT USD 84.80/BBL. </strong>Ahead of this week&rsquo;s inventory data, Brent is consolidating around $85/bbl after hitting highs not seen in four years on Monday. WTI, meanwhile, is hanging around the $75/bbl area. Russia on Tuesday reported production data with output rising by 150k BPD to a record 11.36mln BPD. Reports also suggested that the Saudi-Kuwait talks on shared oil projects are said to have stalled over the role of Chevron. On the brokerage front, Barclays raised its Q4 2018 Brent price forecast by $3 to $77/bbl.

Most of the action was concentrated in the long end of the curve were yields were higher by c.3bps. 2s10 s and 2s30s were narrower by c.2bps at settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The index and broad Dollar have drifted down from best levels registered at the height of risk aversion on several factors including the ongoing US-China import tariff stand-off and budget barbs between the Italian Government and EU officials. The DXY climbed to 95.744 at one stage before easing back towards 95.500 as rival currencies clawed back some lost ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>EURUSD has recovered from just above 1.1500 having breached several downside chart levels from a peak of 1.1580 at one stage amid EU criticism over Italy&rsquo;s budget. Similarly, Cable has rebounded from sub-1.2950 lows towards 1.2975 having accelerated losses through 1.3000 when stops were triggered on a break just above the big figure and the UK construction PMI missed consensus in contrast to Monday&rsquo;s manufacturing headline print.

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index and broad Dollar have drifted down from best levels registered at the height of risk aversion on several factors including the ongoing US-China import tariff stand-off and budget barbs between the Italian Government and EU officials. The DXY climbed to 95.744 at one stage before easing back towards 95.500 as rival currencies clawed back some lost ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G10 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overall pattern remains the same, but the Greenbacks major counterparts regained a degree of composure to climb off session lows with the aid of some technical buying and less antagonistic headlines on the Italian fiscal and Brexit front. To recap, the session kicked off with pretty inflammatory remarks from Italy&rsquo;s coalition Government, or at least the more belligerent members, and admonishments from Brussels for breaching the budget rules, but some investor angst was alleviated via reiterations that leaving the Eur is not on the agenda and a pledge not to exceed the 3% deficit ceiling beyond the 3 year period from 2019-2021 when 2.4% is targeted. Eur/Usd has subsequently recovered from just above 1.1500 having breached several downside chart levels from a peak of 1.1580 at one stage. Similarly, Cable has rebounded from sub-1.2950 lows towards 1.2975 having accelerated losses through 1.3000 when stops were triggered on a break just above the big figure and the UK construction PMI missed consensus in contrast to Monday&rsquo;s manufacturing headline print. However, unexpected backing for PM May from ex-Foreign Minister Johnson at the Conservative party conference, albeit on the Mansion House Brexit plan vs Chequers White Paper, helped the Pound regroup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aud and Nzd also managed to consolidate off worst levels and return towards 0.7200 and 0.6600 respectively after declines overnight on a neutral, hence not really supportive RBA and weak Q3 NZIER sentiment survey, while the Cad held within a relatively tight 1.2800-40 range vs its US counterpart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jpy and Chf buck the general trend with the former above 114.00 for the most part and latter trading between 0.9855-30 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Real was the star performer, or rather the exception to the norm and rallied through 4.0000 vs the Usd to just over 3.9500 at best, with the catalyst coming in the form of latest pre-Brazilian election poll results from Ibope showing Bolsonaro extending his lead in the first round, to 31% from 27% previously, while Haddad stayed on 21%, and these two candidates seen even on 42% in a run-off.</p>\r\n",

She is to propose &ldquo;Grand Bargain&rdquo; to keep Britain tied to European customs rules on goods after transition period ends in December 2020. Northern Irish DUP MP stated that UK border proposals reported in the Times had not been presented to their party and they will not comment on it; will continue to support May. The DUP leader added they are speaking to the UK government regarding Irish border proposals and they need to see text before decisions can be made. (The Times/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Immigration Minister Nokes believes the government seeks a post-Brexit immigration system that treats all nations equally but gives ministers the flexibility to tailor rules for countries negotiating trade deals.

This comes after suggestions from Italian Lawmaker Borghi hinting that the country would be better off leaving the Euro. Despite an intention to leave the Euro later denied by the Deputy PM, Italian assets are seeing significant losses, with Italian Bank stocks down over 2%, and the FTSE MIB once again at the bottom of the index pile.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial sector is lagging its peers due to the weakness in Italian banks, with the energy sector outperforming off the back of oil prices hitting 4 year highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FTSE is the outperforming bourse off the back of a Brexit-hit GBP, but is trading in negative territory. The index is being pressured by a collapse in Royal Mail shares after a guidance cut in Monday&rsquo;s trade, with the co. extending losses in the European morning. The stock is now at the foot of the Stoxx 600 and has hit the lowest level in its lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency is not the biggest G10 loser vs a generally firm USD, as the DXY rebounds to just over 95.700 amidst broad Dollar gains vs rivals, bar the safer-havens, but has been centre stage since Tuesday&rsquo;s EU &lsquo;open&rsquo; following more Italian budget headlines underlying a defiant stance on the 2019 deficit. Indeed, members of the coalition insist that the proposed 2.4% target is fixed ahead of another budget meeting and presentation to parliament on Wednesday, while the League party&rsquo;s Borghi contends that the Government would have set the bar even higher at 3.1% if it really wanted to take on the EU, adding that the country&rsquo;s fiscal problems could be solved if it was not in the Eur club. Eur/Usd has now fallen below a 50% fib (1.1558) through a daily support level (1.1529) and September&rsquo;s low (1.1526) to trip stops under 1.1525 and 1.1520 ahead of a final downside technical target (1.1509) before 1.1500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Another major underperformer amidst a raft of Brexit commentary from the Tory conference, but accelerating to the downside once stops were tripped on a break of 1.3012 in Cable and that pairing failed to keep hold of the 1.3000 handle. However, the Pound was also undermined by a weaker than forecast headline UK construction PMI and is currently eyeing bids ahead of 1.2950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - Already on the backfoot during overnight trade, partly due to ongoing US-China trade concerns, as President Trump stated that now is not the time to talk, but for the Aud also as RBA policy guidance remained neutral, the antipodean Dollars are extending losses and deeply through big figures that had been providing some traction (0.7200 and 0.6600 respectively). Aud now only just holding above 0.7150 and the Kiwi 0.6575 ahead of the latest GDT auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Greenback&rsquo;s resurgence has eroded more USMCA-inspired Loonie (and Peso) gains, with Usd/Cad rebounding a bit further above 1.2800 having held above key/strong technical support yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Relatively resilient against the overall Dollar bid, with Usd/Jpy retreating from 114.00+ peaks on a broad downturn in risk sentiment, but still technically bullish while not seriously threatening 113.50 and a series of chart supports below, while the Franc has rebounded to circa 0.9835 and 1.1325 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Losses across the board vs the Usd as recent recovery momentum stalls and reverses on largely negative external factors rather than anything new detrimental in the region. Indeed, even the Rub is weaker around 65.5000 and not deriving any support/impetus from the latest spike in oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another BTP boost for the 10 year German benchmark as Italian Government officials continue to stand rigidly by their fiscal guns and rail against the EU establishment with claims about Germany and France wanting the coalition to collapse, while one prominent League party member also suggests that the country would be able to solve its budget issues if it resorted to the Lira. Bunds gapped up to 159.06 off the Eurex open and advanced to 159.35 vs 158.77 at yesterday&rsquo;s close before topping out, while their Italian counterparts have been as much as 152 ticks below parity at 121.20, but are now trying to regroup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the oil market, WTI is hanging around the USD 75.40/BBL level and unchanged for the day after the benchmark hit four-year-long highs in early European trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Production figures were released from Russia for September, who said this stood at 11.36mln BPD vs. 11.21mln BPD in August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals sector, gold is marginally in the green as the yellow metal has caught a safe-haven bid in the Italy driven risk-off tone.

        "content": "<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency is not the biggest G10 loser vs a generally firm USD, as the DXY rebounds to just over 95.700 amidst broad Dollar gains vs rivals, bar the safer-havens, but has been centre stage since Tuesday&rsquo;s EU &lsquo;open&rsquo; following more Italian budget headlines underlying a defiant stance on the 2019 deficit. Indeed, members of the coalition insist that the proposed 2.4% target is fixed ahead of another budget meeting and presentation to parliament on Wednesday, while the League party&rsquo;s Borghi contends that the Government would have set the bar even higher at 3.1% if it really wanted to take on the EU, adding that the country&rsquo;s fiscal problems could be solved if it was not in the Eur club. Eur/Usd has now fallen below a 50% fib (1.1558) through a daily support level (1.1529) and September&rsquo;s low (1.1526) to trip stops under 1.1525 and 1.1520 ahead of a final downside technical target (1.1509) before 1.1500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major underperformer amidst a raft of Brexit commentary from the Tory conference, but accelerating to the downside once stops were tripped on a break of 1.3012 in Cable and that pairing failed to keep hold of the 1.3000 handle. However, the Pound was also undermined by a weaker than forecast headline UK construction PMI and is currently eyeing bids ahead of 1.2950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already on the backfoot during overnight trade, partly due to ongoing US-China trade concerns, as President Trump stated that now is not the time to talk, but for the Aud also as RBA policy guidance remained neutral, the antipodean Dollars are extending losses and deeply through big figures that had been providing some traction (0.7200 and 0.6600 respectively). Aud now only just holding above 0.7150 and the Kiwi 0.6575 ahead of the latest GDT auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback&rsquo;s resurgence has eroded more USMCA-inspired Loonie (and Peso) gains, with Usd/Cad rebounding a bit further above 1.2800 having held above key/strong technical support yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatively resilient against the overall Dollar bid, with Usd/Jpy retreating from 114.00+ peaks on a broad downturn in risk sentiment, but still technically bullish while not seriously threatening 113.50 and a series of chart supports below, while the Franc has rebounded to circa 0.9835 and 1.1325 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Losses across the board vs the Usd as recent recovery momentum stalls and reverses on largely negative external factors rather than anything new detrimental in the region. Indeed, even the Rub is weaker around 65.5000 and not deriving any support/impetus from the latest spike in oil prices.</p>\r\n",

(Fox)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&#39;s narrowing interest rate spread with the US and declining current account surplus have led to some concerns regarding capital outflow. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&#39;s Defense Ministry said they resolutely opposed the US &quot;freedom of navigation&quot; adding it&#39;s a threat to sovereignty which China will take necessary measures to defend. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ&rsquo;s September Tankan Corporate Price Expectation Survey stated Japanese firms sees Y/Y inflation at 0.8% (Prev. 0.9%); 3yr and 5yr expectations unchanged at 1.1%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is preparing to limit Britain&#39;s ability to strike free-trade deals after Brexit in a significant concession to the EU aimed at breaking the deadlock in negotiations. She is to propose &ldquo;Grand Bargain&rdquo; to keep Britain tied to European customs rules on goods after transition period ends in December 2020. (The Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Immigration Minister Nokes believes the government seeks a post-Brexit immigration system that treats all nations equally but gives ministers the flexibility to tailor rules for countries negotiating trade deals. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK lawmaker and Brexit hardliner Rees-Mogg said changing a leadership usually causes more problems than it solves, it&#39;s prudent to back PM May. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU diplomats have rejected UK PM May&rsquo;s conference pitch that Brussels must move first to break the deadlock over negotiations. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond said if WTO regulations are implemented we will have to have border checks, while he added we need a very very gradual process of re-balancing our trade with the EU. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former UK Foreign Minister Johnson told senior conservatives that he would delay Brexit by at least six months if he became PM. (Newswires) This comes ahead of Johnson&rsquo;s speech today at the Conservative Party Conference which many see as essentially his pitch to succeed PM May. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Commission President Juncker, on Italy&#39;s 2019 budget proposal, said &ldquo;we are in talks&rdquo; and he added &ldquo;if they want further special treatment it would end the Euro.&rdquo; (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Williams (Neutral, Voter) said as we move towards a more normal conduct of policy, we shouldn&#39;t rest easy and think we won&rsquo;t run into future challenges. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Rosengren (Hawkish, Non-voter) said FOMC should continue on its current pace of raising rates, and the further the US gets below full employment the higher the risk of inflation increasing. He said the continued growth and tighter labour markets will likely lead to imbalances including but not limited to inflation, while strong growth is expected to continue for now, though trade and emerging markets problems pose risks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Dove, Non-voter) said so far tax cuts have not boosted business spending outside of the oil sector, we are probably not at full employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Villeroy (Dovish) said it is now or never to build economic union. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tentative trade in FX markets with the greenback little changed and major pairs trading flat. NZD initially saw some downside following a weaker Q3 business confidence, while AUD/USD was nudged higher by 10 pips as the RBA stood pat on rates as expected and stated that low interest rates are supporting the economy, while business conditions and the outlook for the labour market remain positive. Elsewhere, JPY initially attempted to crawl further from the 114.00 level against the dollar, however remained in close proximity to the figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA maintained the Cash Rate at the record low 1.50% for a 23rd straight meeting. The central bank reiterated low rates are supporting the economy and progress on unemployment and inflation is expected to be gradual, the statement added that 2018 and 2019 GDP growth is to average slightly above 3%. The RBA stated business conditions and the outlook for the labour market remains positive, however the drought has led to difficulties in the farming sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korean government spokesperson said US is still trying to subdue the country via sanctions, while he reiterated that North Korea is taking substantial steps to implement the joint statement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities traded little changed as WTI and Brent hovered around four-year highs at USD 75.50/bbl and USD 85.00/bbl respectively, while traders continue to pin the rally in prices on oil-related Iranian sanctions coming into effect in just over a month. Elsewhere, gold mirrored the miniscule dollar moves while copper underperformed as demand concerns re-surfaced amid less optimistic trade comments from the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Monday, falling after overnight news of a free trade deal in principle between US, Mexico and Canada. A slight easing in Italian budget tensions was also cited for the bund sell-off in early European trade, which Tsys sympathised with. 2-year yields edging up slightly, while longer-dated yields rose by as much as c.4bps at settlement. Major curve spreads also widened modestly (2s5s up 0.3bps, 2s30s wider by around 2.5bps, struggling to maintain ground above their 50DMAs, technicians observed). US T-note futures (Z8) settles 3+ ticks lower at 118-21+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he expects to sign the new USMCA deal by the end of November. US White House Advisor Navarro mentioned November 30th, while Mexican Economy Minister Guajardo stated that the new USMCA could be signed by the three Presidents at the G20 on November 29th. Guajardo also said that the new US-Mexico-Canada trade deal could take effect from the second half of 2019. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian PM Trudeau said the US has expressed willingness to discuss steel and aluminium tariffs. In related news, US President Trump said steel and aluminium tariffs will remain on Canada and Mexico unless they can do something like quotas, while USTR Ligthizer and US Commerce Secretary Ross said there is no deadline for resolving metals tariff dispute.
