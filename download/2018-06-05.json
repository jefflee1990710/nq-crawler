Some of the steepening was attributed to block trades in FVU7 and WNU8, according to Informa. US 10YR T-Notes futures (Sep 2018) settled 6+ ticks higher at 119-22+.</p>\r\n",

The proposition was not welcomed by Canada nor Mexico, as they had previously suggested. Mexico announced counter measures against US steel and aluminium tariffs (alongside a 350k tonne tariff-free quota for import of pork legs and shoulders from non-US suppliers). Mexico will levy a 20% tariff on pork legs &amp; shoulders, apples and potatoes, 20-25% on cheese and 15-25% on steel products, which will likely hurt pork farmers and exporters in the US. Mexico Economy Minister Guajardo said it will replace US pork imports with European products in order to reduce the impact on inflation. Elsewhere, TASS reported that Russia is attempting to get the EU to take joint measures on US tariffs. Elsewhere, ahead of this week&rsquo;s G7 meeting, an EU official suggested that no breakthrough will be seen on US steel and aluminium tariffs, urging the EU to show unity with the current US administration. In later trade, top aide said Mexico&#39;s AMLO believes no NAFTA deal is better than a bad NAFTA deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* G7: </strong>A senior EU official reported G7 leaders are to call on North Korea to undergo a complete verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation. He also noted the G7 is to establish a rapid response mechanism to reinforce cooperation on defending democracies from foreign threats and is likely to uphold sanctions against Russia over Crimea and Ukraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB sources reported that the central bank sees the June 14th meeting as &#39;live&#39; to discuss an exit from QE, and the message could be communicated in a statement. ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann (Hawk) said Italy&rsquo;s market turmoil shows the currency union is not yet &lsquo;crisis proof&rsquo; and added it would be tragic if reforms, fiscal consolidation achieved during the crisis, were reversed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> A Times journalist reported that the opposition Labour party is reportedly going to announce a major shift towards a soft Brexit, and leader Corbyn will table &quot;internal market&quot; amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, customs bill and trade bill. A BBC journalist added that it was not &lsquo;completely clear what&rsquo;s going on yet&rsquo; but the move may &lsquo;drastically cut chances of defeating the government on one of their tricky votes next week.&rsquo; Labour later confirmed that it was to attach an internal market amendment, though it wasn&rsquo;t a new position, it is merely a development of an existing position; sources in leader&#39;s office also said that no decision has been taken on how MPs will be asked to vote on EEA (NOTE: the upshot is that voters would have a choice between Labour&rsquo;s &lsquo;soft Brexit&rsquo; and what it calls a Tory &lsquo;hard Brexit&rsquo;). Overnight it was reported that the UK will not be presenting its white paper on the relationship it desires with the EU until after the June summit; it was expected in advance. Analysts are now doubting that there is enough time for the UK to make progress to secure a deal by the summit in October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Iran has begun work on infrastructure for advanced centrifuges at the Natanz facility, according to the Iranian atomic energy organization; these activities will be within the framework of the nuclear agreement. The IAEA confirmed a letter that noted plans for uranium enrichment was delivered by the Iranian government. Senior US Treasury officials have called on allies to harden financial networks against. US Treasury&rsquo;s Mandelker noted the US will apply unprecedented financial pressure on Iran to force a choice between stopping support for terrorism, destabilising activities or facing &lsquo;economic calamity&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALIAN POLITCS: </strong>Italian PM Conte vowed radical change that added to some nervousness among BTP investors, promising welfare via the universal basic income, and immigration curbs. On pension reform he didn&rsquo;t specifically say that it would be reformed, though later in the session, Deputy PM Salvini said the pension system will be overhauled. Conte also said that Italian debt is &lsquo;fully sustainable&rsquo; but its reduction is necessary for growth, which will be achieved by &lsquo;by increasing our wealth, not with austerity that, in recent years, has helped to make it grow&rsquo;. Economists pointed out that the new government&rsquo;s policy agenda would add EUR 10bln to annual government expenditure (Italy currently has debt to gdp of around 130%). Later, Conte reiterated that he has no intention of leaving the EU. Conte is won the Senate confidence vote and is expected to walk through the confidence motions also in the Chamber of Deputies given the majority held by 5SM/Lega.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>The US ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for May came in at 58.6, beating expectations at 56.8. The change in direction suggests that the slowdown in GDP growth seen in Q1 was temporary, analysts said, pointing out that this pace is consistent with an annualised GDP growth above 4%. The New Orders Index also rebounded above 60.0 and the Employment Index to 54.1 from 53.6. Prices Paid Index also leaped, mostly amid higher steel and lumber prices which are both subject to tariffs from Canada and other supplier. Overall the report indicates that although uncertainty remains around trade tariff, production is not holding back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.07%&nbsp;, NDX +0.32%, DJI -0.06%.&nbsp;</strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +0.51%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -00.47%, Energy: -0.19%, Financials: -0.49%, Health Care: -0.18%, Industrials: +0.16%, Materials: +0.86%, Telecoms: +0.39%, Tech: +0.34%, Utilities: -0.51%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>US Emini S&amp;P 500 equity futures continued moving horizontally within a 14 point range on Tuesday. There was a dip in afternoon trade, most likely on a collection of negative trade news flow (Mexico and Canada are leaning against bilateral trade talks, preferring trilateral negotiations; while officials also do not see any chance of a breakthrough with regards to steel and aluminium tariffs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Fox&rsquo;s (FOXA) takeover of Sky (SKY LN) has been given conditional approval by UK regulators, subject to the sale of Sky News; it has previously been reported that Fox would sell the unit to Disney (DIS). Healthcare and retailers were again at the top of the pile on Tuesday; Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) bounced back slightly from yesterday&rsquo;s drop after seeing mixed results from its trial with BMY. Mylan (MYL) outperformed following an FDA approval for chemotherapy treatment Fulphila (the first substitute for Amgen&rsquo;s (AMGN) Neulasta &ndash; weighing on Amgen. Twitter (TWTR) also performed well, amid news that it replaces Monsanto (MON) in the S&amp;P500 on Thursday, following Bayer&rsquo;s (BAYN GY) acquisition of Monsanto. Retailers benefitting from earnings from GIII Apparel (GII). Bank stocks were lower as yields fell and the yield curve flattened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (JUL 18) SETTLES UP $0.77 AT $65.52L; BRENT (AUG 18) SETTLES UP $0.09 AT $75.38. </strong>On Tuesday trade WTI outperformed Brent crude following reports that the US had asked OPEC to raise oil output by 1mln BPD. Other sources later suggested that while the US did make a request to OPEC, it did not specify any specific levels. Elsewhere, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo met with Russia&rsquo;s Energy Minister Novak, and Russian press reported that the two share a similar view on the current oil market situation. Later, Novak reiterated his views that OPEC+ countries should consider a possible easing of oil output restrictions depending on demand conditions. In analyst chatter, Goldman Sachs has forecast oil demand will be over 100mln BPD this year for the first time ever. After market on Tuesday the API will report weekly inventory data; analysts expect crude stocks to draw 1.8mln bbls, Cushing is seen drawing around 70k, according to Genscape; distillates expected to see a build of 800k and Gasoline to see a build of 600k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) SETTLED 6+ TICKS HIGHER AT 119-22+.</strong> Treasury yields fell on Tuesday, with investors citing concerns regarding the rhetoric of Italian PM Conte, who delivered an address to lawmakers ahead of his confidence motions, which was said to contribute to Eurozone peripheral yields widening versus the Bund. The solid ISM data helped yields rise slightly, though a collection of negative news flow on trade and NAFTA kept the bid in Treasuries. Yields were down between 1-3bps across the curve, with most of the action in the belly (2s -1.6bps, 5s -2.6bps, 10s -3bps, 30s -1bp), though the curve was left modestly steeper at settlement (2s30s +1.5bps, 5s30s +2.5bps). Some of the steepening was attributed to block trades in FVU7 and WNU8, according to Informa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD, EUR:</strong> There was two-way action in the US dollar on Tuesday, with the DXY initially seeing gains above 94.00, largely on EUR weakness (Conte/BTP action) before paring back broadly in afternoon trade, largely a function of EUR gaining (ECB sources, Conte has no plans to leave the euro), with the single currency regaining the 1.17 level, which it seems to be consolidating around in recent trade. The major catalysts on the horizon include the G7 meeting, as well as the upcoming FOMC and ECB meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Cable rose in early trade after services PMI data showed an upward surprise; all three PMI&rsquo;s have put in solid performances pointing to a growth rebound in Q2, which has slightly increased the probability of a BOE hike in August; sterling&rsquo;s gains, however, seem to have been capped by Brexit news flow which continues to suggest that that UK will struggle to a) get its EU Withdrawal Bill passed (next Tuesday) and get any positive development from the EU at the end of June summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, MXN: </strong>USDCAD jumped after White House economic advisor Kudlow suggested that Trump was erring towards bilateral negotiations (rejected by Canada and Mexico), sending the Loonie above 1.3050. MXN, meanwhile rose above 20.45. Analysts and traders are concerned that the window for reaching a NAFTA deal that Congress can pass in this session is rapidly diminishing, while Trump tries to split the parties to try and engineer a quick deal. While all parties remain at the negotiating table, analysts say Mexico&rsquo;s moves suggest it has almost given up on reaching a NAFTA deal; candidate AMLO is said to consider no deal better than a bad deal, aides said; separately, AMLO extended his lead in a poll conducted by GEA-ISA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Has traded in a narrow range around 109.50-110.00. Safe haven flows were attributed, with Treasuries up, and equities struggling for gains. Additionally, large expiries at 110.00 and 109.70 kept action narrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BRL: </strong>The BCB intervened in FX as the BRL rose above 3.80 around two-year lows, without disclosing the magnitude of its intervention. There as also soft PMIs contributing to downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Weakened overnight after the RBA stood pat on policy, tweaking its statement very slightly to strike a dovish tone. The Aussie also suffered from downside in commodity prices, as well as negative news flow regarding global trade, and a soft risk-tone. While traders continue to lean into the AUDUSD around 0.7650 (HOD 0.7650), the 0.76 level provides support (LOD 0.7595).</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo met with Russia&rsquo;s Energy Minister Novak, and Russian press reported that the two share a similar view on the current oil market situation. Later, Novak reiterated his views that OPEC+ countries should consider a possible easing of oil output restrictions depending on demand conditions. In analyst chatter, Goldman Sachs has forecast oil demand will be over 100mln BPD this year for the first time ever. After market on Tuesday the API will report weekly inventory data; analysts expect crude stocks to draw 1.8mln bbls, Cushing is seen drawing around 70k, according to Genscape; distillates expected to see a build of 800k and Gasoline to see a build of 600k. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The Loonie lurched from highs not far off 1.2900 vs the Usd to circa 1.3065 and the weakest in over 2 months. Offers at 1.3000 did not offer much in the way of resistance, as the pair breached May&rsquo;s peak and eyes the 1.3125 ytd high next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The antipodeans also lost more ground vs their US counterpart towards 0.7600 and 0.7000 respectively on data and a reversal in GDT prices alongside a more general deterioration in risk sentiment that hit the commodity bloc and high beta currencies particularly hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency continues to struggle around big figure and/or technical levels, like 1.1700 vs the Greenback, 0.8800 against the Pound and 128.70 in the Jpy cross, while renewed Italian political jitters also weighed as PM-in-waiting Conte delivered a speech ahead of Parliament votes to officially rubber stamp his approval today and on Wednesday. In a nut-shell, he reiterated that the new Government will pursue policies in accordance with the coalition agreement, which will challenge several established EU rules and less formal guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound bucked the overall trend as noted above, but Cable also pared post-UK PMI gains from close to 1.3400 at best and slipped back under 1.3350 in late trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative resilience from the traditional safe-havens as risk aversion rose and headline pairs staved off attempts to climb above 110.00 and 0.9900 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some respite for the likes of the Peso and Real on data and BCB intervention, but a bad day overall on US intentions to switch approach to separate lines of NAFTA negotiations and general risk-off flows, while the Rand was undermined by a GDP contraction. Usd/Mxn hit nearly 20.4600 at one stage, Usd/Brl 3.8000 after breaching a key chart level around 3.7700 and Usd/Zar climbed above 12.8000 before consolidating.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.5%) was negative with the index weighed by the energy sector after oil prices briefly slipped to below USD 65.00/bbl and with Retail Food Group the worst performer in the index after it flagged a statutory net loss due to termination payments. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) remained afloat following the recent currency weakness, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) and Hang Seng (+0.3%) were choppy as participants mulled over a mild liquidity drain as well as inconclusive Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI data which were unchanged from the prior month. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid similar quiet trade in T-notes and the indecisiveness in the region, while the10yr JGB auction failed to provide a catalyst as the results were mixed which added to the sombre tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Services PMI (May) 52.9 vs. Exp. 52.9 (Prev. 52.9). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Composite PMI (May) 52.3 (Prev. 52.3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 70bln via 7-day and CNY 50bln via 28-day reverse repos, for a net daily drain of CNY 30bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.4157 (Prev. 6.4208)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian RBA Cash Rate (Jun) 1.50% vs. Exp. 1.50% (Prev. 1.50%). RBA added policy is consistent with sustainable economic growth and reaching inflation target. Low level of rates continues to support economy. Inflation and wage growth likely to remain low for a while. Expect pick up in domestic growth this year and next, global economy has strengthened. Strengthening currency would result in slower pick up of growth and inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ&#39;s Wakatabe says they are still distant from the 2% inflation target and thus too early to talk about specific exit strategies. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May reportedly abandoned plans to present UK-EU blueprint before this month&#39;s summit in Brussels and will now postpone its release to after the summit. (FT) She also reportedly has a week to forge a compromise with Conservative party backbenchers that are threatening to defeat the government on post-Brexit customs arrangement legislation which are to be voted on next Tuesday. (The Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK BRC Retail Sales YY (May) 2.80% (Prev. -4.20%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Markit/CIPS Services PMI (May) 54.0 vs. Exp. 53.0 (Prev. 52.8). Markit state that so far, the three PMI surveys indicate that GDP looks set to rise by 0.3-0.4% in the second quarter. This is vs. the BoE&rsquo;s forecast of 0.4%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Markit Composite Final PMI (May) 54.1 vs. Exp. 54.1 (Prev. 54.1). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran nuclear official Kamalvandi said Tehran will inform the UN atomic agency regarding beginning of capacity increase for uranium gas production. Iran has begun work on infrastructure for advanced centrifuges at the Natanz facility, as according to the Iranian atomic energy organization, these activities will be within the framework of the nuclear agreement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European bourses are trading mostly in the green (Eurostoxx 50 +0.5%) with the exception of the SMI 20 and FTSE 100. The UK index is feeling pressure from the strengthening GBP following an above consensus UK Services PMI, adding to the slew of recent PMI beats. The FTSE MIB is outperforming its peers while Italian PM Conte is to speak before Senate and go through a confidence vote later today, where the chance of a rejection is almost non-existent following the limbo-state Italy has been in for months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at sectors, Telecoms are underperforming while IT names outperform. In terms of stock specifics, RBS (-3.6%) is hit after the UK government decided to sell a 7.7% stake in the company worth around GBP 2.6bln following the bank bailout during the crisis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatively quiet trade overall, but the index has inched back to the 94.000 handle as the Greenback claws back losses vs G10 counterparts and/or rival currencies lose some of their recent momentum. A raft of Eurozone PMIs are not providing much impetus, but the US slate is busy and could prompt more in the way of price action as Treasury yields sit off late May/very early June lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound has leapt to the top of the pile in wake of another UK PMI beat that has lifted the composite reading to its best ytd level and prompted survey compiler Markit to predict Q2 GDP growth of 0.3-0.4% q/q (vs just 0.1% in Q1). Cable has duly extended gains above 1.3300 towards 1.3400, while Eur/Gbp has retreated from almost 0.8800 to sub-0.8750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is outperforming its antipodean peer after disappointing Aussie current account data overnight and no change whatsoever in the RBA&rsquo;s wait-and-see stance on policy rates after the latest meeting. Aud/Nzd is back down below 1.08500, while Nzd/Usd is consolidating gains above 0.7000 and Aud/Usd has eased back a bit further from Monday&rsquo;s peaks above 0.7660. GDP data tomorrow may give the Aud more direction, but ahead of that it&rsquo;s GDT for the Kiwi, albeit with futures not suggesting much move in auction prices. Turning to the Loonie, early resilience around 1.2900 vs the Usd has given way to a rebound towards 1.3000 alongside a sharp downturn in crude prices on reports that the US has asked OPEC to increase their output by 1mln BPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All keeping tabs with big figure levels vs the Usd with the Franc not straying too far from 0.9900, Eur/Usd pivoting 1.1700 and Usd/Jpy still capped around 110.00. For the single currency especially, a band of option expiries spanning 1.1675-1.1750 and totalling 5 bn looks set to keep the pair rangebound barring any other significant driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Peso is a notable laggard with Usd/Mxn back over 20.000 after Mexico upped the trade war ante vs the US buy proposing a 20% tax on pork, while raising objections via the WTO in response to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK debt and STIRs were right to tread more cautiously in the run up to the 3rd and final PMI given another headline beat to complete a clean sweep and best composite reading of 2018, with Gilts down to fresh Liffe lows in response at 122.43 (-30 ticks vs +13 ticks at one stage), while Short Sterling futures are now as much as 3 ticks adrift vs +2 ticks at best. May&rsquo;s PMIs are highly unlikely to prompt a knee-jerk reaction from the BoE, but will instil some tightening premium back into markets that have become dormant on rate hike prospects after May&rsquo;s dovish MPC hold. Note, Bunds have also recoiled from earlier Eurex peaks that reached 161.23 (+34 ticks) to around 161.00, as Italian BTPs stabilise off their base, while US Treasuries are mid-range in relatively lacklustre overnight trade</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are negative on the day with WTI down 0.2% and Brent down 1.2% as traders focus on the US reportedly asking OPEC for a 1mln BPD oil output increase, as according to sources. In an immediate move WTI moved from USD 64.94 to USD 64.78. This comes ahead of US mid-terms later this year, which has recently seen US President Trump try to talk down the price of oil via OPEC with US retail gasoline prices at 3 year highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking ahead traders are eyeing the OPEC+ meeting on June 22nd. Energy ministers did initially signal a rise in output to offset supply disruptions from Iranian and Venezuelan sanctions but then switched rhetoric at the unofficial OPEC+ meeting over the weekend. An official restriction ease is still anyone&rsquo;s guess. Meanwhile, participants await the latest stockpile count with API inventories due after-hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, in the metals complex, the yellow metal takes a breather with little price change following three consecutive days in the red. Dalian iron ore futures rise despite record stockpiles after reports Tangshan (China&rsquo;s number 1 steelmaking city) is to shut 226 mining companies. Furthermore, copper rose for a fourth consecutive session to its highest in almost six weeks as the red metal is underpinned by potential supply disruptions amid wage talks at the world&rsquo;s largest mine.</p>\r\n",

The UK index is feeling pressure from the strengthening GBP following an above consensus UK Services PMI, adding to the slew of recent PMI beats. The FTSE MIB is outperforming its peers while Italian PM Conte is to speak before Senate and go through a confidence vote later today, where the chance of a rejection is almost non-existent following the limbo-state Italy has been in for months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at sectors, Telecoms are underperforming while IT names outperform. In terms of stock specifics, RBS (-3.6%) is hit after the UK government decided to sell a 7.7% stake in the company worth around GBP 2.6bln following the bank bailout during the crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatively quiet trade overall, but the index has inched back to the 94.000 handle as the Greenback claws back losses vs G10 counterparts and/or rival currencies lose some of their recent momentum. A raft of Eurozone PMIs are not providing much impetus, but the US slate is busy and could prompt more in the way of price action as Treasury yields sit off late May/very early June lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound has leapt to the top of the pile in wake of another UK PMI beat that has lifted the composite reading to its best ytd level and prompted survey compiler Markit to predict Q2 GDP growth of 0.3-0.4% q/q (vs just 0.1% in Q1). Cable has duly extended gains above 1.3300 towards 1.3400, while Eur/Gbp has retreated from almost 0.8800 to sub-0.8750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is outperforming its antipodean peer after disappointing Aussie current account data overnight and no change whatsoever in the RBA&rsquo;s wait-and-see stance on policy rates after the latest meeting. Aud/Nzd is back down below 1.08500, while Nzd/Usd is consolidating gains above 0.7000 and Aud/Usd has eased back a bit further from Monday&rsquo;s peaks above 0.7660. GDP data tomorrow may give the Aud more direction, but ahead of that it&rsquo;s GDT for the Kiwi, albeit with futures not suggesting much move in auction prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/EUR/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All keeping tabs with big figure levels vs the Usd with the Franc not straying too far from 0.9900, Loonie staying close to 1.2900, Eur/Usd pivoting 1.1700 and Usd/Jpy still capped around 110.00. For the single currency especially, a band of option expiries spanning 1.1675-1.1750 and totalling 5 bn looks set to keep the pair rangebound barring any other significant driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Peso is a notable laggard with Usd/Mxn back over 20.000 after Mexico upped the trade war ante vs the US buy proposing a 20% tax on pork, while raising objections via the WTO in response to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK debt and STIRs were right to tread more cautiously in the run up to the 3rd and final PMI given another headline beat to complete a clean sweep and best composite reading of 2018, with Gilts down to fresh Liffe lows in response at 122.43 (-30 ticks vs +13 ticks at one stage), while Short Sterling futures are now as much as 3 ticks adrift vs +2 ticks at best. May&rsquo;s PMIs are highly unlikely to prompt a knee-jerk reaction from the BoE, but will instil some tightening premium back into markets that have become dormant on rate hike prospects after May&rsquo;s dovish MPC hold. Note, Bunds have also recoiled from earlier Eurex peaks that reached 161.23 (+34 ticks) to around 161.00, as Italian BTPs stabilise off their base, while US Treasuries are mid-range in relatively lacklustre overnight trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are trading mixed today with WTI (+USD 0.3) and Brent (+USD 0.2) higher as markets focus more on the key OPEC+ meeting on June 22nd. Energy ministers did initially signal a rise in output to offset supply disruptions from Iranian and Venezuelan sanctions but then switched rhetoric at the unofficial OPEC+ meeting over the weekend. An official restriction ease is still anyone&rsquo;s guess. Meanwhile, participants await the latest stockpile count with API inventories due after-hours. Elsewhere, in the metals complex, the yellow metal takes a breather with little price change following three consecutive days in the red. Dalian iron ore futures rise despite record stockpiles after reports Tangshan (China&rsquo;s number 1 steelmaking city) is to shut 226 mining companies. Furthermore, copper rose for a fourth consecutive session to its highest in almost six weeks as the red metal is underpinned by potential supply disruptions amid wage talks at the world&rsquo;s largest mine.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>UK debt and STIRs were right to tread more cautiously in the run up to the 3rd and final PMI given another headline beat to complete a clean sweep and best composite reading of 2018, with Gilts down to fresh Liffe lows in response at 122.43 (-30 ticks vs +13 ticks at one stage), while Short Sterling futures are now as much as 3 ticks adrift vs +2 ticks at best. May&rsquo;s PMIs are highly unlikely to prompt a knee-jerk reaction from the BoE, but will instil some tightening premium back into markets that have become dormant on rate hike prospects after May&rsquo;s dovish MPC hold. Note, Bunds have also recoiled from earlier Eurex peaks that reached 161.23 (+34 ticks) to around 161.00, as Italian BTPs stabilise off their base, while US Treasuries are mid-range in relatively lacklustre overnight trade.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.3%) was negative with the index weighed by the energy sector after oil prices briefly slipped to below USD 65.00/bbl and with Retail Food Group the worst performer in the index after it flagged a statutory net loss due to termination payments. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) remained afloat following the recent currency weakness, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.2%) were choppy as participants mulled over a mild liquidity drain as well as inconclusive Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI data which were unchanged from the prior month. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid similar quiet trade in T-notes and the indecisiveness in the region, while the10yr JGB auction failed to provide a catalyst as the results were mixed which added to the sombre tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Services PMI (May) 52.9 vs. Exp. 52.9 (Prev. 52.9). (Newswires)<br />Chinese Caixin Composite PMI (May) 52.3 (Prev. 52.3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 70bln via 7-day and CNY 50bln via 28-day reverse repos, for a net daily drain of CNY 30bln. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.4157 (Prev. 6.4208)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&rsquo;s Tenreyro (Neutral) said a few rate increases are needed and that timing is an open question, while she expects gradual tightening of monetary policy will be needed over the next three years. Furthermore, Tenreyro added that future policy changes can act as substitutes for immediate change and that weakness in UK economy in Q1 likely to be erratic but does raise the possibility of some underlying subdued demand. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May reportedly abandoned plans to present UK-EU blueprint before this month&#39;s summit in Brussels and will now postpone its release to after the summit. (FT) Elsewhere, there were separate source reports which stated UK PM May and ministers was said to have told business leaders a decision on the preferred customs option post-Brexit was &#39;imminent&#39;. (Newswires) Business executives have warned UK PM May that clarity is needed on the government&rsquo;s post-Brexit plans to help them prepare their companies after UK departs from the EU. Leading firms including Tesco (TSCO LN), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK LN) and BAE Systems (BA/ LN) said more information was needed on issues such as customs arrangements. (The Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May has a week to forge a compromise with Conservative party backbenchers that are threatening to defeat the government on post-Brexit customs arrangement legislation which are to be voted on next Tuesday. (The Times) There were also separate reports that UK PM May is under fire regarding attempts to overturn all 15 House of Lords defeats of the EU withdrawal bill in a single day when the bill returns to the House of Commons next week. (Independent)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Trade Minister Liam Fox said the response to US steel and aluminium tariffs must be measured and that the UK is to take safeguard measures to prevent steel dumping on the UK, which could be in place by the middle of July. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK BRC Retail Sales YY (May) 2.80% (Prev. -4.20%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most major pairs have been range-bound overnight and the DXY flat around the 94.00 level. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD traded sideways in which the latter languished in proximity to retest the prior day&rsquo;s lows around the 1.3300 level. This was amid the usual Brexit-related toing and froing, as the latest reports stated that PM May scrapped plans to present the UK-EU blueprint before this month&#39;s summit in Brussels and is also said to be under fire over attempts to overturn all 15 House of Lords defeats of the EU withdrawal bill next Tuesday. Elsewhere, antipodeans have held on to most of the prior day&rsquo;s gains although AUD/USD is off best levels following a miss on Current Account and Net Exports of GDP data, as well as an unsurprising RBA rate decision in which the central bank kept rates unchanged as expected and reiterated its prior statements which continued to suggest a prolonged pause by the central bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA kept the Cash Rate unchanged at 1.50% as expected and reiterated that low level of rates continues to support the economy and that the board judged policy is consistent with sustainable economic growth and reaching the inflation target. Furthermore, the RBA also repeated that inflation and wage growth likely to remain low for a while and that a strengthening currency would result in slower pick up of growth and inflation.<br /><br />Australian Current Account Balance (Q1) -10.50B vs. Exp. -9.95B (Prev. -14.00B, Rev. -14.70B). (Newswires)<br />Australian Net Exports Contribution (Q1) 0.30% vs. Exp. 0.50% (Prev. -0.50%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed overnight in which WTI crude futures nursed the prior day&rsquo;s losses in which prices briefly slipped to below USD 65.00/bbl in a continued pullback from multi year highs, while participants now await the latest stockpile counts with API inventories due after-hours later. Elsewhere, gold was flat amid an uneventful greenback and copper saw mild profit taking alongside a predominantly indecisive overnight risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US partially eased sanctions against Deripaska&#39;s EN+ Group. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Iran nuclear official Kamalvandi said Tehran will inform the UN atomic agency regarding beginning of capacity increase for uranium gas production. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were lower on Monday as political turmoil settled in Europe following last week&rsquo;s events in Italy and Spain. Yields were higher but off their multi-year peaks as trade fear remains in investors&rsquo; minds. Volume in the complex was average in a quiet session; the yield curve saw some modest bear flattening with 2yr and 5yr yields higher by c.4bps and 30yr higher by c.3bps, but major spreads across the curve were pretty much unchanged at settlement. US 10yr T-notes futures (Sep 2018) settled 11 ticks lower at 119-26+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico is to impose a 20% tariff on pork legs and shoulder from US as part of its retaliation to US metal tariffs, while there were earlier reports that Mexico will start a dispute settlement process at the WTO regarding US tariffs on steel and aluminium.

        "content": "<p><strong>EXPECTATIONS:&nbsp;</strong>The RBA rate decision is due on Tuesday morning, and expectations are one-sided for the central bank to keep policy on hold. This has been reflected in the ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures, &nbsp;which price in 100% expectations for the central bank to keep the Cash Rate Target unchanged at the record low 1.50%, while the associated implied yield curve suggests June 2019 as the earliest date for when the central bank would be leaning more towards a 25bps rate hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RECENT RHETORIC:&nbsp;</strong>The rhetoric from the central bank continues to point to no near-term policy adjustments; the latest central bank Statement on Monetary Policy and minutes from the prior meeting reiterated that the board sees no strong case for a near-term change in rates, and that the next move would likely be a hike rather than a cut. The RBA also expects inflation to remain subdued for some time due to retail competition and slow growth in wages. This view on rates has been continuously repeated by the top echelon at the bank, including Governor Lowe and Deputy Governor Debelle, while board member Harper also suggested that the Bank has a &lsquo;steady as she goes&rsquo; stance on policy, and that a recovery in wage growth will be a long haul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RECENT ECONOMIC DATA:</strong>&nbsp;Q1 Wage Price was softer than expected at 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.6%) which limits scope for the RBA to begin hiking rates considering the central bank has cited slow wages as a factor for the subdued inflation. In addition, Capital Expenditure for Q1 (0.4% vs. Exp. 1.0%) and Building Approvals for April (1.9% vs. Exp. 4.1%) have also fallen short of estimates. Conversely, jobs data was more encouraging with better than expected Employment Change (Apr) 22.6k vs. Exp. 20.0k (Prev. 4.9k, Rev. -0.7k) and although the unemployment rate unexpectedly increased, this coincided with a higher Participation Rate and there was an overall better quality of jobs growth as it was solely fuelled by Full-Time work. There was also more recent data released at the start of the week in which Retail Sales, Company Profits and Business Inventories topped estimates which could provide some encouragement ahead of the GDP number this Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MARKET REACTION:&nbsp;</strong>The announcement is scheduled for 0530BST and is not expected to have a major impact on markets with the RBA unanimously expected to keep policy on hold as they have been doing since 2016. However, participants will still be eyeing the policy statement for any deviation from the central banks regular statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RECENT BANK CALLS:</strong>&nbsp;CBA pushed back forecasts for RBA rate hike to February 2019 from Prev. forecast of November 2018. NAB pushed back RBA rate hike forecast to mid-2019 from Prev. forecast of November 2018.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) remains afloat following the recent currency weakness, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.3%) are lacklustre as participants mull over a mild liquidity drain as well as inconclusive Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI data which printed inline with the prior month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price action in FX markets has left much to be desired with most major pairs range-bound overnight and the DXY flat around the 94.00 level. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD have traded sideways so far with the latter languishing in proximity to retest the prior day&rsquo;s lows around the 1.3300 level. This is amid the usual Brexit-related toing and froing, with the latest reports stating that PM May scrapped plans to present the UK-EU blueprint before this month&#39;s summit in Brussels and is also said to be under fire over attempts to overturn all 15 House of Lords defeats of the EU withdrawal bill in a single day when the bill returns to the House of Commons next Tuesday. Elsewhere, antipodeans have held on to most of the prior day&rsquo;s gains despite a mild bout of pressure in AUD/USD following a miss on Current Account and Net Exports of GDP data, although this was only brief as focus for the currency remains on today&rsquo;s RBA rate decision and tomorrow&rsquo;s Q1 GDP numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid similar quiet trade in T-notes and the indecisiveness in the region, while a looming 10yr JGB auction later also adds to the sombre tone.</p>\r\n",
