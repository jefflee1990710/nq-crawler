He also noted that China is to open up its manufacturing sector and said that opening up measures may exceed global expectations. He also reiterated that the priority for the nation is to bring down its leverage ratio. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is to start AUD/USD &amp; other FX swaps trading on 5th February.

He also added that he was not concerned by reports that China was considering easing its purchases of US Treasuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following Mnuchin&rsquo;s comments, Commerce Secretary Ross, also speaking from Davos, said US authorities were investigating whether there is scope to take action against China for intellectual property infringements, arguing that its technology policies were a &ldquo;direct threat&rdquo; to the US, giving rise to fears of a full-blown trade war between the two nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Home Prices MM (Nov) 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.5%, Rev. 0.6%).

According to ZeroHedge, Goldman Sachs calculates the larest equity sell imbalance since 1995, with $34.4bln for sale; Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s model expects $70bln of outflows from equities (and $62bln inflows into fixed income), while Credit Suisse also released similar research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US shares came under further pressure after a 5-year auction tailed, despite slightly better cover demand. But after the post-auction selling, the ever-reliable buy-the-dip traders emerged, sending bourses back to flat levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some profit taking after a run of record highs was also cited for the selling pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />TREASURIES: US 10-Year T-Note futures settle 7 ticks lower at 122-06+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury prices fell on Wednesday after US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin endorsed a weak US dollar, resulting in the curve bear steepening. The steeper curve contributed to some modest widening of curve spreads (2s30s was slightly wider, as was 5s30s at settlement), however, 2s5s and 2s10s saw some (again, modest) narrowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US auctioned $34bln of 5-year notes in an average sale, tailing by 0.4bps despite better cover than the prior auction. Internals were mostly in-line with recent averages, though the auction was, perhaps, not as bad as some had feared given today&rsquo;s steeper Treasury curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Draghi stated that the APP has not led to statistically significant euro exchange rate movements.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank&rsquo;s Floden says that the bank still needs to pursue very expansionary monetary policy in order to push inflation up although, then added that everything points to the Riksbank being able to raise rates before the ECB. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FOREX: USD slammed after Mnuchin welcomes weakness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s dollar weakness was inspired from protectionist rhetoric from the US Treasury Secretary in Davos, where he welcomed the buck&rsquo;s weakness, arguing that it was positive for trade, seemingly abandoning the long-held US position of a strong USD. The result was the Dollar Index falling to three-year lows, while the yen strength continues, sending USDJPY to 109.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The greenback&rsquo;s weakness flattered other FX, with the EUR continuing its ascent ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s ECB, topping 1.24 against the dollar. Separately, the latest batch of PMI data show that, despite weakness in manufacturing, composite PMIs are now at 12-year highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pound, meanwhile, took advantage of the dollar weakness to trade above 1.42, helped along by a decent labour market report which showed wages rising more than expected (though still remain in negative real growth)(. EURGBP seems to be finding it a challenge to breach 0.87, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BRL got a boost after all three Brazil appeal court judges uphold former President Lula corruption conviction, in a blow to his political comeback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold continued its assent on USD weakness, trading above $1360 at one point, while USDCHF fell beneath the 0.95 mark.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI futures settle $1.14 higher at $65.61 per barrel; Brent futures settle 57 cents higher $70.53 per barrel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude firmed on Wednesday after EIA data showed that crude stocks drew down in the week. Some had expect a build after the API on Tuesday reported stocks had gained in the week. Crude production, meanwhile, rose by 1.3% to 9.878mln barrels per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude also was supported by a weaker dollar, and the result was the backwardation between the front-month and the second month widened to 29 cents, the largest since October 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s jawboning was predominantly provided by the Saudi energy minister and his Russian counterpart. The former said that he is still expecting the oil market to rebalance by Q3 2018, and argued that US shale output was not a threat to the market dynamics since higher production in the US was being offset by shrinking supplies in Mexico and Venezuela. The Saudi Energy minister warned, however, that a glut could return if the market was out of balance &ldquo;for a few months&rdquo;, and added that it was unlikely that the supply cut policy will be exited in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Russian energy minister&rsquo;s comments were in a similar vein, striking a unified position with his Saudi counterpart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks (w/e) -1.071M vs. Exp. -1.600M (Prev. -6.861M); Crude production rose 1.31% to 9.878mln bpd.

Stocks (w/e) 0.639mln (Exp. -1.471mln, Prev. -3.887mln)<br />- EIA Weekly Gasoline Stocks 3.098mln (w/e) (Exp. 2.486mln, Prev. 3.620mln)<br />- EIA Weekly Crude Cushing -3.150mln (w/e) (Prev. -4.184mln)<br />- EIA Weekly Refining Util -2.1% (w/e) (Exp. -1.3%, Prev. -2.3%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia intends to keep their Q1 crude oil productions 9.8mln bpd, and exports around 7mln bpd, despite planned domestic refinery maintenance. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih says US oil boom is not a threat as Mexico and Venezuela output is declining, also says he doesn&rsquo;t see any signs of significant slowing in oil demand. He added that the oil glut could return if the market is out of balance for a few months, and as a result it is highly unlikely that we will exit cuts in June. He also stated that there will be a moment when the production cuts can be adjusted and that producers will have to decide on a new inventory target and discuss slow exit from the deal so markets aren&rsquo;t shocked. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Saudi Aramco CEO expects oil markets to balance by the end of 2018. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Energy Minister Novak said that OPEC+ expects the opil market to rebalance in Q3/Q4 2018. He also suggested that&nbsp; consultations should go beyond OPEC+ and include the US 6 months-year after deal expires (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Energy Secretary said that the shale oil boom won&#39;t be a spoiler for oil markets as demand rises.

        "content": "<p>US PROTECTIONIST COMMENTARY: &lsquo;America First&rsquo; sparks fears of trade wars</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In pre-market trade, US Secretary Mnuchin, speaking from Davos, received attention when he said that a weaker US dollar was good for US trade, which heaped pressure on the buck. He also added that he was not concerned by reports that China was considering easing its purchases of US Treasuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following Mnuchin&rsquo;s comments, Commerce Secretary Ross, also speaking from Davos, said US authorities were investigating whether there is scope to take action against China for intellectual property infringements, arguing that its technology policies were a &ldquo;direct threat&rdquo; to the US, giving rise to fears of a full-blown trade war between the two nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES: SPX -0.1% at 2838, NDX -0.6% at 6919, DJI +0.2% at 26265</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top sectors: Telecom +0.7%, Financials +0.7%, Consumer Discretionary +0.4%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom sectors: IT -0.9%, Utilities -0.6%, Energy -0.2%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protectionist messages from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Ross at Davos soured equity traders sentiment in pre-market trade, and major equity indices tumbled on the cash open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, a few bank equity research desks published analysis suggesting that pension companies will have to sell down their US equity holdings heading into month-end to ensure appropriate asset allocation. According to ZeroHedge, Goldman Sachs calculates the larest equity sell imbalance since 1995, with $34.4bln for sale; Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s model expects $70bln of outflows from equities (and $62bln inflows into fixed income), while Credit Suisse also released similar research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US shares came under further pressure after a 5-year auction tailed, despite slightly better cover demand. But after the post-auction selling, the ever-reliable buy-the-dip traders emerged, sending bourses back to flat levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some profit taking after a run of record highs was also cited for the selling pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREASURIES: US 10-Year T-Note futures settle 7 ticks lower at 122-06+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury prices fell on Wednesday after US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin endorsed a weak US dollar, resulting in the curve bear steepening. The steeper curve contributed to some modest widening of curve spreads (2s30s was slightly wider, as was 5s30s at settlement), however, 2s5s and 2s10s saw some (again, modest) narrowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US auctioned $34bln of 5-year notes in an average sale, tailing by 0.4bps despite better cover than the prior auction. Internals were mostly in-line with recent averages, though the auction was, perhaps, not as bad as some had feared given today&rsquo;s steeper Treasury curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FOREX: USD slammed after Mnuchin welcomes weakness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s dollar weakness was inspired from protectionist rhetoric from the US Treasury Secretary in Davos, where he welcomed the buck&rsquo;s weakness, arguing that it was positive for trade, seemingly abandoning the long-held US position of a strong USD. The result was the Dollar Index falling to three-year lows, while the yen strength continues, sending USDJPY to 109.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The greenback&rsquo;s weakness flattered other FX, with the EUR continuing its ascent ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s ECB, topping 1.24 against the dollar. Separately, the latest batch of PMI data show that, despite weakness in manufacturing, composite PMIs are now at 12-year highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pound, meanwhile, took advantage of the dollar weakness to trade above 1.42, helped along by a decent labour market report which showed wages rising more than expected (though still remain in negative real growth)(. EURGBP seems to be finding it a challenge to breach 0.87, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BRL got a boost after all three Brazil appeal court judges uphold former President Lula corruption conviction, in a blow to his political comeback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold continued its assent on USD weakness, trading above $1360 at one point, while USDCHF fell beneath the 0.95 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRUDE: WTI futures settle $1.14 higher at $65.61 per barrel; Brent futures settle 57 cents higher $70.53 per barrel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude firmed on Wednesday after EIA data showed that crude stocks drew down in the week. Some had expect a build after the API on Tuesday reported stocks had gained in the week. Crude production, meanwhile, rose by 1.3% to 9.878mln barrels per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude also was supported by a weaker dollar, and the result was the backwardation between the front-month and the second month widened to 29 cents, the largest since October 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s jawboning was predominantly provided by the Saudi energy minister and his Russian counterpart. The former said that he is still expecting the oil market to rebalance by Q3 2018, and argued that US shale output was not a threat to the market dynamics since higher production in the US was being offset by shrinking supplies in Mexico and Venezuela. The Saudi Energy minister warned, however, that a glut could return if the market was out of balance &ldquo;for a few months&rdquo;, and added that it was unlikely that the supply cut policy will be exited in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Russian energy minister&rsquo;s comments were in a similar vein, striking a unified position with his Saudi counterpart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PRIMER: The bank desks weigh in on New Zealand's Q4 CPI release, due at 21:45 GMT",
        "content": "<p><strong>ANZ: </strong>We expect headline CPI inflation to hold steady at 1.9% y/y in Q4. That is a touch above the RBNZ&rsquo;s expectations. Some of the more volatile components (food, petrol and airfares) will make broadly offsetting contributions. Housing will again contribute positively, but evidence of a broadening in domestic price increases will remain tentative at best. Core inflation measures are likely to be stable around 1&frac12;-2%. We still expect domestic inflation to rise gradually in time. However, questions over when and how aggressively this occurs will likely remain unanswered by these figures, keeping the RBNZ side-lined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASB: </strong>We expect the CPI to print at 0.5% qoq in Q4 with annual CPI inflation firming to 2.0% (the second time annual inflation has reached at least 2% in the last year). This lift reflects of a number of one-off movements, rather than stronger underlying inflation. For example, the sharp jump in petrol prices over the quarter accounts for nearly half of the quarter&rsquo;s lift in inflation. On top of that, the shift to updated CPI weightings added to Q4 inflation, at the margin. A contained backdrop for overall inflation should encourage a prolonged period of stability in OCR settings. The next move in the OCR is most likely to be up, but this still looks to be a 2019 story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BNZ: </strong>We are in line with the market in expecting a 0.4% increase for the quarter, leaving annual inflation at 1.9%. The RBNZ, in its November Monetary Policy Statement, expected annual CPI inflation of 1.8% (based on 0.3% for the quarter). This involved non- tradables inflation decelerating to 2.4%, from 2.6% in Q3, and tradables inflation remaining at 1.0% y/y. It will also pay to check the range of &ldquo;official&rdquo; core inflation measures for Q4, especially the sectoral factor model version produced and favoured by the RBNZ, which, at 1.4% y/y in Q3, was obviously lagging the others. Providing the Q4 CPI doesn&rsquo;t shock, the debate will turn to how the NZ CPI will print in the early stages of 2018. In particular, that there is a good chance its annual rate of inflation will slow in Q1 2018 &ndash; simply because a stocky quarterly result from Q1 2017 will be dropping out of the calculations. We expect CPI inflation to dip to 1.5% y/y in Q1, for instance, and stay there in Q2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HSBC: </strong>We expect annual headline CPI inflation to lift slightly, with the major positive influence being a 6% rise in petrol prices seen in the quarter. Beyond that, inflation is likely to remain fairly subdued, with housing costs the only area of clear upward pressure. We expect a further modest lift in the measures of underlying inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TD Securities: </strong>The new lower weight for fuel (8.7% to 6.4%) lowered our Q4 CPI forecast from +0.4% to +0.3%/q. Food we already know fell -1.6%/q (and has a higher weight at 19.3%). Housing is always robust, and fuel boosts Private transport by +3.5%/q. Expect a seasonal jump in airfares (Public transport +7.4%/q) and otherwise, health and education are neutral for the Dec quarter. We find ourselves at the dovish end of the market spectrum, but this is no way detracts from our view that the process-paralyzed RBNZ is increasingly behind the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Westpac: </strong>We estimate that consumer prices rose by 0.4% in the December quarter, led by higher fuel prices and other transport costs. This would keep the annual inflation rate at 1.9%, very near the 2% midpoint of the Reserve Bank&rsquo;s target range. Excluding the volatile food and fuel categories, we expect annual inflation to remain at a more modest 1.6%. Our forecast is slightly higher than the Reserve Bank&rsquo;s pick of 0.3% for the quarter, although the difference is in the more persistent non&ndash;tradable categories where an upside surprise would be more significant. The December quarter release will incorporate Stat NZ&rsquo;s Three - yearly reweighting of the basket of goods and services that make up the CPI. However, the new weights have had very little impact on our inflation forecast.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The Usd sank to new 2018 and even longer lows against all major counterparts and more, with the broad selling intensified after comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin acknowledging the trade benefits of a weaker currency. Even some back-tracking via Commerce Secretary Ross failed to really stem the tide and the last straw for the beleaguered Greenback came in the form of sub-forecast existing home sales. So called key, psychological and chart levels simply gave way amidst the waves of Dollar selling and the DXY is now looking at 0.8900 having only just grip of the 90.000 handle. For the record, next on the tech &lsquo;support&rsquo; front is 88.921 and 88.510, but in the current situation these may be irrelevant. Indeed, Eur/Usd is close to 1.2400 having breezed through a supposed major Fib at 1.2377, and only the ECB meeting seems to be stalling more upside on the basis that President Draghi may attempt to talk the single currency back down. Cable is above 1.4200, Usd/Jpy on the brink of falling below 109.00 (109.07 another chart level perceived to be key) and Usd/Chf near 0.9400 (0.9421 is the 2017 base). The antipodeans are also benefiting from their namesake&rsquo;s travails with Aud/Usd approaching 0.8100 (0.8125 is last year&rsquo;s high) and Nzd/Usd around 0.7425 (very close to &lsquo;resistance&rsquo; in the 0.7430-35 area) ahead of NZ CPI data tonight.</p>\r\n",

But as long as job creation remains as strong as in the latest print, any increase in unemployment will be limited. New jobs despite lower GDP growth will raise fresh doubts regarding the outlook for productivity and wages over the medium to long run. In other words, if productivity fails to recover in line with even the most cautious forecasts, wage growth at the current level would already be consistent with accelerating labour costs and might support further rate hikes by the BoE. Alternatively, as presented by MPC Ramsden, the rise in uncertainty may have triggered an increase in risk aversion from households who now prioritise jobs versus pay. In that case, job growth and pay weakness could persist as long as uncertainty prevails.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, a cautious tone was seen in Chinese markets with the <strong>Hang Seng (-0.1%) </strong>and<strong> </strong>the<strong> Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%)</strong> choppy alongside early weakness in Shenzhen, as ChiNext heavyweight Leshi Internet &amp; Tech Co. returned from a 9-month trading halt to hit limit down with losses of 10% at the open. Finally, 10yr JGBs were range-bound as initial support from a risk averse tone was later pared, while the BoJ were also in the JGB market for between 1yr-10yr maturities with all the amounts of its Rinban operation kept unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 110bln via 7-day, CNY 100bln via 14-day and CNY 10bln via 63-day reverse repos.

In terms of outliers from an index perspective, the <strong>FSTE 100 (-0.5%) </strong>lags<strong> </strong>its peers amid a firmer GBP and softness in Sage shares (-5.5%) after a disappointing earnings update. Looking at the sectors, health care names outperform their peers following the latest earnings update from Novartis (+2.4%), to the downside, utility names lag after Suez Environment (-17%) issued a profit warning, IT names are also seen lower with Infineon and STMicroelectronics near the foot of the DAX and CAC respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>USD</strong> has succumbed to yet more selling pressure, and right across the board as the Greenback&rsquo;s losses stack up against G10 peers, EM currencies and commodities. The <strong>USD</strong> was dealt a further blow during European trade after US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stated that the weaker <strong>USD</strong> is good for trade. The Index is below layered chart &lsquo;supports&rsquo; under 90.000 and now looking at 89.370 to potentially arrest the slide before the next round number. In terms of <strong>USD</strong> pairings, the 110.00 handle vs <strong>JPY</strong> has given way and 109.56 ahead of 109.07 are now within sight, while Cable has extended post-Brexit vote highs above the 1.4000 level to around 1.4075 and briefly broke above 1.4100 following the latest jobs report with UK employment at a record high. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> has probed a bit further beyond 1.2300 to 1.2345, but displaying some caution ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s ECB meet and a Fib level at 1.2377. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>CAD</strong> has dipped below 1.2400 amidst some constructive NAFTA noises after the 1st day of the latest round of talks and 1.2355 is the nearest support/recent low. <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>CHF</strong> has also breached its previous January base and 0.9500 is within sight, while <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> are both on track to post fresh year-to-date peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gilts</strong> have lead the latest downturn in core debt, and knee-jerked below nearest chart support at 123.12 to a new Liffe low at 123.08, which suggests that the psychological 123.00 level will be next on the radar for bears. Similarly, the 1.40% cash yield is being tested on the back of some much better than anticipated elements of the latest UK jobs and earnings release. <strong>Bunds</strong> have been dragged down in sympathy and also through some near term tech levels on the way to a fresh 160.51 Eurex base, with Monday&rsquo;s low now in sight. <strong>US Treasuries</strong> just off overnight troughs and awaiting more supply along with a busier data schedule, but bonds still relatively calm and rangebound in comparison to the action in FX markets where the USD continues to collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WTI crude futures trade in close proximity to the lows seen yesterday in the wake of the latest API inventory report</strong> which showed an unexpected build in headline crude stockpiles. Elsewhere in energy newsflow, source reports suggest that Saudi Arabia intend on keeping their Q1 crude oil production at 9.8mln bpd and exports at around 7mln bpd, despite planned domestic refinery maintenance. In metals markets, despite being relatively rangebound overnight, <strong>gold</strong> has benefitted during European trade from the broad softness in the USD. Elsewhere <strong>copper</strong> nursed some of its recent losses during Asia-Pac trade amid touted short-covering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US API weekly crude stocks (19 Jan, w/e) +4.755M vs. Exp. -1.600M (Prev. -5.120M).</strong> (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia intend on keeping their Q1 crude oil productions 9.8mln bpd, and exports around 7mln bpd, despite planned domestic refinery maintenance.

        "content": "<p>European equities (Eurostoxx 50 -0.1%) trade with little in the way of firm direction in the wake of what was a relatively mixed session during Asia-Pac trade. In terms of outliers from an index perspective, the FSTE 100 (-0.5%) lags its peers amid a firmer GBP and softness in Sage shares (-5.5%) after a disappointing earnings update. Looking at the sectors, health care names outperform their peers following the latest earnings update from Novartis (+2.4%), to the downside, utility names lag after Suez Environment (-17%) issued a profit warning, IT names are also seen lower with Infineon and STMicroelectronics near the foot of the DAX and CAC respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD has succumbed to yet more selling pressure, and right across the board as the Greenback&rsquo;s losses stack up against G10 peers, EM currencies and commodities. The USD was dealt a further blow during European trade after US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stated that the weaker USD is good for trade. The Index is below layered chart &lsquo;supports&rsquo; under 90.000 and now looking at 89.370 to potentially arrest the slide before the next round number. In terms of USD pairings, the 110.00 handle vs JPY has given way and 109.56 ahead of 109.07 are now within sight, while Cable has extended post-Brexit vote highs above the 1.4000 level to around 1.4075 and briefly broke above 1.4100 following the latest jobs report with UK employment at a record high. EUR/USD has probed a bit further beyond 1.2300 to 1.2345, but displaying some caution ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s ECB meet and a Fib level at 1.2377. USD/CAD has dipped below 1.2400 amidst some constructive NAFTA noises after the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;day of the latest round of talks and 1.2355 is the nearest support/recent low. USD/CHF has also breached its previous January base and 0.9500 is within sight, while AUD/USD and NZD/USD are both on track to post fresh year-to-date peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts have lead the latest downturn in core debt, and knee-jerked below nearest chart support at 123.12 to a new Liffe low at 123.08, which suggests that the psychological 123.00 level will be next on the radar for bears. Similarly, the 1.40% cash yield is being tested on the back of some much better than anticipated elements of the latest UK jobs and earnings release. Bunds have been dragged down in sympathy and also through some near term tech levels on the way to a fresh 160.51 Eurex base, with Monday&rsquo;s low now in sight. US Treasuries just off overnight troughs and awaiting more supply along with a busier data schedule, but bonds still relatively calm and rangebound in comparison to the action in FX markets where the USD continues to collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI crude futures trade in close proximity to the lows seen yesterday in the wake of the latest API inventory report which showed an unexpected build in headline crude stockpiles. Elsewhere in energy newsflow, source reports suggest that Saudi Arabia intend on keeping their Q1 crude oil production at 9.8mln bpd and exports at around 7mln bpd, despite planned domestic refinery maintenance. In metals markets, despite being relatively rangebound overnight, gold has benefitted during European trade from the broad softness in the USD. Elsewhere copper nursed some of its recent losses during Asia-Pac trade amid touted short-covering.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PRIMER: The bank desks weigh in on the upcoming UK Labour Market Report, due at 09:30 GMT",
        "content": "<p><strong>Barclays: </strong>We expect the unemployment rate to remain largely unchanged, reflecting increasing claimant counts and a marginally growing workforce. Meanwhile, we expect wages to grow at the same pace as the previous month (2.5%y/y for headline and 2.3% for core AWE).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Daiwa:</strong>&nbsp;The latest labour market data on Wednesday may show that employment continued falling towards the end of the year, by 25k in the three months to November, less than the 56k reduction in October. And given additional evidence that activity in the labour market is losing momentum, the headline unemployment rate is set to have remained unchanged at 4.3% for a fourth consecutive month, having fallen by 0.4ppt over the first half of 2017. Average earnings growth is expected to have remained at 2.5%3M/Y, below the rate of CPI inflation, and thus implying that real incomes continued to contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HSBC: </strong>Pay growth picked up a little in the three months to October, and we expect it to maintain its pace in the three months to November &ndash; albeit remaining some way below inflation. Unemployment was unchanged at 4.3%, its lowest since 1975 and the level at which it has stood since July 2017. That said, there were some early signs of job trends starting to turn, with employment down by 56k over the three months to October, and the claimant count rising for the third consecutive month in November. This, therefore may be the focus of the November release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nomura: </strong>Base effects (a reasonably large rise in monthly earnings a year ago) could hold back the annual rates of average wage growth in this report. Still, we expect the trend in earnings growth to generally be upwards over this year and expect it to end the year around 3% (a similar view to that expressed by MPC member Michael Saunders in a speech this week). Productivity growth will inevitably need to improve if wages are to perform better over a more prolonged period of time, of course. We see no change in the unemployment rate, currently standing at 4.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBC: </strong>Generally, the employment intentions surveys have been more upbeat than the actual ONS data in recent months. So whilst the survey evidence tells us it is too soon to get carried away with recent declines in the official measure of employment, it would represent a very strong outturn if the 3m/3m employment change recovered to a positive reading, after a decline of 56k last time. The arithmetic points to the unemployment rate holding at 4.3% this time. For average earnings we expect both the including- and excluding-bonus measures of growth to ease 0.1ppt to 2.4% 3m/y and 2.2% 3m/y, respectively. The more sensitive news for markets on pay growth is likely to come when the MPC update their expectations at the February Inflation Report in light of the regional agents&rsquo; annual pay settlements survey.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mixed following an unconvincing close on Wall St. where all majors posted fresh record highs and the Nasdaq 100 outperformed as Netflix led post-earnings, although DJIA failed to hold onto gains and finished flat. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) were varied with Japanese exporter sentiment weighed by a firmer currency and following a miss on trade data. Elsewhere, a cautious tone was seen in Chinese markets with mild profit taking in the Hang Seng (-0.1%) and the Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) was choppy alongside early weakness in Shenzhen, as ChiNext heavyweight Leshi Internet &amp; Tech Co. returned from a 9-month trading halt to hit limit down with losses of 10% at the open. Finally, 10yr JGBs were range-bound as initial support from a risk averse tone was later pared, while the BoJ were also in the JGB market for between 1yr-10yr maturities with all the amounts of its Rinban operation kept unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD woes persisted in which the DXY slipped to below 90.00 for the first time since late 2014. This underpinned its major counterparts with EUR/USD supported at 1.2300 and in which GBP/USD gained a firmer footing above 1.4000, while the PBoC also took a swipe and set a firmer reference rate of below 6.4000 for the first time since December 4th 2015. Elsewhere, a subdued risk tone facilitated flows into safe-haven JPY and alongside the underperformance in the greenback, resulted to a breakdown of the 110.00 handle for USD/JPY.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed following an unconvincing close on Wall St. where all majors posted fresh record highs and the Nasdaq 100 outperformed as Netflix led post-earnings, although DJIA failed to hold onto gains and finished flat. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) are mixed with Japanese exporter sentiment weighed by a firmer currency and following a miss on trade data. Elsewhere, Chinese markets are cautious with profit taking in the Hang Seng (-0.3%) and the Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) pared most its early gains alongside weakness in Shenzhen, as ChiNext heavyweight Leshi Internet &amp; Tech Co. returned from a 9-month trading halt to hit limit down with losses of 10% at the open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD woes persisted in which the DXY briefly slipped to below the 90.00 level for the first time since late 2014. This underpinned its major counterparts with EUR/USD finding support at 1.2300 and with GBP/USD gaining a firmer footing above 1.4000, while the PBoC also took a swipe and set a firmer reference rate of below 6.4000 for the first time since December 4<sup>th</sup> 2015. Elsewhere, a subdued risk tone facilitated flows into safe-haven JPY and alongside the underperformance in the greenback, resulted to a breakdown of the 110.00 handle for USD/JPY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid a risk averse tone and after a BoJ Rinban announcement in which the central bank maintained its purchase amounts for 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",
