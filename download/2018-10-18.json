It noted government spending growth planned for next year is 2.7%, while the maximum allowed under rules is 0.1%; it also highlighted the country&rsquo;s structural deficit in 2019 would deepen by 0.8% of GDP (note an EU minister had asked for it to be cut by 0.6%/GDP). In addition to this, EU commissioner Moscovici stated that EU&#39;s 2019 budget deficit can&#39;t stay at 2.4% while European Commission VP Dombrovskis noted Italy&#39;s fiscal trajectory is not appropriate. In response, Italian PM Conte noted that leaders showed an &quot;appreciation&quot; on the Italian budget and argued that Italy&#39;s deviation from fiscal targets is not large. He also announced the government are to meet on Saturday to discuss the budget and tax issues. Similarly, Italy&#39;s Economy Minister Tria said to expect a constructive dialogue with the EU and is hopeful that they can narrow differences; he stressed once again the budget aims to increase growth and reduce debt/GDP ratio. ECB&#39;s Nowotny warned that the interest on Italian 10-year debt have risen significantly, which is a clear warning sign from the markets. Elsewhere, in earlier reports Italian Deputy PM Salvini said he is considering running for EU Commission&#39;s presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> UK PM May said good progress has been made in Brexit talks at the EU Summit, though noting she could not accept EU proposals while the idea is to create an option to extend the transition period but is not expected to be used. She expects the transition period to end at the end of 2020, but she does not see a gap between a transition period and a future trade deal. During a press conference later in the day she reiterated her commitment to resolve the Brexit issues as soon as possible. EU Council President Tusk also commented on the EU summit and noted they are in a much better mood than after Salzburg&rsquo;s summit and they are closer to final solutions and a deal; he also reported the EU stands ready to call another Brexit summit if enough progress is made. He highlighted that a Brexit transition period length was not discussed but vowed that the UK wants an extension of the transition period and the EU would consider this positively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>China is asking to set up a WTO expert panel against American metals duties whilst on the US side, White House Economic Advisor Kudlow made some afternoon comments about China not responding positively to any of the US requests in trade talks. Elsewhere, France is seeking a trade road-map with China by year-end, according to an official.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPLITICS: </strong>After US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced he will not be attending the Saudi investment conference, the NYT reported Saudi Arabia is considering blaming a top official close to Crown Prince MBS for Khashoggi&#39;s death whilst US House members urged US President Trump to impose sanctions on journalist Khashoggi case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Bullard (Non-Voter) said the central bank&#39;s monetary policy is &#39;about right&#39; now for the economy, adding that weak inflation factors mean the Fed does not need to raise rates further. He noted that he has been willing to go along with interest rate rises so far because the economy has surprised to the upside but he does not think the Fed should schedule more hikes. He added that the expected Fed funds rate of 3.4% in 2020 would be &quot;quite a way&quot; into restrictive territory. Fed&#39;s (Voter, Neutral) Quarles sees continued gradual rate hikes and believes the Fed can gradually raise rates without being restrictive. He is optimistic on the US outlook and expects a stable, gradual, predictable US rate hikes until data shows &quot;strong signal&quot; to adjust. He however struck a slightly more dovish tone by highlighting he anticipates a more gradual rate hike path than most of his colleagues, stating he suspects productivity could be rising and sees less reason to accelerate rate hikes. Finally, he forecasts longer-term US economic growth higher than median Fed projection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Rehn said he sees the first hike in Q4 of 2019 if the current economic outlook holds. ECB member in waiting Dolenc said ECB interest rates to remain low for a long time, likely through summer 2019, towing the official guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PHILLY FED:</strong> The index fell to 22.2 from 22.9 in October though posting a tad above the consensus at 20.0; orders fell slightly but shipments and employment rose. Analysts at Pantheon expected a bigger beat on the consensus noting that the reading &lsquo;leaves a clear gap between the Philly data and the national ISM manufacturing survey&rsquo; and arguing that is not clear why the numbers have been falling although this might just be noise. They believe a cyclical slowdown in growth is not yet underway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -1.42% at 2769, NDX -2.23% at 7116, DJI -1.26% at 25383. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -0.47%, Materials -1.12%, Industrials -1.78%, Cons Discretionary -2.10%, Cons Staples -0.20%, Healthcare -1.13%, Financials -1.51%, Tech -2.01%, Telecoms -1.84%, Utilities +0.10%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stock Specifics:</strong> Philip Morris (PM) and BB&amp;T Corp. (BBT) beat on both EPS and revenue estimates making them top movers today. Invesco (IVZ) made big gains after the announcement of its acquisition of Oppenheimer Funds, increasing its total AUM to over USD 1.2trln. Kinder Morgan (KMI) was another outperformer following it beating earnings estimates and announcing the potential sale of its Canada unit. Praxair (PX) also a top mover on the back of reported US merger approval with Linde AG (LIN GY). United Rentals (URI) took a nosedive today after disappointing the market with its forward guidance. Textron (TXT) moved lower following a miss on top and bottom line expectations. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) was a bottom mover after opening sales for its new Call of Duty game did not meet analysts&rsquo; expectations, spreading pessimism on the wider sector where Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) and were sold off. Sealed Air (SEE) also a loser on the day following the co. cutting its annual earnings forecasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 1.10 LOWER AT USD 68.65/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.76 LOWER AT USD 79.29/BBL.</strong> Oil prices were once again on the defensive on Thursday, tracking risk sentiment which was soft on Thursday. Some of the downside action could relate to traders becoming more confident about the availability of supplies towards the end of the year and into 2019, Reuters crude watcher John Kemp noted, arguing that Iran&#39;s exports have not declined as much as predicted a couple of months ago and it is now becoming apparent that they will not fall to zero. Some like Citi, for instance, are also making the case now that the US and OECD have been building ahead of winter supply disruptions. As to news flow, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said he will not be attending the Saudi investment conference following the disappearance of journalist Khashoggi, contributing to growing tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia which, given Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s role as a global oil producer, add to the narrative for oil upside.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 3 TICKS HIGHER AT 118-04+.</strong>Treasuries were higher and benefitted from safe-haven in-flows originating from a mix of market-negative catalysts including Italy&rsquo;s budget and Brexit talks. The yield curve saw some modest steepening in US trade though most of the buying actions was concentrated in the belly of the curve were yields were lower by c.2bps at settlement. 2s5s and 2s10s were narrower by c.2bps whilst 5s30s and 10s30s were wider y c,2bps. The US Treasury sold USD 5bln in 30yr TIPS tailing by 1.6bps. Demand was soft as indicated by bid-to-cover which stood at 2.32, below recent averages. The breakdown also showed the auction was weak overall as directs took the smallest in a year, directs took less than 1% whilst dealers were left with the largest share since February 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Greenback is grinding higher again after losing impetus gleaned from last night&rsquo;s FOMC minutes underpinning December tightening expectations and further tightening to or even above neutral levels. The resultant rebound in US Treasury yields is supportive, but the DXY remains unable to breach the next upside chart hurdle ahead of 96.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>The antipodean Dollars are just clinging to net gains vs their US counterpart, but with the Aud still capped around 0.7150 after a couple of laboured attempts to build on post-Aussie jobs data gains, while the Kiwi has encountered more resistance below 0.6600 and circa 1.0850 on the cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>Mixed fortunes for the renowned &lsquo;safe-haven&rsquo; currencies, as the Jpy stuck relatively close to 112.50 having recovered from overnight lows close to a key Fib, but the Franc succumbed to some pronounced selling pressure vs the Usd and Eur down to 0.9975 and through 1.1450 respectively before regaining composure. No obvious catalysts, but perhaps Italian in-flows and FTQ demand vs selling/hedging against official intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>Both pivotal around big figures vs the Buck, as the single currency straddled 1.1500 and Cable flitted either side of 1.3100. The Eur remained transfixed by EU budget concerns as Italy&rsquo;s 2018 deficit target was subject to more scrutiny amidst an official letter expressing serious concerns on Italy&rsquo;s plan, while Spain&rsquo;s fiscal plans also raised eyebrows in Brussels. Moreover, the technical backdrop for Eur/Usd is looking increasingly bearish as it appears on track to end Thursday&rsquo;s EU session under another major chart level (and 1.1500). Back to the Pound, a Brexit deal still appears remote with no sign of a compromise on the Irish border and customs, as the talk now turns to extending the transition in an effort to resolve the outstanding issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Another victim of overall Usd strength, but also as crude prices declined further, with the Loonie slipping below 1.3050 at one stage and hardly gleaning any traction from an upbeat Canadian ADP payrolls survey, which as usual is already outdated by official jobs data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>A rather volatile and somewhat divergent day for regional currencies, as most were overwhelmed by hawkish/bullish Fed minutes, higher US yields and a downturn in global equities, while the Yuan also had a higher Usd/Cny mid-point fixing to steer direction. However, the Turkish Lira maintained its recovery impetus on balance amidst positive rhetoric from the Finance Minister, follow-through from expectations that the US will relax some sanctions and maybe a degree of pre-CBRT positioning for a hawkish policy meeting. Usd/Cnh up around 6.9500, but Usd/Try down to 5.5195 at one stage.</p>\r\n",

Sealed Air (SEE) also a loser on the day following the co. cutting its annual earnings forecasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 1.10 LOWER AT USD 68.65/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.76 LOWER AT USD 79.29/BBL.</strong> Oil prices were once again on the defensive on Thursday, tracking risk sentiment which was soft on Thursday. Some of the downside action could relate to traders becoming more confident about the availability of supplies towards the end of the year and into 2019, Reuters crude watcher John Kemp noted, arguing that Iran&#39;s exports have not declined as much as predicted a couple of months ago and it is now becoming apparent that they will not fall to zero. Some like Citi, for instance, are also making the case now that the US and OECD have been building ahead of winter supply disruptions. As to news flow, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said he will not be attending the Saudi investment conference following the disappearance of journalist Khashoggi, contributing to growing tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia which, given Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s role as a global oil producer, add to the narrative for oil upside.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 3 TICKS HIGHER AT 118-04+.</strong>Treasuries were higher and benefitted from safe-haven in-flows originating from a mix of market-negative catalysts including Italy&rsquo;s budget and Brexit talks. The yield curve saw some modest steepening in US trade though most of the buying actions was concentrated in the belly of the curve were yields were lower by c.2bps at settlement. 2s5s and 2s10s were narrower by c.2bps whilst 5s30s and 10s30s were wider y c,2bps. The US Treasury sold USD 5bln in 30yr TIPS tailing by 1.6bps. Demand was soft as indicated by bid-to-cover which stood at 2.32, below recent averages. The breakdown also showed the auction was weak overall as directs took the smallest in a year, directs took less than 1% whilst dealers were left with the largest share since February 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Greenback is grinding higher again after losing impetus gleaned from last night&rsquo;s FOMC minutes underpinning December tightening expectations and further tightening to or even above neutral levels. The resultant rebound in US Treasury yields is supportive, but the DXY remains unable to breach the next upside chart hurdle ahead of 96.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>The antipodean Dollars are just clinging to net gains vs their US counterpart, but with the Aud still capped around 0.7150 after a couple of laboured attempts to build on post-Aussie jobs data gains, while the Kiwi has encountered more resistance below 0.6600 and circa 1.0850 on the cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>Mixed fortunes for the renowned &lsquo;safe-haven&rsquo; currencies, as the Jpy stuck relatively close to 112.50 having recovered from overnight lows close to a key Fib, but the Franc succumbed to some pronounced selling pressure vs the Usd and Eur down to 0.9975 and through 1.1450 respectively before regaining composure. No obvious catalysts, but perhaps Italian in-flows and FTQ demand vs selling/hedging against official intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>Both pivotal around big figures vs the Buck, as the single currency straddled 1.1500 and Cable flitted either side of 1.3100. The Eur remained transfixed by EU budget concerns as Italy&rsquo;s 2018 deficit target was subject to more scrutiny amidst an official letter expressing serious concerns on Italy&rsquo;s plan, while Spain&rsquo;s fiscal plans also raised eyebrows in Brussels. Moreover, the technical backdrop for Eur/Usd is looking increasingly bearish as it appears on track to end Thursday&rsquo;s EU session under another major chart level (and 1.1500). Back to the Pound, a Brexit deal still appears remote with no sign of a compromise on the Irish border and customs, as the talk now turns to extending the transition in an effort to resolve the outstanding issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Another victim of overall Usd strength, but also as crude prices declined further, with the Loonie slipping below 1.3050 at one stage and hardly gleaning any traction from an upbeat Canadian ADP payrolls survey, which as usual is already outdated by official jobs data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>A rather volatile and somewhat divergent day for regional currencies, as most were overwhelmed by hawkish/bullish Fed minutes, higher US yields and a downturn in global equities, while the Yuan also had a higher Usd/Cny mid-point fixing to steer direction. However, the Turkish Lira maintained its recovery impetus on balance amidst positive rhetoric from the Finance Minister, follow-through from expectations that the US will relax some sanctions and maybe a degree of pre-CBRT positioning for a hawkish policy meeting. Usd/Cnh up around 6.9500, but Usd/Try down to 5.5195 at one stage.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback is grinding higher again after losing impetus gleaned from last night&rsquo;s FOMC minutes underpinning December tightening expectations and further tightening to or even above neutral levels. The resultant rebound in US Treasury yields is supportive, but the DXY remains unable to breach the next upside chart hurdle ahead of 96.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The antipodean Dollars are just clinging to net gains vs their US counterpart, but with the Aud still capped around 0.7150 after a couple of laboured attempts to build on post-Aussie jobs data gains, while the Kiwi has encountered more resistance below 0.6600 and circa 1.0850 on the cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed fortunes for the renowned &lsquo;safe-haven&rsquo; currencies, as the Jpy stuck relatively close to 112.50 having recovered from overnight lows close to a key Fib, but the Franc succumbed to some pronounced selling pressure vs the Usd and Eur down to 0.9975 and through 1.1450 respectively before regaining composure. No obvious catalysts, but perhaps Italian in-flows and FTQ demand vs selling/hedging against official intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both pivotal around big figures vs the Buck, as the single currency straddled 1.1500 and Cable flitted either side of 1.3100. The Eur remained transfixed by EU budget concerns as Italy&rsquo;s 2018 deficit target was subject to more scrutiny amidst reports that an official letter will spell out the reservations, while Spain&rsquo;s fiscal plans also raised eyebrows in Brussels. Moreover, the technical backdrop for Eur/Usd is looking increasingly bearish as it appears on track to end Thursday&rsquo;s EU session under another major chart level (and 1.1500). Back to the Pound, a Brexit deal still appears remote with no sign of a compromise on the Irish border and customs, as the talk now turns to extending the transition in an effort to resolve the outstanding issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another victim of overall Usd strength, but also as crude prices declined further, with the Loonie slipping below 1.3050 at one stage and hardly gleaning any traction from an upbeat Canadian ADP payrolls survey, which as usual is already outdated by official jobs data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A rather volatile and somewhat divergent day for regional currencies, as most were overwhelmed by hawkish/bullish Fed minutes, higher US yields and a downturn in global equities, while the Yuan also had a higher Usd/Cny mid-point fixing to steer direction. However, the Turkish Lira maintained its recovery impetus on balance amidst positive rhetoric from the Finance Minister, follow-through from expectations that the US will relax some sanctions and maybe a degree of pre-CBRT positioning for a hawkish policy meeting. Usd/Cnh up around 6.9500, but Usd/Try down to 5.5195 at one stage.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (Unch) and Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) were subdued with Australia led lower for most the session by the energy sector after a slip in oil prices due to the larger than expected build in DoE crude inventories, while the Japanese benchmark was dampened by trade data in which exports missed estimates and contracted for the first time in almost 2 years. Shanghai Comp. (-2.0%) underperformed amid trade-related concerns as Trump plans to drop out of a 192-country treaty which provides Chinese firms discounted shipping rates for small packages bound for US, while losses in the Hang Seng (-0.2%) were cushioned as participants also took into account the prior day&rsquo;s stock advances on return from the holiday closure. Finally, 10yr JGBs were softer as prices failed to benefit from the risk-averse tone and despite the firmer demand seen at today&rsquo;s 20yr auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.9275 (Prev. 6.9103)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese Trade Balance (JPY)(Sep) 139.6B vs. Exp. -50.0B (Prev. -444.6B, Rev. -438.4B). (Newswires)<br />Japanese Exports (Sep) Y/Y -1.2% vs. Exp. 1.9% (Prev. 6.6%)<br />Japanese Imports (Sep) Y/Y 7.0% vs. Exp. 13.7% (Prev. 15.4%, Rev. 15.3%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bank of Korea kept 7-day repo rate unchanged at 1.5% as expected with the decision not unanimous as board members Lee Il-Houng and Koh Seung-Beom dissented. The BoK stated growth may hover below previous projections and investment will slow but added that exports will sustain growth momentum and that they are to watch foreign monetary policies as well as EM economies. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU leaders are prepared to meet again when chief negotiator Barnier reports that there has been decisive progress, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&#39;s spokeswoman said that alongside extending the transition period, they are considering other ideas, while a senior UK Government Official said the extension of Brexit&#39;s implementation phase is an option; key point is that we do not expect to use the extension. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary Raab said UK PM May has the support of her top team of ministers on her Brexit plan. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French Presidential Source said the extension to Brexit transition period is feasible, however it should be short.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury said no major trading partner met legislative standards for currency manipulation and estimated that PBoC currency intervention to be limited this year but added that a lack of China currency transparency is a concern. Furthermore, it kept the 6 countries in its watch list unchanged which were Japan, China, Germany, India, South Korea and Switzerland. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are mixed as the region failed to benefit from a slew of earnings. Spain&rsquo;s IBEX (-0.8%) underperforms with banks plumbing the depths as traders cite a ruling by Spain&#39;s supreme court as a potential catalyst, while Eurostoxx 50 (-0.7%) is pressured by heavyweights SAP (-2.3%) and Unilever (-1.3%) after Q3 numbers, and the Stoxx 600 (+0.2%) is kept afloat with post-earnings gainers dominating the top of the benchmark. In terms of sectors, healthcare names outperform on the back pharma-giants Novartis (+1.8%) and Roche (+1.7%) with the former raising FY guidance. Meanwhile, while the IT sector pulled back from the prior day&rsquo;s gains and currently underperforms. Elsewhere, on the back of earnings, Carrefour (+7.6%) leads the gains in the CAC, closely followed by Publicis (+6.4%) which in turn is lifting WPP (+2.5%) in sympathy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The Dollar gleaned additional momentum from latest Fed minutes that kept a December rate hike firmly on the agenda, as FOMC members noted some data pointing to stronger than anticipated growth and also maintained the view that policy could become restrictive. However, the index has failed to extend recovery gains beyond near term technical resistance around 95.790 and has drifted back towards 95.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - In contrast, the Aud has rebounded relatively impressively from near 0.7100 lows vs the Usd and just extended post-Aussie jobs data gains towards 0.7150 having lost traction in wake of the rather mixed report overnight (headline employment change missed, but full time offset a drop in temps and the unemployment rate fell, albeit due to lower participation).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi has largely tracked its antipodean counterpart, but lagging, as the cross climbs further from recent lows and back into a 1.0850-1.0900 range, and Nzd/Usd continues to hit offers ahead of 0.6600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF - Both around 0.2% firmer vs the Greenback and also clawing back losses, with the single currency reclaiming 1.1500+ status and Franc off 0.9950+ lows. However, Eur/Usd remains weak chart-wise after losing several key supports at 1.1546, 1.1258 and 1.1505, and fundamentally as Italy&rsquo;s budget remains a bone of EU contention, while option expiries at 1.1500 and 1.1550 (1.2 bn and 1.3 bn) may also factor into the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP/CAD - Al narrowly mixed vs the Usd, with the Jpy finding some support just ahead of a 112.75 Fib and grinding back to circa 112.50 and Cable largely shrugging off weak UK retail sales data to retest support around 1.3013 amidst more Brexit transition extension talk (PM May and others seemingly eyeing a period of months rather than 1 year that had been ventured). However, the Loonie has been less resistant to another marked retreat in oil prices and retreats further through 1.3000 lows within a 1.3020-55 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Try continues to outperform and after brief consolidation, the Lira has carved out fresh multi-month peaks vs the Usd near 5.5200. Conversely, the Yuan is back under pressure after a weaker PBoC fix on counter-cyclical factors, and perhaps with tacit permission from the US Treasury after China evaded being labelled as a currency manipulator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has stayed firm within a USD 5/oz range, tracking USD post-FOMC minutes reinforcing market expectations of slightly tighter US monetary policy. Copper is down nearly 1% amidst a stronger dollar and concerns from Chinese Premier Li that the US trade war is creating additional downward pressure on China&rsquo;s economy. Elsewhere, iron ore has reached a 7-month high due to Chinese inventories dropping to their lowest level since December 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the energy complex, WTI and Brent are in the red, down by over 0.5% following a larger than expected build in DoE crude inventories, trading below USD 70/bbl and USD 80/bbl. Although this drop may have been somewhat offset by continued tension arising from the missing Saudi Arabia journalist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flogged anew ahead of the UK data, Gilts and by association Bunds, have gleaned very little traction from a much bigger decline in retail sales, as the 10 year EU benchmarks remain circa &frac14; point below par and the latter not far from a fresh Eurex low of 158.82 (-34 ticks on the day and just below near term chart support that held during the opening and early downside price action). Of course, consumer spending figures always come with a fair degree of caution in terms of forecast accuracy, and this is highlighted by the almost inevitable if not customary back month revisions, which in this case were higher. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain soft and the curve steeper, albeit off overnight lows/wides ahead of weekly claims, Philly Fed and LEI.</p>\r\n",

Spain&rsquo;s IBEX (-0.8%) underperforms with banks plumbing the depths as traders cite a ruling by Spain&#39;s supreme court as a potential catalyst, while Eurostoxx 50 (-0.7%) is pressured by heavyweights SAP (-3.0%) and Unilever (-1.6%) after Q3 numbers, and the Stoxx 600 (+0.2%) is kept afloat with post-earnings gainers dominating the top of the benchmark. In terms of sectors, healthcare names outperform on the back pharma-giants Novartis (+1.6%) and Roche (+1.6%) with the former raising FY guidance. Meanwhile, while the IT sector pulled back from the prior day&rsquo;s gains and currently underperforms. Elsewhere, on the back of earnings, Carrefour (+7.6%) leads the gains in the CAC, closely followed by Publicis (+5.7%) which in turn is lifting WPP (+2.6%) in sympathy. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The Dollar gleaned additional momentum from latest Fed minutes that kept a December rate hike firmly on the agenda, as FOMC members noted some data pointing to stronger than anticipated growth and also maintained the view that policy could become restrictive. However, the index has failed to extend recovery gains beyond near term technical resistance around 95.790 and has drifted back towards 95.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - In contrast, the Aud has rebounded relatively impressively from near 0.7100 lows vs the Usd and just extended post-Aussie jobs data gains towards 0.7150 having lost traction in wake of the rather mixed report overnight (headline employment change missed, but full time offset a drop in temps and the unemployment rate fell, albeit due to lower participation).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi has largely tracked its antipodean counterpart, but lagging, as the cross climbs further from recent lows and back into a 1.0850-1.0900 range, and Nzd/Usd continues to hit offers ahead of 0.6600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF - Both around 0.2% firmer vs the Greenback and also clawing back losses, with the single currency reclaiming 1.1500+ status and Franc off 0.9950+ lows. However, Eur/Usd remains weak chart-wise after losing several key supports at 1.1546, 1.1258 and 1.1505, and fundamentally as Italy&rsquo;s budget remains a bone of EU contention, while option expiries at 1.1500 and 1.1550 (1.2 bn and 1.3 bn) may also factor into the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP/CAD - Al narrowly mixed vs the Usd, with the Jpy finding some support just ahead of a 112.75 Fib and grinding back to circa 112.50 and Cable largely shrugging off weak UK retail sales data to retest support around 1.3013 amidst more Brexit transition extension talk (PM May and others seemingly eyeing a period of months rather than 1 year that had been ventured). However, the Loonie has been less resistant to another marked retreat in oil prices and retreats further through 1.3000 lows within a 1.3020-55 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Try continues to outperform and after brief consolidation, the Lira has carved out fresh multi-month peaks vs the Usd near 5.5200. Conversely, the Yuan is back under pressure after a weaker PBoC fix on counter-cyclical factors, and perhaps with tacit permission from the US Treasury after China evaded being labelled as a currency manipulator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flogged anew ahead of the UK data, Gilts and by association Bunds, have gleaned very little traction from a much bigger decline in retail sales, as the 10 year EU benchmarks remain circa &frac14; point below par and the latter not far from a fresh Eurex low of 158.82 (-34 ticks on the day and just below near term chart support that held during the opening and early downside price action). Of course, consumer spending figures always come with a fair degree of caution in terms of forecast accuracy, and this is highlighted by the almost inevitable if not customary back month revisions, which in this case were higher. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain soft and the curve steeper, albeit off overnight lows/wides ahead of weekly claims, Philly Fed and LEI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has stayed firm within a USD 5/oz range, tracking USD post-FOMC minutes reinforcing market expectations of slightly tighter US monetary policy. Copper is down nearly 1% amidst a stronger dollar and concerns from Chinese Premier Li that the US trade war is creating additional downward pressure on China&rsquo;s economy. Elsewhere, iron ore has reached a 7-month high due to Chinese inventories dropping to their lowest level since December 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the energy complex, WTI and Brent are in the red, down by over 0.5% following a larger than expected build in DoE crude inventories, trading below USD 70/bbl and USD 80/bbl. Although this drop may have been somewhat offset by continued tension arising from the missing Saudi Arabia journalist.</p>\r\n",

Of course, consumer spending figures always come with a fair degree of caution in terms of forecast accuracy, and this is highlighted by the almost inevitable if not customary back month revisions, which in this case were higher. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain soft and the curve steeper, albeit off overnight lows/wides ahead of weekly claims, Philly Fed and LEI.</p>\r\n",

This kept the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts subdued with EUR/USD struggling to stay afloat of the 1.1500 handle and with GBP/USD below 1.3100 following yesterday&rsquo;s double whammy of softer than expected inflation and lack of Brexit progress. Elsewhere, AUD/USD saw cautious gains after mixed jobs data in which Employment Change missed estimates but the Unemployment Rate unexpectedly fell to 5.0% from 5.3% amid a reduction in the Participation Rate, while CNY softened to levels last seen in January 2017 following a weaker fix by the PBoC and after the US Treasury refrained from labelling China as a currency manipulator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat as prices fail to benefit from the risk-averse tone and with demand sapped ahead of a 20yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
