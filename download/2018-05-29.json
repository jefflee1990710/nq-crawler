In sector specifics, financials underperformed, underpinned by Morgan Stanley (MS) and JP Morgan (JPM); JPM forecast trading revenue to be flat at $4.9bln in Q2 compared to the previous year. Utilities outperformed the other sectors on Tuesday trade, but was hampered by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG) after The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reported the company&rsquo;s equipment was the reason behind the forest fires in October but closed relatively flat given the defensive nature of the sector. In stock specifics, Micron (MU) led the index following on gains from last week boosted by a positive mention at Baron&rsquo;s yesterday. On the flipside financial names led the declines in the SPX with MS, STT, MET, CFG, PFG all closed lower by more than 5%. SPX -1.16% at 2690, NDX -0.49% at 6927, DJI -1.58% at 24361.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields fell on political concerns in Italy/Spain, sending yields on 10-year Tsys back to 2.80%, and the long-end back beneath 3.00%. The 2s10s spread flattened to narrows last seen in 2007, while 2s5s fell 3bps; that said, there was some widening observed in 5s30s which, at settlement, was around 5bps wider. Given the political concerns in Europe, there was much focus on ECB rate pricing, and unsurprisingly, the buying of the curve pushed implied probabilities of rate hikes further out, with the first rate hike not fully priced until the latter part of next year. There was a similar reaction in Fed pricing, with the odds of a rate hike easing to around 75% (from around 97% at the beginning of May). US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 44 ticks higher at 121-07+.</p>\r\n",

ANSA reported Cottarelli is considering giving up the PM mandate, allowing for a possible election as soon as July 29th, but a source close to Mattarella said there was no mention of this, but said Cottarelli asked for more time to name a cabinet. Earlier in the session, reports said Italian Economist Guido Tabellini was close to be nominated as Finance Minister. In the past (2014) he shared the view that the solution to the Italian economy is to stimulate expansion by cutting taxes and through ECB&rsquo;s financing support, he also supported wages below the minimum level. Elsewhere, M5S leader Di Maio said the hypothesis of impeachment is no longer on the table and noted he never sought an exit from the Euro, and similarly, League leader Salvini clarified that his government plan did not include an immediate Euro exit. Over in Spain, Podemos will post a no confidence vote if the Socialists&#39; motion fails, it was reported. Spanish lawmakers will debate the motion on Thursday and Friday, with a vote expected on Friday. ECB policymakers have begun commenting on the developments: ECB&rsquo;s Lautenschlager said it is too soon to assess the developments, while ECB&rsquo;s Linde (Bank of Spain governor) said that the spike higher in Spanish bond yields did not reflect economic fundamentals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*US-SINO TRADE CONFLICT: </strong>The White House announced tech tariff and investment restrictions on China &ndash; where it plans to levy 25% tariffs on USD 50 billion worth of Chinese tech goods. China stated the US announcement is contrary to previous consensus, saying that it is capable of protecting its own interests no matter what the US does. The White House announced the final list of Chinese imports subject to 25% tariff will be announced on June 15th whilst investment restrictions and export controls are set for June 30th. Earlier, the US is said to be pushing China to end 2015 poultry ban at trade talks, whilst China is reported to be considering an increase in US coal imports to reduce the US trade deficit. EU trade commissioner said he expects the US to put a cap on EU exports, even if there are no tariffs imposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*NAFTA:</strong> Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland said NAFTA teams have been very engaged over the last week and to have had a very productive meeting with US Trade Representative Lighthizer. Later, Canadian PM Trudeau said once again that he would only sign a NAFTA deal if it was good for Canada, no NAFTA is better than a bad deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*NORTH KOREA: </strong>South Korea&rsquo;s Yonhap reported that North Korea vice chairman of the ruling Workers&rsquo; Party&rsquo;s Central Committee Kim Yong Chol was scheduled to fly to the US on Wednesday, a positive sign that the North Korea-US meeting scheduled for June 12th may go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*ECB SPEAK:</strong> Current Bank of Spain Governor and ECB&rsquo;s Linde (Dovish) said that despite the current uncertainty in markets, economic conditions remain positive. ECB&#39;s Mersch (Hawkish) stated the ECB needs to adjust its policy toolkit to ensure it can take on the role in supervising clearing houses. ECB&#39;s Lautenschlaeger (Hawk) says a first hike around the middle of 2019 is not entirely out of the ballpark, and thinks June may be the month to decide a &ldquo;gradual&rdquo; QE exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*DATA</strong>: US CaseShiller HPI ticked up by 0.5% in March, short of expectations, though managed to push the y/y estimate to 6.8% vs consensus 6.5%. Strong population and employment growth combined with the tight supply of new and existing homes continued to push house prices higher, with gains reported across 19 out of 20 cities across the region. The US Consumer Confidence was pretty much inline with expectations and came in at 128, the third highest estimate since November 2002 though saw a downward revision to April&rsquo;s data. The differential between jobs plentiful and jobs hard to get rose to a cyclical high, auguring well for Friday&rsquo;s Employment Situation Report. A robust labour market and growing incomes supports confidence that growth is picking up compared to the 2%-2.5% Q1 growth rate, analysts said. Uncertainty remains around trade policy and also attention falls on consumer discretionary as demand for cars, homes and other major appliances was softer in May, said Oxford Economics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*SNB:</strong> SNB&rsquo;s Chair Jordan said monetary policy of negative interest rates and FX intervention takes into account market fragility, and added developments in recent days show the situation of the currency market does remain fragile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*EQUITIES:</strong> SPX -1.16% at 2690, NDX -0.49% at 6927, DJI -1.58% at 24361.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -0.80%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.18%, Energy: -0.32%, Financials: -3.37%, Health Care: -1.06%, Industrials: -1.63%, Materials: -1.77%, Telecom: -0.57%, Tech: -0.66%, Utilities: +0.04%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures were hit in Tuesday trade following European political woes; the Emini S&amp;P 500 traded lower overnight, breaking through the 100dma at 2713 and approaching the 50dma around 2673, before bouncing at that level in late trade, but remaining deep in the red. In sector specifics, financials underperformed, underpinned by Morgan Stanley (MS) and JP Morgan (JPM); JPM forecast trading revenue to be flat at $4.9bln in Q2 compared to the previous year. Utilities outperformed the other sectors on Tuesday trade, but was hampered by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG) after The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reported the company&rsquo;s equipment was the reason behind the forest fires in October but closed relatively flat given the defensive nature of the sector. In stock specifics, Micron (MU) led the index following on gains from last week boosted by a positive mention at Baron&rsquo;s yesterday. On the flipside financial names led the declines in the SPX with MS, STT, MET, CFG, PFG all closed lower by more than 5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*CRUDE:</strong> WTI settles $1.15 lower at $66.73/bbl, Brent settles $0.09 higher at $75.39/bbl. A cocktail of risk-off allied with continuing commentary suggesting OPEC will relax supply curbs at its June meeting piled pressure on the crude complex. On Tuesday, Ecuador&rsquo;s oil minister expressed his preference for the cartel and its partners to maintain the existing supply deal. Those comments came on the heels of reports late last week/over the weekend that production could be upped to offset Venezuelan production woes and the potential hit to Iranian production brought on by US sanctions. In aggregate, reports over the last week have suggested that production could be raised by around 1mln BPD, which would bring combined compliance to 100% vs 152% reported in April; another option being considered is bringing a limited amount of supply back to the market, with a range of 300k BPD to 800k BPD being floated. The Russian energy minister reportedly suggested bringing production levels back to levels seen before the supply cut deal (the deal saw 1.8mln of production cuts). PVM have suggested two factors are potentially standing in the way: 1) oil prices are sold heading into the 22 June OPEC meeting in anticipation of supply relaxation, in which case the group may opt to maintain the status quo to prevent further downside; 2) the Aramco IPO is likely to take place next year sometime, which will benefit from higher oil prices, and additionally, so would the Saudi fiscal position to plug budget gaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FIXED INCOME:</strong> US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 44 ticks higher at 121-07+. Treasury yields fell on political concerns in Italy/Spain, sending yields on 10-year Tsys back to 2.80%, and the long-end back beneath 3.00%. The 2s10s spread flattened to narrows last seen in 2007, while 2s5s fell 3bps; that said, there was some widening observed in 5s30s which, at settlement, was around 5bps wider. Given the political concerns in Europe, there was much focus on ECB rate pricing, and unsurprisingly, the buying of the curve pushed implied probabilities of rate hikes further out, with the first rate hike not fully priced until the latter part of next year. There was a similar reaction in Fed pricing, with the odds of a rate hike easing to around 75% (from around 97% at the beginning of May).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FOREX:</strong> Broad risk aversion persists in the currency markets, and largely on the ongoing Italian political void as the situation in Italy is increasingly appearing as though fresh elections are imminent. The EUR and JPY, that had been flanking G10s as worst and best performers respectively have pared losses and gains on a mixture of profit-taking, chart retracement and pure re-positioning from extreme levels. EUR held in just above 1.15, while USDJPY breached 109.00. Yen action has kept a lid on DXY, which is still trying to negotiate the 95-handle after popping its head above that area in Tuesday trade to print a new ytd peak. The Greenback also remains firm vs all other major peers, albeit with the CHF also displaying a degree of safe-haven premium (USDCHF sub-0.9950 and EURCHF fell to 8-month lows under 1.1450. Indeed, USDCAD is still above 1.3000 ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s BOC (hawkish hold expected), and in GBP, the 1.32 level held, just, while EURGBP fell, consolidating around 0.87. Meanwhile, the AUD and NZD both languished in the low 0.7500 and 0.6900 area respectively. Conversely, the TRY extended its recovery vs the USD (back around 4.53-54 vs 4.9000+ record lows last Wednesday) on CBRT moves to make monetary policy more &ldquo;straightforward&rdquo; via the 1-week repo rate rather than a combination of money market instruments. MXN was down vs the USD on broad strength of the buckl Mexico&rsquo;s central bank governor said that the Peso price action was reflective of a stronger dollar, as well as uncertainties about the NAFTA negotiations and the up[coming Mexican presidential elections; Diaz called for policy prudence and suggested Banxico has the tools to deal with different election outcomes. BRL was a better performer in the EMFX space (though even it could not manage to cling on to gains) as traders cited bargain hunting in Brazilian equities, while the Brazilian government also asked a labour court to declare planned oil workers strikes as illegal, and the Brazilian president also downplayed the potential for a coup resulting from the truckers protest, adding that there is no chance of military intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*COMING-UP:</strong> BoC Interest Rate Decision: The BOC is seen holding rates at 1.25% on Wednesday for the third straight meeting, according to 26 of 29 surveyed by Reuters, with analysts seeing the next 25bps hike in Q3 and then another in Q4. Recent BOC commentary has suggested that the central bank sees more room for economic expansion in the short-term without stoking inflationary pressures, while the BOC is also monitoring continuing concerns regarding the levels of domestic debt and the housing market &ndash; specifically, how these will evolve in the face of higher rates; additionally uncertainty around NAFTA has been weighing on business investment. Money markets are pricing a 30% probability of a rate rise, with more hawkish analysts pointing to firming inflation as well as higher oil prices. Read full preview here.</p>\r\n",

On Tuesday, Ecuador&rsquo;s oil minister expressed his preference for the cartel and its partners to maintain the existing supply deal. Those comments came on the heels of reports late last week/over the weekend that production could be upped to offset Venezuelan production woes and the potential hit to Iranian production brought on by US sanctions. In aggregate, reports over the last week have suggested that production could be raised by around 1mln BPD, which would bring combined compliance to 100% vs 152% reported in April; another option being considered is bringing a limited amount of supply back to the market, with a range of 300k BPD to 800k BPD being floated. The Russian energy minister reportedly suggested bringing production levels back to levels seen before the supply cut deal (the deal saw 1.8mln of production cuts). PVM have suggested two factors are potentially standing in the way: 1) oil prices are sold heading into the 22 June OPEC meeting in anticipation of supply relaxation, in which case the group may opt to maintain the status quo to prevent further downside; 2) the Aramco IPO is likely to take place next year sometime, which will benefit from higher oil prices, and additionally, so would the Saudi fiscal position to plug budget gaps.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Eur/Usd held in just above 1.1500 and a daily cloud support, while Usd/Jpy is now back near 109.00 and beyond 108.80-90 option strikes in 1.2 bn from a low below 108.50 at one stage and the cross is midway between 125.05-127.25 trading parameters with decent buying noted on the way back up from fresh 2018 lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has nudged the DXY back under 95.000 and from a new ytd peak, but the Greenback remains firm vs all other major peers, albeit with the CHF also displaying a degree of safe-haven premium (Usd/Chf sub-0.9950 and Eur/Chf towards the middle of a 1.1550-1.1450 range). Indeed, Usd/CAD is still above 1.3000 and Cable is below 1.3300 having set a new base for the year around 1.3200 as the GBP suffered its own bout of political (and Brexit) jitters, while the AUD and NZD both languished in the low 0.7500 and 0.6900 area respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, the TRY posted extended recovery gains vs the Usd (back around 4.5400 vs 4.9000+ record lows last Wednesday) on CBRT moves to make monetary policy more straightforward via the 1-week repo rate rather than a combination of money market instruments.</p>\r\n",

However, whether or not the bounce proves to be more than &lsquo;dead cat&rsquo; still leaves Bunds less than 100 ticks ahead vs +222 at one stage. There is nothing to suggest any &lsquo;official&rsquo; buying of BTPs or other peripheral paper for that matter, but certainly the frantic pace of selling has abated and prompted short covering awaiting more developments in Rome and a meeting between the President and interim PM, just ahead of end of month supply on Wednesday.

In the wake of this news President Mattarella summoned former-IMF senior director Cottarelli to meet in a move viewed by some as laying the groundwork for a technocratic government. Forza Italia said they would not support this government, and 5SM and League set their sights on the now highly likely new elections (touted from September 9th). Both 5SM and League saying they will evaluate their coalition in these new elections. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian President Mattarella gave mandate to form a government to ex-IMF official Cottarelli, while PM-designate Cottarelli accepted the mandate to form a government as expected and sees elections at the start of next year. In related news, League leader Salvini said he hopes there will be a government in October for the approval of the budget law and to avoid a VAT increase and M5S leader Di Maio wants elections as soon as possible, while Forza Italia&rsquo;s Berlusconi said his party will reject the Cottarelli government.

(Newswires) On Saturday, Barnier warned the UK to stop playing &lsquo;hide and seek&rsquo; and come to a realistic solution for their exit from the EU. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK is reported to be lacking a plan in the event of a &#39;no-deal&#39; Brexit, thus making it virtually impossible for May to walk out of negotiations with the EU, according to sources.

(WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asia traded mostly subdued as region lacked impetus following the market closures in US and UK, while recent weakness in oil prices and political uncertainty surrounding Italy and Spain have added to the cautious tone. As such, Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) was the worst performer as Japanese exporters suffered from flows into the JPY, while Japan Display shares led the declines in Tokyo with losses of over 20% seen in early trade after reports that Apple is to switch to OLED screens on all iPhone models from next year, which in turn underpinned South Korea&rsquo;s LG Display. ASX 200 (+0.2%) was lifted by strength in its largest weighted financials sector and as energy names shrugged off the recent aggressive pull-back in crude prices. Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) failed to maintain the early support from a firm PBoC liquidity operation and eventually slipped amid the broad risk-averse tone, while Hang Seng (-1.0%) was weighed by losses in blue-chip property and energy names. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid recent upside in T-notes and declines in US yields, although the gains for Japanese bonds were only modest amid a mixed 40yr auction which printed a higher b/c but lower prices from previous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 100bln via 7-day and CNY 80bln via 28-day reverse repos, for a net daily injection of CNY 50bln.

(WSJ/Newswires/Chosun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities continue to extend losses (Eurostoxx 50 -1.3%) as financials lead the sell off with the sector down almost 3%. Italian banks continue to bleed with trading halts in Monte Paschi (-4.5%), Bper (-6.3%) and Banca Generali (-4.5%); all limit down. The downfall in Italian banks has spread across the continent with major losses for the likes of Commerzbank (-3.4%), BNP (-3.6%), RBS (-3.3%), Credit Suisse (-2.8%) all resting at the foot of their respective indices. Italy&rsquo;s domestic politics remains in scope following Italian President Mattarella giving mandate to ex-IMF official Cottarelli to form a technocratic government. Cottarelli&rsquo;s list of Ministers is expected to be unveiled today, moving the process to a vote in the Italian parliament (League, 5 Star and Forza Italia have majority) where a snap election appears inevitable. Italy will very much remain the focus as markets price in the uncertainty arising from a snap election. Elsewhere, Dixons Carphone (-19.6%) trades at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following a profit warning for 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The JPY benefitted most among G10/major currencies from the latest political turmoil in Italy, and to a lesser extent Spain, that has sparked broader risk-aversion and fresh EUR losses to ytd lows, around 125.05 for the cross and circa 1.1510 vs the USD, with very big barriers at 1.1550 breached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the DXY, the aforementioned Eur slide pushed the index to a new 2018 peak around 95.030, even though Usd/Jpy has retreated further below 109.00 and through a 108.79 Fib to test bids/support around 108.50, but with decent option expiry interest sitting between 108.80-90 (1.2 bn) perhaps limiting downside price action approaching the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP also a fall guy, partly in sympathy with the single currency, but also amidst yet more uncertainty over Brexit and of course UK political unrest, with Cable down through 1.3250 and almost hitting 1.3200 after taking out channel support at 1.3221, albeit briefly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF consolidating gains vs the Usd in the low 0.9900 area, but extending advances vs the Eur through 1.1500 and within striking distance of the 1.1447 ytd base, as a prominent US bank goes short for 1.1200 and places a stop at 1.1700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less pronounced moves, but all weaker for choice of risk-off positioning with the Kiwi around 0.6925, Aud/Usd near 0.7530 and Loonie circa 1.3000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bucking the overall trend and clawing back more losses as the Lira derives comfort from moves by the CBRT to simplify its monetary policy operations via officially targeting the 1 week repo rate. Usd/Try currently around 4.6000 vs 4.9000+ less than a week ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bouts of calm and consolidation become increasingly infrequent as the rout in Italian BTPs intensified and reached real safety flight bordering on systemic proportions as the 10 year future racked up losses of 900 ticks and Bunds rallied above 164.00 to 164.15 vs Monday&rsquo;s 161.93 close. Gilts jumped above 125.50 to 125.64 and US Treasuries a full point to 121-00 in fast markets, before some profit taking and short covering set in. Nothing so far to suggest anything but corrections within overall ranges as Italian bonds and assets in general remain under heavy pressure, while short-term funding costs via the latest 6 month BOT auction jumped to 1.213% from -0.421%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI is continuing the declines seen on Monday trade (-1.4%) as traders continue to digest a possible OPEC+ production increase next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold is currently trading upwards and has broken the USD 1,300/oz level as safe-haven demand is proving some support for the yellow metal. Copper prices are seeing strength after the closure of an Indian copper smelter is cutting supply to the market. Steel rebar is higher as Chinese seasonal demand has grown.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities continue to extend losses (Eurostoxx 50 -1.6%) as financials lead the sell off with the sector down almost 3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian banks continue to bleed with trading halts in Monte Paschi (-4.5%), Bper (-5.4%) and Banca Generali (-3.0%); all limit down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The downfall in Italian banks has spread across the continent with major losses for the likes of Commerzbank (-5.0%), BNP (-4.6%), RBS (-3.8%), Credit Suisse (-3.8%) all resting at the foot of their respective indices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&rsquo;s domestic politics remains in scope following Italian President Mattarella giving mandate to ex-IMF official Cottarelli to form a technocratic government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cottarelli&rsquo;s list of Ministers is expected to be unveiled today, moving the process to a vote in the Italian parliament (League, 5 Star and Forza Italia have majority) where a snap election appears inevitable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy will very much remain the focus as markets price in the uncertainty arising from a snap election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Dixons Carphone (-21.3%) trades at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following a profit warning for 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The JPY &nbsp;benefitted most among G10/major currencies from the latest political turmoil in Italy, and to a lesser extent Spain, that has sparked broader risk-aversion and fresh EUR losses to ytd lows, around 125.05 for the cross and circa 1.1510 vs the USD, with very big barriers at 1.1550 breached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the DXY, the aforementioned Eur slide pushed the index to a new 2018 peak around 95.030, even though Usd/Jpy has retreated further below 109.00 and through a 108.79 Fib to test bids/support around 108.50, but with decent option expiry interest sitting between 108.80-90 (1.2 bn) perhaps limiting downside price action approaching the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP also a fall guy, partly in sympathy with the single currency, but also amidst yet more uncertainty over Brexit and of course UK political unrest, with Cable down through 1.3250 and almost hitting 1.3200 after taking out channel support at 1.3221, albeit briefly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF consolidating gains vs the Usd in the low 0.9900 area, but extending advances vs the Eur through 1.1500 and within striking distance of the 1.1447 ytd base, as a prominent US bank goes short for 1.1200 and places a stop at 1.1700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less pronounced moves, but all weaker for choice of risk-off positioning with the Kiwi around 0.6925, Aud/Usd near 0.7530 and Loonie circa 1.3000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bucking the overall trend and clawing back more losses as the Lira derives comfort from moves by the CBRT to simplify its monetary policy operations via officially targeting the 1 week repo rate. Usd/Try currently around 4.6000 vs 4.9000+ less than a week ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bouts of calm and consolidation become increasingly infrequent as the rout in Italian BTPs intensified and reached real safety flight bordering on systemic proportions as the 10 year future racked up losses of 900 ticks and Bunds rallied above 164.00 to 164.15 vs Monday&rsquo;s 161.93 close. Gilts jumped above 125.50 to 125.64 and US Treasuries a full point to 121-00 in fast markets, before some profit taking and short covering set in. Nothing so far to suggest anything but corrections within overall ranges as Italian bonds and assets in general remain under heavy pressure, while short-term funding costs via the latest 6 month BOT auction jumped to 1.213% from -0.421%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI is continuing the declines seen on Monday trade (-2.0%) as traders continue to digest a possible OPEC+ production increase next month. Spreads are widening between WTI and Brent futures, with Brent currently up slightly on the day (+0.2%), as a result of a different settlement date for Brent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold is currently trading upwards and has broken the USD 1,300/oz level as safe-haven demand is proving some support for the yellow metal. Copper prices are seeing strength after the closure of an Indian copper smelter is cutting supply to the market. Steel rebar is higher as Chinese seasonal demand has grown.</p>\r\n",

(FT)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK is reported to be lacking a plan in the event of a &#39;no-deal&#39; Brexit, thus making it virtually impossible for May to walk out of negotiations with the EU, according to sources. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that a US team arrived in North Korea to make arrangement for summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korea President Moon met with North Korea leader Kim in an unannounced meeting over the weekend in which the latter affirmed commitment for denuclearisation. (WSJ)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asia traded mostly subdued as region lacked impetus following the market closures in US and UK, while recent weakness in oil prices and political uncertainty surrounding Italy and Spain have added to the cautious tone. As such, Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) was the worst performer as Japanese exporters suffered from flows into the JPY, while Japan Display shares led the declines in Tokyo with losses of over 20% seen in early trade after reports that Apple is to switch to OLED screens on all iPhone models from next year, which in turn underpinned South Korea&rsquo;s LG Display. ASX 200 (+0.2%) was lifted by strength in its largest weighted financials sector and as energy names shrugged off the recent aggressive pull-back in crude prices. Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) failed to maintain the early support from a firm PBoC liquidity operation and eventually slipped amid the broad risk-averse tone, while Hang Seng (-0.7%) was weighed by losses in blue-chip property and energy names. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher amid recent upside in T-notes and declines in US yields, although the gains for Japanese bonds were only modest amid a mixed 40yr auction which printed a higher b/c but lower prices from previous.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 100bln via 7-day and CNY 80bln via 28-day reverse repos, for a net daily injection of CNY 50bln.

(FT/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain will help to set the EU&rsquo;s GBP 1trl budget up to 2027 after European countries defied Brussels and invited UK officials to take part in negotiations. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Manufacturing firms are said to plan calling for the government to drop its &quot;max-fac&quot; proposal advocated by Brexiteers for the customs union, as the companies view it as unrealistic and costly.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the risk averse tone spurred flows into the safe-havens with JPY the main beneficiary which pushed USD/JPY briefly below the 109.00 handle, while JPY crosses were equally pressured with EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY at 11-month and 8-month lows respectively. This in turn dampened their relevant major pairs with EUR/USD also languishing from the political turmoil in the bloc with Italy on course for fresh elections and mired by impeachment calls against its President, while Spanish PM Rajoy is to also face a no-confidence vote later this week. Elsewhere, AUD/USD was pressured and underperformed its commodity-linked peers amid oil declines and on cross-related flows in which AUD/JPY tested 82.00 to the downside and with EUR/AUD supported at 1.5400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI crude futures languished and failed to maintain a footing above the USD 67.00bbl level following the recent aggressive pull-back on prospects of an OPEC+ production increase next month, although prices have nursed some of the recent heavy losses and are about a buck off Monday&rsquo;s lows. Elsewhere, gold is range-bound as support for the safe-haven from the broad risk averse tone is counterbalanced by a firmer greenback, while copper was marginally higher in a continuation of the short-covering as it maintains within its current price channel.

        "content": "<p>Asia trades mostly subdued as region lacks impetus following the market closures in US and UK, while recent weakness in oil prices and political uncertainty surrounding Italy and Spain have added to the cautious tone. As such, Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) is the worst performer as Japanese exporters suffer from flows into the JPY, while Japan Display shares lead the declines in Tokyo with losses of over 20% seen in early trade after reports that Apple is to switch to OLED screens on all iPhone models from next year, which in turn underpinned South Korea&rsquo;s LG Display. ASX 200 (+0.3%) is lifted by strength in its largest weighted financials sector and as energy names shrug off the recent aggressive pull-back in crude prices. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) is indecisive as a firm PBoC liquidity operation momentarily supports, while Hang Seng (-0.6%) is weighed by losses in the blue-chip property and energy names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the risk averse tone has spurred flows into the safe-havens with JPY the main beneficiary to push USD/JPY briefly below the 109.00 handle, while JPY crosses were equally pressured with EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY at 11-month and 8-month lows respectively. This in turn dampened their relevant major pairs with EUR/USD also languishing from the political turmoil in the bloc with Italy on course for fresh elections and mired by impeachment calls against its President, while Spanish PM Rajoy is to also face a no-confidence vote later this week. Elsewhere, AUD/USD is pressured and underperforms its commodity-linked peers amid oil declines and on cross-related flows in which AUD/JPY tested 82.00 to the downside and with EUR/AUD supported at 1.5400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid recent upside in T-notes and declines in US yields, although the gains for Japanese bonds are only marginal ahead of a 40yr auction later. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
