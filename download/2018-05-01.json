Some big barriers were also hurdled as the index cleared the 200 DMA just before 92.000, the big figure itself and then the next upside chart objective ahead of 92.515 (Fib) guarding early January ytd highs (92.640).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP suffered more heavy losses in wake of another raft of UK survey and data misses (including headline manufacturing PMI ahead of construction and services tomorrow and Thursday respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR and JPY were also the victims of extended Greenback strength, as both headline pairs saw breaches of 200 DMAs, Fibs and psychological levels, with 1.2000 relinquished in EURUSD and USDJPY wedging closer to 110.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD was among the G10 outliers as firmer than forecast Canadian GDP, ongoing positive NAFTA impulses and relatively strong crude prices continue to underpin the Loonie, which also benefitted by comments from BOC governor Poloz, who tilted on the hawkish side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD and NZD: The well flagged 0.7500 and 0.7000 levels finally yielded with fresh lows posted at circa 0.7480 and 0.6995 respectively, with the AUD getting few favours from the RBA overnight or subsequent comments from Governor Low who merely repeated wait-and-see policy guidance, while the Kiwi will be hoping for some solace from upcoming NZ jobs data after weaker than anticipated GDT auction prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoC&rsquo;s Poloz reiterated higher rates are warranted over time but some accommodation will still be required, while he also repeated the BoC will proceed cautiously and be guided by incoming data.

Qorvo (QRVO) and AbbVie (ABBV) led the SPX on Tuesday trade, following an upgrade at Barclays for QRVO and ABBV commenced its self-tender offer for up to $7.5bln of common stock at no less than $99/shr. On the flip side, Tapestry (TPR) pressured the index as its Kate Spade same store sales were down by 9%, overpowering the inline EPS &amp; revenues. Seagate (STX) also reported earnings which beat on both top and bottom line but during the earnings call concerns about trade wars were noted by the CFO which sent shares lower. Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) reported earnings before market today, Merck were lower over concerns of increased reliance on its Keytruda drug, as sales were up over 150% y/y. Pfizer (PFE) sent lower as revenues missed estimates, also during the conference call it was noted they may keep its consumer health business as it has not yet received an acceptable offer. In other news Facebook (FB) announced it is to make an entry into the dating industry, which sent Match (MTCH) shares lower by ~20%. SPX +0.3% at 2655, NDX +1.2% at 6681, DJI -0.3% at 24095.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As US traders returned to their desk following a relatively rangebound overnight session, Treasuries sold-off just before the cash-equity open, as the Greenback strengthened. The yield curve bear-steepened on Tuesday with the 30yr yields higher by c.4bps whilst the 2yr higher by c.2.5bps at settlement. Most of the action was seen in the long-end of the curve, however, despite the bear-steepening, 2s30s and 5s30s modestly narrowed by around 1bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 8 ticks lower at 119-12.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: </strong>Equities higher, Treasuries lower, DXY higher, Crude down.<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW: </strong>Europe closed for Labour Day;<strong> </strong>Manufacturing<strong> </strong>ISM miss; Com Sec Ross says NAFTA deal could come in the next few weeks; GDT index lower, WMP lower.<br /><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>FOMC (Weds); AAPL earnings (Tues AMC); API inventories (Tues AMC), DOE inventories (Weds), Treasury Quarterly Refunding (Weds).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS:</strong> A slight shift in rhetoric regarding the potential announcement of a NAFTA deal, after US Commerce Secretary Ross said a deal could come in the next few weeks (note, earlier guidance suggested a deal could be announced in early May) &ndash; though Trade Rep Lighthizer said he had &lsquo;no idea&rsquo; when the deal would come &ndash; Ross reiterated once again that if no deal soon, NAFTA talks could extend in later 2018 (earlier guidance implied after both the US mid-terms and Mexican elections). The gulf between US and Mexico/Canada was again highlighted after the Canadian foreign minister once again tried to push the line that NAFTA and metals duties were two separate issues, an area US Trade Representative Lighthizer disagreed with, and suggested both were linked. On a more positive note, Freeland once again talked-up the progress made on auto content rules. Elsewhere, Trump trade advisor Navarro said that the US would not extend tariff relief for Mexico and Canada again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Continued signs of tensions easing on the Korean Peninsula, after NK Leader Kim Jon-Un was reported to have agreed to a historic summit with US President Trump in the so-called demilitarised zone. However, in the Middle East, tensions are clearly ratcheting-up and we saw another round of bellicose headlines out of the region, with Israel saying to be seeking US support for military action against Iran (NBC reported), though Israel&rsquo;s PM did state that &lsquo;no one is seeking war with Iran&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>DATA:</strong> The <strong>ISM Manufacturing</strong> survey for April declined by more than expected to 57.3 from 59.3, though still remains at close to a 14-year high, and at levels which analysts say is consistent with GDP growth above 3% (Note: ISM has been rising for the 5<sup>th</sup> consecutive month). The production, employment and new orders sub-indices all moderated in April, but they continue to indicate strong momentum, Oxford Economics says. With the backlog of orders at their highest since 2004, Oxford Economics continues to expect upbeat manufacturing activity ahead, though does warn that continued uncertainty caused by trade policies poses risks, and consistent with other recent regional surveys, businesses continue to highlight concerns about increased protectionism. US <strong>construction spending</strong> for March was grim, missing expectations (-1.7% vs expected +0.5%). However, Pantheon Macroeconomics said that we shouldn&rsquo;t read too much into the data given that the first and often the second estimates tend to be heavily revised; January and February data was revised up by a large 2.6%, it notes, and therefore on net, the data is a bit stronger than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>BoC governor Poloz reiterated higher rates would be warranted over time, but some accommodation will still be required; also reiterated BOC will proceed cautiously, and be guided by incoming data. Poloz was also confident that risks &ndash; such as NAFTA &ndash; will not last forever, and was also upbeat about the prospects of household debt, warning that slower rate hikes might exacerbate the debt situation. On wages, he said that progress over the last 6-8 months has been positive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX +26% at 2655, NDX +1.19% at 6681, DJI -0.28% at 24095 SECTORS:</strong> Cons Cyclicals: -0.95%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.11%, Energy: -0.85%, Financials: -0.08%, Health Care: -0.21%, Industrials: -0.63%, Materials: -0.22%, Technology: +1.22%, Telecoms: -1.10%, Utilities: -0.48%. Volume was thinner with European traders away for Labour Day, but even so, there was a familiar, horizontal pattern for equities, with the SPX continuing to dance between its 50 dma and 200 dma, however in late afternoon trade we did see a turnaround.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Qorvo (QRVO) and AbbVie (ABBV) led the <strong>SPX </strong>on Tuesday trade, following an upgrade at Barclays for QRVO and ABBV commenced its self-tender offer for up to $7.5bln of common stock at no less than $99/shr. On the flip side, Tapestry (TPR) pressured the index as its Kate Spade same store sales were down by 9%, overpowering the inline EPS &amp; revenues. Seagate (STX) also reported earnings which beat on both top and bottom line but during the earnings call concerns about trade wars were noted by the CFO which sent shares lower. <strong>Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK)</strong> reported earnings before market today, Merck were lower over concerns of increased reliance on its Keytruda drug, as sales were up over 150% y/y. Pfizer (PFE) sent lower as revenues missed estimates, also during the conference call it was noted they may keep its consumer health business as it has not yet received an acceptable offer. In other news Facebook (FB) announced it is to make an entry into the dating industry, which sent Match (MTCH) shares lower by ~20%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* </strong>STEEL NAMES:<strong> </strong>were hit on Tuesday as president Trump said he is adding an extra month to tariff exemptions from the EU, Mexico and Canada. US Steel (X) went as low as<strong> </strong>7% and AK Steel (AKS) saw lows greater than 9% and CENX hitting the bottom at ~6.5%, but all these losses saw some retraction as the session progressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* AAPL EARNINGS: Apple (AAPL) was among the DJI leaders ahead of their earnings report tonight, expectations are for: EPS 2.69, Revenues 61.2bln, iPhone units 53mln, iPads 9mln and Macs at 4mln, according to The Street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI settles $1.32 lower at $67.25/bbl; Brent settles $1.56 lower at $73.13/bbl. </strong>Oil prices slipped and term-structures flattened out, though is consolidating just beneath YTD highs, with traders attributing the USD strength as the factor driving prices lower; volume, however, is thinner than recent sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* After the bell, the API will report weekly inventories, and the Street looks for a headline crude build of 1.3mln bbls, Cushing stocks are forecast to build by 1mln bbl, gasoline to draw by 0.4mln, and distillates are seen drawing 1.3mln. API energy report, analysts forecast crude stocks will build by 1.3mln, Cushing (via Genscape) is forecast to build by 1mln, distillates are seen drawing 1.3mln, and gasoline is seen drawing by 0.4mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* According to a Bloomberg survey, OPEC oil output will decline by 40k bpd in April MM, and production will drop to 31.93mln bpd led by Iran (recall that on Monday, Reuters OPEC survey saw April oil output seen declining by 70k BPD to 32.12mln BPD). Reports suggested that Iraq average oil exports from the Southern ports would be around 3.34mln BPD in April; in March, Platts reported that Iraqi exports from were 3.353mln BPD. Meanwhile, Iranian crude exports hit 2.61mln BPD in April, a record figure (rising from March&rsquo;s two-year low of 1.94mln BPD).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* In analyst commentary, Goldman Sachs said that there is significant upside to its 2019 crude price forecasts (currently, it sees WTI at $70/bbl by the end of 2019). BP CFO, however, suggested that crude prices could ease in the second half of 2018 as the growth in crude production accelerates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong><strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 8 ticks lower at 119-12. </strong>As US traders returned to their desk following a relatively rangebound overnight session, Treasuries sold-off just before the cash-equity open, as the Greenback strengthened. The yield curve bear-steepened on Tuesday with the 30yr yields higher by c.4bps whilst the 2yr higher by c.2.5bps at settlement. Most of the action was seen in the long-end of the curve, however, despite the bear-steepening, 2s30s and 5s30s modestly narrowed by around 1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>TREASURY QUARTERLY REFUNDING: </strong>The<strong> </strong>key question ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s refunding announcement is to what extent policymakers will act pre-emptively to meet the rising financing need of the next couple years, Wells Fargo says. Wells estimates that the Treasury&rsquo;s financing need for the April-December period will be approximately $720bln, though its base case into next week&rsquo;s refunding remains for $630bln to be announced in net coupon issuance, and $554 billion in net T-bill issuance (in calendar year 2018). &ldquo;To meet this need, the Treasury could increase auctions at its next couple of refunding meetings, or it could pause at this meeting to evaluate different funding options and provide guidance to markets in a lead up to more aggressive changes at the August refunding.&rdquo; Attention will be on any hints that Treasury will meet some of this financing need with new securities, which would alleviate some of the pressure to ramp up bill supply and/or coupon auctions, Wells says; &ldquo;Potential options include another 5-year TIPS maturity or introducing new 2-month, or 20-year Treasury securities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> USD: The Dollar picked up where it left off on the final day of last month, with early resistance around key DXY levels and major techs in individual basket pairings overcome amidst holiday-thinned volumes due to May/Labour Day across many Far East centres and the bulk of Europe. Some big barriers were also hurdled as the index cleared the 200 DMA just before 92.000, the big figure itself and then the next upside chart objective ahead of 92.515 (Fib) guarding early January ytd highs (92.640).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*CAD: Among the G10 outliers as firmer than forecast Canadian GDP, ongoing positive NAFTA impulses and relatively strong crude prices continue to underpin the Loonie, which also benefitted by comments from BOC governor Poloz, who tilted on the hawkish side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* GBP: Meanwhile, Sterling suffered more heavy losses in wake of another raft of UK survey and data misses (including headline manufacturing PMI ahead of construction and services tomorrow and Thursday respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*USD, CAD tested bids around the top layered buying interest from 1.2820-00, but rebounded above the 1.2850 pivot again to revisit recent peaks around 1.2900 after a dip in Canada&rsquo;s manufacturing and as the broad Dollar regained momentum after a minor manufacturing ISM set-back. Meanwhile, Cable losses accelerated alongside dwindling BoE tightening expectations (now sub-17% vs 90%+ only a few weeks ago) through 1.3700 and not far from 1.3600, while EURGBP rebounded above 0.8800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*AUD, NZD: The well flagged 0.7500 and 0.7000 levels finally yielded with fresh lows posted at circa 0.7480 and 0.6995 respectively, with the AUD getting few favours from the RBA overnight or subsequent comments from Governor Low who merely repeated wait-and-see policy guidance, while the Kiwi will be hoping for some solace from upcoming NZ jobs data after weaker than anticipated GDT auction prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EUR, JPY: Also the victims of extended Greenback strength, as both headline pairs saw breaches of 200 DMAs, Fibs and psychological levels, with 1.2000 relinquished in EURUSD and USDJPY wedging closer to 110.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>FOMC will publish its rate decision and statement at 1900 BST/1400 EDT on May 2, 2018; Fed expected to stand pat on policy; no updated economic projections are due, and there is no post-meeting press conference with Chair Powell. Fed speakers have not signaled a May hike is on the cards, and as such, attention is already on the June meeting, where the Fed is expected to lift rates and potentially adjust its rate hike trajectory.

Some big barriers were also hurdled as the index cleared the 200 DMA just before 92.000, the big figure itself and then the next upside chart objective ahead of 92.515 (Fib) guarding early January ytd highs (92.640).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD/GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the G10 outliers as firmer than forecast Canadian GDP, ongoing positive NAFTA impulses and relatively strong crude prices continue to underpin the Loonie, while Sterling suffered more heavy losses in wake of another raft of UK survey and data misses (including headline manufacturing PMI ahead of construction and services tomorrow and Thursday respectively). Usd/Cad tested bids around the top layered buying interest from 1.2820-00, but rebounded above the 1.2850 pivot again to revisit recent peaks around 1.2900 after a dip in Canada&rsquo;s manufacturing and as the broad Dollar regained momentum after a minor manufacturing ISM set-back. Meanwhile, Cable losses accelerated alongside dwindling BoE tightening expectations (now sub-17% vs 90%+ only a few weeks ago) through 1.3700 and not far from 1.3600, while Eur/Gbp rebounded above 0.8800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The well flagged 0.7500 and 0.7000 levels finally yielded with fresh lows posted at circa 0.7480 and 0.6995 respectively, with the Aud getting few favours from the RBA overnight or subsequent comments from Governor Low who merely repeated wait-and-see policy guidance, while the Kiwi will be hoping for some solace from upcoming NZ jobs data after weaker than anticipated GDT auction prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also the victims of extended Greenback strength, as both headline pairs saw breaches of 200 DMAs, Fibs and psychological levels, with 1.2000 reliquished in Eur/Usd and Usd/Jpy wedging closer to 110.00.</p>\r\n",

This was due to Israel&rsquo;s stern rhetoric on Iran which it alleged had lied on its nuclear program, while the telecoms sector led the declines amid doubts the T-Mobile-Sprint merger would get regulatory approval. ASX 200 (+0.6%) saw energy names underpinned on higher oil prices following Israel&rsquo;s exposure of Iran and the possible implications it could have on the nuclear agreement, while financials also gained after big 4 bank ANZ reported over 4% profit growth. Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) was in the green but with price action indecisive as it began a 2-day trading week and pondered over the recent JPY strength. There wasn&rsquo;t much price action elsewhere with mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan among the markets shut for public holiday, while US equity futures were off prior lows amid mild short covering and after reports the US extended tariff relief for its allies by delaying its decision another month to June 1st. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher to track the prior day&rsquo;s upside in T-notes and with the BoJ present in the market under its bond buying programme, while yields were lower across the curve with outperformance seen in super-long-end bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian RBA Cash Rate (May) 1.50% vs. Exp. 1.50% (Prev. 1.50%). (Newswires) RBA reiterates that steady policy is consistent with growth and inflation targets, while it also repeated that low rates supports the domestic economy and that a stronger AUD would slow economic pick-up. Furthermore, RBA stated that Inflation and wage growth likely to stay low for a while but added that it expects stronger exports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is reported to be mulling a deal with Brussels that Brexiteers fear could result to &#39;EU Mark II&#39; and make the UK take rules from EU. May has informed ministers that the UK could &ldquo;potentially&rdquo; accept an association agreement with the EU, which critics say would make Britain a &ldquo;rule taker&rdquo; from Europe (Telegraph) Similar reports suggest that the UK are set to unveil a new proposals to the EU and attempt to overcome the Irish border issue as negotiations resume once again this week. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Markit/CIPS Manufacturing PMI (Apr) 53.9 vs. Exp. 54.8 (Prev. 55.1, Rev. 54.9). Markit added that while adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April&rsquo;s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As European markets are closed for labour day, focus is on UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 (+0.3%), currently trading somewhat lacklustre albeit in thin trade. The index has however received a boost from the weakening sterling following softer UK Manufacturing PMIs. Just Eat (+3%) is higher after delivering strong results whilst BP (+0.8%) is also fuelled post-earnings. Mining names are underperforming amid falling base metal prices influenced by the dollar bid. Other noticeable movers include FTSE 100 heavyweight British American Tobacco (-0.8%), lagging behind following a downgrade at Piper Jaffray.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index faced some resistance around recent highs and the 200DMA (91.980), but has worked its way through some hefty buy/sell orders in G10 pairings at key levels along with big barriers and other major technical obstacles to cross the 92.000 marker and register a fresh high since mid-January. The 2018 peak at 92.640 (from January 12th) is next on the radar for bulls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound&rsquo;s misfortunes rumble on and the latest bearish catalysts have come in the form of a sub-forecast UK manufacturing PMI plus weak consumer credit and mortgage approvals. Cable has tumbled through 1.3700 as a result, and through decent bids in the high 1.3670 area, with sellers now eyeing chart &lsquo;support&rsquo; just ahead of 1.3650, while Eur/Gbp is testing 0.8800 offers again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/NZD/AUD/JPY/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All around 0.3-0.4% weaker vs the Greenback, with the Eur/Usd breaching several major downside technical levels on the way to testing a 1.2035-30 Fib area, including 1.2055 and 1.2050 barriers. Aud and Nzd are only just holding above the well documented and obvious 0.7500/0.7000 psychological and round number handles, with the former not getting any support from the RBA overnight (stood pat on rates and maintained a neutral policy stance), while the Kiwi is awaiting latest GDT auction results and NZ jobs data. Usd/Jpy briefly capped by supply at 109.50 and the recent peak just a few pips above, but now testing Fib resistance at 109.65, while Usd/Chf is extending gains above 0.9900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still a relative outperformer among majors or at least more resistant against the broader Usd bid, with 1.2900 capping the pair amidst ongoing progress towards a NAFTA accord and buoyant oil prices, albeit off Israel-Iran inspired extreme peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A notable underperformer beyond the G10, as Eur/Sek extends its post-dovish Riksbank rally towards 10.6500 ahead of a big Swedish stock dividend payment day on May 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran Foreign Minister tweets Iran allegations are old allegations that have already been dealt with by the IAEA. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Pompeo stated that Israel&#39;s nuclear files on Iran are real and that many are new, while US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stated that President Trump is still considering the Iran agreement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House is said to be mulling restrictions on China researchers amid trade dispute. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s been a gradual uptick to marginal new Liffe highs of 122.42 (+16 ticks vs -13 ticks at one stage), but another downturn in BoE rate hike expectations (now circa 16% for May 10) has translated to more divergence between UK debt and core bond counterparts. Indeed, US Treasuries remain underwater, albeit a few ticks off overnight session lows ahead of more potentially market-moving data on FOMC day 1 and amidst some speculation that the Fed may upgrade its assessment of inflation in the post-policy meeting statement on Wednesday. Note, however, the UST curve is flatter again vs a shallower UK profile after the latest downbeat macro releases.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Post the climb seen in oil on Monday following increased pressure on the US by Israel to pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal, oil pared back some of these gains, with both WTI and Brent down slightly amid the firmer USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has fallen to a six week low following the stronger USD which continued its rise toward 3 month highs. Metals markets remain sensitive to the news that Trump has extended steel and aluminium tariffs for Canada, EU, Mexico, among others. Note, volumes overnight were contained by widespread market closures including China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian crude exports have hit 2.61mln BPD in April, a record figure. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yield curve flattened on Monday on a combination of month-end and softish data, causing the 10yr yield to retreat from last week&rsquo;s best levels, falling to sub-2.94%. While most of the action was concentrated in the long-end of the curve (30s yields down c.2bps at settlement), all the major yield spreads were narrowing; 5s30s flattened by c.1bps the lowest spread in more than six years. Ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding Announcement, the US Treasury borrowed USD 488bln in Q1, expectations are to issue USD 75bln in net marketable debt in Q2, down USD 101bln previous estimate, and USD 273bln in net marketable debt in Q3. Elsewhere, BTPs underperformed their peers on Monday after Italy&rsquo;s 5SM leader Di Maio called for a fresh election in June. Following the election in March, talks between parties have largely failed and no successful attempts were made to form a government. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 4 ticks higher at 119-20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump effectively extended tariff relief for EU and other allies for a month to June 1st and is said to finalize agreement to exempt South Korea on steel. The reports stated that US delayed the deadline for decision for EU, Canada and Mexico, while US reached agreements in principle regarding tariffs with Argentina, Australia and Brazil. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US proposed an increase of regional content value in autos to be increased to 75% from 62.5% with the content to be implemented in 4 years for light vehicles and 2 years for trucks, while there were also comments from Mexico&#39;s automaker association AMIA that the US proposal is not viable given the situation of the industry in North America.

Indeed, US Treasuries remain underwater, albeit a few ticks off overnight session lows ahead of more potentially market-moving data on FOMC day 1 and amidst some speculation that the Fed may upgrade its assessment of inflation in the post-policy meeting statement on Wednesday.

The index has however received a boost from the weakening sterling following softer UK Manufacturing PMIs. Just Eat (+3%) is higher after delivering strong results whilst BP (+0.8%) is also fuelled post-earnings. Mining names are underperforming amid falling base metal prices influenced by the dollar bid. Other noticeable movers include FTSE 100 heavyweight British American Tobacco (-0.8%), lagging behind following a downgrade at Piper Jaffray. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index faced some resistance around recent highs and the 200DMA (91.980), but has worked its way through some hefty buy/sell orders in G10 pairings at key levels along with big barriers and other major technical obstacles to cross the 92.000 marker and register a fresh high since mid-January. The 2018 peak at 92.640 (from January 12th) is next on the radar for bulls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound&rsquo;s misfortunes rumble on and the latest bearish catalysts have come in the form of a sub-forecast UK manufacturing PMI plus weak consumer credit and mortgage approvals. Cable has tumbled through 1.3700 as a result, and through decent bids in the high 1.3670 area, with sellers now eyeing chart &lsquo;support&rsquo; just ahead of 1.3650, while Eur/Gbp is testing 0.8800 offers again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/NZD/AUD/JPY/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All around 0.3-0.4% weaker vs the Greenback, with the Eur/Usd breaching several major downside technical levels on the way to testing a 1.2035-30 Fib area, including 1.2055 and 1.2050 barriers. Aud and Nzd are only just holding above the well documented and obvious 0.7500/0.7000 psychological and round number handles, with the former not getting any support from the RBA overnight (stood pat on rates and maintained a neutral policy stance), while the Kiwi is awaiting latest GDT auction results and NZ jobs data. Usd/Jpy briefly capped by supply at 109.50 and the recent peak just a few pips above, but now testing Fib resistance at 109.65, while Usd/Chf is extending gains above 0.9900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still a relative outperformer among majors or at least more resistant against the broader Usd bid, with 1.2900 capping the pair amidst ongoing progress towards a NAFTA accord and buoyant oil prices, albeit off Israel-Iran inspired extreme peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A notable underperformer beyond the G10, as Eur/Sek extends its post-dovish Riksbank rally towards 10.6500 ahead of a big Swedish stock dividend payment day on May 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A relatively reserved bullish/dovish reaction in Gilts and Short Sterling to yet more disappointing UK data/survey indicators that will further depress expectations of a near term BoE rate hike. The 10-year bond has climbed to 122.39, +13 ticks vs -13 ticks at the Liffe low, while the 3 month strip is flat to 1 tick ahead vs 2 ticks adrift at worst. However, Cable continues to collapse and has now lost grip of another big figure at 1.3700, while Eur/Gbp is nudging back up towards 0.8800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Post the climb seen in oil&nbsp;on Monday&nbsp;following increased pressure on the US by Israel to pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal, oil pared back some of these gains, with both WTI and Brent down slightly amid the firmer USD. In terms of energy newsfllow, the EIA reported a record high of 10.26mln bpd production in February, with a jump of 260k bpd, and US crude inventories likely rising by 1.3mln barrels last week, with this slowing the fossil fuels rise from Israeli declarations&nbsp;on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has fallen to a six week low following the stronger USD which continued its rise toward 3 month highs. Metals markets remain sensitive to the news that&nbsp;Trump has extended steel and aluminium tariffs for Canada, EU, Mexico, among others.

As such, the greenback held on to recent gains with the <strong>DXY</strong> close to 92.000 which has kept its main counterparts subdued, with <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> below the 1.2100 level where it had met resistance during US trade. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and related crosses were rangebound with <strong>JPY</strong> holding on to most of the prior day&rsquo;s risk-averse flows into the safe-haven, while <strong>AUD</strong> nursed some losses as it bided its time heading into the RBA rate decision which proved to be a non-event as the central bank kept policy unchanged as unanimously expected and mostly rehashed its prior policy statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Australian RBA Cash Rate (May) 1.50% vs. Exp. 1.50% (Prev. 1.50%).</strong> (Newswires) RBA reiterates that steady policy is consistent with growth and inflation targets, while it also repeated that low rates supports the domestic economy and that a stronger AUD would slow economic pick-up.

While most of the action was concentrated in the long-end of the curve (30s yields down c.2bps at settlement), all the major yield spreads were narrowing; 5s30s flattened by c.1bps the lowest spread in more than six years. Ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding Announcement, the US Treasury borrowed USD 488bln in Q1, expectations are to issue USD 75bln in net marketable debt in Q2, down USD 101bln previous estimate, and USD 273bln in net marketable debt in Q3. Elsewhere, BTPs underperformed their peers on Monday after Italy&rsquo;s 5SM leader Di Maio called for a fresh election in June. Following the election in March, talks between parties have largely failed and no successful attempts were made to form a government.

        "content": "<p>Today sees the latest RBA rate decision in which expectations are one-sided for the central bank to keep the Cash Rate Target unchanged at the record low 1.50% for a 19th consecutive month. This is reflected in the ASX 30-Day interbank cash rate futures which indicate 100% expectations for no change in rates, while the implied yield curve also continues to suggest that March 2019 is the earliest date for when expectations are leaning more towards a 25bps hike rather than for the central bank to remain on hold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent commentary from the central bank have all been reiterations as RBA Governor Lowe repeated that it is more likely the next move in the cash rate will be up rather than down although the board does not see a strong case for raising interest rates in the near term, while RBA Assistant Governor Kent also shared the view that the next move in rates is likely to be a hike but that there is no particular rush. This rhetoric is inline with the minutes from the April meeting where the board agreed there was not a strong case for near term move in policy and agreed the next likely shift in rates would be upwards. Furthermore, the minutes reiterated that a strengthening AUD would slow expected pace of economy and noted progress on inflation and unemployment is likely to be gradual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the data also suggests that the RBA is unlikely to begin rate normalization soon as latest inflation figures showed softer than expected headline CPI for Q1 at 1.9% vs. Exp. 2.0% (Prev. 1.9%) and although the RBA&#39;s preferred Trimmed Mean CPI topped estimates at 1.9% vs. Exp. 1.8% (Prev. 1.8%), this was still below the central bank&#39;s 2%-3% target. In addition, jobs data has disappointed with Employment Change at 4.9k vs. Exp. 20.0k (Prev. 17.5k, Rev. -6.3k), amid a contraction in Full Time Employment -19.9k (Prev. 64.9k, Rev. 20.1k).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate decision is scheduled for 0530BST/2330DT/1230HKT, although the announcement is not expected to trigger a significant movement in markets given the one-sided expectations and the RBA&#39;s recent propensity to rehash its policy statements.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equity markets trade positive, although lack firm impetus amid mass closures in the region and following the negative lead from Wall St where sentiment was dampened amid geopolitical concerns. This was due to Israel&rsquo;s ructious rhetoric on Iran which it alleged had lied on its nuclear program, while the telecoms sector led the declines amid doubts the T-Mobile-Sprint merger would get regulatory approval. ASX 200 (+0.5%) saw energy names underpinned on higher oil prices following Israel&rsquo;s exposure of Iran and the possible implications it could have on the nuclear agreement, while financials also gained after big 4 bank ANZ reported over 4% profit growth. Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) is also in the green but with price action indecisive as it begins its 2-day trading week and ponders over the recent JPY strength. Elsewhere, there wasn&rsquo;t much price action elsewhere with mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan among the markets shut for public holiday, while US equity futures are off prior lows amid mild short covering and after reports the US effectively extended tariff relief for its allies by delaying its decision by another month to June 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trade in FX markets has also been quiet amid the absence of participants in the region for Labour Day which will also be followed by the numerous closures across the European continent today. As such, the greenback has held on to recent gains with the DXY close to 92.000 which has kept its main counterparts subdued, with EUR/USD below the 1.2100 level where it had met resistance during US trade. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and related crosses are rangebound with JPY holding on to most of the prior day&rsquo;s risk-averse flows into the safe-haven, while antipodeans are lacklustre with AUD biding time ahead of the RBA rate decision later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher to track the prior day&rsquo;s upside in T-notes and with the BoJ present in the market under its bond buying programme, while yields were lower across the curve with outperformance seen in super-long bonds.</p>\r\n",
