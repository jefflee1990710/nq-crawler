(Newswires)<br />Fed stated that inflation has moved close to its &ldquo;symmetric&rdquo; inflation target of 2% and is expected to &#39;run near&#39; that level over the medium term. Fed stated employment growth has been strong on average and growing moderately, while it added that risks to the economic outlook appear to be roughly balanced. Furthermore, the Fed now characterises inflation as &ldquo;moved close&rdquo; to 2% (previously it was described as &ldquo;continued to run below 2%&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: There was an initial but delayed dovish reaction to the statement with the &ldquo;symmetric&rdquo; reference to its inflation target eventually interpreted as the idea that the Fed would be prepared to allow an overshoot of inflation without taking aggressive action to rein in price pressures. However, the dovish reaction seen in the greenback was then fully pared as participants then digested another crucial tweak in which the Fed now characterises inflation as &ldquo;moved close&rdquo; to 2% (previously it was described as &ldquo;continued to run below 2%&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is said to be considering curbs on Chinese telecom firms over national security concerns.

But futures deviated little from the 2650-mark pre-Fed. However, following the Fed, equities caught a slight bid, albeit temporary, and resumed the slide heading into the close. Meanwhile, earnings today were dominated by Apple (AAPL) who reported an EPS of $2.73 on Tuesday, higher than the expected $2.69; revenue was a touch light coming in at 61.14bln against expected $61.2bln. However, shares surged after market following the announcement of $100bln share repurchase programme and a dividend increase of 16% to $0.73. In terms of unit sales, iPhone sales were a slight miss at 52.2mln, against the expected 53mln whilst iPads and Macs slightly exceeded expectations. Apple led the DJI for Wednesday&rsquo;s session, Gilead (GILD) reported after market on Tuesday where EPS and revenues both missed analyst expectations which pressured the NDX, GILD were the underperformer in the index. SPX -0.72% at 2635, NDX -0.56% at 6644, DJI -0.73% at 23923.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were higher on Wednesday after the Treasury&rsquo;s increased auction sizes announced at Quarterly Refunding weren&rsquo;t as aggressive as some had anticipated (feared). The package for May was $73bln (versus $66bln previously). Treasury sees the sizes of the 2- and 3-year note auctions being raised by $1bln per month (vs $2bln in Q1), and in addition, it will increase the auction size of the next 2-year FRN auction by USD 1bln in May. The Treasury will also raise the auction sizes by $1bln for each of the next 5-, 7-, and 10-year notes and the 30-year bond auctions in May. It also intends to introduce a new 2-month bill later this calendar year, and is evaluating whether to add a second new 5-year TIPS security to the annual TIPS calendar. Treasuries found buyers after the announcement, before easing a touch heading into the FOMC decision; after the FOMC was interpreted as dovish, the curve found more buyers, leaving yields around c. 2bps lower across the curve at settlement; 2s30s, 5s30 and 2s10s, 5s10s widened by a modest c.2bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 4+ ticks higher at 119-16+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 2 May 2018: Fed unchanged, crude looks through inventory data, ADP in line. ",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: </strong>Equities down, Treasuries up, DXY up, Crude up.<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW: </strong>Fed on hold as expected, tweaks statement; ADP inline.<br /><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>After-market earnings; TSLA, KHC, ISRX, AIG, MET, PRU; Thurs earnings: DWDP, K, ADS GY, BAYN GY. Flash Apr EZ CPI, ECB speak (Constancio, Praet, Coeure); Non-MFG ISM; Norges Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FEDERAL RESERVE: </strong>The Fed kept rates unchanged at 1.50-1.75%, as expected. The statement, however, saw a few crucial tweaks: the Fed now characterises inflation as &ldquo;moved close&rdquo; to 2% (previously it was described as &ldquo;continued to run below 2%&rdquo;), and additionally, it added word &ldquo;symmetric&rdquo; with regards to its inflation target, which traders eventually interpreted as the idea that the Fed would be prepared to allow an overshoot of inflation without taking aggressive action to rein in price pressures, and subsequently (in a, once again, delayed reaction) the market&rsquo;s reply was dovish. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>DATA:</strong> Ahead of Friday&rsquo;s payrolls data, ADP reported that&nbsp;204K&nbsp;jobs were added to the US economy in April, more-or-less in-line against an expected 198K. Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that the numbers tend to be less responsive to weather effects than the official payroll figure, since it is based on macro data, as well as data collected from firms that use ADP&rsquo;s payroll services. Nonetheless, Pantheon does not expect a significant effect attributable to weather in April and thus should provide a positive signal ahead of the official payroll figure&nbsp;on Friday. Once again, analysts warned that the ADP data is not a definitive guide to the official payrolls figures, and Capital Economics says that recently it has been even less useful. Over the previous six months, the average difference between the ADP and BLS measures of private employment growth has been as high as 80,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHINA TRADE:</strong> ahead of the Bejing trade talks meeting which will be attended by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, NEC Director Kudlow, President Assistant Advisor Navarro and US Trade Representative Lighthizer, China commented that it is unrealistic to expect one meeting to solve problems; Earlier, a Chinese official stated the country will not give into threats from the US on trade while the US is considering curbs on Chinese telecom firms over national security concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>Mexico&#39;s Deputy Economy Minister Baker sees a 80% chance for NAFTA deal being agreed this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The Brexit customs partnership model has been rejected by the &quot;war cabinet,&rdquo; according to the BBC; it was one of two models proposed by the government and would remove the need for new customs checks at the border, with the other option a streamlined customs arrangement which would minimise checks using technology and trusted trader schemes. Following the news, there were reports that UK PM May told a Minister that the UK will leave the Customs Unions. Elsewhere, the House of Lords once again defeated the government, backing powers to prevent a hard border in Ireland; the defeat was the government&rsquo;s tenth defeat in Brexit legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB SPEAK: ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann (Hawk)</strong> stated market expectations for first hike around mid-2019 is not unrealistic, adding that monetary normalisation will take some time, and it is important not to unnecessarily postpone the beginning of tightening. He also mentioned that worries about approaching the end of the Eurozone&rsquo;s economic upswing are exaggerated while the current guidance on timing of the first hike is quite vague.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RIKSBANK: </strong>Riksbank <strong>Governor Ingves</strong> said if Swedish rates rise too quickly, the SEK would strengthen and inflation will likely fall. He added that the inflation/currency impact of a rate rise would be a &ldquo;difficult trade off&rdquo; and also said that he believes the SEK will continue to strengthen. Elsewhere, he said supervisors have a &ldquo;weak hand&rdquo; to deal with overheating housing market, and also argued that there was still scope for the Riksbank to use monetary tools to help stoke inflation and support the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.72% at 2635, NDX -0.56% at 6644, DJI -0.73% at 23923 SECTORS:</strong> Cons Cyclicals: -0.89%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.71%, Energy: +0.39%, Financials: -1.44%, Health Care: -2.00%, Industrials: -0.93%, Materials: -0.42%, Technology: -0.02%, Telecoms: -1.76%, Utilities: -0.14%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Emini futures in overnight trade slipped after news that Trump could potentially face a subpoena if he refused to testify as part of the Russian probe. But futures deviated little from the 2650-mark pre-Fed. However, following the Fed, equities caught a slight bid, albeit temporary, and resumed the slide heading into the close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Earnings today were dominated by Apple (AAPL) who reported an EPS of $2.73 on Tuesday, higher than the expected $2.69; revenue was a touch light coming in at 61.14bln against expected $61.2bln. However, shares surged after market following the announcement of $100bln share repurchase programme and a dividend increase of 16% to $0.73. In terms of unit sales, iPhone sales were a slight miss at 52.2mln, against the expected 53mln whilst iPads and Macs slightly exceeded expectations. Apple led the DJI for Wednesday&rsquo;s session, Gilead (GILD) reported after market on Tuesday where EPS and revenues both missed analyst expectations which pressured the NDX, GILD were the underperformer in the index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* M&amp;A news today focused around Xerox (XRX) which reached an agreement with Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason over the proposed merger with Fujifilm, XRX CEO is to resign and is going to be replaced by Icahn Enterprises CEO, Keith Cozza, as well as the appointment of 6 new board members. During Wednesday trade source reports suggested Apollo Global Management (APO) approached XRX showing acquisition interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Late trade saw source reports that Amazon (AMZN) is to offer retailers discounts if they use Amazon Pay, this had a knock-on effect for PayPal (PYPL) who spiked to fresh lows and saw intraday declines of over 4%. Mastercard (MA), Square (SQ), Visa (V) and American Express (AXP) were all hit as well, however not to the same extent as PYPL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI settles $0.68 higher at $67.93/bbl; Brent settles $0.23 higher at $73.36/bbl. </strong>Crude shrugged off bearish API (after-market Tuesday) and DOE data on Wednesday (Crude +6.218M vs. exp. 0.739M, crude production +0.31% to 10.619mln bpd, Cushing +0.416mln, Distillate -3.9mln vs. exp. -1.360mln, Gasoline +1.17mln vs. exp.&nbsp; -0.587mln, refining utilisation +0.3% vs. exp. 0.6%.) Analysts suggest that it signals that the market&rsquo;s attention is firmly fixed on the geopolitical situation in Iran, where the US will decide by 12/May whether to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord and reinstate sanctions (the consensus view is that this would drive crude higher as supply tightens, and Iran is hindered from raising foreign investment to finance boosting capacity).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s energy minister again said the OPEC+ supply cut pact will run through the end of 2018. Separately, an IMF official said Saudi Arabia needs oil prices around $85 to $87/bbl to balance its budget. In Russia, May oil production was reported to be in line with the April data around 10.97mln BPD, an 11-month high.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Elsewhere in the energy complex, Colonial said it was investigating an issue on lines 3, 4, 25 and 27, providing few details, sending RBOB higher (The Colonial Pipeline delivers more than 100mln gallons of refined products daily).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong><strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 4+ ticks higher at 119-16+. </strong>Treasuries were higher on Wednesday after the Treasury&rsquo;s increased auction sizes announced at Quarterly Refunding weren&rsquo;t as aggressive as some had anticipated (feared). The package for May was $73bln (versus $66bln previously). Treasury sees the sizes of the 2- and 3-year note auctions being raised by $1bln per month (vs $2bln in Q1), and in addition, it will increase the auction size of the next 2-year FRN auction by USD 1bln in May. The Treasury will also raise the auction sizes by $1bln for each of the next 5-, 7-, and 10-year notes and the 30-year bond auctions in May. It also intends to introduce a new 2-month bill later this calendar year, and is evaluating whether to add a second new 5-year TIPS security to the annual TIPS calendar. Treasuries found buyers after the announcement, before easing a touch heading into the FOMC decision; after the FOMC was interpreted as dovish, the curve found more buyers, leaving yields around c. 2bps lower across the curve at settlement; 2s30s, 5s30 and 2s10s, 5s10s widened by a modest c.2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> <strong>DXY:</strong> The index and broad Dollar has broken out of earlier tight confines to the upside and consolidate above 92.65 pre-Fed. However, the DXY slipped after the FOMC decision, with the statement interpreted as dovish, and traders booking some profits on the stellar gains printed by the Greenback in recent sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>AUD, NZD:</strong> The only 2 G10 currencies to weather the latest bout of all-round buck buying, and then only just as AUDUSD and NZDUSD cling to positive territory on the day slightly above 0.7500 and 0.7000 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Another relative outperformer after some rare good news on the data front, with April&rsquo;s construction PMI beating expectations after Tuesday&rsquo;s manufacturing miss, and ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s services survey. Cable did fall sub-1.36 pre-Fed after the buck was bought in early US trade and extended losses in late trade post-Fed, focus now on the 200 DMA at 1.3536.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EURGBP was capped at 0.88 for most of the session, but did find ground above it as the US day neared an end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> CHF, JPY:</strong> Both remain weaker against the dollar despite late USD selling post-Fed. Earlier in the session EURUSD lost the 1.20 level and falling to lows above 1.1950; the next support to the downside is 1.1936 (Fib), then the 1.1916 YTD base before 1.1900. USDJPY broke 110.00 very slightly, though couldn&rsquo;t hold onto gains at those lofty levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>USDCAD did regain the 1.2850 pivot amidst less positive NAFTA and tariff developments, and was consolidating are the level as we moved towards the close. MXN was also hit for similar reasons,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*TRY:</strong> Ratings cut woes weighing heavily on the Lira as USDTRY rebounds towards highs within a broad 4.0000-4.2000 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*SEK:</strong> The Krona depreciated further to circa 10.6750 vs the Eur amidst comments from Riksbank chief Ingves underlining that hiking rates too early risks too much SEK strength and downside inflation pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Norges Bank will publish its monetary policy decision at 09:00 BST /10.00 CET on May 3<sup>rd</sup>; it is expected to keep rates unchanged at 0.50% on Thursday, but is likely to signal its hiking cycle will start after summer.

Analysts suggest that it signals that the market&rsquo;s attention is firmly fixed on the geopolitical situation in Iran, where the US will decide by 12/May whether to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord and reinstate sanctions (the consensus view is that this would drive crude higher as supply tightens, and Iran is hindered from raising foreign investment to finance boosting capacity).

However, the question remains whether the FOMC fuels the latest rally or whether the Usd buying is premature and stalls or reverses after the event.

The tech giant eventually reported a beat on EPS, announced a USD 100bln share repurchase authorization and raised dividends by 16%, although it slightly missed on revenue and iPhone sales; shares were higher by around 5% after-market which fuelled further upside in Nasdaq 100 futures to above 6700. US equity futures have since pulled-back from highs amid a bout of selling following reports that Special Counsel Mueller suggested the possibility of a subpoena if President Trump refuses to speak to investigators, although the pressure was suppressed shortly after it was determined this was from a meeting with Trump lawyers back in March. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.6%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) </strong>traded mixed as earnings dictated price action. <strong>Shanghai Comp. (flat)</strong> and <strong>Hang Seng (-0.3%) </strong>traded subdued despite initial gains in mainland on return from the extended weekend as it took its first opportunity to react to better than expected Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI data. However, the picture then gradually deteriorated following the Caixin Manufacturing PMI which also topped estimates but showed Export Orders shrank for the first time since November 2016. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful amid similar price action in T-notes and as stocks took much of the focus, while the results of an enhanced-liquidity for 2yr-20yr also failed to spur demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI (Apr) 51.1 vs. Exp. 50.9 (Prev. 51.0).

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European markets have returned on an upbeat tone (Eurostoxx +0.4%) with all major bourses in the green following mass closures in the region yesterday. Germany&rsquo;s DAX 30 is outperforming its peers after breaching its 200DMA to the upside. All sectors are firmly in the green with outperformance in materials as miners are lifted amid higher copper prices. The tech sector is feeling a boost following Apple&rsquo;s earnings post-market yesterday with the likes of Infineon (+3.4%) and STMicroelectronics (+4.9%) at the top of their respective indices. On the downside, earnings dampened the likes of Paddy Power Betfair (-5.9%), Swisscom (-3.1%) and Direct Line Insurance (-3.2%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback has eased off best levels across the board awaiting more fundamental direction from the FOMC later today, but figuratively speaking the next major move may well depend on several big figures that have been tried and tested, but not yet breached. In terms of the Dollar index, a base does appear to be forming at 92.000 after several approaches towards the 92.640 ytd peak and a rebound in US Treasury yields is supportive, albeit partly supply-related ahead of the Quarterly Refunding. Technically, 92.515 is a key Fib for the DXY that has yet to be cleared convincingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest beneficiaries of a pause in the Greenback&rsquo;s advance, but in truth largely due to the fact that both antipodeans have borne the brunt of losses when trading below 0.7500 and 0.7000 respectively. No real positive momentum for the Kiwi from rather indifferent NZ jobs data overnight, but Nzd/Usd has rebounded relatively firmly above the big figure again, as Aud/Usd retains its round number status and the cross straddles 1.0700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some respite for the floundering Pound as the UK construction PMI returns to growth and beats consensus to break the recent run of disappointing macro leads. Cable has bounced firmly above 1.3600, to just over 1.3650 and Eur/Gbp is back below 0.8800, but Sterling is far from out of the firing line amidst yet more Brexit-related political divisions and uncertainty over the EU withdrawal bill on customs union and Irish border dispute among other contentious issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pivoting around the 1.2000 marker vs the Usd having traded below the 200 DMA for the first time in around 12 months yesterday, and the headline pair now looking prone to more downside if that key technical level fails to hold (1.2016).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has resumed its overall recovery from recent 1.2900 and above lows vs the Usd in wake of Tuesday&rsquo;s better than forecast Canadian GDP report, with more impetus emanating from a more confident if not hawkish BoC Governor Poloz. Usd/Cad is now looking at more bids said to be sitting between 1.2820-00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both sitting pretty tight vs the buck having just survived tests of notable levels that could have accelerated recent losses on breaks of 110.00 and parity respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t fight the Fed springs to mind given negative price action in bonds, but Gilts have independent catalysts behind the deeper downturn to a 121.82 Liffe low (-62 ticks vs -13 ticks at best) following a much better than anticipated rebound in the UK construction PMI and recent marked outperformance vs peers. Bunds have also extended losses, to 30 ticks at 158.44, in wake of firmer than forecast Eurozone manufacturing PMIs and GDP data overall, along with a somewhat mixed German 5 year tap. Meanwhile, US Treasuries remain on the defensive ahead of the aforementioned FOMC, but perhaps just as cautious if not more apprehensive in advance of the refunding announcement. The 10 year yield is inching closer to 3%, with 30 years just above 3.15% and 2 year cash over 2.51%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, crude fails to remain supported by ongoing speculation that the US could withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal. Tuesday&#39;s API report revealed an increase 3.4mln in crude inventories, 0.7mln build in Cushing, Gasoline build by 1.6mln and showing a draw in distillates of 4.0mln .&nbsp; In the metals sector, Gold is also sitting in positive territory in the context of a falling Dollar. Copper has also bounced from a monthly low following Chinese manufacturing sector data that suggested improving domestic demand in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly Crude Stocks (27 Apr) +3.427M vs. Exp. +0.700M (Prev. 1.099M).

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Special Counsel Mueller suggested the possibility of a subpoena to Trump&#39;s lawyers during a meeting in March if US President Trump declines to speak with investigators in Russia investigation. (Washington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Apple (AAPL) reported an EPS of USD 2.73, higher than the expected USD 2.69, revenue was a touch light coming in at 61.14bln against expected USD 61.2bln.</strong> However shares surged after market following the announcement of USD 100bln share repurchase programme and a dividend increase of 16%. In terms of unit sales, iPhone sales were a slight miss at 52.2mln, against the expected 53mln whilst iPads and Macs modestly exceeded expectations. Apple traded higher after market by as much as 5%.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European markets have returned on an upbeat tone (Eurostoxx +0.5%) with all major bourses in the green following mass closures in the region yesterday. Germany&rsquo;s DAX 30 is now outperforming its peers after breaching its 200DMA to the upside. All sectors are firmly in the green with outperformance in materials as miners are lifted amid higher copper prices. The tech sector is feeling a boost following Apple&rsquo;s earnings post-market yesterday with the likes of Infineon (+3.4%) and STMicroelectronics (+3.7%) at the top of their respective indices. On the downside, earnings dampened the likes of Paddy Power Betfair (-6.3%), Swisscom (-4.3%) and Direct Line Insurance (-3.8%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, crude continues to remain supported by ongoing speculation that the US could withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal with prices also aided today by a marginally softer USD.&nbsp; Upside also comes in spite of&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday&#39;s API report which revealed&nbsp;a 3.4mln build in crude, 0.7mln build in Cushing, Gasoline building by 1.6mln and showing draws of 4.0mln.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the metals sector, Gold is also sitting in positive territory in the context of a falling Dollar. Copper has also bounced from a monthly low following Chinese manufacturing sector data that suggested improving domestic demand in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback has eased off best levels across the board awaiting more fundamental direction from the FOMC later today, but figuratively speaking the next major move may well depend on several big figures that have been tried and tested, but not yet breached. In terms of the Dollar index, a base does appear to be forming at 92.000 after several approaches towards the 92.640 ytd peak and a rebound in US Treasury yields is supportive, albeit partly supply-related ahead of the Quarterly Refunding. Technically, 92.515 is a key Fib for the DXY that has yet to be cleared convincingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest beneficiaries of a pause in the Greenback&rsquo;s advance, but in truth largely due to the fact that both antipodeans have borne the brunt of losses when trading below 0.7500 and 0.7000 respectively. No real positive momentum for the Kiwi from rather indifferent NZ jobs data overnight, but Nzd/Usd has rebounded relatively firmly above the big figure again, as Aud/Usd retains its round number status and the cross straddles 1.0700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some respite for the floundering Pound as the UK construction PMI returns to growth and beats consensus to break the recent run of disappointing macro leads. Cable has bounced above 1.3600 and Eur/Gbp is back below 0.8800, but Sterling is far from out of the firing line amidst yet more Brexit-related political divisions and uncertainty over the EU withdrawal bill on customs union and Irish border dispute among other contentious issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pivoting around the 1.2000 marker vs the Usd having traded below the 200 DMA for the first time in around 12 months yesterday, and the headline pair now looking prone to more downside if that key technical level fails to hold (1.2016).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has resumed its overall recovery from recent 1.2900 and above lows vs the Usd in wake of Tuesday&rsquo;s better than forecast Canadian GDP report, with more impetus emanating from a more confident if not hawkish BoC Governor Poloz. Usd/Cad is now looking at more bids said to be sitting between 1.2820-00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both sitting pretty tight vs the buck having just survived tests of notable levels that could have accelerated recent losses on breaks of 110.00 and parity respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t fight the Fed springs to mind given negative price action in bonds, but Gilts have independent catalysts behind the deeper downturn to a 121.98 Liffe low (-1/2 point exactly vs -13 ticks at best) following a much better than anticipated rebound in the UK construction PMI and recent marked outperformance vs peers. Bunds have also extended losses, to 30 ticks at 158.44, in wake of firmer than forecast Eurozone manufacturing PMIs and GDP data overall, along with a somewhat mixed German 5 year tap. Meanwhile, US Treasuries remain on the defensive ahead of the aforementioned FOMC, but perhaps just as cautious if not more apprehensive in advance of the refunding announcement. The 10 year yield is inching closer to 3%, with 30 years just above 3.15% and 2 year cash over 2.51%.</p>\r\n",

No real positive momentum for the Kiwi from rather indifferent NZ jobs data overnight, but Nzd/Usd has rebounded relatively firmly above the big figure again, as Aud/Usd retains its round number status and the cross straddles 1.0700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some respite for the floundering Pound as the UK construction PMI returns to growth and beats consensus to break the recent run of disappointing macro leads. Cable has bounced above 1.3600 and Eur/Gbp is back below 0.8800, but Sterling is far from out of the firing line amidst yet more Brexit-related political divisions and uncertainty over the EU withdrawal bill on customs union and Irish border dispute among other contentious issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pivoting around the 1.2000 marker vs the Usd having traded below the 200 DMA for the first time in around 12 months yesterday, and the headline pair now looking prone to more downside if that key technical level fails to hold (1.2016).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has resumed its overall recovery from recent 1.2900 and above lows vs the Usd in wake of Tuesday&rsquo;s better than forecast Canadian GDP report, with more impetus emanating from a more confident if not hawkish BoC Governor Poloz. Usd/Cad is now looking at more bids said to be sitting between 1.2820-00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/CHF </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both sitting pretty tight vs the buck having just survived tests of notable levels that could have accelerated recent losses on breaks of 110.00 and parity respectively.</p>\r\n",

The tech giant eventually reported a beat on EPS, announced a USD 100bln share repurchase authorization and raised dividends by 16%, although it slightly missed on revenue and iPhone sales; shares were higher by around 5% after-market which fuelled further upside in Nasdaq 100 futures to above 6700. US equity futures have since pulled-back from highs amid a bout of selling following reports that Special Counsel Mueller suggested the possibility of a subpoena if President Trump refuses to speak to investigators, although the pressure was suppressed shortly after it was determined this was from a meeting with Trump lawyers back in March. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) traded mixed as earnings dictated price action. Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (-0.6%) traded subdued despite initial gains in mainland on return from the extended weekend as it took its first opportunity to react to better than expected Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI data. However, the picture then gradually deteriorated following the Caixin Manufacturing PMI which also topped estimates but showed Export Orders shrank for the first time since November 2016. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful amid similar price action in T-notes and as stocks took much of the focus, while the results of an enhanced-liquidity for 2yr-20yr also failed to spur demand.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FTSE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AstraZeneca (AZN LN) &ndash;</strong> Vague takeover chatter was noted yesterday, with Roche (ROG SW) as a potential acquirer; unconfirmed.

The tech giant eventually reported a beat on EPS, announced a USD 100bln share repurchase authorization and raised dividends by 16%, although it slightly missed on revenue and iPhone sales; shares were higher by around 5% after-market which fuelled further upside in Nasdaq 100 futures to above 6700.

However, the picture then gradually deteriorated following the Caixin Manufacturing PMI which also topped estimates but showed Export Orders shrank for the first time since November 2016.

As such, <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures were mildly higher overnight and back above the USD 67/bbl with a larger than expected build in API crude inventories largely ignored amid fatigue following the prior day&rsquo;s descent.

The yield curve bear-steepened on Tuesday with the 30yr yields higher by c.4bps whilst the 2yr higher by c.2.5bps at settlement. Most of the action was seen in the long-end of the curve, however, despite the bear-steepening, 2s30s and 5s30s modestly narrowed by around 1bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 8 ticks lower at 119-12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US Special Counsel Mueller suggested the possibility of a subpoena to Trump&#39;s lawyers during a meeting in March if US President Trump declines to speak with investigators in Russia investigation</strong>.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat mixed following a similar close on Wall St. where stocks rebounded from the initial data-triggered selling pressure and the Nasdaq outperformed in anticipation of Apple earnings. The tech giant eventually reported a beat on EPS, announced a USD 100bln share repurchase authorization and raised dividends by 16%, although it slightly missed on revenue and iPhone sales. Nonetheless, the buyback announcement was the determining factor and Apple shares were higher by around 5% after-market which fuelled further upside in Nasdaq 100 futures to above 6700. US equity futures have since pulled-back from highs amid a bout of selling following reports that Special Counsel Mueller suggested the possibility of a subpoena if President Trump refuses to speak to investigators, although the pressure was suppressed shortly after it was determined this was from a meeting with Trump lawyers back in March. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are mixed as earnings dictates price action with Japan Tobacco and Qantas among the leaders in their respective markets after the announcement of their results. Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) and Hang Seng (-0.6%) are also varied with the mainland just about keeping afloat on return from the extended weekend as it takes its first opportunity to react to better than expected Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI data, which was also followed up by Caixin Manufacturing PMI topping estimates but showed Export Orders shrank for the first time since November 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY took a breather from yesterday&rsquo;s advances but remains above the 92.00 level. This has provided only mild respite for its major counterparts with EUR/USD and GBP/USD just about holding on to the 1.2000 and 1.3600 handles respectively, while the PBoC also adjusted its CNY reference rate to the weakest since January in response to the recent USD advances. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slightly pulled back ahead of the 110.00 level and on the suggested Trump subpoena reports, while NZD is choppy around 0.7000 following mixed jobs data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid similar price action in T-notes and with stocks taking much of the focus, while participants also await the results of an enhanced-liquidity auction later.</p>\r\n",
