        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: Robust NFP stokes yields, hammers stocks",
        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX -2.2% at 2761, DJIA -2.6% at 25510, NDX -2.1% at 6760</strong><br />Top sectors: Utilities -0.4%, Consumer cyclicals -0.5%, Healthcare -0.9%<br />Bottom sectors: Energy -4.0%, Tech -2.7%, Telecoms -2.6%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dow and S&amp;P endured torrid sessions, putting in one of their worst one-week declines in around two-years, while the VIX jumped to levels last seen in November. All sectors were red. Equities were taking their cue from the TPlex this week, with investors concerns about the bond sell-off souring risk sentiment, with the theme exacerbated today by a robust NFP report for January.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were some bright spots, however. Amazon surged after a decent earnings report released aftermarket on Thursday. However, the other tech giants didn&rsquo;t fare as well, with Alphabet and Apple both getting hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Note futures settle -15+ ticks at 120-23+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The curve bear-steepened, helped along by a solid NFP report which, in addition to the hawkish FOMC this week, has pushed yields on the long end higher. US30s now yield 3.10%, rising 9bps on the day, while 10s have popped above 2.85%. But despite higher yields, only 2s5s and 2s10s were steeper (2s10s just shy of 70bps, the steepest since November); 2s30s narrowed by over 6bps, 5s30s were more modestly narrower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next week, the US auctions 3s, 10s and 30s, offering higher amounts, following this week&rsquo;s quarterly refunding announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY closes the week flat after stellar NFP, hawkish Fed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In wake of the solid NFP report, the USD saw choppy price action, with most of the gains coming against the CAD, JPY and EUR. Some desks were impressed that the post-payrolls price action wasn&rsquo;t faded as aggressively as it had been in previous reports. The DXY made its way back up towards the 89.20 level, which has acted as key support/resistance in recent days, taking the DXY back to flat levels for the week following six straight weeks of negative finishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CAD bore the brunt of dollar gains, with USDCAD popping above 1.24, though the air proved too thin for the pair at those levels, with price action settling beneath the figure. The Loonie did find some knee-jerk strength, however, after comments from Canada PM Trudeau was quoted as saying that he was prepared to walk away from NAFTA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AUD and NZD were also major losers against the USD, with the former giving up on the .80 handle, and the latter finding support at .73.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The JPY and CHF were sold, with the former aided by widening yield differentials after the BOJ offered to buy unlimited quantities of 10-year JGBs at 11bps (first time since January). While GBP sank, it managed to defend the 1.41 handle ahead of next week&rsquo;s BOE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Post FOMC, gold has been haunted by the spectre of three or more hikes in 2018, and looks to close out Friday at weekly lows sub $1,330.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMFX complex was hit by USD strength, with real money said to be buying USD/EM (particularly USDZAR and USDTRY).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 35 cents lower at USD 65.45 per barrel; Brent futures settle $1.07 lower at $68.58 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friday&rsquo;s weakness was inspired by a stronger dollar and equities markets tanking. However, crude did manage to bounce slightly from lows near $64.50 for WTI, and sub-$68.00 for Brent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baker Hughes rig count data showed drillers adding oil rigs for the second week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count (Feb 2) 946 (Prev. 947)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />US Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count (Feb 2) 765 (Prev. 759)<br />US Baker Hughes Gas Rig Count (Feb 2) 181 (Prev. 188</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Stellar NFP report keeps Dollar on an even keel",
        "content": "<p>The Usd looks all set to extend its early February revival or at least continue to consolidate off worst levels in wake of an all round forecast beating first US monthly jobs report of 2018 (headline payrolls exceeded consensus and rose an eye-catching 200k, but trumped by earnings at 2.9% that also came with an upward revision to the previous month). The data propelled already rising US Treasury yields to new heights and the Greenback got an extra helping hand from White House advisor Cohn backing a strong Usd. Eur/Usd recoiled towards 1.2400 vs 1.2500+ pre-NFP and almost up to ytd peaks (1.2537), with stops tripped at 1.2430, but support at 1.2410 just holding. Usd/jpy rallied through layered offers and a key Fib ahead of 110.00 to top out just below 110.50, Cable retreated to 1.4125 from circa 1.4275 and Usd/Cad also witnessed a 100+ pip about turn from 1.2250 to 1.2400 approx, having breached its 10 DMA at 1.2348 on the way. Usd/Chf cemented recover gains above 0.9300 from lows near 0.9255, while Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd both pulled back further from upside round numbers (0.8100 and 0.7400 respectively) to 0.7925 and 0.7300 &ndash; former pair initially finding some support around its 20 DMA at 0.7978. Usd/EMs climbed across the board, but the question is does this mark a turnaround in the Buck&rsquo;s fortunes or merely draw a temporary line in the sand.&nbsp; Looking ahead, for the Antipodean Dollars and Sterling next week&rsquo;s CB meetings could be the next drivers and provide independent direction &ndash; previews of the 3 policy gatherings below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first <strong>Bank of England (BoE)</strong> monetary policy decision of 2018 will conclude on Thursday, with consensus looking for the BoE to stand pat, with a 9-0 vote. The decision will be accompanied by the latest Quarterly Inflation Report (QIR). The noted risk to consensus is that either/both hawks within the MPC (Saunders and McCafferty) cast a dissenting vote in favour of another hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the BoE last convened official statistics revealed that the UK economy expanded by 0.5% Q/Q in Q4 (against the BoE&rsquo;s forecast of 0.4%). On the inflation front, CPI has peaked (for now), oil prices have risen by circa 13% and the GBP has moved higher on a trade weighted basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citi suggest that &ldquo;new BoE forecasts may reflect somewhat stronger growth and higher inflation rates, although the Bank will likely remain cautious due to Brexit uncertainty&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/inflation-report/2017/november-2017\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\">November&rsquo;s QIR can be found here</a>). Citi also posit that &ldquo;the MPC&rsquo;s supply assessment could lead to higher slack estimates, which would be dovish. But also lower potential growth. That would set a lower speed limit and thus be hawkish.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE rhetoric since the last meeting has towed the line, in that it is consistent with the view portrayed in November&rsquo;s QIR. Governor Carney has noted that wages are picking up, but conceded that they are not growing spectacularly, he also reiterated that he expects investment in the UK to pick up in 2019. The Governor has also suggested that inflation pass through due to the exchange rate shock has further to go, and that he expects inflation to remain above 2% in the near future. Carney also stressed that any unwind of QE will be well telegraphed when the time comes. Elsewhere BoE hawk Saunders noted that it is likely that interest rates will need to rise further over time and that any further tightening will be limited and gradual. Saunders also noted that Brexit could push BoE policy in either direction and reiterated that he expects the labour market to continue to tighten. Finally, BoE newcomer Tenreyro stated that at the December meeting, she saw &#39;ample time&#39; before the BoE would need to raise rates again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking forwards, more focus seems to be place on May&rsquo;s decision, with several investment houses looking for further tightening at that particular meeting, with interest rate markets currently pricing in a little over 50% chance of a hike in May. UBS are one of those looking for a May hike, &ldquo;if a transitional deal has been struck, while we still expect the Brexit process to generate strengthening headwinds for the UK economy for a considerable time, the stronger than expected outturn for Q4 GDP and the better momentum the economy starts 2018 with as a result could give the MPC a window of opportunity to raise Bank Rate.&rdquo; However, the bank does concede that &ldquo;there are growing doubts about whether the UK and EU will agree on a transitional deal by the time of the EU Council Summit in late March, and failure to do so would in our opinion stay the MPC&#39;s hand as uncertainty intensifies and the economy slows more materially.&rdquo; Barclays are in line with consensus and expect the next hike to come in November of this year, although they do note that &ldquo;risks to our call are tilted towards an earlier hike.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <strong>Australia</strong> focus will fall on the <strong>Reserve Bank of Australia&rsquo;s (RBA)</strong> monetary policy decision, due on Tuesday. Consensus looks for the RBA to stand pat, with only 1 of the 48 surveyed by Reuters looking for the RBA to implement a 25bps hike. The recent Q4 inflation release was slightly softer than expected when looking at the headline, however the RBA&rsquo;s preferred trimmed mean metric held steady at 1.8% Y/Y, below the bottom end of the RBA&rsquo;s 2-3% band. In his final address of 2017 RBA Governor Philip Lowe noted that &ldquo;the continuing spare capacity in the economy and the subdued outlook for inflation mean that there is not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy.&rdquo; There has been little in the way of fresh developments surrounding household debt and consumer demand but ANZ are looking for a more upbeat tone in the statement &ldquo;after a positive run of data both domestically and globally. The higher AUD provides a bit of an offset and may see some refinement to the RBA&rsquo;s commentary around the currency, but its move in trade weighted terms since November is minimal and commodity prices are stronger, so we don&rsquo;t think there will be that much concern about the impact of the higher.&rdquo; It is also worth noting that Governor Lowe will speak on Thursday and the Bank will issue its quarterly forecast update on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ)</strong> will convene and issue its first monetary decision of 2018 on Thursday, with all of those surveyed expecting the central bank to stand pat. Most believe that interim Governor Grant Spencer will act as a placeholder, before Adrian Orr assumes the role in March. As a result, consensus looks for a the Reserve Bank to maintain its balanced assessment and to emphasise that interest rates are likely to remain low for a considerable period of time. It is also worth noting that a new Policy Targets Agreement (PTA) is yet to be signed. ASB suggest that &ldquo;the published forecasts should depict a solid outlook for economic outlook. The low inflation starting point and higher than expected NZD could result in marginal downward tweaks in the published Official Cash Rate profile, but given pending changes in the monetary policy framework, financial markets should tread cautiously on drawing too much into any tweaks.&rdquo; The aforementioned soft Q4 CPI release was perhaps not as weak as the headlines suggested, as the domestic inflationary pressures were more positive than the tradeables side of the release which weighed on the headline. Nonetheless, markets reacted to release pushing out expectations of the first rate increase at the RBNZ from November 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. Westpac are more sanguine than the majority as, noting that they &ldquo;have long argued that inflation will prove lower than the RBNZ expects, and continue to forecast OCR hikes only from late-2019.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

Looking at levels in more detail, Bunds slumped to 157.71 and just shy of the next chart support seen at 157.65 before a bounce, Gilts hit a fresh contract low at 120.92 and the 10 year T-note breached 121-00 on the way down to 120-23. Conversely, the Greenback has been given a welcome boost with the DXY back on the 89.000 handle, with Usd/Jpy now through 110.00 and into a fresh higher trading range and testing a key Fib level at 110.37 as we write. Some consolidation now and into upcoming data, but the data is likely to keep fixed under pressure and the Usd at least on a recovery path, if not able to fully reverse trend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) were mixed with Australia kept afloat by financials and energy, while the Japanese benchmark was the laggard and saw nearly all the prior day&rsquo;s gains wiped out. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) were downbeat amid Shenzhen volatility, while continued inaction by the PBoC also resulted to a weekly net liquidity drain of CNY 760bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs reversed the initial spill-over selling from US, with support from a risk averse tone and after the BoJ Rinban announcement in which it increased purchases in the 5yr-10yr range. Furthermore, the BoJ also effectively placed a cap on yields as it offered to buy an unlimited amount in 10yr JGBs at a yield of 0.110%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ announced to buy JPY 450bln in 5yr-10yr (Prev. JPY 410bln), JPY 190bln in 10yr-25yr and JPY 80bln in 25yr+ JGBs, while it also announced a special bond operation to buy an unlimited amount of 10yr JGBs at a yield of 0.110%. However, there were no takers for the fixed rate operation and the BoJ stated it took the steps after a surge in yields and that it is adhering to policy of keeping 10yr yield near 0%.

Underperformance has been seen in the DAX (-1.1%) with the index dragged lower by Deutsche Bank (-6.1%) after reporting a larger than expected quarterly loss; Commerzbank (-1.5%) also seen lower but little contagion seen in the broader European banking sector. Elsewhere, energy names are the only sector trading higher in Europe alongside firmer energy prices, telecoms underperform with BT (-5.5%) at the bottom of the FSTE 100 following their latest earnings update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY remains weak overall as its 2018 (and late 2017) bear trend continues, but the index is holding in above 88.500 and some key support levels ahead of the 88.000 level. In fact, the Dollar is firmer vs all G10 rivals as US Treasury yields continue their ascent and some benchmark maturities hit key or psychological levels (long bond over 3% for example). EUR/USD is pivoting around 1.2500, Cable still finding it tough on advances beyond 1.4200, USD/Cad sticky circa 1.2300 and similarly USD/CHF bouncing back towards 0.9300 after forays below. USD/JPY is still gradually firming within a wide 109.00-110.00 range, and sniffing out layered offers up to the top of that band, with a 50% Fib at 109.88 also providing some resistance. The Greenback is performing best against its antipodean counterparts, with AUD/USD remaining top heavy around 0.8000, but underpinned so far by near term support (20 DMA at 0.7978), and NZD/USD unable to sustain gains above 0.7400, but finding some support near 0.7350 as the AUD/NZD cross retreats below 1.0900. JPY undermined by more aggressive BoJ buying of JGBs overnight, NZD by weak building permits and the AUD extending recent losses/underperformance on disappointing data and rolled out RBA rate expectations. Ahead, NFP the main Friday focus.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A near escape for the UK&rsquo;s construction sector, with the headline only just maintaining expansion in January, and this has helped Gilts stave off a more concerted challenge of the 121.00 level, for now at least. However, the core debt future has been down to 121.12 for a 68 tick decline from Thursday&rsquo;s close as the 10 year yield approaches 1.6%, while Bunds have already extended Eurex losses to 158.00 (-60 ticks), which equates to 0.75% in cash terms. In short, bond bears remain in the driving seat with 10 and 30 year US Treasury yields now topping 2.80% and 3.05% respectively, and the benchmark 10s T-note future looking vulnerable only just above 121-00. US jobs data the next key risk event and 200k or above with consensus or better earnings could be the trigger for fixed to fall further.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures have modestly extended on the prior day&rsquo;s gains, albeit off best levels with WTI back below USD 66/bbl and Brent retreating from USD 70/bbl with energy newsflow otherwise relatively light ahead of the Baker Hughes rig count and earnings from Exxon and Chevron (keep an eye out for CAPEX plans). In metals markets, Gold has traded relatively sideways ahead of NFP, whilst Chinese steel futures were seen higher overnight amid ongoing speculation over further extensions to domestic steel production curbs.</p>\r\n",

In metals markets, Gold has traded relatively sideways ahead of NFP, whilst Chinese steel futures were seen higher overnight amid ongoing speculation over further extensions to domestic steel production curbs.</p>\r\n",

Usd/Jpy is still gradually firming within a wide 109.00-110.00 range, and sniffing out layered offers up to the top of that band, with a 50% Fib at 109.88 also providing some resistance. The Greenback is performing best against its antipodean counterparts, with Aud/Usd remaining top heavy around 0.8000, but underpinned so far by near term support (20 DMA at 0.7978), and Nzd/Usd unable to sustain gains above 0.7400, but finding some support near 0.7350 as the Aud/Nzd cross retreats below 1.0900. Jpy undermined by more aggressive BoJ buying of JGBs overnight, Nzd by weak building permits and the Aud extending recent losses/underperformance on disappointing data and rolled out RBA rate expectations.

Moreover, there is little in the way of chart support for the core Eurex 10 year debt future ahead of 158.00, with the next real downside technical objective not seen until 157.65, while the latest ECB impulses are hawkish via Nowotny (QE should stop now) and sources (more precise post-QE rate guidance appropriate).

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mostly lower with sentiment in the region dampened amid a lack of catalysts and following the indecisive lead from Wall St. where most major indices finished negative and the Nasdaq 100 underperformed. ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) were mixed with Australia kept afloat by financials and energy, while the Japanese benchmark was the laggard and saw nearly all the prior day&rsquo;s gains wiped out. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) were downbeat amid Shenzhen volatility, while continued inaction by the PBoC also resulted to a weekly net liquidity drain of CNY 760bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs reversed the initial spill-over selling from US, with support from a risk averse tone and after the BoJ Rinban announcement in which it increased purchases in the 5yr-10yr range. Furthermore, the BoJ also effectively placed a cap on yields as it offered to buy an unlimited amount in 10yr JGBs at a yield of 0.110%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, most major pairs were indecisive overnight amid a lack of key data releases and speakers, which has kept participants looking towards the upcoming NFP jobs report for a better catalyst. USD/JPY traded choppy in which it was initially pressured by safe-haven flows but then later supported after the BoJ upped its Rinban purchases and announced a special buying operation, while antipodeans weakened in which AUD/USD retested a breakdown of the 0.8000 level and NZD/USD met resistance at the 0.7400 handle.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp.

USD/JPY trades choppy in which it was initially pressured by safe-haven flows, but was then supported after the BoJ upped its Rinban purchases and announced a special buying operation, while antipodeans are weaker as AUD/USD reapproaches 0.8000 to the downside and after NZD/USD met resistance at the 0.7400 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with support seen amid a risk averse tone and after the BoJ Rinban announcement in which it increased purchases in the 5yr-10yr range and also effectively announced a cap on the 10yr yield as it offered to buy an unlimited amount in 10yr JGBs at a yield of 0.110%</p>\r\n",
