(Newswires/Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond is confident that UK PM May will get her message across to EU leaders and confident the government will deliver a Chequers Brexit deal for Britain. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Minister Raab said we need the EU side to move in our direction in Brexit talks and it will be a lose-lose for both sides if we don&rsquo;t get that movement. Raab also ruled out a second referendum and said Chequers is the only credible plan, while he also believes a deal is close and that it is a little late in the day for an alternative Brexit proposal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Treasury Minister Mel Stride had earlier commented there could be another referendum if PM May&#39; Chequers proposals are rejected by the commons. (Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Juncker said the EU and the UK are far away from a Brexit deal, while Irish PM Varadkar also stated UK and EU are no closer to a Brexit deal than they were in March and reiterated Ireland would suffer in a no-deal scenario.&nbsp; (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Chancellor Merkel said there will be no decisions made at the Salzburg summit and that they are slowly coming into the final phase of Brexit negotiations.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Advisor Hassett commented that the US is ready to move ahead with Mexico deal without Canada. Furthermore, Hassett believes US and China will reach an agreement and have lots of room to get a deal, while he also stated they are ready to give aid to US farmers if required and that the aim is to get China to stop misbehaving.

As 10-year yields continue to rise, strategists have begun to question high far they will need to rise before markets react with a tantrum. There wasn&rsquo;t any signs of discomfort in Wednesday&rsquo;s trade, with the 10yr yield climbing to a high around 3.09%. Earlier in the week, GS said it wouldn&rsquo;t be considered a meaningful sell-off until 3.05% was cleared, which could then open the door to 3.109%, the high from May. The 5-year sector was also capturing attention, with yields closing in on decade-highs. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 7+ ticks lower at 118-18.</p>\r\n",

White House Advisor Hassett also comforted on this front stating he believes that the US and China will reach an agreement noting they have lots of room to get a deal; he stands ready to give aid to US farmers if required and stresses his aim is to get China stop misbehaving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>White House advisor Hassett said the US is ready to move ahead with a Mexico deal without Canada. However, sources reported that a US/Canada NAFTA deal is unlikely this week. Elsewhere, Canada PM Trudeau and Foreign Minister Freeland &ndash; the latter who is back in Washington for talks with the USTR &ndash; made their familiar noises, without offering up any new info.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Ahead of her meeting with EU leaders, The Times reported that UK PM May will reject EU Brexit Negotiator&rsquo;s Irish backstop proposals (that Northern Ireland would effectively remain in the customs union and single market to avoid a hard border with Ireland), and describe them as unacceptable since they do not respect &ldquo;the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.&rdquo; Separately, May penned an op-ed in German media calling on the EU to compromise and move towards a position that is acceptable for the UK and the EU. Separately, she gave an interview to UK press, stating that agreement with the EU was virtually done. The FT Wednesday reported that UK PM May will &#39;go over the head&#39; of EU Brexit negotiator Barnier, appealing directly to EU leaders to reach a deal that does not involve detaching Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The approach may risk upsetting some EU leaders; Ireland Tuesday said that the UK should focus on negotiations in Brussels rather than other European capitals. On the subject of a second Brexit referendum, UK Brexit Minister Raab echoed the view of the PM in rejecting the notion. Ahead of the dinner with PM May, EU&rsquo;s Juncker stated EU and UK are far away from a Brexit deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US special envoy to Iran said that the US was seeking to negotiate a treaty with Iran that would include Tehran&#39;s ballistic missiles programme and its regional behaviour. Iran has so far rejected high level talks with the US after Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* HOUSING STARTS </strong>rose by 9.2% in August and posted at 1.282mln, above the 1.235mln consensus. Wells Fargo, however, notes the gains were driven by multifamily starts, which rose by 1.9%, though noting the component is often subject therefore this strong release is unlikely to signal an improvement in homebuilding, given that affordability and supply concerns are preventing</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.1% at 2908, NDX -0.1% at 7490, DJI +0.6% at 26401. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +0.4%, Materials +1.1%, Industrials -0.1%, Cons Discretionary +0.1%, Cons Staples -0.2%, Healthcare -0.1%, Financials +1.8%, Tech -0.1%, Telecoms -1.4%, Utilities -2.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>BorgWarner (BWA) was among the top performers, shrugging off PT cuts at Cowen, JPM and RBC. Praxair (PX) was higher on news that Linde (LINU GY) will sell more assets to try and salvage its merger. E*TRADE (ETFC) got a positive mention at Jefferies, and CNBC noted unusual options activity, helping the shares rise further). Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) was higher, buoyed by copper prices rising. Prudential (PRU) announced additional appointments to its board as part of its leadership succession plan. Juniper (JNPR) was upgraded at Nomura. Copart (CPRT) was hit following weak earnings, taking its place at the foot of the performer list. Valero (VLO)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES $1.27 HIGHER AT $71.12/BBL; WTI (X8) SETTLES $1.18 HIGHER AT $70.77, BRENT (X8) SETTLES $0.37 HIGHER AT $79.40/BBL</strong>. Crude was firm, with analysts at Citi citing the strength in WTI to October contract expiry on Thursday leading to some book squaring. Perhaps that is why markets shrugged off the unexpected 1.2mln barrel build in crude stocks in the week. Elsewhere, the DOE data reported Cushing stocks -1.250mln vs. exp. -2.2mln, distillates +0.839mln vs. exp. 0.651mln, gasoline -1.719mln vs. expected -0.104mln; crude production rose 0.92% to 11.00mln bbls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 7+ TICKS LOWER AT 118-18 </strong>. Bear-steepening was the theme once again, with steepening, with major curve spreads widening by between 1-3bps. As 10-year yields continue to rise, strategists have begun to question high far they will need to rise before markets react with a tantrum. There wasn&rsquo;t any signs of discomfort in Wednesday&rsquo;s trade, with the 10yr yield climbing to a high around 3.09%. Earlier in the week, GS said it wouldn&rsquo;t be considered a meaningful sell-off until 3.05% was cleared, which could then open the door to 3.109%, the high from May. The 5-year sector was also capturing attention, with yields closing in on decade-highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The greenback has been meandering around neutral on Wednesday, amid no new news of trade wars, a lack of speakers (FOMC meeting next week), and no A-list data on the slate. SocGen writes &quot;the dollar rally has run out of steam somewhat and the high-beta FX sell-off likewise, yet we lack a catalyst for a meaningful reversal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling has endured a roller-coaster session, surging above 1.32 after inflation data surprised to the upside, while the tone of commentary relating to Brexit also offers traders reasons for cautious optimism. However, it fell heavily after news that May is set to reject Barnier&rsquo;s Irish backstop proposal, returning back to a 1.30 handle temporarily. The pound has stabilised around the 1.3150 level ahead of PM May&rsquo;s dinner withy EU leaders. Lloyds Bank&#39;s techs are keeping an eye on the 1.3170 level, arguing that a close above it could augur a recovery back to the 1.33-1.35 region; if not, it sees support at 1.3110-1.3060 (and if those levels break, a more significant correction is possible towards channel support in the 1.2870 region, the bank says).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Once again, despite USD weakness, the EUR is unable to build on 1.17, with today&rsquo;s range between 1.1650-1.1715. Morgan Stanley says it remains bullish of European FX (SEK, NOK, GBP, EUR), and suggests keeping an eye on EURJPY, which it says could lead the rally upwards, given Italian bonds are seeing inflows: &quot;FXhedged BTPs and volatility-adjusted BTP yields are attractive for Japanese investors,&quot; MS writes, &quot;while first round effects are EUR-neutral, it is the tightening BTP spread, in conjunction with better EMU economic data including wages, leading to equity inflows (which are less FX-hedged) and pushing EUR front-end rates higher,&quot; adding that EURJPY breaking its 200DMA at 131.10 &quot;is meaningful.&quot; EURJPY was straddling that 200DMA on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>The Aussie was buoyed by industrial metals, where copper hit a three-week high on a weaker USD and after the latest rounds of China-US tariffs undershot expectations (and China&rsquo;s policymakers made calm, measured comments). That helped the AUD clear its 21DMA, and lead to some desks making the case that the AUD has built a base which could open the way for a test of the 55DMA, before eyeing 0.7360-80. With that said, some have noted that the long retail positioning could temper enthusiasm. The Kiwi shrugged-off overnight, data showing consumer confidence falling to a six-year low, and a widening current account deficit, instead takings its cue from</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK: </strong>Ahead of the Norges Bank&#39;s meeting on Thursday, the NOK has been trading around neutral. It is the top performing G10 FX this month, underpinned by firming oil prices and the hawkish tone out of the Norges Bank. A 25bps rate hike is expected tomorrow, however, SocGen says that USDNOK bears will also require the 2019 rate path to indicate a high probability of three rate rises next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>A relative calm has set in following the latest round of trade tensions, seeing some EM FX stage a modest relief rally. Analysts at ING, however, remain cautious, and have doubts around the persistence of EM FX gains given risks of further trade war escalation ahead of the US mid-terms, as well as ongoing idiosyncratic risks (the potential US sanctions on Russia, the renewed weakening of TRY). &quot;On the EM side, the ongoing rise in oil prices and its pro-inflationary effect is likely to keep pressure on local central banks to keep real rates attractive,&quot; the bank warns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP - BRAZIL CENTRAL BANK RATE DECISION DUE AROUND 2200 BST/1700 EST.</strong> Brazil&#39;s central bank is expected to hold the Selic rate at 6.50%, with the consensus of the view that the Copom will look through any near-term inflationary pressures due to the BRL&#39;s recent slide, as well as the trucker&#39;s strike. &quot;Core inflation aggregates remain repressed, speaking to the degree to which the negative output gap has persisted,&quot; TD Securities writes. &quot;The market continues to price in too little a risk that rates remain on hold for at least another 5 months, making shorter-term rates (and BRL) look attractive, though political uncertainty remains a notable risk factor.&quot; Some analysts, however, are looking for tightening at the September meeting; analysts at SocGn expect a hike, though it notes that there is risks to that forecast. &quot;We continue to believe that BRL depreciation has meaningfully affected the inflation outlook and that things will worsen further on both the BRL and inflation front in the coming quarters,&quot; SocGen writes. &quot;The communication will again be the key for future meetings and we expect the BCB to release a definitively hawkish statement in September, even if a rate hike is not implemented,&quot; SocGen adds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: SNB TO PUBLISH ITS RATE DECISION AND ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS AT 0830 BST/0930 CET</strong>. The central bank is expected to hold rates, and reiterate a willingness to intervene in FX; the inflation profile could be raised in 2018, 2019 could be lowered slightly. The SNB is not expected to move rates until well-after the ECB has begun its hiking cycle, analysts say. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20122/download\">To download the report, please click here.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: NORGES BANK RATE DECISION DUE 0900 BST. </strong>The Norges Bank is unanimously expected to hike interest rates by 25 bps to 0.75% at their September 20th Monetary Policy Meeting Analysts are keeping an eye out for changes to the rate path forecast that currently signals 1 hike in 2018 with 2 hikes per year flagged in 2019 and 2020. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20120/download\">Click here to read full preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP &ndash; SARB RATE DECISION DUE FROM 1400 BST ON 20 SEPTEMBER 2018</strong>. The SARB is expected to hold rates unchanged at 6.50% at its meeting on Thursday 20th September. Given Central Banks in the EM space have recently undergone policy tightening, a hawkish SARB stance may reverse recent ZAR momentum, analysts say. Economic fundamentals have been weakening as the latest inflation release was softer than expected. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20124/download\">Click here to read the full preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling is ending the midweek (EU) session relatively unchanged vs the Usd and Eur, but this does not even begin to tell half the story as the Pound was pulled from pillar to post by UK data and latest Brexit headlines. Already at multi week peaks, Cable was boosted further by above forecast headline CPI and soaked up at least some 1.3200+ offers before pulling back as longs booked profit and then retreating sharply on reports refuting claims that the EU has really softened its stance on the Irish border. However, Cable has reclaimed the 1.3100 handle since as UK Brexit Minister Raab backs up PM May&rsquo;s assertion that a deal is close at hand and subsequent comments from EC President Tusk verify that several Chequers proposals are positive, but Ireland and future trade terms remain bones of contention. Eur/Gbp is currently back under 0.8900, but off lows around key chart support (100 DMA circa 0.8863).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All among the leading G10 pack, but for quite different reasons as the antipodeans extend their rebounds from recent lows on dissipating US-China trade tensions, or at least less punitive import tariffs than had been threatened at the outset of the latest set of proposed levies. Aud/Usd just off 0.7260 highs and Nzd/Usd easing back from 0.6600+ peaks, with the Kiwi now looking towards NZ GDP for some independent impetus. Turning to the Scandi crowns, and hawkish Central Bank vibes are underpinning the Sek and Nok following rhetoric from Riksbank&rsquo;s Ohlsson reiterating reservations against latest repo rate guidance that pushed back hike timing, and ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s Norges Bank policy meeting that is widely tipped to culminate in a 25 bp tightening and perhaps come with a steeper path for further normalisation. Eur/Sek down around 10.3600 and Eur/Nok circa 9.5100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stark contrast to the above, the Franc has retreated markedly ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s SNB quarterly review and a very likely underlining if not upgraded view of the Chf&rsquo;s status along the various grades of words used to measure relative strength. Usd/Chf back up near 0.9700 and Eur/Chf close to 1.1300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrowly mixed vs the recovering Greenback (DXY not far from 94.700 vs 94.317 at one stage), with Usd/Jpy rangy between 112.00 option expiries and 112.50 barriers, the Loonie losing momentum ahead of 1.2925 and reversing towards 1.3000 following several less positive NAFTA reports (deal unlikely this week and US ready to go ahead without Canada and sign off on a bilateral agreement with Mexico and Eur/Usd slipping a bit further below 1.1700 and not far from light stops said to be sitting at 1.1650.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) was positive with outperformance in miners and energy names following gains in copper and crude oil, while Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) outperformed on a weaker JPY and better than expected trade data. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.1%) were initially indecisive due to the uncertainty from the escalation of trade tensions and after the PBoC slowed down on its liquidity efforts, but then shrugged off the concerns alongside the widespread gains in the region and with risk sentiment also underpinned by comments from Premier Li who noted several measures to support companies and dismissed resorting to a devaluation of the currency. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded lower amid the outperformance of Japanese stocks but with losses contained as participants were somewhat tentative heading into the BoJ which proved to be a non-event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 40bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 20bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net neutral position.

Furthermore, Li said China will not resort to forceful stimulus and will not engage in competitive weakening of the currency, nor will it devalue the currency to boost exports. Li also commented they will fine tune policy pre-emptively and will cut taxes and fees as well as ease funding difficulties for companies, while he noted that China&#39;s economy maintains steady growth and fundamentals are healthy but difficulties for maintaining growth are increasing. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ kept all monetary policy settings unchanged as expected with NIRP held at -0.1% and 10yr JGB yield target at around 0%. The BoJ also maintained its forward guidance in which it will keep current extremely low rates for an extended period of time and maintained pledge to buy JGBs in a flexible manner so holdings rise at an annual pace of about JPY 80tln. Furthermore, the decision on YCC was made by 7-2 vote with Kataoka and Harada the dissenters as Kataoka dissented on view inflation will speed up to the 2% target and board member Harada said guidance which could clarify price target was needed.

PM May also stated neither side can demand the unacceptable such as customs border between parts of the UK, while she added that Britain is not seeking EU membership rights without the obligations and believes she is proposing a fair agreement, according to a senior Downing Street source. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is reportedly to bypass EU Chief Brexit negotiator Barnier in a drive to win over EU leaders, while it is speculated that she will use the Salzburg meeting to seek a compromise solution for the Irish border.

The FTSE 100 (-0.2%) lags its peers amid the firmer GBP (post-CPI).

Kingfisher (-5.0%) shares were dealt a blow after announcing a 15% decline in profits with markets also unimpressed by the latest update from Adecco (-4.8%) after the co. forecast a slowdown in revenue growth. To the upside, Babcock (+4.8%) leads the charge for the Stoxx 600 after sticking to their guidance, whilst Commerzbank (+2.8%) are also seen higher after a broker upgrade at RBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Among the G10 outperformers, but off best levels on a combination of technical selling around resistance, profit taking and the realisation that 2.7% y/y UK CPI vs the 2.4% consensus will not materially change the BoE policy outlook in the near term at least. Indeed, that rests largely on Brexit developments and the kind of deal that appears to remain on course to be agreed by November. Cable spiked above 1.3200 at one stage, but ran in to heavy offers above the big figure and up to 1.3215, while Eur/Gbp retreated from 0.8900 again before testing but not clearing its 100 DMA around 0.8863 or stops below convincingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD -The antipodean Dollars continue to benefit from US-China trade relief in light of reduced tariffs on both sides and the prospect that the next set of proposed import charges may yet be avoided altogether if Washington and Beijing talk to each other before September 24. Aud/Usd is trying to extend relief gains beyond 0.7250 having overcome chart resistance around 0.7229, while the Kiwi is hovering above 0.6600 ahead of NZ GDP data that will be the next domestic focus, if not driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD - Also bid vs a broadly soft Greenback, but the single currency is still struggling to make a clean break above 1.1700 amidst reported decent offers between 1.1720-50, while the Loonie is around 1.2950 in the run up to more NAFTA talks and testing the first band of offers seen up to 1.2940.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - The &lsquo;safe-havens&rsquo; are still lagging the major field with Usd/Jpy pivoting a 112.38 Fib, but the pair holding or capped just in advance of 112.50 barrier interest, while the Franc has reversed relatively sharply from near 0.9600 peaks yesterday back below 0.9650 and under Eur/Chf pre-SNB quarterly policy review tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The revival across the region has resumed, and with the Try and Zar prominent ahead of potentially key/pivotal events on Thursday in the form of the SARB policy meeting and Turkish medium term economic plan. The Rand is back above 15.0000 vs the Usd, and firmly in spite of softer than forecast SA inflation data that should confirm no change in official rates, while the Lira has recovered from recent wobbles to trade over 6.3000 again vs the Dollar</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a very marginal fresh Eurex intraday high, and perhaps scant recognition of what can only be deemed a very well received 2028 Bund offering by all the usual measures used to gauge the success of a tap or new issue, bar perhaps the elevated yield, although that was part of a general ratchet up that improved its attraction. 10 year futures just traded at 158.75, +2 ticks vs -32 ticks at worst, Gilts rebounding from post-UK CPI lows to 120.86 (but notably Short Sterling still as much as 4 ticks adrift) and US Treasuries also paring losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures trade relatively unchanged and in close proximity to recent Saudi-inspired highs with last night&rsquo;s unexpected build in the API survey providing a minimal drag on prices.

Elsewhere, copper in Shanghai hit a one-month high overnight amid support from the broader risk-appetite, with sentiment also propelling zinc to trade with gains of circa 3%. Finally, plans for Chinese infrastructure spending helped underpin steel rebar prices with the metal posting its best daily performance in a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (14 Sep) +1.249M vs. Exp. -2.700M (Prev. -8.636M).

Indeed, that rests largely on Brexit developments and the kind of deal that appears to remain on course to be agreed by November. Cable spiked above 1.3200 at one stage, but ran in to heavy offers above the big figure and up to 1.3215, while Eur/Gbp retreated from 0.8900 again before testing but not clearing its 100 DMA around 0.8863 or stops below convincingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The antipodean Dollars continue to benefit from US-China trade relief in light of reduced tariffs on both sides and the prospect that the next set of proposed import charges may yet be avoided altogether if Washington and Beijing talk to each other before September 24. Aud/Usd is trying to extend relief gains beyond 0.7250 having overcome chart resistance around 0.7229, while the Kiwi is hovering above 0.6600 ahead of NZ GDP data that will be the next domestic focus, if not driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also bid vs a broadly soft Greenback, but the single currency is still struggling to make a clean break above 1.1700 amidst reported decent offers between 1.1720-50, while the Loonie is around 1.2950 in the run up to more NAFTA talks and testing the first band of offers seen up to 1.2940.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;safe-havens&rsquo; are still lagging the major field with Usd/Jpy pivoting a 112.38 Fib, but the pair holding or capped just in advance of 112.50 barrier interest, while the Franc has reversed relatively sharply from near 0.9600 peaks yesterday back below 0.9650 and under Eur/Chf pre-SNB quarterly policy review tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The revival across the region has resumed, and with the Try and Zar prominent ahead of potentially key/pivotal events on Thursday in the form of the SARB policy meeting and Turkish medium term economic plan. The Rand is back above 15.0000 vs the Usd, and firmly in spite of softer than forecast SA inflation data that should confirm no change in official rates, while the Lira has recovered from recent wobbles to trade over 6.3000 again vs the Dollar.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, Barnier stated the October EU leaders meeting will be the &quot;moment of truth&quot; and we will see whether an EU agreement is within reach. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his column in the Telegraph, Jacob Rees-Mogg stated &ldquo;we have one chance to get Brexit right and ridding ourselves of Chequers will let us take it&rdquo;. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Vlieghe said UK pay growth is increasing quite slowly and several indicators suggest low unemployment is making it difficult for employers to find or retain staff. (Newcastle Chronicle)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian Deputy PM Di Maio has stated that Italy are to lift their deficit/GDP ratio level to 2.5%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback was subdued amid range-bound trade in its major counterparts in which EUR/USD was lacklustre after having recently failed to hold above 1.1700, while GBP/USD pared the brief support from optimistic comments by PM May who stated than an exit deal is virtually agreed and that they are nearing an orderly withdrawal agreement. Elsewhere, AUD and CAD both extended on the prior day&rsquo;s commodity-fuelled gains with support also seen as CNH strengthened following Premier Li comments which dismissed competitive currency weakening, while USD/JPY remained firm above 112.00 after the safe-haven outflows from the JPY and with the BoJ policy announcement a non-event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly firmer overnight although WTI crude futures seemed content on resting on the prior day&rsquo;s laurels in which prices briefly broke above USD 70/bbl after reports Saudi Arabia was comfortable with prices above USD 80/bbl. WTI crude has since pulled back from US session highs and proceed sideways during Asia hours, while the latest API inventory report also momentarily weighed as headline crude stockpiles printed a surprise build. Elsewhere, gold just about reclaimed the USD 1200/oz amid a subdued greenback and copper extended on gains amid the broad heightened-risk appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (14 Sep) +1.249M vs. Exp. -2.700M (Prev. -8.636M).

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korean President Moon and North Korean Leader Kim signed join agreement following the conclusion of official summit discussions. North Korean Leader Kim stated they will make the Korean peninsula into a place without nuclear weapons and agreed to visit Seoul. There were also comments from South Korean President Moon that both sides have agreed to eliminate threat of war in the peninsula and agreed measures for denuclearization, while he added North Korea could dismantle Yongbyun nuclear facility and can permit international inspections of dismantlement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that North Korean Leader Kim agreed to allow nuclear inspections, subject to final negotiations, and permanently dismantle a test site in the presence of international experts, while he added North and South Korea will file joint bid to host 2032 Olympics. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury curved bear-steepened on Tuesday, with 2s10s widening by 4bps, 5s30s around 2bps wider, and 2s30s wider by around 5bps (reports of hedge funds initiating steepeners ahead of next week&#39;s FOMC). Yields on 2s and 3s saw fresh decade+ highs. Traders were happy to be sellers on Tuesday after the tariffs that the US announced on Chinese imports, and the Chinese retaliation, was at rates more benign than had been feared. Additionally, policymakers added in their statements the desire to continue constructive talks. Into the North America sessions, sellers were out in force, with rate locks on corporate new issuance and hedge fund positioning ahead of next week&#39;s FOMC no longer offset by the pension community now that the deadline for tax relief has passed, Informa reported. There was also some attention on a four-week bill sale out of the US, which sold at 2.02%. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 10+ ticks lower at 118-25+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said US is having a tremendous impact on China, while he added cannot let China take advantage of us. Trump also noted they may make a deal at some point and that he is always open to talk with China but warned of more tariffs if China retaliates on agricultural industry, while he also commented that a trade deal with South Korea is ready to be signed.

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.0%) were initially indecisive due to the uncertainty from the escalation of trade tensions and after the PBoC slowed down on its liquidity efforts, but then shrugged off the concerns alongside the widespread gains in the region and with risk sentiment also underpinned by comments from Premier Li who noted several measures to support companies and dismissed resorting to a devaluation of the currency. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded lower amid the outperformance of Japanese stocks but with losses contained as participants were somewhat tentative heading into the BoJ which proved to be a non-event.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: Bank of Japan expected to keep policy unchanged today following the more flexible approach announced at the prior meeting",
        "content": "<p>The Bank of Japan will conclude its 2-day policy meeting on Wednesday in which expectations are one-sided for the central bank keep its policy settings unchanged with the bank rate to be maintained at -0.1% and long-term yield target held at around 0.0%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The consensus for the BoJ to remain on hold comes after the July meeting where the BoJ maintained its interest rate and yield target but announced more flexibility and adopted forward guidance on rates which it said will be maintained at very low levels for an extended period. The BoJ also announced it would permit upward and downward moves in 10yr yields but will buy JGBs promptly and appropriately in the event of a rapid increase in yields, while it lowered the balance of reserves for which NIRP is applied and adjusted its ETF purchases for greater Topix and reduced Nikkei/JPX inclusions. Therefore, considering that the BoJ just recently conducted the tweaks at its last meeting, which was aimed at ensuring the sustainability of its ultra-loose policy, it is highly unlikely for the central bank to announce further adjustments so soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent key data releases have been mixed which favours a wait-and-see approach with headline National CPI (0.9% vs. Exp. 1.0%, Prev. 0.7%) and Core CPI (0.8% vs. Exp. 0.9%, Prev. 0.8%) both softer than expected and below the halfway point to the BoJ&rsquo;s target which suggests BoJ are nowhere near to exiting loose policy. In addition, a firm upward revision in Q2 Annualised GDP to 3.0% vs. Exp. 2.6% (Prev. 1.9%) also points to a lack of urgency for further stimulus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the BoJ rhetoric, BoJ Governor Kuroda commented shortly after the last meeting that he sees no need for additional easing for now and that forward guidance means to keep rates extremely low for an extended period of time. Kuroda further added that he expects factors that delayed an increase in inflation to dissipate in the future and that momentum towards 2% inflation is firmly in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, not all are impressed as board member and notorious dovish dissenter Kataoka stated he anticipates little chances for Japan&#39;s economy momentum to reach the price target being heightened under the current framework and that the BoJ didn&#39;t need to allow more flexibility in long-term yields when it was reducing price forecasts. Furthermore, Kataoka commented that BoJ&#39;s new forward guidance only states the obvious and that permitting long-term yields to rise could delay reaching price target, while he proposed that the BoJ should expand stimulus to achieve price target quicker instead of taking measures to prolong the period of easy policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, there is no exact scheduled time for the policy announcement which tends to be any time after the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0330BST/2130CDT/1030HKT, while focus will also be on the statement and the composition of votes which was previously 7-2 for YCC.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
