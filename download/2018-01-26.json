Friday&rsquo;s gains being led by healthcare. The defensive utilities sector was the laggard, but still green.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stock futures largely looked through the softer than expected US advanced GDP print for Q4, and instead took their cue from earnings. Solid earnings from Intel on Thursday helped boost tech stocks; Intel shares were up around 10% to 17-year highs and received a host of broker upgrades.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere on the earnings slate, Abbvie reported top- and bottom-line beat and raised guidance, and the story was similar for Honeywell. Colgate-Palmolive was more in-line with forecasts, while Nextera beat on EPS, but posted a small revenue miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: 10-Year T-Note settles -12 ticks at 122-02</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields were higher on Friday, with the underperformance mostly in the belly of the curve. The sell-off was inspired by a weaker than expected advanced GDP reading for Q4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2s30s, 5s10s and 5s30s curves all narrowed slightly, while 2s5s and 2s10s saw modest widening ahead of next week&rsquo;s FOMC (2s rose to nine year highs), where the central bank is expected to stand pat in outgoing Fed chair Yellen&rsquo;s final meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fed had forecast GDP growth of 2.5% in 2017, and as such, the Q4 data is a touch ahead of their forecasts, leaving it scope to continue on its hiking trajectory, where it has pencilled in three 2018 rate rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Friday, money markets were pricing in a 97% probability that the Fed would keep policy settings unchanged in January, and are pricing in a 60% chance of 3 hikes in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY red for the sixth straight week</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY lost 0.5% on Friday trade, capping off a grim week &ndash; the sixth consecutive week of losses. The dollar was given some reprieve after US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s comments on Thursday (which were on the face of it, contrary to the comments of his Treasury Secretary) when he expressed a desire for a &ldquo;strong dollar&rdquo;. However, he said that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin&rsquo;s comments were apparently &ldquo;even handed&rdquo; and that where the buck is in the short-term was not a concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR again took advantage of the dollar weakness, but failed to test the post-ECB highs printed on Thursday, with price action capped by the 1.25 handle. Next week the docket is packed full of ECB speakers (Coeure, Lautenschlager, Praet, Mersch) that will put into perspective the ECB&rsquo;s latest meeting. Yesterday, sources stories suggested that the ECB remains split about its next move, and the immediate debate centres around when the ECB will amend its forward guidance (March seems to be the consensus).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yen, meanwhile, was among the top performers in the G10 space after BOJ Governor Kuroda again said that he expects only moderate economic growth, and inflation expectations were rising slightly. The comments sent USDJPY to visit the 108.50 mark, and were clearly misinterpreted by the market; later in the session, a BOJ released a statement saying that the governor&rsquo;s comments were not a revision of his views, prompting the yen to retreat to 109.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other havens were bid on USD weakness, and gold continued its rise, settling above $1,350, but the yellow metal didn&rsquo;t manage to test weekly highs around $1,366.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling was lingering around the 1.42 mark, but has backed away from highs against the EUR, despite newsflow over the last couple of days suggesting that Europeans may be more open to a flexible approach to Brexit, including flexibility over the transitional period. On the data front, GDP growth was encouraging, and at 1.8% in 2017, is four times the level most analysts were forecasting after the Brexit referendum. In late US trade, the greenback found some strength, contributing to GBP weaknesss, and pushing cable down towards the 1.4150 area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD advanced against the buck; although CPI fell, we are still knocking around the midpoint of the BOC tolerance band, and all three BOC metrics suggested that the inflationary landscape is firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 63 cents higher at USD 66.14 per barrel, Brent futures settle 10 cents higher at USD 70.52 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Brent and WTI are rounding off a solid week, rising between 3% and 4%. There was no specific, meaningful crude related news explaining Friday&rsquo;s gains, and analysts were content to attribute the rise to stronger stocks, a firmer dollar. Oil drillers added 12 rigs, according to Baker Hughes, the most since March, and the second rise in three weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total (Jan 26) 947 (Prev. 936)<br />- US Baker Hughes Gas (Jan 26) 188 (Prev. 189)<br />- US Baker Hughes Oil (Jan 26) 759 (Prev. 747)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>US officials finally concurred that a &lsquo;strong Dollar&rsquo; is in the country&rsquo;s best interest after mixed messages from Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump at the WECO, but the Greenback&rsquo;s &lsquo;annus horribilis&rsquo; (or January to date) goes on as Usd/Jpy continues to test bids around the 109.00 level and Aud/Usd hovers just below resistance at 0.8100. Technically, the former pair remains weak/bearish while below the 100 WMA (109.90) and prone to another test of 108.50 bids/support, with the Jpy getting a boost from BoJ&rsquo;s Kuroda reportedly claiming that the inflation battle is nearly won. On that note, the Dollar is still fighting against adverse trade and tariff headwinds, with the DXY remaining top heavy and struggling to stage a sustained recovery above 0.8900 having almost cleared nearest chart downside targets (88.423 Fib and 88.282 MMA) when Mnuchin appeared to endorse a weak Usd. Looking at other G10 currencies, Cable rallied to 1.4345 at best (now around 1.4150), the Eur reached circa 1.2535 (vs 1.2430 presently) and Chf 0.9290 (over 100 pips under the current level) amidst or despite verbal intervention from the SNB. Usd/Cad also had NAFTA negotiations (not much progress, but positive talk), plus softish Canadian CPI and mixed retail sales data to digest, but is ending the week just above 1.2300 bids vs a 1.2275 base, with offers in place between 1.2350-1.2400. Nzd/Usd hit 0.7438 at best, but reversed more than a big figure amidst the Greenback rebound and with the Kiwi undermined independently by a significantly softer than forecast Q4 NZ inflation report. Looking ahead, some big risk events looming next week, including the first Fed policy meeting and NFP release of 2018, plus month end that may offer the Dollar a bit more respite given portfolios indicating Usd demand.</p>\r\n",

Gilts remain nearer their Liffe base (122.83, -2 ticks vs +27 ticks at best), albeit just above parity and still marginally outpacing their German/core EZ counterpart, while US Treasuries remain rooted to the lows. From here expect more of the usual Friday pre-weekend position squaring, especially in the FX markets after such a manic week (from Wednesday in particular), and with one eye on a blockbuster week ahead that includes month end, the January FOMC meeting and NFP to name just a few headline grabbing events.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>US: </strong>We are neutral on duration in this environment given the bifurcation between momentum and fundamental valuation. Tactically, there is a risk for the curve to steepen given a divergence between short tail and long tail skew. However, we still expect the curve to flatten in 2018 as the market continues to price in the Fed for 2018/2019. In vol, we remain long gamma which continues to trade at attractive levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>European Core:</strong> We now estimate that the term premium effect from a complete cessation of net purchases is already priced. That&rsquo;s a big statement for global bond markets. That means a combination of inflation and ECB rate hike expectations will be needed to get higher yields. We can anticipate the ECB forward guidance evolving and more pricing towards rate hikes but inflation risk has already been rising and tighter ECB policy should instead compress yields. These push-pull factors explain our year end forecast at just 0.75%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>European Periphery:</strong> Various competing forces are likely to continue to dominate the EGB tone in coming quarters. On the bearish side, we continue to point to the return of (long-end) supply, politics and PSPP downsizing. On the bullish side, we highlight the ongoing euro area recovery, the downplaying of political event risk and the otherwise benign risk backdrop. Overall, we remain bearish for Q1 spreads, but less so than our last publication largely owing to the toning down of anti-euro rhetoric going into the Italian election and of course the ongoing fundamental improvement in the euro area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK: </strong>There is still room for slightly higher yields, in our view, but our forecasts suggest a range-bound environment with 10s averaging 1.40-1.45%. Our conviction falls as the year progresses and Brexit negotiations near their crunch point. The outcome could inspire volatility for gilts; we&rsquo;re just not sure in which direction. Otherwise, we continue to forecast a flatter 2s10s gilt curve, given the MPC&rsquo;s hiking bias and strong global growth, and gilt outperformance cross-market on diverging growth prospects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Japan: </strong>The market may become volatile related to the appointment of the next BoJ governor. However, the BoJ may not wish to change the market&rsquo;s understanding of its &ldquo;around 0%&rdquo; wording, and is expected to act decisively if the market tries to break out of recent range.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>26<sup>th</sup> January 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>USD strength proves to be short-lived as markets await Trump&rsquo;s Davos address (13:00)</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>UK Q4 GDP prints ahead of analyst estimates.</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Looking ahead, highlights include US GDP &amp; Durable Goods, Canadian CPI as well as a slew of speakers.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asia equities traded mixed after a similar performance of stock markets on Wall St and amid quiet conditions with both Australia and India shut today for national holidays. Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) was negative as the index gradually pared the initial support seen from a recovery in USD/JPY which reclaimed the 109.00 handle on Trump comments. Chinese markets were higher in which the Hang Seng (+1.3%) advanced to fresh record levels amid strength in Tencent and China&rsquo;s largest banks, while the Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) was choppy after the PBoC refrained from open market operations which resulted to a net weekly drain of CNY 320bln. Furthermore, participants also digested Industrial Profits which grew a slower pace, but continued to show double-digit growth for December, while FY Industrial Profits grew at its fastest pace since 2011. Finally, 10yr JGBs were slightly higher as prices retained marginal opening gains and with the BoJ also present in the market for JPY 820bln in JGBs under its Rinban operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 320bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 590bln net injection. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3436 (Prev. 6.3724)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Industrial Profits (Dec) Y/Y 10.8% (Prev. 14.9%), 2017 Industrial Profits grew by fastest in 6 years of 21.0% Y/Y. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Minutes from December 20th-21st meeting stated Japan&#39;s economy was expanding moderately and exports had been on increasing trend. The minutes also stated that most members saw price momentum was maintained and viewed that it was appropriate to continue powerful monetary easing. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese National CPI (Dec) Y/Y 1.0% vs. Exp. 1.1% (Prev. 0.6%). (Newswires)<br />- National CPI Ex.

Fresh Food (Jan) Y/Y 0.7% vs. Exp. 0.8% (Prev. 0.8%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoC Governor Poloz says that slack remains in the labour market and that money will remain easy for quite some time. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Coeure states that the ECB will have to reassess if FX levels continue to shift. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Villeroy says we have to monitor the effects of exchange rates on inflation outlook. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bank of England Governor Carney says UK is bit of an outlier and that they see a bit of a pick-up in growth, also notes that Brexit is having an impact on UK growth in the short term. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Conservative MPs were reported to be considering a coup against PM May amid an increase in frustration. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU is reportedly open to Brexit transition lasting past 2020 (official deadline), according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Downing Street source rebuked UK Chancellor Hammond for suggesting that there will only be &#39;very modest&#39; changes after Brexit. &#39;We are leaving the Single Market and Customs Union [this] could not be described as very modest changes.&#39; (Telegraph/Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK GDP Prelim YY (Q4) 1.5% vs. Exp. 1.4% (Prev. 1.7%)<br />- GDP Prelim QQ (Q4) 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.4%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade higher across the board (Eurostoxx 50 +0.4%) with outperformance in the CAC (+0.8%) as LVMH tops the index (+4.7%) following their earnings, subsequently dragging the likes of Kering (+3%) and Christian Dior (+4.5%) higher in sympathy. Elsewhere, aside from the luxury space, sector specific performance is relatively broad-based with other individual movers including Thales (+3%) following a positive broker upgrade at Exane and Givaudan (-2%) following disappointing earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More fast and furious action in the currency markets as US President Trump countered &lsquo;weak Dollar good for trade&rsquo; claims made by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin with a desire to see a strong USD and prediction that it will get stronger and stronger. His rallying call sparked a sharp short squeeze across the board, but the Greenback is already under pressure again, albeit off worst levels vs its peers. Indeed, all G10 rivals have regained the upper hand and the DXY is back below the 89.000 handle, with key Index support levels still close enough to warrant attention (88.423 and 88.282). The AUD is outperforming just below 0.8100, while Sterling the CHF, NZD and EUR are not far behind around 1.4230, 0.9350, 0.7370 and 1.2460 respectively. USD/CAD is pivoting 1.2300 again amidst dovish sounding BoC Poloz&rsquo; rhetoric and some less bullish (for the Loonie) NAFTA noises ahead of Canadian CPI data. USD/JPY has retreated to sub-109.00 levels from around 109.75 on the Trump bounce, with solid support/bids remaining at 108.50, but options eyeing further downside by end Q1 (via 105.00 expiries in March). In short, the US President&rsquo;s intervention appears to have stemmed the tide of broad Greenback selling that was veering towards an avalanche in Davos, but the overall bear trend remains intact. Finally, GBP/USD edged closer to 1.4300 after UK GDP exceeded expectations (Q/Q 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.4%, Y/Y 1.5% vs. Exp. 1.4%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As is often the case these days, Gilts were already easing (and Sterling firming) ahead of the Q4 GDP release, but marginally better than expected growth metrics nudged the 10 year UK bond down a few more ticks to a fresh 122.87 Liffe low (+2 ticks vs +27 ticks on the day at the 123.12 peak). However, this was short-lived and EU debt remains underpinned on a mixture of short covering/consolidation after Thursday&rsquo;s sharp and abrupt sell-off, pre-weekend position squaring and perhaps a bit of front-running for month end amidst various asset portfolio measures indicating a hefty re-weighting to balance indices into fixed and out of equities (figures touted in the region of $150 bn). Indeed, Bunds are edging back towards their 160.36 Eurex high (+31 ticks) and USTs are nestling mid-range within overnight extremes ahead of Friday&rsquo;s busy data schedule stateside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures have traded relatively sideways during European trade as energy newsflow remains light and prices pare some of yesterday&rsquo;s USD-inspired losses; next up for energy traders is the Baker Hughes rig count. In metals markets, gold is also off worst levels and has retraced nearly half of yesterday&rsquo;s move post-Trump, elsewhere, copper has seen relatively range-bound trade with markets likely to be swayed by fluctuations in the USD.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>European equities trade higher across the board (Eurostoxx 50 +0.4%) with outperformance in the CAC (+0.8%) as LVMH tops the index (+4.7%) following their earnings, subsequently dragging the likes of Kering (+3%) and Christian Dior (+4.5%) higher in sympathy. Elsewhere, aside from the luxury space, sector specific performance is relatively broad-based with other individual movers including Thales (+3%) following a positive broker upgrade at Exane and Givaudan (-2%) following disappointing earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More fast and furious action in the currency markets as US President Trump countered &lsquo;weak Dollar good for trade&rsquo; claims made by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin with a desire to see a strong USD and prediction that it will get stronger and stronger. His rallying call sparked a sharp short squeeze across the board, but the Greenback is already under pressure again, albeit off worst levels vs its peers. Indeed, all G10 rivals have regained the upper hand and the DXY is back below the 89.000 handle, with key Index support levels still close enough to warrant attention (88.423 and 88.282). The AUD is outperforming just below 0.8100, while Sterling the CHF, NZD and EUR are not far behind around 1.4230, 0.9350, 0.7370 and 1.2460 respectively. USD/CAD is pivoting 1.2300 again amidst dovish sounding BoC Poloz&rsquo; rhetoric and some less bullish (for the Loonie) NAFTA noises ahead of Canadian CPI data. USD/JPY has retreated to sub-109.00 levels from around 109.75 on the Trump bounce, with solid support/bids remaining at 108.50, but options eyeing further downside by end Q1 (via 105.00 expiries in March). In short, the US President&rsquo;s intervention appears to have stemmed the tide of broad Greenback selling that was veering towards an avalanche in Davos, but the overall bear trend remains intact. Finally, GBP/USD edged closer to 1.4300 after UK GDP exceeded expectations (Q/Q 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.4%, Y/Y 1.5% vs. Exp. 1.4%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As is often the case these days, Gilts were already easing (and Sterling firming) ahead of the Q4 GDP release, but marginally better than expected growth metrics nudged the 10 year UK bond down a few more ticks to a fresh 122.87 Liffe low (+2 ticks vs +27 ticks on the day at the 123.12 peak). However, this was short-lived and EU debt remains underpinned on a mixture of short covering/consolidation after Thursday&rsquo;s sharp and abrupt sell-off, pre-weekend position squaring and perhaps a bit of front-running for month end amidst various asset portfolio measures indicating a hefty re-weighting to balance indices into fixed and out of equities (figures touted in the region of $150 bn). Indeed, Bunds are edging back towards their 160.36 Eurex high (+31 ticks) and USTs are nestling mid-range within overnight extremes ahead of Friday&rsquo;s busy data schedule stateside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures have traded relatively sideways during European trade as energy newsflow remains light and prices pare some of yesterday&rsquo;s USD-inspired losses; next up for energy traders is the Baker Hughes rig count. In metals markets, gold is also off worst levels and has retraced nearly half of yesterday&rsquo;s move post-Trump, elsewhere, copper has seen relatively range-bound trade with markets likely to be swayed by fluctuations in the USD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equities trade with cautious gains after a mixed performance of stock markets on Wall St and amid quiet conditions with both Australia and India shut today for national holidays. Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) is in mild positive territory as the index finds marginal support from a recovery in USD/JPY, which reclaimed the 109.00 handle on Trump comments. Chinese markets are mixed with Hang Seng (+0.8%) outperforming amid strength in Tencent and China&rsquo;s largest banks, while the Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) is indecisive after the PBoC refrained from open market operations which resulted to a net weekly drain of CNY 320bln, while participants also digest Industrial Profits which continued to show double-digit growth, albeit at a slower pace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, major FX currencies are nursing the prior day&rsquo;s losses against the greenback, which were due to comments from President Trump who stated that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin&#39;s comments were taken out of context and that the US administration ultimately wants to see a stronger USD. This provided relief from the greenback&rsquo;s recent woes and briefly dragged EUR/USD and GBP/USD back below the 1.2400 and 1.4100 handles respectively, although both have since recovered off their lows. Elsewhere, the remainder of FX trade has been relatively quiet overnight with USD/JPY holding above 109.00 as&nbsp;mixed CPI data and an uneventful BoJ minutes release fail&nbsp;to spur price action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are slightly higher as prices retain marginal opening gains and with the BoJ in the market for JPY 820bln in JGBs under its Rinban operation.</p>\r\n",
