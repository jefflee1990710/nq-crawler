        "content": "<p><strong>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/20042/download\">here</a>;&nbsp;If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal. To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SNAP-SHOT: Equities down, Treasuries down, crude mixed, dollar up.<br />REAR-VIEW: Trump threatens to escalate trade conflict with China; US NFP beats.<br />NEXT WEEK: Swedish election; BOE, ECB, CBRT, CBR; German ZEW; UK jobs, US retail sales and CPI.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump on Friday told reporters that he is &ldquo;ready to go&rdquo; on $276bln of tariffs on China, &ldquo;if he wants.&rdquo; The tariffs would be in addition to the $200bln of tariffs on China, whose comment period expired on Thursday. Both the US and China have already imposed $50bln of tariffs on each other; China has maintained that it would be forced to retaliate if any other tariffs were imposed. Analysts said Trump&rsquo;s comments were escalating trade conflict; however, JPMorgan urged caution since the President&rsquo;s comments were not an official policy announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>The commentary from policymakers continues to be positive, with Canada&rsquo;s foreign minister Freeland once again stating that talks were constructive, and progress was being made. However, early on Friday, sources reported that the US and Canada were unlikely to reach a deal by the end of the week. However, when asked, Freeland declined to say whether further NAFTA talks will be needed next week. Later in the session, US President Trump said the US is working on a deal with Canada, &ldquo;we will see if it good.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US NONFARM PAYROLLS (AUG): </strong>The US economy added 201k nonfarm payrolls in August, slightly above expectations for 191k. Average hourly earnings grew by 2.9% YY in August, analysts had expected an unchanged 2.7%. The market digested the data with a bid in the dollar, selling fixed income, and there were also modest negative ticks in the equity complex, with the data seemingly giving a nod to the Fed&rsquo;s normalisation trajectory. Wells Fargo said that while the data was an improvement on July, the overall trend in hiring is slowing, as employers are finding it increasingly difficult to find qualified workers, and as a result, wage pressures are being stoked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Rosengren (non-voter, hawk) said the US economy was performing well, and called for gradual hikes since there was no reason for the Fed to remain accommodative. Rosengren saw the neutral rate between 2.5-3.0%. Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan stated that the FOMC will not need to make a judgement on whether or not rates will become restrictive until the middle of next year. On the yield curve, Kaplan said he was not worried that raising rates a further three times would invert the yield curve, and added that an inverted yield curve could be a worry since it may impede credit growth. Fed&#39;s Mester (voter, Hawk) expects inflation sustainability at 2% by the end of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The commentary from Europe has continued to be positive on Friday, with the bloc&rsquo;s chief Brexit negotiator Barnier stating that he was open to discussing other backstops, and was ready to simplify checks on the Irish border, according to a transcript cited by newswires. Barnier also said he wanted o de-dramatize the Brexit backstop, and he was determined to work for an orderly withdrawal of the UK, along with an ambitious future relationship. Separately, Barnier was said to have told Austrian Chancellor Kurz that 90% of the Brexit treaty is now completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.2% AT 2872, DJIA -0.3% AT 25921, NDX -0.3 AT 7431; SECTORS: ENERGY -0.1%, MATERIALS -0.5%, INDUSTRIALS -0.3%, CONSUMER DISC 0.0%, CONSUMER STAP -0.2%, HEALTHCARE +0.2%, FINANCIALS -0.1%, IT -0.3%, TELECOMS -0.4%, UTILITIES -1.2%. </strong>Stocks were hit in afternoon trade as US President Trump hinted that he could impose another round of tariffs on China, which saw the ES drop from around 2880 to 2867.50 and it moved sideways for the rest of the session. Traders have been on alert to the possibility of the US announcing $200bln of tariffs on China imports after the public consultation period expired on Thursday; Trump has suggested that a further round could be on the cards. In stock specifics, the defensive sectors (utilities and telecoms) were hit as Treasury yields rose after solid NFP data. Broadcom (AVGO) was higher by almost 7% after reporting decent earnings on Thursday AMC. Tesla (TSLA) was the worst performer on the NDX after further senior management quit the company, and as investors were concerned about the behaviour of founder Elon Musk after he was interviewed while smoking marijuana and drinking whisky on a internet talk show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 17 TICKS LOWER AT 119-20+. </strong>The T-Note future was sold after a solid NFP print, where AHE rose more than expected, which pushed the future down from 120-04 down to 119-20; newswires reported that there was large put buying interest into the data in the TYZ8 contract. After the data, there was some stabilisation, with the Z8 contract trading between 119-20 to 119-23, though there was a bid after Trump threatened China with further tariffs, but even then, the move was faded as we approached the close. Despite yields higher across the curve, there was some narrowing between major curve spreads (5s30s -3bps, 2s30s -2bps, 2s10s -0.2bps).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES 2 CENTS LOWER AT $$67.75/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLES 33 CENTS HIGHER AT $76.83/BBL. </strong>Crude was mixed on Friday. Some desks noted that the better than expected nonfarm payrolls release out of the US contributed to USD strength as the data makes it more likely the Fed will continue on its hiking trajectory, and that USD strength prompted energy traders to sell commodities and bank gains. The wider narrative remains unchanged, and the market is expecting a tightening in supplies in the latter part of the year as Iranian supply is lost after US sanctions. IEA director Birol stated that he was expecting robust oil production growth, though supply was expected to tighten. Birol said that the Saudis had more scope to lift production, and warned that he saw more US oil pipeline capacity next year. The IEA director also said that producers should pump more oil to prevent prices from rising further, a scenario Birol said would not be good for the global economy. This week, Baker Hughes Rig Count (7 Sep) reported oil rigs -2 at 860, gas rigs +2 at 186, and the total rig count unchanged at 1048.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Back on the 95.000 handle vs fresh lows for the week in the run up to NFP, and surely on course to end the trend of losing ground post-NFP almost whatever the outcome. The latest jobs data beat in headline terms, albeit offset by back month downgrades and an uptick in the unemployment rate, but stronger than forecast average earnings have helped to lift Fed tightening expectations beyond the effectively priced in +25 bp for this month&rsquo;s FOMC. The index is around 95.250 and not that far from best levels seen since Monday (circa 95.737) amidst broad Dollar gains vs G10 counterparts, while taking some steam out of the latest recovery in EM currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Friday&rsquo;s major outperformer and counter-trend mover on more positive sounding Brexit reports after seemingly false hopes of a mellower stance from Germany on conditions and requirements for the future UK-EU relationship. According to a UK parliament document, chief EU negotiator Barnier did not dismiss the Chequers White Paper out of hand, and perhaps more importantly is willing to simply some border checks and consider alternative Irish back-stop proposals. Cable currently mid-range between 1.2915-1.3030 parameters and not far from where it started the week, but well off worst levels just below 1.2800, with a similar pattern seen in Eur/Gbp that is just above 0.8900 from 0.9050 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>At the opposite end of the G10 spectrum and undermined by ongoing global trade tensions, that may now spread to Japan if US President Trump backs up words with actions (or at least uses import tariffs as a bargaining tool as he has elsewhere), plus still on-hold albeit less dovish RBA policy guidance and tighter mortgage lending rates. Aud/Usd down to fresh 2018 and multi-year lows circa 0.7125 having filled reported export bids and leverage account buying interest at 0.7150 vs 0.7235 at best. Note, Aud/NZD is pivoting 1.0900 as the Kiwi holds off its new ytd+ base at 0.6530, but also registers a heavy loss on the week having been over 0.6600 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Another wild ride for the Loonie between 1.3225 and 1.3035 extremes on fluctuating NAFTA reports (but mostly positive), data (mixed to mainly disappointing) and a less cautious, but still data dependent BoC reiterating gradual rate hikes ahead. Usd/Cad ending the week around 1.3130 after weakening to 1.3180 on an all-round dire Canadian jobs report (headline hugely weaker than anticipated and wages slowing quite sharply).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Also set to end the week relatively close to &lsquo;opening&rsquo; levels after hitting a new peak just over 1.1650 and briefly clearing 2 HMAs above 1.1600 and overcoming several German data misses with the aid of more budget compliant messages from the Italian Government. Presently back below the big figure, but &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; off 1.1525 or thereabouts lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>A choppy week for the traditional safe-havens as well, with Usd/Jpy returning to the 111.00 mark vs a high of 111.75 and low of just over 110.00, and the Jpy seeing net cash inflows due to repatriation for the unfortunate earthquakes, while the Franc derived some support from firm Swiss GDP data to trade above 0.9650 at one stage vs 0.9765 at worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK: </strong>Short-covering ahead of Sunday&rsquo;s Swedish election (full preview available via Research Suite) and Riksbank liquidity provisions saw the Krona reverse all and a bit more of its post-Central Bank policy meeting losses (Eur/Sek sub-10.5000 vs just over 10.6000 at one stage on Thursday). To recap, rate hike projections were pushed out to December or February 2019 vs Q4 this year previously, and with October now likely to hone guidance on the precise timing given that Governor Ingves highlighted the importance of communicating a clear message, while stating the case for 25 bp moves as anything smaller is not really meaningful in the monetary policy sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>The Lira, Rand and Rouble took turns to lead a broader recovery across the region, but the catalyst appeared to be the first firm indication of higher official rates from the CBRT. Indeed, the Bank pre-announced that its policy stance will change next Thursday and Usd/Try has retreated below 6.5000 awaiting action with the consensus for a 325 bp move, and up to +500 bp via more hawkish/loud calls. The Zar benefited from less political angst rather than intervention, but the Rub rebounded from its lows as the CBR also leaned towards tightening next week (Friday) on the basis that inflation could exceed the 4% target by year end. Rand and Rouble now off recovery highs vs the Usd that bounced post-NFP, as noted above circa 15.1300 and 69.4400 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP NEXT WEEK: </strong>Sunday: Swedish election.

Some desks noted that the better than expected nonfarm payrolls release out of the US contributed to USD strength as the data makes it more likely the Fed will continue on its hiking trajectory, and that USD strength prompted energy traders to sell commodities and bank gains. The wider narrative remains unchanged, and the market is expecting a tightening in supplies in the latter part of the year as Iranian supply is lost after US sanctions. IEA director Birol stated that he was expecting robust oil production growth, though supply was expected to tighten. Birol said that the Saudis had more scope to lift production, and warned that he saw more US oil pipeline capacity next year. The IEA director also said that producers should pump more oil to prevent prices from rising further, a scenario Birol said would not be good for the global economy.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back on the 95.000 handle vs fresh lows for the week in the run up to NFP, and surely on course to end the trend of losing ground post-NFP almost whatever the outcome. The latest jobs data beat in headline terms, albeit offset by back month downgrades and an uptick in the unemployment rate, but stronger than forecast average earnings have helped to lift Fed tightening expectations beyond the effectively priced in +25 bp for this month&rsquo;s FOMC. The index is around 95.250 and not that far from best levels seen since Monday (circa 95.737) amidst broad Dollar gains vs G10 counterparts, while taking some steam out of the latest recovery in EM currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friday&rsquo;s major outperformer and counter-trend mover on more positive sounding Brexit reports after seemingly false hopes of a mellower stance from Germany on conditions and requirements for the future UK-EU relationship. According to a UK parliament document, chief EU negotiator Barnier did not dismiss the Chequers White Paper out of hand, and perhaps more importantly is willing to simply some border checks and consider alternative Irish back-stop proposals. Cable currently mid-range between 1.2915-1.3030 parameters and not far from where it started the week, but well off worst levels just below 1.2800, with a similar pattern seen in Eur/Gbp that is just above 0.8900 from 0.9050 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the opposite end of the G10 spectrum and undermined by ongoing global trade tensions, that may now spread to Japan if US President Trump backs up words with actions (or at least uses import tariffs as a bargaining tool as he has elsewhere), plus still on-hold albeit less dovish RBA policy guidance and tighter mortgage lending rates. Aud/Usd down to fresh 2018 and multi-year lows circa 0.7125 having filled reported export bids and leverage account buying interest at 0.7150 vs 0.7235 at best. Note, Aud/NZD is pivoting 1.0900 as the Kiwi holds off its new ytd+ base at 0.6530, but also registers a heavy loss on the week having been over 0.6600 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another wild ride for the Loonie between 1.3225 and 1.3035 extremes on fluctuating NAFTA reports (but mostly positive), data (mixed to mainly disappointing) and a less cautious, but still data dependent BoC reiterating gradual rate hikes ahead. Usd/Cad ending the week around 1.3130 after weakening to 1.3180 on an all-round dire Canadian jobs report (headline hugely weaker than anticipated and wages slowing quite sharply).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also set to end the week relatively close to &lsquo;opening&rsquo; levels after hitting a new peak just over 1.1650 and briefly clearing 2 HMAs above 1.1600 and overcoming several German data misses with the aid of more budget compliant messages from the Italian Government. Presently back below the big figure, but &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; off 1.1525 or thereabouts lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A choppy week for the traditional safe-havens as well, with Usd/Jpy returning to the 111.00 mark vs a high of 111.75 and low of just over 110.00, and the Jpy seeing net cash inflows due to repatriation for the unfortunate earthquakes, while the Franc derived some support from firm Swiss GDP data to trade above 0.9650 at one stage vs 0.9765 at worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short-covering ahead of Sunday&rsquo;s Swedish election (full preview available via Research Suite) and Riksbank liquidity provisions saw the Krona reverse all and a bit more of its post-Central Bank policy meeting losses (Eur/Sek sub-10.5000 vs just over 10.6000 at one stage on Thursday). To recap, rate hike projections were pushed out to December or February 2019 vs Q4 this year previously, and with October now likely to hone guidance on the precise timing given that Governor Ingves highlighted the importance of communicating a clear message, while stating the case for 25 bp moves as anything smaller is not really meaningful in the monetary policy sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira, Rand and Rouble took turns to lead a broader recovery across the region, but the catalyst appeared to be the first firm indication of higher official rates from the CBRT. Indeed, the Bank pre-announced that its policy stance will change next Thursday and Usd/Try has retreated below 6.5000 awaiting action with the consensus for a 325 bp move, and up to +500 bp via more hawkish/loud calls. The Zar benefited from less political angst rather than intervention, but the Rub rebounded from its lows as the CBR also leaned towards tightening next week (Friday) on the basis that inflation could exceed the 4% target by year end. Rand and Rouble now off recovery highs vs the Usd that bounced post-NFP, as noted above circa 15.1300 and 69.4400 respectively.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) were lower with nearly all sectors in Australia in the red and energy among the worst hit following the recent pullback in crude, while Tokyo stocks underperformed on a firmer currency and after US President Trump hinted that Japan could be next on the agenda. Conversely, Hang Seng (Unch) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) initially outperformed despite the potential escalation in the trade dispute with the consultation period for the proposed tariffs on USD 200bln of Chinese imports now expired. Furthermore, China had declared it would retaliate against fresh tariffs and plans to take necessary countermeasures to support its companies, while the PBoC were also active today and injected CNY 176.5bln through its 1yr MLF. Chinese stocks then deteriorated heading into the tariff deadline to conform to the overall risk-averse tone and amid increases in money market rates which saw the Hong Kong overnight CNH HIBOR hit its highest level since late June. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher as they tracked the prior session&rsquo;s gains in T-notes and with support seen amid the risk averse sentiment in the region, while today&rsquo;s enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr-20yr JGBs also saw improved results across all metrics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump reportedly hinted that a trade fight with Japan could be next as he stated that he has good relations with Japan which will end as he tells them how much they have to pay. In other news, US President Trump also stated he believes Canada will end up being part of new NAFTA, while he also commented that the US will get a great deal with China for farmers and stated that the US is in a little bit of a skirmish with China but is doing well.

Having failed yet again to clearly overcome resistance around 0.7200 vs the Usd, reported bids from exporters and short covering or profit taking demand at 0.7150 has been severely tested and briefly breached before a relatively firm bounce, albeit amidst broader Greenback weakness, as the Aud continues to lose ground against its NZD antipodean peer with the cross down under 1.0900 &ndash; Kiwi holding towards the upper end of a 0.6560-95 range vs the Usd and not really reacting to comments from RBNZ Governor Orr last night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - Conversely, the single currency is the major front-runner vs the Dollar and overcame a post-German data wobble in early EU trade to test offers around 1.1650, with some technical impetus derived as the headline pair held just above the 100 HMA (1.1607). Note also, more decent option expiry interest in the mix with 1 bn running off between 1.1635-50 at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Also doing fairly well ahead of US jobs data, with Cable able to keep its head above 1.2900 and some key chart levels like a 50% retracement (1.2914) and the 200 HMA (1.2921), although the latter was temporarily pierced at one stage. Meanwhile, the Pound is not losing out too much on the Eur cross that is hovering around 0.9000 amidst yet more Brexit-related UK political rancour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/JPY - All pretty flat against the Usd, but retaining the bulk of gains made on Wednesday as the Loonie benefited from positive NAFTA talk via the US President and reaffirmation of gradual rate hike guidance by BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins. Usd/Cad currently circa 1.3130 and awaiting Canadian jobs data alongside US NFP. The Franc is also on the firmer side of recent ranges around 0.9650 and its safe-haven counterpart, Jpy trades around a new pivot of 110.50 and bang in the middle of 1 bn option expiries at the 110.00 and 111.00 strikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - So far so good, as regional currencies continue their comeback, led by the Try that has extended its rebound on renewed CBRT tightening expectations, with the Lira now over 6.5000 again vs the Usd. Similarly, the Rouble has been boosted by signals from the Central Bank that a rate hike could well be in the offing next Friday (just a day after the CBRT policy meeting) and Usd/Rub is back below 69.0000 in response, while Usd/Zar has retreated further towards 15.0000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could simply be a case of defensive positioning ahead of NFP, but for Bunds at least there are technical and other factors behind the slow grind and further slippage, like elevated Italian bonds after the latest buy-back and &lsquo;commitment&rsquo; to abide by the EU&rsquo;s fiscal rules. Hence, the 10 year German debt future has now breached the next downside technical support/target for bears at 160.20 and tripped stops to 160.09 (-34 ticks) before finding some underlying bids ahead of the big figure. Gilts and US Treasuries largely following suit, but to a lesser extent with the former down to 122.23 (-26 ticks) at one stage and the latter now marginally below par and the curve steeper after Thursday&rsquo;s bull-flattening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures are marginally higher in early European trade thus far with the former hovering around the USD 68/bbl level. According to Reuters trade flow data, US imports of crude oil from Saudi Arabia in August and September are set to reach the highest 2-month level early of 2017, citing the relatively cheap prices as advantageous for US refiners. News flow remains light for the complex, however, next week will see the release of the EIA short-term energy outlook, OPEC&rsquo;s monthly report and IEA&rsquo;s oil market report.

Hence, the 10 year German debt future has now breached the next downside technical support/target for bears at 160.20 and tripped stops to 160.09 (-34 ticks) before finding some underlying bids ahead of the big figure. Gilts and US Treasuries largely following suit, but to a lesser extent with the former down to 122.23 (-26 ticks) at one stage and the latter now marginally below par and the curve steeper after Thursday&rsquo;s bull-flattening.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The marked G10 underperformer and main victim of &lsquo;pending&rsquo; $200 bn Chinese import tariffs by the US, alongside the threat that President Trump turns his trade offensive towards Japan next. Having failed yet again to clearly overcome resistance around 0.7200 vs the Usd, reported bids from exporters and short covering or profit taking demand at 0.7150 has been severely tested and briefly breached before a relatively firm bounce, albeit amidst broader Greenback weakness, as the Aud continues to lose ground against its NZD antipodean peer with the cross down under 1.0900 &ndash; Kiwi holding towards the upper end of a 0.6560-95 range vs the Usd and not really reacting to comments from RBNZ Governor Orr last night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, the single currency is the major front-runner vs the Dollar and overcame a post-German data wobble in early EU trade to test offers around 1.1650, with some technical impetus derived as the headline pair held just above the 100 HMA (1.1607). Note also, more decent option expiry interest in the mix with 1 bn running off between 1.1635-50 at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also doing fairly well ahead of US jobs data, with Cable able to keep its head above 1.2900 and some key chart levels like a 50% retracement (1.2914) and the 200 HMA (1.2921), although the latter was temporarily pierced at one stage. Meanwhile, the Pound is not losing out too much on the Eur cross that is hovering around 0.9000 amidst yet more Brexit-related UK political rancour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/JPY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All pretty flat against the Usd, but retaining the bulk of gains made on Wednesday as the Loonie benefited from positive NAFTA talk via the US President and reaffirmation of gradual rate hike guidance by BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins. Usd/Cad currently circa 1.3130 and awaiting Canadian jobs data alongside US NFP. The Franc is also on the firmer side of recent ranges around 0.9650 and its safe-haven counterpart, Jpy trades around a new pivot of 110.50 and bang in the middle of 1 bn option expiries at the 110.00 and 111.00 strikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far so good, as regional currencies continue their comeback, led by the Try that has extended its rebound on renewed CBRT tightening expectations, with the Lira now over 6.5000 again vs the Usd. Similarly, the Rouble has been boosted by signals from the Central Bank that a rate hike could well be in the offing next Friday (just a day after the CBRT policy meeting) and Usd/Rub is back below 69.0000 in response, while Usd/Zar has retreated further towards 15.0000.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed with the region cautious following a lacklustre lead from Wall St where continued weakness in tech and underperformance in energy dragged most US majors lower, while the upcoming NFP jobs data and trade-related concerns added to the tentative tone. ASX 200 (-0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) are lower with nearly all sectors in Australia in the red and energy among the worst hit following the recent pullback in crude, while the Tokyo stocks underperform on a firmer currency and after US President Trump hinted that Japan could be next on the agenda. Conversely, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) are mixed as the mainland outperforms despite the potential escalation in the trade dispute with the consultation period for the proposed tariffs on USD 200bln of Chinese imports set to expire very soon. Furthermore, China has declared it will retaliate against fresh tariffs and plans to take necessary countermeasures to support its companies, while the PBoC were also active today and injected CNY 176.5bln through its 1yr MLF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat and consolidates around the 95.00 level as the greenback trades mixed against its major counterparts ahead of today&rsquo;s key US jobs data, with EUR/USD and GBP/USD static at the 1.1600 and 1.2900 handles respectively. Antipodeans are slightly softer with AUD/USD pulling back from resistance around the 0.7200 level and JPY remains firmer on the safe-haven flows after Trump seemingly set his sights next on Japan. Elsewhere, CAD extended on gains seen from BoC Deputy Governor Wilkins comments that the governing council agreed a gradual approach to rate hikes was still appropriate after discussing the current trade environment, as President Trump stated he believes Canada will end up being part of the new NAFTA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher to track the prior session&rsquo;s gains in T-notes and with support seen amid the losses in Japanese stocks, while focus turns to the enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr-20yr JGBs.</p>\r\n",
