Despite the roller-coaster rides seen this week, the DXY range between 89.40 and 90.50 has held. Gold is up, buoyed by a weak dollar and lower yields. CAD is one of the top performers on Friday, following solid CPI data (which offset mediocre retail data) which saw the average of the three BOC measures (trimmed mean, median, and common) jumped to 2.03% (versus 1.83% in the January data) above the BOC&#39;s 2% midpoint of its 1-3% target range. The data did little to push a repricing for the April BOC meeting, though the July and October meetings are now fully priced. GBP is higher against the USD, helped by hawkish comments from BOE&#39;s Vlieghe (data has moved in a direction that warrants removal of stimulus), though couldn&#39;t carve out gains vs the EUR. EMFX is up against the USD, with the exception of TRY. Other commodity FX (AUD, NZD) trades higher, following Trade War speculation that China may sway towards Australian imports rather than US imports.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count (16 Mar) 995 (Prev. 990).

Threats by US President Trump that he would potentially veto the government funding bill also kept equities on the back foot, though rallied after he signed the bill, that will keep the government open until September, though the rally proved fragile, and selling action returned as traders settled up for the week, pushing shares to session lows. During the choppy trade, the VIX rose to above 25 again, the highest since 2 March. Also, in late trade SPX broke the psychological level 2600 and headed towards the 200d ma, 2590, which it bounced off on the close. Looking to stock-specifics, S&amp;P was being led by Foot Locker (FL) following positive earnings from Nike (NKE) after market on Thursday; Cintas was positive on earnings; and defence names (LMT, NOC, RTN) up following an increased budget for the US military. SPX -2.08% at 2589, NDX -2.61% at 6508, DJI -1.77% at 23535.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tsy curve bulls-steepened, catching a bid amid soft risk-appetite on the back of Trade Wars fears. Yields on 2s lower by around 3bps, as were 5s, while 10s yields were 1bps lower, and 30s were unchanged in thin volume. Some analysts have expressed astonishment that 10-year yields haven&#39;t managed to meaningfully breach the 2.80% level to the downside (while the 3.00% level seems to be solidly reinforced), in spite of soft risk sentiment. One desk noted that it may be a function of shorts sitting on tidy profits this year, giving them a thicker buffer to absorb losses due to rallies. Other desks have suggested that levels near/sub 2.80% have represented good areas to add shorts. US T-Note futures (Jun&#39;18) settle 3 ticks higher at 120-19+.</p>\r\n",
