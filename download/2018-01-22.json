Celgene also announced that it was to buy 90% of Juno Therapeutics in a $9bln deal &ndash; both deals helping to boost the biotech index. In other deal news, AIG announced the acquisition of Validus Holdings for $5.6bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The energy sector was leading gains once again after some broker upgrades in the sector (Schlumberger, Occidental Petroleum), and after solid earnings from Haliburton. Materials and industrials were lagging after BAML downgraded General Electric, which saw its shares slip below $16 for the first time since 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After market, the market is awaiting numbers from Netflix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREASURIES: US 10-Year T-Note future settle 6 ticks lower at 122-03</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields in the UST complex were higher by between c.1bps to c2.5bps by settlement, though maor curves saw small narrowing in the session, (2s10s by 0.2bps, 2s30s by 1.2bps, 5s30s by c. 2bps), though the 2s5s curve saw modest steepening (+0.7bps). Attention was once again on the 10-year yield, which rose above 2.67% at one point in the session, the highest level since 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, the Treasury will auction $103bln of notes this week ($26bln in 2s on Tuesday, $34bln of 5s on Wednesday, as well as $15bln in 2-year FRNs, and $28bln of 7s on Thursday).

However, the USD ran into weakness, with traders keeping a wary eye on events in Washington. However, as optimism emerged, the USD pared losses, before a bout of EUR strength resumed in quiet afternoon trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECB concludes its policy meeting on Thursday and is expected to stand pat on policy, though traders will be keeping an ear out for comments regarding the recent EUR strength, as well as any tweaks to the central bank&rsquo;s guidance in exiting from its policy largesse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of the BOJ meeting overnight, the yen has been traversing sideways; the central bank is not expected to alter policy at this stage, but there is focus on the post-meeting press conference with Governor Kuroda, to see whether he follows-through on his recent hawkish rhetoric, and whether the recent yen strength is a concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable continues to strengthen, rising on Monday by nearly 1% and eyeing the psychological 1.40 mark; the pound is now knocking around the firmest levels since the Brexit vote. Today&rsquo;s bout of strength was inspired by French Prime Minister Macron&rsquo;s comments to the BBC, where he seemed to suggest that a bespoke deal for the UK was a possibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM FX was mixed, with the ZAR strengthening against the greenback on the prospects of a President Zuma exit, while MXN weakened against the dollar ahead of key NAFTA negotiations that begin this week, with the currency looking through firm labour market data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI futures settle 25 cents higher at $62.32 per barrel; Brent futures settle 42 cents higher at $69.03 per barrel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traders were digesting news from the weekend, where the Saudi energy minister suggested that OPEC/non-OPEC cooperation could continue passed the end of the current output cut deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, analysts expect US stockpiles to draw for the 10<sup>th</sup> week, with headline crude stocks seen drawing by 1.3mln barrels, distillates by 1.6mln barrels, while gasoline is likely to build by 2.4mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi November Oil output at 9.891mln bpd from 10.056mln bpd in October, according to JODI.

        "content": "<p><strong>GOVT SHUTDOWN: US House to vote on funding bill at 1630 ET/2130 GMT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senators struck a deal to keep the government open through to 8 February, after the Trump administration pacified Democrat opposition by promising that a bill on immigration would be allowed to reach the Senate floor. The House will vote at 1630 ET/2130 GMT, and is expected to rubber stamp the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX + 0.81% at 2832, DJI +0.55% at 26214, NDX +1.05 at 6906</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top sectors: Telecom +2.35%, Energy +2.10%, Consumer Discretionary +1.09%</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bottom sectors: Materials -0.21%, Industrials -0.03%, Utilities +0.01%</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major equity bourses largely ignored the shenanigans in Washington, and began climbing before it emerged that Senators had agreed a deal to reopen the government &ndash; most analysts were predicting little economic fallout from the government shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In M&amp;A news, France&rsquo;s Sanofi agreed to acquire Bioverativ in a $11.6bln deal, sending the latter&rsquo;s shares surging by over 60%. Celgene also announced that it was to buy 90% of Juno Therapeutics in a $9bln deal &ndash; both deals helping to boost the biotech index. In other deal news, AIG announced the acquisition of Validus Holdings for $5.6bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The energy sector was leading gains once again after some broker upgrades in the sector (Schlumberger, Occidental Petroleum), and after solid earnings from Haliburton. Materials and industrials were lagging after BAML downgraded General Electric, which saw its shares slip below $16 for the first time since 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After market, the market is awaiting numbers from Netflix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US 10-Year T-Note future settle 6 ticks lower at 122-03</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields in the UST complex were higher by between c.1bps to c2.5bps by settlement, though maor curves saw small narrowing in the session, (2s10s by 0.2bps, 2s30s by 1.2bps, 5s30s by c. 2bps), though the 2s5s curve saw modest steepening (+0.7bps). Attention was once again on the 10-year yield, which rose above 2.67% at one point in the session, the highest level since 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, the Treasury will auction $103bln of notes this week ($26bln in 2s on Tuesday, $34bln of 5s on Wednesday, as well as $15bln in 2-year FRNs, and $28bln of 7s on Thursday). With $104bln set to mature at month-end, net Treasury supply is seen at -$1.5bln by month end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY down 0.2% heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After gapping higher at the Sunday open, EUR pared back gains made in wake of the German SPD party&rsquo;s vote to begin negotiations with the CDU/CSU to form a government; the gap was filled by the time Europeans got to their trading desks. However, the USD ran into weakness, with traders keeping a wary eye on events in Washington. However, as optimism emerged, the USD pared losses, before a bout of EUR strength resumed in quiet afternoon trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECB concludes its policy meeting on Thursday and is expected to stand pat on policy, though traders will be keeping an ear out for comments regarding the recent EUR strength, as well as any tweaks to the central bank&rsquo;s guidance in exiting from its policy largesse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of the BOJ meeting overnight, the yen has been traversing sideways; the central bank is not expected to alter policy at this stage, but there is focus on the post-meeting press conference with Governor Kuroda, to see whether he follows-through on his recent hawkish rhetoric, and whether the recent yen strength is a concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable continues to strengthen, rising on Monday by nearly 1% and eyeing the psychological 1.40 mark; the pound is now knocking around the firmest levels since the Brexit vote. Today&rsquo;s bout of strength was inspired by French Prime Minister Macron&rsquo;s comments to the BBC, where he seemed to suggest that a bespoke deal for the UK was a possibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM FX was mixed, with the ZAR strengthening against the greenback on the prospects of a President Zuma exit, while MXN weakened against the dollar ahead of key NAFTA negotiations that begin this week, with the currency looking through firm labour market data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 25 cents higher at $62.32 per barrel; Brent futures settle 42 cents higher at $69.03 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traders were digesting news from the weekend, where the Saudi energy minister suggested that OPEC/non-OPEC cooperation could continue passed the end of the current output cut deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, analysts expect US stockpiles to draw for the 10<sup>th</sup> week, with headline crude stocks seen drawing by 1.3mln barrels, distillates by 1.6mln barrels, while gasoline is likely to build by 2.4mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Preview, Due On Tuesday 23rd January",
        "content": "<p>The Bank of Japan&rsquo;s (BoJ) 2-day policy meeting will conclude on Tuesday, and the central bank is expected to continue the inaction seen throughout the entirety of 2017 by maintaining its QQE with Yield Curve Control policy, and leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged at -0.10%. The upcoming meeting will also include the release of the latest Outlook Report, containing the board members&#39; median forecasts for real GDP and core CPI. The current BoJ Board Members&#39; median forecasts can be found below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Real GDP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2017 forecast at 1.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2018 forecast at 1.4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2019 forecast at 0.7%</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Core CPI:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2017 forecast at 0.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2018 forecast at 1.4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Fiscal 2019 forecast at 1.8% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much has changed in terms of central bank&nbsp;rhetoric since the previous&nbsp;meeting, as Governor Kuroda has stuck with the profusely repeated statement that the BoJ will maintain its QQE with YCC for as long as is required to reach 2% inflation in a stable manner, while he also suggested that the economy is experiencing steady growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, economic data releases since the previous meeting haven&#39;t been much of a game changer, despite the latest national CPI (0.6% vs. Exp. 0.5%, Prev. 0.2%) and core CPI (0.9% vs. Exp. 0.8%, Prev. 0.8%) releases beating expectations, although inflation remains well shy of the Bank&rsquo;s 2.0% target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As policy tweaks are widely seen to be off the table for quite some time, the near-term focus regarding the BoJ seems to be on whether Governor Kuroda will be reinstated for another 5-year term&nbsp;when his current term expires in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants will also be looking out for any commentary regarding the recent bout of JPY strength with USD/JPY sitting on the 110&nbsp;handle vs. the 113&nbsp;seen at the December meeting. BoJ watchers will also be on the lookout for clues surrounding the BoJ&#39;s bond buying intentions&nbsp;after a recent reduction of 10year - 25 year and 25 year maturities in the Bank&rsquo;s Rinban operations triggered tapering fears and spooked markets earlier this month. Since then, sources close to the BoJ have stated that the market overreacted to the change, noting that the move wasn&rsquo;t meant to signal a broader policy shift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, there is no scheduled time for the decision, which usually comes any time after the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0230GMT/2030CST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What The Bank Desks Are Saying: -</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Barclays:</strong> We expect the BoJ to keep policy intact, while revising up its GDP forecasts and retaining its CPI projections.&nbsp; All-industry index: We estimate that the all-industry index rose again in November, with higher readings for both the tertiary index, which accounts for over 70% of the total, and industrial production, which has a weighting of more than 20%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BAML:</strong> After a quiet 2017, interest in the BoJ is rising once again. On 9 January, the BoJ&#39;s announcement of a &yen;10bn reduction in its &quot;rinban&quot; purchase of JGBs in the 10-25yr and 25-40yr segment caused a strong reaction in the markets and reignited headlines of early BoJ normalization. As we noted last week, we think the markets (in particular FX) over-reacted to the announcement. Our view is that the modest trimming of purchases is not, in and of itself, a signal of a new policy bias. Questions at 23 January&#39;s post-MPM press conference will nonetheless focus on the BoJ&#39;s &quot;stealth tapering&quot; of JGB purchases and the recent market reaction. We expect the governor to reiterate the central banks&#39; stance that the quantity of JGB purchases is an endogenous variable under YCC and could slow or reaccelerate depending on trends in the economy and financial markets. That said, we think the governor will strike an overall dovish tone at the conference to minimize risks that speculation over a pre-mature BoJ exit would trigger unwanted yen appreciation. The risk of rate hikes in 2018 has ranked top in our client conversations this week. We remain confident that this won&#39;t happen in spite of early change to communication. Inflation dynamics will matter for rate moves. FX enters in these considerations. Consequently, we stick to our view that the depo rate will be raised in 2Q19 and 4Q19 (20bp each). Last week&#39;s ECB speak, even among hawks, supports this view. Markets suggested we were (unusually) hawkish until recently. Pricing has now moved our way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Daiwa:</strong> Given the upbeat econmic sentiment reflected in today&rsquo;s Reuters Tankan, and what might well have been another quarter of above-trend growth at the end of 2017, Kuroda will be able to remain pretty bullish about the economic outlook. Nevertheless, with core CPI inflation still less than half the BoJ&rsquo;s 2% target, we (like the consensus) expect the Bank to retain its existing main policy settings, i.e. the -0.1% interest rate on banks&rsquo; marginal excess reserves and the pledge to keep 10Y JGB yields &lsquo;at around zero per cent&rsquo;. However, in light of the slight reduction in the size of the Bank&rsquo;s longer-term JGB purchases at its operations so far this month, unless we suddenly see significant upward pressure on yields (which, given the large share of the market already held by the BoJ, as well as its highly credible and rarely used unlimited fixed-rate purchase facility, might seem unlikely), we think it is clear that the BoJ has no intention to meet the &yen;80trn annual rate of increase in its holdings still specified in its recent policy statements. After all, the moves this month follow a year in which actual purchases amounted to just &yen;58trn. So, while the Bank will likely re-commit to maintaining purchases &lsquo;at more or less the current pace&rsquo;, this might just be the month that it explicitly acknowledges that this will result in net purchases closer to last year&rsquo;s total than &yen;80trn, or, better still, formally de-link achievement of the yield curve control target to a specific level of JGB purchases.&nbsp; While it&rsquo;s not expected, the BoJ might also finally wish to tweak its programme of ETF purchases. We continue to think that there is little sense in the Bank continuing to support an equity market that has risen to levels not seen since the early 1990s. While it seems unlikely that the Policy Board would decide to bring such purchases to an abrupt halt, a reduction in the annual pace &ndash; which was doubled to &yen;6trn in mid-2016 &ndash; would be neither a large surprise nor unwelcome. That said, the BoJ may be reluctant to make too many tweaks to policy settings at a single meeting, especially in light of recent yen strengthening. However, we do expect it to extend by one year its special fund-supply facilities. More prosaically, revisions to the projections issued in the Outlook Report will likely be minor. Given stronger-than-expected GDP growth in Q3, positive signs for Q4 and benign trends abroad, it would not be surprising to see a modest upward revision to the Board&rsquo;s collective sense of growth prospects in FY17 and perhaps FY18 (the median forecasts in October were 1.9%Y/Y and 1.4%Y/Y respectively). Until it has seen the outcome of the spring wage round, it seems unlikely to revise up significantly its forecasts of inflation (the median Board member forecasts of core inflation in October were 0.8%Y/Y, 1.4%Y/Y and 1.8%Y/Y for FY17, FY18 and FY19 respectively, the latter excluding the impact of the scheduled hike in consumption tax). Nevertheless, it will continue to suggest that it expects the 2% target to be met around FY19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HSBC:</strong> Underlying inflation pressures have been absent so far, despite positive q-o-q growth for seven consecutive quarters. Strong economic activity is not translating into higher prices, with wage growth showing limited signs of acceleration due to various structural factors. Consequently, the BoJ is likely to maintain its extremely easy monetary policy in the foreseeable future, as a premature pullback will dampen medium-term inflation expectations and also result in a notable correction in financial market instruments including the value of the yen. Meanwhile, this is likely to push the Bank&rsquo;s real GDP forecast for FY2018 slightly higher from the current 1.4%. Market participants will be closely watch whether the Bank keeps its optimistic core CPI forecast of 1.4% for FY2018, while we see risks that this could be marked marginally lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nomura:</strong>&nbsp;We expect the BOJ to leave monetary policy unchanged at the meeting. The economy has been solid and, although core inflation (inflation based on all items in the CPI index less fresh food) has been rising, it is far from the 2% target, indicating there is little justification for making any changes to monetary policy. In the Outlook for the Economy and Prices (Outlook Report) that will be released at the time of the meeting, we expect GDP growth forecasts for FY17 and FY18 to be raised. Since the Outlook Report was last released in October 2017, growth in the global economy has gathered pace, and we expect this to be reflected in the upcoming release of the report. Annual revisions to GDP data might also affect FY17 forecasts. We think the forecast for core inflation will be left unchanged. Recent increases in crude oil prices are likely to boost inflation, but yen strengthening against the dollar is likely to counter this boost and we do not expect changes to the core inflation forecast resulting from changes to import prices to be carried out this time.&nbsp; At the BOJ governor&#39;s press conference after the meeting, the governor might be asked about the decision to reduce the amount of longer-term bonds it purchases and his view of the market&#39;s reaction, as JPY strengthened after the purchase amount was scaled back on 9 January. We expect Governor Kuroda to reiterate the position that intentions with regard to changes to monetary policy are not reflected in daily market operations and that, regardless of the market&#39;s reaction, tenacious easing efforts will continue.</p>\r\n",

The former slipped to 160.38 (-28 ticks on the day) before finding a base and recouping some lost ground, while the latter almost touched chart support (around 123.26) at 123.29 (-31 ticks), but have also bounced a few ticks subsequently. Core bonds now appear to be consolidating ahead of the US open, while dip buyers and jobbers may also be drawing encouragement and incentive from the fact that key downside technical levels held, like last week&rsquo;s Eurex lows for the 10 year German benchmark that ultimately protect 161.11 and a clean break above 0.60% in the yield. However, fixed still in the grips of sellers amidst paying interest in swaps and curve steepening.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (flat) were subdued as the US shutdown sapped investor sentiment, although downside was limited amid some hopes on resolving the impasse. Chinese markets were choppy in which the Shanghai Comp (Unch.) was flat and Hang Seng (-0.1%) initially stalled after it recently hit record levels, but was later underpinned amid outperformance in Shenzhen stocks. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat despite a cautious tone in stocks, as participants were sidelined amid an enhanced liquidity auction for longer dated JGBs and as the BoJ kick-starts its 2-day policy meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 60bln via 7-day, CNY 40bln via 14-day and CNY 10bln via 63-day reverse repos. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.4112 (Prev. 6.4169)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany&rsquo;s SPD voted in favour (out of 642: 362 vs. 279) of formal coalition discussions with German Chancellor Merkel&rsquo;s conservatives. There were also comments from SPD leader Schulz who said that coalition talks are going to be just as hard as the exploratory talks and that he hopes negotiations will start soon. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senate Majority Leader McConnell said the intention is to resolve immigration as quick as possible and declared the next Senate procedural vote will be held Monday at 1200EST vs. initial expectations of a 0100EST vote, while US Senate Minority Leader Schumer said they have yet to reach an agreement on a path forward. In related news, US Republican Senator Flake noted that a bipartisan meeting is to be held 1000EST to discuss continuing resolution, while US Senator Cornyn had earlier stated he was now more optimistic after leaving a GOP leaders&rsquo; meeting.

In terms of sector specifics, energy names outperform given the moves seen in oil markets, telecoms are also seen higher following positive comments from the Deutsche Telekom CEO (+1.6%). Elsewhere, other notable movers include, UBS (-2.5%) who trade lower in the wake of their earnings with markets overlooking their buyback and restructuring efforts. Further to this, Ocado (+12.7%) tops the Stoxx 600 after striking an international deal with Sobeys of Canada, William Hill (-12.9%) lags the Stoxx 600 after stake reductions on UK gambling machines. Finally, YOOX Net-a-Porter (+25%) are seen markedly higher after reports that Richemont are to offer EUR 38/shr for the Co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, GBP is firmer across the board as French President Macron suggests that the UK may be able to secure a &lsquo;special&rsquo; Brexit deal, albeit with conditions in terms of retaining access to the single EU market. Cable is eyeing the 1.3900 level again and EUR/GBP is drifting back towards 0.8800 despite some Eur positive news via Germany&rsquo;s SPD voting in favour of starting talks to form a grand coalition with Merkel&rsquo;s CDU-CSU alliance. The latter has underpinned EUR/USD firmly above the 1.2200 level that has formed solid support bar a brief knee-jerk below (1.2165 last week&rsquo;s low) on pull-backs from 1.2325 peaks, and ahead of a key Fib retracement at 1.2143. Thursday&rsquo;s ECB policy meeting will likely be the next main (independent) driver, although for the Dollar all eyes are on tonight&rsquo;s Senate vote on White House funding (12.00EST/17.00GMT). In the run up, the DXY is holding near 90.500 within a 90.700-155 range, with the Greenback softer vs all G10 peers to varying degrees. USD/CHF is back down around 0.9600, while AUD/USD and NZD/USD have both rebounded to test big figure pivots at 0.8000 and 0.7300 respectively. USD/JPY relatively flat between broad 110.50-111.00 parameters ahead of the culmination of January&rsquo;s BoJ policy meeting (Tuesday) with decent buy orders seen at the range base and offers at the top. USD/CAD hovering near the bottom of its 1.2465-1.2515 range as NAFTA talks continue. Note, no large option expiry strikes running off today close to current market levels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ANC in South Africa has moved to eject President Zuma as Ramaphosa steps up his fraud purge.

The core Eurex debt future reached 161.77 (+11 ticks), but then retreated to 160.52, while its Liffe equivalent only advanced to 123.67 (+7 ticks) before reversing to 123.44 (-16 ticks) and bears are now looking at 123.26 chart support. In truth, it&rsquo;s thin, fickle and choppy trade on the way up and down with plenty of risk events unfolding this week, while Bunds are also seeing some underperformance vs the periphery where Spanish bonds are leading peers higher on the back of Fitch&rsquo;s upgrade. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain on the back foot and with futures still clearly below key support levels amidst some decent downside option positioning looking for a further breakdown and up-leg in yields.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI crude futures saw marginal overnight gains after the OPEC/Non-OPEC JMMC meeting on Sunday in which producers reaffirmed they will proceed with oil cuts as planned and signalled willingness for cooperation beyond 2018. Elsewhere, gold has been choppy amid similar price action in the greenback and copper attempted to nurse some of last week&rsquo;s losses, although the recovery was capped by a cautious risk tone and resistance at the USD 3.20/lb level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC and Russia reaffirmed they will continue with oil-production cuts until year-end and indicated a willingness for cooperation beyond the date as Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih commented that there is consensus among producers to continue their cooperation beyond this year, while UAE&rsquo;s Oil Minister Mazrouei said UAE wants a proposal for cooperation after 2018.

Cable is eyeing the 1.3900 level again and Eur/Gbp is drifting back towards 0.8800 despite some Eur positive news via Germany&rsquo;s SPD voting in favour of starting talks to form a grand coalition with Merkel&rsquo;s CDU-CSU alliance. The latter has underpinned Eur/Usd firmly above the 1.2200 level that has formed solid support bar a brief knee-jerk below (1.2165 last week&rsquo;s low) on pull-backs from 1.2325 peaks, and ahead of a key Fib retracement at 1.2143. Thursday&rsquo;s ECB policy meeting will likely be the next main (independent) driver, although for the Dollar all eyes are on tonight&rsquo;s Senate vote on White House funding (12.00EST/17.00GMT). In the run up, the DXY is holding near 90.500 within a 90.700-155 range, with the Greenback softer vs all G10 peers to varying degrees. Usd/Chf is back down around 0.9600, while Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd have both rebounded to test big figure pivots at 0.8000 and 0.7300 respectively. Usd/Jpy relatively flat between broad 110.50-111.00 parameters ahead of the culmination of January&rsquo;s BoJ policy meeting (Tuesday) with decent buy orders seen at the range base and offers at the top. Usd/Cad hovering near the bottom of its 1.2465-1.2515 range as NAFTA talks continue. Note, no large option expiry strikes running off today close to current market levels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Technically, bond charts are also flagging more downside for futures/yield advances, but there has not been the stampede that many observers envisaged or warned about on a breach of supposed key/watershed levels. Indeed, Bunds have been relatively contained thus far between 160.67-54 vs last Friday&rsquo;s 160.66 close and the UST 10 year yield is just off overnight highs around 2.66% awaiting the delayed Senate vote on the stop-gap financing bill. Further news on SPD/CSU-CDU talks also in focus ahead of BoJ and ECB meetings, while some attention will be paid to the latest Buba monthly report on a particularly sparse agenda even for a Monday.

        "content": "<p>Another softer Eurex open for the 10 year German benchmark amidst several ongoing bearish factors for fixed income, including the US Government funding stalemate, progress towards Grand coalition talks in Germany, reports that OPEC and non-OPEC crude producers are willing to continue output caps beyond the end of this year and broadly risk-on sentiment via still frothy if not rallying global stocks. Technically, bond charts are also flagging more downside for futures/yield advances, but there has not been the stampede that many observers envisaged or warned about on a breach of supposed key/watershed levels. Indeed, Bunds have been relatively contained thus far between 160.67-54 vs last Friday&rsquo;s 160.66 close and the UST 10 year yield is just off overnight highs around 2.66% awaiting the delayed Senate vote on the stop-gap financing bill. Further news on SPD/CSU-CDU talks also in focus ahead of BoJ and ECB meetings, while some attention will be paid to the latest Buba monthly report on a particularly sparse agenda even for a Monday. Back to debt markets, Spanish Bonos are bid in wake of the country&rsquo;s ratings upgrade with the 10 year benchmark yield down around 1.41%.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) were subdued as the US shutdown sapped investor sentiment, although downside was limited amid some hopes on resolving the impasse. Elsewhere, Chinese markets were choppy in which the Shanghai Comp (Unch.) was flat and Hang Seng (-0.1%) initially stalled after it recently hit record levels, but was later underpinned amid outperformance in Shenzhen stocks. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat despite a cautious tone in stocks, as participants were sidelined amid an enhanced liquidity auction for longer dated JGBs and as the BoJ kick-starts its 2-day policy meeting.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) are negative as the US shutdown saps investor sentiment, although both are off worst levels amid a slight improvement in optimism on resolving the impasse. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are choppy with the former stalling after recently hitting record levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD opened weaker after the spending bill failed to pass procedural vote on Friday at the Senate and resulted to a government shutdown. This briefly pushed GBP/USD to just shy of the 1.3900 handle and saw EUR/USD gap higher by about 50 pips as the German SPD party also voted to formally begin coalition talks with German Chancellor Merkel&rsquo;s conservatives. However, USD then pared some of the losses on hopes for a deal to end the shutdown, before the procedural vote was postponed to 1200EST from previously anticipated 0100EST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat despite a cautious tone in stocks, as participants are sidelined ahead of an enhanced liquidity auction for longer dated JGBs and as the BoJ kicks starts its 2-day policy meeting.</p>\r\n",
