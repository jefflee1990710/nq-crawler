The Committee repeated its stance that monetary policy remains accommodative, and also upgraded its language on the economy; economic activity is rising at a &lsquo;solid&rsquo; rate, previously said growth was &lsquo;moderate&rsquo;. It dropped its reference from previous statements that it expected rates to be below neutral for &lsquo;some time&rsquo;. Elsewhere, it hiked the IOER by 20bps to 1.95%. In his post-meeting press conference, Fed chair Powell was upbeat about the US economy, suggesting it was in &lsquo;good shape&rsquo;. said he&rsquo;d be concerned if inflation was persistently above or below 2%, though his views haven&rsquo;t changed much since the March meeting. Powell believes that inflation will be pushed above the 2% target after the oil price rise recently, but sees it as transitory. On the inflation target itself, Powell said the FOMC is strongly committed to the 2% price goal, and the barriers to changing that are very high. On trade policy, Powell noted Fed contacts had reported concerns on trade policy, though he is not seeing any evidence of it in the economic data. Powell said there was wide uncertainty around NAIRU and the neutral rate, and the Fed will keep an open mind, and is monitor incoming data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> US President Donald Trump could slap fresh tariffs on China, perhaps as soon as Friday, a move analysts say may sour negotiations between the two nations, as it appeared the situation was improving. The US was said to be preparing a honed list of goods subject to tariffs to be announced on Friday, as the exact amount of Chinese goods subject to tariffs is being finalised. China earlier said it was to further increase imports; previously the nation had said it was willing to boost imports If US meets halfway on trade. Elsewhere, German Economy Minister Altmaier said they have not been successful in EU in stopping spiral of tariffs. He added US competitors will be hurt by US tariffs, noting Europe will have a joint response to the tariffs. He warned EU must make sure there is no abundance of steel in the German and European markets following the tariff decision from the US. Finally he announced the EU is currently discussing quotas on steel imports to prevent flooding of market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US Secretary of State Pompeo said he would like to achieve major Korean disarmament within two and a half years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>A minister reported that EU chief Brexit negotiator Barnier and European Commission President Juncker are to visit Ireland next week. Ireland&#39;s Europe minister Macentee said Ireland welcomes elements of a UK Brexit plan, adding the country is not looking to pause Brexit talks and wants more discussions, and said Ireland is seeking Brexit deal by October. The House of Commons voted 322 to 240 to reject amendment (a) to Lords amendment 51 to the EU Withdrawal Bill which would have made the UK&#39;s full access to the EU internal market a negotiating objective of the Government. The House of Commons voted 327 to 126 to reject amendment (b) 51 which would have called on the Government to make continued participation in the European Economic Area (EEA) a negotiating objective. Finally, the House of Commons voted 325 to 298 to reject Lords amendment 1 to the EU Withdrawal Bill which would have required the Government to seek to negotiate a customs union as part of the framework for a future UK-EU relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA:</strong> US PPI ticked up in May to 2.4% from 2.3%, beating expectations. The monthly figure also beat the consensus of 0.3% coming in at 0.5%. The latest producer prices and yesterday&rsquo;s CPI release both confirm that price pressure is building up in the economy, Capital Economics said. The rebound in PPIs was mostly attributed to higher energy prices and partially by raw material inflation which has pushed higher on the back of tariffs. PPI Ex-Food/Energy/Trade remained unchanged at 0.1%. The latest inflation figures back the Fed view of hiking rates once a quarter, CapEco said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.40%, NDX -0.05 %, DJI -0.47%.&nbsp;</strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +0.27%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.04%, Energy: -0.07%, Financials: -0.42%, Health Care: -0.08%, Industrials: -0.61%, Materials: -0.96%, Telecoms: -4.40%, Tech: +0.18%, Utilities: +0.06%. The S&amp;P 500 Emini was trading sideways overnight and through the European day as we approached the FOMC rate announcement, clinging to levels just above 2790; The initial hawkish interpretation of the Fed&rsquo;s decision, statement, and forecasts so knee-jerk selling across the equity complex, though as Fed chair Powell delivered his press conference, losses were pared back, with the ES finding its way back to the 2790+ area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>Aftermarket Tuesday, AT&amp;T (T) won approval to purchase Time Warner (TWX) for USD 85bln and as a result many M&amp;A names saw hefty moves, IE Fox (FOXA) saw intraday highs of around 7.5%, but potential bidders Comcast (CMCSA) and Disney (DIS) were hit pre-market (more so CMCSA), but the two both gradually pared back the losses, and Disney (DIS) extended gains to almost 4%; however, some were questioning whether DIS will actually be able to acquire Fox assets. Other names in the M&amp;A space also caught a bid following the decision, such as Aetna (AET), CVS (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESRX).&nbsp; Elsewhere, Stryker (SYK) reported in a filing that it is not in deal talks with Boston Scientifics (BSX), reversing some of the moves we saw when the deal was announced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>HR Block (HRB) reported strong numbers, however its revenue forecasts for FY19 were below expectations, and its EBITDA profit margin for the same period were lower than its FY18 figure; the co. also announced it is to shut 400 of its smaller offices, which saw the stock lower by almost 20% on Wednesday.&nbsp; Elsewhere in stock specifics Netflix (NFLX) outperformed the SPX following a price target increase from Goldman Sachs to $490, which is a new street high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (N8) SETTLE UP 28 CENTS AT $66.64/BBL; BRENT (Q8) SETTLES UP 86 CENTS &nbsp;AT $76.74/BBL. </strong>The DOE weekly inventory data showed a larger than expected draw for headline crude stocks &ndash; contrary to what was hinted in the API data on Tuesday &ndash; with inventories falling by 4.143mln (exp. -1.440mln, API reported +800k); Cushing Stocks drew 687k barrels (vs API -730k); gasoline Stocks drew down by a deeper than expected 2.271mln (exp. 0.433mln, API +2.33mln), and distillate inventories fell 2.101mln (exp. +200k, API +2.1mln); US crude production rose by 0.9% in the week to 10.9mln BPD. The IEA monthly report saw global demand estimates unchanged at 1.4mln BPD, though it raised its estimated for non-OPEC supply growth to 2mln BPD, and sounded the alarm on Venezuela and Iran, which the IEA says could shave 1.5mln BPD of crude off the market by the end of the year; it also warned that the supply disruptions could place pressure on the thin levels of spare capacity. The report comes ahead of next week&rsquo;s OPEC+ meeting, where it is expected to ease supply curbs to offset outages from Venezuela and Angola, and anticipated supply disruptions from Iran. The Iranians today called on OPEC+ to maintain the current status quo; the plea came after reports suggested that the Russians were to propose OPEC+ share out the 1.8mln quota between members, leaving the 1mln BPD of voluntary cuts intact (today, government sources in Russia said President Putin does not plan to discuss exit from global oil output deal with Saudi Crown Prince). It was also reported that Russian crude production had climbed to 11.1mln BPD &ndash; in line with sources reports from the first part of the week. Reports on Wednesday stated that the Saudis are to consider a number of options at next week&rsquo;s meeting, with one option being touted a 500k-700k BPD one-off hike. Meanwhile, ahead of next week&rsquo;s meeting &ndash; and amid US consumers facing high pump prices heading into the midterms in November &ndash; US President Donald Trump once again ratcheted-up criticism of OPEC, tweeting that &ldquo;oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) SETTLE 7 TICKS LOWER AT 119-06. </strong>Treasuries were very much rangebound for most of the session heading into the FOMC rate decision, with thin volume seen across the complex. Post-Fed, however, there was knee-jerk selling with the rate decision and guidance perceived as hawkish, and Treasuries sold-off falling from 119-13+ to 119-03; the 10yr yield rose back above 3% hitting a three-week high, and the 2yr yields extended gains above peaks seen in August 2008 given its sensitivity the Fed. &nbsp;The yield curve bear flattened (Fed Chair Powell said the yield curve is flattening because Fed is lifting the federal funds rate), with 2yr and 5yr higher by c.4bps and 30y higher by c.1bps. 5s30s spread narrowed to beneath 25bps for the first time since 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX: </strong>The Dollar Index was in negative territory heading into the FOMC&rsquo;s rate decision, and was boosted after the central bank hiked rates, lifted its trajectory of rate rises, and sounded upbeat on the economy. But with that said, the price action wasn&rsquo;t spectacular, and major FX pairs remain confined to recent range, and as Powell was giving his press conference, news that the US was preparing to place tariffs on China resulted in the dollar paring gains. EURUSD traded between 1.1725-1.1792 ahead of the ECB decision tomorrow; USDJPY action was comatose, but has managed to stay above the 200dma. USDCAD continues to straddle the 1.30 figure; GBP around the 1.3350 level as the rest of the EU Withdrawal Bill amendments comes in as expected, EURGBP made an attempt to move to the top of its recent range around 0.8840 but couldn&rsquo;t quite reach those levels, though remains above 0.88. The Antipodeans saw some downside after the FOMC decision, but the AUD remains above 0.7550, and NZD remains above 0.70. In the EMFX complex, BRL was up against the buck as the BCB continues its aggressive intervention; ZAR weakness was modest as we approach 13.50, as was the MXN, which is flattish around 20.68; TRY, however, has large external dollar cost funding, and accordingly weakened by over 1% vs the buck.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>ECB Monetary Policy Decision due at 12:45 BST/ EDT on Thursday 14th June 2018, press conference due at 13:30 BST/08:30 EDT. Unanimous expectations look for the ECB to leave its three key rates unchanged. Will the ECB unveil their blueprint for winding down their PSPP or will they &lsquo;kick the can down the road&rsquo; to July? Questions likely to be raised on the Bank&rsquo;s view surrounding the latest developments in Italian politics.

The IEA monthly report saw global demand estimates unchanged at 1.4mln BPD, though it raised its estimated for non-OPEC supply growth to 2mln BPD, and sounded the alarm on Venezuela and Iran, which the IEA says could shave 1.5mln BPD of crude off the market by the end of the year; it also warned that the supply disruptions could place pressure on the thin levels of spare capacity. The report comes ahead of next week&rsquo;s OPEC+ meeting, where it is expected to ease supply curbs to offset outages from Venezuela and Angola, and anticipated supply disruptions from Iran. The Iranians today called on OPEC+ to maintain the current status quo; the plea came after reports suggested that the Russians were to propose OPEC+ share out the 1.8mln quota between members, leaving the 1mln BPD of voluntary cuts intact (today, government sources in Russia said President Putin does not plan to discuss exit from global oil output deal with Saudi Crown Prince). It was also reported that Russian crude production had climbed to 11.1mln BPD &ndash; in line with sources reports from the first part of the week. Reports on Wednesday stated that the Saudis are to consider a number of options at next week&rsquo;s meeting, with one option being touted a 500k-700k BPD one-off hike. Meanwhile, ahead of next week&rsquo;s meeting &ndash; and amid US consumers facing high pump prices heading into the midterms in November &ndash; US President Donald Trump once again ratcheted-up criticism of OPEC, tweeting that &ldquo;oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

The outperforming index is currently the FTSE MIB (+0.3%), with the IBEX down 0.6% following disappointing earnings from index heavy-weight Inditex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The approval of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s merger with Time Warner by a US judge, is an event in focus by traders, as this could lead to M&amp;A follow through, with specific focus on Sky and Deutsche Telekom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glencore (+2.3%) has seen the resolution of G&eacute;camines&rsquo; litigation in DR Congo following the writing off of USD 5.6bln in their subsidiary Katanga Mining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dixons Carphone (-3.6%) is the latest co. to be hit by a data breach, with 105k payment cards compromised, and 1.2m records containing non-financial personal data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index is on a firmer footing again, ahead of the Fed and with the Greenback gaining ground vs most major peers apart from the antipodean dollars that are managing to stay on an even keel even though underlying energy/metal prices are weak, and for the AUD more dovish RBA commentary has hardly helped the cause. The DXY is hovering just below 94.000 and looking for anything further to keep the momentum going from the FOMC beyond an already factored in 25 bp hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The G10 laggard, and once again undermined by UK data to a degree as CPI remained unchanged in May (m/m and y/y) vs some expectations for an uptick. Cable is drifting down towards 1.3300 as a result, while also eyeing the 2nd day of Brexit bill debate and voting before attention turns to the Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All extending recent loss vs the Dollar as Usd/Jpy finally soaks up all offers around 110.50 to trade up at 110.70 and technically through another key resistance level (110.62 Fib), while Usd/Chf is back in the upper end of a broad 0.9850-0.9900 band after mixed Swiss data (y/y PPI firmer than previous, but industrial orders slowed markedly). The Loonie is back under pressure and sub-1.3000 again vs its US counterpart as the NA disharmony continues to impact, and 1.3050 is the next upside chart target in sight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding around 1.1750 vs the Usd amidst expectations that the ECB will live up to recent more hawkish impulses (via sources and GC officials) tomorrow, but also checked by very large option expiries ranging from 1.1700-1.1800 and just above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A marginal outperformer, but mainly as a bi-product of relative weakness in the Aud as mentioned earlier, with the Kiwi keeping its head above 0.7000 vs the Usd and the cross retreating to sub-1.0800 territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM/SCANDI</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a case of more pain and more gain for the likes of the Lira vs Kronas as Usd/Try is back up near 4.7000 and pre-CRBT hike levels on heightened Turkish election jitters, while Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok trade at fresh multi-month lows after another upbeat regional survey (Riksbank hot on the heels of Norges Bank yesterday). Eur/Sek down through 10.1300 and Eur/Nok around 9.4250 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts extended their Liffe peak to 122.15 (+32 ticks) in wake of the benign vs expectations UK CPI data, and Bunds piggy-backed to post a fresh Eurex session high at 160.18 (+33 ticks) before both were hauled back by a really meek reception for the 10 year German auction. The benchmarks are now back to within a few ticks of parity, but Italian BTPs did inch a bit further towards 126.00 again at 125.94 (+125 ticks) before easing back in wake of Italian supply that went down better, albeit with higher premiums, outright and relative. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are treading a very tight line ahead of the FOMC, but could see some interim price action after PPI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were subdued overnight amid a slightly firmer USD with WTI crude futures also hampered by an unexpected build in API crude inventories, with the pressure exacerbated on a break below USD 66.00/bbl and the prior session&rsquo;s lows. This also came in the context of source reports suggesting Russia are to seek a rollback on oil cuts for most OPEC+ nations and propose OPEC+ share out 1.8mln bpd quota increase, with the plan said to leave 1mln bpd of involuntary oil cuts intact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In European trade, oil broke back above the USD 66.00/bbl level in the wake of the IEA monthly report forecasting stable oil demand, as well as Iranian and Venezuelan oil output possibly falling by almost 30%. The fossil fuel is still negative for the day, however, at USD 66.20/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further news in the oil sector emanated from the Kremlin with Russian President Putin not planning to discuss an exit from the global oil output deal with Saudi Crown Prince at their World Cup meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope Gold and base metals are all lower with traders tentative ahead of the FOMC&rsquo;s rate decision later in the day.</p>\r\n",

UK CPI is seen holding steady to slightly firmer, but higher oil prices and Gbp weakness is expected to lift PPI metrics, so could be more pertinent for bonds and STIRs following yesterday&rsquo;s mixed jobs/earnings release and the broadly weaker industrial data on Monday.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.6%) was dragged by weakness in energy and financials, although upside was seen in APA Group which surged over 20% after Cheung Kong Infrastructure made an offer for the Co. valued at AUD 13bln. This was also in tandem with a plethora of M&amp;A newsflow overnight that began stateside after a US judge ruled AT&amp;T could proceed with its acquisition of Time Warner without any conditions imposed, which in turn underpinned several media and telecom names on the prospects of open M&amp;A floodgates.

This could also have repercussions for the Disney/21st&nbsp;Century Fox deal, wherein Comcast have stated that if this deal was allowed, they would make an offer for the 21st Century Fox parts that the Walt Disney Company is in the process of acquiring for USD 52.4bln in stock.

The concessions saw PM May give in to demands from pro-EU MPs that parliament should be consulted on whether &ldquo;no deal is better than a bad deal&rdquo;. Furthermore, Solicitor General Buckland said he would be open to discussing the Grieve amendment with a view to accepting some or all of it in a new amendment in the Lords.

EUR/USD and GBP/USD were flat and languished near US-session lows, which provided the latter with some respite from the Brexit-related swings before another day of amendment voting at the House of Commons later.

As such, WTI crude futures were lower following an unexpected build in API crude inventories, with the pressure exacerbated on a break below USD 66.00/bbl as well as the prior session&rsquo;s lows.

(abcNEWS/Newswires/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted there is no limit what North Korea can achieve if it gives up nuclear weapons and embraces commerce &amp; engagement with the world, while he also wanted to thank North Korea Leader Kim for taking first bold step towards a bright new future for his people. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea said US President Trump agreed in summit to lift sanctions against North Korea and offer North Korea security, while North Korea also stated that US President Trump agreed to step-by-step denuclearization by the North in return for US concessions.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade subdued with participants tentative ahead of the looming FOMC decision later today in which the Fed are expected to hike rates for a 2nd time this year and with focus also on the dot plot projections for clues on the rate hike path. ASX 200 (-0.6%) is negative with the index dragged by weakness in energy and financials, although upside was seen in APA Group which surged over 20% after Cheung Kong Infrastructure made an offer for the Co. valued at AUD 13bln. This was also in tandem with a plethora of M&amp;A newsflow overnight that began stateside after a US judge ruled AT&amp;T could proceed with its acquisition of Time Warner without any conditions imposed, which in turn underpinned several media and telecom names on the prospects of open M&amp;A floodgates. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) is kept afloat by JPY weakness, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) and Hang Seng (-0.5%) are lower amid a looming Fed hike and expectations for China to follow suit by raising rates on its repo and lending facilities. Today also saw the resumption of trade for ZTE shares from a 2-month halt which hit limit down in Shenzhen and dropped around 40% in Hong Kong after agreeing to pay a USD 1.4bln penalty to the US, while there were also comments from President Trump that USD 80bln agriculture purchase commitment from China was insufficient which comes ahead of the China tariff decision deadline on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively quiet with the DXY flat overnight but holding onto the prior day&rsquo;s gains ahead of an anticipated Fed rate hike and following reports that Fed Chair Powell was considering conducting press conferences after every Fed meeting which could essentially make every meeting &lsquo;live&rsquo;. EUR/USD and GBP/USD are flat as they languish near US-session lows, which has provided the latter with some respite from the Brexit-related swings before another day of amendment voting at the House of Commons later. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies are also lacklustre with NZD barely holding on to the 0.7000 handle, while both AUD and CAD are vigourless amid recent weakness in the energy and metals complexes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid similar uneventful trade in T-notes and tentative tone in riskier assets, while the BoJ Rinban announcement also failed to spur demand with the amount at a relatively reserved JPY 505bln.</p>\r\n",
