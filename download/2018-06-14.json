However, reports later stated the UK government presented an amendment that falls short of rebel demands with the new clause giving Parliament a more limited say and which influential pro-EU MPs Soubry and Grieve suggested was &quot;unacceptable&quot;. Reports added that the implication is the government may face another Brexit rebellion next week.

Equities did see knee-jerk selling on news that the New York attorney general has filed a lawsuit against US President Trump, members of the Trump family and the Trump foundation regarding violations of charity laws, sending the ES to 2781, before establishing an intraday range between ~2783 and ~2790. In stock specifics, focus was on Comcast&rsquo;s (CMCSA) offer for 21st Century Fox&rsquo; outstanding assets, following the &lsquo;New Fox&rsquo; spin off. The offer stood at USD 35/shr, valuing it at $65bln, a 19% premium to Disney&rsquo;s (DIS) offer of $52bln. Fox saw intraday highs of just over 2%, Comcast touched 5% gains before selling-off slightly, and Disney, saw gains just shy of 3%. Also in focus, the US FDA reported Mylan&rsquo;s generic drug &lsquo;Advair Diskus&rsquo; presented some small deficiencies, which is to be announced on 27th June, led to the stock among the underperformer in the SPX, as well as Oracle (ORCL) which was downgraded at JPMorgan. Kohl&rsquo;s (KSS) was also lower today following a downgrade at Citi. SPX +0.25%, NDX +1.0%, DJI -0.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields edged lower on Friday, dancing to the tune of bunds, where yields fell in the wake of a dovish ECB rate decision, after the central bank signalled rates will remain on hold for a prolonged period of time, though QE is set to end in December. Money markets subsequently pushed-back its pricing in of an ECB hike to September 2019 from June 2019. But with that said, the Bund/Tsys spread did widen following decent retail sales data, and jobless claims. The Treasury curve itself saw bull-flattening, with 2s relatively unchanged, 10s backing away from 3.00%, and the 30-year sector falling by around 4bps to 3.06; however, spreads along the Treasury curve narrowed (5s30s -1bps, 2s30s -3bps, 2s10s -3bps, and 2s5s -2bps). US 10YR T-notes futures (Sep 2018) settle 7+ ticks higher at 119-24.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities up, Treasuries up, DXY up, Crude mixed.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Dovish ECB, solid US retail sales; OPEC+ may boost output by c.1.5mln bpd.<br />* AHEAD: BOJ overnight; CBR on Friday; US Industrial Production; EU final CPI; ECB and Fedspeak on Friday.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>The ECB announced a tapering of its asset purchase programme, which will be pared back to EUR 15bln/month (from EUR 30bln/month) after the current programme expires in September, and will at the end of 2018; the central bank kept its optionality to extend asset purchases again if necessary. The ECB also suggested that interest rates will not be lifted until the summer of 2019 at the earliest. President Draghi seemed unconcerned about the recent slowdown in economic data, and this was reflected in the ECB&rsquo;s latest economic projections, where near-term growth was nudged up, but longer-term forecasts were kept unchanged; the inflation profile for 2018 and 2019 were revised upwards due to higher oil prices. Draghi did, however, take time to note the uncertainty ahead (trade) while also dedicated more time to call on Eurozone nations to step-up reform efforts. The market interpreted the decisions and the press conference to be dovish. Later &ldquo;ECB sources&rdquo; reported that policymakers were split over the wording of ending QE, as well as guidance on rate rises; some wanted to keep the door open for an extension of QE, and others wanted to signal a possible rate hike in the middle of 2019, sources said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>White House is said to put tariffs on a smaller list of China products (between 800-900 products) on Friday; Trump will meet with advisors on Thursday to make a final decision. China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said will negotiate to resolve US trade disputes. US Secretary of State Pompeo told China&rsquo;s President Xi that President Trump truly values the relationship with Xi, while the Xi asked the US to deal with trade matters cautiously. The WTO chief said he sees no basis in WTO rules for US tariffs on steel and aluminium. On retaliatory measures, EU member countries unanimously approved duties on US products in retaliation to the steel and aluminium tariffs. Canada&#39;s Foreign Minister Freeland stated &#39;we will not escalate and we will not back down&#39; on US tariffs, once again talking up negotiations; on NAFTA, she said the three members agreed to have made progress so far and urged the need to keep working hard to get a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The government&rsquo;s compromise on the &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo; by MPs of the final Brexit deal was rejected by pro-EU leaning MPs, who branded it as &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo;. One interpretation of today&rsquo;s events is that if the government has no deal by 21 Jan 2019, it must explain what it does next, and parliament will vote on that proposal; the vote would be a &lsquo;neutral motion&rsquo; which means it cannot be amended. Pro-EU lawmakers were upset that the &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo; would be unamendable. A failure to reach a deal sets the stage for a showdown over the EU Withdrawal Bill next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRUMP SUED BY NY AG: </strong>The New York Attorney General announced a lawsuit against US President Trump and members of his family alleging illegal conduct relating to his personal charity and illegal coordination with his Presidential Campaign. Stocks sold-off after the news was reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>Retail Sales for May came in at 0.8%, beating expectations of 0.4%. The Ex-Autos figure was at 0.9%, beating the expected 0.5%. The strong prints were mostly attributed to higher gasoline prices and increasing raw material costs on the back of US tariffs. Retail Control, which excludes energy, posted a moderate 0.5%, supported by general merchandise, apparel and eating and drinking places. Analysts at Capital Economics said that given the robust report, it expects this to contribute positively to consumption in May. Elsewhere, Jobless Claims came in at 218k, slightly below consensus of 223k. Given the recent downside trend, the eight-week moving average moved below 220k for the first time since January 1970, Pantheon Macroeconomics said. Given that growth is accelerating, firms are hesitant is letting people off and would rather hire more instead, the consultancy said, and this further supports the Fed view, which following its rate decision yesterday, now sees two more hikes coming this year,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.25%, NDX +1.0%, DJI -0.1%.&nbsp;SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +1.0%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: 0.0%, Energy: -0.2%, Financials: -0.9%, Health Care: +0.5%, Industrials: -0.4%, Materials: +0.1%, Telecoms: +1.0%, Tech: +0.6%, Utilities: +1.2%.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* US equity futures were boosted in early trade from the dovish ECB, though the ES 2790 level continued to provide upside resistance. Equities did see knee-jerk selling on news that the New York attorney general has filed a lawsuit against US President Trump, members of the Trump family and the Trump foundation regarding violations of charity laws, sending the ES to 2781, before establishing an intraday range between ~2783 and ~2790. In stock specifics, focus was on Comcast&rsquo;s (CMCSA) offer for 21st Century Fox&rsquo; outstanding assets, following the &lsquo;New Fox&rsquo; spin off. The offer stood at USD 35/shr, valuing it at $65bln, a 19% premium to Disney&rsquo;s (DIS) offer of $52bln. Fox saw intraday highs of just over 2%, Comcast touched 5% gains before selling-off slightly, and Disney, saw gains just shy of 3%. Also in focus, the US FDA reported Mylan&rsquo;s generic drug &lsquo;Advair Diskus&rsquo; presented some small deficiencies, which is to be announced on 27th June, led to the stock among the underperformer in the SPX, as well as Oracle (ORCL) which was downgraded at JPMorgan. Kohl&rsquo;s (KSS) was also lower today following a downgrade at Citi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) SETTLE 7+ TICKS higher AT 119-24. </strong>Treasury yields edged lower on Friday, dancing to the tune of bunds, where yields fell in the wake of a dovish ECB rate decision, after the central bank signalled rates will remain on hold for a prolonged period of time, though QE is set to end in December. Money markets subsequently pushed-back its pricing in of an ECB hike to September 2019 from June 2019. But with that said, the Bund/Tsys spread did widen following decent retail sales data, and jobless claims. The Treasury curve itself saw bull-flattening, with 2s relatively unchanged, 10s backing away from 3.00%, and the 30-year sector falling by around 4bps to 3.06; however, spreads along the Treasury curve narrowed (5s30s -1bps, 2s30s -3bps, 2s10s -3bps, and 2s5s -2bps).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (N8) SETTLE 25 CENTS HIGHER AT $66.89/BBL; BRENT (Q8) SETTLES 80 CENTS LOWER AT $75.94/BBL. </strong>Brent was under pressure on Thursday, with investors said to be taking a cautious approach ahead of next week&rsquo;s OPEC+ meeting, where there is no firm consensus on the action the group can take, though some relaxation of output curbs are expected. WTI fared better. Crude prices took a knock in afternoon trade after Russia&rsquo;s Energy Minister Novak said OPEC+ could consider an output increase of up to 1.5mln BPD, adding that he has discussed with Saudi energy minister Al- Falih a gradual exit from global oil production cut deal, and both reiterated commitment to a balanced oil market, and pledging to work towards setting up a lasting structure for further cooperation &ndash; sentiments echoed by the Saudi Crown Prince and the Russian President when they met at the World Cup opener. Earlier in the session, the Saudis said they had heard proposals to raise oil output by 1.8mln BPD, and hoped to achieve a &quot;reasonable and moderate&quot; agreement at the meeting, noting it is inevitable the agreement will be on a gradual increase of output. Elsewhere, Iran&#39;s OPEC governor said Iran, Iraq, and Venezuela are aligned in maintaining the current OPEC deal. The Kazakstani Oil Ministry said Kazakstan&#39;s oil output has risen 1% in May to 1.845mln bpd; 10% above OPEC + output quota. The oil complex overlooked major disruption in Libya, where a force majeure was declared on crude loadings from Es Sider and Ras Lanuf oil ports, amid conflicts outside the ports. However, in later trade, prices saw a bounce after Nigeria&#39;s Qua Iboe crude oil cargo loadings were said to be delayed by roughly one week following a power outage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Ending Thursday&rsquo;s session as the biggest loser and right across the board as initial gains made on the further taper of asset purchases to end 2018 when the ECB aims to stop buying altogether gave way to a sharp reversal on other elements of the latest policy actions/guidance that were more dovish. Rates are not expected to be hiked until summer next year at the very earliest and President Draghi stressed that this does not necessarily mean September 2019 and the GC expressly gave no precise indication about timing (ie specific month or meeting). He went on to stress that the Bank has options to change course depending on whether the path of inflation towards its mandate remains sustainable. EUR longs subsequently bailed, and the single currency chewed through bids/support at 1.1600, dipping its toe beneath the figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>Conversely, the Dollar has recovered and reversed post-FOMC declines with the index up through 94.00 and 94.50 largely due to the aforementioned about-turn in the EUR that has the biggest index basket weighting, but also in wake of some upbeat US data too, which saw GDP trackers for Q2 nudged up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Also undermined by the single currency&rsquo;s fall from grace, with Cable seeing downside beneath 1.3300 from post-UK retail sales data highs of nearly 1.3450. EURGBP did, however, climb from lows around 0.8725towards 0.8750 after it emerged pro-EU leaning MPs rejected the government&rsquo;s so-called compromise on a &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo; of the Brexit deal. The upside was temporary however, amd EUR moved back to LOD. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>Contrasting fortunes for the non-US dollars, as the AUD never recovered from pretty poor Aussie data overnight even though Moody&rsquo;s reaffirmed the sovereign&rsquo;s AAA rating; but the Kiwi was relatively more resilient, albeit not so comfortable above 0.7000, and the Loonie retreated to 1.31 after Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said Canada &lsquo;will not escalate, but will not back down&rsquo; on US tariffs retaliation; weaker oil and general USD strength offered little respite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>BoJ rate decision due to be released Friday 15 June. The BOJ is expected to maintain its QQE with Yield Curve Control and keep NIRP at -0.10%. Expectations for the BOJ to maintain its ultra-loose policy have been supported by a slew of disappointing data since the last meeting. The announcement is also not expected to be eventful in terms of price action as has been the case for quite a while. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19388/download\">For the full preview click here</a>.</p>\r\n",

Prices took a hit in afternoon trade after Russia&rsquo;s Energy Minister Novak said OPEC+ could consider an output increase of up to 1.5mln bpd from 1 July, adding that he has discussed with Saudi energy minister Al- Falih a gradual exit from global oil production cut deal, and both reiterated commitment to a balanced oil market, with both to work towards setting up a lasting structure for further cooperation. And at the World Cup opening match, Saudi Crown Prince told Russian President Putin that KSA wants to continue cooperation with Russia on global oil markets, ahead of next week&rsquo;s meeting. Earlier in the session, the Saudi Energy Minister said he heard the proposal to increase oil output by 1.8mln BPD from different sources and hoped to achieve a &quot;reasonable and moderate&quot; agreement at the meeting, noting it is inevitable the agreement will be on a gradual increase of output. Elsewhere, Iran&#39;s OPEC governor said Iran, Iraq, and Venezuela are aligned in maintaining the current OPEC deal. The Kazakstani Oil Ministry said Kazakstan&#39;s oil output has risen 1% in May to 1.845mln bpd; 10% above OPEC + output quota. The oil complex overlooked major disruption in Libya, where a force majeure was declared on crude loadings from Es Sider and Ras Lanuf oil ports, amid conflicts outside the ports. However, in later trade, prices saw a bounce after Nigeria&#39;s Qua Iboe crude oil cargo loadings were said to be delayed by roughly one week following a power outage.</p>\r\n",

Rates are not expected to be hiked until summer next year at the very earliest and President Draghi stressed that this does not necessarily mean September 2019 and the GC expressly gave no precise indication about timing (ie specific month or meeting). He went on to stress that the Bank has options to change course depending on whether the path of inflation towards its mandate remains sustainable. Eur longs subsequently bailed and the single currency is now looking at bids/support ahead of 1.1600 vs a 1.1850 peak. Technically, a 1.1641 fib may be pivotal on a closing basis, but the market is still long on balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, the Dollar and DXY have recovered and reversed post-FOMC declines with the index up through 94.00 and almost reaching 94.500, largely due to the aforementioned about-turn in the Eur that has the biggest index basket weighting, but also in wake of some upbeat US data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next biggest G10 loser vs the Usd with the Franc slumping towards 0.9950, but mainly on the broader Eur selling that indirectly boosted the Greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also undermined by the single currency&rsquo;s fall from grace, with Cable re-testing 1.3300 from post-UK retail sales data highs of nearly 1.3450. For the Pound, latest Brexit news could provide more independent impetus with a deadline for the meaningful vote compromise fast approaching (17.00BST) amidst reports that a deal is agreed in principle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes for the non-US dollars, as the Aud never recovered from pretty poor Aussie data overnight even though Moody&rsquo;s reaffirmed the sovereign&rsquo;s AAA rating, but the Kiwi was relatively more resilient, albeit not so comfortable above 0.7000 and the Loonie retreated to 1.3000+ lows.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) opened lower although were off lows with strength in telecoms helping Australia to briefly return flat, while KOSPI (-1.3%) was the worst performer as it also took into account the weakness during the prior day&rsquo;s market closure. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.9%) was downbeat after the HKMA hiked rates in lockstep with the Fed and the Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) traded choppy with early support seen after the PBoC refrained from increasing its repo rates. However, upside in the mainland was later pared amid prospects of looming US tariffs on China and following disappointing Industrial Production and Retail Sales data, in which the latter grew at its slowest pace since 2003. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains amid the risk averse tone although upside was contained following the BoJ Rinban announcement in which the central bank reduced its purchase amounts in the belly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 70bln via 7-day reverse repos, CNY 50bln via 14-day reverse repos and CNY 30bln via 28-day reverse repos, for a net daily injection of CNY 70bln, while the PBoC kept its reverse repo rates unchanged despite the Fed hike.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are lower as traders are tentative ahead of the ECB&rsquo;s monetary policy decision, with moves dictated by equity specific stories. Rolls Royce (+3.0%) is leading the gains in the Stoxx 600, after the announcement that 4,600 jobs will be cut from the company in order to save GBP 400mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GlaxoSmithKline (+0.7%) is up as the co. reported positive top-line results for its Gemini 1&amp;2 studies, as well as competitor Mylan failing in a generic competitor for its blockbuster asthma treatment. This however is negated by the effect of a rising GBP following retail sales beats, with the FTSE 100 the underperforming bourse (-0.7%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index and Dollar overall has settled lower after some volatile moves in wake of the FOMC and despite an upgrade to dot plot rate projections from 1 more hike this year to 2, with some market observers pointing to the more dovish elements of the latest policy pronouncements, like the marginally smaller than forecast OIER tweak and ongoing symmetry around the inflation target, along with the various&nbsp; trade/tariff rifts between the US and other nations of course. Whatever the rationale, the DXY has retreated further from recent peaks just shy of 94.000 to sub-93.500 and remains on the back foot ahead of the ECB and US retail sales data later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Exceptionally strong UK retail sales data has boosted the Pound with Cable up to 1.3445 and Eur/Gbp back under 0.8800 as flagging BoE rate hike prospects get a partial reprieve. However, macro developments over the weak as a whole have been somewhat mixed and do not really change the near term outlook materially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - From zero to hero, or at least one of the main G10 beneficiaries of the Greenback&rsquo;s post-Fed about turn, as the headline pair retreats sharply from Wednesday&rsquo;s circa 110.70 highs to sub-110.00 and from a chart perspective back down below a key fib level (110.62 &ndash; 76.4% retracement of 111.39-108.12 decline). Tech bears are now eyeing another fib at 109.62 (50% of the rally from 108.12 to 110.85), but the next fundamental driver for the Jpy could come via the BoJ on Friday and there are also mega option expiries to consider around the big figure (3bln from 109.90-110.05).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/NZD/CAD - All around 0.2-0.25% firmer vs the Usd, with the Franc breaching the bottom end of recent trading boundaries and testing support ahead of 0.9800, while the single currency has regained 1.1800+ status ahead of the ECB. This will clearly provide near term impetus, but flow-wise there is decent option expiry interest of note between 1.1800-15 (1.3 bn) and then 1.1835-50 (1.1 bn) that may come into play. The Kiwi is still holding within a broad 0.7000-50 range and extending its outperformance down under as the AUD/Nzd recoils further from 1.0800 towards 1.0700 in wake of worse than expected Aussie jobs data overnight (in headline terms and internal dynamics via a drop in full time employment). Not even reaffirmation of Australia&rsquo;s top-notch credit rating at Moody&rsquo;s has come to the aid of the AUD. Meanwhile, the Loonie has regained a bit more composure to consolidate recovery gains off 1.3000+ lows vs its US peer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - Some volatility around Swedish inflation data, but ultimately not much change from pre-release levels as Eur/Sek sits roughly midway between 10.1900-1350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have plumbed fresh intraday lows, at 159.59 and 121.84 respectively as the former succumbed to more pronounced selling on a break below near term support at 159.80 to test and briefly probe just below yesterday&rsquo;s 159.63 Eurex low. Meanwhile, significant beats on UK retail sales prompted a round of offers on Liffe, albeit with the 10 year debt still &lsquo;outperforming&rsquo; in the preamble to the ECB, and perhaps still acknowledging relative resilience in US Treasuries after the Fed and before a raft of data including weekly jobless claims, retail sales, import/export prices and business inventories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In energy markets, Brent is down 0.2% on the day on Saudi affirmations that production is set to increase, with its US counterpart +0.1% around the levels post yesterday&rsquo;s DoE drawdown. Traders are also looking ahead to developments that may come from the Saudi-Russia meeting on the side-lines of the World Cup which kicks off today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is up on the day hitting 2 week highs as investors flock to safe havens ahead of the ECB&rsquo;s rate decision, as well as having support offered by a softer USD and trade concerns. The yellow metal is up 0.2% on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copper has fallen to a near one week low after weak Chinese industrial data. Steel is in the green for the 3rd straight session after China has said it will introduce a new capacity limit in certain areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi energy minister Al-Falih said it is inevitable the agreement will be on a gradual increase of output. Added he heard the proposal to increase oil output by 1.8mln BPD from different sources and he hopes to achieve a &quot;reasonable and moderate&quot; agreement at the meeting next week, as according to a source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n",

This however is negated by the effect of a rising GBP following retail sales beats, with the FTSE 100 the underperforming bourse (-0.7%).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index and Dollar overall has settled lower after some volatile moves in wake of the FOMC and despite an upgrade to dot plot rate projections from 1 more hike this year to 2, with some market observers pointing to the more dovish elements of the latest policy pronouncements, like the marginally smaller than forecast OIER tweak and ongoing symmetry around the inflation target, along with the various&nbsp; trade/tariff rifts between the US and other nations of course. Whatever the rationale, the DXY has retreated further from recent peaks just shy of 94.000 to sub-93.500 and remains on the back foot ahead of the ECB and US retail sales data later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Exceptionally strong UK retail sales data has boosted the Pound with Cable up to 1.3445 and Eur/Gbp back under 0.8800 as flagging BoE rate hike prospects get a partial reprieve. However, macro developments over the weak as a whole have been somewhat mixed and do not really change the near term outlook materially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - From zero to hero, or at least one of the main G10 beneficiaries of the Greenback&rsquo;s post-Fed about turn, as the headline pair retreats sharply from Wednesday&rsquo;s circa 110.70 highs to sub-110.00 and from a chart perspective back down below a key fib level (110.62 &ndash; 76.4% retracement of 111.39-108.12 decline). Tech bears are now eyeing another fib at 109.62 (50% of the rally from 108.12 to 110.85), but the next fundamental driver for the Jpy could come via the BoJ on Friday and there are also&nbsp;mega option expiries to consider&nbsp;around the big figure (3bln from 109.90-110.05).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/NZD/CAD - All around 0.2-0.25% firmer vs the Usd, with the Franc breaching the bottom end of recent trading boundaries and testing support ahead of 0.9800, while the single currency has regained 1.1800+ status ahead of the ECB. This will clearly provide near term impetus, but flow-wise there is decent option expiry interest of note between 1.1800-15 (1.3 bn) and then 1.1835-50 (1.1 bn) that may come into play. The Kiwi is still holding within a broad 0.7000-50 range and extending its outperformance down under as the AUD/Nzd recoils further from 1.0800 towards 1.0700 in wake of worse than expected Aussie jobs data overnight (in headline terms and internal dynamics via a drop in full time employment). Not even reaffirmation of Australia&rsquo;s top-notch credit rating at Moody&rsquo;s has come to the aid of the AUD. Meanwhile, the Loonie has regained a bit more composure to consolidate recovery gains off 1.3000+ lows vs its US peer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - Some volatility around Swedish inflation data, but ultimately not much change from pre-release levels as Eur/Sek sits roughly midway between 10.1900-1350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have plumbed fresh intraday lows, at 159.59 and 121.84 respectively as the former succumbed to more pronounced selling on a break below near term support at 159.80 to test and briefly probe just below yesterday&rsquo;s 159.63 Eurex low. Meanwhile, significant beats on UK retail sales prompted a round of offers on Liffe, albeit with the 10 year debt still &lsquo;outperforming&rsquo; in the preamble to the ECB, and perhaps still acknowledging relative resilience in US Treasuries after the Fed and before a raft of data including weekly jobless claims, retail sales, import/export prices and business inventories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In energy markets, Brent is down 0.2% on the day, and its US counterpart +0.1% on a softer USD. Traders are also looking ahead to developments that may come from the Saudi-Russia meeting on the sidelines of the World Cup which kicks off today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is up on the day hitting 2 week highs as investors flock to safe havens ahead of the ECB&rsquo;s rate decision, as well as having support offered by a softer USD and trade concerns. The yellow metal is up 0.2% on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copper has fallen to a near one week low after weak Chinese industrial data. Steel is in the green for the 3rd straight session after China has said it will introduce a new capacity limit in certain areas.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) opened lower although were off lows with strength in telecoms helping Australia to briefly return flat, while KOSPI (-1.3%) was the worst performer as it also took into account the weakness during the prior day&rsquo;s market closure.

However, the greenback then pared its gains as attention turned to ongoing trade concerns with the US reportedly preparing to proceed on imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, which helped EUR/USD and GBP/USD recover from the Fed-triggered pressure.

However, upside in the mainland was later pared amid prospects of looming US tariffs on China and following disappointing Industrial Production and Retail Sales data in which the latter grew at its slowest pace since 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD fluctuated in the wake of the FOMC with strength initially seen after the more hawkish tone from the Fed and expectations of an additional 2 hikes this year.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are subdued on safe-haven flows into the JPY, while AUD saw a bout of pressure on disappointing Australian jobs numbers and miss on the aforementioned Chinese data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are mildly higher amid the risk averse tone although gains are contained following the BoJ Rinban announcement in which the central bank reduced its purchase amounts in the belly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
