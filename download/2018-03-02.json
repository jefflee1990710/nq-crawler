        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +0.5%, NDX +0.9%, DJI -0.3%</strong><br />Stock index futures pared-back pre-market weakness, bouncing off 2650. As VIX eased after the US open (falling from ~26 to ~21), stocks caught a bid, closing the session near highs around 2690. SPX closes the week down around 2.5%<br />Top sectors: IT +1.0%, Health +1.0%, Cons Stap +0.8%<br />Bottom sectors: Materials -0.25%, Utilities -0.25%, Industrials -0.1%</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Note Futures settle 13 ticks lower at 120-25+.</strong><br />At settlement, yields were higher across the curve. Once again, action was in the belly of the curve, with 7s and 10s up by between 6-7bps. 2s yields this week rose to fresh cyclical highs near 2.28, but close out the week near 2.25%. Major curve spreads were wider by around 2nps (2s5s +2bps, 2s10s +2bps, 2s30s +2bps).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI crude futures settle 26 cents higher at $61.25/bbl; Brent futures settle 54 cents higher at $64.37/bbl</strong><br />WTI was down by 3.7% this week, as inventory builds in the US (and production rising to fresh record highs) is trumping the OPEC+ jawboning. Weaker Chinese PMIs also hint that global growth pressures may be easing, bring some caution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY down 0.4% on Friday</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD:&nbsp;Dollar on back foot, -0.37% on Friday, falling below the 90.00 figure in EU open trading and trading around the 90 handle until the days close, flat on the week. The action was likely driven by continued sour sentiment after yesterday&rsquo;s news that the US may apply tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY:&nbsp;Yen fell on Friday post-Kuroda&rsquo;s comments in the early European morning, where he spoke about exiting from easy policy if inflation targets are met, which he sees happening in 2020. USDJPY is -0.62% for the day and -1.10% for the week. The yen got a further boost after Trump&rsquo;s tweet stating &quot;trade wars are good.&quot; XAU +0.40% on Friday, post hitting week YTD lows on Thursday of 1302.61, but broke above the 1,320 level following Trump&rsquo;s protectionist narrative being pushed by his trade wars tweet. EURCHF fell through 1.15 in early morning EU trading, but rebounded back above the level as risk sentiment improved in the US day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR:&nbsp;The sisngle currency found buyers around 1.2250, pushing higher to end the week near 1.2325, benefiting more from USD selling rather than EUR-factors; caution remains around weekend event risk (Italian elections and SPD party member vote on a coalition with Merkel&#39;s conservatives).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP:&nbsp;Sterling traded in a range between the 1.3760 support level and 1.3816, though the air proved thin over the 38 handle. EUGBP, meanwhile, pushed through the 0.89 level that was acting as resistance on Thursday, trading up to 0.8950. PM May&rsquo;s speech revealed little new information, and sterling didn&rsquo;t react much. However, May made some key statements, noting the hard border on Ireland is irrevocable, but a customs partnership with the EU or streamlined customs arrangements are options. Following this a freedom to negotiate trade deals with other countries is necessary. Finally, she iterated that the UK is not looking for passporting for financial services and banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD:&nbsp;The Loonie has printed fresh YTD lows against the USD again; USDCAD broke above 1.29, rising to highs near 1.2915. Canada is likely to be among the hardest hit from any US steel/aluminium tariffs, and the country is said to be examining retaliatory sanctions it can apply against the US, as trade wars heat up.</p>\r\n",

The DXY had been extending recovery gains and reclaimed the 90.000 handle on a mixture of rising Treasury yields, above average month demand for currency portfolio rebalancing and mainly more hawkish/upbeat Fed outlooks on monetary policy/economy, inflation and wages. Indeed, also aided by a much better than expected ISM manufacturing survey the index all but reached the 91.000 level before reversing sharply back to and just below 90.000 again as global trade war and protectionist policy concerns were stoked again. The DXY just held above its 30 DMA at 89.678, but the Usd looks increasingly weak vs the safe-haven Jpy just above fresh ytd lows around 105.25 where KO option interests lie. Major stops are reported on a break of 105.00, which is also a big barrier level, and there is little in the way of technical support before 104.20, and then 104.00 for big figure and psychological reasons. Conversely, the Gbp and Cad underperformed vs the Greenback, with Cable down towards 1.3750 vs circa 1.4000 at the start of the week on a deterioration in UK-EU Brexit relations (stances on Irish border, customs union and ECJ still poles apart) and the Loonie still suffering from NAFTA uncertainty not to mention the 25% and 10% base metal taxes due to be charged next week. Eur/Usd hit a fresh 2018 low around 1.2155 on Thursday, but has regained 1.2300+ status on the end of week broad Dollar sell-off and now eyeing March 8&rsquo;s ECB policy meeting amidst source reports suggesting the easing bias may dropped from forward guidance, or at least discussed more realistically after a few hawkish GC members broached the subject last time. The single currency is also susceptible to any shocks from weekend votes in Italy and Germany, but low option volatilities indicate not much risk premium over the events (or complacency?). Quite a bit of weakness down under, with the Aud trending lower below 0.7750 vs the Usd on disappointing data ahead of the RBA and the Kiwi undermined by an unexpected NZ trade deficit, as Nzd/Usd tests bids/support in the low 0.7200 area. An interesting few days in Scandi-land, with Eur/Nok very whippy after Norway cut its inflation target to 2% from 2.5% and slumping to sub-9.5500 before rebounding swiftly again (towards 9.6800+ highs) as the Norges Bank played down the impact on policy. Meanwhile, the Sek slumped to fresh multi-year lows vs the Eur (10.1800+) on a combination of sub-consensus data and a cautious Riksbank message.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>Who is voting and why?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following last year&rsquo;s German elections enough seats were not obtained to secure a majority government with just the CDU/CSU alliance. Initially, the alliance tried to strike an agreement to form a &lsquo;Jamaica&rsquo; coalition. However, these talks broke down and Merkel instead turned to Martin Schulz&rsquo;s SPD party. SPD party members have until Friday 2<sup>nd</sup> March to decide yes or no to the proposed coalition with Merkel. Results are likely to be seen in the afternoon of Sunday 4<sup>th</sup> March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happens if they vote yes?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is likely the SPD members are going to agree to the CDU/CSU/SPD deal, as recent polls</p>\r\n\r\n<p>suggest 56% of voters support the coalition. If this is the case, any short-term political uncertainty will be put to rest, however, any policy differences may create some hurdles for the coalition later down the line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If they vote no?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either a minority government will be formed, or new German elections will be taking place. SocGen believe the chances of a new election are high if the majority vote no. Following a new election, the SPD may not be in the race, as recent polls showed the SPD received less than 20% of votes, with only 14% of German voters supporting Nahles as chancellor, compared to Merkel&rsquo;s 48%. This may be enough to sway some of those voting no in the SPD. Also, UBS note a new election may lead to a delay in discussions and decisions on the Eurozone reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Market Reaction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets are expecting the 10y Bund to be relatively unmoved following the vote as traders look out for next week&rsquo;s ECB meeting. However, UBS note, along with the Italian election, the spreads between peripheral bonds may widen in the event that the SPD votes yes and the Italian election proves to be indecisive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity and FX markets see very limited risk on this event, but SocGen do note if the vote</p>\r\n\r\n<p>passes it does support their bullish position on EUR, but if it doesn&rsquo;t pass, it supports their long</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DAX/short FTSE MIB position on the basis that the FDP could enter the government and potentially act as a headwind for peripheral assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The announcement by President Trump to set tariffs on aluminium and steel imports next week also resulted to a global backlash in which EU, Canada and Mexico vowed countermeasures or retaliation against the US, while the China Iron and Steel Association branded the measure as &lsquo;stupid&rsquo;. As such, <strong>ASX 200 (-0.7%)</strong>, <strong>Nikkei 225 (-2.5%)</strong> and <strong>KOSPI (-1.0%)</strong> saw commodity-related pressure with steel names in Asia&rsquo;s top US-bound steel exporters Japan and South Korea suffering the brunt of the impending tariffs, while heavily-exposed automakers were also reeling from the news. <strong>Hang Seng (-1.5%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) </strong>conformed to the downbeat tone, although weakness in the mainland was to a lesser extent as China was said to only export a limited amount of steel to US and after another weekly net liquidity injection by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially higher with demand spurred amid a broad risk-averse tone and with the BoJ present in the market for 1yr-10yr JGBs under an unchanged Rinban operation, although pressure was later seen on comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda that they will be considering exit around fiscal 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 40bln via 7-day reverse repos, CNY 30bln via 28-day reverse repos and CNY 20bln via 63-day reverse repos for a net weekly injection of CNY 120bln vs. Prev. CNY 580bln net injection last week. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3334 (Prev. 6.3352)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BoJ Governor Kuroda</strong> said BoJ will be considering exit around fiscal 2019 and that there could be a policy change before 2% target is reached, but BoJ may also keep rates unchanged even with CPI at the target. Kuroda had also commented that he will maintain current policy for now as momentum is good and that he is cautious on raising the yield target even if yields increase and other central banks exit loose policy.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were initial reports that White House is said to be preparing to replace Trump National Security Adviser McMaster. However, NSC spokesman later stated that US President Trump labelled the story related to the departure of National Security Adviser McMaster as fake news.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Cabinet is said to be in dispute regarding text ahead of PM May&#39;s key Brexit speech, while there were also reports that UK PM May will not commit to mirroring EU regulations. (FT/Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>European bourses firmly in the red (Eurostoxx 50 -1.5%)</strong> following the sell-off seen in Asia and Wall St. with 85% of the Stoxx 600 in the red after Trump&rsquo;s aluminium and steel tariffs spooked markets amid fears of potential trade wars. Industrial and auto names are the underperformers this morning over fears of production cost hikes. Noticeable laggards contain the likes of <strong>Fiat Chrysler (-4.9%), LafargeHolcim (-5.0%) ArcelorMittal (-4.0%), ThyssenKrupp (-2.8%), </strong>and<strong> Peugeot (-1.8%).</strong> <strong>DAX (-2.2%)</strong> a notable laggard as investors grow cautious over Sunday&rsquo;s SPD vote and as such, the index made a breach of the psychological 12000 level. Political risk is also filtering through to the <strong>FSTE MIB (-2.1%)</strong> as markets prep themselves for this weekend&rsquo;s Italian election</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Dollar</strong> is on the backfoot again with the <strong>DXY</strong> unable to extend its recent rebound to or through 91.000 despite hawkish talk from 2018 FOMC voter Dudley (said four tightening moves this year would still constitute a gradual pace of policy normalisation). His comments, and Powell&rsquo;s second testimony for that matter, were completely overshadowed by the latest moves from President Trump to protect US steel and aluminium producers that have triggered a fresh round of global trade war concerns (and retaliatory remarks unsurprisingly). The index is back down in the low 90.000s having marginally eclipsed nearest chart resistance around 90.900 at one stage yesterday, and the Greenback is a broad loser vs other G10s, bar the Pound and <strong>Loonie</strong> due to ongoing Brexit and NAFTA related uncertainty/risks. Yet again it is the <strong>Jpy</strong> that is outperforming and not just against the <strong>Usd</strong>, but generally as the headline pair trades sub-106.00 and close to ytd lows around 105.55, with put options at the 105.00 strike also weighing, albeit offset by reported barriers at 105.50 and the figure. <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong> has retreated a bit further below 130.00 and not far from 129.50 support, while <strong>Gbp</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong> is eyeing 145.50. <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> has rebounded firmly above 1.2200 having slipped to a fresh 2018 low on Thursday around 1.2155, but could remain capped ahead of 1.2300 and drawn to a very big expiry at 1.2250 (3.1 bn). Cable only seeing mild upside within a 1.3750-1.3800 wide range in wake of a firmer than forecast UK construction PMI, with more focus on PM May&rsquo;s latest Brexit address in response to the EU&rsquo;s draft on Wednesday after Carney failed to mention anything specific on monetary policy in his text. <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Chf</strong> has reversed sharply on safe-haven positioning (like the <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong> and <strong>Jpy</strong> crosses) to just above 0.9350 vs almost 0.9500 late yesterday as global stocks continue to recoil on the heightened prospect of protectionism. EUR/NOK was dealt a blow after The Norwegian Finance ministry lowered the Norges Bank inflation target to 2.0% from 2.5%. However, the move was partially reversed after Norges Bank stated that this will be unlikely to lead to a significant change in the implementation of monetary policy. Back to the majors, Usd/Cad is hovering around 1.2850 ahead of Candian GDP data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s still not all-out risk aversion or a full-on safety flight, but the 10 year EU benchmarks have gleaned more positive momentum from extended falls in equities as the anti-Trump tariff chorus grows louder and concerns about global trade wars and protectionism ratchet up. <strong>Bunds</strong> have now surpassed the next chart resistance area beyond 160.00 to reach 160.18 (+48 ticks) and <strong>Gilts</strong> continue to tag along at 121.92 (+41 ticks), but carrying some tail risk from upcoming events (BoE Carney and PM May), while <strong>USTs</strong> have pared some losses with futures now only just below parity and the long bond flat vs circa &frac12; point adrift at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across the commodity complex, newsflow has been dominated by Trump&rsquo;s announcement on import tariffs for steel and <strong>aluminium</strong>. Following this, <strong>aluminium</strong> futures fell 0.5%, while <strong>Shanghai</strong> <strong>steel</strong> prices 5-day rally came to a halt amid fears that the tariff plan could lead to a glut. Precious metals hover around yesterday&rsquo;s high as risk off flows support <strong>gold</strong>, alongside the softer USD. <strong>WTI</strong> and Brent crude futures trending lower this morning with prices dictated by the risk off sentiment. Levels to the downside for Brent which may over some support is situated at USD 63.19 (yesterday&rsquo;s low) at USD 61.75 (double bottom)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Canada and EU vowed countermeasures against US steel and aluminium tariffs</strong>, while Mexico also stated that it would retaliate with its own tariffs against US if it is not excluded from the steel and aluminium tariffs. Furthermore, China Iron and Steel Association said US tariffs on steel and aluminium are &#39;stupid&#39; trade protectionism measures and that China only exports a limited amount of steel to US, while China Metals Association said China is among the nations likely to retaliate against the US.

        "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European bourses firmly in the red following the sell-off seen in Asia and Wall St. with 80% of the Stoxx 600 in the red after Trump&rsquo;s aluminium and steel tariffs spooked markets amid fears of potential trade wars. Industrial and auto names are the underperformers this morning over fears of production cost hikes. Noticeable laggards contain the likes of Fiat Chrysler (-5.9%), Lafargeholcim (-4.1%) ArcelorMittal (-3.8%), ThyssenKrupp (-2.8%), and Peugeot (-2.4%). DAX the worst performer as investors grow cautious over Sunday&rsquo;s SPD vote and as such, the index made a breach of the psychological 12000 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar is on the backfoot again with the DXY unable to extend its recent rebound to or through 91.000 despite hawkish talk from 2018 FOMC voter Dudley (said four tightening moves this year would still constitute a gradual pace of policy normalisation). His comments, and Powell&rsquo;s second testimony for that matter, were completely overshadowed by the latest moves from President Trump to protect US steel and aluminium producers that have triggered a fresh round of global trade war concerns (and retaliatory remarks unsurprisingly). The index is back down in the low 90.000s having marginally eclipsed nearest chart resistance around 90.900 at one stage yesterday, and the Greenback is a broad loser vs other G10s, bar the Pound and Loonie due to ongoing Brexit and NAFTA related uncertainty/risks. Yet again it is the Jpy that is outperforming and not just against the Usd, but generally as the headline pair trades sub-106.00 and close to ytd lows around 105.55, with put options at the 105.00 strike also weighing, albeit offset by reported barriers at 105.50 and the figure. Eur/Jpy has retreated a bit further below 130.00 and not far from 129.50 support, while Gbp/Jpy is eyeing 145.50. Eur/Usd has rebounded firmly above 1.2200 having slipped to a fresh 2018 low on Thursday around 1.2155, but could remain capped ahead of its 10 DMA at 1.2294 and drawn to a very big expiry at 1.2250 (3.1 bn). Cable only seeing mild upside within a 1.3750-1.3800 wide range in wake of a firmer than forecast UK construction PMI, with more focus on a speech from BoE Governor Carney and PM May&rsquo;s latest Brexit address in response to the EU&rsquo;s draft on Wednesday. Usd/Chf has reversed sharply on safe-haven positioning (like the Usd/Jpy and Jpy crosses) to just above 0.9350 vs almost 0.9500 late yesterday as global stocks continue to recoil on the heightened prospect of protectionism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixed Income</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s still not all-out risk aversion or a full-on safety flight, but the 10 year EU benchmarks have gleaned more positive momentum from extended falls in equities as the anti-Trump tariff chorus grows louder and concerns about global trade wars and protectionism ratchet up. Bunds have now surpassed the next chart resistance area beyond 160.00 to reach 160.18 (+48 ticks) and Gilts continue to tag along at 121.85 (+34 ticks), but carrying some tail risk from upcoming events (BoE Carney and PM May), while USTs have pared some losses with futures now only just below parity and the long bond flat vs circa &frac12; point adrift at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across the commodity complex, newsflow has been dominated by Trump&rsquo;s announcement on import tariffs for steel and aluminium. Following this, aluminium futures fell 0.5%, while Shanghai steel prices 5-day rally came to a halt amid fears that the tariff plan could lead to a glut. Precious metals hover around yesterday&rsquo;s high as risk off flows support gold, alongside the softer USD. WTI and Brent crude futures trending lower this morning with prices dictated by the risk off sentiment. Levels to the downside for Brent which may over some support is situated at USD 63.19 (yesterday&rsquo;s low) at USD 61.75 (double bottom)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Although US Treasuries have pulled back from overnight highs, with yields off lows accordingly, Bunds have advanced further off Friday&rsquo;s Eurex open and briefly breached the 160.00 level amidst significantly weaker than forecast German retail sales data. Not normally a market-mover given its notoriously volatile nature, but the big miss merely adds to the rationale for downside pressure across EU cash bourses after Wall Street&rsquo;s latest sell-off and knock-on declines in Asia-Pac equities. Bunds kicked off at 158.90 vs Thursday&rsquo;s 159.70 close and reached 160.02 on follow-through/stop-buying before fading, for now at least. To recap, nearest resistance resides around 160.10-11. Meanwhile, Gilts have also re-joined the fray on the front foot, albeit lagging somewhat between early 121.75-60 Liffe parameters vs their 121.51 previous settlement and unwinding recent outperformance ahead of the UK construction PMI, BoE Governor Carney&rsquo;s speech and a potentially even more pivotal Brexit address by PM May. At the short end, an underlying bid tone persists despite further curve flattening overall and especially in the US where Fed&rsquo;s Dudley has hinted at 4 hikes this year.</p>\r\n",

The announcement by President Trump to set tariffs on aluminium and steel imports next week also resulted to a global backlash in which EU, Canada and Mexico vowed countermeasures or retaliation against the US, while the China Iron and Steel Association branded the measure as &lsquo;stupid&rsquo;. As such, <strong>ASX 200 (-0.7%), Nikkei 225 (-2.8%) </strong>and<strong> KOSPI (-1.0%)</strong> saw commodity-related pressure with steel names in Asia&rsquo;s top US-bound steel exporters Japan and South Korea suffering the brunt of the impending tariffs, while heavily-exposed automakers were also reeling from the news. <strong>Hang Seng (-1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) </strong>conformed to the downbeat tone, although weakness in the mainland was to a lesser extent as China was said to only export a limited amount of steel to US and after another weekly net liquidity injection by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially higher with demand spurred amid a broad risk-averse tone and with the BoJ present in the market for 1yr-10yr JGBs under an unchanged Rinban operation, although pressure was later seen on comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda that they will be considering exit around fiscal 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 40bln via 7-day reverse repos, CNY 30bln via 28-day reverse repos and CNY 20bln via 63-day reverse repos for a net weekly injection of CNY 120bln vs. Prev. CNY 580bln net injection last week. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3334 (Prev. 6.3352)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda said BoJ will be considering exit around fiscal 2019 and that there could be a policy change before 2% target is reached, but BoJ may also keep rates unchanged even with CPI at the target. Kuroda had also commented that he will maintain current policy for now as momentum is good and that he is cautious on raising the yield target even if yields increase and other central banks exit loose policy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK PM May said Brexit deal must give UK control of its border, laws and money, while she added they will place &lsquo;5 tests&rsquo; on the Brexit deal. (Newswires)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK Cabinet is said to be in dispute regarding text ahead of PM May&#39;s key Brexit speech, while there were also reports that UK PM May will not commit to mirroring EU regulations. (FT/Times)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB Sources stated an ECB policy shift is unlikely in the March meeting, but there may be a discussion on easing bias being dropped.

Elsewhere, <strong>CNH</strong> bucked the trend and lost ground to USD after a tepid reference rate setting by the PBoC which kept the fix relatively stable and amid some speculation that currency devaluation could be used as one of the weapons by China in the event of a full-on trade war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were uneventful overnight in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures languished following this week&rsquo;s losses and its first monthly decline since August, with prices now back below USD 61/bbl. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> also traded sideways and held onto US session gains due to a weaker greenback on US trade protectionism concerns, with the resulting risk-averse tone hampering any meaningful reprieve for <strong>copper</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Petroleum Institute said that Trump tariffs on aluminium and steel would raise costs in the oil and gas sector. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed Chair Powell</strong> said we are not currently seeing strong evidence for a decisive move higher in wages. Powell also said he expects more wage increases and gradual rate hikes to be appropriate, while he added that fiscal policy will likely put upward pressure on inflation this year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&rsquo;s Dudley (Voter)</strong> is gaining confidence that rate hikes will be required and said that 4 rate hikes would be gradual. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump announced that the US will institute steel &amp; aluminium tariffs next week, in which reports stated would consist of 25% tariffs for steel and 10% for aluminium. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada and EU vowed countermeasures against US steel and aluminium tariffs, while Mexico also stated that it would retaliate with its own tariffs against US if it is not excluded from the steel and aluminium tariffs. Furthermore, China Iron and Steel Association said US tariffs on steel and aluminium are &#39;stupid&#39; trade protectionism measures and that China only exports a limited amount of steel to US, while China Metals Association said China is among the nations likely to retaliate against the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were initial reports that White House is said to be preparing to replace Trump National Security Adviser McMaster. However, NSC spokesman later stated that US President Trump labelled the story related to the departure of National Security Adviser McMaster as fake news. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Special Counsel Mueller is reportedly compiling a case against Russians who carried out hacking and information leaking which was intended to hurt Democrats in 2016 election.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are negative across the board as region follows suit from Wall St. where the majors posted their 3<sup>rd</sup> consecutive losing streak after reports of incoming Trump tariffs stoked trade war fears and amid raised prospects of 4 Fed hikes this year. The announcement by President Trump to set tariffs on aluminium and steel imports next week also resulted to global backlash in which EU, Canada and Mexico vowed countermeasures or retaliation against the US, while the China Iron and Steel Association labelled the measure as &lsquo;stupid&rsquo;. As such, ASX 200 (-1.2%), Nikkei 225 (-2.9%) and KOSPI (-1.6%) saw commodity-related pressure with steel names in Asia&rsquo;s top US-bound steel exporters Japan and South Korea suffering the brunt of the impending tariffs, while heavily-exposed automakers were also reeling from the news. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) conformed to the downbeat tone, although weakness in the mainland was to a lesser extent as China is said to only export a limited amount of steel to US and after another weekly net liquidity injection by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD was the main fallout of the trade war concerns and subsequent retaliation fears which underpinned all its major counterparts and saw EUR/USD gain a firm foothold of the 1.2200 handle. Elsewhere, USD/JPY briefly declined below 106.00 amid the weakness in the greenback and safe-haven flows into JPY, while CNH bucks the trend and has lost ground to USD after a tepid reference rate setting by the PBoC which kept the fix relatively stable and amid some speculation that currency devaluation could be used as one of the weapons by China in the event of a full-on trade war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with demand spurred amid upside in T-notes and a broad risk-averse tone, while the BoJ are also present in the market for 1yr-10yr JGBs with the amounts of its Rinban operation kept unchanged from prior.</p>\r\n",
