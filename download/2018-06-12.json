USD saw a kneejerk bid after the report, sending it to session highs against most major FX. Elsewhere, the Senate Banking Committee advanced nominations of Richard Clarida (for Fed Vice Chair) and Michelle Bowman (for Governor).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Ahead of today&rsquo;s key Brexit vote, reports suggested UK PM May had made a last minute deal with Tory rebels to secure their support; she was said to have offered an olive branch to Remainers in the Conservative Party regarding customs arrangements with EU in the future. The House of Commons voted to reject the &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo; therefore parliament have less of a say in Brexit negotiations. The &lsquo;Brexit Day&rsquo; vote was also rejected, therefore, the UK will exit the EU on 29 March 2019. &lsquo;Henry VIII Powers&rsquo; were also rejected, and this means ministers can use their delegated powers when it suits, rather than when it is only necessary. At pixel time, we are still waiting for votes on the Customs Union (amendment 1, which would require the government to report on its efforts to negotiate a Customs Union) and EEA membership (amendment 51, which would require the government to negotiate membership of the European Economic Area)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Canada&#39;s Foreign Minister Freeland said it is hoping for the best, but is prepared for the worst regarding NAFTA; she is expected to meet US Trade Representative Lighhizer in Washington this week. Freeland also said that PM Trudeau raised issue of autos tariffs &#39;very clearly&#39; with Trump last week, and she is prepared for any eventuality over auto tariffs; Trudeau himself reiterated that a sunset clause in NAFTA is unacceptable. Elsewhere, Norway has requested WTO dispute resolution with the US. German Chancellor Merkel suggested the US would have a large surplus with the EU if services were included in calculations; she also added that she lobbied against one-sided car tariffs with the US. Russian deputy foreign minister said the nation will retaliate to the latest US sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> The Trump-Kim meeting provided headline fluff, but failed to ignite any new risk bid; analysts were questioning what sort of impact the deal will have, though many welcomed progress being made with Kim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>US CPI headline hit a six-year high and came in at 2.8%, beating expectations of 2.7%. The monthly figure was in line at 0.2%. Capital Economics noted that most of the increase has been attributed to higher energy prices which rose by 1.7% last month though base line effects, originating from a 5.3% drop in gasoline prices last May, also provided further support to inflation. Core CPI ticked higher in May to 0.2%, slightly above the 0.1% consensus supported by higher hotel room rates and medical care prices and despite a fall in used car prices and air fares. Core CPI y/y came in line at 2.2% as wages continue to move higher and as administrated healthcare prices are anticipated to rise. Overall, the latest release backs the Fed view of three or four hikes this year, CapEco said, beginning with the first hike at the upcoming meeting on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.17%, NDX +0.57%, DJI -0.01%.&nbsp;</strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +0.40%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.02%, Energy: -0.76%, Financials: -0.26%, Health Care: -0.12%, Industrials: -0.04%, Materials: +0.07%, Telecoms: -0.32%, Tech: +0.41%, Utilities: +1.15%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Twitter (TWTR) outperformed the SPX on Tuesday trade following a price target hike from JPMorgan from $39 to $50, taking them to intraday highs of ~6.5%. Tesla (TSLA) outperformed the NDX for most of the day, though reports it is to cut its workforce by 9% the stock run into sellers. ADP (ADP) outlined its plans to invest and accelerate its transformation initiatives, after guiding higher. Attention is on AT&amp;T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), with Judge Leon set to deliver his ruling after the closing bell. M&amp;A News was relatively light today; in late trade, it was reported that Embraer (ERJ) &amp; Boeing (BA) were discussing the details to finalise a deal, and Brazil President Temer was said to have agreed in principal on the JV between the two jet manufacturers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (N8) SETTLES UP 26 CENTS AT $66.36/BBL; BRENT (Q8) SETTLES 58 CENTS LOWER AT $75.88/BBL.</strong> Crude was mixed on Tuesday with WTI marginally up whilst Brent remained slightly lower ahead of API data after the bell (analysts forecast crude stocks will draw by 2.7mln in the week; products are seen building in the week, by 200k and 400k for distillate and gasoline, respectively), IEA&rsquo;s Monthly Report on Wednesday, and the OPEC meeting next week, where new oil supply measure will be discussed. On the subject, OPEC is likely to agree production increase next week, according to 18 of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News; the headline contributed to some negative ticks for crude in afternoon trade. Earlier in the session, OPEC reported that secondary sources see OPEC crude supply up by 35,000 bpd to 31.87mln bpd last month, the first increase in eight months. Later, the EIA published its oil demand forecasts, and anticipates 2018 world demand will rise by 40k and 2019 world oil demand to fall by 10k. It also forecasts 2018 US crude oil production to increase by 1.44mln bpd (prev. forecast saw 1.37mln bpd) and US crude oil production to rise by 970,000 bpd in 2019 (prev. forecast saw 14mln bpd). The EIA revised up 2019 oil demand view to +260,000 bpd (prev. forecast +260,000 bpd) and 2018 oil demand to rise by 530,000 bpd (prev. forecast saw 500,000 bpd). Elsewhere, it was reported the Iranian oil and condensate exports reached a record after exceeding 2.6mln bpd in the last two months. Finally, the Iraqi government voted to increase production at the Nasyria oil field to 100k bpd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) 1 TICK LOWER AT 119-13. </strong>The complex was drifting lower in pre-market trade ahead of US CPI data, and Wednesday&rsquo;s FOMC rate decision. Action was generally contained within narrow ranges. Most of the action was in the front end of the curve where 2yr and 5yr yields were up by c.2bps at settlement. 2s30 and 5s30s widened by c.1bps. The US Treasury auctioned $14bln of 30-year notes, tailing by 0.1bps; demand was firm, with indirects taking down above recent averages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD:</strong> Initial positive momentum on the back of the US-NK summit faded relatively quickly as it transpired that the historic signing of a &lsquo;comprehensive&rsquo; agreement was actually light on content and concrete details as to how Trump and Kim actually propose to work together on denuclearisation. Data did little to lift the Greenback as CPI metrics were close to consensus. In afternoon trade, a WSJ piece suggesting Powell was considering a post-meeting press conference after every rate decision put a bid into the USD, which rose to highs against majors, with the exception of GBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> The rollercoaster continues, with GBP whipsawing on Brexit headlines. As the vote on Lords amendments got underway, GBP jumped after lawmakers backed the government on &lsquo;Brexit day&rsquo;, confirming the exit date; though after the government won backing in &lsquo;Henry VIII powers&rsquo; and &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo;, some of the gains were given back, since it ultimately signals less of a chance of moving towards a softer Brexit deal. At pixel time, amendments on &lsquo;customs union&rsquo; and &lsquo;EEA membership&rsquo; are yet to take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> Continues to underperform within the G10 sphere, with USDJPY entering APAC trade above its 200dma around 110.21 on a mixture of positive risk sentiment overall, and relative Fed/BoJ policy outlooks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie continues to trade horizontally in June, more or less trading either side of the 1.30 level on Tuesday, before the WSJ reported that the Fed was considering a press conference after every meeting, which lent strength to the buck, sending USDCAD towards HOD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>FOMC Rate Decision due at 1900 BST/1400 EDT on 13 June 2018; press conference with Chair Powell scheduled for 1930 BST/1430 EDT.

On the subject, OPEC is likely to agree production increase next week, according to 18 of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News; the headline contributed to some negative ticks for crude in afternoon trade. Earlier in the session, OPEC reported that secondary sources see OPEC crude supply up by 35,000 bpd to 31.87mln bpd last month, the first increase in eight months. Later, the EIA published its oil demand forecasts, and anticipates 2018 world demand will rise by 40k and 2019 world oil demand to fall by 10k. It also forecasts 2018 US crude oil production to increase by 1.44mln bpd (prev. forecast saw 1.37mln bpd) and US crude oil production to rise by 970,000 bpd in 2019 (prev. forecast saw 14mln bpd). The EIA revised up 2019 oil demand view to +260,000 bpd (prev. forecast +260,000 bpd) and 2018 oil demand to rise by 530,000 bpd (prev. forecast saw 500,000 bpd). Elsewhere, it was reported the Iranian oil and condensate exports reached a record after exceeding 2.6mln bpd in the last two months. Finally, the Iraqi government voted to increase production at the Nasyria oil field to 100k bpd.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initial euphoria and positive momentum on the back of the US-NK summit faded relatively quickly as it transpired that the historic signing of a &lsquo;comprehensive&rsquo; agreement was actually light on content and concrete details as to how Trump and Kim actually propose to work together on denuclearisation. Data did little to lift the Greenback as CPI metrics were close if not bang in line with consensus depending on the source of median forecasts and mathematical rounding. Hence, the broad Dollar and index are largely drifting into the FOMC meeting, with G10 pairings narrowly mixed and the DXY rangebound between 93.500-900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both still underperforming within the G10 sphere, with Usd/Jpy looking set to end Tuesday&rsquo;s session very close to a pivotal 110.00-25 pivotal area that houses the 200 DMA (110.21) on a mixture of risk-on sentiment overall and relative Fed vs BoJ policy outlooks. Meanwhile, the Loonie continues to test support vs its US counterpart circa 1.3000 in wake of the deterioration in US-Canadian relations at the G7 gathering and negative implications for NAFTA negotiations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another net loser on the day, albeit just, as Cable retreated from 1.3400+ levels to sub-1.3350 at one stage ahead of the Commons vote on EU withdrawal terms that looks set to be tight. Note, mixed UK labour and earnings data did not really impact, but CPI on Wednesday may be more market-moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All flat or fractionally firmer vs the Usd around 0.9850, 1.1800, 0.7025 and 0.7600 respectively, with the single currency recovering from a downturn after a downbeat ZEW survey and influenced by decent expiry option interest spanning 1.1775-90 (1.5 bn). Meanwhile, the antipodean dollars chopped and changed either side of parity vs the US peer and each other, with the cross hovering just above 1.0800, and as the Aud continues to reflect on mixed Aussie data overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCANDI</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok down despite aforementioned Eur resilience elsewhere (Eur/Gbp above 0.8800 for example), with the latter pairing down to fresh lows for 2018 (sub-9.4350) in wake of an upbeat Norges Bank region survey, while the Swedish Krona initially tracked its neighbour higher before making more headway vs the Eur below 10.1400.</p>\r\n",

The meeting between the 2 leaders was seen as amicable in which the leaders shook hands several times and exchanged pleasantries, although the initial face-to-face was somewhat less awe-inspiring than that of the inter-Korean summit in April. In addition, after one-on-one discussions Trump suggested a &lsquo;very very good, good relationship&rsquo; and Kim stated there will be challenges ahead but will work with US President Trump, although reports also noted that Kim refrained from answering questions on denuclearisation. ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) were positive with early outperformance seen in Japan amid a weaker currency, although some of the gains were pared due to pessimism that a swift agreement could be reached for the Korean peninsula. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) have swung between gains and losses alongside a broad tentative tone across the region and after a tepid liquidity effort by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued amid a lack of conviction in the region and with an enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds largely ignored, which showed slight decline in the bid to cover and tighter accepted spreads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 7-day reverse repos, CNY 20bln via 14-day reverse repos and CNY 30bln via 28-day reverse repos, for a net daily injection of CNY 30bln.

Furthermore, UK Brexit Secretary Davis is said to back deal to buy-off Tory rebels on both wings of the party ahead of the EU Withdrawal Bill vote in the UK&#39;s lower house. UK solicitor general Baker that the government is discussing with lawmakers the replacement of an Upper House amendment on EU&#39;s customs union and that it is appropriate to have a customs arrangement with the EU. (Newswires) UK Conservative MP Grieve said to have tabled a compromise amendment on the Brexit deal and would likely rebel if it is rejected. (Newswires) However, UK government sources indicated that they have no intention of backing MP Grieve&#39;s amendment to try to buy off rebels over the meaningful vote.

The DXY remains supported around 93.500, but off highs just shy of 93.900 as attention shifts to US CPI ahead of the Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - A marginal outperformer going in to the latest UK labour/wage data, which was somewhat mixed in the event, and only prompted a knee-jerk retreat in the Pound as the spotlight switches back to the Brexit vote amid reports that PM May has quelled a faction of Tory rebels. Cable currently holding close to 1.3400 and Eur/Gbp pivoting 0.8800 even though the single currency is firmer overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CHF/EUR/AUD - All modestly firmer vs the Greenback with the Kiwi consolidating above 0.7000 and Franc still rangebound either side of 0.9850, while Eur/Usd is retesting offers and resistance at 1.1800 just above its 100 HMA (1.1786) and a band of option expiries from 1.1775-90 in 1.5 bn. Note, disappointing ZEW sentiment indicators sapped some of the single currency&rsquo;s pre-ECB momentum. Aud/Usd has recovered 0.7600+ status after a dip on mixed Aussie data overnight (housing loans not as weak as forecast, but business sentiment and conditions both declined).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD - The G10 laggards once again, with Usd/Jpy up through its 200 DMA (110.21) to test offers at 110.50 and Eur/Jpy absorbing residual supply at 130.00 to trip some 130.25 stops in wake of the Summit, while the Loonie is still smarting from the G7 squabble between Trump and Trudeau and just holding off 1.3000+ lows vs its US rival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK - A reversal of fortunes as Eur/Nok declines from Monday&rsquo;s 9.5000+ peaks to sub-9.4500 on the back of an upbeat Norges Bank regional network survey after softer than anticipated inflation data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further choppy price action in bonds, with Bunds and Gilts both extending losses amidst more upbeat/rousing headlines following the landmark US-NK summit, which for now are overshadowing less positive factors, like heightened US-Iran/Russia tensions and Brexit vote risk in wake of the UK Justice Minister&rsquo;s resignation. Fresh Eurex and Liffe lows were registered ahead of the UK data, at 159.37 (-37 ticks) and 121.33 (-35 ticks) respectively, but the 10 year debt futures have recovered some lost ground with the former possibly acknowledging a weak ZEW survey and latter softer than expected wages. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are relatively side-lined and very flat awaiting CPI data and the long bond auction before the countdown to Wednesday&rsquo;s Fed event begins in earnest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil unable to hold onto initial gains resulting from softer USD coming from the historic US-North Korean summit. WTI currently trading above the USD 66.00 handle, and Brent trading above the USD 76.00 level, with the fossil fuel flat on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, Gold is also seeing some follow through from an improved risk tone, with the yellow metal down 0.2% on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steel is positive after two sessions in the red as price increases in large Chinese firms has offered support to the metal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copper has shed losses earlier in the day and is now up on the day as the metal is benefiting from the improved risk tone.</p>\r\n",

The underperforming bourse is currently the FTSE (-0.2%) as a stronger GBP is pressuring the index amid reports that UK PM May has struck a compromise with Conservative rebels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carrefour (+2.5%) is up on the news that Google will begin to sell their products online in France through their platforms. This is offering support to the consumer staples sector, which is the current sector outperformer (+0.44%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Casino (+6%) is leading the gains in Europe after the co. announced an asset sale plan in order to reduce debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daimler has recalled 238,000 vehicles in Germany due to illegal emission device concerns; a total of 774,000 vehicles are affected in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index and Usd in general has drifted back from peaks seen in wake of the Trump-Kim meeting that climaxed in an historic signing of significant documents to herald a new dawn and more concerted pledge to work towards peace via denuclearisation. The DXY remains supported around 93.500, but off highs just shy of 93.900 as attention shifts to US CPI ahead of the Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - A marginal outperformer going in to the latest UK labour/wage data, which was somewhat mixed in the event, and only prompted a knee-jerk retreat in the Pound as the spotlight switches back to the Brexit vote amid reports that PM May has quelled a faction of Tory rebels. Cable currently holding close to 1.3400 and Eur/Gbp pivoting 0.8800 even though the single currency is firmer overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CHF/EUR/AUD - All modestly firmer vs the Greenback with the Kiwi consolidating above 0.7000 and Franc still rangebound either side of 0.9850, while Eur/Usd is retesting offers and resistance at 1.1800 just above its 100 HMA (1.1786) and a band of option expiries from 1.1775-90 in 1.5 bn. Note, disappointing ZEW sentiment indicators sapped some of the single currency&rsquo;s pre-ECB momentum. Aud/Usd has recovered 0.7600+ status after a dip on mixed Aussie data overnight (housing loans not as weak as forecast, but business sentiment and conditions both declined).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD - The G10 laggards once again, with Usd/Jpy up through its 200 DMA (110.21) to test offers at 110.50 and Eur/Jpy absorbing residual supply at 130.00 to trip some 130.25 stops in wake of the Summit, while the Loonie is still smarting from the G7 squabble between Trump and Trudeau and just holding off 1.3000+ lows vs its US rival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK - A reversal of fortunes as Eur/Nok declines from Monday&rsquo;s 9.5000+ peaks to sub-9.4500 on the back of an upbeat Norges Bank regional network survey after softer than anticipated inflation data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further choppy price action in bonds, with Bunds and Gilts both extending losses amidst more upbeat/rousing headlines following the landmark US-NK summit, which for now are overshadowing less positive factors, like heightened US-Iran/Russia tensions and Brexit vote risk in wake of the UK Justice Minister&rsquo;s resignation. Fresh Eurex and Liffe lows were registered ahead of the UK data, at 159.37 (-37 ticks) and 121.33 (-35 ticks) respectively, but the 10 year debt futures have recovered some lost ground with the former possibly acknowledging a weak ZEW survey and latter softer than expected wages. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are relatively side-lined and very flat awaiting CPI data and the long bond auction before the countdown to Wednesday&rsquo;s Fed event begins in earnest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil unable to hold onto initial gains resulting from softer USD coming from the historic US-North Korean summit. WTI currently trading above the USD 66.00 handle, and Brent trading above the USD 76.00 level, with the fossil fuel flat on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, Gold is also seeing some follow through from an improved risk tone, with the yellow metal down 0.2% on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steel is positive after two sessions in the red as price increases in large Chinese firms has offered support to the metal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copper has shed losses earlier in the day and is now up on the day as the metal is benefiting from the improved risk tone.</p>\r\n",

The meeting between the 2 leaders was seen as amicable in which the leaders shook hands several times and exchanged pleasantries, although the initial face-to-face was somewhat less awe-inspiring than that of the inter-Korean summit in April. In addition, after one-on-one discussions Trump suggested a &lsquo;very very good, good relationship&rsquo; and Kim stated there will be challenges ahead but will work with US President Trump, although reports also noted that Kim refrained from answering questions on denuclearisation. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were positive with early outperformance seen in Japan amid a weaker currency, although some of the gains were pared due to pessimism that a swift agreement could be reached for the Korean peninsula. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) have swung between gains and losses alongside a broad tentative tone across the region and after a tepid liquidity effort by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued amid a lack of conviction in the region and with an enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds largely ignored, which showed slight decline in the bid to cover and tighter accepted spreads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FTSE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sky (SKY LN) - Comcast (CMCSA) will formalize its all-cash bid for Twenty-First Century Fox&rsquo;s (FOXA) assets on Wednesday if AT&amp;T&#39;s (T) bid for Time Warner (TWX) is approved today, sources tell CNBC.

The meeting between the 2 leaders was seen as amicable in which the leaders shook hands several times and exchanged pleasantries, although the initial face-to-face was somewhat less awe-inspiring than that of the inter-Korean summit in April. In addition, after one-on-one discussions Trump suggested a &lsquo;very very good, good relationship&rsquo; and Kim stated there will be challenges ahead but will work with US President Trump, although reports also noted that Kim refrained from answering questions on denuclearisation. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were positive with early outperformance seen in Japan amid a weaker currency, although some of the gains were pared due to pessimism that a swift agreement could be reached for the Korean peninsula. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) have swung between gains and losses alongside a broad tentative tone across the region and after a tepid liquidity effort by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued amid a lack of conviction in the region and with an enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds largely ignored, which showed slight decline in the bid to cover and tighter accepted spreads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 7-day reverse repos, CNY 20bln via 14-day reverse repos and CNY 30bln via 28-day reverse repos, for a net daily injection of CNY 30bln.

Furthermore, UK Brexit Secretary Davis is said to back deal to buy-off Tory rebels on both wings of the party ahead of the EU Withdrawal Bill vote in the UK&#39;s lower house. UK solicitor general Baker that the government is discussing with lawmakers the replacement of an Upper House amendment on EU&#39;s customs union and that it is appropriate to have a customs arrangement with the EU.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX trade was indecisive with most majors choppy throughout the session as all focus was on the historical event in Singapore. Nonetheless, the DXY slightly firmed with USD supported prior to the summit, although the reaction to the actual meeting between the leaders was anticlimactic. Likewise, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses initially extended on gains before petering out, while AUD was also temperamental alongside mixed Home Loans and Business Survey data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Home Loans (Apr) M/M -1.4% vs. Exp. -1.8% (Prev. -2.2%).

As such, WTI crude futures were relatively flat with prices holding above the USD 66.00/bbl and copper was sideways amid a tentative risk tone on overnight trade. Meanwhile, gold was subdued with the precious metal below the USD 1300 level amid a firmer greenback and with participants also awaiting a widely expected rate hike by the Fed on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraq oil minister said to expect &#39;a tough but not very tough&#39; OPEC meeting on June 22nd, while he added that Iraq will decide to boost output if there is consensus among other members. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Treasury yields were higher on Monday ahead of the FOMC&rsquo;s policy meeting on Wednesday, where a 25bps is priced with virtual certainty. The complex was helped by continuing deflating of the political risk premium in Europe, analysts said, where over the weekend, the Italian finance minister said that the country has no intention of leaving the Euro area, helping the Bund/BTP spread to narrow. The US Treasury auctioned $32bln in 3yr notes, tailing by 0.1, and saw the same high yield as May&rsquo;s auctions. Indirect participation was strong, taking down the largest share since January. Directs participation was below recent averages, while dealer take down was slightly above recent averages. The 10yr note auction stopped-through the screens by 0.3bps with cover the highest since January. Indirect participation was, however, well below the six month average, seeing direct participation almost double versus the previous month, though dealer participation was in line with recent averages. US 10YR T-notes futures (Sep 2018) at 5 ticks lower at 119-14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that White House economic adviser Kudlow suffered a heart attack and is at Walter Reed Medical Center.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade with modest gains following a similar performance on Wall St. and with focus fully centred on the historical summit between US President Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un. The meeting between the 2 leaders was seen as amicable in which the leaders shook hands several times and exchanged pleasantries, although was somewhat less awe-inspiring than the inter-Korean summit in April. In addition, after one-on-one discussions Trump suggested a &lsquo;very very good, good relationship&rsquo; and Kim stated there will be challenges ahead but will work with US President Trump, although reports also noted that Kim refrained from answering questions on denuclearisation. ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) are positive with early outperformance seen in Japan amid a weaker currency, although this was gradually pared alongside currency moves and pessimism that a swift agreement could be reached for the Korean peninsula. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) have swung between gains and losses alongside a broad tentative tone across the region and after a tepid liquidity effort by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX trade was as indecisive as the overnight risk tone with most majors choppy throughout the session as all focus was on the historical event in Singapore. Nonetheless, the DXY is slightly firmer with USD getting a bid prior to the summit, although the reaction to the actual meeting between the leaders was anticlimactic. Likewise, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses initially extended on gains before petering out, while AUD was also temperamental alongside mixed Home Loans and Business Survey data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued amid an indecisive risk tone and with participants side-lined ahead of an enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds.</p>\r\n",
