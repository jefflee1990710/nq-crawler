        "content": "<p>USD sold for 2nd straight week amid broad buying interest in commodity blocCAD was the most bought G10 FX despite outflows on Thursday and Friday coinciding with CPI data, as NAFTA fears eased somewhat earlier in the week. SEK saw heavy inflows despite a quiet week data-wise, seeing significant inflows around Riksbank Deputy Gov. Ohlsson&#39;s speech on Monday. GBP was bought as a hawkish MPC and news of a transitional Brexit deal might have provided some short-term support to sterling. NOK and CHF were bid as JPY saw marginal inflows, with peak buying interest corresponding to CPI release on Thursday. NZD was more or less flat on the week. USD was most sold, seeing a straight second week of outflows, as the market was seemingly set up for a more hawkish Fed outcome. AUD experienced its 9th week of outflows and was the only commodity currency sold as EUR was sold for the first time in four weeks. In EM, SGD and ZAR saw significant inflows as PLN was most sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"535\" src=\"/system/ckeditor_assets/pictures/24/content_Capture.JPG\" width=\"800\" /></p>\r\n",

Some had noted that crude was stable despite risk going through phases of risk-on/risk-off throughout the session; some have explained this with reference to rising tensions in the Middle East &ndash; as seen on over the weekend, when Houthi rebels resumed firing missiles at Saudi Arabia; there were also a batch of positive OPEC+ jawboning (Russia&rsquo;s energy minister Novak said it was too early to consider exiting the supply cut deal, and any exit would have to be gradual); additionally, news that Venezuela&rsquo;s PDVSA was to shut three out of four refineries indefinitely (due to lack of staff as well as sweeter crude blends).

Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry also issued a warning about more reprisals in coming days and was particularly scathing about the US after earlier more conciliatory developments on the trade and protectionism front with regard to China. Hence, the Dollar remains a broad loser vs G10 majors aside from the Jpy that bounced just ahead of reportedly big bidding interest at 104.50 and stops below to trade at 105.25, but eying decent option expiry at 105.00 at Monday&rsquo;s NY cut and for tomorrow (1.2 bn and 1.3 bn respectively). Conversely, the Eur eventually cleared 1.2400 vs the Greenback to get within a handful of pips from nearest/strong upside resistance around 1.2446 (earlier March peak), while Cable faded above 1.4200 and Usd/Cad could not sustain sub-1.2850 territory and rebounded over 1.2900 again. The Kiwi just retained top spot vs the Usd and almost reclaimed 0.7300 status on the back of forecast-beating NZ trade data overnight, with Aud/Usd getting equally close to 0.7750 at one stage. Usd/Rub rallied on the aforementioned rise in tensions over the UK nerve gas attack, to a circa 57.2537 high and bucked the wider trend of EM gains vs the Usd on less global trade angst (relatively speaking). &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

(Newswires/WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>China Ambassador to US stated China is looking into all options in response to US tariffs including lowering Treasury purchases</strong>, while the Ambassador reiterated China doesn&#39;t want a trade war but is ready to respond if situation escalates. In addition, there were separate comments from former Vice Commerce Minister Wei that China may look at adding tariffs on airplanes and computer chips from US. (Newswires/China Daily)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent reports, <strong>China is to finalise rules on greater foreign ownership of securities firms by May as part of efforts in the trade negotiations with US and has offered to purchase more semiconductors from the US, diverting purchases from South Korea. (FT) </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korea Trade Ministry said agreed in principle with US on a revised FTA and that US agreed to exempt South Korea from steel tariffs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA-PACIFIC </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian stocks began the week mostly negative as trade concerns remained at the forefront of market focus and following last week&rsquo;s losses on Wall St where stocks posted their worst weekly performance in over 2 years and the DJIA slipped into correction territory. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.5%)</strong> was negative with the index led lower by its largest-weighted financials sector after the harsher losses seen in its US counterparts, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.6%)</strong> fell to a near 6-month low, before staging a late rally back into positive territory. Elsewhere, <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%)</strong> was weighed by trade tensions and rising Chinese money market rates (HKD 12-month HIBOR at 9-year high), while <strong>KOSPI (+0.8%) </strong>bucked the trend after news that US and South Korea agreed in principal to a revised FTA and with South Korea to be exempted from US tariffs. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued as prices failed to benefit from a risk-averse tone with demand dampened amid a lack of Rinban announcement by the BoJ, while a tier-1 US firm was said to be cautious on 2yr JGBs amid expectations for an increase in auction supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net drain of CNY 70bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3196 (Prev. 6.3272)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former head of education institute reportedly confirmed PM Abe&#39;s wife was involved in land sale, according to reports citing opposition lawmakers who conducted an interview with the former institute head.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&rsquo;s Rosengren (non-voter, hawkish)</strong> said S&amp;P500 index valuations are historically high and that commercial real estate valuations are quite stretched. Furthermore, Rosengren added that US has limited policy to handle shocks and that Fed should bolster its existing financial stability tools. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;S Weidmann says market expectations for mid-2019 rate hike &lsquo;are not completely unrealistic&rsquo;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank&#39;s Skingsley states that markets could see rate hikes in H2 2018. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Northern League&rsquo;s leader Salvini and 5-Star Movement&#39;s chairman Di Maio are to discuss a potential plan for the Italian government (Il Messaggero)<em>. Note, that given the potential for an anti-establishment/populist government, this outcome has previously been touted as a &#39;market negative&#39;.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are higher across the board (Eurostoxx +0.3%) with the exception of the FTSE MIB (-0.3%), shrugging off the negative sentiment on Wall Street and Asia dictated by looming trade disputes between China and the US. Sectors are making broad gains, healthcare is outperforming after a positive drug update from Roche (+1.6%) and energy is underpinned despite slightly softer oil prices. In terms of individual movers, Fresnillo (+5.5%) is the outperformer in the FTSE100 after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs whereas Smurfit Kappa (-4.3%) is the laggard following its refusal of the takeover offer from International Paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nzd/Usd nudging back up towards the 0.7300 level on a surprise NZ trade surplus and broader uptick in risk sentiment overnight as global trade war fears wane somewhat, with market contacts also reporting some decent buy orders in Nzd/Jpy as Usd/Jpy bounces off new recent lows not far off 104.50 to just over 105.00. Note, however, the headline pair has been capped amidst hefty option expiry interest at the big figure today and on Tuesday (around 2.5 bn in total). Aud/Usd is back above 0.7700 and approaching 0.7750 despite a couple of short trades of the week via crosses (vs Jpy and Cad), while Cable has breached the 1.4200 level on a mixture of hawkish BoE impulses and Brexit transition deal optimism. On that note, contacts also note some stop-sales in Eur/Gbp from circa 0.8730 to 0.8723, which is the low of the range up to 0.8743. Nevertheless, Eur/Usd remains firm and has popped above 1.2400 on extended gains from trend-line support (1.2349) and its 30 DMA (1.2337). Usd/Cad looking at bids near and under 1.2850 amidst a broadly soft Greenback as the DXY remains sub-89.500 and trade/protectionism concerns continue to weigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have seen a bit more downside in recent trade, to 158.59 (-28 ticks), and through interim support on some charts (158.73-70) to expose last Friday&rsquo;s Eurex intraday low at 158.55 where stops are expected to target the 158.35-30 zone. Gilts are holding just above their Liffe low so far, but US Treasuries are succumbing to more selling pressure and deeper bear-steepening on an overall improvement in risk sentiment. Note also, reports that China may use fx reserves as another weapon to combat US trade tariffs via reduced UST holdings are undermining the complex ahead of hefty supply this week. However, Spanish bonds continue to bask in the afterglow of S&amp;P&rsquo;s ratings upgrade for the sovereign from BBB+ to A-, while Italian BTPs remain on the defensive ahead of auctions and amidst latest moves to form a coalition Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodity complex, oil futures are modestly lower, albeit remaining in close proximity to recent highs, as price action is centred around China with WTI crude futures failing to hold above USD 66/bbl with demand sapped as the debut of CNY-denominated oil futures contracts stole the limelight and rose 6% in early trade. In the metals bloc, gold is range-bound at around 5-week highs as a subdued greenback and risk-averse tone kept the safe-haven afloat, while copper weakened alongside losses in Chinese metals prices in which Shanghai Rebar dropped to its lowest since July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>European equities are higher across the board (Eurostoxx +0.3%) with the exception of the FTSE MIB (-0.2%), shrugging off the negative sentiment on Wall Street and Asia dictated by looming trade disputes between China and the US. Sectors are making broad gains, healthcare is outperforming after a positive drug update from Roche (+1.5%) and energy is underpinned despite slightly softer oil prices. In terms of individual movers, Fresnillo (+3.6%) is the outperformer in the FTSE100 after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs whereas Smurfit Kappa (-3.0%) is the laggard following its refusal of the takeover offer from International Paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nzd/Usd nudging back up towards the 0.7300 level on a surprise NZ trade surplus and broader uptick in risk sentiment overnight as global trade war fears wane somewhat, with market contacts also reporting some decent buy orders in Nzd/Jpy as Usd/Jpy bounces off new recent lows not far off 104.50 to just over 105.00. Note, however, the headline pair has been capped amidst hefty option expiry interest at the big figure today and on Tuesday (around 2.5 bn in total). Aud/Usd is back above 0.7700 despite a couple of short trades of the week via crosses (vs Jpy and Cad), while Cable looks primed to test the 1.4200 level on a mixture of hawkish BoE impulses and Brexit transition deal optimism. On that note, contacts also note some stop-sales in Eur/Gbp from circa 0.8730 to 0.8723, which is the low of the range up to 0.8743. Nevertheless, Eur/Usd remains firm and challenging 1.2400 on gains above trend-line support (1.2349) and its 30 DMA (1.2337). Usd/Cad looking at bids near 1.2850 amidst a broadly soft Greenback as the DXY remains sub-89.500 and trade/protectionism concerns continue to weigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have seen a bit more downside in recent trade, to 158.64 (-23 ticks), and through interim support on some charts (158.73-70) to expose last Friday&rsquo;s Eurex intraday low at 158.55 where stops are expected to target the 158.35-30 zone. Gilts are holding just above their Liffe low so far, but US Treasuries are succumbing to more selling pressure and deeper bear-steepening on an overall improvement in risk sentiment. Note also, reports that China may use fx reserves as another weapon to combat US trade tariffs via reduced UST holdings are undermining the complex ahead of hefty supply this week. However, Spanish bonds continue to bask in the afterglow of S&amp;P&rsquo;s ratings upgrade for the sovereign from BBB+ to A-, while Italian BTPs remain on the defensive ahead of auctions and amidst latest moves to form a coalition Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodity complex, oil futures are modestly lower, albeit remaining in close proximity to recent highs, as price action is centred around China with WTI crude futures failing to hold above USD 66/bbl with demand sapped as the debut of CNY-denominated oil futures contracts stole the limelight and rose 6% in early trade. In the metals bloc, gold is range-bound at around 5-week highs as a subdued greenback and risk-averse tone kept the safe-haven afloat, while copper weakened alongside losses in Chinese metals prices in which Shanghai Rebar dropped to its lowest since July.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.6%) was negative with the index led lower by its largest-weighted financials sector after the harsher losses seen in its US counterparts, while Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) fell to a near 6-month low. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-1.6%) and Hang Seng (-0.4%) was weighed by trade tensions and rising Chinese money market rates (HKD 12-month HIBOR at 9-year high), while KOSPI (+0.3%) bucked the trend after news that US and South Korea agreed in principal to a revised FTA and with South Korea to be exempted from US tariffs. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued as prices failed to benefit from a risk-averse tone with demand dampened amid a lack of Rinban announcement by the BoJ, while a tier-1 US firm was said to be cautious on 2yr JGBs amid expectations for an increase in auction supply.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks begin the week mostly negative as trade concerns remain at the forefront of market focus and following last week&rsquo;s losses on Wall St where stocks posted their worst weekly performance in over 2 years and the DJIA slipped into correction territory. ASX 200 (-0.7%) is negative with the index led lower by its largest-weighted financials sector after the harsher losses seen in its US counterparts, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) is also weaker with the index at a near 6-month low. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.4%) continued to be weighed by trade tensions, while KOSPI (+0.2%) bucks the trend after news that US and South Korea agreed in principal to a revised FTA and with South Korea to be exempted from US tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action has been relatively mundane amid a lack of data releases and with the DXY quietly languishing below the 90.00 level. This has helped the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts with marginal gains seen in EUR/USD and GBP/USD, while commodity linked currencies outperform after AUD/USD found support around 0.7700 and with NZD/USD briefly supported in the wake of an unexpected trade surplus. Elsewhere, JPY pared back some of its recent strength amid cross-related flows which saw USD/JPY attempt a reclaim of the 105.00 handle, while HKD continues to weaken and is just 15 pips shy of the lower end of the trading band against USD which would trigger HKMA intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued as prices fail to benefit from a risk-averse tone with demand dampened amid a lack of Rinban announcement by the BoJ, while a tier-1 US firm was said to be cautious on 2yr JGBs amid expectations for an increase in auction supply. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
