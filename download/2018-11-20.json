There were also comments from DUP&#39;s Wilson that they will vote against PM May&#39;s deal and that their recent vote abstention was a warning shot (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Officials close to Brexiters in Cabinet (the famous five) said they are &quot;feeling very positive&quot; after PM promised to explore &ldquo;technological&rdquo; solutions to maintain a soft border in Ireland in place of a backstop according to FT political correspondent.&nbsp; (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Saunders (Hawk) said it seems likely that economic growth in Q4 and maybe Q1 2019 will slow from the strong gain in Q3.

Elsewhere, the confidence vote is now likely on hold until after the Parliament&rsquo;s vote in December since only 27 letters were officially submitted by Brexiteers, an insufficient number to trigger a leadership challenge against PM May; some have been suggesting that the &#39;decision&#39; not to reach the 48 threshold level is &#39;tactical&#39; to gain leverage over the PM&rsquo;s position while there were rumours that two meaningful Brexit votes could take place in the House of Commons, with the final one in January. In related comments, a spokesperson for UK PM May reported that there is no change to the government&rsquo;s position that a no-deal is better than a bad deal whilst stating that EU&#39;s Juncker and PM May are not expected to shake hands on a finalised version of the future framework at their meeting on Wednesday. Irish Foreign Minister Coveney highlighted that the withdrawal agreement isn&#39;t a draft text, but rather a final version noting that the consensus was the text wouldn&#39;t be changed after Spain/Gibraltar concerns; he added that UK PM May is to discuss the wording of the future relationship document with Juncker tomorrow and that it will take at least 2 to 3 years to negotiate. Later tonight the Cabinet voted on a separate finance bill where the DUP has withdrawn support for the Finance bill meaning that the government are accepting Labour and SNP amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> White House Economic Advisor Kudlow reported that US President Trump has an optimistic view on US-China talks, adding that very detailed discussions are ongoing with China at all levels while he believes China would like to have a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> Optimism emerged over a budget agreement with the EU as Deputy PM Di Maio stated that a budget solution can be found in open dialogue with the EU without getting rid of its main measures. Eurogroup Head Mario Centeno nonetheless noted that &ldquo;the revised budget plan did not improve the situation in terms of debt funding costs, it did not dispel concerns regarding the Italian budget strategy&rdquo; with the decision now turning to the EU Commission. ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny said that Italy has no threat in the short term to the Euro system, but on the long term it has significant refinancing needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Dove, Non-voter) said that the Fed should pause rate hikes to see how the economy evolves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Weidmann (Hawk) said that policy normalisation will take several years and added ending QE is only first step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>BoC&#39;s Wilkins announced that central bank will review monetary policy framework in the run up to late 2021, indicating it is open to major changes. On inflation, she noted that targeting has worked well but after the 2008 crisis it showed imperfections adding it is time to thoroughly review alternatives. She highlighted that raising inflation level to 3% or 4% would hit people living on fixed incomes and could hit bank&#39;s credibility. She then stated that the review will take into account the fact that neutral interest rate is lower than before, which reduces conventional policy firepower in case of a downturn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BUILDING PERMITS</strong> posted a 0.6% drop, reversing the 1.5% gain seen in September. Single-family permits sent the figure lower reinforced by the fact that building activity pulled back sharply entering the winter season. Wells Fargo expects single-house activity to lag behind and keep losing momentum also amid affordability concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* HOUSING STARTS</strong> rose 1.5% in October, rebounding modestly from a 5.6% drop in September. The gains were attributed to the multi-family component, which was up 10.3%, while single-family starts fell by 1.8%. Wells Fargo expects strength in multi-family to continue offsetting weakness in single-family; looking ahead they note that &ldquo;with demand remaining strong, we could see a bit more strength in apartment starts in coming months, even as single-family starts continue to drop&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -1.82% at 2642, NDX -1.75% at 6527, DJI -2.21% at 24466. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -3.30%, Materials -1.86%, Industrials -2.11%, Cons Discretionary -2.18%, Cons Staples -1.70%, Healthcare -0.98%, Financials -2.09%, Tech -2.15%, Telecoms -1.26%, Utilities -0.51%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Agilent Technologies (A) was a top mover following strong earnings and a share repurchase programme. Campbell Soup (S), Best Buy (BBY) and Medtronic (MDT) made gains after beating EPS and revenue estimates. NVIDIA (NVDA) pared back some of yesterday&rsquo;s losses, helped by Citron research turning positive on the stock. Apple (AAPL) helped pull down tech stocks today after further order cuts to its suppliers and a price target cut at Goldman. Boeing (BA) traded lower following a cancellation of a conference call to airlines in regard to 737 MAX jets. L Brands (LB) was a bottom mover after cutting its FY dividend. Target (TGT) disappointed investors when it missed its EPS estimates. TJX Companies (TJX) was a bottom mover on the back of lowering guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 3.77 LOWER AT USD 53.43/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 4.26 LOWER AT USD 62.53/BBL. </strong>Crude prices fell throughout the day as market sentiment soured and US-Saudi relations strengthened. US President Trump said the US will remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia, ensuring interests of the US, Israel and regional partners; oil slumped on these comments. In news flow IEA&rsquo;s Birol said Iranian exports are down by close to 1mln BPD from summer peak; adding that US sanctions have provided relief to oil markets. Activity has been halted at Venezuela&#39;s 645,000 BPD Amuay refinery due to a technical failure. Venezuelan Jose terminal&#39;s South dock reopened after 90 days of closure. In later comments, US President Trump said he would like to see oil prices lower adding that Saudi Arabia has helped oil prices down. This week&rsquo;s crude inventories are expected to +2.9mln barrels, distillate -2.8mln barrels, gasoline -0.2mln, cushing -72k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES TICKS 1+ HIGHER AT 119-11</strong>.The treasury complex ended Tuesday&rsquo;s session mixed; the complex remained bid once again for most of the trading day on a fly to safety as equities extended their sell-off. Some of those gains were pared back as investors closed their positions ahead of Thanksgiving on Thursday when the bond market will remain close. Most of the action was in the front end of the curve were yields were higher&nbsp; by c.2bps at settlement. 2s10 and 2s30s were narrower by c.2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD:</strong> The Greenback has extended recovery gains after the DXY averted a test of 96.000 by a whisker in early EU trade, as risk aversion spreads from global stocks through the commodity complex and across to the usual suspects in currency markets, ie the high beta units and EMs of course. The index has rebounded over 96.500, as all Dollar/G10 pairings bar Usd/JPY and Usd/CHF retrace relatively sharply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CAD: </strong>The Aud has pulled back further from recent 0.7300+ peaks in wake of RBA minutes overnight underscoring an on hold policy stance, and with ensuing rhetoric from Governor Lowe suggesting the labour market can tighten considerable more without generating upward pressure on wages and expressing concern about a credit shortage adding further weight. Meanwhile, the Loonie has been undermined by a snap-back in crude prices alongside the broader Usd revival and has retreated to fresh recent lows below 1.3250, before BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins comments which sent the currency pair above 1.3300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The next worst major amidst ongoing Italian-EU deficit divisions, with the single currency losing grip of the 1.1400 handle ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s official declaration from Brussels on the &lsquo;revised&rsquo; 2019 budget draft, while Eur/Chf has recoiled towards 1.1300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD:&nbsp;</strong>The Kiwi has gradually eroded positive overnight momentum gleaned from bullish milk collections data to hover just above 0.6800 and stops said to be lurking on a break of 0.6790, while the Aud/Nzd cross has bounced back over 1.0600 after failing to clearly breach the big figure earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>The Pound is holding up relatively well amidst the heightened risk aversion, with Cable keeping its head above 1.2800 for most of the session and losing grip after the DUP withdraw support once again for the finance bill in Cabinet and Eur/Gbp capped at 0.8900, largely on latest Brexit impulses and reports that UK PM May has received the green light from EU negotiators to put forward technical proposals to the Irish back-stop in order to remove that clause from the draft withdrawal agreement and garner more support for the Brexit &lsquo;deal&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, SEK:</strong> Compounding the broad deterioration in risk appetite, sliding oil, technical, cross-flows rattled the Nok and Sek by contagion or indirectly with Eur/Nok flying through 9.7600 at one stage and Eur/Sek rebounding further from recent lows to 10.3400+ before easing back again.</p>\r\n",

The index has rebounded over 96.500, as all Dollar/G10 pairings bar Usd/JPY and Usd/CHF retrace relatively sharply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aud has pulled back further from recent 0.7300+ peaks in wake of RBA minutes overnight underscoring an on hold policy stance, and with ensuing rhetoric from Governor Lowe suggesting the labour market can tighten considerable more without generating upward pressure on wages and expressing concern about a credit shortage adding further weight. Meanwhile, the Loonie has been undermined by a snap-back in crude prices alongside the broader Usd revival and has retreated to fresh recent lows below 1.3250, as attention turns to scheduled speeches from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins and Lane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next worst major amidst ongoing Italian-EU deficit divisions, with the single currency losing grip of the 1.1400 handle ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s official declaration from Brussels on the &lsquo;revised&rsquo; 2019 budget draft, while Eur/Chf has recoiled towards 1.1300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi has gradually eroded positive overnight momentum gleaned from bullish milk collections data to hover just above 0.6800 and stops said to be lurking on a break of 0.6790, while the Aud/Nzd cross has bounced back over 1.0600 after failing to clearly breach the big figure earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound is holding up relatively well amidst the heightened risk aversion, with Cable keeping its head above 1.2800 and Eur/Gbp capped at 0.8900, largely on latest Brexit impulses and reports that UK PM May has received the green light from EU negotiators to put forward technical proposals to the Irish back-stop in order to remove that clause from the draft withdrawal agreement and garner more support for the Brexit &lsquo;deal&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compounding the broad deterioration in risk appetite, sliding oil, technical, cross-flows rattled the Nok and Sek by contagion or indirectly with Eur/Nok flying through 9.7600 at one stage and Eur/Sek rebounding further from recent lows to 10.3400+ before easing back again.</p>\r\n",

As such, the tech sector underperformed in the ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) was also pressured with Mitsubishi Motors and Nissan among the worst hit after their Chairman Ghosn was arrested on financial misconduct allegations.

(Washington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are largely in the red, with the SMI outperforming (+0.1%) which is being bolstered by Novartis (+1.0%) following their announcement of a joint digital treatment with Pear Therapeutics for substance abuse disorder. The DAX (-0.7%) is lagging its peers, weighed on by Wirecard (-5.0%) following a disappointing change to guidance forecasting as well as weak sentiment across IT names after the FAANG stocks entered bear market territory on Wall St. In particular, the Stoxx 600 Technology sector (-1.9%), dropped to its lowest level since Feb 2017. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank (-2.5%) are in the red due to reports that the Co processed payments for Danske Bank in Estonia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index remains technically prone to further downside pressure having closed below another Fib support level yesterday and testing the next bearish chart area around 96.050-10 ahead of 96.000 even. However, a more concerted bout of risk-off trade/positioning saved the DXY and broad Dollar from steeper declines as the tech-induced sell-off in stocks intensified, and jitters over Brexit alongside the Italian budget returned to the fore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is bucking the overall trend and outperforming in contrast to this time on Monday, with Nzd/Usd rebounding firmly to 0.6850+ levels and Aud/Nzd retreating through 1.0650 to just south of 1.0600 following overnight data showing a hefty 6.5% y/y rise in NZ milk collections for October. Conversely, the Aud/Usd has slipped back under 0.7300 again, and close to 0.7250 in wake of RBA minutes underscoring no rush to hike rates and subsequent affirmation of wait-and-see guidance from Governor Lowe. In fact, he asserts that the jobless rate could decline to 4.5% vs 5% at present without inducing wage inflation, while also underlining concerns about the supply of credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Both benefiting from their more intrinsic allure during periods of pronounced risk aversion and investor angst, as Usd/Jpy probes a bit deeper below 112.50 and a key Fib at 112.46 that could be pivotal on a closing basis with potential to expose daily chart support circa 112.16 ahead of 112.00. Meanwhile, the Franc has inched closer to 0.9900 and over 1.1350 vs the Eur that remains burdened with the aforementioned Italian fiscal concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR - Almost a case of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu for Sterling and the single currency as early attempts to the upside vs the Greenback saw Cable and Eur/Usd revisit recent peaks around 1.2880 and 1.1470 respectively, but a combination of chart resistance and bearish fundamentals forced both back down to circa 1.2825 and 1.1425. In terms of precise technical/psychological levels, 1.2897 and 1.1445 represent Fib retracements, ahead of 1.2900 and 1.1500, while the Pound has remained relatively unchanged and unresponsive to largely on the fence pending Brexit rhetoric from the BoE in testimony to the TSC on November&rsquo;s QIR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK - On top of broad risk-on/off impulses, oil prices and technical, cross-flows also impacting the Scandi crowns, like Aud/Nzd, amidst reports of a big unwind of a long position yesterday. However, some consolidation since as Eur/Nok holds around 9.7050 and Eur/Sek pivots 10.3100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie has maintained modest recovery gains vs its US counterparts from circa 1.3200 on Monday even though the rebound in crude has waned again, with potential for some independent impetus later tonight via comments from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins and/or Lane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has stayed within a USD 5/oz range and traded relatively flat throughout the session moving with the steady dollar ahead of US Thanksgiving. Similarly, copper traded lacklustre breaking a 5-day rally because of a subdued risk sentiment stemming from ongoing US-China trade tensions; with Shanghai rebar adversely affected from these factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.1%) and WTI (+0.2%) are mixed following a relatively quiet overnight session, while recent upticks in the complex resulted in WTI reclaiming the USD 57/bbl and Brent edging closer to USD 67/bbl. This follows comments from IEA Chief Birol that Iranian oil exports declined by almost 1mln BPD from summer peaks. Looking ahead, traders will be keeping the weekly API crude inventory data which is expected to print a build of 8.79mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CME raised nat gas futures margin to USD 4700 per contract from USD 3700. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IEA Chief Birol says Iranian exports are down by close to 1mln BPD from summer peak; and added that US sanctions have provided relief to oil markets, but the global economy is still very fragile. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some consolidation across the board, but notably Bunds and French OATs retain an underlying bid vs ongoing weakness/underperformance in BTPs (albeit considerably less pronounced) ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s EU judgement on the Italian budget that will now coincide with another Brexit event, as UK PM May is due to meet EC President Juncker. Meanwhile, Gilts have slipped back below parity and 123.00 and also lagging firmer/flatter US Treasuries amidst the ongoing pre-Thanksgiving holiday retreat in global equities and a non-committal stance from the BoE pending the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU and impact on the economy. Ahead, US housing data and T-bill auctions.</p>\r\n",

The DAX (-0.9%) is lagging its peers, weighed on by Wirecard (-7.5%) following a disappointing change to guidance forecasting as well as weak sentiment across IT names after the FAANG stocks entered bear market territory on Wall St. In particular, the Stoxx 600 Technology sector (-1.9%), dropped to its lowest level since Feb 2017. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank (-3.1%) are in the red due to reports that the Co processed payments for Danske Bank in Estonia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index remains technically prone to further downside pressure having closed below another Fib support level yesterday and testing the next bearish chart area around 96.050-10 ahead of 96.000 even. However, a more concerted bout of risk-off trade/positioning saved the DXY and broad Dollar from steeper declines as the tech-induced sell-off in stocks intensified, and jitters over Brexit alongside the Italian budget returned to the fore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is bucking the overall trend and outperforming in contrast to this time on Monday, with Nzd/Usd rebounding firmly to 0.6850+ levels and Aud/Nzd retreating through 1.0650 to just south of 1.0600 following overnight data showing a hefty 6.5% y/y rise in NZ milk collections for October. Conversely, the Aud/Usd has slipped back under 0.7300 again, and close to 0.7250 in wake of RBA minutes underscoring no rush to hike rates and subsequent affirmation of wait-and-see guidance from Governor Lowe. In fact, he asserts that the jobless rate could decline to 4.5% vs 5% at present without&nbsp;inducing wage inflation, while also underlining concerns about the supply of credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Both benefiting from their more intrinsic allure during periods of pronounced risk aversion and investor angst, as Usd/Jpy probes a bit deeper below 112.50 and a key Fib at 112.46 that could be pivotal on a closing basis with potential to expose daily chart support circa 112.16 ahead of 112.00. Meanwhile, the Franc has inched closer to 0.9900 and over 1.1350 vs the Eur that remains burdened with the aforementioned Italian fiscal concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR - Almost a case of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu for Sterling and the single currency as early attempts to the upside vs the Greenback saw Cable and Eur/Usd revisit recent peaks around 1.2880 and 1.1470 respectively, but a combination of chart resistance and bearish fundamentals forced both back down to circa 1.2825 and 1.1425. In terms of precise technical/psychological levels, 1.2897 and 1.1445 represent Fib retracements, ahead of 1.2900 and 1.1500, while the Pound has remained relatively unchanged and unresponsive to largely on the fence pending Brexit rhetoric from the BoE in testimony to the TSC on November&rsquo;s QIR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK - On top of broad risk-on/off impulses, oil prices and technical, cross-flows also impacting the Scandi crowns, like Aud/Nzd, amidst reports of a big unwind of a long position yesterday. However, some consolidation since as Eur/Nok holds around 9.7050 and Eur/Sek pivots 10.3100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie has maintained modest recovery gains vs its US counterparts from circa 1.3200 on Monday even though the rebound in crude has waned again, with potential for some independent impetus later tonight via comments from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins and/or Lane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some consolidation across the board, but notably Bunds and French OATs retain an underlying bid vs ongoing weakness/underperformance in BTPs (albeit considerably less pronounced) ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s EU judgement on the Italian budget that will now coincide with another Brexit event, as UK PM May is due to meet EC President Juncker. Meanwhile, Gilts have slipped back below parity and 123.00 and also lagging firmer/flatter US Treasuries amidst the ongoing pre-Thanksgiving holiday retreat in global equities and a non-committal stance from the BoE pending the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU and impact on the economy. Ahead, US housing data and T-bill auctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has stayed within a USD 5/oz range and traded relatively flat throughout the session moving with the steady dollar ahead of US Thanksgiving. Similarly, copper traded lacklustre breaking a 5-day rally because of a subdued risk sentiment stemming from ongoing US-China trade tensions; with Shanghai rebar adversely affected from these factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.6%) and WTI (-0.1%) are down as a result of growing trade and growth concerns, after a relatively quiet overnight session, following comments from IEA&rsquo;s Birol that oil markets are entering a period of uncertainty due to global instability. Looking ahead, traders will be keeping the weekly API crude inventory data which is expected to print a build of 8.79mln barrels.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index remains technically prone to further downside pressure having closed below another Fib support level yesterday, and testing the next bearish chart area around 96.050-10 ahead of 96.000 even. However, a more concerted bout of risk-off trade/positioning saved the DXY and broad Dollar from steeper declines as the tech-induced sell-off in stocks intensified, and jitters over Brexit alongside the Italian budget returned to the fore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is bucking the overall trend and outperforming in contrast to this time on Monday, with Nzd/Usd rebounding firmly to 0.6850+ levels and Aud/Nzd retreating through 1.0650 to just south of 1.0600 following overnight data showing a hefty 6.5% y/y rise in NZ milk collections for October. Conversely, the Aud/Usd has slipped back under 0.7300 again, and close to 0.7250 in wake of RBA minutes underscoring no rush to hike rates and subsequent affirmation of wait-and-see guidance from Governor Lowe. In fact, he asserts that the jobless rate could decline to 4.5% vs 5% at present without inducing wage inflation, while also underlining concerns about the supply of credit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both benefiting from their more intrinsic allure during periods of pronounced risk aversion and investor angst, as Usd/Jpy probes a bit deeper below 112.50 and a key Fib at 112.46 that could be pivotal on a closing basis with potential to expose daily chart support circa 112.16 ahead of 112.00. Meanwhile, the Franc has inched closer to 0.9900 and over 1.1350 vs the Eur that remains burdened with the aforementioned Italian fiscal concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost a case of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu for Sterling and the single currency as early attempts to the upside vs the Greenback saw Cable and Eur/Usd revisit recent peaks around 1.2880 and 1.1470 respectively, but a combination of chart resistance and bearish fundamentals forced both back down to circa 1.2825 and 1.1425. In terms of precise technical/psychological levels, 1.2897 and 1.1445 represent Fib retracements, ahead of 1.2900 and 1.1500, while the Pound has remained relatively unchanged and unresponsive to largely on the fence pending Brexit rhetoric from the BoE in testimony to the TSC on November&rsquo;s QIR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of broad risk-on/off impulses, oil prices and technical, cross-flows also impacting the Scandi crowns, like Aud/Nzd, amidst reports of a big unwind of a long position yesterday. However, some consolidation since as Eur/Nok holds around 9.7050 and Eur/Sek pivots 10.3100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has maintained modest recovery gains vs its US counterparts from circa 1.3200 on Monday even though the rebound in crude has waned again, with potential for some independent impetus later tonight via comments from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins and/or Lane.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>More slippage from recent peaks for UK bonds and STIR contracts as the immediate threat to UK PM May&rsquo;s position abates, alleviating some pressure and allowing her more time to garner support for the draft Brexit withdrawal bill. On that note, latest reports suggest some agreement or concession on the Irish border to try and remove the back-stop if an alternative arrangement can be found, as the PM attempts to alleviate concerns raised by Brexiteers and as she heads to Brussels for more talks ahead of Sunday&rsquo;s Summit. Back to Liffe, Gilts were mostly softer in a 123.09-122.87 band vs Monday&rsquo;s 123.05 close in early trade, like the 3 month strip, but both ends of the curve are now rebounding firmly alongside Bunds amidst a more pronounced reversal in BTPs, Gilts up to 123.27, Bunds to 160.95 vs 160.54 at one stage, and the Italian 10 year benchmark down to 119.27 (-125 ticks). Brexit and Italy aside, the BoE&rsquo;s QIR testimony to the TSC, and to a lesser extent the CBI industrial trends survey for October may offer some distraction.</p>\r\n",
