Later, White House Trade Adviser Navarro argued that China has more to lose from tariffs than the US. Navarro said none of the US&rsquo; efforts to negotiate with China have been fruitful thus far, stating &#39;our phone lines are open&#39;. Separately, the US Commerce Department issued preliminary duties on China common alloy aluminium sheet imports. China&rsquo;s foreign ministry said China is not afraid of a trade war, but does not want one. Separately, the FT reported that China is preparing a second round of tariffs on US energy, with a &nbsp;25% levy on oil, gas and coal. Elsewhere, an EU summit draft was said to reportedly support a trade retaliation plan against the US (Note the EU summit is to take place on June 28th and June 29th). Russia&rsquo;s Economy Minister Oreshkin said it will impose tariffs on US goods with Russian equivalents in response to US steel &amp; aluminium duties, adding it will not impact the macroeconomic performance of Russia. Oreshkin added that imports of US road-building equipment will be subject to tariffs, but he emphasized medicine imports from the US will not face levies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>US President Trump said &lsquo;we are getting there&rsquo; in NAFTA talks with Canada and Mexico, and noted it is possible that the US could do a one-to-one NAFTA deal with Mexico and a separate one with Canada (previously both Mexico and Canada have rejected the notion). Canada&#39;s Foreign Minister Freeland said it has no choice but to retaliate against US tariffs, but she reiterated again that while Canada will not escalate, it will not back-down in trade disputes, adding a &rdquo;&#39;win, win, win&rdquo; deal remains possible for NAFTA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s vote in the Lower House on the House of Lords amendment, UK PM May spokesman stated that the Government cannot accept the Lords&rsquo; amendment on Brexit &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo;. Meanwhile, Tory Remainer Rebel Dominic Grieve said he does not want the Government to collapse because of Brexit, saying that if there was no deal, it would be a serious crisis. On the note of rebels, ITV&rsquo;s political editor tweeted that the Government Chief Whip believes he has the votes to defeat the Lords amendment, which is why Remainer Revels have not been offered concessions (he himself cast doubts on the reports, however, suggesting that it was hard to believe). Elsewhere, the FT reported that the draft conclusions from June EU summit states &ldquo;no substantial progress&rdquo; has been made on the Irish backstop, and is calling on member states to &ldquo;step up preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes&rdquo; (ie. Prepare for a no deal Brexit). EU Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier said serious divergences remain in Brexit talks (Ireland) but some good advances have been made on Brexit divorce issues (VAT, customs, certificates for goods, data protections).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB SPEAK: </strong>ECB President Draghi stuck to the script he used after the ECB&rsquo;s meeting last week, arguing that the economy is on a growth path, though uncertainty has recently increased. On inflation, Draghi repeated that growth developments are feeding through into price pressures. The ECB president once again called for patience, prudence and persistence, stating that significant monetary accommodation is still required. ECB&#39;s Nowotny (Hawk) said the central bank is starting its exit from expansive policy, and he expects to begin raising rates after summer 2019. Similarly, ECB&#39;s Liikanen (Neutral) stated the ECB can keep their rate on hold after summer 2019 if needed. ECB&rsquo;s Smets (Dove) said it is too early to say the exact day the ECB will raise rates next summer, adding it is necessary to monitor EM turbulence. ECB&rsquo;s Lane (Dovish) said the ECB needs sizable inflation shock to reverse the decision to end QE and noted the main tools for policy adjustments are rates and forward guidance. He urged the need to keep a close eye on the trade issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED SPEAK: </strong>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter) said global oil supply and demand is in a fragile balance and views medium-term upside risks to oil prices. He sees muted, diminishing negative impact of any oil price rise on US GDP growth. Fed&#39;s Bullard (non-voter) at Sintra said said improved monetary policy has flattened the Phillips curve; his interpretation of the solution is that policymakers should promise to react aggressively to deviations of inflation from target in conducting monetary policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>US Housing Starts for May came in at 1.35mln beating expectations at 1.31mln. US Building Permits however were short of the expected 1.350mln, coming in at 1.301mln. Both moves were attributed to single-family action as starts amounted to 36k, though permits fell by a similar amount. Multi-family activity was also slightly weaker, cooling down from the run up seen at the beginning of the year. Overall, the report is consistent with housing activity remaining relatively flat for the rest of 2018, UBS said, and the bank sees &ldquo;only minimal contributions of residential investment to overall GDP growth.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.40%, NASDAQ COMP &nbsp;-0.32%, DJI -1.15%.</strong> SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -0.47%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.55%, Energy: -0.28%, Financials: -0.35%, Health Care: -0.02%, Industrials: -2.11%, Materials: -1.92%, Telecoms: +1.52%, Tech: -0.67%, Utilities: +0.88%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>US equity futures were hit overnight as US president trump threatened further tariffs on Chinese goods. Futures saw another wave of selling after the cash open, however, this was pared back gradually, and futures grinded higher throughout the remainder of US trade, but struggled to rebound to yesterday&rsquo;s levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Telecoms was the outperformer today thanks to Verizon (VZ), which were upgraded at Deutsche Bank. Following Trump&rsquo;s tariff decision, the safer utilities sector also outperformed, but materials and industrial names were hit on the news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>US President Trump is said to have told Apple CEO Cook that the US will not impose tariffs on iPhones manufactured in China, NYT said; however, US Trade Advisor Navarro stated he has no knowledge of this being the case. CVS Health (CVS) outperformed on Tuesday&rsquo;s after its pharmacy division launched prescription delivery nationwide. Netflix (NFLX) was up following price target increases, with GBH Insight taking it to a street high of $500; it also saw PTs raised at Monness Crespi and Piper. The underperforming names were those heavily impacted by tariffs such as Caterpillar (CAT), Deere (DE), Mosaic (MOS), Boeing (BA) and General Motors (GM). Also, of note, Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) saw positive results on its Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) therapy treatment, seeing the stock spike 70% higher, at one point. This had a knock-on effect to PTC Therapeutics (PTCT) which fell over 30% on Tuesday, and Solid Biosciences (SLDB) who saw gains as high as 85%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) 8 TICKS HIGHER AT 119-27. </strong>Treasuries held in positive territory on Tuesday as firm demand for safe haven debt/assets amidst trade tensions intensifying between the US and China, with other countries such as Russia also jumping in and turning against the US. Note the long bond seems to be holding just above 3%, while the 10s yields fell below 2.90%, falling to lows near 2.86% in Tuesday trade. Most of the actions was concentrated in the belly of the curve where 5yr and 10yr yields were lower by c.3bps, at settlement; 2s5s, 2s10s and 2s30s all narrowed by c.2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q8) SETTLE 79 CENTS LOWER AT $64.90/BBL; BRENT (Q8) FUTURES SETTLE 26 CENTS LOWER AT $75.08/BBL. </strong>Concerns over global trade tensions kept risk assets on the back-foot, and both Brent and WTI trade red. Brent fared slightly better than its US counterpart, however, on news that Iran, Algeria and Venezuela ball oppose any relaxation in OPEC+ supply curbs; additionally, the recent militant attacks in Libya have seen the country&#39;s oil output fall by 400k BPD, according to the NOC head. WTI was hit by speculation that the Chinese would replace US supply with Iranian supply, which at the margin was said to be supportive of Brent, helping the Brent/WTI arb to widen. Some analysts also cited book squaring in WTI, with the July contract set to expire. Ahead of this week&#39;s OPEC+ meetings, Russia once again said it had proposed discussion on raising output by up to 1.5mln barrels (despite opposition from the likes of Venezuela, Iraq, Iran, Algeria); elsewhere, OPEC sources said H2 2018 demand is seen as strong, suggesting that the market could absorb extra production. In later trade, the Iran oil minister said he does not think an agreement will be reached at this OPEC meeting and he clarified OPEC is not an organisation to receive orders from US President Trump and oil not a weapon or a political tool. He also reported to not be attending the OPEC+ meeting on Saturday as he is to depart from Vienna on Friday. Finally, he said Iran has no problems with oil at current prices. Elsewhere, OPEC+ Committee is said to see May cuts compliance at 147% (Prev. 152% compliance in April). After market, the API reports energy inventory data, and the Street expects headline crude stocks to draw 1.9mln barrels, Cushing stocks are seen building 500k barrels, distillates are seen drawing by 200k barrels, and gasoline is seen building by 200k barrels</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Dollar index appears to have formed a firmer base above the 95.000 level amidst broad gains vs all G10 counterparts bar the safest currency havens, with the DXY sitting just below fresh ytd peaks of 95.303 after some mixed US housing data. Assuming no radical change in increasingly tough stances on tariffs between the US and China etc, and/or another technical retracement, resistance just ahead of 95.500 remains within striking distance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF:</strong> As noted above, heightened risk aversion has helped the traditional &lsquo;ports in a storm&rsquo; to trade against the tide of broad Greenback outperformance with USDJPY capped ahead of 110.00 for the bulk of Tuesday&rsquo;s EU session and USDCHF only briefly and marginally extending the upside of its range to circa 0.9975 vs a 0.9920 low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Still the G10 laggard on global trade war developments and dovish RBA minutes with extended losses through 0.7350 at one stage having breached a key technical level and the 0.7400 psychological/big figure mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, GBP, NZD, EUR: </strong>All succumbing to overall USD gains and down between 0.45-60%, with the Loonie slipping further towards 1.3300 having convincingly fallen through support around 1.3350 and another downturn in oil prices not helping (amidst more OPEC+ talk leaning towards a rise in output). Meanwhile, Cable has tested 1.3150 from recent recovery highs around 1.3300 after yet another Brexit blip for the UK Government and the Kiwi is hovering just under 0.6900 after latest declines in GDT auction prices and ahead of NZ GDP data on Wednesday. EURUSD extended post-ECB policy meeting lows to around 1.1530 after yet more GC guidance for unchanged rates beyond the end of QE at through Summer 2019 at the earliest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*COMING-UP: </strong>BCB to publish Interest Rate Decision on Wednesday &nbsp;from 18:00 BST (13:00 EDT) onwards. BCB is widely expected to keep rates on hold at 6.50%. EXPECTATIONS: The BCB is widely expected to keep the Selic rate on hold at 6.50%, with only one analyst surveyed by Reuters expecting a hike (HSBC expects a 50bp rate increase). The survey also found that 27 of the 31 surveyed do not see a hike in 2018. At its previous meeting, the central bank said there is no need for additional easing to ensure inflation will head back to target, and said recent economic indicators showed weakness. In terms of rates, the BCB said economic outlook warrants an interest rate at the below neutral level and stated it would be adequate to keep rates at the current level in the coming meetings.

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Supply curbs are expected to be relaxed, though there does not appear to be a firm consensus of by how much.</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>There are risks of no joint OPEC+ communique, which would point to disunity among the group, and raise the risks of members cheating in the future.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>KEY DATES:&nbsp;</strong>21 June JMMC meeting; 22 June OPEC 174th&nbsp;meeting; 23 June OPEC+ meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EXPECTATIONS:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;OPEC+ supply curb pact, which has seen members trim output by an aggregate 1.8mln BPD, which began in 2017, is likely to be relaxed to offset the production shortfalls from Venezuela and Angola, and the possible neutering of Iran exports in H2 following US reintroducing sanctions on the nation; that&rsquo;s the official reason. Some suggest that the unofficial reason is that the current arrangement is likely to see market conditions tighten further, which will drive prices sharply higher, which could begin weighing on demand for crude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>OIL MARKET BALANCE:&nbsp;&ldquo;</strong>A balanced commodity market implies stable inventories, stable prices, and a stable term structure, in our view,&rdquo; writes BofAML. &ldquo;On these three metrics, we believe the oil market is at last balanced. The deal OPEC+ inked at the end of 2016 surely had a lot to do with it. But a strong global oil demand tailwind and a collapse in Venezuelan crude exports have also been key drivers of the decline in OECD inventories in the past 12 months.&rdquo; OECD inventories now stand beneath their 5-year average (this was said to be a soft-target the group was monitoring). On a days-of-demand basis, inventories are around 4% below average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>STATUS QUO:</strong>&nbsp;The latest data indicates that OPEC crude production has averaged 31.7mln BPD (May data), according to the IEA. That has been slowly edging lower from the 32.6mln BPD in Q3 2017, largely on the back of Venezuela (production has declined 600k BPD over that period). Societe Generale suggests the main takeaways here are that &ldquo;declines from Venezuela expected to continue, and with Iran expected to see a significant impact from renewed oil sanctions; the status quo &ndash; with no increase decided on 22 June &ndash; does not mean flat OPEC production; it means continued declines in OPEC crude supply,&rdquo; with SocGen forecasts a decline to below 31mln BPD by late 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PLUGGING THE HOLE:</strong>&nbsp;Analysts estimate that supply disruptions in Venezuela will see 400k BPD taken out of the market in H2 2018, according to UBS. But some note that supply is may be ramped up in Iraq and Angola (by 275k BPD by Q1 2019, and 200k BPD by Q4, respectively, according to SocGen estimates). UBS estimates that spare capacity among the OPEC+ members is around 1.1mln BPD immediately, but that could rise to around 3.4mln BPD over a 90-day period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SUPPLY HIKES:&nbsp;</strong>The exact magnitude of how much supply will be added remains an item for debate.&nbsp;The range of forecasts is extremely wide; between zero on the low-end (multiple sources have suggested Venezuela, Iran, Iraq and Angola favour maintaining the status quo) while Russia has said it will propose a discussion of adding as much as 1.5mln BPD, and the Saudi energy minister has stated that he has heard proposals to discuss adding as much as 1.8mln BPD of supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VETO THREAT:&nbsp;</strong>Iran has threatened to veto any move to raise output. And given that unanimous consent is required to force any change in OPEC policy. Such a move may compel Saudi Arabia, which is said to want to raise OPEC+ output, to block any communique, and could even publish its own communique with the support of other OPEC members &ndash; which has happened in the past. Alternatively, there is the possibility of no communique, which has also happened in the past (for instance in 2011, when the Saudi&rsquo;s left a meeting early, and then pursued its own policy independent of the group). Finally, some have suggested that the Saudis and Russians could concede, and agree to maintain the status quo, and subsequently cheat on the agreement by raising output; Iran has suggested that such actions could lead to the breakdown of the OPEC+ group.</p>\r\n",

WTI was hit by speculation that the Chinese would replace US supply with Iranian supply, which at the margin was said to be supportive of Brent, helping the Brent/WTI arb to widen. Some analysts also cited book squaring in WTI, with the July contract set to expire. Ahead of this week&#39;s OPEC+ meetings, Russia once again said it had proposed discussion on raising output by up to 1.5mln barrels (despite opposition from the likes of Venezuela, Iraq, Iran, Algeria); elsewhere, OPEC sources said H2 2018 demand is seen as strong, suggesting that the market could absorb extra production. After market, the API reports energy inventory data, and the Street expects headline crude stocks to draw 2.7mln barrels, Cushing stocks are seen building 500k barrels, distillates are seen drawing by 400k barrels, and gasoline is seen drawing by 500k barrels.

This wasn&rsquo;t taken sitting down by China as Mofcom responded that China will take strong counter measures if US issues a new list. As such, US equity futures sold off and Asia stocks were mostly pressured with Hang Seng (-2.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-3.8%) feeling the brunt of the blaring sabre-rattling between the world&rsquo;s 2 largest economies as they move closer to the brink of a trade war. In addition, the mainland blood bath was also exacerbated by the Shanghai Comp.&rsquo;s decline below the 3000 level for the first time in 2 years. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-1.8%) was also negative alongside the widespread risk averse tone and on JPY strength, while ASX 200 (flat) bucked the trend led by strength in energy following the recent rebound in oil prices. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded marginally higher amid the risk averse tone in the region, but with gains limited as focus was centred on stocks and amid a mixed 30yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 70bln via 7-day reverse repos, CNY 20bln via 14-day reverse repos and CNY 10bln via 28-day reverse repos for a net daily injection of CNY 50bln, while it also PBoC announced CNY 200bln in 1yr MLF loans.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equites are experiencing significant losses (Euro stoxx 50 -1.0%, at 2 month lows) after US President Trump&rsquo;s announcement asked the US Trade Representative to identify USD 200bln in Chinese goods for further 10% tariffs, with an additional USD 200bln prepared should retaliation occur. This has hammered European markets , with all equity bourses in the red. The DAX is the underperformer (-1.3%) at 1 month lows with FTSE 100 (-0.5%, at 1 month lows) outperforming due to support from a weakening GBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The technology sector is currently drifting lower as investors are avoiding high beta stocks in the risk off environment, with Infineon leading the losses in this sector. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index and broad Dollar are back in the ascendency amidst ramped up global trade war concerns, as the US and China threaten to impose significantly higher tariffs against each other. The DXY has just eclipsed its previous peak for the year to set new pinnacle at 95.270 and the next decent technical objective around 95.470 is firmly back in sight and within striking distance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/AUD - Polar opposites amidst heightened risk aversion as Usd/Jpy extends and accelerates its pull-back from recent peaks (circa 110.90) to just a few pips off 109.50 and fib support at 109.51. Conversely, Aud/Usd has fallen through fib support at 0.7413 and 0.7400 on the way to 1 year+ lows not far from 0.7350, with dovish-leaning RBA minutes overnight adding further downside pressure on the headline pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF - The Franc retains a degree of underlying safe-haven demand and relative resilience vs the Greenback within 0.9920-60 trading parameters, but remains reluctant to rally to far against the Eur (hovering above 1.1500 after only a brief dip under) as Thursday&rsquo;s SNB quarterly review looms with growing prospects of a more concerted attempt to curb the Chf&rsquo;s appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The next biggest G10 casualty of broad risk-off sentiment, but also on further dovish rate guidance from the ECB, as the single currency probes new post-policy meeting lows sub-1.1540 and could re-test bids/support ahead of the 1.1510 ytd base if stops are tripped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD/CAD - All extending losses vs the Usd, with Cable finally losing the 1.3200 handle after another UK Government amendment on the Brexit bill was rejected by the House of Lords, while the Kiwi is now under 0.6900 and Loonie down to 1.3250.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Fresh depths plumbed for the already beleaguered currencies, and with some predictions that the misery is unlikely to end as forecasts for Usd/Try rise to 5.0000 in some quarters given the increased risk of capital flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heightened risk aversion on US-China trade developments and yet another EU withdrawal bill amendment defeat for PM May has boosted bonds and Short Sterling contracts off the respective Liffe opens with the 3 month strip registering early gains of 4 ticks at best, while the 10 year debt future kicked off at 123.01 and climbed further to 123.19 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 122.54 settlement price. Some consolidation subsequently followed as Bunds eased off again having breached nearest technical resistance up at 161.78, but lost momentum ahead of the next upside chart target around 162.01 (161.86 the new Eurex high), with Gilts retreating to 122.92 before regaining the 123.00 handle again. Back to Eurex, a solid Schatz auction highlighted the current firm demand for safe haven debt/assets and this is also keeping US treasuries elevated amidst even more curve flattening. Note the long bond is only just holding around 3.0% while the 10-year benchmark is now below 2.90%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is trimming gains seen on Monday, with WTI currently down 1% ahead of the OPEC and non-OPEC technical committee monitoring meeting, with Brent outperforming on Libya losing 400k BPD. The fossil fuel is also being pressured by a soured risk tone on the possibility of Chinese crude tariffs and a rising dollar, which has hit YTD highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copper, iron and steel are all being hit by the widening trade war with the construction materials down 3%, 2% and 2.9% respectively, as supply concerns in all of these markets have taken a back seat to potential tariffs in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC to consider Republic of Congo&#39;s application to join the cartel, according to a delegate. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple OPEC source say Venezuela, Iran and Algeria oppose an output increase in oil. OPEC sources say they see strong oil demand in H2 2018, suggesting market may absorb extra production. Iran&#39;s Commerce Minister Kazempour reiterates opposition to output increase in oil.

The DXY has just eclipsed its previous peak for the year to set new pinnacle at 95.270 and the next decent technical objective around 95.470 is firmly back in sight and within striking distance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Polar opposites amidst heightened risk aversion as Usd/Jpy extends and accelerates its pull-back from recent peaks (circa 110.90) to just a few pips off 109.50 and fib support at 109.51. Conversely, Aud/Usd has fallen through fib support at 0.7413 and 0.7400 on the way to 1 year+ lows not far from 0.7350, with dovish-leaning RBA minutes overnight adding further downside pressure on the headline pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc retains a degree of underlying safe-haven demand and relative resilience vs the Greenback within 0.9920-60 trading parameters, but remains reluctant to rally to far against the Eur (hovering above 1.1500 after only a brief dip under) as Thursday&rsquo;s SNB quarterly review looms with growing prospects of a more concerted attempt to curb the Chf&rsquo;s appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next biggest G10 casualty of broad risk-off sentiment, but also on further dovish rate guidance from the ECB, as the single currency probes new post-policy meeting lows sub-1.1540 and could re-test bids/support ahead of the 1.1510 ytd base if stops are tripped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD/CAD&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All extending losses vs the Usd, with Cable finally losing the 1.3200 handle after another UK Government amendment on the Brexit bill was rejected by the House of Commons, while the Kiwi is now under 0.6900 and Loonie down to 1.3250.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh depths plumbed for the already beleaguered currencies, and with some predictions that the misery is unlikely to end as forecasts for Usd/Try rise to 5.0000 in some quarters given the increased risk of capital flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heightened risk aversion on US-China trade developments and yet another EU withdrawal bill amendment defeat for PM May has boosted bonds and Short Sterling contracts off the respective Liffe opens with the 3 month strip registering early gains of 4 ticks at best, while the 10 year debt future kicked off at 123.01 and climbed further to 123.19 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 122.54 settlement price. Some consolidation subsequently followed as Bunds eased off again having breached nearest technical resistance up at 161.78, but lost momentum ahead of the next upside chart target around 162.01 (161.86 the new Eurex high), with Gilts retreating to 122.92 before regaining the 123.00 handle again. Back to Eurex, a solid Schatz auction highlighted the current firm demand for safe haven debt/assets and this is also keeping US treasuries elevated amidst even more curve flattening. Note the long bond is only just holding around 3.0% while the 10-year benchmark is now below 2.90%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is trimming gains seen on Monday, with WTI currently down 1% ahead of the OPEC and non-OPEC technical committee monitoring meeting, with Brent outperforming on Libya losing 400k BPD. The fossil fuel is also being pressured by a soured risk tone on the possibility of Chinese crude tariffs and a rising dollar, which has hit YTD highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trade war concerns are also being seen in metals markets, as Gold is up 0.2% on safe haven flow. Copper, iron and steel are all being hit by the widening trade war with the construction materials down 3%, 2% and 2.9% respectively, as supply concerns in all of these markets have taken a back seat to potential tariffs in China.</p>\r\n",

However, Bunds stopped just short of key 50% fib resistance around 161.78 and have drifted back towards opening levels in the run up to EU cash bourse trade, awaiting further impetus or some validation for the degree of safe-haven premium factored in. On the macro front, very little scheduled ahead in terms of data, but ECB President Draghi is due to speak from Sintra again at 9.00BST, not long after Lane and before the latter speaks again, with Praet also slated in between. Supply-wise, Eur4 bn Schatz on offer and seems likely to be well received in the current core debt friendly climate and following dovish ECB rate guidance last Thursday.</p>\r\n",

(Times)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD was weaker on heightened trade tensions between the US and China, which in turn provided some support for EUR/USD and GBP/USD. However, price action was focused on JPY which was bolstered by safe-haven flows and saw USD/JPY decline below the 110.00 handle, while JPY-crosses were equally pressured. Elsewhere, antipodeans were mixed with NZD/USD seemingly oblivious to the ongoing trade jitters and with AUD/USD briefly testing 0.7400 to the downside amid the increased US-China tariff threats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA Minutes from June 5th meeting reiterated that low rates support the economy and steady policy is consistent with targets.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed overnight with WTI crude futures weaker as prices pulled back from the prior day&rsquo;s strength amid the risk averse tone due to the heightened trade tensions, which also kept copper subdued and weighed on Chinese metal prices at the open. Conversely, gold prices were higher overnight due to its safe haven status and which was also facilitated by a weaker greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ecuador&#39;s oil minister said OPEC is to discuss oil production increase, while he added that Saudi Arabia and Russia want to release some production and that OPEC has a proposal to increase output by 1.5mln bpd. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasuries were little changed on Monday though some downside pressure was seen across the complex in afternoon trade as the dollar weakened moderately, and as equities recovered some of the losses seen previously after China retaliated to US tariffs. Bumper issuance from Bayer added downside pressure to the complex, launching an 8-part USD 15bln to finance the acquisition of Monsanto. Volumes were generally thin, and at settlement, major curve spreads were little changed.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equity markets were mostly lower amid a further escalation of trade tensions after President Trump asked the US Trade Representative to identify USD 200bln in Chinese goods for further tariffs of 10% which will be imposed if China goes ahead with reciprocal tariffs, while he also threatened tariffs on another USD 200bln of goods if China retaliates yet again. This wasn&rsquo;t taken sitting down by China as Mofcom responded that China will take strong counter measures if US issues a new list. As such, US equity futures sold off and Asia stocks were mostly pressured with Hang Seng (-2.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-3.0%) feeling the brunt of the blaring sabre-rattling between the world&rsquo;s 2 largest economies as they move closer to the brink of a trade war. In addition, the mainland blood bath was also exacerbated by the Shanghai Comp.&rsquo;s decline below the 3000 level for the first time in 2 years. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-1.5%) was also negative alongside the widespread risk averse tone and on JPY strength, while ASX 200 (+0.2%) bucked the trend led by strength in energy following the recent rebound in oil prices. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded marginally higher amid the risk averse tone in the region, but with gains limited as focus was centred on stocks and amid a mixed 30yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac equity markets are mostly lower amid a further escalation of trade tensions after President Trump asked the US Trade Representative to identify USD 200bln in Chinese goods for further tariffs of 10% which will be imposed if China goes ahead with reciprocal tariffs, while he also threatened tariffs on another USD 200bln of goods if China retaliates yet again. This wasn&rsquo;t taken sitting down by China with Mofcom responding that China will have to adopt comprehensive steps to fight back firmly if the US publishes additional tariff list, in which it warned of qualitative and quantitative measures. As such, US equity futures sold off and Asia stocks were mostly pressured with Hang Seng (-2.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.8%) feeling the brunt of the blaring sabre-rattling between the sides which are on the brink of a trade war. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) is also negative alongside the widespread risk averse tone and on currency flows, while ASX 200 (+0.3%) has so far bucked the trend led by strength in energy following the recent rebound in oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD is weaker on heightened trade tensions between the US and China, which in turn has provided some support for EUR/USD and GBP/USD. However, price action was concentrated on JPY which was bolstered by safe-haven flows and saw USD/JPY decline below the 110.00 handle, while JPY-crosses were equally pressured. Elsewhere, antipodeans are mixed with NZD/USD seemingly oblivious to the ongoing jitters and with AUD/USD briefly testing 0.7400 to the downside amid the increased US-China tariff threats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid the risk averse tone in the region, but with gains limited ahead of a 30yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
