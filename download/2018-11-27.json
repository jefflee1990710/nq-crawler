Retail stocks (M, KSS, TGT, AMZN) were among the top performers due to strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales; particularly Amazon which reported its best ever single day sales. Netflix (NFLX) announced a Roald Dahl project. United Technologies (UTX) underperformed after announcing a major business restructuring.

He urged China to deal with IP theft and tariff barriers while talking up the US economy and criticising China&rsquo;s. At the same conference, White House National Security Advisor Bolton also appeared optimistic on the relationship that Trump has developed with China&#39;s Xi. Earlier in the session, Politico reported that some of Trump&#39;s top advisers were not happy with his Monday interview with the WSJ, where he announced his intention to go ahead with tariffs on China imports from 10% to 25% in January. Advisers raised fears that the latest announcement could make the high-stakes meetings at the G20 (30/Nov-1/Dec) with Xi even more difficult. Apple&rsquo;s shares faced pressure on Tuesday after Trump opened the possibility of tariffs being placed on iPhones from China while EU automakers suffered losses after reports in WiWo suggested that the US could impose auto tariffs as early as next week; a Commerce Department spokesperson later stated that the final findings on the 232 automotive tariffs investigation have not been submitted to the President. The Chinese Ambassador to the US warns of dire consequences if the trade war leads to economic separation; China prefers a negotiated solution. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Vice Chair Clarida (Voter) stressed that it is especially important to look at a range of data points at this time in the US rate-hike cycle; he could be in favour of further rate hikes if inflation surprises to the upside. He noted that the rate is currently &#39;just below&#39; Fed&#39;s longer-term neutral estimates, urging more data dependency as policy moves towards neutral estimates. His opinion is that uncertainty regarding neutral policy and full employment highlights the need for data dependency. Fed&#39;s Bullard (Non-voter, Dove) stated that rates are already at or near neutral while he does not expect low unemployment to spark inflation; he highlighted that the US economy and job market appear strong with only moderate financial risks though he expects slower growth over next two years making it more &#39;tougher&#39; for the Fed to continue rate hikes; he sees possible &#39;cracks&#39; in growth to shape Fed debate in coming year. Fed&#39;s George (Voter, Hawk) said unemployment is &quot;very ow&quot; in the US, causing labour shortages. Fed&#39;s Evans (Non-Voter, Dove) believes it is time to return to a more neutral policy stance; he noted that the planned closing of GM plants adds to challenges in the US manufacturing sector while businesses are finding it difficult to find high skilled labour. He added the automotive sector is strong through the recovery but is facing challenges now. Fed&#39;s Bostic (Voter, Dovish) said the &quot;positive&quot; overall economy still leaves &quot;pockets of distress&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The European top court said on Tuesday that it would make a decision on whether the UK can unilaterally reverse the decision to leave the bloc, opening the possibility to a second referendum. The claim was raised by Scottish MPS, MEPs and MSPs who believe that revoking A50 would &quot;ride roughshod&quot; over EU principles. Even a formerly loyal PM May&rsquo;s supporter, Fallon, denounced the draft withdrawal agreement as the worst of all worlds and suggested a delay to try and get better terms. In related news, Labour sources suggested that Opposition Leader Corbyn would call a second vote shortly after PM May&rsquo;s defeat on the meaningful vote in Parliament on the basis that there is no consensus on what happens next, rumours that were nonetheless later denied. Meanwhile, UK PM May opposed criticism raised by US President Trump over her deal after he warned on Monday that the UK may not be able to strike a trade deal with the US on current terms. PM May, in response, claimed to have an independent trade policy and stated they have already talked with the US about future trade talks while announcing she will not meet Trump at the G20. Also note UK and US negotiators are meeting on Wednesday in Washington for what they expect to be the final round of talks over services agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>The EU commission are still in open dialogue with Italy over the budget, as discussions are now set to continue at the G20 meeting. EU&rsquo;s Moscovici told the Italian government that he is open to seeking a solution with the country as he favours encouragement to sanctions while a draft showed EU Governments are backing the EU Commission view that disciplinary procedure over debt is warranted. With regards to the figures, the 2019 deficit/GDP target is almost certain to be 2.2%-2.3%, as suggested by the League&rsquo;s Economic Advisor Siri, while PM Conte reportedly anticipates EUR 3.6bln of budget cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CONSUMER CONFIDENCE:</strong> The index dropped to 135.7 from 137.9, only a tad below the 135.9 consensus. The weakness in this reading was attributed to the expectations component, which is sensitive to stock market volatility. Nonetheless, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said that the survey remains solid showing gains spread across buying plans for homes and cars contributing strongly to business conditions. Looking ahead, they warn that &ldquo;the continued volatility in the stock market usually would signal further declines in expectations and headline confidence, but the plunge in oil prices is now driving down retail gas prices, which will act as an offset&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.33% at 2682, NDX +0.34% at 6701, DJI +0.44% at 24749. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -0.33%, Materials -1.25%, Industrials -0.24%, Cons Discretionary +0.24%, Cons Staples +0.92%, Healthcare +1.00%, Financials +0.05%, Tech +0.24%, Telecoms +0.57%, Utilities +0.87%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> PG&amp;E (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) continued their recovery as a legislative bill gains traction, helping to burden wildfire-related costs. Vertex (VRTX) moved higher after the pharmaceutical announced that three studies met their primary end-points. Airlines (DAL, UAL, LUV, SAVE) opened higher following Spirit Airlines (SAVE) raising its full year TRASM guidance. Retail stocks (M, KSS, TGT, AMZN) were among the top performers due to strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales; particularly Amazon which reported its best ever single day sales. Netflix (NFLX) announced a Roald Dahl project. United Technologies (UTX) underperformed after announcing a major business restructuring. Apple (AAPL) opened lower due to Trump threatening tariffs on the co.&rsquo;s products, though pared losses over the course of the session. Bristol-Myers (BMY) nosedived after a lung-cancer treatment missed its primary endpoint. Hormel Foods (HRL) traded lower on the back of a downgrade at Jefferies. Facebook (FB) fell in the wake of further scrutiny in its handling of the Russia data scandal. General Motors (GM) saw downticks on a tweet from Trump saying he is mulling cutting subsidies for electric cars for the automaker. Raymond James (RJF) drifted lower whilst being initiated with a neutral at Goldman. Steel stocks (NUE, X, AKS) traded lower following reports that Chinese steel mills are preparing for challenges as margins fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 0.07 LOWER AT USD 51.56/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 0.27 LOWER AT USD 60.21/BBL.</strong> Attention is now on the OPEC meeting between 6-7 December in Vienna, where a consensus is building that the cartel will make moves to trim oil production. The market will be looking for hints at the G20, which is set to feature appearances from the Saudi and Russian energy ministers. Ahead of that meeting, however, WSJ reported officials in many OPEC countries say the need for collective action to halt the oil price rout outweighs the risk of riling a US president who has publicly accused them of plotting to keep prices high; the article noted that with Brent around $60 per barrel, oil prices were below levels many OPEC and allied nations need to balance their budgets. WSJ also said that producers have been coy about plans to reduce their production amid President Trump&#39;s public chiding on Twitter, as well as private threats made to Saudi Arabia that he would back legislation aimed at making OPEC an illegal cartel. Tomorrow, the Saudi energy minister and his Nigerian counterpart will be giving a press conference at 0900 GMT, which will help shape expectations for potential comments at the G20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 3+ TICKS HIGHER AT 119-08. </strong>The Treasury complex ended Tuesday&rsquo;s session pretty much unchanged, trading in a 7-tick range, holding on to the gains just after Monday&rsquo;s market close after US President Trump announced his intention to go ahead with raising tariffs on China imports. Very limited reaction was seen on Fed&rsquo;s Vice Chair Clarida reiterated the importance of data dependency in the Fed&rsquo;s policy approach. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve, where yields were lower by around 1bps at settlement. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 5-YEAR NOTES AUCTION: </strong>The treasury sold USD 40bln in 5yr notes on the screws at a high yield of 2.88%. The bid-to-cover came in at 2.49x well above recent averages indicating decent demand for the auction. Directs were awarded a portion significantly higher than recent averages while indirects were awarded a share well within recent average. Dealers were left with a smaller portion than previously seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Dollar has retained an underlying bid, albeit not across the board as its Antipodean counterparts and many EM rivals regain some composure after recent underperformance. Early month end portfolio models are flagging a modest Greenback buy signal vs all G10 rivals, while HIA and SOMA flows are also supportive. Hence, the index has consolidated gains above 97.000 and may climb further above the big figure from a technical perspective if it closes above a major Fib (97.068), with the next upside chart resistance levels at 97.406 and 97.693 (current ytd high).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency has come under renewed pressure and is probing just below 1.1300 vs the Usd on the back of reports via German media that the US could impose the pending 25% auto tariffs as soon as next week (post-G20 Summit). On clear break of the round number, further stops are seen around 1.1290, but similar sell orders said to be triggered on a break of 1.1310 did not prompt an aggressive slide in the headline pair, so it appears that there are hefty bids on the way down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Brexit remains the big independent weight for Sterling as opposition to UK PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal stacks up ahead of the December 11 meaningful vote, and includes a so-called loyal supporter, Fallon, who denounced the draft withdrawal agreement as the worst of all worlds and suggested a delay to try and get better terms. However, the EU has persistently warned there is no return to the negotiating table and Cable has extended losses under 1.2800 and briefly through the 100 DMA vs Eur, but so far holding in above recent lows (1.2724 and 0.8900+ respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>A break from the norm or possibly just a short-term deviation, but as US-China trade tensions ramp up ahead of US President Trump&rsquo;s meeting with Chinese peer Xi, the Usd is benefiting more from safe-haven positioning with gains vs the yen through a couple of Fibs (113.48 and 113.79) towards 114.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD, SEK, NOK: </strong>All ending Tuesday&rsquo;s session at the top of the major rankings, and largely in corrective and technical trade, as the Kiwi shrugged off more downbeat NZ data (trade after retail sales yesterday) to retest 0.6800 with the aid of some bullish cross-winds as Aud/Nzd retreated from just shy of 1.0700 to sub-1.0650 again and Aud/Usd languished closer to the base of a 0.7215-70 range. Elsewhere, the Sek also largely ignored weaker than forecast Swedish releases in the form of trade, and softer PPI prints to trade up near 10.2600 vs the Eur, while Eur/Nok eased just a few pips below 9.7100 at best.</p>\r\n",

The market will be looking for hints at the G20, which is set to feature appearances from the Saudi and Russian energy ministers. Ahead of that meeting, however, WSJ reported officials in many OPEC countries say the need for collective action to halt the oil price rout outweighs the risk of riling a US president who has publicly accused them of plotting to keep prices high; the article noted that with Brent around $60 per barrel, oil prices were below levels many OPEC and allied nations need to balance their budgets. WSJ also said that producers have been coy about plans to reduce their production amid President Trump&#39;s public chiding on Twitter, as well as private threats made to Saudi Arabia that he would back legislation aimed at making OPEC an illegal cartel. Tomorrow, the Saudi energy minister and his Nigerian counterpart will be giving a press conference at 0900 GMT, which will help shape expectations for potential comments at the G20.</p>\r\n",

Analysts were encouraged by the internals, which saw the return of direct bidders (19.5% participation vs 5.5% previous), which resulted in dealer and indirect participation falling beneath recent averages. &quot;There has been an increase in demand for US 2y paper lately, so tonight&#39;s US 5y auction should probably provide a better indication for duration demand,&quot; UBS said.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar has retained an underlying bid, albeit not across the board as its Antipodean counterparts and many EM rivals regain some composure after recent underperformance. Early month end portfolio models are flagging a modest Greenback buy signal vs all G10 rivals, while HIA and SOMA flows are also supportive. Hence, the index has consolidated gains above 97.000 and may climb further above the big figure from a technical perspective if it closes above a major Fib (97.068), with the next upside chart resistance levels at 97.406 and 97.693 (current ytd high).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has come under renewed pressure and is probing just below 1.1300 vs the Usd on the back of reports via German media that the US could impose the pending 25% auto tariffs as soon as next week (post-G20 Summit). On clear break of the round number, further stops are seen around 1.1290, but similar sell orders said to be triggered on a break of 1.1310 did not prompt an aggressive slide in the headline pair, so it appears that there are hefty bids on the way down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brexit remains the big independent weight for Sterling as opposition to UK PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal stacks up ahead of the December 11 meaningful vote, and includes a so called loyal supporter, Fallon, who denounced the draft withdrawal agreement as the worst of all worlds and suggested a delay to try and get better terms. However, the EU has persistently warned there is no return to the negotiating table and Cable has extended losses under 1.2800 and briefly through the 100 DMA vs Eur, but so far holding in above recent lows (1.2724 and 0.8900+ respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A break from the norm or possibly just a short term deviation, but as US-China trade tensions ramp up ahead of US President Trump&rsquo;s meeting with Chinese peer Xi, the Usd is benefiting more from safe-haven positioning with gains vs the yen through a couple of Fibs (113.48 and 113.79) towards 114.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All ending Tuesday&rsquo;s EU session at the top of the major rankings, and largely in corrective and technical trade, as the Kiwi shrugged off more downbeat NZ data (trade after retail sales yesterday) to retest 0.6800 with the aid of some bullish cross-winds as Aud/Nzd retreated from just shy of 1.0700 to sub-1.0650 again and Aud/Usd languished closer to the base of a 0.7215-70 range. Elsewhere, the Sek also largely ignored weaker than forecast Swedish releases in the form of trade, and softer PPI prints to trade up near 10.2600 vs the Eur, while Eur/Nok eased just a few pips below 9.7100 at best.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were lifted from the open with Australia led higher by tech and financials, while a pullback in USD/JPY limited the upside for the Japanese benchmark. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) were mixed with China somewhat dampened by Trump&rsquo;s hardball tactics ahead of the meeting with Chinese President Xi at this week&rsquo;s G20, in which he suggested an intention to proceed with raising tariffs on China imports from 10% to 25% and also warned to place tariffs on the remaining USD 267bln of Chinese imports if they fail to reach a favourable outcome for the US. Furthermore, a slowdown of Chinese Industrial Profit growth and concerns in the Hong Kong property sector also contributed the cautiousness in Chinese markets.

Equity futures staged a pre-cash open rally after it was reported that a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as stating that US President Xi and US President Trump had agreed to mutually beneficial agreements. However gains in futures markets were pared after it was later reported that this was in reference to a November 1st phone call and thus was viewed as stale by the market, particularly considering the hardball interview by Trump in the WSJ yesterday ahead of this week&rsquo;s G20 summit. On an index basis, the SMI lags its peers (-0.5%) with Credit Suisse (-1.7%) lower following a broker downgrade at Credit Suisse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of sector specifics, performance is relatively mixed with slight underperformance in material names in-fitting with recent price action in the complex. To the upside, utility names modestly outperform, albeit the moves thus far across the board are relatively small in terms of magnitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individual movers this morning include Dialog Semiconductor (-1.4%) amid Apple-inspired losses (post-Trump threat of potential tariffs on iPhones and laptops), Apple share are down 1.7% pre-market. Elsewhere, Rexel (+1.9%) are firmer following a broker upgrade at Credit Suisse, Thomas Cook (-24.5%) shares are notably underperforming following a disappointing trading update, dragging Tui (-4.2%) lower in sympathy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; The standout underperformer vs. peers amid comments from UK Remain loyalist Fallon who said it may be possible to delay the date UK leaves the EU to renegotiate a better deal, inflicting a blow to UK PM May&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;best deal&rdquo;. As such Cable fell to a low print of 1.2734 ahead of the mid-November base at 1.2724, having already given up the 1.2800 handle following comments from US President Trump who noted that UK may not be able to trade with the US, in an interview last night. If the mid-November low (or Raab trough) is breached, the next levels to note are 1.2696 (October low) and 1.2662 (YTD low). However, looking further ahead Credit Suisse is more optimistic on the outlook for Sterling, with their Cable forecast at 1.4000 by end-2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Overall bid vs G10 counterparts with the aid of the GBP weakness due to the latest Brexit developments. Moreover, Citi&rsquo;s rebalancing model points to modest USD buying vs. peers going into month end, while Nordea also notes tomorrow&rsquo;s HIA which is the cut-off date if companies wish to convert foreign currency into USD along with SOMA that happens to fall on Friday as well. The index is currently hovering above 97.000 within a narrow range around the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; Holding up well vs. the pound above 0.8850 but not quite challenging the 100DMA 0.8884, though the single currency is lower vs. the buck, with the pair tripping some stops at 1.1310. Obviously, 1.1300 is nearest support and if breached more stops are reported at 1.1290.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Reports from a Chinese Ministry spokesman noting US President Trump and Chinese President Xi have agreed to reach a mutually beneficial agreement saw the Japanese currency extend losses vs. the greenback through a Fib level at 113.48 and reaching highs of 113.66 (shy of the next Fib at 113.76), before pairing a bulk of the move as it quickly emerged that the comments were made initially in wake of a phone call between the two leader back on November 1st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD,AUD &ndash; Notable, albeit marginal G10 outperformers vs. the buck, with the Kiwi staging another recovery following the weak data (trade overnight), and now looking ahead to the RBNZ semi-annual FSR tonight. NZD/USD hovering just below 0.6800 and AUD/USD near the middle of a 0.7270-15 band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.2%) and WTI (Unch) are nursing initial losses as focus starts turning to the G20 summit over the weekend where markets may get initial hints of what to expect at the Dec 6th OPEC meeting in Vienna. The Saudi Crown Prince, Russian President and US President are to meet, possibly on the side-lines to decide the future of the global oil market. Talk around the market notes that Prince Mohammed Bin Salman may not able to defy US President Trump&rsquo;s aim for lower oil prices after the White House stood behind the prince in regard to the killing of journalist Khashoggi. Nonetheless, traders will be watching the summit closely, while in the nearer-term, today will see the release of the weekly API where forecasts see headline crude stockpiles printing a drawdown of 0.6mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is trading relatively flat as the dollar holds steady following comments from Trump that overnight that he still intends to raise Chinese import tariffs to 25%; these comments come ahead of this week&rsquo;s G20 summit. Additionally, US-China trade pessimism has caused copper prices to fall for the 3rd consecutive session due to demand concerns. Iron ore futures have dropped to their lowest level in over 4 months, dropping by 5% over concerns that steel prices are to remain pressured by slower demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraqi Oil Minster urges adopting a &quot;balanced policy&quot; in dealing with global oil market.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts remain on the front foot on the back of latest Brexit deal rumblings and US-Sino tariff reports, with Trump upping the ante ahead the G20 Summit. UK 10 year futures are holding above 123.00 vs 123.23 at best, shrugging off significantly stronger than expected CBI trades, but losing some momentum alongside Bunds (just hovering below 161.00 vs 161.21 at the Eurex peak) and US Treasuries on a lack of follow-through buying in early trade. Elsewhere, Italian BTPs have traded up to 124.29 at one stage, before reverting to just below the 124.00 handle amidst yet more budget banter and short end supply. Ahead, more issuance to digest via the US 5 year auction, plus Fed&#39;s&nbsp;Clarida after 2nd tier data.</p>\r\n",

Equity futures staged a pre-cash open rally after it was reported that a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as stating that US President Xi and US President Trump had agreed to mutually beneficial agreements. However gains in futures markets were pared after it was later reported that this was in reference to a November 1st phone call and thus was viewed as stale by the market, particularly considering the hardball interview by Trump in the WSJ yesterday ahead of this week&rsquo;s G20 summit. On an index basis, the SMI lags its peers (-0.5%) with Credit Suisse (-1.7%) lower following a broker downgrade at Credit Suisse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of sector specifics, performance is relatively mixed with slight underperformance in material names in-fitting with recent price action in the complex. To the upside, utility names modestly outperform, albeit the moves thus far across the board are relatively small in terms of magnitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individual movers this morning include Dialog Semiconductor (-1.4%) amid Apple-inspired losses (post-Trump threat of potential tariffs on iPhones and laptops), Apple share are down 1.7% pre-market. Elsewhere, Rexel (+1.9%) are firmer following a broker upgrade at Credit Suisse, Thomas Cook (-24.5%) shares are notably underperforming following a disappointing trading update, dragging Tui (-4.2%) lower in sympathy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; The standout underperformer vs. peers amid comments from UK Remain loyalist Fallon who said it may be possible to delay the date UK leaves the EU to renegotiate a better deal, inflicting a blow to UK PM May&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;best deal&rdquo;. As such Cable fell to a low print of 1.2734 ahead of the mid-November base at 1.2724, having already given up the 1.2800 handle following comments from US President Trump who noted that UK may not be able to trade with the US, in an interview last night. If the mid-November low (or Raab trough) is breached, the next levels to note are 1.2696 (October low) and 1.2662 (YTD low). However, looking further ahead Credit Suisse is more optimistic on the outlook for Sterling, with their Cable forecast at 1.4000 by end-2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Overall bid vs G10 counterparts with the aid of the GBP weakness due to the latest Brexit developments. Moreover, Citi&rsquo;s rebalancing model points to modest USD buying vs. peers going into month end, while Nordea also notes tomorrow&rsquo;s HIA which is the cut-off date if companies wish to convert foreign currency into USD along with SOMA that happens to fall on Friday as well. The index is currently hovering above 97.000 within a narrow range around the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; Holding up well vs. the pound above 0.8850 but not quite challenging the 100DMA 0.8884, though the single currency is lower vs. the buck, with the pair tripping some stops at 1.1310. Obviously, 1.1300 is nearest support and if breached more stops are reported at 1.1290.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Reports from a Chinese Ministry spokesman noting US President Trump and Chinese President Xi have agreed to reach a mutually beneficial agreement saw the Japanese currency extend losses vs. the greenback through a Fib level at 113.48 and reaching highs of 113.66 (shy of the next Fib at 113.76), before pairing a bulk of the move as it quickly emerged that the comments were made initially in wake of a phone call between the two leader back on November 1st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD,AUD &ndash; Notable, albeit marginal G10 outperformers vs. the buck, with the Kiwi staging another recovery following the weak data (trade overnight), and now looking ahead to the RBNZ semi-annual FSR tonight. NZD/USD hovering just below 0.6800 and AUD/USD near the middle of a 0.7270-15 band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts remain on the front foot on the back of latest Brexit deal rumblings and US-Sino tariff reports, with Trump upping the ante ahead the G20 Summit. UK 10 year futures are holding above 123.00 vs 123.23 at best, shrugging off significantly stronger than expected CBI trades, but losing some momentum alongside Bunds (just hovering below 161.00 vs 161.21 at the Eurex peak) and US Treasuries on a lack of follow-through buying in early trade. Elsewhere, Italian BTPs have traded up to 124.29 at one stage, before reverting to just below the 124.00 handle amidst yet more budget banter and short end supply. Ahead, more issuance to digest via the US 5 year auction, plus Fed&rsquo;s Powell and Clarida after 2nd tier data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.2%) and WTI (Unch) are nursing initial losses as focus starts turning to the G20 summit over the weekend where markets may get initial hints of what to expect at the Dec 6th OPEC meeting in Vienna. The Saudi Crown Prince, Russian President and US President are to meet, possibly on the side-lines to decide the future of the global oil market. Talk around the market notes that Prince Mohammed Bin Salman may not able to defy US President Trump&rsquo;s aim for lower oil prices after the White House stood behind the prince in regard to the killing of journalist Khashoggi. Nonetheless, traders will be watching the summit closely, while in the nearer-term, today will see the release of the weekly API where forecasts see headline crude stockpiles printing a drawdown of 0.6mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is trading relatively flat as the dollar holds steady following comments from Trump that overnight that he still intends to raise Chinese import tariffs to 25%; these comments come ahead of this week&rsquo;s G20 summit. Additionally, US-China trade pessimism has caused copper prices to fall for the 3rd consecutive session due to demand concerns. Iron ore futures have dropped to their lowest level in over 4 months, dropping by 5% over concerns that steel prices are to remain pressured by slower demand.</p>\r\n",

As such Cable fell to a low print of 1.2734 ahead of the mid-November base at 1.2724, having already given up the 1.2800 handle following comments from US President Trump who noted that UK may not be able to trade with the US, in an interview last night. If the mid-November low (or Raab trough) is breached, the next levels to note are 1.2696 (October low) and 1.2662 (YTD low). However, looking further ahead Credit Suisse is more optimistic on the outlook for Sterling, with their Cable forecast at 1.4000 by end-2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Overall bid vs G10 counterparts with the aid of the GBP weakness due to the latest Brexit developments. Moreover, Citi&rsquo;s rebalancing model points to modest USD buying vs. peers going into month end, while Nordea also notes tomorrow&rsquo;s HIA which is the cut-off date if companies wish to convert foreign currency into USD along with SOMA that happens to fall on Friday as well. The index is currently hovering above 97.000 within a narrow range around the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; Holding up well vs. the pound above 0.8850 but not quite challenging the 100DMA 0.8884, though the single currency is lower vs. the buck, with the pair tripping some stops at 1.1310. Obviously, 1.1300 is nearest support and if breached more stops are reported at 1.1290.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Reports from a Chinese Ministry spokesman noting US President Trump and Chinese President Xi have agreed to reach a mutually beneficial agreement saw the Japanese currency extend losses vs. the greenback through a Fib level at 113.48 and reaching highs of 113.66 (shy of the next Fib at 113.76), before pairing a bulk of the move as it quickly emerged that the comments were made initially in wake of a phone call between the two leader back on November 1st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD,AUD &ndash; Notable, albeit marginal G10 outperformers vs. the buck, with the Kiwi staging another recovery following the weak data (trade overnight), and now looking ahead to the RBNZ semi-annual FSR tonight. NZD/USD hovering just below 0.6800 and AUD/USD near the middle of a 0.7270-15 band.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, AUD and NZD attempted to nurse partial losses with the latter only briefly pressured after the latest New Zealand trade data showed a wider than expected deficit and slight miss on exports, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses pulled-back as Trump&rsquo;s renewed tariff threats spurred some flows into the safe-haven JPY.<br /><br />New Zealand Trade Balance Oct -1295M vs. Exp. -850M (Prev. -1560.0M, Rev. -1596M).

The attention this week will be on Fed speak (with Powell set to speak twice, while VC Clarida is also on the slate) as well as the FOMC meeting minutes on Thursday, and the G20 meeting towards the end of the week.

ASX 200 (+1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) were lifted from the open with Australia led higher by tech and financials, while a pullback in USD/JPY limited the upside for the Japanese benchmark. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) were mixed with China somewhat dampened by Trump&rsquo;s hardball tactics ahead of the meeting with Chinese President Xi at this week&rsquo;s G20, in which he suggested an intention to proceed with raising tariffs on China imports from 10% to 25% and also warned to place tariffs on the remaining USD 267bln of Chinese imports if they fail to reach a favourable outcome for the US. Furthermore, a slowdown of Chinese Industrial Profit growth and concerns in the Hong Kong property sector also contributed the cautiousness in Chinese markets. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful as prices took a breather from its extended but gradual uptrend and with today&rsquo;s 40yr auction largely ignored despite increases in the b/c and accepted prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for the 23rd consecutive occasion. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.9463 (Prev. 6.9453)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Industrial Profits (Oct) Y/Y 3.6% (Prev. 4.1%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&#39;s spokesman said PM May still believes she can win the meaningful vote on Brexit and is focused on winning first time round, while the meaningful vote is expected on Tuesday 11th December and an official confirmed five days of debate between December 4th to December 11th. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said it sounds like the Brexit deal is a good deal for the EU and that the UK may not be able to trade with the US. However, a UK No. 10 spokesperson later said declaration signed with EU is clear that UK can sign trade deals with the US and that UK has already been laying the groundwork for an ambitious trade deal with the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Nowotny said a well communicated exit from QE may benefit financial health and poses little risk to financial stability, while he added very low rates for a long time may impair stability. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian PM Conte, following a meeting with Deputy PMs Salvini and Di Maio stated that the government will stick to its high-spending budget plans. (BBC) Later it was reported Italy&rsquo;s 2019 deficit/GDP target is almost certain to be 2.2%, while PM Conte reportedly anticipates EUR 3.6bln of budget cuts according to reports in Messagerro. (Messagerro)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX markets were quiet in which the major pairs consolidated after the prior day&rsquo;s price swings. Nonetheless, the DXY struggled to hold above the 97.00 level as EUR/USD and GBP/USD rebounded near Monday&rsquo;s lows at the 1.1300 and 1.2800 handles respectively. Elsewhere, AUD and NZD attempted to nurse partial losses with the latter only briefly pressured after the latest New Zealand trade data showed a wider than expected deficit and slight miss on exports, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses pulled-back as Trump&rsquo;s renewed tariff threats spurred some flows into the safe-haven JPY.<br /><br />New Zealand Trade Balance Oct -1295M vs. Exp. -850M (Prev. -1560.0M, Rev. -1596M). (Newswires)<br />New Zealand Exports Oct 4.86B vs. Exp. 4.88B (Prev. 4.33B, Rev. 4.25B)<br />New Zealand Imports Oct 6.15B vs. Exp. 5.84B (Prev. 5.89B, Rev. 5.84B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities saw tepid trade with WTI crude futures marginally weaker as prices remain pressured by Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s record high production this month and although there were reports the kingdom was said to be keen on output cut agreement, this did little to spur oil prices which have slumped over 20% so far this month. Elsewhere, gold flatlined overnight amid an uneventful greenback, while copper was also subdued in-line with the lacklustre tone across the commodities complex and amid tariff concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia is said to be &quot;keen&quot; for an agreement to cut output despite the US wanting otherwise, while there were separate reports that Ecuador would support an OPEC production cut at meeting next week according to its Energy Minister. (FT/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CME raised January 2019 crude oil futures NYMEX margins by 12.3% to USD 4,100 per contract and raised December RBOB gasoline futures margins by 7% to USD 4600 per contract. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Pompeo said Russia actions in the Kersch Strait is a dangerous escalation and in violation of international law. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />The risk-on mood saw modest selling in the Treasury complex, where yields were higher by between 1-2bps at settlement; major curve spreads were generally little changed, with 2s5s and 2s10s slightly steeper, while 2s30s and 5s30s were narrower. The attention this week will be on Fed speak (with Powell set to speak twice, while VC Clarida is also on the slate) as well as the FOMC meeting minutes on Thursday, and the G20 meeting towards the end of the week. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 4+ ticks lower at 119-04+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he still intends to go ahead with raising tariffs on China imports from 10% to 25% and that it was highly unlikely he would accept China&rsquo;s request to refrain from the increase. Trump also suggested he would place tariffs on the rest of Chinese imports that are currently not subject to tariffs if the US doesn&rsquo;t make a deal with China, while he added tariffs could be placed on Apple iPhones from China and that consumers could stand a 10% tariff on iPhones. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Special Counsel Mueller&#39;s office said former Trump campaign manager Manafort lied to FBI and Special Counsel in violation of plea agreement.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly positive as they take impetus from the performance of their counterparts on Wall St, where all majors finished with firm gains on return from the Thanksgiving weekend with retailers buoyed on the back of Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) were lifted from the open but with weakness in miners capping the tech and financials led advances in Australia, while a pullback in USD/JPY has limited the upside for the Japanese benchmark. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) are mixed with China somewhat dampened by Trump&rsquo;s hardball tactics ahead of the meeting with Chinese President Xi at this week&rsquo;s G20, as he suggested an intention to proceed with raising tariffs on China imports from 10% to 25% and also warned to place tariffs on the rest of Chinese imports if they fail to reach a favourable outcome for the US. Furthermore, a slowdown of Chinese Industrial Profit growth and concerns in the Hong Kong property sector has also added to the somewhat cautious tone in Chinese markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are quiet and have flatlined after the prior day&rsquo;s price swings. As such, the DXY is flat and just about holds on to the 97.00 level as EUR/USD and GBP/USD languish near Monday&rsquo;s lows at the 1.1300 and 1.2800 handles respectively. Elsewhere, AUD and NZD are uneventful with the latter mildly pressured after the latest New Zealand trade data showed a wider than expected deficit and slight miss on exports, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses have pulled-back as Trump&rsquo;s renewed tariff threats spurred some flows into the safe-haven JPY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful as prices take a breather from its extended but gradual uptrend and with participants sidelined ahead of a 40yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
