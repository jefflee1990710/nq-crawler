In related news, the government summary of the draft withdrawal agreement suggested role for parliament in deciding whether to extend the transition or to move in to the backstop, and the UK will guarantee avoiding a hard border including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls according to initial analysis of the draft Brexit agreement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Commission President Juncker said decisive progress has been made in negotiations, while there were also comments from an EU Diplomat that if UK PM May did not reach a deal this evening, the November summit will be called off.

Furthermore, the ERG is said to be frustrated and angry but still hopes PM May will think again and looks like deal she is proposing is unlikely to pass, while a Times reporter suggested the ERG have now switched position and support letters of no confidence in UK PM May. (Twitter/Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were reports that suggest UK PM May no confidence vote will be submitted tomorrow according to BBC, although a BBC reporter stated that it does not look like there are enough letters to spark a challenge to UK PM May yet, though more could be on their way.

Elsewhere, Sky News political correspondent said a DUP MP told him they believe Number 10 has already accepted they need to move forward without DUP support and that if they wanted to try and reassure them, they would have done so by now but &ldquo;there&rsquo;s been nothing&rdquo;. (Newswires/BBC/Sky/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irish PM Varadkar said draft agreement protects Good Friday Agreement and that we may be in a position to have an emergency EU Summit before the end of the month, while he later commented that it is hard to see where we go if Brexit deal is defeated.

Comcast (CMCSA) was a top mover after reports it was collaborating with Nielsen (NLSN) to utilise Xfinity TV data. Facebook (FB) and Home Depot (HD) also traded higher today. PG&amp;E (PCG) tumbled after reports it could be facing liquidity issues due to potential fines for causing the California wild fires; Edison International (EIX) also pushed lower in the wake of the fires. Snap (SNAP) fell today following reports it has been subpoenaed by regulators over claims it misled investors by downplaying its competition at its IPO. Apple (AAPL) was a bottom mover, enters bear market territory after declining nearly 3% after downbeat sentiment from UBS and Guggenheim. US regional banks SVB Financial (SIVB) and Regions Financial (RF) also traded lower on the day. SPX -0.75% at 2701, NDX -0.89% at 6769, DJI -0.81% at 25081.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries ended the session only marginally higher, once again opposing the move in equities which ended in the red on Wednesday. The complex found some sellers ahead of the US CPI report which was broadly in line and traded just off highs after UK PM May received backing on her proposed Brexit deal. The curve was steeper at the close with yields lower by c.3bps at settlement. 5s30s and 2s30s were wider by c.2bps. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 7+ ticks higher at 118-24.</p>\r\n",

The meeting took longer than anticipated. Several hard-line Brexiters have already submitted no-confidence motions against the PM independently, despite the ERG group of Brexiteers not formally requiring its members to do so. Note 48 MPs would be required to submit letters in order to force a confidence vote, after which a simple majority of Conservative Party lawmakers would be needed to oust May. ERG chief Rees-Mogg said he would vote against the deal, though it was not clear whether he had encouraged ERG members to submit motions of no confidence. EU Commission President Juncker stated that &ldquo;decisive progress&rdquo; has been made in negotiations. Looking at the details, the Withdrawal Agreement states that unique circumstances in Ireland require a unique solution whilst the Ireland protocol is intended to apply only temporary, unless and until superseded; it also outlined that the UK can request extension of the transition period any time before July 1st, 2020 and indicates that the EU and the UK shall establish single customs territory while ensuring Northern Ireland is in the same customs territory as Great Britain. The UK will also guarantee avoiding a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>The EU Commission announced they are to publish their opinion of the revised Italian budget for 2019 on November 21st whilst Italian Deputy PM Salvini stated if the EU impose fines on Italy it would be a mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom thinks that if the US imposes car tariffs, the EU will hit back with the ability to set up countermeasures quickly on cars, agricultural products and machinery. She shares criticism voiced by the US on China, adding she has been working intensively but has not received assurances from the US on auto tariffs and has not met with USTR Lighthizer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Vice-Chair for Supervision Quarles (Voter) said that the labour market sustainable and the economy very strong, adding that strong economy can continue for some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Weidmann said that it will take a long time until ECB monetary policy has returned back to a normal setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CPI</strong> rose 0.3% in October pushing the YY headline to 2.5% from 2.3%, in line with consensus. Looking at the breakdown, gains were widespread with higher energy costs cited as the driving factors. Core inflation also rebounded after a number of soft prints, posting at 0.2% and bringing the YY headline to 2.1%, a tad below the 2.2% consensus, reversing completely the large 3% drop in used auto prices seen last month. Looking ahead, Wells Fargo warns that &ldquo;gasoline prices have dropped along with oil and will likely be a drag on inflation in the near term&rdquo; whilst the underlying trend in Core inflation remains modestly higher and is expected to &ldquo;trend up in the year ahead, spurred by more businesses willing to raise prices&rdquo;. Overall the latest report should keep the Fed on its current hiking path.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.75% at 2701, NDX -0.89% at 6769, DJI -0.81% at 25081.</strong> SECTORS: Energy -0.08%, Materials -0.20%, Industrials -0.37%, Cons Discretionary -0.94%, Cons Staples -0.63%, Healthcare -0.85%, Financials -1.36%, Tech -1.29%, Telecoms +0.46%, Utilities -1.13%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>After a bounce back in crude prices, energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and Phillips 66 (PSX) also bounced higher. Comcast (CMCSA) was a top mover after reports it was collaborating with Nielsen (NLSN) to utilise Xfinity TV data. Facebook (FB) and Home Depot (HD) also traded higher today. PG&amp;E (PCG) tumbled after reports it could be facing liquidity issues due to potential fines for causing the California wild fires; Edison International (EIX) also pushed lower in the wake of the fires. Snap (SNAP) fell today following reports it has been subpoenaed by regulators over claims it misled investors by downplaying its competition at its IPO. Apple (AAPL) was a bottom mover, enters bear market territory after declining nearly 3% after downbeat sentiment from UBS and Guggenheim. US regional banks SVB Financial (SIVB) and Regions Financial (RF) also traded lower on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.56 HIGHER AT USD 56.25/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 0.65 HIGHER AT USD 66.12/BBL.</strong> Crude prices found some relief on Wednesday, after a 12th consecutive price drop, rising on supply cut anticipation. The biggest surge today came after OPEC and OPEC+ were reported to be debating a cut in supply by 1.4mln BPD. Elsewhere, the IEA released its monthly report where it showed oil demand growth in 2018 and 2019 unchanged from previously quoted levels and that oil supplies are rising, with Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US offsetting declines from Iran and Venezuela. UAE&rsquo;s Energy Minister said he is confident OPEC+ and Russia will balance the oil market&rsquo;s anticipated inventory build ups in 2019. Russian Economy Minister Oreshkin later said that oil prices may dip even lower in the short term. India&#39;s Nayara Energy will fully shut its 400,000 BPD Vadinar refinery for a month, starting November 21st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 7+ TICKS HIGHER AT 118-24.</strong> Treasuries ended the session only marginally higher, once again opposing the move in equities which ended in the red on Wednesday. The complex found some sellers ahead of the US CPI report which was broadly in line and traded just off highs after UK PM May received backing on her proposed Brexit deal. The curve was steeper at the close with yields lower by c.3bps at settlement. 5s30s and 2s30s were wider by c.2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Sterling endured a roller-coaster session, though is closing out the US session in chipper fashion after UK PM May secured Cabinet support for her Brexit deal. In European trade, GBP managed to rally up to 1.3020 from lows sub-1.29, though gave back gains on reports that PM May will not hold a detailed press conference post the Cabinet meeting; however, after it emerged PM May had secured Cabinet support and as details of the agreement were made public, GBP rallied to HOD above 1.3050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> A late squeeze saw the single currency reclaim 1.1300+ status more convincingly and almost reach 1.1350 where decent option expiries (1.4 bn) rolled off at the NY cut. However, given no further scheduled events on the Italy vs EU budget front until the latter issues its response to the largely unrevised resubmission from Rome next Wednesday, near term direction could depend on technical and a close above or below the 100 HMA at 1.1312.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD, CAD:</strong> Contrasting fortunes for the non-US Dollars as the Kiwi continued to outperform and remained nearer the upper end of 0.6760-0.6800 parameters with the Aud/Nzd cross holding below 1.0650 even though the Aud/Usd managed to rebound above 0.7200 on a broad upturn in risk sentiment and less US-China trade tension. Meanwhile, the Loonie got a lift from an encouraging rebound in oil prices, but then retreated abruptly to sub-1.3250 levels vs closer to 1.3200 when US Democrat Pascrell declared that the NA trade deal will not pass congress in its present form, adding no quick solution to USMCA issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Very restrained within a 113.50-114.00 band and perhaps influenced by option expiry interest like Eur/Usd given that 1.5 bn ran off between 113.90-114.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK, NOK: </strong>Another weak Scandi macro release prompted relative Sek underperformance and the Nok to decline in sympathy, as Swedish CPI missed consensus and raised more doubt over a Riksbank hike in December rather than February 2019. Moreover, efforts to form a new Government were undermined after Parliament rejected the appointment of Kristersson as PM. Eur/Sek tested major tech resistance around 10.2980 vs circa 10.2135 at one stage, while Eur/Nok climbed to just shy of 9.6400 from 9.5850 at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>A positive session for most regional currencies as the Usd back-tracked and crude bounced firmly to potentially end a record losing run. The Rub got extra impetus from the prospect that no further US sanctions will be implemented this year, albeit largely due to the White House devoting time to other policy matters instead.</p>\r\n",

The biggest surge today came after OPEC and OPEC+ were reported to be debating a cut in supply by 1.4mln BPD. Elsewhere, the IEA released its monthly report where it showed oil demand growth in 2018 and 2019 unchanged from previously quoted levels and that oil supplies are rising, with Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US offsetting declines from Iran and Venezuela. UAE&rsquo;s Energy Minister said he is confident OPEC+ and Russia will balance the oil market&rsquo;s anticipated inventory build ups in 2019. Russian Economy Minister Oreshkin later said that oil prices may dip even lower in the short term. India&#39;s Nayara Energy will fully shut its 400,000 BPD Vadinar refinery for a month, starting November 21st.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A real roller-coaster ride for the Pound in the run up to the Cabinet meeting to effectively decide the fate of the Withdrawal Agreement drawn up between UK and EU negotiators on Tuesday amidst a cascade of comments, conjecture, headlines and reports, along with a lively PMQ session. For the record, Cable has been very choppy between 1.2885-1.3035, and Eur/Gbp only a little less volatile within a 0.8740-0.8670 range with a firm rebound in more recent trade largely due to broader USD weakness as the DXY retreated from 97.407 at best to 96.850. Back to Brexit, resignation rumours and denials were rife, with the latest word doing the rounds in Whitehall that Conservative MPs Mourdant and Work and Pension Secretary McVey may resign, while Scotland&rsquo;s Mundell could stay or go. Note, the meeting started at 14GMT and is expected to last for several hours, but PM May has pencilled in 17.30GMT for a call to brief Irish officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A late squeeze saw the single currency reclaim 1.1300+ status more convincingly and almost reach 1.1350 where decent option expiries (1.4 bn) rolled off at the NY cut. However, given no further scheduled events on the Italy vs EU budget front until the latter issues its response to the largely unrevised resubmission from Rome next Wednesday, near term direction could depend on technical and a close above or below the 100 HMA at 1.1312.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes for the non-US Dollars as the Kiwi continued to outperform and remained nearer the upper end of 0.6760-0.6800 parameters with the Aud/Nzd cross holding below 1.0650 even though the Aud/Usd managed to rebound above 0.7200 on a broad upturn in risk sentiment and less US-China trade tension. Meanwhile, the Loonie got a lift from an encouraging rebound in oil prices, but then retreated abruptly to sub-1.3250 levels vs closer to 1.3200 when US Democrat Pascrell declared that the NA trade deal will not pass congress in its present form, adding no quick solution to USMCA issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very restrained within a 113.75-114.00 band and perhaps influenced by option expiry interest like Eur/Usd given that 1.5 bn ran off between 113.90-114.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another weak Scandi macro release prompted relative Sek underperformance and the Nok to decline in sympathy, as Swedish CPI missed consensus and raised more doubt over a Riksbank hike in December rather than February 2019. Moreover, efforts to form a new Government were undermined after Parliament rejected the appointment of Kristersson as PM. Eur/Sek tested major tech resistance around 10.2980 vs circa 10.2135 at one stage, while Eur/Nok climbed to just shy of 9.6400 from 9.5850 at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A positive session for most regional currencies as the Usd back-tracked and crude bounced firmly to potentially end a record losing run. The Rub got extra impetus from the prospect that no further US sanctions will be implemented this year, albeit largely due to the White House devoting time to other policy matters instead.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) were also downbeat as participants digested mostly uninspiring releases from China including softer than expected New Yuan Loans, Aggregate Financing and Retail Sales, although Industrial Production and Fixed Assets Investment data topped estimates. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as the lacklustre risk tone across the region underpinned demand and in which upside gained traction as the Japanese benchmark stock index momentarily gave up all its gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Furthermore, a Number 10 source said PM May will tell the Cabinet (at 1400GMT/same time that representatives of EU governments will meet) the negotiation has been pushed as far as it can go and the UK cannot get any better deal than this one, while PM May is said to be firmly of the view that the deal will not be improved by dragging it out any longer. (Twitter/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sun&#39;s Political Editor Tom Newton Dunn also tweeted details of the Irish backstop which include a UK-wide customs union and no NI-only version which he notes is a win for the UK, while there will also be an independent panel to arbitrate a &lsquo;good faith&rsquo; end mechanism. In addition, there will be no backstop end date or time limit and that a full level playing field of rules will apply throughout. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whitehall official said the Cabinet will have to decide in the next few weeks if a no-deal is to be the main planning scenario for Brexit and that December 1st could be a key date for it, while there were also reports that PM May is to warn the Cabinet of Brexit deadline for contingencies in case the agreement falls. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU sources say they envisage a July 2020 decision on the future of the Irish border, where the UK could extend the transition period once if there is no new trade deal.

He&#39;s warned that from a legal perspective it will be very difficult to enforce &amp; therefore to get out of.&nbsp; His advice will be critical in how today plays out. From what I&#39;ve heard exit mechanism hinges on demonstrating during backstop that EU has failed to show good faith - known as &#39;best endeavours&#39; - &amp; UK is entitled to break off.

Sectors are mixed with energy names and materials lagging whilst utilities lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Smiths Group (+6.3%) are in the green after confirming their full year management expectations and spinning-off their Healthcare unit. E.ON (+2.5%) are firmer after reporting a beat on earnings, Wirecard (-4.0%) are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 post-earnings, whilst Rio Tinto (-3.0%) shares have been hampered after a downgrade at Liberum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - It&rsquo;s Brexit day for the Pound, or at least another pivotal moment in the process towards reaching a deal before the UK officially leaves the EU as the Cabinet decides whether to back or reject the withdrawal agreement. The session kicks off at 14GMT and the outcome remains uncertain even though PM May appears to have persuaded key Ministers to vote in favour, as the minority DUP coalition partner has already indicated its strong opposition. Hence, some retracement in Sterling from the highs seen when news broke that UK and EU negotiators had finally agreed resolved the outstanding issues, with Cable back below 1.3000 and almost retesting 1.2900 on negative legal observations on the terms of the backstop, while Eur/Gbp is firmly back above 0.8700. Note, benign inflation data has also kept the Pound in consolidative/defensive mode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency remains partly in lock-step with the Gbp on Brexit-related moves, but also depressed by the ongoing Italian-EU budget stand-off and further evidence of slowing momentum in the Eurozone economy, with German GDP weaker than forecast in Q3. Eur/Usd has lost grip of 1.1300 as a result, and from a technical perspective is back below the 100 HMA at 1.1312.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - More divergence down under, as cross-winds continue to favour the Kiwi over the Aud, while the latter also took heed of some mixed Chinese data overnight. Aud/Nzd is only just above 1.0600, with Aud/Usd retreating from 0.7200+ yet again vs Nzd/Usd maintaining a firmer line within 0.6755-0.6800 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - Another weak Scandi macro release has seen the Sek underperform and Nok decline in sympathy, as Swedish CPI missed consensus and raised more doubt over a Riksbank hike in December rather than February 2019. Moreover, the domestic political backdrop remains clouded as PM candidate Kristersson did not get Parliament consent to try and form a new Government. Eur/Sek up to 10.2980 and toughing strong chart resistance vs circa 10.2135 at one stage, Eur/Nok just shy of 9.6400 from 9.5850 at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.3%) and WTI (+0.1%) break their downward streak, following sources reporting that OPEC+ are debating a 1.4mln BPD oil supply reduction. This followed today&rsquo;s IEA monthly stating that OPEC crude output rose by 200kbpd in October, which is up 240k compared to last year; and Q3 stocks posting their largest gain since 2015. At the time, this added to the recent downward pressure on prices before the aforementioned sources suggesting an OPEC+ supply reduction. Of note, we APIs will be released today due to Monday&#39;s Veterans Day Holiday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.1%) is marginally softer amidst a firmer dollar with Gold breaching USD 1200/oz to the downside and unable to benefit from the current risk environment. Separately, shanghai rebar prices have recovered from recent lows, as expectations of economic stimulus from Beijing offsets record October steel output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK debt and STIR contracts are building some positive momentum or simply a hedge and an insurance premium in the event that the Brexit deal fails at the first hurdle, with the Cabinet vote far from certain, let alone its passage through Parliament. Indeed, the core 10 year bond has advanced further from an initial 12 tick mark-up to 122.06 compared to Tuesday&rsquo;s 121.74 close, while the 3 month strip has been 1-2 ticks ahead vs flat to a tick down off the Liffe open. Moreover, a market contact and subscriber notes upside (dovish) positioning via options with the Sep19 99.375/99.50 call spread bought for 0.8 tick in a hefty 39k lots (vs 98.86 in the underlying at present). Back to debt futures, Bunds have seen a fraction more upside, at 160.38 (+30 ticks) as BTPs retreat further to a 120.59 low (-113 ticks), but not enough to trigger intraday short covering yet, with the next/nearest chart resistance level beyond that at 160.45.</p>\r\n",

Sectors are red across the board&nbsp;with losses relatively broad-based</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Smiths Group (+5.5%) are in the green after confirming their full year management expectations and spinning-off their Healthcare unit.&nbsp;E.ON (+2.5%) are firmer after reporting a beat on earnings, Wirecard (-4.0%) are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 post-earnings, whilst Rio Tinto (-3.0%) shares have been hampered after a downgrade at Liberum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - It&rsquo;s Brexit day for the Pound, or at least another pivotal moment in the process towards reaching a deal before the UK officially leaves the EU as the Cabinet decides whether to back or reject the withdrawal agreement. The session kicks off at 14GMT and the outcome remains uncertain even though PM May appears to have persuaded key Ministers to vote in favour, as the minority DUP coalition partner has already indicated its strong opposition. Hence, some retracement in Sterling from the highs seen when news broke that UK and EU negotiators had finally agreed resolved the outstanding issues, with Cable back below 1.3000 and Eur/Gbp retesting 0.8700. Note, benign inflation data has also kept the Pound in consolidative/defensive mode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency remains partly in lock-step with the Gbp on Brexit-related moves, but also depressed by the ongoing Italian-EU budget stand-off and further evidence of slowing momentum in the Eurozone economy, with German GDP weaker than forecast in Q3. Eur/Usd has lost grip of 1.1300 as a result, and from a technical perspective is back below the 100 HMA at 1.1312.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - More divergence down under, as cross-winds continue to favour the Kiwi over the Aud, while the latter also took heed of some mixed Chinese data overnight. Aud/Nzd is only just above 1.0600, with Aud/Usd retreating from 0.7200+ yet again vs Nzd/Usd maintaining a firmer line within 0.6755-0.6800 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - Another weak Scandi macro release has seen the Sek underperform and Nok decline in sympathy, as Swedish CPI missed consensus and raised more doubt over a Riksbank hike in December rather than February 2019. Moreover, the domestic political backdrop remains clouded as PM candidate Kristersson did not get Parliament consent to try and form a new Government. Eur/Sek up to 10.2980 and toughing strong chart resistance vs circa 10.2135 at one stage, Eur/Nok just shy of 9.6400 from 9.5850 at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK debt and STIR contracts are building some positive momentum or simply a hedge and an insurance premium in the event that the Brexit deal fails at the first hurdle, with the Cabinet vote far from certain, let alone its passage through Parliament. Indeed, the core 10 year bond has advanced further from an initial 12 tick mark-up to 122.06 compared to Tuesday&rsquo;s 121.74 close, while the 3 month strip has been 1-2 ticks ahead vs flat to a tick down off the Liffe open. Moreover, a market contact and subscriber notes upside (dovish) positioning via options with the Sep19 99.375/99.50 call spread bought for 0.8 tick in a hefty 39k lots (vs 98.86 in the underlying at present). Back to debt futures, Bunds have seen a fraction more upside, at 160.38 (+30 ticks) as BTPs retreat further to a 120.59 low (-113 ticks), but not enough to trigger intraday short covering yet, with the next/nearest chart resistance level beyond that at 160.45.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.7%) and WTI (+0.2%) break their downward streak, following sources reporting that OPEC+ are debating a 1.4mln BPD oil supply reduction. This followed today&rsquo;s IEA monthly stating that OPEC crude output rose by 200kbpd in October, which is up 240k compared to last year; and Q3 stocks posting their largest gain since 2015. At the time, this added to the recent downward pressure on prices before the aforementioned sources suggesting an OPEC+ supply reduction. Of note, we APIs will be released today due to Monday&#39;s Veterans Day Holiday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (-0.1%) is marginally softer amidst a firmer dollar with Gold breaching USD 1200/oz to the downside and unable to benefit from the current risk environment. Separately, shanghai rebar prices have recovered from recent lows, as expectations of economic stimulus from Beijing offsets record October steel output.</p>\r\n",

The session kicks off at 14GMT and the outcome remains uncertain even though PM May appears to have persuaded key Ministers to vote in favour, as the minority DUP coalition partner has already indicated its strong opposition. Hence, some retracement in Sterling from the highs seen when news broke that UK and EU negotiators had finally agreed resolved the outstanding issues, with Cable back below 1.3000 and Eur/Gbp retesting 0.8700. Note, benign inflation data has also kept the Pound in consolidative/defensive mode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency remains partly in lock-step with the Gbp on Brexit-related moves, but also depressed by the ongoing Italian-EU budget stand-off and further evidence of slowing momentum in the Eurozone economy, with German GDP weaker than forecast in Q3. Eur/Usd has lost grip of 1.1300 as a result, and from a technical perspective is back below the 100 HMA at 1.1312.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;More divergence down under, as cross-winds continue to favour the Kiwi over the Aud, while the latter also took heed of some mixed Chinese data overnight. Aud/Nzd is only just above 1.0600, with Aud/Usd retreating from 0.7200+ yet again vs Nzd/Usd maintaining a firmer line within 0.6755-0.6800 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another weak Scandi macro release has seen the Sek underperform and Nok decline in sympathy, as Swedish CPI missed consensus and raised more doubt over a Riksbank hike in December rather than February 2019. Moreover, the domestic political backdrop remains clouded as PM candidate Kristersson did not get Parliament consent to try and form a new Government. Eur/Sek up to 10.2980 and toughing strong chart resistance vs circa 10.2135 at one stage, Eur/Nok just shy of 9.6400 from 9.5850 at the low.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.7%) was led lower by weakness in energy names after WTI crude fell nearly 8% on its record 12th consecutive decline, while Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) shrugged off a contraction to GDP data with the benchmark index kept afloat for most the session by JPY weakness and as automakers cheered reports the US was said to be planning to hold off on implementing auto tariffs for now. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) were also downbeat as participants digested mostly uninspiring releases from China including softer than expected New Yuan Loans, Aggregate Financing and Retail Sales, although Industrial Production and Fixed Assets Investment data topped estimates. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as the lacklustre risk tone across the region underpinned demand and in which upside gained traction as the Japanese benchmark stock index momentarily gave up all its gains.</p>\r\n",
