(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell said that recent data has increased his confidence that inflation will move higher, while he added that he expects wages to increase this year and that if Fed falls behind the curve they will have to raise rates faster. Fed&#39;s Powell suggested a course of gradual removal of stimulus and said that since December - where the median dot pencilled in three hikes - information points to a stronger economy. Elsewhere, in his statement, Powell dismissed the recent market volatility, reiterating that current settings remain accommodative, and financial conditions were not weighing on the economy. On a rules-based approach, Powell said they can be helpful, though require &#39;careful judgement.&#39; (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following Powell&#39;s testimony and Q&amp;A, the probability of three hikes in 2018 was up to 73% (from 60% at the close on Tuesday), while the probability of four hikes rose to 34% (versus 24% on Tuesday).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Discount Rate Minutes stated that Dallas Fed wanted to hike discount rate at the January meeting by a quarter percentage point from its current 2% rate due to solid growth, tight labor-market and an expected rise in inflation toward 2%. Furthermore, the minutes noted that Directors were optimistic on the effect of tax cuts and the economic outlook.

The buck&#39;s gains were broad-based, pushing the EUR down to 1.2250, with the single currency softer against most counterparts. Havens also were sold on USD strength, with USDJPY rising above 107.50, and USDCHF gaining to above 0.94, though the air proved thin at those levels. XAU, meanwhile, dropped by over $15 to trade beneath $1320 as the prospects of policy normalisation takes the shine off gold. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After failing to rise above the 1.40 handle in early EU trade, cable succumbed to USD strength, printing lows of 1.3855 before the European close; that weakness was faded, however, taking GBP to 1.3930 heading into Asia; Sterling took advantage of the EUR weakness, with the pound clearly not taking its cues from downbeat Brexit newsflow, with the EUR side of the pair driving the action. Banks have been suggesting sterling traders seem more inclined to trade on Brexit fact rather than Brexit speculation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD, AUD, and NZD all took their cues from the greenback, and were given little support from the commodity complex. Aussie traders will be keeping their powder dry ahead of the Aussie capex data out on Thursday, and the RBA on 6/March. For NZD, technicians were noting the break of 0.7280 trend-line that has been in play since December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMFX was generally weaker. The ZAR was hit on reports that South Africa&#39;s parliament approves motion to go ahead with land expropriation without compensation.

(KCNA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a roller coaster ride for equities with futures starting the day on the back-foot in sympathy with the weakness in Europe. The cash day began positive but was then hit after Fed chair Powell&#39;s testimony was perceived to be a touch hawkish, raising the prospects of four hikes in 2018. Elsewhere, reports that President Trump had hired a strategist for a 2020 campaign provided some temporary reprieve, but this was short-lived as Powell&#39;s optimistic comments on inflation added further pressure on stocks which continued to sell-off into the close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stellar earnings from Macy&#39;s did little to buoy consumer discretionary shares, despite its own shares rising 11%. The energy sector was a better performer after IEA chief Birol said US output would rise to over 11mln BPD this year, and the US would take the mantel of the world&#39;s largest producer; subsequently E&amp;P names in the energy sector were firmer, though the energy sector as a whole couldn&#39;t remain green. Finally, SPX -1.26% at 2744, DJI -1.16% at 25410, NDX -1.3% at 6900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top sectors: Financials -0.9%, IT -1% and Industrials -1.2%<br />Bottom sectors: Cons. Discretionary -2.1%, Telecom -1.8% and Utilities -1.7%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields were higher across the curve after Powell&rsquo;s testimony was judged as upbeat, cementing at least three hikes in 2018, while seemingly retaining the optionality of four hikes, should the situation warrant. The probability of three hikes in 2018 rose to 73% (from 60% at the close on Tuesday), while the probability of four rate rises rose to 34% (versus 24% on Tuesday). 5s30s spread flattened by around 4bps to within touching distance of 50bps following the testimony and Q&amp;A of Fed chair Powell. 2s30s was 2bps flatter, and 10s30s was ,2bps flatter; though 2s5s and 2s10s widened slightly. US T-Note (H8) settled 14 ticks lower at 120-12+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES:&nbsp;SPX -1.26% at 2744, DJI -1.16% at 25410, NDX -1.3% at 6900</strong><br />* Top sectors: Financials -0.9%, IT -1% and Industrials -1.2%<br />* Bottom sectors:&nbsp;Cons. Discretionary -2.1%, Telecom -1.8% and Utilities -1.7%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* It was a roller coaster ride for equities&nbsp;with futures starting the day on the back-foot in sympathy with the weakness in Europe. The cash day began positive, but was hit after Fed chair Powell&#39;s testimony was perceived to be a touch hawkish, raising the prospects of four hikes in 2018, and piling pressure on equities. Reports that President Trump had hired a strategist for a 2020 campaign provided some temporary reprieve, but even this was short-lived; after Powell&#39;s optimistic comments on inflation, stocks skidded lower again, continuing to sell-off into the close.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Stellar earnings from Macy&#39;s did little to buoy consumer discretionary shares, despite its own shares rising 11%. The energy sector was a better performer after IEA chief Birol&nbsp;said US output would rise to over 11mln BPD this year, and the US would take the mantel of the world&#39;s largest producer; subsequently E&amp;P names in the energy sector were firmer, though the energy sector as a whole couldn&#39;t remain green.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* European equities began on a firm footing, though were led lower by the DAX, after&nbsp;German Federal Administrative Court rejected an appeal paved the way for diesel cars to be banned in some cities in Germany, weighing on DAI, BMW, VOW3.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME: 2y 2.2660% (+3.6bps), 5y 2.6720% (+6.7bps), 10y 2.9081% (+4.9bps), 30y 3.1745% (+2bps)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* US T-Note (H8) settled 14 ticks lower at&nbsp;120-12+&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Yields were higher across the curve after Powell&rsquo;s testimony was judged as upbeat, cementing at least three hikes in 2018, while seemingly retaining the optionality of four hikes, should the situation warrant.&nbsp;The probability of three hikes in 2018 rose to 73% (from 60% at the close on Tuesday), while the probability of four rate rises rose to 34% (versus 24% on Tuesday).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* 5s30s spread flattened by around 4bps to within touching distance of 50bps following the testimony and Q&amp;A of Fed chair Powell. 2s30s was 2bps flatter, and 10s30s was ,2bps flatter; though 2s5s and 2s10s widened slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* US supply of 4-week bills tailed by 2.25bps, while the 1yr auction tailed y 0.75bps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 90 cents lower at USD 63.01 per barrel;&nbsp;Brent futures settle 87 cents lower at USD 66.63 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* There was little by way of bullish catalysts for crude on Tuesday, ahead of inventory data which is expected to show a build to headline crude stocks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* IEA Chief Birol said the US is set to be largest oil producer by next year, overtaking Russia; sees US output exceeding 11mln bpd by late 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Iraqi oil production is around 4.35mln bpd, according to Iraq oil ministry official; Iraq was reported to be in discussions with the KRG to resume oil exports through the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline, and later in the day, the Iraqi PM said exports through the pipeline would resume &#39;soon.&#39;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* OPEC officials will meet in Saudi Arabia in April to discuss output pact deal, Algeria&#39;s oil min said. OPEC are also to be meeting with US shale producers next Monday, according to some reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* This week&rsquo;s inventory exps: Crude +2.7mln, Cush -0.88mln, Dist -0.7mln, Gaso -0.6mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX:&nbsp;DXY +0.6% heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*&nbsp;<strong>DXY&nbsp;</strong>heads into APAC trade on the front-foot, after testimony by Fed chair Powell raised the probability of four hikes in 2018. The buck&#39;s gains were broad-based, pushing the&nbsp;<strong>EUR&nbsp;down </strong>to 1.2250, with the single currency softer against most counterparts. Havens also were sold on USD strength, with&nbsp;<strong>USDJPY&nbsp;</strong>rising above 107.50, and&nbsp;<strong>USDCHF&nbsp;</strong>gaining to above 0.94, though the air proved thin at those levels.&nbsp;<strong>XAU,&nbsp;</strong>meanwhile, dropped by over $15 to trade beneath $1320 as the prospects of policy normalisation takes the shine off gold.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* After failing to rise above the 1.40 handle in early EU trade,&nbsp;<strong>cable&nbsp;</strong>succumbed to USD strength, printing lows of 1.3855 before the European close; that weakness was faded, however, taking GBP to 1.3930 heading into Asia; Sterling took advantage of the EUR weakness, with the pound clearly not taking its cues from downbeat Brexit newsflow, with the EUR side of the pair driving the action. Banks have been suggesting sterling traders seem more inclined to trade on Brexit fact rather than Brexit speculation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*&nbsp;<strong>CAD, AUD,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>NZD&nbsp;</strong>all took their cues from the greenback, and were given little support from the commodity complex. Aussie traders will be keeping their powder dry ahead of the Aussie capex data out on Thursday, and the RBA on 6/March. For NZD, technicians were noting the break of 0.7280 trend-line that has been in play since December.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EMFX was generally weaker. The&nbsp;<strong>ZAR&nbsp;</strong>was hit on reports that&nbsp;South Africa&#39;s parliament approves motion to go ahead with land expropriation without compensation.&nbsp;<strong>BRL&nbsp;</strong>was weaker after reporting a wider government primary deficit than analysts had forecast.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TUESDAY 27 FEB 2018 SPEAKERS&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Fed&#39;s Powell suggested a course of gradual removal of stimulus, underscoring his role as a continuity Fed chair. Powell said that since December -- where the median dot pencilled in three hikes -- information points to a stronger economy, though stopped short of &#39;prejudging&#39; where the FOMC will place its median dot. Powell said the economic outlook &quot;remains strong&quot; and added that &quot;some of the headwinds the US economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,&quot; referring to fiscal policy (which has become more stimulative) and foreign demand due to a growing global economy. Powell was upbeat on inflation,&nbsp;stating that recent data has increased his confidence that inflation will move higher, adding that some of the shortfall in inflation seen last year reflects transitory influences that are not expected to be repeated. Elsewhere, in his statement, Powell dismissed the recent market volatility, reiterating that current settings remain accommodative, and financial conditions were not weighing on the economy. On a rules-based approach, Powell said they can be helpful, though require &#39;careful judgement.&#39; Following Powell&#39;s testimony and Q&amp;A, the probability of three hikes in 2018 was up to 73% (from 60% at the close on Tuesday), while the probability of four hikes rose to 34% (versus 24% on Tuesday).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* ECB Weidmann sees inflation rising to target with strong EZ growth. Evidence that FX moves having smaller impact on inflation than before. If recovery continues, no reason ECB cannot end QE in 2018 in &#39;gradual and dependable&#39; manner, which will take a long time. Said a 2019 ECB rate hike not unrealistic. Easing bias to be discussed in future meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* ECB&#39;s Mersch (EB, hawk) avoided monpol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Riksbank Dep Gov Jochnik reiterated the central bank&#39;s views on weaker services inflation and wages. On the SEK, she noted that the currency was not too weak at current levels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-----------------------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TUESDAY 27 FEB 2018 DATA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-----------------------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* US durable goods (Jan) -3.7% was worse than the -2% expected, and the sharpest decline in six-months, while the prior was revised lower slightly. Some analysts noted that while the headline indicates a grim start to 2018, business investment was still firm, and will remain supported by global growth, a weak dollar and US tax cuts. After the data, the Atlanta Fed GDPnow tracker was cut to 2.6% (from 3.2%), and the Barclays Q1 tracker was cut to 1.9% (from 2.0%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* US consumer confidence (Feb) rises to 130.8 -- beating expectations of 126.6 and the prior 125.4 -- and rising to the highest since the end-2000. Analysts said the data adds to the evidence that consumer sentiment is on a firm footing, particularly the rises in present situation and expectations indices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*&nbsp;US Adv Goods Trade Balance (Jan) -74.40B vs. Exp. -72.30B (Prev. -71.58B).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* GE CPI/regional CPIs: Regional CPIs took a softer tone, in line with what was expected from the national print. National CPI&#39;s slightly softer than expected (1.4% y/y vs 1.6% y/y, HICP 1.2% y/y vs exp 1.3% and prev 1.4%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EZ business/consumer surveys: Downbeat, as expected, but the periphery was much better than the core. (Pantheon)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EZ Money supply: Decent; focus on rebound in M1 and improving trend in private lending. M3 money supply growth in the Eurozone was unchanged at 4.6% year-over-year in January, in line with the consensus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TUESDAY 27 FEB 2018 NEWS HEADLINES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><strong>US NEWS:</strong><br /><br />* US President Trump said to have hired Republican digital strategist Brad Parscale to serve as campaign manager on his 2020 reelection campaign, Drudge reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*&nbsp;Fed Discount Rate Minutes: Dallas Fed wanted to hike discount rate at the January meeting. Dallas wanted to increase in the discount rate by a quarter percentage point from its current 2% rate due to solid growth, tight labor-market, an expected rise in inflation toward 2%. Minutes note that Directors were optimistic on the effect of tax cuts, and the economic outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Senate number two Republican Cornyn says Congress may not have enough time to address infrastructure this year<br /><br /><strong>EUROPEAN NEWS:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* UK For Min said UK should not remain subject to ECJ warnings.&nbsp;UK trade min Fox said UK cannot stay in EU customs union following Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* UK French President Macron said a customs union agreement with the UK after Brexit is possible, however would not give full access to single market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*&nbsp;EU&#39;s Barnier is concerned about the time left to complete a Brexit deal, stated that there are significant points of disagreement with the UK over the transition period; and that an open-ended transition is not possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*&nbsp;EU to propose keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union and single market after Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Hungary central bank holds rates at 0.90%, as expected; no announcements of additional easing yet (some had flagged as a possible risk). Analysts said this suggests it is satisfied with the effect of its IRS auctions on bringing longer-term rates down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL NEWS:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* North and South Korea said to have held working-level discussions, North Korean state media, KCNA, reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WEDNESDAY 28 FEB 2018 CALENDAR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>28 FEBRUARY HIGHLIGHTS ON THE DOCKET:</strong><br />In the day: EU to release draft UK withdrawal agreement text<br />0001 UK GFK Consumer confidence (Feb) (exp -10, prev -9)<br />0100 CH NBS Non-mfg PMI (Feb) (prev 55.3) &amp; mfg PMI&nbsp; (Feb) (exp 51.2, prev 51.3)<br />0700 GE GFK Consumer sentiment (Feb) (exp 10.9, prev 11.0)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TU Trade data (Jan)<br />0830 SW GDP (Q4) (exp 3.4% y/y, prev 2.9%; exp 1.0% q/q, prev 0.8%)<br />0900 GE Unemployment Rate (Feb) (exp 5.4% unch), change exp -15k (prev -25k)<br />1000 EZ Inflation (Feb, flash) (exp 1.2% y/y, prev 1.3%); core inflation (exp 1.1% y/y, prev 1.2%)<br />1330 US GDP (Q4, 2nd) (exp 2.5%, prev 2.6%), and breakdown<br />1445 US Chicago PMI (Feb) (exp 64.2, prev 65.7)<br />1500 US Pending home sales (Jan)<br />1530 US EIA Weekly Inventories<br />2145 NZ Terms of trade (Q4)<br />2350 JN Weekly portfolio flows</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WEDNESDAY SPEAKERS:&nbsp;</strong><br />1000 Norgesbank&#39;s Gov Olsen<br />1300 ECB&#39;s Angeloni<br />1600 Riskbank&#39;s Gov Ingves</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WEDNESDAY SUPPLY:</strong><br />1030 Germany sells 3bln of 10yr notes</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WEDNESDAY US EARNINGS:&nbsp;</strong><br />Pre-market: LOW, AZO, MYL, ADI, TJX<br />After-market: MNST, CRM</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/18678/download\">Detailed calendar available in the RANsquawk research suite</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Powell said that since December -- where the median dot penciled in three hikes -- information points to a stronger economy, though stopped short of &#39;prejudging&#39; where the FOMC will place its median dot.<br />-&nbsp;Powell said the economic outlook &quot;remains strong&quot; and added that &quot;some of the headwinds the US economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,&quot; referring to fiscal policy (which has become more stimulative) and foreign demand due to a growing global economy.<br />-&nbsp;Powell was upbeat on inflation,&nbsp;stating that recent data has increased his confidence that inflation will move higher, adding that some of the shortfall in inflation seen last year reflects transitory influences that are not expected to be repeated.<br />-&nbsp;Elsewhere, in his statement, Powell dismissed the recent market volatility, reiterating that current settings remain accommodative, and financial conditions were not weighing on the economy.<br />-&nbsp;On a rules-based approach, Powell said they can be helpful, though require &#39;careful judgement.&#39; Following Powell&#39;s testimony and Q&amp;A, the probability of three hikes in 2018 was up to 73% (from 60% at the close on Tuesday), while the probability of four hikes rose to 34% (versus 24% on Tuesday).&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The new Fed chair didn&rsquo;t really alter the narrative of further gradual policy normalisation and a likely 3 hikes this year, but said enough (including inflation and wages expected to pick-up) to augment reported RHS interest for month end in the standard Usd/G10 and other major pairings (along with social media reports that Trump will declare intentions to contest a 2<sup>nd</sup> Presidential term in 2020). Hence, the DXY managed to recapture the 90.000 handle, as Eur/Usd and Cable both retreated (former back below 1.2300 and latter further away from 1.4000) and Usd/Jpy climbed back above 107.00 to a circa 107.25 peak. Note, end of February Dollar demand is said to be especially strong vs the Jpy and reported Japanese exporter offers just above the big figure were absorbed as the headline pair bounced. Elsewhere, Nzd/Usd almost tested 0.7250 bids/support having reversed from 0.7300+ levels overnight following disappointing NZ trade data, and similar factors undermined the Sek (new 10.0900+ multi-year lows vs the Eur) and Mxn. Usd/Zar spiked on reports that the SA parliament gave the green light for land expropriation without compensation. Usd/Cad rebounded from sub-1.2700 levels to around 1.2735 eyeing Canada&rsquo;s Federal Budget, and back to the Kiwi a speech by RBNZ Deputy Governor Bascand later tonight could provide some independent impetus.</p>\r\n",

But Mr. Powell&#39;s description of the economy - &quot;the economic outlook remains strong... the near term risks [are] roughly balanced&quot; - marks no change from the final FOMC statement from the Yellen Fed. Mr. Powell twice pointed out that fiscal policy is becoming &quot;more stimulative&quot;,and that prior headwinds &quot;have turned into tailwinds&quot; - but he has not chosen yet to use this as a reason to shift the Fed&#39;s base case that policy needs to be tightened only &quot;gradually&quot;; it remains &quot;accommodative&quot; for now. Expect Dems on the Committee to push him hard on the advisability of big unfunded tax cuts at this point in the cycle; expect Mr. Powell to sit on the fence. In short, this Testimony does not change the near-term outlook for policy, but Mr. Powell&rsquo;s willingness to look closely at a more rules-based approach potentially could lead to changes in how the Fed operates in the future. We still look for four hikes this year, and three next year.&quot;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>WHEN</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text of Testimony to be released on Tuesday 27<sup>th</sup> February 2018 at 1330GMT/0830EST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday 27<sup>th</sup> February at 1500GMT/1000EST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday 1<sup>st</sup> March at 1500GMT/1000EST</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PREVIEW</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell will deliver his first monetary policy testimony to Congress, beginning on Tuesday in front of the House Financial Services Committee and continuing on Thursday in front of the Senate Banking Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Powell is widely expected to follow a similar path to Janet Yellen and reiterate that further gradual increases in the Fed Funds Rate (FFR) are warranted. With a March rate hike appearing to be a forgone conclusion, it would take a huge dovish u-turn from Powell for the Fed to delay hiking next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets will instead be looking at the comments for any clues on whether four 25bps rate hikes in 2018 are likely. Back in his testimony ahead of getting confirmed as Fed Chair, Powell said that risks to the economy appeared to be balanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The median rate projection of the FOMC last December called for three 25bps rate hikes in 2018, and we expect Powell&rsquo;s comments to be supportive of this outlook,&rdquo; writes HSBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Powell would most likely prefer to keep the option of a fourth hike in 2018 open without so much as confirming it. &ldquo;A clear majority of the FOMC, including its new Chairman, will want the optionality on the table of a potential, perhaps even probable, fourth rate hike this year,&rdquo; writes SGH Macro Advisers. &ldquo;But our sense is that Powell and most of his Committee colleagues will not want to signal the fourth rate move as a given in either the testimony or, we suspect, the March meeting.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On inflation, the Fed had previously categorised inflation weakness as &ldquo;transitory,&rdquo; (in his November confirmation hearing, Powell himself alluded to uncertainty regarding the path of inflation). However, the recent CPI data and average hourly earnings data both point to an acceleration in price pressures. The focus is on how Powell frames the recent firming. UBS believes Powell will likely project increased confidence that inflation will rise to target this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FED POLICY FRAMEWORK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of policymakers, including Rosengren and Mester, have recently spoken about how they&rsquo;d like a review of the Fed&rsquo;s policy framework. HSBC speculate that the topic could come up in the Q&amp;A and markets will be looking for whether Powell would be open to reviewing the policy framework and his thoughts on alternatives to the current 2% inflation target, whether that be price-level targeting or a target-range for inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MARKET VOLATILITY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent market volatility has been attributed to inflationary pressures forcing traders to reprice their expectations of the Fed hiking cycle. After the FOMC&rsquo;s experience of the &lsquo;taper tantrum&rsquo; in 2013, it will be cautious about managing market expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At his swearing-in ceremony Powell alluded to the recent market volatility, stating that the Fed will &ldquo;remain alert&rdquo; to any financial stability risks presented by market gyrations. &ldquo;He will labor to avoid even a whiff of baby-sitting a wobbly stock market with a &lsquo;Powell put&rsquo; readiness to intervene,&rdquo; SGH writes. &ldquo;But he will be equally forceful in affirming the Fed will not rush to raise rates against what it believes will be a rising but hardly accelerationist inflation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Chinese markets were negative&nbsp;in which the <strong>Hang Seng (-0.7%)</strong> was choppy and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%)</strong> was the laggard after the PBoC refrained from open market operations. Furthermore, press reports also noted that China is facing tight liquidity conditions in March and that the PBoC could raise rates on open market operations next month following an anticipated Fed hike. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat despite the upside in riskier assets, with prices contained at the 151.00 level while today&rsquo;s 2yr auction results were also encouraging with b/c and accepted prices higher than previous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations and cited relatively high liquidity in the banking system.

(FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French President Macron says a customs union agreement with the UK after Brexit is possible, however would not give full access to single market. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ECB&#39;s Weidmann says if economic upswing continues and prices rise there should be no reason not to end QE this year. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Evidence that movements in FX are having a smaller impact on inflation than previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Bigger QE reduction and clear end date to the bond buying programme would have been justifiable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Important to gradually and dependably reduce stimulus when inflation allows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- ECB rate hike in 2019 is not completely unrealistic. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities (Eurostoxx 50 flat, DAX flat) have seen a relatively directionless start to the session after post-Asia-Pac opening gains were trimmed. Taking a look at the sectors, consumer discretionary is the notable outperformer, lifted by Sky (+21%) after Comcast made an offer of GBP 12.50/shr for the Co., subsequently posing a threat to FOX&rsquo;s (FOXA) offer for the Co. Elsewhere, UK homebuilders are firmer this morning following the latest earnings update from Persimmon (+11%) which has lifted some of its competitors higher in sympathy; Berkeley Group (BKG LN) +2.3%, Barratt Developments (+2.1%) and Taylor Wimpey (+1.7%). Finally, Provident Financial (+74%) tops the Stoxx 600 after announcing its rights issue and settlement with the FCA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Above average Dollar demand for end of February FX portfolios seems to be keeping the broader Usd afloat as the DXY meanders around the mid-point of a tight 89.690-830 range. Currency markets also erring on the side of caution ahead of Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s House testimony and (potentially) any further clues about risks around the FOMC consensus for 3 hikes in 2018. Indeed, individual G10 pairs are equally restrained within narrow bands, with Eur/Usd holding between 1.2300-50 amidst mixed EZ inflation data (German states soft, so far vs firmer Spanish headline and harmonised prints) and Cable not deviating outside 1.3950-1.4000 despite some Gbp negative Brexit reports. Perhaps Sterling deriving some support from latest M&amp;A developments and Comcast&rsquo;s mega Gbp22 bn bid for Sky. Usd/Jpy looks even more tethered to the 107.00 level, with export supply capping the upside and buying interest supporting ahead of 106.50. Elsewhere, some further movement in Eur/Sek after Swedish trade data and more dovish-sounding Riksbank rhetoric with the cross inching above the circa 10.0800 high from 2016 to 10.0900.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aforementioned downside chart objectives in Bunds were breached on the way down to the latest intraday low at 159.13 (-43 ticks vs -5 ticks at best), with some market observers suggesting stops through 159.20, but the next support just above the psychological 159.00 level remains intact for now. Bears/sellers also seized the initiative on Liffe after early Gilts resilience as the debt future recoiled to a 121.79 base (-31 ticks vs +12 ticks at one stage) and more in keeping with the overall defensive tone in core bonds. US Treasuries now conforming to the pre-Powell cautionary set-up and re-steepening a tad amidst typically hawkish comments (on balance) from ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, both WTI and Brent crude futures have continued to pull back from recent highs despite the softer USD as concerns over mounting US production remains a key theme with IEA Chief Birol stating that the US is to be largest oil producer by next year and sees US output exceeding 11mln bpd by late this year. In metals markets, spot gold is relatively steady at this stage of the session with markets awaiting Fed Powell&rsquo;s testimony later today. Elsewhere, Chinese steel futures saw another session of gains overnight amid speculation over further extensions to output curbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraqi oil production is around 4.35mln bpd, according to Iraq oil ministry official. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says Treasury is to announce Russian sanctions in the upcoming 30 days. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>European equities (Eurostoxx 50 -0.1%, DAX flat) have seen a relatively directionless start to the session after post-Asia-Pac opening gains were trimmed. Taking a look at the sectors, consumer discretionary is the notable outperformer, lifted by Sky (+19%) after Comcast made an offer of GBP 12.50/shr for the Co., subsequently posing a threat to FOX&rsquo;s (FOXA) offer for the Co. Elsewhere, UK homebuilders are firmer this morning following the latest earnings update from Persimmon (+10%) which has lifted some of its competitors higher in sympathy; Berkeley Group (BKG LN) +2.3%, Barratt Developments (+2.1%) and Taylor Wimpey (+1.7%). Finally, Provident Financial (+58%) tops the Stoxx 600 after announcing its rights issue and settlement with the FCA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Above average Dollar demand for end of February FX portfolios seems to be keeping the broader Usd afloat as the DXY meanders around the mid-point of a tight 89.690-830 range. Currency markets also erring on the side of caution ahead of Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s House testimony and (potentially) any further clues about risks around the FOMC consensus for 3 hikes in 2018. Indeed, individual G10 pairs are equally restrained within narrow bands, with Eur/Usd holding between 1.2300-50 amidst mixed EZ inflation data (German states soft, so far vs firmer Spanish headline and harmonised prints) and Cable not deviating outside 1.3950-1.4000 despite some Gbp negative Brexit reports. Perhaps Sterling deriving some support from latest M&amp;A developments and Comcast&rsquo;s mega Gbp22 bn bid for Sky. Usd/Jpy looks even more tethered to the 107.00 level, with export supply capping the upside and buying interest supporting ahead of 106.50. Elsewhere, some further movement in Eur/Sek after Swedish trade data and more dovish-sounding Riksbank rhetoric with the cross inching above the circa 10.0800 high from 2016 to 10.0900.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aforementioned downside chart objectives in Bunds were breached on the way down to the latest intraday low at 159.13 (-43 ticks vs -5 ticks at best), with some market observers suggesting stops through 159.20, but the next support just above the psychological 159.00 level remains intact for now. Bears/sellers also seized the initiative on Liffe after early Gilts resilience as the debt future recoiled to a 121.79 base (-31 ticks vs +12 ticks at one stage) and more in keeping with the overall defensive tone in core bonds. US Treasuries now conforming to the pre-Powell cautionary set-up and re-steepening a tad amidst typically hawkish comments (on balance) from ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, both WTI and Brent crude futures have continued to pull back from recent highs despite the softer USD as concerns over mounting US production remains a key theme with IEA Chief Birol stating that the US is to be largest oil producer by next year and sees US output exceeding 11mln bpd by late this year. In metals markets, spot gold is relatively steady at this stage of the session with markets awaiting Fed Powell&rsquo;s testimony later today. Elsewhere, Chinese steel futures saw another session of gains overnight amid speculation over further extensions to output curbs.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.4%) are both higher with the trifecta of top performers in Australia all underpinned by earnings releases, while the Japanese benchmark leads the region as the JPY slightly eased. Elsewhere, Chinese markets are mixed as Hang Seng (+0.3%) conforms to the optimistic tone and with Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) the laggard after the PBoC refrained from open market operations. Furthermore, press reports also noted that China is facing tight liquidity conditions in March and that the PBoC could raise rates on open market operations next month following an anticipated Fed hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD remains lacklustre with the DXY languishing below 90.00 amid recent easing of yields and as all focus remains on the upcoming testimony from Fed Chair Powell later today. As such, EUR/USD was the main beneficiary and USD/JPY struggled to maintain its recent rebound to above 107.00. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies are mixed with AUD and CAD mildly supported by crude prices, while NZD underperforms and gave up the 0.7300 handle after trade data disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs prices are relatively flat and are contained at the 151.00 level, with participants sidelined ahead of a 2yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
