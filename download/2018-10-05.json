        "subject": "RANsquawk US Market Wrap - 5 October 2018: Higher yields weigh on equities again; NFP headline misses expectations",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities down, Treasuries down, crude up, dollar flat/down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: NFP rose 134k (Exp. 185k), US Deficit widens, Kudlow negative on China relationship, Canadian Jobs rebound, RBI unchanged, ECB&#39;s De Guindos upbeat on EU economy, Fed&#39;s Williams gradual path of rate hikes, Fed&rsquo;s Bostic data stronger than anticipated.<br />* NEXT WEEK: UK GDP &amp; Industrial Output, US PPI, CPI &amp; Real Weekly Earnings, Chinese Caixin Services PMI, Chinese Trade Balance, German Trade Balance &amp; CPI, ECB, Fed, BoE speak, Pastor Brunson Court Hearing, US earnings season kicks off.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US LABOUR REPORT:</strong> Non-Farm Payrolls rose 134k in September, below the expected 185k; Hurricane Florence seemed to only have had a mild impact on this reading, certainly far less severe than hurricanes Harvey and Irma last year, though the BLS data showed 299k people were off work and 1.5mln worked part-time. Analysts at ING say nonetheless that &lsquo;payrolls growth is averaging 206k per month this year versus the 182k monthly average in 2017&rsquo;; they note the labour market is gaining momentum just like the rest of the economy and they therefore expect solid payrolls in October and November. Average earnings came in in line, posting at 0.3% MM and 2.8% YY; ING expects the yearly figure to hit above 3% next month which would indicate the fastest growth pace since April 2009. Unemployment also fell slightly and came in at 3.7% a tad below the 3.8% consensus, the lowest print since 1969. On the flip side underemployment ticked up to 7.5% most likely on temporary factors given the strong demand for jobs. Also, White House Advisor Kudlow commenting on the latest jobs report, stated unemployment can still go lower, noting people are moving back into the labour force as wages increase. He suggested they would like a steady and strong dollar and vowed they are not trying to influence the Fed or the dollar policy. Separately, he said to be pleased with Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s comments about inflation growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US TRADE BALANCE </strong>showed the US deficit widened to 53.2bln from 50.1bln, marginally better than the 53.5bln consensus. Looking at the breakdown, exports were down 0.58% led by oil while imports were up 0.6%. Analysts at Pantheon argue &lsquo;the deficit is on course to reverse all the Q2 drop, and net foreign trade will be a drag on GDP growth in Q2, by about 1-1/4 percentage points&rsquo; and see the deficit rising further in Q4 as &lsquo;domestic demand growth is comfortably outstripping the rate of growth of supply&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADIAN JOBS </strong>strongly rebounded in September posting at 63.3k from the previous -51.6k and well above the 25k consensus mostly on the back of a rise in part-time employees (+80k+). Moreover, unemployment fell to 5.9% from 6.0% as expected, and the participation rate rose slightly to 65.4%. Nonetheless wage growth decelerated to 2.2% from 2.6%. Analysts at TD Securities and at Scotiabank believe the data will not change the BoC outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: &nbsp;</strong>ECB President Draghi reportedly met with Italian President Mattarella to point out the risks of a negative market reaction to the budget on Wednesday. Italy&#39;s deputy PM Di Maio said he does not envisage a cabinet reshuffle and announced they will reduce tax benefits for banks and oil groups; he also noted economy Minister Tria is doing a good job. Italian deputy PM Salvini stated they will never accept an EU budget that lowers agricultural spending. In terms of forecasts, Italy set debt to GDP targets at 130.9 in 2018, 130.0 in 2019, 128.1 in 2020 and 126.7 2021; it cut 2018 GDP growth forecast to 1.2% (Prev. 1.5%), hiked 2018 fiscal deficit target to 1.8% (Prev. 1.6%) and targets 2019 &quot;structural&quot; deficit at 1.7% of GDP vs. 0.9% in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>White House Advisor Kudlow noted Trump thinks the relationship with China is broken and sees a possibility of a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Sources reported the EU is ready to offer the UK a &lsquo;supercharged&rsquo; Brexit deal, though highlighting the Irish border is still an issue. Earlier, EU Diplomatic Sources said that a divorce deal on Brexit is &quot;very close&quot; with Britain. Additionally, the UK Brexit Ministry stated they will outline their backstop proposal that will preserve the UK&#39;s integrity; adding there is no need for new regulatory barriers between NI and the rest of the UK and the NI executive assembly wishes. On the Irish side, Foreign Minster Coveney said it is &quot;hard to know&quot; if the backstop proposal would work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Williams (Voter) is not seeing inflationary pressure though was upbeat about the good labour market noting it is a &#39;Goldilocks&#39; economy. He sees the jobless rate falling to below 3.5% in 2019 and US GDP to be at/around 3% this year. He said if the economy continues its current course, the gradual path of rate hikes is the &#39;right path&#39;. On the neutral rate, he said &lsquo;we do not know&rsquo; where it is adding &lsquo;we have a way to go, to get near the neutral rate&rsquo;. He is also not worried if inflation rises a few tenths of a percent above the 2% goal. Fed&#39;s Bostic (Voter, Dovish) said incoming data has been stronger this year than he anticipated and added he might have underestimated the momentum of aggregate demand; if so that would require higher paths of rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s De Guindos reported economic growth in the Euro area is currently solid and broad-based.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.6% at 2886, NDX -1.2% at 7399, DJI -0.7% at 26449.</strong> SECTORS: Energy -0.1%, Materials -0.8%, Industrials -0.5%, Cons Discretionary -0.8%, Cons Staples -0.2%, Healthcare -0.1%, Financials -0.5%, Tech -1.3%, Telecoms -1.0%, Utilities +1.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> General Electric (GE) led the SPX today, as did the wider utility sector, as the new appointed CEO helped fuel optimism. Nordstrom (JWN) was up on the day and McKesson (MCK) continued its rally from yesterday. Healthcare names, Henry Schein (HSIC) and Biomarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) were also big gainers in the Nasdaq. IPG Photonics (IPGP) fell off a cliff after adjusting its Q3 earnings forecast below estimates. Tesla (TSLA) down, again, after CEO Musk tweeted insults at the SEC as well as reports the SEC isn&rsquo;t done probing Musk. Newell Brands (NWL) traded lower in the wake of its Chief Accounting Officer departing. Costco (COST) dipped after its earnings report yesterday evening where its sales only just beat estimates and margins fell. Other stocks lower on the day included semiconductor names such as Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Xilinx (XLNX).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 0.01 HIGHER AT USD 74.34/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.42 LOWER AT USD 84.16/BBL.</strong> &nbsp;Brent and WTI consolidate beneath $85/bbl and $75/bbl respectively after late trade comments from Saudi Arabia&#39;s Crown Prince Salman stated the nation has 1.3mln bbl/day of spare capacity ready to be used if market needs it sees deal with Kuwait to restart oil fields soon. He insisted the Kingdom is fulfilling promises to make up for Iranian crude supplies lost to American sanctions noting that Saudi Arabia is now pumping about 10.7mln bpd and could push it beyond 12mln bpd with additional investment. Analysts at Citi noted that there is now a lot of talk about oil hitting $100/bbl by the end of the year (Platts said $100 is possible, though fundamentals support high $70/bbl). &quot;While we never put limits on where oil prices could go, we also note that raising production targets is a way of keeping buyers motivated,&quot; Citi said. &quot;Buying of $85/bbl Brent might entail some downside risk, and so the higher $100 potential makes it seem like a bargain.&quot; However, Citi sees a tension in the market between the impact of US sanctions on Iranian production and exports on the one hand, and rising output out of Saudi Arabia and Russia on the other. Elsewhere, Baker Hughes reported oil drillers cut rigs for the third consecutive week, with the rig count falling by 2; total rigs were down 2 as gas rigs were unchanged. There were also reports on Friday that India is still planning on purchasing Iranian crude in November, despite US pressure on nations to cease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 9 TICKS LOWER AT 127-21+</strong>. It was another day of higher yields across teh Treasury curve, which bear-steepened once again, though yields were off their highs by settlement. Selling was seen following a decent labour market report which showed wages ticking up in September. Many parts of the curves hit fresh multi-year highs. FOMC voter John Williams said the yield curve flattening did not portend a recession, and sees inflation rising further, which helped yields crawl higher. Major curve spreads were wider at settlement by between 1-3bps. NOTE: US fixed income markets will be closed on Monday for Columbus Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP: * DXY: </strong>The index and broad Usd remain on track to end the week with solid gains largely on the back of a break-out in US Treasury yields to multi-year highs at the long end of a significantly steeper curve. The catalysts were upbeat data/survey along with hawkish comments from Fed chair Powell who stated that rates are still some distance from neutral and could be hiked above that level given concerns about an overheating economy. This arguably raised the profile of NFP even further, and while the headline number disappointed a bigger upgrade to the previous month compensated, while the jobless rate hit a new multi-decade low and average earnings were in line with consensus. Note also, September&rsquo;s payroll count was adversely impacted by hurricane Florence. DXY now just above 95.600 within 96.124-94.996 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Rivalling the Dollar, or at least the rest of the G10 pack as UK PM May emerged from the Conservative Party conference with no further serious challenges to her leadership and fairly tame reviews of her dancing capabilities. However, the biggest supporting factor came from the EU amidst reports that a Brexit deal could be &lsquo;very&rsquo; close and revised Irish border back-stop plans are moving in the right direction. Cable is retesting 1.3100 vs peaks just above at one stage and lows not far off 1.2900, while Eur/Gbp is around 1 big figure lower on the week circa 0.8800 and from where it started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Ending Friday&rsquo;s EU session on a firmer footing vs the Greenback, but well off 1.1600+ highs and closer to the 1.1460 base posted at the height of the Buck&rsquo;s bull run amidst persistent jitters over fiscal developments in Rome. Indeed, Italy&rsquo;s medium term budget was a near constant source of volatility and uncertain factor as wrangling between the coalition parties rumbled on and centred on deficit targets for 2019 through 2021. In the end a compromise was struck after calls for 2.5% or even 3%+ from the extreme factions vs sub-2% from Economy Minister Tria and those more willing or eager to comply with EU guidelines, at 2.4%, 2.1% and 1.8% respectively. However, the jury is still out on GDP forecasts that are pivotal for debt reduction, and Brussels is yet to deliver its verdict after official presentation on October 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> Divergent yields and BoJ vs Fed policy cycles eventually took hold of Usd/Jpy, as the pair rallied into a fresh range around 114.00 between 113.50 and just over 114.50 at one stage. This after BoJ Governor Kuroda pre-empted the move on the relative rate dynamic and as Japanese macro releases mainly underlined the need for powerful easing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>By far the major losers over the week, as the Aud derived no traction from a still neutral RBA or mixed data in the form of dire building approvals vs better than forecast trade and retail sales. The ongoing US-China trade rift remained a persistent weight, and compounded by the heightened yield advantage garnered by their US peer, Aud/Usd tumbled from circa 0.7235 at best to just a few pips shy of 0.7050 where option and export buying interest resides, while the Kiwi collapsed to around 0.6450 vs 0.6630 at the other extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Whippy trade after the side-by-side Canadian and US employment reports, with the Loonie strengthening through 1.2900, marginally and briefly on the bloated payroll gain before retreating to below 1.2950 due to a big decline in permanent jobs and another slowdown in the y/y wage component, and thereby unwinding more of its USMCA (the new NAFTA) euphoria or relief bid. Note, Usd/Cad traded down to 1.2775 on the latter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>The Franc has largely been victim and hostage to moves elsewhere, but soft Swiss CPI data undermined the Chf earlier on Friday before the post-NFP Dollar pull-back helped it bounce from 0.9950+ lows. However, Eur/Chf remains above 1.1400 even though the single currency suffered from all the Roman deficit issues mentioned above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Another roller-coaster ride for many regional currencies, with the Try trying to extend its revival above 6.0000 vs the Usd, but the Lira losing momentum abruptly after Turkish inflation data soared to 24%+. The Yuan has weakened to 6.9000+ levels in the absence of the PBoC during China&rsquo;s Golden Week market holidays, so a reaction and possible intervention could well be in the offing next Monday. On that note, the Indonesian Central Bank has been in the market attempting to curb Idr weakness, but the RBI did not ride to the rescue of the Inr with the &frac14; point hike widely expected, only offering &lsquo;calibrated&rsquo; tightening ahead. The upshot, new record Rupiah lows, in contrast to a rebounding Rea</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Monday - Chinese Caixin Services PMI, German Industrial Output, Fed&#39;s Bullard and ECB&#39;s Nowotny speaking Tuesday - German Trade Balance, Fed&#39;s Kaplan, Evans and Harker speaking Wednesday - UK GDP &amp; Industrial Output, US PPI, Fed&#39;s Williams, Evan&#39;s and Bostic speaking Thursday - US CPI &amp; Real Weekly Earnings, Swedish CPI and BoE&#39;s Vlieghe Friday - German CPI, Chinese Trade Balance, ECB&#39;s Lautenschlager, Fed&#39;s Evans &amp; Bostic, Pastor Brunson Court Hearing, US earnings season kicks off. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20249/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk Week In Focus report.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CENTRAL BANK WEEKLY: </strong>Reviewing Fed&#39;s speak, RBA, Banxico, RBI. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20250/download\"><strong>Click here to access the full RANsquawk Central Bank weekly report.</strong></a></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index and broad Usd remain on track to end the week with solid gains largely on the back of a break-out in US Treasury yields to multi-year highs at the long end of a significantly steeper curve. The catalysts were upbeat data/survey along with hawkish comments from Fed chair Powell who stated that rates are still some distance from neutral and could be hiked above that level given concerns about an overheating economy. This arguably raised the profile of NFP even further, and while the headline number disappointed a bigger upgrade to the previous month compensated, while the jobless rate hit a new multi-decade low and average earnings were in line with consensus. Note also, September&rsquo;s payroll count was adversely impacted by hurricane Florence. DXY now just above 95.600 within 96.124-94.996 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rivalling the Dollar, or at least the rest of the G10 pack as UK PM May emerged from the Conservative Party conference with no further serious challenges to her leadership and fairly tame reviews of her dancing capabilities. However, the biggest supporting factor came from the EU amidst reports that a Brexit deal could be &lsquo;very&rsquo; close and revised Irish border back-stop plans are moving in the right direction. Cable is retesting 1.3100 vs peaks just above at one stage and lows not far off 1.2900, while Eur/Gbp is around 1 big figure lower on the week circa 0.8800 and from where it started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Friday&rsquo;s EU session on a firmer footing vs the Greenback, but well off 1.1600+ highs and closer to the 1.1460 base posted at the height of the Buck&rsquo;s bull run amidst persistent jitters over fiscal developments in Rome. Indeed, Italy&rsquo;s medium term budget was a near constant source of volatility and uncertain factor as wrangling between the coalition parties rumbled on and centred on deficit targets for 2019 through 2021. In the end a compromise was struck after calls for 2.5% or even 3%+ from the extreme factions vs sub-2% from Economy Minister Tria and those more willing or eager to comply with EU guidelines, at 2.4%, 2.1% and 1.8% respectively. However, the jury is still out on GDP forecasts that are pivotal for debt reduction, and Brussels is yet to deliver its verdict after official presentation on October 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Divergent yields and BoJ vs Fed policy cycles eventually took hold of Usd/Jpy, as the pair rallied into a fresh range around 114.00 between 113.50 and just over 114.50 at one stage. This after BoJ Governor Kuroda pre-empted the move on the relative rate dynamic and as Japanese macro releases mainly underlined the need for powerful easing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By far the major losers over the week, as the Aud derived no traction from a still neutral RBA or mixed data in the form of dire building approvals vs better than forecast trade and retail sales. The ongoing US-China trade rift remained a persistent weight, and compounded by the heightened yield advantage garnered by their US peer, Aud/Usd tumbled from circa 0.7235 at best to just a few pips shy of 0.7050 where option and export buying interest resides, while the Kiwi collapsed to around 0.6450 vs 0.6630 at the other extreme. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whippy trade after the side-by-side Canadian and US employment reports, with the Loonie strengthening through 1.2900, marginally and briefly on the bloated payroll gain before retreating to below 1.2950 due to a big decline in permanent jobs and another slowdown in the y/y wage component, and thereby unwinding more of its USMCA (the new NAFTA) euphoria or relief bid. Note, Usd/Cad traded down to 1.2775 on the latter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc has largely been victim and hostage to moves elsewhere, but soft Swiss CPI data undermined the Chf earlier on Friday before the post-NFP Dollar pull-back helped it bounce from 0.9950+ lows. However, Eur/Chf remains above 1.1400 even though the single currency suffered from all the Roman deficit issues mentioned above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another roller-coaster ride for many regional currencies, with the Try trying to extend its revival above 6.0000 vs the Usd, but the Lira losing momentum abruptly after Turkish inflation data soared to 24%+. The Yuan has weakened to 6.9000+ levels in the absence of the PBoC during China&rsquo;s Golden Week market holidays, so a reaction and possible intervention could well be in the offing next Monday. On that note, the Indonesian Central Bank has been in the market attempting to curb Idr weakness, but the RBI did not ride to the rescue of the Inr with the &frac14; point hike widely expected, only offering &lsquo;calibrated&rsquo; tightening ahead. The upshot, new record Rupiah lows, in contrast to a rebounding Real ahead of Sunday&rsquo;s Brazilian election and following polls indicating a wider lead for the more Brl supportive/less harmful Bolsonaro.</p>\r\n",

Aud/Usd has been down to 0.7055 and close to purported option and export-related bids layered ahead of 0.7050, with Usd/Chf nudging towards 0.9950, Nzd/Usd hovering just above 0.6460 and Aud/Nzd back over 1.0925.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD - Also softer vs the Greenback, with the single currency unable to sustain momentum on advances beyond 1.1500 and technically weak while under 1.1550 and a 1.1546 Fib, while the Loonie remains contained within a 1.2915-40 range vs its US counterpart awaiting Canadian jobs data due at the same time as NFP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Some consolidation after widespread depreciation vs the Dollar for the most part this week, but not for the Inr that hit fresh all time lows following the RBI&rsquo;s decision to stand pat on rates against consensus for a 25 bp hike, although it did switch policy stance to &lsquo;calibrated&rsquo; tightening from neutral.

The core 10 year bond gapped down from the Liffe open through 120.00 vs Thursday&rsquo;s 120.18 close, and after a fleeting uptick to the big figure extended losses to &frac12; point at 119.68 before finding some light underlying bids. Bunds recoiled in sympathy it seems to a 157.55 Eurex low (-49 ticks), and perhaps importantly under technical support circa 157.74 that held on Thursday to expose 157.43 next. Back to Liffe, and the 3 month strip also declined further to stand 5 ticks adrift at worst. Halifax hpi was relatively weak, but did not&nbsp; really impact, however another marked downturn in Italian BTPs (in excess of 100 ticks and almost down to 121.00 the figure vs. 122.17 at yesterday&rsquo;s close) has recently boosted core bonds with Gilts just off a marginal new session peak (120.02) and Bunds back up towards 158.00.</p>\r\n",

Back to Liffe, and the 3 month strip also declined further to stand 5 ticks adrift at worst. Halifax hpi was relatively weak, but did not&nbsp; really impact, however another marked downturn in Italian BTPs (in excess of 100 ticks and almost down to 121.00 the figure vs. 122.17 at yesterday&rsquo;s close) has recently boosted core bonds with Gilts just off a marginal new session peak (120.02) and Bunds back up towards 158.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil market is uneventful heading into the weekend with trade tentative ahead of the US labour market data later in the day, and the fossil fuel essentially flat for the day. The crude complex is set for its fourth consecutive weekly gain, as supply-driven gains have pushed the commodity to 4 year highs this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest plats survey revealed OPEC compliance stands at 110% in September for members with quotas, alongside stating that Saudi output rose by 100k BPD, and that they have exceeded their targeted 1mln BPD increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In metals markets, gold is also essentially unchanged as traders hold off ahead of a US jobs report that could tempt the Fed to implement a tighter monetary policy should signs of wage growth be seen.&nbsp; Aluminium is also steady, with the construction material set for its biggest weekly rise since April as supply concerns have lifted prices.</p>\r\n",

Bunds have recoiled in sympathy it seems to a 157.61 Eurex low (-43 ticks), and perhaps importantly under technical support circa 157.74 that held on Thursday to expose 157.43 next. Back to Liffe, and the 3 month strip is also declining further to stand 5 ticks adrift at worst. Halifax hpi just out and relatively weak, but highly unlikely to impact for long if at all.</p>\r\n",
