The Fed also saw growth slowing in the second half of the year. The immediate reaction was modestly dovish in which the USD fell around 30 pips against the EUR and T-Notes increased by 2 ticks, although the moves were pared shortly after with attention on the Fed now shifting on towards the Jackson Hole economic symposium, and specifically, will the Fed participants there (Powell, Rosengren) express similar warnings that could hint that the FOMC was mulling a slowing in its trajectory of rate hikes.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House stated it still expects USD 16bln tariffs on Chinese imports to go into effect at midnight. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Foreign Secretary Hunt said UK will be better off outside the EU and that will be the case even if the UK leaves without an exit deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Bexit Secretary Raab is reportedly to say that EU is being irresponsible regarding the Brexit but is to also state he remains confident a good deal is within horizon. (Newswires/Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks w/e -5.836M vs. Exp. -1.497M (Prev. 6.805M).

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said now is a good time for a trade spat because of the booming economy and that it will take time to resolve the trade imbalances. Ross stated there could be retaliation from China on tariffs and that there is some hope anytime there is interaction with China. Elsewhere, Ross stated there is no deal with Mexico yet, but one is within reach and they hope to get a deal done with Mexico soon. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo said he is hoping for a solution on NAFTA in the next hours or days and that the inclusion of at least technical negotiators from Canada will depend on how talks progress. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico Incoming Trade Negotiator Seade said they still working on aspects of rules of origin and was doubtful when asked if there would be an announcement on NAFTA on Thursday but was said to be optimistic that they are coming to an end on NAFTA process. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump, when asked about payments through his lawyer Cohen, said later on he knew and the money came from him not the campaign. However, there were also comments from Cohen&#39;s lawyer Lanny Davis that there is strong evidence US President Trump knew about the payments, while Davis also stated there is no dispute that US President Trump committed a crime and that Cohen has knowledge of Russian conspiracy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures gave up gains overnight, with traders citing the ongoing political concerns. The Emini hit a bottom of around 2850 late on Wednesday (early morning UK time), before the index drifted higher throughout the day and breaking back into positive territory, though a fresh record high has been elusive. Energy names outperformed on Wednesday following higher oil prices, boosted by weekly API &amp; DOE data showing large draws. And Telecom&rsquo;s underperformed which was pressured by a downgrade for CenturyLink (CTL) from MoffetNathanson, as well as a downgrade for AT&amp;T (T) from Wells Fargo. Verizon (VZ) were also lower after reports which stated they received a net neutrality complaint which claimed the Santa Clara County Fire department had its data throttled by the co as they attempted to put out a wildfire in California. SPX -0.04% at 2861, NDX +0.37% at 7424, DJI -0.34% at 25733.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The complex was bid overnight on news that Trump associates were in legal mires that could possibly implicate the Trump in some sort of wrongdoing. In European trade, yields on 10s fell to 2.808, though did tick slightly higher to 2.83s as US traders got to their desks, and thereafter, yields were content to traverse sideways as traders awaited the FOMC meeting minutes; the dovish FOMC minutes did lend a bid into Treasuries, but at 2 ticks, it was modest, and soon unwound. As is almost customary these days, 2s5s and 2s10s printed new narrows for the cycle, both to levels not seen in around 11-years. US 10-YEAR T-Notes settled 5+ ticks higher at 120-20.</p>\r\n",

The Fed also saw growth slowing in the second half of the year. The immediate reaction was modestly dovish, with the USD falling around 30 pips against the EUR, while T-Notes rose by 2 ticks. Attention now moves on towards the Jackson Hole economic symposium, and specifically, will the Fed participants there (Powell, Rosengren) express similar warnings that could hint that the FOMC was mulling a slowing in its trajectory of rate hikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CHINA TRADE TALKS:</strong> The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday to hope for a good outcome from the US-China trade talks. The talks between the two sides were resumed on Tuesday after negotiations stalled in May. US and China vice minister level delegations are meeting in the afternoon, and the White House still expects USD 16bln tariffs to go into effect at midnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>NAFTA:</strong> Mexico, US and Canada were upbeat on Wednesday on the prospect of a NAFTA deal, with Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo expressing hope for a solution to be coming in the next hours or days. Similarly, Mexican NAFTA negotiator Seade said the US and Mexico are making good progress on bilateral negotiations, though he noted the timing of a NAFTA deal would be premature. This latest assertion was a step-down from comments he made on Tuesday, where he expected the US and Mexican officials to have an agreement on the outstanding issues by early next week. Seade also said that the parties are still working on aspects of the autos rules of origin. On the US side, Trump advisor Kushner stated NAFTA negotiations with Mexico were &#39;going well&#39;, and finally, Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland was encouraged by the progress in NAFTA talks&rsquo; between the Mexicans and Americans, adding that Canada hopes to re-join talks once US &amp; Mexico issues have been resolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>GEOPOLITICS:</strong> US National Security Advisor Bolton said US will do &quot;other things&quot; beyond economic sanctions to pressure Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>US POLITICS:</strong> Political developments related to legal matters in President Trump&rsquo;s former inner circle also remained in focus. Former Trump lawyer Cohen&#39;s lawyer stated there is no dispute that US President Trump committed a crime and added Cohen has knowledge of Russian conspiracy and also suggested there is strong evidence US President Trump knew about payments to ladies Trump is said to have had affairs with. US President Trump, when asked about payments through his lawyer Cohen, later said he knew later on, and the money came from him not the campaign. The White House also reiterated that Trump had done nothing wrong, and faces no charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>BREXIT:</strong> UK Foreign Secretary Hunt, who campaigned for remaining in the EU during the 2016 Brexit referendum, said in an interview with Axios that he now believes the UK will be better off outside the EU and that will be the case even if the UK leaves without an exit deal. Note however that his comments on a no-deal scenario varied; last week he tweeted that the UK &ldquo;WOULD survive and prosper without a deal&rdquo; just after telling ITV last week that a no-deal &lsquo;would be a mistake we would regret for generations&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>US EXISITING HOME SALES</strong> were slightly softer in July and posted at 5.34mln, missing expectations at 5.4mln. Home sales fell in all regions except for the West. The weakness in this data was attributed to tight inventories as well as higher mortgage rates are raising affordability concerns even though shortages in inventories are expected to ease. Analysts at Oxford Economics note this reading is in line with their forecast for real residential investment to decline at a 3.2% annualized pace in Q3 as well as a GDP of 3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>SPX -0.04% at 2861, NDX +0.37% at 7424, DJI -0.34% at 25733. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +1.20%, Materials -0.45%, Industrials -0.93%, Cons Discretionary +0.12%, Cons Staples -0.63%, Healthcare +0.11%, Financials -0.28%, Tech +0.48%, Telecoms -2.02%, Utilities -0.78%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>FUTURES:</strong> US equity futures gave up gains overnight, with traders citing the ongoing political concerns. The Emini hit a bottom of around 2850 late on Wednesday (early morning UK time), before the index drifted higher throughout the day and breaking back into positive territory, though a fresh record high has been elusive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>EARNINGS:</strong> Retailer Lowe&rsquo;s (LOW) beat on both top and bottom lines and it&rsquo;s same store sales rose 5.2%. However, the retailer provided FY EPS guidance which came in beneath Wall St expectations, and its same store sales fell also fell short of expectations which saw the shares lower pre-market. Nonetheless, Lowe&rsquo;s then announced it is to close 99 Orchard Supply Hardware stores by the end of this year, where the CEO noted it would be able to then spend shareholders&rsquo; money elsewhere, where it stated it is to use $500mln worth of Capex, and instead use it on share buybacks. LOW saw intraday highs of roughly 8%. Target (TGT) also beat on top and bottom lines and also reported its strongest same store sales growth in 13 years, the retailer also now expects higher EPS and higher comparable sales for the FY. On the earnings call the CEO was very upbeat, saying they expect a strong holiday season and that they will continue to remodel their stores. Also, the CEO said they will make sure to take a fair share of the Toys R Us market. The two retailers outperformed in the SPX on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Goodyear (GT) were hit after its European competitor, Continental (CON GY), cut its earnings forecast which hit GT hard as they saw intraday lows of 4%. Starbucks (SBUX) were lower by ~2.5% after the stock was downgraded to neutral at Piper Jaffray. Also, airlines like American Airlines (AAL) and Hawaiian Airlines (HA) have been cutting flights due to higher fuel costs and also due to more competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>SECTORS:</strong> Energy names outperformed on Wednesday following higher oil prices, boosted by weekly API &amp; DOE data showing large draws. And Telecom&rsquo;s underperformed which was pressured by a downgrade for CenturyLink (CTL) from MoffetNathanson, as well as a downgrade for AT&amp;T (T) from Wells Fargo. Verizon (VZ) were also lower after reports which stated they received a net neutrality complaint which claimed the Santa Clara County Fire department had its data throttled by the co as they attempted to put out a wildfire in California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>WTI (V8) FUTURES SETTLE USD 2.02 HIGHER AT USD 67.86/BBL, BRENT (V8) FUTURES SETTLE USD 2.15 HIGHER AT USD 74.78/BBL.</strong> Oil prices traded firm on Wednesday, with desks suggesting the theme that US sanctions on Iran are having an impact on supply and prices, despite there being no change/major update in the narrative this week. Citi explains that &quot;instead, the wave of risk-off trade flow in reaction to rising OPEC+ production appears to have run its course, and investors are reloading on the long side of the market,&quot; and reiterated that Iran remains the high-profile bullish factor for the intermediate term. Weekly DOE inventory data echoed the theme of the API report on Tuesday, with headline crude stocks posting a larger-than-expected draw (-5.836mln vs exp. -1.5mln), Cushing saw a build of 772k, gasoline built by 1.2mlkn barrels against an expected draw, while distillates built by 1.849mln (expected 1.463mln).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>US 10-YEAR T-NOTES SETTLED 5+ TICKS HIGHER AT 120-20. </strong>The complex was bid overnight on news that Trump associates were in legal mires that could possibly implicate the Trump in some sort of wrongdoing. In European tradem yields on 10s fell to 2.808, though did tick slightly higher to 2.83s as US traders got to their desks, and thereafter, yields were content to traverse sideways as traders awaited the FOMC meeting minutes; the dovish FOMC minutes did lend a bid into Treasuries, but at 2 ticks, it was modest, and soon unwound. As is almost customary these days, 2s5s and 2s10s printed new narrows for the cycle, both to levels not seen in around 11-years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>5-YEAR TIPS PREVIEW:</strong> The US will tap the TII April 2023 for $14bln on Thursday. Analysts at Societe Generale said 5-year TIPS have been cheapening up in real yield terms since the first issue of this bond back in April, and on inflation breakeven terms, 5-year has recently underperformed other parts of the curve and US CPI swaps. However, SocGen notes that the the real yield and breakeven cheapening of the past few months should be a positive for this auction, and therefore, the supply should be well-absorbed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>DXY:</strong> The Greenback has extended losses inspired by US President Trump&rsquo;s latest rant against the FOMC, and chair Powell in particular, plus those he claims are manipulating currencies to gain a competitive advantage, albeit after recovering some composure during the early stages of Wednesday&rsquo;s EU session. The DXY dipped to around 94.930 at one stage, but then reclaimed the 95.000. The 95.00 level was breached after a dovish set of Fed minutes, though the post-Fed moves proved to be fleeting, and the buck recovered 95.00 again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>AUD, JPY:</strong> The AUD continues to pivot 0.7350 vs the USD amidst ongoing political jitters following the narrow vote of no confidence escape by PM Turnbull that leaves him prone to another leadership challenge amidst calls by members of his Liberal Party for a emergency meeting overnight. Note also, looming option expiry interest (820 mn at the 0.7375 strike running off on Thursday) may be capping the pair, along with cross-winds down under as AUDNZD retreats further below 1.1000 and the Kiwi gleans relative benefit from significantly stronger than forecast NZ retail sales for Q2 last night &ndash; NZDUSD hovering around 0.6700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CHF, EUR:</strong> The major beneficiaries of renewed Dollar weakness, with the Franc inching closer towards 0.9800 and single currency revisiting 1.1600+ levels, but still unable to breach chart resistance around 1.1626 (55 DMA), and thus failing to remain above the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> GBP: </strong>Also firmer vs the USD, as Cable has another look above 1.2900, but fails to clear upside technical levels between 1.2926-30 ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s Brexit no deal presentation to Parliament, while EURGBP drifts back from a brief 0.9000+ sortie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CAD, MXN:</strong> The Loonie knee-jerked higher in wake of Canadian retail sales data and back month upward revisions to retest offers said to be residing between 1.3000-10 vs its US counterpart, but then recoiled on latest NAFTA headlines pouring more cold water on initial reports about a handshake deal on Thursday. Moreover, Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister expressed hope for a solution in the next hours or days and the country&rsquo;s NAFTA negotiator reported good progress with the US, but warned that predicting when an accord will be struck would be premature. All this after the US Trade Rep said major issues remain unresolved, but the Peso is still firmer vs the USD around 18.8200 in the knowledge or hope that something will materialise sooner rather than later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>EM (others):</strong> No such joy for the Real amidst ongoing election uncertainty/premium, but the Rand did eventually accumulate some momentum after SA inflation hit multi-year highs &ndash; USDBRL +0.65% at 4.0725 vs USDZAR -0.2% at 14.3500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>COMING-UP: </strong>Jackson Hole. The symposium takes place on the 24th-26th August Fed chair Powell&#39;s address is scheduled for Friday at 10:00 ET/ 15:00 BST Main themes: Fed Independence, pace of Fed hikes, yield curve, neutral rate. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19921/download\">Click here for RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>COMING UP:</strong> ECB July Minutes. Due to be released Thursday 23rd August at 1230BST/0630CDT. This week&rsquo;s ECB minutes release is set to offer very little in the way of fireworks given the lack of action at the July meeting. To recap last month&rsquo;s proceedings, the Bank reiterated their view that they expect key rates to remain at present levels at least through the Summer of 2019, and as long as necessary to ensure continued sustained convergence of inflation. During the accompanying press conference, Draghi gave little away and batted away any questions trying to get him to pin down an exact timeframe for the next rate move by the ECB. Furthermore, Draghi stated that uncertainties relating to the trade environment remain prominent, but the Euro area economy is solid and broad-based. Rhetoric from the Bank since the July meeting has been particularly light with central bankers opting to take a break from the minutiae of EZ monetary policy. As such, anyone looking for a trading opportunity out of this week&rsquo;s minutes release might be left disappointed with the account unlikely to offer any further insight into the Bank&rsquo;s plans for further monetary tightening.</p>\r\n",

The full schedule and list of participants will be released at 0100 BST on Friday (5PM mountain time on Thursday, 7PM Eastern time on Thursday). Fed&rsquo;s Powell will deliver an address on Friday (at 10AM Eastern Time), and BOC governor Poloz is also set to attend, as is the RBNZ governor Orr, and RBA assistant governor Kent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FED INDEPENDENCE:</strong>&nbsp;In light of US President Trump&rsquo;s recent swipe at the Fed&rsquo;s tightening of monetary policy, the independence of the central bank will surely be a sub-theme. Trump renewed his criticism of the Fed, complaining about the central bank lifting rates, and lamenting that Fed chair Powell was not a &ldquo;cheap money&rdquo; Fed chair, which he expected when he appointed him. Trump is seemingly upset that the Fed is lifting rates amid, what Trump alleges, is currency manipulation by the Europeans and Chinese while trade wars continue. Politico citing sources this week reported that Fed chair Powell has no plans to ever let Trump&rsquo;s comments impact the Fed&rsquo;s hiking trajectory, potentially setting up a future conflict with the President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>OTHER THEMES:</strong>&nbsp;Powell&rsquo;s speech is titled &ldquo;Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,&rdquo; indicates the potential for a discussion on a broad range of topics. As the US economy seemingly marches forward it is likely that the current Fed policy path will remain unchanged, but there are a few talking points analysts will be watching, with TD Securities looking for commentary on an earlier than expected ending of the Fed&rsquo;s run-off policy, alternative policy regimes, and of course, the neutral rate of interest and the shape of the yield curve; TD argues that there is a small chance that Powell may discuss the need for a higher r* and that the recent flattening of the yield curve is due to technical factors, such as global downward pressure on term premiums. This would be perceived as a hawkish, but unlikely as Powell is believed to be adhering for a continuation of policy. Some also note that with tensions in EM, they will be on the look-out for comments that suggest the recent moves are a concern for the Fed, which could potentially slow its hiking cycle in response.</p>\r\n",

The DXY dipped to around 94.930 at one stage, but is trying to reclaim 95.000, tentatively as allegations about Trump&rsquo;s actions over the 2016 campaign continue .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aud continues to pivot 0.7350 vs the Usd amidst ongoing political jitters following the narrow vote of no confidence escape by PM Turnbull that leaves him prone to another leadership challenge amidst calls by members of his Liberal Party for a emergency meeting overnight. Note also, looming option expiry interest (820 mn at the 0.7375 strike running off on Thursday) may be capping the pair, along with cross-winds down under as Aud/NZD retreats further below 1.1000 and the Kiwi gleans relative benefit from significantly stronger than forecast NZ retail sales for Q2 last night &ndash; Nzd/Usd hovering around 0.6700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major beneficiaries of renewed Dollar weakness, with the Franc inching closer towards 0.9800 and single currency revisiting 1.1600+ levels, but still unable to breach chart resistance around 1.1626 (55 DMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also firmer vs the Usd, as Cable has another look above 1.2900, but fails to clear upside technical levels between 1.2926-30 ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s Brexit no deal presentation to Parliament, while Eur/Gbp drifts back from a brief 0.9000+ sortie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/MXN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie knee-jerked higher in wake of Canadian retail sales data and back month upward revisions to retest offers said to be residing between 1.3000-10 vs its US counterpart, but then recoiled on latest NAFTA headlines pouring more cold water on initial reports about a handshake deal on Thursday. Moreover, Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister expressed hope for a solution in the next hours or days and the country&rsquo;s NAFTA negotiator reported good progress with the US, but warned that predicting when an accord will be struck would be premature. All this after the US Trade Rep said major issues remain unresolved, but the Peso is still firmer vs the Usd around 18.8200 in the knowledge or hope that something will materialise sooner rather than later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM (others) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No such joy for the Real amidst ongoing election uncertainty/premium, but the Rand did eventually accumulate some momentum after SA inflation hit multi-year highs &ndash; Usd/Brl +0.65% at 4.0725 vs Usd/Zar -0.2% at 14.3500.</p>\r\n",

This was after Trump&rsquo;s former campaign manager Manafort was found guilty on 8 counts including tax fraud, while former Trump lawyer Cohen also pleaded guilty at a court hearing and stated he violated campaign financing laws at the direction of a &#39;candidate&#39; which his lawyer further elaborated on and alleged that Trump directed Cohen to commit a crime. ASX 200 (-0.3%) declined from the open with the index weighed by financials although telecoms outperformed on M&amp;A news with TPG in merger discussions with Vodafone Hutchison Australia, while Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) was also initially pressured but then recovered as auto names cheered recent reports that US auto tariffs could be delayed. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) were mixed in which the mainland underperformed after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations and with both US and China said to be pessimistic heading into trade discussions. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw initial gains as prices tracked the overnight rebound in T-notes and with the BoJ also in the market for JGBs in the belly to super-long end, but then gradually pared throughout the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8271 (Prev. 6.8360)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Trump lawyer Cohen pleaded guilty at a court hearing and stated he violated campaign financing laws at the direction of a &#39;candidate&#39; and acted to influence the election.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is said to announce &lsquo;handshake&rsquo; NAFTA agreement related to Mexico on Thursday, according to reports in Politico. However, there were later comments from the Canadian government that it has no notification of a NAFTA agreement being imminent, while Mexico was also said to have denied the existence of a NAFTA handshake deal. (Politico/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designated NAFTA negotiator for incoming Mexican President AMLO said NAFTA talks are making good progress and are coming to an end, while he also expects US &amp; Mexican officials to have an agreement on outstanding issues by early next week. In related news, there were also reports that the incoming and outgoing Mexican administrations are said to have differences over inclusion of the energy chapter in the potential NAFTA agreement. (Newswires/WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US National Security Advisor Bolton says US will do &quot;other things&quot; beyond economic sanctions to pressure Iran. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are trading mostly higher (Eurostoxx 50 +0.3%) with underperformance in Switzerland&rsquo;s SMI (-0.2%), weighed on by heavyweights Nestle (-0.3%) and Roche (-0.5%). The consumer discretionary sector underperforms amid German-listed Continental downgrading guidance. Company shares fell 13.8% following the announcement, dragging the DAX 30 and the likes of Michelin (-5.3%), Pirelli (-3.8%) and Valeo (-5.8%) in sympathy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Holding above the 95.000 level as Dollar/majors consolidate post-Trump. The index has pulled up just shy of 95.400 from almost 95.000 when the fall-out from US President&rsquo;s tirade vs Fed tightening and Usd strength (partly due to FOMC hikes, but also Chinese/EU currency manipulation) was more pronounced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - The clear G10 underperformer as political uncertainty combines with RBA stability on the policy front and the aforementioned general Greenback rebound. Aud/Usd is back below 0.7350 after topping out around 0.7380 on Tuesday, and eying decent option expiry interest at the 0.7375 strike (circa 800 mn) on Thursday. Back to the RBA, Deputy Governor Labelle sees downward pressure on inflation subsiding eventually, but would like to be more confident that CPI will be sustained at target, adding that current accommodative policy will support this outcome, while returning to politics latest reports suggest that Liberal Party members are calling for a leadership meeting later tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY/NZD - Also making way for the partial Usd revival, but to a lesser extent with Cable back down below 1.2900 having run in to offers ahead of key technical resistance around 1.2926-30 and awaiting Brexit Minister Raab&rsquo;s what to do in the event of &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; advice on Thursday. Usd/Jpy hit supply and a chart buffer at 110.50 (100 HMA), while the Kiwi is pivoting 0.6700 with some underlying support from much stronger than expected NZ retail sales data overnight, and cross flows as Aud/Nzd slips back below 1.1000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/CAD - Bucking the overall trend and holding gains vs the Dollar as the Franc remains at the upper end of 0.9855-25 parameters, the single currency hovers just under 1.1600 and firmly above its 21 DMA (1.1547) after finding a base just ahead of 1.1500, and the Loonie maintains NAFTA/oil price momentum within a 1.3045-15 range, even though Canada denies knowledge of any official notification that a deal is imminent (in response to response about a handshake agreement between the US and Mexico tomorrow).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Domestic and geopolitical factors still plaguing several nations in the region and currencies, like the Try, Zar, Rub, Brl. Indeed, the Rand only derived fleeting support from SA inflation data that topped estimates on the headline front, albeit with a more benign core. FX pairs as much as 0.7% firmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds are underperforming, albeit marginally as pre-German 10 year auction hedges and concession have not really been unwound or reversed in wake of a somewhat mixed reception to the latest offering. Indeed, the benchmark future just dipped to a fresh 163.19 Eurex intraday low (-5 ticks vs +21 ticks at best), while Gilts remain close to their Liffe peak (+14 ticks vs -1 tick at the other &lsquo;extreme&rsquo;) and US Treasuries also retain the bulk of their overnight gains amidst yet more curve flattening ahead of the latest FOMC minutes, with MBA mortgage apps and existing home sales also on Wednesday&rsquo;s docket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following a larger than expected decline in API crude inventories last night, WTI (+1.3%) and Brent (+1.5%) trade on the front foot while concerns continue to linger over the potential repercussions of US oil related sanctions against Iran due to come into effect in November. US National Security Advisor Bolton, in an press conference, stated the US will do &ldquo;other things&rdquo; beyond economic sanctions to pressure Iran. Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti Oil Minister said he expects the oil market to remain stable until year-end, adding he expects oil exporters to reach an agreement on the mechanism to monitor oil supply by the end of the year. Elsewhere, spot gold (+0.1%) is relatively uneventful, while copper retreated ahead of US-China trade talks taking place today and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (17 Aug) -5.170M vs. Exp. -1.500M (Prev. +3.660M).

        "content": "<ul><li>The historical correlation between yield curve inversion and recession is impressive.&nbsp;This signal has worked well historically because US recessions have tended to follow overheating that led to restrictive policy. But it raises two problems. First, it is inconsistent: the decline in the term premium has dramatically changed the signal about the restrictiveness of policy. Second, it is narrow: recessions do not have to be preceded by restrictive monetary policy.</li>\r\n  <li>This does not mean that the yield curve is useless for assessing recession risk. In our view, the &ldquo;wisdom of the crowd&rdquo; embodied in the yield curve can provide useful input on two questions. First, the near-term forward spread provides a sense of the market&rsquo;s view of the economic outlook. Second, the market&rsquo;s view of neutral helps us judge how far into restrictive territory we have gone. At the moment, however, neither measure indicates heightened recession risk.</li>\r\n  <li>In gauging overheating risk, we think it is more straightforward to look directly at the economic data. We currently see moderate cause for concern: while price and wage pressures look contained for now, the US unemployment rate is headed to historically low levels.</li>\r\n  <li>Our views notwithstanding, would Fed officials view a yield curve inversion as a reason to pause rate hikes? On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said clearly that he would not vote for a hike that would knowingly invert the curve, and a few other Fed officials have also expressed concern about a possible inversion. Even so, we continue to think that the FOMC would ultimately decide to raise the policy rate in such a scenario if it felt it were the appropriate response to economic conditions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Energy names are amongst the outperformers, in-fitting with recent gains in the complex, while utility names underperform. In terms of individual movers, German-listed Continental shares plummeted after the tyre company downgraded guidance. Company shares fell 9.3% following the announcement, dragging the DAX 30 and the likes of Michelin (-3.0%), Pirelli (-1.7%) and Valeo (-3.0%) in sympathy .&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Holding above the 95.000 level as Dollar/majors consolidate post-Trump. The index has pulled up just shy of 95.400 from almost 95.000 when the fall-out from US President&rsquo;s tirade vs Fed tightening and Usd strength (partly due to FOMC hikes, but also Chinese/EU currency manipulation) was more pronounced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - The clear G10 underperformer as political uncertainty combines with RBA stability on the policy front and the aforementioned general Greenback rebound. Aud/Usd is back below 0.7350 after topping out around 0.7380 on Tuesday, and eying decent option expiry interest at the 0.7375 strike (circa 800 mn) on Thursday. Back to the RBA, Deputy Governor Labelle sees downward pressure on inflation subsiding eventually, but would like to be more confident that CPI will be sustained at target, adding that current accommodative policy will support this outcome, while returning to politics latest reports suggest that Liberal Party members are calling for a leadership meeting later tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY/NZD - Also making way for the partial Usd revival, but to a lesser extent with Cable back down below 1.2900 having run in to offers ahead of key technical resistance around 1.2926-30 and awaiting Brexit Minister Raab&rsquo;s what to do in the event of &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; advice on Thursday. Usd/Jpy hit supply and a chart buffer at 110.50 (100 HMA), while the Kiwi is pivoting 0.6700 with some underlying support from much stronger than expected NZ retail sales data overnight, and cross flows as Aud/Nzd slips back below 1.1000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/CAD - Bucking the overall trend and holding gains vs the Dollar as the Franc remains at the upper end of 0.9855-25 parameters, the single currency hovers just under 1.1600 and firmly above its 21 DMA (1.1547) after finding a base just ahead of 1.1500, and the Loonie maintains NAFTA/oil price momentum within a 1.3045-15 range, even though Canada denies knowledge of any official notification that a deal is imminent (in response to response about a handshake agreement between the US and Mexico tomorrow).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Domestic and geopolitical factors still plaguing several nations in the region and currencies, like the Try, Zar, Rub, Brl. Indeed, the Rand only derived fleeting support from SA inflation data that topped estimates on the headline front, albeit with a more benign core. FX pairs as much as 0.7% firmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds are underperforming, albeit marginally as pre-German 10 year auction hedges and concession have not really been unwound or reversed in wake of a somewhat mixed reception to the latest offering.

US National Security Advisor Bolton, in an press conference, stated the US will do &ldquo;other things&rdquo; beyond economic sanctions to pressure Iran. Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti Oil Minister said he expects the oil market to remain stable until year-end, adding he expects oil exporters to reach an agreement on the mechanism to monitor oil supply by the end of the year. Elsewhere, spot gold (+0.1%) is relatively uneventful, while copper retreated ahead of US-China trade talks taking place today and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This was after Trump&rsquo;s former campaign manager Manafort was found guilty on 8 counts including tax fraud, while former Trump lawyer Cohen also pleaded guilty at a court hearing and stated he violated campaign financing laws at the direction of a &#39;candidate&#39; which his lawyer further elaborated on and alleged that Trump directed Cohen to commit a crime. ASX 200 (-0.5%) declined from the open with losses in financials weighing heavily on the index although telecoms outperformed on M&amp;A news with TPG in merger discussions with Vodafone Hutchison Australia, while Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) was also initially pressured but then recovered with auto names cheering recent reports that US auto tariffs could be delayed. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) are both subdued with US and China said to be pessimistic heading into trade discussions and after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remains pressured and is edging closer towards the 95.00 level as its major counterparts hold on to this week&rsquo;s gains, with EUR/USD biding its time after the recent test of the 1.1600 level and with GBP/USD reclaiming the 1.2900 handle. Elsewhere. MXN and CAD were underpinned on reports US is to announce a &lsquo;handshake&rsquo; NAFTA deal related to Mexico on Thursday, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are also higher at the expense of the greenback, while antipodeans are mixed with AUD contained by recent political infighting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains as prices tracked the upside in T-notes and with the BoJ also in the market for JGBs in the belly to super-long end.</p>\r\n",
