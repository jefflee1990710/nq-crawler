        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: Trump upstages OPEC+; US 10yr yield highest since 2014",
        "content": "<p><strong>US MARKET WRAP 20 April 2018: Trump upstages OPEC+; 10yr yield highest since 2014<br />* SNAP-SHOT: </strong>Stocks lower, USD up, Treasuries down, oil down.<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW:</strong> Trump warns on high oil prices; CAD CPI miss, retail firm; Fedspeak, ECB sources.<br /><strong>* NEXT WEEK: </strong>ECB, BOJ, Riksbank, PMIs, US and UK GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*TRADE WARS: </strong>As expected, no agreement was reached on the NAFTA front today. Mexico&#39;s Economy Minister Guajardo emphasised that there is still work to be done, and while negotiators are working with great commitment (echoed by his Canadian counterpart, Freeland), any agreement must be comprehensive, not just sector-level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB SPEAK: ECB sources</strong> report that the normalisation path is not affected by the recent string of soft data, sources say QE still to end by the end of 2018. Other sources reports said that the central bank sees scope to wait until July to signal an end for its asset purchase programme, adding that ECB is said to have had no talks on interest rate path after QE ends. Elsewhere, <strong>ECB&#39;s Draghi</strong> repeated that measures of underlying inflation are subdued but expected to rise gradually over the medium-term; and growth momentum will continue; the ECB president also noted that FX volatility and financial conditions represent sources of uncertainty which require monitoring. He said uncertainties warrant patience, persistence and prudence, adding his familiar line that an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary. <strong>ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann</strong>, speaking with his Bundesbank hat on, didn&rsquo;t directly comment on monetary policy, but noted that German economic conditions are improving, still expecting a boom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FEDSPEAK: Fed&#39;s Williams</strong> (voter, hawk) noted the neutral rate appears much lower than in the past and sees stronger global growth lifting demand for US exports, helping to reduce disinflationary pressures<strong>. Fed&#39;s Brainard</strong> (voter) again argued for a gradual tightening path, noting that while the economy is solid, uncertainties around the outlook warrant caution. She repeats her data-dependent stance with regards to the number of hikes, suggesting gradual hikes are appropriate. Growth has been decent but cannot let guard down, she warned. On trade uncertainties, she said escalations might dent confidence and supply chains. Elsewhere, she said asset valuations are stretched relative to historic benchmarks. <strong>Fed&#39;s Evans</strong> (non-voter, dovish) sounded slightly more upbeat in pointing out the fact inflation is rising faster than expected is a sign of a stronger economy that can withstand further rate increases, though gradual rate hikes continue to be appropriate<strong>. Fed&#39;s Kashkari </strong>(dove, non-voter) surprised the long-end of the curve has risen further after fiscal stimulus; surprised by the flatness of the yield curve, warrants caution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE SPEAK: BOE&rsquo;s</strong> <strong>Saunders</strong> (hawk) said UK no longer needs as much stimulus due to little slack and rising cost pressures, adding that the pace of further hikes are likely to be &ldquo;gradual&rdquo; not &ldquo;glacial&rdquo;. Saunders also said that the notion of soft data in Q1 was questionable due to weather and history of upward revisions. On wages, he stated that latest average earnings data was as expected, and inflation pressure seems to be shifting to domestic from external. He was unsure if there is a greater range of views on MPC than normal, to comment on latest market pricing on rate rises following yesterday&#39;s comments by Governor Carney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: Canadian</strong> <strong>CPI</strong> headline rose to a three-year high at 2.3% YY, partly helped by base effects. The BOC&rsquo;s preferred measures (an average of the trimmed, median and common CPI measures) ticked down by 3bps to 2.00%, in line with the BOC&rsquo;s objectives. <strong>Canadian</strong> <strong>retail sales</strong>, meanwhile, was buoyed by vehicle sales. Capital Economics noted that following downward revisions to retail sales, February&rsquo;s gain followed six months of unusual weakness, which suggests that heavily-indebted households have been hit hard by rising interest rates, which is one of the Bank of Canada&rsquo;s biggest fears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.9% at 2670, NDX -1.6% at 6666, DJI -0.8% at 24467. SECTORS:</strong> Consumer cyclicals -1.1%, consumer non-cyclicals -1.7%, energy -0.6%, financials -0.2%, healthcare -0.6%, industrials -0.5%, materials -0.8%, tech -1.5%, telecoms -1.2%, utilities -1.0%. <strong>TODAY&rsquo;S ACTION:</strong> Futures were trading sub-2700 pre-cash open, and sank after the cash day got underway, with AAPL weighing. While stocks were lower on the day, ESM8 contract is pretty-much flat on the week. <strong>YIELDS: </strong>Some suggested that stocks were under pressure after the latest bout of steepening along the Treasury curve, where yields on 10s approach cycle highs once again. Banks were said to benefit, and the financial sector was one of the better performers, albeit still red. <strong>TECH SECTOR:</strong> Apple (AAPL) was hit after concerns about weak iPhone demand, with losses exacerbated by a cut in price target at Morgan Stanley, weighing on the Dow and applying pressure to the tech sector (INTC, CSCO and MSFT all lower, and along with FB, all report Q1 numbers next week). <strong>EARNINGS:</strong> In earnings, Reuters reported that of the 87 S&amp;P 500 companies to have reported thus far, 79% have beat expectations. GE&rsquo;s results topped estimates and the co reiterated 2018 forecasts, propelling shares. Schlumberger (SLB) was lower on a mix of early oil price weakness as well as an average earnings report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI (June) settled 7 cents higher at $68.40/bbl; Brent (June) settled 28 cents higher at 74.06/bbl.</strong> The <strong>OPEC monitoring committee</strong> ended its meeting with no fresh new recommendations. The interesting development was that WHILE THE Saudis were banging the drum about the need to strengthen future OPEC+ cooperation, the Russians merely reiterated their commitment to the current deal until the end of this year (sources reported), and the Russian energy minister himself suggested that producers could begin easing output restrictions as soon as this year. Either way, the OPEC+ meeting was overshadowed after <strong>US President Trump</strong> tweeted &lsquo;oil prices artificially high very high! No good and will not be accepted!&rsquo;, initiating a series of responses from oil representatives, among which the Iraq oil minister and the UAE Energy Minister both opposed the view. Policymakers continued to allude to Trump&rsquo;s accusation, arguing that the supply cut deal has also helped US producers, with some encouraging producers who aren&rsquo;t part of the deal to join in the efforts. Elsewhere, there continued to be focus on yesterday&rsquo;s report that the Saudis wanted <strong>prices</strong> $80+ and perhaps even $100: Russian Energy Minister Novak said there was potential for prices hitting $80 in April, but said it would not reflect fundamentals, while OPEC Sec Gen Barkindo said the cartel has no price objective, highlighting the objective to restore stability. Baker Hughes oil rigs rose by 5 in the week to 820; gas rigs were unchanged, nudging the total rig count up by 5 to 1008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES:</strong> <strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settles 9 ticks lower at 119-17+.</strong> It was another day of bear-steepening, with shorter dated yields rising by under 2bps, and long end yields higher by just over 3bps at settlement. But while the steepening curve was attributed for part of the jitters in stocks on Friday, actual curve spreads only saw modest widening (2s30s was were most of the action was at, and was only steeper by c.2bps). In post-settlement trade, the 10yr note rose to near 2.96, reaching levels last seen in 2014. The shape of the yield curve has attracted attention of Fed policymakers this week, once again; earlier, Bullard again shared concerns of yield curve inversion within the next six months. On Friday, Kashkari said he was surprised longer-dated yields hadn&rsquo;t risen more considering US fiscal stimulus. Next week, the UST sells2s, 5s, and 7s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> <strong>DXY:</strong> ends another roller-coaster week on a firmer footing, and above the 90.00 handle. The Greenback was bid vs all G10 peers and EM currencies that have been clawing back some lost ground, with the DXY challenging last week&rsquo;s peak and eyeing 90.600 next before 90.900 ahead of 91.000. <strong>AUD and NZD:</strong> a race to the bottom, or at least down under between the two antipodean Dollars, with a downbeat jobs report and benign Q1 inflation release undermining Aussie sentiment, while it also failed to derive any momentum from neutral/dovish RBA minutes or China&rsquo;s selective RRR cut. AUD tried to clear the psychological 0.7800 barrier and key technical resistance just above on more than one occasion this week, when the broader risk tone was positive, but failed each time and has subsequently reversed through various chart supports and 0.7700 to circa 0.7660 &ndash; next downside levels around 0.7640 and 0.7610. A similar pattern for the Kiwi that briefly hovered above 0.7400, but is now looking at 0.7200 having breached its 100 DMA between 0.7215-10, then 0.7195 and the 200 DMA at 0.7185 if the nearest big figure gives way. <strong>EUR: </strong>&nbsp;was the next biggest major loser on Friday vs the USD, as the single currency broke out of its 1.2300-1.2400 recent range to the downside amid more signs of a slowing Eurozone economy (activity data/surveys and an unexpected downward tweak to final CPI). Leading institutes also contended that the ECB is unlikely to raise rates until end 2019 vs mid-next year market expectations that the Bank itself has largely endorsed, ahead of next week&rsquo;s policy meeting. EURUSD now looks at supports ahead of 1.2200, like 1.2240 and 1.2215. <strong>CAD:</strong> a still cautious BOC was the catalyst for the Loonie to start unwinding NAFTA and payroll inspired gains vs the USD, but softer than forecast CPI data (over better than expected headline retail sales) prompted another reversal with USDCAD up through 1.2700 vs around 1.2520 on Tuesday. <strong>GBP</strong>: pound&rsquo;s heady April rally that saw Cable hit a fresh post-Brexit vote peak on Monday (circa 1.4375) was scuppered by softer than forecast headline average earnings, CPI and an even bigger miss on UK retail sales, which prompted BoE Governor Carney to &lsquo;manage&rsquo; expectations for a May hike, which were close to unanimous heading into this weak. MPC hawk Saunders partially redressed the balance, but odds for a tightening next month are now evens at best and marginally against elsewhere. GBPUSD is now only just above 1.4000, with support seen around 1.3960, EURGBP is now firmly above 0.8700 and almost up to 0.8800 before the single currency succumbed to its own dose of weakness. <strong>CHF and JPY:</strong> Bad weak for the safe-havens, with the CHF suffering from Russian asset selling on the back of sanctions, and not supported by the SNB. USDCHF up around 0.9750 and EURCHF just over 1.2000 at one stage. USDJPY finally up through exporter offers and a key resistance area from 107.50-55 on the way to just eclipsing its recent 107.78 peak and picking off exporter offers ahead of 108.00 amid importer demand. <strong>EM:</strong> hard fought recovery gains unravelled to various degrees on the general USD bid to close out the week as Treasury yields retested 2018 peaks.</p>\r\n",

The interesting development was that WHILE THE Saudis were banging the drum about the need to strengthen future OPEC+ cooperation, the Russians merely reiterated their commitment to the current deal until the end of this year (sources reported), and the Russian energy minister himself suggested that producers could begin easing output restrictions as soon as this year. Either way, the OPEC+ meeting was overshadowed after <strong>US President Trump</strong> tweeted &lsquo;oil prices artificially high very high! No good and will not be accepted!&rsquo;, initiating a series of responses from oil representatives, among which the Iraq oil minister and the UAE Energy Minister both opposed the view. Policymakers continued to allude to Trump&rsquo;s accusation, arguing that the supply cut deal has also helped US producers, with some encouraging producers whoa ren&rsquo;t part of the deal to join in the efforts. Elsewhere, there continued to be focus on yesterday&rsquo;s report that the Saudis wanted <strong>prices</strong> $80+ and perhaps even $100: Russian Energy Minister Novak said there was potential for prices hitting $80 in April, but said it would not reflect fundamentals, while Opec Sec Gen Barkindo said the cartel has no price objective, highlighting the objective to restore stability.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending yet another roller-coaster week on the up, or at least a firmer footing and with the index probing above 90.000 again. The Greenback is bid vs all G10 peers and EM currencies that have been clawing back some lost ground, with the DXY challenging last week&rsquo;s peak and eyeing 90.600 next before 90.900 ahead of 91.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A race to the bottom or at least down under between the 2 antipodean Dollars, with a downbeat jobs report and benign Q1 inflation release undermining sentiment, while the Aud also failed to derive any momentum from neutral to dovish RBA minutes or China&rsquo;s selective RRR cut. Aud/Usd tried to clear the psychological 0.7800 barrier and key technical resistance just above on more than one occasion when the broader risk tone was positive, but failed each time and has subsequently reversed through various chart supports and 0.7700 to circa 0.7660 &ndash; next downside levels around 0.7640 and 0.7610. A similar pattern for the Kiwi that briefly hovered above 0.7400, but is now looking at 0.7200 having breached its 100 DMA between 0.7215-10, then 0.7195 and the 200 DMA at 0.7185 if the nearest big figure gives way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next biggest major loser on Friday vs the Usd, as the single currency broke out of its 1.2300-1.2400 recent range to the downside amidst more signs of a slowing Eurozone economy via activity data/surveys and an unexpected downward tweak to final CPI y/y. Leading institutes also contended that the ECB is unlikely to raise rates until end 2019 vs mid-next year market expectations that the Bank itself has largely endorsed, ahead of next week&rsquo;s policy meeting. Eur/Usd now looking at supports ahead of 1.2200, like 1.2240 and 1.2215.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A still cautious BoC was the the catalyst for the Loonie to start unwinding NAFTA and payroll inspired gains vs the Usd, but softer than forecast CPI data (over better than expected headline retail sales) prompted another reversal with Usd/Cad up through 1.2700 vs around 1.2520 on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound&rsquo;s heady April rally that saw Cable hit a fresh post-Brexit vote peak on Monday (circa 1.4375) was scuppered by softer than forecast headline average earnings, CPI and an even bigger miss on UK retail sales, which prompted BoE Governor Carney to &lsquo;manage&rsquo; expectations for a May hike, which were close to unanimous heading into this weak. MPC hawk Saunders partially redressed the balance, but odds for a tightening next month are now evens at best and marginally against elsewhere. Gbp/Usd now only just ahead of 1.4000, with support seen around 1.3960, Eur/Gbp firmly above 0.8700 and almost up to 0.8800 before the single currency succumbed to its own end of week slump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bad weak for the safe-havens, with the Franc suffering from Russian asset selling on the back of sanctions and not supported by the SNB. Usd/Chf up around 0.9750 and Eur/Chf just over 1.2000 at one stage. Usd/Jpy finally up through exporter offers and a key resistance area from 107.50-55 on the way to just eclipsing its recent 107.78 peak and picking off exporter offers ahead of 108.00 amidst importer demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hard fought recovery gains unravelled to various degrees on the general Usd bid to close out the week as Treasury yields retested 2018 peaks.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) opened negative although losses were mostly pared as the Energy sector remained afloat in Australia and with the Japanese benchmark finding some relief from a weaker JPY. Elsewhere, Taiwan&rsquo;s Taiex (-1.7%) is the laggard as TSMC slumped following the weak revenue outlook, while Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.5%) were lacklustre after the PBoC skipped open market operations and as trade tensions lingered. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued as yields tracked their US counterparts higher, although the downside to JGBs was also limited amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 710bln in the belly to super-long end and with the amounts of the Rinban announcement unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly injection of CNY 470bln vs. Prev. CNY 100bln net drain. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.2897 (Prev. 6.2832)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Japanese National CPI (Mar) Y/Y 1.1% vs. Exp. 1.1% (Prev. 1.5%)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Japanese National CPI Ex. Fresh Food (Mar) Y/Y 0.9% vs. Exp. 0.9% (Prev. 1.0%)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Japanese National CPI Ex. Food &amp; Energy (Mar) Y/Y 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.5%)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Mester (Voter, Hawk) says further rate hikes are appropriate in 2018 and 2019, adds gradual hikes would help avert overheating and financial stability risks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BoE&rsquo;s Saunders (Hawk) says UK no longer needs as much stimulus as before, due to little slack and rising cost pressures. Adding that pace of further rate hikes are likely to be &ldquo;gradual&rdquo; not &ldquo;glacial&rdquo;. Saunders says significance of data points is questionable due to weather and history of upward revisions. (Newswires)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU rejects Theresa May&#39;s Brexit Irish border solution as doubts grow over whether UK can leave customs union. (Newswires)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Barnier says at least 75% of the Brexit draft deal has been agreed on, the remaining 25% includes serious issues such as Ireland, &quot;no way&quot; to cherry-pick a deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Audit Office says Brexit divorce bill will be over the GBP 35bln-39bln estimate by PM May due to GBP 3bln extra budget payout and USD 2.9bln overseas aid fund. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Approaching the weeks end equity bourses marginally higher (Eurostoxx +0.1%), with positivity noted in the FTSE (+0.5%), following lowered expectation of a UK rate hike, and a weaker GBP. The telecom sector is currently outperforming (+1.1%) driven by Telia&rsquo;s strong earnings results. The sector underperformer is currently energy (-0.4%), driven by falling oil prices. Significant individual stock news was noted in Shire (-4.5%) with Allergan pulling out of the acquisition deal leading to underperformance, Pfizer and Abbvie, however, are said to be suitors. Earning outperformance was noted at Ericsson (+16%), and underperformance at Reckitt Benckiser (-5.8%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back on the 90.000 handle, but again largely on the back of the travails of others in the G10 fold, and the index still needs to establish a firm foothold above the big figure to mount a serious challenge of nearest upside resistance levels ahead of 91.000. Note, 90.362, 90.600 and 90.900 have all been tested, but rejected, and more recently 90.273</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 UK data misses (albeit with some parts of the latest jobs and earnings report relatively strong) put a serious dent in Sterling&rsquo;s seasonal advance, but &lsquo;confirmation&rsquo; from BoE Governor Carney that this week&rsquo;s disappointing releases could keep the MPC on hold in May has thrown a real spanner in the works, as Cable looks in danger of losing grip of 1.4000 and Eur/Gbp approaches 0.8800. Technical support around 1.4020 holding in for now, and remaining (some might say foolhardy) Pound longs/bulls have received a reprieve from broadly hawkish comments from Saunders, that leaves a hike at the next meeting in the balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Gbp&rsquo;s fall from grace has been swift and eye-catching, the Kiwi is actually underperforming and the biggest loser vs the Usd as 0.7300 gave way and the retreat gathers pace to a circa 0.7220 low, so far. The Nzd is still feeling the after-effects of broadly benign if not outright soft inflation data and the prospect this will keep the RBNZ neutral for longer. Aud also extending its reversal from round number resistance vs the Usd, and now testing the water just below 0.7700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie continues to consolidate off highs vs the Greenback between 1.2650-80, with NAFTA negotiations progressing, but some way off completion, and the Cad eyeing more independent direction from top-tier data today in the form of CPI and retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/JPY/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All softer vs the Dollar, though within recent/familiar ranges on the wide, as Eur/Usd meanders between 1.2290-1.2390, Usd/Jpy sits in the middle of 107.35-75 parameters and Usd/Chf is even more tightly bound from 0.9705-30. However, for those unsure on Thursday Eur/Chf clearly crossed the 1.2000 line earlier amidst more SNB assurances that policy is not about to change even though the Franc is less highly valued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts appear to have stabilised after recoiling further from early Liffe highs to 121.45 at one stage (+10 ticks on the day and 52 ticks off the 122.00 peak), and maintain a healthy advantage over both Bunds and US Treasuries on the marked reduction in pricing for a near term BoE rate hike, and by implication the chances of 2 tightening moves in 2018 overall. Meanwhile, technicals appear to have at least partly reined in Bunds as the early 158.40 Eurex intraday top aligned with declining trend-line resistance on some charts, and shorts subsequently forced the benchmark future down to and just through a 158.05 downside objective to fill a gap just below (158.01 which is the new session low, -16 ticks vs +23 ticks at the other extreme). USTs rather side-lined amidst all this and narrowly mixed across the curve after choppy trade this week, but higher yields ultimately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil was lower on European equity close on Thursday, and currently trading flat on the day with WTI at USD 68.38 and Brent at USD 73.85. This comes as some profit taking is being seen following a touch on over 2 year highs. OPEC specifically we have heard from various oil ministers speaking at the OPEC JMMC meeting, as well as comments from Russia&rsquo;s Novak saying OPEC and Non-OPEC countries could ease output reductions as soon as 2018, but no move was noted on this. Gold tracking lower for the day, currently down -0.3%, largely due to a strengthening USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi energy minister Falih says there is a need to strengthen OPEC and Non-OPEC cooperation beyond the current agreement as this is critical to restore market confidence. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia says it is committed to OPEC/Non-OPEC supply cut agreement until the end of the year; according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Approaching the weeks end equity bourses largely tracking down (Eurostoxx -0.2%), with positivity noted in the FTSE (+0.3%), following lowered expectation of a UK rate hike, and a weaker GBP. The telecom sector is currently outperforming (+0.9%) driven by Telia&rsquo;s strong earnings results. The sector underperformer is currently energy (-0.4%), driven by falling oil prices. Significant individual stock news was noted in Shire (-4.5%) with Allergan pulling out of the acquisition deal leading to underperformance, Pfizer and Abbvie, however, are said to be suitors. Earning outperformance was noted at Ericsson (+16%), and underperformance at Reckitt Benckiser (-5.8%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back on the 90.000 handle, but again largely on the back of the travails of others in the G10 fold, and the index still needs to establish a firm foothold above the big figure to mount a serious challenge of nearest upside resistance levels ahead of 91.000. Note, 90.362, 90.600 and 90.900 have all been tested, but rejected, and more recently 90.273.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 UK data misses (albeit with some parts of the latest jobs and earnings report relatively strong) put a serious dent in Sterling&rsquo;s seasonal advance, but &lsquo;confirmation&rsquo; from BoE Governor Carney that this week&rsquo;s disappointing releases could keep the MPC on hold in May has thrown a real spanner in the works, as Cable looks in danger of losing grip of 1.4000 and Eur/Gbp approaches 0.8800. Technical support around 1.4020 holding in for now, and remaining (some might say foolhardy) Pound longs/bulls are looking for rate hike voter Saunders to redress the balance (10.30BST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Gbp&rsquo;s fall from grace has been swift and eye-catching, the Kiwi is actually underperforming and the biggest loser vs the Usd as 0.7300 gave way and the retreat gathers pace to a circa 0.7225 low, so far. The Nzd is still feeling the after-effects of broadly benign if not outright soft inflation data and the prospect this will keep the RBNZ neutral for longer. Aud also extending its reversal from round number resistance vs the Usd, and now only just keeping afloat of 0.7700 after a poor jobs update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie continues to consolidate off highs vs the Greenback between 1.2650-80, with NAFTA negotiations progressing, but some way off completion, and the Cad eyeing more independent direction from top-tier data today in the form of CPI and retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All softer vs the Dollar, though within recent/familiar ranges on the wide, as Eur/Usd meanders between 1.2300-1.2400, Usd/Jpy sits in the middle of 107.35-75 parameters and Usd/Chf is even more tightly bound from 0.9705-30. However, for those unsure on Thursday Eur/Chf clearly crossed the 1.2000 line earlier amidst more SNB assurances that policy is not about to change even though the Franc is less highly valued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts appear to have stabilised after recoiling further from early Liffe highs to 121.48 at one stage (+13 ticks on the day and 52 ticks off the 122.00 peak), and maintain a healthy advantage over both Bunds and US Treasuries on the marked reduction in pricing for a near term BoE rate hike, and by implication the chances of 2 tightening moves in 2018 overall. Meanwhile, technicals appear to have at least partly reined in Bunds as the early 158.40 Eurex intraday top aligned with declining trend-line resistance on some charts, and shorts subsequently forced the benchmark future down to and just through a 158.05 downside objective to fill a gap just below (158.01 which is the new session low, -16 ticks vs +23 ticks at the other extreme). USTs rather side-lined amidst all this and narrowly mixed across the curve after choppy trade this week, but higher yields ultimately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil was lower on European equity close on Thursday, and currently trading flat on the day with WTI at USD 68.38 and Brent at USD 73.85. This comes as some profit taking is being seen following a touch on over 2 year highs. OPEC specifically we have heard from various oil ministers speaking at the OPEC JMMC meeting, as well as comments from Russia&rsquo;s Novak saying OPEC and Non-OPEC countries could ease output reductions as soon as 2018, but no move was noted on this.&nbsp;Gold tracking lower for the day, currently down -0.3%, largely due to a strengthening USD.</p>\r\n",

Note, 90.362, 90.600 and 90.900 have all been tested, but rejected, and more recently 90.273.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 UK data misses (albeit with some parts of the latest jobs and earnings report relatively strong) put a serious dent in Sterling&rsquo;s seasonal advance, but &lsquo;confirmation&rsquo; from BoE Governor Carney that this week&rsquo;s disappointing releases could keep the MPC on hold in May has thrown a real spanner in the works, as Cable looks in danger of losing grip of 1.4000 and Eur/Gbp approaches 0.8800. Technical support around 1.4020 holding in for now, and remaining (some might say foolhardy) Pound longs/bulls are looking for rate hike voter Saunders to redress the balance (10.30BST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Gbp&rsquo;s fall from grace has been swift and eye-catching, the Kiwi is actually underperforming and the biggest loser vs the Usd as 0.7300 gave way and the retreat gathers pace to a circa 0.7225 low, so far. The Nzd is still feeling the after-effects of broadly benign if not outright soft inflation data and the prospect this will keep the RBNZ neutral for longer. Aud also extending its reversal from round number resistance vs the Usd, and now only just keeping afloat of 0.7700 after a poor jobs update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie continues to consolidate off highs vs the Greenback between 1.2650-80, with NAFTA negotiations progressing, but some way off completion, and the Cad eyeing more independent direction from top-tier data today in the form of CPI and retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/JPY/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All softer vs the Dollar, though within recent/familiar ranges on the wide, as Eur/Usd meanders between 1.2300-1.2400, Usd/Jpy sits in the middle of 107.35-75 parameters and Usd/Chf is even more tightly bound from 0.9705-30. However, for those unsure on Thursday Eur/Chf clearly crossed the 1.2000 line earlier amidst more SNB assurances that policy is not about to change even though the Franc is less highly valued.</p>\r\n",

Gilts are now losing more impetus as Bunds retreat from their best levels, former down to 121.58&nbsp;(+23 ticks&nbsp;vs +65 ticks at best) and latter at 158.20 (+3 ticks vs +23 ticks at the early Eurex high), as EU cash indices essentially idle, but the FTSE gets a boost from Pound weakness. However, the Short Sterling strip continues to ratchet back tightening expectations with gains in some contracts almost double digit at one stage. Ahead, BoE&rsquo;s Saunders is scheduled to speak at 10.30BST and the hawkish hike dissenter may not be so willing to change his tune, so perhaps some profits being booked and positions pared in the run up.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) opened negative although losses were mostly pared as the Energy sector remained afloat in Australia and with the Japanese benchmark finding some relief from a weaker JPY. Elsewhere, Taiwan&rsquo;s Taiex (-1.6%) is the laggard as TSMC slumped following the weak revenue outlook, while Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) were lacklustre after the PBoC skipped open market operations and as trade tensions lingered. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued as yields tracked their US counterparts higher, although the downside to JGBs was also limited amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 710bln in the belly to super-long end and with the amounts of the Rinban announcement unchanged.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade mostly lower after the subdued tone rolled over from Wall St where all major indices finished in the red, with underperformance in the Nasdaq amid tech woes after semiconductor giant TSMC downgraded its revenue forecasts on concerns of softer smartphone demand. As such ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) opened negative although losses were mostly pared as the Financial and Energy sectors remained afloat in Australia and with the Japanese benchmark finding relief from a weaker JPY. Elsewhere, Taiwan is the laggard as TSMC slumps following the weak revenue outlook, while Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) are lacklustre after the PBoC skipped open market operations, although this still resulted to a net weekly injection. Furthermore, China Mofcom announced to extend anti-dumping measures on pulp imports from US, China and Brazil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD has held on to recent gains with the USD-index eyeing the 90.00 level to the upside which has kept its major counterparts subdued, with GBP/USD the notable fallout during US trade. This was after BoE Governor Carney cast doubt on a May rate hike after he acknowledged mixed data and said there will likely be differences of views on MPC at May meeting, while he also noted that the MPC is conscious that there are other meetings over the course of this year. Elsewhere, antipodeans extended on losses and USD/JPY is higher after breaking through resistance at 107.50, which also followed an expected softening of Japanese CPI numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued amid the improvement of risk appetite in Japan and as yields track their US counterparts higher, although the downside to JGBs is also limited amid the BoJ presence in the market for JPY 710bln in the belly to super-long end and with the amounts of the Rinban announcement unchanged.</p>\r\n",
