(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond said remaining in the customs union is not the best solution for the UK but should still seek close ties with EU following Brexit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior Brexiteers are said to be concerned and have warned that PM is supporting a hybrid plan for post-Brexit relationship with EU that would make trade deals with other countries impossible and in which the UK would collect customs duties on EU&rsquo;s behalf for goods to the EU. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&rsquo;s team reportedly privately admitted that the UK may have to accept permanent membership of a European customs union. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sources reported that ECB normalisation path not affected by the recent string of soft data and stated that QE is still to end by the end of 2018.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said that there is no price objective to OPEC or in a deal with non-OPEC members and highlighted the objective is to restore stability, which followed an earlier tweet by President Trump that oil prices are artificially very high which he noted was no good and will not be accepted. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea announced it will stop nuclear and ICBM testing effective April 21<sup>st</sup> and will start dismantling a nuclear test site in the north. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that the US is continuing dialogue with China and are cautiously optimistic on reaching an agreement. Mnuchin added he may possibly visit China, although he suggested that nothing was confirmed and that it was being considered. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Brainard (Voter, Dovish) reiterated view on gradual hikes and said that the economy is solid but noted uncertainties around the outlook given international trade. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Williams (Voter, Hawkish) said neutral rate appears much lower than in the past and that he expects &#39;new normal&#39; for Fed&#39;s balance sheet to be around USD 3trln. Furthermore, Williams said that stronger global growth lifts demand for US exports which helps to reduce disinflationary pressures. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Evans (Non-Voter, Dovish) said if inflation rises faster than expected it is a sign of a stronger economy that can withstand further rate increases, while he added that gradual rate hikes continue to be appropriate. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Non-Voter, Dovish) is said to be surprised the long-end of the curve has risen further after fiscal stimulus and is also surprised by the flatness of the yield curve, which he said warrants caution. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Futures were trading sub-2700 pre-cash open on Friday and sank after the cash day got underway, with AAPL weighing. While stocks were lower on the day, ESM8 contract is pretty-much flat on the week. YIELDS: Some suggested that stocks were under pressure after the latest bout of steepening along the Treasury curve, where yields on 10s approach cycle highs once again. Banks were said to benefit, and the financial sector was one of the better performers, albeit still red. TECH SECTOR: Apple (AAPL) was hit after concerns about weak iPhone demand, with losses exacerbated by a cut in price target at Morgan Stanley, weighing on the Dow and applying pressure to the tech sector (INTC, CSCO and MSFT all lower, and along with FB, all report Q1 numbers next week). EARNINGS: In earnings, Reuters reported that of the 87 S&amp;P 500 companies to have reported thus far, 79% have beat expectations. GE&rsquo;s results topped estimates and the co reiterated 2018 forecasts, propelling shares. Schlumberger (SLB) was lower on a mix of early oil price weakness as well as an average earnings report. SPX -0.9% at 2670, NDX -1.6% at 6666, DJI -0.8% at 24467.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was another day of bear-steepening, with shorter dated yields rising by under 2bps, and long end yields higher by just over 3bps at settlement. But while the steepening curve was attributed for part of the jitters in stocks on Friday, actual curve spreads only saw modest widening (2s30s was were most of the action was at, and was only steeper by c.2bps). In post-settlement trade, the 10yr note rose to near 2.96, reaching levels last seen in 2014. The shape of the yield curve has attracted attention of Fed policymakers this week, once again; earlier, Bullard again shared concerns of yield curve inversion within the next six months. On Friday, Kashkari said he was surprised longer-dated yields hadn&rsquo;t risen more considering US fiscal stimulus. Next week, the UST sells2s, 5s, and 7s. US 10yr T-Notes futures settles 9 ticks lower at 119-17+.</p>\r\n",
