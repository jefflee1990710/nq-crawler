Furthermore, ECB noted that uncertainties around inflation are receding, that expectations remain that H1 slowdown was temporary and that the winding down of asset purchases will be subject to incoming data. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&rsquo;s Deputy PM and Five-Star leader Di Maio stated his party will vote to suspend EU funding next year if on Friday European Commission does not get a deal for other states to take in some of migrants on an Italian coastguard ship.

There were also comments from Russia&rsquo;s Finance Ministry that the central bank&rsquo;s decision to pause FX buying will not affect the ministry&rsquo;s planned FX purchases for the budget. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Sea Oil strikes are reportedly to continue as talks with Total have broken down. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bostic (Voter, Dove) said the FOMC has spent some time discussing the yield curve and that outlook is for above trend expansion in the coming quarters, while he also noted trade uncertainty as the chief downside risk.

In related news, there were comments from Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland that Canada would need to &#39;agree to any final conclusion&#39; achieved on rules of origin in NAFTA talks between the US and Mexico.

However, gains were short lived as gains were completely erased following Yuan weakness as well as some traders citing unconfirmed reports that Special Counsel Mueller plans to claim that Trump Jr lied to the FBI over the Trump Tower meeting (note, this is an unconfirmed rumour), while some also suggested weakness in BABA shares was a contributing factor. In terms of individual stocks, AMD (AMD) was higher after Rosenblatt raised the co.&rsquo;s price target to a street high of $30 from $27. Walmart (WMT) was slightly lower after a UK competition watchdog started its formal investigation into the planned $7.3bln merger between the co.&rsquo;s supermarket chain ASDA, and Sainsbury (SBRY LN). L Brands (LB) was under pressure on Thursday following poor earnings. LB slightly beat on both top &amp; bottom lines, however, the co. lowered FY18 and Q3 EPS forecasts. Synopsys (SNPS) outperformed after both EPS &amp; revenue were higher than expectations. Alibaba (BABA) was indecisive after its EPS beat but revenues fell, with the stock initially opening higher but giving up its gains as investors focused on the operating margin which fell 10% Q/Q and 35% y/y due to Ant Financial expenses, as well as the investment BABA is making in new areas. SPX -0.2% at 2857, NDX -0.1% at 7414, DJI -0.3% at 25657.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury sold $14bln of 5-year TIPS, which sold at the highest yield since 2009, stopping through by 0.1bps. In the week of 27 August, the US Treasury plans to issue $36bln of new 2-year notes on Monday, $37bln of new 5-year notes on Tuesday, and new $31bln of new 7-year notes on Wednesday, for total of $104bln. On Thursday, the curve was mixed, though once again, there were new cyclical flats for the 2s5s and 2s10s, as has become almost customary on a daily basis. US 10-Year T-notes settled 1 tick lower at 120-19.</p>\r\n",

China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said it was hopeful that a good result will come out of the low-level US in trade talks, adding that it was hopeful of the US meeting it halfway. Separately, the Commerce Ministry said it was regretful that the decision made by Australia to ban Huawei and ZTE from the country&rsquo;s 5G network, due to national security concerns, noting it will have a negative effect on bilateral business interests. US President Trump noted China&rsquo;s economy is down lately and emphasized that not enough focus is being placed on the region, adding that tariffs on tech is leading to economic gains. He also announced the US worth has increased by 10 trillion dollars since the election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo said that August is the official timeline to try and get a deal done on NAFTA; he added they are doing their best to finish talks as soon as possible but noted that there are always sticking points in negotiations. Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland also reiterated similar comments from last night noting US &amp; Mexican progress on bilateral talks &lsquo;is an essential, encouraging step&rsquo; towards a new deal and specified Canada would need to &#39;agree to any final conclusion&#39; achieved on rules of origin in NAFTA talks between the US and Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s George (Hawk) said she favours two more rate hikes this year; adding that a 2.5%-3.0% neutral rate is reasonable estimate. She sees 3% GDP growth in 2018 and thinks the yield curve is a factor in the Fed&#39;s policy. She also noted US President Trump&#39;s commentary is not altering her vote decision making. Fed&#39;s Kaplan (Non-Voter, Dovish) said the job of the Fed is to make decisions independent of politics in response to the comments made by US President Trump on the Fed. He sees a modest impact of trade dispute on the US economy, but it could affect business sentiment. He went on to say the Fed expects to tail off as the impact of fiscal stimulus recedes and he expressed hope that the Fed can get to the neutral rate without seeing a yield curve inversion. Finally, he sees 3-4 hikes in the next 9-12 months. Fed&#39;s Bostic (Voter, Dove) said his outlook is for above trend expansion in the coming quarters and sees trade uncertainty as the chief downside risk. He also stated the FOMC has spent some time discussing the yield curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK Brexit Minister Raab sees risks and challenges in a no-deal scenario but also opportunities and reported to be making good progress on outstanding separation issue. He added the EU is still probing the UK proposals over the Irish border issues, though he will not allow anything to create a hard border in Ireland, even in a no-deal scenario. Nonetheless he appeared confident that a good Brexit deal is within sight, stressing that getting a good deal is by far the most likely outcome. UK Chancellor Hammond also commenting on a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; Brexit, said &#39;GDP impacts of this magnitude, were they to arise, would have large fiscal consequences&rsquo; for the UK. Finally, Austria&#39;s Chancellor Kurz says he wants to help EU&#39;s Barnier to avoid a hard Brexit</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB MINUTES: </strong>The minutes of the central bank&#39;s latest meeting provided few surprises. The central bank said that the threat of protectionism and prominent trade tensions could weigh on confidence in the Euro-area, but sounded upbeat on the economy, arguing that expectations remain that the H1 2018 slowdown was temporary, growth was broad-based and solid, and in-line with the June projections; on price pressures, it said that uncertainties around inflation were receding. Policymakers were unanimous in maintaining policy stance and were satisfied that the June decisions are well-understood by markets. Finally, it said that winding down of its asset purchases will be subject to incoming data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Weidmann (Hawkish) believes it is time to end expansionary monetary policy and emphasized ending QE is just the first step. He said normalization will be gradual and will take a few years, urging to avoid delays. He suggested a trade war could be &quot;severely detrimental&quot; to the global economy. On the German economy he said it is flourishing, with the upswing likely to continue, even though the expansionary pace is unlikely to be kept and sees uncertainty on the rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: &nbsp;</strong>In response to sanctions, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister said Russia will not halt exports of titanium to the US for its aviation industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;* NEW HOME SALES </strong>added to the recent disappointing housing data, falling 1.7% in July (expectations were for a 2.2% rise). This time the drop was attributed to the stormy weather which has impacted regions in the Northeast and South and depressed US sales over summer. In terms of trend, sales have now been falling for three times in the last four months and are clearly edging lower with weaker foreign demand cited as a possible motive, Wells Fargo said. However, Wells Fargo does not think demand all-together has weakened, since the median home price moved higher in July.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>5-Star Leader Di Maio said his party would be willing to suspend EU funding next year if on Friday the European Commission does not get a deal to divvy up migrants on a ship; Italian politicians have been calling for the Europe to share the responsibility for migrants entering the EU via Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>US equity futures grinded higher for the first half of the session and were further boosted at the US cash open. However, gains were short lived as gains were completely erased following Yuan weakness as well as some traders citing unconfirmed reports that Special Counsel Mueller plans to claim that Trump&nbsp;Jr&nbsp;lied to the FBI over the Trump Tower meeting (note, this is an unconfirmed rumour), while some also suggested weakness in BABA shares was a contributing factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>AMD (AMD) was higher after Rosenblatt raised the co.&rsquo;s price target to a street high of $30 from $27. Walmart (WMT) was slightly lower after a UK competition watchdog started its formal investigation into the planned $7.3bln merger between the co.&rsquo;s supermarket chain ASDA, and Sainsbury (SBRY LN). L Brands (LB) was under pressure on Thursday following poor earnings. LB slightly beat on both top &amp; bottom lines, however, the co. lowered FY18 and Q3 EPS forecasts. Synopsys (SNPS) outperformed after both EPS &amp; revenue were higher than expectations. Alibaba (BABA) was indecisive after its EPS beat but revenues fell, with the stock initially opening higher but giving up its gains as investors focused on the operating margin which fell 10% Q/Q and 35% y/y due to Ant Financial expenses, as well as the investment BABA is making in new areas. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES 3 CENTS LOWER AT $67.83/BBL; BRENT (V8) SETTLES 5 CENTS LOWER AT $74.73/BBL. </strong>Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s energy minister denied reports that the Aramco IPO has been cancelled, and said it remains committed to Aramco IPO, and is looking for the right market conditions for the IPO. Nigeria&rsquo;s crude exports to Asia tose to a 2-year high in July to 664k BPD, due to shrinking Brent/Dubai EFS, PVM reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10-YEAR T-NOTES SETTLED 1 TICK LOWER AT 120-19: </strong>The US Treasury sold $14bln of 5-year TIPS, which sold at the highest yield since 2009, stopping through by 0.1bps. In the week of 27 August, the US Treasury plans to issue $36bln of new 2-year notes on Monday, $37bln of new 5-year notes on Tuesday, and new $31bln of new 7-year notes on Wednesday, for total of $104bln. On Thursday, the curve was mixed, though once again, there were new cyclical flats for the 2s5s and 2s10s, as has become almost customary on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>Some much needed respite for the Rouble and a degree of positive contagion across the region after the CBR halted foreign currency purchases until the end of next month with the aim of curbing FX market volatility and declared it has enough in its locker to maintain financial stability. USD/RUB pulled back sharply from around 69.0000 to sub-67.5000 at best, with further impetus coming via reports suggesting that US President Trump may not have been aware of a meeting with Russian officials, according to his ex-lawyer Cohen. As noted, partial relief elsewhere, but the Real, Rand, Lira and Peso still suffering net losses vs a firmer Dollar overall post-FOMC minutes underscoring at least one more hike this year, in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>No such luck for the AUD that lost more ground vs the USD and NZD, through 0.7275 and towards 1.0900 respectively as ongoing political instability/uncertainty (after high profile Government resignations and more challenges to PM Turnbull) was exacerbated by Aussie-China tensions over 5G. AUD/USD bears now eyeing last Friday/week lows around 0.7250/0.7200, while the Kiwi is testing 0.6650 support/bids vs its US counterpart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, GBP, CAD: </strong>The next worst G10 performers vs the Greenback, as the DXY rebounded to 95.500+ again after another downturn, with USD/JPY clearing decent option expiries just ahead of 111.00 and the 55 DMA to take out some layered offers above the big figure on the way to 111.25. Meanwhile, Cable lost further ground from 1.2900+ to under 1.2850 and EUR/GBP retested 0.9000+ after little net reaction to a strong CBI retail survey and no deal guidelines from Brexit Minister Raab. The Loonie retreated from sub-1.3000 vs its US peer towards lows close to 1.3080 as NAFTA deal prospects before the end of the month at the earliest appear more realistic than this week or even sooner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, CHF: </strong>Relative outperformers, or rather more resilient vs the broad USD revival, as the single currency held above 1.1550 and Franc only extended its range to around 0.9855 from circa 0.9825 at the other end of Thursday&rsquo;s EU trading parameters.</p>\r\n",

Usd/Rub pulled back sharply from around 69.0000 to sub-67.5000 at best, with further impetus coming via reports suggesting that US President Trump may not have been aware of a meeting with Russian officials, according to his ex-lawyer Cohen. As noted, partial relief elsewhere, but the Real, Rand, Lira and Peso still suffering net losses vs a firmer Dollar overall post-FOMC minutes underscoring at least one more hike this year, in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No such luck for the Aud that lost more ground vs the USD and NZD, through 0.7275 and towards 1.0900 respectively as ongoing political instability/uncertainty (after high profile Government resignations and more challenges to PM Turnbull) was exacerbated by Aussie-China tensions over 5G. Aud/Usd bears now eyeing last Friday/week lows around 0.7250/0.7200, while the Kiwi is testing 0.6650 support/bids vs its US counterpart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next worst G10 performers vs the Greenback, as the DXY rebounded to 95.500+ again after another downturn, with Usd/Jpy clearing decent option expiries just ahead of 111.00 and the 55 DMA to take out some layered offers above the big figure on the way to 111.25. Meanwhile, Cable lost further ground from 1.2900+ to under 1.2850 and Eur/Gbp retested 0.9000+ after little net reaction to a strong CBI retail survey and no deal guidelines from Brexit Minister Raab. The Loonie retreated from sub-1.3000 vs its US peer towards lows close to 1.3080 as NAFTA deal prospects before the end of the month at the earliest appear more realistic than this week or even sooner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative outperformers, or rather more resilient vs the broad Usd revival, as the single currency held above 1.1550 and Franc only extended its range to around 0.9855 from circa 0.9825 at the other end of Thursday&rsquo;s EU trading parameters.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.3%) was negative as a mega-storm brewed on the political front with PM Turnbull&rsquo;s future in office highly doubtful after 3 cabinet members resigned including Finance Minister Cormann who advised the PM, no longer has party support, although losses in the index have been stemmed as participants reacted to a slew of earnings and with miners underpinned by recent strength in commodities. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) remained afloat on the back of a weaker JPY, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.5%) were jittery as the 2nd round of US tariffs on China took effect today and after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations again. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively unchanged with only minimal gains seen from the cautious risk tone in the region and with demand also subdued amid weaker results at the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US tariffs of 25% on additional USD 16bln of Chinese goods took effect. There were also comments from China Commerce Ministry that it resolutely opposes the latest US tariffs and will file a complaint to WTO, while Mofcom added it will continue to fight back against US.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8367 (Prev. 6.8271)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkish President Erdogan spokesman stated there is rule of law in Turkey and the case regarding Pastor Brunson is an ongoing legal issue, while the spokesman also stated Turkey has no intention of beginning an economic war but cannot stay silent. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Weidmann (Hawkish) says it is time to end expansionary monetary policy, and ending QE is just the first step, while he added normalization will be gradual, to take a &quot;few&quot; years, and must avoid delay. In regards to trade, he said trade war could be &quot;severely detrimental&quot; to global economy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Central Bank says has enough tools to prevent threats to financial stability and has decided not to purchase foreign currency from now until end of September. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump&rsquo;s former Lawyer Michael Cohen was said to have told lawmakers last year that he did not know whether US President Trump knew of the meeting with Russian officials in Trump Tower. (Axios)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Minister Raab says he is confident a good Brexit deal is within sight; getting a good deal is by far the most likely outcome, while adding there will be risks and challenges in no-deal scenario but also opportunities; making good progress on outstanding separation issue. (Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Chancellor Merkel has reportedly set her sights on backing a German head for the European Commission rather than backing Weidmann for head of the post-Draghi ECB. (Handelsblatt)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Markit Services Flash PMI (Aug) 54.4 vs. Exp. 54.4 (Prev. 54.2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Markit Manufacturing Flash PMI (Aug) 54.6 vs. Exp. 55.1 (Prev. 55.1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Markit Composite Flash PMI (Aug) 54.4 vs. Exp. 54.5 (Prev. 54.3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are largely mixed and trading without direction amidst the fresh US-China tariff action. The IT sector is mimicking the outperformance seen on Wall Street and is currently the leading sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryanair (+6.6%) is currently leading the gains in the Stoxx 600 (alongside Sunrise amid an upgrade in EBITDA guidance) as the co. reached an agreement with the Irish pilots union after 22 hours of deliberation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individual equity losses in Europe are driven by the general weakness in the EM scope, which is weighing on companies with exposure to the affected countries, such as Deutsche Bank (-2.3%) and Raiffeisen Bank (-3.05%), while Continental (-2.7%) fails to recover from yesterday&rsquo;s losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - FOMC minutes have given the flagging Usd a fillip, along with indirect props from rival currencies that are succumbing to more selling pressure due to specific/independent bearish factors. Thus, the index and Dollar overall have rebounded, with the former reclaiming 95.000+ status and almost up to 95.500 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - No respite for the Aud that is back on the rack after a fleeting rebound to around 0.7350 vs its US counterpart and sub-0.7300 on the latest political machinations down under. Indeed, the Aud is also extending losses relative to the NZD, with the cross down towards 1.0900 even though the Kiwi is back below 0.6700 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR/CAD - All falling foul of the latest Greenback revival, with Cable only just holding above 1.2850 and the single currency losing more ground after setting another recovery top above 1.1600, but respecting decent chart resistance between the big figure and 1.1650 again. Meanwhile, the Loonie has acknowledged less encouraging NAFTA vibes (in terms of likely deal timing not progress towards an agreement), like the Peso, with Usd/Cad bouncing ahead of its 100 DMA (1.2986) towards 1.3050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Relative outperformance vs the Usd above 111.00 and 0.9850 respectively as EM peers continue to wilt, while the former is also resisting some technical levels and befitting from supportive flows with 110.95 representing the 55 DMA and offers layered from 111.00 onwards. Note also, decent option expiry interest from 110.95-111.00 (1.3 bn) is capping the pair, and the same could be weighing on Eur/Usd given 1.1 bn rolling off at 1.1600, plus 2.3 bn at the 1.1625 strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The usual suspects are being flogged again, but with the Rub and Zar really seeing the brunt of investor angst on US sanctions &ndash; Rouble and Rand both around 1% or more weaker vs the Greenback, before the former got a reprieve from CBR&rsquo;s attempt to curb FX volatility while Axios reported comments from Cohen last year, that he did not know of the meeting with Russian Officials. Zar was initially pressured on US scrutiny of South Africa&rsquo;s farm and land seizures, which all contributed to the tailwinds overnight for the greenback, there were reports South Africa&#39;s Presidency will seek clarification from US Embassy on Trump&#39;s tweet regarding land reform policy. Elsewhere, Usd/Cnh firmer after reports of Chinese banks selling Yuan vs Dollars on a forward basis and an uptick in the Cny fix after some retracement of late from the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have recovered from another bout of selling and fresh session lows, at 162.95 and 123.25 (-5 and -7 ticks vs +23 and +16 ticks at one stage), but trade remains choppy amidst the start of position rolls and fluid headlines on Brexit, EM FX etc. Meanwhile, US Treasuries have pared overnight gains within tight ranges post-Fed minutes and ahead of a busy Thursday agenda ahead (claims, PMIs, new home sales etc).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are pressured amid the recent dollar strength after the FOMC minutes cemented rate hike expectations. WTI and Brent Oct&rsquo; 18 futures trade lower by 0.2% and 0.4% respectively after the US benchmark rose over 3% yesterday. News flow has been light for the complex thus far, however, it is worth noting the ongoing trade disputes may potentially dampen global demand. Meanwhile, sources initially reported the Saudi Aramco IPO listing has been halted, but Saudi Energy Minister later denied these reports. Elsewhere, precious and base metals also feel the effect of the aforementioned dollar strength with gold below USD 1190/oz.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The IT sector is mimicking the outperformance seen on Wall Street and is currently the leading sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryanair (+6.6%) is currently leading the gains in the Stoxx 600 (alongside Sunrise amid an upgrade in EBITDA guidance) as the co. reached an agreement with the Irish pilots union after 22 hours of deliberation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individual equity losses in Europe are driven by the general weakness in the EM scope, which is weighing on companies with exposure to the affected countries, such as Deutsche Bank (-2.3%) and Raiffeisen Bank (-3.05%), while Continental (-2.7%) fails to recover from yesterday&rsquo;s losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - FOMC minutes have given the flagging Usd a fillip, along with indirect props from rival currencies that are succumbing to more selling pressure due to specific/independent bearish factors. Thus, the index and Dollar overall have rebounded, with the former reclaiming 95.000+ status and almost up to 95.500 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - No respite for the Aud that is back on the rack after a fleeting rebound to around 0.7350 vs its US counterpart and sub-0.7300 on the latest political machinations down under. Indeed, the Aud is also extending losses relative to the NZD, with the cross down towards 1.0900 even though the Kiwi is back below 0.6700 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR/CAD - All falling foul of the latest Greenback revival, with Cable only just holding above 1.2850 and the single currency losing more ground after setting another recovery top above 1.1600, but respecting decent chart resistance between the big figure and 1.1650 again. Meanwhile, the Loonie has acknowledged less encouraging NAFTA vibes (in terms of likely deal timing not progress towards an agreement), like the Peso, with Usd/Cad bouncing ahead of its 100 DMA (1.2986) towards 1.3050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Relative outperformance vs the Usd above 111.00 and 0.9850 respectively as EM peers continue to wilt, while the former is also resisting some technical levels and befitting from supportive flows with 110.95 representing the 55 DMA and offers layered from 111.00 onwards. Note also, decent option expiry interest from 110.95-111.00 (1.3 bn) is capping the pair, and the same could be weighing on Eur/Usd given 1.1 bn rolling off at 1.1600, plus 2.3 bn at the 1.1625 strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The usual suspects are being flogged again, but with the Rub and Zar really seeing the brunt of investor angst on US sanctions &ndash; Rouble and Rand both around 1% or more weaker vs the Greenback. Elsewhere, Usd/Cnh firmer after reports of Chinese banks selling Yuan vs Dollars on a forward basis and an uptick in the Cny fix after some retracement of late from the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have recovered from another bout of selling and fresh session lows, at 162.95 and 123.25 (-5 and -7 ticks vs +23 and +16 ticks at one stage), but trade remains choppy amidst the start of position rolls and fluid headlines on Brexit, EM FX etc. Meanwhile, US Treasuries have pared overnight gains within tight ranges post-Fed minutes and ahead of a busy Thursday agenda ahead (claims, PMIs, new home sales etc).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are pressured amid the recent dollar strength after the FOMC minutes cemented rate hike expectations. WTI and Brent Oct&rsquo; 18 futures trade lower by 0.2% and 0.4% respectively after the US benchmark rose over 3% yesterday. News flow has been light for the complex thus far, however, it is worth noting the ongoing trade disputes may potentially dampen global demand. Meanwhile, sources initially reported the Saudi Aramco IPO listing has been halted, but Saudi Energy Minister later denied these reports. Elsewhere, precious and base metals also feel the effect of the aforementioned dollar strength with gold below USD 1190/oz.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Thus, the index and Dollar overall have rebounded, with the former reclaiming 95.000+ status and almost up to 95.500 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No respite for the Aud that is back on the rack after a fleeting rebound to around 0.7350 vs its US counterpart and sub-0.7300 on the latest political machinations down under. Indeed, the Aud is also extending losses relative to the NZD, with the cross down towards 1.0900 even though the Kiwi is back below 0.6700 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All falling foul of the latest Greenback revival, with Cable only just holding above 1.2850 and the single currency losing more ground after setting another recovery top above 1.1600, but respecting decent chart resistance between the big figure and 1.1650 again. Meanwhile, the Loonie has acknowledged less encouraging NAFTA vibes (in terms of likely deal timing not progress towards an agreement), like the Peso, with Usd/Cad bouncing ahead of its 100 DMA (1.2986) towards 1.3050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative outperformance vs the Usd above 111.00 and 0.9850 respectively as EM peers continue to wilt, while the former is also resisting some technical levels and befitting from supportive flows with 110.95 representing the 55 DMA and offers layered from 111.00 onwards. Note also, decent option expiry interest from 110.95-111.00 (1.3 bn) is capping the pair, and the same could be weighing on Eur/Usd given 1.1 bn rolling off at 1.1600, plus 2.3 bn at the 1.1625 strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The usual suspects are being flogged again, but with the Rub and Zar really seeing the brunt of investor angst on US sanctions &ndash; Rouble and Rand both around 1% or more weaker vs the Greenback. Elsewhere, Usd/Cnh firmer after reports of Chinese banks selling Yuan vs Dollars on a forward basis and an uptick in the Cny fix after some retracement of late from the PBoC.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>This week&rsquo;s ECB minutes release is set to offer very little in the way of fireworks given the lack of action at the July meeting. To recap last month&rsquo;s proceedings, the Bank reiterated their view that they expect key rates to remain at present levels at least through the Summer of 2019, and as long as necessary to ensure continued sustained convergence of inflation. During the accompanying press conference, Draghi gave little away and batted away any questions trying to get him to pin down an exact timeframe for the next rate move by the ECB. Furthermore, Draghi stated that uncertainties relating to the trade environment remain prominent, but the Euro area economy is solid and broad-based. Rhetoric from the Bank since the July meeting has been particularly light with central bankers opting to take a break from the minutiae of EZ monetary policy. As such, anyone looking for a trading opportunity out of this week&rsquo;s minutes release might be left disappointed with the account unlikely to offer any further insight into the Bank&rsquo;s plans for further monetary tightening.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.3%) was negative as a mega-storm brewed on the political front with PM Turnbull&rsquo;s future in office highly doubtful after 3 cabinet members resigned including Finance Minister Cormann who advised the PM, no longer has party support, although losses in the index have been stemmed as participants reacted to a slew of earnings and with miners underpinned by recent strength in commodities. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) remained afloat on the back of a weaker JPY, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.8%) were jittery as the 2nd round of US tariffs on China took effect today and after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations again. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively unchanged with only minimal gains seen from the cautious risk tone in the region and with demand also subdued amid weaker results at the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US tariffs of 25% on additional USD 16bln of Chinese goods took effect. There were also comments from China Commerce Ministry that it resolutely opposes the latest US tariffs and will file a complaint to WTO, while Mofcom added it will continue to fight back against US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 40bln. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8367 (Prev. 6.8271)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary Raab is reportedly to say that EU is being irresponsible regarding the Brexit but is to also state he remains confident a good deal is within horizon. (Newswires/Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK government reportedly plans to impose duties on imports from EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has written a letter with a point-by-point rebuttal of UK PM May&rsquo;s Chequers compromise, describing it as &ldquo;the wrong deal for Britain&rdquo;, the letter is being sent to Conservative Associations across the country. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Chancellor Merkel has reportedly set her sights on backing a German head for the European Commission rather than backing Weidmann for head of the post-Draghi ECB. (Handelsblatt)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY whipsawed and briefly fell below 95.00 in a knee-jerk reaction to the trade-wary FOMC minutes, but then recovered as the statements did little to change the outlook for the Fed&rsquo;s tightening path as many members viewed it would soon likely be appropriate to raise rates. AUD/USD was the worst performer amongst the major pairs and slipped below the 0.7300 handle amid the leadership crisis in Australia with parliament now suspended until September 10th, while Australian Treasurer Morrison and former Minister for Home Affairs Dutton were touted as leadership candidates to replace PM Turnbull who will not contend if a vote is called. This added fuel to the USD-comeback which coincided with EUR/USD retreating further away from 1.1600 and GBP/USD relinquishing the 1.2900 handle, while commodity-linked currencies also gave back yesterday&rsquo;s oil-driven gains. Elsewhere, the PBoC set a weaker fix and ZAR was pressured on US scrutiny of South Africa&rsquo;s farm and land seizures, which all contributed to the tailwinds overnight for the greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Australian Home Affairs Minister Dutton requested a 2nd party room meeting which was turned down by PM Turnbull, while Dutton also reportedly told Turnbull majority of the party doesn&#39;t support his leadership. Following this, 3 cabinet ministers submitted resignations including Finance Minister Cormann who advised the PM he does not have party support and that there should be a party room meeting to resolve leadership. Australian PM Turnbull later provided a press conference and stated he is waiting for the petition with signatures of majority of party and once received will call for party meeting, while he added will not stand if the party seeks a vote. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump stated he has asked Secretary of State Pompeo to closely examine the South Africa land and farm seizures, as well as expropriations and large scale killing of farmers. (Twitter)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed overnight with WTI crude futures flat as prices took a breather from yesterday&rsquo;s gains of over 3% which was fuelled by the larger than expected draws in the latest API and DoE inventory reports. Elsewhere, the metals complex declined with gold pressured by a resurgence of the greenback and with copper dragged lower by the predominantly risk-averse tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were initial reports that Saudi Arabia is said to have called-off Saudi Aramco IPO and has disbanded advisors according to sources. However, Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih later denied reports Aramco IPO will be called off. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkish President Erdogan spokesman stated there is rule of law in Turkey and the case regarding Pastor Brunson is an ongoing legal issue, while the spokesman also stated Turkey has no intention of beginning an economic war but cannot stay silent. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said now is a good time for a trade spat because of the booming economy and that it will take time to resolve the trade imbalances. Ross also stated there could be retaliation from China on tariffs and that there is some hope anytime there is interaction with China. Furthermore, Ross added there is no deal with Mexico yet, but one is within reach and they hope to get a deal done with Mexico soon. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico Incoming Trade Negotiator Seade said they still working on aspects of rules of origin and was doubtful when asked if there would be an announcement on NAFTA on Thursday but was said to be optimistic that they are coming to an end on NAFTA process. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland said she is very encouraged by the progress in NAFTA talks and is hearing optimism from the US &amp; Mexico, while she also hopes to rejoin talks once US &amp; Mexico issues have been resolved.

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac stock markets somewhat struggle for direction with the region cautious amid political turmoil in Australia and the looming 2nd round Trump tariffs on China. ASX 200 (-0.3%) is negative as a mega-storm brews on the political front with PM Turnbull&rsquo;s future in office highly doubtful after 3 cabinet resignations including Finance Minister Cormann who advised the PM he no longer has party support, although losses in the index have been stemmed as participants react to a slew of earnings and with miners underpinned by recent strength in commodities. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) remains afloat on the back of a weaker JPY, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (-0.7%) are jittery with the 2nd round of US tariffs on China set to take effect today and after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, AUD/USD is the worst performer amongst the major pairs and has slipped below the 0.7300 handle amid the leadership crisis in Australia with parliament now suspended until September 10th, while Australian Treasurer Morrison and former Minister for Home Affairs Dutton were touted as leadership candidates to replace PM Turnbull who is expected to not contend. This helped spur a USD-comeback to the detriment of its major counterparts in which EUR/USD slipped further away from 1.1600 and GBP/USD relinquished the 1.2900 handle, while commodity-linked currencies also gave back yesterday&rsquo;s oil-driven gains. Elsewhere, the PBoC set a weaker fix and ZAR was pressured on US scrutiny of South Africa&rsquo;s farm and land seizures, which all contributed to the tailwinds for the greenback which had earlier been pressured in knee-jerk reaction to the trade-wary FOMC minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid an indecisive risk tone in the region and with participants sidelined ahead of an enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds.</p>\r\n",
