(Newswires)<br />New Zealand REINZ March seasonally adjusted median house prices fell 2.2% M/M but rose 1.9% Y/Y.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Praet said ample degree of monetary policy remains necessary and that policy must be patient, persistent and prudent, while he also commented that the growth outlook confirms ECB&#39;s confidence. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX<a name=\"_Hlk503148913\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148890\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148850\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk507704203\">The broad USD has gradually lost ground vs all G10 rivals over the course of Monday&rsquo;s session, and the index has slipped back below 89.500 as a result. Tech support around 89.250 is therefore back in focus as more of the same between the US and China, could prompt another serious test of the nearest downside chart level. GBP and the EUR have been in a tug-of-war, but the latter is emerging as the winner with Cable looking set to test the 2018 high so far at 1.4345 (vs circa 1.4335 at best) and EURGBP under 0.8650, as pulls up just short of 1.2400 again despite surpassing a key Fib (1.2377) and effectively matching last week&rsquo;s peak (1.2395 on Wednesday and prior to dovish/cautious ECB minutes from the March meeting). The CHF has been another decent gainer vs the Usd as the headline pair retreats below 0.9600 and the Franc largely shrugs off mixed producer/import inflation data. CAD/AUD/NZD: Not much to choose between the commodity bloc in terms of rankings within the majors on the day, as the Loonie recaptures sub-1.2600 territory ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC meeting and Canadian CPI data on Friday, while AUDUS is poised to retest resistance ahead of 0.7800, like the 50 DMA around 0.7781. NZDUSD has regained 0.7350+ status ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s GDT auction and NZ Q1 CPI the day after, but is marginally lagging behind its antipodean neighbour as AUDNZD crosses back over 1.0550. JPY very rangebound vs the Greenback in the 107.20 area, with wider geopolitical factors basically offsetting more domestic political concerns, but the Jpy retaining an underlying safe-haven bid as US President Trump tweeted another warning to Russia and China about Rub and CNY devaluation.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alberta introduced legislation which would restrict provincial exports of energy products including crude oil, nat gas and refined fuels. There were also comments from Alberta Premier Notley that the measures are tied to opposition to expansion of Kinder Morgan Pipeline and could impact British Colombia gasoline prices, while she added that the rules will permit Alberta to prioritize pipeline shipments of crude oil over refined fuel shipments. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citigroup raised forecasts for average Brent crude prices by between USD 5.00-6.00 per barrel to USD 65.00/bbl for 2018 and to USD 55.00/bbl for 2019. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is said to halt plan for further Russian sanctions. (Washington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Dudley (Voter, Neutral) said that the Fed will remove accommodative policy in a year or two, while he added that he expects 3 or 4 gradual hikes this year and that any more is unlikely. Furthermore, he also noted 3% seems a reasonable estimate for the neutral rate. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Bostic (Voter, Dove) said he has not seen much movement in wages. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan (Non-Voter, Neutral) said he sees cyclical wage pressure building this year but added that he does not see inflation moving higher even though confident wage pressure will build up. Furthermore, Kaplan also stated he is very concerned that fiscal stimulus will turn into headwinds in 3-5 years. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Non-Voter, Dove) said recent steps by the federal government to stimulate economic growth have made him more confident the Fed will hit its 2% inflation objective soon, allowing the Fed to press ahead with planned interest-rate increases. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is to nominate PIMCO&rsquo;s economist Richard Clarida as Fed Vice Chair. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&#39;s Treasury holdings of US Treasury rose from USD 8.5bln to USD 1.18trln in Feb. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Retail Sales MM (Mar) 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. -0.1%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UBS cut US Q1 GDP tracker to 1.7% (Prev. 1.8%) and Goldman Sachs cut US Q1 GDP tracker to 1.90% (Prev. 2.0%) after retail sales data. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity futures gapped higher at the open and traded sideways for most of the session. Action tended to focus around the 2680 region in ES, with the index struggling to hold onto gains above that level for the most part, trading between that level and the VWAP 2670 &ndash; 2675. Strong earnings boosted JB Hunt, which led the NASDAQ, and Bank of America (BAC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and M&amp;T (MTB) were all gainers after beating earnings&rsquo; expectations. In the M&amp;A space, Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC) and ILG (ILG) were up more than 5%, after they announced to be in pole position to merge. Elsewhere, pharma names surged on news that Amazon (AMZN) has shelved its plan to sell and distribute pharmaceutical products after considering it last year, according to people familiar with the matter, (CAH, AET, RAD &amp; WBA shares spiked higher following this). Attention also fell on Merck&rsquo;s (MRK) Keytruda which showed signs of recurrence-free survival benefit across high risk stage 3 Melanoma, which also hampered Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) which closed among the lowest in the SPX. On the flip side, General Electric (GE) was dragged into negative territory after it announced a USD 4.24bln equity charge and reported reduced earnings for the last two years by USD 0.30/shr, In line with earlier announced expectations as it adjusted the figures to new accounting standards. SPX +0.8% at 2678, NDX +0.7% at 6675, DJI +0.9% at 24573.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were sold as European traders got to their desks on Monday morning, as some of the geopolitical risk eased. However, Treasuries did find buyers over the course of the session, particularly after a mixed retail sales report, as well as the latest business inventories and NAHB data, but the buying wasn&rsquo;t enough to prevent the complex from settling slightly lower. The shape of the curve saw some modest flattening on Monday. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle half-a-tick lower at 120-15.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Stocks up, Treasuries flat, DXY down, crude down<br />* REAR-VIEW: Fed&rsquo;s Bostic does not see much move in wage pressure, mixed US data, Fed&rsquo;s and ECB&rsquo;s speak<br />* AHEAD: RBA Minutes, China GDP, heavy Fed&rsquo;s speak calendar </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:&nbsp;</strong>Geopolitical risk abated on Monday, with Western forces intimating that the strike on Syria was a one-off as a result of chemical weapons use. Sentiment was helped late in the session after it was reported that US President Trump had halted a plan to impose further sanctions on Russia. Earlier on Monday, the EU also called on Iran and Russia to aid in preventing further use of chemical weapons. In the UK, PM May&rsquo;s speech to Parliament Monday was mainly uneventful. A US envoy also noted there were concerns that Russia &ldquo;may have tampered&rdquo; with Douma attack site in Syria and called for OPCW members to condemn Syria for their &quot;reign of chemical terror&quot;. Separately, Russia&#39;s deputy foreign minister said Moscow along with its G20 and BRIC partners are discussing the US&#39;s abuses of the USD as a main reserve currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS:</strong> Markets remain on alert, awaiting for the US to announce the USD 100bln of Chinese products subject to additional tariffs. The European Union announced it was seeking talks with the US at the WTO, over compensation for US steel and aluminium tariffs, according to a filing, whilst news flow remained silent on the NAFTA front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FEDSPEAK:</strong>&nbsp;US President Trump said to nominate PIMCO&rsquo;s economist Richard&nbsp;<strong>Clarida</strong>&nbsp;as Fed Vice Chair; when he spoke in January, Clarida endorsed three 2018 hikes.<strong>&nbsp;Fed&rsquo;s Dudley</strong>&nbsp;(Voter, Neutral) claimed the Fed will remove accommodative policy in a year or two and that uncertainties and risks around trade remain as trade barriers would be bad for the economy.&nbsp;<strong>Fed&rsquo;s Bostic</strong>&nbsp;(voter) reveleaed little by way of new information, though said he saw little movement in wages.&nbsp;<strong>Fed&#39;s Kashkari</strong>&nbsp;(dove, non-voter) is slowly adjusting his tone, noting on Monday once again that recent steps by the government to stimulate economic growth have made him more confident the Fed will hit its 2% inflation objective soon, allowing the Fed to press ahead with planned interest-rate increases.&nbsp;<strong>Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan</strong>&nbsp;(non-voter, neutral) appeared confident the cyclical wage pressure will build up this year,&nbsp;he is concerned the fiscal stimulus will turn into headwind in 3-5 years and thus he still sees 3 rate hikes this year. He also mentioned that the 10yr yield at 2.85% places a limit on how high the Fed can lift rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*ECB SPEAK:</strong> ECB&rsquo;s Praet (dove, chief economist) believes ample degree of monetary policy remains necessary, he added policy must be patient, persistent and prudent and the growth outlook confirms ECB&#39;s confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>US DATA:</strong>&nbsp;US&nbsp;<strong>retail sales</strong>&nbsp;rebounded in March, ending a run of three consecutive monthly declines. Gains were driven by driven by autos. The control group - which is used in GDP calculations &ndash; also put in a firm showing. &ldquo;Although we still expect a relatively weak consumer during the first quarter of the year, the better-than-expected retail sales report today plus the relatively strong control group sales number will keep first quarter consumption from being a complete disappointment after such a strong quarter at the end of last year,&rdquo; Wells Fargo said.&nbsp;<strong>Business inventories</strong>&nbsp;were up 0.6% MM in February, and analysts noted that the stock piling was likely to add to GDP growth in Q1; Barclays subsequently raised its tracker by 0.1ppts to 1.6%, though the Atlanta Fed GDPnow tracker slipped by the same margin to 1.9% in Q1. The&nbsp;<strong>NAHB&rsquo;s</strong>&nbsp;April survey fell by 1 point to 69 (analysts were expecting a 1 point rise to 71), marking the fourth consecutive month of declines. &ldquo;The trend in mortgage applications now seems to be weakening - though the seasonals are so tricky at this time of year that we can&#39;t be sure - so we see further downside for the NAHB over the next few months. Housing has not led this economic cycle; it&#39;s not about to start now,&rdquo; Pantheon Macroeconomics said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES:</strong> <strong>SPX +0.8% at 2678, NDX +0.7% at 6675, DJI +0.9% at 24573 // SECTORS: CONS CYC (XLY): +0.75%, CONS NON-CYC (XLP): +1.01%, ENERGY (XLE): +1.01%, FINANCIALS (XLF): +0.47%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +0.8%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): +1.00%, MATERIALS (XLB): +1.38%, TECH (XLK): +0.7%, TELECOMS (XTL): +1.49%, UTLITIES (XLU): +1.38%.</strong> Equity futures gapped higher at the open and traded sideways for most of the session. Action tended to focus around the 2680 region in ES, with the index struggling to hold onto gains above that level for the most part, trading between that level and the VWAP 2670 &ndash; 2675. Strong earnings boosted JB Hunt, which led the NASDAQ, and Bank of America (BAC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and M&amp;T (MTB) were all gainers after beating earnings&rsquo; expectations. In the M&amp;A space, Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC) and ILG (ILG) were up more than 5%, after they announced to be in pole position to merge. Elsewhere, pharma names surged on news that Amazon (AMZN) has shelved its plan to sell and distribute pharmaceutical products after considering it last year, according to people familiar with the matter, (CAH, AET, RAD &amp; WBA shares spiked higher following this). Attention also fell on Merck&rsquo;s (MRK) Keytruda which showed signs of recurrence-free survival benefit across high risk stage 3 Melanoma, which also hampered Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) which closed among the lowest in the SPX. On the flip side, General Electric (GE) was dragged into negative territory after it announced a USD 4.24bln equity charge and reported reduced earnings for the last two years by USD 0.30/shr, In line with earlier announced expectations as it adjusted the figures to new accounting standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;* TREASURIES:</strong> US 10yr T-Notes futures settle half-a-tick lower at 120-15. Treasuries were sold as European traders got to their desks on Monday morning, as some of the geopolitical risk eased. However, Treasuries did find buyers over the course of the session, particularly after a mixed retail sales report, as well as the latest business inventories and NAHB data, but the buying wasn&rsquo;t enough to prevent the complex from settling slightly lower. The shape of the curve saw some modest flattening on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* </strong><strong>CRUDE:</strong> Some of the geopolitical risk premium baked into crude prices has unwound after Syria strikes are seen as a one-off in specific response to chemical weapons use. However, some geopolitical risk is still contained within the one-month view (US will decide in mid-May whether to re-apply sanctions on Iran, or back the nuclear deal) keeping some bid in crude. Crude action was generally horizontal following the selling overnight. In crude specific news, the Kuwaiti oil minister said OPEC-led&nbsp; cuts will continue through the end of 2018, as planned, Oman&rsquo;s oil minister urged producers to continue cooperation. State-side, the EIA said US total shale oil production for May is seen higher by 125,000BPD at 6.996mln BPD (April saw a 118,000 BPD rise). Analysts estimate that headline crude stocks will draw by 1.9mln barrels this week, Cushing stocks are seen drawing by 1.2mln in the week, according to Genscape; for products, the Street expects to see distillates draw by 0.5mln barrels and gasoline is seen drawing by 1mln in the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> &nbsp;The broad USD has gradually lost ground vs all G10 rivals over the course of Monday&rsquo;s session, and the index has slipped back below 89.500 as a result. Tech support around 89.250 is therefore back in focus as more of the same between the US and China, could prompt another serious test of the nearest downside chart level. GBP and the EUR have been in a tug-of-war, but the latter is emerging as the winner with Cable looking set to test the 2018 high so far at 1.4345 (vs circa 1.4335 at best) and EURGBP under 0.8650, as pulls up just short of 1.2400 again despite surpassing a key Fib (1.2377) and effectively matching last week&rsquo;s peak (1.2395 on Wednesday and prior to dovish/cautious ECB minutes from the March meeting). The CHF has been another decent gainer vs the Usd as the headline pair retreats below 0.9600 and the Franc largely shrugs off mixed producer/import inflation data. CAD/AUD/NZD: Not much to choose between the commodity bloc in terms of rankings within the majors on the day, as the Loonie recaptures sub-1.2600 territory ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC meeting and Canadian CPI data on Friday, while AUDUS is poised to retest resistance ahead of 0.7800, like the 50 DMA around 0.7781. NZDUSD &nbsp;has regained 0.7350+ status ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s GDT auction and NZ Q1 CPI the day after, but is marginally lagging behind its antipodean neighbour as AUDNZD crosses back over 1.0550. JPY very rangebound vs the Greenback in the 107.20 area, with wider geopolitical factors basically offsetting more domestic political concerns, but the Jpy retaining an underlying safe-haven bid as US President Trump tweeted another warning to Russia and China about Rub and CNY devaluation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Crude action was generally horizontal following the selling overnight. In crude specific news, the Kuwaiti oil minister said OPEC-led &nbsp;cuts will continue through the end of 2018, as planned, Oman&rsquo;s oil minister urged producers to continue cooperation. State-side, the EIA said US total shale oil production for May is seen higher by 125,000BPD at 6.996mln BPD (April saw a 118,000 BPD rise). Analysts estimate that headline crude stocks will draw by 1.9mln barrels this week, Cushing stocks are seen drawing by 1.2mln in the week, according to Genscape; for products, the Street expects to see distillates draw by 0.5mln barrels and gasoline is seen drawing by 1mln in the week.</p>\r\n",

Nzd/Usd has regained 0.7350+ status ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s GDT auction and NZ Q1 CPI the day after, but is marginally lagging behind its antipodean neighbour as Aud/Nzd crosses back over 1.0550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very rangebound vs the Greenback in the 107.20 area, with wider geopolitical factors basically offsetting more domestic political concerns, but the Jpy retaining an underlying safe-haven bid as US President Trump tweeted another warning to Russia and China about Rub and Cny devaluation.</p>\r\n",

The anticipated US-led response on Syria finally took place on Saturday, which was seen as somewhat of a slap on the wrist as they decided to hit only 3 targets and with the wave of strike action already declared to be over. As such, US equity futures gapped higher at the open, while <strong>ASX 200 (+0.2%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.3%)</strong> were also in the green as fears of an escalation subsided. Conversely, <strong>Shanghai Comp.

This saw an increase in money market rates in Hong Kong, while underperformance was led by Rusal shares which tumbled over 20% after US announced to impose further Russian sanctions. Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid a subdued tone in USTs and indecisive risk sentiment in the region, while the absence of a BoJ Rinban announcement also ensured quiet trade.

The anticipated US-led response on Syria finally took place on Saturday, which was seen as somewhat of a slap on the wrist as they decided to hit only 3 targets and with the wave of strike action already declared to be over. In terms of sectors, energy is taking a hit from the falling oil prices whilst healthcare names are outperforming with Shire (+0.9%) higher on the day amid reports Takeda Pharmaceutical heads are to meet with US investors ahead of the GBP 35bln bid for the UK-listed pharma name. Furthermore, Shire is to sell their oncology business to unlisted French drugmaker Servier for USD 2.4bln. Whitbread (+6.7%) is dominating the FTSE 100 after reports Elliott Advisors is pressuring the company to spin-off Costa in an effort to generate as much as GBP 3bln of additional value.

Moreover, the &lsquo;reaction&rsquo; to Saturday&rsquo;s US-led strikes against Syria has been relatively tame overall, with the targeted military action appeasing fears over more aggression and potential retaliation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/GBP </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outperformers, as Eur/Usd firms above the 1.2300 handle, 10 DMA at 1.2310 and 55 DMA at 1.2327, but falls just short of a key Fib at 1.2377 having failed to seriously test 1.2400 on several occasions of late. Cable remains underpinned and just posted a session high above 1.4300 (best since the YTD high of 1.4345), and perhaps buoyed by a Eur/Gbp sell recommendation from a big US bank eying 0.8475 vs a circa 0.8645 low/0.8670 high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/CHF/NZD/CAD/AUD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All essentially flat vs the Usd, around 107.20, 0.9600, 0.7355 and 1.2600 respectively and awaiting further impetus. Dovish BoJ commentary has weighed on the Jpy, and similarly soft Swiss producer prices for the Franc, while the Loonie is looking for independent direction from the BoC on Wednesday and Canadian CPI on Friday. Aud/Usd is holding towards the upper end of a 0.7785-50 band, but also capped ahead of the nearest big figure after topping out just above last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD/RUB</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rouble is under pressure again amidst 62.0000-63.1500 parameters vs the Dollar ahead of latest reciprocal sanctions from the US and Russia, as the latter pledges to respond forcefully, and also warning that further strikes vs Syria will not be tolerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bit of respite for Bunds, <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>US Treasuries</strong>, but it&rsquo;s an uneasy calm as relief over the strategic nature of strikes against Syria is tinged with a degree of anticipation given still very strained relations between the West and Russian/Iran &ndash; more sanctions in the pipeline.

The unwind in risk comes following the Syrian strikes on Saturday which were not as wide-reaching as some had feared. This risk-on attitude is tempered, however, as markets await further action surrounding Russian sanctions and retaliatory effects. In terms of energy specific newsflow, OPEC members continue to advocate further cooperation and reiterate that the current supply cuts are to continue to the end of the year. In the metals scope, news arising gold trades slightly softer on an improved risk appetite, and copper is uneventful following Chinese underperformance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kuwait Oil Minister says June meeting will be a chance to review agreement, but the deal will continue until the end of 2018.

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: Uncertainty lingers as Syria stays in focus",
        "content": "<p><strong>Equities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European bourses opened mixed (Eurostoxx 50 flat) this morning, following suit from the Asia-Pac session as investors remain wary of potential escalating tensions regarding Syria. The anticipated US-led response on Syria finally took place on Saturday, which was seen as somewhat of a slap on the wrist as they decided to hit only 3 targets and with the wave of strike action already declared to be over. In terms of sectors, energy is taking a hit from the falling oil prices whilst healthcare names are outperforming with Shire (+1.6%) higher on the day amid reports Takeda Pharmaceutical heads are to meet with US investors ahead of the GBP 35bln bid for the UK-listed pharma name. Furthermore, Shire is to sell their oncology business to unlisted French drugmaker Servier for USD 2.4bln. Whitbread (+6.5%) is dominating the FTSE 100 after reports Elliott Advisors is pressuring the company to spin-off Costa in an effort to generate as much as GBP 3bln of additional value. Elsewhere, WPP (-1.4%) initially opened as low as 4% following the departure of CEO Martin Sorrell after an allegation of personal misconduct, with concerns arising over the future course of action for the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar index has faded after brief attempt higher within a 89.850-600 range, and the Greenback is now softer for choice vs all G10 counterparts, albeit modestly. Moreover, the &lsquo;reaction&rsquo; to Saturday&rsquo;s US-led strikes against Syria has been relatively tame overall, with the targeted military action appeasing fears over more aggression and potential retaliation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/AUD/GBP&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marginal outperformers, as Eur/Usd firms above the 1.2300 handle and 10 DMA at 1.2310, but falls just short of a key Fib at 1.2377 having failed to seriously test 1.2400 on several occasions of late. Aud/Usd is holding towards the upper end of a 0.7785-50 band, but also capped ahead of the nearest big figure after topping out just above last week. Cable remains underpinned between 1.4225-70, and perhaps buoyed by a Eur/Gbp sell recommendation from a big US bank eying 0.8475 vs a circa 0.8645 low/0.8670 high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All essentially flat vs the Usd, around 107.20, 0.9600, 0.7355 and 1.2600 respectively and awaiting further impetus. Dovish BoJ commentary has weighed on the Jpy, and similarly soft Swiss producer prices for the Franc, while the Loonie is looking for independent direction from the BoC on Wednesday and Canadian CPI on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/RUB</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rouble is under pressure again amidst 62.0000-63.1500 parameters vs the Dollar ahead of latest reciprocal sanctions from the US and Russia, as the latter pledges to respond forcefully, and also warning that further strikes vs Syria will not be tolerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fixed Income</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some corrective or catch-up selling straight off the Liffe re-start for Gilts, which have traded between 121.92-64 vs the 122.05 previous settlement price. The 10 year benchmark is tracking fixed counterparts lower in what looks like a technical downturn prompted by no major risk-aversion or fall-out from the strikes against Syria over the weekend. Note, Bunds have now not only breached 159.00, but also last week&rsquo;s 158.89 low amidst stops to hit 158.74 for a decline of 60 ticks on the day, and bears/shorts will now be targeting the 158.59-55 area, while nearest chart support for Gilts comes in at 121.44 (late March low). The Short Sterling strip is 1-2 ticks below par and holding in relatively better amidst broad curve re-steepening and with some downbeat/dovish impulses via soft UK house price data and weak spending (Rightmove and VISA surveys respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Commodities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures trade lower amid an unwind of the geopolitical premium and another uptick in the Baker Hughes rig count on Friday. The unwind in risk comes following the Syrian strikes&nbsp;on Saturday&nbsp;which were not as wide-reaching as some had feared. This risk-on attitude is tempered, however, as markets await further action surrounding Russian sanctions and retaliatory effects. In terms of energy specific newsflow,&nbsp;OPEC members continue to advocate further cooperation and reiterate that the current supply cuts are to continue to the end of the year.&nbsp;In the metals scope, news arising gold trades slightly softer on an improved risk appetite, and copper is uneventful following Chinese underperformance.</p>\r\n",

Treasuries were generally fulfilling their haven role, inversely moving to the direction of equities &ndash; particularly so after weak US data.

The anticipated US-led response on Syria finally took place on Saturday, which was seen as somewhat of a slap on the wrist as they decided to hit only 3 targets and with the wave of strike action already declared to be over. As such, US equity futures gapped higher at the open, while ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) were also in the green as fears of an escalation subsided. Conversely, Shanghai Comp. (-1.5%) and Hang Seng (-1.6%) were negative following the miss on Chinese lending data last week and with tomorrow&rsquo;s Chinese GDP adding to the risk factors, while the PBoC also announced to raise the 14-day reverse repo rate by 5bps which was inline with the hikes seen in money market rates in reaction to the March Fed hike. This saw an increase in money market rates in Hong Kong, while underperformance was led by Rusal shares which tumbled over 20% after US announced to impose further Russian sanctions. Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid a subdued tone in USTs and indecisive risk sentiment in the region, while the absence of a BoJ Rinban announcement also ensured quiet trade. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful and traded little changed amid the mixed risk tone and as a lack of BoJ Rinban announcement also ensured quiet trade.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade with a mixed tone as focus centres on air strikes on Syria over the weekend and Chinese data. The anticipated US-led response on Syria finally took place on Saturday, which was seen as somewhat of a slap on the wrist as they decided to hit only 3 targets and with the wave of strike action already declared to be over. As such, US equity futures gapped higher at the open, while ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) are also in the green as fears of an escalation subsided. Conversely, Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%) and Hang Seng (-1.4%) are negative following the miss on Chinese lending data last week and with tomorrow&rsquo;s Chinese GDP adding to the risk factors, while the PBoC also announced to raise the 14-day reverse repo rate by 5bps which was inline with the hikes seen in money market rates in reaction to the March Fed hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the major pairs are relatively quiet and begin the week range-bound amid a lack of key data releases. Nonetheless, the greenback is slightly softer which marginally benefits both EUR/USD and GBP/USD, while USD/JPY is indecisive as it mirrors the overall risk tone. Elsewhere, HKD continues to test the 7.8500 bottom-end of the trading band and with it the resoluteness of the HKMA to intervene, while RUB underperforms and has weakened over 1.5% against the greenback after the US stated that more Russian sanctions were to be announced today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid a subdued tone in USTs and indecisive risk sentiment in the region, while the absence of a BoJ Rinban announcement also ensured quiet trade.</p>\r\n",
