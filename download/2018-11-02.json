Trump also announced he will have dinner with Xi at the G20 summit as well as mentioning that if the US can open up China and make it fair, he is willing to do it. White House Economic advisor Kudlow announced that more tariffs on China are possible, adding that Trump has not asked the cabinet to make a China trade plan and confirming he hasn&#39;t seen any new proposals from China. He said he is not as optimistic as before that a trade deal will be reached, noting that if talks improve then tariffs could be removed. Later on, he said he wants to keep expectations low on US - China talks and doesn&#39;t expect a detailed trade deal from Trump and Xi talks. Elsewhere, according to senior administration officials, there is no indication of an imminent trade deal with China as options are always being discussed behind the scenes, but with no significant progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>On the US ECONOMY</strong>, Kudlow said the US economy is in a non-inflationary boom and sees no inflation in the big picture. He added the budget deficits go down whilst spending cuts could accompany tax cuts; tax cut for middle class in on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIST HASSETT</strong> said he will not comment if a China trade draft is being prepared. In reference to Trump&#39;s recent criticism of the Fed, said they respect the Fed&#39;s independence and wouldn&#39;t be surprised by wage growth above 3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May&#39;s spokeswoman stated that the UK has submitted its proposals on the Northern Ireland issue and announced that negotiations continue, while a UK cabinet minister said that the British government is committed to getting over remaining difficulties soon, noting there has been positive progress in the last few weeks. UK Brexit Minister Raab also stated to have made it &quot;very clear&quot; they will not allow anything that jeopardizes the UK&#39;s integrity. In related news, Irish Foreign Minister Coveney believes it is possible to get a deal in November as they are very close, but not quite there yet. He was also optimistic on the progress made in the recent weeks as EU&rsquo;s Barnier has shown flexibility, he however stressed that Dublin and the EU can&#39;t be flexible on having an &quot;all weather&quot; Irish backstop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Deputy PM Di Maio announced the government will approve decree on citizen&#39;s wage and pension reform during the Christmas period. In separate news, ten EU finance ministers warned Italy on the budget in a letter as reported by the Dutch press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Praet stated the issue of non-performing loans must be addressed. ECB&#39;s Rehn (Non-voter, Dovish) said that monetary support is still required, normalisation will be data dependent. He noted 1.6%-1.8% inflation is &quot;to my mind&quot; not yet below but close to 2%, should adopt a more symmetric assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US LABOUR MARKET </strong>showed non-farm payrolls bouncing in October to 250k from 134k, well above the 190k consensus, following hurricane-related weakness seen in September. Even though the unemployment held steady at 3.7%, other measures suggested the labour market continues to tighten; the U-6 unemployment rate fell to the lowest level in this cycle posting at 7.4%. Also, average hourly earnings rose by 0.2% pushing the yy headline to 3.2% the highest wage inflation rate for this cycle. The latest labour report therefore reinforces expectations for the Fed to hike rates at its December meeting. Looking ahead, analysts at Wells Fargo expect &ldquo;employment growth to remain generally strong, which should cause the unemployment rate to recede even further. Consequently, we look for the Fed to continue raising rates at a gradual pace into next year&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADIAN LABOUR REPORT </strong>was solid and maintained momentum after the strong reading in September; unemployment fell to 5.8% from 5.9%. The details were mixed as full-time unemployment change rose to 33.9k, a big jump from the previous -16.9k, whilst part-time jobs gave up previous gains posting at &ndash;22.6k. The overall employment change posted at 11.2k above the expected 10k. However, the participation rate fell slightly to 65.2% from 6.4%; the major downside was seen in wage growth which rose 1.9% below the previous pace of 2.2%. On wages, Scotiabank notes &ldquo;this is not the wage figure that the BoC emphasizes as it only gets a trivial weight within the BoC&rsquo;s preferred wage common metric&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.65% at 2723, NDX -1.47% at 6965, DJI -0.44% at 25268. SECTORS:</strong> Energy -0.11%, Materials -0.34%, Industrials -0.27%, Cons Discretionary +0.41%, Cons Staples -0.28%, Healthcare -0.67%, Financials -0.04%, Tech -1.89%, Telecoms -0.81%, Utilities -0.52%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS </strong>Some heavyweight earnings today from stocks including Apple (AAPL) which tumbled, losing its USD 1trln status, after it lowered expectations for sales in the next quarter. Other earnings reports came from energy names Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) which both beat EPS estimates pushing them higher, Starbucks (SBUX) surged following strong sales in the US and China, and Kraft Heinz (KHZ) failed as a condiment to these gains after it traded lower on missing its EPS estimates. VeriSign (VRSN) was a top mover following regulatory approval for it to increase its prices. Synchrony Financial (SYF) took a dive after Walmart (WMT) announced it is suing it for breaching terms of their contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) settles USD 0.55 lower at USD 63.14/bbl, Brent (F9) settles USD 0.06 lower at USD 72.83/bbl.</strong> Friday&rsquo;s focus fell on Iranian sanctions which are set to be imposed by the US on Sunday the 4th at 23:59 EDT. Oil prices drifted lower after the US announced it will issue eight exemptions to countries importing Iranian oil, with the exception of the EU, with the aim to keep oil prices stable as reported by US Secretary of State Pompeo in a conference call, adding he expects Iranian oil imports to drop by 1mln barrels. The US will expect the countries that receive the waiver to keep reducing Iran oil imports in the months ahead. In response, Iranian deputy oil ministers stated that issuing waivers highlights how the US cannot remove Iran&#39;s oil from the market. Baker Hughes oil rig count were down 1 at 874, gas rigs were unchanged at 193 and total rigs also down 1 at 1067.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 17 TICKS LOWER AT &nbsp;118-01+.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP - DXY: </strong>A real white-knuckle ride for the Usd and index, with a rally into and just over the hump of the week that coincided with month end (and Halloween) and multiple bullish factors, including strong Greenback buy signals for portfolio rebalancing, tax repatriation requirements and SOMA repayments. Hence, the broad Dollar and DXY outperformed, as the latter hit fresh 2018 peaks of 97.201 before suffering a heavy end of October-fest hangover and snapping back just below 96.000 to post a new low for the week and trade under &lsquo;opening&rsquo; levels (96.425). The catalyst for the sharp U-turn, aside from the unwinding of October 31 flows, signs of a breakthrough in the US-China trade impasse following constructive talks between Presidents Trump and Xi. Moreover, the former is said to have instructed White House officials to work on a draft deal, though subsequent reports suggest this might be premature. Nevertheless, the rot has stopped for the Buck to a degree, as the index reclaims 96.000+ status on the back of an upbeat US jobs report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, EUR, NZD, AUD: </strong>All ending Friday&rsquo;s EU session, and in some cases the week overall with gains vs the Usd, but off best levels given the aforementioned post-NFP Dollar bounce, as the Franc hovers around parity within a 1.0090-0.9960 range and largely shrugged off soft Swiss CPI and manufacturing PMI prints in favour of slightly hawkish or less dovish SNB comments (noting that policy cannot remain accommodative indefinitely). Meanwhile, the single currency survived a severe test of its ytd lows, several disappointing Eurozone manufacturing PMIs and more Italian-EU budget toing and froing to rebound firmly from circa 1.1300 to just over 1.1450 at best, but has not maintained recovery gains over a key Fib (1.1420-25). Elsewhere, the Antipodean Dollars have perhaps mirrored their US counterpart&rsquo;s relatively abrupt change of fortunes better than other majors, with the Aud also tracking Yuan moves and deriving some independent props via data (like Aussie trade and PPI). Hence, Aud/Usd remains closer to the top of a 0.7250+ to 0.7040 band, and likewise the Kiwi is hovering nearer 0.6689 than 0.6500, as the Aud/Nzd cross remains capped below 1.0850.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, CAD, JPY: </strong>Cable has lost grip of the 1.3000 handle yet again, but is still on track to close out the week well ahead of its approx. 1.2825 start point and even further above the 1.2695 low. Aside from the Dollar&rsquo;s rise and fall from grace, Brexit developments on balance appear to be Pound-supportive even if press reports about deals with the EU on securing access for UK financial services firms seem to have been premature and a supposed compromise offer from the EU on the Irish border has yet to be confirmed or confounded. Meanwhile, UK manufacturing and construction PMIs were mixed and BoE super Thursday more upbeat/hawkish overall, but heavily contingent on Brexit, as usual. The Loonie is back near mid-range levels between 1.3170-1.3045 with weak crude prices an intermittent if not constant weight, but Canadian employment data not as encouraging as the US version (headline payrolls just above forecast and largely due to full time jobs, but average earnings soft). The Jpy has mainly been a victim or beneficiary of swings in risk sentiment, with no real additional impetus from an unchanged BoJ, and the headline pair is up around the top of 111.75-113.40 parameters as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Some big moves in regional currencies and decent upside vs the Usd, in line with the general trend and improvement in risk appetite, but also due to some technical and specific factors. The Cny and Cnh have both traded above 6.9000 vs 6.9700+ at one stage on the thawing in US-China tariff angst, while the Try has rebounded through 14.5000 for similar reasons, as the US and Turkey both reciprocate on the removal of sanctions. Technical impulses also helping the Zar on a clean break of 14.5000 resistance, with the Mxn also back above a psychological level (20.0000) and paring some airport-related losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong> Monday - Data: Chinese Caixin, UK Services PMI, US Non-Manufacturing PMI.

Oil prices drifted lower after the US announced it will issue eight exemptions to countries importing Iranian oil, with the exception of the EU, with the aim to keep oil prices stable as reported by US Secretary of State Pompeo in a conference call, adding he expects Iranian oil imports to drop by 1mln barrels. The US will expect the countries that receive the waiver to keep reducing Iran oil imports in the months ahead. In response, Iranian deputy oil ministers stated that issuing waivers highlights how the US cannot remove Iran&#39;s oil from the market. Baker Hughes oil rig count were down 1 at 874, gas rigs were unchanged at 193 and total rigs also down 1 at 1067.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Dollar ends tricky week with welcome NFP treat",
        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A real white-knuckle ride for the Usd and index, with a rally into and just over the hump of the week that coincided with month end (and Halloween) and multiple bullish factors, including strong Greenback buy signals for portfolio rebalancing, tax repatriation requirements and SOMA repayments. Hence, the broad Dollar and DXY outperformed, as the latter hit fresh 2018 peaks of 97.201 before suffering a heavy end of October-fest hangover and snapping back just below 96.000 to post a new low for the week and trade under &lsquo;opening&rsquo; levels (96.425). The catalyst for the sharp U-turn, aside from the unwinding of October 31 flows, signs of a breakthrough in the US-China trade impasse following constructive talks between Presidents Trump and Xi. Moreover, the former is said to have instructed White House officials to work on a draft deal, though subsequent reports suggest this might be premature. Nevertheless, the rot has stopped for the Buck to a degree, as the index reclaims 96.000+ status on the back of an upbeat US jobs report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All ending Friday&rsquo;s EU session, and in some cases the week overall with gains vs the Usd, but off best levels given the aforementioned post-NFP Dollar bounce, as the Franc hovers around parity within a 1.0090-0.9960 range and largely shrugged off soft Swiss CPI and manufacturing PMI prints in favour of slightly hawkish or less dovish SNB comments (noting that policy cannot remain accommodative indefinitely). Meanwhile, the single currency survived a severe test of its ytd lows, several disappointing Eurozone manufacturing PMIs and more Italian-EU budget toing and froing to rebound firmly from circa 1.1300 to just over 1.1450 at best, but has not maintained recovery gains over a key Fib (1.1420-25). Elsewhere, the Antipodean Dollars have perhaps mirrored their US counterpart&rsquo;s relatively abrupt change of fortunes better than other majors, with the Aud also tracking Yuan moves and deriving some independent props via data (like Aussie trade and PPI). Hence, Aud/Usd remains closer to the top of a 0.7250+ to 0.7040 band, and likewise the Kiwi is hovering nearer 0.6689 than 0.6500, as the Aud/Nzd cross remains capped below 1.0850.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable has lost grip of the 1.3000 handle yet again, but is still on track to close out the week well ahead of its approx. 1.2825 start point and even further above the 1.2695 low. Aside from the Dollar&rsquo;s rise and fall from grace, Brexit developments on balance appear to be Pound-supportive even if press reports about deals with the EU on securing access for UK financial services firms seem to have been premature and a supposed compromise offer from the EU on the Irish border has yet to be confirmed or confounded. Meanwhile, UK manufacturing and construction PMIs were mixed and BoE super Thursday more upbeat/hawkish overall, but heavily contingent on Brexit, as usual. The Loonie is back near mid-range levels between 1.3170-1.3045 with weak crude prices an intermittent if not constant weight, but Canadian employment data not as encouraging as the US version (headline payrolls just above forecast and largely due to full time jobs, but average earnings soft). The Jpy has mainly been a victim or beneficiary of swings in risk sentiment, with no real additional impetus from an unchanged BoJ, and the headline pair is up around the top of 111.75-113.40 parameters as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some big moves in regional currencies and decent upside vs the Usd, in line with the general trend and improvement in risk appetite, but also due to some technical and specific factors. The Cny and Cnh have both traded above 6.9000 vs 6.9700+ at one stage on the thawing in US-China tariff angst, while the Try has rebounded through 14.5000 for similar reasons, as the US and Turkey both reciprocate on the removal of sanctions. Technical impulses also helping the Zar on a clean break of 14.5000 resistance, with the Mxn also back above a psychological level (20.0000) and paring some airport-related losses.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, reports that Trump asked the cabinet to draft a potential China trade deal added fuel to the rally and helped US equity futures recover from the after-market pressure triggered by declines in Apple shares after the tech giant missed on iPhone and iPad sales, provided soft Q1 revenue guidance and announced to halt product unit sales data. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.6%) were mixed throughout most the session with Australia dampened by energy names after WTI crude futures slipped 2.7% to below USD 64.00/bbl on higher OPEC production in October, while the Japanese benchmark surged on a weaker currency and the encouraging trade related news. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+4.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.7%) also rose aggressively on the positive developments between US and China, with gains led by strength in tech names as well as casino stocks post-Macau gaming revenue numbers. Finally, 10yr JGBs were eventually flat as the initial upside was wiped out as US-China trade hopes were kindled by overnight reports, while the BoJ were also in the market today and increased its purchase amounts in the 1-5yr JGBs which was unsurprising given the reduction in the number of occasions it had planned for those purchases this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump has asked his cabinet to draft a possible China trade deal in an attempt to signal a ceasefire in tensions, according to sources.

The FSTE MIB (+1.5%) is leading after reports in Il Sole that Banca Carige are the only Italian bank seen as fragile; while the SMI is lagging (+0.1%) after the US FDA announced that Roche&rsquo;s (-1.5%) recall is Class 1. Indices are mixed with materials (+2.3%) outperforming due to trade progression between the US and China, notably President Trump said to have asked his cabinet to draft a potential trade deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of individual equities Kering (+5%) are higher after being upgraded at RBC, which has had a knock-on impact on other luxury names such as Burberry (4.5%), Moncler (+5.5%) and LVMH (+3.8%) who are up in sympathy. Separately, BMW (+2.5%) are up as they state they are expanding their car share service into 5 more London boroughs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - No respite for the Dollar, as its retracement from midweek peaks continues, albeit at a more measured pace. The latest downturn comes amidst reports that US President Trump has commissioned a draft trade accord with China following his encouraging chat with Xi and plans for a dinner+ date between the 2 at the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina. The Greenback is weaker vs all G10 counterparts, bar the JPY, which is still bucking the trend as an even safer currency haven, although the headline pair has topped out just above 113.00+ again and is back below its 30 DMA at 112.85, which could be pivotal on a closing basis. On that note, the DXY looks precarious just a fraction ahead of 96.000 in advance of NFP that could determine whether the index stabilises, recoils further or rebounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - The major outperformer and main beneficiary of constructive dialogue between China and the US, with Aud/Usd extending its marked recovery to 0.7250 before fading and essentially tracking Yuan moves after a considerably lower Usd/Cny fix overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/NZD/GBP/CAD - All firmer vs the Buck, with the single currency not deterred by some downbeat Eurozone manufacturing PMIs and breaching a key Fib at 1.1426 to expose 1.1450 before 1.1460. However, a cluster of hefty option expiries, and 3.1 bn at the 1.1400 strike may stall Eur/Usd, ahead of 1.6 bn between 1.1450-60. The Franc is back above parity, and perhaps belatedly taking some note of SNB commentary yesterday about the inevitability of tighter policy, while the Kiwi continues to piggy-back its Antipodean peer with gains up towards 0.6700 before waning. Elsewhere, Cable has sustained 1.3000+ status after a knee-jerk visit post-BoE super Thursday, and cleared its 10 DMA circa 1.3005-10 with the aid of more positive-sounding Brexit reports (on paper), but respecting the 100 DMA from 1.3045-50. The Loonie is holding near the upper end of 1.3050-1.3100 parameters and also has jobs data looming to provide some independent direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - Very little deviation within a 10.3215-10.2900 range vs the Eur on the Riksbank minutes that effectively reaffirmed October policy meeting guidance for a hike in either December or February 2019, but with data between now and year end key (like the next CPI report on November 14).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Broad gains vs the Usd, with the Try through 5.5000 and Cnh breaking 6.9000, but Rub lagging against the backdrop of still soggy oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.1%) and Brent (+0.3%) began the session lower following increased oil supply from Russia, OPEC and the US for October, notably the highest OPEC level since December 2016; an increase which has thrust the oil market into an oversupply dragging down prices. However, this has since reverted as Iran&rsquo;s Deputy Oil Minister commented that he is unsure if waivers are permanent; comments which follow reports that 8 countries have received waivers allowing them to continue to purchase Iranian oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.1%) is continuing the steady trade seen in Asia overnight, although off of yesterday&rsquo;s highs of USD 1237.39/oz as market sentiment improves following Presidents Trump and Xi expressing optimism over the trade dispute. Separately, Trump has initiated an executive order preventing anyone within the US from dealing with anyone associated with gold sales from Venezuela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is to give 8 countries waivers on new Iran oil sanctions, according to sources; updates to follow on the breakdown but India and South Korea have been touted as two of the nations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is attempting to broker a deal between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait concerning restart of &#39;neutral zone&#39; oil production and US is also attempting to persuade Iraq to permit oil exports through Kurdistan, according to sources. Furthermore, reports added that &lsquo;neutral zone&rsquo; issues are far from resolved and may take 9 months to bring its crude output to full capacity of around 500k bpd, while US told Iraq it may get Iran sanctions waiver if it permits resumption of Kirkuk oil exports to Turkey. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may well be too premature to suggest that core debt futures have set tops and bottoms prior to the US jobs data, but the assumption is probable given no scheduled data/events between now and the big release. However, Italian BTPs are trying to nudge higher towards 123.00 (122.79 best, so far, +69 ticks vs -9 ticks at one stage) and this could see Bunds retest support ahead of the next downside chart support level at 159.42 vs their 159.52 Eurex low (-46 ticks). Meanwhile, Gilts are slipping back from a minor new Liffe intraday peak of 121.99 to revisit the 121.83 trough (-41 ticks) and US Treasuries remain rooted near worst levels seen during the overnight session with the curve slightly steeper pre-NFP.</p>\r\n",

The Loonie is holding near the upper end of 1.3050-1.3100 parameters and also has jobs data looming to provide some independent direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - Very little deviation within a 10.3215-10.2900 range vs the Eur on the Riksbank minutes that effectively reaffirmed October policy meeting guidance for a hike in either December or February 2019, but with data between now and year end key (like the next CPI report on November 14).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Broad gains vs the Usd, with the Try through 5.5000 and Cnh breaking 6.9000, but Rub lagging against the backdrop of still soggy oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may well be too premature to suggest that core debt futures have set tops and bottoms prior to the US jobs data, but the assumption is probable given no scheduled data/events between now and the big release. However, Italian BTPs are trying to nudge higher towards 123.00 (122.79 best, so far, +69 ticks vs -9 ticks at one stage) and this could see Bunds retest support ahead of the next downside chart support level at 159.42 vs their 159.52 Eurex low (-46 ticks). Meanwhile, Gilts are slipping back from a minor new Liffe intraday peak of 121.99 to revisit the 121.83 trough (-41 ticks) and US Treasuries remain rooted near worst levels seen during the overnight session with the curve slightly steeper pre-NFP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.1%) and Brent (+0.3%) began the session lower following increased oil supply from Russia, OPEC and the US for October, notably the highest OPEC level since December 2016; an increase which has thrust the oil market into an oversupply dragging down prices. However, this has since reverted as Iran&rsquo;s Deputy Oil Minister commented that he is unsure if waivers are permanent; comments which follow reports that 8 countries have received waivers allowing them to continue to purchase Iranian oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.1%) is continuing the steady trade seen in Asia overnight, although off of yesterday&rsquo;s highs of USD 1237.39/oz as market sentiment improves following Presidents Trump and Xi expressing optimism over the trade dispute. Separately, Trump has initiated an executive order preventing anyone within the US from dealing with anyone associated with gold sales from Venezuela.</p>\r\n",

Note also, press reports about an EU compromise on the Irish border will add to the overall improvement in sentiment, and go some way towards offsetting the disappointment over no financial services deal, yet. Gilts are holding just off a 121.86 low vs their previous 122.24 settlement and an early high of 121.98, as Bunds pare some losses from a minor new Eurex base (159.55, -43 ticks), while the UK STIR strip is 1-3 ticks below parity. Ahead, October&rsquo;s construction PMI carries a downside bias to consensus, and post-NFP comments from BoE&rsquo;s Tenreyro may offer a bit more insight than Broadbent earlier.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets tracked their Wall St counterparts higher after US stocks posted a 3rd consecutive gain with sentiment underpinned by optimism regarding US-China trade after what US President Trump described as a &lsquo;very good&rsquo; conversation between him and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Furthermore, reports that Trump asked the cabinet to draft a potential China trade deal added fuel to the rally and helped US equity futures recover from the after-market pressure triggered by declines in Apple shares after the tech giant missed on iPhone and iPad sales, provided soft Q1 revenue guidance and announced to halt product unit sales data. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.5%) were mixed throughout most the session with Australia dampened by energy names after WTI crude futures slipped 2.7% to below USD 64.00/bbl on higher OPEC production in October, while the Japanese benchmark surged on a weaker currency and the encouraging trade related news. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+3.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.1%) also rose aggressively on the positive developments between US and China, with gains led by strength in tech names as well as casino stocks post-Macau gaming revenue numbers. Finally, 10yr JGBs were eventually flat as the initial upside was wiped out as US-China trade hopes were kindled by overnight reports, while the BoJ were also in the market today and increased its purchase amounts in the 1-5yr JGBs which was unsurprising given the reduction in the number of occasions it had planned for those purchases this month.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets mostly track their Wall St counterparts higher after US stocks posted a 3rd consecutive gain with sentiment underpinned by optimism regarding US-China trade after what US President Trump described as a &lsquo;very good&rsquo; conversation between him and Chinese President Xi Jinping. However, US equity futures were pressured after the close which was triggered by declines in Apple shares, as the tech giant reported Q4 results in which it beat on EPS and revenue but missed on iPhone and iPad sales, provided soft Q1 revenue guidance and announced to halt product unit sales data. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) are mixed with Australia dragged lower by energy names after WTI crude futures slipped 2.7% to below USD 64.00/bbl on higher OPEC production in October, while the Japanese benchmark surged on a weaker currency and encouraging earnings including KDDI but with gains capped by resistance around the 22000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+2.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%) outperform after the encouraging dialogue between US and China, with the gains led by strength in tech names as well as casino stocks post-Macau gaming revenue numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, most major currencies are taking a breather from the broad rally against the greenback heading into today&rsquo;s Non-Farm Payrolls report, which has helped the greenback nurse some of the prior day&rsquo;s losses. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD have slightly eased from Thursday&rsquo;s highs to trade back below the 1.1400 and 1.3000 handles respectively, while antipodeans are steady with AUD/USD indecisive around 0.7200 to remain near its best levels in a month after mixed data in which Retail Sales disappointed but PPI printed at a multi-year high. Elsewhere, the PBoC strengthened its reference rate in light of the recent USD weakness, while JPY also saw outflows amid the heightened risk appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher as they track the gains in T-notes and recover some from the prior day&rsquo;s selling pressure, while the BoJ were also in the market today and upped its purchase amounts in the 1-5yr JGBs which was unsurprising given the reduction in number of occasions it plans to buy those amounts this month.</p>\r\n",
