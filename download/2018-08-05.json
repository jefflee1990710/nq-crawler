(Newswires)<br />Note: The PBoC had previously cut the reserve requirement on FX forwards to 0% from 20% in September last year which some suggested was an effort to stem the yuan&#39;s appreciation, while today&#39;s announcement restores it back to that level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China released their potential retaliation list to US tariff threats on Friday and are to impose differentiated tariffs on approximately USD 60bln US goods. China said the measures are to guard its interest and to keep trade frictions from escalating and that import tax rates will range from 5%, 10% and 25%. Furthermore, China stated the government reserve the right for additional retaliation measures, while the proposed retaliatory tariff list by China includes some US aircraft, chemical products, wine, semiconductors, auto parts, lumber, iron ore, steel products, dried beef and soybean oil. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China state media commentary stated that US administration&rsquo;s extreme pressure and blackmail are clear to the world but added that these methods will not be fruitful against China. (Xinhua)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House spokesperson said on Friday that the US has had a high level of discussions with China on trade over the past few months and noted they are open to having further conversations. However, there were also comments from a senior US administration official that there has been zero engagement between US president Trump &amp; China, apart from one call in the last few days which resolved nothing. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Trade Secretary Fox said the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit is increasing in which he blamed the &quot;intransigence&quot; of the European Commission. Fox also placed the chances of leaving the EU without a deal at &quot;60-40&quot; and stated that EU Chief Negotiator Barnier dismissed the UK&#39;s Chequers proposals simply because &quot;we have never done it before&quot;. This also comes alongside commentary in the Sunday Times over the weekend that businesses and investors are scrambling to protect themselves against a plunge in the value of the pound if Britain crashes out of the EU in March. (BBC/Sunday Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond alleged that France was attempting to stall UK access to the EU post-Brexit. (FT)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Lautenschlaeger stated it would be wrong for the central bank to abruptly change monetary policy direction which would not help the economy nor price stability. Lautenschlaeger also stated she is very much in favour of normalizing monetary policy which means gradually raising interest rates and that the pre-condition is that the path to price stability is sustainably strengthened.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump stated that tariffs are working and that the US will be able to begin reducing large amounts of its USD 21tln debt due to tariffs. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NEC Director Kudlow said he does not want to forecast 5% GDP growth but said it is definitely a &lsquo;plausible number&rsquo;, while he also said the USD 200bln tariffs on Chinese goods are not finalised and warned China should not underestimate Trump on trade. Kudlow added China&rsquo;s USD 60bln tariffs might be weak and that there has been some communication &quot;at the highest level&quot; between US and China, while he also noted that that there is some hint that China now wish to talk. Furthermore, Kudlow commented that an announcement with the EU will be coming up and that they will probably have positive news on Mexico with an announcement to be within 30 days. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico&#39;s Economy Minister Guarjardo said they are ready to move into finishing up most of the issues between US and Mexico next week and is optimistic a deal can be done by the end of August.

However, the move was undone as China released its potential retaliation list of tariffs on up to $60bln of US goods. However, the moves were very limited, with ES patrolling a 10-point range in US hours. Kraft Heinz (KHC) reported its figures Friday morning which beat on both the top and bottom lines. KHC were also boosted after reports in NY Post which stated the food manufacturer was in preliminary talks with Campbell Soup (CPB), according to people familiar with the matter. The NY Post reported that KHC is looking for a bargain, and will likely not pay much of a premium for CPB. DISH (DISH) beat on both top and bottom lines, which placed it as one of the outperformers on Friday. DISH&rsquo;s earnings cool gave a lift to the shares throughout the day as the co. is on track to finish its wireless network on time, and the Chairman stated they are confident its Internet of Things network will be accepted by the FCC. CBS (CBS) reported AMC on Thursday with little fireworks as EPS beat by 1c and revenues beat by $10mln. Alphabet (GOOGL) are reportedly struggling to regain entry into China due to ongoing trade tensions, and it is also being investigated by the Turkish antitrust board. During hours, WSJ reported that Australia&rsquo;s Amcor is in late stage talks with Bemis (BMS) where the shares spiked 6% before resuming and extending to intraday highs of 13%. IBM (IBM) outperformed the DJI following unconfirmed source reports that Carl Icahn is building a stake in the company. SPX +0.5% at 2840, NDX +0.3% at 7395, DJI at +0.5% at 25462.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were further reports of short-covering after traders were positioned for a better NFP headline based on the ADP data released on Wednesday, IGM said. The complex was also buoyed by a ramping up of trade tensions (this time, from the Chinese side). The net result was a slightly flatter curve, with major curve spreads little changed. US 10YR T-notes settled 9 ticks higher at 119-19+.</p>\r\n",
