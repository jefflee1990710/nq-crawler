Casino names Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) outperformed after strong sales data for November in the Macau region. A rebound in crude prices projected oil names higher (COP, PXD, EOG, NBL, APC). FAANG (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOGL) and industrials (CAT, BA, DE) also benefitted from the China/US trade developments with the two groups surging on the open.

That helped equities gap open, and yields rise. However, the risk moves were faded as the session wore on, with analysts noting that the delay in implementing tariff hikes (or implementing fresh rounds of tariffs) was not a permanent solution; indeed, some had observed the differences between the official US and Chinese statements, where the US offered more colour (though not detail). Nevertheless, yields on 2s were still higher at settlement while the rest of the curve came in, forcing some of the major curves to narrow.

On Monday, Trump announced that relations with China have taken a step forward while Treasury Secretary Mnuchin expressed hope that a real agreement will be reached given that China has showed willingness to make progress in key areas for the first time; he warned however that tariffs will be implemented warning that if an agreement doesn&rsquo;t come. Similarly, White House Economic Advisor Kudlow stated that there was &quot;good chemistry&quot; between Trump and Xi at their meeting and therefore he is cautiously optimistic over a deal; he highlighted they are pretty close to a deal on IPs and claimed that China is committed to lifting tariffs, non-tariff barriers immediately, including the 40% auto tariffs and retaliatory tariffs on US commodities. He also announced that USTR Lighthizer will enforce a 90-day timetable during negotiations, beginning January 1st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; ITALY: </strong>Finance Minister Tria announced on Monday that Italy are negotiating with the European Commission to lower the 2019 deficit/GDP target to between 1.9%-2.0%; in later comments however, PM Conte stated he is not working on a budget below 2% while Deputy PM Salvini stressed that the EU cannot ask for a 1.9% and reiterated the basics will not change. European Commission Vice President Dombrovskis urged once again for substantial corrections are needed in the Italian budget, adding that it is up to Italy now to come up with adjustments and is not calling for concrete steps taken by Italy now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The UK government has published a 43-page summary of the Brexit legal advice which has raised fear among MPs that the UK could remain stuck in the EU indefinitely since it makes clear the backstop will continue until both the UK and EU can agree other customs arrangements. &nbsp;Some have suggested that the document fell short of what the Commons requested last month and argued that the full legal advice contains warnings on the backstop that have not been outlined in this document, making it impossible for the UK to escape from the backstop unilaterally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed Vice Chair Clarida said the US baseline outlook is very solid and noted that the Fed dot projections of interest rates are &quot;not going anywhere&quot;. Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Dove, Non-Voter) continues to make the case to hold off on rate hikes, warning that the Fed could inadvertently push the economy into recession if it continues boosting borrowing costs. Fed&#39;s Kaplan (Dove, Non-Voter) urged the Fed to be &ldquo;very patient&rdquo; as it considers further rate evidence of slower inflation and softening global growth hikes, given the impact of past rises. Fed&#39;s Quarles (Voter, Neutral) reiterated the Fed&#39;s data dependency approach and noted that the neutral rate is not very precise but is a useful concept, currently at the bottom of neutral rate range. He added the performance of the economy would indicate the Fed is doing a good job. Fed&#39;s Brainard (Voter, Neutral) stated that the US economy is at or beyond full employment and inflation is around target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US ISM MANUFACTURING PMI rose to 59.3 from 57.7 in November</strong>, beating expectations of 57.6. New orders came in at a strong 62.1 supported by strong domestic orders; employment also posted gains rising to 58.4 from 56.8, above the 56.5 consensus. On the flip side, prices paid moderated to 60.7 from 71.6 and missed expectations at 70.0; Scotiabank argues the weakness in this print may reflect the recent slump in oil prices. Overall, Scotiabank they are that the &ldquo;domestic economy&rsquo;s strengths outweigh anything of concern in terms of the external side of the US picture&rdquo; and note that today&rsquo;s reading &ldquo;outperformed what regional surveys like the Philly and Richmond metrics&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CONSTRUCTION SPENDING fell by 0.1% in October</strong>, missing expectations of a 0.4% rise; the prior was also revised down to -0.1% with the headline declining for the 3rd consecutive month. The weakness was led by residentials who were down 0.5% while non-residential rose mildly by 0.1%; also home building remains &ldquo;sluggish&rdquo; as affordability issues continue to play a role. Nonetheless, Wells Fargo sates that &ldquo;spending remains up 4.9% year-over-year&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX +1.09% at 2790, NDX +1.63% at 7062, DJI +1.13% at 25826. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +2.28%, Materials +1.74%, Industrials +1.17%, Cons Discretionary +2.21%, Cons Staples -0.09%, Healthcare +0.44%, Financials +0.47%, Tech +2.11%, Telecoms +0.07%, Utilities +0.88%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Chipmakers including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron (MU), NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC) all opened higher on the back of positive US/China trade developments. Casino names Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) outperformed after strong sales data for November in the Macau region. A rebound in crude prices projected oil names higher (COP, PXD, EOG, NBL, APC). FAANG (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOGL) and industrials (CAT, BA, DE) also benefitted from the China/US trade developments with the two groups surging on the open. Discovery (DISCA) underperformed on it announcing a fall in its ad revenue forecasting. Video game developers Activision (ATVI) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) continued their selloff from last week; with BoAML defending TTWO saying it had been oversold. Verizon (VZ) opened lower following a downgrade at JPMorgan. General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra will meet with senators Wednesday to talk about recent plant closings. Fox (FOXA) dropped in later trading after Brazilian regulators said the acquisition by Disney (DIS) was a cause for concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 2.02 HIGHER AT USD 52.95/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 2.23 HIGHER AT USD 61.69/BBL. </strong>The crude is up, though off highs, bouncing on Monday due to a combination of the positive outcome on the Trump/Xi &lsquo;trade ceasefire&rsquo; reached at the G20, that helps support global growth and consequentially, oil demand; it also helped support risk sentiment, which was positive for crude. Additionally, at the G20, Russia said it will continue to be part of the OPEC+ pact to cut crude output into 2019. Analysts have noted that no specific cut level was touted, and allocations of cuts was also not mentioned. Ahead of the OPEC meeting on 6-7 December, the consensus expects a cut of between 1.0mln BPD and 1.4mln BPD. The complex has also been supported by news that Alberta temporarily cutting 325k BPD of oil sands production in January, until excess crude in storage is drawn down. The latest newswire surveys sees estimates of OPEC crude production slightly moderating in November, with the 350k BPD rise in Saudi production offsetting the 500k BPD fall in Iranian output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 4+ TICKS HIGHER AT 119-22.</strong> US Treasuries were offered at the beginning of the week, with risk rallying on a &#39;trade ceasefire&#39; between US/China. That helped equities gap open, and yields rise. However, the risk moves were faded as the session wore on, with analysts noting that the delay in implementing tariff hikes (or implementing fresh rounds of tariffs) was not a permanent solution; indeed, some had observed the differences between the official US and Chinese statements, where the US offered more colour (though not detail). Nevertheless, yields on 2s were still higher at settlement while the rest of the curve came in, forcing some of the major curves to narrow. Of particular note was the inversion of the 3s5s curve, while 2s30s was around 0.5bps at settle. Looking to the rest of the week, catalysts include the ongoing trade rhetoric, and payrolls at the end of the week; with the Fed reiterating a data-dependent approach to policy, the employment situation report may regain some of the significance it held at the height of the crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CAD, NZD:</strong> All just off best levels, but still markedly outperforming and holding healthy gains vs their US counterpart in wake of the accord between the US and China to hold off from further reciprocal import taxes for 3 months and redouble efforts to reach a formal trade agreement. Moreover, President Trump declares that big strides were made between the 2 nations after his meeting with China&rsquo;s Xi and US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin underlined this statement by noting a first in terms of receiving assurances from Beijing that it will change policies in key areas. Aud/Usd derived most from the positive developments and bullish if not quite euphoric post-G20 mood to scale new multi-month peaks just shy of 0.7400 before losing a bit of momentum ahead of the big figure where 1+ bn option expiries rolled off at the NY cut, and with the 200 DMA at 0.7418 also keeping buyers at bay. Meanwhile, the Loonie got an additional boost from a sharp rebound in crude, partly due to Canada&rsquo;s decision to cut oil production in Alberta, but was still dogged by trade issues of its own with the US and retreated ahead of 1.3150, and the Kiwi was capped around 0.6940 after weaker than expected NZ terms of trade overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, CHF, JPY, GBP: </strong>Ending Monday&rsquo;s EU session narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with the single currency managing to stay above 1.1300 amidst reports that the Italian Government and EU are getting closer towards reaching a compromise on the 2019 deficit as the coalition is reportedly looking to cut the shortfall to 2% after yet another budget meeting today. Earlier Eur/Usd failed to test 1.1400 where more heavy offers are said to be sitting, and the headline pair also had decent option expiries in sight between 1.1380-90 (circa 1.3 bn). Mixed fortunes for the safe-havens, with the Franc back above parity and perhaps bolstered independently by firmer Swiss retail sales and above forecast manufacturing PMI, but the Jpy weaker for choice in the significantly improved risk environment and pivoting 113.50. The Pound endured a rocky ride with Cable up through 1.2800 stops at one stage to a high around 1.2825, but Brexit fears never far from the surface and pulling prices back through the round number (that also coincided with the 10 DMA), then the recent &lsquo;Raab&rsquo; low (1.2725) to 1.2700 before the rot stopped &ndash; note, UK PM May to speak shortly and the Cox legal presentation was roundly jeered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Widespread gains vs the Usd, that struggled to regain composure overall (DXY back briefly over 97.000, but only just), with the exception of the recently outperforming Turkish Lira that hit resistance around 5.1500 again and could not benefit from a decline in CPI given the aforementioned pronounced rebound in crude prices &ndash; Usd/Try now back up near 5.2850.</p>\r\n",

Additionally, also at the G20, Russia said it will continue to be part of the OPEC+ pact to cut crude output into 2019. Analysts have noted that no specific cut level was touted, and allocations of cuts was also not mentioned. Ahead of the OPEC meeting on 6-7 December, the consensus expects a cut of between 1.0mln BPD and 1.4mln BPD. The complex has also been supported by news that Alberta temporarily cutting 325k BPD of oil sands production in January, until excess crude in storage is drawn down. The latest newswire surveys sees estimates of OPEC crude production slightly moderating in November, with the 350k BPD rise in Saudi production offsetting the 500k BPD fall in Iranian output.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>AUD/CAD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All just off best levels, but still markedly outperforming and holding healthy gains vs their US counterpart in wake of the accord between the US and China to hold off from further reciprocal import taxes for 3 months and redouble efforts to reach a formal trade agreement. Moreover, President Trump declares that big strides were made between the 2 nations after his meeting with China&rsquo;s Xi and US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin underlined this statement by noting a first in terms of receiving assurances from Beijing that it will change policies in key areas. Aud/Usd derived most from the positive developments and bullish if not quite euphoric post-G20 mood to scale new multi-month peaks just shy of 0.7400 before losing a bit of momentum ahead of the big figure where 1+ bn option expiries rolled off at the NY cut, and with the 200 DMA at 0.7418 also keeping buyers at bay. Meanwhile, the Loonie got an additional boost from a sharp rebound in crude, partly due to Canada&rsquo;s decision to cut oil production in Alberta, but was still dogged by trade issues of its own with the US and retreated ahead of 1.3150, and the Kiwi was capped around 0.6940 after weaker than expected NZ terms of trade overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/JPY/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Monday&rsquo;s EU session narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with the single currency managing to stay above 1.1300 amidst reports that the Italian Government and EU are getting closer towards reaching a compromise on the 2019 deficit as the coalition is reportedly looking to cut the shortfall to 2% after yet another budget meeting today. Earlier Eur/Usd failed to test 1.1400 where more heavy offers are said to be sitting, and the headline pair also had decent option expiries in sight between 1.1380-90 (circa 1.3 bn). Mixed fortunes for the safe-havens, with the Franc back above parity and perhaps bolstered independently by firmer Swiss retail sales and above forecast manufacturing PMI, but the Jpy weaker for choice in the significantly improved risk environment and pivoting 113.50. The Pound endured a rocky ride with Cable up through 1.2800 stops at one stage to a high around 1.2825, but Brexit fears never far from the surface and pulling prices back through the round number (that also coincided with the 10 DMA), then the recent &lsquo;Raab&rsquo; low (1.2725) to 1.2700 before the rot stopped &ndash; note, UK PM May to speak shortly and the Cox legal presentation was roundly jeered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Widespread gains vs the Usd, that struggled to regain composure overall (DXY back briefly over 97.000, but only just), with the exception of the recently outperforming Turkish Lira that hit resistance around 5.1500 again, and could not benefit from a decline in CPI given the aforementioned pronounced rebound in crude prices &ndash; Usd/Try now back up near 5.2850.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, there were reports that the G20 draft statement agreed that the current global trading system has flaws and is in need of reform. (Newswires/BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the US which are currently at 40%. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldman Sachs said the actual amount of concrete progress at the Trump-Xi meeting seems quite limited as expected, while it added that there is just over 50% probability that discussions will fail and that the tariff increase to 25% will still happen in March or later.

News of the tariff ceasefire spurred a rally in US equity futures in which the Emini S&amp;P and DJIA futures reclaimed the 2800 and 26000 levels respectively, with the blue-chip index up nearly 500 points. ASX 200 (+1.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) advanced with Australia led by commodity-related sectors as energy benefitted from the positive trade developments and Russia-Saudi agreement to extend the OPEC+ accord, while the JPY-risk dynamic was very much in play for Tokyo trade.

As such DXY fell to lows of 96.710 vs. last week&rsquo;s low of 96.622, though the index is nursing losses in an attempt to take another jab at 97.000. USD/CNY fell below the key 6.90 level despite a higher USD/CNY fix by the PBOC overnight, while JPY unwound some risk premium with USD/JPY stopping just shy of 114.00, but the headline pair supported just ahead of a downside tech-level (Tenken at 113.34).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD, CAD &ndash; Major high-beta beneficiaries in the aftermath of the G20, with AUD/USD within striking distance of 0.7400 (where 1.365bln in option expiries lie) ahead of its 200DMA at 0.7418, while the Kiwi holds above 0.6900, marginally hampered by weaker than expected Q3 terms of trade and softer export volumes. Meanwhile, CAD also takes advantage of the rising oil prices after Russia and KSA extended their OPEC+ pact, on top of the tactical 325k BPD production cut at Canada&rsquo;s Alberta refinery. USD/CAD currently sub-1.3200 but off post-G20 lows of 1.3160.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK, NOK &ndash; An improvement in the manufacturing PMI has provided the Swedish Crown with some extra fuel to break through 10.2500 vs. the EUR. Nordea notes that all sub-indices rose (ex-employment) while also adding that the release is in line with NIER&rsquo;s improved sentiment. Meanwhile, NOK also deriving gains from the oil complex with EUR/NOK giving up the 9.7000 handle to sit just above 9.6800. However, NOK gains are capped by pre-positioning for the next Norges Bank F-loan payment on December 6th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, EUR -&nbsp; Little reaction in the pound and the single currency following mixed manufacturing PMIs with Cable back down below 1.2750 (after having breached its 10DMA at 1.2800 where stops were reportedly tripped) and through the Raab-low at 1.2724 to test bids ahead of 1.2700, while EUR/USD couldn&rsquo;t sustain gains to 1.1400 before retreating through 1.1350 and towards 1.1300. Note, the single currency was supported earlier on Italian press reports that PM Conte is said to be preparing for a deficit/GDP target in the range of 1.9%-2.0%, with the Deputy PMs apparently ready to accept the new target, but has eased back in wake of the ECB&rsquo;s announcement of Capital Key changes, including a perhaps surprisingly lower Italian ratio. In terms of option expiries, EUR/USD sees 1.32bln around 1.1380-90 ahead of reported offers at 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &ndash; TRY back in focus with softer than expected Turkish CPI helping the Lira retest recent highs around 5.1500 vs. the buck at one stage, but unable to breach resistance as the USD stage a broad comeback.</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, mixed Eurozone results were also largely ignored, or at least shrugged off even though Italy&rsquo;s contraction intensified, with Bunds and BTPs also holding near best levels. Technically, the 10 year German benchmark has resistance up at 161.41-44 ahead of Friday&rsquo;s close and intraday peak at 161.54 and 161.58 respectively, while support remains around 161.00. Elsewhere, US Treasuries have inched up from overnight session lows and the curve is not quite as steep ahead of a relatively busy Monday agenda including data, several Fed speakers and the first slug of this week&rsquo;s hefty supply.</p>\r\n",

Indeed, the 10 year German debt futures recently rebounded to 161.34 (-20 ticks vs -53 ticks off the Eurex open) even though its Italian counterpart has inched a tad further towards near term resistance and a Fib at 125.34, with a fresh peak of 125.24.

Moreover, Bunds have a sharp rebound in BTPs to contend with as the 10 year debt futures rallies over 125.00 to 125.10 and close to a key Fib at 125.34 that several tech charts have been flagging on the back of latest reports suggesting Italian PM Conte is looking at a 2% or even 1.9% 2019 deficit, and pertinently with the approval of Deputies Salvini and Di Maio. Confirmation after another meeting between the top coalition Government officials in Rome later today could well see Italian assets trade higher, while a bullish open for EU equities may see 161.00 breached before some potential props in the form of Eurozone manufacturing PMIs that look set to be weak.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, there were reports that the G20 draft statement agreed that the current global trading system has flaws and is in need of reform. (Newswires/BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the US which are currently at 40%. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldman Sachs said the actual amount of concrete progress at the Trump-Xi meeting seems quite limited as expected, while it added that there is just over 50% probability that discussions will fail and that the tariff increase to 25% will still happen in March or later. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian equity markets were higher across the board with global risk appetite boosted following the US-China trade truce at the G20. News of the tariff ceasefire spurred a rally in US equity futures in which the Emini S&amp;P and DJIA futures reclaimed the 2800 and 26000 levels respectively, with the blue-chip index up nearly 500 points. ASX 200 (+1.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) advanced with Australia led by commodity-related sectors as energy benefitted from the positive trade developments and Russia-Saudi agreement to extend the OPEC+ accord, while the JPY-risk dynamic was very much in play for Tokyo trade. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+2.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.6%) outperformed on the easing of trade tensions, with sentiment also supported by better than expected Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI and after the CFFEX relaxed domestic stock index futures trading conditions. Finally, 10yr JGBs initially saw a bout of weakness at the open amid the heightened risk appetite, although prices later recovered amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 800bln of JGBs with maturities of up to 5yrs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.9431 (Prev. 6.9357)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI (Nov) 50.2 vs. Exp. 50.1 (Prev. 50.1). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Financial Futures Exchange CFFEX relaxed restrictions on domestic stock index futures trading with reports noting that some margin requirements and commissions arel be lowered. (Xinhua)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May was reportedly under renewed pressure as the DUP threatened to abandon support for her in a confidence vote if she failed to get her Brexit deal approved in Parliament. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&#39;s chief Brexit adviser Oliver Robbins secretly warned her the PM that customs backstop is a &quot;bad outcome&quot; for the UK which will see regulatory checks in the Irish Sea and put security co-operation at risk, according to the Telegraph. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Gove, has told Conservative rebels that there was a &ldquo;real risk&rdquo; of a second Brexit referendum if they don&rsquo;t back PM May&rsquo;s deal with Brussels. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Shadow Brexit Secretary Starmer said that Labour would almost certainly seek a vote of no confidence if UK PM May loses the key Commons vote on her Brexit deal on December 11th. (The Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK trade body EEF raised 2018 manufacturing production growth forecast to 1.1% from 0.9% but cut 2019 forecast to 0.3% from 0.5%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian PM Conte stated they are examining several options for a budget deal with the EU in which a solution could be made within days. (Newswires) Later it was reported, that Italian PM Conte is reportedly preparing for a deficit of 1.9%-2.0%, while Italian Deputy PMs Salvini and Di Maio are said to be ready to accept new target, according to Messaggero.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD was softer as the US-China trade truce spurred outflows from safe-haven currencies which also underpinned JPY-crosses and benefitted most of the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts. As such, EUR/USD strengthened with the pair also supported by hopes of a potential Italian budget solution within days, while gains in GBP/USD were moderate amid ongoing Brexit-related uncertainty with the DUP threatening to abandon support for PM May in a confidence vote if her Brexit deal fails in Parliament. Elsewhere, AUD, NZD and CAD appreciated due to their high-beta statuses and amid a surge in commodity prices in which WTI crude futures and several Chinese base metals rallied over 5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were higher across the board in which WTI crude futures stole the limelight as it gained over 5% in the aftermath of the G20 developments including the US-China trade truce and Russia-Saudi agreement to extend the OPEC+ accord. The oil rally was further exacerbated as Shanghai commodities trade got underway and amid reports Canada&rsquo;s Alberta is to cut oil output by 9% due to a supply glut. Elsewhere, gold saw marginal gains with upside restricted amid lack of demand for safe-havens, while copper gapped higher amid outperformance in China and broad strength across Shanghai commodities trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baker Hughes Rig Count (30/Nov): Oil up 2 rigs at 887, gas down 5 rigs at 189, total rigs down 3 at 1076.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada&#39;s Alberta mandates 325k bpd or 9% output reduction in oil to ease supply glut effective January. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />OPEC Economic Panel recommended an output cut from October levels according to reports on Friday, while it was also noted that a 1.3mln bpd cut seen as efficient to balance the market. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korean President Moon and US President Trump agreed to revive momentum regarding negotiations for North Korea denuclearization. In related news, South Korean President Moon said a visit by North Korean Leader Kim to Seoul is still open and possible this year, while US President Trump is said to be targeting a summit with North Korean leader early 2019. (Newswires/Nikkei)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex seemed to have been detached from the broader themes (G20/trade/etc) on Friday and once again put in a lacklustre performance with a thin range, as traders refrained from making any major moves ahead of the outcome of the dinner between Trump/Xi, as well as on month-end. Fed&rsquo;s Kashkari (dove, non-voter) also lent some support to the complex, though in reality, it was a rattling-off of his usual dovish views. Major curve spreads narrowed modestly by between 0.5bps to 2bps, though 10s30s were a touch wider. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 4 ticks higher at 119-17+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher across the board with global risk appetite boosted following the US-China trade truce at the G20 in which US President Trump agreed to delay hiking tariffs on USD 200bln of Chinese goods for 90 days and China agreed to buy a &quot;very substantial&quot; amount of US products. News of the tariff ceasefire lifted US equity futures with the Emini S&amp;P gaining around 1.5% to test 2800.00 and with DJIA futures higher by over 400 points to reclaim the 26000 level. As such, ASX 200 (+1.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.4%) advanced with Australia led by commodity-related sectors as energy and metals benefit from the positive trade developments as well as news Russia and Saudi agreed to extend the OPEC+ agreement, while the JPY-risk dynamic is very much in play for Tokyo trade. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+2.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.5%) outperform on the easing of trade tensions, with sentiment also supported by better than expected Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI and after the CFFEX relaxed domestic stock index futures trading conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD is softer as the US-China trade truce spurred outflows from safe-haven currencies which has underpinned JPY-crosses and benefitted most of the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts. EUR/USD trades firmer with the pair also supported by hopes of a potential Italian budget solution within days, while gains in GBP/USD are somewhat moderated amid ongoing Brexit-related uncertainty with the DUP threatening to abandon support for PM May in a confidence vote if her Brexit deal fails in Parliament. Elsewhere, AUD, NZD and CAD are lifted due to their high-beta statuses and amid a surge in energy prices with WTI crude futures higher by over 5% in the aftermath of the G20 developments and with Canada&rsquo;s Alberta announcing to cut output by 9% amid a supply glut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs initially saw a bout of weakness at the open amid the heightened risk appetite, although prices have since recovered amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 800bln of JGBs with maturities of up to 5yrs.</p>\r\n",
