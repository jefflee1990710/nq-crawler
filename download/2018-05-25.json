        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 25 May 2018: European political woes drive risk-off into the long weekend",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities down, Treasuries up, DXY up, Crude down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Durables headline hit by aircraft, core capex solid; German IFO stabilises; Fedspeak/BOE-speak reveals little.<br />* NEXT WEEK: US nonfarm payrolls, US PCE, Eurozone inflation, BOC rate decision, China PMIs.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUROPEAN POLITCS: </strong>News that Spanish PM Rajoy is facing a confidence vote were added to the list of trader&rsquo;s concerns about the European political climate. Rajoy himself ruled-out snap elections, but may yet face a confidence vote, after socialists PSOE filed a no-confidence motion &ndash; backed by the anti-austerity Podemos party. In Italy, there has been no fresh announcements on cabinet personal, although League sources suggest that they still prefer Eurosceptic Savona for the role of finance minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NORTH KOREA: </strong>After a measured response from North Korea overnight, US President Trump continued to push his carrot-and-stick approach, stating that the North Korean summit could still take place on 12 June, the date that the meeting was initially scheduled for. Trump was encouraged by the &ldquo;very nice statement&rdquo; that North Korea issued overnight, and told reporters that the lines of communications with NK remain open, though suggested he believes NK was playing games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>Mexican economy minister Guajardo does not like the idea of a &#39;skinny&#39; NAFTA deal, and said that negotiations should not be subject to political calendars; he also called for negotiations to be concluded as soon as possible. Guajardo himself sees an 80% chance of completing the deal before the change of Mexican govt in December 2018. He also repeated that it would be easier to reach a NAFTA deal if there were no sunset clause on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FEDSPEAK: </strong>Another day with a lot of Fedspeak, but very little about monetary policy and the economic outlook. Fed chair Powell stayed away from the subject completely. Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan (non-voter, neutral) never seems to leave the wires these days, and Friday reiterated his base case if for an additional two hikes this year contingent on inflation, and remains sceptical that the neutral rate can move higher. Bostic (voter, dovish) is another one that practically lives on the newswires, and Friday repeated his familiar lines about gradual hikes. Fed&rsquo;s Evans (non-voter, dove) said innovation may create headwinds for inflation and was sceptical that the tax policy will allow GDP growth to 3% Speakers also dedicated time to &lsquo;policy framework&rsquo; type comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB SPEAK: </strong>Sources reported that ECB officials are not ruling out tweaks to QE at its June meeting. This came in the context of an earlier source suggesting the ECB policymakers were in unison over ending QE this year, but there was no hint at when the timing of the decision would be. ECB&#39;s Liikanen (Neutral) said that if inflation remains below 2% for an extended period, ECB would also have to tolerate inflation over 2%. ECB&rsquo;s said that by using non-standard policy tools, there could be a long lag in seeing the impact on inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>US Durable Goods (Apr) -1.7% vs. Exp. -1.4% (Prev. 2.6%, Rev. 2.7%). The durable goods headline was hit by aircraft (Boeing&rsquo;s orders in the month were 78 in April vs 197 in March), though core capex was strong; Capital goods orders ex air jumped, however, to the best levels since November. &ldquo;The post-hurricane surge in orders last year could not be sustained, but the inevitable correction is now over and an upward trend is resuming,&rdquo; Pantheon Macroeconomics said, &ldquo;both oil and non-oil capex are set to rise over the next few months, keeping overall capex rising much faster than GDP growth, boosting productivity growth and earnings, while holding down unit labor costs and inflation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: </strong>SPX -0.2% at 2,722, NDX +0.2% at 6,961, DJI -0.2% at 24,751.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +0.2%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.1%, Energy: -2.6%, Financials: -0.4%, Health Care: -0.2%, Industrials: -0.2%, Materials: -0.5%, Telecom: -0.6%, Tech: 0%, Utilities: +0.4%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures were content within their 2730-2740 range, until pre-market news from Spain, Italy as well as OPEC added to a risk-off feel, which the futures complex finally succumbed to. In the pre-market, ES tested the 2715 area, before ranging between 2715-2725 heading into the long weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sectors were mixed on Friday with energy continuing to post losses greater than 3% on the back of plummeting oil prices driven by potential easing of the oil supply curbs by OPEC+. Materials and industrials also posted losses. On the flip side, consumer cyclicals and non-cyclicals held in positive territory, lifted by retailer names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In M&amp;A news, Bayer (BAY GY) has won antitrust approval for Monsanto (MON) with the merger approval likely to be announced by next Tuesday. Earlier today, Bayer said to see synergy effects from the union with Monsanto which would add USD 300mln to the prior estimates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In earnings, Foot Locker (FL) led the S&amp;P and was up by more than 14% after reporting its numbers whereas Gap (GAP) was the worst performer in the index down more than 13% after reporting a miss on EPS. Elsewhere, Autodesk (ADSK) and Ross Stores (ROST) lagged in the NASDAQ with the former cutting its Q2 EPS guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In equity specific stories, BioMarin (BMRN) was at the top of the NASDAQ after US regulators approved a drug for the treatment of a rare metabolic disorder in adults. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) was down 2% after it recalled 4.8mln vehicles in the US due to a software defect and Lockheed martin (LMT) also in the red after the Senate Committee drafted a bill that prevents Turkey from buying F-35 fighter jets from the plane manufacturer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>WTI futures settled $2.83 lower at $67.88/bbl; Brent settled $2.35 lower at $76.44/bbl. Oil continued its descent on Friday and closes out the week lower for the first in May, amid confirmation that OPEC may ease supply cuts to make up for the lost capacity of Venezuela and Iran, with OPEC &amp; Non-OPEC to discuss increasing oil output by around 1mln bpd at its June meeting. Russian Oil Minister Novak noted that oil stocks may have already dropped 5mln barrels below their 5-year average. Later on, Novak also noted that no final decision has yet been taken over easing cuts, and he is convinced there will be a compromise between OPEC members. He believes it is too soon to say how much of the cut supply will be coming back to the market. The Saudi Energy Minister also responded to the proposition, proclaiming that &quot;all options are on the table&quot; and announcing to be certainly prepared for policy adjustments in June. Russia and Saudi Arabia both noted the easing will be gradual, with the former seeing proportional easing for OPEC+ members a fair option and with the latter warning over the impact of Iranian sanctions. Comments also came from the UAE Energy Minister who said the UAE, Saudi and Russia did not discuss parameters of OPEC easing. On the Russian front, President Putin said oil prices at USD 65/bbl suit him whilst Deputy FinMin Oreshkin said the three-year forecast assumed oil prices at USD 60/bbl. The Baker Hughes oil rig count increased this week with firms adding the most rigs in a week and in a month since February (oil rigs +15, gas rigs -2 in the week).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 11+ ticks higher at 119-27+. Treasury yields fell across the curve amid continued uncertainty in Europe around the upsurge of the new populist government in Italy, which sent the spread between 10yr Bunds and BTPS above 200bps, and also on the prospect that Spanish PM Rajoy will likely face a confidence vote. Treasuries caught a bid during European hours as safe haven assets drew demand, and stabilised near session highs as investors squared-up their books ahead of the long weekend in the US/UK. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve with 10yr yields higher by c.5bps, the front end of the curve was higher by c.3bps and the long end by c.4bps. 2s5s and 2s10s narrowed by c.2bps whilst 5s30 and 10s30s widened by c.2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX: </strong>USD: Briefly knocked by this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;dovish&rdquo; FOMC minutes, but the DXY is on course to finish higher for the second week. Much of the greenback&rsquo;s fortunate has come as a result of European factors (EUR and GBP were laggards in the week due to politics and data, respectively). On Friday, the USD was also helped along by weakness in commodity FX, after crude sees out the week in the red; the DXY has generally shrugged-off yields falling back beneath 3.00%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR continues to be gripped by political woes, with the single currency sliding to lows last seen in November, beneath 1.1650, though settled above that level heading into the weekend, stabilised by slightly hawkish ECB sources reports. While the situation in Italy has an end in sight (albeit one that might not be favourable to Eurozone policymakers), political troubles in Spain forced PM Rajoy on Friday to rule out snap elections, after some of his former party members were convicted on corruption charges. These factors, combined with diminishing data surprises has led some desks to talk about a visit of 1.12 area in the medium-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP: Sterling&rsquo;s drop has gone slightly under the radar, most likely due to the more visible EUR woes. The 1.33 level has just about held, but the analyst community expects it is a matter of time before it gives way. Cable has now dropped by about 11 figures since the April highs, and this is prompting some to look for opportunities to get long; one European desk said that there is some topside risk to be realised as a friendlier customs union solution seems to be growing in consensus, and fears of a hard-left government are abating; the desk said it would evaluate longs with GBP around 1.33. There were some late positive ticks above that level after the EU Brexit Negotiator Barnier said his scenario is to reach a realistic Brexit deal; his worst-case scenario is not a no deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY: The EURJPY 127.00 handle is in sight amid the latest bout of EUR weakness; but even against the USD, JPY holds up well going into the weekend with a softer risk tone. There has been focus on the USDJPY 109.20 level &ndash; technicians say a Friday close beneath here would be bearish &ndash; and while the level was breached, prices soon got back above it. Some European desks are looking to fade moves between 109.50-109.80, targeting sub-109.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMFX: Traded soggy vs the greenback on Friday. The ZAR fairs slightly better than other EMFX after South Africa&rsquo;s President Ramaphosa approved a special investigation over unlawful conduct of several government departments. BRL was also performing slightly better in the EMFX space after reports suggested that Senate was nearing a vote on fuel tax; separately, the Brazilian govt reportedly authorised the use of military force, if needed, to end nationwide blockades of highways, sources said. The MXN was actually up against the dollar, after the Mexico economy minister said he was hopeful of a NAFTA deal before the US midterms (it might be &lsquo;skinny&rsquo;). RUB was spanked amid a combination of USD strength and oil prices dropping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NEXT WEEK: </strong>US nonfarm payrolls, US PCE, Eurozone inflation, BOC rate decision, China PMIs. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19260/download\">Click here to read our Week In Focus report.</a></p>\r\n",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Oil continued its descent on Friday and closes out the week lower for the first in May, amid confirmation that OPEC may ease supply cuts to make up for the lost capacity of Venezuela and Iran, with OPEC &amp; Non-OPEC to discuss increasing oil output by around 1mln bpd at its June meeting. Russian Oil Minister Novak noted that oil stocks may have already dropped 5mln barrels below their 5-year average. Later on, Novak also noted that no final decision has yet been taken over easing cuts, and he is convinced there will be a compromise between OPEC members. He believes it is too soon to say how much of the cut supply will be coming back to the market. The Saudi Energy Minister also responded to the proposition, proclaiming that &quot;all options are on the table&quot; and announcing to be certainly prepared for policy adjustments in June. Russia and Saudi Arabia both noted the easing will be gradual, with the former seeing proportional easing for OPEC+ members a fair option and with the latter warning over the impact of Iranian sanctions. Comments also came from the UAE Energy Minister who said the UAE, Saudi and Russia did not discuss parameters of OPEC easing. On the Russian front, President Putin said oil prices at USD 65/bbl suit him whilst Deputy FinMin Oreshkin said the three-year forecast assumed oil prices at USD 60/bbl. The Baker Hughes oil rig count increased this week with firms adding the most rigs in a week and in a month since February (oil rigs +15, gas rigs -2 in the week).</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Political woes grips EUR. The Donald snubs NK and is unhappy with China. TRY battles with Erdogan. Big data week for the UK",
        "content": "<p>This week saw proceedings kick off on a slightly more optimistic footing with the US/China suspension of reciprocal tariffs on each other. However, the optimism slowly turned to pessimism throughout the week after US President Trump stated that he was not happy with how Chinese trade talks have gone thus far. This allied with geopolitical concerns regarding North Korea after Trump cancelled the upcoming summit with North Korea, prompted a FTQ with the JPY the main beneficiary which subsequently dragged USD/JPY briefly below 109.00 after having started the week off above 111.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD was dealt a modest blow by the latest account of the FOMC minutes as markets modestly scaled back their expectations for four rate hikes by the Fed this year with focus on the FOMC&rsquo;s tolerance for an overshoot of 2% inflation. That said, USD losses against its major peers (ex-JPY) proved to be short-lived (USD-index hit highest level since December), particularly against the EUR. This came as soft PMI readings and political woes in the region gripped sentiment and sent the EUR/USD pair to YTD lows after taking out 1.1677 to the downside and then through barriers at 1.1650. On the political front, Italy remained a key focus as the 5SM/League alliance took some more decisive steps towards forming a government after their nominee Conte was given the green light to do so by President Mattarella. However, ministerial appointments remains a sticking point for investors with Eurosceptic Savona touted as the alliance&rsquo;s number one choice. Elsewhere in the periphery, Spain endured its own political turmoil this week as the prospect of snap elections emerged after opposition parties threatened to call a no confidence vote on PM Rajoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will have provided food for thought for ECB policymakers ahead of next month&rsquo;s widely anticipated meeting. However, source reports have offered a slightly more bullish view by suggesting that ECB policymakers are in unison over ending QE in 2018, despite slower growth and Italian political concerns; albeit a decision is yet to be made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what was a data-heavy week for the UK, the GBP remained out of favour as markets continue to question the prospects for BoE rate hikes this year after inflation metrics fell below expectations and GDP figures were not subject to &nbsp;any noteworthy revisions; the probability of an August rate hike stands at just around 27%. GBP/USD remains just north of 1.3300 with focus likely to return to Brexit negotiations with this week unable to once again provide any further clarity on the UK&rsquo;s future trading relationship with the EU with the UK cabinet yet to decide their strategy for the customs union and Irish border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, EM remained a key source of focus, most notably the TRY as markets continue to sell the currency against the USD as fears over central bank autonomy and Erdogan&rsquo;s staunch opposition to higher rates. The pair stopped just short of 5.0 after markets grew wary over inaction from the CBRT before the central bank finally came to the market on Wednesday with a 300bps hike to the lending rate. However, the pair still remains at elevated levels and pared a bulk of the CBRT-inspired sell off in USD/TRY as markets remain cautious over the prospects for domestic rates after the June 24th Turkish election.</p>\r\n",

However, losses for the regional bourses were contained in a similar fashion to their US counterparts after Trump kept the door open for the summit to take place in the future. ASX 200 (-0.2%), Nikkei 225 (Unch.) and KOSPI (-0.1%) all began weaker due to the summit cancellation with South Korea taking the brunt of the news, although the picture somewhat improved as participants digested a more conciliatory tone from North Korea overnight which stated it was still willing to resolve issues with the US, while US and South Korea officials also agreed to create conditions for talks between US and North Korea. In addition, Japanese stocks found some reprieve from a weaker currency, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (-0.2%) were kept subdued amid a lack of drivers and as this week&rsquo;s PBoC liquidity operations resulted to a net drain of CNY 30bln in contrast to the substantial net injection of CNY 410bln last week. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with only minimal support seen amid a cautious-but-improved risk tone in the region, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement for over JPY 1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities also failed to spur demand as the central bank kept all purchase amounts unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross will visit China June 2nd-4th for trade discussions.

North Korea added it is still willing to resolve issues with US whenever and however and that they hoped for issues to be resolved &quot;Trump style&quot;. Furthermore, North Korea stated that the Summit was necessary to resolve current hostile bilateral relationship and that its previous remarks regarding the summit had been in protest against strong US comments, according to reports citing Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan. (KCNA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US and South Korea officials are said to have agreed in phone call to create conditions for talks between US and North Korea. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are mostly positive as the region bucks the trend experienced in Asia and Wall St.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FTSE MIB is underperforming against its peers with banks taking a hit as the Italian Banks Index falls to one-month lows. The energy sector underperforms yet again amid the continuing sell-off in oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of stock specifics, Novartis (+1.4%) is buoyed by an upgrade at Credit Suisse, AstraZeneca (+0.9%) is higher following a positive result from Phase 3 trials and Kingfisher (+4%) after Homebase was sold to Hilco Capital and thus marks an exit of Wesfarmers from the UK market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some negative news for Daimler, as the German motor authority KBA probes suspected emission manipulation in the company with more than 600,000 possibly being recalled. Daimler have refused to comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD resides in modest positive territory (+0.1%) albeit off best levels as the greenback struggles to recoup some of the post-FOMC minutes losses. Subsequently EUR/USD was knocked back below 1.1700 in early trade but failed to make a test of the 2018 low at 1.1677 as the recent pullback in the USD moved back onto a 1.1700 handle. In terms of EZ data, this morning&rsquo;s German IFO release came in slightly ahead of expectations but questions nonetheless remain about the EZ&rsquo;s economic performance with ABN Amro suggesting &lsquo;The combination of ongoing weakness in underlying inflationary pressures and more uncertainty about the economic growth outlook strengthens the case for the ECB to exit at only a very slow pace&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, GBP/USD remains firmly below 1.3400 with GBP softer against its major counterparts in what&rsquo;s been a busy week of tier 1 data for the UK after Wednesday&rsquo;s soft inflation figures and yesterday&rsquo;s upbeat retail report. Today was the turn of GDP which was a key focus for traders after the prelim reading derailed expectations of a May hike by the BoE. However, the GBP failed to gain any notable traction off the figures with the Q/Q and Y/Y readings both unrevised as expected, albeit coupled with lacklustre business investment metrics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/JPY hovers around the 109.50 level and off worst levels as the broadly firmer USD out-muscles the JPY amid touted short-covering and softer than anticipated inflation metrics overnight. Further direction for the pair will likely come from the broader risk-tone which has been a guiding force for the pair throughout the week as trade and geopolitical concerns have prompted a FTQ across the space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAFTA currencies await further updates on the progress of negotiations after reports late yesterday that Mexico made the US an offer in an effort to reach a NAFTA agreement. TRY remains a key focus for markets with the TRY granted some temporary reprieve after the CBRT decided that re-discount credits for earnings from foreign exports can be made in TRY. Scandi currencies, most notably the SEK gained ground on the EUR in early trade after the Swedish Debt office announced is to take a position for a stronger SEK with the aim to reduce costs of central government debt; adding that SEK is weak at the moment but is expected to strengthen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixed income markets trade broadly higher with Bunds taking out yesterday&rsquo;s high at 160.29 to sit just below 160.40. Focus in Europe remains around the ongoing divergence between Italian and German paper with the IT/GE spread now at 200bps as concerns linger about Italy&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU. Although some investors might have been comforted by the fact that Italy is moving ever-closer to forming a government, the composition and ministerial appointments are perhaps less encouraging. The main headache for markets remains the question marks over the Economy Minister position with Eurosceptic Savona still seen as the front-runner for the position. Peripheral markets will also be concerned by developments in Spain amid opposition parties putting forward a motion of no confidence against PM Rajoy amid former aides to the PM being convicted of a corruption racket under his tenure. UK Gilts remain little-fazed by the UK GDP data but eye May 4th highs seen at 122.94.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is set to close the week in the red for the first time this month as both WTI and Brent are negative for the day at USD 69.31 and USD 76.95 respectively. This comes amid confirmation of a potential easing of supply cuts by OPEC to make up for the lost capacity of Venezuela and Iran with Russian Oil Minister Novak stating that all proposals will be discussed in June when asked about possible oil production increase by 1mln bpd. In addition to this the Saudi Energy Minister said they are certainly prepared to adjust policy in June, and release of supply will be gradual, adding that there is likely to be an oil supply boost in the second half of 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, SocGen have revised their oil forecast higher for Q4 2018 with Brent revised to USD 78/bbl (+USD 14) and WTI revised to USD 73/bbl (+USD 13).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is currently trading flat as safe haven demand softens the blow of profit taking heading into the weekend. Steel strengthening as concerns over demand diminish alongside declining inventories. Copper and nickel also rising, with nickel hitting near 3 year highs, spurred on by increasing base metals prices.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "EU MID SESSION UPDATE: Italian/German spread continues to widen. UK GDP in line, EURSEK slides as Swedish debt agency comments on SEK strengthening",
        "content": "<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are mostly positive as the region bucks the trend experienced in Asia and Wall St.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FTSE MIB is underperforming against its peers with banks taking a hit as the Italian Banks Index falls to one-month lows. The energy sector underperforms yet again amid the continuing sell-off in oil prices. In terms of stock specifics, Novartis (+1.4%) is buoyed by an upgrade at Credit Suisse, AstraZeneca (+0.9%) is higher following a positive result from Phase 3 trials and Kingfisher (+4%) after Homebase was sold to Hilco Capital and thus marks an exit of Wesfarmers from the UK market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD resides in modest positive territory (+0.1%) albeit off best levels as the greenback struggles to recoup some of the post-FOMC minutes losses. Subsequently EUR/USD was knocked back below 1.1700 in early trade but failed to make a test of the 2018 low at 1.1677 as the recent pullback in the USD moved back onto a 1.1700 handle. In terms of EZ data, this morning&rsquo;s German IFO release came in slightly ahead of expectations but questions nonetheless remain about the EZ&rsquo;s economic performance with ABN Amro suggesting &lsquo;The combination of ongoing weakness in underlying inflationary pressures and more uncertainty about the economic growth outlook strengthens the case for the ECB to exit at only a very slow pace&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, GBP/USD remains firmly below 1.3400 with GBP softer against its major counterparts in what&rsquo;s been a busy week of tier 1 data for the UK after Wednesday&rsquo;s soft inflation figures and yesterday&rsquo;s upbeat retail report. Today was the turn of GDP which was a key focus for traders after the prelim reading derailed expectations of a May hike by the BoE. However, the GBP failed to gain any notable traction off the figures with the Q/Q and Y/Y readings both unrevised as expected, albeit coupled with lacklustre business investment metrics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For USD/JPY, the pair trades just north of the 109.50 level and off worst levels as the broadly firmer USD out-muscles the JPY amid touted short-covering and softer than anticipated inflation metrics overnight. Further direction for the pair will likely come from the broader risk-tone which has been a guiding force for the pair throughout the week as trade and geopolitical concerns have prompted a FTQ across the space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAFTA currencies await further updates on the progress of negotiations after reports late yesterday&nbsp; that Mexico made the US an offer in an effort to reach a NAFTA agreement. TRY remains a key focus for markets with the TRY granted some temporary reprieve after the CBRT decided that re-discount credits for earnings from foreign exports can be made in TRY. Scandi currencies, most notably the SEK gained ground on the EUR in early trade after the Swedish Debt office announced is to take a position for a stronger SEK with the aim to reduce costs of central government debt; adding that SEK is weak at the moment but is expected to strengthen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixed income markets trade broadly higher with Bunds taking out yesterday&rsquo;s high at 160.29 to sit just below 160.40. Focus in Europe remains around the ongoing divergence between Italian and German paper with the IT/GE spread now at 200bps as concerns linger about Italy&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU. Although some investors might have been comforted by the fact that Italy is moving ever-closer to forming a government, the composition and ministerial appointments are perhaps less encouraging. The main headache for markets remains the question marks over the Economy Minister position with Eurosceptic Savona still seen as the front-runner for the position. Peripheral markets will also be concerned by developments in Spain amid opposition parties putting forward a motion of no confidence against PM Rajoy amid former aides to the PM being convicted of a corruption racket under his tenure. UK Gilts remain little-fazed by the UK GDP data but eye May 4th highs seen at 122.94.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is set to close the week in the red for the first time this month as both WTI and Brent are negative for the day at USD 70.25 and USD 77.99 respectively. This comes amid murmurs of a potential easing of supply cuts by OPEC to make up for the lost capacity of Venezuela and Iran with Russian Oil Minister Novak stating that all proposals will be discussed in June when asked about possible oil production increase by 1mln bpd. Furthermore, SocGen have revised their oil forecast higher for Q4 2018 with Brent revised to USD 78/bbl (+USD 14) and WTI revised to USD 73/bbl (+USD 13).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is currently trading flat as safe haven demand softens the blow of profit taking heading into the weekend. Steel strengthening as concerns over demand diminish alongside declining inventories. Copper and nickel also rising, with nickel hitting near 3 year highs, spurred on by increasing base metals prices.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stock markets traded cautiously as the region reacted to US President Trump&rsquo;s cancellation of the summit with North Korea. However, losses for the regional bourses were contained in a similar fashion to their US counterparts after Trump kept the door open for the summit to take place in the future. ASX 200 (-0.2%), Nikkei 225 (Unch.) and KOSPI (-0.1%) all began weaker due to the summit cancellation with South Korea taking the brunt of the news, although the picture somewhat improved as participants digested a more conciliatory tone from North Korea overnight which stated it was still willing to resolve issues with the US, while US and South Korea officials also agreed to create conditions for talks between US and North Korea. In addition, Japanese stocks found some reprieve from a weaker currency, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (-0.2%) were kept subdued amid a lack of drivers and as this week&rsquo;s PBoC liquidity operations resulted to a net drain of CNY 30bln in contrast to the substantial net injection of JPY 410bln last week. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with only minimal support seen amid a cautious-but-improved risk tone in the region, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement for over JPY 1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities also failed to spur demand as the central bank kept all purchase amounts unchanged. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stock markets trade cautiously as region reacts to US President Trump&rsquo;s cancellation of the summit with North Korea. However, downside for regional bourses have been contained in a similar fashion to their US counterparts after Trump later suggested that the door was open for the summit to take place in the future. ASX 200 (-0.1%), Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) and KOSPI (-0.1%) were all initially weaker due to the summit cancellation with South Korea taking the brunt of the news, although the picture has improved since as participants digest a more conciliatory tone from North Korea overnight which stated it was still willing to resolve issues with the US, while US and South Korea officials have also agreed to create conditions for talks between US and North Korea. In addition, Japanese stocks found some reprieve from a weaker currency, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.5%) are subdued amid a lack of drivers and as this week&rsquo;s PBoC liquidity operations resulted to a net drain of CNY 30bln in contrast to the considerable net injection of JPY 410bln last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively quiet amid a sparse overnight data calendar, although the greenback is slightly firmer with the DXY approaching the 94.00 level as it recovers the lost ground from this week&rsquo;s dovish-leaning FOMC minutes. This has weighed on its major counterparts across the pond with GBP/USD languishing firmly below the 1.3400 handle and with EUR/USD eyeing 1.1700 to the downside. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are higher on short-covering from the recent declines and a slight improvement of the risk tone, with softer than expected Tokyo CPI data as well as Gotobi demand suggested to be some of the factors at play. MXN also remains firm overnight with support seen in late US trade on reports that Mexico made the US an offer in an effort to reach a NAFTA agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with only minimal support seen amid a cautious-but-improved risk tone in the region, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement for over JPY 1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities also failed to spur demand with the central bank keeping its purchase amounts unchanged. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
