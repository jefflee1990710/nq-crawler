(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US official said they are pushing allies to cut oil imports from Iran to zero by 4th November and said they do not plan to offer Iran any oil import waivers. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gabon oil workers are planning a 15-day strike at Total facilities which will commence on Sunday if they do not receive salary increases or new bonuses, or if there is no reduction of foreign employees.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, neutral) said Fed policy is still accommodative and that he still sees the neutral rate between 2.5%-2.75%, while he also stated that a flattening yield curve can impact behaviour of business. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House voted 400 vs. 2 in favour of passing bill to tighten oversight of US foreign investment due to concern over China. In related news, there were earlier reports that US President Trump suggested he would back down from his demand for new tight restrictions on Chinese investments into technology and instead rely on the bill for tighter investment oversight which is going through Congress.

In terms of earnings, Lennar (LEN) beat on both top and bottom lines, and reported new home orders were higher by 62%; the stock gained as much as 10% in Tuesday trade. IHS Markit (INFO) also reported figures which also beat on both top and bottom line and saw gains of as much as 4%. Elsewhere, General Electric is to spin-off its healthcare unit by selling 20% of it, and giving the rest to shareholders; it is also set to unload its ownership in Baker Hughes (BHGE) so it can focus on power, aviation and renewable energy. GE was up by as much as 8%. M&amp;A news was relatively light on Tuesday, however in hours, Fox (FOXA) said regulatory concerns may delay or derail the bid from Comcast (CMCSA). CNBC said that Conagra Brands (CAG) are said to be nearing a deal for Pinnacle Foods (PF), but the sources did state the deal could still fall apart. SPX +0.22%, NASDAQ 100 +0.43%, DJIA +0.12%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was very little movement in yields across the curve, and the TPLEX has been trading within a very narrow range, despite the so-called concerns over trade wars and this week&rsquo;s bumper supply. The US Treasury&rsquo;s auction of 2yr notes saw a small tail of 0.2bps, though the high-yield rate slipped for the first time in nine months. Internals were lacklustre, with cover falling slightly, while dealer participation was again slightly higher. US 10YR T-notes futures (Sep 2018) 1 ticks lower at 120-00.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 26 June 2018: Trade concerns abate",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities up, Treasuries flat, DXY up, Crude up.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Trade fears abate; US consumer confidence slips; ECB VP toes the line; BOE new boy cautious on rates.<br />* AHEAD: Fedspeak (Quarles, Rosengren); BOC&rsquo;s Poloz; RBNZ; DOE inventories; Durable goods; US 5-year auction, 2-year FRN.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump said the US is finishing its study on tariffs of auto imports from the EU (which has apparently &ldquo;long taken advantage of the US in the form of trade barriers and tariffs&rdquo;), and said &ldquo;in the end, it will all even out &ndash; and won&rsquo;t take very long&rdquo;. Elsewhere, Trump said he is getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers &ldquo;that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies,&rdquo; adding that countries must play fair &ldquo;or they will pay tariffs!&quot; White House Economic Advisor Hassett said that the US has a good chance of winning lower Chinese and EU tariffs; he added that rising US deficits are due to higher spending, not tax cuts. In late trade, there were positive ticks (again) after the WSJ reported that Trump had suggested he will ease demand for new restrictions on Chinese technology investments, and instead rely on an updated security review log.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED SPEAK: </strong>Fed&#39;s Bostic (voter) said the Fed is trying to keep the economy on a stable, sustainable path. He noted that trade is causing uncertainty and has made him think that risks to the economy are to the downside; Bostic says he sees only one further rate hike in 2018 (NOTE: Fed dots have pencilled in two further rate rises). Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan (non-voter) expects 2.75% growth this year partly because of the tax cuts, but he does expect growth to slow down next year. On the labour market, Kaplan does not see a lot of slack remaining in the economy. And on trade, Kaplan said he is concerned by anything which would create an impediment to modernising NAFTA, though he said that confronting the threat from China is appropriate. Meanwhile, Kaplan reiterated his view that the neutral rate is somewhere between 2.5% and 2.75%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE SPEAK: </strong>BOE&rsquo;s Haskel (who will replace the outgoing hawk Ian McCafferty, taking his place on the MPC in September) gave a balanced set of comments, arguing that opportunities for adjusting rates appear to be growing, adding that he agrees with the &quot;broad direction of travel&quot; on BoE guidance on interest rates; He says the BoE needs to think about intangible assets when judging the speed at which rates might need to be raised. Haskel says the effect of Brexit on the UK economy is &quot;very uncertain&quot;, MPC should keep a very close eye on development though predicting a subdued outlook for UK consumer spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB SPEAK: </strong>The ECB&rsquo;s new Vice President de Guindos largely toed the central bank&rsquo;s line, arguing that the fundamentals are still in place for continued solid, broad-based growth, and he sees a sustained convergence towards inflation goal is set to continue; he added that the benign market reaction following the ECB&rsquo;s latest announcement supports the appropriateness of its assessment on the outlook. Elsewhere. ECB&rsquo;s Hansson (generally hawkish) reiterated that policy will remain expansionary. ECB&rsquo;s Lane (dovish) said inflation is recovering, but it is still far below target, though he added that he is confident that policy is working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>US consumer confidence slipped in June, missing expectations, with the headline falling to 126.4 from a revised up 128.8. The expectations component slid by 4 points to a four-month low, while the differential between &quot;jobs plentiful&quot; and &quot;jobs hard to get&quot; narrows to 25.1 (previously 26.6). &ldquo;Expectations are sensitive to gas prices and the stock market, so this decline is easy to understand; at this point there&#39;s no reason to expect a sustained decline unless the ongoing trade disputes trigger a meaningful correction in stock prices,&rdquo; Pantheon Macroeconomics noted. The consultancy believes that confidence remains very high, though spending cannot keep up due to relatively slow real earnings growth. It also notes that 12-month inflation expectations were unchanged, after rising two tenths in May, &ldquo;but the trend remains broadly flat, and lower than implied by the current inflation rate,&rdquo; it adds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU Leaders have left the door open to the UK to change their &quot;red lines&quot; in Brexit negotiations, according to draft summit conclusions. Later, the Spanish Foreign Minister says Germany, France and Spain will block any UK bid to join the single market. Elsewhere, UK PM May has bvowed to listen to businesses over Brexit, following this week&rsquo;s warnings from European-based companies about the troubles in planning amid Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.22%, NASDAQ 100 +0.43%, DJI &nbsp;+0.12%.</strong> SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +0.68%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.45%, Energy: +1.40%, Financials: -0.37%, Health Care:&nbsp; &nbsp;-0.28%, Industrials: +0.33%, Materials: +0.36%, Telecoms: -0.42%, Tech: +0.48%, Utilities: -0.01%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>US equity futures were stable overnight amid a lack of trade updates, and consolidated around the 50dma 2720 on the Emini. There was a bid after the cash open, and the contract drifted higher throughout the session with newswires attributing today&rsquo;s gains to a &lsquo;recovery&rsquo; after yesterday&rsquo;s sharp sell-off on the back of global trade tensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Lennar (LEN) beat on both top and bottom lines, and reported new home orders were higher by 62%; the stock gained as much as 10% in Tuesday trade. IHS Markit (INFO) also reported figures which also beat on both top and bottom line and saw gains of as much as 4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>General Electric is to spin-off its healthcare unit by selling 20% of it, and giving the rest to shareholders; it is also set to unload its ownership in Baker Hughes (BHGE) so it can focus on power, aviation and renewable energy. GE was up by as much as 8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>M&amp;A news was relatively light on Tuesday, however in hours, Fox (FOXA) said regulatory concerns may delay or derail the bid from Comcast (CMCSA). CNBC said that Conagra Brands (CAG) are said to be nearing a deal for Pinnacle Foods (PF), but the sources did state the deal could still fall apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) 1 TICKS LOWER AT 120-00. </strong>There was very little movement in yields across the curve, and the TPLEX has been trading within a very narrow range, despite the so-called concerns over trade wars and this week&rsquo;s bumper supply. The US Treasury&rsquo;s auction of 2yr notes saw a small tail of 0.2bps, though the high-yield rate slipped for the first time in nine months. Internals were lacklustre, with cover falling slightly, while dealer participation was again slightly higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 5-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>This week, the US Treasury will auction USD 116bln in 2s, 5s, 7s, and a 2yr FRN; net supply is implied at around USD 52bln. Recent auctions in the 5-year sector have been taken-down without much fanfare, though last month&rsquo;s foreign takedown was weak, at just under 8%, which some desks believe will see foreigners returning to the fold this month. Analysts at Societe Generale hold a negative bias going into the auction, arguing that the sector has richened on both an outright basis and on the curve, with the yields on benchmark 5s trading beneath the previous two auction stop-outs rates; SocGen also argues that current 5 trades rich on the curve versus 2s and 10s. With that said, the bank says that lower dealer positioning &ndash; which has seen dealers cut holdings in the 3-6 year bucket to the lowest since early May &ndash; is a positive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Q8) SETTLES $2.45 HIGHER AT $70.53/BBL; BRENT (Q8) SETTLES $1.58 HIGHER AT $76.31/BBL. </strong>Uncertainty regarding Libyan output helped support crude prices, after Monday&rsquo;s news that a rebel leader Hafter handed control of Eastern oil fields to the &lsquo;Eastern&rsquo; Benghazi-based NOC, which competes with the official, Tripoli-based National Oil Company; a Tripoli-booked tanker loaded at Hariga without incident on Tuesday, helping to alleviate some concerns. However, the situation in Canada is keeping concerns about global supplies alive, as the market awaits an update on Syncrude Canada, after a 350k BPD oil sands upgrader was shuttered after a transformer blew up on 20 June; the company is still evaluating whether it will resume production before the current end-July guidance. Crude came under some pressure in the European afternoon, after sources reports suggested that Saudi Arabia is planning a record oil output of 10.8mln BPD, but perhaps as high as 11mln BPD, during July, and some additional output will be put into global storage. With regards to Iran, a US official said it is pushing allies to cut oil imports from Iran to zero, and stated that the US is not planning to offer Iran any oil import waivers. Iraq PM Abadi says they will carry on working with OPEC+ members to maintain a stable oil price and prevent further price hikes, and has presented proposals to OPEC to help. Gabon oil workers are planning a 15 day strike at Total facilities which will commence on Sunday if they do not receive salary increases or new bonuses, or if there is no reduction of foreign employees. After market, the API will report energy inventories for the week, and the Street expect crude stocks to draw down by 2.6mln barrels, stocks at Cushing are seen drawing 2.25mln barrels, gasoline is seen building 1.3mln, while distillates are seen building by 800k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Mounting concerns over trade wars have reportedly led to traders unwinding bets on high-yielding FX like the AUD, NZD and CAD, seeing the greenback snap a four day losing run. There wasn&rsquo;t a lot of new information that advanced the story, traders were expressing uncertainty about how future actions could change the landscape, ahead of Friday&rsquo;s reported announcement from the US over investment restrictions in US entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency largely shrugged-off comments from new ECB Vice President de Guindos that essentially underlined the central bank&rsquo;s June policy guidance, but meeting more chart resistance above 1.1720 and a Fib to retreat through 1.1700 where a band of big option expiries run off tomorrow (3 bn from 1.1650-90).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Cable couldn&rsquo;t reclaim 1.33, though did bounce from sub-1.32 ahead of this week&rsquo;s EU Summit where no major breakthroughs are expected on Brexit; The EU today extended its carrot and stick approach again, saying that there is scope for the UK to revise its &lsquo;red-lines&rsquo;, though there remains opposition from within the EU on allowing the UK access to the single market. Additionally, traders were citing comments from BOE new boy Haskel &ndash; who expressed a degree of caution on rates &ndash; as a reason for downside, though, in aggregate, his comments were balanced. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Although Australia doesn&rsquo;t have direct trade conflicts with the US, as a proxy to China, it is vulnerable, as seen in Tuesday trade. The Aussie was also weighed on by the slide in copper prices, which hit a fresh three-month low; zinc prices, meanwhile, are lingering at 10-month lows. Aside from its proxy to China, traders will eye comments from the RBA next week, where it is expected to keep rates unchanged. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

TD Securities notes that with USD 64.3bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is implied at USD 51.7bln. The bank also expected the Treasury to announce a further increase in auction sizes in the coming months, continuing to cheapen front-end Treasuries vs OIS. The 2s auction may be supported by the relative stability in Fed hike expectations, along with renewed fears about global trade wars. Recent auctions in the 2-year sector have been well received, with last month&rsquo;s sale seeing the largest stop-through since July 2017, and means that over the last six auctions, the stop-out rate has come in on the screws. However, although direct bidders&rsquo; participation has been fairly stable, dealer takedown has been nudging up, while indirect participation has been edging down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The Kiwi also lost more ground vs the AUD even though the latter is losing grip of the 0.7400 handle vs its US peer, as the cross maintained 1.0750+ status and commodity currencies overall was undermined by weakness in underlying prices and global tariff tensions, albeit under the surface for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Tuesday&rsquo;s session circa 0.25-0.35% down vs the Dollar, with the single currency largely shrugging off comments from new ECB VP De Guindos that essentially underlined June policy guidance, but meeting more chart resistance above 1.1720 and a Fib to retreat through 1.1700 where a band of big option expiries run off tomorrow (3 bn from 1.1650-90). Cable also had Central Bank rhetoric to digest and technical challenges to contend with, falling just shy of 1.3300 and the 21 DMA (1.3308) to revisit the low 1.3200 area before rebounding towards a 1.1 bn expiry at the 1.3250 strike close to the NY cut. Back to the BoE, resident hawk McCafferty highlighted his dissent with a don&rsquo;t dally on hiking message, but his replacement from September, Haskel, gave little sign that he will pick up the tightening mantle given mixed views during his TSC appearance &ndash; ranging from the case for further policy normalisation has improved to there may be more slack in the economy to delay the next rise. Elsewhere, the Franc remained relatively side-lined and rangy, albeit easing within a 0.9855-0.9915 band vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both choppy, but also within pretty well defined recent parameters, as the Loonie looked either side of 1.3300 ahead of the latest BoC outlook on Wednesday that could provide more clues about the outcome of next month&rsquo;s policy convene after some shifts to a less cautious stance last time. The Jpy lost a bit of safe haven allure as the headline pair ticked up towards 110.00 again following the latest reversal through 109.50, but failure to breach support at the 55 DMA (109.39). However, the upside still faces obstacles between 110.00-110.25 and mega option expiry interest lurks from tomorrow through Thursday (some 8 bn at 109.00, 109.50 and 110.00).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Peso derived a degree of support ahead of Sunday&rsquo;s Mexican election as Presidential front-runner Obrado pledged to boost investor confidence and prompted more short covering, with Usd/Mxn consolidating its reversal under 20.0000.</p>\r\n",

This was also exacerbated after Treasury Secretary Mnuchin suggested this was not just specific to China but to all countries trying to steal US technology, which raised fears of widespread action and saw the tech sector bear the brunt of the increased protectionist views. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (flat) traded lower with losses in Australia led by commodity related sectors amid trade uncertainty and OPEC+ overhang, while a firmer JPY weighed on the Japanese benchmark. Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) underperformed their peers with China dampened by trade tensions, as well as a net liquidity drain by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with prices stuck within Monday&rsquo;s tight range and after the 20yr auction failed to spur demand despite firmer results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day reverse repos for a net daily drain of CNY 90bln, but stated that banking system liquidity will improve in the approaching few days.

He said that its perhaps somewhat more optimistic on productivity growth than the BoE and NIESR view, while agreeing with the &ldquo;broad direction of travel&rdquo; on the BoE&rsquo;s guidance on interest rates. Haskel adds there may be more much more slack in the economy than we think; more slack would weaken case for rate hikes and expects wage pressures to be relatively weak.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities take a breather (Eurostoxx 50 +0.2%) as the major bourses crawl back up from the sell-off experienced in the previous session as US Trade Advisor Navarro provided relief to markets when he stated the US has no plans to impose investment restrictions (but will defend itself against threats). The sectors which experienced the heaviest losses yesterday rebound today with materials, oil and tech names recovering while utilities outperforms.&nbsp; In stocks specifics, Eutelsat (+2.4%) said they do not intend to make an offer for London-based Inmarsat (-9.3%) following reports yesterday the French company was considering a possible bid for Inmarsat. Elsewhere, BMW&rsquo;s (-1.3%) special representative Robertson said the company is not looking to actively relocate production out of the UK amid reports plants would have to be closed post-Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - Major pairings remain relatively choppy and rangy, but the Greenback has regrouped after Monday&rsquo;s US-China trade related downturn to trade firmer vs most G10 peers bar the Jpy (again). Hence, the DXY has nudged back above 94.400 from a marginal new pull-back low just under 94.200, awaiting more tariff and investment news in the absence of anything else market moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - As noted, still outperforming or resilient amidst latest global protectionist posturing, with 110.00 proving a formidable barrier and 109.50 protecting a deeper retracement and the 55 DMA at 109.39, all vs the Dollar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The weakest link, and perhaps acknowledging neutral to dovish expectations for Wednesday&rsquo;s RBNZ policy meeting after the NZIER&rsquo;s shadow rate-setters backed no change in the OCR. The Kiwi is losing further traction from 0.6900 vs its US counterpart and ground against its antipodean rival as the AUD cross climbs back above 1.0750 and Aud/Usd attempts to form a base above 0.7400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - Both holding decent recovery gains vs the Usd from recent lows, but struggling to rebound further through big figure levels (1.1700 and 1.3300 respectively) that are in close proximity to technical resistance (ie 1.1721 Fib and 1.3308 DMA), and with hefty option expiries also in the mix (3 bn in Eur/Usd between 1.1650-90 tomorrow and 1.1 bn in Cable at 1.3250 today). Note also, the Eur/Gbp cross continues to respect its 200 DMA around 0.8821 and is hovering near 0.8800 amidst comments from pending member of the BoE&rsquo;s MPC Haskel that featured some hawkish elements initially before turning more mainstream as his TSC interview went on, but do not indicate that he will directly replace rate hike advocate McCafferty when he joins. In fact, the Pound has lost momentum even though the latter has underlined his stance with another call for no further delay on more tightening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF - Sticking to relatively tight lines vs the Greenback around 1.3300 and just under 0.9900, with the Loonie awaiting Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC outlook for some independent impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been gradual, but steady and pretty rational given another slide in Italian BTPs (10 year future sub-125.00), increasingly dovish views from soon to be BoE policy-setter Haskel (carrying extra weight as a replacement for hawk McCafferty) and for Gilts a solid DMO auction. Subsequently, core bonds have whittled away losses with Bunds and Gilts briefly into positive territory at 162.35 and 123.01 respectively (both +12 ticks and +15 ticks vs -48 and -29 ticks at one stage), while the 3 month UK STIR strip has flipped to between flat and I tick ahead. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are also off overnight lows with the curve fractionally steeper even though the first of this week&rsquo;s hefty supply arrives at the short end via Usd34 bn 2 year notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are relatively mixed with WTI (-0.1%) erasing earlier gains and Brent (+0.2%) higher as oil is supported from limited Libyan crude exports in June compared to May after oil exporting facilities seem to be removed out of the control of Libya&rsquo;s NOC (the only entity permitted to sell the country&rsquo;s crude oil). Elsewhere, in Canada, 360k bpd of production capacity has gone offline due to production issues at the Syncrude faciliy in Alberta, one of the largest oil sands facilities in the country. The outage is expected to tighten supplies in and potentially reduce flows into the Cushing, OK, hub. Production is not expected to return until through July. Meanwhile, the Iranian Oil Minister said that the OPEC agreement did not contain some increases members expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metals on the other hand are lower on the day with gold (-0.7%), silver (-0.6%) and platinum (-0.6%) pressured by the firmer dollar. Copper dipped to near its weakest level in almost 3 months as risk appetite is dampened by the ongoing US-Sino trade tensions. Zinc fell to the lowest since early August 2017 as rising inventories subdue the metal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CME raised NYMEX crude oil future margins for August to USD 2750 per contract from USD 2550 and raised gasoline futures maintenance margins for September to USD 3200 per contract from USD 3100 per contract.

Subsequently, core bonds have whittled away losses with Bunds and Gilts briefly into positive territory at 162.27 and 122.90 respectively (both +4 ticks vs -48 and -29 ticks at one stage), while the 3 month UK STIR strip has flipped to between flat and I tick ahead. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are also off overnight lows with the curve fractionally steeper even though the first of this week&rsquo;s hefty supply arrives at the short end via Usd34 bn 2 year notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are relatively mixed with WTI (+0.2%) and Brent (+0.3%) higher as oil is supported from limited Libyan crude exports in June compared to May after oil exporting facilities seem to be removed out of the control of Libya&rsquo;s NOC (the only entity permitted to sell the country&rsquo;s crude oil). Elsewhere, in Canada, 360k bpd of production capacity has gone offline due to production issues at the Syncrude faciliy in Alberta, one of the largest oil sands facilities in the country. The outage is expected to tighten supplies in and potentially reduce flows into the Cushing, OK, hub. Production is not expected to return until through July. Meanwhile, the Iranian Oil Minister said that the OPEC agreement did not contain some increases members expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metals on the other hand are lower on the day with gold (-0.8%), silver (-0.7%) and platinum (-0.9%) pressured by the firmer dollar. Copper dipped to near its weakest level in almost 3 months as risk appetite is dampened by the ongoing US-Sino trade tensions. Zinc fell to the lowest since early August 2017 as rising inventories subdue the metal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) underperformed their peers with China dampened by trade tensions, as well as a net liquidity drain by the PBoC.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were quiet overnight alongside a lack of tier-1 data, which kept the DXY near lows seen during US trade amid concerns regarding Trump trade policies. As such, EUR/USD marginally extended above 1.1700 and GBP/USD continued to eye the 1.3300 handle to the upside, while AUD/USD remained subdued on recent commodity pressure. Elsewhere, the risk averse tone spurred flows into JPY in which USD/JPY and JPY-crosses fully reversed an earlier aggressive spike that had been triggered by comments from White House Trade Advisor Navarro which provided momentary relief as he stated the US has no plans to impose investment restrictions but will defend itself against threats.

Elsewhere, gold resumed its descent from the USD 1300/oz level and copper saw some mild short covering, although trade tensions between the world&rsquo;s 2 largest economies and weakness in Chinese commodities overnight kept prices of the red metal near 3-month lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CME raised NYMEX crude oil future margins for August to USD 2750 per contract from USD 2550 and raised gasoline futures maintenance margins for September to USD 3200 per contract from USD 3100 per contract.
