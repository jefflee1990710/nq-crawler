Yemini rebels were once again reported to have been firing missiles at Saudi Aramco facilities. The crude complex started out the week in quiet fashion in the APAC session, with the bias towards selling after weekend news from the UAE, where the energy minister said that OPEC (Saudi, Kuwait and UEA) has the capacity to plug any gaps in production caused by Iran sanctions. Analysts have been considering how many barrels will be taken-off the market, and the range of estimates is wide &ndash; some believe it could be minimal, while others like the BP Boss Dudley suggest it could be as high as 1mln BPD. Also over the weekend, US National Security Advisor Bolton threatened European companies and nations who continue to do business with Iran could be hit with US sanctions.

On Monday, OPEC&rsquo;s monthly report intimated that the global oil glut is nearly over; crude production rose 12k bpd in April to average 31.93mln bpd, according to secondary sources; higher production in Saudi Arabia and Algeria was partially offset by decreased crude oil production, mainly in Venezuela, Gabon and Nigeria. OPEC also said that 2018 oil demand growth is forecast to increase by around 1.65 mb/d to average 98.85 mln bpd, while OECD commercial stocks declined in March, leaving the surplus just 9mln barrels above its five-year average.

However, as the US cash market opened futures caught a further bid, but it was short-lived, and the Emini struggled to make ground above 2740, after which futures then fell gradually throughout the rest of the session to relatively flat levels by the market close, though the trading range and volumes were thinnish. In M&amp;A news, Xerox (XRX) announced it had ended its $6.1bln deal with Fujifilm in a settlement with two of its largest shareholders, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, which saw the stock hit intraday low of ~9% before paring back some of the losses as trade progressed to the close.

Others attributed the selling action to a deep pipeline of investment grade debt, with the likes of Keurig launching an $8bln six-part M&amp;A bond sale to finance it&#39;s Dr Pepper M&amp;A. Most of the Treasury action was concentrated in the belly of the curve, with 5yr and 10yr yields higher by c.2bps at settlement. Although some steepening was seen across the complex heading into the close, 5s30s spread was only just off cyclical lows, steepening by c.1bp, while 2s10, 2s30s steeper by around 2bps.

        "content": "<ul><li>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities slightly higher, Treasuries flat, DXY up, Crude up</li>\r\n  <li>* REAR-VIEW: Ross on trade, Italy working on a government, Fed and ECB speak, OPEC monthly report</li>\r\n  <li>* AHEAD: RBA Minutes overnight, UK Labour Market Data (Tues), German ZEW (Tues), EZ GDP (Tues), US Retail Sales (Tues), Home Depot reports numbers on Tues.</li>\r\n  <li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>* TRADE: US Commerce Secretary Ross largely reiterated the Trump administration hard line views, arguing that not all trade deficits are the same, and said &lsquo;artificial deficits&rsquo; are &lsquo;blameful and shameful&rsquo;. Ross added that China hasn&rsquo;t complied with WTO rules since joining the organisation, and he again accused the country of stealing intellectual property and forcing technology transfers. Ross blamed China and Europe of being &lsquo;highly protectionist&rsquo; countries, warning that China&rsquo;s agricultural tariffs will come at its own cost, and the impact on the US economy would be minimal. He also noted that the distance between US and China positions on trade remain some distance apart. He also commented on the ZTE story, noting his department sees it as an &ldquo;enforcement action&rdquo; which remains separate from &ldquo;trade action.&rdquo; Finally, on NAFTA, key topics remain a &ldquo;work in progress.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* ITALIAN POLITICS: Italy President Mattarella held formation talks with the 5 Star Movement &nbsp;and with the League on Monday. After significant progress was made over the weekend, the two parties have reached an agreement on measures including universal basic income, a flat tax and roll back of pension reforms, although uncertainty still remains on the new PM and new cabinet members. Italian Economist Sapelli (proposed by the League) is no longer running for the PM role, leaving Conte (proposed by the 5SM) a more likely candidate for the position, some suggest. League&rsquo;s leader Salvini later in the day that work is still needed on a government plan, noting that there was still no deal on government issues. Italy&#39;s President has given more time to the two parties to work out a deal, and has not set any deadlines. Italy&rsquo;s League is set to hold informal referendum on 19-20 May for its members to approve an eventual government deal with 5-Star Movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* FED SPEAK: Fed&#39;s Mester (Voter, Hawk) does not expect inflation to pick up sharply and she supports gradual rise in US interest rates. Mester does not think rates will be hiked beyond 3% in the &lsquo;near future&rsquo;. Fed&#39;s Bullard (Non-Voter, Dove) said the Dollar is in great shape and is a long-term winner, and elsewhere repeated his concerns on possible yield curve inversion, warning that the Fed should not raise rates aggressively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*ECB SPEAK: ECB&rsquo;s Villeroy (Dovish) noted the end of net asset purchases is nearing, but whether this is in September or December is not an existential question. Underlying inflation has temporarily slowed down, but it is set to strengthen irrespective of short-run fluctuations in energy inflation.&nbsp; Communication will be adjusted given current rate guidance is conditioned on the end of net asset purchases, Villeroy said, and it could give additional guidance on timing of rate hike &ndash; he tilted positively his tone noting that &quot;well past&quot; seeming some quarters rather than years. ECB&rsquo;s Lautenschlager (Hawk) expressed confidence in underlying inflation trends, adding the Eurozone economy is still within ECB projections. Incoming ECB member Rehn said short term indicators suggest the pace of growth has somewhat cooled in the early months of this year, arguing that this could be temporary, but data is signalling a slowdown in growth. Overall, however, the economic outlook for the Euro area is strong, however. (Note: Rehn is to take Liikanen&#39;s position on the ECB&#39;s Governing Council in July).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EQUITIES: SPX +0.09% at 2730, NDX +0.17% at 6964, DJI +0.29% at 24902.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS:&nbsp;Cons Cyclicals: +0.11%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.17%, Energy: +0.56%, Financials: -0.09%, Health Care: +0.46%, Industrials: -0.19%, Materials: +0.28%, Technology: +0.07%, Telecoms: -0.44%, Utilities: -0.62%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Equity futures traded higher overnight, slightly building on Friday&rsquo;s gains. However, as the US cash market opened futures caught a further bid, but it was short-lived, and the Emini struggled to make ground above 2740, after which futures then fell gradually throughout the rest of the session to relatively flat levels by the market close, though the trading range and volumes were thinnish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* M&amp;A news: Xerox (XRX) announced it had ended its $6.1bln deal with Fujifilm in a settlement with two of its largest shareholders, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, which saw the stock hit intraday low of ~9% before paring back some of the losses as trade progressed to the close. CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB), CBS filed a lawsuit to protect and give voting power to stockholders; lawsuit seeks to prevent National Amusements from interfering in special meeting where board is considering declaring a dividend, an attempt to dilute the controlling voting power of Shari Redstone, who is trying to force CBS (CBS) to re-merge with Viacom (VIAB).&nbsp; Finally, China has restarted the review of Qualcomm&rsquo;s (QCOM) USD 44bln offer for NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Stock specific news: Symantec outperformed on Monday following reports it is to hold a press conference addressing the latest probe it is facing. Also, of note for some casino names (SGMS, CZR, PENN &amp; MGM), the group did benefit from an announcement that New Jersey can legalise sports betting, however the main gains were seen in UK gambling names such as William Hill (WMH LN) and Paddy Power (PPB LN). The larger casino names (WYNN &amp; LVS) did initially benefit on the news however the gains were pared back. Elsewhere, US President Trump tweeted he is working with China&rsquo;s president Xi to give ZTE a way back into business, this boosted some companies with heavy exposure to the name such as Acacia Communications (ACIA) and Oclaro (OCLR).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* CRUDE: WTI futures (June) settle 26 cents higher at $70.96 per barrel; Brent futures (July) settle $1.11 higher at $78.23 per barrel. Brent outperformed WTI on Monday, with traders citing concerns about the geopolitical situation in the Middle East, driving the spread between the two benchmarks to wides last seen in 2015. Yemini rebels were once again reported to have been firing missiles at Saudi Aramco facilities. The crude complex started out the week in quiet fashion in the APAC session, with the bias towards selling after weekend news from the UAE, where the energy minister said that OPEC (Saudi, Kuwait and UEA) has the capacity to plug any gaps in production caused by Iran sanctions. Analysts have been considering how many barrels will be taken-off the market, and the range of estimates is wide &ndash; some believe it could be minimal, while others like the BP Boss Dudley suggest it could be as high as 1mln BPD. Also over the weekend, US National Security Advisor Bolton threatened European companies and nations who continue to do business with Iran could be hit with US sanctions. Additionally, traders were also chewing the fat on Baker Hughes weekly rig count data, released on Friday, which showed oil drillers adding 10 rigs in the week. On Monday, OPEC&rsquo;s monthly report intimated that the global oil glut is nearly over; crude production rose 12k bpd in April to average 31.93mln bpd, according to secondary sources; higher production in Saudi Arabia and Algeria was partially offset by decreased crude oil production, mainly in Venezuela, Gabon and Nigeria. OPEC also said that 2018 oil demand growth is forecast to increase by around 1.65 mb/d to average 98.85 mln bpd, while OECD commercial stocks declined in March, leaving the surplus just 9mln barrels above its five-year average. Analysts forecast crude oil inventories will draw down for the second consecutive week, with the Street estimating headline crude to draw 1.5mln, distillates to draw 1.8mln, gasoline to draw 1.1mln; meanwhile, Genscape reportedly has forecast stocks at Cushing will show a modest build of 65k barrels this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* TREASURIES:&nbsp;US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 5 ticks lower at 119-80. Treasuries were slightly down on Monday, albeit amid thin volume, with some suggesting early moves were in sympathy with German bunds, after a slate of ECB&rsquo;s speak appeared a touch more upbeat about the Eurozone economy, helping bund yields rise. Others attributed the selling action to a deep pipeline of investment grade debt, with the likes of Keurig launching an $8bln six-part M&amp;A bond sale to finance it&#39;s Dr Pepper M&amp;A. Most of the Treasury action was concentrated in the belly of the curve, with 5yr and 10yr yields higher by c.2bps at settlement. Although some steepening was seen across the complex heading into the close, 5s30s spread was only just off cyclical lows, steepening by c.1bp, while 2s10, 2s30s steeper by around 2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* FOREX: DXY tested fresh post-US CPI lows amidst widespread Greenback losses before gleaning a degree of traction from the latest upturn in Treasury yields that appears more supply related, given a raft of corporate deals and institutional issuance. The DXY dipped towards 92.200 before stabilising; in afternoon trade, the USD did find strength, however, pushing EUR beneath 1.1950, and gains were particularly stark against the CAD, NZD and AUD; there wasn&rsquo;t a specific story for the USD buying, though some had cited stops, and some also tried to connect Wilbur Ross&rsquo; comments on the USD (it plays a role in trade deficits) to the moves, given that the highs were made immediately after Ross&rsquo; comments. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* GBP, EUR, CHF: All were challenging/testing some key levels vs the Dollar as GBP crosses 1.3600 again, with stops touted from 1.3610 &ndash; we never quite got to that level however, and the late USD strength pushed cable towards 1.3550. EUR has inched closer to 1.2000 and its 200 DMA at 1.2020 following some upbeat/hawkish ECB commentary (Villeroy initially and then Lautenschlaeger) and progress on the Italian Government coalition formation (albeit limited), though fell victim to the USD strength, moving towards neutral levels. CHF recoiled further from parity-plus recent peaks to just a few pips off 0.9950, and seemingly paying little heed to SNB policy guidance maintaining that rates will remain negative and Franc strength will be curbed by direct action as it is still deemed to be overvalued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* JPY: A relative underperformer, with USDJPY on the brink of breaching a short term chart level and 50% Fib between 109.59-60.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* CAD, AUD: Benefitted from the USD misfortune in early trade, and CAD was also underpinned by oil and NAFTA deal hopes. AUDUSD was holding near 0.7550, well above recent lows and the latest big option expiries at 0.7500 that ran off unscathed, with further support coming via cross moves vs the NZD (which has inched over the 200 DMA at 1.0881), though fell beneath 0.7550 in late trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EM: Intervention and some simple short covering against the backdrop of broad dollar retracement helped the likes of the ARS, RUB and TRY regain some composure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*COMING-UP: RBA MINUTES (overnight): The RBA&rsquo;s minutes are unlikely to diverge too far from the latest RBA statement. At the meeting, they kept interest rate unchanged at 1.50% and Governor Lowe said there was not a strong case for a near term move in rates. With the RBA expected to remain on hold for the foreseeable future, the minutes are not expected to have a major impact on Australian assets. On the same day, RBA Deputy Governor Debelle speaks and these comments may be more interesting given that the speech is on the outlook for the Australian economy. Debelle last spoke in the middle of April but didn&rsquo;t mention monetary policy in his speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* COMING UP - US RETAIL SALES (Tues): The Street looks for US retail sales to rise 0.4% MM in April (vs previous 0.6%) and the control group to rise by 0.3% MM (vs previous 0.4%). Analysts are expecting the slight cooling in the pace of growth to be attributed to softer vehicle sales, though the rise in gasoline prices will perhaps offset some of that weakness. Retail sales growth in Q1 slowed to around 1.0% annualised, according to Capital Economics. &ldquo;Nonetheless, with incomes boosted by the recent tax cuts and a strong labour market, the conditions are in place for spending growth to pick up again in the second quarter.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* COMING UP - UK LABOUR MARKET DATA (Tues): Over in the UK, Tuesday brings the release of the latest domestic labour report with focus once again set to fall on the earnings components with unemployment near historic lows. Earnings will gain extra prominence in the wake of last month&rsquo;s decline in earnings and last week&rsquo;s &lsquo;confusing&rsquo; BoE release which has left traders looking for clues as to when the BoE could deliver their next 25bps hike, albeit that call is more likely to be made based on revisions to Q1 GDP. Ahead of the report, RBC note &ldquo;it appears that the including bonus measure will be unchanged from last month at 2.8% 3m/y but base effects could see the ex-bonus measure slow to 2.6% 3m/y&rdquo;.</p>\r\n",

Analysts have been considering how many barrels will be taken-off the market, and the range of estimates is wide &ndash; some believe it could be minimal, while others like the BP Boss Dudley suggest it could be as high as 1mln BPD.</li>\r\n  <li>Also over the weekend, US National Security Advisor Bolton threatened European companies and nations who continue to do business with Iran could be hit with US sanctions.</li>\r\n  <li>Additionally, traders were also chewing the fat on Baker Hughes weekly rig count data, released on Friday, which showed oil drillers adding 10 rigs in the week.</li>\r\n  <li>On Monday, OPEC&rsquo;s monthly report intimated that the global oil glut is nearly over; crude production rose 12k bpd in April to average 31.93mln bpd, according to secondary sources; higher production in Saudi Arabia and Algeria was partially offset by decreased crude oil production, mainly in Venezuela, Gabon and Nigeria. OPEC also said that 2018 oil demand growth is forecast to increase by around 1.65 mb/d to average 98.85 mln bpd, while OECD commercial stocks declined in March, leaving the surplus just 9mln barrels above its five-year average.</li>\r\n  <li>Analysts forecast crude oil inventories will draw down for the second consecutive week, with the Street estimating headline crude to draw 1.5mln, distillates to draw 1.8mln, gasoline to draw 1.1mln; meanwhile, Genscape reportedly has forecast stocks at Cushing will show a modest build of 65k barrels this week. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

In addition, US equity futures also received a modest uplift after US President Trump provided a lifeline for ZTE over the weekend as he vowed to get the Chinese telco back to business in a surprising policy U-turn after the Co. had announced a halt to major operating activities following a US 7-year supply ban order. ASX 200 (+0.3%) was positive with M&amp;A activity underpinning Healthscope, while Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) was also in the green as earnings remained in focus with Shiseido among the index leaders on record Q1 sales. Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (+1.4%) conformed to the broad risk appetite as trade concerns eased following the ZTE policy reversal by Trump and as participants also reacted to better than expected lending data. Elsewhere, KLCI (+0.4%) saw an early slump with losses of over 2% on reopen from the surprise election result, but then pared all the weakness as the fears of a new government gradually subsided. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid similar price action in T-notes and with demand sapped amid gains in stocks, while downside was also counterbalanced by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for a respectable JPY 1.03tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped reverse repo operations and instead announced to lend CNY 156bln via 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility at 3.3% which effectively rolled over same maturing amount, while it conducted CNY 80.1bln in PSL loans. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3345 (Prev. 6.3524)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he instructed the US Commerce Department to assist Chinese telecoms firm ZTE to get back into business which is seen as a U-turn on the firm which was previously placed under a 7-year supply ban by the US.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea is planning to take apart its nuclear test site during a ceremony to be held between May 23rd-25th, while there were also comments from US Secretary of State Pompeo that North Korea sanctions will be lifted if the nation proceeds with total denuclearizarion of the Korean peninsula. (Newswires/CBS)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Mester (Voter, Hawk) said she doesn&rsquo;t expect inflation to pick up sharply and she supports gradual rise in US interest rates and adds she does not expect to hike rates beyond 3% in the near future. (Newswires/CNBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Villeroy (Dovish) said the end of net asset purchases is nearing, but whether this is in September of December is not an existential question, adding that communication will be adjusted given current rate guidance is conditioned on the end of net asset purchases, could give additional guidance on timing of rate hike - &quot;well past&quot; seeming some quarters rather than years. He believes underlying inflation is set to strengthen irrespective of short-run fluctuations in energy inflation, sees the current slowdown in inflation as temporary and expects it to resume its progress in the coming months.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&rsquo;s 5-Star Movement and League reportedly reached an agreement on measures including universal basic income, a flat tax and roll back of pension reforms from 2011. Reports also stated that the agreement is likely to underpin the formation of a government although they still need to reach a deal on who to choose to be PM and cabinet members. Reports from Corriere state Italy&rsquo;s League has proposed Giulio Sapelli as PM and 5 Star proposes Giuseppe Conte (WSJ/Corriere)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Italian President Mattarella to hold government formation talks with 5 Star at 16:30 (15:30 BST), with League at 18:00 (17:00 BST)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May spokesman states that there is no timeline for defining the details of the two options for the future customs relationship with the EU, priority is getting things right.

(Independent)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are currently trading with no firm directions (Euro Stoxx 50 -0.1%) with the SMI the outperforming bourse (+0.3%) aided by Novartis (+0.8%) and Roche (+1.2%) both receiving positive news from the FDA pertaining to drug expansions. The modestly underperforming bourse is currently the FTSE MIB (-0.5%) with traders mindful of upcoming developments on the Italian Government formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The automotive sector is being weighed on following the US proposition of 20% tariffs of foreign cars imported to the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further effects in European equities from US actions has seen the healthcare sector showing positivity in the wake of the Trump administration releasing a (vague) blueprint for drug pricing; and Ericsson and Nokia down on Trump&rsquo;s tweet that he will help the penalized ZTE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stock specifics, strength is being seen for IWG (+21.2%) on the news that the co. has received separate takeover proposals from private equity groups Starwood, Lone Star and TDR Capital, raising prospects of a bidding war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leading&nbsp;broad gains vs the Dollar on a combination of supportive fundamentals (relatively hawkish rhetoric from ECB&rsquo;s Villeroy and further progress towards an Italian coalition Government in the case of the single currency), and a more positive technical landscape after recent sharp declines. It appears that Eur/Usd and Cable have both formed fairly solid bases circa 1.1820 and 1.3460 respectively, and dip-buyers/fresh longs are looking for extended recoveries towards 1.2000 and 1.3600 with stops said to be poised around 1.1980 and 1.3610. Market contacts also note that chart resistance in Eur/Jpy has been breached at 130.86, with bulls eyeing a 50% Fib next (131.86 vs 131.20 top so far).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All mildly firmer vs the aforementioned depressed Greenback overall (index still sub-92.500), with the Loonie still benefiting from latest NAFTA reports suggesting a deal could be forthcoming by Thursday and Usd/Cad retesting bids/support ahead of 1.2750. Aud/Usd is maintaining recovery momentum around 0.7550 amidst less against on the global trade front after US President Trump&rsquo;s volte-face on China&rsquo;s ZTE, and with cross Aud/Nzd also a prop (over 1.0850 and edging towards the 200 DMA at 108.81). Usd/Chf is holding just below parity, prompting more pledges from the SNB to keep rates negative and active in terms of direct FX intervention to curb Franc demand/appreciation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The G10/major laggards and bucking the overall trend with losses vs the Usd, albeit modest, as the Kiwi hovers near 0.6950 and Usd/Jpy rebounds from the low 109.00 area to 109.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Briefly extended recent gains vs the Eur on more hawkish guidance from the Norges Bank, but now losing some ground within a 9.5340-5740 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted from the outset, Bunds have looked increasingly leggy above 159.00 in recent sessions and amidst hawkish-leaning ECB commentary courtesy of Villeroy the technical picture has turned more bearish as a series of recent lows failed to hold. The first to go was last Friday&rsquo;s Eurex session base at 158.79, and then an interim chart support at 158.68 gave way ahead of last week&rsquo;s low at 158.52, with a Fib at 158.43 also unable to arrest the slide as the core Eurozone bond slips to 158.26 (-59 ticks). Bears are now eyeing 158.20 before 158.00, while Gilts have now been down to 121.65 (-45 ticks) and just through a &lsquo;strong&rsquo; downside technical level at 121.67, with 121.50 next on the radar. US Treasuries largely side-lined, but unable to escape the selling pressure that has built in EU debt peers, with the curve re-steepening after, amidst and ahead of multiple Fed speakers including Mester. Note, fixed also faced with a heavy corporate deal pipeline and impending long end DMO Gilt supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving onto the commodities complex, oil prices are lower, subdued on continued profit taking with WTI crude below the USD 71.00/bbl level, while some reports also noting increased efforts by European nations to salvage the Iranian nuclear deal and will be meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold trades flat with marginal gains observed on the back of a subdued USD, while copper (-0.5%) is lower amid reports Japanese miners plan to boost Chilean copper output this year. Aluminium prices eased for a third session as markets continue to correct following the rally last month supported by US sanctions against Rusal. Meanwhile, Chinese iron ore prices extended gains, supported by a firm demand outlook and a decline in the metal&rsquo;s inventories at ports</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: OPEC Monthly report to be released at 05:40 CDT (11:40 BST)</p>\r\n",

In addition, US equity futures also received a modest uplift after US President Trump provided a lifeline for ZTE over the weekend as he vowed to get the Chinese telco back to business in a surprising policy U-turn after the Co. had announced a halt to major operating activities following a US 7-year supply ban order. ASX 200 (+0.3%) was positive with M&amp;A activity underpinning Healthscope, while Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) was also in the green as earnings remained in focus with Shiseido among the index leaders on record Q1 sales. Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) and Hang Seng (+1.5%) conformed to the broad risk appetite as trade concerns eased following the ZTE policy reversal by Trump and as participants also reacted to better than expected lending data. Elsewhere, KLCI (+0.4%) saw an early slump with losses of over 2% on reopen from the surprise election result, but then pared all the weakness as the fears of a new government gradually subsided. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid similar price action in T-notes and with demand sapped amid gains in stocks, while downside was also counterbalanced by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for a respectable JPY 1.03tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FTSE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK gambling names &ndash; UK government is set to unveil a shake-up of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBT) shortly.

This benefitted its major counterparts EUR/USD and GBP/USD in which the former was also facilitated by news that Italy&rsquo;s 5-Star Movement and League reached an agreement which is likely to pave the way for the formation of a government, while a subdued commodities complex kept trade in related currencies indecisive. Elsewhere, MYR saw volatile trade as participants reacted to the regime change in Malaysia which saw the currency slip to a 4-month low on the initial shock before it mounted a recovery, while NOK was underpinned in late trade after Norges Bank Governor Olsen suggested in an op-ed that it will soon be appropriate to lift rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SNB&#39;s Zurbruegg said the CHF can quickly strengthen, while he added that there is no need to give up negative interest rates and does not see a need to give up FX market intervention.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week mostly positive but with trade relatively rangebound following Friday&rsquo;s mixed performance on Wall St, where stocks saw an indecisive finish to their best week since March. In addition, US equity futures also received a modest uplift after US President Trump provided a lifeline for ZTE over the weekend as he vowed to get the Chinese telco back to business in a surprising policy U-turn after the Co. had announced a halt to major operating activities following a US 7-year supply ban order. ASX 200 (+0.2%) is positive with M&amp;A activity underpinning Healthscope after it received an unsolicited proposal from Brookfield and with GWA outperforming on news it is to offload a unit, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2) is also in the green as earnings remain in focus with Shiseido among the index leaders on record Q1 sales. Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) and Hang Seng (+1.5%) conform to the broad risk appetite as trade concerns ease following the ZTE policy reversal by Trump and as participants also react to better than expected lending data. Elsewhere, KLCI saw an early slump with losses of over 2% on reopen from the surprise election result, but then pared nearly all the weakness as the fears gradually eased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is somewhat subdued with the DXY below 92.50 in a continuation of last week&rsquo;s inflation-provoked pullback and amid the backdrop of Trump policy uncertainty. This has benefitted its major counterparts EUR/USD and GBP/USD in which the former was also facilitated by news that Italy&rsquo;s 5-Star Movement and League reached an agreement which is likely to pave the way for the formation of a government, while a subdued commodities complex kept trade in related currencies indecisive. MYR saw volatile trade as participants reacted to the regime change in Malaysia with the currency slipping to a 4-month low on the initial shock, before mounting a recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid similar price action in T-notes and with demand sapped amid gains in stocks, while downside was also counterbalanced by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for a respectable JPY 1.03tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",
