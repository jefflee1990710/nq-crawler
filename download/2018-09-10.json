Supporting the equity complex was news that Republicans are set to unveil a fresh round of tax cuts this week ahead of midterms in November.

The front end of the curve saw modest selling, pushing 2-year yields to fresh decade highs; the long-end continues to find haven buyers with continuing concerns lingering regarding trade wars. Treasuries also moved lower in sympathy with the bund as the Italian economy minister made the right noises regarding the upcoming budget. But other than that, the T-Note was largely rangebound, with little by way of news to shake it out of its slumber. US T-note futures (Z8) settled half-a-tick higher at 120-21.</p>\r\n",

Already, however, political analysts have suggested that the House GOP could face obstacles in enacting any further cuts, since lawmakers are reportedly reticent to add to the already ballooning budget deficit. Additionally, if successful in the House, the legislation would not likely be taken up in the Senate soon, Reuters reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The FT reports that the EU is preparing to give Brexit negotiator Barnier instructions to close a deal with the UK, which would essentially mean handing him a mandate to speed up the process and settle the Article 50 exit from the EU Barnier is expected to be given this mandate at the 20 September unofficial Brexit conference in Salzburg. The report comes and further news reports over the weekend highlighting splits in the Conservative party, where PM May&#39;s Chequers plan is likely to be voted against by around 80 Tory MPs - it is worth making the distinction that although this is enough to derail her agenda, it still is short of the 160 Conservative MPs needed to force May out. The Party conference at the end of September will, therefore, be a key factor. Later, EU&#39;s Barnier noted the constructive talks, and suggested a deal could be reached within 6-8 weeks.

Those levels tended to hold up in the US afternoon, when stocks took a dip, before seeing some positive ticks as the closing bell approached. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS. </strong>CBS (CBS) traded as much as 3% lower following its settlement with National Amusements and CEO Moonves&rsquo; departure, which also meant that CBS would not pursue Viacom (VIAB). Tesla (TSLA) after Baird upgraded the automaker, arguing strong fundamentals could push up the stock ahead of its next earnings report. Alibaba (BABA) fell on Chairman/Founder Jack Ma announcing he will step down in 2019. AMD (AMD), Amazon (AMZN) and Footlocker (FL) pushed higher following upgrades at Wells Fargo. United Rentals (URI) announced the acquisition of BlueLine Rental for USD 2.1bln. Nike (NKE) was up after Wedbush said it sees higher sales growth and margin expansion, and NKE has now erased its losses incurred following its new .</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES 21 CENTS LOWER AT $67.54/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLES 54 CENTS HIGHER AT $77.37: </strong>Brent was bid after the Libyan NOC HQ was attacked by militants, though the situation was resolved and the NOC&#39;s chairman said there was no impact on output, which took some of the air out of the bid. Brent also found support from a delayed restart of operations at the Buzzard field in the North Sea due to weather conditions. On the note of weather, the US East Coast is bracing for impact from Hurricane Florence (now a cat 4). Analysts at Citi noted that while there is no crude oil production or significant refineries in the storm&#39;s path, the possible closure of the Colonial Pipeline could widen the spread between Houston and NY Harbour prices for products. On the demand front, China, the world&#39;s largest importer of crude, raises imports to a four-month high in August to 9.04mln BPD, and this came as smaller independent refiners boosted their crude intakes from multi-month lows, PVM said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE HALF-A-TICK HIGHER AT 120-21:&nbsp;</strong>The curve was mixed, with traders eyeing this week&rsquo;s supply, which will generate USD 49bln in new cash. The front end of the curve saw modest selling, pushing 2-year yields to fresh decade highs; the long-end continues to find haven buyers with continuing concerns lingering regarding trade wars. Treasuries also moved lower in sympathy with the bund as the Italian economy minister made the right noises regarding the upcoming budget. But other than that, the T-Note was largely rangebound, with little by way of news to shake it out of its slumber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 3-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 73bln in 3s (USD 35bln, Tuesday), 10s (USD 23bln on Wednesday) and 30s (USD 15bln on Thursday); with USD 24bln maturing at he month-end settlement, the auctions will raise a net USD 49bln in new cash, according to TD Securities. The Fed will allow all USD 19bn maturing at month-end (the amount is below the $24bn cap) to run off at month-end. Analysts art Barclays have noted that demand has been easing in the 3-year sector since the start of the year, which has seen bid/cover ratios decline from 3.13x in January, to 2.51x at the auction in July. The bank still notes, however, that the August refunding had an uptick, with the metric ticking up, though still lags August 2017 levels. Barclays also notes that performance was also stronger at the start of the year, with most of the sales clearing the WI level. But July and August&#39;s auctions saw tails of 0.6bps and 0.2bps respectively. Foreign participation has been steadily ticking down this year, too from highs around 20% in February, to a low of 6% in July. Domestic investors remain active, however, and raised participation in July. Focussing on this week&#39;s 3s auction, TD Securities says that following a dsolid NFP release on Friday, yields in the short-end have nudged higher, which should help set-up going into the auction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The buck is slightly softer on Monday, and hasn&#39;t strengthened too much after Trump&#39;s threats on Friday to potentially unleash further tariffs on China. The DXY trades a touch above 95.00. While some bank desks have been talking up the USD in an escalating China trade war scenario, the team and ING are more sceptical, arguing that trade war escalation will not be positive for the USD, which it says has been buoyed by cyclical US economic sentiment and related portfolio inflows. &quot;These would go into reverse if the US and China slap further tariffs on each other &ndash; and we prefer to play this via short USD/JPY positions,&quot; ING says. Last week, Goldman Sachs also argued that short USDJPY was a way to play an escalation of the China trade war theme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Once again, positive Brexit headlines cast a shadow over everything else sterling-related; The Europeans seem to be making the right noises about a Brexit deal, and that means traders can focus on the positives, shrugging-off the political woes faced by UK PM May. A solid GDP print was largely ignored, though provided another reason to be optimistic on GBP. 1.30 was breached to the upside, helped along by weakness in the USD; EURGBP&#39;s fall was more benign, by comparison, briefly breached 0.89 to the downside, though seems content to take a breater at that level. This week&#39;s BOE is likely to be a snooze fest, with markets focussed on Brexit headlines and UK politics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>The major laggards all day, albeit with the former deriving some underlying support from upward revisions to Q2 Japanese growth and not extending losses vs the Greenback much beyond 111.00. However, the Franc almost weakened to 0.9750 and recoiled around 1 big figure vs the Eur from 1.1200+ to just shy of 1.1300, with no obvious fundamental driver, but the price moves smack of some form of official action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, CAD: </strong>All benefiting from the Gbp/Brexit-related US Dollar downturn (DXY unwinding NFP-inspired gains from 95.500+ towards 95.000), with the Aud consolidating its rebound from 0.7200, the Kiwi nudging 0.6550 vs close to 0.6500 at one stage overnight and the Loonie bouncing further from near 1.3200 lows towards 1.3150 having cleared the 100 HMA (1.3171).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SCANDIS: </strong>Some NOK outperformance vs the EUR (tested 9.6950) and SEK on stronger than expected Norwegian CPI that keeps the Norges Bank on track to tighten well before the ECB and Riksbank, but the Swedish Krona still held up relatively well after Sunday&rsquo;s inconclusive election result, as the SD party did not attain as many votes as predicted in some polls &ndash; Eur/Sek sub-10.5000.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>A volatile start to the week with the Lira and Rouble unwinding a degree of CBRT and CBR rate hike premium ahead of respective policy meetings, while the Rand was undermined by more political angst and positioning for possible ratings downgrades. Usd/Try is currently around 6.4500, Usd/Rub above 70.0000 and Usd/Zar 15.2000. Elsewhere, the Yuan came under renewed pressure after Friday&rsquo;s warning from US President Trump that the pending $200 bn tariffs on Chinese goods could yet be more than doubled.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling is ending a rather manic EU session on the front foot, having largely ignored a mixed batch of UK data and survived an early 1.2900 downside test vs the Usd, with latest Brexit headlines the clear catalyst. EU chief negotiator Barnier claims that it is realistic to reach a deal within 6-8 weeks, and the 2 sides are close to agreement on security, propelling Cable from circa 1.2950 through 1.3000 initially before stops around 1.3020 were tripped to a fresh peak for September near 1.3050 before momentum faded. Meanwhile, EUR/Gbp retreated from 0.8950+ to just under 0.8900 at one stage, as the single currency struggled to clear 1.1600 again, with latest CFTC data revealing a spec shift to net Eur longs and so the positional base prone to long liquidation again. Back to Brexit, a subsequent report suggested that an extraordinary EU Brexit summit may be arranged for November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All benefiting from the Gbp/Brexit-related US Dollar downturn (DXY unwinding NFP-inspired gains from 95.500+ towards 95.000), with the Aud consolidating its rebound from 0.7200, the Kiwi nudging 0.6550 vs close to 0.6500 at one stage overnight and the Loonie bouncing further from near 1.3200 lows towards 1.3150 having cleared the 100 HMA (1.3171).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major laggards all day, albeit with the former deriving some underlying support from upward revisions to Q2 Japanese growth and not extending losses vs the Greenback much beyond 111.00. However, the Franc almost weakened to 0.9750 and recoiled around 1 big figure vs the Eur from 1.1200+ to just shy of 1.1300, with no obvious fundamental driver, but the price moves smack of some form of official action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCANDI</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some Nok outperformance vs the Eur (tested 9.6950) and Sek on stronger than expected Norwegian CPI that keeps the Norges Bank on track to tighten well before the ECB and Riksbank, but the Swedish Krona still held up relatively well after Sunday&rsquo;s inconclusive election result, as the SD party did not attain as many votes as predicted in some polls &ndash; Eur/Sek sub-10.5000. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A volatile start to the week with the Lira and Rouble unwinding a degree of CBRT and CBR rate hike premium ahead of respective policy meetings, while the Rand was undermined by more political angst and positioning for possible ratings downgrades. Usd/Try is currently around 6.4500, Usd/Rub above 70.0000 and Usd/Zar 15.2000. Elsewhere, the Yuan came under renewed pressure after Friday&rsquo;s warning from US President Trump that the pending $200 bn tariffs on Chinese goods could yet be more than doubled.</p>\r\n",

Sweden Democrat leader Akesson commented he is prepared to talk with all other parties especially with centre-right leader Kristersson, while the leader of the Sweden Liberal Party (part of centre-right bloc) said they want an alliance government but it will not happen by cooperating with the Sweden Democrats. There were also comments from Swedish PM and Social Democrat party leader Lofven that nothing would be determined by the election night and that he will continue to work as PM until parliament vote, while he also stated this should be the end for bloc politics regardless of the final outcome.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY was indecisive around 111.00 as the impact from a firmer greenback was nullified by stronger than expected GDP as well as the predominantly risk-averse tone.

After the data, there was some stabilisation, with the Z8 contract trading between 119-20 to 119-23, though there was a bid after Trump threatened China with further tariffs, but even then, the move was faded as we approached the close. Despite yields higher across the curve, there was some narrowing between major curve spreads (5s30s -3bps, 2s30s -2bps, 2s10s -0.2bps).

ASX 200 (Unch.) was flat as strength in tech and healthcare was counterbalanced by weakness in financials heading into a fresh round of grilling by the banking royal commission, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) was choppy amid similar indecision in the local currency and with mild support seen following a stronger than expected upward revision in the Final Annualized Q2 GDP data. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) underperformed after further tariff threats from US President Trump and as participants digested mixed trade data in which Trade Balance and Exports missed expectations. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with price action subdued despite the indecisive risk tone and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 1.1tln in 1yr-10yr JGBs.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week subdued following the lacklustre performance on Wall St last Friday where sentiment was dampened after Trump doubled-down on his tariff threats against China, while participants also digest a slew of key data including US NFP, Chinese Trade Data and Japanese GDP. ASX 200 (+0.1%) is relatively flat as strength in tech and healthcare is counterbalanced by weakness in financials heading into a fresh round of grilling by the banking royal commission, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) is choppy around the 22300 level amid similar indecision in the local currency and with mild support seen following a stronger than expected upward revision in the Final Annualized Q2 GDP data. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) underperform after further tariff threats from US President Trump on Friday who said another USD 276bln of tariffs on China are ready to go on top of the proposed USD 200bln of goods which could be available on short notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remains above the 95.00 level and near Friday&rsquo;s highs after NFP jobs data topped estimates and with Average Earnings also higher than expected which would likely keep the Fed steadfast in its hiking cycle. This has kept price action in EUR/USD and GBP/USD contained, while AUD/USD and NZD/USD eye a test on the 0.7100 and 0.6500 levels to the downside respectively. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is indecisive around 111.00 as the impact from a firmer greenback is nullified by stronger than expected GDP as well as the predominantly risk averse tone, while SEK is also indecisive amid political uncertainty after the governing Social Democrats and its centre-left coalition were at a deadlock with the opposition centre-right alliance and with the nationalists, anti-immigration Sweden Democrats effectively the kingmaker.<br /><br />Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with price action subdued amid the indecisive risk tone and despite the BoJ present in the market for JPY 1.1tln in 1yr-10yr JGBs.</p>\r\n",
