Trade was choppy, but at the end of the day, the major indices were green. Many have argued that Friday/Monday declines in stock prices were driven more by positioning and sentiment rather than underlying fundamentals, which still appear solid; with some advocating US economic growth is firm, that there are hints inflation will return to target, and that the US is near/in full employment (depending on who you ask).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More specific to equities, corporate earnings have grown this season, and some note that there is around $60bln of dividends to be paid over the course of February, which institutional investors will likely reinvest, supporting stocks. Further. The fiscal injection that the Trump administration will put behind infrastructure investment will likely support US companies. SPX +1.75% at 2695, DJI +2.33% at 24912, NDX +2.6% at 6666.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top sectors: Materials +2.7%, Tech +2.7%, Cons Cyclicals +2.3%<br />Bottom sectors: Utilities -1.2%, Telecoms +0.45%, Energy +0.8%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sheer magnitude of the equity price swings (and spike in volatility) seems to have put a pause in the unrelenting surge higher in US yields (and more crucially, real yields), and the tplex was happy to resume its role as a haven amid this week&rsquo;s market turmoil. The curve bull flattened, and major spreads narrowed slightly. The US will auction $68bln in new 3s/10s/30s this week, and with $46.6bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is seen at $21.4bln. The issuance gives traders an opportunity to assess whether the bond market sell-off has stabilised, or whether there is still room to run. Today&rsquo;s 3s auction will not have answered that question given the sale was lacklustre. The auction tailed, cover was a touch weaker (though above recent averages), with dealer takedown particularly noteworthy at 40.5%, above recent averages. US T-Note futures settle +7 ticks at 121-15+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: Stocks bounce-back after Monday’s rout",
        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +1.75% at 2695, DJI +2.33% at 24912, NDX +2.6% at 6666</strong><br />Top sectors: Materials +2.7%, Tech +2.7%, Cons Cyclicals +2.3%<br />Bottom sectors: Utilities -1.2%, Telecoms +0.45%, Energy +0.8%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A choppy session on Wall Street saw futures pare back their heavy losses incurred after yesterday&rsquo;s sell-off, moving positive shortly after the NY cash equity open. Trade was choppy, but at the end of the day, the major indices were green.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many have argued that Friday/Monday declines in stock prices were driven more by positioning and sentiment rather than underlying fundamentals, which still appear solid; US economic growth is firm, there are hints that inflation will return to target, and the US is near/in full employment (depending on who you ask).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More specific to equities, corporate earnings have grown this season, and some note that there is around $60bln of dividends to be paid over the course of February, which institutional investors will likely reinvest, supporting stocks. Further. The fiscal injection that the Trump administration will put behind infrastructure investment will likely support US companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also signs that the Treasury sell-off has stabilised for now, providing some comfort to those traders who sold stocks on the back of a sharp pick-up in yields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Policymakers continue to &lsquo;monitor&rsquo; markets: Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that the recent volatility wasn&rsquo;t enough to shake market fundamentals, the White House remains in monitoring mode, and the ECB has reached out to market participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volatility, meanwhile, continues to be volatile (for want of a better phrase), as short vol trades continue to be crushed. The XIV was constantly being halted and then restarted through Tuesday trade. And though the VIX has eased off highs seen on Monday, it still remains near highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Note futures settle +7 ticks at 121-15+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sheer magnitude of the equity price swings (and spike in volatility) seems to have put a pause in the unrelenting surge higher in US yields (and more crucially, real yields), and the tplex was happy to resume its role as a haven amid this week&rsquo;s market turmoil. The curve bull flattened, and major spreads narrowed slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US will auction $68bln in new 3s/10s/30s this week, and with $46.6bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is seen at $21.4bln. The issuance gives traders an opportunity to assess whether the bond market sell-off has stabilised, or whether there is still room to run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s 3s auction will not have answered that question given the sale was lacklustre. The auction tailed, cover was a touch weaker (though above recent averages), with dealer takedown particularly noteworthy at 40.5%, above recent averages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY +0.1% heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tumultuous market conditions saw haven flows into the yen and Swissy, and even the mighty dollar, with the DXY neutral/slightly positive for most of US trade, though gains were pared back as equity traders found more vigour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin backed a strong dollar in his testimony to US lawmakers, and argued that, in the long term, a strong dollar is in the best interest of the US &ndash; once again, softening his tone from Davos, where he was understood to have welcomed USD weakness. Mnuchin also noted that himself &amp; US President Trump are very focused on currency manipulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold failed to rally convincingly against the background of this week&rsquo;s turmoil, with metals traders cautious of the narrative that the recent market sell-off may have been temporary, and instead focussing on a path of Fed rate hikes where there are risks of four hikes in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR, meanwhile, was up following decent German factory data, making its way back to the 1.24 handle, while GBP slid to lows around 1.3850, before recovering towards the 1.3960 mark. EURGBP was higher, breaching .89 &nbsp;before paring back, with reports that EU wants the right to curb the UK&rsquo;s single market access during any transition period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling traders will be keeping an eye on Super Tuesday, where the BOE is seen standing pat on policy (~50% probability of a May hike).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AUD pared back heavy overnight losses after disappointing retail sales data, and an RBA which is firmly in wait-and-see mode, but hasn&rsquo;t managed to breach the .79 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD was higher, finding refuge around .73 after the latest GDT auction saw WMP prices surge by over 7%, as futures had indicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CAD was slightly stronger despite an Ivey PMI miss, and a wider than expected trade deficit (Dec).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In EMFX, ZAR was stronger as the ANC prepared to consider President Zuma&rsquo;s future. It was reported that Zuma will resign as soon as a list of preconditions has been finalised, which lent some strength to the rand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 76 cents lower at $63.39 per barrel; Brent futures settle 76 cents lower at $66.86 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The risk-off tone again hit the crude complex in Tuesday trade, ahead of API energy inventory data after the bell. This week, traders expect to see crude stocks rise for a second week. Crude is likely to build 3.2mln, Cushing stocks are seen drawing by 1.9mln, distillate stocks are seen drawing down by 1.4mln, while gasoline stocks are expected to post a small build of 500k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was some OPEC chatter crossing the wires: Kuwaiti oil production capacity will reach 3.225mln BPD next month, its oil minister said, while Azeri production rose by around 4k BPD to 814,600 in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC SG Barkindo in a speech sounded upbeat with regards to 2017 price gains, but added that there is still &lsquo;a way to go&rsquo; in rebalancing the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US, the EIA brought forward its expectation of when US oil output will exceed 11mln BPD to later in 2018, with production set to average 11.04mln BPD in Q4. It also revised its 2018 world oil demand geowth forecast by 10k BPD to +1.73mln Y/Y, abd revised 2019 demand growth forecast 70k higher to +1.72mln BPD Y/Y.</p>\r\n",

With USD 46.6bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is seen at USD 21.4bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month&rsquo;s series of auctions comes at a key inflection point, with bonds selling-off aggressively at the beginning of the year. The 10-year note, for instance, has added c.40bps in 2018, a trend exacerbated by strong US data and hints that the Fed may lift rates more aggressively than anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This week&#39;s UST auctions should show whether there&#39;s any appetite to buy the dip,&rdquo; analysts at UBS write, &ldquo;but most fixed income rallies this year have been dead cat bounces, any uptick being seen as another selling opportunity.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UBS believes that if the auctions are digested well, it could signal that the worst is over for the fixed income complex, and looks to upcoming Fed commentary this week for any indications of whether voting officials see the sell-off as justified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(NOTE: This week&rsquo;s Fedspeak includes Bullard (non-voter) on Tuesday; Kaplan (non-voter), Evans (non-voter), Williams (voter) and Dudley (voter) on Wednesday; Harker (non-voter), Kashkari (non-voter) on Thursday; George (non-voter) on Friday.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the last auction series, the 3-year sector has cheapened on an outright basis and on the curve on the back of a hawkish repricing of the Fed&rsquo;s hike trajectory, as well as the US Treasury announcing increased auction sizes last week at its Quarterly Refunding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TD Securities notes that last month&rsquo;s 3-year auction saw solid demand, and cover above recent averages. Dealer take down was in line with recent averages, while directs took a slightly higher allocation, and indirects took a slightly lower allocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest positioning data (w/e 24 January) shows dealers have trimmed their long position sin the <2yrs sector to the lowest since early December, to USD 26bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The 3-year note appears to be trading slightly cheap on Treasury spline versus the off-the-run 3s compared with the previous two auction cycles,&rdquo; Societe Generale writes, &ldquo;the 3-year note is cheap on the fly with 2s3s5s, hitting -8.9bp last week, the highest level since December 2015, and it is currently trading at around the same value.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SocGen holds a positive bias going into the auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY (JANUARY AUCTION VS SIX-AUCTION AVERAGE):</strong><br />- High-yield: 2.08% (vs six-auction average of 1.729%)<br />- Tail: Stopped through 0.7bps (vs six-auction average stop-through of 0.1bps)<br />- Bid-to-cover: 3.13x (vs six-auction average of 2.95x)<br />- Dealers: 33.6% (vs six-auction average of 34.9%)<br />- Directs: 11.5% (vs six-auction average of 9.3%)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The Greenback has recovered from Monday&rsquo;s Wall Street related blues and follow-through losses in Asia overnight as US stocks showed early signs of a bounce. The DXY managed to overcome layered resistance between 89.600 and then from 89.700-750 to test the water above 90.000, but stopped just short of the next strong upside chart objective around 90.113-150. Stops were triggered in Eur/Usd through 1.2330 and Cable on a break of 1.3900-02, but Fib supports at 1.2306 and 1.3805 respectively held in. Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf extended session range tops in contrast on reduced safe-haven demand to 109.50+ and almost 0.9400, while Usd/Cad bounced off near 1.2500 lows towards mid-range of a band up to 1.2565. Broader Sterling weakness on persistent UK political and Brexit uncertainty pushed Eur/Gbp up through 0.8900 at one stage and not far from 0.8920-30 resistance. The antipodean Dollars remained divergent throughout with Aud/Usd and Aud/Nzd rangy below 0.7900 and 1.0800 respectively after downbeat Aussie retail sales and trade updates, plus some caution from the RBA surrounding the wage, consumer, inflation and overall economic growth outlook. Kiwi focus now on the latest jobs report before the RNBZ on Thursday.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>- Monday&rsquo;s sharp declines in equities seems to have been caused by positioning/sentiment adjustments, rather than any fundamental drivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- CAUSE? </strong>A convincing narrative offered by a few desks suggests that after short-term momentum turned negative just after 12pm ET on Monday (S&amp;P 500 1-month price return went negative), trend-following strategies began selling at technically overbought levels (S&amp;P 500 weekly RSI has been near record highs), pushing indices through key moving averages (50-day has been widely touted) as liquidity thinned, resulting in volatility shorts being squeezed; as the vol squeeze propelled the VIX higher (with the broader press focusing on the inverse VIX ETN known as the XIV acting as a catalyst to exacerbate volatility owing to the required portfolio rebalancing), programme selling was triggered on the signal of increased volatility, adding further downside to equity indices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- IS THE SELLING DONE? </strong>JPM says the spike in volatility will contribute to outflows from systemic strategies (i.e. volatility targeting, risk parities, short vol) in the days ahead, and outflows may amount to around USD 100bln, though some desks have said they can envisage outflows more than double that. Goldman Sachs is waiting to see if all of the vol shorts have been cleared out yet (if not, the VIX may be pushed higher again, as shorts buy vol to close their positions).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Other desks have noted that equity sentiment is likely to be hurt, as caution spreads among traders and highlighting the potential for a de-risking of portfolios. Other desks remind us that after the flash crashes in 2010, 2013 and 2015 (particularly in 2010 and 2015), there was a reversal in bullish risk sentiment, which lingered in the days after the &lsquo;crashes&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- BUY THE DIP? </strong>Some desks have suggested as much. JPM wrote &ldquo;Rapid sell-offs can also be followed by market bounce backs as liquidity gets exhausted by programmatic selling,&rdquo; adding &ldquo;with next year P/E on the S&amp;P 500 now below 16, further positive impacts of tax reform and stabilization of bond yields (e.g., note the current record level of CFTC bond short positions), we think that the ongoing market sell-off ultimately presents a buying opportunity.&rdquo; Elsewhere, UBS points out that there is approximately USD 60bln of dividend flows in February, which institutional investors will likely reinvest, keeping stocks supported. Additionally, many have noted the firm tone of earnings out of US corporates this earnings season, which seems at odds with heavy equity downside.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- WHAT TO WATCH: </strong>Analysts are keeping an eye general risk metrics for signs of stabilisation (yields, precious metals, safe haven FX, as well as credit spreads). This week&rsquo;s abundant central bank speak will be monitored, as well as this week&rsquo;s UST supply of 3s/10s/30s.</p>\r\n",

Cable was among the first to buckle and tripped offers just ahead of 1.3900, but Eur/Usd fell not that long after and market contacts noted similar orders at 1.2330 vs the 1.2325 base. Usd/Jpy has now reached 109.50, with 109.00 showing a lot of resilience amidst offers in advance, and Usd/Cad is testing session highs again (1.2565) just ahead of 1.2590 chart resistance. Nzd/Usd has lost 0.7300 again, with the local focus on Q4 jobs data and the RBNZ tonight and tomorrow. Usd/Chf not far from 0.9400 awaiting the Wall Street open.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>European equities join the global sell-off as markets look to see whether Wall St will endure another day of heavy losses</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>That said, markets have gradually pared losses throughout the morning as commentators debate whether this is a minor blip or part of a larger correction</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Looking ahead, highlights include Canadian trade, APIs, NZ jobs and a slew of speakers</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Asia stocks continued the global equity sell-off and saw hefty losses across the board, as panic selling rolled over to the region following a slaughtering on Wall St.</strong> in which the DJIA (-4.6%) tumbled nearly 1200 points and briefly slipped into correction territory with sell programmes pushing the space lower but closed well off session lows amid a recovered on low volume. <strong>ASX 200 (-3.2%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (-4.7%)</strong> slumped at the open in which losses in crude weighed on Australia&rsquo;s energy stocks, while the Japanese benchmark was the worst performer amid JPY strength and with the index in a technical correction. <strong>Hang Seng (-5.1%) </strong>and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-3.4%)</strong> were also heavily weighed amid the ongoing market turmoil and after the PBoC refrained again from liquidity operations. Finally. 10yr JGBs traded higher and tracked the gains in T-notes which were up over a point, as the ongoing stock market sell-off spurred a flight-to-quality and lifted bond across the curve which saw the Japanese 40yr yield drop to its lowest since April last year. Furthermore, today&rsquo;s 10yr inflation-indexed auction from Japan also attracted stronger demand and higher accepted prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations again today for a daily net drain of CNY 80bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3072 (Prev. 6.3019)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA kept the Cash Rate unchanged at 1.50% as expected and reiterated that it judged policy was consistent with growth and inflation targets.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>European equities have kicked the session off on the backfoot (Eurostoxx 50 -1.8%)</strong> in a continuation of the sentiment seen late last night on Wall Street and overnight during Asia-Pac trade. There&rsquo;s been a lack of fresh catalysts in European trade for the sell-off with participants in the region catching up to yesterday&rsquo;s aforementioned losses; prices have recovered modestly from initial losses but remain markedly lower with all the ten sectors firmly in the red. Losses across all sectors are relatively broad-based with some slight underperformance in financials amid the downtick in yields and a disappointing earnings update from <strong>Munich Re (-3.9%) </strong>who sit at the bottom of the DAX. Focus in the financial sector has also been placed on <strong>Credit Suisse (-3.7%)</strong> who opened with heavy losses <strong>(-7.2%)</strong> amid fears over declines in the XIV (a product issued by the company). In the Stoxx 600, very few companies trade in the green with <strong>Intesa Sanpaolo (+1.7%)</strong> a notable exception following their pre-market earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong> and <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong> are edging higher again as EU cash bourses pare worst losses and flight to quality flow/positioning wanes somewhat. The headline pair has rebounded above 109.00 vs circa 108.50 lows overnight and bids at that level extending down to 108.30, just ahead of strong technical support at 108.28. The cross has traded up to 136.75 from around 134.00 in Asia, as <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> briefly reclaimed 1.2400+ status and the DXY continues to struggle on recoveries above 89.6000 near term resistance (within an 89.720-370 range). Cable is back below 1.4000 and briefly took out 1.3980 &lsquo;support&rsquo; as Sterling succumbs to more UK political/Brexit uncertainty &ndash; <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Gbp</strong> pulling away from 0.8900. <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Cad</strong> edging back down towards 1.2500 having tested 1.2550+ levels when risk aversion was running rife (Dow crashing almost 1600 points for example). Elsewhere, some marked region-specific divergence in the <strong>Aud</strong> and <strong>Nzd</strong>, as the former was hit by disappointing data (weak retail sales and an unexpected trade deficit) plus some RBA concerns about wages, household consumption and the growth/inflation outlook, if the currency appreciates too much. <strong>Aud</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> is now under 0.7900 albeit off 0.7835 lows, while the <strong>Aud</strong>/<strong>Nzd</strong> cross has lost the 1.0800 handle and the Kiwi is back above 0.7300 vs the Greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South African President Zuma has reportedly told ANC top 6 he is ready for no confidence motion. This was then followed up by reports stating that South Africa&#39;s ANC are divided on Zuma&#39;s fate according to a party official. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without wishing to rattle already fragile risk assets and broad sentiment, core or safe haven bonds have been creeping higher in recent trade, with <strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>Bunds</strong> both extending their intraday peaks before topping out again. The 10 year UK benchmark has now breached the 122.00 level and extended to 122.23 for an 83 tick advance, while <strong>Bunds</strong> crossed 159.00 again on their way to 159.13 and a 104 tick rally from their previous close. UST futures remain some way off overnight peaks, but cash yields have retreated further with 10s now down through 2.70% for a ca 20 bp reversal. The question is, are debt markets preparing for another bout of stock weakness ahead of the US open or just gathering momentum as shorts and vigilantes take more bearish bets off the table. Some market observers also suggest that spreads are in play, with Treasuries sold vs EU paper, and perhaps with looming US supply in mind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, both <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> crude futures trade lower albeit off worst levels with prices suppressed by the ongoing global risk sentiment; the recovery for WTI has also been stalled by a failure to reclaim USD 64/bbl to the upside with energy newsflow otherwise relatively light ahead of tonight&rsquo;s API inventories. In metals markets, spot <strong>gold</strong> (+0.25%) continues to benefit from its safe-haven appeal and the softer USD despite the World Gold Council stating that demand for the yellow metal fell to its lowest level since 2009 during 2017. Elsewhere, <strong>base</strong> metals were seen notably lower overnight in-fitting with the lack of global risk appetite with <strong>nickel</strong> said to have led the complex lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Envoy in Geneva says North Korea has accelerated pursuit and now may only be months away from the capability to strike the US with nuclear armed ballistic missiles.

The 10 year UK benchmark has now breached the 122.00 level and extended to 122.23 for an 83 tick advance, while Bunds crossed 159.00 again on their way to 159.13 and a 104 tick rally from their previous close. UST futures remain some way off overnight peaks, but cash yields have retreated further with 10s now down through 2.70% for a ca 20 bp reversal. The question is, are debt markets preparing for another bout of stock weakness ahead of the US open or just gathering momentum as shorts and vigilantes take more bearish bets off the table. Some market observers also suggest that spreads are in play, with Treasuries sold vs EU paper, and perhaps with looming US supply in mind. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: European equities join the global sell-off with all sectors firmly in the red (albeit off worst levels) with markets now looking for direction from Wall St.",
        "content": "<p>European equities have kicked the session off on the backfoot (Eurostoxx 50 -1.6%) in a continuation of the sentiment seen late last night on Wall Street and overnight during Asia-Pac trade. There&rsquo;s been a lack of fresh catalysts in European trade for the sell-off with participants in the region catching up to yesterday&rsquo;s aforementioned losses; prices have recovered modestly from initial losses but remain markedly lower with all the ten sectors firmly in the red. Losses across all sectors are relatively broad-based with some slight underperformance in financials amid the downtick in yields and a disappointing earnings update from Munich Re (-5.1%) who sit at the bottom of the DAX. Focus in the financial sector has also been placed on Credit Suisse (-3.7%) who opened with heavy losses (-7.2%) amid fears over declines in the XIV (a product issued by the company). In the Stoxx 600, very few companies trade in the green with Intesa Sanpaolo (+1.7%) a notable exception following their pre-market earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Jpy and Eur/Jpy are edging higher again as EU cash bourses pare worst losses and flight to quality flow/positioning wanes somewhat. The headline pair has rebounded above 109.00 vs circa 108.50 lows overnight and bids at that level extending down to 108.30, just ahead of strong technical support at 108.28. The cross has traded up to 136.75 from around 134.00 in Asia, as Eur/Usd briefly reclaimed 1.2400+ status and the DXY continues to struggle on recoveries above 89.6000 near term resistance (within an 89.720-370 range). Cable is back below 1.4000 and briefly took out 1.3980 &lsquo;support&rsquo; as Sterling succumbs to more UK political/Brexit uncertainty &ndash; Eur/Gbp pulling away from 0.8900. Usd/Cad edging back down towards 1.2500 having tested 1.2550+ levels when risk aversion was running rife (Dow crashing almost 1600 points for example). Elsewhere, some marked region-specific divergence in the Aud and Nzd, as the former was hit by disappointing data (weak retail sales and an unexpected trade deficit) plus some RBA concerns about wages, household consumption and the growth/inflation outlook, if the currency appreciates too much. Aud/Usd is now under 0.7900 albeit off 0.7835 lows, while the Aud/Nzd cross has lost the 1.0800 handle and the Kiwi is back above 0.7300 vs the Greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core sovereign bonds have settled down somewhat after the opening mark-ups and follow on buying ahead of the start of EU cash equity trading. However, after a relatively pronounced pull-back in debt futures Bunds, Gilts and US Treasuries have rebounded again to reclaim healthy gains and a firm safe-haven premium. Clearly, investors and speculators are wary about the strength, conviction and sustainability of the recovery in EU stocks given the scale of the shake-out or rout on Wall Street that spilled over and spread to Asia/Pac bourses overnight. Note, the 10 year US T-note yield has retreated below the psychological 2.75% marker from around 2.88% at one stage in wake of last Friday&rsquo;s NFP data, so unwinding a fair degree of concession ahead of this week&rsquo;s increased Quarterly Refunding that could well be the next litmus test for fixed (independently of safe-haven impulses). On that note, more downside/bearish option trades have been implemented with 120-50 puts purchased again after 120-00 strikes on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, both WTI and Brent crude futures trade lower albeit off worst levels with prices suppressed by the ongoing global risk sentiment; the recovery for WTI has also been stalled by a failure to reclaim USD 64/bbl to the upside with energy newsflow otherwise relatively light ahead of tonight&rsquo;s API inventories. In metals markets, spot gold (+0.25%) continues to benefit from its safe-haven appeal and the softer USD despite the World Gold Council stating that demand for the yellow metal fell to its lowest level since 2009 during 2017. Elsewhere, base metals were seen notably lower overnight in-fitting with the lack of global risk appetite with nickel said to have led the complex lower.</p>\r\n",

The headline pair has rebounded above 109.00 vs circa 108.50 lows overnight and bids at that level extending down to 108.30, just ahead of strong technical support at 108.28. The cross has traded up to 136.75 from around 134.00 in Asia, as Eur/Usd reclaims 1.2400+ status and the DXY continues to struggle on recoveries above 89.6000 near term resistance (within an 89.720-370 range). Cable is back below 1.4000 and extending losses through 1.3980 &lsquo;support&rsquo; as Sterling succumbs to more UK political/Brexit uncertainty &ndash; Eur/Gbp up towards 0.8900. Usd/Chf is midway between 0.9300-0.9345 parameters and Usd/Cad edging back down towards 1.2500 having tested 1.2550+ levels when risk aversion was running rife (Dow crashing almost 1600 points for example). Elsewhere, some marked region-specific divergence in the Aud and Nzd, as the former was hit by disappointing data (weak retail sales and an unexpected trade deficit) plus some RBA concerns about wages, household consumption and the growth/inflation outlook, if the currency appreciates too much. Aud/Usd is now under 0.7900 albeit off 0.7835 lows, while the Aud/Nzd cross has lost the 1.0800 handle and the Kiwi is back above 0.7300 vs the Greenback.</p>\r\n",

With USD 46.6bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is seen at USD 21.4bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month&rsquo;s series of auctions comes at a key inflection point, with bonds selling-off aggressively at the beginning of the year.

Dealer take down was in line with recent averages, while directs took a slightly higher allocation, and indirects took a slightly lower allocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest positioning data (w/e 24 January) shows dealers have trimmed their long positions in the <2yrs sector to the lowest since early December, to USD 26bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The 3-year note appears to be trading slightly cheap on Treasury spline versus the off-the-run 3s compared with the previous two auction cycles,&rdquo; Societe Generale writes, &ldquo;the 3-year note is cheap on the fly with 2s3s5s, hitting -8.9bp last week, the highest level since December 2015, and it is currently trading at around the same value.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SocGen holds a positive bias going into the auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY (JANUARY AUCTION VS SIX-AUCTION AVERAGE):</strong><br />- High-yield: 2.08% (vs six-auction average of 1.729%)<br />- Tail: Stopped through 0.7bps (vs six-auction average stop-through of 0.1bps)<br />- Bid-to-cover: 3.13x (vs six-auction average of 2.95x)<br />- Dealers: 33.6% (vs six-auction average of 34.9%)<br />- Directs: 11.5% (vs six-auction average of 9.3%)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks continued the global equity sell-off and saw hefty losses across the board, as panic selling rolled over to the region following a slaughtering on Wall St. in which the DJIA tumbled nearly 1200 points and briefly slipped into correction territory. ASX 200 (-3.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-5.2%) slumped at the open in which losses in crude weighed on Australia&rsquo;s energy stocks, while the Japanese benchmark was the worst performer amid JPY strength and with the index in a technical correction. Hang Seng (-4.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.7%) were also heavily weighed amid the ongoing market turmoil and after the PBoC refrained again from liquidity operations. Finally. 10yr JGBs traded higher and tracked the gains in T-notes which were up over a point, as the ongoing stock market sell-off spurred a flight-to-quality and lifted bond across the curve which saw the Japanese 40yr yield drop to its lowest since April last year. Furthermore, today&rsquo;s 10yr inflation-indexed auction from Japan also attracted stronger demand and higher accepted prices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: Reserve Bank Of Australia Monetary Policy Decision Preview, Due At 03:30 GMT",
        "content": "<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will issue its first monetary policy decision of 2018 on Tuesday following a 2-month hiatus. Consensus looks for the central bank to keep its Cash Rate target unchanged at the record low of 1.50%, where it has stood since mid-2016, with only one of those surveyed by Reuters looking for a hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is reflected in ASX 30-Day interbank cash rate futures which have fully priced in no change this time out, while the OIS curve indicates little chance of any rate adjustments until November at the earliest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some analysts have also begun pushing back expectations for when the RBA will start lifting rates, following a bout of softer than expected data. This includes Q4 CPI in which the headline printed at 1.9% Y/Y vs. Exp. 2.0% (Prev. 1.8%), while the RBA&#39;s preferred trimmed mean reading stood at 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.9% (Prev. 1.8%), both below the central bank&#39;s 2%-3% target range, therefore restricting scope for tighter policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the latest building approvals data showed a significant contraction in December and although the employment change surpassed estimates in the labour market report from the same month, which was accompanied by an unexpected rise in the unemployment rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of rhetoric, there hasn&#39;t been much from the central bank since the most recent meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his final address of 2017 RBA Governor Philip Lowe noted that &ldquo;the continuing spare capacity in the economy and the subdued outlook for inflation mean that there is not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Board member Harper stated that there was a chance that the unemployment rate needs to fall below 5% before wages and inflation can respond accordingly, while he added that the current economic situation merits rates remaining supportive of the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, notorious RBA watcher McCrann has stated that the RBA will keep rates unchanged this week and indicated that it has no intention of changing rates, while he also pointed to stable inflation adding to the case for steady rates.<br /><br />With expectations for no change focus will turn to the accompanying statement for clues of future policy as any bias in its tone could impact AUD accordingly. Participants will also be eyeing any significant jawboning of the currency given its strength against the greenback which saw AUD/USD trade above 0.8100 in late January vs. the present 0.7600 at the last rate decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus will then move to Governor Lowe&rsquo;s speech on Thursday (09:00 GMT), and then onto the Bank&rsquo;s quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy on Friday (00:30 GMT).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the bank desks are saying: -</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ANZ:&nbsp;The coming week is very much about the RBA. Not only do we have the monthly Board meeting on Tuesday, but we also get the RBA&rsquo;s quarterly forecast update and policy statement on Friday, and the Governor is giving a speech on Thursday evening. All of which provides the RBA with plenty of opportunity to update its view. While the cash rate will remain on hold, we think the tone of the RBA commentary will be more upbeat after a positive run of data both domestically and globally. The higher AUD provides a bit of an offset and may see some refinement to the RBA&rsquo;s commentary around the currency, but its move in trade weighted terms since November is minimal and commodity prices are stronger so we don&rsquo;t think there will be that much concern about the impact of the higher AUD/USD. In terms of the RBA&rsquo;s forecasts the one substantive change we are looking for is a lower unemployment forecast. We think it is likely that the Bank will reduce the 2018 year-end forecast from 51&frasl;2% to 51&frasl;4% and predict 5% by the end of the forecast period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBA:&nbsp;Australian central bankers return from holidays this week with the first Board meeting of the year on Tuesday and the next Statement on Monetary Policy (SMP) on Friday. There is also a speech by RBA Governor Lowe, at the A50 Australian Economic Forum in Sydney on Thursday. A lengthy period of masterly inactivity has characterised interest rate settings. The last rate change was in August 2016. And newish RBA Governor Lowe is the only incumbent not to have changed rates in his first year in office. This track record should remain intact after the first Board meeting for 2018. The cash rate should remain firmly fixed at the record low of 1&frac12;%. The Board discussion will no doubt include: the recent upward revision to global growth forecasts by organisations such as the IMF and the World Bank; the stimulus from the Trump tax package; the ongoing resilience of key commodity prices; the surprising strength in the AUD (or should it be surprising weakness in the USD?); the turn towards rate rises in some major central banks (which the RBA was quick to emphasise has no automatic implications for monetary settings in Australia); the tendency for recent Australian data to surprise on the upside; a labour market that has now delivered an equal-record run of continuous job&rsquo;s growth (15 months); an unemployment rate not far off the 5% level that the RBA has nominated as full employment; improvements in business and consumer sentiment; the cooling housing market; upward revisions by the ABS to the level of household debt; and the absence of any real inflation pressures. Any Board member running their eye down this checklist would probably agree that the next move in interest rates is up. But they would also agree that there was no urgency to act. The Q4 CPI readings reinforced the point. The range of underlying or core measures printed below the bottom end of the RBA&rsquo;s 2-3% target band (again). The average of the various measures shows that the inflation rate has undershot the target for eight quarters. An analysis of the CPI basket shows prices of some 70% of items were growing at below 2%pa. Until fairly recently, such an outcome would have the debate on rate cuts hotting up and financial markets pricing for those cuts. But the residual case for another rate cut was pretty much gone by the start of 2017. It was apparent that growth prospects were OK, deflation risks were receding and the housing market was not cooling to the extent expected. By the end of 2017 the RBA&rsquo;s focus had clearly shifted towards a normalising economy. In fact, the RBA spent a fair amount of time in 2017 defining what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; meant for a selection of key economic indicators. Benchmarking the current economy against these normal parameters shows activity-type indicators closing in on normal. But inflation indicators still some way off. We expect the gap to close further during 2018 and as the economy normalises the case for normalising policy settings strengthens as well. One indicator to watch will be underemployment. Trends in this measure of labour market slack are important for the direction of wages and, ultimately, prices. The importance of underemployment is evident as well in its correlation with the RBA&rsquo;s cash rate. The currency also matters. The RBA has been relatively vocal on AUD trends and implications in recent years. Two things stand out about the RBA rhetoric on the AUD: concerns are most prominent when the AUD has diverged from the underlying fundamentals; and concerns are typically dialled down when the AUD moves into a USD0.70-0.75 band. We suspect the RBA is &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; with the Aussie in a USD0.70-0.75 range. Our forecasts have the AUD above the RBA&rsquo;s comfort zone in 2018. From a policy perspective this should mean that the RBA will prefer to lag any global tightening cycle. The hope would be to take the benefit in a currency that was lower than otherwise would be the case. We expect to see the start of a modest rate rise cycle on Melbourne Cup day. The increased sensitivity of households to changing interest rates will also influence the policy process. It should mean a drawn out rate rise cycle that peaks short of the 3&frac12;% neutral rate nominated by the RBA. We put the cash rate peak for this cycle at 2&frac12;% and don&rsquo;t expect to get there until early 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAB:&nbsp;While markets were not expecting the RBA to change its cash rate at Tuesday&rsquo;s board meeting, Wednesday&rsquo;s unsurprising CPI print, and the unemployment rate remaining elevated in December, has cemented that belief. What will be keenly watched is whether any other developments will change the RBA&rsquo;s view on the economy and policy going forward. As such, markets will be pouring over changes in the decision statement, Governor Phil Lowe&rsquo;s speech on Thursday, and the Statement of Monetary Policy (SoMP) on Friday, which include updated forecasts. The Governor&rsquo;s speech will probably not be market moving given the audience and the SoMP the next day. In its last SoMP, the RBA indicated ongoing uncertainty about the degree of slack in the labour market, inflation and consumption. While recent labour market data confirms strong employment growth over 2017 (+400 jobs!), unemployment has remained stubbornly elevated, at 5.5%. This rate is above the RBA&rsquo;s estimate of the NAIRIU, and is indicative of ongoing slack in the market. However, should participation rate stabilise, the unemployment rate would begin to fall, something we are looking for to occur in the coming months. The recent core inflation print of 0.4% q/q for the December quarter, brought trimmed mean inflation to 1.8%. While this number remains below the lower edge of the RBA&rsquo;s target of 2-3%, the RBA&rsquo;s forecasts show that the print was broadly expected by the Bank, and unlikely to significantly change the RBA&rsquo;s outlook. Inflation has stabilised and is gradually trending towards the RBA&rsquo;s target. As further strengthening in the labour market occurs, we expect inflation to rise to be comfortably back within the band over the medium term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Westpac:&nbsp;The RBA left interest rates unchanged throughout calendar 2017, Governor Lowe noting in his final speech of the year that: &quot;the continuing spare capacity in the economy and the subdued outlook for inflation mean that there is not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy&quot;. We expect the RBA to leave rates unchanged at its Feb meeting. Developments over the summer hiatus have been mixed with the Q3 national accounts disappointing but more positive news around global conditions, labour markets and confidence. Inflation remains subdued, with latest figures showing core inflation running at a 1.6% annual pace over the second half of 2017. There is also no new information around the Bank&#39;s key areas of uncertainty &ndash; the impact of lacklustre consumer demand; the extent to which weak labour income growth continues; and the risks around household debt. We expect consumer weakness to persist in 2018, leading the RBA to again leave rates on hold all year. We expect a 0.4% rise in the private sector Labour Cost Index for the December quarter. Wage growth has been running at the same quarterly pace for the last couple of years, aside from the 0.7% rise last quarter, which included the equal pay settlement for aged and disability care workers. We have no evidence to suggest there was a stirring of wage pressures in the December quarter. Indeed, the latest Westpac&ndash;McDermott Miller employment confidence survey found fewer workers reporting a rise in earnings over the last year. The Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) suggests a stronger rate of growth in hourly earnings. However, this measure is affected by changes in the composition of jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barclays: For the RBA cash rate, after a brief hiatus in January, we expect the central bank to take its cues from the inflation print and ongoing strength in the labour market, amid improving signs of consumption, to emphasise that the economic recovery remains on track</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HSBC:&nbsp;The RBA has, so far, been patient about waiting to see clear signs that wages growth is lifting before it considers raising its cash rate. We expect this to continue for the time being. We see the RBA as unlikely to change its domestic forecasts when they are published next week. The tone of the RBA&rsquo;s approach is likely to be similar to that conveyed by the Governor in a speech in November 2017 when he stated that &lsquo;if the economy continues to improve as expected, it is more likely that the next move in interest rates will be up, rather than down ... [but] ... the subdued outlook for inflation means that there is not a strong case for a near-term policy adjustment&rsquo;. On the positive side, the RBA is expected to point to the ongoing improvement in global economic conditions, which is supporting commodity prices, Australian exports and may filter through to local business investment. On the downside, the RBA is expected to point out that the recent lift in the AUD may be somewhat unhelpful for the growth and inflation outlook, although we do not think it will tangibly affect the RBA&rsquo;s central forecasts. Importantly, another factor that is likely to support the RBA&rsquo;s patient approach to lift-off is that the housing market has continued show signs of cooling over recent months On the margin, this may allow the RBA to be even more patient about lifting its cash rate from its current historically low level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBC:&nbsp;This is the first board meeting for 2018 following the usual January hiatus. There are three key developments since the board last met in early December. Firstly, global activity data continue to highlight momentum, with G7 central banks continuing to shift toward the removal of policy accommodation. Secondly, domestic employment data and key business surveys have been strong although inflation remains modest. Thirdly, AUD/USD has appreciated by ~6.5% and ~3.5% on a TWI basis. On balance, these developments point to upbeat and positive communication from the RBA next week, in line with the global central bank rhetoric, although there may be some caution around the currency. We expect no substantial changes to the key macro forecasts, which should continue to assume an eventual return to above-trend growth and within target inflation. In itself, however, this is noteworthy given the constant downward revisions to overly optimistic growth forecasts. No change to GDP forecasts would be a positive development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SocGen:&nbsp;Contained inflation and a relatively strong exchange rate suggest that there is little reason for the RBA to adjust the exceptionally accommodative policy stance in the near future. However, with prospects of solid growth at home and abroad &ndash; and an exceptionally strong labour market &ndash; the case for maintaining a policy rate that is negative in real terms is becoming progressively weaker. We therefore maintain the view that by the second half of next year the RBA too will begin to normalise its policy stance.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks continue the global equity sell-off to trade significantly lower across the board, as panic selling rolls over to the region following a slaughtering on Wall St. in which the DJIA tumbled nearly 1200 points and briefly slipped into correction territory. ASX 200 (-3.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-5.3%) slumped at the open with losses in crude weighing on Australia&rsquo;s energy stocks, while the Japanese benchmark is the worst performer amid JPY strength and with the index in a technical correction. Hang Seng (-4.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.9%) are also heavily weighed amid the ongoing market turmoil and with the PBoC continuing to refrain from liquidity operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively quiet overnight with focus centred on the collapse in the stock market. As such, safe-haven currencies are firmer with JPY boosted across the board and USD/JPY now below 109.00, while the greenback holds on to the prior day&rsquo;s gains against most counterparts with EUR/USD and GBP/USD languishing after giving up the 1.2400 and 1.4000 handles respectively. Elsewhere, AUD is subdued following disappointing Trade Balance and Retail Sales, while participants also await the RBA rate decision later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally. 10yr JGBs trade higher and track the gains in T-notes, as the ongoing stock market sell-off spurs a flight-to-quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
