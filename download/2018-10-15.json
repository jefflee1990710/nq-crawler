She stressed she cannot let the disagreement with Ireland leave the UK with a no-deal, adding that she does not want to see the backstop having to be used at all and she is working with the EU to ensure a backstop is time limited. She expects a UK-wide customs arrangement to end by December 2021, highlighting the government will not revoke Article 50. With regards to negotiations, the UK and EU called for a pause in discussions until Wednesday&#39;s summit; EU Diplomats stated that a deal was not reached on the weekend because the UK wants a UK-wide customs deal, and they are ready to restart talks when things calm down in London. Also, the EU was said to accept the UK backstop though clarifying it wants its own as well; it also wants its Irish backstop treaty to continue with its backstop as ultimate and fall-back guarantee. DUP&#39;s Wilson commented noting the EU&#39;s deal is worse than a no deal, and a no deal is inevitable thanks to the intransigence of the EU&#39;s negotiating position. Similarly, Irish PM Varadkar believes a Brexit deal still unlikely and he is not prepared to compromise on some things; he noted it may be December before a deal. In later comments, European Council President Tusk stated Brexit is more complicated than expected, urging the EU to prepare for no-deal scenario as such an outcome is more likely than it was before. He invited UK PM May to address remaining EU 27 member states on Wednesday night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Italy&#39;s PM Conte said Italy&#39;s cabinet has approved the 2019 budget, with the draft se to be sent to the Commission. He stressed the budget keeps the government&#39;s promises and keeps the public accounts in order. Italy&#39;s Economy Minister Tria stated the budget measures are all fully covered, and the budget allows early retirement and basic income tools. He denied plans to resign after the budget is approved in Parliament; he stressed expansionary measures are necessary to counter the slowdown of the economy in the next year and says the deficit target is normalising. He also thinks the idea that the budget can spark a crisis in Europe is &#39;totally unfounded&#39;. Finally, Italy&#39;s Deputy PM Di Maio noted the cuts are to &#39;privileges&#39; to fund income for the poor and announced citizens income to start in Q1 of 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US President Trump said he has a different feeling towards Turkey now, with the coming after the release of Pastor Brunson, but he reported to have not made a deal on sanctions. CNN reported&nbsp;Saudis to say Khashoggi died from botched interrogation and to say intent was to abduct him from Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RETAIL SALES</strong> rose 0.1% in September missing expectations at 0.6%, the control measure rose 0.5%, a tad above the 0.4% consensus whilst Ex-Autos fell 0.1%, missed the 0.4% expected. Overall the report was mixed with analysts at Wells Fargo noting that core spending remains strong though sales in bars and restaurants, which have been outperforming recently, posted a 1.8% decline. A 0.8% drop in gas stations&rsquo; sales also contributed to the headline miss. On the flip side, auto sales jumped 0.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Vasiliauskas said there is no reason as to why the ECB should not end asset purchases as planned. He noted discussion of rates could begin in the middle of next year, the rate decision could occur in Autumn 2019 if it is necessary. ECB Vice President de Guindos thinks the Eurozone will continue to grow at an above-trend rate; he noted growth risks have remained broadly balanced but global risks have become more prominent. Core inflation is moderate, but should rise. Risks include oil prices and the uncertainty from populism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.59% at 2750.78, NDX -1.24% at 7068.67, DJI -0.35% at 25250. SECTORS:</strong> Energy -0.82%, Materials -0.48%, Industrials +0.22%, Cons Discretionary -0.47%, Cons Staples +0.60%, Healthcare -0.77%, Financials -0.51%, Tech -1.64%, Telecoms -0.43%, Utilities +0.35%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Stock Specifics: </strong>Following the announcement of a merger of equals between defence names L3 Technologies (LLL) and Harris Corp (HRS), the two share prices jumped higher. Ralph Lauren (RL) was a top mover on the back of an upgrade at JPMorgan. Disney (DIS) moved higher following a price target rise at Morgan Stanley. American Airlines (AAL) and Altria Group (MO) were also other gainers on the day. Apple (AAPL) weighed down heavily on bourses today after Goldman Sachs said there were mounting signs that of rapidly slowing consumer demand in China, affecting iPhone sales. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) was a bottom mover, with some analysts attributing this to the co. not mentioning how its new video-game Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 did in physical sales, rather it just focused on digital sales. Bank of America (BAC) traded lower despite beating earnings estimates. Semiconductor co. NVIDIA (NVDA) was also down on the day, as was software developer Adobe (ADBE).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 0.44 HIGHER AT USD 71.78/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.35 HIGHER AT USD 80.78/BBL.</strong> Crude has been trading mixed around the neutral line on Monday, with the market focused on the situation of missing (anti-Saudi) journalist Jamal Kashoggi, with some suggestions that Saudi Arabia has played a part in his demise. However, those concerns eased slightly after the Saudi energy minister assured markets that the Kingdom will remain a reliable energy supplier to global markets; additionally, US President Trump seems to have given legitimacy to the Saudi denials of involvement, hinting that the US may be less willing to impose sanctions on key individuals in Saudi Arabia (for now). Nevertheless, questions remain around whether Saudi Arabia could use oil as a politicised weapon in the event international action was taken out against it. UBS points out that not since the 1970s has Saudi Arabia explicitly used oil production as a political bargaining chip, and notes that it has maintained oil sales to Canada during the recent diplomatic spat; UBS believes the KSA cutting oil output in response is unlikely: &quot;Saudi has no interest in causing a spike in the oil price that would once again incentivise the return of high cost producers who would threaten OPEC market share, and might ultimately threaten global oil demand,&quot; UBS wrote, &quot;However, with Saudi production of ~10.5mb/d underperforming both the target set following the OPEC meeting in June (+800kb/d by end July, implying 10.8mb/d) and the (lower) figure reported recently both by Saudi&#39;s Oil Minister and in an interview with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (10.7mb/d), the current dispute may provide a convenient excuse for Saudi to step away from targets it was having trouble achieving anyway.&quot; UBS also adds that the dispute over the journalist&#39;s disappearance is unlikely to be settled soon and &quot;it has introduced yet another variable that is more bullish than bearish for oil prices.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 6 TICKS LOWER AT 118-50. </strong>Treasuries were lower on Monday though action remained in a tight range, with mixed retail sales only giving the complex a temporary boost. Less volatility also contributed to yields moving upwards; yields across the curve were higher by c.2bps across the curve at settlement. 10s30s and 5s30s were wider by c.1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Greenback has been on the backfoot since the start of Monday&rsquo;s EU session, and retreated further ahead of early US data pretty much across the board. However, the DXY is striving to stay afloat of 95.000 from a low of 94.951 in wake of a conflicting retail sales report and uptick in Empire State manufacturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, NZD:</strong> Vying for top G10 spot and virtually neck-and-neck as the Franc bounces firmly from 0.9900+ levels vs the Usd and 1.1450+ vs the Eur to join the Kiwi on its approach towards 0.6550, the former shrugging off weaker Swiss producer and import price data and ongoing dovish SNB policy guidance, while the latter awaits NZ inflation data in the form of Q3 CPI that is forecast to be firmer than previous rates of 0.4% q/q and 1.5% y/y.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD:</strong> The next best major and almost keeping pace with its antipodean peer, but capped ahead of 0.7150 vs the Usd, as the Aud/Nzd cross drifted down further from recent peaks towards 1.0900. Somewhat mixed impulses for the Aussie with ongoing US-China trade angst cushioned to an extent by a rise in metals prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, EUR:</strong> Also benefiting from general Usd weakness, but the Jpy also getting a safe-haven boost overnight amidst declines across Asia-Pacific bourses, while the latter overcame or withstood more Italian budget jitters to bounce off sub-1.1550 lows. However, decent option expiry interest also influenced both headline pairs as Usd/Jpy held above 1 bn between 111.40-55 and Eur/Usd under 1.2 bn from 1.1600-15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, CAD: </strong>Relative underperformers with Cable floating around 1.3150 after an attempted recovery from sub-1.3100 lows stalled ahead of 1.3200, and Eur/Gbp re-testing 0.8800 on a breakdown in Brexit negotiations ahead of this week&rsquo;s EU Summit. The key sticking point remains Ireland and the UK&rsquo;s determination to avoid a hard border vs the EU reportedly willing to accept the back-stop only on the basis that it includes a separate and ultimate fall-back guarantee. The Loonie broke below 1.3000 vs. the Usd following the release of the BoC Outlook Survey, conducted prior to USMCA agreement, which noted that capacity pressures fell slightly but pressures remain elevated and broad-based.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM:</strong> Extended gains for the likes of the Lira, Rand, Rouble and Real, partly due to the aforementioned Dollar downturn, but also on the back of ongoing relief and retracement.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback has been on the backfoot since the start of Monday&rsquo;s EU session, and retreated further ahead of early US data pretty much across the board. However, the DXY is striving to stay afloat of 95.000 from a low of 94.951 in wake of a conflicting retail sales report and uptick in Empire State manufacturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/NZD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vying for top G10 spot and virtually neck-and-neck as the Franc bounces firmly from 0.9900+ levels vs the Usd and 1.1450+ vs the Eur to join the Kiwi on its approach towards 0.6550, the former shrugging off weaker Swiss producer and import price data and ongoing dovish SNB policy guidance, while the latter awaits NZ inflation data in the form of Q3 CPI that is forecast to be firmer than previous rates of 0.4% q/q and 1.5% y/y.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best major and almost keeping pace with its antipodean peer, but capped ahead of 0.7150 vs the Usd, as the Aud/Nzd cross drifted down further from recent peaks towards 1.0900. Somewhat mixed impulses for the Aussie with ongoing US-China trade angst cushioned to an extent by a rise in metals prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also benefiting from general Usd weakness, but the Jpy also getting a safe-haven boost overnight amidst declines across Asia-Pacific bourses, while the latter overcame or withstood more Italian budget jitters to bounce off sub-1.1550 lows. However, decent option expiry interest also influenced both headline pairs as Usd/Jpy held above 1 bn between 111.40-55 and Eur/Usd under 1.2 bn from 1.1600-15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative underperformers with Cable slipping back below 1.3150 after an attempted recovery from sub-1.3100 lows stalled ahead of 1.3200, and Eur/Gbp never really re-testing 0.8800 bids support or a 1 bn expiry on a breakdown in Brexit negotiations ahead of this week&rsquo;s EU Summit. The key sticking point remains Ireland and the UK&rsquo;s determination to avoid a hard border vs the EU reportedly willing to accept the back-stop only on the basis that it includes a separate and ultimate fall-back guarantee. Next up, PM May is due to brief parliament on the latest state of play from 15.30BST. Also up at the base of the hour, Q3&rsquo;s BoC Business Outlook, with the Loonie looking cautious in advance towards the low end of 1.3005-50 parameters vs its US counterpart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extended gains for the likes of the Lira, Rand, Rouble and Real, partly due to the aforementioned Dollar downturn, but also on the back of ongoing relief and retracement.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.0%) slumped from the open as financials and tech led the broad losses which dragged the index briefly below the 5800 level, while Nikkei 225 (-1.9%) suffered from continued flows into the JPY. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp.

Source reports suggested that all negotiations between UK and EU are on hold with the UK government reportedly telling ministers to begin &#39;no deal&#39; implementation plans after last-ditch discussions broke up. (Times/Newswires) The breakdown in talks came after UK PM May refused to endorse a draft Brexit deal negotiated by UK and EU officials on Sunday night amid concerns the Cabinet would refuse to support the plan. UK PM May labelled the draft Brexit agreement a &#39;non-starter&#39; in its current form and advisers are reportedly trying to craft new language for the Brexit withdrawal agreement amid signs the Cabinet will otherwise refuse to agree to PM May&rsquo;s backstop proposals. Furthermore, it was also reported that EU leaders may not call for a special summit next month amid lack of progress. (Telegraph/FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU leaders are set to hold an extraordinary &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit summit with a date pencilled in for the weekend of 17-18 November, to deal with the potential disaster of the UK crashing out of the bloc should PM May fail to deliver decisive progress on the Irish border issue this week.

Writing to the Sunday Times, he called UK PM May&rsquo;s plan &ldquo;flawed&rdquo; and &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo;, while he accused the PM&rsquo;s aides of &ldquo;incipient panic&rdquo; in the face of Brussel&rsquo;s demands and trying to cut out the cabinet from key decisions. (The Times/BBC/Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple Labour MPs told The Independent that they are prepared to support the Brexit agreement UK PM May hopes to bring back from Brussels, while the newspaper was also told that at least 15 Labour MPs could rebel against Labour leader Corbyn and back the government, which could be enough to tip the balance in the Commons in favour of a deal.

In other news, President Trump was reportedly unsure whether Defense Secretary Mattis will step down and suggested that Mattis was a sort of a Democrat. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that no decision has been made yet regarding a meeting between US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 in Argentina, while Mnuchin also suggested the US would like to include currency stipulations in future trade agreements with everyone.

From a technical perspective, 111.50 will be eyed next on the downside as a psychological marker and 50% Fib, roughly aligning with daily support around 111.47 plus decent option expiry interest between 111.55-40 (1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - At the opposite end of the spectrum, the Pound has been undermined by a breakdown in talks between the UK and EU just days ahead of the latest scheduled Brexit summit that may now take the form of a no deal meeting given the ongoing Irish border impasse.

Usd/Chf pivoting 0.9900 and Eur/Chf encircling 1.1450, as the single currency trades in a relatively narrow band either side of 1.1550 vs the Dollar.

Meanwhile, Bunds have also lost some momentum after hitting some technical resistance at the early Eurex apex (158.84-87 flagged on some charts) and recently retreated to another low at 158.57 (+4 ticks), as US Treasuries remain depressed and the curve steeper in the run up to retail sales data.</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, Bunds have also lost some momentum after hitting some technical resistance at the early Eurex apex (158.84-87 flagged on some charts) and recently retreated to another low at 158.57 (+4 ticks), as US Treasuries remain depressed and the curve steeper in the run up to retail sales data.</p>\r\n",

From a technical perspective, 111.50 will be eyed next on the downside as a psychological marker and 50% Fib, roughly aligning with daily support around 111.47 plus decent option expiry interest between 111.55-40 (1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, the Pound has been undermined by a breakdown in talks between the UK and EU just days ahead of the latest scheduled Brexit summit that may now take the form of a no deal meeting given the ongoing Irish border impasse. Cable has managed to regain some composure and recoup losses under 1.3100, but Eur/Gbp is holding above 0.8800 where a hefty expiry lies (1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best majors and both extending gains above big figures at 0.6500 and 0.7100 respectively despite the aforementioned sell-off in equities overnight and Cnh weakness after a relatively stable Usd/Cny midpoint fix from the PBoC. Some support for the antipodean Dollars from firm commodity prices (oil and metals), while the Kiwi awaits NZ CPI data for Q3 later amidst expectations for a pick-up in headline inflation in q/q and y/y terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR/CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback that has eased off recent recovery highs (DXY back down towards 95.150 vs almost 95.400 at one stage), with the Franc not unduly ruffled by soft Swiss producer and import prices or latest comments from SNB chair Jordan stressing no need to adjust monetary policy and maintaining the option of direct intervention given the fragility of currency markets. Usd/Chf pivoting 0.9900 and Eur/Chf encircling 1.1450, as the single currency trades in a relatively narrow band either side of 1.1550 vs the Dollar. Note, the headline pair also has option expiries nearby with 1 bn running off from 1.1550-60, plus 1.2 bn on any break to 1.1500 or 1.1600-15. Elsewhere, the Loonie sits towards the top of a tight 1.3010-35 range and eyeing the BoC&#39;s Qr Business outlook and loan survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Try remains bid just off 5.8160 peaks vs the Usd on follow-through buying/relief in wake of the release of US Pasto Brunson, while the Rub and Zar are also up vs the Buck (circa 65.6500 and 14.4500) on firm Brent and Gold.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets resumed last week&rsquo;s stock rout as the region failed to take impetus from Friday&rsquo;s rebound on Wall St where tech outperformed and all majors finished a tumultuous session in the green, albeit with losses of around 4% on the week. ASX 200 (-0.8%) slumped from the open as financials and tech led the broad losses which dragged the index briefly below the 5800 level, while Nikkei 225 (-1.5%) suffered from continued flows into the JPY. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) and Hang Seng (-1.2%) conformed to the negative tone with sentiment not helped by President Trump&rsquo;s reiteration that the US may have to impose another round of tariffs on China, with indecision seen in the mainland after the PBoC skipped open market operations and refrained from rolling over maturing MLF loans as its previously announced 100bps RRR cut took effect. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured at the open and tracked the recent weakness in T-notes, but then recovered as the widespread risk averse tone spurred safe-haven demand.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.1%) slumped from the open with financials and tech leading the broad losses which dragged the index briefly below the 5800 level, while Nikkei 225 (-1.4%) suffers from continued flows into the JPY. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (-1.2%) conform to the negative tone with sentiment not helped by President Trump&rsquo;s reiteration that the US may have to impose another round of tariffs on China, although the mainland index is choppy after the PBoC skipped open market operations and refrained from rolling over maturing MLF loans as its previously announced 100bps RRR cut took effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly firmer and continues its rebound from support at the 95.00 level as its major counterparts trade subdued with EUR/USD little changed below 1.1600, while GBP/USD underperforms and briefly tested 1.3100 to the downside on a lack of a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations with UK and EU negotiators calling for a pause in discussions until Wednesday&#39;s summit outcome. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY crosses remain pressured from safe-haven flows which saw the pair test 112.00 to the downside, while antipodeans are somewhat unchanged alongside a relatively stable CNH and PBoC reference rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs gapped lower at the open to track the weakness in T-notes, but then recovered as the widespread risk averse tone spurred safe-haven demand.</p>\r\n",
