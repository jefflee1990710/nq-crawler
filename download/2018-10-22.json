In terms of the process, 15% of Tory lawmakers (amounting to 48 MPs) are required to submit letters of no confidence, after which a majority of Tory MPs will be required to vote against the government in a confidence motion (amounting to 159 MPs).

The Backbench 1922 committee is set to meet on Wednesday, and lawmakers will vote on the Northern Ireland Bill amendments on Wednesday too.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />* <strong>ITALY: </strong>The EU is on Tuesday expected to take the unprecedented decision of rejecting Italy&#39;s budget plan and requesting it resubmit a draft budget, according to an Italian government official cited by Reuters. EU Commissioner Moscovici stated he has questions on the budget, adding that the nation&#39;s structural deficit was too high. Moscovici once again struck a constructive tone, suggesting that he does not want a crisis with Italy. Deputy PM Di Maio also continued his constructive tone, arguing that if the budget was rejected, there will still be &#39;weeks&#39; to discuss the matter with them; the Italian PM Conte said the 2.4% deficit figure was a maximum ceiling, and Italy was committed to bringing in its deficit. The constructive tone out of Italians (the willingness to discuss with the EU) follows comments from Di Maio and Conte in recent days, where both stated they were committed to Italy remaining within the Eurozone.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* TRADE: </strong>China government official Zhang Qingli reportedly told US investors that &quot;China never wants a trade war with anybody, not to mention the US who has been a long-term strategic partner, but we also do not fear such a war&quot;. Elsewhere, Mexico Deputy Economy Minister said Mexico hasn&#39;t ruled out all possible actions against Canada vis-a-vis steel tariffs including going to the WTO whilst Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland noted US steel and aluminium tariffs are &lsquo;unjustified and illegal&rsquo;. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* CHICAGO FED&#39;S NATIONAL ACTIVITY INDEX</strong>, which is a weighted average of 85 existing monthly indicators of economic activity, stood at 0.17 in Q3 from Prev. 0.18. Note that anything above zero indicates above trend growth therefore consistent with 3% real GDP growth, according to&nbsp;Renaissance Macro.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* SPX -0.4% at 2756, NDX +0.5% at 7141, DJI -0.5% at 25316. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -1.1%, Materials -0.9%, Industrials -0.2%, Cons Discretionary +0.6%, Cons Staples -0.7%, Healthcare -0.7%, Financials -2.0%, Tech +0.9%, Telecoms +0.1%, Utilities -0.6%. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) were top movers on the day on the back of upgrades at UBS and Nomura respectively. Jacob&rsquo;s Engineering (JEC) traded higher after a sale of its ECR unit for USD 3.3bln. Praxair (PX), alongside with Linde (LIN GY), were gainers after their merger was approved by the FTC and meeting its conditions. Chinabased stocks also found some revival with names such as Ctrip.com (CTRP), Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD) all up. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and eBay (EBAY) fell on the day following downgrades at Citi and BofA/Merrill respectively. Hasbro (HAS) was a bottom mover after missing EPS and revenue estimates this morning. Halliburton (HAL) traded lower on the back of reporting a slowdown in its North America oil &amp; gas unit and lowering its Q4 EPS guidance below estimates.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 0.05 HIGHER AT USD 69.17/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.05 HIGHER AT USD 79.83/BBL. </strong>Overnight risk-on inspired by China&rsquo;s fiscal announcement took crude to highs just over $80 (Brent, Z8) and WTI to within touching distance of $70. However, as the US entered, and USD strength kicked-in, crude tracked risk sentiment lower, with traders also citing comments from the Saudi energy minister (production will be raised by 300k BPD to 11mln BPD &ldquo;soon&rdquo;), adding that the Kingdom is able to raise production to 12mln BPD. In Libya, the NOC chair said production was able to be raised by &ldquo;hundreds of thousands of barrels per day&rdquo;, and production was currently running at a clip of 1mln BPD, despite regional security issues. This week, analysts are expecting crude stocks to build by 3.6mln, Cushing stocks are seen building by 1.1mln (vs 12/Oct), distillates are expected to draw by 2.4mln BPD, and gasoline is seen drawing 1.8mln. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 1+ TICKS HIGHER AT 118-00.</strong> The Treasury complex was confined to a narrow range on Monday, ahead of this week&rsquo;s supply of 2s, 5s, 7s and a 2yr FRN. Highs were hit in the European day as political concerns in Europe dominated news flow (Italy, UK), but drifted sideways after the US entered. Major spreads were mixed. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* TREASURY SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 127bln in 2-year (USD 38bln, Tuesday), 5-year (USD 39bln, Wednesday), 7-year (USD 31bln, Thursday), as well a 2-year FRN (USD 19bln, Wednesday). With around USD 110.7bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, the auctions will raise USD 16.3bln in new cash, TD Securities notes; the bank also&nbsp;points out that the Fed&#39;s balance sheet run-off will get into full swing this month, with the cap rising to USD 30bln (though USD 23.8bln in Fed holdings will mature), and TD says that the Fed will therefore allow the entire amount to run off and will not add on to any auctions this month.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* 2-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>Recent auctions in the 2year have come in near the 1pm when-issued yield, though the previous auction saw a larger tail due to foreign participation falling to approximately half the typical average at 6.6%, and as such, analysts and traders will be keeping an eye on foreign demand, which if it raises back towards typical levels, could provide support. The recent move higher in yields has certainly made investors nervous, but has also increased the attractiveness of short-dated Treasuries,&quot; TD Securities writes. &quot;We view 2-year Treasury yields in the vicinity of 3% as attractive from a longer-term perspective, particularly with the market already pricing in 80% odds of a December hike, two more hikes in 2019 and a terminal funds rate around 2.9%.&quot; TD also believes that the front-end and belly of the curve &quot;similarly look attractive amid the recent backup in rates.&quot;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* GBP: </strong>The ongoing uncertainty around the Baker&rsquo;s amendment which was then withdrawn plus potential extension to the transition period has undermined Sterling across the board with Cable back under 1.3000 and Eur/Gbp testing 0.8850 again.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* NZD, EUR, AUD: </strong>All down vs the Usd, with the Kiwi slipping a bit further from 0.6600+ peaks seen overnight and the single currency losing grip of the 1.1500 handle having topped out circa 1.1550 in wake of a sharp relief rally in Italian markets following limited ratings action from Moody&rsquo;s post-close on Friday (cut to Baa3 from Baa2, but not into junk territory and outlook stable). Eur/Usd held near decent option expiry interest at the big figure for a while, but not long enough to trigger 1.5 bn at the strike and is now close to 1.1470. Returning down under, the Aud was pressured throughout Monday&rsquo;s session after the Government lost Sydney&rsquo;s Wentworth by-election over the weekend and its majority in the process. Aud/Usd below 0.7100 as a result.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* CHF, CAD, JPY: </strong>Relative outperformers, or at least showing some resilience vs a recovering Greenback, with the DXY crossing 96.000 again compared to sub-95.500 at one stage, as the Franc holds above parity and the Loonie contained losses under 1.3100, even though Canadian wholesale trade slowed sharply. The Cad also coped well with another downturn in crude prices ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC policy with a &frac14; point hike virtually priced in. Usd/Jpy rallied when sentiment was risk-on, but waned ahead of 113.00 (or 112.90 to be precise) and is now back below a key Fib again (112.74).&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* EM: </strong>Outperformance for the Rand, as Usd/Zar trades under 14.3000 ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s MTBS amidst press reports noting improved budget revenues relative to 2017 and more on track with forecasts. Elsewhere, the Rouble is outpacing the Lira in the run up to this week&rsquo;s CBR and CBT meetings, while the Yuans are on the back foot again just off 6.9500.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

However, as the US entered, and USD strength kicked-in, crude tracked risk sentiment lower, with traders also citing comments from the Saudi energy minister (production will be raised by 300k BPD to 11mln BPD &ldquo;soon&rdquo;), adding that the Kingdom is able to raise production to 12mln BPD. In Libya, the NOC chair said production was able to be raised by &ldquo;hundreds of thousands of barrels per day&rdquo;, and production was currently running at a clip of 1mln BPD, despite regional security issues. This week, analysts are expecting crude stocks to build by 3.6mln, Cushing stocks are seen building by 1.1mln (vs 12/Oct), distillates are expected to draw by 2.4mln BPD, and gasoline is seen drawing 1.8mln.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound has been hit hard in the run up to a parliament speech from PM May (due circa 15.30BST) amidst reports that she will announce 95% progress towards a Brexit withdrawal deal and underline her opposition to an Irish back-stop. However, the DUP is said to be lining up behind Tory Eurosceptics with an amendment on Wednesday that essentially rules out the latter as a legal entity, and the ongoing uncertainty plus potential extension to the transition period has undermined Sterling across the board with Cable back under 1.3000 and Eur/Gbp testing 0.8850 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/EUR/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All around 0.25-0.3% down vs the Usd, with the Kiwi slipping a bit further from 0.6600+ peaks seen overnight and the single currency losing grip of the 1.1500 handle having topped out circa 1.1550 in wake of a sharp relief rally in Italian markets following limited ratings action from Moody&rsquo;s post-close on Friday (cut to Baa3 from Baa2, but not into junk territory and outlook stable). Eur/Usd held near decent option expiry interest at the big figure for a while, but not long enough to trigger 1.5 bn at the strike and is now close to 1.1470. Returning down under, the Aud was pressured throughout Monday&rsquo;s session after the Government lost Sydney&rsquo;s Wentworth by-election over the weekend and its majority in the process. Aud/Usd below 0.7100 as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative outperformers, or at least showing some resilience vs a recovering Greenback, with the DXY crossing 96.000 again compared to sub-95.500 at one stage, as the Franc holds above parity and the Loonie contained losses under 1.3100, even though Canadian wholesale trade slowed sharply. The Cad also coped well with another downturn in crude prices ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC policy with a &frac14; point hike virtually priced in. Usd/Jpy rallied when sentiment was risk-on, but waned ahead of 113.00 (or 112.90 to be precise) and is now back below a key Fib again (112.74).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outperformance for the Rand, as Usd/Zar trades under 14.3000 ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s MTBS amidst press reports noting improved budget revenues relative to 2017 and more on track with forecasts. Elsewhere, the Rouble is outpacing the Lira in the run up to this week&rsquo;s CBR and CBT meetings, while the Yuans are on the back foot again just off 6.9500.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.58%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.37%) were both initially lower with Australia dampened by political uncertainty as PM Morrison&rsquo;s governing coalition is on track to lose its 1-seat parliamentary majority following a by election in eastern Sydney, while the early downbeat tone was also attributed to geopolitical concerns after Trump announced the US would leave the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. However, most of the losses in the region were later pared as the Shanghai Comp. (+4.09%) surged on a rebound from 4-year lows which inspired the Hang Seng (+2.32%), while officials were also conducive to the risk sentiment in which President Xi reiterated unwavering commitment to the private sector, China released its draft of tax cuts and the PBoC announced a liquidity injection of CNY 120bln.

I think we are the closest ever to her going&rdquo;, in reference to the 48 letters needed to trigger a vote of no confidence, as this MP wants a comfortable margin above that, so that the PM can see that a sizeable number of her colleagues want her to go.

(Mail on Sunday)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan wrote a piece in the Sunday Times suggesting that &ldquo;The only way to resolve the present impasse is either to station the prime minister and Dominic Raab, her Brexit secretary, permanently in Brussels until a compromise is found &mdash; or to stand back, take a long, hard look at both the substance and perspective of the negotiations, and press the reset button&rdquo;. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Governor Carney said the BoE is focusing on the possible consequences of a cliff-edge Brexit and that in preparing for Brexit outcomes, the central bank is preparing for the worst-case scenarios rather than hoping for the best.

However, as EU Commissioner Moscovici struck a positive, constructive tone, flows moved back into risk, allowing the T-Note to move lower and settle into a range. Despite the higher yields, major curve spreads flattened by 0.5-1.5bps. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 6 ticks lower at 117-30+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump reportedly has no intention of relaxing tariffs against China and is said to want Chinese leaders to suffer which he thinks would give him more leverage in future discussions. In other news, US President Trump said they are studying a major tax reduction for middle-income citizens which they will provide details of next month. (Axios/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is said to be open to changing the test on how US determines currency manipulators which opens the possibility for China to be named a manipulator and in turn could be used as leverage in trade discussions. In other news, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin&#39;s team reportedly told China there is no point in floating plans to buy US products as key priorities need to be addressed such as structural issues including IP theft and market access.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, dove) said two or three more rate hikes would take the Fed to neutral and that he is not committed on the need to raise above neutral levels which will depend on productivity. Kaplan also commented that the US economy is &#39;basically&#39; meeting the Fed&#39;s dual mandate on employment and inflation and he is skeptical about further US wage growth from current levels, while he also noted that current market gyrations are not a concern and that corrections can be &#39;healthy&#39; in addressing imbalances.

The FTSE MIB leads the gains following a Moody&#39;s Italy downgrade to one level above junk, which was less than some had anticipated. Italian banks, such as Intesa Sanpaolo (+1.0%) are supported a result of this; however, the index is being led by gains in Fiat Chrysler (+5.0%) after the confirmation of their Magnetti Marelli unit sale to KKR for EUR 6.2bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sectors are mostly in positive territory, with the exception of healthcare and energy. Consumer discretionary and financials are some of the best performers with the former supported&nbsp;by car names moving sympathy to Fiat Chrysler, while the latter is buoyed by Italian banks after the FTSE MIB Banking Index opened higher by over 3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of individual equities, the aforementioned Phillips are at the foot of the Stoxx 600. Danone (-1.3%) are lower after the CEO stated that they are not going to bid for Horlicks. Lloyds Banking Group (+2.0%) are in the green following the Co&rsquo;s plans to buy back around GDP 2bln of shares in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has been encouraged by events in Rome, and specifically the fact that Italy escaped a deeper ratings cut by Moody&rsquo;s to stay one rung above junk. BTPs and Italian stocks have rallied in response or rather in relief, and Eur/Usd is back above 1.1500 as a result, albeit off best levels having faded around 1.1550 and clearing its 10 DMA at 1.1527 along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/GBP/NZD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the DXY pivots 95.500 within a relatively tight 95.756-469 range, and the Loonie straddles 1.3100 ahead of Canadian wholesale trade data and then the BoC policy meeting on Thursday with a 25 bp hike pretty much factored in. The Franc is also anchored and confined around 0.9950, while Cable nudged higher alongside Eur/Usd earlier, but topped out ahead of 1.3100 and last Friday&rsquo;s 1.3105 high to sit just above 1.3050, awaiting more from UK PM May on Brexit. The Kiwi has drifted back below 0.6600 having lost some pre-weekend event risk premium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY - Both underperforming vs G10 counterparts, the former on domestic political developments as the Government lost its slender majority by virtue of failing to retain its seat at the Sydney by-election. However, Aud/Usd is just holding above 0.7100 in wake of a short squeeze in Chinese equities overnight, which in contrast has weighed on the Jpy as a safe-haven proxy, with Usd/Jpy climbing above a key 112.74 Fib towards 112.90 vs sub-112.50 at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCANDI - Nok and Sek maintaining positive momentum before Norges and Riksbank policy convenes that are both seen underscoring hawkish policy guidance, and the former potentially signalling a December rate hike rather than the option to delay until February 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Early Monday/week outperformance for the Rand, as Usd/Zar trade under 14.3000 ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s MTBS amidst press reports noting improved budget revenues relative to 2017 and more on track with forecasts. Elsewhere, the Rouble is outpacing the Lira in the run up to this week&rsquo;s CBR and CBT meetings, with the Rub deriving some support from a rebound in Brent to just over Usd 80/brl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both WTI and Brent are easing off intra-day highs with the former hovering around USD 69.50/bbl while the latter retests USD 80.00/bbl to the downside. Early in the session, Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih emerged stating the kingdom&nbsp;has no intentions to use oil as a weapon, while he added he cannot guarantee prices won&#39;t rise above USD 100/bbl. Elsewhere, on Friday the Baker Hughes rig count showed an additional 4 oil rigs in operations,&nbsp;rising to the highest figure since March 2015, applying downward pressure on prices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold trades lower as the yellow metal mirrors moves in the dollar, albeit&nbsp;still at levels close to its 2-month peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of metals China&rsquo;s winter anti-pollution restrictions are beginning to take an effect with this expected to boost the demand for high grade iron ore as producers priorities the best quality iron, lowering the overall market supply of iron ore, with prices currently at&nbsp;USD 71/tonne. Separately, China has introduced a system which allows for faster customs clearance for some imported ores, including iron ore which China are the world&rsquo;s biggest importer of. Copper prices have continued to rise following a pledge from China&rsquo;s central bank that it would support firms which have liquidity problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian Energy Minister Zenganeh said that Saudi Arabia and Russia&#39;s crude output are near their highest ever levels and added that Saudi Arabia and Russia have no spare oil capacity. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said he cannot guarantee oil prices will not rise above USD 100/bbl and Saudi production is likely to increase in the near future to 11mln BPD, adding new OPEC+ oil agreement might be signed on Dec 7th. He added if 3mln BPD of oil supplies disappear in 2019, Saudi cannot cover this volume and will have to use reserves. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10 year Italian debt future and equivalent cash yield may have run into resistance and support respectively, at the aforementioned 122.74 level and circa 3.30%, or simply just lost momentum having rebounded and retreated so far from last Friday&rsquo;s lows and highs. However, some sense of realism could also have set in as Rome still has to submit its official response to the EU and receive the verdict, while the sovereign rate was cut even if junk was just avoided. Whatever the reason or catalyst, BTPs are back below 122.00 and closer to mid-range between 121.01-122.74, while Bunds and Gilts have both regained composure and recently clawed their way up to fresh Eurex and Liffe intraday highs of 159.20 and 121.12 (-20 ticks and -1 tick vs -56 and -33 ticks at worst). Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain largely side-lined and the curve fractionally flatter. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The FTSE MIB leads the gains following a Moody&#39;s Italy downgrade to one level above junk, which was less than some had anticipated. Italian banks, such as Intesa Sanpaolo (+1.0%) are supported a result of this; however, the index is being led by gains in Fiat Chrysler (+5.0%) after the confirmation of their Magnetti Marelli unit sale to KKR for EUR 6.2bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sectors are mostly in positive territory, with the exception of healthcare and energy. Consumer discretionary and financials are some of the best performers with the former supported&nbsp;by car names moving sympathy to Fiat Chrysler, while the latter is buoyed by Italian banks after the FTSE MIB Banking Index opened higher by over 3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of individual equities the aforementioned Phillips are at the foot of the Stoxx 600. Danone (-1.3%) are lower after the CEO stated that they are not going to bid for Horlicks. Lloyds Banking Group (+2.0%) are in the green following the Co&rsquo;s plans to buy back around GDP 2bln of shares in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has been encouraged by events in Rome, and specifically the fact that Italy escaped a deeper ratings cut by Moody&rsquo;s to stay one rung above junk. BTPs and Italian stocks have rallied in response or rather in relief, and Eur/Usd is back above 1.1500 as a result, albeit off best levels having faded around 1.1550 and clearing its 10 DMA at 1.1527 along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/GBP/NZD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the DXY pivots 95.500 within a relatively tight 95.756-469 range, and the Loonie straddles 1.3100 ahead of Canadian wholesale trade data and then the BoC policy meeting on Thursday with a 25 bp hike pretty much factored in. The Franc is also anchored and confined around 0.9950, while Cable nudged higher alongside Eur/Usd earlier, but topped out ahead of 1.3100 and last Friday&rsquo;s 1.3105 high to sit just above 1.3050, awaiting more from UK PM May on Brexit. The Kiwi has drifted back below 0.6600 having lost some pre-weekend event risk premium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY - Both underperforming vs G10 counterparts, the former on domestic political developments as the Government lost its slender majority by virtue of failing to retain its seat at the Sydney by-election. However, Aud/Usd is just holding above 0.7100 in wake of a short squeeze in Chinese equities overnight, which in contrast has weighed on the Jpy as a safe-haven proxy, with Usd/Jpy climbing above a key 112.74 Fib towards 112.90 vs sub-112.50 at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCANDI - Nok and Sek maintaining positive momentum before Norges and Riksbank policy convenes that are both seen underscoring hawkish policy guidance, and the former potentially signalling a December rate hike rather than the option to delay until February 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Early Monday/week outperformance for the Rand, as Usd/Zar trade under 14.3000 ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s MTBS amidst press reports noting improved budget revenues relative to 2017 and more on track with forecasts. Elsewhere, the Rouble is outpacing the Lira in the run up to this week&rsquo;s CBR and CBT meetings, with the Rub deriving some support from a rebound in Brent to just over Usd 80/brl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10 year Italian debt future and equivalent cash yield may have run into resistance and support respectively, at the aforementioned 122.74 level and circa 3.30%, or simply just lost momentum having rebounded and retreated so far from last Friday&rsquo;s lows and highs. However, some sense of realism could also have set in as Rome still has to submit its official response to the EU and receive the verdict, while the sovereign rate was cut even if junk was just avoided. Whatever the reason or catalyst, BTPs are back below 122.00 and closer to mid-range between 121.01-122.74, while Bunds and Gilts have both regained composure and recently clawed their way up to fresh Eurex and Liffe intraday highs of 159.20 and 121.12 (-20 ticks and -1 tick vs -56 and -33 ticks at worst). Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain largely side-lined and the curve fractionally flatter. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both WTI and Brent are easing off intra-day highs with the former hovering around USD 69.50/bbl while the latter retests USD 80.00/bbl to the downside. Early in the session, Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih emerged stating the kingdom&nbsp;has no intentions to use oil as a weapon, while he added he cannot guarantee prices won&#39;t rise above USD 100/bbl. Elsewhere, on Friday the Baker Hughes rig count showed an additional 4 oil rigs in operations,&nbsp;rising to the highest figure since March 2015, applying downward pressure on prices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold trades lower as the yellow metal mirrors moves in the dollar, albeit&nbsp;still at levels close to it&rsquo;s 2 month peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of metals China&rsquo;s winter anti-pollution restrictions are beginning to take an effect with this expected to boost the demand for high grade iron ore as producers priorities the best quality iron, lowering the overall market supply of iron ore, with prices currently at&nbsp;USD 71/tonne. Separately, China has introduced a system which allows for faster customs clearance for some imported ores, including iron ore which China are the world&rsquo;s biggest importer of. Copper prices have continued to rise following a pledge from China&rsquo;s central bank that it would support firms which have liquidity problems.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has been encouraged by events in Rome, and specifically the fact that Italy escaped a deeper ratings cut by Moody&rsquo;s to stay one rung above junk. BTPs and Italian stocks have rallied in response or rather in relief, and Eur/Usd is back above 1.1500 as a result, albeit off best levels having faded around 1.1550 and clearing its 10 DMA at 1.1527 along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/GBP/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the DXY pivots 95.500 within a relatively tight 95.756-469 range, and the Loonie straddles 1.3100 ahead of Canadian wholesale trade data and then the BoC policy meeting on Thursday with a 25 bp hike pretty much factored in. The Franc is also anchored and confined around 0.9950, while Cable nudged higher alongside Eur/Usd earlier, but topped out ahead of 1.3100 and last Friday&rsquo;s 1.3105 high to sit just above 1.3050, awaiting more from UK PM May on Brexit. The Kiwi has drifted back below 0.6600 having lost some pre-weekend event risk premium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both underperforming vs G10 counterparts, the former on domestic political developments as the Government lost its slender majority by virtue of failing to retain its seat at the Sydney by-election. However, Aud/Usd is just holding above 0.7100 in wake of a short squeeze in Chinese equities overnight, which in contrast has weighed on the Jpy as a safe-haven proxy, with Usd/Jpy retesting resistance around a key 112.74 Fib vs sub-112.50 at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCANDI</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nok and Sek maintaining positive momentum before Norges and Riksbank policy convenes that are both seen underscoring hawkish policy guidance, and the former potentially signalling a December rate hike rather than the option to delay until February 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early Monday/week outperformance for the Rand, as Usd/Zar trade under 14.3000 ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s MTBS amidst press reports noting improved budget revenues relative to 2017 and more on track with forecasts. Elsewhere, the Rouble is outpacing the Lira in the run up to this week&rsquo;s CBR and CBT meetings, with the Rub deriving some support from a rebound in Brent to just over Usd 80/brl.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mostly higher as a rally in Chinese stocks helped most the regional bourses shrug-off the cautious open. ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) were both initially lower with Australia dampened by political uncertainty as PM Morrison&rsquo;s governing coalition is on track to lose its 1-seat parliamentary majority following a by election in eastern Sydney, while the early downbeat tone was also attributed to geopolitical concerns after Trump announced the US would leave the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. However, most of the losses in the region were later pared as the Shanghai Comp. (+4.2%) surged on a rebound from 4-year lows which inspired the Hang Seng (+1.7%), while officials were also conducive to the risk sentiment in which President Xi reiterated unwavering commitment to the private sector, China released its draft of tax cuts and the PBoC announced a liquidity injection of CNY 120bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs were amid the turnaround in sentiment for the region and lack of BoJ presence in the market today.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed following the indecisive performance of their US counterparts on Friday and as focus reverts to ongoing trade concerns, although China outperforms on bargain buying. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) opened lower with Australia dampened by political uncertainty as PM Morrison&rsquo;s governing coalition is set to lose their 1-seat majority following a by election in eastern Sydney, while the early downbeat tone was also attributed to geopolitical concerns after Trump announced US would leave the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. However, some of the losses in the region were later pared as Chinese markets entered the fray with the Shanghai Comp. (+3.3%) surging on a rebound from 4-year lows which has inspired the Hang Seng (+1.7%), while the PBoC was also conducive to the risk sentiment with a liquidity injection of CNY 120bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets begin the week quiet in which the DXY is little changed as its main counterparts struggle for direction with EUR/USD stuck near 1.1500 and GBP/USD taking a breather from the Brexit-related mood-swings at the 1.3000 handle. Elsewhere, AUD/USD briefly weakened to below 0.7100 as Australia heads towards a hung parliament although losses are contained as the ruling coalition would only need the support of just one of the independent MPs to pass laws or win a confidence vote, while USD/JPY is choppy alongside a similar indecisive risk tone in Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful amid the mixed sentiment in the region and with no Rinban operations or auction scheduled for today.</p>\r\n",
