There wasn&rsquo;t a specific catalyst for today&rsquo;s price action, though some FX models point to stronger-than-average USD buying into month-end. At the margin, comments from ECB president Draghi were judged on the dovish side, providing a narrative for a weaker EUR amid the USD strengthening off lows; in early trade, the single currency failed to negotiate 10d SMA and 21d SMA around 1.2355, then slipping beneath the 1.23 handle, before finding support around 1.2280. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With large expiries at the 107 strike, JPY was inching towards the level pre-NY cut, and is consolidating around the figure as we head into APAC trade, shrugging-off the weakness overnight, when BOJ&rsquo;s Kuroda suggested that there was no need to tweak the central bank&rsquo;s current easing programme, and no review into its efficacy was required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP is flat, trading around 1.3965 and EURGBP&nbsp; is slightly above 0.88 (flattish on the day), with the currency happy to look through the pro-EU approach adopted by the leader of the opposition; one bank desk noted that sterling traders are more inclined to trade &lsquo;Brexit facts, rather than Brexit speculation&rsquo;. With that said, there has been a lot of newsflow regarding the seemingly precarious state of UK politics, with chatter of confidence votes for UK PM May, as well as continual talk of Tory rebels working for a more aggressive Brexit stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodity FX was tracking commodity prices, while EMFX was mixed. ZAR traders were awaiting details of the new cabinet, and appointments came in line with earlier leaks. BRL and MXN were more rangebound, though the former got a boost after stronger than expected tax receipts in January, while the latter &ndash; among the best FX performers YTD &ndash; was hit on NAFTA concerns (reports Trump advisor Paul Navarro, a trade hawk, was to get a more prominent role in the administration) as well as weak retail sales data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump claimed US is losing a lot of money to Canada and Mexico.

Al Falih added that after the current OPEC+ deal expires, OPEC+ would be able to relax output curbs and look to create a permanent &lsquo;framework&rsquo; to stabilise markets. Also over the weekend, Libya&rsquo;s NOC declared force majeure at the 70k BPD El Feel oilfield, though reports today suggested that the Sharara field was unaffected. Crude prices spiked higher in afternoon trade after Genscape was reported to have forecast crude stocks at the Cushing hub were set to draw by 879k in the week, sending crude 50 cents higher to above $64.00. This week, analysts expect to see US crude inventories build by 2.7mln barrels, distillates draw by 0.7ln, gasoline draw by 0.7mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><a name=\"_Hlk506494646\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk506494612\">GEOPOLITICAL </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said North Korea want to talk, as do the US, but only under the right conditions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major equity indices are green, with the EMINI continuing to claw-back losses incurred in the volatility-induced &ldquo;position adjustment&rdquo; in early February. In fact, the losses incurred on Monday 5 February (the second day of the sell-off) have now been pared, with the 2840 level now in focus (highs from Friday 2/Feb, the day the sell-off began in earnest). The backdrop for Monday&rsquo;s gains were inspired by falling Treasury yields, which were said to have soothed investors&rsquo; fears about sharp rate rises. Tech shares continued to be in vogue (best performing sector in 2018 YTD), after Qualcomm urged Broadcom to negotiate a price for a deal. On the other end of the scale, the defensive utilities sector lagged. The VIX continues to ease-back, now trading in the low-16s. SPX +1.18% at 2780, DJI +1.57%, NDX +1.3% at 6989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s testimony to the House on Tuesday, Treasury yields were lower by between 1bps to 2bps across the curve, with 10-year yields falling to 2.85%. Most major curve spreads were little changed, though the 5s30s curve was wider by 1.3bps at settlement. Powell is expected to stick to the script, though some are wondering how he will avoid sounding too hawkish. T-Note futures settled 3 ticks higher at 120-26+.</p>\r\n",

However, some analysts judged his comments to be on the dovish side, after the ECB president stated that there was uncertainty regarding the measurement of slack, saying that the true amount may in fact be larger than current estimates. Elsewhere, Draghi reiterated the ECB&rsquo;s current forward guidance, that inflation is yet to show signs of a sustainable rise towards target. <strong>ECB vice president nominee de Guindos</strong> was also in front of lawmakers today, and strictly toed the line in terms of current ECB guidance, giving traders little indication of where he lies on the hawk-dove scale. De Guindos drove-home a message of continuity, noting that rates will begin to rise after the conclusion of bond-buying (in line with ECB guidance). The nominee talked-up the success that the ECB had made in re-anchoring inflation expectations, and said that, over time, ECB policy will converge to the Fed. <strong>ECB&rsquo;s Coeure,</strong> meanwhile, said over the weekend that the ECB can slow bond purchases, as long as it gives a clear guidance on the path of interest rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s testimony by Fed chair Powell to the House Financial Services committee, <strong>Fed&rsquo;s Quarles (voter)</strong> &ndash; in his first monetary policy speech &ndash; said it would be appropriate for gradual rate hikes. He sees inflation moving back towards target in the medium term, though said it remains to be seen whether higher growth will spur inflation. Quarles was optimistic on growth, suggesting that there a\\re some upside risks. <strong>Fed&rsquo;s Bullard (non-voter)</strong> once again stated his familiar concerns about how Fed rate hikes could make the central bank&rsquo;s policy restrictive, and how he believes that rate guidance should outline a relatively flat path of hikes. He did concede, however, that inflation expectations had edged upwards, and elsewhere said he was unconcerned by recent market volatility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no notable comments on monetary policy from <strong>BOE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +1.18% at 2780, DJI +1.57%, NDX +1.3% at 6989<br />Top sectors: Telecoms +1.57%, Tech +1.46%, Industrials +1.27%<br />Bottom sectors: Utilities -0.1%, Materials +0.35%, Staples +0.51%</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major equity indices are green, with the <strong>EMINI</strong> continuing to claw-back losses incurred in the volatility-induced &ldquo;position adjustment&rdquo; in early February. In fact, the losses incurred on Monday 5 February (the second day of the sell-off) have now been pared, with the 2840 level now in focus (highs from Friday 2/Feb, the day the sell-off began in earnest). The backdrop for Monday&rsquo;s gains were inspired by falling Treasury yields, which were said to have soothed investors fears about sharp rate rises. <strong>Tech</strong> shares continued to be in vogue (best performing sector in 2018 YTD), after Qualcomm urged Broadcom to negotiate a price for a deal. On the other end of the scale, the defensive <strong>utilities</strong> sector lagged. The <strong>VIX</strong> continues to ease-back, now trading in the low-16s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: T-Note futures settle 3 ticks higher at 120-26+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s testimony to the House on Tuesday, Treasury yields were lower by between 1bps to 2bps across the curve, with 10-year yields falling to 2.85%. Most major curve spreads were little changed, though the 5s30s curve was wider by 1.3bps at settlement. Powell is expected to stick to the script, though some are wondering how he will avoid sounding too hawkish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY flat heading into APAC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After starting-off on the back-foot in the US pre-market, <strong>DXY</strong> trades flat heading into APAC trade, with traders taking a cautious approach ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s testimony from Fed chair Powell to the House. There wasn&rsquo;t a specific catalyst for today&rsquo;s price action, though some FX models point to stronger-than-average USD buying into month-end. At the margin, comments from ECB president Draghi were judged on the dovish side, providing a narrative for a weaker <strong>EUR </strong>amid the USD strengthening off lows; in early trade, the single currency failed to negotiate 10d SMA and 21d SMA around 1.2355, then slipping beneath the 1.23 handle, before finding support around 1.2280. With large expiries at the 107 strike, <strong>JPY</strong> was inching towards the level pre-NY cut, and is consolidating around the figure as we head into APAC trade, shrugging-off the weakness overnight, when BOJ&rsquo;s Kuroda suggested that there was no need to tweak the central bank&rsquo;s current easing programme, and no review into its efficacy was required. <strong>GBP</strong> is flat, trading around 1.3965 and EURGBP &nbsp;is slightly above 0.88 (flattish on the day), with the currency happy to look through the pro-EU approach adopted by the leader of the opposition; one bank desk noted that sterling traders are more inclined to trade &lsquo;Brexit facts, rather than Brexit speculation&rsquo;. With that said, there has been a lot of newsflow regarding the seemingly precarious state of UK politics, with chatter of confidence votes for UK PM May, as well as continual talk of Tory rebels working for a more aggressive Brexit stance. <strong>Commodity FX</strong> was tracking commodity prices, while EMFX was mixed. <strong>ZAR</strong> traders were awaiting details of the new cabinet, and appointments came in line with earlier leaks. <strong>BRL</strong> and <strong>MXN</strong> were more rangebound, though the former got a boost after stronger than expected tax receipts in January, while the latter &ndash; among the best FX performers YTD &ndash; was hit on NAFTA concerns (reports Trump advisor Paul Navarro, a trade hawk, was to get a more prominent role in the administration) as well as weak retail sales data. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 36 cents higher at $63.91 per barrel; Brent futures settle 19 cents higher at $67.50 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices generally traded mixed in early Monday trade, despite bullish comments from the <strong>Saudi energy minister</strong> over the weekend, who said that the country&rsquo;s Q1 output would be beneath the levels agreed to in the OPEC+ supply cut deal. Al Falih added that after the current OPEC+ deal expires, OPEC+ would be able to relax output curbs and look to create a permanent &lsquo;framework&rsquo; to stabilise markets. Also over the weekend, <strong>Libya&rsquo;s NOC</strong> declared force majeure at the 70k BPD El Feel oilfield, though reports today suggested that the Sharara field was unaffected. Crude prices spiked higher in afternoon trade after <strong>Genscape</strong> was reported to have forecast crude stocks at the Cushing hub were set to draw by 879k in the week, sending crude 50 cents higher to above $64.00. This week, analysts expect to see US <strong>crude inventories</strong> build by 2.7mln barrels, distillates draw by 0.7ln, gasoline draw by 0.7mln.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: New Fed Chair Powell to deliver semi-annual testimony to Congress ",
        "content": "<p><strong>WHEN</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text of Testimony to be released on Tuesday 27<sup>th</sup> February 2018 at 1330GMT/0830EST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday 27<sup>th</sup> February at 1500GMT/1000EST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday 1<sup>st</sup> March at 1500GMT/1000EST</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PREVIEW</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell will deliver his first monetary policy testimony to Congress, beginning on Tuesday in front of the House Financial Services Committee and continuing on Thursday in front of the Senate Banking Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Powell is widely expected to follow a similar path to Janet Yellen and reiterate that further gradual increases in the Fed Funds Rate (FFR) are warranted. With a March rate hike appearing to be a forgone conclusion, it would take a huge dovish u-turn from Powell for the Fed to delay hiking next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets will instead be looking at the comments for any clues on whether four 25bps rate hikes in 2018 are likely. Back in his testimony ahead of getting confirmed as Fed Chair, Powell said that risks to the economy appeared to be balanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The median rate projection of the FOMC last December called for three 25bps rate hikes in 2018, and we expect Powell&rsquo;s comments to be supportive of this outlook,&rdquo; writes HSBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Powell would most likely prefer to keep the option of a fourth hike in 2018 open without so much as confirming it. &ldquo;A clear majority of the FOMC, including its new Chairman, will want the optionality on the table of a potential, perhaps even probable, fourth rate hike this year,&rdquo; writes SGH Macro Advisers. &ldquo;But our sense is that Powell and most of his Committee colleagues will not want to signal the fourth rate move as a given in either the testimony or, we suspect, the March meeting.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On inflation, the Fed had previously categorised inflation weakness as &ldquo;transitory,&rdquo; (in his November confirmation hearing, Powell himself alluded to uncertainty regarding the path of inflation). However, the recent CPI data and average hourly earnings data both point to an acceleration in price pressures. The focus is on how Powell frames the recent firming. UBS believes Powell will likely project increased confidence that inflation will rise to target this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FED POLICY FRAMEWORK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of policymakers, including Rosengren and Mester, have recently spoken about how they&rsquo;d like a review of the Fed&rsquo;s policy framework. HSBC speculate that the topic could come up in the Q&amp;A and markets will be looking for whether Powell would be open to reviewing the policy framework and his thoughts on alternatives to the current 2% inflation target, whether that be price-level targeting or a target-range for inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MARKET VOLATILITY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent market volatility has been attributed to inflationary pressures forcing traders to reprice their expectations of the Fed hiking cycle. After the FOMC&rsquo;s experience of the &lsquo;taper tantrum&rsquo; in 2013, it will be cautious about managing market expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At his swearing-in ceremony Powell alluded to the recent market volatility, stating that the Fed will &ldquo;remain alert&rdquo; to any financial stability risks presented by market gyrations. &ldquo;He will labor to avoid even a whiff of baby-sitting a wobbly stock market with a &lsquo;Powell put&rsquo; readiness to intervene,&rdquo; SGH writes. &ldquo;But he will be equally forceful in affirming the Fed will not rush to raise rates against what it believes will be a rising but hardly accelerationist inflation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

Sterling could have been undermined by the latest Brexit-related UK political instability, as opposition Labour leader Corbyn laid out his party&rsquo;s blueprint for life outside the EU, including plans to remain in the customs union, which a spox for PM May denounced. Gbp/Usd hit 1.3950 lows and Eur/Gbp rebounded above 0.8800, while Eur/Usd dipped below 1.2300 having failed to convincingly build on gains through its 1.2346 DMA and 1.2350, but derived some underlying support from ECB President Draghi (growth more robust, and inflation to rise gradually, albeit still subdued). Usd/Cad extended to the upside and tested 1.2700 (ahead of 1.2705 resistance) on persistent NAFTA uncertainty, with Usd/Mxn also firmer (within a 18.5470-18.6900 range) after Mexico&rsquo;s President ditched plans to visit his US counterpart after a strained phone conversation about the controversial wall. Nzd/Usd just held above 0.7300 as Aud/Usd retreated a bit further from near 0.7900 highs towards 0.7830 and the Aud/Nzd cross slipped back to circa 1.0700 from 1.0770.</p>\r\n",

(Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three cabinet ministers warned PM May during private talks on Brexit at her Chequers retreat last week that her government could collapse this year. According to reports, senior ministers said there are discussions about whether the prime minister should turn the vote into a confidence issue, threatening a general election if Tory MPs vote with the opposition. (Sunday Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK opposition leader Corbyn is set to confirm today that the Labour Party will oppose PM May&rsquo;s plans to take Britain out of the customs union with the EU.

Ramsden also commented that certainly relative to where he was, he now sees the case for rates rising somewhat sooner rather than somewhat later. (Sunday Times) Note: Ramsden was one of the two dissenters on the MPC when the BoE decided to hike rates in November 2017, citing concerns over wage growth prospects as a reason to refrain from lifting rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A positive start to the week for European equities (Eurostoxx 50 +0.5%), which have taken the impetus from Asian equities overnight. The gains this morning have been largely broad-based across all major sectors, while material names outperform with miners tracking the moves higher in commodity prices which have been buoyed by the softer USD. Moves higher in the FTSE 100 have been capped by the GBP strength which had been given a boost by surprisingly hawkish comments from BoE&rsquo;s Ramsden, while election risks have contained the upside in the FTSE MIB. In stock specific news, the troubled lender, Profident Financial are trading with losses of over 13% ahead of their earnings tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY is back below 90.000 yet again, and on broad losses for the Greenback vs G10 peers bar the Loonie (Usd/Cad holding above 1.2600 towards the middle of a 1.2615-60 range). Some market observers say the renewed bout of weakness reflects a pull-back in yields, but that correlation remains tenuous given the fact that the Dollar did not rally in tandem with 10 year cash hitting peaks around 2.95% (circa 10 basis points above current levels) at the heights last week, or at least not to the same degree. Hence, it is concerns about the US fiscal situation and rising deficits that are still weighing on sentiment alongside some political angst as President Trump continues to push protectionist policies. Even month end demand has not given the Usd much of a boost, as yet anyway, with Eur/Usd firmly back above 1.2300 and testing 1.2346 DMA resistance despite bearish cross flow via Eur/Jpy that has tested near term chart support just ahead of 131.00. Cable has breached its 21 DMA and 1.4050 amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty, and Usd/Jpy has retreated to 106.50 from 107.00+. The Greenback may derive some support from big option expiries, with circa 2 bn in both Cable and Usd/Jpy at 1.4000 and 107.00-05 respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10 year German benchmark saw an abrupt downturn and reversal broadly on the EU equity cash opening bells as positive indications via stock futures materialised. Bunds had already pared some losses, but were holding around parity before sliding to a 159.25 low (-23 ticks vs +18 ticks at best), and perhaps also declining in sympathy with Gilts that gapped down straightaway to 121.71 (-24 ticks) amidst hawkish BoE and upbeat/bullish economic growth impulses. However, the main UK bond subsequently regained some composure to trade just 3 ticks above last Friday&rsquo;s settlement level before fading, and it appears to be a mixture of chart gap-filling, early month end and ongoing positioning for the March expiry and roll into June that has prompted choppy price moves since the Liffe and Eurex opens. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are somewhat side-lined, but maintaining a flatter bias in quiet overnight trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures pulled off best levels with WTI running into resistance around USD 64 to move back down to the mid-USD 63s. Over the weekend, Saudi Energy Miniset Al Falih stated that he expects production cuts to ease next year (Current OPEC/ Non-OPEC production cut due to expire at year-end). Elsewhere, Barclays sees a significant risk of a market correction in H2 as a result of builds in inventories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barclays says 2018 crude forecast of USD 60bbl for Brent and USD 55bbl for WTI is unchanged</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Barclays expects backwardation in WTI and Brent Futures curves to subside later this year</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Barclays also sees a significant risk of market correction in H2 2018 due to builds in inventories</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libya&#39;s El Sharara oil field, which accounts for 308,000 bpd, is not affected by closure of el feel field-engineer.

        "content": "<p>Equities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A positive start to the week for European equities (Eurostoxx 50 +0.65), which have taken the impetus from Asian equities overnight. The gains this morning have been largely broad-based across all major sectors, while material names outperform with miners tracking the moves higher in commodity prices which have been buoyed by the softer USD. Moves higher in the FTSE 100 have been capped by the GBP strength which had been given a boost by surprisingly hawkish comments from BoE&rsquo;s Ramsden, while election risks have contained the upside in the FTSE MIB. In stock specific news, the troubled lender, Profident Financial are trading with losses of over 13% ahead of their earnings tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY is back below 90.000 yet again, and on broad losses for the Greenback vs G10 peers bar the Loonie (Usd/Cad holding above 1.2600 towards the middle of a 1.2615-60 range). Some market observers say the renewed bout of weakness reflects a pull-back in yields, but that correlation remains tenuous given the fact that the Dollar did not rally in tandem with 10 year cash hitting peaks around 2.95% (circa 10 basis points above current levels) at the heights last week, or at least not to the same degree. Hence, it is concerns about the US fiscal situation and rising deficits that are still weighing on sentiment alongside some political angst as President Trump continues to push protectionist policies. Even month end demand has not given the Usd much of a boost, as yet anyway, with Eur/Usd firmly back above 1.2300 and testing 1.2346 DMA resistance despite bearish cross flow via Eur/Jpy that has tested near term chart support just ahead of 131.00. Cable has breached its 21 DMA and 1.4050 amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty, and Usd/Jpy has retreated to 106.50 from 107.00+. The Greenback may derive some support from big option expiries, with circa 2 bn in both Cable and Usd/Jpy at 1.4000 and 107.00-05 respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixed Income</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10 year German benchmark saw an abrupt downturn and reversal broadly on the EU equity cash opening bells as positive indications via stock futures materialised. Bunds had already pared some losses, but were holding around parity before sliding to a 159.34 low (-14 ticks vs +18 ticks at best), and perhaps also declining in sympathy with Gilts that gapped down straightaway to 121.71 (-24 ticks) amidst hawkish BoE and upbeat/bullish economic growth impulses. However, the main UK bond subsequently regained some composure to trade just 3 ticks above last Friday&rsquo;s settlement level before fading, and it appears to be a mixture of chart gap-filling, early month end and ongoing positioning for the March expiry and roll into June that has prompted choppy price moves since the Liffe and Eurex opens. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are somewhat side-lined, but maintaining a flatter bias in quiet overnight trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures pulled off best levels with WTI running into resistance around USD 64 to move back down to the mid-USD 63s. Over the weekend, Saudi Energy Miniset Al Falih stated that he expects production cuts to ease next year (Current OPEC/ Non-OPEC production cut due to expire at year-end). Elsewhere, Barclays sees a significant risk of a market correction in H2 as a result of builds in inventories. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Late in the day, however, ES managed to find some impetus in quiet trade, rising out of that range towards session highs &ndash; with some chatter of a mini short squeeze &ndash; shaking-off the lethargy seen in recent afternoon trade. There wasn&rsquo;t a specific narrative behind Friday&rsquo;s equity gains, with many news outlets attributing the gains to Fed-related headlines, though that seems to be trying fit a narrative around the price action, rather than actually explaining the price action. Perhaps a more convincing explanation was the fall in US yields providing support (some models signal month-end Treasury buying). In stock specific news, HPE jumped after reporting earnings on Thursday, GIS was the laggard after announcing an $8bln deal to buy BUFF; in late trade, news that JWN family members were reportedly near finalising an offer to take the company private added a positive catalyst to equity trading. While stock trading has been choppy this week, ES finishes in the green (very slightly &ndash; and last week&rsquo;s highs haven&rsquo;t been meaningfully tested), though the range has been the narrowest in around six weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stock markets began the week on the front-foot as the region took impetus from last Friday&rsquo;s late rally on Wall St and with energy names underpinned by recent strength in crude prices. ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) were both higher in which earnings fuelled the biggest gainers in Australia, while Japanese exporters weathered a firmer JPY and led the region&rsquo;s advances. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) were in the green with Geely Auto the outperformer after reports its parent amassed a near 10% stake in Daimler, although Chinese property names were less fortunate with the Shanghai Comp. Property Index slumping 3% in early trade after the latest House data showed efforts to curb the sector were gaining fruition. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher amid mild gains in USTs, while the Japanese yield curve was mixed as&nbsp;longer-dated bonds underperformed&nbsp;after the BoJ kept its operations concentrated in the belly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD weakness persisted as yields declined overnight and with participants tentative ahead of Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s testimony to Congress this week. As such, the greenback lost ground against its major counterparts in which EUR/USD and GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.2300 and 1.4000 handles respectively. Elsewhere, NZD/USD also tripped through stops on a break above the 0.7300 level, while reiterations from Governor Kuroda failed to alleviate the pressure on USD/JPY.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stock&nbsp;markets begin the week on the front-foot as region takes impetus from last Friday&rsquo;s late rally on Wall St and with energy names underpinned by recent strength in crude prices. ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) are both higher with earnings fuelling the biggest gainers in Australia and with Japanese exporters weathering a firmer JPY to conform to the overall positive risk tone. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) are in the green with Geely Auto leading the advances after reports it amassed a near 10% stake in Daimler, while Chinese property names were less fortunate with the Shanghai Comp. Property Index slumping 3% after the latest House data showed efforts to curb the sector were gaining fruition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD weakness persisted as yields declined overnight and with participants tentative ahead of Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s testimony to Congress this week. As such, the greenback lost ground against its major counterparts in which EUR/USD reclaimed the 1.2300 handle and GBP/USD eyed a retest of 1.4000 to the upside. Elsewhere, NZD/USD tripped through stops on a break above the 0.7300 level, while reiterations from Governor Kuroda failed to alleviate the pressure on USD/JPY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid similar gains in USTs, while the Japanese yield curve is mixed with longer-dated bonds underperforming after the BoJ kept its operations concentrated in the belly.</p>\r\n",
