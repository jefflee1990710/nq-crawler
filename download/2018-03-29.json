Trade was subdued ahead of the long weekend/month-end/quarter-end, with most of the rebalancing seemingly completed on Wednesday. Gains were broad-based, with all sectors green; tech led the gains, with the much-watched FAANG names positive &ndash; Amazon recovering from a slide after negative tweets from US President Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI futures (May) settle 56 cents higher at USD 64.94 per barrel, WTI (June) settles 52 cents higher at $64.87.</strong><br />* Traders continue to balance bearish &nbsp;fundamentals (rising supply, with the suggestion that demand could ease in the months/quarters ahead) with rising geopolitical tensions (will the US re-apply sanctions on Iran in May?). But on Thursday, crude took its cue from a favourable risk backdrop, finishing the session in the black, rounding off the its third straight quarter of gains. At the margin, continued positive OPEC chatter was cited by some traders, and after reports from Saudi Arabia on Wednesday that oil producers were weighing extending cooperation on supply cuts, today it was reported that Russian policymakers were mulling the notion. Elsewhere, a Reuters poll showed analysts revised their 2018 forecasts for Brent and WTI higher (to $63.97 and $59.85 per barrel, respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX: DXY ENDS Q1 DOWN, FIFTH STRAIGHT QUARTER OF DECLINES. </strong><br />* It is difficult to infer much significance from Thursday&rsquo;s FX trade on account of month/quarter-end, as well as traders wrapping up early for the long Easter weekend. This left EUR more-or-less unchanged clinging to the 1.23 region. Overnight, the JPY saw profit taking near 107.00, and along with lower US yields, USDJPY moved towards 106.30, before settling around the 106.50 mark. GBP trades lower after weaker-than-expected house price data, though the 1.40 level holds. Firmer risk sentiment helped the AUD, NZD and CAD make gains against the buck, though AUDUSD struggles with the 0.77 handle; NZD had a look beneath the 0.72 area, though made its way back above the level; CAD continues to patrol the 1.28-1.2950 range. EMFX is generally higher on positive risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FIXED INCOME: US 10-Year T-Note Futures Settle 8 ticks higher at 121-05. </strong><br />* Treasuries bull-flattened in thin volume trade. Traders largely ignored the data slate today, despite core PCE ticking up in-line with expectations. The flattening theme continued, with 2s30s printing fresh lows under 70bps (all major spreads were tighter).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been a bad first quarter of the year for the Greenback overall, but the index has clawed back some losses over the final 3 trading sessions of the month to get back within touching distance of the 90.000 level within a broader 92.640-88.253 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar reprieve is largely due to several bank portfolios flagging buy signals for the end of March (one &lsquo;strong and across the board&rsquo;), which of course also coincides with the end of Q1 and Japan&rsquo;s financial year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not quite zero from hero, but amidst selling interest from domestic importers and a mega M&amp;A (on paper at least) the Jpy reversed coursed sharply in the run in to the turn, as the headline pair posted its largest single day rise of 2018 so far and biggest in pip terms for over 2 years. In terms of Q1, Usd/Jpy has tumbled from 113.05 to a low of 104.55, and currently around 106.35 (30 DMA) with decent option expiry interest between 106.40-50 (1.1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar pattern for the antipodeans vs the Usd, with global trade war jitters and in particular concerns about the US-Chinese tariff tiff repercussions undermining earlier appreciation in the quarter. Aud/Usd was trading up at 0.8135 in late January, but reversed to a low of circa 0.7640 on the penultimate session of this month with the next major tech support seen at 0.7600 and a big expiry (1.2 bn) also underpinning vs macro offers at 0.7680 (latter now being tested after a weak Chicago PMI). Nzd/Usd highs and lows have been less pronounced amidst more choppy and rangebound trade on balance, but 0.7200 is being challenged to the downside and a clean break could expose the 200 DMA (0.7185-80), with stops seen at 0.7175 and 0.7150.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Undermined by softer than expected GDP data today, but also other recent release and ongoing NAFTA uncertainty as negotiations continue amidst some reports that an accord is still remote with time running out before Mexican elections at the end of April. Usd/Cad is pivoting around 1.2900, and much closer to 1.3100+ peaks vs circa 1.2250 lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both net winners vs the Usd since the start of 2018, the former on an increasingly more hawkish or less dovish ECB and the latter due to signs of progress on the Brexit front and a transition deal between the UK and EU. Eur/Usd straddling 1.2300 at present, with big stops seen at 1.2295 ahead of the 4pm fix, Cable holding just above 1.4050 vs a peak this year around 1.4345 and trough at 1.3455.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.2%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%)</strong> were choppy in the midst of earnings season and with initial gains seen following reports of VAT reductions, although continued liquidity inaction by the PBoC and ongoing trade tensions with the US eventually weighed. Finally, 10yr JGBs were weaker as Japanese yields rose across the curve, with demand for paper sapped by initial outperformance in Japanese stocks and after an uninspiring 2yr auction in which the amount sold, b/c and accepted prices all declined from prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 40bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC sets CNY mid-point at 6.3046 (Prev. 6.2785)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China State Council approved lowering of VAT rates effective May 1st as part of tax reduction package valued at CNY 400bln for 2018. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Harker (non-voter, dovish) says expects three rate hikes this year, previously he projected two, citing stronger inflation. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRADE TARIFFS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Ministry of Commerce said it hopes US drops unilateralism and protectionism, while it also hopes US takes steps and resolves conflict with China through dialogue. Furthermore, Mofcom added that US action on trade is like opening a Pandora&#39;s box and that it sees spillover effects. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was initially reported that US and are China in talks to shield soybeans from trade war, but this was later followed by conflicting overnight comments from the US Soybean Export Council that said China is still contemplating import curbs on US soybeans.&nbsp; (SCMP/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK opposition Labour Party is likely to vote in favour of final Brexit deal, according to press reports.

Defensive sectors are in the red with focus on utilities and healthcare whilst broad gains are seen across all the other sectors. Sodexo (-14.1%) was the laggard this morning after reporting its earnings, dragging down Elior (-1.0%) and Compass (-3.6%) in the UK food catering segment. SwissRE (+2.9%) is leading the SMI after Softbank is said to be interested in building a 25% stake in the Co. for a USD 9.6bln deal. TomTom suffered losses of 6.3% after approaching Deutsche Bank for a potential sale of the whole firm or minority stake, but then denied calling for an adviser to seek potential buyers. Finally, as a reminder, Melrose&rsquo;s GBP 8bln hostile bid for GKN is due to expire today at 1300 BST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback is showing little sign of losing its month, quarter and Japanese FY end bid, although the DXY is only tentatively above the 90.000 handle and the Dollar is somewhat mixed against its G10 rivals. Usd/Jpy is hovering just above 106.50 having touched 107.00 overnight after the biggest 1 day jump this year so far and with near term support seen at the 30 DMA (106.35). Aud/Usd has recovered some poise after hitting a fresh 2018 low around 0.7644 overnight but looks capped ahead of macro supply seen at 0.7680 vs major support at 0.7600 where hefty option expiry interest also resides (1.2 bn). Usd/Cad remains close to 1.2900 amidst less positive NAFTA vibes (long way to go to reach a deal and US demands on food not palatable), and with the Loonie now looking towards Canadian GDP data for some independent direction. Eur/Usd looks anchored around 1.2300 with strong support and resistance not far from the round number at 1.2286 and 1.2329 (latter representing the 30 DMA) and little to offer impetus via German jobs or inflation data given outcomes relatively close to consensus. Cable is clinging to 1.4050 (just) having lost grip of 1.4200 and 1.4100 handles on the run in to the end of March and long Easter weekend amidst decent expiries at the latter level and 1.4000, while techs are also wary of a fib at 1.4041. Nzd/Usd sits near 0.7200 and Usd/Chf is just above 0.9550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Debt markets remain comparatively subdued in terms of price action and traded volume, but Bunds and Gilts have both seen further topside activity with the former up to 159.35 and briefly above parity, albeit only +4 ticks. The core UK debt future continues to outperform and reached 122.84 at one stage (+19 ticks) on the back of more bullish month end duration dynamics but lost a little momentum in wake of the UK data that revealed a few better than expected components. US Treasuries somewhat side-lined ahead of some key macro releases to come but retaining a marginally firmer and flatter bias after the heavy supply taken down in the past few days (7 year auction the least well received despite its usual popularity with foreign investors and perhaps a sign of global trade wars adversely impacting demand).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at the commodities complex, WTI (+0.3%) and Brent Crude (+0.1%) are trading in close proximity to yesterday&rsquo;s post-DoE levels. Prices have also been supported by yesterday&rsquo;s comments from OPEC stating the producer cartel and other suppliers are looking to continue withholding the output cut for the rest of the year and potentially 2019. Moving on to metals, Gold is trading close to the prior session&rsquo;s lows where the yellow metal posted its biggest 1-day percentage fall in almost 9 months as it continues to move inversely to the dollar. Base metals have seen a rebound in prices on the London Metal Exchange with Nickel (+2.0%) leading the advance and copper (+1.0%) higher following recent declines.</p>\r\n",

The 10 year benchmark was initially marked down quite heavily to 122.48 vs Wednesday&rsquo;s 122.65 close, but met underlying bids immediately to trade back up at 122.73 before fading, while the 3 month curve has turned 1-3 tick losses into 1-2 tick gains, albeit still slightly steeper after recent flattening.

CPI is expected to pick-up pace this month and will obviously feed into ECB thinking given recent concerns about the slow progress towards target, and especially in terms of underlying prices.

ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) were mixed with Australia dragged lower by tech as well as recent weakness across commodities, while the Japanese benchmark was propped up for most the day by a softer currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) were choppy in the midst of earnings season and with initial gains seen following reports of VAT reductions, although continued liquidity inaction by the PBoC and ongoing trade tensions with the US eventually weighed. Finally, 10yr JGBs were weaker as Japanese yields rose across the curve, with demand for paper sapped by initial outperformance in Japanese stocks and after an uninspiring 2yr auction in which the amount sold, b/c and accepted prices all declined from prior.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) are mixed with Australia also dragged lower by tech as well as recent weakness across commodities, while the Japanese benchmark has been propped up by a softer currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch) are choppy in the midst of earnings season and with initial gains seen following reports of VAT reductions, although continued liquidity inaction by the PBoC and ongoing trade tensions with the US eventually weighed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback pared some of the prior day&rsquo;s strength with the DXY now back below the 90.00 level. This provided mild reprieve for EUR/USD which also found support at 1.2300, while GBP/USD was less encouraging and marginally extended on its descent below the 1.4100 handle. Elsewhere, USD/JPY pulled back after hitting resistance at 107.00 and on some position squaring heading into fiscal year-end, while commodity-linked currencies remained lacklustre following the recent downside across the complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are weaker as Japanese yields rise across the curve, with demand for paper sapped by the outperformance in Japanese stocks and as participants await a 2yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
