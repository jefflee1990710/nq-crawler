(FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May spokesman said technical notices during August and September will set out sensible precautions in the event of a no-deal Brexit and that this would also have consequences for the EU. (Newswires)<br /><br />UK Brexit negotiators reportedly warned their EU counterparts that European-based investment funds that rely on British clients for their cash and profits could be hit by regulators unless the EU changes its stance regarding the UK&rsquo;s financial services post-Brexit.

(NYT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said the right time to get aggressive on trade is when the economy is strong, while he added that they are closest to a trade deal on NAFTA especially with Mexico. In related news, US and Mexico plan to conduct ministerial-level NAFTA talks on Thursday in Washington according to Mexico government sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ES futures were ticking up overnight, but ran out of steam beneath 2,822 before skidding to below 2,800 in afternoon trade. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a specific catalyst for the downside, though some desks have now begun talking about the market reaching an &lsquo;exhaustion point&rsquo; (Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s equity strategists over the weekend), with a rotation from growth strategies to value strategies being seen. Ultimately, however, the ES has been going horizontally through most of July. The ES returned to the 2,800 level in late trade. Caterpillar (CAT) reported upbeat numbers, beating on the top- and bottom-lines, boosted its share buyback facility and its guidance, propelling the Dow Mini to pre-market highs. Harley Davidson (HOG) announced it would manufacture new lightweight motorbikes for Asian markets in the face of declining demand in the US. T-Mobile (TMUS) names Nokia as the company that would supply it with $3.5b;n next-generation 5G network equipment, making the world&rsquo;s largest 5G deal so far, in a sign that the wireless upgrade cycle is taking shape. American Express (AXP) was slammed on reports it raised foreign exchange rates to clients without giving notice, which also heaped some pressure on Visa (V). After reports of sexual misconduct, CBS (CBS) said there had been no misconduct allegations nor settlements with CEO Moonves in his time at the company, though the company is probing allegations. In the energy sector, Chesapeake (CHK) plans to sell a stake in its Utica shale operations for $2bln, while KKR (KKR) and Williams Companies (WMB) formed a JV to purchase Discovery Midstream for $1.2bln. General Electric (GE) came off lows after WSJ reported that it is seeking a buyer for key parts of its digital business, citing sources. SPX -0.6% at 2803, NDX -1.4% at 7193, DJI -0.6% at 25308.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury curve steepened on Monday, though trade was thin ahead of this week&rsquo;s central bank risk events (BOJ overnight, Fed Wednesday, BOE Thursday). Selling action today was being attributed to expectations that the BOJ would adjust its yield curve control parameters, with speculation that the BOJ might raise the target, or widen its tolerance band. Elsewhere, of note, the US Treasury sold 3-month paper at 2% on Monday, the highest since June 2008. Later, the US Treasury announced its quarterly financing estimates, where it estimates it will borrow $329bln in the Jul-Sep quarter (raising its estimate from $273bln), and estimates $769bln in net borrowing in H2 2018. US 10YR T-notes settled 2 ticks lower at 119-12.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP - 30 July 2018: Tech slides; Trump doubles-down on shutdown threat, says he is willing to negotiate with Iran",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities lower, Treasuries flat, crude up, dollar down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Trump doubles-down on shutdown threat; Trump willing to negotiate with Iran; CAT beats, raises guidance.<br />* COMING-UP: BOJ; EZ CPI, GDP. CBT, China NBS PMIs, US PCE, API inventories.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRUMP WATCH: </strong>US President Donald Trump doubled-down on his threat to shut the government down at the end of September, if Democrats do not give him the votes for his border security agenda (which includes his border wall project). Trump on Monday said his demands were not &lsquo;red lines&rsquo;, however, and he always leaves room for negotiation. In other geopolitics, Trump said he was prepared to meet with Iran at any time, without preconditions, to thrash a new nuclear deal out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US PENDING HOME SALES: </strong>Gained 0.9% MM in June (Expected 0.0%) &ndash; the first increase since March &ndash; though was down 2.5% YY. &ldquo;Sales continue to be hampered by the lack of homes for sale but the drag from low inventories may be fading,&rdquo; Wells Fargo said, adding that the data bodes well for future existing homes sales data. Wells does note that low inventories and affordability issues remain a hurdle, however. June&rsquo;s data did show inventories rising on a YY basis for the first time in three years, though they still remain at lean levels, particularly around the median selling price levels ($276.9k).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.6% at 2803, NDX -1.4% at 7193, DJI -0.6% at 25308. </strong>SECTORS: Energy: +0.9%, Materials: -0.2%, Industrials: -0.9%, Consumer Discretionary: -0.8%, Cons Staples: -0.1%, Health Care: +0.1%, Financials: 0.0%, Tech: -1.8%, Telecoms: +1.9%, Utilities: -0.6%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>The ES was ticking up overnight, but ran out of steam beneath 2,822, then skidding to below 2,800 in afternoon trade. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a specific catalyst for the downside, though some desks have now begun talking about the market reaching an &lsquo;exhaustion point&rsquo; (Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s equity strategists over the weekend), with a rotation from growth strategies to value strategies being seen. Ultimately, however, the ES has been going horizontally through most of July. The ES returned to the 2,800 level in late trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITY SPECIFICS: </strong>Caterpillar (CAT) reported upbeat numbers, beating on the top- and bottom-lines, boosted its share buyback facility and its guidance, propelling the Dow Mini to pre-market highs. Harley Davidson (HOG) announced it would manufacture new lightweight motorbikes for Asian markets in the face of declining demand in the US. T-Mobile (TMUS) names Nokia as the company that would supply it with $3.5b;n next-generation 5G network equipment, making the world&rsquo;s largest 5G deal so far, in a sign that the wireless upgrade cycle is taking shape. American Express (AXP) was slammed on reports it raised foreign exchange rates to clients without giving notice, which also heaped some pressure on Visa (V). After reports of sexual misconduct, CBS (CBS) said there had been no misconduct allegations nor settlements with CEO Moonves in his time at the company, though the company is probing allegations. In the energy sector, Chesapeake (CHK) plans to sell a stake in its Utica shale operations for $2bln, while KKR (KKR) and Williams Companies (WMB) formed a JV to purchase Discovery Midstream for $1.2bln. General Electric (GE) came off lows after WSJ reported that it is seeking a buyer for key parts of its digital business, citing sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U8) SETTLES $1.44 HIGHER AT $70.13; BRENT (U8) SETTLES $0.68 HIGHER AT $74.97.</strong> WTI made its way above $70.00, though, with some desks suggesting technical factors were at play. &ldquo;It calls fresh attention to the downtrend in US crude oil inventories and early estimates for a further draw of 3-4lmn bbls for the week,&rdquo; Citi writes. &ldquo;There is market talk of supply uncertainty supporting the rally, but we note Brent is lagging on today&rsquo;s advance,&rdquo; it added. Comments from Mexico&rsquo;s president-elect from last week continued to be cited on Monday (Mexico will aim to boost crude production to 2.5mln BPD). The latest OPEC survey by Reuters finds Gulf members are set to lead the output boost in July, with declines being led by Iran, Angola and Libya; total July output is seen rising 70k BPD MM to 32.64mln BPD (including Congo, the newest member of the cartel), taking it to the highest levels since October 2017. Sources reported that supply of the five North Sea crude oil grades underpinning Brent are set to average 960K BPD in September (compared to 949K BPD in August). Elsewhere, strike action at Total&rsquo;s UK North Sea oil platforms was underway on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE 2 TICKS LOWER AT 119-12. </strong>The Treasury curve steepened on Monday, though trade was thin ahead of this week&rsquo;s central bank risk events (BOJ overnight, Fed Wednesday, BOE Thursday). Selling action today was being attributed to expectations that the BOJ would adjust its yield curve control parameters, with speculation that the BOJ might raise the target, or widen its tolerance band. Elsewhere, of note, the US Treasury sold 3-month paper at 2% on Monday, the highest since June 2008. Later, the US Treasury announced its quarterly financing estimates, where it estimates it will borrow $329bln in the Jul=Sep quarter (raising its estimate from $273bln), and estimates $769bln in net borrowing in H2 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The USD started the week off on a positive note, with yuan weakness being cited for the buck selling. However, gains were given up as European/US trade progressed. Bank month-end FX rebalancing models are giving strong dollar sell signals (though Barclays notes that the signal for USDJPY is weak). Analysts aren&rsquo;t expecting much from the Fed that will change the dynamic of gradual hikes, and accordingly, are not expecting much action. Analysts were continuing to attribute USD weakness to the GDP data released on Friday, as well as positioning for other central bank activity this week (BOJ overnight, BOE Thursday, RBI, BCB, Banxico). Elsewhere, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin&rsquo;s weekend comments where he expects US growth to hover around 3% for many years, has been questioned by analysts. Commerzbank said the view &ldquo;appears unjustified, if not downright impossible,&rdquo; noting the FX implications: &ldquo;Because nonsensical growth expectations of the Secretary of the Treasury will lead to unsustainable fiscal policies and thus weigh on the USD, though it might not be seen immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling is mixed (up against the buck, down against the euro). Twin forces are playing a role. On the one hand, the BOE is expected to lift rates by 25bps on Thursday, with attention on the statement and vote split. The consensus expects a dovish hike, which UBS says leaves some scope for disappointment from the market. There was also a round of negative Brexit news flow over the weekend, with the Times on Sunday reporting that the ECJ will likely have the final say in the arbitration of arguments over the practicalities of Brexit, including disputes over the divorce bill, and the Irish backstop. On Monday, the FT reported that UK Prime Minister May was warning Tory MPs that the opposition Labour Party might try to use ancient procedures to attempt to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal if MPs vote down her Brexit compromise in the Autumn; ministers have said that May&rsquo;s office has instructed them to highlight the possibility that if partliament rejected the Chequers deal, Labour could try and orchestrate a vote to stop Brexit happening at all, the FT reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currencies were generally higher (though CHF found strength). ING expects the EUR to consolidate sideways after last week&rsquo;s snoozefest ECB meeting, though suggests that Tuesday&rsquo;s CPI and GDP might be a driver, but warns with core CPI still around 1%, there is no rush for markets to begin pricing in a hawkish stance from the ECB just yet. But if German inflation data, which came in line with expectations on Monday, is any guide, traders shouldn&rsquo;t hold their breath. Technicians eye the 1.1690 level, which the EUR will need to close above to snap a fourth straight monthly loss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Ahead of the BOJ&rsquo;s policy meeting, the yen treads water within a narrow trading range. The general playbook seems to be expecting yen strength in the event that the BOJ goes ahead with policy tweaks, and yen weakness if the BOJ refrains from policy tweaks (but cuts its inflation view) and delivers a dovish disappointment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMMODITY FX: </strong>the complex is stronger, with AUD, NZD, CAD, NOK and RUB likely all tracking crude prices higher. With that said, AUD was subdued and struggling to meaningful rise above 0.74 vs the USD, as the AUDNZD cross slips back from around 1.0900 to sub-1.0850, and with the AUD still eyeing Yuan moves following another 6.8000+ mid-point PBOC fixing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>Most EMFX took advantage of USD weakness, though the TRY did not, with some suggesting that Monday&rsquo;s weakness was a continuation of concerns about how it will conduct monetary policy going forward (more political interference, with a bias against lifting rates despite inflationary pressures). Ahead of its central bank decision this week, the BRL was also softer against the buck. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP &ndash; BOJ POLICY ANNOUNCEMENT: </strong>BoJ will discuss potential changes to YCC, and ETF buys, sources have reported. Reports also suggest the central bank may cut its inflation forecasts. Decision due after Tokyo lunch break at 0330BST/2130CDT/1030HKT on 31 July 2018. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19733/download\">Click here for full preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP &ndash; FOMC RATE DECISION:</strong> The FOMC will likely hold the fed funds rate target between 1.75-2.00%, no economic projections or post-meeting press conference with Chair Powell will leave focus on the statement. There are risks that the FOMC could issue a statement on the Fed&rsquo;s independence, following the recent critique of high rates by US President Trump, which might be interpreted in a hawkish manner. Rate decision and statement to be published at 1400 EST/1900 BST on 1 August 2018. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19736/download\">Click here to read full preview.</a></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another bank portfolio model is flashing &lsquo;sell Usd&rsquo;, and an especially strong rebalancing vs the EUR, GBP and AUD for month end, but the Greenback and index are also sagging for other reasons. Last Friday&rsquo;s US Q2 GDP data is still undermining the Dollar as the DXY slips back below 94.400, while positioning for the big trio of Central Bank meetings this week reflects market expectations for the BoJ and BoE to converge towards the Fed in terms of policy normalisation (to varying degrees). Hence, the JPY is also perky vs the Usd, and perhaps coincidentally centring on the 111.00 handle within a tight range around the big figure where 1 bn option expiries run off. Beyond that it&rsquo;s down to the BoJ and whether it does tweak policy on yield curve control and ETF buying to allow more flexibility and ultimately less accommodation, with option break-evens suggesting an 80 pip +/- move on the risk event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to the Pound, &lsquo;super Thursday&rsquo; will be pivotal as Cable sits relatively firmly above 1.3100, but capped ahead of 1.3150-75 resistance and Eur/Gbp pivots 0.8900, and aside from the anticipated &frac14; point rate hike there are several potential market-moving elements via the vote split, tone of the minutes and QIR plus Governor Carney&rsquo;s presser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/EUR/CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding all the above, the Kiwi remains neck-and-neck with the single currency and SEK (on the back of significantly stronger than expected Swedish Q2 growth) at the top of the G10 pile, with firmer recovery gains above 0.6800. Eur/Usd is back on the 1.1700 (just) and the Loonie has almost touched 1.3000 with the added fuel of strong crude prices (WTI over $70/brl and Brent above $75/brl). The Franc is testing 0.9900 to the downside, and back to the Krona it is also bid vs the Usd, but off best levels vs the Eur around 10.2500 vs 10.2300 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatively subdued and struggling to clear 0.7400 vs its US counterpart, as the Aud/Nzd cross slips back from around 1.0900 towards 1.0850, and with the Aussie Dollar still eyeing Yuan moves following another 6.8000+ mid-point PBoC fixing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note, previews of the aforementioned Central Bank policy meetings are available on the Ransquawk Research Suite.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) were in the red with the worst performing stocks pressured by corporate updates including Syrah Resources and Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) were initially choppy after the PBoC refrained from reverse repo operations for a 7th consecutive occasion but noted that month-end fiscal spending will increase bank liquidity, while further CNH weakness eventually weighed on sentiment and proved to be the deciding factor. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally lower in a continuation of the losses triggered by ongoing BoJ speculation ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s policy announcement, while T-notes were uneventful amid tentativeness ahead of the looming risk events. Heading into EU trade, the BoJ once again announced a fixed-rate JGB operation which was met with a muted reaction by the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped repo operations for a CNY 130bln net drain and said month-end fiscal spending will raise bank liquidity.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equity bourses are largely lower, with the FTSE MIB (+0.2%) the only bourse in the green, breaking through its 50 DMA of 21,913. Equity specific news is supporting the FTSE MIB and IBEX with Mediaset (+3.0%) reporting positive earnings. The AEX (-0.4%) is currently the underperforming bourse as index heavy-weights Heineken (-4.1%) and Altice (-2.4%) are both in the red on the back of negatively revised guidance and a branch sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at sectors, broad based losses are being seen with slight underperformance noted in the IT sector, following on from uninspiring performance in US counterparts on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GVC Holdings (+4.8%) has assured a USD 200mln tie-up with the MGM group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traders now look ahead to after-market earnings, with French energy provider EDF and Pharma group Sanofi set to report Q2 figures. In terms of US earnings, Dow Jones heavyweight Caterpillar is to report at 07:30EDT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK - Ahead this week&rsquo;s main events (BoJ, Fed, BoE and NFP), Scandi data has sprung some surprises and sparked marked divergence between the Crowns, with Norwegian retail sales down sharply in June (and more than reversing the previous month&rsquo;s gain even after an upward revision) in stark contrast to stellar Q2 Swedish GDP in both q/q and y/y terms. In response, Eur/Nok mostly firmer within a 9.5535-5320 range vs Eur/Sek down from around 10.3100 to just over 10.2300 and the cross declining to circa 1.0735. Note, however, a US bank has shorted Eur/Nok above 9.5400 and is looking for a pronounced fall/reversal to 9.4200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY - Cable is back above 1.3100 and Eur/Gbp hovering around 0.8900 ahead of a widely expected BoE rate hike this Thursday, but with the Pound not really reacting to firmer than forecast UK data (on balance) in the form of BoE consumer credit, mortgage approvals and lending, Chart-wise, 1.3150-75 represents near term resistance, while at least one major house believes a 25 bp tightening move is already priced in and has now gone short for a 1.2810 profit target. Conversely, amidst ongoing speculation about hawkish BoJ policy tweaks, Usd/Jpy is pivoting 111.00 and another US bank is eyeing a short position if the headline hits 111.40 for 104.00. Note, a decent 1 bn expiry runs off at 111.00 today and 111.27 forms technical resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/NZD - The next best G10 performers, after the Sek, with the single currency at the upper end of a 1.1650-90 range vs the Dollar after German state CPI indicating a modest upside bias for the national reading vs 2.1% y/y consensus. Meanwhile, a still very short Kiwi market is re-positioning again as weekly CFTC data shows the bearish base close to record levels and the likes of the BNZ see potential for a squeeze. Nzd/Usd back on the 0.6800 handle in response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/AUD - All narrowly mixed and close to recent ranges vs the Greenback, with the Franc at the low end of 0.9920-55 parameters, Loonie meandering between 1.3050-80 and Aud attempting to recover 0.7400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Yuan and Lira have picked up where they left off last week, on the back foot, with Usd/Cny, Usd/Cnh and Usd/Try all higher. The PBoC set the on-shore fix at 6.8121, while the Lira continues to suffer after last week&rsquo;s shock CBRT decision to leave key rates unchanged, with the focus now switching to the latest Inflation Report on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reversal from early intraday highs has continued and losses have accelerated pretty sharply with big figure breaks triggering some stops and then more pronounced declines once previous mtd lows were tested or even breached. The rationale, a broad return to bear-steepening, caution ahead of BoJ and BoE policy meetings and concerns about US funding and the yield curve, along with technical that have obviously turned more negative. Looking at Eurex and Liffe in more detail, Bunds are down to 161.52, -55 ticks, Gilts at 122.66, -48 ticks and US Treasuries also at fresh troughs for the overnight session with the long bond circa &frac12; point adrift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (+1.1%) and Brent Crude (+0.2%) have recuperated losses (with the latter retesting USD 74.50/bbl to the upside) seen at the back end of last week following an uptick in the Baker Hughes rig count while Mexican President Obrador stated his administration will hike crude production by 600K BPD. Though news flow remains relatively light, a 12-hour strike is to start at Total&rsquo;s UK offshore platforms at 12:00BST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metals trade mostly lower with spot gold marginally easing, yet still rangebound, moving with an uneventful greenback ahead of key risk events this week (FOMC interest rate decision on Wednesday, US jobs data on Friday). Copper continues to trade lower while reports stated that workers at the world&rsquo;s largest copper mine, Escondida mine in Chile, have rejected the final contract offer over wages and are voting whether to go on strike.</p>\r\n",

Equity specific news is supporting the FTSE MIB and IBEX with Mediaset (+2.0%) reporting positive earnings and Sabadell (+2.7%) upgraded at KBW to outperform from underperform. The AEX (-0.3%) is currently the underperforming bourse as index heavy-weights Heineken (-5.0%) and Altice are both in the red on the back of negatively revised guidance and a branch sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at sectors, broad based losses are being seen with slight underperformance noted in the IT sector, following on from uninspiring performance in US counterparts on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GVC Holdings (+5.0%) has assured a USD 200mln tie-up with the MGM group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the GEA Group (+6.0%) and Air Liquide (-2.6%) reported earnings, with GEA beating expectations and Air Liquide operating income falling short of expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traders now look ahead to after-market earnings, with French energy provider EDF and Pharma group Sanofi set to report Q2 figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead this week&rsquo;s main events (BoJ, Fed, BoE and NFP), Scandi data has sprung some surprises and sparked marked divergence between the Crowns, with Norwegian retail sales down sharply in June (and more than reversing the previous month&rsquo;s gain even after an upward revision) in stark contrast to stellar Q2 Swedish GDP in both q/q and y/y terms. In response, Eur/Nok mostly firmer within a 9.5535-5320 range vs Eur/Sek down from around 10.3100 to just over 10.2300 and the cross declining to circa 1.0735.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began the week lacklustre after the tech-led declines last Friday on Wall Street and amid cautiousness ahead of this week&#39;s slew of risk events, while further CNH weakness also dampened sentiment. ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) were in the red with the worst performing stocks pressured by corporate updates including Syrah Resources which downgraded FY18 output guidance and Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma despite topping forecasts for Q1 net, as its oper. profit and revenue declined Y/Y. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) were initially choppy after the PBoC refrained from reverse repo operations for a 7th consecutive occasion but noted that month-end fiscal spending will increase bank liquidity, while further CNH weakness eventually weighed on sentiment and proved to be the deciding factor. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally lower in a continuation of the losses triggered by ongoing BoJ speculation ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s policy announcement, while T-notes were uneventful amid tentativeness ahead of the looming risk events.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begins the week lacklustre after the tech-led declines last Friday on Wall Street and amid cautiousness ahead of this week&#39;s slew of risk events, while further CNH weakness has also clouded risk sentiment. ASX 200 (-0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) are in the red with the worst performing stocks pressured by corporate updates including Syrah Resources which downgraded FY18 output guidance and Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma despite topping forecasts for Q1 net, as its oper. profit and revenue declined Y/Y. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are choppy after the PBoC refrained from reverse repo operations for a 7th consecutive occasion but noted that month-end fiscal spending will increase bank liquidity, while participants also digest continued CNH weakness and with China&rsquo;s reduced negative list of industries banned from foreign investment taking effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price action across the major FX pairs are quiet due to a lack of data releases and amid a tentative tone ahead of an abundance of central bank activity including policy decisions from the BoJ, Fed, BoE and RBI, while the latest NFP data on Friday tops off this week&rsquo;s storm of risk events. As such, the greenback is flat which has kept price action in EUR/USD and GBP/USD restricted with the latter just about holding onto the 1.3100 handle. Elsewhere, JPY is indecisive amid the varied speculation regarding potential policy tweaks by the BoJ, while antipodeans are lacklustre with only brief pressure seen as CNH dropped another 500 pips against the greenback after the PBoC resumed its weakening of the reference rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally lower in a continuation of the losses triggered by ongoing BoJ speculation, while T-notes begin the week uneventful amid tentativeness ahead of the looming risk events.</p>\r\n",
