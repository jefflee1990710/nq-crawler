(Independent)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Tusk said there will be no withdrawal deal without an Irish backstop and that the Chequers framework for economic cooperation will not work. Tusk also commented that the moment of truth on Brexit talks is October and noted both sides need to compromise further but added there are some issues we are not ready to compromise on. Tusk further stated he is a little more optimistic on the positive outcome but does not exclude a no-deal and feel we can formalise our deal in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Retail Sales (Aug) M/M 0.3% vs. Exp. -0.2% (Prev. 0.7%, Rev. 0.9%).

Praet also commented the Euro area continues to expand at a rate that is above potential and that money market rates imply a very moderate pace of rate hikes beyond the expected date of lift off. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&#39;s Deputy PM Di Maio said he never wanted to bring down the government and reiterated being committed to keep election promises, which followed earlier reports that Di Maio had threatened to ditch coalition over budget talks.

UK PM May is preparing to make a fresh compromise in negotiations to try and break the deadlock over the Irish border issue by accepting some checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, the Independent reported, though none of that was evident in post-Salzburg press briefings. Meanwhile, the pressure continues to mount on PM May, the Telegraph reported that the PM will be forced to &ldquo;stand down soon after March&quot;, citing an internal Conservative Party memo, which has reportedly been heavily circulated among Tory MPs; the memo provides analysis of potential replacements, including Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson. In terms of future outlook, a UK Cabinet Minister said that there is an 85-95% chance of getting a Brexit deal, noting that the UK has provided a customs proposal that he believes would work while EU&#39;s Moscovici reported the European Commission are totally committed to a Brexit deal, and a good one is still possible. Finally, a report from APA announced the Brexit summit is set for November 17th - 18th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TUSK/JUNCKER CONFERENCE: </strong>At the Salzburg conference EU&rsquo;s Tusk appeared a little more optimistic on a Brexit agreement but did not exclude a no-deal scenario, noting the EU is nonetheless prepared for such an outcome. He said there will be no withdrawal deal without an Irish backstop, urging for tough, clear and prices guarantees on Ireland. He however noted Chequers framework for economic cooperation will not work. He stressed Brexit talks must end in October, noting the time is right for a deal adding that if it can be formalised in November, he will call a summit in November but not as an emergency. He also vowed both sides need to compromise further though he said there are some issues are not ready to be negotiated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Reports in Italy continue to provide conflicting signals with regards to the Italian budget; Messaggero reports that coalition partners are still shooting for a higher deficit to fund its populist programmes, while Repubblica said the government is considering a VAT hike on some items to offset a cut in personal income taxes, though this was denied later by PM Conte; the PM also added that Italy&rsquo;s budget will show the government keeps account sin order. Separately, Italy Deputy PM Di Maio dismissed suggestions that he wanted to bring down the government, and Italy&rsquo;s League says it intends to govern with Five Star for five years, and will respect the points of the government programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>US President Trump will nominate Nellie Liang to the Fed&#39;s Board of Governors, the White House said on Wednesday. Liang is an ex-Fed economist who created its first office of financial stability. Separately, CNBC reported Fed&#39;s Powell is said to be ramping up meetings with lawmakers as he seeks to protect Fed&#39;s independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SARB: </strong>The South African Reserve Bank kept rates unchanged as expected at 6.50%; the vote split was 4-3 against a rate hike. Nonetheless the statement tilted to the hawkish side as the SARB recognised that, even though inflation moderated in August, a weaker ZAR vs. the USD as well as higher oil prices are contributing further to upside price pressure. Furthermore, as part of the statement, the SARB model said to forecast headline inflation peaking at levels closer to the upper end of the 3%-6% target range whilst indicating the ZAR is undervalued at that the current level with the implied starting point at USD 14.20. Nonetheless, the CPI outlook for this year was left unchanged at 4.8%, whilst 2019 outlook was revised higher to 5.7% in (Prev. 5.6%) and 2020 was also untouched at 5.4%. On the flip side, the central bank evaluated the growth outlook as being to the downside and thus revised down its 2018 growth forecast to 0.7% (Prev. 1.2%) whilst leaving the 2019 and 2020 forecasts at 1.9% and 2.0% respectively. With regards to the outlook for monetary policy, Governor Kganyago noted the bank&rsquo;s model projects a 25bps hike by the end of 2020, though highlighting monetary policy does not have further room to provide economic stimulus. TD Securities, which previously expected rates to remain on hold for the rest of the year, is now both pencilling in a rate hike at the MPC November meeting based on the upside inflation risks; TD Securities does however note that if the Rand rallies on its recent recovery it &lsquo;might incline the MPC not to hike&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NORGES BANK:</strong> The Norges Bank increased interest rates for the first time since 2011 by 25bps as was unanimously expected to 0.75%. A bulk of the focus fell on the surprise move by the bank to release a flatter than expected rate path with the policymakers shedding doubt on a rate hike in December (but not ruling it out). Nordea and Deutsche Bank had been looking for a steeper path on the basis that inflation figures were nearing the NB&rsquo;s targets. Oxford Eco noted in the fallout, however, that &ldquo;the NB operates a multi mandate where financial stability and growth is taken seriously, so inflation may not always be the biggest concern. &rdquo;The dovish surprise weakened the NOK over 1%, which had been strengthening in the lead up on expectations of a steeper rate path, but Oxford Eco &ldquo;expect the krone to appreciate through the rest of the year and reach EUR/NOK 9.40 by the year end&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.8% at 2931, NDX +1.1% at 7569, DJI +1.0% at 26657. SECTORS: Energy -0.1%, Materials +1.1%, Industrials +0.1%, Cons Discretionary +0.7%, Cons Staples +1.2%, Healthcare +0.9%, Financials +0.8%, Tech +1.2%, Telecoms +0.5%, Utilities +0.1%.</strong> Fresh record highs for stocks were attributed to an easing of trade concerns. Under Armour (UAA) was higher after raising its EPS view. Tribune (TRCO) rose on news that Nexstar (NXST) is eyeing the company, according to Dealreporter. Autodesk (ADSK) firmed after a PT hike at Canaccord. Macquarie raised Viacom (VIAB) to outperform, buoying shares. Red Hat (RHT) reported EPS AMC on Wednesday, and guidance disappointed sending shares lower on Thursday. Defence stocks (NOC, LMT, GD, RTN, LLL) were lower for a second day on continued talk of North Korean denuclearisation. Department stores (JWN, KSS, M) were all lower. General Electric (GE) was lower after raising concerns about its new H-Class gas turbines. In M&amp;A, Adobe (ADBE) is said to be closing in on the acquisition of software company Marketo for $5bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8, EXPIRES) SETTLES $0.32 LOWER AT $70.80/BBL; WTI (X8) SETTLES $0.45 LOWER AT $70.32; BRENT (X8) SETTLES $0.70 LOWER AT $78.70/BBL. </strong>US President Trump once again took aim at high oil prices, and tweeted that the &#39;OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!&#39; adding that &#39;[the USA] protect[s] the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember.&#39; With regards to OPEC, ahead of their meeting which will not be attended by Iran, the Iranian energy minister said OPEC and its allies&rsquo; monitoring committees has no right to reverse the oil production quotas, and threatened to veto any such action. Iran is encouraged by crude prices at $80/bbl the oil minister stated. The Petroleum Association of Japan said that Japanese refiners were likely to halt purchases of Iranian crude from around mid-September; the Indians, however, will lift 10mln barrels of Iranian crude in October, which is unchanged vs September. In Iraq, southern oil exports were running at 3.6mln BPD in September (in August, they averaged 3.583mln BPD). Broker Standard Chartered lifted its 2019 Brent forecast by $3 to $78/bbl, and nudged up its 2019 forecast by $7 to $85/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 1 TICK HIGHER AT 118-19.</strong> Yields were modestly higher across the Treasury curve, and major curve spreads also narrowed slightly. Talk of the day was short-covering led by the long end as yields eyed 3.25% for the long-bond. A 10yr TIPS auctioned tailed by 1.5bps</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD:&nbsp;</strong>Some have questioned why the USD is not rallying as yields along the Treasury curve rise. Morgan Stanley suggests that the reason is because the US has turned into an importer of capital as it fails to fund its fiscal expansion domestically. &ldquo;Ergo, its current account and fiscal deficits are on the rise.&rdquo; MS explains that &ldquo;yield differentials and the USD show the conditions under which the US imports capital: &ldquo;When global liquidity conditions are ample, generally when the rest of the world loses its growth dynamic compared to the US, capital imports tend to be easy to generate, pushing USD stronger,&rdquo; and conversely, &ldquo;when bond yields rise globally, it becomes more difficult for the US to attract sufficient capital to fund its deficits.&rdquo; The dollar&rsquo;s moves on Thursday helped the EUR to finally break above 1.17 meaningfully, with the sing currency patrolling HOD (some technical plays involved) as we head into APAC trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling was buoyed after strong retail sales, as the UK upside data surprises keep on coming in. GBP rose to within touching distance of 1.33, before stabilising around 1.3250+. Sterling traders were also content to look through warnings from the EU, which clearly show there is much work to be done in marrying the positions of the UK/EU. From a technical perspective, 1.3363 (July) high is now in focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD:&nbsp;</strong>With traders awaiting NAFTA updates, the Loonie rose to a three-and-a-half month high on Thursday, largely helped along by a weaker USD, as well as yield differentials favouring the CAD. TD Securities notes NAFTA headlines continue to create gyrations in USDCAD, with CAD traders particularly sensitive to the news that a deal will not be reached this week. The USDCAD fell to below 1.29 at one point in Thursday&rsquo;s trading, and is straddling the figure going into APAC trade. TD Securities now eyes the range lows in the 1.2880-1.2900. &ldquo;Canadian front end yields outpaced the move in US yields yesterday too, which keeps the pressure on the pair,&rdquo; TD says, but notes that it is cautious of chasing this move here. However, despite TD looking for a weak CPI and retail sales print tomorrow, it sees risks of a break lower especially given the supportive external backdrop (higher oil/buoyant risk sentiment).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD: </strong>Rallied after GDP beat expectations to the upside, printing 1.0% QQ, the highest quarterly rate in two years. However, the RBNZ still will unlikely give up its option to cut rates ahead, Credit Agricole said, citing recent comments from Asst Governor McDermott, who signalled that the Q3 data is the focus since that is when the government&rsquo;s spending will filter through and raise growth (McDermott also said that if that boost fails to materialize, the RBNZ would have to reconsider where it is in terms of policy). Additionally, leading indicators for growth (consumer and business confidence) imply a significant slowing in growth in the coming six months, Credit Agricole added.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRY: </strong>The Lira was (as always) choppy, weakening after the government&rsquo;s medium term economic plan, which analysts at Informa suggested that the Treasury and Economy minister failed in backing up investor confidence after the CBT rate rise. However, emerging markets have performed well on Thursday, and theat helped the Lira, which fell to around 6.1250 after the release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BRL: </strong>Far-right Presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro continues to gain ground in the polls, though leftist Fernando Haddad is hot on his heels, with the latest polling data pointing towards a second-round at next month&#39;s elections. The BCB&rsquo;s commentary that it has left the door open to rate hikes was also providing support.</p>\r\n",

We will remember.&#39; With regards to OPEC, ahead of their meeting which will not be attended by Iran, the Iranian energy minister said OPEC and its allies&rsquo; monitoring committees has no right to reverse the oil production quotas, and threatened to veto any such action. Iran is encouraged by crude prices at $80/bbl the oil minister stated. The Petroleum Association of Japan said that Japanese refiners were likely to halt purchases of Iranian crude from around mid-September; the Indians, however, will lift 10mln barrels of Iranian crude in October, which is unchanged vs September. In Iraq, southern oil exports were running at 3.6mln BPD in September (in August, they averaged 3.583mln BPD). Broker Standard Chartered lifted its 2019 Brent forecast by $3 to $78/bbl, and nudged up its 2019 forecast by $7 to $85/bbl.</p>\r\n",

Indeed, the Nok is weaker and has underperformed even though the Norges Bank duly delivered on a &frac14; point hike as the updated repo rate path was trimmed and next tightening move flagged for Q1 2019, albeit with December still not completely wiped out. Eur/Nok just below 9.6000 vs circa 9.5000 at one stage. However, the Franc only dipped marginally and briefly post-SNB as the Chf was deemed &lsquo;highly&rsquo; valued again rather than anything stronger, before regaining strength as the Dollar continued to sell-off (DXY now down through 94.000 amidst widespread declines vs major and EM counterparts). Usd/Chf currently testing bids/support around 0.9600. Meanwhile, a tight 4-3 SARB vote for steady rates, in line with consensus, and hawkish inflation outlook hardly dented Rand recovery momentum through 14.5000 and not far from another tech support level around 14.3600 after breaching 14.6000 earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi and Pound both benefited from better than expected data in the form of NZ GDP and UK retail sales (latter on top of CPI yesterday), with Nzd/Usd rallying above 0.6650 and Cable revisiting 1.3200+ levels, Eur/Gbp piercing a key DMA around 0.8863, and the former extending to the upside just shy of 1.3300 amidst mainly hopeful if not quite confident Brexit deal headlines emerging from Salzburg via UK and EU officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/AUD/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best G10 performers vs the Greenback, with the single currency finally clearing the 1.1720-40 offer zone and 1.1750 on the way to around 1.1775, while the Aud inched closer to 0.7300 and Sek decoupled from its Scandi peer to post a gain vs the Eur (cross sub-10.3300) following Riksbank rhetoric noting that Swedish inflation is on target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhat leggy and unable to take real advantage of the latest broad Usd downturn with the Loonie and Jpy perhaps both hampered by heavy option expiry interest given 1.2 bn in Usd/Cad at 1.2900 and 1.1 bn between 112.00-20 in Usd/Jpy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zar aside, mixed fortunes across the region with the Try retreating after the eagerly-awaited Turkish MTEP on some realisation that while the slower growth and deteriorating fiscal projections did take into account recent developments, they could still be conservative. Conversely, the Rub retained a bid as the CBR maintained its forecast for a stronger Rouble by year end.</p>\r\n",

The FTSE is the underperformer and weighed on by a bid GBP, that is being driven by some positivity coming from the Salzburg Brexit summit and better than expected UK retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial sector outperformance is being driven by recent price action in yields, with returns rising across Europe over the week, and lifting banking stocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK - An almost classic case of buy the rumour and sell the fact, but with fundamental reason as the Norges Bank confounded hawkish expectations after a unanimously expected 25 bp hike by tweaking down its forward rate trajectory and signalling the next tightening move in Q1 next year rather than December. Governor Olsson subsequently said a hike before year end is not completely off the table, but Eur/Nok has only eased marginally off highs close to 9.6200 vs around 9.5000 ahead of the policy pronouncements. Note, the SEK followed a similar path, albeit within tighter 10.3860-3490 constraints following the Riksbank&rsquo;s roll back on rate hike timing earlier this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/GBP - In contrast to Scandi underperformance, or retracement, the Kiwi and Pound have both been boosted by better than expected data in the form of NZ GDP and UK retail sales (latter on top of CPI yesterday), with Nzd/Usd rallying above 0.6650 and Cable revisiting 1.3200+ levels, while Eur/Gbp has technically breached a key DMA around 0.8863.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - Also firmer vs the Greenback, but the single currency is still finding gains over 1.1700 tough to sustain amidst ongoing Italian budget disputes, Brexit stalemate and yield divergence. Note also, big option expiries spread relatively evenly either side of the big figure may also be keeping the pair relatively rangebound - 1.1600 (1.2 bn), 1.1625-35 (1 bn), 1.1650-60 (536 mn) 1.1670-80 (1 bn), 1.1700 (1 bn) and 1.1730-40 (1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/AUD/JPY - All rather muted and tight vs the Usd, with the Franc not really deriving any direction or inspiration from the SNB (policy review a carbon copy of the June quarterly assessment, and Chf still regarded as highly valued, not over or excessively strong) and meandering between 0.9655-80, while the Loonie is hovering just below 1.2900 awaiting more NAFTA news. Aud/Usd remains underpinned within 0.7255-75 parameters, but capped by latest warnings from the RBA about the potential economic cost of an all out trade war, and Usd/Jpy has drifted down marginally following a &lsquo;close&rsquo; on Wednesday below 112.50 and a 112.38 Fib, while eyeing 1.1 bn expiries at 112.00-20 for the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Lively trade, and mainly more recovery gains with the Try front-running Turkey&rsquo;s MTP, but conceding some ground once the details revealed weak growth forecasts along with broader adverse effects of sanctions and domestic frailties. Conversely, the Zar continues to fly high into the SARB and Rub unwinds more of its losses amidst CBR projections for further strength by year end</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It remains relatively rangebound for core bonds that are still taking a breather after recent bear steepening, and highlighted by Gilts hardly reacting to another UK data beat in the shape of August retail sales, and sticking within 120.64-80 Liffe parameters through a comfortable 10 year DMO auction. Similarly, Bunds are showing little inclination to break from 158.58-78 confines, and interestingly those boundaries essentially align with near term technical support and resistance on a chart from a market contact. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are firmly in outright and curve corrective mode ahead of a busier line up of data and 10 year TIPS supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil market is marginally higher and hanging around recent highs, with traders now looking ahead to comments from the upcoming OPEN/Non-OPEC meeting in Algeria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initial comments have been seen from Iran, where they stated a defiant tone vs. the JMMC&rsquo;s proposed production quota changes, saying the JMMC &ldquo;have no right to decide on members&#39; production quota&rdquo; and warned &ldquo;that they will veto OPEC decisions that harm their interests&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libya&#39;s petroleum facilities guards close Wafa oil fields airport, according to the NOC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In metals markets, gold is essentially unmoved and hanging within a tight range around the 1200-1205/oz level.&nbsp; Copper is following in line with most precious metals and is in the red for the day, but still near 3 week highs at USD 275/lb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An official from China&#39;s Baosteel says China&#39;s iron ore demand has reached a peak</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An almost classic case of buy the rumour and sell the fact, but with fundamental reason as the Norges Bank confounded hawkish expectations after a unanimously expected 25 bp hike by tweaking down its forward rate trajectory and signalling the next tightening move in Q1 next year rather than December. Governor Olsson subsequently said a hike before year end is not completely off the table, but Eur/Nok has only eased marginally off highs close to 9.6200 vs around 9.5000 ahead of the policy pronouncements. Note, the SEK followed a similar path, albeit within tighter 10.3860-3490 constraints following the Riksbank&rsquo;s roll back on rate hike timing earlier this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to Scandi underperformance, or retracement, the Kiwi and Pound have both been boosted by better than expected data in the form of NZ GDP and UK retail sales (latter on top of CPI yesterday), with Nzd/Usd rallying above 0.6650 and Cable revisiting 1.3200+ levels, while Eur/Gbp has technically breached a key DMA around 0.8863.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also firmer vs the Greenback, but the single currency is still finding gains over 1.1700 tough to sustain amidst ongoing Italian budget disputes, Brexit stalemate and yield divergence. Note also, big option expiries spread relatively evenly either side of the big figure may also be keeping the pair relatively rangebound - 1.1600 (1.2 bn), 1.1625-35 (1 bn), 1.1650-60 (536 mn) 1.1670-80 (1 bn), 1.1700 (1 bn) and 1.1730-40 (1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/AUD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All rather muted and tight vs the Usd, with the Franc not really deriving any direction or inspiration from the SNB (policy review a carbon copy of the June quarterly assessment, and Chf still regarded as highly valued, not over or excessively strong) and meandering between 0.9655-80, while the Loonie is hovering just below 1.2900 awaiting more NAFTA news. Aud/Usd remains underpinned within 0.7255-75 parameters, but capped by latest warnings from the RBA about the potential economic cost of an all out trade war, and Usd/Jpy has drifted down marginally following a &lsquo;close&rsquo; on Wednesday below 112.50 and a 112.38 Fib, while eyeing 1.1 bn expiries at 112.00-20 for the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lively trade, and mainly more recovery gains with the Try front-running Turkey&rsquo;s MTP, but conceding some ground once the details revealed weak growth forecasts along with broader adverse effects of sanctions and domestic frailties. Conversely, the Zar continues to fly high into the SARB and Rub unwinds more of its losses amidst CBR projections for further strength by year end.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) lagged after it fell short of the 6200 level and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) extended on 8-month highs as participants awaited the LDP leadership vote for PM Abe and in turn Abenomics; a vote which he won heading into the EU session. Elsewhere. Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were choppy amid a lack of fresh drivers and after PBoC liquidity efforts still amounted to a net daily drain, while focus in Hong Kong was on Hong Kong&rsquo;s 2nd largest tech IPO this year Meituan Dianping which rose around 7% on its debut. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher after prices found support ahead of the 150.00 level and which also coincided with a mild overnight recovery in T-notes, although price action was restricted amid a 20yr auction which showed weaker results across all metrics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 40bln via 7-day and CNY 30bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily drain of CNY 30bln. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8530 (Prev. 6.8569)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chequers plan was said to cause divide among EU leaders with some countries calling for EU to engage with the UK and with others unwilling to make concessions, while leaders are to meet Thursday afternoon without PM May to discuss their response to the proposal. (Times) In related news, Lithuania&rsquo;s President said there was a standstill and currently no progress after PM May spoke at the EU leaders&#39; dinner, while the Slovakia PM also said no progress was made on Irish border issue after PM May spoke at Salzburg dinner. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May reiterated ahead of dinner with EU leaders that Chequers is the right proposal and only credible option, while she also repeated that the EU will need to evolve its position as the UK has done. PM May also ruled out a second referendum again and emphasised the UK will leave EU, while there were earlier reports that UK PM May is said to reject Barnier&#39;s Brexit proposal for the Irish border. (Newswires/Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Minister Raab said we need the EU side to move in our direction in Brexit talks and it will be a lose-lose for both sides if we don&rsquo;t get that movement. Raab also ruled out a second referendum and said Chequers is the only credible plan, while he also believes a deal is close and that it is a little late in the day for an alternative Brexit proposal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Juncker said the EU and the UK are far away from a Brexit deal, while Irish PM Varadkar also stated UK and EU are no closer to a Brexit deal than they were in March and reiterated Ireland would suffer in a no-deal scenario. Furthermore, Austrian Chancellor Kurz said we will arrange a special EU summit on Brexit in November. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May ally Mike Penning labelled the Chequers plan &#39;dead as a dodo&#39;. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telegraph reports showed a leaked Conservative Party dossier from April related to plan to replace PM May and which ranked her possible successors. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian economy minister Tria is looking for a 2019 deficit cap of 1.8%, according to sources. (Newswires) This followed comments from Italian PM Conte that next year&rsquo;s budget will not exceed 2% of output. (Newswires) Furthermore, reports also suggest that Italy are looking at a selective VAT hike. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback was lacklustre with the DXY stuck around the 94.50 level. This kept trade in EUR/USD uneventful and GBP/USD also struggled for direction amid a lack of progress and standstill following PM May&rsquo;s Salzburg dinner address. Elsewhere, high-beta currencies held on to most their recent gains with AUD/USD flat and USD/CAD near a 1-month low, while NZD/USD outperformed after New Zealand GDP for Q2 topped estimates and grew at the fastest pace in 2 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand GDP (Q2) Q/Q 1.0% vs. Exp. 0.7% (Prev. 0.5%). (Newswires)<br />New Zealand GDP (Q2) Y/Y 2.8% vs. Exp. 2.5% (Prev. 2.7%, Rev. 2.6%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities traded higher in which WTI crude futures extended on the prior day&rsquo;s strength despite the narrower than expected draw in DoE headline inventories as it still showed a decline in inventories as opposed to the surprise API build. Elsewhere, gold prices saw modest gains amid a lacklustre greenback and silver eyed weekly high, while copper also conformed to the mild upside in the complex.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is said to be ready to immediately resume negotiations with North Korea on nuclear disarmament, while Secretary of State Pompeo said he invited his North Korean Foreign Minister Ri to talks in New York next week amid UN general assembly. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bear-steepening was the theme once again, with steepening, with major curve spreads widening by between 1-3bps. As 10-year yields continue to rise, strategists have begun to question high far they will need to rise before markets react with a tantrum. There wasn&rsquo;t any signs of discomfort in Wednesday&rsquo;s trade, with the 10yr yield climbing to a high around 3.09%. Earlier in the week, GS said it wouldn&rsquo;t be considered a meaningful sell-off until 3.05% was cleared, which could then open the door to 3.109%, the high from May. The 5-year sector was also capturing attention, with yields closing in on decade-highs. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 7+ ticks lower at 118-18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is set to nominate Former Fed economist Nellie Liang for seat on Fed board.

Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) is higher and extends on 8-month highs with participants awaiting the LDP leadership vote where PM Abe and in turn Abenomics, are widely expected to be prolonged for another 3-year term, while ASX 200 (-0.2%) lags its peers after falling short of the 6200 level. Elsewhere. Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are positive but with gains capped amid a lack of fresh drivers and after PBoC liquidity efforts still amounted to a net daily drain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is lacklustre with the DXY stuck just under the 94.50 level amid mild gains in EUR/USD, while GBP/USD struggles for direction amid a lack of progress and with the situation at a standstill following PM May&rsquo;s Salzburg dinner address. Elsewhere, high-beta currencies hold on to most their recent gains with AUD/USD flat and USD/CAD near a 1-month low, while NZD/USD outperformed after New Zealand GDP for Q2 topped estimates and grew at the fastest pace in 2 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher after prices found support ahead of the 150.00 level and which also coincides with a mild overnight recovery in T-notes.</p>\r\n",
