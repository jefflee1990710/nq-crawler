        "content": "<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is said to plan further trade retaliations if the US acts obstinately, according to China state media reports. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX<a name=\"_Hlk503148913\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148890\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148850\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk507704203\">The DXY starts the Month/quarter slightly lower, mainly hit by USDJPY, which slid to 105.65 as risk sentiment was hit by China&rsquo;s trade war escalation; there was also modest buying after the March ISM non-manufacturing survey fell short of expectations. The yen largely ignored the latest Tankan survey, released overnight. The EUR traded a narrow range, finding its way back to the 1.23 handle as we head into Asia, having seen 1.2280 as stocks dropped near the open. GBP was up against the USD and EUR, gapping higher at Sunday&rsquo;s open after it was reported that the UK has a proposal to resolve the Irish border issue; the plan would see the UK act as an &#39;external frontier&#39; for the EU, collecting tariffs and carrying out other checks at the border, and will be discussed with EU officials later this month. CAD and MXN were initially resilient to Trump&rsquo;s NAFTA threats on Twitter, though both have succumbed to USD strength as commodity FX and EMs are generally weaker against the buck; the CAD has made its way back up to the top end of the recent 1.2850-1.2950 range. AUD, meanwhile, is consolidating around the 0.7650 level ahead of this week&rsquo;s RBA (expected unchanged).</a><br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI was horizontal above $65.00 as NY traders returned from the long-weekend; fears of escalating Trade Wars injected a risk-off tone to Monday trade, which saw equities &ndash; and subsequently crude &ndash; under pressure. The risk-off tone was helped by pre-market news that Russia reported that March output rose to 10.97mln BPD, up from February&rsquo;s 10.95mln, making Russia the largest crude producer, overtaking the US. The news didn&rsquo;t immediately move the crude complex, perhaps because European markets were shut due to Bank Holiday. Additionally, over the weekend, Bahrain announced it made the largest oil discovery in its history, which eclipses its current reserves (estimated to be up to 200mln bbls), adding to the global oversupply narrative. More details are expected this week. This week, analysts expect to see crude stocks build by 1.7mln barrels (which would be the second consecutive build), distillate stocks are seen drawing 500k bbls, and gasoline stocks are seen drawing 1.5mln bbls. WTI futures (June) settled USD 1.69 lower at USD 63.18 per barrel; Brent (June) settled USD 1.70 lower at USD 67.64/bbl</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia Energy minister Novak said Russia is committed to reaching balance on global oil market. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Trade Adviser Navarro said markets should relax and that the economy is performing well, while also stated they need to be hopeful regarding NAFTA negotiations. Furthermore, Navarro added that China is stealing US stuff but does not believe US and China will pursue an &#39; action-response&#39; escalation of trade dispute. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said to push for a NAFTA deal &#39;in principle&#39; within a fortnight, while there were also reports of speculation that a NAFTA deal could be announced at the Summits of Americas on April 13<sup>th</sup>-14<sup>th</sup>. (Newswires)<br /><br />US Markit Manufacturing PMI (Mar F): 55.6 (Exp. 55.7; Flash 55.7; Prev. 55.3). (Newswires)<br />US ISM Manufacturing PMI (Mar) 59.3 vs. Exp. 60.1 (Prev. 60.8)<br />US Construction Spending (Feb) M/M 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.0%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Europe, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada on a market holiday, liquidity was thin, and price action was choppy, amid the risk-off tone begotten by a perceived escalation of Trade Wars by China overnight, where it announced it would apply tariffs of up to 25% on imports of US pork, wine, and nuts (many analysts have downplayed the impact, though the likes of Tyson Foods were hit on the news). Equity futures were traversing sideways pre-market in negative territory, but it was only just before the cash open when selling intensified as NY traders returned from the long-weekend. All sectors were red, but tech was a notable underperformer with Amazon pressuring equities after Trump&rsquo;s antagonistic tweeting, while consumer discretionary was also whacked. Technical selling pressure entered after the SPX fell below its 200dma around 2590, before stabilising around 2560 (the index closes beneath its 200dma ending a 448-day run). Tesla&rsquo;s woes helped dragged the Nasdaq lower, helping the Composite to join the SPX and DJIA in technical correction territory. SPX -2.3% at 2580, DJIA -2.0% at 23,629, NDX -2.9% at 6391.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TPLEX begins the new month/quarter bid, with the complex fulfilling its role as a safe-haven amid the stock slide. But it is worth keeping these moves in context; volume was naturally thinner in holiday trading conditions, and T-Note futures settle a mere four ticks higher (despite 10-year yields falling to 2.7170%, the lowest since early February. Major curve spreads saw only modest flattening (between 0.5bps to 2bps), and in the pre-market &ndash; before the stocks&rsquo; slide &ndash; the curve was bear-steepening.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT:&nbsp;</strong>Equities down, DXY down, Treasuries up, crude down, gold up.<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW:&nbsp;</strong>China to put tariffs on US pork, fruit, nuts; ISM manufacturing misses.<br /><strong>*&nbsp;AHEAD:&nbsp;</strong>Kashkari (non-voter, Monday after market); Fed chair Powell (Friday); NFP (Friday).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX -2.3% at 2580, DJIA -2.0% at 23,629, NDX -2.9% at 6391; SECTORS: Utilities -1.2%, Telecoms -1.6%, Energy -2.5%, Healthcare -2.6%, Consumer non-cyclicals -2.6%, Financials -2.6%, Materials -2.7%, Industrials -2.7%, Tech -3.0%, Consumer Cyclicals -3.3%</strong><br />With Europe, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada on a market holiday, liquidity was thin, and price action was choppy, amid the risk-off tone begotten by a perceived escalation of Trade Wars by China overnight, where it announced it would apply tariffs of up to 25% on imports of US pork, wine, and nuts (many analysts have downplayed the impact, though the likes of Tyson Foods were hit on the news). Equity futures were traversing sideways pre-market in negative territory, but it was only just before the cash open when selling intensified as NY traders returned from the long-weekend. All sectors were red, but tech was a notable underperformer with Amazon pressuring equities after Trump&rsquo;s antagonistic tweeting, while consumer discretionary was also whacked. Technical selling pressure entered after the SPX fell below its 200dma around 2590, before stabilising around 2560 (the index closes beneath its 200dma ending a 448-day run). Tesla&rsquo;s woes helped dragged the Nasdaq lower, helping the Composite to join the SPX and DJIA in technical correction territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US 10-Year T-Note futures settle 4 ticks higher at 121-08+</strong><br />The TPLEX begins the new month/quarter bid, with the complex fulfilling its role as a safe-haven amid the stock slide. But it is worth keeping these moves in context; volume was naturally thinner in holiday trading conditions, and T-Note futures settle a mere four ticks higher (despite 10-year yields falling to 2.7170%, the lowest since early February. Major curve spreads saw only modest flattening (between 0.5bps to 2bps), and in the pre-market &ndash; before the stocks&rsquo; slide &ndash; the curve was bear-steepening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY -0.1% heading into APAC trade</strong><br />The&nbsp;DXY&nbsp;starts the Month/quarter slightly lower, mainly hit by&nbsp;USDJPY, which slid to 105.65 as risk sentiment was hit by China&rsquo;s trade war escalation; there was also modest buying after the March ISM non-manufacturing survey fell short of expectations. The yen largely ignored the latest Tankan survey, released overnight. The&nbsp;EUR&nbsp;traded a narrow range, finding its way back to the 1.23 handle as we head into Asia, having seen 1.2280 as stocks dropped near the open.&nbsp;GBP&nbsp;was up against the USD and EUR, gapping higher at Sunday&rsquo;s open after it was reported that the UK has a proposal to resolve the Irish border issue; the plan would see the UK act as an &#39;external frontier&#39; for the EU, collecting tariffs and carrying out other checks at the border, and will be discussed with EU officials later this month. CAD and MXN were initially resilient to Trump&rsquo;s NAFTA threats on Twitter, though both have succumbed to USD strength as commodity FX and EMs are generally weaker against the buck; the&nbsp;CAD&nbsp;has made its way back up to the top end of the recent 1.2850-1.2950 range.&nbsp;AUD, meanwhile, is consolidating around the 0.7650 level ahead of this week&rsquo;s RBA (expected unchanged).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures (June) settle USD 1.69 lower at USD 63.18 per barrel; Brent (June) settles $1.70 lower at $67.64/bbl</strong><br />WTI was horizontal above $65.00 as NY traders returned from the long-weekend; fears of escalating Trade Wars injected a risk-off tone to Monday trade, which saw equities &ndash; and subsequently crude &ndash; under pressure. The risk-off tone was helped by pre-market news that Russia reported that March output rose to 10.97mln BPD, up from February&rsquo;s 10.95mln, making Russia the largest crude producer, overtaking the US. The news didn&rsquo;t immediately move the crude complex, perhaps because European markets were shut due to Bank Holiday. Additionally, over the weekend, Bahrain announced it made the largest oil discovery in its history, which eclipses its current reserves (estimated to be up to 200mln bbls), adding to the global oversupply narrative. More details are expected this week. This week, analysts expect to see crude stocks build by 1.7mln barrels (which would be the second consecutive build), distillate stocks are seen drawing 500k bbls, and gasoline stocks are seen drawing 1.5mln bbls.</p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) was positive as the index shrugged off a disappointing BoJ Tankan where large manufacturers&rsquo; sentiment deteriorated for the first time in 2 years and large industry numbers mostly missed forecasts, as the data also showed a strong all industry capex component and increased confidence across smaller businesses. Elsewhere, KOSPI (+0.2%) was also higher amid the improved geopolitical climate in the Korean peninsula, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) was underpinned after better than expected Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI data over the weekend. Conversely, the Caixin Manufacturing PMI release was less inspiring and fell short of estimates while China also confirmed tariffs on US products in retaliation to US protectionist measures on steel and aluminium, which in turn capped advances in the mainland. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with price action range-bound amid gains in riskier assets as well as an unchanged BoJ Rinban announcement.</p>\r\n",
