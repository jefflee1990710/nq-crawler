(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EIA stated that US crude oil production rose by 260k BPD in February to 10.264mln BPD (Prev. 10.004mln BPD in January), while US total oil demand (Feb) rose 2.4% Y/Y or 460,00 BPD to 19.619mln BPD, (January saw a 6.3% rise).

However, as the cash day got underway, traders were reported to have become concerned about the USD strength (DXY is up over 2.5% from April lows, leading many analysts to change their tune on the buck) though yields on 10yr Treasuries didn&rsquo;t threaten the dreaded 3% level, which has been a trigger for equity weakness in recent sessions. Additionally, traders were said to be concerned on the geopolitical front, after Israel closed airspace in the Golan Heights ahead of an announcement on Iran (see Geopolitics section) which began to see a classic risk-off move (equities down, Treasuries up, oil up, gold up). SPX -0.82% at 2648, NDX -0.76% at 6606, DJI -0.61% at 24163.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yield curve flattened on Monday on a combination of month-end and softish data, causing the 10yr yield to retreat from last week&rsquo;s best levels, falling to sub-2.94%. While most of the action was concentrated in the long-end of the curve (30s yields down c.2bps at settlement), all the major yield spreads were narrowing; 5s30s flattened by c.1bps the lowest spread in more than six years. Ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding Announcement, the US Treasury borrowed USD 488bln in Q1, expectations are to issue USD 75bln in net marketable debt in Q2, down USD 101bln previous estimate, and USD 273bln in net marketable debt in Q3. Elsewhere, BTPs underperformed their peers on Monday after Italy&rsquo;s 5SM leader Di Maio called for a fresh elections in June. Following the election in March, talks between parties have largely failed and no successful attempts were made to form a government. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 4 ticks higher at 119-20.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: </strong>Equities down, Treasuries up, DXY up, Crude up.<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW: </strong>Israel says Iran lied about nuke activity; core PCE jumps; heavy M&amp;A activity.<strong> </strong><br /><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>US Treasury<strong> </strong>Secretary Mnuchin to speak 17.30EST/22.30BST, RBA overnight,<strong> </strong>Labour Day in Europe;<strong> </strong>Apple, BP, Pfizer and Merck among the big names reporting on Tues; API inventories, GDT auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Attention was on Iran again today, ahead of the 12 May decision that the US must make on whether to pull-out of the nuclear deal. Traders were on alert after Israel closed airspace over Golan Heights and announced PM Netanyahu would be making a key announcement later in the day, which lent strength to the crude complex. At the press conference, the Israeli PM accused Iran of lying over its nuclear intentions, and claimed that it had proof that Iran continued its nuclear programme after the nuclear deal was signed. Israel also told the US that it would be prepared to target Iran if it is attacked from Syria by Iranian proxies. Iran denied the allegations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS:</strong> There are two key US trade policy decisions due this week: 1) Whether to roll steel and aluminium tariff exemptions (1/May), and 2) NAFTA decision (possibly by 4/May). US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will visit Beijing for showdown trade talks on Thursday and Friday, and ahead of this week&rsquo;s deadlines, he said that Trump would not be commenting on EU tariff exemptions; on that subject, FT sources reported that the mood is said to be darkening on EU/US trade dispute following latest contacts with US administration. Talking NAFTA, Mexico&#39;s automakers association AMIA, commented on the new US auto proposal saying it is not a viable one given the situation of the industry the US. It included a 75% in regional autos content to be implemented in 4 years for light vehicles and 2 years for trucks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>DATA:</strong> Small misses on the headline for <strong>Personal Income and Spending</strong>, but analysts have been encouraged by the general trend in consumption growth. Capital Economics said the rise in real consumption in March confirms that all of the first-quarter weakness in household spending came at the very beginning of the year, and that consumption growth is already rebounding. The <strong>core PCE</strong> will have been of interest to the Fed, with the YY headline rising to 1.9%, which analysts believe will keep the FOMC on track to lift rates at least two more times in 2018. <strong>Pending home sales</strong> missed expectations, and are running below the pace implied by mortgage applications data, Pantheon Macroeconomics notes. It was a disappointing report, Pantheon said, consistent with a clear drop in April existing home sales. &ldquo;Relative cold and snowy weather in March might have depressed activity; we look for better numbers in April.&rdquo; Meanwhile, in Europe, <strong>German flash HICP</strong> in April was a touch weaker than expected with core components contributing to the downside, which analysts say supports the ECB&rsquo;s cautious policy approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.82% at 2648, NDX -0.76% at 6606, DJI -0.61% at 24163 SECTORS:</strong> Cons Cyclicals: -0.40%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.75%, Energy: +0.31%, Financials: -0.56%, Health Care: -1.18%, Industrials: -1.09%, Materials: -1.67%, Technology: -0.45%, Telecoms: -2.36%, Utilities: -0.34%. Ahead of the cash open, US equity futures were firmer, rising back into the black for the year, after consolidating under the neutral line for most of Friday trade. However, as the cash day got underway, traders were reported to have become concerned about the USD strength (DXY is up over 2.5% from April lows, leading many analysts to change their tune on the buck) though yields on 10yr Treasuries didn&rsquo;t threaten the dreaded 3% level, which has been a trigger for equity weakness in recent sessions. Additionally, traders were said to be concerned on the geopolitical front, after Israel closed airspace in the Golan Heights ahead of an announcement on Iran (see Geopolitics section) which began to see a classic risk-off move (equities down, Treasuries up, oil up, gold up).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* M&amp;A news dominated over earnings on Monday; Walmart (WMT) announced over the weekend it is to sell its UK ASDA unit to Sainsbury&rsquo;s (SBRY LN) for $10bln (&pound;7.3bln) which will make the merged entity, if approved, larger than the UK&rsquo;s current market leader, Tesco (TSCO LN). Also, T-Mobile (TMUS) &amp; Sprint (S) confirmed they are to merge in a $26bln deal, however analysts are noting it is likely to face challenges from the US DoJ. However, Fox&rsquo;s Gasparino tweeted source reports that DoJ officials told Fox that the antitrust division found the deal less problematic than AT&amp;T&rsquo;s (T) and Time Warner&rsquo;s (TWX) deal. Elsewhere, Prologis (PLD) announced it is to acquire DCT Industrial Trust (DCT) for $8.4bln deal and finally, Marriot Vacations (VAC) announced it would purchase ILG (ILG) in a deal worth $4.7bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The largest earnings report today came from McDonald&rsquo;s (MCD) who beat on both the top and bottom lines, while its global same store sales rose 5.5%, above analyst expectations of 3.7%, and US same store sales were in line at 2.9%. Tomorrow&rsquo;s highly anticipated earnings slate includes Apple (AAPL), Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK). Over the weekend, press reports suggested that Apple (AAPL) is looking to increase shareholder wealth by roughly $100bln as it prepare to redistribute its repatriated overseas profits, with some expecting apple to announce a record breaking expansion to its capital return scheme alongside its earnings report (currently the tech behemoth is on track to total buybacks and dividends around $300bln by March in 2019, but the likes of&nbsp; Morgan Stanley believes that Apple could announce a further $150bln to that sum tomorrow, while Citi expects another $100bln increase, RBC sees $80bln-$90bln over four-five years); expectations: EPS $2.69, revenues $61.2bln, iPhones sales 53mln, iPads 9mln and Macs 4mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong><strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 4 ticks higher at 119-20. </strong>The yield curve flattened on Monday on a combination of month-end and softish data, causing the 10yr yield to retreat from last week&rsquo;s best levels, falling to sub-2.94%. While most of the action was concentrated in the long-end of the curve (30s yields down c.2bps at settlement), all the major yield spreads were narrowing; 5s30s flattened by c.1bps the lowest spread in more than six years. Ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding Announcement, the US Treasury borrowed USD 488bln in Q1, expectations are to issue USD 75bln in net marketable debt in Q2, down USD 101bln previous estimate, and USD 273bln in net marketable debt in Q3. Elsewhere, BTPs underperformed their peers on Monday after Italy&rsquo;s 5SM leader Di Maio called for a fresh elections in June. Following the election in March, talks between parties have largely failed and no successful attempts were made to form a government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI futures settle 47 cents higher at $68.57/bbl; Brent settles 53 cents higher at $75.17. </strong>Oil traded near fresh YTD highs after Israeli PM Netanyahu presented evidence that purportedly shows Iran has been lying about its nuclear intentions, and has been hiding nuclear weapons activity. President Trump continued to be coy, and said &lsquo;we will see what happens&rsquo; when asked about pulling out of the Iran deal, adding that pulling out of the Iran deal would provide a positive message to North Korea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s API energy report, analysts forecast crude stocks will build by 1.3mln, Cushing (via Genscape)is forecast to build by 1mln, distillates are seen drawing 1.3mln, and gasoline is seen drawing by 0.4mln. A Reuters poll sees analysts raising their crude oil forecasts, and now see crude averaging $63.23/bbl in 2018, and $62.16 in 2019 (vs $59.85 and $58.65 in last month&rsquo;s poll). Finally, Reuters latest OPEC survey expects OPEC April oil output seen declining 70k BPD to 32.12mln BPD, lowest since April 2017 led by Venezuela, Nigeria and Angola; Compliance with output cut deal expected to rise to 162% (from 161%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Es Sider port loadings are reported to be 310k in May, highest since the 2016 restart of the Es Sider pipeline; Libya on Sunday also said that the El Sharara field is pumping more than 300k BPD; UAE&rsquo;s ADNOC has informed clients that the June allocations will be cut by 5% for all crude grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> <strong>DXY</strong> The USD and index are heading into the final few hours of April on a firmer footing and could conceivably retest recent peaks just under 92.000 with more in line or above forecast data. In truth, the Greenback has gleaned a lot of upward momentum from the demise of its currency rivals, but rising US Treasury yields have been a related factor alongside solid economic indicators. Technically, the DXY really needs to clear 91.900 and out of a rising channel to take on any psychological resistance around the next big figure and advance further towards the nearest bullish chart target beyond that circa 92.329.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD and NZD</strong> Both edging ominously close to round number supports that could easily trigger more heavy losses if breached at 0.7500 and 0.7000 respectively as the aforementioned climb in US cash rates eats into any residual yield advantage the antipodeans have. The AUD has just been outperforming or rather holding up better than the Kiwi during the latter part of the month on cross flows as 1.0700 is reclaimed vs a few pips below 1.0500 in mid-April. Looking ahead, the RBA meeting looms overnight, but is not expected to provide the AUD with much support, while NZ jobs data is due on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR/CHF/JPY</strong> Still broadly keeping pace with each other and between 0.25-0.35% adrift the Dollar, but with the single currency back below 1.2100 after a soft German HICP print (y/y) and eyeing key Fib support around 1.2055 again, ahead of early 2018 lows at 1.2030. USDCHF has now climbed above 0.9900, while USDJPY remains contained within a 109.00-50 range amidst rising mid-East jitters ahead of a speech by Israeli PM Netanyahu on Iran (18.00BST/20.00PM local), but not threatening decent option expiry interest at the low end (1.4 bn) at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>GBP</strong> Cable has bounced off major technical support near early March lows (circa 1.3712-15) to 1.3750 or thereabouts, while EURGBP is back below 0.8800 vs peaks earlier around 0.8825, but Sterling is still at risk of ending April with net losses having rallied vs the USD for 13 consecutive years during this month. A drastic reduction in May BoE tightening expectations on sub forecast and/or downright weak data has done the damage, along with more political fall-out and doubts about a Brexit transition deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>USDCAD</strong> steadier around 1.2850 with the Loonie gleaning support from a sharp rebound in crude prices on the aforementioned geopolitical/mid-east uncertainty, and hopes of an early May NAFTA deal. On the domestic front, GDP data and BoC&rsquo;s Poloz due tomorrow, and after firm PPI/raw material prices</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: RBA MEETING:</strong> Expectations are one-sided for the central bank to keep the Cash Rate Target unchanged at the record low 1.50% for a 19th consecutive month. Recent commentary from the central bank have all been reiterations as RBA Governor Lowe repeated that it is more likely the next move in the cash rate will be up rather than down. Data suggests that the RBA is unlikely to begin rate normalization soon as latest inflation figures showed softer than expected headline CPI for Q1. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19073/download\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\">Click here to read full report.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

In truth, the Greenback has gleaned a lot of upward momentum from the demise of its currency rivals, but rising US Treasury yields have been a related factor alongside solid economic indicators. Technically, the DXY really needs to clear 91.900 and out of a rising channel to take on any psychological resistance around the next big figure and advance further towards the nearest bullish chart target beyond that circa 92.329.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both edging ominously close to round number supports that could easily trigger more heavy losses if breached at 0.7500 and 0.7000 respectively as the aforementioned climb in US cash rates eats into any residual yield advantage the antipodeans have. The Aud has just been outperforming or rather holding up better than the Kiwi during the latter part of the month on cross flows as 1.0700 is reclaimed vs a few pips below 1.0500 in mid-April. Looking ahead, the RBA meeting looms overnight, but is not expected to provide the Aud with much support, while NZ jobs data is due on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/CHF/JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still broadly keeping pace with each other and between 0.25-0.35% adrift the Dollar, but with the single currency back below 1.2100 after a soft German HICP print (y/y) and eyeing key Fib support around 1.2055 again, ahead of early 2018 lows at 1.2030. Usd/Chf has now climbed above 0.9900, while Usd/Jpy remains contained within a 109.00-50 range amidst rising mid-East jitters ahead of a speech by Israeli PM Netanyahu on Iran (18.00BST/20.00PM local), but not threatening decent option expiry interest at the low end (1.4 bn) at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable has bounced off major technical support near early March lows (circa 1.3712-15) to 1.3750 or thereabouts, while Eur/Gbp is back below 0.8800 vs peaks earlier around 0.8825, but Sterling is still at risk of ending April with net losses having rallied vs the Usd for 13 consecutive years during this month. A drastic reduction in May BoE tightening expectations on sub forecast and/or downright weak data has done the damage, along with more political fall-out and doubts about a Brexit transition deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Cad steadier around 1.2850 with the Loonie gleaning support from a sharp rebound in cride prices on the aforementioned geopolitical/mid-east uncertainty, and hopes of an early May NAFTA deal. On the domestic front, GDP data and BoC&rsquo;s Poloz due tomorrow, and after firm PPI/raw material prices today.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and KOSPI (+0.7%) were higher although weakness across Australia&rsquo;s commodity sectors restricted upside, while South Korea continued to benefit from improving ties following Friday&rsquo;s summit and after North Korea vowed to close its nuclear test site. Hang Seng (+1.7%) was the outperformer of the region with the index propped up by China&rsquo;s largest banks following improved earnings reports and with sentiment also underpinned by better than expected Chinese Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI data. As a reminder, both Japan and mainland China were closed for holidays with Japan to only open Tuesday and Wednesday amid Golden Week, while China is shut today and tomorrow due to Labour Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Manufacturing PMI (Apr) 51.4 vs. Exp. 51.3 (Prev. 51.5).

Reports stated that Beijing is likely to offer to import more goods from US to reduce and offer to negotiate a free trade agreement as well as other measures. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May accepted the resignation of Home Secretary Amber Rudd amid claims that Rudd misled parliament regarding targets for increasing immigrant deportations, which she had denied at a House of Commons committee. Sajid Javid appointed as new Home Secretary. (Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&rsquo;s 5 Star movement leaders are against forming a government with the Democratic party. With further news from Italy&rsquo;s centre-right saying they may seek minority government mandate. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regional German CPIs have painted a broadly similar picture to expectations for the mainland readings (1300BST) with a decline in the M/M and Y/Y relatively unchanged from the previous. Increases in energy and food prices were offset by a fall in the core rate. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU bourses opened mixed, but since then traded in positive territory (Eurostoxx 50 +0.2%) with modest gains as the region follows suit from Asia overnight. Looking at the sectors, Telecoms are outperforming following the merger of Deutsche Telekom&rsquo;s (+1.3%) T-Mobile and Softbank&rsquo;s Sprint; Vodafone (+1.6%) and Orange (+0.4%) higher in sympathy. Energy is the worst performing sector with names subdued amid declining oil prices, BP (-0.8%), Shell (-0.7%) and Total (-0.8%) shares are lower as a result. In terms of stock specifics; Sainsbury&rsquo;s (+15.0%) shares soared on a merger with Walmart&rsquo;s ASDA touted at around GBP 12bln. Shares in competitors are lower on this news, with Tesco (-1.2%) at the foot of the FTSE 100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar is firmer vs all G10 peers approaching the end of April and a positive 1st month of Q2, with the index forming a solid base above 91.500. Rebalancing models are somewhat mixed, but indicating moderate Usd demand overall, while some are also positioning for a potential positive inflation assessment from this week&rsquo;s FOMC and already looking ahead to Friday&rsquo;s NFP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weakest G10 links and still looking prone to further downside if 0.7550 and 0.7050 fail to hold amidst declines in commodity prices and holiday-thinned trade with China and Japan closed. Little support gleaned from better than expected Chinese PMIs, as the cross pivots 1.0700 ahead of the RBA meeting overnight that is not seen deviating from the neutral stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling remains under pressure and on course to end a 13 year sequence of gains vs the Usd in the month of April after a dramatic change in fortunes in the last 2 weeks. A run of disappointing data has seen May BoE hike prospects plunge from 90%+ to around 20% or just under, and PMIs in the next 3 days could wipe out tightening expectations altogether if weak. Adding further to the Pound&rsquo;s woes, another top Government resignation, ongoing doubts about a Brexit deal and a marked reduction in CFTC long positions alongside RHS interest in Eur/Gbp for month end (cross above 0.8800 as a result).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/EUR/CHF/CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All around 0.2% down vs the Greenback with Usd/Jpy bouncing off 109.00, but still capped around 109.50, Eur/Usd holding recovery gains above 1.1200 (just) and briefly threatening stops above 1.2140 on a combination of firm German state CPI data and the aforementioned Eur/Gbp demand for month end. Usd/Chf is hovering a few pips below 0.9900 and Usd/Cad is straddling 1.2850 with a retreat in oil prices offsetting latest positive NAFTA noises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts survived an early bout of selling pressure that pushed the 10-year benchmark briefly into negative territory from a 121.99 initial print to 121.85 vs the 121.99 previous close, and have subsequently bounced to 122.31 (+38 point). Similarly, the Short Sterling strip is outperforming Eurodollar and Euribor counterparts as domestic markets continue to focus on the UK fundamentals that suggest a further delay to the next BoE rate hike. A run of bleak data started the ball rolling, then Governor Carney himself played down expectations and yet another high profile Cabinet Minister resignation comes amidst ongoing doubt about a Brexit transition deal, largely on the contentious Irish border issue, but by no means that alone. Back to near term policy, MPC&rsquo;s Haldane is due to speak at 10.00BST and could share more light, but officially the panel should be on lock-down ahead of &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil falling approaching month end, amidst multiple bearish factors. Firstly, month end rebalancing, in thinner trading conditions due to Chinese and Japanese market holidays, a rise in US rig counts pointing to increased production and a firmer USD placing downward pressure ahead of key US data points such as the core PCE price index ahead of the upcoming Fed meeting. The data in particular focus as some analysts are suggesting that should the YY rate post 2.0% (vs. prev. 1.9%) we will be at the Fed&rsquo;s stated inflation target, signalling a higher possibility for hawkish tones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, technical impulses weighing, with USD 67.80 and USD 67.56 support levels tripped in WTI. Note June Brent futures expire later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals complex, gold sliding as the risk sentiment continues to improve following reduced Korean tensions, and thereby reducing safe haven demand flows. However, Copper bid following a strong Chinese PMI&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>USD short squeeze chasing: </strong>There is further room for a squeeze of positioning in the short term so any strength in this week&rsquo;s data flow could spur another leg higher in USD, Citi says. Short-term investors were caught flat-footed by recent outperformance from US data flow and the perceived improvement in the geopolitical backdrop, which has seen investors begin to re-price the political risk premium on USD, the bank believes, and suspects that there is scope for more of a flush-out, particularly amid relatively light liquidity over the course of this week&rsquo;s Asian holidays.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>This means that USD responsiveness to US data flow may be elevated. </strong>Citi doubts that the FOMC meeting will prove a major turning point, but even modest strength from payrolls, ISM and other indicators is likely to support the narrative that the US is pulling away from other countries, the bank writes. By contrast, it will likely take more than isolated data strength abroad to fully reverse expectations that other major economies have slowed somewhat, skewing risk-return to a higher USD.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>USDSEK is a high octane USD long: </strong>USDSEK is one of the best carry pairs in G10 and has underperformed rate spreads despite diverging CB hawkishness, Citi points out. Riksbank&#39;s Ingves was fundamentally dovish (still worried about Krona strength) as was the decision to push back the 1st hike by 1Q in the rate path, whereas the Fed is continuing their normalization path.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>USDSEK has underperformed G10 v SEK: </strong>EURSEK is the wrong benchmark for SEK weakness, according to Citi: G10 v SEK isn&rsquo;t even at recent highs suggesting SEK has room to weaken further on crosses. USDSEK has underperformed both G10 v SEK and EURSEK quite considerably.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

In terms of stock specifics; Sainsbury&rsquo;s (+15.0%) shares soared on a merger with Walmart&rsquo;s ASDA touted at around GBP 12bln.

The data in particular focus as some analysts are suggesting that should the YY rate post 2.0% (vs. prev. 1.9%) we will be at the Fed&rsquo;s stated inflation target, signalling a higher possibility for hawkish tones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, technical impulses weighing, with USD 67.80 and USD 67.56 support levels tripped in WTI.
