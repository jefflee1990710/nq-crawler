With that said, most were of the opinion that recent data points to a modestly stronger economic outlook than was forecast in December, and voting members generally judged risks as roughly balanced; in fact, several saw the potential for increased upside risks to the near-term economic outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The market was pricing a March hike with near-certainty (93.5% implied probability); implied probability of three FOMC hikes in 2018 is up to 66.6% vs 60.6% on Tuesday, while the probability of four hikes rose to 29.6% vs 25% on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTE: These meeting minutes are from the FOMC meeting in January that preceded the stronger NFP wage data, firm inflation data, and the volatility in financial markets</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;N/A</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREASURIES: US T-Note Futures settle 9 ticks lower at 120-06+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury auctioned $35bln in new 5-year notes, which came in on the screws, with the yield highest since December 2009, while cover was slightly below recent averages. Analysts have pointed out that there were similarities to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 2s (which stopped-through by 0.1bps), in that dealer participation was higher than recent averages, while indirect participation was lower. The sale came ahead of the FOMC&rsquo;s January meeting minutes, and as such, there was limited price action in wake of the auction (again, similar to yesterday&rsquo;s auction).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The immediate reaction to the FOMC&rsquo;s meeting minutes was dovish, albeit very muted. However, as the details were digested, the tplex saw selling pressure, with T-Note futures finding fresh session lows and yields for 10s and 30s rising to YTD highs. At settlement, the curve had bear steepened, and major curve spreads had widened (5s30s was particularly noticeable rising c.3bps).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The market is pricing a March hike with near-certainty (93.5% implied probability); implied probability of three FOMC hikes in 2018 is up to 66.6% vs 60.6% on Tuesday, while the probability of four hikes rose to 29.6% vs 25% on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>UK/EUROPE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />BoE&#39;s Carney says that data is consistent with rising wage pressure.<br />BoE&rsquo;s Haldane says average weekly earnings growth will soon reach 3%<br />BoE&#39;s Tenreyro says UK inflation forecasts are &#39;well anchored&#39;<br />BoE&#39;s Broadbent states that In the MPC&rsquo;s central forecast, inflation settles marginally above the 2% target and it&rsquo;s against this backdrop that I felt it right to vote for a quarter-point rise in Bank Rate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Claimant Count Unem Chng (Jan) -7.2k vs. Exp. 2.3k (Prev. 8.6k, Rev. 6.2k)<br />Avg Wk Earnings 3M YY (Dec) 2.5% vs. Exp. 2.5% (Prev. 2.5%, Rev. 2.3%)<br />Avg Earnings (Ex-Bonus) (Dec) 2.5% vs. Exp. 2.4% (Prev. 2.4%, Rev. 2.3%)<br />ILO Unemployment Rate (Dec) 4.4% vs. Exp. 4.3% (Prev. 4.3%)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK government spokesperson says UK wants a 2 year transition phase whereas the EU would like 21 months.

The price action was choppy &ndash; in fact, in the first instance, the market seems to have traded on the slight concern some members had regarding inflation lagging target; but after the details were digested, the USD was bought, and Treasuries were sold. The net impact was the EUR falling beneath the 1.23 handle, JPY flirting with 108.00 (though didn&rsquo;t meaningfully test the level in US trade). Sterling weakened against the USD (Fed inspired, falling to low 1.39 versus highs above 1.40) and the EUR (though the 0.88 level held firm) after BOE officials &ndash; including Governor Carney testified before the Treasury Select Committee, though revealed little by way of new information. The commodity dollars were weaker as the greenback surged, oil traded mixed, and gold dropped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"_Hlk504673747\">COMMODITIES</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 11 cents lower at $61.68 per barrel; Brent futures settle 17 cents higher at USD 65.42 per barrel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of weekly energy inventory data from the API aftermarket on Wednesday, and Thursday&rsquo;s official DOE data, crude traded mixed, with the positive narrative from OPEC officials not completely offsetting concerns about increasing US supply.

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: FOMC minutes weigh on stocks, boost dollar ",
        "content": "<p><strong>FOMC MEETING MINUTES: Confident on inflation and the growth outlook </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FOMC&rsquo;s meeting minutes noted that the recent strengthening of US economy has increased the likelihood of further gradual rate hikes, with most voters saying that recent data supported view that inflation will rise in 2018, and stabilise around the 2% target in the medium-term; a couple, however, &nbsp;were concerned about the inflation outlook, and saw an appreciable risk that inflation will lag target (which many traders were attributing to the immediate dovish market response). With that said, most were of the opinion that recent data points to a modestly stronger economic outlook than was forecast in December, and voting members generally judged risks as roughly balanced; in fact, several saw the potential for increased upside risks to the near-term economic outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The market was pricing a March hike with near-certainty (93.5% implied probability); implied probability of three FOMC hikes in 2018 is up to 66.6% vs 60.6% on Tuesday, while the probability of four hikes rose to 29.6% vs 25% on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOTE: These meeting minutes are from the FOMC meeting in January that preceded the stronger NFP wage data, firm inflation data, and the volatility in financial markets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX -0.53% at 2702, Nasdaq100 -0.3% at 6759 and DJ -0.67% at 24798</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top sectors: Industrials -0.01%, Financials -0.05% and IT -0.60</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom sectors: Energy -1.66%, Utilities -1.32% and Consumer staples -1.23%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In wake of the FOMC&rsquo;s meeting minutes, major US stock indices gave up gains for the session, with ES H18 settling back within the 2720-2725 region that has acted as key support/resistance as of late. Price action was choppy in wake of the minutes, however, Financials fared slightly better, however, likely following the Treasury curve bear-steepening, which also saw major curve spreads widen on the day. Energy was the laggard, with crude trading mixed, and ahead of inventory data after the bell, which is expected to show crude stocks building for the fourth straight week. In stock specific stories, the focus was once again on Qualcomm and Broadcom, with the former falling after the latter revised lower its offer to acquire the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Note Futures settle 9 ticks lower at 120-06+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury auctioned $35bln in new 5-year notes, which came in on the screws, with the yield highest since December 2009, while cover was slightly below recent averages. Analysts have pointed out that there were similarities to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 2s (which stopped-through by 0.1bps), in that dealer participation was higher than recent averages, while indirect participation was lower. The sale came ahead of the FOMC&rsquo;s January meeting minutes, and as such, there was limited price action in wake of the auction (again, similar to yesterday&rsquo;s auction).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The immediate reaction to the FOMC&rsquo;s meeting minutes was dovish, albeit very muted. However, as the details were digested, the tplex saw selling pressure, with T-Note futures finding fresh session lows and yields for 10s and 30s rising to YTD highs. At settlement, the curve had bear steepened, and major curve spreads had widened (5s30s was particularly noticeable rising c.3bps).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The market is pricing a March hike with near-certainty (93.5% implied probability); implied probability of three FOMC hikes in 2018 is up to 66.6% vs 60.6% on Tuesday, while the probability of four hikes rose to 29.6% vs 25% on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY +0.4% heading into APAC after FOMC mins</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In wake of the Fed&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes, the dollar ultimately prevailed, and the DXY rose above 90.00. The price action was choppy &ndash; in fact, in the first instance, the market seems to have traded on the slight concern some members had regarding inflation lagging target; but after the details were digested, the USD was bought, and Treasuries were sold. The net impact was the EUR falling beneath the 1.23 handle, JPY flirting with 108.00 (though didn&rsquo;t meaningfully test the level in US trade). Sterling weakened against the USD (Fed inspired, falling to low 1.39 versus highs above 1.40) and the EUR (though the 0.88 level held firm) after BOE officials &ndash; including Governor Carney testified before the Treasury Select Committee, though revealed little by way of new information. The commodity dollars were weaker as the greenback surged, oil traded mixed, and gold dropped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 11 cents lower at $61.68 per barrel; Brent futures settle 17 cents higher at USD 65.42 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of weekly energy inventory data from the API aftermarket on Wednesday, and Thursday&rsquo;s official DOE data, crude traded mixed, with the positive narrative from OPEC officials not completely offsetting concerns about increasing US supply. This week, analysts expect crude stocks to build by 1.8mln barrels (which would be the fourth straight week of builds), distillates are seen drawing by 1.5mln, Gasoline is seen drawing by 0.3mln. There was little else by way of crude news on Wednesday, with traders continuing to cite yesterday&rsquo;s comments from the UAE energy minister (optimistic about future OPEC+ cooperation). Elsewhere, shipments from the Novorossiisk port in Russia were delayed due to managerial conflicts, PVM reported, while Brazil&rsquo;s Petrobras reported crude production was 1% down on the month to 2.7mln BPD.</p>\r\n",

        "reaction_details": "<p>A fairly muted reaction, though some suggesting that the headline that &quot;some saw appreciable risks that inflation would lag target&quot; has resulted in some USD selling (within range for the major pairs, though CAD and NZD are near session highs versus the dollar), equities rising to session highs, and Tsys rising (but remain within range, after having a look at session lows first). Another line of thought is that the minutes may not have been as hawkish as some market participants had expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOTE: These meeting minutes are from the FOMC meeting in January that preceded the stronger NFP wage data, firm inflation data, and the volatility in financial markets&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: FOMC Minutes from the January 2018 meeting at 1900GMT/1400EST",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Minutes likely to cement expectations of a rate hike in March</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Comments on inflation outlook to be in focus</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Potential discussion on reconsidering the Fed&rsquo;s policy framework</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last FOMC meeting under Yellen&rsquo;s tutelage saw the FOMC keep interest rates unchanged at 1.25%-1.50% and pave the way for further gradual rate hikes going forward. The statement was more hawkish than some had anticipated as the Fed altered their language around inflation, removing the phrase that inflation was &ldquo;to remain somewhat below 2% in the near term.&rdquo; The other important change was the addition of the word &ldquo;further&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;further gradual increases&rdquo; will be necessary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Given that the January FOMC statement upgraded the inflation language and the characterisation of economic activity, we would not be surprised to see the January Minutes also having a hawkish tone,&rdquo; writes Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale. &ldquo;Given that market participants are worried about the fact that the Fed may end up hiking four times in 2018 versus the median projection of three hikes, a hawkish tone in the January Minutes would be unsettling.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comments on inflation will likely take much of the focus given the language change in the statement as market watchers try to gauge how the much confidence they have in the inflation outlook. The January meeting pre-dates the latest CPI data from the US which saw the Y/Y rate hold at 2.1% despite expectations of a dip to 1.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is clear that underlying inflation is accelerating,&rdquo; said Capital Economics. &ldquo;There are good reasons to expect this pick up in core inflation to run further in 2018.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets are currently pricing in a near 100% chance of a rate hike at the March meeting and the Minutes will likely reinforce expectations of a 25bps hike if they appear positive on the inflation outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>OTHER TOPICS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capital Economics question whether there will be any discussion by the Committee on potentially reconsidering the Fed&rsquo;s policy framework. Currently the Fed&rsquo;s mandate is achieve 2% inflation and full employment in a balanced manner but recently some Committee members have voiced concern over that approach. Boston Fed&rsquo;s Rosengren has suggested replacing the 2% target with a target range of between 1.5% and 3.0% while others have suggested targeting an average of 2% or even raising the target to 4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another point to be aware of is the publication of new Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s first monetary policy report on Friday (Powell does not testify to Congress until 28th February). Powell&rsquo;s Fed is widely expected to follow the same path that Yellen&rsquo;s Fed had undertaken &ndash; gradually normalising rates &ndash; but this will be one of the first opportunities for Powell to stamp his mark on the Committee. Since the last meeting, US wage and inflation data has been stronger than expected, prompting some volatility in markets but it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Fed will have another set of labour market data before the next meeting in March, which should show whether the higher than expected earnings in January were an anomaly or the beginning of an upward trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent market &ldquo;turmoil&rdquo; came after the Fed&rsquo;s January meeting and so there should be no comments on the volatility that was seen in the first weeks of February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MARKET REACTION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets are currently pricing in approximately 65% chance of three hikes in 2018 and 22% chance of four hikes this year. If the FOMC Minutes reaffirm the latest statement and show they are confident in the inflation outlook, markets may begin to fully price in four hikes in 2018 and US yields could continue the meteoric rise seen recently. However, the correlation between rates and the USD has broken recently and higher yields may not necessarily translate into a stronger USD. ING note that as long as the rise in yields is orderly, this is likely to translate into ongoing broad-based USD weakness, while EM FX should retain support.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Bullish comments from the BoE on UK wages (AWE to hit 3% &lsquo;soon&rsquo; after earlier data showed a steady 2.5% rate) helped Cable bounce firmly from the low 1.3900 area up towards 1.4000 again, and together with ongoing Jpy resilience (hugging 107.50 vs the Usd) undermined the broader Dollar recovery. Eur/Usd held above 1.2300 or thereabouts after several severe tests following weaker than forecast EZ flash PMIs, while Usd/Cad was capped just ahead of the 2018 peak (1.2690). However, the Aud remained the G10 laggard after mixed Aussie wage data overnight and on a key technical break of Fib support in the Nzd cross. Aud/Usd tested some downside chart levels around 0.7840-45, while Aud/Nzd retreated below 1.0700 and almost to 1.0675. In short, the DXY got to within a whisker of 90.000 at one stage, but pulled back and lost more impetus on the back of an existing home sales miss (that outweighed flash PMI beats), and will now take its cues from the tome of the FOMC minutes.</p>\r\n",

If Bunds clearly and convincingly breach resistance around the current Eurex session peak, contacts are flagging an approach towards the 159.30-33 area before 159.64 and then 159.74 as daily charts look bullish on a close above 158.89 per a declining trendline from December 2017 highs. Conversely, short term or interim support is seen around 158.66 and a deeper pull-back would see 158.55 come into play ahead of 158.38-41 where a minor chart gap was closed almost on the open. Beyond the intraday base, stops are anticipated on a breach of 158.36 and longs may reverse positions to test 158.27, 158.12 and Tuesday&rsquo;s 157.90 low. Turning to Gilts, 122.24 represents strong resistance above the 121.82 Liffe best (and 122.00 of course), while nearest support is 120.81 ahead of a stronger level at 120.13.</p>\r\n",

Although, as the session progressed a combination of the fall in US equity futures and 1% declines in crude prices, the Nikkei had briefly dipped into negative territory. Elsewhere, the <strong>ASX 200 (+0.1%)</strong> had opened lower in response to the falls on Wall Street but has recovered into positive territory. Mining names the largest drag on the index with BHP and Fortescue both losing ground following soft earnings. <strong>Hang Seng (+1.8%)</strong> traded higher amid HSBC shares recovering from yesterday&rsquo;s declines. In credit markets, the US Treasury curve is modestly flatter in the Asia-Pacific session, with the 10-Year yield last 0.4bp higher at 2.89%.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities (Eurostoxx 50 -0.7%) trade lower across the board amid lacklustre Eurozone PMIs and a dip in US equity futures overnight. In terms of sector specifics, telecoms outperform their peers amid strong earnings from Orange (+2%), to the downside, energy names lag their peers amid price action seen across the commodities complex. Other individual movers include Glencore (+4.1%), Lloyds (+1.6%) and who sit near the top of the FTSE 100 following their respective earnings. Elsewhere, other notable movers include Accor (+2.4%), Atos (-3.7%) and Iberdrola (-3.4%) post-earnings, whilst AA (-22.1%) lag the Stoxx 600 after a disappointing strategy update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian contacts are said to have attributed the latest Dollar leg-up to a further &lsquo;technical correction&rsquo;, and for the DXY 90.000 will be next on the radar given its psychological significance, but chart-wise nearest resistance resides between 90.500-600 as the index trades within a 89.935-700 range. Looking at basket components, Usd/Jpy has built on gains above the 2017 low (107.32), but stalled just before 108.00 amidst another bout of global stock market weakness. However, Jpy puts at the big figure have reportedly been in demand as the headline pair hovers around 107.50, with bids seen at 107.20. Eur/Usd is testing key Fib support at 1.2319 and buying interest into 1.2300 in wake of French, German and pan-EZ flash PMIs that missed consensus across the board. A downside break of 1.2300 exposes recent lows circa 1.2275 and stops below, but on the upside 1 bn option expiries run-off today between 1.2300-20. GBP initially faced selling pressure in the wake of the latest UK jobs figures despite the firmer than expected earnings ex-bonus release (prev. revised lower), with the report met by an unexpected uptick in the UK unemployment rate, slowdown in employment growth and the earnings release perhaps not enough to change the narrative at the BoE and nail on a May hike. However losses were then pared as it appears that the UK are now in a broad agreement with the EU on a transition period. Aud/Usd another notable mover, and retreating some distance from 0.7900 towards 0.7842 interim support despite former than forecast Aussie wages overnight as the breakdown was not as encouraging as the headline numbers appeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts are probing fresh Liffe intraday peaks of 121.82 (+41 ticks on the day) in wake of the UK data that was rather mixed overall given somewhat bigger than expected public sector finance borrowing requirements, but more pockets of strength in the jobs market. However, the headline domestic event is probably still to come in the shape of the BoE&rsquo;s TSC testimony on February&rsquo;s QIR (from 14.15GMT). Bunds have also extended earlier gains and briefly/marginally breached strong chart support on the way to a new 158.85 Eurex high (+46 ticks) after a run of sub-consensus flash Eurozone PMIs, but have slipped back since amidst profit taking according to market contacts. Core or safe-haven bonds are also gleaning a degree of underlying support from the latest equity market wobbles, but have more heavy supply to digest and of course FOMC minutes that may be more hawkish leaning than the policy meeting statement was perceived. US Treasuries are narrowly mixed and still flatter for choice ahead of the aforementioned Fed risk and latest auctions that could cause more indigestion (total of Usd50 bn 2 year FRN and 5 year T-notes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures are seen lower alongside the firmer USD after taking a tumble during Asia-Pac trade. In terms of energy specific newsflow, things remain light ahead of tonight&rsquo;s rescheduled API release with traders wary over any further climbs in US production. In metals markets, spot gold has recovered from modest overnight losses to trade relatively unchanged as markets await today&rsquo;s FOMC minutes release. Elsewhere, price action across the rest of the complex remains light as Chinese participants away are still away from market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>European equities (Eurostoxx 50 -0.5%) trade lower across the board amid lacklustre Eurozone PMIs and a dip in US equity futures overnight. In terms of sector specifics, telecoms are the only sector in the green amid strong earnings from Orange (+2.2%) and Telefonica Deutschland (+1.6%), to the downside, energy names lag their peers amid price action seen across the commodities complex. Other individual movers include Glencore (+2.9%), Lloyds (+1.9%) and Barratt Developments (+0.9%) who sit near the top of the FTSE 100 following their respective earnings. Elsewhere, other notable movers include Accor (+1.2%), Atos (+3.7%) and Iberdrola (-2.7%) post-earnings, whilst AA (-23.3%) lag the Stoxx 600 after a disappointing strategy update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian contacts are said to have attributed the latest Dollar leg-up to a further &lsquo;technical correction&rsquo;, and for the DXY 90.000 will be next on the radar given its psychological significance, but chart-wise nearest resistance resides between 90.500-600 as the index trades within a 89.935-700 range. Looking at basket components, Usd/Jpy has built on gains above the 2017 low (107.32), but stalled just before 108.00 amidst another bout of global stock market weakness. However, Jpy puts at the big figure have reportedly been in demand as the headline pair hovers around 107.50, with bids seen at 107.20. Eur/Usd is testing key Fib support at 1.2319 and buying interest into 1.2300 in wake of French, German and pan-EZ flash PMIs that missed consensus across the board. A downside break of 1.2300 exposes recent lows circa 1.2275 and stops below, but on the upside 1 bn option expiries run-off today between 1.2300-20. GBP initially faced selling pressure in the wake of the latest UK jobs figures despite the firmer than expected earnings ex-bonus release (prev. revised lower), with the report met by an unexpected uptick in the UK unemployment rate, slowdown in employment growth and the earnings release perhaps not enough to change the narrative at the BoE and nail on a May hike. However losses were then pared as it appears that the UK are now in a broad agreement with the EU on a transition period. Aud/Usd another notable mover, and retreating some distance from 0.7900 towards 0.7842 interim support despite former than forecast Aussie wages overnight as the breakdown was not as encouraging as the headline numbers appeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts are probing fresh Liffe intraday peaks of 121.82 (+41 ticks on the day) in wake of the UK data that was rather mixed overall given somewhat bigger than expected public sector finance borrowing requirements, but more pockets of strength in the jobs market. However, the headline domestic event is probably still to come in the shape of the BoE&rsquo;s TSC testimony on February&rsquo;s QIR (from 14.15GMT). Bunds have also extended earlier gains and briefly/marginally breached strong chart support on the way to a new 158.85 Eurex high (+46 ticks) after a run of sub-consensus flash Eurozone PMIs, but have slipped back since amidst profit taking according to market contacts. Core or safe-haven bonds are also gleaning a degree of underlying support from the latest equity market wobbles, but have more heavy supply to digest and of course FOMC minutes that may be more hawkish leaning than the policy meeting statement was perceived. US Treasuries are narrowly mixed and still flatter for choice ahead of the aforementioned Fed risk and latest auctions that could cause more indigestion (total of Usd50 bn 2 year FRN and 5 year T-notes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures are seen lower alongside the firmer USD after taking a tumble during Asia-Pac trade. In terms of energy specific newsflow, things remain light ahead of tonight&rsquo;s rescheduled API release with traders wary over any further climbs in US production. In metals markets, spot gold has recovered from modest overnight losses to trade relatively unchanged as markets await today&rsquo;s FOMC minutes release. Elsewhere, price action across the rest of the complex remains light as Chinese participants away are still away from market.</p>\r\n",

Looing at basket components, Usd/Jpy has built on gains above the 2017 low (107.32), but stalled just before 108.00 amidst another bout of global stock market weakness. However, Jpy puts at the big figure have reportedly been in demand as the headline pair hovers around 107.50, with bids seen at 107.20. Eur/Usd is testing key Fib support at 1.2319 and buying interest into 1.2300 in wake of French, German and pan-EZ flash PMIs that missed consensus across the board. A downside break of 1.2300 exposes recent lows circa 1.2275 and stops below, but on the upside 1 bn option expiries run-off today between 1.2300-20. Cable looks capped at 1.4000 having faded on advances above the round number ahead of its 21 DMA (1.4033) and with offers seen at 1.3980+. 1.3950-55 is the 200 HMA being tested in the run up to UK data. Aud/Usd another notable mover, and retreating some distance from 0.7900 towards 0.7842 interim support despite former than forecast Aussie wages overnight as the breakdown was not as encouraging as the headline numbers appeared.</p>\r\n",

Wage prices had printed just above analyst estimates which had pushed <strong>AUD</strong> higher by 20pips against the greenback. However, gains had been short-lived with the data supported by the recent rise in minimum wages, subsequently suggesting that wage prices remain subdued, while the data point is not enough to change the narrative for the RBA. <strong>JPY</strong> also on the back-foot amid the risk on tone, consequently <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> continued to track higher into the mid-1.07s, although moves to the upside had been curbed by the dip in US equity futures and paring back of gains in Asian bourses.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Wage Price Index YY (Q4) 2.1% vs. Exp. 2.0% (Prev. 2.0%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Wage Price Index QQ (Q4) 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.5%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank&rsquo;s Floden says it is clear the Riksbank will probably raise rates before the ECB.

Nevertheless, the 2-year sale seemed to go OK as the yield stopped through the WI at the bidding deadline, although demand &ndash; measured by the B/C &ndash; declined from its multi-year high in January.

        "content": "<p>In what has been a relatively quiet session, Asian equities are trading with modestly gains this morning. Nikkei 225 up 1.2% as JPY continues to weaken across the board with USD/JPY hovering around 1.08, subsequently supporting Japanese exporters. Elsewhere, the ASX 200 had opened lower in response to the falls on Wall Street but has recovered into positive territory. Mining names the largest drag on the index with BHP and Fortescue both losing ground following soft earnings. Hang Seng trading higher this morning amid HSBC shares recovering from yesterdays declines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Main focus overnight had been the Australian wage price index data, after recent comments made by the RBA governor last week. Wage prices had printed just above analyst estimates which had pushed AUD higher by 20pips against the greenback. However, gains had been short-lived with the data supported by the recent rise in minimum wages, subsequently suggesting that wage prices remain subdued, while the data point is not enough to change the narrative for the RBA. JPY also on the back-foot amid the risk on tone, consequently USD/JPY has pushed from the mid-1.07s and looking to make a move towards 1.08.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In credit markets, the US Treasury curve is modestly flatter in the Asia-Pacific session, with the 10-Year yield last 0.4bp higher at 2.89%. JGBs trading in a tight range, with the 10yr up by 3 ticks.</p>\r\n",

In fact, that should have boosted wage&nbsp;growth by more, which implies that the true trend&nbsp;may have softened a bit.&nbsp;Other evidence suggests that, despite the recent&nbsp;strength of jobs growth, wage pressures have not&nbsp;picked up much. For example, the annual growth&nbsp;rate of enterprise bargaining agreements declined&nbsp;further in the third quarter of last year. Given that&nbsp;such agreements tend to last for a couple of years, they will restrain wage growth for a while. As such, we have pencilled in a 0.5% q/q rise in the wage price index for the fourth quarter, which would leave the annual growth rate at 2.0%.</p>\r\n",
