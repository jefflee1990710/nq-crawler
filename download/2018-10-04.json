Additionally, Italian Interior Minister Salvini said that citizens income and pensions measures are to cost EUR 16bln and added they are not taking a step back on the deficit targets even if the German-Italian 10-year spread widens to 400bps; he further stated it is in the EU interest that Italy returns to growth. Italian Industry Association has said they are &quot;partially satisfied&quot; with the new budget plan. Also, ECB&#39;s Rehn commented noting he does not see big contagion from the country and added that the ECB sets the policy for the whole of the EZ, not for one member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US VP Pence believes China is more proactive than ever in exerting influence and in interfering in US policy and politics; he accused China of using currency manipulation, IP theft as well as using &quot;debt diplomacy&quot; to expand its influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>An EU Source said that the new Irish Border proposal after Brexit is a &quot;step in the right direction&quot; and a compromise is possible after this; note reports earlier showed that Ireland backs UK PM May&#39;s plan for an all-UK customs union with the EU. UK PM May also suggested the whole of the UK will participate in a customs union with the EU if no solution is found on the Irish border issue. Elsewhere, Irish Foreign Minister Coveney said he is not aware of any Irish backstop proposals yet and he hopes to see them in the next week. Also, EU&rsquo;s Tusk commented a Canada style Brexit stating in a tweet to have offered the UK a Canada+++ deal, urging for further-reaching on trade, internal security and foreign policy cooperation. Finally, EU Chief Negotiator Barnier warned that, in order to agree to any Brexit deal, it is necessary to have a legally sound backstop solution for Ireland / Northern Ireland stating they are now entering in the final stage of negotiations and are working hand-in-hand with the Irish government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Coeure (Neutral) said the ECB will continue to support the stability of the euro area as a whole; he sees a gradual pick-up in price pressures though emphasizes a bit more time is needed to stabilise inflation around 2%. He believes the Eurozone economy is in the best shape it has been in years. On Brexit, he said the ECB is working on all scenarios, including a hard UK exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS </strong>fell slightly to 207k from un upwardly revised 215k, expectations were for 213k. Analysts at Pantheon expect claims to reach new cycle lows breaking through the 200k mark for the first time since 1969. They also suggest the increase in claims due to Hurricane Florence was pretty much insignificant as smaller than anticipated, and think claims will continue to edge lower since robust growth is likely to persist for some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FACTORY ORDERS </strong>posted at 2.3% in August a tad above the 2.1% consensus; the prior was downwardly revised to -0.5%. The solid print was &lsquo;boosted by an upswing in the volatile aircraft category that more than offset moderation in the core durable and nondurable categories&rsquo;, Barclays notes. Durables fell mildly to 4.4% from 4.5% whilst durables excluding transportation were unchanged; orders for non-defence capital goods net of aircrafts and parts were down 0.9%. Analysts at Barclays add that despite the headline coming in strong, core categories have moderated following the strong increases seen in June and July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BANXICO:</strong> As expected, the Banxico held rates at 7.75%, and sees the balance of risks to growth tilted towards the downside, while inflation risks are tilted towards the upside. There was one dissenter, who voted for a 25bps rate rise. Banxico said it is paying close attention to any potential pass through from the MXN, the relative monetary policy stance with the Fed, as well as levels of economic slack. The Peso was little changed after the rate decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.82% at 2902, NDX -1.93% at 7490, DJI -0.75% at 26627 SECTORS: </strong>Energy -0.52%, Materials -0.42%, Industrials -0.29%, Cons Discretionary -1.60%, Cons Staples -0.22%, Healthcare -0.94%, Financials +0.71%, Tech -1.79%, Telecoms -1.48%, Utilities +0.55%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Constellation Brands (STZ) was a top mover for the SPX on the day after beating earnings estimates and raising forward guidance, HP Inc (HPQ) also benefitted from promising full-year outlook. Eli &amp; Lilly (LLY) another big gainer on successful trial results for its experimental diabetes drug. National Oilwell Varco (NOV) outperformed, with the wider energy sector down. McKesson (MCK) also traded higher on reports that a co. it owns is in talks for an IPO. Biggest losers included the personal products co. Coty (COTY). Tech co. Akamai (AKAM) tumbled significantly as did Mercadolibre (MELI) and Workday (WDAY), with the tech sector trading lowest on the day. Tesla (TSLA) also continued its recent downtrend, one of the Nasdaq&rsquo;s worst performing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD &nbsp;2.08 LOWER AT USD 74.33/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 1.71 LOWER AT USD 84.58/BBL.</strong> Oil backed away from four-year+ highs on Thursday, prompted by a round of profit taking after Russia and Saudi Arabia recently signalled that there is additional spare capacity to raise output to offset any production/export hit from Venezuela; Saudi Arabian energy minister Al Falih said OPEC output could be lifted by 1.3mln BPD. Sources said the two nations had agreed an output rise without consulting other OPEC members. There were also external factors weighing on oil; the sharp rise in US yields has put pressure on global stock markets, and EMFX, with some analysts saying EM woes could impact global demand growth.&nbsp; Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia raised OSP premiums to Asia, cut to NE Europe, while kept its premium over Arab Light unchanged to the US; after the announcement, oil saw negative ticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 8+ TICKS LOWER AT 117-27+. </strong>The Treasury complex drifted lower once again on Thursday with yields continuing to be underpinned by positive US economic data which saw jobless claims nearing the 200k mark and factory orders rise more than expected as well as continuing positive narrative from the Fed after Fed&rsquo;s Powell stroke a hawkish tone in late comments on Wednesday. The 30yr yield posted 4-year highs and the 10yr reached new 7yr highs in the session. Most of the selling action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps. 2.30s and 2s10s were wider by c.1bps at settlement. The US announced that next week it will sell USD 36bln in 3yr notes, USD 23bln in reopened 10yr note and USD 15bln in reopened 30yr bonds next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, JPY, EUR: </strong>Heading a broad recovery against the Dollar, and all back around big figures that had been holding/supporting until the big break yesterday fuelled by strong US surveys and a hawkish Fed. Cable is extended its earlier bounce just over 1.3000 with some independent impetus via reports that the EU thinks revised UK proposals on the Irish border are moving in the right direction, and which have not been denied (yet). Similarly, the Jpy has bounced further from 114.50+ lows to just below 114.00 and the single currency has reclaimed 1.1500+ status, albeit just, amidst ongoing reflection on and reverberation from Italy&rsquo;s 2019-2021 deficit goals and budget projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, CHF: </strong>Mixed with the former ending Thursday&rsquo;s US session higher vs the Greenback, but narrowly mixed as the Loonie hovers above 1.2900 and derived little traction from declines in the Canadian IVEY PMIs (sa gauge particularly worrying at just over 50.0 vs 61.9 previously), but the Franc remained more resilient between 0.9900-25 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD, CHF:</strong> Off worst levels, but still the biggest net losers vs their US counterpart and G10 underperformers having lost 0.6500 and 0.7100 handles overnight amidst the ramp up in US Treasury yields. The Aud failed to glean any lasting benefit from a wider than forecast Aussie trade surplus and may not get much support from the impending AIG construction index given a slump in building approvals (albeit latter for August not September).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM:</strong> Very little sign of respite or retracement for regional currencies even though the Usd eased back from best levels elsewhere (DXY down to 95.633 vs 96.122 at one stage), as the Lira led declines or reversals from rebound highs to 6.2200+ lows from circa 6.0000 and higher before Wednesday&rsquo;s super strong Turkish CPI data. However, the Cnh pared some losses from the 6.9000+ area as the end of Golden Week approaches, and perhaps conscious about intervention next Monday? Mxn was little changed after Banxico kept rates unchanged as expect.</p>\r\n",

Cable is extended its earlier bounce just over 1.3000 with some independent impetus via reports that the EU thinks revised UK proposals on the Irish border are moving in the right direction, and which have not been denied (yet). Similarly, the Jpy has bounced further from 114.50+ lows to almost 114.00 and the single currency has reclaimed 1.1500+ status, albeit just, amidst ongoing reflection on and reverberation from Italy&rsquo;s 2019-2021 deficit goals and budget projections. Indeed, Eur/Gbp eventually took out stops residing at 0.8850 or on a break to test the 200 DMA around 0.9840.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both ending Thursday&rsquo;s EU session relatively flat vs the Greenback, but narrowly mixed as the Loonie hovers just above 1.2900 and derived little traction from declines in the Canadian IVEY PMIs (sa gauge particularly worrying at just over 50.0 vs 61.9 previously), but the Franc remained more resilient between 0.9900-25 parameters. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Off worst levels, but still the biggest net losers vs their US counterpart and G10 underperformers having lost 0.6500 and 0.7100 handles overnight amidst the ramp up in US Treasury yields. The Aud failed to glean any lasting benefit from a wider than forecast Aussie trade surplus and may not get much support from the impending AIG construction index given a slump in building approvals (albeit latter for August not September).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very little sign of respite or retracement for regional currencies even though the Usd eased back from best levels elsewhere (DXY down to 95.633 vs 96.122 at one stage), as the Lira led declines or reversals from rebound highs to 6.2200+ lows from circa 6.0000 and higher before Wednesday&rsquo;s super strong Turkish CPI data. However, the Cnh pared some losses from the 6.9000+ area as the end of Golden Week approaches, and perhaps conscious about intervention next Monday?</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) bucked the trend as the index was supported by energy and financial names, while Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) eroded initial gains and fell in the red on currency effects. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.7%) underperformed as the healthcare sector also weighed on the index, while mainland China was closed due to the Golden Week holiday. Finally, JGB yields rose across the curve with the 10yr and 30yr yields hitting levels last seen at the front end of 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Vice President Pence is to say that US &quot;will not be intimidated&quot; by China following the dispute at the South China sea. According to the excerpts, Pence is also to say that China laid out a strategy in June to split US groups with &quot;covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets&quot;. In related news, the US Navy is reportedly to propose a &quot;major&quot; show of force to warn China after the South China sea quarrel.

PM May&#39;s team want MPs to get a meaningful vote two weeks after striking a deal with the EU; according to sources (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>France warned it would prefer Britain to crash out of Europe without a Brexit deal rather than accept a compromise.&nbsp; (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pre-market reports suggested that Ireland back UK PM May&#39;s plan for an all-UK customs union with the EU. UK PM May suggested the whole of the UK to participate in a customs union with the EU if no solution is found on the Irish border issue. EU&#39;s Chief Negotiator Barnier rejected the idea but officials in Dublin privately argued that it could settle the border issue and open the way to a deal. A senior Irish Official said, &quot;it looks like it would solve the issue [of the Irish border], whether the EU accepts it or not is another conversation&quot;. (FT) Later, EU Sources said that the new Irish Border proposal after Brexit is a &quot;step in the right direction&quot; and a compromise is possible after this. Irish Foreign Minister Coveney responded, saying he is not aware of any Irish backstop proposals yet, hopes to see them in the next week. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An increase in the EU&rsquo;s pension costs and spending promises rose by 10&rsquo;s of billions of EUR, according to an official report which has subsequently raised the prospect of an increase in the Brexit divorce bill. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Italian Government were reportedly looking at GDP Growth of 1.5% in 2019, 1.6% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021. Italy&#39;s Deputy Economy Minister says the Government has set the 2019/20 GDP target at 1.6%. Italian Interior Minister Salvini then said that citizens income and pensions measures in budget are to cost EUR 16bln and that they are not taking a step back on the deficit targets even if the German-Italian 10-year spread widens to 400BPS. Italian Industry Association has said they are &quot;partially satisfied&quot; with the new budget plan. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU sources suggested that the report in Italian media that the European Commission has drafted a letter rejecting Rome&#39;s budget plan is &#39;unfounded&#39;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell (Neutral) said the Fed may raise rates past the neutral level. He is happy where the economy is, unemployment is lowest in 20 years and inflation is at the 2% goal. He expects to see gradual increases in wages, while labour market data shows US pretty close to full employment. He added the next downturn will not look like the last as risks are moderate (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Rehn said he sees no big contagion from Italy, adding that the ECB sets the policy for the whole of the EZ, not for one member. He also stated that rates will remain at current levels until at least September 2019 and agrees with market expectations for the timing of the Bank&#39;s first rate hike (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guardian&#39;s Elgot tweets &quot;New info that Dutch intelligence, backed up by Brits, disrupted Russian intelligence cyber attack on OPCW - the body investigating chemical attacks in Salisbury and Douma&quot;.

In fact, the FOMC head went as far as saying that rates may be hiked above neutral levels and expressed concern about the economy overheating, prompting further Dollar buying that pushed the DXY beyond 96.000 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY/CHF/EUR - All attempting to regain composure, or fight the Fed, as Cable rebounds above 1.2950, Usd/Jpy retreats from 114.50+ highs, the Franc retests support around 0.9900 and the single currency pares some losses within a 1.1465-1.1500 broad range. However, the bounces look shallow if not futile and more technical than sustainable or based on anything fundamental, at this stage, with Eur/Usd eyeing key Fib levels above and below (1.1497-22), and wary about mega option expiries running off on NFP Friday from 1.1450 to 1.1500 in 3.7 bn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD - The major casualties or victims of their US counterpart&rsquo;s resurgence, as the antipodean Dollars failed to hold big figure/round number/psychological supports amidst the swathe of all round Greenback buying and slumped to lows circa 0.7065 and 0.6485 respectively. Note, the Aud only received fleeting respite from better than expected Aussie trade data overnight, while the Loonie has lost more of its USMCA lustre to trade further below 1.2800, through 1.2850 and not that far from 1.2900 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CROSSES - Aside from all the action in Usd/G10 pairings, some interesting price moves in Eur/Gbp that is inching closer to downside stops around 0.8850 and a strong chart support level (200 DMA is 0.8840), while Eur/Jpy has also retreated further to meander between 131.00-50, with an unusually large expiry at the 130.50 strike (1 bn) lurking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - No shock to see the higher yield/beta/risk currencies suffer at the hands of widespread Usd demand, as Usd/Try rebounds further from recent sub-6.0000 lows, but the Cny and Cnh have pared some losses from the 6.9000+ area as Golden Week nears an end, perhaps conscious about intervention next Monday?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil market is hanging around 4 year highs, but is off best levels after Saudi Energy Minister confirmed the Middle-Eastern exporter has a spare capacity of 1.3mln BPD, whilst also saying that Saudi exports to the US are increasing markedly. The Energy Minister also said that they are to add and maintain another 1mln BPD of spare capacity by investing USD 20bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil relevant news has come in the form of a preliminary estimate of a 8-11mln cubic meter discovery in the Norwegian sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gold market is recovering from the losses seen in the previous session (-USD 6/oz), with it currently testing USD 1200/OZ to the upside. This came after the DXY hit 6 week highs off the back of hawkish commentary from Fed Chair Powell. Aluminium has risen to its highest point in over 3 months and extending the gains driven by Norsk Hydro&rsquo;s Brazilian site closure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bonds are only just holding off worst levels and bracing for the return of US participants to see whether bears remain in control of the tape or bulls attempt to regain some influence over proceedings, Bunds and just back above 158.00 and Gilts off a new Liffe session low (120.11, -98 ticks) after a less than well received 2024 auction, while US Treasuries have pared some overnight losses, but maintain a clear negative and steepening bias. Looking at BTPs, early outperformance and forays in positive territory towards 123.00 have been thwarted, as the 10 year benchmark reverses to a 121.56 base (-53 ticks) amidst ongoing doubt regarding Italy&rsquo;s budget. Back to the UK, and aside from the overall bearish trend in debt, latest Brexit headlines are weighing after reports that the EU deems new Irish border plans as a step in the right direction. However, technical factors may be propping up Bunds to a degree as September lows around 157.74 hold for now.</p>\r\n",

Looking at BTPs, early outperformance and forays in positive territory towards 123.00 have been thwarted, as the 10 year benchmark reverses to a 121.56 base (-53 ticks) amidst ongoing doubt regarding Italy&rsquo;s budget. Back to the UK, and aside from the overall bearish trend in debt, latest Brexit headlines are weighing after reports that the EU deems new Irish border plans as a step in the right direction. However, technical factors may be propping up Bunds to a degree as September lows around 157.74 hold for now.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some loss of momentum and a retracement from peaks, but the Greenback remains underpinned by elevated US Treasury yields and marked curve re-steepening in wake of Wednesday&rsquo;s upbeat US macro releases and comments from Fed&rsquo;s Powell acknowledging the latest ADP and services ISM survey strength. In fact, the FOMC head went as far as saying that rates may be hiked above neutral levels and expressed concern about the economy overheating, prompting further Dollar buying that pushed the DXY beyond 96.000 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY/CHF/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All attempting to regain composure, or fight the Fed, as Cable rebounds above 1.2950, Usd/Jpy retreats from 114.50+ highs, the Franc retests support around 0.9900 and the single currency pares some losses within a 1.1465-1.1500 broad range. However, the bounces look shallow if not futile and more technical than sustainable or based on anything fundamental, at this stage, with Eur/Usd eyeing key Fib levels above and below (1.1497-22), and wary about mega option expiries running off on NFP Friday from 1.1450 to 1.1500 in 3.7 bn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major casualties or victims of their US counterpart&rsquo;s resurgence, as the antipodean Dollars failed to hold big figure/round number/psychological supports amidst the swathe of all round Greenback buying and slumped to lows circa 0.7065 and 0.6485 respectively. Note, the Aud only received fleeting respite from better than expected Aussie trade data overnight, while the Loonie has lost more of its USMCA lustre to trade further below 1.2800, through 1.2850 and not that far from 1.2900 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CROSSES &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from all the action in Usd/G10 pairings, some interesting price moves in Eur/Gbp that is inching closer to downside stops around 0.8850 and a strong chart support level (200 DMA is 0.8840), while Eur/Jpy has also retreated further to meander between 131.00-50, with an unusually large expiry at the 130.50 strike (1 bn) lurking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No shock to see the higher yield/beta/risk currencies suffer at the hands of widespread Usd demand, as Usd/Try rebounds further from recent sub-6.0000 lows, but the Cny and Cnh have pared some losses from the 6.9000+ area as Golden Week nears an end, perhaps conscious about intervention next Monday?</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.7%) underperformed as the healthcare sector also weighed on the index, while mainland China was closed due to the Golden Week holiday.
