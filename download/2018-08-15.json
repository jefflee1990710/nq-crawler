Emerging markets continued to sell-off on Wednesday amid the Turkey &lsquo;contagion&rsquo; which saw both US and European equity markets suffer; the Emini Nasdaq underperformed due to poor Tencent earnings, adding to pressure in the tech sector. Energy, materials and technology were the three laggards in the SPX today with energy names hit following lower crude prices, while materials lagged as metal prices declined across the board with copper reaching its lowest point in over a year. The tech sector also an under performer following a very poor earnings report from Tencent (0700 HK) which hit the US ADR&rsquo;s of Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) &amp; JD.com (JD), as well as many other tech names in the US.

There were some reports that Qatar pledged to invest USD 15bln in Turkey&cedil; with the news helping to turn around risk sentiment slightly. Analysts at UBS on Wednesday argued that although the market focus remains on any developments in the region, participants are expected to move on to something else as they believe &lsquo;contagion risk&rsquo; is limited. UBS points out Turkey may be an additional factor posing threats to the global turmoil, though the main drivers of overall risk sentiment appear to be trade tensions aggravated by US recession fear, which is never too far from investors&rsquo; mind. Fed&#39;s Bullard also followed a similar line stating he does not see Turkey leading to generalised contagion. With regards to the US detainee Pastor Brunson, the Turkish Court rejected the appeal for his release. In later trade, Turkey&rsquo;s foreign minister said the nation is ready to discuss the issues with the US &ldquo;without threats&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>TRADE</strong>: US President Trump said in a tweet the US was built on tariffs and that tariffs are leading to great new trade deals for the US, in contrast to those &#39;horrible and unfair&#39; trade deals inherited from the previous US administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> RETAIL SALES</strong> in July were solid in most areas; M/M print rose 0.5%, beating expectations of 0.1%, the Ex-Autos posted at 0.6% against the consensus 0.3% and the Control measure rose 0.5%, beating expectations of 0.4%. Growth was not concentrated in any particular area, however, the big surprise was the 0.2% increase in auto sales, which is seemingly at odds with the 3.1% drop previously reported by automakers. Wells Fargo attributed July&rsquo;s boost to the possible consequences of tariffs, which are giving buyers more motivation to make purchases before prices shoot up. In addition, the Control figure was supported by robust department store and clothing sales which have picked up since the tax cuts. Overall analysts at Pantheon noted there is &ldquo;no reason to expect any incremental acceleration, but these numbers mean that a decent increase in total real consumption in July is a good bet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong>US INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION</strong> increased by just 0.1% in July, slightly weaker than expected, compared to a 1.0% rise in June. Mining and Utilities kept the figure lower but overall headline is strong at 4.2% YY. Analysts at Oxford Economics argue the stronger dollar, waning global growth momentum, trade war tensions and a steady oil price environment with supply constraints will all weigh on the figure for the next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>BUSINESS INVENTORIES</strong> rose 0.1% in June as expected. Gradual stock building resumed since March and was spread evenly across manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers though at a slower pace than sales growth. Analysts at Oxford Economics note &lsquo;persistent supply chain constraints and turbulence on the trade front are making businesses cautious to ramp up their stocks&rsquo;. They expect the trend to pick up in the second half but would not be too surprised if inventories continued to remain thin through year-end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>NAHB INDEX </strong>dropped one point to 67 in August, as expected, hitting an 11-month low. Analysts at Pantheon noted the housing market is the only US sector showing some weakness as demand is gradually falling and &ldquo;lending standards for conventional mortgages is weighing on activity.&rdquo; Nonetheless, Housing Starts due tomorrow should show that activity rebounded in July from the unexpected drop in June, Pantheon said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> SPX</strong> down 0.76% at 2818, NDX down 1.24% at 7355, DJI down 0.54% at 25163. SECTORS: Energy -3.51%, Materials -1.55%, Industrials -0.48% Cons Discretionary -1.21%, Cons&nbsp; Staples +0.44%, Healthcare -0.16%, Financials -0.67%, Tech -1.07%, Telecoms +0.69%, Utilities +0.77%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>FUTURES</strong>: US futures were hit on Wednesday&rsquo;s session following a combination of factors. The continued dollar strength from yesterday&rsquo;s gains aided the fall in stocks as well as USDCNY closing at fresh highs just shy of the 7 handle keeping fears of outflows fresh and centre in the mind of traders. Emerging markets continued to sell-off on Wednesday amid the Turkey &lsquo;contagion&rsquo; which saw both US and European equity markets suffer; the Emini Nasdaq underperformed due to poor Tencent earnings, adding to pressure in the tech sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>SECTORS</strong>: Energy, materials and technology were the three laggards in the SPX today, Energy names were hit following lower crude prices, while materials were lagging as metal prices were lower across the board with copper reaching its lowest point in over a year. The tech sector also an under performer following a very poor earnings report from Tencent (0700 HK) which hit the US ADR&rsquo;s of Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) &amp; JD.com (JD), as well as many other tech names in the US. NOTE: JD.com earnings are on the slate for tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Macy&rsquo;s (M) beat on both top and bottom line and raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year. However, the retailer&rsquo;s spending increased, and its operating cash flow fell versus last year, and it also stated its comparable sales on an owned basis are expected to be around 20 to 30 basis points lower than the previous years. Macy&rsquo;s saw losses of greater than 10%, leading it to have its worst day since May 2017. This also hit other retailers such as Nordstrom (JWN), who are to report tomorrow, and Kohl&rsquo;s (KSS), who are scheduled to report next week. The Tesla (TSLA) saga continues, on reports suggested that Silverlake was said to be interested in the Tesla deal to take the automaker private (in line with yesterday&rsquo;s reports), while analysts at Goldman Sachs have ceased to rate Tesla, as the bank takes on an advisory role in taking the company private. Apple (AAPL) is being probed in Japan over anti-competitive behaviour, Nikkei reported; the FTC is looking into alleged pressure to quash Yahoo&rsquo;s Game Plus platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>WTI CRUDE FUTURES (U8) SETTLE &nbsp;LOWER AT USD /BBL; BRENT CRUDE FUTURES (V8) SETTLE &nbsp;LOWER AT USD /BBL</strong>. Crude extended losses on Wednesday in the face of a range of factors: crude futures slid on the release of the EIA&rsquo;s weekly inventory data, where headline crude stocks built (+6.805mln vs. Exp.-2.499mln) and production increased (+0.93% to 10.9mln). Stocks at Cushing build of 1.643mln, in line with the API report released on Tuesday, Gasoline stocks -0.740mln vs Exp. -0.583mln, and Distillate Stocks +3.566mln vs Exp. +0.964mln. Pressure also remains from the Turkey/EM crises, where a stronger dollar has been cited as weighing on crude. Elsewhere, ongoing trade disputes bring concern to WTI demand-side of the equation, after reports that there had been no loadings to China from the US in August; currently US crude is not on China&rsquo;s tariff list, but market participants fear this may be temporary. Elsewhere, Libya is not escaping attention either, as the Sharara oil field is normalises production. And in OPEC-watch, some suggest that the Iranian oil minister&rsquo;s attendance of the upcoming JMMC meeting could be a negative for crude, as the nation makes efforts to defend its market share in the face of looming US sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> US 10-YEAR T-NOTES SETTLED 10+ TICKS HIGHER AT 120-14</strong>. The Treasury Complex was on the front foot, spurred by continuing worries regarding Ems (Turkey, and the yuan slide). Yields fell, dragging the 10-year to 2.85, while major curve spreads found new cycle narrows (2s10s slipped beneath 25bps to 11-year flats, while 2s5s also narrowed to the flattest in just under 11 years. There was some negative ticks as risk sentiment improved on reports that Qatar was to invest $15bln into Turkey, seeing Treasuries back away from HOD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>TRY</strong>: Choppy around the 6.0000 mark, but ending Wednesday&rsquo;s session considerably closer to 5.9070 lows vs 6.5700 highs as the Lira managed to retain its recovery momentum in the face of another EM meltdown. Moreover, the TRY recovered from several set-backs, including the rejection of a US appeal to get Pastor Brunson free and more retaliatory import tariffs imposed by Turkey overnight. However, the Dollar benefited at the expense of others, like the ZAR, BRL, MXN and RUB that also suffered from commodity-related factors as crude prices tanked and metals were crushed. Note, Argentina&rsquo;s Central Bank intervened in FX to prevent the Ars that slipped under 30.0000 vs the USD after fleeting respite following the 500 bp tightening. With regards to Turkey, the central bank has now cancelled the one-week repo window, pushing banks into the overnight window (with a higher rate, making it more costly to speculate on Lira moves), and there was also reports on Wednesday that the leverage ratio on TRY forex market transactions has been set at 1:1 until 3 September, again seemingly in an effort to stem the Lira&rsquo;s slide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>DXY, EUR</strong>: Aside from the positive factors/flows noted above, the Greenback and index derived extra support from declines in G10 counterparts, bar the JPY again (that headline pair back below 111.00 due to the JPY&rsquo;s status as &lsquo;the&rsquo; currency safe-haven), plus the latest Fed QE redemption day (aka SOMA). Indeed, Usd12.6 bn net cash outflows are estimated over the course of today and Nordea highlights that the USD &lsquo;always&rsquo; gains on SOMA days vs the EUR, or at least has since February. Hence, EURUSD appeared almost destined to retreat further from 1.1350 peaks (just ahead of the 200 WMA at 1.1356) towards 1.1300 and big barriers defending stops below the big figure, while the DXY inched closer to 97.000 at 96.991. However, in afternoon trade, global risk sentiment improved, and with that, the dollar&rsquo;s gains were pared back for the DXY to go flat heading into APAC trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CAD, AUD</strong>: Notwithstanding the aforementioned SOMA effect, the Loonie lost most ground vs its US counterpart as oil recoiled and Canadian data revealed a marked slowdown in existing home sales. USDCAD is firmly back above 1.3100 and rebounded further from big option expiry interest at the 1.3050 strike (1bln), while AUDUSD only just held above 0.7200 barriers and stops lying on a break even though the USD after another 1+ year high close for the CNY close to 6.9050; The CNH also rose to the highest since Jan 2017. Meanwhile. AUD was also pressured by a sharp fall in copper prices, which entered into a bear market on Wednesday, amid ongoing geopolitical tensions in Turkey and global trade tensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>GBP</strong>: The Pound derived little to no traction from an uptick in headline y/y UK CPI as this was widely expected, with Cable extending to the downside and hitting fresh ytd lows around 1.2670 having failed to retain 1.2700+ status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> CHF</strong>: The Franc has emerged as a relative outperformer or more resilient major, also on safe-haven grounds, with USDCHF easing back towards 0.9950 vs 0.9980 at one stage and EURCHF down to around 1.1260 from 1.1305 at the other extreme. However, latest currency moves prompted more SNB verbal intervention via Zurbrugg and it would be no surprise at all to hear or even see more of the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>COMING UP &ndash; NORGES BANK</strong>: The Norges Bank are set to hold their latest interest rate decision on Thursday, with analysts unanimously expecting an unchanged base-rate at 0.50% on August 16th, and all those polled expecting a 25BPS hike in September. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19866/download\">Read RANsquawk preview here.</a></p>\r\n",

Stocks at Cushing build of 1.643mln, in line with the API report released on Tuesday, Gasoline stocks -0.740mln vs Exp. -0.583mln, and Distillate Stocks +3.566mln vs Exp. +0.964mln. Pressure also remains from the Turkey/EM crises, where a stronger dollar has been cited as weighing on crude. Elsewhere, ongoing trade disputes bring concern to WTI demand-side of the equation, after reports that there had been no loadings to China from the US in August; currently US crude is not on China&rsquo;s tariff list, but market participants fear this may be temporary. Elsewhere, Libya is not escaping attention either, as the Sharara oil field is normalises production. And in OPEC-watch, some suggest that the Iranian oil minister&rsquo;s attendance of the upcoming JMMC meeting could be a negative for crude, as the nation makes efforts to defend its market share in the face of looming US sanctions.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD/TRY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choppy around the 6.0000 mark, but ending Wednesday&rsquo;s session considerably closer to 5.9070 lows vs 6.5700 highs as the Lira managed to retain its recovery momentum in the face of another EM meltdown. Moreover, the Try recovered from several set-backs, including the rejection of a US appeal to get Pastor Brunson free and more retaliatory import tariffs imposed by Turkey overnight. However, the Dollar benefited at the expense of others, like the Zar, Brl, Mxn and Rub that also suffered from commodity-related factors as crude prices tanked and metals were crushed. Note, Argentina&rsquo;s Central Bank intervened in FX to prevent the Ars that slipped under 30.0000 vs the Usd after fleeting respite following the 500 bp tightening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the positive factors/flows noted above, the Greenback and index derived extra support from declines in G10 counterparts, bar the JPY again (that headline pair back below 111.00 due to the Jpy&rsquo;s status as &lsquo;the&rsquo; currency safe-haven), plus the latest Fed QE redemption day (aka SOMA). Indeed, Usd12.6 bn net cash outflows are estimated over the course of today and Nordea highlights that the Usd &lsquo;always&rsquo; gains on SOMA days vs the EUR, or at least has since February. Hence, Eur/Usd appeared almost destined to retreat further from 1.1350 peaks (just ahead of the 200 WMA at 1.1356) towards 1.1300 and big barriers defending stops below the big figure, while the DXY inched closer to 97.000 at 96.991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding the aforementioned SOMA effect, the Loonie lost most ground vs its US counterpart as oil recoiled and Canadian data revealed a marked slowdown in existing home sales. Usd/Cad is firmly back above 1.3100 and rebounded further from big option expiry interest at the 1.3050 strike (1 bn), while Aud/Usd only just held above 0.7200 barriers and stops lying on a break even though the YUAN continued to weaken (Cnh down near 6.9500 vs the Usd after another 1+ year high close for the Cny close to 6.9050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound derived little to no traction from an uptick in headline y/y UK CPI as this was widely expected, with Cable extending to the downside and hitting fresh ytd lows around 1.2670 having failed to retain 1.2700+ status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc has emerged as a relative outperformer or more resilient major, also on safe-haven grounds, with Usd/Chf easing back towards 0.9950 vs 0.9980 at one stage and Eur/Chf down to around 1.1260 from 1.1305 at the other extreme. However, latest currency moves prompted more SNB verbal intervention via Zurbrugg and it would be no surprise at all to hear or even see more of the same.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-2.0%) saw hefty losses and the Hang Seng (-1.5%) declined to its lowest in around a year in a continuation of the recent underperformance as Tencent and tech names remained pressured, while the PBoC skipped reverse repo operations for a 19th consecutive occasion and although it later announced CNY 383bln in 1yr MLF loans, this was still lower than its previous MLF operation of CNY 502bln in late July.

On that note, the SNB appears to have reached its tolerance limit with the Franc and as suspected reiterated the need for ZIRP and FX intervention to curb Chf demand and stabilise fragile FX developments. Usd/Chf rebounding as a result towards parity and Eur/Chf close to 1.1300 vs 1.1275 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY/EUR/CAD/AUD - All softer vs the Greenback to varying degrees, with Cable only just recovering from a sub-1.2700 dip on firmer, but broadly in line with consensus UK inflation readings, while Usd/Jpy has rebounded a bit further from recent lows to probe higher above 111.00 from 111.15-40 and Eur/Usd meanders between 1.1350-15. Note, barrier interest is reported at 1.1300 while on the flip side today is another SOMA redemption day and Nordea notes that since February EUR/USD has fallen between 14:30BST and 17:30BST without fail during those hours (today&rsquo;s maturities equate to a net USD 12.6bln drain). The Loonie has lost some traction from crude prices and trades within 1.3095-50 parameters with a hefty option expiry (1 bn) running off at the bottom end at the NY cut, and similarly Aud/Usd is now eyeing 0.7200 barriers and stops below having breached support at 0.7250 overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crude complex has continued the pullback seen in yesterday&rsquo;s trade that was exacerbated by a surprise build in API crude inventories, with Brent and WTI breaking though the USD 72/BBL and USD 67/BBL levels to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at metals, all of zinc (-2.2%), lead (-1.9%) and gold (-0.5%) are down with the yellow metal below the USD 1190/OZ level, as the rising USD is hitting the metals sector as a whole.

The Loonie has lost some traction from crude prices and trades within 1.3085-50 parameters with a hefty option expiry (1 bn) running off at the bottom end at the NY cut, and similarly Aud/Usd is now eyeing 0.7200 barriers and stops below having breached support at 0.7250 overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Try continues its resurrection after another bout of weakness ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s EU open, the 10 year German debt future unwinds a bit more of its safe-haven premium to trade below par at 163.10 compared to yesterday&rsquo;s 163.21 close and a 163.33 Eurex starting print/peak. However, Bunds and core bonds in general still look bid on pull-backs as all is far from fixed on the Lira or wider EM front, and attention reverts to the Yuan that continues to weaken in wake of another firmer Usd/Cny mid-point setting and subsequent rise in Usd/Cnh above 6.9000 towards 6.9300, eclipsing levels that triggered official intervention recently. Turning to Liffe, Gilts are trading marginally firmer within a 123.36-46 range around their 123.38 previous settlement and the Short Sterling strip is narrowly mixed between +/- 1 tick around par, awaiting some independent direction from today&rsquo;s UK inflation data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crude complex has continued the pullback seen in yesterday&rsquo;s trade that was exacerbated by a surprise build in API crude inventories, with Brent and WTI breaking though the USD 72/BBL and USD 67/BBL levels to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at metals, all of zinc (-2.2%), lead (-1.9%) and gold (-0.5%) are down with the yellow metal below the USD 1190/OZ level, as the rising USD is hitting the metals sector as a whole. Copper is also down about 2% on the day and has hit a 13 month low, with the construction material hammered by the Escondida copper mine union stopping a strike amid a new contract offer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian Oil Minister to attend JMMC meeting in Algeria in September</p>\r\n",

Indeed, of the SOMA days since February 28, it has been a good idea to sell EUR/USD at CET14:30 and close the position a few hours later. The hit ratio of going long DXY at CET09:00 on SOMA days, and closing the position CET17:30 is 100% since February&hellip;&nbsp;The next redemption is coming up on Wednesday August 15 (implying a net negative effect on US liquidity by 12.6bn).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

However, Bunds and core bonds in general still look bid on pull-backs as all is far from fixed on the Lira or wider EM front, and attention reverts to the Yuan that continues to weaken in wake of another firmer Usd/Cny mid-point setting and subsequent rise in Usd/Cnh above 6.9000 towards 6.9300, eclipsing levels that triggered official intervention recently. Turning to Liffe, Gilts are trading marginally firmer within a 123.36-46 range around their 123.38 previous settlement and the Short Sterling strip is narrowly mixed between +/- 1 tick around par, awaiting some independent direction from today&rsquo;s UK inflation data.</p>\r\n",

The headline figure is forecast to come in at 2.5%, above the previous of 2.4%, whilst the core is seen staying in line at 1.9% YY. The expected pickup in inflation is forecast to come from an increase in food and energy prices. Analysts at RBC highlight a fuel price pick-up of &ldquo;almost 12% YY&rdquo; which will likely add a &ldquo;large upward contribution&rdquo;. Furthermore, increasing food prices are expected to contribute too as the &ldquo;BRC shop price index show[ed] food price inflation, particularly fresh food, accelerating in July&rdquo;. Should this come to fruition it would add credence to the BoE&rsquo;s rhetoric of increasing &ldquo;domestic inflationary pressures&rdquo;, and add more weight to the reasoning behind raising rates than the mixed labour market report on Tuesday. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) weakened amid profit taking following the prior day&rsquo;s gains of over 2%, while ASX 200 (+0.1%) remained afloat on technical buying as the index reclaimed the 6300 level but with upside capped by losses in financials as Australia&rsquo;s largest lender CBA suffered on criminal misconduct allegations. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%) saw hefty losses and the Hang Seng (-1.5%) declined to its lowest in around a year in a continuation of the recent underperformance as Tencent and tech names remained pressured, while the PBoC skipped reverse repo operations for a 19th consecutive occasion and although it later announced CNY 383bln in 1yr MLF loans, this was still lower than its previous MLF operation of CNY 502bln in late July. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher with only minimal support seen amid the profit taking seen in Japanese stocks and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market in which the central bank kept its purchase amounts unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC refrained from reverse repos but announced to lend CNY 383bln through 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8856 (Prev. 6.8695)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese House Prices (Jul) Y/Y 5.8% (Prev. 5.0%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The greenback extended on gains which pressured its counterparts across the board with EUR/USD firmly below 1.1400 and with GBP/USD at its weakest in 14 months in which it briefly broke through 1.2700 to the downside. Elsewhere, AUD/USD and NZD/USD were subdued following the declines across the commodities complex and due to their high-beta characteristics amid the backdrop of the subdued risk tone. In addition, CNY was also pressured in which USD/CNY climbed above 6.9000 for the first time since May last year amid the broad USD strength and after the PBoC continued to weaken the reference rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were lower across the board with WTI crude futures back below USD 67/bbl following yesterday&rsquo;s pullback which was exacerbated by a surprise build in headline API crude inventories. Elsewhere, the metals complex was also pressured in which copper underperformed on a firmer greenback and risk averse tone which dragged LME prices below USD 6000/ton to its weakest in over a year, while gold also extended on losses amid the broad flows into the greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (10 Aug) +3.66M vs. Exp. -2.50M (Prev. -6.00M). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Pompeo stated the US remains in close cooperation with South Korea to ensure the final denuclearisation of North Korea. In related news, there were also comments from South Korean President Moon that a 3rd inter-Korean summit would be another step towards peace treaty and denuclearization of the peninsula. (Twitter/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State spokesperson Nauert said talks are ongoing with Turkey for the release of Pastor Brunson. However, there were also comments from a US official that nothing has developed on the Pastor Brunson case and who warned of more actions on Turkey if he is not freed. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkey raised tariffs on imported goods including cars, alcohol and tobacco from the US, while Turkish Vice President Oktay stated that they increased tariffs on some US imports as a response to the US administration&#39;s deliberate attacks on the Turkish economy. (Newswires/Official Gazette)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex followed its European peers on Tuesday and remained subdued amid a slightly less risk-averse tone as the situation in Turkey appears less threatening than previous days. The yield curve saw some modest bear-flattening for most of the morning US session with 2yr yield higher by c.2bps and 30yr yield by c.1bps. US 10YR T-notes settled 4+ ticks lower at 120-03+.</p>\r\n",

As such, Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) is weaker amid profit taking following the prior day&rsquo;s outperformance in which the index gained over 2%, while ASX 200 (+0.1%) has remained afloat on technical buying as the index reclaims the 6300 level but with upside capped by losses in financials as Australia&rsquo;s largest lender CBA suffers on criminal misconduct allegations related to its wealth management business. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) continue their recent underperformance as Tencent and tech names remain pressured, while the PBoC skipped reverse repo operations for a 19th consecutive occasion and although it later announced CNY 383bln in 1yr MLFs, this was still lower than its last MLF operation of CNY 502bln late last month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are quiet overnight with the DXY steady above the 96.00 level as the greenback holds on to its recent gains, while its major counterparts languish at the prior day&rsquo;s lows with EUR/USD firmly below 1.1400 and with GBP/USD at its weakest in over a year as it eyes the 1.2700 level to the downside. Elsewhere, AUD/USD and NZD/USD are subdued following the declines across the commodities complex and further weakening of the CNY reference rate, as well as due to their high-beta characteristics amid the backdrop of the subdued risk tone for most the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher with only minimal support seen amid the profit taking seen in Japanese stocks and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market in which the central bank kept its purchase amounts unchanged.</p>\r\n",
