US President Trump also stated that the deal should never have been made and has allowed Iran to continue to enrich uranium, while he stated to be ready, willing and able to renegotiate a deal with Iran. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Department said oil related sanctions on Iran are to be re-imposed in 180 days and US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that effectively sanctions will be going into place immediately. Furthermore, Mnuchin also commented that the US will be working with allies on a comprehensive deal and that firms can seek waivers or special licences to operate in Iran. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French President Macron noted that France will work collectively on a broader framework, covering nuclear activity, the post-2025 period, ballistic activity, and stability in the Middle-East, notably Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. Furthermore, there were also comments by EU&rsquo;s Mogherimi that the EU vows to uphold Iran nuclear accord despite Trump&rsquo;s decision. (Twitter/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran&#39;s leader Rouhani said Iran is committed to its own and confirmed that Iran will continue the nuclear deal with members of the P5+1 even without US. (State TV)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was volatility in crude prices with the rumour mill rife in the hours leading to the announcement, in which crude initially fell around USD 2 to below USD 68/bbl amid CNN reports that US President Trump is to announce new sanctions against Iran and will not withdraw from the deal. However, the weakness was then pared on conflicting reports that President Trump decided to pull-out of the agreement which was later confirmed and underpinned WTI crude back above USD 70/bbl. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said US is willing to work with China, strengthen cooperation and properly deal with trade problems.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Equity futures started off on the backfoot as markets awaited Trump&rsquo;s decision on the nuclear deal, but mixed source reports resulted in choppy trade until it was confirmed Trump is to pull out of the deal, resulting in a slightly risk off tone. However, this changed heading into the close where some of the earlier losses were pared back.&nbsp; Sector specifics, utilities underperformed following a poor earnings report from Aes (AES) who reported a softer than expected revenue. Telecoms also underperformed in Tuesday trade following earnings from Dish (DISH) where revenue fell short, and the co. saw a net decline of roughly 94,000 Pay TV customers, and its average monthly subscriber rate for Dish TV was at 1.47%, lower than the 1.92% for Q1 of 2017. M&amp;A news today returned to Shire (SHPG) and Takeda (4502 JT) as Shire agreed to be purchased for GBP 46bln (USD 62.4bln), putting an end to the takeover battle between the two.

SPX -0.03% at 2671, NDX -0.09% at 6815, DJI +0.01% at 24360.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were lower on Tuesday with most of the action concentrated in the front end and belly of the curve. The 5yr yield was up by c.3bps, the 2yr and 10yr yields were higher by c.2bps. The Treasury auctioned USD 31bln in 3yr notes with a tail of 0.1bps. The yield came in at 2.664%, the highest since May 2007. Dealers were left with the largest proportion of the issuance at 42.2%, well above the 6-auction average. Directs were awarded 12.3% and indirect 14.6%, the smallest portion since July 2016. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 5+ ticks lower at 119-16+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;</strong>Equities flat, Treasuries lower, DXY higher, Crude volatile.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>* REAR-VIEW:</strong>&nbsp;Trumps pulls out from Iran nuclear deal</li>\r\n  <li><strong>* AHEAD:&nbsp;</strong>US PPI,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Fed&rsquo;s Bostic to speak<strong>,&nbsp;e</strong>arnings from UCG IM, DTE GY, FOXA, BKNG.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:&nbsp;</strong>US President Trump confirmed the US is to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal with the &#39;highest level&#39; of sanctions to be imposed on Iran.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>After criticising<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the deal, noting it should never have been made<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>Trump said to be ready, willing and able to renegotiate an agreement with Iran. In response, France, Germany and the UK released a joint statement saying they regret the US decision. The first response from Iran came from the country&rsquo;s leader Rouhani who argued Iran is committed to its own obligations whilst the US is not. Rouhani added that from now on, the Iran deal is between Iran and five countries, namely UK, Germany, France, Russia and China, and he is ready to resume its nuclear work following talks with EU members of the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FED SPEAK: Fed&rsquo;s Chair Powell</strong>&nbsp;noted the market is &quot;reasonably well aligned&quot; with the Fed dot plot, adds markets should not be surprised with the Fed&#39;s actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*ECB SPEAK: ECB&rsquo;s Vasiliauskas&nbsp;</strong>said ending QE in December is a realistic scenario and there is no reason to dramatise the recent economic slowdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.03% at 2671, NDX -0.09% at&nbsp;6815, DJI +0.01% at&nbsp;24360.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS:</strong>&nbsp;Cons Cyclicals: -0.46%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.46%, Energy: +0.78%, Financials: +0.69%, Health Care: -0.78%, Industrials: +0.72%, Materials: -0.26%, Technology: +0.29%, Telecoms: -1.29%, Utilities: -2.52%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk513575098\">US Equity futures started off on the backfoot as markets awaited Trump&rsquo;s decision on the nuclear deal, but mixed source reports resulted in choppy trade until it was confirmed Trump is to pull out of the deal, resulting in a slightly risk off tone. However, this changed heading into the close where some of the earlier losses were pared back. &nbsp;Sector specifics, utilities underperformed following a poor earnings report from Aes (AES) who reported a softer than expected revenue. Telecoms also underperformed in Tuesday trade following earnings from Dish (DISH) where revenue fell short, and the co. saw a net decline of roughly 94,000 Pay TV customers, and its average monthly subscriber rate for Dish TV was at 1.47%, lower than the 1.92% for Q1 of 2017. M&amp;A news today returned to Shire (SHPG) and Takeda (4502 JT) as Shire agreed to be purchased for GBP 46bln (USD 62.4bln), putting an end to the takeover battle between the two. Focus also lied on Comcast (CMCSA) who are said to be arranging an all cash offer for 21st Century Fox&rsquo;s (FOXA) assets for USD 60bln. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI crude futures settle lower by USD 1.67 at USD 69.06; Brent Crude futures settle lower by USD 1.32 at USD 74.85.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude prices pared back losses after Trump announced the US is pulling out of the nuclear deal, with new sanctions to be imposed on Iran in 180 days, however, the major benchmarks still settled lower.&nbsp;Oil traded choppy ahead of the announcement, as media reports kept refuting each other on whether the US would leave the deal or&nbsp;not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the boost in later trade, prices were down for the day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldman Sachs noted beforehand that if US were to pull out of the Iran deal and secondary sanctions are reintroduced, there may not be an immediate impact on the oil market and potentially not as large as the 1mln bpd loss of exports in the period of 2012-2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES:&nbsp;US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 5+ ticks lower at 119-16+.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were lower on Tuesday with most of the action concentrated in the front end and belly of the curve. The 5yr yield was up by c.3bps, the 2yr and 10yr yields were higher by c.2bps. The Treasury auctioned USD 31bln in 3yr notes with a tail of 0.1bps. The yield came in at 2.664%, the highest since May 2007. Dealers were left with the largest proportion of the issuance at 42.2%, well above the 6-auction average. Directs were awarded 12.3% and indirect 14.6%, the smallest portion since July 2016.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FOREX:</strong>&nbsp;*<strong>DXY:</strong>&nbsp;The index has now advanced past the 93.000 marker to a new high for the year to date around 93.280 amidst broad USD gains, and with the next bullish objective near 93.500 (a key Fib at 93.522 to be precise).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*CHF, JPY:</strong>&nbsp;As noted, relatively contained losses vs the USD with 1.0000-50 and 108.85-109.30 respective ranges, while both currencies sharply outperformed an increasingly weak EUR as the crosses recoiled to sub-1.1900 and 130.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*GBP:</strong>&nbsp;The Pound derived a degree of underlying support from M&amp;A flows as Shire finally warmed to Takeda&rsquo;s takeover terms, with GBPJPY briefly over 148.00 and Cable close to 1.3600 when news of a deal broke, but the former currently around 147.50 and latter nearer 1.3550, though EURGBP remains under 0.8800 on the aforementioned more pronounced single currency selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*EUR, CAD:</strong>&nbsp;Both around 0.65% adrift vs the USD, with EURUSD down to fresh 2018 lows under 1.1850 having breached a key Fib (1.1876), but then rebounded above that level finding support around the 1.1860 area. USDCAD hit new multi-week highs above 1.2950 to reach 1.2985 amidst more NAFTA talk highlighting progress, but little sign of a deal, and following weaker than forecast Canadian housing starts data. Next resistance on the radar end of Q1 peaks circa 1.3000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*AUD, NZD:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ending Tuesday&rsquo;s session as the biggest G10 decliners vs the USD amidst broad falls in commodity prices (which also weighed on the Loonie of course), and with the AUD also a victim of data disappointment (retail sales missed consensus) and some fiscal angst surrounding the annual budget (as tax cuts and infrastructure spending could hamper predictions for an earlier surplus than previously expected if based on too optimistic basic material and other forecasts). AUDUSD has lost more ground below 0.7500 and filled bids at 0.7470 on the way down to a 0.7435 low, while the Kiwi is only just holding above 0.6950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

No sign of any apprehension or much reluctance to keeping buying the Greenback ahead of US President Trump&rsquo;s decision whether to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord or not, although the traditional safe-haven currencies did buck the overall underperforming trend for a while before yielding to the almost insatiable Dollar bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF/JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted, relatively contained losses vs the Usd with 1.0000-50 and 108.85-109.30 respective ranges, while both currencies sharply outperformed an increasingly weak Eur as the crosses recoiled to sub-1.1900 and 130.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound derived a degree of underlying support from M&amp;A flows as Shire finally warmed to Takeda&rsquo;s takeover terms, with Gbp/Jpy briefly over 148.00 and Cable close to 1.3600 when news of a deal broke, but the former currently around 147.50 and latter nearer 1.3500, though Eur/Gbp remains under 0.8800 on the aforementioned more pronounced single currency selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both around 0.65% adrift vs the Usd, with Eur/Usd down to fresh 2018 lows under 1.1850 having breached a key Fib (1.1876) and bears now targeting the 1.1820 area, while Usd/Cad hit new multi-week highs above 1.2900 to reach 1.2985 amidst more NAFTA talk highlighting progress, but little sign of a deal, and following weaker than forecast Canadian housing starts data. Next resistance on the radar end of Q1 peaks circa 1.3000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Tuesday&rsquo;s (EU) session as the biggest G10 decliners vs the Usd amidst broad falls in commodity prices (which also weighed on the Loonie of course), and with the Aud also a victim of data disappointment (retail sales missed consensus) and some fiscal angst surrounding the annual budget (as tax cuts and infrastructure spending could hamper predictions for an earlier surplus than previously expected if based on too optimistic basic material and other forecasts). Aud/Usd has lost more ground below 0.7500 and filled bids at 0.7470 on the way down to a 0.7435 low, while the Kiwi is only just holding above 0.6950.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) shrugged off a firmer currency and conformed to the overall risk appetite, while Hang Seng (+1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) outperformed with healthcare and financials front running the gains despite further liquidity inaction and another consecutive net neutral position by the PBoC.

This comes despite reports yesterday that UK, France and Germany are close to a package deal to attempt to persuade US President Trump not to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, according to a senior diplomat. US President Trump is said to be leaning towards dropping the Iran agreement and re-imposing sanctions according to diplomats familiar with discussions, although reports added it is unclear if he would moderate a move to scrap the Iran nuclear deal by permitting EU countries to proceed with economic ties with Iran without being penalized by US. (Newswires/NYT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell (neutral) says the market is &quot;reasonably well aligned&quot; with the Fed dot plot, adds markets should not be surprised with the Fed&#39;s actions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, neutral) said the base case remains at 3 hikes total for this year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank minutes: Several members expressed concerns about development of inflation going forward, as well as pointing out that it is important the Krona exchange rate develops in a manner compatible with inflation stabilizing close to the target. Riksbank&rsquo;s Skingsley added that he is likely to back a hike in either October or December, and that as the Krona is expected to strengthen again over the forecast period, the effects of inflation can be seen as moderate. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank&#39;s Jansson says inflation does not have to be exactly 2%, but near it, so a confidence problem doesn&#39;t happen, and that the SEK is clearly weaker than they expected, and that inflation needs continued support by monetary policy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior White House official stated that President Trump will request USD 15bln in spending reductions from Congress which will be focused on money not being utilized.&nbsp; Furthermore, the official stated that cuts will include USD 7bln from the Children&#39;s health insurance program and that another large rescission package will be proposed later in the year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is reportedly facing renewed turmoil regarding Brexit options and is said to be under pressure from MPs across different parties to accept EEA membership or risk defeat in Commons. (Guardian) Furthermore, Dozens of Eurosceptic MPs in the UK&#39;s Conservative party are expected to express their frustration today regarding a lack of direction for the UK&#39;s future post-Brexit. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stoxx 600 is down 0.5% amid broad risk aversion ahead of the US decision on the Iranian nuclear deal later in the day. The FTSE (+0.1%) currently outperforming as UK traders return to their desks post-bank holiday, as well as being given a boost by Takeda&rsquo;s GBP 46bln approach for Shire (+4.1%). FTSEMIB (-2.2%) is the worst performer due to election concerns, with the DAX (-0.4%) also underperforming, following an earnings miss for Deutsche Post (-6.1%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A relatively sharp pull-back in crude prices amidst speculation that the UK, France and Germany are on the cusp of a plan that might tempt US President Trump not to abandon the Iranian nuclear treaty, plus ongoing NAFTA uncertainty as negotiations resume are weighing heavily on the Loonie, as Usd/Cad spikes through the top of recent ranges and more convincingly above 1.2900. In fact, the pair is testing the water above 1.2950 at fresh multi-week peaks, with early March highs around 1.3000 next on the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending gains vs the Eur (to sub-10.5000 levels) and Nok (also undermined by the retreat in oil) in wake of Riksbank minutes reaffirming year end rate hike guidance and the broad Swedish Central Bank view that the Krona will rally over time after a temporary period of weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firming up again after another bout of consolidation, with the Dollar bid against all major counterparts bar the Jpy and Chf. The index has now printed above 93.000 vs 92.974 at best yesterday, with little reaction to latest comments from Fed Chair Powell who merely stressed the need for clear policy communication to avoid market turbulence, He also claimed that EMs can cope with US normalisation, but the Try for one continues to struggle at new record lows vs the Greenback circa 4.3000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both showing relative resilience vs the Usd around 109.00 and within a 1.0000-50 band respectively, with perhaps some underlying safe-haven demand evident ahead of Trump&rsquo;s eagerly-awaited Iran deal or no deal announcement (14.00ET/19.00BST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both mildly softer vs the Usd below big figures (0.7000 and 1.1900), with the Kiwi slightly depressed by softer NZ inflation expectations and the single currency still succumbing to weaker Eurozone data and position paring from a record long base. Eur/Usd has breached its 250 WMA around 1.1896, while on the upside decent option expiries (1.5 bn) at 1.1950 are keeping a lid on prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volatile as UK participants return from May Day to confirmation of a mega M&amp;A deal that lifted Cable towards 1.3600 at one stage, and Gbp/Jpy up through 148.00, but the Pound now beating a retreat to retest 1.3500 vs the Usd and back below its 200 DMA (1.3542).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another laggard on broadly weaker commodity prices and softer than forecast Aussie retail sales data overnight, with Aud/Usd back under the 0.7500 mark and Aud/Nzd losing 1.0700+ status again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts got a brief extra lift from much a weaker than expected Halifax hpi to marginally extend their Liffe peak to 122.69 (+13 ticks), but have been dragged back since with core bond peers (to a new low foe the session at 122.43) as Bunds probed below the first technical support area (159.20-18) to 159.10 (-21 ticks). 159.07-02 is the next downside chart objective, though the 10 year German benchmark has bounced more recently as the political pressure mounts on Italian BTPs to more than a full point at 138.06 vs Monday&rsquo;s 139.38 close. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are straddling yesterday&rsquo;s settlement levels amidst a mildly flatter curve bias ahead of the 1st leg of this week&rsquo;s quarterly refunding - $31 bn 3 year notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are mixed as WTI crude futures continue to retrace from three-and-a-half year highs, back below the USD 70.00/bbl level following reports that European powers are close to a package deal to try and persuade Trump not to withdraw from the Iran deal. That said, later reports suggest that Trump may be inclined to dropping out of the agreement when he announces his decision at 1900BST today, a move that can disrupt global oil supply. &ldquo;Iran&rsquo;s exports could be cut by 200K bpd to 300K bpd&rdquo; says RBC if the US restores sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold prices have been choppy, tracking fluctuations in the USD, while 3-month copper on the LME was up 0.3% and zinc climbed 1.5% on expectations for strong Chinese data in the coming weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran has set June&#39;s light crude official price for Asia USD 2/bbl above Oman/Dubai quotes.

        "content": "<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stoxx 600 is currently down 0.13% amid broad risk aversion ahead of the US decision on the Iranian nuclear deal later in the day. The FTSE (+0.24%) currently outperforming as UK traders return to their desks post-bank holiday, as well as being given a boost by Takeda&rsquo;s GBP 46bln approach for Shire (+3.7%). FTSEMIB (-1.6%) is the worst performer due to election concerns, with the DAX (-0.38%) also underperforming, following an earnings miss for Deutsche Post (-7.1%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are mixed as WTI crude futures continue to retrace from three-and-a-half year highs, back below the USD 70.00/bbl level following reports that European powers are close to a package deal to try and persuade Trump not to withdraw from the Iran deal. That said, later reports suggest that Trump may be inclined to dropping out of the agreement when he announces his decision at 1900BST today, a move that can disrupt global oil supply. &ldquo;Iran&rsquo;s exports could be cut by 200K bpd to 300K bpd&rdquo; says RBC if the US restores sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold prices have been choppy, tracking fluctuations in the USD, while 3-month copper on the LME was up 0.3% and zinc climbed 1.5% on expectations for strong Chinese data in the coming weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A relatively sharp pull-back in crude prices amidst speculation that the UK, France and Germany are on the cusp of a plan that might tempt US President Trump not to abandon the Iranian nuclear treaty, plus ongoing NAFTA uncertainty as negotiations resume are weighing heavily on the Loonie, as Usd/Cad spikes through the top of recent ranges and more convincingly above 1.2900. In fact, the pair is testing the water above 1.2950 at fresh multi-week peaks, with early March highs around 1.3000 next on the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending gains vs the Eur (to sub-10.5000 levels) and Nok (also undermined by the retreat in oil) in wake of Riksbank minutes reaffirming year end rate hike guidance and the broad Swedish Central Bank view that the Krona will rally over time after a temporary period of weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firming up again after another bout of consolidation, with the Dollar bid against all major counterparts bar the Jpy and Chf. The index has now printed above 93.000 vs 92.974 at best yesterday, with little reaction to latest comments from Fed Chair Powell who merely stressed the need for clear policy communication to avoid market turbulence, He also claimed that EMs can cope with US normalisation, but the Try for one continues to struggle at new record lows vs the Greenback circa 4.3000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both showing relative resilience vs the Usd around 109.00 and within a 1.0000-50 band respectively, with perhaps some underlying safe-haven demand evident ahead of Trump&rsquo;s eagerly-awaited Iran deal or no deal announcement (14.00ET/19.00BST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both mildly softer vs the Usd below big figures (0.7000 and 1.1900), with the Kiwi slightly depressed by softer NZ inflation expectations and the single currency still succumbing to weaker Eurozone data and position paring from a record long base. Eur/Usd has breached its 250 WMA around 1.1896, while on the upside decent option expiries (1.5 bn) at 1.1950 are keeping a lid on prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volatile as UK participants return from May Day to confirmation of a mega M&amp;A deal that lifted Cable towards 1.3600 at one stage, and Gbp/Jpy up through 148.00, but the Pound now beating a retreat to retest 1.3500 vs the Usd and back below its 200 DMA (1.3542).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another laggard on broadly weaker commodity prices and softer than forecast Aussie retail sales data overnight, with Aud/Usd back under the 0.7500 mark and Aud/Nzd losing 1.0700+ status again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts got a brief extra lift from much a weaker than expected Halifax hpi to marginally extend their Liffe peak to 122.69 (+13 ticks), but have been dragged back since with core bond peers as Bunds probed below the first technical support area (159.20-18) to 159.13 (-18 ticks). 159.07-02 is the next downside chart objective, though the 10 year German benchmark has bounced more recently as the political pressure mounts on Italian BTPs to more than a full point at 138.18 vs Monday&rsquo;s 139.38 close.

In fact, the pair is testing the water above 1.2950 at fresh multi-week peaks, with early March highs around 1.3000 next on the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending gains vs the Eur (to sub-10.5000 levels) and Nok (also undermined by the retreat in oil) in wake of Riksbank minutes reaffirming year end rate hike guidance and the broad Swedish Central Bank view that the Krona will rally over time after a temporary period of weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firming up again after another bout of consolidation off new ytd highs, with the Dollar bid against all major counterparts bar the Jpy and Chf. The index is nudging up towards 92.900 vs 92.974 at best yesterday, with little reaction to latest comments from Fed Chair Powell who merely stressed the need for clear policy communication to avoid market turbulence, He also claimed that EMs can cope with US normalisation, but the Try for one continues to struggle at new record lows vs the Greenback circa 4.2900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/CHF </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both showing relative resilience vs the Usd around 109.00 and within a 1.0000-50 band respectively, with perhaps some underlying safe-haven demand evident ahead of Trump&rsquo;s eagerly-awaited Iran deal or no deal announcement (14.00ET/19.00BST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD/EUR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both mildly softer vs the Usd around big figures (0.7000 and 1.1900), with the Kiwi slightly depressed by softer NZ inflation expectations and the single currency still succumbing to weaker Eurozone data and position paring from a record long base. Eur/Usd has tested its 250 WMA around 1.1896, while on the upside decent option expiries (1.5 bn) at 1.1950 are keeping a lid on prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volatile as UK participants return from May Day to confirmation of a mega M&amp;A deal that lifted Cable towards 1.3600 at one stage, and Gbp/Jpy up through 148.00, but the Pound now beating a retreat to retest 1.3500 vs the Usd and back below its 200 DMA (1.3542).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another laggard on broadly weaker commodity prices and softer than forecast Aussie retail sales data overnight, with Aud/Usd back under the 0.7500 mark and Aud/Nzd losing 1.0700+ status again.</p>\r\n",

However, this is not new guidance given that most expect the ECB to provide details of the wind down from Eur30 bn monthly purchases that runs until the end of September by mid-2018. Moreover, for Bunds in particular the ECB has stated that more German debt will be bought in the short term to balance sub-quota PSPP activity recently, so the pull-back in early Eurex trade is more consolidative within a 159.18-28 range vs Monday&rsquo;s 159.31 close.

Finally, 10yr JGBs were lacklustre as focus centred on riskier assets, while the 10yr JGB auction also failed to impact prices with the results somewhat inconclusive in which the b/c printed higher than previous and accepted prices declined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY initially traded choppy although has since rebounded off its lows which has resulted to a capitulation in EUR/USD and GBP/USD. Elsewhere, USD/JPY oscillated around 109.00 and NZD weakened on reduced inflation expectations, while AUD was pressured following disappointing Retail Sales data and after mixed Chinese trade data failed to support prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed in which WTI crude futures retreated back below the USD 70.00/bbl level following reports that European powers were close to a package deal to try and persuade Trump not to withdraw from the Iran deal. Furthermore, although there were reports that Trump is said to be inclined to dropping out of the Iran nuclear agreement when he announces his decision later today, it was also suggested that the prospect of some moderation by Trump cannot fully be dismissed. Elsewhere, gold prices were choppy and ultimately declined as the greenback recovered, while copper fared better than its peers on the positive risk appetite and outperformance in China.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) is positive with gains led by strength in the largest weighted financials sector and amid some optimism ahead of the federal budget announcement which is expected to include tax cuts for low and middle-income earners, as well as billions for infrastructure spending. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) shrugs off a firmer currency and conforms to the overall risk appetite, while Hang Seng (+1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) outperform with healthcare and financials front running the gains despite further inaction and another consecutive net neutral position by the PBoC .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY trades choppy although has rebounded off its lows which has resulted to a capitulation in EUR/USD and GBP/USD. Elsewhere, USD/JPY oscillates around 109.00, while AUD/USD pared initial gains and was pressured on disappointing Retail Sales data and with focus for the currency shifting to the incoming Chinese Trade Data and budget announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lacklustre amid the appetite for riskier assets and with participants also side-lined ahead of a 10yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
