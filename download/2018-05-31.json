(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Juncker said tariffs are unacceptable and retaliatory measures will be installed within hours, while the EU is to also trigger dispute settlement case at WTO. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo announced it would be difficult to reach a NAFTA deal before the Mexican election following the US tariff decision but added that talks are still continuing. Guajardo also commented he does not expect a trade war after US tariffs on steel and aluminium and that tariffs affect USD 4bln of trade between Mexico and the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada PM Trudeau said he was told a five-year sunset clause was a pre-condition for a meeting with President Trump to finalise NAFTA. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Trade Minister Fox said the UK is not ruling out counter measures after the US imposed steel and aluminium tariffs. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China will actively expand imports, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bank of England Governor Carney said UK real wages have not risen in a decade. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&rsquo;s 5SM and League completed an accord on a coalition government and Italy&#39;s President Mattarella later gave Conte the mandate to form a 5 Star/League coalition government, which Conte accepted and is to be sworn in on Friday. Italy&#39;s Conte said M5S leader Di Maio to be Labour and Industry Minister and Deputy PM, League leader Salvini is to be Interior Minister and Deputy PM, while Tria was nominated as Finance Minister and Milanesi as Foreign Minister. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU CPI Flash YY (May) 1.9% vs. Exp. 1.6% (Prev. 1.2%). (Newswires)<br />EU Unemployment Rate (Apr) 8.5% vs. Exp. 8.4% (Prev. 8.5%, Rev. 8.6%)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian GDP MM (Mar) 0.3% vs. Exp. 0.2% (Prev. 0.4%). (Newswires)<br />Canadian GDP QQ Annualized (Q1) 1.3% vs. Exp. 1.8% (Prev. 1.7%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoC&#39;s Leduc reiterated that developments since April reinforce the view of higher interest rates to keep inflation on target and stated that he favours a gradual approach to policy adjustments guided by data. Furthermore, Leduc also commented that the economy is close to full potential, while the labour market is improving and wages are rising. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks (25 May) -3.620M vs. Exp. -0.525M (Prev. 5.778M).

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korean leader Kim said their will for denuclearization of the peninsula is unchanged, consistent and fixed, while he hopes that North Korea and US ties will be solved step by step and added North Korea has agreed to a summit with Russia. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Brainard (Voter, Dove) said gradual rate hikes appropriate but stated the Fed is alert to emerging market risks and ready to adjust policy as needed. Brainard also commented that above trend growth and stimulus calls for gradual hikes, while she added that global financial market stress and possible channels to US are important consideration for monetary policy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Mester (Voter, Hawk) suggested rates should be raised gradually and noted wages are rising which will be reflected in data soon. Furthermore, Mester does not see inflation spiking higher and noted Italy has not changed the view of economic fundamentals in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Personal Income MM (Apr) 0.3% vs. Exp. 0.3% (Prev. 0.3%, Rev. 0.2%). (Newswires)<br />US Consumption, Adjusted MM (Apr) 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.40% (Prev. 0.40%, Rev. 0.5%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures reversed the overnight gains with downside seen as European traders got to their desks, and the Emini S&amp;P futures started to slide as markets awaited US Commerce Secretary Ross announcements on tariffs. Following the announcement, the ES dropped, and despite positive developments in Italy, US trade partners announcing they would take counter measures kept risk assets on the defensive; however, the key 2700 level in ES held. In stock specifics: General Motors (GM) supported the SPX following a USD 2.2bln investment from Softbank into GM&rsquo;s cruise self-driving unit, the stock saw intraday highs of close to 13%. Two names hampering the SPX today, Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) following weak earnings reports from both. SPX -0.66% at 2705, NDX -0.05% at 6972, DJI -1.01% at 24418.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury futures were mixed on Thursday, though the general bias was towards lower yields, supported by trade war fears after the US slapped tariffs on EU, Canada and Mexico. The complex saw a moderate sell off a bit later in the session after Italy agreed on a government deal but then paired back those losses as focus moved on Spain. Volume was thin in the front contract as open interest shifted into September contract. Most of the price action was concentrated in the belly and long ends of the curve, where yields were lower by c.1bps; 2s10s and 2s30s where narrower by c.3bps with the former at the flattest level in nearly 11 years. US 10yr T-Notes futures (Sep 2018) settled 45 ticks higher at 120-14.</p>\r\n",

The two parties have chosen Conte for the PM position; an official reported the deal also sees Savona as the EU Affairs Minister, and academic Tria as the Finance Minister, Milanesi as Foreign Minister and La Stampa&nbsp;&nbsp;reported Trenta as Defence Minister. M5S leader Di Maio will take the Industry Minister position and League&#39;s leader Salvini the Interior Minister role &ndash; both Salvini and Di Maio will reportedly take Deputy Premier roles, too. PM-designate Conte has confirmed these positions in later trade. After the reports, Italy&rsquo;s previous PM-designate Cottarelli gave up on his mandate to form a government. ANSA suggested the new government will be sworn in on Friday afternoon, and a government confidence vote is to take place next Monday or Tuesday. Over in&nbsp;Spain, the Spanish opposition is seen close to securing votes necessary to remove current PM Rajoy, and the PP party said to most likely see a defeat in the no confidence vote on Friday. In later trade, Citizens party leader Rivera called on Rajoy to resign whilst PSOE&rsquo;s Sanchez says he is willing to negotiate a date for Spanish election. Sources also reported Catalan lawmakers are to support the Socialists on a vote of no confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*TRADE WARS:&nbsp;</strong>US Commerce Secretary Ross announced the EU, Canada and Mexico will face 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium&nbsp;from&nbsp;midnight on Thursday. Ross explained that the decision was made for Canada and Mexico because the NAFTA negotiations took too long. In response, EU&#39;s Juncker said tariffs are unacceptable and retaliatory measure will be taken, with the EU triggering a dispute settlement case at the WTO. Mexico also responded and is to retaliate by imposing tariffs on flat steel, some pork and other foods with Mexico&#39;s Economy Minister Guajardo to publish tariff targets as soon as next week. He does not expect a trade war after US tariffs on steel and aluminium. UK Trade Minister Fox made clear the UK is not ruling out counter measures. German Chancellor Merkel said reciprocity is needed, adding any response to US tariffs must be smart and determined. Elsewhere, US President Trump told French President Macron that he would block German premium cars from entering the US market, according to German magazine Wirtschaftswoche.&nbsp;SAFE reported that China will actively expand imports. Earlier in the session, the Chinese finance ministry said to lower import tariffs on some consumer products from favoured nations as of July 1st, average tariff rate will fall to 6.9% from 15.7% on 1,449 products. Finally, Canada and Mexico will continue to negotiate with US on NAFTA. Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo announced it would be difficult to reach a NAFTA deal before the Mexican election, following the US tariff decision but does say talks are still continuing. Canada PM Trudeau added he was told a five-year sunset clause was a pre-condition for a meeting with President Trump to finalise NAFTA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*GEOPOLITICS:</strong>&nbsp;US President Trump said there is &lsquo;a very good chance&rsquo; a denuclearisation deal with North Korea will require more than one meeting, adding that it will cover missiles. US Secretary of State Pompeo said a lot of work remains to be done with North Korea, but he was positive; elsewhere, he avoided outlining what an agreement with North Korea might eventually look like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FED SPEAK:</strong> Fed&#39;s Brainard (voter, dovish)&nbsp;&nbsp;expects US policy to be normalised gradually, and for the Fed to shift to a &lsquo;modestly beyond neutral&rsquo; policy setting. She added the Fed needs to adjust &lsquo;stale&rsquo; language around accommodative policy in its statement&nbsp;and she downplayed concerns of yield curve inversions. Elsewhere, above trend growth and stimulus calls for gradual hikes. Slack has diminished but there may be still some left. Brainard also dedicated some time towards events in Europe, saying financial conditions have deteriorated due to Italian political uncertainty; global financial market stress and possible channels to US are two important consideration for US monetary policy.&nbsp;Fed&#39;s Quarles&nbsp;(voter, neutral)&nbsp;said trade measures have not had a macro effect yet, and his near-term outlook has not changed.&nbsp;Fed&rsquo;s Mester (voter, hawk)&nbsp;suggested rates should be raised gradually and noted Italy has not changed the view of economic fundamentals in the US. Wages are rising and that it will be reflected in data soon, but does not see inflation spiking higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*BOC SPEAK:&nbsp;</strong>BoC&#39;s&nbsp;Leduc&nbsp;repeated the BoC line that developments since April reinforce the view of higher interest rates to keep inflation on target and reiterated the BoC statement that trade policy uncertainty as a factor limiting business investment. He noted the economy is close to full potential, the labour market is improving and wages are rising. He favours a gradual approach to policy adjustments guided by data adding there is a lot of economic data to be seen before the July decision, and that the decisions are informed by data but the Q1 GDP reassures them that economy is travelling in the right direction. BoC&rsquo;s&nbsp;Poloz&nbsp;said global growth was broad-based and synchronised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*DATA: </strong>US personal consumption&nbsp;rose to 0.6%, in April above the 0.4% consensus. US Core PCE Price Index YY was inline at 1.80% whilst MM ticked slightly up at 0.2%. Capital Economics still anticipates PCE Inflation to rise above 2.0% in the incoming months which supports the Fed policy goal of at least three rate hikes this year, with the first hike coming in June. The strong consumption figures indicate a solid start to Q2, analysts said, though the cold weather dictated higher spending in energy and utility services. Some argue that gains are unlikely to be sustained as weather improves, with utility expected to drop sharply. Nonetheless, analysts at Pantheon see the Core PCE deflator hitting 2% in July and move further up in August. Elsewhere,&nbsp;Canada GDP&nbsp;moderated slightly in Q1 coming in at 1.3%, making a BoC July hike less certain, after this week&rsquo;s upbeat policy statement. Looking at the components, household consumption rose by 1.1% whilst residential investment dropped by 7.2%. The housing market continued to weaken in April and looks unlikely to pick up as mortgage rates remain elevated. Similarly, uncertainty around NAFTA and the fresh tariffs imposed by the US will weigh on the economy, the BoC and analysts say. On the flip side, investment showed a 10.9% growth, flying in the face of some of those concerns. However, given that GDP has been slowing down for three consecutive quarters, it does not seem interest rates hike are necessary, analyst at Capital Economics said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*EQUITIES: </strong>SPX -0.66% at 2705, NDX -0.05% at 6972, DJI -1.01% at 24418.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS:&nbsp;Cons Cyclicals -0.47%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -1.65%, Energy: -0.75%, Financials: -0.69%, Health Care: -0.86%, Industrials: -1.24%, Materials: -0.67%, Telecom: -1.10%, Tech: +0.43%, Utilities: +0.18%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures&nbsp;traded higher overnight, following on from yesterday&rsquo;s rebound where it consolidated around the recently watched 2730 level. There was downside as European traders got to their desks, and the Emini S&amp;P futures started to slide as markets awaited US Commerce Secretary Ross announcements on tariffs. Following the announcement, the ES dropped, and despite positive developments in Italy, US trade partners announcing they would take counter measures kept risk assets on the defensive; however, the key 2700 level in ES held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stock specifics:&nbsp;General Motors (GM) supported the SPX following a USD 2.2bln investment from Softbank into GM&rsquo;s cruise self-driving unit, the stock saw intraday highs of close to 13%. Two names hampering the SPX today, Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) following weak earnings reports from both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*CRUDE: </strong>WTI futures settle down USD 1.17 at USD 67.04/bbl; Brent futures settle higher by USD 0.09 at USD 77.59/bbl.&nbsp;A cocktail of bearish factors engulfed the crude complex in early trade: the API data released on Wednesday showed a surprise build in inventories, the dollar strength was a headwind, unions in Brazil called for workers to cancel industrial action, and Shell restarted a platform in the Gulf of Mexico a full year ahead of schedule, Russia&rsquo;s deputy oil minister said it could boost production levels by 300k BPD within months. Add to that a weak global risk narrative &ndash; after the US announced tariffs on Mexico, Canada and the EU, and European political risks remained in focus &ndash; and crude was offered as US traders got to their desks. There was some stabilisation around 67.00 in WTI. There was only a very limited uptick to crude prices after weekly DOE inventory data reported crude bullish/products bearish data: stocks drew down by a whopping 3.62mln barrels (exp. -0.5mln) in the week, Cushing stocks drew 556k barrels (Exp -1.123mln), gasoline built 534k (exp -1.368mlnm) and distillates built 634k (exp -1.25mln). However, US crude production continues to tick higher (+0.4% to 10.769mln BPD), keeping a lid on WTI upside. And after the 67.00 handle was given, lows below 66.50 were printed. Analysts at Citi also noted that on the Gulf Coast (PADD3) stocks dropped by 3.1mln, which suggests that fears that supply constraints may see builds in the Permian basin were pushed back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FIXED INCOME: </strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures (Sep 2018) settled 45 ticks higher at 120-14.&nbsp;Treasury futures were mixed on Thursday, though the general bias was towards lower yields, supported by trade war fears after the US slapped tariffs on EU, Canada and Mexico.&nbsp;The complex saw a moderate sell off a bit later in the session after Italy agreed on a government deal but then paired back those losses as focus moved on Spain.&nbsp;Volume was thin in the front contract as open interest shifted into September contract. Most of the price action was concentrated in the belly and long ends of the curve, where yields were lower by c.1bps; 2s10s and 2s30s where narrower by c.3bps with the former at the flattest level in nearly 11 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FOREX:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;USD:&nbsp;A turnaround in overall risk sentiment and the Greenback&rsquo;s fortunes as a result, with losses pared and/or reversed in wake of the imposition of aluminium and steel taxes vs the EU, Canada and Mexico, with almost immediate effect. The DXY duly bounced from sub-94.000 lows as Dollar/Major and EMs especially reversed course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD:&nbsp;Literally from hero to zero for the Loonie as considerably weaker than forecast Canadian GDP (annualised y/y measure) undermined and belied the BoC&rsquo;s more upbeat post-policy meeting growth assessment yesterday, and the US also raised the bar for a NAFTA deal by declaring no end date for negotiations. USDCAD rebounded sharply to circa 1.2975 from just above 1.2800 as a result, and consolidated around just above 1.2950, while USDMXN tested 20.000 as the PESO also felt the full force of US tariff angst, and Mexico announced retaliatory action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY, CHF:&nbsp;Both back in demand on safe-haven grounds as global trade war tensions ramped up again in early trade, with USDJPY pulling back further from 109.00, while the Franc tested 0.9850 and above 1.1500 vs the Eur. There was some deflation in the haven bid after positive news on the Italian front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD, AUD:&nbsp;Resilient in the face of the USD recovery, with the Kiwi clinging on to the 0.7000 handle on favourable cross winds as Aud/Usd remained capped by 0.7600 and hefty option expiry interest above ahead of the NY cut, and Aud/Nzd stayed close to 1.0800. AUD struggled to keep up with the Kiwi;s pace after weak CAPEX data overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR, GBP: Ended the Thursday&rsquo;s EU session narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, but the single currency well off 1.1700+ peaks on firmer and essentially in line with ECB target Eurozone inflation plus less political angst on the Italian front. EURUSD is back below its 10 DMA (1.1690) and tested support around 1.1650 as negotiations in Rome continued, but there was upside following positive developments in Italy, though the 1.17 level remained a struggle ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s confidence vote in Spain. Cable relatively resilient around 1.3300, albeit down from peaks near 1.3350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*COMING-UP: </strong>US nonfarm payrolls data will be released at 1330 BST/0830 EDT on 1 June 2018. Non-farm Payrolls: (Exp. 188k, Prev. 164k).&nbsp;Last month, the US added 164k nonfarm payrolls, easing from the recent average pace; over the last 6-months, payroll growth has averaged 198k, slightly firmer than the 12-month pace of 190k. The 3-month average has been easing over the last quarter, and is currently running at a clip of 208k. For full preview&nbsp;click here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

There was only a very limited uptick to crude prices after weekly DOE inventory data reported crude bullish/products bearish data: stocks drew down by a whopping 3.62mln barrels (exp. -0.5mln) in the week, Cushing stocks drew 556k barrels (Exp -1.123mln), gasoline built 534k (exp -1.368mlnm) and distillates built 634k (exp -1.25mln). However, US crude production continues to tick higher (+0.4% to 10.769mln BPD), keeping a lid on WTI upside. And after the 67.00 handle was given, lows below 66.50 were printed. Analysts at Citi also noted that on the Gulf Coast (PADD3) stocks dropped by 3.1mln, which suggests that fears that supply constraints may see builds in the Permian basin were pushed back.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The DXY duly bounced from sub-94.000 lows as Dollar/Major and EMs especially reversed course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Literally from hero to zero for the Loonie as considerably weaker than forecast Canadian GDP (annualised y/y measure) undermined and belied the BoC&rsquo;s more upbeat post-policy meeting growth assessment yesterday, and the US also raised the bar for a NAFTA deal by declaring no end date for negotiations. Usd/Cad rebounded sharply to circa 1.2975 from just above 1.2800 as a result, and almost back to Wednesday&rsquo;s pre-BoC levels, while Usd/Mxn tested 20.000 as the PESO also felt the full force of US tariff angst, and Mexico announced retaliatory action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both back in demand on safe-haven grounds as global trade war tensions ramped up again, with Usd/Jpy pulling back further from 109.00 and below 108.50, while the Franc tested 0.9850 and retreated through 1.1500 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resilient in the face of the Usd recovery, with the Kiwi clinging on to the 0.7000 handle on favourable cross winds as Aud/Usd remained capped by 0.7600 and hefty option expiry interest above ahead of the NY cut, and Aud/Nzd stayed close to 1.0800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Thursday&rsquo;s EU session narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, but the single currency well off 1.1700+ peaks on firmer and essentially in line with ECB target Eurozone inflation plus less political angst on the Italian front. Eur/Usd is back below its 10 DMA (1.1690) and tested support around 1.1650 as negotiations in Rome continue and the countdown to Madrid&rsquo;s &lsquo;si&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; to PM Rajoy ticks down.

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.4%) conformed to the positivity with outperformance in mainland China after better than expected Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs in which the former data release printed an 8-month high. In addition, officials also did their part to help out with China to further cut import tariffs for consumer goods and will announce a new negative list which would ease investment restrictions on certain sectors, while the PBoC conducted a substantial daily net liquidity injection of CNY 180bln.

In other news, China Mofcom said that China will release a new negative list on foreign investment by June 30th at the latest, which will include measures to relax or drop restrictions on sectors including energy, resources and transportation.

(Wirtschaftswoche)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European stocks (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.3%) are largely tracking higher as the tension surrounding Italian politics cools further. The underperforming bourse is the DAX (-0.4%) which is being weighed upon by a possible US import ban on German autos. Large index constituents Daimler (-1.0%), Volkswagen (-1.9%) and BMW (-0.5%) all negative on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanish banks are seeing positivity as the no confidence vote debate in Spain begins (Santander +1.2% and Banco Bilbao +1.4%), with expectations set on the ousting of Spanish PM Rajoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstgroup collapsing to the bottom of the Stoxx 600 (-14.5%) after the resignation of their CEO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback is weaker across the board again, and partly due to gains in rival currencies, but also as simmering tit-for-tat tariff threats have resurfaced hot on the heels of yesterday&rsquo;s mainly sub-forecast US data. Hence, the index has pulled back further from 2018 peaks just above 95.000 to 93.710, while EMs continue their recovery or at least consolidate off all time/multi-year lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to best G10 performer on more stronger than expected Eurozone inflation data (French, Italian and the pan print), and another downturn in investor concerns regarding the political stalemate in Rome. The single currency has cleared another big figure at 1.1700 and its 10 DMA (1.1690) on the way up to a circa 1.1725 peak, but may now get bogged down by hefty option expiries spanning 1.1700-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technicals rather than fundamentals appear to be behind the Pound&rsquo;s revival vs the Usd as Cable reclaims 1.3300+ status, but lags the Eur with the cross approaching 0.8800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both around 0.2-0.25% up vs the Usd, with the Loonie extending post-BoC gains to 1.2835 and now looking for Canadian GDP data to back up the Central Bank&rsquo;s more upbeat economic assessment. The Franc has climbed a bit further vs the Usd to around 0.9870, but like Sterling has not kept pace with the Eur after latest SNB comments underlining that the current monetary policy stance is apt for choppy currency market conditions. Note, not much net response to a Swiss retail sales beat or a mixed GDP release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty much neck-and-neck for the antipodean dollars as the cross nestles in a 1.0820-60 range and both recover losses seen overnight on more disappointing macro news in the form of NZ business sentiment and Ausie capex. The Kiwi is back near 0.7000 and Aud almost as close to its nearest round number circa 0.7590, but perhaps capped by big expiries just above (0.7600-05 in 2 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still stuck in a narrow band vs the Usd just under 109.00, after much weaker than anticipated Japanese IP data and amidst more decent option interest between 108.90-109.00 (1.1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More choppy trade in debt markets, but Italian bonds did complete their recovery from Tuesday&rsquo;s lows to trade just above 129.00, and alongside confirmation of a significantly above consensus pan-Eurozone inflation update Bunds hit a fresh Eurex base of 160.95 (-107 ticks). Meanwhile, Gilts continue to pretty much track Bunds and slipped to 122.80 (-63 ticks) before retesting 123.00 and US Treasuries are mid-range from overnight session highs to lows awaiting a raft of data to end the month that has a relatively long index extension. Inflation will also be a major focus with the Fed&rsquo;s preferred price measure in the form of core PCE due alongside another NFP proxy via weekly claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are trading mixed today with Brent (-0.6%) and WTI (-0.4%) gradually extending losses on the day following the latest API crude inventory printing a surprise build in headline crude stockpiles. Note we will see the release of the weekly DoE&rsquo;s today due to the US Memorial Day on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Gold (+0.2%) trades marginally higher as it tracks the greenback following the uneventful Asia-Pac session. Meanwhile, base metals (with the exception of copper) were boosted by a strong Chinese manufacturing PMI reading with Shanghai nickel soaring to fresh three-year highs and London zinc higher by 0.8%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the trade front, US Secretary Wilbur Ross said that US steel and aluminium tariffs on EU will be announced as early as today, before US markets open or after markets close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (25 May) 1.001M vs. Exp. -0.500M (Prev. -1.300M).

        "content": "<p>EQUITIES<br />European stocks (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.3%) are largely tracking higher as the tension surrounding Italian politics cools further. The underperforming bourse is the DAX (-0.4%) which is being weighed upon by a possible US import ban on German autos. Large index constituents Daimler (-1.0%), Volkswagen (-1.9%) and BMW (-0.5%) all negative on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanish banks are seeing positivity as the no confidence vote debate in Spain begins (Santander +1.2% and Banco Bilbao +1.4%), with expectations set on the ousting of Spanish PM Rajoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstgroup collapsing to the bottom of the Stoxx 600 (-14.5%) after the resignation of their CEO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback is weaker across the board again, and partly due to gains in rival currencies, but also as simmering tit-for-tat tariff threats have resurfaced hot on the heels of yesterday&rsquo;s mainly sub-forecast US data. Hence, the index has pulled back further from 2018 peaks just above 95.000 to 93.710, while EMs continue their recovery or at least consolidate off all time/multi-year lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to best G10 performer on more stronger than expected Eurozone inflation data (French, Italian and the pan print), and another downturn in investor concerns regarding the political stalemate in Rome. The single currency has cleared another big figure at 1.1700 and its 10 DMA (1.1690) on the way up to a circa 1.1725 peak, but may now get bogged down by hefty option expiries spanning 1.1700-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technicals rather than fundamentals appear to be behind the Pound&rsquo;s revival vs the Usd as Cable reclaims 1.3300+ status, but lags the Eur with the cross approaching 0.8800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both around 0.2-0.25% up vs the Usd, with the Loonie extending post-BoC gains to 1.2835 and now looking for Canadian GDP data to back up the Central Bank&rsquo;s more upbeat economic assessment. The Franc has climbed a bit further vs the Usd to around 0.9870, but like Sterling has not kept pace with the Eur after latest SNB comments underlining that the current monetary policy stance is apt for choppy currency market conditions. Note, not much net response to a Swiss retail sales beat or a mixed GDP release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty much neck-and-neck for the antipodean dollars as the cross nestles in a 1.0820-60 range and both recover losses seen overnight on more disappointing macro news in the form of NZ business sentiment and Ausie capex. The Kiwi is back near 0.7000 and Aud almost as close to its nearest round number circa 0.7590, but perhaps capped by big expiries just above (0.7600-05 in 2 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still stuck in a narrow band vs the Usd just under 109.00, after much weaker than anticipated Japanese IP data and amidst more decent option interest between 108.90-109.00 (1.1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More choppy trade in debt markets, but Italian bonds did complete their recovery from Tuesday&rsquo;s lows to trade just above 129.00, and alongside confirmation of a significantly above consensus pan-Eurozone inflation update Bunds hit a fresh Eurex base of 160.95 (-107 ticks). Meanwhile, Gilts continue to pretty much track Bunds and slipped to 122.80 (-63 ticks) before retesting 123.00 and US Treasuries are mid-range from overnight session highs to lows awaiting a raft of data to end the month that has a relatively long index extension. Inflation will also be a major focus with the Fed&rsquo;s preferred price measure in the form of core PCE due alongside another NFP proxy via weekly claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are trading mixed today with Brent (-0.6%) and WTI (-0.4%) gradually extending losses on the day following the latest API crude inventory printing a surprise build in headline crude stockpiles. Note we will see the release of the weekly DoE&rsquo;s today due to the US memorial day on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Gold (+0.2%) trades marginally higher as it tracks the greenback following the uneventful Asia-Pac session. Meanwhile, base metals (with the exception of copper) were boosted by a strong Chinese manufacturing PMI reading with Shanghai nickel soaring to fresh three-year highs and London zinc higher by 0.8%. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the trade front, US Secretary Wilbur Ross said that US steel and aluminium tariffs on EU will be announced as early as today, before US markets open or after markets close.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.4%) conformed to the positivity with outperformance in mainland China after better than expected Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs in which the former data release printed an 8-month high. In addition, officials also did their part to help out with China to further cut import tariffs for consumer goods and will announce a new negative list which would ease investment restrictions on certain sectors, while the PBoC conducted a substantial daily net liquidity injection of CNY 180bln.
