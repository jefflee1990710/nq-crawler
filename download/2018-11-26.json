Parliament will hold five days of debate from 4-11 December, before voting on the deal on 11 December. Brexiteers, Remainers and opposition nonetheless continue to express opposition to PM May&rsquo;s proposal which practically remains the only deal on the table before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019; the EU warned that there is no plan B on an offer for the UK and that voters are mistaken if they think that voting &lsquo;no&rsquo; to the deal will get them a better offer from the EU. US President Trump also commented on the deal, noting it was good for the EU, and might prevent trade between the US and UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> Sources said that the country&rsquo;s coalition government is discussing reducing the 2019 deficit target to between 2.0% and 2.1% (from the current 2.4% which the EU has taken exception with); traders said this signals that Italy is willing to be flexible on the budget after the European Commission rejected it earlier this month. Italian PM Conte and Deputy PM Salvini have since declined to comment on specific numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB </strong>President Draghi told lawmakers that growth in the Eurozone is decelerating, as evidenced by some incoming data, though attributed this to a combination of weaker trade growth, as well as some country and sector specific factors; he also noted that such a slowdown was normal at this stage in the economic cycle, and argued that the Eurozone is not heading towards a recession. Many analysts are predicting that the ECB will unveil a fresh TLTRO programme, though Draghi did not have much to say on the subject. Draghi reiterated that the asset purchase programme will conclude at the end of the year. On inflation, he said that underlying strength of domestic demand and wages continues to support confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to target will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual winding down of our net purchases. He was confident that many of the financial uncertainties related to Brexit can be coped with. ECB&#39;s Praet also sees risks to the downside increasing noticeably, with recent developments indicating some loss of growth momentum while he believes risks are balanced with the extremes in risks assessments bigger than earlier. He urged clarification, possibly to be outlined at the December meeting, on what the ECB means by reinvesting for an &lsquo;extended period of time&rsquo;. He thinks the loosening of the country&rsquo;s fiscal policy will likely be neutralised by tighter conditions, perhaps more than neutralised. He also highlighted that the fall in oil prices is positive for Euro Zone growth. ECB&#39;s Lautenschlager said that it is time to gradually normalise monetary policy, and she was confident that the ECB will achieve its inflation target. She noted the outlook has not changed significantly as risks are still broadly balanced and with monetary policy, in particular with the reinvestment of the maturing assets, ample support to the economy will be provided. ECB&#39;s Nowotny said that ending QE poses little risk to stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Russia reopened the Kerch Strait near Crimea for shipping after seizing Ukrainian naval ships on Sunday, where no major damage was reported. The incident has raised tensions between Moscow and Kiev with the Ukrainian lawmakers voting to introduce martial law throughout Ukraine from November 28th while the Russian Foreign Ministry stated that they will respond harshly to any attempts to undermine security and sovereignty. US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has called Russia&#39;s actions against Ukraine provocations defining the matter as an &quot;outrageous violation of sovereign Ukrainian territory&quot; and adding that the US will maintain its Crimea related sanctions on Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOJ: </strong>Governor Kuroda said that the central bank&rsquo;s JGB buying programme was aimed at achieving 2% inflation, not monetising government debt. He noted that Japan&#39;s public debt was very large, and therefore it was important for the government to ensure medium-long term fiscal growth. Kuroda also said it was possible to shrink the BOJ&#39;s balance sheet at an appropriate pace when it is time to exit easy policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +1.55% at 2673, NDX +2.31% at 6678, DJI +1.46% at 24640. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +1.72%, Materials +1.21%, Industrials +0.84%, Cons Discretionary +2.60%, Cons Staples +0.04%, Healthcare +0.95%, Financials +2.12%, Tech +2.25%, Telecoms +1.93%, Utilities +0.53%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Barron&#39;s cautioned on FAANGs over the weekend, though the group was up on the day amid firm risk sentiment, with the exception of Apple (AAPL), which was lower on SCOTUS seemingly open to allowing App Store antitrust lawsuit. Casino stocks were among the top performers today after positive outlook from Jefferies, with Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM) trading higher. Semiconductor co. AMD (AMD) traded higher after positive comments from KeyBanc, and competitor NVIDIA (NVDA) benefitted too from an Outperform initiation at Credit Suisse. Newell Brands (NWL) surged on the back of a new CFO appointment. General Motors (GM) gained after announcing a restructuring, and the closure of a large production facility in Canada as well as mentioning further costs cuts to be announced. Amazon (AMZN) also made gains as strong growth, with traders citing strong Black Friday/Cyber Monday spending in 2018. Campbell Soup (CPB) moved lower through the day after an agreement was reached between the co. and hedge fund Third Point. There was some weakness in other restaurant/packaged, Darden Restaurants (DRI), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), General Mills (GIS) were also lower. Drug names, including Bristol-Myers (BMY), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Allergan (AGN) traded lower on the back of comments from an FDA official citing flat drug price inflation. Altria (MO) lower for the eleventh straight session on continuing concerns about regulatory uncertainty, while recently Nielsen reported decelerating cigarette volumes. New York regulators have given the go ahead for CVS&#39; (CVS) acquisition of Aetna (AET).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES $1.21 HIGHER AT $51.63; BRENT (F9) SETTLES $1.68 HIGHER AT $60.48. </strong>Oil prices have bounced back from steep losses incurred at the tail end of the last week, amid poor liquidity conditions; however, the complex has put in a negative performance every week for the last seven straight weeks, and has shed over 30% of its value in that period. The price environment may become more constructive after these steep losses; Goldman Sachs was again talking up commodities on Monday, suggesting that the fall in crude prices has not been backed by fundamentals. Traders are also focussing on the G20 meeting in Argentina this week, which will feature appearances from the Saudi and Russian energy ministers - ahead of the 6-7 December OPEC meeting in Vienna. Citi&#39;s analysts note the market is hopeful that we will see a concrete proposal for limiting supply: &quot;With rising US supply and weaker first half seasonal demand for oil, we see room for a 1.0mln BPD cut just to keep the market in a relatively close balance. In terms of the breakdown, Citi believes one-third of that amount will come from a further decline in Iranian output due to US sanctions, another one-third will be from Saudi Arabia, and the final third will come from Russia and others. &quot;Deeper cuts would naturally have a greater impact,&quot; Citi says, &quot;the other observation we&rsquo;d make is that while a $2 rally is significant, when it follows a $4 drop it doesn&rsquo;t quite establish a reversal of the trend.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 4+ TICKS LOWER AT 119-04+. </strong>The risk-on mood saw modest selling in the Treasury complex, where yields were higher by between 1-2bps at settlement; major curve spreads were generally little changed, with 2s5s and 2s10s slightly steeper, while 2s30s and 5s30s were narrower. The attention this week will be on Fed speak (with Powell set to speak twice, while VC Clarida is also on the slate) as well as the FOMC meeting minutes on Thursday, and the G20 meeting towards the end of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 2-YEAR AUCTION: </strong>The Treasury sold USD 39bln in 2yr notes at 2.836%, stopping through by 0.1bps. Cover was fairly steady at 2.65x, though a touch below the six-auction average. The breakdown was notable, as direct bidders returned to the fold, taking 19.5% of the issue (versus a previous 5.5%),and firmer than the six-auction average around 13%. The direct bid pushed indirect participation lower (44.9% vs 52.6% in October) while dealer takedown was at 35.6%. The US Treasury will auction 5-year (USD 40bln, Tuesday), 7-year (USD 32bln, Wednesday), 10-year TIPS (USD 11bln, Wednesday) as well as a 2-year FRN (Wednesday, 18bln).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The major laggard throughout Monday&rsquo;s EU session, but now extending losses through a key Fib level at 113.25 (50% retracement) to just shy of 113.50 where another Fib resides (between 113.45-50) and offers are anticipated for month end (from Japanese exporters perhaps). The catalyst for Yen weakness/outflows was largely a rebound in global stocks, oil and select commodities that together revived overall risk sentiment, but the Japanese unit may also have been undermined by dovish policy guidance from BoJ Governor Kuroda (reiterated the need to maintain powerful easy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>The Franc also underperformed, albeit to a lesser extent than the Jpy, to trade at the upper end of a 0.9955-85 range vs the Usd and closer to 1.1340 vs 1.1305 against the Eur on the aforementioned recovery in risk appetite and some signs of Italy conforming to EU budget demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>As noted above, the single currency derived some comfort/relief from reports that the Italian coalition is considering a cut to its 2019 deficit projection that would appease the EU and could avert EDPs from Brussels. However, Eur/Usd has lost traction and momentum ahead of its 30 DMA at 1.1394 to drift back towards 1.1350 as the Greenback in general moved off lows (DXY back up around 96.850 vs 96.655 at one stage). Note, comments from the ECB, including President Draghi did not have much net impact, as he maintained guidance and the October policy meeting outlook despite acknowledging recent weaker than expected data, while Praet was typically more dovish vs a notoriously hawkish Lautenschlager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD, CAD: </strong>The non-US Dollars have remained relatively firm vs the Greenback, but are all some way off best levels and the Aud has lost its podium spot to slip back below 0.7250, while the Kiwi is hovering just under 0.6800 and the cross has retreated a little further from overnight peaks just shy of 1.0700 towards 1.0650. Note, the Nzd continues to regroup after a post-Q3 retail sales wobble overnight and is now looking ahead to NZ trade data. The Loonie lost some of its oil-powered gains having pulled up ahead of big offers at 1.3180 and slipped back below 1.3200 after a big US house went long of Usd/Cad a few pips under the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling is emerging as a marginal G10 outperformer, albeit with Cable contained between 1.2800-50 post-EU approval of the UK Withdrawal draft and pending a speech from PM May to Parliament ahead of December&rsquo;s meaningful vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM:</strong> Some heavy losses vs the Usd with the Rub down through 67.0000 on the back of Russia&rsquo;s latest conflict with Ukraine, while the Brl was hit by a sharp decline in iron ore and domestic political issues related to Bolsonaro&rsquo;s handling of policies. Elsewhere, the Mxn was undermined by more US-Mexican border talk from President Trump, but the Try bucked the trend and climbed to 5.2200 at best having extended its technical rally through 5.3000.</p>\r\n",

The catalyst for Yen weakness/outflows was largely a rebound in global stocks, oil and select commodities that together revived overall risk sentiment, but the Japanese unit may also have been undermined by dovish policy guidance from BoJ Governor Kuroda (reiterated the need to maintain powerful easy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc also underperformed, albeit to a lesser extent than the Jpy, to trade at the upper end of a 0.9955-85 range vs the Usd and closer to 1.1340 vs 1.1305 against the Eur on the aforementioned recovery in risk appetite and some signs of Italy conforming to EU budget demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted above, the single currency derived some comfort/relief from reports that the Italian coalition is considering a cut to its 2019 deficit projection that would appease the EU and could avert EDPs from Brussels. However, Eur/Usd has lost traction and momentum ahead of its 30 DMA at 1.1394 to drift back towards 1.1350 as the Greenback in general moved off lows (DXY back up around 96.850 vs 96.655 at one stage) and attention turns to tonight&rsquo;s meeting of top Government officials in Rome. Note, comments from the ECB, including President Draghi did not have much net impact, as he maintained guidance and the October policy meeting outlook despite acknowledging recent weaker than expected data, while Praet was typically more dovish vs a notoriously hawkish Lautenschlager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The non-US Dollars have remained relatively firm vs the Greenback, but are all some way off best levels and the Aud has lost its podium spot to slip back below 0.7250, while the Kiwi is hovering just under 0.6800 and the cross has retreated a little further from overnight peaks just shy of 1.0700 towards 1.0650. Note, the Nzd continues to regroup after a post-Q3 retail sales wobble overnight and is now looking ahead to NZ trade data. The Loonie lost some of its oil-powered gains having pulled up ahead of big offers at 1.3180 and slipped back below 1.3200 after a big US house went long of Usd/Cad a few pips under the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling is emerging as a marginal G10 outperformer, albeit with Cable contained between 1.2800-50 post-EU approval of the UK Withdrawal draft and pending a speech from PM May to Parliament ahead of December&rsquo;s meaningful vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some heavy losses vs the Usd with the Rub down through 67.0000 on the back of Russia&rsquo;s latest conflict with Ukraine, while the Brl was hit by a sharp decline in iron ore and domestic political issues related to Bolsonaro&rsquo;s handling of policies. Elsewhere, the Mxn was undermined by more US-Mexican border talk from President Trump, but the Try bucked the trend and climbed to 5.2200 at best having extended its technical rally through 5.3000.</p>\r\n",

UBS notes that this week will bring approximately USD 90bln of cash flows, including around USD 8bln ofcoupons and around USD 82bln of redemptions (ex-reinvested portion of SOMA holdings). The week beginning 10 Decemberwill see ~USD25bn of cash flows (incl. USD1.2bn of coupon payments).</li>\r\n  <li><strong>2-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>Ahead of today&#39;s auction, 2-year yields have risen by around 2bps, while the curve has seen modest steepening, as as dealers set-up ahead of today&#39;s supply. The supply comes ahead of this week&#39;s FOMC minutes, as well as a heavy slate of Fed speak, where Chair Powell will speak a couple of times in the week. UBS says today&#39;s 2s auction will likely reignite questions about foreign demand: &quot;This will be an interesting test for the sector. There has been decent demand for US 2y paper recently, as demonstrated by all of the CME block trades in that part of the curve.&quot; Some, however, suggest that there will be a lid on yields ahead of this week&#39;s G20, as well as month-end related factors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) conformed to the broad rebound in sentiment, but with the mainland less decisive as Chinese commodity prices followed suit to their global peers in which Dalian iron ore futures dropped around 6% at the open and China oil futures hit limit down. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 680bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end and which coincided with a decline in the Japanese 10yr and 20yr yields to their lowest in 3 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped liquidity operations, although weekend reports noted it may have conducted repos with some banks.

In related news, there were conflicting reports over the weekend in which Italian Deputy PM Salvini was said to have threatened to bring down the government if coalition&rsquo;s budget deficit target was changed, although a later report suggested Salvini hinted of some room for compromise in which he stated that nobody is fixated on 2.4% budget deficit and that if there&#39;s a budget that makes the country grow, it could be 2.2% or 2.6%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Italian Government are to meet Monday evening to discuss a potential reduction of the deficit goal; according to a government source; Il Messaggero also reported that Italian Finance Minister Tria will bring various simulations on budget changes to top-level Italian government this evening in Rome.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Praet (Dovish) says that recent developments indicate some loss of growth momentum, with factors related to protectionism, financial market volatility and vulnerabilities in emerging markets are creating headwinds that are becoming increasingly noticeable. &nbsp;And the underlying strength of the euro area economy continues to support our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed. Also says that they will need to clarify, possibly in the December meeting, what the ECB means by reinvesting for an extended period of time. Adds that they need big changes in scenarios to not follow rate guidance, it is clear that risks to the downside have increased noticeably (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Lautenschlager (Hawk) says that it is time to gradually normalize monetary policy, and confident that we will reach inflation objective of close to but below 2.0%; and outlook has not changed significantly. Risks are still broadly balanced with our monetary policy, and with the reinvestment of the maturing assets, we will provide ample support to the economy. Adding that, we should not bind ourselves for a long period of time with regard to these reinvestments, as we cannot exclude the possibility that we will reach our inflation objective earlier than expected; or that there will be an increase in negative side effects from our expansionary monetary policy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities started the week on the front foot (Eurostoxx 50 +1.1%) following the upbeat performance experienced over in Asia, with moves exacerbated as US participants re-enter the market following the long Thanksgiving weekend. Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB (+2.8%) largely outperforms its peers as Italian Banks benefit from the positive BTP price action amid reports via government sources that the country&rsquo;s coalition government are discussing reducing the 2019 deficit target to 2.0%-2.1% from 2.4%. In turn hinting that Italy are willing to be flexible on the budget after the European Commission rejected it earlier this month. Italian PM Conte and Deputy PM Salvini have since declined to comment on specific numbers. As such, Ubi Banca (+5.9%), Unicredit (+5.9%), Bper Banca (+5.7%), Banco BPM (+5.1%) and Intesa Sanpaolo (+5.1%) all rest at the top of the Italian benchmark.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, UK banks have also received a lift after the European Council endorsed UK PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal, which still has to pass through parliament, with Dec 10th, 11th, or 12th touted as the possible dates for a meaningful vote, hence RBS (+2.6%) and HSBC (+2.6%) and Barclays (+2.6%) shares are higher. In terms of sectors financials are largely outperforming amid Brexit and Italian budget developments, whilst consumer staples underperform. Looking at stock specifics, Melrose (-5.0%) shares dropped after Sky News reported that the company is weighing options for GKN Powder Metallurgy division with a &ldquo;low-ball&rdquo; offer valuing the business at GBP 1.6bln, below analyst expectations. On the flip side Eurofins Scientific rose to the top of the Stoxx 600 after the company confirmed their guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD - A broad risk revival and commodity comeback of sorts has lifted the Antipodean Dollars alongside their Canadian counterpart that is benefiting from the recovery in oil prices especially. Aud/Usd is firmly back above 0.7250, while the Kiwi has managed to climb over 0.6800, albeit only just after a knee-jerk downturn in wake of weaker than forecast NZ Q3 retail sales overnight and ahead of trade data later today. Meanwhile, the Loonie has pared losses from 1.3200+ to circa 1.3190-85, but may struggle to get beyond 1.3180 where heavy supply is reported. Note also, a major US bank has entered a long Usd/Cad position at 1.3192, targeting 1.3450 with a 1.3075 stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - Also encouraged by the aforementioned upturn in risk appetite, but the single currency has appreciated independently on the latest Italian budget headlines indicating that the coalition Government may be ready to revise the 2019 deficit target, and significantly from 2.4% to 2.1% ore even 2%. This, ahead of a meeting in Rome tonight where Finance Minister Tria is expected to lay out several compromises for top officials to consider. Eur/Usd has bounced towards 1.1400 vs the low 1.1300 area, but not quite as far as its 30 DMA at 1.1394.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The Pound has derived some support from official EU approval for the Brexit withdrawal agreement, with Cable back above 1.2800 and trying to clear 1.2850, but not convincingly as UK PM May begins the arduous task of selling the deal to her party and parliament before a meaningful vote on December 12 (or perhaps 1-2 days earlier if the roadshow goes well).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The G10 loser and underperformer as safe-haven demand/flows wane and Usd/Jpy clears 113.00 with a bit more vigour to a 113.35 peak and fleetingly, but not sustainably thus far, a 50% Fib at 113.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The Usd and index have drifted down from highs amidst the all the above (Yen aside of course), with the DXY holding just above 96.500 vs a whisker over 97.00 at one stage and nearest tech support and resistance coming in at 96.318 and 97.055 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - Irrespective of Eur gains on the Italian developments noted above, the Scandi crowns are outpacing the single currency amidst the renewed appetite for risk assets and on the divergent Norges and Riksbank vs ECB policy dynamic as the latter acknowledges weaker growth in the Eurozone and may tweak guidance to reflect that at the next meeting. Eur/Sek is back down below 10.3000 and Eur/Nok has retreated from close to 9.7500 again accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (+1.1%) and Brent (+1.8%) are retracing recent losses as the USD eases from highs and market risk-sentiment improves after the complex plummeted almost 8% on Friday amid concerns of a supply glut and lower January oil demand. This comes as Saudi Arabia reported that crude production stands at an all time high at 11.1-11.3mln BPD. WTI flirts with the USD 51.00/bbl handle while Brent hovers around USD 60.00/bbl in early European trade, with traders keeping an eye on any hints to next year&rsquo;s oil production from OPEC+ countries, with the Dec 6th meeting looming. However, we may get some sort of direction just before December with the Saudi Crown Prince and Russian president meeting on the side lines of the G20 summit this coming weekend. Furthermore, some traders are noting that hedge funds haven&rsquo;t been this pessimistic in regard to global oil prices for almost three years. Finally, Shanghai International energy Exchange said they will raise the margin requirement for crude oil futures to 10% from 7%, effective Nov 28th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals complex, gold (+0.2%) is higher as the yellow metal moves conversely to USD actions, while silver (+1.0%) outperforms with markets gearing up for the FOMC minutes release later this week. Elsewhere, base metals hover near last-week&rsquo;s lows with the global growth slowdown weighing on investors&rsquo; minds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The euphoria and early bid in Italian bonds has petered out and aside from pure consolidation and profit taking there is likely to be an element of longs wanting confirmation that the Government is sincere about cutting the 2019 budget shortfall before getting too carried away. From a chart perspective, 10 year BTP futures did achieve an upside objective at 124.75, but did not breach the resistance level with enough momentum or conviction to test 125.00 and the next major bullish target at 125.34. Hence, a pull-back to just below the 124.00 handle and paring of losses for core Bunds, while Gilts actually carved out a fresh intraday high on Liffe at 123.00 (-10 ticks vs -29 ticks at one stage) amidst the ongoing Brexit vigil until UK Parliament votes on the draft next month. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain lacklustre awaiting the full return from Thanksgiving and with the short end braced for supply in the form of Usd39 bn 2 year notes.</p>\r\n",

Eur/Usd has bounced towards 1.1400 vs the low 1.1300 area, but not quite as far as its 30 DMA at 1.1394.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The Pound has derived some support from official EU approval for the Brexit withdrawal agreement, with Cable back above 1.2800 and trying to clear 1.2850, but not convincingly as UK PM May begins the arduous task of selling the deal to her party and parliament before a meaningful vote on December 12 (or perhaps 1-2 days earlier if the roadshow goes well).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The G10 loser and underperformer as safe-haven demand/flows wane and Usd/Jpy clears 113.00 with a bit more vigour to a 113.35 peak and fleetingly, but not sustainably thus far, a 50% Fib at 113.25.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The Usd and index have drifted down from highs amidst the all the above (Yen aside of course), with the DXY holding just above 96.500 vs a whisker over 97.00 at one stage and nearest tech support and resistance coming in at 96.318 and 97.055 respectively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - Irrespective of Eur gains on the Italian developments noted above, the Scandi crowns are outpacing the single currency amidst the renewed appetite for risk assets and on the divergent Norges and Riksbank vs ECB policy dynamic as the latter acknowledges weaker growth in the Eurozone and may tweak guidance to reflect that at the next meeting. Eur/Sek is back down below 10.3000 and Eur/Nok has retreated from close to 9.7500 again accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME&nbsp;</strong><br />The euphoria and early bid in Italian bonds has petered out and aside from pure consolidation and profit taking there is likely to be an element of longs wanting confirmation that the Government is sincere about cutting the 2019 budget shortfall before getting too carried away. From a chart perspective, 10 year BTP futures did achieve an upside objective at 124.75, but did not breach the resistance level with enough momentum or conviction to test 125.00 and the next major bullish target at 125.34. Hence, a pull-back to just below the 124.00 handle and paring of losses for core Bunds, while Gilts actually carved out a fresh intraday high on Liffe at 123.00 (-10 ticks vs -29 ticks at one stage) amidst the ongoing Brexit vigil until UK Parliament votes on the draft next month. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain lacklustre awaiting the full return from Thanksgiving and with the short end braced for supply in the form of Usd39 bn 2 year notes.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES &nbsp;</strong><br />WTI (+1.1%) and Brent (+1.8%) are retracing recent losses as the USD eases from highs and market risk-sentiment improves after the complex plummeted almost 8% on Friday amid concerns of a supply glut and lower January oil demand. This comes as Saudi Arabia reported that crude production stands at an all time high at 11.1-11.3mln BPD. WTI flirts with the USD 51.00/bbl handle while Brent hovers around USD 60.00/bbl in early European trade, with traders keeping an eye on any hints to next year&rsquo;s oil production from OPEC+ countries, with the Dec 6th meeting looming. However, we may get some sort of direction just before December with the Saudi Crown Prince and Russian president meeting on the side lines of the G20 summit this coming weekend. Furthermore, some traders are noting that hedge funds haven&rsquo;t been this pessimistic in regard to global oil prices for almost three years. Finally, Shanghai International energy Exchange said they will raise the margin requirement for crude oil futures to 10% from 7%, effective Nov 28th.&nbsp;<br />In the metals complex, gold (+0.2%) is higher as the yellow metal moves conversely to USD actions, while silver (+1.0%) outperforms with markets gearing up for the FOMC minutes release later this week. Elsewhere, base metals hover near last-week&rsquo;s lows with the global growth slowdown weighing on investors&rsquo; minds.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) were mixed with Australia dampened by losses in miners after the broad weakness across energy and metals in which crude slipped nearly 8% on Friday, while the Japanese benchmark was propped up by favourable currency moves. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) conformed to the broad rebound in sentiment, but with the mainland less decisive as Chinese commodity prices followed suit to their global peers in which Dalian iron ore futures dropped around 6% at the open and China oil futures hit limit down. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 680bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end and which coincided with a decline in the Japanese 10yr and 20yr yields to their lowest in 3 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped liquidity operations, although weekend reports noted it may have conducted repos with some banks. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.9453 (Prev. 6.9306)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Council released its statement that endorsed UK PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal as expected, while the EC restated determination to have a close as possible future partnership with the UK in line with the Political Declaration. This came after Spain struck an agreement with the UK and EU whereby Spain will have a veto over any future EU-UK agreement concerning Gibraltar. (FT). EU officials were quick to warn that there is no plan B on offer for the UK and that voters are mistaken if they think that voting &lsquo;no&rsquo; to the deal will get them a better offer from the EU. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU officials were reportedly told that a meaningful vote could occur on 10th or 11th of December. (Newswires/Independent) Later reports suggested that the vote could also be held on the 12th December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May was said to demand a Brexit TV debate with Labour Party leader Corbyn and a Labour spokesman later commented that Corbyn would relish a debate with PM May about her botched Brexit deal, while Scottish First Minister Sturgeon reportedly challenged the PM to a Brexit debate. (Newswires/Sky/Telegraph) UK PM May will now commence a two-week campaign to sell her deal to Parliament and the public with her central message being that if her deal is not supported, it will be &ldquo;back to square one&rdquo;. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it is going to be challenging for PM May to secure support for the Brexit deal as the DUP has vowed to oppose her. (Independent) Separately, there were comments on Friday from DUP Leader Foster that if UK PM May is successful in Parliament, we will have to review government leadership agreement and reiterated that the DUP cannot support the deal in its current form. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Cabinet ministers and EU diplomats are reportedly drawing up a &ldquo;Plan B&rdquo; proposal based on assumption PM May&rsquo;s deal will fail to get through Parliament. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&rsquo;s Brexit deal would leave UK GDP worse off by GBP 1000 per person by 2030 than if the country were to stay in the EU, according to an independent NIESR report that was commissioned by the People&rsquo;s Vote campaign. (Times)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy is to work closely with EU this week to find an agreement on the budget. In related news, there were conflicting reports over the weekend in which Italian Deputy PM Salvini was said to have threatened to bring down the government if coalition&rsquo;s budget deficit target was changed, although a later report suggested Salvini hinted of some room for compromise in which he stated that nobody is fixated on 2.4% budget deficit and that if there&#39;s a budget that makes the country grow, it could be 2.2% or 2.6%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Switzerland decisively voted to reject a referendum proposal regarding self-determination initiative which would have complicated relations with the EU. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />In FX markets, DXY tested 97.00 to the upside as it held on to Friday&rsquo;s advances against its major counterparts in which EUR/USD slipped below 1.1400 on soft PMI readings and with GBP/USD weighed by Brexit uncertainty. In addition, European leaders unanimously endorsed the Brexit deal which paves the way for a UK Parliament vote, although there are widespread doubts whether PM May can get this passed amid opposition from all sides including alliance partner DUP. Elsewhere, USD/JPY broke above 113.00 on safe-haven outflows, while antipodeans were initially lacklustre amid the recent commodity slump and with NZD/USD also pressured following poor retail sales but were later spurred alongside the positive risk tone and cross-related flows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand Retail Sales Volumes (Q3) Q/Q 0.0% vs. Exp. 1.0% (Prev. 1.1%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The commodities complex was mixed overnight with WTI crude futures nursing losses after last Friday&rsquo;s oil price collapse in which WTI declined nearly 8% to below USD 51.00/bbl and posted its worst weekly performance in nearly 3 years. As such, oil futures in China played catch up and dropped 5% to hit limit down and nat gas gapped lower by around 6% at the open in a continuation of the recent volatile price moves, while gold and copper were uneventful with prices near last week&rsquo;s lows amid an early sell-off in Chinese commodity prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia is said to be leaning towards a more discreet reduction in output, while OPEC are mulling plan to retain current output targets which were first set in 2016. Elsewhere, there were source reports on Friday that the Saudis and OPEC are reportedly considering a clandestine cut to oil output, while a senior source stated OPEC aren&#39;t discussing any extraordinary meeting due to oil price slides. (Newswires/WSJ/Platts)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ukraine accused Russia of an act of war after the latter fired at Ukrainian ships and seized 3 vessels off Crimea, while Russia said the Ukrainian ships entered its territorial waters near Crimea. Furthermore, Ukrainian President Poroshenko has reportedly asked Parliament to meet on Monday to discuss martial law. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran seized a Saudi Arabian fishing boat and arrested the crew. (Mizan)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea is reportedly not responding to US offer for talks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senator Graham said will push to sanction Saudi Crown Prince if CIA confirms he was behind the Khashoggi murder. (Axios)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were mixed on Friday with the T-Note drifting slightly higher in thin-liquidity conditions. The upward momentum was inspired by pre-market risk off, as equity futures and, crucially, crude futures, were on the back foot. Moves were small, however, and as we leave for the weekend, the Z18 contract is knocking in the middle of the day&#39;s range (11904 to 119-15). T-notes (Z8) settled 1+ tick higher at 119-09.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump denied a report that expressed dissatisfaction regarding Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mastercard projected Black Friday sales total rose 9% Y/Y to USD 23bln, and Adobe Analytics said Black Friday online sales rose 23.6% Y/Y to USD 6.2bln.

        "content": "<p>Asian equities and US index futures begin the week mostly positive as stock markets attempt to pick themselves up from the Thanksgiving holiday lull, but with upside capped amid the ongoing commodity rout. ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) are mixed with Australia dampened by losses in miners after the broad weakness across energy and metals in which crude slipped nearly 8% on Friday, while the Japanese benchmark is propped up by favourable currency moves. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) are positive as they conform to the broad rebound in sentiment, but with the mainland somewhat lagging as Chinese commodity prices follow suit to their global peers in which Dalian iron ore futures dropped around 6% at the open and China oil futures hit limit down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, DXY remains firm and reclaimed the 97.00 level in a continuation of Friday&rsquo;s advances against its major counterparts in which EUR/USD slipped below 1.1400 on soft PMI readings and with GBP/USD weighed by Brexit uncertainty. In addition, European leaders unanimously endorsed the Brexit deal which paves the way for a UK Parliament vote, although there are widespread doubts whether PM May can get this passed amid opposition from all sides including alliance partner DUP. Elsewhere, USD/JPY broke above 113.00 on safe-haven outflows, while antipodeans are lacklustre amid the recent commodity slump and with NZD/USD also briefly pressured following poor retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful as the lack of demand due to gains in riskier assets is counterbalanced by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 680bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end.</p>\r\n",
