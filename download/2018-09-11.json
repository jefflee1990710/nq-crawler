(AP)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU reportedly warned the UK of too much optimism over the &ldquo;red line&quot;, according to a report which noted that sources in Brussels are complaining about British &ldquo;over-spin&rdquo; and stated that UK officials are &ldquo;misreading&rdquo; upbeat statements from the bloc. Furthermore, it was stressed that that the bloc has not changed its mind about Chequers and senior EU source directly involved in the Brexit talks said there was no change on substance. (Evening Standard)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A source report noted that Brexit deal summit said to be likely by mid-November, with UK and EU preparing for meeting with leaders to sign deal and that a plan will likely be announced at September 19th-20th meeting in Austria. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irish PM Varadkar said Brexit deal may be within weeks, insisting a deal was possible in October but &quot;may well run into November&quot;. (BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sources confirmed the government is trying to prepare a series of bilateral deals with each of the EU 27 members to allow flights to continue to operate in the event of a &#39;no-deal&#39; Brexit. (Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond said there will be no extension to the transition period and some turbulence in the financial services could be expected if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, although he also commented that he agrees with Barnier a Brexit deal in six to eight weeks is doable. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond said BOE Governor Carney has agreed to serve until Jan 2020 as Governor of the central bank and that Jon Cunliffe is to be re-appointed as Deputy Governor.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump commented that trade talks are going well and Canada wants to make a deal with both sides operating in good faith. Trump also stated it would be good if US makes a deal with Canada but would be ok if it doesn&#39;t, and that the US is taking a very tough stance with China on trade. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada is ready to allow US dairy access in NAFTA talks and is reportedly to offer the US limited access to the Canadian dairy market in order to try and reach an agreement, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada PM Trudeau said there is a good NAFTA deal to be had but reiterated no deal is better than a bad deal and stated US auto tariffs would also impact the US.

If trade is the key driver of markets, it was certainly evident slightly later in the session, when Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister made her familiar noises about progress being made in trade talks, helping markets to tick-up. After the cash open, where stocks opened red, losses were gradually pared, with the ES moving back towards 2890, where it was forming a base in the latter part of August; the turnaround was notable, given LOD near 2867.25. The tech sector helped in the turnaround, with Apple (AAPL) ticking higher ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s expected new iPhone launch. The energy sector tracked crude higher, while telecoms also saw decent gains. SPX +0.4% at 2888, DJIA +0.4% at 25971, NDX +0.8% at 7508.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short end was sold seeing yields on 2s and 3s rise to fresh decade highs. There was some talk of short covering cited, as well as concession heading into this week&rsquo;s supply. In early trade, there were reports of a large 5s30s flattener going through, but by settlement, the spread was unchanged, while other curve spreads were biased towards extremely modest widening. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 9+ ticks lower at 119-10+.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, the FT reports that the Trump administration is looking to fast track Congressional approval for any US/EU trade deal, potentially as soon as November. Elsewhere, Canada&#39;s foreign minister Freeland confirmed that trade talks are back on with the US after a conversation she had with the USTR over the weekend; she continued to roll-off her familiar optimistic soundbites. On the US side, US President Trump said trade talks are going well, and Canada wants to make a deal; both sides are operating in good faith, adding that it would be good if a deal can be done with Canada, but it would be ok if it didn&rsquo;t. On China, the President said he is taking a tough stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>While the tone of Brexit commentary has tuned positive over the last week, some in Europe feel that the optimism may be over done: &quot;Sources in Brussels are complaining about British &#39;over-spin&#39; and say UK officials are &#39;misreading&#39; upbeat statements from Brussels, Paris and Berlin,&quot; the Evening Standard reported, adding that the bloc has not changed its mind about the Chequers plan. Nevertheless, Ireland&#39;s PM Varadkar said a Brexit deal could be reached within weeks - possibly October, but perhaps November, which would be in line with the timeframe specified by Brexit negotiator Barnier on Monday. UK Chancellor of the Exchequor said on Tuesday that the timeline stated by Barnier was &quot;doable,&quot; adding that any agreement does not have to be enshrined in a legal text. Hammond also ruled-out an extension of the Brexit transition period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.4% at 2888, DJIA +0.4% at 25971, NDX +0.8% at 7508. </strong>Sectors: Energy +1%, Materials +0.2%, Industrials -0.1%, Cons Disc +0.8%, Cons Stap -0.4%, Healthcare +0.0%, Financials +0.2%, Tech +0.9%, Telecoms +1.2%, Utilities -0.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITY FUTURES: </strong>News that China was to ask the WTO for permission to implement sanctions on the US saw flows out of US equity futures in the pre-market. If trade is the key driver of markets, it was certainly evident slightly later in the session, when Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister made her familiar noises about progress being made in trade talks, helping markets to tick-up. After the cash open, where stocks opened red, losses were gradually pared, with the ES moving back towards 2890, where it was forming a base in the latter part of August; the turnaround was notable, given LOD near 2867.25. The tech sector helped in the turnaround, with Apple (AAPL) ticking higher ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s expected new iPhone launch. The energy sector tracked crude higher, while telecoms also saw decent gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Activision Blizzard (ATVI) jumped on an upgrade at Stifel, which added ATVI on its Select List; Stifel also raised its price target for Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), which saw upside as a result. CenturyLink (CTL) was one of the top performers after it announced that its global fiber network will now give content providers access to Amazon&#39;s (AMZN) web services. United Rentals (URI) continued its upside momentum after yesterday announcing it would acquire BlueLine Rental for $2.1bln. On the flip side, Micron (MU) was hit, along with other China-reliant semis like Broadcom (AVGO). Western Digital (WDC) was lower after a downgrade at RBC, which also cut its price target; Seagate Technology (STX) fell in sympathy - last week, Evercore ISI downgraded WDC and STX on pricing worries. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) was one of the top underperformers after it announced a change in financial leadership, with its CFO set to retire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES $1.71 HIGHER AT $69.25/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLES $1.69 HIGHER AT $79.06/BBL</strong>. WTI was firm, with newswires citing the upcoming sanctions on Iranian crude for the upside (sanctions due to kick in in November), as Washington tells buyers of Iranian crude to seek other sellers. Others were pointing to the uncertainty amid Hurricane season (Florence is expected to re-strengthen later today, and the NHC says it will make landfall in North and South Carolina) as a dangerous hurricane), though the latest string of reports from the NHC have not identified any weather systems that would wreak havoc in the GoM. Brent was also finding support from news that the Buzzard oilfield restart has been delayed once again, though is expected to resume later on Tuesday. &quot;Newswire coverage of the oil market may attempt to make today&rsquo;s rally about Hurricane Florence or the projected US inventory data for last week, but we note that it&rsquo;s Brent crude oil continuing to lead the advance, with the November Brent-WTI spread now trading past $10 per barrel,&quot; Citi said. &quot;Reports that US crude oil exports for September to South Korea and Japan may reach record levels are not having much of a dampening effect on the Brent-WTI spread, suggesting the market really wants to see stronger US total crude oil exports,&quot; and added that some of the shipments to Japan and South Korea may have formerly flowed to China. Elsewhere, Russia&#39;s energy minister Novak hinted that OPEC/Non-OPEC may sign a new long-term cooperation deal in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DOE STEO: </strong>The short-term energy outlook saw the EIA cut its 2018 world oil demand growth forecast by 80k BPD, and it now sees 1.58mln BPD YY rise; cuts 2018 crude output estimate to 10.66mln BPD (prev. 10.68mln BPD) EIA also cuts 2019 world oil demand growth view by 100k BPD to 1.47mln BPD YY rise. Global petroleum demand for 2018 was raised by 10k BPD, 2019 cut by 90k BPDD, while demand is seen rising 1.58mln BPD in 2018 (+1.6%) to 100.1mln BPD, and by 1.47mln BPD in 2019 (+1.5%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 9+ TICKS LOWER AT 119-10+. </strong>The short end was sold seeing yields on 2s and 3s rise to fresh decade highs. There was some talk of short covering cited, as well as concession heading into this week&rsquo;s supply. In early trade, there were reports of a large 5s30s flattener going through, but by settlement, the spread was unchanged, while other curve spreads were biased towards extremely modest widening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 3-YEAR AUCTION REIVEW: </strong>The US sold $35bln at a high yield of 2.821%, the highest since May 2008, and tailed by 0.1bps. Some suggested that the internals were lacklustre, with dealers taking 43% (six auction average of 45.3%), directs taking 10.7% (versus 10.1% six auction average), and indirects taking 46.3%, slightly above the 44.5% six auction average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 10-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The US will sell USD 23bln in 10-year notes on 12 September 2018 at 1800 BST/1300 EST. The US Treasury will auction USD 73bln in 3s (USD 35bln, Tuesday), 10s (USD 23bln on Wednesday) and 30s (USD 15bln on Thursday); with USD 24bln maturing at he month-end settlement, the auctions will raise a net USD 49bln in new cash, according to TD Securities. The Fed will allow all USD 19bn maturing at month-end (the amount is below the $24bn cap) to run off at month-end. Analysts at Societe Generale say the 10-year note appears to be trading rich on the curve versus off-the-runs when compared to the last two auction cycles, and argues that it is also rich versus 5s and 30s. &quot;The 10y outright yield is near the top of this month&rsquo;s range and has cheapened by more than 8bp from Thursday&rsquo;s level. Any concession that brings it closer to 3% should draw in buyers,&quot; SocGen writes. &quot;The auction may also benefit from any short covering demand from leveraged funds, which are at a record net short in TY futures,&quot; SocGen adds. On the other side of the coin, SocGen says that the increase in auction size and inflation data releases scheduled during the week pose potential headwinds for the auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>After dipping overnight (risk-on), then rising overnight (China/WTO story raising trade fears), the DXY has been straddling neutral ahead of this week&#39;s CPI (Thurs) and retail sales data (Fri); the data slate in the US has been clear allowing the USD to benefit from a calm following more positive NAFTA noises, Brexit headlines, stabilisation in EM, as well as stabilisation on the EUR side as Italian fiscal tensions ease; but ING warns not to be carried away by this narrative, with the overhanging threat that US President Trump could announce 25% tariffs on $200bln of Chinese imports, and potentially following through on his threats made last week to impose a further round of sanctions, news that would likely see flows back into the USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>has been helped by more positive news on the Italian budget front, where official seem keen to make the right noises with regards to remaining within EU budget rules, driving a tightening in the bund/BTP spread since the end of August, providing support for the EUR. The single currency has also been aided by positive Brexit news flow, as well as decent ZEW data out of Germany on Tuesday. Credit Agricole has been talking the EUR up ahead of the ECB(Thurs) saying the balance of risks is now tilting to EUR-positive, as headwinds abate (Italy, Brexit, US trade tensions) which the bank argues could &ldquo;add credibility to the ECB&rsquo;s assessment and boost expectations of upcoming policy normalisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>The pound is red on Tuesday, as traders take some profits after recent gains, prompted by sources suggesting that UK policymakers may have been &lsquo;over-spinning&rsquo; and &lsquo;mis-reading&rsquo; the upbeat statements made by euro area officials as of late. 1.30 seems to be magnetic in GBP, while 0.89 is where action has gravitated towards with EURGBP. Positive labour market data had little impact, once again highlighting how the pound takes its cues more from Brexit headlines, rather than economic data. It could mean that Thursday&rsquo;s BOE meeting turns into a snooze fest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Despite the USD erring positive, the CAD has also made ground against its US counterpart on Tuesday as energy prices rose, and Canada&rsquo;s Foreign minister continues to express optimism with regards to reaching a NAFTA deal. Analysts at Credit Agricole also argue that USDCAD had become elevated, and sees fair value around 1.2966.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, AUD, NZD: </strong>The aforementioned USD revival pushed the JPY back down near 111.50+ lows and away from option expiry interest at 111.25 (1.7 bn) ahead of the NY cut, but the antipodean Dollars suffered more at the hands of their US peer with AUDUSD down through 0.7100 (presumably filling if not taking out residual leverage account short-covering buying interest altogether) and the Kiwi only just clinging to its 0.6500 perch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>The Swissy has made modest gains against the EUR and the USD on Tuesday. Analysts at UBS have noted that EURCHF has become very correlated with Italian spreads, and today that was clear with the spread seeing some small widening. &ldquo;Signals from Italy&#39;s policymakers (Conte, Di Maio, Salvini) continue to point to a relatively modest fiscal expansion which is consistent with a relief rally for Italian spreads,&rdquo; the bank wrote, and says that it finds that 10y BTP/Bund spreads may trade closer to 220bp if the 2019 budget is confirmed along these lines.</p>\r\n",

Others were pointing to the uncertainty amid Hurricane season (Florence is expected to re-strengthen later today, and the NHC says it will make landfall in North and South Carolina) as a dangerous hurricane), though the latest string of reports from the NHC have not identified any weather systems that would wreak havok in the GoM. Brent was also finding support from news that the Buzzard oilfield restart has been delayed once again, though is expected to resume later on Tuesday. &quot;Newswire coverage of the oil market may attempt to make today&rsquo;s rally about Hurricane Florence or the projected US inventory data for last week, but we note that it&rsquo;s Brent crude oil continuing to lead the advance, with the November Brent-WTI spread now trading past $10 per barrel,&quot; Citi said. &quot;Reports that US crude oil exports for September to South Korea and Japan may reach record levels are not having much of a dampening effect on the Brent-WTI spread, suggesting the market really wants to see stronger US total crude oil exports,&quot; and added that some of the shipments to Japan and South Korea may have formerly flowed to China. Elsewhere, Russia&#39;s energy minister Novak hinted that OPEC/Non-OPEC may sign a new long-term cooperation deal in December.</li>\r\n  <li>DOE STEO: The short-term energy outlook saw the EIA cut its 2018 world oil demand growth forecast by 80k BPD, and it now sees 1.58mln BPD YY rise; cuts 2018 crude output estimate to 10.66mln BPD (prev. 10.68mln BPD) EIA also cuts 2019 world oil demand growth view by 100k BPD to 1.47mln BPD YY rise. Global petroleum demand for 2018 was raised by 10k BPD, 2019 cut by 90k BPDD, while demand is seen rising 1.58mln BPD in 2018 (+1.6%) to 100.1mln BPD, and by 1.47mln BPD in 2019 (+1.5%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Technical, option-related and what appears to have been stops prompted by erroneous trades all contributed to an abrupt Cable reversal below 1.3000 vs almost 1.3090 and a retest of peaks post-UK data showing firmer than forecast average earnings.

ASX 200 (+0.6%) was lifted by broad strength across telecoms, tech, energy and financials, while Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) outperformed amid currency moves and M&amp;A news with Renesas to purchase US chipmaker IDT for over USD 6.7bln. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) and Hang Seng (-0.7%) were choppy in which the latter flirted with bear market territory amid ongoing trade uncertainty and continued liquidity inaction by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat as focus centred on outperformance of riskier assets in Japan and as a mixed 30yr auction also failed to drive price action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(FT) An earlier story in the Times had reported that Jacob Rees-Mogg believes that a no-deal Brexit would lift the UK economy by GBP 1.1trl over 15 years and that such a plan is preferable to PM May&rsquo;s Chequers plan.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade on the backfoot (Euro Stoxx 50 -0.5%) as losses in the continent accelerated amid rising trade tensions following reports China are to ask the WTO to authorise trade sanctions on the US. UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 is subdued by a firmer pound as GBP/USD sits above 1.3000. Sectors are broadly in the red with material names hit the hardest. One to watch on the M&amp;A front, UniCredit (-1.3%), source reports suggest that the company could consider a tie-up with BBVA (+0.2%) or ABN AMRO (+0.5%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G10 - It&rsquo;s a dead heat between the single currency and Sterling in terms of gains relative to the Dollar and other rival currencies, with the former buoyed by more promises from the Italian Government to adhere to the EU budget limits, and the latter still riding high on rising Brexit deal expectations. Eur/Usd gained momentum above 1.1600 after several failed attempts, but faded just ahead of 1.1650 and subsequently slipped back below the figure, as Eur/Gbp pivots around 0.8900 and Cable tests chart resistance around 1.3083-85 that stands in the way of 1.3100. Note, the Pound got a further fleeting boost from above forecast UK wage data over sub-consensus jobs readings on balance, but then slumped aggressively to just under 1.3000 amidst various reports about 1.3100 barrier defence offers in decent size, stops, technical selling and even &lsquo;fat finger&rsquo; trades (in spot and futures) before some calm was restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The major laggard after breaching support vs the Greenback around 111.25 overnight and the headline pair now probing offers circa 111.50 amidst bullish M&amp;A flows following the Usd6.7 bn offer for IDT from Japan&rsquo;s Renesas. From a technical standpoint, 111.55 forms the top of a daily cloud pattern ahead of a 61.8% Fib around 111.88 and then 112.00, but hefty option expiry interest at the 111.25 strike (1.7 bn) may hamper further gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/AUD/NZD - All benefiting from the broadly softer Usd, as the DXY dips below 95.000 again before recovering, with the Loonie pivoting 1.3150 ahead of more NAFTA talks scheduled for later today and Canadian housing starts data, while the Franc has pared losses from 0.9750+, but remains under 1.1300 vs the perky Eur. Looking down under, the Aud and Nzd continue to withstand tests of respective big figure support at 0.7100 and 0.6500 as the cross probes either side of the 1.0900 handle, and with leverage accounts said to remain active in Aud/Usd on dips due to short covering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - The Scandi crowns are not slipping too far from recent peaks vs the Eur or Usd, as the Riksbank maintains a broadly upbeat tone, albeit after adjusted rate hike guidance last week, and the latest Norges Bank regional survey reveals a robust outlook for output following strength in the latest quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Somewhat out of the limelight for once, but far from out of sight and clawing back more losses vs a generally soft Usd, with the underperforming Rub also firmer even though sanctions loom and the Russian Government continues to urge the CBR to hold fire on rate hikes. Rouble now pivoting 70.0000 vs circa 70.8400 at one stage on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price action and volatility has picked up considerably, though still pales in comparison to the fast and frantic moves in FX after the UK labour report, with Gilts seeing a fresh Liffe low and peak at 121.62 and 121.85 respectively vs their previous 121.98 settlement. Initially, bears seized on the stronger than expected wage components, but then as the Pound beat a hasty retreat the 10 core bond rebounded relatively firmly, and Bunds went along for the ride (within narrower confines on the upside) and bounced off a new Eurex intraday base of 159.34 (-35 ticks). Interestingly, market contacts note stops on a break of that level and just below support at 159.37 (continuation and June low), which would expose deeper downside levels ahead of 159.00. Meanwhile, US Treasuries have slipped to marginally lower overnight session troughs ahead of the first of this week&rsquo;s auctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures trade marginally higher with the latter dipping below USD 78/bbl in recent trade. Participants will be closely monitoring hurricane developments in the Atlantic with Hurricane Florence prompting mandatory evacuations in the southern East Coast in the US as it nears a category 5 strength. Russian Energy Minister Novak stated overnight that OPEC and allies are to discuss cooperation after 2018 in Algeria while adding OPEC+ members may sign a new long-term cooperation deal in December. Traders will also keep an eye on the latest API crude inventory figures released later today. Elsewhere, Gold pared back earlier gains, currently trading flat, while copper takes a breather from recent losses.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/20055/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade on the backfoot (Euro Stoxx 50 -0.5%) as losses in the continent accelerated amid rising trade tensions following reports China are to ask the WTO to authorise trade sanctions on the US. UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 is subdued by a firmer pound as GBP/USD sits above 1.3000. Sectors are broadly in the red with material names hit the hardest. In terms of individual movers, London listed Ashtead Group rose to the top of the Stoxx 600 following optimistic earnings. One to watch on the M&amp;A front, UniCredit (-1.3%), source reports suggest that the company could consider a tie-up with BBVA (+0.2%) or ABN AMRO (+0.5%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>G10 - It&rsquo;s a dead heat between the single currency and Sterling in terms of gains relative to the Dollar and other rival currencies, with the former buoyed by more promises from the Italian Government to adhere to the EU budget limits, and the latter still riding high on rising Brexit deal expectations. Eur/Usd gained momentum above 1.1600 after several failed attempts, but faded just ahead of 1.1650 and subsequently slipped back below the figure, as Eur/Gbp pivots around 0.8900 and Cable tests chart resistance around 1.3083-85 that stands in the way of 1.3100. Note, the Pound got a further fleeting boost from above forecast UK wage data over sub-consensus jobs readings on balance, but then slumped aggressively to just under 1.3000 amidst various reports about 1.3100 barrier defence offers in decent size, stops, technical selling and even &lsquo;fat finger&rsquo; trades (in spot and futures) before some calm was restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The major laggard after breaching support vs the Greenback around 111.25 overnight and the headline pair now probing offers circa 111.50 amidst bullish M&amp;A flows following the Usd6.7 bn offer for IDT from Japan&rsquo;s Renesas. From a technical standpoint, 111.55 forms the top of a daily cloud pattern ahead of a 61.8% Fib around 111.88 and then 112.00, but hefty option expiry interest at the 111.25 strike (1.7 bn) may hamper further gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/AUD/NZD - All benefiting from the broadly softer Usd, as the DXY dips below 95.000 again before recovering, with the Loonie pivoting 1.3150 ahead of more NAFTA talks scheduled for later today and Canadian housing starts data, while the Franc has pared losses from 0.9750+, but remains under 1.1300 vs the perky Eur. Looking down under, the Aud and Nzd continue to withstand tests of respective big figure support at 0.7100 and 0.6500 as the cross probes either side of the 1.0900 handle, and with leverage accounts said to remain active in Aud/Usd on dips due to short covering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - The Scandi crowns are not slipping too far from recent peaks vs the Eur or Usd, as the Riksbank maintains a broadly upbeat tone, albeit after adjusted rate hike guidance last week, and the latest Norges Bank regional survey reveals a robust outlook for output following strength in the latest quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Somewhat out of the limelight for once, but far from out of sight and clawing back more losses vs a generally soft Usd, with the underperforming Rub also firmer even though sanctions loom and the Russian Government continues to urge the CBR to hold fire on rate hikes. Rouble now pivoting 70.0000 vs circa 70.8400 at one stage on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price action and volatility has picked up considerably, though still pales in comparison to the fast and frantic moves in FX after the UK labour report, with Gilts seeing a fresh Liffe low and peak at 121.62 and 121.85 respectively vs their previous 121.98 settlement. Initially, bears seized on the stronger than expected wage components, but then as the Pound beat a hasty retreat the 10 core bond rebounded relatively firmly, and Bunds went along for the ride (within narrower confines on the upside) and bounced off a new Eurex intraday base of 159.34 (-35 ticks). Interestingly, market contacts note stops on a break of that level and just below support at 159.37 (continuation and June low), which would expose deeper downside levels ahead of 159.00. Meanwhile, US Treasuries have slipped to marginally lower overnight session troughs ahead of the first of this week&rsquo;s auctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures trade marginally higher with the latter dipping below USD 78/bbl in recent trade. Participants will be closely monitoring hurricane developments in the Atlantic with Hurricane Florence prompting mandatory evacuations in the southern East Coast in the US as it nears a category 5 strength. Russian Energy Minister Novak stated overnight that OPEC and allies are to discuss cooperation after 2018 in Algeria while adding OPEC+ members may sign a new long-term cooperation deal in December. Traders will also keep an eye on the latest API crude inventory figures released later today. Elsewhere, Gold pared back earlier gains, currently trading flat, while copper takes a breather from recent losses.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8488 (Prev. 6.8389)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Conservative Party Brexiteers are said to have failed to reach an agreement on an alternate Brexit plan with one Eurosceptic close to the matter stating that the group was not a homogenous one. (FT) An earlier story in the Times had reported that Jacob Rees-Mogg believes that a no-deal Brexit would lift the UK economy by GBP 1.1trl over 15 years and that such a plan is preferable to PM May&rsquo;s Chequers plan. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former UK Foreign Minister Johnson will continue to &ldquo;throw rocks&rdquo; at PM May&rsquo;s Chequers plan ahead of the Tory conference but has no plans to launch an immediate leadership bid amid the fallout from his personal life, his close allies have claimed. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK government may lose out on GBP 7bln of corporate VAT receipts post-Brexit, according to Treasury officials. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY attempted to nurse some of the prior day&rsquo;s losses although the recovery was only briefly as the greenback slightly softened against its major counterparts. As such, EUR/USD was quiet but managed to reclaim the 1.1600 handle nonetheless and GBP/USD remained firm above 1.3000 after the recent comments by EU&#39;s Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier that getting a Brexit deal is realistic in 6 to 8 weeks. AUD/USD initially tested 0.7100 to the downside following recent softness in commodities and after CNH declined to its weakest in over 2 weeks, but later rebounded, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were higher on safe-haven outflows and with upside in the pair gaining traction on M&amp;A news as well as a break though the prior day&rsquo;s highs around 111.25.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were uneventful overnight in which WTI crude futures traded sideways in a very tight range around the USD 67.50/bbl level with participants looking ahead to this week&rsquo;s inventory reports for a catalyst beginning with the APIs later after-hours in US. Elsewhere, gold was lacklustre and marginally extended on its losses, while copper found mild support amid a recovery in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia Energy Minister Novak said OPEC and allies are to discuss cooperation after 2018 in Algeria, while he added that OPEC+ cooperation could continue without output quotas beyond 2018. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NHC said Hurricane Florence has become a category four hurricane which is up from a category three, while NHC later commented that further strengthening is anticipated and that Florence is forecast to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday. In related news, US President Trump approved emergency declarations for North Carolina and South Carolina due to approaching Hurricane Florence. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is said to have conducted discussions with UK and France regarding potential Syria strikes. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korean Leader Kim offered to dismantle nuclear weapons program within 2 years, according to reports citing US National Security Adviser Bolton. (Yonhap)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The curve was mixed, with traders eyeing this week&rsquo;s supply, which will generate USD 49bln in new cash. The front end of the curve saw modest selling, pushing 2-year yields to fresh decade highs; the long-end continues to find haven buyers with continuing concerns lingering regarding trade wars. Treasuries also moved lower in sympathy with the bund as the Italian economy minister made the right noises regarding the upcoming budget. But other than that, the T-Note was largely rangebound, with little by way of news to shake it out of its slumber. US T-note futures (Z8) settled half-a-tick higher at 120-21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bostic (voter, dove) said the Fed is designed to be independent from short-term politics and that once we get to neutral, the Fed should wait and see. Bostic added that trade disputes have caused uncertainties among businesses which have been pausing investment plans until the trade landscape had more clarity, while he also suggested that inflation may begin to tick up due to the impact from tariffs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House GOP released plan for the 2nd round of tax cuts which included making lower individual rates permanent. (Newswires)<br /><br />Mexico is prepared to sign a bilateral trade deal with US if a US and Canada cannot reach an agreement, according to Finance Minister Anaya. (FT)</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) was lifted by broad strength across telecoms, tech, energy and financials, while Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) outperforms amid currency moves and M&amp;A news with Renesas to purchase US chipmaker IDT for over USD 6.7bln. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) &nbsp;and Hang Seng (-0.4%) are choppy with the latter flirting with bear market territory amid ongoing trade uncertainty and continued liquidity inaction by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY continues to nurse some of the prior day&rsquo;s losses but with price action contained amid a mixed performance of the greenback against most its major counterparts. As such, EUR/USD is subdued after having failed to reclaim the 1.1600 handle and GBP/USD remains firm above 1.3000 after the recent comments by EU&#39;s Chief Negotiator Barnier that getting a Brexit deal is realistic in 6 to 8 weeks. AUD/USD trades choppy and tested 0.7100 to the downside following recent softness in commodities and with CNH at its weakest in over 2 weeks, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are higher on safe-haven outflows with upside in the pair gaining traction on M&amp;A news and a break though the prior day&rsquo;s highs around 111.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand sapped amid outperformance in Japanese stocks and with participants also side-lined ahead of a 30yr auction later. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
