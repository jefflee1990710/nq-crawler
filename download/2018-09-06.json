Some also noted that, in a sign of progress, US trade representative Lighthizer was said to have rescheduled an afternoon meeting with Ways and Means members to continue talks with Canada. Mexico, meanwhile, once again called for the NAFTA deal to be a trilateral one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ADP PAYROLLS: </strong>The ADP reported 163k payrolls were added to the US economy in August, short of the 188k consensus. Pantheon said the data was disappointing, but not a disaster, suggesting that the ADP put too much emphasis on the drop in jobless claims and not enough on the impact of the soft official payroll number for July, and a seasonal tendency for a sub-trend august number. The consultancy also said it is premature to talk about payroll growth slowing, following July&rsquo;s 157k given that labour indicators remain firm and layoffs are still falling. It also gave its familiar warning about the ADP is not always a reliable indicator for the official NFP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NON-MANUFACTURING ISM: </strong>The services sector ISM, like its manufacturing counterpart released earlier in the week, surprised to the upside in August, with the headline rising by 2.8 points to 58.5. Wells Fargo said that increases in the current activity, new orders and backlogs of orders suggest broad-based strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Williams (voter, neutral) said it is a pretty good time for the US economy, with inflation and the labour market &lsquo;about as good as it gets&rsquo;. Williams said the lack of inflationary pressures means there is no need for the Fed to raise rates more aggressively. On the yield curve, he noted that while it was not a deciding factor in rate decisions, adding that some flattening of the yield curve is normal in tightening cycles, but the Fed&rsquo;s bond holdings were also playing its part. On the neutral rate, Williams said there is no reason to believe the economy is on the edge of an increase int eh neutral rate of interest. Fed&#39;s Evans (non-voter, dove) says the FOMC should raise rates to neutral, and &quot;likely a bit beyond&quot;, adding that higher inflation than expected would necessitate more tightening, though adds downside risks of trade uncertainty or stalling inflation expectations would require a shallower rate path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>Dep Gov Wilkins repeated the familiar BOC guidance that higher rates would be warranted, though rates will only be raised gradually. However, she also added that protectionist risks are rising presenting upside risks for inflation (especially when the economy is operating close to full capacity), and said that the impact of current trade environment was heavily discussed at the BOC, and the governing council still concluded that gradual rate hikes were warranted. CAD reacted bullishly, with USDCAD dropping from just under 1.32 to 1.3125 in the aftermath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 120-05+.&nbsp;</strong>Yields were higher across the curve, modestly bull-flattening as EM concerns, and the possibility that the US could hit china with 25% tariffs on $200bln of imports this week keeping Treasuries attractive as a haven; soft German factory data early in the European day also kept fixed income in demand. In afternoon trade, Cigna&rsquo;s $20bln 10-part M&amp;A bond helped the curve to steepen, but at settlement, major curve spreads were slightly narrower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES $0.95 LOWER AT $67.77/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLES $0.77 LOWER AT $76.50/BBL. </strong>Crude was under pressure, extending losses on Thursday. The API headline was bullish for the complex, with a draw of 4.3mln (cons -1.3mln) (Cushing +549k vs cons 0.058mln), though product inventories were bearish, with gasoline building 1.85mln (cons -810k), distillates +3.12mln (cons +742k). Production, meanwhile, was unchanged in the week at 11mln BPD. Crude also sympathised with the slide in stocks in the afternoon, while some desks also suggested we were seeing profit taking after the highs hit on Tuesday. In the medium to long term, analysts are still expecting sanctions on Iran to force a tightening in crude supply, providing a bullish catalyst. On Thursday, US Secretary of State Pompeo, speaking from Delhi, said that although US will consider waivers for Iran oil where appropriate, it&nbsp; expects all purchases of Iranian crude to fall to zero from every country, or sanctions will be imposed, adding that he will work with India on Iranian oil imports; India&rsquo;s imports of Iranian crude are slipping, with the August data showing they fell by a around one-third to 523k BPD. Elsewhere, the situation in Basra also warrants monitoring, with protests around oil facilities being reported again on Thursday. Elsewhere, China will raise the trading limit for its October crude futures contract to 8% from 5%, it said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.4% at 2878, DJIA +0.1% at 25996, NDX -0.9% at 7453. SECTORS: ENERGY -1.9%, MATERIALS +0.2%, INDUSTRIALS +0.3%, CONSUMER DISCRETIOANRY -0.3%, CONSUMER STAPLES +0.2%, HEALTHCARE +0.0%, FINANCIALS -0.6%, IT -0.8%, TELECOMS +0.7%, UTILITIES +0.4%. </strong>Ford (F) announced it will recall 2 million F-150 trucks in North America due to a seat-belt fire concern, and the automaker was down 0.7%. CBS (CBS) board is in negotiations for CEO Moonves exit from the company, sources reported with the board wanting to claw back some of Moonves compensation if he is found to have committed other inappropriate acts; the company&rsquo;s shares traded up over 3%. KLA-Tencor CFO warned that September was still a drought in terms of memory chip shipments and that a recovery may not be as strong as expected; KLAC sank 10%, dragging other chip names lower with it. Citigroup (C) announced it is to restructure its investment bank, and shares were hit by around 1.5%, underperforming other financials. Wells Fargo was also under pressure after WSJ reported that the DOJ has begun investigation of Wells Fargo&#39;s (WFC) wholesale banking unit, WSJ reports citing sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK, RUB: </strong>Thursday&rsquo;s fall guys and underperformers vs peers in the G10 and EM community respectively, with the former weakening on a push-back in Riskbank rate hike projections to December or February next year from October or December 2018 previously. However, there were a couple of dissenters in Deputy Governor Ohlsson and Floden, as the former wanted &frac14; point hike today and the latter preferred to keep the next policy meeting live for more than presumably further policy guidance. On that note, Governor Ingves &lsquo;confirmed&rsquo; that a 25 bp move is likely given that anything less is not really worthwhile in terms of monetary policy action, adding that clarifying the timing is important, so one can assume a signal in October if the intention is to tighten by the end of 2018. Eur/Sek back near 10.6000+ peaks after some consolidation, with the 10 DMA at 10.6090 nearby. Meanwhile, the Rouble was unable to join a broad EM revival that saw other beleaguered currencies claw back some lost ground, albeit against a generally softer Usd, and it could be the lack of a clear sign of higher official rates at next Friday&rsquo;s policy meeting that undermined the Rub. Indeed, although the CBR noted that inflation is rebounding towards 4% quicker than forecast, and will be a factor for consideration, many other policy inputs favour a steady hand vs some more recent developments that would warrant tightening. Usd/Rub up to circa 69.2175 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, NZD: </strong>The Loonie slipping back towards 1.3200 lows vs its US rival after weaker than expected Canadian building permits and latest NAFTA headlines, as Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister maintained no deal without all 3 parties. However, the Loonie caught a bid after hawkish comments from the BoC dep gov Wilkins, who said the BoC discussed whether it was still appropriate to raise rates gradually amid trade uncertainty (it did deem it appropriate). The Kiwi is also eyeing Central Bank rhetoric as RBNZ chief Orr is scheduled to speak later (2230 BST/1730 EST), and some are of the opinion that he could warn about downside economic risks due to global trade wars, with implications for looser policy in that event. Nzd/Aud straddling 0.6600, but toppy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, JPY, GBP: </strong>Still vying for top spot in the G10 ranks, with the Franc rebounding from 0.9700+ levels vs the Dollar following little net reaction to a considerable Swiss Q2 GDP beat and upward revisions to back data, while Usd/Jpy has eased back further from around 111.50 through its 10 and 30 DMAs, and only a fraction off decent option expiry interest at the 111.00 strike (1 bn) ahead of the NY cut. Elsewhere, Cable managed to maintain 1.2900+ levels for the most part and pivot 0.9000 vs the Eur even though Germany downplayed if not refuted claims that it may be more flexible on Brexit bill conditions, and amidst more reports about Tory rebel rousing over the Chequers White Paper and further UK concessions to the EU if it is rejected, as seems highly likely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Back to consolidating around the 0.7200 handle vs its US counterpart on a mixture of technical and lock-step trade with EMs, including the Yuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NFP PREVIEW: </strong>Analysts forecast 191k nonfarm payrolls will be added to the US economy in August, though wage growth is seen unchanged at 2.7% YY. Headline payrolls have been decent, with recent averages at healthy levels. Analysts expect wages will begin ticking up as the unemployment rate edges lower. While ADP payrolls were short of expectations, business surveys have given positive signals. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20029/download\"><em><strong>Click here for RANsquawk&rsquo;s preview.</strong></em></a></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>SEK/RUB</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thursday&rsquo;s fall guys and underperformers vs peers in the G10 and EM community respectively, with the former weakening on a push-back in Riskbank rate hike projections to December or February next year from October or December 2018 previously. However, there were a couple of dissenters in Deputy Governor Ohlsson and Floden, as the former wanted &frac14; point hike today and the latter preferred to keep the next policy meeting live for more than presumably further policy guidance. On that note, Governor Ingves &lsquo;confirmed&rsquo; that a 25 bp move is likely given that anything less is not really worthwhile in terms of monetary policy action, adding that clarifying the timing is important, so one can assume a signal in October if the intention is to tighten by the end of 2018. Eur/Sek back near 10.6000+ peaks after some consolidation, with the 10 DMA at 10.6090 nearby. Meanwhile, the Rouble was unable to join a broad EM revival that saw other beleaguered currencies claw back some lost ground, albeit against a generally softer Usd, and it could be the lack of a clear sign of higher official rates at next Friday&rsquo;s policy meeting that undermined the Rub. Indeed, although the CBR &nbsp;noted that inflation is rebounding towards 4% quicker than forecast, and will be a factor for consideration, many other policy inputs favour a steady hand vs some more recent developments that would warrant tightening. Usd/Rub up to circa 69.2175 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marginal major underperformers, with the Loonie slipping back towards 1.3200 lows vs its US rival after weaker than expected Canadian building permits and latest NAFTA headlines, as Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister maintained no deal without all 3 parties, awaiting comments from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins. The Kiwi is also eyeing Central Bank rhetoric as RBNZ chief Orr is scheduled to speak later, and some are of the opinion that he could warn about downside economic risks due to global trade wars, with implications for looser policy in that event. Nzd/Aud straddling 0.6600, but toppy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY/GBP &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still vying for top spot in the G10 ranks, with the Franc rebounding from 0.9700+ levels vs the Dollar following little net reaction to a considerable Swiss Q2 GDP beat and upward revisions to back data, while Usd/Jpy has eased back further from around 111.50 through its 10 and 30 DMAs, and only a fraction off decent option expiry interest at the 111.00 strike (1 bn) ahead of the NY cut. Elsewhere, Cable managed to maintain 1.2900+ levels for the most part and pivot 0.9000 vs the Eur even though Germany downplayed if not refuted claims that it may be more flexible on Brexit bill conditions, and amidst more reports about Tory rebel rousing over the Chequers White Paper and further UK concessions to the EU if it is rejected, as seems highly likely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back on the 0.7200 handle vs its US counterpart on a mixture of technical and lock-step trade with EMs, including the Yuan.</p>\r\n",

In FX, the DXY is back on the 95.000 handle and weaker vs all G10 rivals bar the Cad (much softer than anticipated Canadian building permits and ongoing NAFTA uncertainty impacting), and with most EMs also enjoying a rare day of gains vs the Greenback.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) were negative as Australia mirrored the tech rout stateside and with sentiment in Japan was dampened after the Hokkaido region was hit by a powerful earthquake which triggered large landslides and mass power outages. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) both opened lower although the latter then found support just below the 2700 level after stock-supportive measures including a proposed regulatory revision to permit more stock repurchases and with interest income from loans to smaller firms to be VAT-exempted. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher with prices underpinned by the predominantly risk-averse tone in the region and amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market in which it upped its purchases of 5yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8217 (Prev. 6.8266)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&rsquo;s securities regulator proposed revision to rules to widen circumstances for listed companies to conduct stock repurchases, while China Mofcom stated that financial institutions&#39; interest income from loans to smaller firms will be VAT-exempted. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USGS reported a magnitude 7 quake striking 112km SSE of Sapporo, Japan at a depth of 66km. Furthermore, reports noted that some people were trapped in collapsed buildings and that there was a power outage in all of Japan&#39;s Hokkaido following the earthquake, while Japanese Trade Minister Seko said it will take a minimum of 1 week to restore all power in Hokkaido following the earthquake. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Board Member Kataoka sees low chances for Japan&#39;s economy momentum to reach price target being heightened under current framework, while Kataoka added the BoJ didn&#39;t need to allow more flexibility in long-term yields when it was reducing price forecasts and that permitting long-term yields to rise could delay reaching the price target. Furthermore, Kataoka stated the BoJ&#39;s new forward guidance only states the obvious and that the BoJ should expand stimulus to achieve price target quicker instead of taking measures to prolong period of easy policy. Kataoka also stated a July decision is neither an expansion nor a withdraw from stimulus; adding don&#39;t see any significant demerits emerging from BoJ&#39;s easy policy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused Mark Carney of &ldquo;demeaning&rdquo; the BoE by extending his term as governor for a second time and insists that he should step down. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&#39;s Finance Minister Tria said may accept 1.5% deficit in 2019, budget package seen at EUR 25-30bln. Italy&#39;s 5 Star seeks a 2019 deficit between 2%-2.5%. Of note: Deutsche Bank notes a 2-2.3% deficit of GDP may be consistent with a declining debt ration but would still imply a significant violation of EU rules while above 2.3% would likely prevent the debt ratio from declining. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Riksbank stood pat on their key policy rate at -0.50% as expected. The central bank sees repo rate averaging -0.5% in Q4 vs. Prev. forecast of -0.43%. The repo rate path suggests rate will be unchanged in October but raised by 25bps in either December or February. Deputy Governor Floden entered into a reservation against the repo rate path in the report and was in favour indicating a 25bps hike in October while Deputy Governor Ohlsson entered into a reservation against the repo rate path in the report and wanted a 25bps at today&#39;s meeting. Governor Ingves, at the press conference, said a rate hike smaller than 25bps is not meaningful in a monetary policy sense; he adds it is important to be clear about the timing of a rate hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade mixed (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.1%) with Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB (+0.4%) outperforming in a continuation of the trend observed in the past few days, while Spain&rsquo;s IBEX (-0.6%) underperforms, weighed on by financial names with the IBEX 35 banking sector down over 1%. In terms of stock specifics, Safran (+6.1%) shares flew to the top of the Stoxx 600 following an impressive upgrade in guidance. Elsewhere, Sodexo (-4.4%) shares took a hit following uninspiring earnings. Also of note: Wirecard (+1.2%) is to take Commerzbank&rsquo;s (-0.7%) spot in the DAX 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - The major G10 mover and loser in early EU trade, as the Riksbank rolled back its rate hike path and ruled out October as a live policy meeting in terms of any action vs December or February 2019 when it predicts a tightening move. There were 2 dissentions, and one particularly hawkish as Deputy Governor Ohlsson called for an immediate 25 bp rise in the repo, while Floden wanted to keep options open for next month. However, Eur/Sek took out some touted offers at 10.6000 before easing back a little, but remains well above circa 10.5230 lows, and from a technical perspective the 10 DMA is 10.6090. Post-meeting press conference looming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD - Some respite for the non-US Dollar commodity currencies, partly on firmer underlying prices, plus chart dynamics and a broad Greenback downturn. Aud/Usd has bounced off lows around 0.7165 to retest offers/resistance around 0.7200 having fallen overnight on 2 more hikes in bank lending rates which offset or overshadowed decent Aussie trade data. Similarly, the Kiwi is attempting to revisit 0.6600 following another failure to sustain momentum above the big figure amidst ongoing global trade and diplomatic tensions, while the Loonie is looking a bit more stable off 1.3200+ lows vs its US counterparts on broadly positive NAFTA reports after the first day of fresh talks between Canada and the US. Ahead, building permits data and a speech from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins after yesterday&rsquo;s largely unchanged policy statement/forward guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF/GBP - All relative outperformers, and for different reasons, with Usd/Jpy back below 111.50 amidst earthquake-related repatriation flows, the Franc firming back through 0.9700 after stronger than expected Swiss GDP data, albeit belatedly, and the Pound still holding onto the bulk of Wednesday&rsquo;s Brexit-inspired gains even though Germany has poured cold water on reports that it is willing to withdraw some demands for the future relationship between the EU and UK &ndash; Cable remaining above 1.2900 and Eur/Gbp encircling 0.9000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency is trying to former a firmer base above 1.1600, but aided by the aforementioned renewed Greenback weakness as the DXY hovers around 95.000 again, and looking to clear 1.1650 for an upside break from recent ranges. However, the upper end of a series of big option expiries (1.2 bn from 1.1625-35) could cap further upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - An all too rare and widespread recovery rebound across the region, the question is whether this is respite or a more meaningful retracement and platform for further unwinding of outperformance. Fundamentally, some positive news for the Rand as SA current account data was not as bad as feared, with Usd/Zar back below 15.3000 vs circa 15.6900 at one stage yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh intraday peaks, and for Gilts also a new Liffe session low before relatively stable trade around 20-25 ticks above par for the 10 year EU benchmarks. Rather mixed to soft auction results from France, Spain and the UK have not really impacted, but core bonds retain an underlying bid due to ongoing global risk events that are well documented and therefore not really necessary to spell out again. Bunds are just below the 161.16 high (+24 ticks vs -1 tick at one stage), with Gilts retreating a bit further from their best (122.33, +35 ticks), while US Treasuries are nudging minor new overnight session pinnacles amidst mild curve steepening ahead of a busy agenda of data (compressed due to Monday&rsquo;s Labor Day holiday), Fed speak from Williams and issuance details for next week&rsquo;s 3, 10 and 30 year auctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures trade marginally higher following yesterday&rsquo;s retreat to below the USD 69.00/bbl and USD 77.50/bbl levels respectively (with the latter reclaiming the level in recent trade). The weekly API inventory report showed a smaller than expected draw in headline crude stockpiles with a muted reaction in the oil market. News flow has been light for the complex thus far. In terms of NHC updates, tropical depression Gordon continues to drift through Western Mississippi, threat of heavy rains and flooding will continue for several days, while Hurricane Olivia and Florence remain strong albeit still away from land. Traders will keeping an eye on the delayed weekly EIA crude inventory report due at 1600BST/1100EDT. The metals complex is broadly benefitting from the pullback in the dollar. Copper outperforms its peers amid upside in Chinese commodities.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major G10 mover and loser in early EU trade, as the Riksbank rolled back its rate hike path and ruled out October as a live policy meeting in terms of any action vs December or February 2019 when it predicts a tightening move. There were 2 dissentions, and one particularly hawkish as Deputy Governor Ohlsson called for an immediate 25 bp rise in the repo, while Floden wanted to keep options open for next month. However, Eur/Sek took out some touted offers at 10.6000 before easing back a little, but remains well above circa 10.5230 lows, and from a technical perspective the 10 DMA is 10.6090. Post-meeting press conference looming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some respite for the non-US Dollar commodity currencies, partly on firmer underlying prices, plus chart dynamics and a broad Greenback downturn. Aud/Usd has bounced off lows around 0.7165 to retest offers/resistance around 0.7200 having fallen overnight on 2 more hikes in bank lending rates which offset or overshadowed decent Aussie trade data. Similarly, the Kiwi is attempting to revisit 0.6600 following another failure to sustain momentum above the big figure amidst ongoing global trade and diplomatic tensions, while the Loonie is looking a bit more stable off 1.3200+ lows vs its US counterparts on broadly positive NAFTA reports after the first day of fresh talks between Canada and the US. Ahead, building permits data and a speech from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins after yesterday&rsquo;s largely unchanged policy statement/forward guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All relative outperformers, and for different reasons, with Usd/Jpy back below 111.50 amidst earthquake-related repatriation flows, the Franc firming back through 0.9700 after stronger than expected Swiss GDP data, albeit belatedly, and the Pound still holding onto the bulk of Wednesday&rsquo;s Brexit-inspired gains even though Germany has poured cold water on reports that it is willing to withdraw some demands for the future relationship between the EU and UK &ndash; Cable remaining above 1.2900 and Eur/Gbp encircling 0.9000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency is trying to former a firmer base above 1.1600, but aided by the aforementioned renewed Greenback weakness as the DXY hovers around 95.000 again, and looking to clear 1.1650 for an upside break from recent ranges. However, the upper end of a series of big option expiries (1.2 bn from 1.1625-35) could cap further upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An all too rare and widespread recovery rebound across the region, the question is whether this is respite or a more meaningful retracement and platform for further unwinding of outperformance. Fundamentally, some positive news for the Rand as SA current account data was not as bad as feared, with Usd/Zar back below 15.3000 vs circa 15.6900 at one stage yesterday.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) were negative as Australia mirrored the tech rout stateside and with sentiment in Japan was dampened after the Hokkaido region was hit by a powerful earthquake which triggered large landslides and mass power outages. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (flat) both opened lower although the latter then found support just below the 2700 level after stock-supportive measures including a proposed regulatory revision to permit more stock repurchases and with interest income from loans to smaller firms to be VAT-exempted.

Furthermore, Kataoka stated the BoJ&#39;s new forward guidance only states the obvious and that the BoJ should expand stimulus to achieve price target quicker instead of taking measures to prolong period of easy policy.

Elsewhere, JPY firmed against the greenback with the currency spurred by safe-haven and repatriation flows following the Hokkaido earthquake, while antipodeans initially traded higher in which AUD/USD and NZD/USD briefly reclaimed the 0.7200 and 0.6600 handles respectively, but then pared the moves with AUD pressured after more of Australia&rsquo;s big 4 banks hiked mortgage rates and effectively reduced pressure on the RBA to start tightening policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ANZ Bank announced to raise variable home loan interest rates by 16bps and Commonwealth Bank of Australia is to also hike variable mortgage rates by 15bps.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets traded mostly lower after a similar lead from US where the Nasdaq underperformed and the tech sector saw its worst performance in over a month as social media executives testified at Congress. ASX 200 (-1.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) were negative as Australia mirrored the tech rout stateside and with sentiment in Japan dampened after the Hokkaido region was hit by a powerful earthquake which triggered large landslides and mass power outages. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) both opened lower although the latter then found support just below the 2700 level after stock-supportive measures including a proposed regulatory revision to permit more stock repurchases and with interest income from loans to smaller firms to be VAT-exempted. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher with prices underpinned by the predominantly risk-averse tone in the region and amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market in which it upped its purchases of 5yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are negative with Australia mirroring the tech rout stateside and with sentiment in Japan dampened after the Hokkaido region was hit by a powerful earthquake which triggered large landslides and mass power outages. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) both opened lower although the latter then found support just below the 2700 level amid outperformance in the mainland and after the securities regulator proposed revision to rules to widen circumstances for listed companies to conduct stock repurchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remains subdued and tests the 95.00 level to the downside as its major counterparts extend on recent gains with EUR/USD briefly fuelled after tripping through stops at the prior day&rsquo;s highs around 1.1640, while GBP/USD found a base at 1.2900 and holds on to the majority of the advances spurred by the recent Brexit-friendly headlines. Elsewhere, antipodeans trade marginally higher with AUD/USD testing 0.7200 to the upside and with NZD/USD more successful in its reclaim of the 0.6600 handle, while JPY also firmed against the greenback spurred by safe-haven and repatriation flows following the Hokkaido earthquake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices underpinned by the predominantly risk averse tone in the region and amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market in which it upped its purchases of 5yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",
