Furthermore, he stated the governing council will monitor FX as well as other financial market conditions and that ample stimulus remains necessary for inflation to rise.<br />ECB&#39;s Draghi reiterated patience, prudence and persistence, while he also stated that incoming data since March meeting shows a moderation of growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB sources stated that policymakers are keen not to upset market expectations regarding an end of QE this year and a rate hike in mid-2019, while sources suggested a decision is seen in June or July with chance of a delay to September.

EUR saw volatile price action, albeit not as pronounced as Sterling, during ECB President Draghi&rsquo;s post-meeting press conference and Q&amp;A (after rates and QE size/guidance was left unchanged). EURUSD initially fell on his concession that economic activity has slowed and reiteration that underlying inflation remains subdued, but shorts were subsequently squeezed as he played down the growth moderation and maintained that prices are on track (with the aid of ongoing monetary accommodation) to reach target in the medium term. EURUSD knee-jerked down through key support around 1.2155 to sub-1.2150 before snapping back to just over 1.2200 ahead of massive (5+ bn) option expiries and then recoiling sharply again to new session lows breaking through 1.2100 in later trade. SEK The Krona was undermined by the Riksbank pushing back rate hike projections until late 2018 in response to weaker than forecast Swedish inflation developments, with EURSEK up to 8 year highs at one stage just over 10.4800, but then fading alongside the EUR in general. Note, Ohlsson dissented in favour of a hike to -0.25% from 0.50%, but this was largely shrugged off and a lone, outlying hawkish shout. DXY The index is ending the session firmer having dipped alongside US Treasury yields (10 year cash back below 3%) and probing earlier peaks circa 91.300 on a combination of EUR selling and perhaps belated buying in wake of a near clean sweep of US data beats (including weekly claims, headline durable goods and advanced trade). CHF/CAD The Franc and Loonie both look set to extend recent losses vs the USD as resistance/round numbers in USDCHF and USDCAD are breached at 0.9850 and 1.2850 respectively. JPY/AUD/NZD All flat and relatively resistant vs the Greenback after recent heavy losses around 109.30, 0.7550 and 0.7070, with the Kiwi awaiting NZ trade data and Jpy the BoJ for more independent impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAFTA countries are aiming for a May 1st agreement although big issues remain, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The S&amp;P 500 Emini was contained within the 2640-2670 range and only in later trade broke through the 2670, before falling back below that level. Technology was the leading sector today following decent earnings from Facebook (FB), which helped FAANG stocks, but some weakness was seen in Apple (AAPL) after another research note raising concerns about iPhone demand which caught further attention (Bernstein). The worst performing sector was Telecoms, closing lower than 3% after poor earnings from AT&amp;T (T) due to a loss in video subscribers as customers are moving to cheaper streaming services. CMG led the SPX today following a stellar earnings report, EPS reported $2.13 against the consensus $1.57, and revenues inline, the stronger report is being attributed to menu price increases it implemented a year ago. On the flip side LKQ Corp. (LKQ) pressured the index as EPS came in lower than consensus, but revenues did slightly beat, LKQ closed lower by c.17%. Earnings again showing the large movers in NDX today, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) outperforming the NDX among with Facebook (FB), ALXN beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line sending shares higher than 12% on Thursday. However, earnings from eBay (EBAY) and American Airlines (AAL) limited upside growth on Thursday for the index, and over in the DJI led by Visa&rsquo;s (V) earnings report. In M&amp;A news, SJW (SJW) was up by 10% after California a pre-market official offer of&nbsp; USD 1.9bln was made by California Water (CWT), a bid that was later said to be rejected by co.

Sources reported an official NAFTA deal is expected on May 1<sup>st</sup>, in line with the expectations that member countries reported a few weeks ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*ECB: </strong>Policy was left unchanged, and President Draghi didn&rsquo;t give any indications about future policy normalisation. There was also a note of caution regarding the softer tone of incoming data, though Draghi suggested that growth was moderating from historically strong levels, while other temporary factors also contributed (weather, labour strikes, timing of Easter). Draghi also reiterated his confidence that inflation will rise towards target, but emphasised his familiar &lsquo;patience, prudence and persistence&rsquo; line. On policy normalisation, Draghi was coy, providing no new information; he said that monetary policy was no discussed, per se, and had no updates about normalisation, instead, the Governing Council discussed how to interpret data weakness. The central bank&rsquo;s next policy meeting is on 14/June, where it will updated its economic projections, and possibly provide more clues about the path of normalisation. However, some expect such an update to be forthcoming at the July meeting (on asset purchases), with updated rate guidance on rates to come in September, analysts at Lloyds said, and the bank believes that in the meantime, the evolution of data will be key to assessing risks to that central scenario: &ldquo;Should the current economic soft patch turn out to be longer lasting and/or if underlying inflation fails to move sustainably higher, then it is conceivable that there will be a delay to plans for a gradual withdrawal of policy stimulus. That could include an extension of asset purchases into 2019.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*RIKSBANK:</strong> It was a cautious meeting saw the central bank push back its estimate of when it will begin normalising policy, with the first rate hike now seen &ldquo;towards the end of the year&rdquo; (previously, guidance suggested that it would come in &ldquo;the second half of the year&rdquo;), as the profile of inflation weakness. The decision was not unanimous, and once again, Deputy governor Ohlsson dissented and called for an immediate 25bps hike. Analysts at Oxford Economics, however, maintain their view that the Riksbank will begin hiking in October after the ECB scales back its own asset purchases programme. OxEco also reminds us that the SEK currency&rsquo;s recent slide should help to lift inflation pressures into the latter part of the year, which will likely provide comfort for the dovish members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*DATA: US durables</strong> beat consensus, with almost all of the rise accredited to growing demand for volatile aircrafts, which saw order surging by 44.5% to a total value of USD 6.1bln in March. However, components were mixed; Core capital goods orders fell slightly, but the underlined trend was left unchanged. The worse news came from orders for non-defence capital goods ex-aircraft which after downward revisions for previous months, also saw a remarkable fall at this time round. This could be a sign that an increase in interest rates over the last six months is already having an impact on the market. Positive signals in the labour market from weekly <strong>jobless claims</strong> data, which fell to the lowest level since 1969. Ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s US GDP release, today saw the release of the advanced goods trade balance for the month of March which saw a better than forecasted fall in the deficit, -68.04B vs. Exp. -74.80B (Prev. -75.88B). Imports were down 2.1% with analysts seeing more room to the downside, whilst exports were up 2.5%, helped by a competitive greenback and by growing global trade flows. After the data, Barclays raised its US Q1 GDP tracker to 1.8% (from 1.5%) after the release of durables, advance and inventory data while Atlanta Fed GDPNow also came in unchanged at 2.0%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX +1.04% at 2667, NDX +2.08% at6650 , DJI +0.99% at 24322 SECTORS</strong>: Cons Cyclicals:&nbsp; +1.44%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.73%, Energy: +1.33%, Financials: +0.31%, Health Care: +1.28%, Industrials: -0.27%, Materials: +0.59%, Technology: +2.44%, Telecoms: -3.12%, Utilities: +1.00%. &nbsp;Equity futures carried on from yesterday&rsquo;s rebound and traded higher throughout most of Thursday&rsquo;s session with no real catalyst pushing stocks (though some observers noted that yields on 10-year Treasuries were under 3.00%). The S&amp;P 500 Emini was contained within the 2640-2670 range and only in later trade broke through the 2670, before falling back below that level. Technology was the leading sector today following decent earnings from Facebook (FB), which helped FAANG stocks, but some weakness was seen in Apple (AAPL) after another research note raising concerns about iPhone demand which caught further attention (Bernstein). The worst performing sector was Telecoms, closing lower than 3% after poor earnings from AT&amp;T (T) due to a loss in video subscribers as customers are moving to cheaper streaming services. CMG led the <strong>SPX</strong> today following a stellar earnings report, EPS reported $2.13 against the consensus $1.57, and revenues inline, the stronger report is being attributed to menu price increases it implemented a year ago. On the flip side LKQ Corp. (LKQ) pressured the index as EPS came in lower than consensus, but revenues did slightly beat, LKQ closed lower by c.17%. Earnings again showing the large movers in NDX today, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) outperforming the NDX among with Facebook (FB), ALXN beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line sending shares higher than 12% on Thursday. However, earnings from eBay (EBAY) and American Airlines (AAL) limited upside growth on Thursday for the index, and over in the DJI led by Visa&rsquo;s (V) earnings report.&nbsp;<strong>In M&amp;A news</strong>, SJW (SJW) was up by 10% after California a pre-market official offer of &nbsp;USD 1.9bln was made by California Water (CWT), a bid that was later said to be rejected by co. <strong>In other news</strong>, Kynikos&rsquo;s activist investor Jim Chanos reported a four-year short position on Tesla (TSLA), highlighting the automaker is seeing mass departure from executives and claiming CEO Elon Musk makes misstatements over production targets. He was also short on Dunkin Brands (DNKN), Restaurant Brands (QSR), Envision Healthcare (EVHC), Mednax (MD) whilst he had no position on Chipotle (CMG), Caterpillar (CAT) and no longer a short on Alibaba (BABA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI Crude futures settle higher by 14c at USD 68.19; Brent Crude Futures settle higher by 74c at USD 74.74. </strong>WTI saw weakness in afternoon trade after reports suggested that Genscape forecast a 1.3mln build for Cushing stocks from 20/Apr, and a build of 735k from 17/Apr. Some of WTI&#39;s gains were given back, and it helped Brent to outperform its US counterpart. With that said, crude has generally been supported by geopolitics, with the 12/May deadline approaching -- when the US will have to decide whether it will pull out of the Iran nuclear accord, or remain within the agreement, and waiver sanctions -- there is now a consensus building that Trump will pull-out (as hinted by French President Macron late on Wednesday) given that he has described the deal as &quot;terrible&quot; and there seem to be logistical obstacles in a) putting a fresh deal together by 12/May, and b) the opposition from Iran in ammending the terms of the deal. Meanwhile, the production outages in Venezuela continue to garner market attention, with output knocking around 1.5mln BPD vs levels around 2.5mln BPD two years ago, adding bullish support. Elsewhere on Wednesday, Angola&#39;s June crude exports are seen declining to 1.38mln BPD, which would be the lowest in more than seven years; in Asia, Chinese inventories of crude drew down by 2.4% MM in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES:</strong> <strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 7+ ticks higher at 119-10. </strong>Most of the Treasuries action was concentrated in the belly and long end of the curve with 10yr and 30yr yields falling by c.3bps, the former extending losses and pushing below 3% following the strong auction results. 2s10s and 2s30 widening by c.3bps and 5s10s and 5s30s by c.2bps. Today&rsquo;s auction of 7-year debt was solid, stopping through the screens by 0.6bps, and the yield was the highest since April 2010. The bid-to-cover of 2.56x was also well above recent averages and the highest since January. Primary dealers were awarded the smallest share since the beginning of 2018, directs&rsquo; coverage was in close proximity to recent averages whilst indirects, a proxy for foreign demand, took the largest portion since January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> <strong>GBP </strong>A sharp turnaround in the Pound has elevated Sterling to the top of the G10 pile, and in Cable this was said to be largely flow/order driven as models and algos flashed buy just under the 1.3900 level to push the pair all the back up near 1.4000, before coming back sitting just above 1.3900 while EURGBP retreated from 0.8750 to circa 0.8700. <strong>EUR</strong> The single currency saw volatile price action, albeit not as pronounced as Sterling, during ECB President Draghi&rsquo;s post-meeting press conference and Q&amp;A (after rates and QE size/guidance was left unchanged). <strong>EURUSD</strong> initially fell on his concession that economic activity has slowed and reiteration that underlying inflation remains subdued, but shorts were subsequently squeezed as he played down the growth moderation and maintained that prices are on track (with the aid of ongoing monetary accommodation) to reach target in the medium term. EURUSD knee-jerked down through key support around 1.2155 to sub-1.2150 before snapping back to just over 1.2200 ahead of massive (5+ bn) option expiries and then recoiling sharply again to new session lows breaking through 1.2100 in later trade. <strong>SEK </strong>The Krona was undermined by the Riksbank pushing back rate hike projections until late 2018 in response to weaker than forecast Swedish inflation developments, with <strong>EURSEK</strong> up to 8 year highs at one stage just over 10.4800, but then fading alongside the EUR in general. Note, Ohlsson dissented in favour of a hike to -0.25% from 0.50%, but this was largely shrugged off and a lone, outlying hawkish shout. DXY The index is ending the session firmer having dipped alongside US Treasury yields (10 year cash back below 3%) and probing earlier peaks circa 91.300 on a combination of EUR selling and perhaps belated buying in wake of a near clean sweep of US data beats (including weekly claims, headline durable goods and advanced trade). <strong>CHF/CAD</strong> The Franc and Loonie both look set to extend recent losses vs the USD as resistance/round numbers in USDCHF and USDCAD are breached at 0.9850 and 1.2850 respectively. <strong>JPY/AUD/NZD</strong> All flat and relatively resistant vs the Greenback after recent heavy losses around 109.30, 0.7550 and 0.7070, with the Kiwi awaiting NZ trade data and Jpy the BoJ for more independent impetus.</p>\r\n",

Some of WTI&#39;s gains were given back, and it helped Brent to outperform its US coutnerpart. With that said, crude has generally been supported by geopolitics, with the 12/May deadline approaching -- when the US will have to decide whether it will pull out of the Iran nuclear accord, or remain within the agreement, and waiver sanctions -- there is now a consensus building that Trump will pull-out (as hinted by French President Macron late on Wednesday) given that he has described the deal as &quot;terrible&quot; and there seem to be logistical obstacles in a) putting a fresh deal together by 12/May, and b) the opposition from Iran in ammending the terms of the deal. Meanwhile, the production outages in Venezuela continue to garner market attention, with output knocking around 1.5mln BPD vs levels around 2.5mln BPD two years ago, adding bullish support. Elsewhere on Wednesday, Anhola&#39;s June crude exports are seen declining to 1.38mln BPD, which would be the lowest in more than seven years; in Asia, Chinese inventories of crude drew down by 2.4% MM in March.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Net supply is implied at $3.6bln given that $109.4bln maturing at the mid-month settlement. Analysts also note that over the next month, gross supply (including next week&rsquo;s auction of $73blnin 3s, 10s, 30s) is around $169bln, with large cashflows due, estimated around $208bln. Traders are also cognizant of the Q2 refunding announcement on 2/May, where the US Treasury may raise the size of auction issuance, according to some analysts.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>7-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The previous 7s auction was not received well, tailing by a chunky 1.9bps &ndash; the largest at a 7s auction since Feb/2016. Cover was also weak, with foreigners taking down their smallest amount since December, while dealers took their largest share since Feb/2016. The latest positioning data indicates dealers are net long to the tuine of $8.6bln in the 6-7 year bucket, highs last seen in December. Analysts at Societe Generale say the current 7 trades cheap on both asset swap vs older 7s, as well as on the curve vs 5s and 10s. However, the bank holds a slightly positive bias heading into the auction, though it argues concession will be required, despite the set-up from a relative value perspective.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"344\" src=\"/system/ckeditor_assets/pictures/50/content_7s_auction.JPG\" width=\"800\" /></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A sharp turnaround in the Pound has elevated Sterling to the top of the G10 pile, and in Cable this was said to be largely flow/order driven as models and algos flashed buy just under the 1.3900 level to push the pair all the back up near 1.4000, while Eur/Gbp retreated from 0.8750 to circa 0.8700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency saw volatile price action, albeit not as pronounced as Sterling, during ECB President Draghi&rsquo;s post-meeting press conference and Q&amp;A (after rates and QE size/guidance was left unchanged). Eur/Usd initially fell on his concession that economic activity has slowed and reiteration that underlying inflation remains subdued, but shorts were subsequently squeezed as he played down the growth moderation and maintained that prices are on track (with the aid of ongoing monetary accommodation) to reach target in the medium term. Eur/Usd knee-jerked down through key support around 1.2155 to sub-1.2150 before snapping back to just over 1.2200 ahead of massive (5+ bn) option expiries and then recoiling sharply again to new session lows just above 1.2100 as the 100 DMA at 1.2210 held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Krona was undermined by the Riksbank pushing back rate hike projections until late 2018 in response to weaker than forecast Swedish inflation developments, with Eur/Sek up to 8 year highs at one stage just over 10.4800, but then fading alongside the Eur in general. Note, Ohlsson dissented in favour of a hike to -0.25% from 0.50%, but this was largely shrugged off and a lone, outlying hawkish shout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index is ending the session firmer having dipped alongside US Treasury yields (10 year cash back below 3%) and probing earlier peaks circa 91.300 on a combination of Eur selling and perhaps belated buying in wake of a near clean sweep of US data beats (including weekly claims, headline durable goods and advanced trade).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF/CAD </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc and Loonie both look set to extend recent losses vs the Usd as resistance/round numbers in Usd/Chf and Usd/Cad are breached at 0.9850 and 1.2850 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/AUD/NZD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All flat and relatively resistant vs the Greenback after recent heavy losses around 109.25, 0.7565 and 0.7070, with the Kiwi awaiting NZ trade data and Jpy the BoJ for more independent impetus.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>ISSUANCE:</strong> US Treasury will auction a total of $113bln this week ($32bln 2-year notes on Tuesday; $35bln 5-year notes on Wednesday; $17bln 2-year FRN on Wednesday; $29bln 7-year notes on Thursday. Net supply is implied at $3.6bln given that $109.4bln maturing at the mid-month settlement. Analysts also note that over the next month, gross supply (including next week&rsquo;s auction of $73blnin 3s, 10s, 30s) is around $169bln, with large cashflows due, estimated around $208bln. Traders are also cognizant of the Q2 refunding announcement on 2/May, where the US Treasury may raise the size of auction issuance, according to some analysts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The previous 7s auction was not received well, tailing by a chunky 1.9bps &ndash; the largest at a 7s auction since Feb/2016. Cover was also weak, with foreigners taking down their smallest amount since December, while dealers took their largest share since Feb/2016. The latest positioning data indicates dealers are net long to the tune of $8.6bln in the 6-7 year bucket, highs last seen in December. Analysts at Societe Generale say the current 7 trades cheap on both asset swap vs older 7s, as well as on the curve vs 5s and 10s. However, the bank holds a slightly positive bias heading into the auction, though it argues concession will be required, despite the set-up from a relative value perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"346\" src=\"/system/ckeditor_assets/pictures/46/content_7s_history.JPG\" width=\"800\" /></p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) was underpinned by recent JPY weakness and with Tokyo Electron the outperformer after its FY net firmly topped estimates, while the KOSPI (+1.1%) was the biggest gainer amid optimism ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s inter-Korean summit and after tech giant Samsung Electronics released its Q1 final results. Elsewhere, ASX 200 (-0.2%) was indecisive as Australia also reflected on the broad weakness during the prior day&rsquo;s holiday closure, while Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%) and Hang Seng (-1.0%) were downbeat amid the backdrop of rising money market rates and another substantial consecutive net liquidity drain of CNY 150bln by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were quiet with markets focused on earnings releases and amid a lack of Rinban announcement. Furthermore, the BoJ also kick-started its 2-day policy meeting today in which the central bank is expected to maintain policy settings, while focus would also be on the forecasts in the Outlook Report and whether there will be any changes to inflation estimates with the inclusion of the newly appointed Deputy Governors including known-reflationist Wakatabe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China MOFCOM repeated its opposition to unilateralism and protectionism, while it added that some Chinese firms have given up on the US market amid uncertainty. In other news, a China MIIT official said China is working on a significant tariff reduction for auto imports, while there were also reports that China is mulling lowering car import tariffs to 10% or 15% from the current 25%, with a decision possibly as early as next month (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 100bln via 7-day reverse repos, which resulted to a net daily drain of CNY 150bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3283 (Prev. 6.3066)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fitch affirmed Japan at A; outlook stable. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korean GDP Growth (Q1 P) Q/Q 1.1% vs. Exp. 1.1% (Prev. -0.2%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korean GDP Growth (Q1 P) Y/Y 2.8% vs. Exp. 2.9% (Prev. 2.8%) (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swedish Riksbank Rate (Apr) -0.50% vs. Exp. -0.50% (Prev. -0.50%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank assesses rate will begin to increase towards the end of the year which is somewhat later than forecast previously. Underlying inflation has been somewhat lower than expected recently, which raises questions regarding the strength of the development in inflation. Deputy Ohlsson dissented at keeping the interest rate unchanged, advocating a hike to -0.25%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korea said that President Moon will meet with North Korea leader Kim at the border on Friday at 0930 local time (0130 BST). In related news, there were also comments from a BoK official that any economic cooperation with North Korea will bolster South Korean consumer sentiment. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French President Macron said he thinks US President Trump will not want US to remain in Iran nuclear deal based on prior statements. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is said to issue a wish list of her trade demands for a Brexit trade deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May has held a cabinet meeting with Conservative Brexiteers whereby she was asked to stick to her plan of making a clean break from the EU. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US steel and aluminium tariffs could affect the EU from May (Handelsblatt)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acting leader of Italy&rsquo;s PD says import steps forward made on talks with 5-star, but still difficulties, to meet on May 3rd to discuss possible deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities (Eurostoxx 50+0.2%, DAX flat) trade with little in the way of firm direction as traders await today&#39;s ECB meeting (albeit fireworks expected from the event); IBEX (+0.4%) and FTSE MIB (+0.5%) outperform. Utilities showing strength (+0.9%) with the energy sector underperforming (-0.5%) following Shell earnings (-2.5%). Conversely with positive results for Total (+0.6%), Telefonica (+0.1%) and Volkswagen (+3%) but negative results for Deutsche Bank (+0.3%) and Roche (-0.1%%). Looking ahead for Shire at 12:00 today, which may give some indication on the Takeda news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A somewhat belated reaction to the Swedish Central Bank&rsquo;s change in forward guidance and dovish assessment of underlying inflation that is now seen delaying policy tightening to the end of 2018. There was dissent from Deputy Governor Ohlsson who wanted an immediate 25 basis point hike, but Eur/Sek eventually caught a bid to soak up offers at 10.4500 and the first batch of supply said to be residing between 10.4800-5000 from pre-Riksbank lows around or just under 10.3900. Krona now awaiting the 10.00BST press conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index continues to grind higher above the 91.000 level and eke out more fresh multi-month highs amidst widespread Dollar gains vs counterparts. 91.300 or so is the latest peak, as the DXY inches closer to then next upside technical targets circa 91.500 and then 91.750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF/GBP/CAD/NZD/AUD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All softer vs the Greenback, with Usd/Chf only a few pips below 0.9850 resistance, while Cable has breached the top of a support zone straddling 1.3900 to extend its sharp reversal from April highs (1.4377) and further undermine bullish seasonal dynamics, plus M&amp;A factors that had been boosting the Pound. Usd/Cad towards the upper end of a relatively tight 1.2825-60 range with overriding Dollar strength marginally outweighing Loonie support from near term NAFTA deal expectations. Nzd/Usd looking more vulnerable just above 0.7050 as the Aud/Nzd cross climbs over 1.0700 and Aud/Usd derives a degree of traction from above forecast Aussie export/import price data overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has survived a stern test of support vs the Usd around 1.2155 to trade back up near the top of its trading parameters (1.2190), awaiting fresh/independent impetus from the ECB and still gleaning some direction from mega 1.2200 option expiries that run off later today. Usd/Jpy firmer above 109.00 between 109.25-50 amidst latest month end rebalancing models indicating a Jpy sell signal and with the BoJ not seen altering its easy/dovish stance at the culmination of the 2-day meeting early Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dovish Riksbank is likely to have provided some indirect incentive, but market observers also note particularly large upside flows in US Treasuries, and some hefty clips in quick order from just above 119-00 in 10 year futures on the way up to new session highs. Bunds also saw more technical buying on a break of 157.91 once a chart gap was filled, and then short stops from those holding positions overnight around 157.94 on the run up to 158.04-08. However, this did not extend much further towards another upside objective at 158.30 with the rally fading at 158.12 (+40 ticks) as attention switches to the ECB that might not be so supportive for fixed. Elsewhere, Gilts have topped out at 121.32 (+29 ticks) and back to USTs the overnight peak in 10s is 119-07</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures sit in modest positive territory (albeit off best levels) broadly continuing yesterday&rsquo;s recovery. Prices remain firmer in spite of the latest DoE release which had an overall bearish impact on the market as traders continue to assess the plausibility of the US re-imposing sanctions upon Iran as well as declines in Venezuelan oil output. In metals markets, spot gold trades with little in the way of firm direction and in close proximity to 5-week lows as a firmer USD keeps a lid on gains for the precious metal. Elsewhere, aluminium has continued to face selling pressure in London amid the fallout from the latest updates for Rusal, whilst Chinese steel futures were supported overnight by domestic construction demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Looking ahead, highlights include, ECB&rsquo;s rate decision and press conference, US durables, weekly jobs, advanced goods trade balance and a slew of earnings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities (Eurostoxx 50+0.2%, DAX flat) trade with little in the way of firm direction as traders await today&#39;s ECB meeting (albeit fireworks expected from the event); IBEX (+0.4%) and FTSE MIB (+0.5%) outperform.&nbsp;Utilities showing strength (+0.9%) with the energy sector underperforming (-0.5%) following Shell earnings (-2.5%).&nbsp;Conversely with positive results for Total (+0.6%), Telefonica (+0.1%) and Volkswagen (+3%) but negative results for Deutsche Bank (+0.3%) and Roche (-0.1%%). Looking ahead for Shire at 12:00 today, which may give some indication on the Takeda news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A somewhat belated reaction to the Swedish Central Bank&rsquo;s change in forward guidance and dovish assessment of underlying inflation that is now seen delaying policy tightening to the end of 2018. There was dissent from Deputy Governor Ohlsson who wanted an immediate 25 basis point hike, but Eur/Sek eventually caught a bid to soak up offers at 10.4500 and the first batch of supply said to be residing between 10.4800-5000 from pre-Riksbank lows around or just under 10.3900. Krona now awaiting the 10.00BST press conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index continues to grind higher above the 91.000 level and eke out more fresh multi-month highs amidst widespread Dollar gains vs counterparts. 91.300 or so is the latest peak, as the DXY inches closer to then next upside technical targets circa 91.500 and then 91.750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP/CAD/NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All softer vs the Greenback, with Usd/Chf only a few pips below 0.9850 resistance, while Cable has breached the top of a support zone straddling 1.3900 to extend its sharp reversal from April highs (1.4377) and further undermine bullish seasonal dynamics, plus M&amp;A factors that had been boosting the Pound. Usd/Cad towards the upper end of a relatively tight 1.2825-60 range with overriding Dollar strength marginally outweighing Loonie support from near term NAFTA deal expectations. Nzd/Usd looking more vulnerable just above 0.7050 as the Aud/Nzd cross climbs over 1.0700 and Aud/Usd derives a degree of traction from above forecast Aussie export/import price data overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has survived a stern test of support vs the Usd around 1.2155 to trade back up near the top of its trading parameters (1.2190), awaiting fresh/independent impetus from the ECB and still gleaning some direction from mega 1.2200 option expiries that run off later today. Usd/Jpy firmer above 109.00 between 109.25-50 amidst latest month end rebalancing models indicating a Jpy sell signal and with the BoJ not seen altering its easy/dovish stance at the culmination of the 2-day meeting early Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dovish Riksbank is likely to have provided some indirect incentive, but market observers also note particularly large upside flows in US Treasuries, and some hefty clips in quick order from just above 119-00 in 10 year futures on the way up to new session highs. Bunds also saw more technical buying on a break of 157.91 once a chart gap was filled, and then short stops from those holding positions overnight around 157.94 on the run up to 158.04-08. However, this did not extend much further towards another upside objective at 158.30 with the rally fading at 158.12 (+40 ticks) as attention switches to the ECB that might not be so supportive for fixed. Elsewhere, Gilts have topped out at 121.32 (+29 ticks) and back to USTs the overnight peak in 10s is 119-07</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures sit in modest positive territory (albeit off best levels) broadly continuing yesterday&rsquo;s recovery. Prices remain firmer in spite of the latest DoE release which had an overall bearish impact on the market as traders continue to assess the plausibility of the US re-imposing sanctions upon Iran as well as declines in Venezuelan oil output. In metals markets, spot gold trades with little in the way of firm direction and in close proximity to 5-week lows as a firmer USD keeps a lid on gains for the precious metal. Elsewhere, aluminium has continued to face selling pressure in London amid the fallout from the latest updates for Rusal, whilst Chinese steel futures were supported overnight by domestic construction demand.</p>\r\n",

There was dissent from Deputy Governor Ohlsson who wanted an immediate 25 basis point hike, but Eur/Sek eventually caught a bid to soak up offers at 10.4500 and the first batch of supply said to be residing between 10.4800-5000 from pre-Riksbank lows around or just under 10.3900. Krona now awaiting the 10.00BST press conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index continues to grind higher above the 91.000 level and eke out more fresh multi-month highs amidst widespread Dollar gains vs counterparts. 91.300 or so is the latest peak, as the DXY inches closer to then next upside technical targets circa 91.500 and then 91.750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF/GBP/CAD/NZD/AUD </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All softer vs the Greenback, with Usd/Chf only a few pips below 0.9850 resistance, while Cable has breached the top of a support zone straddling 1.3900 to extend its sharp reversal from April highs (1.4377) and further undermine bullish seasonal dynamics, plus M&amp;A factors that had been boosting the Pound. Usd/Cad towards the upper end of a relatively tight 1.2825-60 range with overriding Dollar strength marginally outweighing Loonie support from near term NAFTA deal expectations. Nzd/Usd looking more vulnerable just above 0.7050 as the Aud/Nzd cross climbs over 1.0700 and Aud/Usd derives a degree of traction from above forecast Aussie export/import price data overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/JPY </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has survived a stern test of support vs the Usd around 1.2155 to trade back up near the top of its trading parameters (1.2190), awaiting fresh/independent impetus from the ECB and still gleaning some direction from mega 1.2200 option expiries that run off later today. Usd/Jpy firmer above 109.00 between 109.25-50 amidst latest month end rebalancing models indicating a Jpy sell signal and with the BoJ not seen altering its easy/dovish stance at the culmination of the 2-day meeting early Friday.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PRIMER: Riksbank's rate decision due at 0830BST/0230EDT on 26 April",
        "content": "<p>EXPECTATIONS:&nbsp;The central bank is expected to keep the repo rate unchanged at 0.50% on Thursday. TD Securities argues that the market is pricing a dovish outcome at the April meeting, with focus falling mostly on what will be said on the size of its first rate hike, which has not been subject of public discussions yet. Some are expecting the&nbsp;Riksbank&nbsp;to tweak its current guidance after weakness in recent inflation data, which only hinted at mild price pressures building in the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>INFLATION:&nbsp;in Q1, the central bank had pencilled in a rate of inflation around 1.7%, but the Q1 data came in at 1.5% in January, and remained at that level. Growth forecasts may also be revised lower, as business surveys continued to indicate softer economic conditions with a 7% drop in house prices in the March-August period weighing on the narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OUTLOOK:&nbsp;Analysts at Capital Economics are confident that rate rises will still be forthcoming in 2018: &ldquo;The&nbsp;Riksbank&rsquo;s previous guidance was consistent with either two interest rate increases of around 10bps in July and September or a 25bp rise in September,&rdquo; CapEco says. Analysts at Nordea, however, sees the first-rate hike coming slightly later (in Q4 2019) and expects the repo rate to be at -0.25% by the end of 2019, and argue that the&nbsp;Riksbank&nbsp;will most likely move in synchronisation with the ECB.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MARKET REACTION:&nbsp;The Riskbank&rsquo;s previous forecasts were based on the krona being relatively unchanged, however, since the last meeting (14/Feb) it has weakened, with EURSEK moving from 9.9042 to around 10.42). Barclays believes that if the&nbsp;Riksbank&nbsp;kept the rate path unchanged, it would signal some normalisation in H2 2018, and that give some support to the SEK. TD Securities suggests that a dovish market reaction will likely be seen if the&nbsp;Riksbank&nbsp;hinted at initial rate hikes between 10-12bps, while a more hawkish response would come in the event of a 25bps rate hikes signal.</p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) is underpinned by recent JPY weakness and with Tokyo Electron outperforming after FY net firmly topped estimates, while the KOSPI (+1.4%) is the biggest gainer amid optimism ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s inter-Korean summit and after tech giant Samsung Electronics released its Q1 final results. Elsewhere, ASX 200 (-0.1%) is indecisive as Australia also reflects on the broad weakness during the prior day&rsquo;s holiday closure, while Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) and Hang Seng (-0.8%) are downbeat amid the backdrop of rising money market rates and another substantial consecutive net liquidity drain of CNY 150bln by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action is relatively quiet which has provided the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts some reprieve from the recent losses. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD are off lows but remain below the 1.2200 and 1.4000 handles respectively, while USD/JPY maintains a firm footing above 109.00 after being fuelled by USD strength and the improved risk tone during US trade. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies are mixed with AUD and CAD mildly supported after WTI crude reclaimed USD 68.00/bbl, while NZD languishes on cross-related flows as AUD/NZD extended on upside after support held at 1.0700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are quiet with markets focused on earnings releases and amid a lack of Rinban announcement. Furthermore, the BoJ also kick starts its 2-day policy meeting today in which the central bank is expected to maintain policy settings, while focus would also be on the forecasts in the Outlook Report and whether there will be any changes to inflation estimates with the inclusion of the newly appointed Deputy Governors including known-reflationist Wakatabe.</p>\r\n",
