An OPEC source, in response to the US exit from the pact, noted Saudi has enough oil production to keep oil markets stable, but will not act singlehandedly to offset a possible shortage as any decision to adjust output should be driven by a potential physical shortage or reduction in production from any supply source, not Iran.

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index has pulled back from latest new 2018 peaks a few points over 93.400 to sub-93.000 levels, with Dollar pairings retracing recent moves, or consolidating, with the notable exception of Usd/Jpy that remains bid over 109.50. Sub-forecast US PPI and wholesale inventories/sales also weighing along with general profit-taking, assuming the tide is not turning completely for the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie is leading broader G10 recovery gains vs the Greenback (while the Lira is outperforming in the EM area, albeit with the aid of official intervention and still awaiting news from a Government and CBRT meeting on the Try and economy) on the back of sharply higher crude prices post-confirmation of the US exiting from the Iranian nuclear deal, and on a decent Canadian data beat (building approvals). Usd/Cad has reversed from 1.3000 peaks posted just 24 hours ago to sub-1.2900 and may re-test support around 1.2850 that also coincides/aligns with the 50 DMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both circa 0.3% ahead against the retreating Usd, with Cable rebounding a full big figure at best to 1.3600, while the Kiwi has almost recovered the 0.7000 handle amidst supportive cross flows (Jpy and to a lesser extent Aud). Looking ahead, RBNZ and BoE policy meetings could provide the next independent drivers for the Nzd and Pound, and especially the UK&rsquo;s MPC on super Thursday that comes with the latest QIR &ndash; full previews available via our Research Suite in the Central Bank section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/EUR/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrowly mixed vs the Dollar, but off worst levels, with Aud/Usd looking more comfortable above 0.7450 against the backdrop of firmer oil/commodities, while Eur/Usd survived a test of demand ahead of 1.1800 at a fresh ytd low around 1.1825 to squeeze back up towards 1.1900 where a very large (2 bn) option expiry rolls off tomorrow. The Franc is marginally underperforming within a 1.0000-50 range vs the Usd and Eur/Chf back over 1.1900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both largely shrugged off mixed CPI (headline and core) data to extend recent rallies, and with the Sek outpacing its Scandi neighbour on Swedish stock dividend day &ndash; Eur/Sek down to 10.3170 and Eur/Nok to 9.5660 approximately at various stages.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.2%) was kept afloat as energy names coat-tailed on the upside in oil, although gains were limited by weakness in financials after Australia&rsquo;s largest lender CBA reported earnings. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) failed to benefit from JPY weakness and traded subdued, in which electricity names took a power dive on the higher input costs, while both Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) and Hang Seng (+0.5%) were initially weaker after a daily net liquidity drain by the PBoC and the verbal spat between US and China envoys at the WTO.

Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful despite the cautious risk tone and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for over JPY 1tln in 1yr-10yr JGBs.

This comes amidst broad-based Greenback gains, albeit with Turkey&rsquo;s beleaguered Lira regaining some poise on increased efforts by the CBRT to stem the tide via direct intervention and ahead of a midday (BST) meeting between the PM and Economy Ministry to discuss currency market developments and the overall state of the economy (Usd/Try back below 4.3000 from 4.3700+ at one stage).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest G10 loser as the Buck extends its winning streak, with reaction to US President Trump&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear accord and threat of severe sanctions largely confined to crude that has spiked higher, and limited risk-aversion or contagion thus far. Hence, Usd/Jpy as bounced firmly from sub-109.00 lows above 109.50 and towards recent peaks just above 110.00, with the 200 DMA and a key Fib (around 110.19 and 110.24 respectively) also lying in wait beyond the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both around 0.2-0.25% lower vs the Usd, and with the former at risk of losing 0.7400+ status, while the latter is revisiting highs within a 1.0000-50 band despite the Franc maintaining momentum vs the Eur below 1.1900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet more bearish fundamentals (via Italian and French data misses) to compound the positional and Dollar related downside for the single currency below 1.1850, and having relinquished 1.1900 on Tuesday there is little in the way of technical support before 1.1800 aside from a late December 2017 low (1.1812), though the round number may offer some sentimental respite given that a major Fib sits just below (1.1790).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/GBP/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All holding up relatively well in the face of almost relentless Usd buying (or net daily advances at least), with the Kiwi above 0.6950 ahead of the RBNZ policy gathering tonight and amidst some Nzd/Jpy buy-stops tripped overnight by algos. Cable is keeping afloat of 1.3500 before BoE &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday as Gbp/Jpy rebounds sharply and further over 148.00 and Eur/Gbp retreats to sub-0.8750, while the Loonie is deriving support from oil prices at fresh post-2014 peaks to ease back from yesterday&rsquo;s near 1.3000 highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scandi Crowns showed scant reaction to Swedish and Norwegian inflation reports that were in line or slightly softer overall, with the Sek actually extending gains vs the Eur and Nok on tax payment deadline day (former pair as low as 10.4130).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The catalysts are pretty well defined and wide-ranging from supply to oil-fuelled inflation on US-Iran discord, and the technical landscape is also becoming more negative as Bunds edge close to a major chart support level at a fresh Eurex intraday low of 158..52 (-33 ticks on the day) and Gilts breach their nearest downside objective, albeit just and not yet convincingly at 121.67 (-47 ticks). In fact, although Gilts are still lagging on the day, futures briefly gleaned more support on supply grounds vs Bunds as the DMO&rsquo;s 10 year tap was relatively well received vs Germany&rsquo;s 2048 offering that only drew enough bids to cover around 2/3rd of the total amount, and then only just. The respective 10 year debt futures are now circa 36 ticks and &frac14; point below previous settlement levels, but 11 and 8 ticks off worst levels. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are just a few ticks off overnight session lows and the curve is steeper as long bond losses approach one full point and the 10 year yield sits firmly at 3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices have continued upwards on Wednesday after President Trump confirmed the withdrawal of the US from the Iran nuclear agreement and imposing of sanctions on the nation; WTI and Brent June &rsquo;18 futures at USD 71.00 (+2.8%) and USD 76.89 (+2.7%) respectively. Said sanctions could lead to the reduction of oil exports by 200-500k BPD over the next 6 months for the middle-eastern nation, according to UBS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold prices have continued the slide seen on Tuesday (-0.58%), as the USD held strong on higher treasury yields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copper currently up 0.4% at USD 6773.50/tonne as Chinese demand remains strong.

        "content": "<p>UK debt futures and the STIR strip are taking their cues from bearish counterparts despite more downbeat domestic survey impulses (via BRC sales and REC employment overnight) that should further underpin market expectations for no change in rates by the BoE tomorrow. Gilts have lost grip of the 122.00 handle after an initial print of 122.03 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 122.14 Liffe close and have been down to 121.82, as Bunds extend their losses to 29 ticks at 158.56, while 3 month contracts are 1-2 ticks adrift. Chart-wise, the 10 year UK benchmark is eyeing 121.70 next on the downside, while the core Eurozone bond has 158.43 in sight, and in cash terms yields are firmer in line with US Treasuries as 3% trades in advance of the refunding, DMO auction and long-end German supply.</p>\r\n",

Trump added that the deal should never have been made and has allowed Iran to continue to enrich uranium, while he stated the US is to be ready, willing and able to renegotiate a deal with Iran. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Department said oil related sanctions on Iran are to be re-imposed in 180 days and US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that effectively sanctions will be going into place immediately. Furthermore, Mnuchin also commented that the US will be working with allies on a comprehensive deal and that firms can seek waivers or special licences to operate in Iran. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French President Macron noted that France will work collectively on a broader framework, covering nuclear activity, the post-2025 period, ballistic activity, and stability in the Middle-East, notably Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. Furthermore, there were also comments by EU&rsquo;s Mogherimi that the EU vows to uphold Iran nuclear accord despite Trump&rsquo;s decision. (Twitter/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran&#39;s leader Rouhani said Iran is committed to its own and confirmed that Iran will continue the nuclear deal with members of the P5+1 even without US, while Rouhani added he is ready to resume nuclear work following talks with EU members of the deal. (State TV/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was volatility in crude prices with the rumour mill rife in the hours leading to the announcement. WTI crude initially fell around USD 2 to below USD 68/bbl amid CNN reports that US President Trump is to announce new sanctions against Iran and will not withdraw from the deal. However, the weakness was then pared on conflicting reports that President Trump decided to pull-out of the agreement which was later confirmed and underpinned WTI crude back above USD 70/bbl.

ASX 200 (+0.2%) was kept afloat as energy names coat-tailed on the upside in oil, although gains were limited by weakness in financials after Australia&rsquo;s largest lender CBA reported earnings. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) failed to benefit from JPY weakness and traded subdued, in which electricity names took a power dive on the higher input costs, while both Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) and Hang Seng (+0.5%) were initially weaker after a daily net liquidity drain by the PBoC and the verbal spat between US and China envoys at the WTO. However, Chinese markets later recovered with Hong Kong leading the rebound as money market rates eased, in which the 1-month HIBOR declined for a 6th consecutive session. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful despite the cautious risk tone and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for over JPY 1tln in 1yr-10yr JGBs. This was amid gains in yields which tracked upside in their US counterparts with the US 10yr yield homing in again on the 3.000% level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 60bln via 7-day and CNY 40bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily drain of CNY 100bln.

Lords also backed an amendment to remove the Brexit date of 29 March 2019 from the legislation. (Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eurosceptic ministers are reported to be worried that UK PM May could bypass her Brexit war cabinet and ask the full cabinet for support regarding a customs partnership with the EU.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD was firmer with the DXY above the 93.00 level and at a fresh YTD high amid rising US yields. This dampened price action across its major counterparts, while the PBoC also weakened its reference rate in response. USD/JPY was higher after support at the 109.00 level eventually held and amid cross-related flows in which GBP/JPY reclaimed the 148.00 handle and with algo-short covering said to have been triggered in NZD/JPY. Elsewhere, AUD and NZD lacked any substantial drivers with the latter subdued ahead of today&rsquo;s RBNZ policy meeting, in which expectations are one-sided for no change in rates and with the scope for tighter policy also restricted by ongoing soft inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed with crude prices ultimately higher after President Trump confirmed the withdrawal of the US from the Iran nuclear agreement which helped oil recover from the initial rumour-triggered volatility, with WTI crude futures back above USD 70/bbl while Brent crude gained around 2% to move closer to USD 77/bbl. Elsewhere, gold prices declined as the greenback held firm and copper was flat alongside an indecisive risk tone in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly Crude Stocks (4 May) -1.850M vs. Exp. -0.700M (Prev. +3.427M).

The 5yr yield was up by c.3bps, the 2yr and 10yr yields were higher by c.2bps. The Treasury auctioned USD 31bln in 3yr notes with a tail of 0.1bps. The yield came in at 2.664%, the highest since May 2007. Dealers were left with the largest proportion of the issuance at 42.2%, well above the 6-auction average. Directs were awarded 12.3% and indirect 14.6%, the smallest portion since July 2016. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 5+ ticks lower at 119-16+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade indecisive after a lacklustre lead from Wall St and as markets digest US President Trump&rsquo;s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement which in turn underpinned oil prices. ASX 200 (Unch) is just about kept afloat with energy names benefiting from the upside in oil, although gains are limited by weakness in financials after Australia&rsquo;s largest lender CBA reported earnings in which it noted a slight decline in group net interest margin and that underlying operating expenses were higher due to provisions. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) is subdued and fails to benefit from JPY weakness with electricity names taking a power dive on the higher input costs, while both Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (Unch) are also uninspiring after a substantial daily net liquidity drain by the PBoC and the verbal spat between US and China envoys at the WTO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD is firmer with the DXY above the 93.00 level and at a fresh YTD high amid rising US yields, which has dampened price action across its major counterparts and the PBoC also weakened its reference rate in response. USD/JPY is higher after support at the 109.00 level eventually held and amid cross-related flows in which GBP/JPY reclaimed the 148.00 handle and with algo-short covering said to have been triggered in NZD/JPY. Elsewhere, AUD and NZD lack any substantial drivers with the latter subdued ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s RBNZ policy meeting, in which expectations are one-sided for no change in rates and with the scope for tighter policy also restricted by ongoing soft inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lacklustre and have failed to benefit from the cautious risk tone and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for over JPY 1tln in 1yr-10yr JGBs. This is amid gains in yields which track upside in their US counterparts with the US 10yr yield homing in again on the 3.000% level.</p>\r\n",
