In response, Italian PM Conte&rsquo;s office reportedly said Italy wants constructive dialogue with the EU whilst Deputy PM Salvini said they will not backtrack on their budget plans, despite market pressure. In later comments, Italy&rsquo;s European Affairs Minister Savona stressed that no one in the government wants to leave the EU noting that if growth does not go as well as expected next year the government will hike public investments. Also, ECB&#39;s Villeroy commented on Italy stating &ldquo;you could judge Italian debt as too risky, Italian mix of high debt and weak growth is unbalanced&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The RTE reported on Monday the European Commission will not formally adopt a draft text on UK relationship on Wednesday when EU Brexit Negotiator Barnier was scheduled to present the draft political declaration to EU commissioners and ambassadors. RTE Journalist Tony Connelly noted this could be because &ldquo;things are being so sensitive ahead of next weeks&rsquo; EU summit that all sides go into a blackout to avoid leaks and eruptions&rdquo;. A UK PM May Spokesman reported that the Northern Irish backstop proposal will be published in due course and there is no precise date, adding that the EU still needs to move its position in negotiations. As a reminder, on Tuesday the UK Cabinet meeting takes place (Brexit not formally listed on draft agenda).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> An official reported the US Treasury is concerned about recent CNY depreciation and are monitoring developments; he has also said they are willing to talk to China on trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed&#39;s Bullard (Non-Voter, Dove) said now at a good level of rates and he does not think rates will have to rise much more to contain inflation. He added now have entered lower end of neutral estimates for rates and must decide whether to go further; he believes the US needs quicker productivity growth to maintain GDP growth rates. On the December rate meeting, he noted data is looking good today but let&#39;s see when the meeting comes around. He also stressed the Fed is watching international developments and he is concerned they will feed back to the US economy. He noted both China and the US seem to be digging in and he would like to see both sides come to the table he adds that new North American trade agreement sends the message that trade wars can be settled. He also noted the dot plot model for forecasting interest rate expectations isn&#39;t perfect. Finally, he indicated the long term US rate rise provides room on the issue of the yield curve, which is a welcome development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Knot said overall inflation has been above our definition of price stability for several months; Euro area inflation outlook unaffected by Italy thus far. He added the ECB could say something about the possible number of interest rate hikes per year, like the Fed does. He sees no reason to feel uncomfortable with market expectations for 2-3 years app reinvestments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.01% at 2885, NDX -0.62% at 7353, DJI +0.16% at 26488.

General Electric (GE) caught a bid on the back of an upgrade at Barclays, echoing recent new CEO optimism. Conagra Brands (CAG) also benefitted on an upgrade at UBS. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) was another top mover after a price target rise at RBC Capital. Mid-session saw the announcement that De Shaw is joining Continental Grain&rsquo;s push for change at Bunge Limited (BG) giving the stock a push upward. Tech stocks took the biggest hit today with names like Salesforce.Com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY) down significantly. Morgan Stanley cut casino revenue estimates for the Macau region, stocks hit included Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM). Apple (AAPL) was also down on the day, keeping indexes and the tech sector down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 0.05 LOWER AT USD 74.29/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.25 LOWER AT USD 83.91/BBL.</strong> Brent and WTI were both on the defensive on Monday, with traders continuing to cite last week&#39;s news that the US could potentially grant waivers to certain buyers of Iranian crude. &quot;While no specifics on waivers have yet been discussed, anything that allows more Iranian crude to find its way into global markets will be perceived as negative for oil in the near term,&quot; UBS said, &quot;markets are still tight and spare capacity is still limited, but it is understandable that oil prices have pulled back while we await additional details on how extensive sanctions waivers might be.&quot; Additionally, last week&#39;s talk of the Saudis and Russians being able to ramp production to offset export declines in Iran continues to be cited. At the margin, a stronger dollar on Monday did little to help the crude complex. In energy specific news, a fire was reported at the Irving&#39;s St John refinery in Canada (300k BPD) which lent some positive ticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) UNCHNAGED AT 117-23+.</strong> Treasury futures mirrored action seen in Bunds on Monday amid thin volume; the complex drifted higher as European traders got to their desks given concern expressed by the EU Commission on Italy&rsquo;s budget plan whilst actions remained limited in US trade. Note due to public holiday the cash treasury market was closed for Columbus Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The index and broad Usd have rebounded further from last Friday&rsquo;s post-NFP lows, albeit not uniformly as the safer-havens are bucking the trend, but enough to nudge the DXY back up towards 96.000. Market holidays in Japan and the US ahead (latter only partial) may have exacerbated price action/moves, but it&rsquo;s certainly been a risk-off return from Golden Week in China and the Italian budget issue continues weigh on investor sentiment. Back to the Dollar, or rather the index, and beyond the big figure last week&rsquo;s peak was 96.124.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Losing against the USD as oil prices retreat to compound the overall downturn in risk sentiment, and the Loonie retreating below 1.3000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>The next major underperformers, and both losing grip of round numbers/psychological handles in relatively quick order amidst stops and the aforementioned bearish factors. The single currency is under 1.1500 and Cable sub-1.3100, but the former is holding above decent option expiry interest at 1.1450 (1.5 bn) and the latter has regained some poise having tested 1.3050 stops, with Brexit impulses still supportive on balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>A clean break of stops at 113.50, and chart supports at 113.56/113.42 (Tenkan and Fib respectively) has propelled the Jpy up to almost 113.25 at one point vs the Greenback as the more attractive currency of the pairing during periods of pronounced risk aversion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD, CHF:</strong> All narrowly mixed vs the Usd, as the Kiwi and Aud pair some losses off fresh lows circa 0.6425 and 0.7040 respectively, while the Franc remains capped ahead of 0.9900, albeit bouncing firmly through 1.1400 against the Eur.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM:</strong> A bit of a mixed bag in terms of performance across the region, with the Rand hit hard after rumours/reports that SA Finance Minister may quit, but the Lira holding up better vs a strong Dollar ahead of the Government&rsquo;s inflation combating measures due to be announced on Tuesday. Similarly, the Peso is benefiting from pre-positioning before the Real re-opens after Sunday&rsquo;s Brazilian election and a bigger than anticipated 1st round victory by Bolsonaro. However, the Rouble has been undermined by a retreat in Brent and unable to reap the reward of speculation that US sanctions may be less harsh after mid-term elections. Usd/Zar around 14.8500, Usd/Try near 6.1600, Usd/Mxn close to 18.8300 and Usd/Rub hovering just under 67.0000.</p>\r\n",

At the margin, a stronger dollar on Monday did little to help the crude complex. In energy specific news, a fire was reported at the Irving&#39;s St John refinery in Canada (300k BPD) which lent some positive ticks.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending earlier losses and now at the bottom of the G10 pile, as the single currency stumbles on latest EU worries over Italy&rsquo;s budget and defiance from Rome, while in contrast more positive overtures from the EU on Brexit amidst reports of anywhere checks for exports to Ireland do not seem to be welcomed by the UK that still has reservations on outstanding borders issues. Eur/Usd retreated further from 1.1500+ levels to breach the prior October low (1.1464) and September&rsquo;s base, but just held above hefty option expiries at the 1.1450 strike (1.5 bn), while Cable took out stops around 1.3050 before finding some underlying bids ahead of daily chart support at 1.3013 around 1.3030.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie found some traction alongside crude to bounce from 1.3010 lows vs its US peer, but remained weak overall and still well off last Friday&rsquo;s post-Canadian employment report peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major outperformer due to broad risk aversion that started overnight in Asia with the return of Chinese markets from Golden Week and sharp slides in stocks, the Yuan and contagion (Nikkei aside given Japan&rsquo;s holiday). Usd/Jpy saw stops triggered on a break of 113.50 after failing to hold above 113.56 (Tankan level) and then breached 113.42 (Fib) on the way to almost 113.00, while Eur/Jpy took out 130.00, eventually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The antipodean Dollars both survived further pressure amidst the ongoing US-China/global trade stand-off to rebound off new lows for the recent slide circa 0.7040 and 0.6425 vs their US counterpart, as the CNH also pared some losses on reports that the US Treasury is worried about Yuan weakness and is keeping an eye on developments. Note, the PBoC sent the Usd/Cny midpoint at 6.8957 overnight vs 6.8792 ahead of Golden Week and Usd/Cnh rallied to 6.9370 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Monday&rsquo;s EU session relatively flat vs the Usd and within a fairly tight 0.9910-45 range with little independent impetus for the Franc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brl was buoyed by the stronger than predicted showing from Bolsonaro at the weekend Brazilian election that puts him in poll position for the second round on October 28th, albeit not certain to prevail vs his main rival. However, the Real rallied more than 3% at best towards 3.7100 vs the Usd in marked contrast to the Rand that encountered bearish domestic political impulses via press speculation about the potential resignation of SA Finance Minister Nene (subsequently played down by President Ramaphosa&rsquo;s office, but not categorically denied). Usd/Zar off highs just over 14.9800, but still some 0.5% ahead on the day. Elsewhere, Usd/Try also on the retreat, from circa 6.1900 to fresh lows form the day near 6.1140 and eagerly awaiting inflation-fighting measures from the Government due tomorrow.</p>\r\n",

At the very most it&#39;ll be an annotated paper (headings, no text) and even then it won&#39;t be adopted Wed</li>\r\n  <li>This is all due to the &quot;tunnel&quot; factor, ie things being so sensitive ahead of next weeks EU summit that all sides go into a blackout to avoid leaks + eruptions. The next step is the UK&#39;s backstop proposals but even that will be teased out in talks rather than formal publication</li>\r\n  <li>Both the EU + UK may decide to try and nail down the Withdrawal Agreement first, then focus on the Political Declaration between the Oct + Nov summits, but that has an obvious disadvantage for the UK...</li>\r\n  <li>London would like to use the PD for leverage: ie, we won&#39;t agree to the backstop, unless we like what&#39;s in the Political Declaration. It also means that the WA, including the backstop, wd have to survive intense scrutiny in the UK in the weeks between the two summits...</li>\r\n  <li>Either way, both big elements will be hard to &quot;digest&quot; if the EU + UK try to get both over the line ahead of next Wed/Thurs, hence no major publications this week. Instead it wll all be about &quot;tunnel&quot; discussions (Olly Robbins is though to be in Brussels for same).</li>\r\n  <li>Much hinges on the UK backstop proposals and what they mean by a UK-wide customs backstop. Member states want to be helpful, but need detail. April 29 Negotiating Guidelines refer to &quot;unique circumstances&quot; on island of Ireland, so that&#39;s already a marker against UK-wide</li>\r\n  <li>The French are said to have an &quot;open mind&quot; but won&#39;t agree to any proposal that undermines the integrity of the single market and the EU&#39;s autonomy on decision making. Either way, &quot;tentative&quot; is the watch word on all fronts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Similarly, the Peso is benefiting from pre-positioning before the Real re-opens after Sunday&rsquo;s Brazilian election and a bigger than anticipated 1st round victory by Bolsonaro. However, the Rouble has been undermined by a retreat in Brent and unable to reap the reward of speculation that US sanctions may be less harsh after mid-term elections.

This also comes amid the possibility of a Saudi-Kuwaiti oil field restart and further confirmation by Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih that 1.3mln BPD of spare capacity can be used &ldquo;if needed&rdquo;. This has increased the possibility of rising supply to the oil market, and pushed both Brent and WTI down by over 1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In metals markets, gold has broken through the USD 1200/OZ level to the downside as the yellow metal is being hit by a stronger dollar. Aluminium prices are also in the red, with prices falling by over 4%, after a Brazilian court ruled that Norsk hydro&rsquo;s aluminium plant may be reopened, albeit at a lower production level.

Elsewhere, shallower and tamer moves in Gilts and US Treasuries, but in line with German bonds as the former advanced to 120.04 (+32 ticks) on Liffe and the latter rebounded to new overnight session highs.

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index and broad Usd have rebounded further from last Friday&rsquo;s post-NFP lows, albeit not uniformly as the safer-havens are bucking the trend, but enough to nudge the DXY back up towards 96.000. Market holidays in Japan and the US ahead (latter only partial) may have exacerbated price action/moves, but it&rsquo;s certainly been a risk-off return from Golden Week in China and the Italian budget issue continues weigh on investor sentiment. Back to the Dollar, or rather the index, and beyond the big figure last week&rsquo;s peak was 96.124.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest G10 loser as oil prices retreat to compound the overall downturn in risk sentiment, and the Loonie retreats to 1.3000 vs its US counterpart, eyeing a couple of tech levels just above (1.3013 and 1.3018) having failed to derive any lasting support from Canadian jobs data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next major underperformers, and both losing grip of round numbers/psychological handles in relatively quick order amidst stops and the aforementioned bearish factors. The single currency is under 1.1500 and Cable sub-1.3100, but the former is holding above decent option expiry interest at 1.1450 (1.5 bn) and the latter has regained some poise having tested 1.3050 stops, with Brexit impulses still supportive on balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A clean break of stops at 113.50, and chart supports at 113.56/113.42 (Tenkan and Fib respectively) has propelled the Jpy up to almost 113.25 vs the Greenback as the more attractive currency of the pairing during periods of pronounced risk aversion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Usd, as the Kiwi and Aud pair some losses off fresh lows circa 0.6425 and 0.7040 respectively, while the Franc remains capped ahead of 0.9900, albeit bouncing firmly through 1.1400 against the Eur. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bit of a mixed bag in terms of performance across the region, with the Rand hit hard after rumours/reports that SA Finance Minister may quit, but the Lira holding up better vs a strong Dollar ahead of the Government&rsquo;s inflation combating measures due to be announced on Tuesday. Similarly, the Peso is benefiting from pre-positioning before the Real re-opens after Sunday&rsquo;s Brazilian election and a bigger than anticipated 1st round victory by Bolsonaro. However, the Rouble has been undermined by a retreat in Brent and unable to reap the reward of speculation that US sanctions may be less harsh after mid-term elections. Usd/Zar around 14.8500, Usd/Try near 6.1600, Usd/Mxn close to 18.8300 and Usd/Rub hovering just under 67.0000.</p>\r\n",

To recap, the US-China trade rift rumbles on and even though the PBoC cut its RRR again, stocks have been hit hard and the Yuan is weakening towards prior intervention levels, on top of the budget angst between Rome and Brussels. Hence, core or safe haven debt are benefiting from a grinding bid to test resistance levels in Bunds and Gilts ahead of 158.00 and 120.00 respectively, and a similar pattern is evolving in FX where the broad Usd, Jpy and Chf are outperforming vs the likes of the Gbp, Eur and commodity bloc/high beta currencies.</p>\r\n",

Senior Tories say they have been in private contact with a number of Labour MPs over several months.

Selling was seen following a decent labour market report which showed wages ticking up in September. Many parts of the curves hit fresh multi-year highs. FOMC voter John Williams said the yield curve flattening did not portend a recession, and sees inflation rising further, which helped yields crawl higher. Major curve spreads were wider at settlement by between 1-3bps.

ASX 200 (-1.0%) is weighed on by financial names following ANZ&rsquo;s profit warning which dragged the likes of CBA, WBC and NAB lower in sympathy, while KOSPI (+0.2%) erased initial losses following positive developments in the Korean peninsula and Nikkei 225 is closed due to a public holiday. &nbsp;Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch) is flat after having opened in the green as the index takes the breather from last week&rsquo;s losses and Shanghai Comp. (-2.00%) underperforms as mainland China plays catch-up as participants re-enter the market after a week-long holiday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are choppy with the dollar fluctuating between gains and losses, albeit trading in a tight range. EUR/USD and GBP/USD trade flat, above the 1.1500 and 1.3100 levels respectively, while MXN acted as a proxy to the BRL during the Brazilian Election exit polls where &ldquo;market friendly&rdquo; Bolsorano won the first round but failed to get an outright win, hence there will be a runoff election between himself and Haddad on October 28th. &nbsp;Elsewhere, JPY continues to weaken with the currency eyeing 114.00 to the upside against the greenback.</p>\r\n",
