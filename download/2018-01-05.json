        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: Stocks print fresh highs despite NFP miss",
        "content": "<p><strong>NONFARM PAYROLLS: Headline miss, AHE in line</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dollar sank, and Treasuries were heavily bid after December&rsquo;s nonfarm payrolls data missed expectations. Equities fell, though were more resilient, paring back the knee-jerk losses post the data release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the headline was a miss, the average hourly earnings data were in line with expectations, and do little to shift the Fed hike narrative. Indeed, many analysts expect that, as the US makes further ground in full-employment territory, headline payroll growth will slow, and many think that as that happens, wage pressures will be stoked. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FEDSPEAK: Harker, Mester, Bullard made comments on Friday</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Mester (voter): Mester would be happy with three/four hikes in 2018 (the FOMC&rsquo;s &lsquo;dots&rsquo; look for three hikes). She was encouraged by the &ldquo;strong&rdquo; US Employment Situation Report for December, and argued that the economic expansion was firmly in place. Mester sees inflation rising to target in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Harker (non-voter): The dollar eased slightly after 2017 voter Harker said that two rate hikes would be appropriate in 2018 (the &lsquo;dots&rsquo; have pencilled in three hikes). The comments were surprising given that Harker was previously considered one of the hawkish members of the FOMC; he cited the lack of wages pressure as a reason for his caution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Bullard (non-voter): Bullard repeated his recent view that the Fed should &#39;wait and see&#39; regarding further rate hikes, arguing that the central bank has made no progress towards inflation since 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +0.7% at 2,742; DJI +0.8% at 25,284; NDX +1.0% at 6,550</strong><br />Top performing sectors: IT +1.1%, Healthcare +0.9%, Materials +0.8%<br />Bottom performing sectors: Energy -0.1%, Utilities 0.0%, Telecoms 0.0%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity traders were happy to look through the headline weakness in the Employment Situation Report, with S&amp;P 500 eminis finishing positive every day this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tech lead the advance. Energy lagged, however, tracking crude prices, after traders took profits on the black stuff following the recent rally in prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is expected that trade may pick up next week as earnings season gets underway, and the big banks begin reporting their numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US 10-Year T-Note Futures settled 5 ticks lower at 123-16+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury yields were on Friday, with the curve mildly bear-steepening. Despite headline payrolls disappointing, the wages data continue to point to growth, albeit at a subdued rate when compared to previous recoveries. The data did little to suggest the Fed will alter course, and in combination with optimism about the impact of tax reform, traders were content to end the week selling Treasuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next week&rsquo;s CPI, PPI and retail sales data will help shape traders&rsquo; expectations with regards to more immediate rate hikes. On Friday, the probability of a January hike remained beneath 1%: the chance of March hike were at 80%, the chance of seeing two hikes by June is around 50/50, and there is around 30% chance of three hikes by the end of the year, according to the CME&rsquo;s Fedwatch tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the DXY was modestly up on the day, the dollar index is more-or-less unchanged in the week. The buck saw heavy losses against the CAD following an NFP miss in combination with a stellar Canadian employment report, sending USDCAD crashing through 1.25 to lows near 1.2360 before recovering to 1.24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Eurozone CPI reported for December was in line with expectations, falling 0.1ppts to 1.4%, as expected; the core rate was unchanged at 0.9%. There was little market reaction. The single currency jumped towards 1.2085 following the US payrolls miss, though the gains were pared back as traders digested the data. Either way, the key 1.20 handle remains the focus, with the EUR consolidating above the level in the first week of 2018 trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Safe havens were red on Friday, with the yen and Swissy down against most of the majors, while gold was slightly negative, settling around the $1320 mark. Firm equities, negative Treasuries, and a resilient risk tone helped to buoy the EMFX complex slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pound was uneventful on Friday; in thin news, the 1.36 handle is in focus to the top side, though sterling seems to have been more driven by USD factors this week. Against the EUR, the pound did carve out gains. The next catalysts may come via next week&rsquo;s industrial and manufacturing production data, though traders will be on the look-out for Brexit-related newsflow over the weekend following comments from the EU&rsquo;s Juncker, who was quoted as saying that Brexit talks will be &lsquo;exceptionally difficult&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 57 cents lower at $61.44 per barrel; Brent future settle 45 cents lower at USD 67.62 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI closed red for the first time in six sessions, with profit-taking being cited after the rally that began in mid-December. On the week, however, crude is positive, adding around $1.50 in the first trading week of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traders were banking some of their recent gains after US President Donald Trump on Thursday proposed repealing the ban on offshore drilling, though even some Republican Senators have expressed opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, a study by Rystad Energy has found that global oil discoveries declined to an all-time low in 2017.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback is staging an impressive attempt to recoup initial post-NFP losses and close out a weak first week of 2018 off worst levels, with the Index straddling 92.000. Usd bulls and shorts are looking beyond the headline jobs miss at other components (wages and unemployment rate for example) that matched consensus and on balance should not deflect the Fed from its rate (hike) path this year, especially with a more hawkish-leaning voting panel. A close above the big figure or even 91.988 (76.4% Fib) could yield further recovery gains towards 93.720 resistance, but a failure to hold this week&rsquo;s circa 91.750 lows would suggest ongoing declines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clear G10 outperformer on another whopping 70k+ monthly Canadian employment gain that beat +1k expectations by a mile and boosted January BoC tightening prospects to over 60%, per OIS calculations. The Loonie soared as a result with Usd/Cad down to 1.2355 from around 1.2500 before the US unit regained some composure, but 1.2336 chart support remains far more compelling than 1.2400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi also looking to build on recent gains vs its US counterpart having breached some key chart resistance levels since the start of 2018, and tripping stops between 0.7165-70 (Fib level) on the way to a 0.7186-7 high. Nearest bullish tech/psychological objective now 0.7200, with more buy orders reportedly in place on a clear break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding up well vs the Usd and a net gainer on the week, albeit off 1.3600+ best levels within a 1.3525-80 range. Sterling also outpacing the Eur in late trade, as Eur/Gbp slips back under 0.8900 and Eur/Usd revisits lows of the week near 1.2000 after failing (again) to seriously test last year&rsquo;s high (1.2092), which is stalling further upside potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the only Greenback underperformers on Friday and the week overall, undermined by broad risk-on sentiment. Usd/Jpy marginally extended topside ranges to 113.30 and closer to the next offer zone from 113.40-50, while Jpy crosses also rallied.</p>\r\n",

Gilts have confounded the weaker or indifferent impulses seen ahead of the Liffe open to push ahead from the off (aside from a brief 2 tick stutter below parity), and just printed at 124.88 for a 23 tick gain on what appears to be at least corrective due to their earlier closing time. Nevertheless, Bunds have caught a bid to register a fresh Eurex peak as well, at 161.74 (+15 ticks vs -9 ticks at the other extreme), after holding in at the 50% retracement support level. 161.82-86 forms the next tech resistance area/objective, while bears will still be eyeing 161.36 ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s 161.26 low and the 161.18 ultimate downside target that has survived several times. US Treasuries marginally weaker pre-NFP, aside from flat 2 year notes as the curve steadies a tad following the most recent bout of flattening.</p>\r\n",

However, Aud bulls are encouraged by the fact that support just ahead and below the 0.7800 level has not been threatened or indeed tested, with offers seen around 0.7900 still eyed on the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broad risk appetite, as Wall Street sets more all time records and global stocks continue to rally, has undermined the traditional safe-haven currencies, and with the Jpy also losing ground amidst decent cross-related flows (ie Eur/Jpy bids said to be targeting 140.00 from around 136.50 currently). Usd/Jpy has subsequently breached a key Fib just below 113.00 to trade up near 113.20, and with chart stochastics now bullish within a higher range towards the next major resistance area between 113.64-75. Usd/Chf back near the top of a broad 0.9700-0.9800 range, and like all FX majors looking at NFP for the next big move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CAD/GBP/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All on the firmer side or at least holding up well vs the Usd as the DXY attempts to stay within touching distance of the 92.000 handle. The Kiwi is nestling at 0.7150 having cleared key resistance at 0.7132, with the next key tech upside objectives at 0.7169 before 0.7203 (latter strong and obviously close to the psychological big figure). Usd/Cad back above 1.2500, just, also eyeing oil prices and Canadian jobs data for independent Loonie direction. Cable remains stuck in 1.3500-1.3600 trading parameters, but Sterling is marginally softer vs the Eur (cross just over 0.8900 after a fixing squeeze yesterday), as Eur/Usd rebounds further above 1.2000 support to retest recent highs just below the 1.2092 peak from 2017. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

So, very lacklustre in terms of direction, volume and even curve activity, though semi-core and peripheral debt has started Friday&rsquo;s session on the back foot (albeit moderately) to unwind some of yesterday&rsquo;s marked outperformance and spread narrowing.

The decline in base metal exports was the largest drag as metal ores retreated 10%, while metals slipped by 16%. Imports meanwhile were boosted by increased demand for consumption goods (2%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking forward to Nov, trade surplus is expected to improve slightly to AUD 0.55B as exports to China is expected to pick up (China&#39;s Nov imports saw a 17.7%y/y increase to USD 177.11Bn, the largest since Sept) as energy companies increase purchases ahead of winter season that would typically see more heating. That said, although coal exports may recover, iron ore exports are expected to be lackluster as China clamps down on pollution during the winter season. For imports, the weaker Aussie over Oct/Nov would likely boost import receipts and narrow the surplus. Overall, while coal exports should improve, higher import receipts and still lackluster iron ore exports should keep surplus well below 2017&#39;s average of AUD 1.34bn.</p>\r\n",
