Earlier in the session, China announced they are to lift retaliatory tariffs on US autos for 3-months from January 1st next year (i.e. suspending the 40% tariff plan and sticking to 15%); Chinese Finance Ministry stated they will suspend 25% tariffs on 114 US vehicle and car part items and 5% tariffs on 67 auto items. With regards to the Huawei CEO, Canada said it has been granted consular access to one of the two men detained by China this week and says it is still seeking access to the second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The latest saw European leaders reneged on promise to help UK PM May; The Times reported that&nbsp; British negotiators had agreed a draft statement with the most senior EU officials that would have provided &ldquo;political comfort&rdquo; to Mrs May that the bloc was prepared to compromise on the Irish backstop although at a dinner last night, held without her, leaders went back over the agreement to send a message to MPs that no further concessions would be made by Brussels. In response, the British PM said she was clear about the assurances needed on Brexit, noting that is both UK&#39;s and EU&#39;s interest to get a deal done. She went on to say that the EU is firmly committed to having future ties in place with the EU to avoid a backstop and that these conclusions have legal status. At the summit on Friday,&nbsp; EU Council President Tusk said he has no mandate to re-open Brexit negotiations while French Macron and German Merkel both see a backstop as a insurance option. As a recap, this week was another hectic one with the world of Brexit with Brexiteers finally submitting the required 48 letters to the 1922 committee to trigger a confidence vote in UK PM May. The vote was ultimately unsuccessful with May retaining her premiership and immunity from another challenge by her party for 12 months. Nonetheless, with 117 votes in favour of her stepping down, the passage of her agreement through Parliament remains highly doubtful in its current form. In the immediate aftermath of the leadership vote, May took off to Brussels to see if she could gain any more assurances from the EU on the Irish backstop question, however, as expected, the EU played hardball and thus (at the time of writing) the current deal remains just as unpalatable for UK lawmakers as it was before this week. As such, focus returns to the Parliamentary arithmetic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s De Guindos urged the ECB to keep its optionality at the maximum level. ECB&#39;s Nowotny warned market rate hike expectations are at a different point to current guidance. He believes the ECB has achieved its inflation target and thus the negative deposit rate should be removed as soon as possible. He notes that risks to growth are not significant to the extent that the ECB will alter their monetary policy orientation. ECB&#39;s Vasiliauskas stated that the balance of risks for growth is more likely to change into a negative direction in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; ITALY: </strong>PM Conte stated that the government is working to complete the proposal for a revised budget and that talks will continue with the EU until a compromise is found and he is confident that it will happen. He also reassured that over the next three years debt will be under control and will fall below 1.5% of GDP although stressed that the country has no margin to reduce next year&#39;s deficit below 2.04% of GDP if this implies changing welfare and pension spending plans. He also hopes for higher growth after the Bank of Italy forecasts now see the country&rsquo;s 2018 GDP growth at 0.9% (Prev. 1.2%) and GDP growth at around 1% in period 2019-2021. Note that the EU and Italy were aiming to conclude budget talks by Sunday and are said to be EUR 4.5bln apart on the budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RETAIL SALES </strong>rose 0.2% in November as expected, followed by modest net positive revisions. The ex-autos figure also came in line at 0.2% while the control measure leaped by 0.9%, beating significantly the 0.4% consensus. Overall a very strong report. Analysts at Pantheon note that &ldquo;the kick from the tax cuts is gone, but the huge and rapid drop in retail gas prices is freeing-a great deal of cash at just the right time for retailers&rdquo; and therefore they expect Q4 upward revisions in estimates for consumption, GDP and retailers&rsquo; earnings on the back of this report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* MARKIT COMP FLASH PMI</strong> decelerated in December to 53.6 from 54.7, ending 2018 on a softer noted. Chief IHS Markit analysts note that business activity has expanded at the slowest rate for more than a year and a half&nbsp; and indicate that the pace of growth faded to 2% in December. They also highlight&nbsp; that &ldquo;although growth remains relatively robust, momentum is being lost and is likely to continue to fade as we move into 2019&rdquo; amid uncertainty around trade wars and geopolitical concerns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION </strong>posted at 0.6% in November, above the 0.3% consensus, shrugging off a flat reading for in manufacturing activity; utilities posted gains amid cold weather. Looking ahead, Oxford Economics warns that even though business surveys suggest solid activity, &ldquo;headwinds from trade uncertainty and tariffs, reduced fiscal stimulus, a stronger dollar and weaker global activity will limit the upside&rdquo;. They expect industrial production to rise just below 3% this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>Crude is defensive, though prices trade within recent ranges, with weakness in equities, a stronger dollar, and weaker PMI data raising concerns about global growth being attributed for Friday&#39;s slide. Citi notes, however, that &quot;it is really the expectations game that is driving the market&#39;s reaction.&nbsp; China&rsquo;s industrial production grew 5.4% in November and was considered a disappointment. US industrial production grew 0.6% and was seen, along with this morning&rsquo;s core retail sales data, as encouraging a December Fed rate hike.&quot; Elsewhere, there has been focus on Libya, with Sharara (315k BPD) remaining offline since 8 Dec, though there was some suggestion that El Feel (75k BPD) could be restarted soon. Elsewhere, UBS cites continued doubts on whether the OPEC+ deal will be successful in offsetting the rise in US supply growth in 2019: &quot;The oil price still reflects an excessively pessimistic demand outlook for 2019 that is not supported by the three main forecasting agencies (IEA, EIA, OPEC), as well as optimism on the supply side that seemingly ignores both the OPEC+ agreement and ongoing declines in Iranian production and exports.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) underperformed after reports it sat, knowingly, on information its talcum powder contained asbestos. Costco (COST) traded lower on the back of reporting revenue below estimates. Adobe (ADBE) was down on the open after lowering its earnings guidance. Starbucks (SBUX) underperformed as it lowered its EPS guidance estimates. Apple (AAPL) moved lower following a notable analyst slashing its sales forecasts. Goldman Sachs upgraded Regeneron (REGN) causing it to trade higher and downgraded Walgreens Boots (WBA) causing the consumer staple to move lower. Electronic Arts (EA) nosedived on the session open on the back of a price cut and negative November sales data from the NPD group but the stock pared back losses through the day; Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two (TTWO) also opened lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>A strong end to the week for the broad Dollar, partly due to turmoil elsewhere, but also on some upbeat US macro releases (retail sales and ip overall) just ahead of December&rsquo;s FOMC meeting that is widely expected to see the Fed deliver a final and 4th 25 bp hike in 2018 before possibly signalling a pause.&nbsp; Indeed, the index posted a marginal new ytd high at 97.716 before fading ahead of the next technical resistance level (96.873) standing in front of 98.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> Buffeted by US-China/global trade winds and choppy cross flows, but Friday&rsquo;s clear underperformers in wake of disappointing Chinese retail sales and ip data overnight, while the Kiwi took an additional hit following reports that the RBNZ is looking at the ramifications of a 2-fold increase in the amount of high rate assets banks are required to hold. Aud/Usd has slumped to nearly 0.7150 from just shy of 0.7250 at best having started the week not far from 0.7200, while Nzd/Usd lost 0.6900 and 0.6800 to trade down to around 0.6775 at worst and Aud/Nzd has rebounded firmly from circa 1.0430 to 1.0500+ and close to 1.0590 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>More Brexit spills and thrills for the Pound, and another hairy week for UK PM May who pulled the meaningful vote on Tuesday at the last minute on the likelihood if not certainty that Parliament would reject the draft withdrawal agreement. However, this only seemed to harden the resolve of Brexiteers, led by the ERG, and her staunchest opponents hit the 48 letter mark needed to launch an official leadership challenge the very next day. Cable slumped in response to a new 2018 base 1.2475 vs 1.2760 at best and 1.2725 or thereabouts at the start of the week, but regained some composure as key Cabinet colleagues came out in support of their under fire leader and extended recovery gains after her comfortable if not resounding win. Eur/Gbp retreated from only a few pips short of 0.9090 to 0.8950, though is back up around 0.9000 after the EU Summit yielded no concrete assurances to take back to Whitehall despite a collective will to help PM May convince Parliament that the back-stop is only an if no deal is done insurance arrangement and not designed as the inevitable next stage after transition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency is on track for a hefty net loss vs the Usd within a 1.1445-1.1280 range after finally breaching support just ahead of 1.1300 earlier today on the back of more disappointing EZ PMIs and a particularly poor set of prelim surveys from France, as manufacturing, services and the composite readings all dropped below 50. However, the rot really started on Thursday during the post-ECB policy meeting press conference when President Draghi hinted at tweaks in the assessment of risks from still balanced with a comment about the Bank remaining confident, but increasingly cautious, before clarifying that growth momentum is shifting towards the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, NOK, TRY, RUB: </strong>All eyeing the last respective Central Bank policy convenes of the year for some independent direction like the Eur, but the Franc derived little from an unchanged SNB that still deemed the currency as highly valued, adding that it sees risks of big and abrupt FX moves that would change monetary conditions markedly. The Norwegian Crown did get a knee-jerk boost when the Norges Bank reaffirmed March 2019 tightening guidance, but then faded and slipped back on the shallower longer term depo rate profile that saw 2020 trimmed to 1 hike from 2 previously. Similarly, the Lira lost its initial positivity after the CBRT maintained a tightening bias without specifically talking about further rises to combat hyper-inflation vs target, albeit softer than anticipated in the most recent update, and in spite of an unexpected (not totally, but by a significant majority) the Rouble suffered pretty much the same fate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD:</strong> The Loonie has been victim to swings in crude prices to a degree as usual, along with broader fluctuations in risk sentiment and of course moves in its US counterpart. However, Usd/Cad bounced from sub-1.3300 to 1.3400+ at the other end of the spectrum after China detained 2 Canadian nationals following the arrest of Huawei&rsquo;s CFO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong> Monday: Eurozone CPI, NAHB Housing Market Index, NY Fed Mfg Tuesday: BCB Minutes Wednesday: FOMC Interest Rate Decision, UK CPI, Canadian CPI, New Zealand GDP Thursday: BoE Rate Decision and Minutes, BoJ, Riksbank, Czech Republic, Indonesian Interest Rate Decisions, UK Retail Sales, US Philly Fed, Japanese CPI Friday: UK GDP, US Durable Goods, US GDP (Final), Canadian Retail Sales, US Personal Income &amp; Consumption, Uni of Michigan (Final), Eurozone Consumer Confidence (Flash). <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20780/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk report.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CENTRAL BANK WEEKLY: </strong>Previewing Fed, BOE, BOJ, Riksbank, Banxico; Reviewing ECB, Norges, SNB, CBR, CBRT, BCB RBI. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20779/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk report. &nbsp;</a></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A strong end to the week for the broad Dollar, partly due to turmoil elsewhere, but also on some upbeat US macro releases (retail sales and ip overall) just ahead of December&rsquo;s FOMC meeting that is widely expected to see the Fed deliver a final and 4th 25 bp hike in 2018 before possibly signalling a pause. &nbsp;Indeed, the index posted a marginal new ytd high at 97.716 before fading ahead of the next technical resistance level (96.873) standing in front of 98.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buffeted by US-China/global trade winds and choppy cross flows, but Friday&rsquo;s clear underperformers in wake of disappointing Chinese retail sales and ip data overnight, while the Kiwi took an additional hit following reports that the RBNZ is looking at the ramifications of a 2-fold increase in the amount of high rate assets banks are required to hold. Aud/Usd has slumped to nearly 0.7150 from just shy of 0.7250 at best having started the week not far from 0.7200, while Nzd/Usd lost 0.6900 and 0.6800 to trade down to around 0.6775 at worst and Aud/Nzd has rebounded firmly from circa 1.0430 to 1.0500+ and close to 1.0590 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More Brexit spills and thrills for the Pound, and another hairy week for UK PM May who pulled the meaningful vote on Tuesday at the last minute on the likelihood if not certainty that Parliament would reject the draft withdrawal agreement. However, this only seemed to harden the resolve of Brexiteers, led by the ERG, and her staunchest opponents hit the 48 letter mark needed to launch an official leadership challenge the very next day. Cable slumped in response to a new 2018 base 1.2475 vs 1.2760 at best and 1.2725 or thereabouts at the start of the week, but regained some composure as key Cabinet colleagues came out in support of their under fire leader and extended recovery gains after her comfortable if not resounding win. Eur/Gbp retreated from only a few pips short of 0.9090 to 0.8950, though is back up around 0.9000 after the EU Summit yielded no concrete assurances to take back to Whitehall despite a collective will to help PM May convince Parliament that the back-stop is only an if no deal is done insurance arrangement and not designed as the inevitable next stage after transition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency is on track for a hefty net loss vs the Usd within a 1.1445-1.1280 range after finally breaching support just ahead of 1.1300 earlier today on the back of more disappointing EZ PMIs and a particularly poor set of prelim surveys from France, as manufacturing, services and the composite readings all dropped below 50. However, the rot really started on Thursday during the post-ECB policy meeting press conference when President Draghi hinted at tweaks in the assessment of risks from still balanced with a comment about the Bank remaining confident, but increasingly cautious, before clarifying that growth momentum is shifting towards the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/NOK/TRY/RUB</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All eyeing the last respective Central Bank policy convenes of the year for some independent direction like the Eur, but the Franc derived little from an unchanged SNB that still deemed the currency as highly valued, adding that it sees risks of big and abrupt FX moves that would change monetary conditions markedly. The Norwegian Crown did get a knee-jerk boost when the Norges Bank reaffirmed March 2019 tightening guidance, but then faded and slipped back on the shallower longer term depo rate profile that saw 2020 trimmed to 1 hike from 2 previously. Similarly, the Lira lost its initial positivity after the CBRT maintained a tightening bias without specifically talking about further rises to combat hyper-inflation vs target, albeit softer than anticipated in the most recent update, and in spite of an unexpected (not totally, but by a significant majority) the Rouble suffered pretty much the same fate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has been victim to swings in crude prices to a degree as usual, along with broader fluctuations in risk sentiment and of course moves in its US counterpart. However, Usd/Cad bounced from sub-1.3300 to 1.3400+ at the other end of the spectrum after China detained 2 Canadian nationals following the arrest of Huawei&rsquo;s CFO.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are poised to finish the week on the backfoot (Eurostoxx 50 -0.9%) following the weak lead from Asia as sentiment turned sour amid the release of disappointing Chinese industrial production and retail sales, highlighting weakness in the Chinese economy. As such, around 75% of the Stoxx 600 (-0.9%) are in the red, Switzerland&rsquo;s SMI (-1.4%) marginally lags peers with all 20 stocks in negative territory. In terms of sectors, IT names underperform alongside auto names (seen as trade proxies due to heavy exports) as a result of the aforementioned Chinese retail sales signalling an impact from ongoing trade disputes. However, European auto names spiked higher following reports that China are to lift retaliatory tariffs on US autos for 3-months from January 1st next year (i.e. suspending the 40% tariff plan and sticking to 15%). In terms of individual movers GVC Holdings (+8.8%) shares rose to the top of the UK benchmark with Citi citing next week&rsquo;s Parliament vote on FOBT stakes being &ldquo;significantly positive&rdquo; as shareholders will be paid out GBP 676mln if the legislation is not passed by 28th March 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Antipodean Dollars have derived some scant support from reports that China will freeze and backtrack on a proposed increase in US auto tariffs w/e January 1 next year, in line with recent speculation, but the Aussie and Kiwi remain on the backfoot and significantly weaker than their G10 counterparts following sub-forecast Chinese data overnight and RBNZ consultations about lifting high grade bank capital requirements by 100%. Aud/Usd is holding just off a fresh December low around 0.7155 after breaching 0.7200 and tech supports below the figure at 0.7186 (55 DMA) and 0.7163 (Fib), while Nzd/Usd has lost grip of 0.6800 as the Aud/Nzd cross pivots 1.0550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also major underperformers, as the single currency extended post-ECB losses on the back of further declines in EZ PMIs (French readings especially dire as manufacturing, services and composite all tumbled into sub-50 contractionary territory) and through recent support just ahead of 1.1300 vs the Greenback to 1.1286 before finding some bids. Note, a decent 1 bn option expiry at the 1.1300 strike may provide some traction. Meanwhile, Brexit remains the big bane for Sterling and given the ongoing impasse between UK PM May and EU leaders on the back-stop, Cable has retreated sharply towards 1.2570 and chart-wise back below the 10 DMA circa 1.2660.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has reversed further from recent highs vs the Usd and back down towards 1.3400, as the Canadian-Chinese diplomatic spat compounds broader risk aversion and a retracement in oil prices. However, the Franc is still somewhat betwixt and between, as Usd/Chf continues to bounce off 0.9900 and over 0.9950 amidst general Dollar strength (DXY 97.500+), but Eur/Chf slips under 1.1250 on the aforementioned single currency depreciation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, demand for the safe-haven Yen is just keeping Usd/Jpy depressed within a tight 113.70-40 range, along with 1.4 bn expiries at 113.75.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An unexpected, though far from total surprise &frac14; point CBR rate hike has underpinned the Rub against the grain of overall regional currency weakness on risk-off flows, with the Rouble comfortably above 66.5000 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more recent EZ PMI and Brexit driven rally in EU core bonds has tapered off with Gilts and Bunds trading with a 123.30 and 163.10 handle (vs. 123.53 and 163.30 at best) as tariff tensions abate amidst the Chinese temporary lift of 25% tariffs on US autos. The benchmarks now find support set at the 123.00 (yesterdays low was 122.98) and&nbsp; 163.20 levels respectively, with both looking for further direction ahead of the weekend from the ongoing EU Brexit summit. Elsewhere, BTPs are trading essentially flat on the day just under the 125.40 level as the bullish trend seen in recent days has dwindled following suggestions that the EU and Italy are still EUR 4.5bln apart on the budget, with further pressure seen after negative revisions to Italian CPI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning to US Treasury futures, best gains have also been trimmed following the positive trade headlines with the 10-year benchmark perhaps losing some steam&nbsp; having failed to breach chart resistance at 120-14 convincingly. Ahead, traders look to impetus from US flash PMI and output data later in the day and Fed next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.7%) and Brent (-0.9%) swings between gains and losses following an uneventful overnight session as prices consolidated after yesterday&rsquo;s rally.&nbsp; The complex saw some upside in recent trade after Libya&rsquo;s NOC chairman was pessimistic about reopening its 300k BPD El-Sharara after an armed group halted production at the oilfield. Traders will be eyeing this evening&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count as fresh catalyst. Note, WTI Jan&rsquo;19 options expire today at 19.30GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (-0.3%) is set for is biggest weekly fall in five weeks due to a firmer USD as traders focus on next week&rsquo;s tabled Fed rate hike. Looking at base metals, copper is on track for a third consecutive weekly drop with downside exacerbated by the downbeat Chinese industrial production translating into weaker demand as the red metal faces a 15% yearly decline. Finally, Shanghai steel extended gains for a third day in a row after two major steelmaking cities (Tangshan and Xuzhou) demanded mills to curtail production amid worries that they will not meet pollution reduction targets this year. For context, Tangshan accounts for 10% of China&rsquo;s total steel output while Xuzhou is in the number two steelmaking province</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oman announce a 2% oil production cut effective from January 2019, for a initial period of 6 months; according to documents.

As such, over a 75% of the Stoxx 600 (-0.9%) are in the red, Switzerland&rsquo;s SMI (-1.4%) marginally lags peers with all 20 stocks in negative territory. In terms of sectors, IT names underperform alongside auto names (seen as trade proxies due to heavy exports) as a result of the aforementioned Chinese retail sales signalling an impact from ongoing trade disputes. However, European auto names spiked higher following reports that China are to lift retaliatory tariffs on US autos for 3-months from January 1st next year (i.e. suspending the 40% tariff plan and sticking to 15%). In terms of individual movers GVC Holdings (+8.8%) shares rose to the top of the UK benchmark with Citi citing next week&rsquo;s Parliament vote on FOBT stakes being &ldquo;significantly positive&rdquo; as shareholders will be paid out GBP 676mln if the legislation is not passed by 28th March 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Antipodean Dollars have derived some scant support from reports that China will freeze and backtrack on a proposed increase in US auto tariffs w/e January 1 next year, in line with recent speculation, but the Aussie and Kiwi remain on the backfoot and significantly weaker than their G10 counterparts following sub-forecast Chinese data overnight and RBNZ consultations about lifting high grade bank capital requirements by 100%. Aud/Usd is holding just off a fresh December low around 0.7155 after breaching 0.7200 and tech supports below the figure at 0.7186 (55 DMA) and 0.7163 (Fib), while Nzd/Usd has lost grip of 0.6800 as the Aud/Nzd cross pivots 1.0550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also major underperformers, as the single currency extended post-ECB losses on the back of further declines in EZ PMIs (French readings especially dire as manufacturing, services and composite all tumbled into sub-50 contractionary territory) and through recent support just ahead of 1.1300 vs the Greenback to 1.1286 before finding some bids. Note, a decent 1 bn option expiry at the 1.1300 strike may provide some traction. Meanwhile, Brexit remains the big bane for Sterling and given the ongoing impasse between UK PM May and EU leaders on the back-stop, Cable has retreated sharply towards 1.2570 and chart-wise back below the 10 DMA circa 1.2660.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has reversed further from recent highs vs the Usd and back down towards 1.3400, as the Canadian-Chinese diplomatic spat compounds broader risk aversion and a retracement in oil prices. However, the Franc is still somewhat betwixt and between, as Usd/Chf continues to bounce off 0.9900 and over 0.9950 amidst general Dollar strength (DXY 97.500+), but Eur/Chf slips under 1.1250 on the aforementioned single currency depreciation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, demand for the safe-haven Yen is just keeping Usd/Jpy depressed within a tight 113.70-40 range, along with 1.4 bn expiries at 113.75.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An unexpected, though far from total surprise &frac14; point CBR rate hike has underpinned the Rub against the grain of overall regional currency weakness on risk-off flows, with the Rouble comfortably above 66.5000 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more recent EZ PMI and Brexit driven rally in EU core bonds has tapered off with Gilts and Bunds trading with a 123.30 and 163.10 handle (vs. 123.53 and 163.30 at best) as tariff tensions abate amidst the Chinese temporary lift of 25% tariffs on US autos. The benchmarks now find support set at the 123.00 (yesterdays low was 122.98) and&nbsp; 163.20 levels respectively, with both looking for further direction ahead of the weekend from the ongoing EU Brexit summit. Elsewhere, BTPs are trading essentially flat on the day just under the 125.40 level as the bullish trend seen in recent days has dwindled following suggestions that the EU and Italy are still EUR 4.5bln apart on the budget, with further pressure seen after negative revisions to Italian CPI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning to US Treasury futures, best gains have also been trimmed following the positive trade headlines with the 10-year benchmark perhaps losing some steam&nbsp; having failed to breach chart resistance at 120-14 convincingly. Ahead, traders look to impetus from US flash PMI and output data later in the day and Fed next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.5%) and Brent (-0.6%) swings between gains and losses following an uneventful overnight session as prices consolidated after yesterday&rsquo;s rally.&nbsp; The complex saw some upside in recent trade after Libya&rsquo;s NOC chairman was pessimistic about reopening its 300k BPD El-Sharara after an armed group halted production at the oilfield. Traders will be eyeing this evening&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count as fresh catalyst. Note, WTI Jan&rsquo;19 options expire today at 19.30GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (-0.2%) is set for is biggest weekly fall in five weeks due to a firmer USD as traders focus on next week&rsquo;s tabled Fed rate hike. Looking at base metals, copper is on track for a third consecutive weekly drop with downside exacerbated by the downbeat Chinese industrial production translating into weaker demand as the red metal faces a 15% yearly decline. Finally, Shanghai steel extended gains for a third day in a row after two major steelmaking cities (Tangshan and Xuzhou) demanded mills to curtail production amid worries that they will not meet pollution reduction targets this year. For context, Tangshan accounts for 10% of China&rsquo;s total steel output while Xuzhou is in the number two steelmaking province</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-2.1%) both declined from the open with Australia led lower by tech, telecoms and the largest weighted financials sector, while the Japanese benchmark was subdued amid a firmer JPY and mixed Tankan data despite the headline Large Manufacturers Index and Large All Industry Capex topping estimates. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) were also pressured after Chinese Industrial Production and Retail Sales data both fell short of estimates, with underperformance seen in Hong Kong as this year&rsquo;s run of lacklustre stock market debuts continued in the domestic exchange. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked gains in T-notes and with prices underpinned by safe-haven demand which saw 10yr JGBs print the highest since November 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped repo operations but announced a CNY 286bln 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility.

EU Leaders said the trade deal to avoid using backstop should be in place by December 2020 or soon after and that they wish to have as close as possible partnership with the UK in the future, while they underlined that the backstop is intended as an insurance policy. Furthermore, there were comments from EU Council President Tusk that leaders stand by the withdrawal agreement and that it is not to be renegotiated. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were earlier reports that the EU is said to consider a backstop declaration with legal force and is said to consider aspirational end-date for the backstop, while the EU is said to expect another Brexit summit in January.

As such, EUR/USD was little changed, and GBP/USD edged slightly lower following the EU leaders&rsquo; summit in which the bloc&rsquo;s officials attempted to provide assurances regarding the backstop but stressed they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. Elsewhere, the risk-averse tone spurred demand for safe-haven JPY and weighed on antipodeans, with pressure in AUD exacerbated by cross-related flows and disappointing Chinese data.<br /><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were uneventful overnight in which WTI crude futures consolidated after the prior day&rsquo;s over 3% rally to briefly above USD 53.00/bbl which was attributed to a long overdue rebound. Elsewhere, gold traded sideways amid a lack of drivers for the precious metal and similar subdued price action across the metals complex, while copper was weighed due to the broad risk averse tone and disappointing Chinese data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia was said to target US with a large oil export cut in which the cut is aimed at reducing their visible stockpiles, while reports suggested that Saudi crude shipments to the US next month could test the 30-year low set in 2017 of 582,000 BPD which would be down 40% from the most recent 3-month average.

Most of the action was concentrated at the extremes of the curve with shorter dated yields lower by c.1bps and longer dated yields higher by c.1bps a settlement.

ASX 200 (-1.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-2.1%) both declined from the open with Australia led lower by tech, telecoms and the largest weighted financials sector, while the Japanese benchmark was subdued amid a firmer JPY and mixed Tankan data despite the headline Large Manufacturers Index and Large All Industry Capex topping estimates. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) were also pressured after Chinese Industrial Production and Retail Sales data both fell short of estimates, with underperformance seen in Hong Kong as this year&rsquo;s run of lacklustre stock market debuts continued in the domestic exchange. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked gains in T-notes and with prices underpinned by safe-haven demand which saw 10yr JGBs print the highest since November 2016.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, the risk-averse tone spurred demand for safe-haven JPY and weighed on antipodeans, with pressure in AUD exacerbated by cross-related flows and disappointing Chinese data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they tracked gains in T-notes and with prices underpinned by safe-haven demand which saw prices print the highest since November 2016.</p>\r\n",
