The piece also noted that internal divisions within the US could derail the timeline. The news follows Thursday&rsquo;s reports that low-level trade talks between the two nations have been pencilled in for 22-23 August. The news immediately injected a risk-on sentiment into markets, helping the ES to hit weekly highs above 2850 and USDCNH hit weekly lows, and EURUSD to weekly highs. Earlier in the session, the NYT reported that the US is seeking to pressure China to lift the yuan in talks. (NOTE: the article in New York Times was published hours before it was picked up by financial news wires, so the reaction was somewhat delayed). On NAFTA, Mexico Economy Minister Guajardo was asked if there had been a breakthrough in talks, and said there are still several items that need discussing, but he was hopeful of reaching a deal in the coming days and to conclude the remaining bilateral issues with the US by the middle of next week, which includes auto rules of origin. And White House Economic advisor Hassett echoed the comments made by NEC Director Kudlow on Thursday, saying a deal with Mexico is close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> TURKEY</strong>: The TRY came under further pressure amid recent comments made by Trump, who accused Turkey of taking advantage of the US, and US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin who threatened further sanctions on Turkey if Pastor Brunson is not freed. On Friday, a Turkish appeals court rejected US Pastor Brunson&#39;s appeal for the release; in response Trump accused Turkey of making up the fake charge that US Pastor Brunson is a spy. There was some positive ticks for global risk assets on news that Turkey was ready to release the Pastor, but was waiting for the US to offer something in return, according to Middle East eye; the report was rehashed by Business Insider later in the day, which also helped risk sentiment. On the economic front, the Turkish industry ministry announced support for the industrial sector, and noted that the measures will not result in an additional burden on the budget. Moreover a Turkish banking watchdog decided to limit forward and options-type transactions in addition to swap transaction limits. Rating agency Fitch said that economic measures taken by Turkey are insufficient to restore policy credibility and that the nation&#39;s incomplete policy response to TRY depreciation is unlikely to provide sustainable stability to the currency and economy. S&amp;P are due to publish a review of Turkey after the bell (currently BB-).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong>CANADIAN CPI</strong>: July&rsquo;s headline CPI came in well-above analysts&rsquo; forecasts, rising to 3.0% YY vs a previous 2.5%. The immediate market reaction saw a sharp strengthening of the Canadian dollar, and the pricing for the next BoC rate hike rose to around 32% from around 22% before the data was released. The average of the BOC measures (trimmed, median, common), however, rose slightly in the month to 2%, where they have been knocking around for most of this year. &ldquo;One month does not make a trend and the core inflation measures remain anchored at 2%. It&rsquo;s going to take more than one month of elevated inflation to convince the BoC that inflation is poised to accelerate,&rdquo; BMO&rsquo;s analysts said, arguing that the report &ldquo;barely moves the needle for the September policy meeting (if at all), as there&rsquo;s no need to shift away from the gradual tightening stance noted in July.&rdquo; BMO continues to expect the next BoC rate hike will come in October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>UNI OF MICHIGAN</strong>: The preliminary consumer sentiment index fell to 95.3, against the expectations of 98.0 in August; a dip but still relatively high by historical standards. The peripheral data showed the expectations number unchanged at 87.3 and the current conditions index dropping from 114.4 to 107.8. Analysts at Pantheon say short term dips in the current conditions index are not unusual and a rebound in September is expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> </strong><strong>SPX +0.33% at 2850, NDX +0.04% at 7378, DJI +0.43% at 25669.</strong> SECTORS: Energy +0.27%, Materials +0.73%, Industrials +0.61% Cons Discretionary +0.12%, Cons&nbsp; Staples +0.67%, Healthcare +0.37%, Financials +0.21%, Tech +0.18%, Telecoms +0.38%, Utilities +0.38%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>FUTURES</strong>: US equity futures traded sideways overnight following Thursday&rsquo;s solid gains, with the Emini S&amp;P 500 consolidating beneath 2850 for most of the session; that level was breached to the upside on news that US and China are planning a roadmap to resolve their trade dispute by November, which sent ES to weekly highs. Before then, indices were under slight downward pressure; however, a bottom was seen around 2835, which coincided with an article on Business Insider, suggesting that Turkish diplomats are ready to release Pastor Brunson. However, this news was seen hours beforehand in the Middle Eastern Eye, and in between the two releases, a Turkish appeals court rejected the plea to release Pastor Brunson. Nasdaq futures underperformed following poor earnings from Applied Materials (AMAT) which sparked a sell off in semiconductors, with the ETF (SOX) seeing declines just shy of 3%, before paring back most of the losses as trade progressed. &nbsp;Tesla (TSLA) also pressured the Nasdaq following reports the SEC is placing pressure on the automaker&rsquo;s directors to understand how much details CEO Elon Musk shared with them prior to the announcement of his plan to take the co. private.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>EARNINGS</strong>: Applied materials (AMAT), Nvidia (NVDA), Deere (DE) &amp; Nordstrom (JWN) all reported earnings; AMAT &amp; NVDA reported Thursday, where AMAT beat on both top and bottom lines, however, provided EPS and revenue guidance below Wall Street&rsquo;s expectations, as well as reporting gross margin of 46.4%, lower than the previous 46.6%. Nvidia (NVDA) also beat on both top and bottom lines, albeit only slightly on revenues, but its revenue guidance was below expectations. On its crypto impact, the CEO stated &lsquo;it will drag down the OEM and IP business and bring year-over-year declines in the fiscal third quarter&rsquo; he then went on to say they &lsquo;are hoping that &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; Nvidia&#39;s data centre business will grow, and they think the gaming business will grow as well&rsquo;. Both NVDA and AMAT closed heavily in the red.&nbsp; Deere (DE) initially opened lower due to an EPS miss, but the losses abated and the stock closed higher than 3% after its earnings call, where executives said US farmers are seeing higher export demand for wheat this year, and that they expect price actions to offset material inflation, and that its tractor order book is slightly higher than the previous years. DE were also upbeat about 2019 &lsquo;Farm economics&rsquo;. After Macy&rsquo;s (M) kicked off the retail earnings with a very poor report, Nordstrom provided hope for the sector as its stock surged over 10% on Friday after the name beat on both ends and raised guidance for EPS and revenue, which provided some support for Kohl&rsquo;s (KSS), which is scheduled to report next week.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> M&amp;A</strong>: SJW (SJW) initially rejected the revised offer from California Water Service (CTWS) which was then followed by CTWS announcing it will terminate the offer to acquire SJW, which hit SJW by around 5%. Elsewhere, CNBC reported Campbell Soup (CPB) has asked Goldman Sachs to examine the potential sale of business units to pay down debt. Note,&nbsp; this comes amid the speculation that Kraft Heinz (KHC) may acquire the co., as well as Dan Loeb&rsquo;s Third Point taking a stake and pushing for a sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> WTI (U8) FUTURES SETTLE 45C HIGHER AT USD 65.91, Brent (V8) FUTURES SETTLE 40C HIGHER AT USD 71.83</strong>. Crude essentially had another day of traversing horizontally, and is on course for a weekly loss, driven by tensions over trade wars (China) and EM woes (Turkey). The slight gains on Friday were in keeping with recovery in commodities seen since mid-week, while some also said that the dollar (red for the week) also gave support. There are also suggestions that the situation in Libya may take a turn for the worse, with protests at Zawiya terminal raising fears that production at Sharara &ndash; which recently restored production levels &ndash; will once again take a hit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>US 10-YEAR T-NOTES SETTLED HALF-A-TICK TICK LOWER AT 120-08</strong>. Slight flattening of the curve was seen on Friday by settlement, and yields are ultimately little changed. There was little move after a miss on the Unviersity of Michigan sentiment data, and Treasuries edged higher. The complex was positive up until a news report suggesting that the US and Chinese were working on a roadmap to reach a resolution in their trade dispute by November. The headline saw a move into risk, to the detriment of Treasuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong>TRY, ZAR, ARS</strong>: &nbsp;A real roller-coaster ride for risk sentiment, and for the Turkish Lira white knuckle at times as US sanctions compounded more domestic sources of investor angst to send the Try into a tailspin that reverberated across the region and a lot further. USDTRY hit 7.2000+ before CBRT intervention finally succeeded where other measures failed to stop the rot, or at least turned the tide, and the Lira received an extra fillip from Qatar in the shape of $15bln FDI. Turkey&rsquo;s President and Finance Minister maintained that US actions in response to Pastor Brunson&rsquo;s ongoing detention are illegal and continued to rail against speculators with warnings about losing out when the Try and country&rsquo;s assets in general recover. However, a frantic Friday and 2nd court ruling rejecting US appeals to release the clergyman from house arrest saw the Lira retreat to 6.3000+ vs best recovery levels circa 5.7000. Looking elsewhere, the Rand, Rouble, Real and Pesos (Mexican and Argentine) largely tracked moves and broad swings from aversion to renewed appetite, with the ZAR underperforming on specific SA political grounds (ie the land appropriation bill passing and opposition party proposals to nationalise the SARB). Conversely, increasingly positive NAFTA noises cushioned the MXN to an extent and the ARS derived some support from a 500 bp emergency hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>DXY</strong>: Mainly trading on the back of moves in currency counterparts, with the broad Dollar and index rallying to peaks when the Try, contagion and sentiment was most intense, as the DXY posted a fresh 2018 pinnacle a whisker away from 97.000 (at 96.991). However, the aforementioned Lira redemption and decision by the US and China to hold further trade talks (August 22-23, so just before the next $16 bn tit-for-tat import tariffs are due to be applied), lifted the Yuan from its lows (USDCNY and USDCNH both close to 6.9500 and weaker than levels that prompted recent Chinese intervention) and weighed on the Greenback &ndash; index back down around 96.200. Gains were further seen in the USD/CNH as it was reported a roadmap has been plotted to solve china trade disputes by November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CAD</strong>: More choppy trade for the Loonie amidst whippy, but mostly weaker crude/commodity prices vs improving US-Canada-NAFTA headlines and mixed macro releases. However, the Cad has been elevated towards highs of the weak by much stronger than expected CPI data that has in turn boosted BoC rate hike prospects from the next meeting in September and out to the end of the year. Usd/Cad down to 1.3065 from 1.3175 or so at the other extreme and not far from decent option expiry interest at the 1.3050 strike (1 bn) having effectively removed almost twice that amount between 1.3145-50 in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>JPY</strong>: Another net gainer on the week within 111.40-110.10 parameters and ending much closer to the bottom of the range vs the Greenback on stronger safe-haven credentials and close to hefty option expiries at 110.50 (2.2 bn) around the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>NZD, AUD</strong>: The Kiwi is shading the battle down under approaching the end of a week when the baton has changed hands several times, as N hovers just above 0.6600 from a 0.6540 low, but AUDUSD remains capped ahead of 0.7300 and the cross slips back towards 1.1000. More dovish RBA policy guidance has hampered the AUD along with US-China/global trade jitters and a somewhat mixed Aussie jobs report that merely underscores the RBA&rsquo;s benign outlook for wages, and inflation overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong>EUR, GBP</strong>: The single currency is back on the 1.1400 handle having survived a stringent examination of barrier defences, support and bids on the big figure below, which would have trigged more heavy stops if breached. However, the 1.1430 area is proving formidable resistance and option expiries may have exerted downside/alluring influences with 1.9 bn rolling off today, while SOMA redemptions earlier in the week also stretched their 100% bearish steak further from February. However in late trade, the resistance broke after the announced US/China roadmap to solve disputes by November. Turning to the Pound, and the partial/limited recovery theme is also applicable as Cable rebounds to 1.2700+ levels vs a new ytd low circa 1.2660 but tops out around 1.2750 again. Brexit remains up in the air as latest UK-EU talks conclude, while data was largely irrelevant given a mixed jobs/earnings report, broadly in line CPI release and better than expected retail sales, but with the weather a positive factor this time in contrast to the previous month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>COMING-UP</strong>: Monday: German PPI Tuesday: RBA Minutes Wednesday: NZ Retail Sales, Canadian Retail Sales, US Existing Home Sales, FOMC Minutes Thursday: Norway GDP, EZ PMI (Flash), ECB Minutes, Fed&rsquo;s Jackson Hole Symposium begins, US PMI (Flash), US tariffs on USD 16bln of Chinese goods take effect Friday: NZ Trade Balance, Japan CPI, German GDP (2nd reading), US Durable Goods, Mexican GDP. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19838/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk Week In Focus report.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>RANsquawk Central Bank Weekly Note - PBOC</strong>: Building a firewall to defend against capital outflows.

        "content": "<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A real roller-coaster ride for risk sentiment, and for the Turkish Lira white knuckle at times as US sanctions compounded more domestic sources of investor angst to send the Try into a tailspin that reverberated across the region and a lot further. Usd/Try hit 7.2000+ before CBRT intervention finally succeeded where other measures failed to stop the rot, or at least turned the tide, and the Lira received an extra fillip from Qatar in the shape of $15 bn FDI. Turkey&rsquo;s President and Finance Minister maintained that US actions in response to Pastor Brunson&rsquo;s ongoing detention are illegal and continued to rail against speculators with warnings about losing out when the Try and country&rsquo;s assets in general recover. However, a frantic Friday and 2nd court ruling rejecting US appeals to release the clergyman from house arrest saw the Lira retreat to 6.3000+ vs best recovery levels circa 5.7000. Looking elsewhere, the Rand, Rouble, Real and Pesos (Mexican and Argentine) largely tracked moves and broad swings from aversion to renewed appetite, with the Zar underperforming on specific SA political grounds (ie the land appropriation bill passing and opposition party proposals to nationalise the SARB). Conversely, increasingly positive NAFTA noises cushioned the Mxn to an extent and the Ars derived some support from a 500 bp emergency hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mainly trading on the back of moves in currency counterparts, with the broad Dollar and index rallying to peaks when the Try, contagion and sentiment was most intense, as the DXY posted a fresh 2018 pinnacle a whisker away from 97.000 (at 96.991). However, the aforementioned Lira redemption and decision by the US and China to hold further trade talks (August 22-23, so just before the next $16 bn tit-for-tat import tariffs are due to be applied), lifted the Yuan from its lows (Usd/Cny and Usd/Cnh both close to 6.9500 and weaker than levels that prompted recent Chinese intervention) and weighed on the Greenback &ndash; index back down around 96.200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More choppy trade for the Loonie amidst whippy, but mostly weaker crude/commodity prices vs improving US-Canada-NAFTA headlines and mixed macro releases. However, the Cad has been elevated towards highs of the weak by much stronger than expected CPI data that has in turn boosted BoC rate hike prospects from the next meeting in September and out to the end of the year. Usd/Cad down to 1.3065 from 1.3175 or so at the other extreme and not far from decent option expiry interest at the 1.3050 strike (1 bn) having effectively removed almost twice that amount between 1.3145-50 in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another net gainer on the week within 111.40-110.10 parameters, and ending much closer to the bottom of the range vs the Greenback on stronger safe-haven credentials and close to hefty option expiries at 110.50 (2.2 bn) around the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is shading the battle down under approaching the end of a week when the baton has changed hands several times, as Nzd/Usd hovers just above 0.6600 from a 0.6540 low, but Aud/Usd remains capped ahead of 0.7300 and the cross slips back towards 1.1000. More dovish RBA policy guidance has hampered the Aud along with US-China/global trade jitters and a somewhat mixed Aussie jobs report that merely underscores the RBA&rsquo;s benign outlook for wages, and inflation overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency is back on the 1.1400 handle having survived a stringent examination of barrier defences, support and bids on the big figure below, which would have trigged more heavy stops if breached. However, the 1.1430 area is proving formidable resistance and option expiries may have exerted downside/alluring influences with 1.9 bn rolling off today, while SOMA redemptions earlier in the week also stretched their 100% bearish steak further from February. Turning to the Pound, and the partial/limited recovery theme is also applicable as Cable rebounds to 1.2700+ levels vs a new ytd low circa 1.2660, but tops out around 1.2750 again. Brexit remains up in the air as latest UK-EU talks conclude, while data was largely irrelevant given a mixed jobs/earnings report, broadly in line CPI release and better than expected retail sales, but with the weather a positive factor this time in contrast to the previous month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AHEAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A busy agenda ahead, including Jackson Hole, the US-China trade meet and unfolding developments in Turkey along with the rest of the EM region.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) were both higher although the former somewhat lagged after having stalled at fresh highs last seen in over a decade, while gains in Japanese exporters were contained by a stable currency. Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%) both initially conformed to the positive risk tone amid the trade-related hopes, continued PBoC liquidity efforts and as Hong Kong-heavyweight Tencent also rebounded from post-earnings losses, although the Shanghai Comp. eventually gave back its gains and then some, as sentiment deteriorated across the mainland.

The AEX is currently the underperforming bourse, with losses lead by Vopak (-7.0%) (whom are also at the foot of the Stoxx 600) after missing expectations on all of net profit, EBITDA and revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AP Moeller Maersk (+4.7%) also reported earnings, wherein revenues came in above least years results. The co. also confirmed source reports it is looking to spin-off it&rsquo;s drilling unit and list it on the NASDAQ so as to focus on their transport business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Air France appointed the Ex-COO of Air Canada last night, Ben Smith, as CEO. Despite opening higher Air France shares reversed course amid protests from French unions about the Canadian&rsquo;s appointment, and are currently down 4.0%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been gradual, but no less compelling given another EM run and renewed weakness in the Try and Rub among others. The extended rebound in 10 year EU benchmarks also has technical backing, as Bunds breached Thursday&rsquo;s Eurex session best (163.67) having cleared interim chart resistance round 163.58 (declining trend-line), and now posting marginal new high for the week at 163.88 (vs. 163.82 previously) for a 39 tick advance on the day. Meanwhile, Gilts have cleared 124.00, at 124.07 (+36 ticks) and 124.27 beckons, as US Treasuries latch on to the safe-haven rally that could really gather steam into the weekend given risk-paring tendencies and positioning on Fridays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Some downside deviation from the relatively tight range around 96.500 that has been prevalent since the Try-led EM exodus subsided amidst reports (albeit dated) that the US will urge China to revalue the Yuan during trade negotiations scheduled for next week. The index dipped just under 96.300 amidst broad Usd declines, but still restrained trade overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY/YUAN - The Lira maintained enough recovery momentum to trade a fraction above 5.7500 vs the Dollar, but stopped short of Thursday&rsquo;s circa 5.7000 high that is very close to a key Fib level and in volatile conditions reversed to hit 6.0000+ levels. Meanwhile, the PBoC halted a run of daily Cny depreciations via the official mid-point fix to leave the offshore Cnh off recent lows and also bolstered by the provision of 7 day liquidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - Highlighting the considerably improved risk tone, the Kiwi is making a more concerted effort to form a base at 0.6600 vs its US counterpart, while the Aud has extended above 0.7250 again, though still unable to reach 0.7300 with technical resistance just a head of the big figure and the RBA reiterating no rush or rationale to raise rates anytime soon (Governor Low overnight and message rammed home by Ellis earlier today).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY - The next best G10s, as the single currency revisits 1.1400 vs the Greenback where big option expiries run off today (1.9 bn from the big figure to 1.1410) and Usd/Jpy retreats from 111.00 again and also eyes hefty expiry interest, with 2.2 bn at the 110.50 strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/GBP - All mildly firmer vs the Usd, with the Loonie pivoting around 1.3150 ahead of Canadian CPI data later and wary of option-related flows as well given 1.8 bn between 1.3145-50. The Franc is also within recent ranges and contained from 0.9945-80, while Cable is holding above 1.2700 and just failed to re-test residual stops at 1.2750.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices are up this Friday but are still set to end the week in the red for the third week in a row. WTI and Brent are both up ~0.25% on the day as energy specific news flow remains light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, Gold is up marginally off the back of USD weakness and testing the USD1180/OZ level to the upside, but is still set for its largest weekly fall in 15 months. Precious metals are slightly in the green with all of silver (+0.2%), platinum (+0.4%) and palladium (+0.1%) up on the day.</p>\r\n",

The AEX is currently the underperforming bourse, with losses lead by Vopak (-7.0%) (whom are also at the foot of the Stoxx 600) after missing expectations on all of net profit, EBITDA and revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AP Moeller Maersk (+4.7%) also reported earnings, wherein revenues came in above least years results. The co. also confirmed source reports it is looking to spin-off it&rsquo;s drilling unit and list it on the NASDAQ so as to focus on their transport business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Air France appointed the Ex-COO of Air Canada last night, Ben Smith, as CEO. Despite opening higher Air France shares reversed course amid protests from French unions about the Canadian&rsquo;s appointment, and are currently down 4.0%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Some downside deviation from the relatively tight range around 96.500 that has been prevalent since the Try-led EM exodus subsided amidst reports (albeit dated) that the US will urge China to revalue the Yuan during trade negotiations scheduled for next week. The index dipped just under 96.300 amidst broad Usd declines, but still restrained trade overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY/YUAN - The Lira maintained enough recovery momentum to trade a fraction above 5.7500 vs the Dollar, but stopped short of Thursday&rsquo;s circa 5.7000 high that is very close to a key Fib level and in volatile conditions reversed to hit 6.0000+ levels. Meanwhile, the PBoC halted a run of daily Cny depreciations via the official mid-point fix to leave the offshore Cnh off recent lows and also bolstered by the provision of 7 day liquidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - Highlighting the considerably improved risk tone, the Kiwi is making a more concerted effort to form a base at 0.6600 vs its US counterpart, while the Aud has extended above 0.7250 again, though still unable to reach 0.7300 with technical resistance just a head of the big figure and the RBA reiterating no rush or rationale to raise rates anytime soon (Governor Low overnight and message rammed home by Ellis earlier today).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY - The next best G10s, as the single currency revisits 1.1400 vs the Greenback where big option expiries run off today (1.9 bn from the big figure to 1.1410) and Usd/Jpy retreats from 111.00 again and also eyes hefty expiry interest, with 2.2 bn at the 110.50 strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/GBP - All mildly firmer vs the Usd, with the Loonie pivoting around 1.3150 ahead of Canadian CPI data later and wary of option-related flows as well given 1.8 bn between 1.3145-50. The Franc is also within recent ranges and contained from 0.9945-80, while Cable is holding above 1.2700 and just failed to re-test residual stops at 1.2750.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been gradual, but no less compelling given another EM run and renewed weakness in the Try and Rub among others. The extended rebound in 10 year EU benchmarks also has technical backing, as Bunds breached Thursday&rsquo;s Eurex session best (163.67) having cleared interim chart resistance round 163.58 (declining trend-line), and now looks almost destined to match or make a fresh peak for the week having reached 163.80 (vs 163.82) for a 31 tick advance on the day. Meanwhile, Gilts have cleared 124.00, at 124.04 (+33 ticks) and 124.27 beckons, as US Treasuries latch on to the safe-haven rally that could really gather steam into the weekend given risk-paring tendencies and positioning on Fridays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices are up this Friday but are still set to end the week in the red for the third week in a row. WTI and Brent are both up ~0.25% on the day as energy specific news flow remains light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, Gold is up marginally off the back of USD weakness and testing the USD1180/OZ level to the upside, but is still set for its largest weekly fall in 15 months. Precious metals are slightly in the green with all of silver (+0.2%), platinum (+0.4%) and palladium (+0.1%) up on the day.</p>\r\n",

The index dipped just under 96.300 amidst broad Usd declines, but still restrained trade overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY/YUAN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira maintained enough recovery momentum to trade a fraction above 5.7500 vs the Dollar, but stopped short of Thursday&rsquo;s circa 5.7000 high that is very close to a key Fib level and in volatile conditions reversed to hit 6.0000+ levels. Meanwhile, the PBoC halted a run of daily Cny depreciations via the official mid-point fix to leave the offshore Cnh off recent lows and also bolstered by the provision of 7 day liquidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highlighting the considerably improved risk tone, the Kiwi is making a more concerted effort to form a base at 0.6600 vs its US counterpart, while the Aud has extended above 0.7250 again, though still unable to reach 0.7300 with technical resistance just a head of the big figure and the RBA reiterating no rush or rationale to raise rates anytime soon (Governor Low overnight and message rammed home by Ellis earlier today).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best G10s, as the single currency revisits 1.1400 vs the Greenback where big option expiries run off today (1.9 bn from the big figure to 1.1410) and Usd/Jpy retreats from 111.00 again and also eyes hefty expiry interest, with 2.2 bn at the 110.50 strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All mildly firmer vs the Usd, with the Loonie pivoting around 1.3150 ahead of Canadian CPI data later and wary of option-related flows as well given 1.8 bn between 1.3145-50. The Franc is also within recent ranges and contained from 0.9945-80, while Cable is holding above 1.2700 and just failed to re-test residual stops at 1.2750. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

However, during hours President Trump said that China is not able to give the US a deal which is acceptable, which slightly soured sentiment, resulting in small pivot for the futures to the downside. Today&rsquo;s performance was helped along by the continuing easing tensions with regards to Turkey (and EM in general, as the CNH strengthened against the USD), while metals prices were also on the rise today, following the prior day&rsquo;s slump. The Mini Dow outperformed following strong earnings from Walmart (WMT); however, the BUY initiation on Boeing (BA) from UBS saw the stock reach intraday highs of ~4%, provided an even larger boost to the DJI than WMT earnings.</p>\r\n",

(Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets traded somewhat indecisively due to a lack of data points overnight and amid a choppy CNH. The Chinese currency initially found support and briefly surpassed 6.8500 vs. USD after the PBoC strengthened its reference rate, which in turn provided a mild tailwind for China-exposed AUD/USD, and NZD/USD which attempted to reclaim the 0.6600 handle. EUR/USD and GBP/USD also recovered some lost ground against the greenback although the rebound was only modest, as the DXY remained defiant and held on to the majority of recent advances. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was relatively stable despite the increased risk appetite, with the pair contained by resistance around 111.00 and alongside the non-committal tone across currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA Governor Lowe reiterated that he expects the next move in rates to be a hike and that the board&#39;s view was that central bank will hold steady for a while yet. Furthermore, Lowe added the economy is likely to make further gradual progress on inflation and unemployment, while he also stated that there is no strong case for near-term interest rate change and that the probability of a rate cut is low barring a major crisis in China. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were steady overnight with WTI crude futures range bound amid a lack of catalysts and with price action capped as the USD 65.50/bbl level acts as near-term resistance. The metals complex was also uneventful in which gold exhibited calmness after this week&rsquo;s EM/USD-induced storm which dragged prices to a more than 2&frac12;-year low and with the precious metal on track for its largest weekly decline since May last year. Elsewhere, copper was similarly indecisive and failed to benefit from the mostly positive risk tone amid muted trade across commodities and underperformance in its largest consumer China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CME raised NYMEX palladium futures margins to USD 6050 from USD 5500 per contract and raised NYMEX platinum futures margins to USD 2090 from USD 1870 per contract, while CME also raised COMEX futures margins to USD 3100 from 2800 per contract.

(Twitter) There were also prior comments from US President Trump that Turkey has not turned out to be a great friend, while US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin commented that more sanctions are prepared for Turkey if Pastor Brunson is not released. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Pompeo is to form an &#39;Iran action group&#39;, while he also commented that the US hopes to one day soon reach an agreement with Iran. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US administration official said President Trump and Russian President Putin agreed in principle that Iran should exit Syria, although the official added that Russia sees this as a difficult task.

(CNN)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex took its cue from a more constructive risk backdrop, with signs that the US is moving to ease trade tensions with China. Yields didn&rsquo;t move too much, however, Treasuries found some buyers after a weak Philly Fed survey. But with that said, the bias was towards modestly higher yields, although major curve spreads saw another round of modest flattening. US 10-year T-notes settled 5+ ticks lower at 120-08+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he wants China to do well and that President Xi is a friend, although he also commented that China is not able to give the US a deal which is acceptable. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said he is hopeful of a breakthrough in NAFTA negotiations in the next few days and that US President Trump has said it is okay if there is not a breakthrough. In related news, there were also comments from Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guarjardo that Mexico is still working towards a NAFTA deal with US and that all partners must show some flexibility in talks.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mostly higher as the region tracked the performance on Wall St where all majors gained as sentiment was buoyed by trade optimism from the announcement of upcoming US-China trade talks. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) were both higher although the former somewhat lagged after having stalled at fresh highs last seen in over a decade, while gains in Japanese exporters were contained by a stable currency. Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) both initially conformed to the positive risk tone amid the trade-related hopes, continued PBoC liquidity efforts and as Hong Kong-heavyweight Tencent also rebounded from post-earnings losses, although the Shanghai Comp. eventually gave back its gains and then some, as sentiment deteriorated across the mainland. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains as prices rebounded from the prior day&rsquo;s weakness and with the BoJ also in the market under its bond buying programme.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are higher across the board as the region tracks the performance on Wall St where all majors gained as sentiment was buoyed by trade optimism after the announcement of upcoming US-China trade talks. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) are both higher although the former lags behind its peers as the index somewhat stalls after hitting highs last seen in over a decade, while gains in Japanese exporters are capped by a stable currency. Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) also conform to the positive risk tone amid the trade-related hopes and after the PBoC continued with its liquidity efforts, while Hong Kong-heavyweight Tencent also rebounds from post-earnings losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets trade somewhat indecisive due to a lack of data points overnight and amid a choppy CNH. The Chinese currency initially found support and briefly surpassed 6.8500 vs. USD after the PBoC strengthened its reference rate, which in turn provided a mild tailwind for China-exposed AUD/USD, and NZD/USD which attempted to reclaim the 0.6600 handle. EUR/USD and GBP/USD also recovered some lost ground against the greenback although the rebound was only modest, as the DXY remained defiant and held on to the majority of recent advances. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was relatively stable despite the increased risk appetite, with the pair contained by resistance around 111.00 and alongside the non-committal tone across currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains as prices rebound from the prior day&rsquo;s weakness and with the BoJ also in the market under its bond buying programme.</p>\r\n",
