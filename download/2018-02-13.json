(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand Food Price Index (Jan) 1.2% (Prev. -0.8%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />NORTH AMERICA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Powell stated that the Fed are in the process of gradually normalising rates and the Fed is to &#39;remain alert&#39; to financial stability risks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Mester stated that she supports rate increases at a pace similar to last year, but will watch the impact of tax and other fiscal policy changes. She later said upside risks to the forecast more salient than they have been for some time. Furthermore, there were also reports that Mester is among the candidates for Fed Vice Chair. (Newswires/WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said NAFTA progress is being made especially with Mexico, while there were also comments from Canada&rsquo;s Chief NAFTA Negotiator who stated they are conscious the US could implement a NAFTA pull out but noted Canada is ready for that.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD continued to give back the gains seen last week, amid the apparent risk-off flows, and the DXY trades 0.5% softer heading into APAC trade, having slipped through 90. JPY was a notable gainer, helped along by the greenback weakness as well as overnight headlines by Japan PM Abe suggesting that he has a &ldquo;blank slate&rdquo; for choosing the next BOJ governor (hinting that Kuroda&rsquo;s reappointment isn&rsquo;t a done-deal). Other havens were also bid, though gold price action is struggling with the $1330 level. The EUR has made its way back up to the 1.2350 level. GBP jumped after CPI data vindicated the BOE&rsquo;s recent hawkishness, though cable struggled to remain above the 1.39 handle. EMFX couldn&rsquo;t take advantage of USD weakness, though ZAR trades will be keeping an ear out for newsflow tomorrow morning following Zuma&rsquo;s announcement on his Presidency after the ANC demanded he step down.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk504673747\">COMMODITIES</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (5 Feb, w/e) 3.947M vs. Exp. 2.800M (Prev. -1.05M).

Global oil supply fell to 97.7mln in January, although is up 1.3mln bpd Y/Y. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kremlin said Russia remains committed to the OPEC production cuts. Russian Energy Minister Novak then stated that OPEC and Non-OPEC allies need to act very cautiously and avoid knee-jerk reactions in respect of new decisions. Later on he stated oil inventories are shrinking despite rising production in US, 2018 average oil price is seen closer to USD 60/bbl. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraq oil minister stated that there is no current discussion over exiting supply cut agreement and any discussion on supply cut agreements can wait until December. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libya National Oil Company (NOC) reports Zawiya oil field is operating at 70% capacity.

In afternoon trade, major indices pared back losses on little news, with some traders talking about technical levels (100d MA) playing a role. In sector specific news, energy was tracking crude weakness. Healthcare suffered after reports that Amazon was set to push into the sector, as well as the US FTC&rsquo;s complaint against dental firms weighing on some name. S&amp;P 500 +0.26% at 2663, Nasdaq +0.46 at 6554, and DJIA Up 0.16% at 24640</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top sectors: Consumer Cyclicals +0.70%, Consumer Non-Cyclicals +0.60% and Financials +0.50%<br />Bottom sectors: Energy -0.45%, Materials -0.18% and Healthcare +0.03%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USTs were mixed, though yields have remained in their recent range, with 10-year lingering around the 2.85% mark. Ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s CPI data, the odds of a March hike are just shy of 80%. After January&rsquo;s nonfarm payroll data showed wage inflation rising above expectations, attention will be on the January CPI data for confirmation of the trend in price pressures. In wake of the NFP data, markets aggressively repriced their expectations for Fed rates hikes in 2018 as real yields rose. Some suggest that a disappointing print raises the potential of a correction of that pricing, while a beat may give credence to the notion that the Fed may lift rates four times this year. 10 year.

Healthcare suffered after reports that Amazon was set to push into the sector, as well as the US FTC&rsquo;s complaint against dental firms weighing on some names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk506318655\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk506318552\"><strong>TREASURIES: &nbsp;10 year T-note futures settle 3+ ticks higher at 121-00</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USTs are mixed, though yields have remained in their recent range, with 10-year lingering around the 2.85% mark. Ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s CPI data, the odds of a March hike are just shy of 80%. After January&rsquo;s nonfarm payroll data showed wage inflation rising above expectations, attention will be on the January CPI data for confirmation of the trend in price pressures. In wake of the NFP data, markets aggressively repriced their expectations for Fed rates hikes in 2018 as real yields rose. Some suggest that a disappointing print raises the potential of a correction of that pricing, while a beat may give credence to the notion that the Fed may lift rates four times this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY trades 0.5% lower heading into APAC trade. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD continued to give back the gains seen last week, amid the apparent risk-off flows, and the DXY trades 0.5% softer heading into APAC trade, having slipped through 90. JPY was a notable gainer, helped along by the greenback weakness as well as overnight headlines by Japan PM Abe suggesting that he has a &ldquo;blank slate&rdquo; for choosing the next BOJ governor (hinting that Kuroda&rsquo;s reappointment isn&rsquo;t a done-deal). Other havens were also bid, though gold price action is struggling with the $1330 level. The EUR has made its way back up to the 1.2350 level. GBP jumped after CPI data vindicated the BOE&rsquo;s recent hawkishness, though cable struggled to remain above the 1.39 handle. EMFX couldn&rsquo;t take advantage of USD weakness, though ZAR trades will be keeping an ear out for newsflow tomorrow morning following Zuma&rsquo;s announcement on his Presidency after the ANC demanded he step down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 10 cents lower at USD 59.19 per barrel; Brent futures settle 13 cents higher at USD 62.72 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the OPEC and EIA reports earlier in the week, there wasn&rsquo;t much for oil bulls to latch onto in the IEA&rsquo;s monthly report; the organisation forecast global supply will outstrip demand in 2018, raising its demand growth forecast by 1.4mln barrels per day. Crude was mixed, generally toying around the neutral line ahead of the API inventory data, due for release aftermarket.&nbsp; This week, analysts expect crude stocks to build by 2.8mln barrels, Cushing is expected to draw by 2.5mln, distillates are seen drawing by 1.1mln and gasoline stocks are forecast to build 1.2mln.</p>\r\n",

However, the Usd had already managed to stem the tide vs the outperforming Jpy as the headline pair &lsquo;based&rsquo; just below 107.50 and ahead of the 30 DMA at 107.40, perhaps wary about huge barriers noted at 107.00. Usd/Cad broke out of its tight am range and above 1.2600, through 1.2620 resistance (100 DMA) and touched 1.2625 just in time for the NY cut and a 360 mn option expiry. Aud/Usd may also have had option interest capping price movement with 820 mn running off between 0.8050-60, while Nzd/Usd slipped back from 0.7300+ peaks as its US peer regained some composure. Cable remained relatively firm on above forecast UK inflation data, albeit unable to sustain gains above 1.3900 as Eur/Gbp edged towards 0.8900 and Eur/Usd inched above 1.2350. Lots more choppy trade in Usd/Zar as the ANC-Zuma stalemate rumbles on, and the Rand ultimately weakened (11.9700 vs 11.8800 at one stage) as the under pressure President resisted latest attempts to replace him with Ramaphosa. He is now due to respond to a recall and Wednesday&rsquo;s Cabinet meet is postponed awaiting his reply.</p>\r\n",

GBP firmer as UK inflation exceeds expectations (3.0% Y/Y vs. Exp. 2.9%)</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Looking ahead, highlights include APIs, Japanese GDP and Fed&rsquo;s Mester</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian stocks traded mostly higher as the region cheered the continued rebound on Wall St. where all majors finished with firm gains and the S&amp;P 500 posted its best 2-day performance in over 2 years. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.6%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.7%)</strong> both opened higher in which mining-related sectors led in Australia, while Japanese stocks were initially outperformed buoyed as participants played catch up on return from holiday, although a firmer currency later saw gains wiped out. Elsewhere, <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+1%)</strong> and <strong>Hang Seng (+1.3%)</strong> were jubilant heading closer to the Lunar New Year holidays and after the PBoC announced to lend CNY 393bln through the 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility. Furthermore, there was a decline in money market rates in which the 1-week CNH HIBOR fell by the most so far in 2018, and the latest Chinese lending data also showed both New Yuan Loans and Aggregate Financing surged from prior. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid similar range-bound trade overnight in T-notes and although the BoJ were present in the market under its bond-buying program, this was kept at a reserved amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese PM Abe said he is undecided on the next BoJ Governor, while Abe also stated that it is up to the BoJ to decide specific monetary policy measures and that he expects the BoJ to continue taking bold measures to achieve price stability. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations but announced CNY 393bln 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3247 (Prev. 6.3001)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian NAB Business Confidence (Jan) 12 vs. Exp. 10 (Prev. 11).

Materials stand out as an outperforming sector amid the US infrastructure plans released yesterday whilst metals are extending gains: Gold (+0.4%), Silver (+0.1%), Copper (+0.8%). Telecoms underperform with BT (-1.2%) at the bottom of the FTSE 100 awaiting news from the Premier League TV rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yen strength the main overnight and early European theme, as <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong> breached last Friday&rsquo;s 108.05 low to the downside before overcoming barrier and psychological support at 108.00 on its way to fresh 5 month lows around 107.55. Bids reportedly in the 107.70 area were also filled in pretty short order as risk aversion ratcheted higher, but it remains unclear whether heightened demand for the <strong>Jpy</strong> (and <strong>Chf</strong> to a lesser degree) was prompted by the Nikkei&rsquo;s failure to maintain catch-up gains after Japan&rsquo;s long holiday weekend or vice-versa. 107.50-45 next in sight for <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong>, with buying interest not really seen until the low 107.30 area (including last year&rsquo;s 107.32 low), while cross demand is also rife as <strong>Gbp</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong> falls below the 150.00 handle. GBP firmer after higher than expected inflation figures (3.0 vs. Exp. 2.9% Y/Y), however the rise had been short-lived, given that the headline figure had been in line with the BoE&rsquo;s forecast. <strong>Nzd</strong> another noted beneficiary of US Dollar weakness as the Index loses grip of 90.000 again, with the Kiwi reclaiming 0.7300 status and in part also gaining some impetus from <strong>Aud</strong> underperformance amidst mixed sentiment readings overnight and RBA rhetoric &ndash; <strong>Aud</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> above 0.7850, but <strong>Aud</strong>/<strong>Nzd</strong> back under 1.0800. Other <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>G10</strong> major pairings more contained, albeit still showing a generally softer Greenback, with <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> regaining 1.2300, Cable around 1.3850 eyeing UK inflation data and <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Cad</strong> sub-1.2600. Elsewhere, <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Zar</strong> still in focus and testing recent lows (currently circa 11.9000) ahead of an ANC briefing at 12GMT, with President Zuma still resisting efforts to remove him from office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>Short</strong> <strong>Sterling</strong> contracts declining to fresh Liffe session lows in wake of the headline inflation data beat that may not ultimately alter the near term BoE policy path, but clearly means that a May hike is more likely, especially if CPI is expected to overshoot target again. The core 10 year bond just reversed through 121.00 to a 120.97 intraday base (-17 ticks) and the 3 month strip is 1-3 ticks below parity. Even <strong>Bunds</strong> seem to have recoiled a bit in sympathy, but remain firmer on the day as the periphery trades down to new intraday lows ahead of Italian auctions (BTPs under pressure in particular predictably). <strong>USTs</strong> are still bid after yesterday&rsquo;s sell-off and advance in yields with the long end marginally outperforming amidst curve re-flattening trades and outright RM buying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korean Leader Kim said need to continue good atmosphere with South Korea and it&rsquo;s important to liven up the warm climate of reconciliation &amp; dialogue. (KCNA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US VP Pence stated that strong new sanctions are coming soon on North Korea and that policy towards North Korea remains unchanged. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GLOBAL NEWS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa&#39;s ANC party has to remove President Zuma as head of state, although President Zuma was earlier reported to have refused to resign and was also said to want a 3-month &lsquo;notice period&rsquo; before resigning. (Newswires/Business Day) It was then later reported, that the ANC Secretary has gone to see Zuma to tell him the party has decided to dismiss him as head of state; according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theme continues for the oil markets, more supply is set to come from US shale producers. A report from the EIA yesterday noted that shale production for crude is to rise by 100k bbls in March, while another report this morning from the IEA expects US supply to grow more than demand in 2018, with US seen topping Russian production at year-end; as such both WTI and Brent have been pressured throughout the morning with the former briefly slipping below USD 59.00bbl. In metals markets, gold prices are near one-week highs amid the softer USD which has dictated a bulk of the price action for precious metals. Elsewhere, China have voiced concerns over US protectionism over steel, whilst aluminium prices have been pressured by building stockpiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IEA have upgraded their forecast for global oil demand growth to 1.4mln bpd in 2018 from 1.3mln, however they say Non-OPEC supply, led by US, which is likely to grow more than demand in 2018. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraq oil minister states that there is no current discussion over exiting supply cut agreement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that OPEC and Non-OPEC allies need to act very cautiously and avoid knee-jerk reactions in respect of new decisions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libya&#39;s Waha oil refinery is undergoing maintenance to boost output capacity.

        "subject": "EU MID SESSION UPDATE: Nikkei 225 pressures European bourses, UK CPI above expectations, oil slumps as fears grow over rampant US production",
        "content": "<p>European equities this morning opened on a negative foot (Eurostoxx 50 -0.3%) as compared with the positive trading sessions in Asia ex Japan and the US. A risk-off tone is in the atmosphere with all major bourses in the red. Materials stand out as an outperforming sector amid the US infrastructure plans released yesterday whilst metals are extending gains: Gold (+0.4%), Silver (+0.1%), Copper (+0.8%). On the other hand, Telecom is a clear underperformer with BT (-1.2%) at the bottom of the FTSE 100 awaiting news from the Premier League TV rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yen strength the main overnight and early European theme, as Usd/Jpy breached last Friday&rsquo;s 108.05 low to the downside before overcoming barrier and psychological support at 108.00 on its way to fresh 5 month lows around 107.55. Bids reportedly in the 107.70 area were also filled in pretty short order as risk aversion ratcheted higher, but it remains unclear whether heightened demand for the Jpy (and Chf to a lesser degree) was prompted by the Nikkei&rsquo;s failure to maintain catch-up gains after Japan&rsquo;s long holiday weekend or vice-versa. 107.50-45 next in sight for Usd/Jpy, with buying interest not really seen until the low 107.30 area (including last year&rsquo;s 107.32 low) , while cross demand is also rife as Gbp/Jpy falls below the 150.00 handle. GBP firmer after higher than expected inflation figures (3.0 vs. Exp. 2.9% Y/Y), however the rise had been short-lived, given that the headline figure had been in line with the BoE&rsquo;s forecast. Nzd another noted beneficiary of US Dollar weakness as the Index loses grip of 90.000 again, with the Kiwi reclaiming 0.7300 status and in part also gaining some impetus from Aud underperformance amidst mixed sentiment readings overnight and RBA rhetoric &ndash; Aud/Usd above 0.7850, but Aud/Nzd back under 1.0800. Other Usd/G10 major pairings more contained, albeit still showing a generally softer Greenback, with Eur/Usd regaining 1.2300, Cable around 1.3850 eyeing UK inflation data and Usd/Cad sub-1.2600. Elsewhere, Usd/Zar still in focus and testing recent lows (currently circa 11.9000) ahead of an ANC briefing at 12GMT, with President Zuma still resisting efforts to remove him from office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts and Short Sterling contracts declining to fresh Liffe session lows in wake of the headline inflation data beat that may not ultimately alter the near term BoE policy path, but clearly means that a May hike is more likely, especially if CPI is expected to overshoot target again. The core 10 year bond just reversed through 121.00 to a 120.97 intraday base (-17 ticks) and the 3 month strip is 1-3 ticks below parity. Even Bunds seem to have recoiled a bit in sympathy, but remain firmer on the day as the periphery trades down to new intraday lows ahead of Italian auctions (BTPs under pressure in particular predictably). USTs are still bid after yesterday&rsquo;s sell-off and advance in yields with the long end marginally outperforming amidst curve re-flattening trades and outright RM buying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theme continues for the oil markets, more supply is set to come from US shale producers. A report from the EIA yesterday noted that shale production for crude is to rise by 100k bbls in March, while another report this morning from the IEA expects US supply to grow more than demand in 2018, with you US seen topping Russian production at year-end.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Yen strength the main overnight and early European theme, as Usd/Jpy breached last Friday&rsquo;s 108.05 low to the downside before overcoming barrier and psychological support at 108.00 on its way to fresh 5 month lows around 107.55. Bids reportedly in the 107.70 area were also filled in pretty short order as risk aversion ratcheted higher, but it remains unclear whether heightened demand for the Jpy (and Chf to a lesser degree) was prompted by the Nikkei&rsquo;s failure to maintain catch-up gains after Japan&rsquo;s long holiday weekend or vice-versa. 107.50-45 next in sight for Usd/Jpy, with buying interest not really seen until the low 107.30 area (including last year&rsquo;s 107.32 low) , while cross demand is also rife as Gbp/Jpy falls below the 150.00 handle. Nzd another noted beneficiary of US Dollar weakness as the Index loses grip of 90.000 again, with the Kiwi reclaiming 0.7300 status and in part also gaining some impetus from Aud underperformance amidst mixed sentiment readings overnight and RBA rhetoric &ndash; Aud/Usd above 0.7850, but Aud/Nzd back under 1.0800. Other Usd/G10 major pairings more contained, albeit still showing a generally softer Greenback, with Eur/Usd regaining 1.2300, Cable around 1.3850 eyeing UK inflation data and Usd/Cad sub-1.2600. Elsewhere, Usd/Zar still in focus and testing recent lows (currently circa 11.9000) ahead of an ANC briefing at 12GMT, with President Zuma still resisting efforts to remove him from office.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asia stocks traded mostly higher as the region cheered the continued rebound on Wall St. where all majors finished with firm gains and the S&amp;P 500 posted its best 2-day performance in over 2 years. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) both opened higher in which mining-related sectors led in Australia, while Japanese stocks were initially outperformed buoyed as participants played catch up on return from holiday, although a firmer currency later saw gains wiped out. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+1.1%) and Hang Seng (+1.3%) were jubilant heading closer to the Lunar New Year holidays and after the PBoC announced to lend CNY 393bln through the 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility. Furthermore, there was a decline in money market rates in which the 1-week CNH HIBOR fell by the most so far in 2018, and the latest Chinese lending data also showed both New Yuan Loans and Aggregate Financing surged from prior. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid similar range-bound trade overnight in T-notes and although the BoJ were present in the market under its bond-buying program, this was kept at a reserved amount.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) are both higher with mining-related sectors leading in Australia, while Japanese stocks are buoyed as participants play catch up on return from holiday. Shanghai Comp. (+2.0%) and Hang Seng (+2.0%) are even more jubilant heading closer to the Lunar New Year holidays and after the PBoC announced to lend CNY 393bln through 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility, while the latest Chinese lending data also showed both New Yuan Loans and Aggregate Financing surged from prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are quiet with most majors holding on to Monday&rsquo;s gains against the greenback. ZAR was in focus overnight and saw weakness on political uncertainty after reports the ruling ANC decided to recall President Zuma, who remained defiant and refused to resign. Elsewhere, AUD found brief support from an improvement in NAB business surveys, while USD/JPY was momentarily pressured on mild disappointment after PM Abe suggested that BoJ Governor Kuroda&rsquo;s reappointment for a 2<sup>nd</sup> term is not yet a forgone conclusion as he was said to be undecided on the next BoJ Governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid similar range-bound trade in USTs and although the BoJ are present in the market under its bond-buying program, this was kept at a reserved amount.</p>\r\n",
