(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Dudley (voter, neutral) said inflation being slightly higher than 2% is not an issue. (BBG TV)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Williams (voter, hawkish) said wage growth is on an upward trend, but not picking up fast. (CNBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, neutral) everything he sees tells him there&#39;s a little more wage pressure; best estimate of neutral rate is 2.50%-2.75%. (CNBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*CHINA TRADE: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US trade delegation left China with no firm agreement and reports suggested neither side left too happy. China was said to have felt the US proposals were unfair, which included China narrowing its goods surplus by USD 200bln by 2020. China was said to have told the US it would increase its goods imports and lower tariffs on certain goods. The White House issued a statement, saying that the US President Trump will make his next decision after being briefed by the delegation. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*DATA: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US Non-Farm Payrolls (Apr)</strong> 164k vs. Exp. 192k (Prev. 103k, Rev. 135k); 2-month net revision +30k</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US Average Earnings YY (Apr)</strong> 2.6% vs. Exp. 2.70% (Prev. 2.70% Rev. 2.6%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Average Earnings MM (Apr)</strong> 0.1% (Exp. 0.2%, Prev. 0.3% Rev. 0.2%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline payrolls figure was slightly softer than expected, coming in at 164k (exp. 192k), earnings were also soft - &nbsp;headline printing 2.6% (exp. 2.7%), also the previous was revised lower from 2.7% to 2.6%. On a positive note, the unemployment rate was lower than expected at 3.9% (exp. 4.0%) and at its lowest level since 2000. Markets initially sold US$ on the headline miss and lower than expected wage growth, however, this was reversed as traders digest the report, remembering there is still another job report to come before the next Fed decision where markets have fully priced in a 25bps hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*EQUITIES: SPX +1.3% at 2663, NDX +1.9% at 6769, DJI +1.4% at 24263. SECTORS:</strong> Cons Cyclicals: +1.4%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +1.3%, Energy: +0.5%, Financials: +1.3%, Health Care: +0.8%, Industrials: +1.1%, Materials: +1.3%, Technology: +2.0%, Telecoms: +0.8%, Utilities: +0.4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Equity futures traded with little action before Wall St open where an initial spike lower was seen as the S&amp;P 500 opened below the 200DMA of 2615 to intraday lows of 2612 before bouncing back and rallying throughout the trading session. The DJIA was lifted by Apple after Warren Buffett said he&rsquo;d bought a further 75mln shares, taking the stock to its highest level of all time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*COMMODITIES: WTI settles $1.29 higher at $69.72/bbl; Brent settles $ higher at $/bbl. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures both posted firm gains with crude markets jumpy ahead of the May 12th deadline for any announcements on Iran sanctions, which could affect oil production in one of the larger members of OPEC. However, the late rally was capped as WTI failed to breach USD 70/bbl and Brent retreated after briefly touching USD 75/bbl. A fifth consecutive week of oil drillers adding rigs also helped cap any further gains.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count (27 Apr) 1032 (Prev. 1021)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count (27 Apr) 834 (Prev. 825)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Gas Rig Count (27 Apr) 196 (Prev. 195)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*TREASURIES: </strong><strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 0.5 ticks higher at 119-22+. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk513229231\">US yields shifted higher after the Nonfarm Payrolls report, to close the session little changed on the day. The equity surge helped push treasuries lower and the curve saw some flattening with the 2-year yield up over 1.5bps. The pull back also came as markets position for next week&rsquo;s monster supply, as the Treasury is set to issue USD 73bln in 3-, 10- and 30-year paper next week. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FOREX:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD had a mixed day after Friday&rsquo;s NFP data, first declining on the soft earnings and lower headline but then reversing forecast with some pointing to the unemployment rate dropping to a 3 handle being enough to encourage dip buyers. The slightly softer report is unlikely to derail the Fed from hiking in June, and none of the Fed speakers in the afternoon did anything to change that view. The reversal in the USD saw GBP/USD and EUR/USD both drop to their lowest levels since January. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Greenback rally was derailed by a not so hawkish FOMC on Wednesday as the expected upgrade to the outlook for inflation was countered by a less upbeat growth assessment and somewhat contracted by a surprise symmetrical approach to the price mandate. However, the Usd was only temporarily unsettled by a sub-forecast payroll number and softer than forecast average earnings, with a dip in the jobless rate to 3.9% perhaps enough to encourage dip buyers. The index rebounded to register another new 2018 high around 92.900, with 93.000 the obvious attraction ahead of more technical rather than sentimental upside levels on the charts (93.163 and more compelling resistance just over 93.500).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD/EUR/GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All around 0.5% down vs the Dollar on the day, but much bigger losers over the week as the Kiwi failed to keep hold of the 0.7000 handle amidst bearish cross-winds, while the Eur was undermined by soft Eurozone inflation data and dovish ECB policy signals on balance, with the single currency sliding from 1.2100+ vs the Usd to a marginal new 2018 low just above 1.1900. Meanwhile, Cable&rsquo;s meltdown alongside dwindling May BoE rate hike prospects continued amidst mostly weaker than expected UK PMIs carried on, with the pair now at risk of relinquishing 1.3500 having filled corporate buying interest and breached its 200 DMA. For the record, Cable was not far from 1.3800 at one stage this week, albeit on Monday, which was the last trading day of April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD/AUD/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatively contained losses vs the Usd, with the Loonie recovering from another 1.2900+ visit amidst a rebound in oil prices, strong Canadian IVEY PMIs and ongoing hopes that remaining NAFTA disputes will be settled. The Aud benefited from the firm bounce above 1.0700 vs the Nzd and Chinese Caixin PMI beats, with 0.7500 vs the Usd reclaimed in the process. However, the Franc is struggling to hold parity vs the Usd after yet more SNB pledges to intervene and maintain negative rates to curb Chf demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lone G10 currency to hold its own vs the Usd on NFP Friday, though weaker on the week overall, as 109.00 assumed pivotal status within a new higher range and the headline pair retreated some way below before rebounding towards decent option interest around the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK/NOK/EM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes as the Scandi crowns made gains vs the Eur on divergent ECB vs Riksbank and Norges Bank policy outlooks/guidance, but the Try, Rub and Rand depreciated markedly vs the Usd on a mixture of political, economic, diplomatic and capital outflow factors.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.5%) was negative with the index dragged by financials and most commodity-related sectors, while KOSPI (-0.7%) also traded downbeat as index heavyweight Samsung Electronics slumped on its re-open from a 50-to-1 stock split. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp.

This comes as well as Chinese officials believing that the US trade delegations proposals were unfair. The US trade delegation has now left Beijing. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ireland reportedly has the support of EU leaders to veto Brexit trade agreement and collapse discussions next month if PM May fails to push through a customs agreement which averts a hard border for Northern Ireland. Furthermore, reports added that EU officials warned that negotiations on future partnership will be suspended at European summit next month until there is a solution to the customs issue. Ministers were told during a briefing earlier this week that UK may not be able to leave customs union for another 5 years as it may take that long to prepare the technology required to operate the border. (Times/Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Conservatives have seen off a Labour assault on their flagship councils in London, with both parties losing control of key areas elsewhere in across the nation. The Conservatives appeared to benefit most from a sharp reduction in the Ukip vote, making progress outside the capital in the largest test of public opinion since last year&rsquo;s snap election. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NIESR lowered its GDP forecast for 2018 to just under 1.5% from 1.9% mainly due to weak performance in Q1, but said the slowdown is likely to be temporary.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities tracking higher ahead of US NFP data later on in the day, with the outperforming bourse the SMI (+0.6%). The CAC (-0.1%) underperforming due to disappointing results from Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale (-6.9%). This alongside further financial misses for HSBC (-3%) and BNP Paribas (-2.7%) is dragging on the financial sector, currently down -0.4%. Some encouragement found in BASF (+1.1%), as well as EDF (+0.8%), whom announced the largest energy acquisition of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar remains relatively firm overall, and especially against EM currencies that continue to collapse (ie Lira slumping to fresh record lows vs the Greenback near 4.2600). However, the DXY is still consolidating off recent peaks set before the FOMC (new 2018 high around 92.800), with bulls perhaps wary about getting too carried away after hawkish Fed expectations were somewhat overdone, or at least undone by the shift to a symmetrical inflation target. Technically, the aforementioned new ytd best forms nearest resistance, while there is little of note on the downside ahead of 92.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A marginal outperformer within the G10 basket and pulling back further from highs just above 110.00 to test bids/buying interest at 109.00 and briefly below overnight, but with trading volumes still impacted by the lack of Japanese participants. Decent 108.75-85 option expiry interest (1 bn) could come into play on a weak US jobs report or bad news on the US-China trade talks front</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tussle down under rages on, and the Aud is stretching its legs having overtaken the Kiwi late yesterday with the cross staging a firmer rebound above 1.0700 and Eur/Usd down through 1.5900 in wake of firmer than forecast Chinese Caixin PMIs, rather than anything fresh or Aud supportive from the RBA&rsquo;s SOMP. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd is looking precarious again close to 0.7000</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP/EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All softer vs the Dollar after Usd/Chf dabbled with parity again on Thursday, while Cable is testing reported bidding interest between 1.3550-20 again and only a few pips off the 200 DMA (1.3539) on more negative Brexit impulses and another UK GDP downgrade. Eur/Usd capped by its 200 DMA (1.2015-20) and a 1.2000 expiry, but still looking &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; supported ahead of a major Fib (1.1936) and the 2018 base (1.1916). Usd/Cad remains bid circa 1.2800 and toppy near 1.2900, but the Loonie is still suffering to an extent after yesterday&rsquo;s trade data revealed a record deficit &ndash; IVEY PMI due later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 month contracts are largely biding their time having ramped up significantly since early Q2 as strong May BoE rate hike prospects have been whittled away to almost no chance at all. However, Gilts have overcome an early Liffe wobble to rally up to 122.79 (+21 ticks vs -3 ticks at the low), partly in catch-up trade given relative closes vs Eurex and obviously the CBOT, but also and mainly on the much more dovish/less hawkish domestic policy outlook of late. Indeed, even the looming ultra-long syndicated issuance (2071) does not appear to be hampering UK debt, yet. For context, Bunds have extended the topside of their range, but only to 159.34 (+8 ticks) amidst little reaction to the final pan Eurozone services PMI, or latest headlines from China indicated some progress on the trade front with the US, but several unresolved issues. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are idling albeit flat to fractionally firmer for choice with a slight flattening bias ahead of NFP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at the commodities complex, oil is taking a breather from its recent bull run, with WTI (-0.2%) and Brent (-0.2%) off recent highs. Price action has been supported by the looming geological risk from possible new US sanctions against Iran. Iran&rsquo;s foreign minister said yesterday that US&rsquo;s demand to change its 2015 nuclear agreement was unacceptable as the May 12th deadline set by US President Trump approaches. Looking ahead, the weekly Baker Hughes rig count (1800BST/1200CDT) will take focus later in the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving onto metals, gold (-0.1%) prices have steadied ahead of key US jobs data due later today. In terms of base metals, copper has seen modest gains, while the red metal also weathered an early wobble seen in Dalian iron ore futures which slipped 2% at the open during the 1st day foreign investors were permitted to trade Chinese iron futures. Elsewhere, London base metal prices rose today, led by the rise in aluminium, climbing as much as 1.9% having fallen 2.3% in the previous session.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "EU MID SESSION UPDATE – Markets hold fire ahead of key US jobs data",
        "content": "<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities tracking higher ahead of US NFP data later on in the day, with the outperforming bourse the SMI (+0.6%). The CAC (-0.1%) underperforming due to disappointing results from Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale (-6.9%). This alongside further financial misses for HSBC (-3%) and BNP Paribas (-2.7%) is dragging on the financial sector, currently down -0.4%. Some encouragement found in BASF (+1.1%), as well as EDF (+0.8%), whom announced the largest energy acquisition of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at the commodities complex, oil is taking a breather from its recent bull run, with WTI (-0.2%) and Brent (-0.2%) off recent highs. Price action has been supported by the looming geological risk from possible new US sanctions against Iran. Iran&rsquo;s foreign minister said yesterday that US&rsquo;s demand to change its 2015 nuclear agreement was unacceptable as the May 12th deadline set by US President Trump approaches. Looking ahead, the weekly Baker Hughes rig count (1800BST/1200CDT) will take focus later in the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving onto metals, gold (-0.1%) prices have steadied ahead of key US jobs data due later today. In terms of base metals, copper has seen modest gains, while the red metal also weathered an early wobble seen in Dalian iron ore futures which slipped 2% at the open during the 1st day foreign investors were permitted to trade Chinese iron futures. Elsewhere, London base metal prices rose today, led by the rise in aluminium, climbing as much as 1.9% having fallen 2.3% in the previous session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 month contracts are largely biding their time having ramped up significantly since early Q2 as strong May BoE rate hike prospects have been whittled away to almost no chance at all. However, Gilts have overcome an early Liffe wobble to rally up to 122.79 (+21 ticks vs -3 ticks at the low), partly in catch-up trade given relative closes vs Eurex and obviously the CBOT, but also and mainly on the much more dovish/less hawkish domestic policy outlook of late. Indeed, even the looming ultra-long syndicated issuance (2071) does not appear to be hampering UK debt, yet. For context, Bunds have extended the topside of their range, but only to 159.34 (+8 ticks) amidst little reaction to the final pan Eurozone services PMI, or latest headlines from China indicated some progress on the trade front with the US, but several unresolved issues. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are idling albeit flat to fractionally firmer for choice with a slight flattening bias ahead of NFP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar remains relatively firm overall, and especially against EM currencies that continue to collapse (ie Lira slumping to fresh record lows vs the Greenback near 4.2600). However, the DXY is still consolidating off recent peaks set before the FOMC (new 2018 high around 92.800), with bulls perhaps wary about getting too carried away after hawkish Fed expectations were somewhat overdone, or at least undone by the shift to a symmetrical inflation target. Technically, the aforementioned new ytd best forms nearest resistance, while there is little of note on the downside ahead of 92.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A marginal outperformer within the G10 basket and pulling back further from highs just above 110.00 to test bids/buying interest at 109.00 and briefly below overnight, but with trading volumes still impacted by the lack of Japanese participants. Decent 108.75-85 option expiry interest (1 bn) could come into play on a weak US jobs report or bad news on the US-China trade talks front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tussle down under rages on, and the Aud is stretching its legs having overtaken the Kiwi late yesterday with the cross staging a firmer rebound above 1.0700 and Eur/Usd down through 1.5900 in wake of firmer than forecast Chinese Caixin PMIs, rather than anything fresh or Aud supportive from the RBA&rsquo;s SOMP. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd is looking precarious again close to 0.7000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP/EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All softer vs the Dollar after Usd/Chf dabbled with parity again on Thursday, while Cable is testing reported bidding interest between 1.3550-20 again and only a few pips off the 200 DMA (1.3539) on more negative Brexit impulses and another UK GDP downgrade. Eur/Usd capped by its 200 DMA (1.2015-20) and a 1.2000 expiry, but still looking &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; supported ahead of a major Fib (1.1936) and the 2018 base (1.1916). Usd/Cad remains bid circa 1.2800 and toppy near 1.2900, but the Loonie is still suffering to an extent after yesterday&rsquo;s trade data revealed a record deficit &ndash; IVEY PMI due later.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>3 month contracts are largely biding their time having ramped up significantly since early Q2 as strong May BoE rate hike prospects have been whittled away to almost no chance at all. However, Gilts have overcome an early Liffe wobble to rally up to 122.79 (+21 ticks vs -3 ticks at the low), partly in catch-up trade given relative closes vs Eurex and obviously the CBOT, but also and mainly on the much more dovish/less hawkish domestic policy outlook of late. Indeed, even the looming ultra-long syndicated issuance (2071) does not appear to be hampering UK debt, yet. For context, Bunds have extended the topside of their range, but only to 159.34 (+8 ticks) amidst little reaction to the final pan Eurozone services PMI, or latest headlines from China indicated some progress on the trade front with the US, but several unresolved issues.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, reports added that EU officials warned that negotiations on future partnership will be suspended at European summit next month until there is a solution to the customs issue. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ministers were told during a briefing earlier this week that UK may not be able to leave customs union for another 5 years as it may take that long to prepare the technology required to operate the border. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Conservatives have seen off a Labour assault on their flagship councils in London</strong>, with both parties losing control of key areas elsewhere in across the nation. The Conservatives appeared to benefit most from a sharp reduction in the Ukip vote, making progress outside the capital in the largest test of public opinion since last year&rsquo;s snap election. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NIESR lowered its GDP forecast for 2018 to just under 1.5% from 1.9% mainly due to weak performance in Q1, but said the slowdown is likely to be temporary. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In FX markets, price action was predominantly quiet amid tentativeness ahead of the key US jobs data</strong> which contained most major pairs near the prior session&rsquo;s levels. As such <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> traded sideways and just shy of 1.2000, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> was relatively unchanged and brushed aside the local council election results which have so far seen Labour remain with the largest number of councillors. Elsewhere, the greenback slightly softened as <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> briefly retreated below 109.00 and after the PBoC set a firmer fix, while <strong>AUD</strong> outperformed on cross-related flows in which <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>AUD</strong> slipped below 1.5900 and <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>NZD</strong> reclaimed the 1.0700 handle to the upside.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBA Statement on Monetary Policy</strong> stated board sees no strong case for a change in rates in the near-term and that higher rates are likely to be appropriate at some time if the economy improves as forecast. Furthermore, the RBA stated that significant strengthening of AUD would adversely impact growth and inflation, while it maintained its economic growth at 3.25% for December 2018, while forecasts for inflation and unemployment were slightly raised for December 2018. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were relatively quiet overnight in which <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures traded sideways above the USD 68/bbl level after the late support during US trade as stocks recovered from lows and risk sentiment improved. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> and <strong>copper</strong> were similarly uneventful but were kept afloat amid a softer greenback, while the red metal also weathered an early wobble seen in <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> ore futures which slipped 2% at the open during the 1<sup>st</sup> day foreign investors were permitted to trade Chinese iron futures.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump was said to order the Pentagon to consider a reduction in the number of US troops in South Korea, while there were also reports from South Korean press that North Korea agreed to fully denuclearize by 2020. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries closed slightly higher for the session, with action choppy (taking its cue from choppy trade in the equity complex) but within contained ranges ahead of NFP day tomorrow. Action was indecisive ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s payrolls data, and the AHE data will likely provide the next catalyst for the TPLEX. Most of the buying action was concentrated in the belly and front end of the curve as 2yr and 5yr yields were lower by c.2bps. 2s30s and 5s30s narrowed by c. 2bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 5+ ticks higher at 119-11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US and China are said to issue joint statement on trade to be released Friday morning</strong>, while it was reported that the sides are to shake hands and make peace, strengthen trade cooperation and cancel or revise number of trade indicators, according to Twitter reports citing CNN. (Twitter/CNN)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>White House Economist Calabria said the first day of talks with China have been pretty positive</strong> and that the US delegation will ask China to lower tariffs to match US levels. Calabria added that President Trump wants to see a free trade deal with Japan and is also optimistic on a tentative NAFTA deal before June. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House said it raised concerns with China about its latest militarisation of the South China Sea, while it added that the consequences will be in the short term and long term. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were initial reports that federal investigators wiretapped Trump&rsquo;s lawyer Cohen, but then NBC corrected the report and stated that federal investigators monitored and kept a log of Trump lawyer Cohen&#39;s phone calls but did not have a wiretap and were not listening in.

ASX 200 (-0.5%) is negative with the index dragged by financials and most commodity-related sectors, while KOSPI (-0.7%) is also downbeat with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics slumping on its re-open from a 50-to-1 stock split. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.8%) conform to the weakness following another liquidity drain by the PBoC and amid IPO activity in Hong Kong with Ping An Insurance unit Good Doctor failing to set-off fireworks in its debut, although mainland losses have been stemmed amid encouraging Caixin Composite and Services PMI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action is quiet amid tentativeness ahead of the key US jobs data which has seen most major pairs hold near the prior session&rsquo;s levels. As such EUR/USD trades sideways and just shy of 1.2000, while GBP/USD is relatively unchanged and has brushed aside the local council election results which have so far seen Labour remain with the largest number of councillors, although the Conservatives have gained the most ground. Elsewhere, the greenback is slightly softer with USD/JPY retreating below 109.00 and after the PBoC set a firmer fix, while AUD/USD also benefits on cross-related flows in which EUR/AUD slipped below 1.5900 and AUD/NZD reclaimed the 1.0700 handle to the upside. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
