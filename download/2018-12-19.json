        "content": "<p><strong>FOMC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FOMC raised the fed funds rate target by 25bps to 2.25% - 2.50% (vs. Prev. 2.00% - 2.25%), in line with the analyst median forecast. The central bank also narrowed the trajectory of rate hikes going forward, now envisaging two hikes in 2019, and one in 2020 (previously it had seen three hikes in 2019 and one in 2020). Crucially, the FOMC lowered its estimate of the neutral rate (to 2.8% from 3.0%). Additionally, the central bank softened its guidance on future rate hikes, saying that &ldquo;some further gradual increases&rdquo; to rates (versus the previous &ldquo;further gradual increases&rdquo;). In terms of risks to the outlook, the Fed continues to see these as &ldquo;roughly balanced&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his statement, Chair Powell said &ldquo;cross-currents&rdquo; have emerged, and the Fed has seen developments that signal softening ahead, though the developments have not fundamentally altered its outlook. Powell reiterated comments from October that policy is not on a pre-set course, and talked about the Fed&rsquo;s data-dependency. Powell said the FOMC sees some moderation of growth in 2019; tightening financial conditions and slower growth led the Fed to mark down inflation projections. Powell suggested that inflation trends can allow the Fed with patience in normalising policy. On the neutral rate, he suggested we are now at the bottom-end of the estimate of the neutral rate, while stating that there is a high degree of uncertainty about the path of future hikes; Powell stated that policy does not need to be accommodate and it was appropriate to be neutral. He also said the Fed took tightening financial conditions into account. On independence, Powell said political concerns played no role in the FOMC&rsquo;s deliberations, and nothing would deter the Fed from doing what it thinks it the right approach. Elsewhere, Fed Chair Powell said that balance sheet policy will remain on auto-pilot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC said to keep targeted medium term lending facility (TMLF) to support small and private enterprises which will be valid for 3 years.

The central bank also narrowed the trajectory of rate hikes going forward, now envisaging two hikes in 2019, and one in 2020 (previously it had seen three hikes in 2019 and one in 2020). Crucially, the FOMC lowered its estimate of the neutral rate (to 2.8% from 3.0%). Additionally, the central bank softened its guidance on future rate hikes, saying that &ldquo;some further gradual increases&rdquo; to rates (versus the previous &ldquo;further gradual increases&rdquo;). In terms of risks to the outlook, the Fed continues to see these as &ldquo;roughly balanced&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DECISION ANALYSIS: </strong>Markets initially reacted with caution, with ES (H19) falling from 2885 to 2860 (eventually finding a low of 2535 pre the Powell presser), and T-Notes (H19) initially fell to 120-22 from 120-26, before paring back and rising to 121-01 (sending 10-year yields to the lowest since May); EURUSD went from 1.1435 to around 1.14, USDJPY 112.20 to 112.40. Perhaps the reaction can be explained by the fact that the narrowing of the trajectory of normalisation are an acknowledgement of slowing growth momentum; additionally, with the Fed in data-dependency mode, it will examine data that is essentially backward-looking, which some suggest could lead to a slower reaction function if conditions were to deteriorate, potentially, opening the door to a policy error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHAIR POWELL PRESS CONFERENCE:</strong> In his statement, Chair Powell said &ldquo;cross-currents&rdquo; have emerged, and the Fed has seen developments that signal softening ahead, though the developments have not fundamentally altered its outlook. Powell reiterated comments from October that policy is not on a pre-set course, and talked about the Fed&rsquo;s data-dependency. Powell said the FOMC sees some moderation of growth in 2019; tightening financial conditions and slower growth led the Fed to mark down inflation projections. Powell suggested that inflation trends can allow the Fed with patience in normalising policy. On the neutral rate, he suggested we are now at the bottom-end of the estimate of the neutral rate, while stating that there is a high degree of uncertainty about the path of future hikes; Powell stated that policy does not need to be accommodate and it was appropriate to be neutral. He also said the Fed took tightening financial conditions into account. On independence, Powell said political concerns played no role in the FOMC&rsquo;s deliberations, and nothing would deter the Fed from doing what it thinks it the right approach. On the balance sheet, Powell said that the policy remained to allow run-offs to occur on autopilot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PRESS CONFERENCE ANALYSIS: </strong>Although Powell talked up the strength of the US economy, he struck a cautious tone; specifically, 2019 will see a slowdown of growth, and there was a high degree of uncertainty on the rate trajectory. Additionally, he does not believe policy needs to be accommodative, and said neutral policy was now appropriate, giving traders little reason to jump into risk. Through his press conference, ES futures continued to slide, printing a low of 2489.50, while the USD continued to appreciate (particularly against the CAD, and AUD, less so vs the EUR and JPY, perhaps since the Aussie was a cleaner trade, and additionally, commodities came under pressure after it was confirmed Libya&rsquo;s Sharara oil field was top reopen). T-Notes printed highs of 121-13+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US and China have clashed at WTO meeting, accusing each other of undermining multilateral trading system; an US trade ambassador argued that China is seeking to steal technology in strategic industries stating that &#39;this is not acceptable&#39; while a China envoy noted that &#39;reckless actions&#39; by the US are the cause of the current trading system crisis. Elsewhere, US President Trump tweeted about Mexico paying for the wall indirectly via US gains from USMCA deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; ITALY: </strong>Radiocor reported that the European Commission has decided not to open the EDP on Italy after accepting the 2.04% deficit target. Nonetheless, EU&#39;s Dombrovskis warned that the 2019 budget still raises concerns and therefore, should something go wrong, the EU can return to disciplinary action against the country in January. In related comments, PM Conte announced that citizens wage and pension reform will launch as intended; he confirmed that 2019 GDP growth is seen at 1% and he lowered the 2020 and 2021 deficit targets to 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EXISTING HOME SALES r</strong>ose 1.9% to 5.32mln from 5.22mln and came in above the 5.20mln expectations. Unlike housing starts and building permits on Tuesday, the gains were spread across both multi-family and single-family components. Analysts at Pantheon did not see a rebound coming so soon given recent poor weather conditions as well as the significant impact of wildfires in California. They also warn that the danger may not be over since there is a lag in the data. Looking ahead, Pantheon analysts don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;the revival to last beyond the spring,&rdquo; because they first anticipate mortgage rates to rebound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADIAN CPI</strong> softened in November and fell by 0.2% MM, pushing down the YY headline to 1.7% from 2.4%, slightly below the 1.8% consensus. Core measures posted at 1.9% YY not too far from the BoC inflation target of 2%; Scotiabank notes that &ldquo;maintaining it there provides additional breathing room for a near-term forecast pause over the coming pair of meetings&rdquo;. Looking at the components, the weakness in the data reflects the recent slump in oil prices while the strongest increase was seen in food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 0.96 HIGHER AT USD 47.20/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 0.98 HIGHER AT USD 57.24/BBL.</strong> Oil prices bounced back today after Monday&#39;s strong selloff after the DOE reported the third consecutive week of crude stocks draws. Macro sentiment improved on Wednesday as traders positioned for a dovish rate hike from the Federal Reserve, seeing WTI and Brent move higher together as US equity markets opened up into the green. However, some of the gains were pared back on the release of EIA inventories, which saw a draw of 497K barrels less than the expected draw of 2.4mln; some relief was seen in the products where distillates printed a draw of 4.2mln barrels, way below the expected build of 573K barrels. In other news-flow, the Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said Saudi would cut oil production in January by 400K BPD to 10.2mln BPD and adds he is certain cuts will be extended in April. Local reports from Libya said the 300K BPD capacity Sharara oilfield had reopened following an agreement met with protestors, although a protestor spokesperson later denied this, saying production would restart after their demands were met, as well as additional newswires reporting production was yet to resume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX -1.50% at 2506, NDX 2.19% at 6635, DJI -1.49% at 23322. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -1.30%, Materials -1.42%, Industrials -1.84%, Cons Discretionary -2.23%, Cons Staples -0.87%, Healthcare -1.39%, Financials -1.32%, Tech -2.10%, Telecoms +0.31%, Utilities -0.02%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) opened lower after FedEx reported below expected EPS figures and lowered its guidance. Micron (MU) nosedived on the open following a miss on revenue estimates and lowering guidance below consensus. Allergan (AGN) underperformed in early trade after it withdrew its texture based breast implants from European markets after evidence they may be linked to cancer. Under Armour (UAA) traded lower after a downgrade at Atlantic Equities. General Electric (GE) opened higher as it announced plans to spin off its health care unit in an IPO. Eli Lilly (LLY) outperformed on the open on the back of a dividend increase as well as raising guidance. General Mills (GIS) traded higher to start the day after it reported EPS above estimates and affirmed its guidance. Diamondback Energy (FANG) outperformed following it announcing its 2019 CAPEX plan and a rise in its quarterly dividend. Best Buy (BBY) benefitted from an upgrade at MoffettNathanson. Energy stocks rebounded today inline with the bounce back in crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE&nbsp; 10+ TICKS HIGHER AT 121-05+. </strong>Heading into the FOMC Meeting T-notes traded cautiously in a 120-26 -121-02 range; on the rate decision itself there was a two-way action with treasuries initially reticent to move before rising to 121-03. However, over the course of press conference, we saw further upside as Fed Chair Powell presented a cautious tone highlighting uncertainty ahead amid easing growth momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Dollar reclaimed the 97.00 handle in the wake of the Fed hiking rates by 25bps, paring back some of the losses vs G10 rivals and EM currencies suffered earlier in the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The single currency has extended gains vs the Dollar and across the board after confirmation that the EU has approved Italy&rsquo;s revised 2019 budget with a 2.04% deficit target, albeit conditionally, narrowly and subject to period review. Eur/Usd sitting around 1.375 after a cautious Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, JPY, CAD, GBP: </strong>The Kiwi slipped below 0.9800 in the aftermath of the Fed while NZ data in the form of Q3 GDP and November trade supported the pair earlier in the session. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy pushed towards 112.50, the Loonie below 1.3500 and Pound below 1.2650, all victims of USD strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CHF: </strong>Aussie close to 0.7100 in post-FOMC with losses exacerbated by the reopening of El Sharara oilfield (production has not restarted yet) while the Franc reclaimed 0.9900 and now towards 0.9950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; EM: </strong>Almost all benefiting to the detriment of the Usd, and especially recent laggards like the Try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: BoJ policy announcement due Thursday 20th December 2018. </strong>The BoJ will conclude its last policy meeting of the year on Thursday and no major fireworks are anticipated given unanimous expectations for the Central Bank to maintain its policy settings of negative rates at -0.1% and the long-term yield target at around 0.0%. In addition, the BoJ is expected to keep its flexible approach on yields and reaffirm forward guidance maintaining current extremely low rates for an extended period. The Japanese Central Bank is also seen keeping its long-term JGB buying guidelines (holdings to increase at an annual pace of around JPY 80tln). Goldman Sachs expects the BoJ&rsquo;s ETF and other purchase programmes to remain unchanged as well. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20794/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: Riksbank to publish rate decision on Thursday 20 December 2018 due at 08:30 GMT (02:30CST). </strong>The Rate decision is seen as &ldquo;one of the most contentious in recent memory&rdquo;. Particular focus will be set on commentary surrounding the poor Nov. growth and inflation figures. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20804/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PREVIEW</strong>: Bank of England Monetary Policy Decision and Minutes Thursday 20th December 12:00GMT (07:00ET). MPC expected to vote 9-0 in favour of standing pat on rates at 0.75%. Brexit uncertainty likely to tie the hands of policymakers. Markets looking to see if political jitters will impact the MPC&rsquo;s current rate outlook. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20808/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Oil prices bounced back today after Monday&#39;s strong selloff after the DOE reported the third consecutive week of crude stocks draws. Macro sentiment improved on Wednesday as traders positioned for a dovish rate hike from the Federal Reserve, seeing WTI and Brent move higher together as US equity markets opened up into the green. However, some of the gains were pared back on the release of EIA inventories, which saw a draw of 497K barrels less than the expected draw of 2.4mln; some relief was seen in the products where distillates printed a draw of 4.2mln barrels, way below the expected build of 573K barrels. In other news-flow, the Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said Saudi would cut oil production in January by 400K BPD to 10.2mln BPD and adds he is certain cuts will be extended in April. Local reports from Libya said the 300K BPD capacity Sharara oilfield had reopened following an agreement met with protestors, although a protestor spokesperson later denied this, saying production would restart after their demands were met, as well as additional newswires reporting production was yet to resume.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar is wobbling again as the clock ticks down to the Fed and the index is flirting with Fib support just under 96.700 amidst widespread Greenback losses vs G10 rivals and EM currencies. The catalyst is quite simply heightened expectation that the final Fed policy meeting of the year will be more dovish or cautious in word after a 4th hike is delivered. This could be conveyed via the accompanying statement, dot plots and/or press conference from Chair Powell, with several looking to see whether the phrase about more gradual tightening being warranted is retained. Back to the DXY, some respite may be in the offing after another housing data beat (existing on top of starts and permits yesterday) &nbsp;and assuming no further technical breakdown through 96.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has extended gains vs the Dollar and across the board after confirmation that the EU has approved Italy&rsquo;s revised 2019 budget with a 2.04% deficit target, albeit conditionally, narrowly and subject to period review. Eur/Usd appears to have overcome some psychological hurdles if not quite chart resistance to trip stops around 1.1425 and is now eyeing previous December highs and a Fib ahead of 1.1450.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/JPY/CAD/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best majors in Dollar terms, as the Kiwi maintains 0.6850+ status before the FOMC and NZ data in the form of Q3 GDP and November trade. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy has slipped to fresh multi-week lows, but not quite far enough to seriously threaten 112.00-05 expiry options (1+ bn). The Loonie and Pound shrugged off or completely ignored benign, but largely as forecast Canadian and UK inflation reports to outperform the Usd, with the former rebounding further from near 1.3500 lows and latter keeping above 1.2650 through more divisive Brexit debate at PMQs. Note, the Cad also derived a degree of support from a rebound in oil prices, albeit partly due to the soggy Buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CHF &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marginal or relative underperformers as the Aussie unit hit a brick wall around 0.7200 yet again and was undermined by more US-China wrangling at the WTO, while the Franc hovered just below 0.9900 and lost ground against the aforementioned bullish Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all benefiting to the detriment of the Usd, and especially recent laggards like the Try.</p>\r\n",

(-0.5%) were mixed as the former was supported by financial names with the four large banks in positive territory. Meanwhile, Mainland gains in real estates and utilities were offset by the decline in the energy and healthcare sectors.

Eur/Usd has subsequently revisited 1.1400+ terrain, albeit just, while Aud/Usd has had another go at 0.7200 and the Kiwi is pivoting 0.6850 even though NZ current account data for Q3 was somewhat disappointing overnight. Note, decent option expiry interest may act as a drag on Eur/Usd with 1 bn at 1.1375 and the same amount between 1.1355-60 rolling off, while there is strong chart resistance ahead of 1.1450 at 1.1442 (earlier December peak) and 1.1445 (Fib).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP - Also firmer vs the Usd, with the former just off a marginal new mtd high, but perhaps restricted to an extent by option related flow as 1.2 bn resides between 112.00-05 and 1.5 bn sits from 112.40-50, while for the Yen there is also the BoJ&rsquo;s final policy meeting of 2018 to consider just after tonight&rsquo;s FOMC.

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar remains depressed in the run-up to the FOMC in anticipation of a dovish hike if not quite one more and done as a growing number of pundits look for the accompanying statement and guidance to be tweaked via the dot plots and/or removal of further gradual tightening. The index has duly retreated from another 97.000+ test and is holding just above recent lows ahead of 96.500, with the December base so far around 96.360 and ytd peak circa 97.710-715 the obvious bearish and bullish targets depending on the tone of the Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All vying for top G10 spot and biggest gainer vs the flagging Greenback, but with the single getting an extra lift or rather relief bid on the back of Italy and EU agreement on the 2019 budget that is likely to be officially announced by Italian PM Conte shortly. Eur/Usd has subsequently revisited 1.1400+ terrain, albeit just, while Aud/Usd has had another go at 0.7200 and the Kiwi is pivoting 0.6850 even though NZ current account data for Q3 was somewhat disappointing overnight. Note, decent option expiry interest may act as a drag on Eur/Usd with 1 bn at 1.1375 and the same amount between 1.1355-60 rolling off, while there is strong chart resistance ahead of 1.1450 at 1.1442 (earlier December peak) and 1.1445 (Fib).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also firmer vs the Usd, with the former just off a marginal new mtd high, but perhaps restricted to an extent by option related flow as 1.2 bn resides between 112.00-05 and 1.5 bn sits from 112.40-50, while for the Yen there is also the BoJ&rsquo;s final policy meeting of 2018 to consider just after tonight&rsquo;s FOMC. Meanwhile, Brexit continues to put a brake on the Pound, or at least temper Sterling gains as Cable crests 1.2650 and Eur/Gbp hovers around 0.9000 with little reaction to broadly in line UK inflation data or a modest beat on CBI trends that seems to have been released early.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The marginal underperformers, with the Loonie still blighted by crude&rsquo;s slump and diplomatic strains with China, but just off new ytd lows a fraction above 1.3500 ahead of Canadian CPI data, while the Franc meanders between 0.9910-35 and around 1.1300 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Swedish Krona is on the back foot below 10.3000 vs the Eur after more soft Swedish macro releases in the form of industrial and consumer sentiment that will put another dent in the case for hawks at Thursday&rsquo;s Riksbank policy meeting.</p>\r\n",

Today&rsquo;s UK inflation data is expected to be softer overall and one of the shadow BoE MPCs is predicting an unchanged announcement from the real policy setters on Thursday in line with the overwhelming consensus, but the bid in domestic bonds and 3 month contracts appears partly corrective and Brexit-related as both sides gear up for the no deal scenario. Looking at early price action in more detail, Gilts have gradually climbed and recovered from a marginally softer open at 123.07 to 123.37 vs their previous 123.09 settlement and Short Sterling futures are 2.5 ticks ahead at best in the lead up to CPI before the CBI (also seen weaker) and then the FOMC.</p>\r\n",

Bunds are now just off a 163.25 low as Italian bonds spike more than 2 full points at best on reports that Rome and Brussels have finally settled 2019 deficit differences. In fact, the 10 year Italian debt future has blasted through its previous December 13 contract peak and broken above the next technical resistance levels to briefly eclipse the 127.44 continuation high before running out of steam. Ahead, a speech from ECB&rsquo;s Hansson and Italian PM Conte is scheduled to talk at 11.00GMT, but then the focus will turn to the Fed.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asian equities trade somewhat cautious ahead of the FOMC rate decision following the attempted rebound on Wall St. where the S&amp;P closed little above its 2018 low, while the Dow Jones was supported by gains in Goldman Sachs. ASX 200 (-0.5%) is pressured by oil names following the over-7% decline in the complex, while Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) trades with no firm direction amid a choppy JPY and undecisive risk tone. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) are mixed as the former is supported by financial names while the latter is pressured by the energy and healthcare sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are choppy in which the DXY remained sub-97.000 and eased to lows of 96.850 in the run-up to the FOMC interest rate decision, which is widely expected to result in a dovish hike. As such, EUR/USD was pushed further above of 1.1350 while GBP/USD breached 1.2650 to the upside. Meanwhile, USD/JPY fluctuates within a 40-pip range after printing fresh Dec lows at 112.19 amid the undecisive risk tone, with some also citing the downside to bearish technical indicators. Elsewhere, antipodeans are also bolstered by the softer greenback with AUD/USD re-testing resistance 0.7200 ahead of its 100DMA at 0.7219 and NZD/USD shrugged off downbeat current account data and marched further north of 0.6850. Finally, the Loonie is subdued and fails to benefit from the weaker USD as the decline in crude prices keeps USD/CAD just above 1.3450.</p>\r\n",
