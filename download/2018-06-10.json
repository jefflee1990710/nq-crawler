Apple was said to warn suppliers about a 20% decline in iPhone parts order, according to Nikkei, and now expects shipments of 80mln units for the new phones, down from the 100mln unit orders it ordered the previous year. On the earnings front, Broadcom (AVGO) earnings slightly beat expectations on EPS front, and revenues were in line, but guidance on Q3 wireless revenue was weak, which saw the stock lower by 3% and trading at the bottom of the SPX &amp; NDX. Monster Beverages (MNST) traded at the top of the SPX and supported the consumer staples sector on Friday following its AGM, where it stated its US business is showing strong momentum and said there is room to increase prices later this year to offset the higher aluminium costs following tariffs. JP Morgan&rsquo;s (JPM), Amazon&rsquo;s (AMZN) and Berkshire&rsquo;s (BRK.A) candidate to lead their joint healthcare venture stated he would not lead the entity as he is focused on his current CEO position at Geisinger Health System. M&amp;A flow was very light today, however during hours CNBC reported Dialog Semiconductor (DLE GY) is in talks for touch screen maker Synaptics (SYNA), but the initial offer of USD 59/shr was rejected. Elsewhere, CNBC&rsquo;s Faber reported that Comcast&rsquo;s (CMCSA) bid for 21st Century Fox (FOXA) is coming on June 13th. Elsewhere, NY Post reported that the legal battle for CBS (CBS) &amp; National Amusements has been set for October 3rd. SPX +0.31%, NDX 0.00%, DJI +0.30%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were pretty much unchanged on Friday as investors have been cautiously awaiting for a G7 outcome and ahead of FOMC and ECB next week. Most of the action was concentrated in the front end of the curve though yields were lower by less than c.1bps. Spreads were mixed, 2s10s were wider by c.1bps at settlement. US 10YR T-notes futures (Sep 2018) were unchanged at 119-19.</p>\r\n",
