Several consumer staples outperformed today such as Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Coty (COTY) and Kimberley-Clark (KMB).

General Electric (GE) was a bottom mover on the back of JPMorgan lowering its price target, citing dismal earnings. A drop in copper prices lead to a fall in the miner Freeport-McMoRan (FXC).
