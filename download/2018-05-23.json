The minutes also stated there was a range of views on how many rate hikes are required and that few noted the FFR could reach neutral level before too long if rate hikes continued. Furthermore, it was suggested that a modest overshoot of inflation could be helpful and several members said it was important to monitor the yield curve slope. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reaction across US asset classes was initially modest as the comments didn&rsquo;t shed too much light on how many further rate hikes there will be in 2018, with a range of views evident. However, USD was gradually sold after the release, Treasuries caught a bid, and equity futures climbed as sentiment reflected that the minutes contained little that changes the current &lsquo;gradual hikes&rsquo; script. The result was that money markets&rsquo; pricing of the Fed&rsquo;s rate hike trajectory also eased slightly; while the probability of a June hike still remains in the 90s and the probability of two additional hikes this year slipped to under 90%, while the probability of four hikes declined by around 10ppts to about 41%.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump stated that the Chinese trade talks are moving along nicely, but in the end, we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion.

Elsewhere, US Secretary of State Pompeo is said to be seeking a meeting with allies including Europe in early or mid-June to resolve nuclear deal issues.

(Newswires/WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said Mexico and Canada have been very difficult in NAFTA negotiations. In related news, Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland stated that NAFTA engagement continues at a very intense level and that significant progress was made on autos, while Mexico NAFTA negotiator said a skinny NAFTA deal is not an option and that they are not interested in a partial agreement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Mester (Voter, Hawkish) said the difference between two or three additional rate hikes in 2018 is &lsquo;marginal&rsquo; for the economy and added that if inflation does not pick up as expected, it would be an argument to be more cautious.

At the cash open, however, there was a convergence with cash indices (ES rallied slightly, while SPX sold off), and ES was trading horizontally around 2710-2715. In wake of the FOMC meeting minutes, however, the Emini rallied towards the familiar 2730 area, with the minutes revealing little by way of new information, and was consistent with gradual hikes. US futures were also resilient to the geopolitical headlines littered throughout the session Sectors were mixed on Wednesday, telecom and metals lagged whilst utilities held well into positive territory. The financial sector was the bottom performing, despite Congress approving a bill to dismantle parts of the Dodd-Frank banking rules, and were perhaps trading off the theme of lower yields and flatter curves. In equity specific stories, General Electric (GE) suffered losses after the CEO declined to say whether the co.&#39;s dividend is safe in 2019, specifying it depends on cash flow, operating profit and portfolio moves and amid its plan to divest its insurance unit. Nordstrom (JWN) also printed gains amid an upgrade from buy to hold at Deutsche Bank. SPX +0.32% at 2733, NDX +0.9% at 6954, DJI +0.20% at 24883.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex was bid as US traders got to their desks as risk sentiment slumped after Asia-Pac trade though picked up after the Turkish Central Bank surprisingly hiked rates. After the FOMC minutes, Treasuries rallied once again with futures hitting session highs as the Fed hiking trajectory eased slightly for 2018. The front and belly of the curve lead the moves with 5yr and 10yr yields higher by c.6bps. 5s30s and 10s3s widened by c.3bps whilst 2s5s and 2s10s narrowed by c.2bps. US auction of 5-year debt was on the screws, with the stop-out rate the highest since 2008. Internals were also fair, with cover coming in above recent averages. However, the internal takedown was below the prior and recent averages, and that left dealers with their highest takedown since December 2017. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 10 ticks higher at 118-28.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/19242/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can no do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities up, Treasuries up, DXY up, Crude mixed.</li>\r\n  <li>* REAR-VIEW: FOMC minutes reveal little new info, Turkish Central Bank emergency hike.</li>\r\n  <li>* AHEAD: ECB minutes, UK Retail sales, German GDP, BoE&#39;s Carney, ECB&#39;s Praet and heavy Fed speak.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FOMC MINUTES: Most members felt it would soon be appropriate to raise rates again if outlook remained intact, whilst a few noted that the FFR could reach neutral level before too long if rate hikes continued. Many saw little evidence of labour market overheating with wage pressures still moderate with a range of views on how many rate hikes are required. In the minutes it was highlighted that a modest overshoot of inflation could be helpful. Several also said it was important to monitor the yield curve slope. The market&rsquo;s reaction was muted at first, but in the minutes after the release, the USD was sold, Treasuries caught a bid, and equity futures climbed as the minutes contained little that changes the current &lsquo;gradual hikes&rsquo; script. The result was that money markets&rsquo; pricing of the Fed&rsquo;s rate hike trajectory also eased slightly; while the probability of a June hike still remains in the 90s, the probability of two additional hikes this year slipped to under 90%, while the probability of four hikes declined by around 10ppts to about 41%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*TURKISH CENTRAL BANK: The Turkish Central Bank finally raised the Late Liquidity Window by 300bps to 16.50%, outside of a scheduled policy meeting, and stressed it will use strong monetary tightening to support price stability. The lira strengthened after the unexpected MPC&rsquo;s decision, paring back some of the losses suffered earlier on Wednesday against the USD (the lira down as much as 5%). Though today&rsquo;s action has lifted the currency, investors remain wary in the wait for a &nbsp;more fundamental change in policy, as the central bank has previously intervened in a&nbsp; similar manner to boost the currency but the gains proved to be short-lived, Capital Economics says. Following the move, Turkey PM Yildirim said he never sees the option for capital controls, whilst Turkish President Erdogan said he will take &#39;different&#39; measures to lower inflation and the current account deficit following elections (implying non-rate moves).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* TRADE: US President Trump in a tweet expressed a positive note on Chinese talks noting they are &lsquo;moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion&rsquo;. On the China front, China&#39;s Wang Yi notes trade talks with the US have made &#39;constructive and positive progress&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*GEOPOLITICS: US Secretary of State Pompeo said the US will &quot;respectfully walk away&quot; from North Korea talks without the right agreement; adding that a bad deal is not an option. He also is said to be seeking a meeting with allies including Europe in early or mid-June to resolve nuclear deal issues. He then noted the decision on the North Korea summit is up to Kim and he is &#39;very hopeful&#39; the summit will happen. Later in&nbsp; the session, the Iranian supreme leader said in a speech the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal means Iran cannot have dealings with the US. Iran&#39;s top leader set seven conditions for European countries if they want Tehran to remain in the nuclear deal and added Europe must promise it will not seek negotiations over Iran&rsquo;s missile programme and regional activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* ITALIAN POLITICS: Italian President Mattarella gave the PM mandate to candidate Conte, after&nbsp; both the 5SM and League recommended him for the position. Sources also reported that the Italian President does not appreciate economists who are anti-Euro and anti-EU. This came in the context of the M5S-League coalition looking to appoint Paolo Savona as Finance Minister, who &nbsp;holds an anti-EU stance and thus any resistance to his appointment could be seen as a market positive. An Italian journalist also suggested that League&#39;s Giorgetti is the front-runner for the role. EU Commission also expressed concerns over Italy noting it is a source of potentially significant spill-overs to the rest of the Euro area. Later in the session, Italian press said the new Italian government may face a confidence vote in the Senate on Tuesday/Wednesday. Italy&rsquo;s PM candidate Conte will start talks with party leaders on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*DATA: US New Home Sales fell to 662k and were only revised slightly higher to 672k, below the consensus of 680k. Pantheon Economics argued that the consensus appeared a little too optimistic given the softer US Mortgage Application figures. Sales seem to have reached a peak for this cycle and are anticipated to gradually fall towards 620k in the incoming months. The Eurozone saw the release of the EZ Consumer Sentiment Index which came in at 0.2 missing expectations at 0.4 and revised at 0.3. The disappointing numbers followed weak business survey and higher oil prices which have placed pressure on real incomes, though it remains unclear why expectations were for a sentiment improvement, analysts at Pantheon noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FEDSPEAK: Fed&rsquo;s Mester (Voter, Hawkish) &ndash; who has already spoke frequently as of late &ndash; said the difference between two or three additional rate hikes in 2018 is &lsquo;marginal&rsquo; for the US economy, adding that if inflation does not pick up as expected, it is an argument to be more cautious. Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Non-voter, Dove) says Fed is paying a lot of attention to the yield curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*ECB SPEAK: ECB&rsquo;s Coeure (Neutral) said he is not concerned about the slowdown of Eurozone growth, and is increasingly confident that inflation will rise. On asset purchases, Coeure suggested that it will not end abruptly after September. ECB&rsquo;s Makuch (Neutral) also spoke about QE, and said it has done its job, and the ECB can now afford to wind down the programme. On inflation, Makuch expects to nominally meet the central bank&rsquo;s inflation target objective in 2020-2021. NOTE: The ECB&rsquo;s central projection sees HICP rising to 1.7% in 2020, just short of the &lsquo;close to but below 2%&rsquo; target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*EQUITIES: SPX +0.32% at 2733, NDX +0.9% at 6954, DJI +0.20% at 24883.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS:&nbsp;Cons Cyclicals +0.48%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.33%, Energy: -0.19%, Financials: -0.65%, Health Care: +0.20%, Industrials: -0.25%, Materials: -0.26%, Telecom: -0.69%, Tech: +0.72%, Utilities: +0.82%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overnight risk-off tone weighed on US equity futures, with the ES basing around 2705 in pre-market trade. At the cash open, however, there was a convergence with cash indices (ES rallied slightly, while SPX sold off), and ES was trading horizontally around 2710-2715. In wake of the FOMC meeting minutes, however, the Emini rallied towards the familiar 2730 area, with the minutes revealing little by way of new information, and was consistent with gradual hikes. US futures were also resilient to the geopolitical headlines littered throughout the session</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sectors were mixed on Wednesday, telecom and metals lagged whilst utilities held well into positive territory. The financial sector was the bottom performing, despite Congress approving a bill to dismantle parts of the Dodd-Frank banking rules, and were perhaps trading off the theme of lower yields and flatter curves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A busy day for earnings, which saw Lowe (LOW), Tiffany&rsquo;s (TIF) and Ralph Lauren (RL) leading the S&amp;P after releasing strong numbers and lifting retailer names as a result. Tiffany&rsquo;s was boosted by more than 20% also following its USD 10bln repurchase programme announcement. On the flip-side, HP (HPE) and Target (TGT) were at the bottom of the index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In equity specific stories, General Electric (GE) suffered losses after the CEO declined to say whether the co.&#39;s dividend is safe in 2019, specifying it depends on cash flow, operating profit and portfolio moves and amid its plan to divest its insurance unit. Nordstrom (JWN) also printed gains amid an upgrade from buy to hold at Deutsche Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In M&amp;A news, Comcast (CMCSA) confirmed to be considering an all-cash offer for 21st Century Fox (FOXA) that outbids Disney&rsquo;s (DIS) USD 52bln offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*CRUDE: WTI futures settle 36 cents lower at USD 71.84/bbl, Brent futures settle 23 cents higher at USD 79.80/bbl. WTI has continued to slide following yesterday&#39;s sources story suggesting that OPEC was considering relaxing its supply curbs in order to plug holes left by Venezuela and Iranian production; weekly energy inventory data did little to stop the slide, after a surprise build. Brent, however, was more resilient, with geopolitical tensions continuing to linger, and drifted to session highs in US afternoon trade, while WTI was more sluggish moving higher. There were further &#39;sources&#39; reports on Wednesday, with one wire reporting that OPEC/non-OPEC producers will discuss potential changes to way in which they assess oil stockpiles, according to sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* In Nigeria, Shell said exports at the Forcados terminal were normal despite pipeline shutdown, confirmed by other reports later in the session, which said Trans Forcados pipeline was ramping up after the week-long outage. Shell also added that the force majeure on Bonny Light exports, however, remains in place. In Iraq, SOMO exported 3.34mln BPD from Southern Iraq in April (in March, exports were said to not exceed 3.426mln BPD). It appears protesting is making its mark in Libya again, and the 5k BPD Raguba oil field was shut down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* WEEKLY CRUDE INVENTORIES: US weekly inventories showed a surprise build crude stocks (+5.778mln vs exp -1.567mln vs API -1.3mln); Cushing drew down by 1.123mln (API showed a draw of 822k); distillates drew down 951k (vs exp -1.335mln vs API -1.3mln); gasoline stocks showed a build of 1.883mln (vs exp -1.388mln vs API +980k). Crude production continued to tick-up, albeit slightly, rising in the week by 0.02% to 10.725mln BPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*TREASURIES: US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 10 ticks higher at 118-28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex was bid as US traders got to their desks as risk sentiment slumped after Asia-Pac trade though picked up after the Turkish Central Bank surprisingly hiked rates. After the FOMC minutes, Treasuries rallied once again with futures hitting session highs as the Fed hiking trajectory eased slightly for 2018. The front and belly of the curve lead the moves with 5yr and 10yr yields higher by c.6bps. 5s30s and 10s3s widened by c.3bps whilst 2s5s and 2s10s narrowed by c.2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US auction of 5-year debt was on the screws, with the stop-out rate the highest since 2008. Internals were also fair, with cover coming in above recent averages. However, the internal takedown was below the prior and recent averages, and that left dealers with their highest takedown since December 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FOREX: USD, EUR: EUR trades lower after another batch of soft data suggests that the Q1 slowdown might not have been so temporary, as well as continuing worries emanating from Italy, and that allowed the USD to build on recent gains, to the detriment of EMFX, which was on course for another thrashing (TRY particularly). Heading into the FOMC meeting minutes, the EURUSD was at session lows, however, did catch a bid as traders saw nothing particularly new in the meeting minutes, and they were consistent with &lsquo;gradual hikes&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY, CHF, XAU: Haven FX maintained its bid from overnight risk-off trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP: Sterling was pushed towards the 1.3300 the figure as inflation declined to a 13-month low; however, analysts noted that although price pressures weakened, the data was in line with BOE projections, and as such, might not derail the bank from lifting rates in the months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD: The antipodeans were rangey through US trade, but were boosted as risk appetite returned in wake of the Fed minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMFX: Turkey&rsquo;s economy minister said that the Turkish Central Bank was able to use monetary policy to deal with the weakening Lira, dismissing concerns about Presidential intervention, and that helped the EMFX complex recover, though TRY&rsquo;s recovery was more sluggish; it wasn&rsquo;t until officials said the central bank was meeting that the Lira got a boost, and after the emergency rate rise, TRY strengthened; and after President Erdogan&rsquo;s suggestion that he will take different measures to lower inflation and current account deficit after the election (other than lower rates), there was further upside for the TRY. Other EMFX was also stronger against the USD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*COMING UP: To recap the April meeting, the Bank left their opening statement unchanged in what was a meeting ultimately void of fireworks with Draghi intent on fending off most questions by journalists by stating that the Bank did not discuss FX volatility, their June roadmap, monetary policy &lsquo;per se&rsquo; or rising yields.

Brent, however, was more resilient, with geopolitical tensions continuing to linger, and drifted to session highs in US afternoon trade, while WTI was more sluggish moving higher. There were further &#39;sources&#39; reports on Wednesday, with one wire reporting that OPEC/non-OPEC producers will discuss potential changes to way in which they assess oil stockpiles, according to sources.</li>\r\n  <li>* In Nigeria, Shell said exports at the Forcados terminal were normal despite pipeline shutdown, confirmed by other reports later in the session, which said Trans Forcados pipeline was ramping up after the week-long outage. Shell also added that the force majeure on Bonny Light exports, however, remains in place. In Iraq, SOMO exported 3.34mln BPD from Southern Iraq in April (in March, exports were said to not exceed 3.426mln BPD). It appears protesting is making its mark in Libya again, and the 5k BPD Raguba oil field was shut down.</li>\r\n  <li>* WEEKLY CRUDE INVENTORIES: US weekly inventories showed a surprise build crude stocks (+5.778mln vs exp -1.567mln vs API -1.3mln); Cushing drew down by 1.123mln (API showed a draw of 822k); distillates drew down 951k (vs exp -1.335mln vs API -1.3mln); gasoline stocks showed a build of 1.883mln (vs exp -1.388mln vs API +980k).

        "content": "<p><strong>WEEKLY SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury increased the auction sizes at the most recent refunding announcement and will auction a total of USD 115bln in 2-year notes (USD 33bln, Tuesday), 5-year notes (USD 36bln, Wednesday) and 7-year notes (USD 30bln, Thursday), as well as 2y FRNs (USD 16bln, Wednesday) this week. With a total of USD 70.6bln maturing, the auction will raise net USD 44.4bln in the week, according to TD Securities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5-YEAR AUCTION: </strong>Recent auctions in the 5-year sector have been very close to the 1pm WI levels, leading some to expect another good showing on Wednesday; last month&rsquo;s auction saw the highest stop-out rate at a 5-year auction since 2008, though cover was soft, and foreigners&rsquo; participation was the smallest since September. The latest positioning data indicates that dealers have trimmed their holdings in the 3-6 year bucket, according to Societe Generale, to USD 12.3bln, lowest since April. &ldquo;The current 5-year note is trading fair on both Treasury spline versus old 5s and on the curve relative to the 2s and 10s,&rdquo; SocGen writes. The bank holds a slightly positive bias provided some outright and curve concession is seen before the auction deadline. SocGen notes, however, that the higher auction amount is a negative, but the cheap outright levels (with the 5-year yield is currently trading above all the 5y auction stops since September 2008) and that should support the auction takedown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RECENT AUCTION HISTORY (via TD Securities):&nbsp;</strong><br />Stop-out rate: (Prev. 2.7837% vs 6-auction average of 2.475%)<br />Tail: (Prev 0.0bps vs 6-auction average of 0.4bps)<br />Bid-to-cover: (Prev. 2.49x vs 6-auction average of 2.46x)<br />Dealers: (Prev. 26.2% vs 6-auction average of 27.7%)<br />Directs: (Prev. 13.7% vs 6-auction average of 10.5%)<br />Indirects: (Prev. 60.2% vs 6-auction average of 61.8%)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>FX markets saw a particularly turbulent session as risk-aversion gripped sentiment across the complex. Sentiment was initially downbeat at the beginning of the EU session with traders fearful of comments from US President Trump who warned over the possibility of a breakdown in prospective talks between the US and NK with the Commander-In-Chief also dour on Chinese trade talks, stating that he is not happy with how talks have been progressing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequently, the Asia-Pac session saw a FTQ with JPY catching a safe-haven bid and knocking USD/JPY below 111.00 with the move accelerating during European trade after the paid took out the 200DMA around 110.21 and then further support at 110.00 and a key fib level at 109.78 (before eventually reclaiming both levels in the latter half of the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the JPY vastly out-muscling the USD, this was not enough to keep the DXY down with the index firmly in positive territory around the 94.00 level for a bulk of the session as the greenback benefited from a softer EUR and GBP. Starting off with the shared currency, the EUR was dealt a blow early-doors amid a slew of soft-PMI figures from the region which saw the EZ composite figure print an 18-month low at 54.1. This has lead some in the market to speculate what this could mean for the ECB at their upcoming June meeting with ING suggesting that data, allied with inflation prospects and Italian politics clearly suggests that &lsquo;doing nothing at the June meeting is the best and most risk-free option for the ECB&rsquo;. Going back to the UK, GBP/USD was also hit hard by the firmer USD and domestic data with Y/Y CPI printing at 2.4% below Exp. 2.5% (BoE Exp. 2.4%). That said, traders will most likely wait for this week&rsquo;s retail sales and secondary reading of UK GDP to get a more rounded view for prospects of a 2018 rate hike by the BoE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, TRY experienced a flash crash overnight which saw the currency drop over 2.5% against the greenback with the move extended ever-closer to the 5.00 level as inaction by the central bank continues to concern markets ahead of next month&rsquo;s election, in which President Erdogan has vowed to take greater control of the central bank if he wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>commodity-linked currencies were also subdued as oil prices retreated from multi-year highs with AUD also dampened after weak construction data, while NZD saw pressure after the RBNZ published an article on unconventional monetary policy in which it stated it has significant room for easing in a conventional manner with the OCR at 1.75%. The losses in NZD were then instantly pared given the context of the comments which were made as an implicit argument against adopting unconventional measures, before the broad risk averse sentiment pressured currencies across the FX space and saw NZD/USD test 0.6900 to the downside.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) was led lower by the energy sector following weakness in crude as Santos shares slumped about 9% after the Co. rejected the approach from Harbour Energy and disengaged from further talks. Nikkei 225 (-1.2%) underperformed as exporters suffered the brunt of a firmer currency, while Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%) and Hang Seng (-1.8%) conformed to the broad risk averse tone amid Trump discontentment with trade discussions. Furthermore, the PBoC conducted a net daily liquidity drain from the interbank market, while basic materials names were pressured by NDRC plans to reduce benchmark coal prices and after US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin clarified that steel and aluminium tariffs were not part of the recent truce and will remain in place for China. Conversely, baby related stocks gained in Hong Kong as participants reacted took their first opportunity to react to the prospects of China relaxing its child policy restrictions and Standard Chartered was boosted on reports Barclays was examining a potential merger with rivals including the dual-listed lender. Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid gains in T-notes and a broad risk-averse tone, while the BoJ were also present in the market for JPY 840bln of JGBs in maturities spread across the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day and CNY 70bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily drain of CNY 30bln.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian President Mattarella has not yet decided whether to give the PM role to Conte according to sources. Furthermore, Italian President Mattarella is to take time on the Premier candidate. (Newswires/Repubblica)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said the House Ways and Means Committee are working on additional tax cuts by November and that he will propose new tax cuts before that month. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House passed the Dodd-Frank rollback bill which was then sent to President Trump to sign, while the US House also passed the &quot;right to try&quot; bill which seeks to permit terminally ill patients to try experimental drugs still in clinical trial stage. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea Leader Kim is said to be worried about a military coup for when he is in Singapore for summit with US President Trump. In other news, North Korea have accepted the list of South Korean reporters to visit its nuclear test site during dismantling. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House &quot;peace team&quot; has completed draft of administration Middle East peace plan, although White House wants to postpone its unveiling until time and conditions are right. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are firmly in the red as the downbeat sentiment rolled over from Asia overnight and Wall St. yesterday. Markets took a risk averse stance after US President Trump expressed doubt over the US-North Korean summit before further expressing dissatisfaction in regards to trade talks with China. European sectors are almost all in the red, with consumer staples outperforming while energy plumb the depths amid the retreat in oil prices overnight. In terms of stock specifics, Marks &amp; Spencer (+3.5%) is higher (despite reporting a second straight decline in annual profits) amid faster than expected store closures. Finally, Standard Chartered (+1.6%) is in the green following an FT report that Barclays (-0.8%) was looking at a potential merger with rival banks, however source reports denied this news later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The JPY has been a beneficiary of the broad risk aversion which subsequently took USD/JPY below 111.00 during Asia-Pacific trade, thereafter the pair continued to fall victim to selling pressure and took out the widely-watched 200DMA at 110.21 and psychological 110.00 (which holds USD 2bln in option expiries due to roll-off at the NY cut) before eventually taking out Fib support at 109.78.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The potential damage for the USD from the JPY has been somewhat offset by the softer EUR (DXY +0.25%) with the shared currency dealt a blow by this morning&rsquo;s PMI releases which thus far have painted a dreary picture for the Eurozone. IFR highlight that if we get a break of the 1.1700 level to the downside, large stops and gamma below this level could see 1.1500 on the cards. The EUR initially also lost ground to the GBP with the EUR/GBP cross around 0.8750 before the cross was dealt some reprieve by softer than expected UK inflation figures (Y/Y CPI 2.4% vs. Exp. 2.5%) which saw GBP/USD briefly slip below 1.3350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies have been subdued as oil prices retreated from multi-year highs with AUD also dampened after weak construction data, while NZD has seen a bout of pressure after the RBNZ published an article on unconventional monetary policy in which it stated it has significant room for easing in a conventional manner with the OCR at 1.75%. The losses in NZD were then instantly pared given the context of the comments which were made as an implicit argument against adopting unconventional measures, before the broad risk averse sentiment pressured currencies across the FX space and saw NZD/USD test 0.6900 to the downside. Elsewhere, TRY experienced a flash crash which saw the currency drop over 2.5% against the greenback and extend on its recent trend of record lows approaching into next month&rsquo;s election, in which President Erdogan has vowed to take greater control of the central bank if he wins, although the currency has since pared some of the losses amid a lack of immediate fresh news catalyst behind the latest bout of selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In-fitting with the broader risk-tone fixed income markets have been provided firm support by the aforementioned Trump concerns regarding trade prospects with China and the feasibility of a US-NK summit. Bunds subsequently took out the psychological 159.50 level to the upside before subsequently tripping stops through the 159.69 level which marked the March 28th. The move was very much exacerbated by the soft EZ data before prices eventually ran out of steam ahead of the 160.00 handle. This morning&rsquo;s woeful Schatz auction from Germany which drew a b/c of just 1.0 did little to derail prices in what has been an inconsistent few weeks of auction performance at the Buba. Elsewhere in the Eurozone, BTPs have once again failed to join the party with leveraged accounts said to be behind a bulk of the selling pressure. In terms of the latest state of play, despite 5SM and League&rsquo;s best efforts to appoint Conte as PM, President Mattarella still needs time to make a decision with yesterday&rsquo;s reports that anti-EU Savona could be appointed as Economy Minister not doing much to bolster confidence for Italy. In the UK, Gilts jumped back above 122.00 to the upside in the wake of the latest batch of inflation figures which fell short of expectations (Y/Y CPI 2.4% vs. Exp. 2.5%) in what is a busy week for UK data, albeit the move was largely short-lived with market expectations for a BoE hike little changed by the release. USTs also trade higher, in-line with their major counterparts as the US 10yr remains on a 3-handle around 3.02% with the next targets (should we continue to move in the current direction) seen at 3.0% and 2.96%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil has extended the losses seen over night in the current risk averse environment, with downward pressure seen from both a rising USD and overnight source reports suggesting OPEC could increase production in June to offset Venezuelan and Iranian shortages. Prices were also dealt a blow by the latest API reports which posted a narrower than expected drawdown in headline crude inventories (-1.3mln vs. Exp. -1.6mln). Elsewhere, gold is trading range-bound with participants tentative ahead of today&rsquo;s FOMC minutes release, while copper was lacklustre overnight alongside the downbeat risk sentiment. Steel has fallen for the fourth consecutive session hitting one month lows as supply glut concerns continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC and non-OPEC producers are to discuss potential changes to way in which they assess oil stockpiles, according to sources.

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: TRY at record lows, GBP at 2018 lows amid CPI below forecast, CHF at month highs in risk averse markets",
        "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are firmly in the red as the downbeat sentiment rolled over from Asia overnight and Wall St. yesterday. Markets took a risk averse stance after US President Trump expressed doubt over the US-North Korean summit before further expressing dissatisfaction in regards to trade talks with China. European sectors are almost all in the red, with consumer staples outperforming while energy plumb the depths amid the retreat in oil prices overnight. In terms of stock specifics, Marks &amp; Spencer (+3.4%) is higher (despite reporting a second straight decline in annual profits) amid faster than expected store closures. Finally, Standard Chartered (+1.6%) is in the green following an FT report that Barclays (-0.6%) was looking at a potential merger with rival banks, however source reports denied this news later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For once the USD has taken somewhat of a backseat in early European trade with a bulk of the action taking place elsewhere, most notably in the JPY which has been a beneficiary of the broad risk aversion. Sentiment has been soured by US President Trump placing doubts on the summit with North Korea and expressed dissatisfaction regarding trade talks with China. Subsequently, this took USD/JPY below 110.00 during Asia-Pacific trade with losses now accelerating the pair towards 110.00 after taking out the widely-watched 200DMA at 110.21 with the psychological 110.00 level the next target for traders, which holds USD 2bln in option expiries due to roll-off at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The potential damage for the USD from the JPY has been somewhat offset by the softer EUR (DXY +0.1%) with the shared currency dealt a blow by this morning&rsquo;s PMI releases which thus far have painted a dreary picture for the Eurozone. IFR highlight that if we get a break of the 1.1700 level to the downside, large stops and gamma below this level could see 1.1500 on the cards. The EUR initially also lost ground to the GBP with the EUR/GBP cross around 0.8750 before the cross was dealt some reprieve by softer than expected UK inflation figures (Y/Y CPI 2.4% vs. Exp. 2.5%) which saw GBP/USD briefly slip below 1.3350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies have been subdued as oil prices retreated from multi-year highs with AUD also dampened after weak construction data, while NZD has seen a bout of pressure after the RBNZ published an article on unconventional monetary policy in which it stated it has significant room for easing in a conventional manner with the OCR at 1.75%. The losses in NZD were then instantly pared given the context of the comments which were made as an implicit argument against adopting unconventional measures, before the broad risk averse sentiment pressured currencies across the FX space and saw NZD/USD test 0.6900 to the downside. Elsewhere, TRY experienced a flash crash which saw the currency drop over 2.5% against the greenback and extend on its recent trend of record lows approaching into next month&rsquo;s election, in which President Erdogan has vowed to take greater control of the central bank if he wins, although the currency has since pared some of the losses amid a lack of immediate fresh news catalyst behind the latest bout of selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In-fitting with the broader risk-tone fixed income markets have been provided firm support by the aforementioned Trump concerns regarding trade prospects with China and the feasibility of a US-NK summit. Bunds subsequently took out the psychological 159.50 level to the upside before subsequently tripping stops through the 159.69 level which marked the March 28th. The move was very much exacerbated by the soft EZ data before prices eventually ran out of steam ahead of the 160.00 handle; next focus for German paper is the Schatz auction at 1030BST. Elsewhere in the Eurozone, BTPs have once again failed to join the party with leveraged accounts said to be behind a bulk of the selling pressure. In terms of the latest state of play, despite 5SM and League&rsquo;s best efforts to appoint Conte as PM, President Mattarella still needs time to make a decision with yesterday&rsquo;s reports that anti-EU Savona could be appointed as Economy Minister not doing much to bolster confidence for Italy. In the UK, Gilts jumped back above 122.00 to the upside in the wake of the latest batch of inflation figures which fell short of expectations (Y/Y CPI 2.4% vs. Exp. 2.5%) in what is a busy week for UK data, albeit the move was largely short-lived with market expectations for a BoE hike little changed by the release. USTs also trade higher, in-line with their major counterparts as the US 10yr remains on a 3-handle around 3.02% with the next targets (should we continue to move in the current direction) seen at 3.0% and 2.96%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil has extended the losses seen over night in the current risk averse environment, with downward pressure seen from both a rising USD and overnight source reports suggesting OPEC could increase production in June to offset Venezuelan and Iranian shortages. Prices were also dealt a blow by the latest API reports which posted a narrower than expected drawdown in headline crude inventories (-1.3mln vs. Exp. -1.6mln). Elsewhere, gold is trading range-bound with participants tentative ahead of today&rsquo;s FOMC minutes release, while copper was lacklustre overnight alongside the downbeat risk sentiment. Steel has fallen for the fourth consecutive session hitting one month lows as supply glut concerns continue.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>For once the USD has taken somewhat of a backseat in early European trade with a bulk of the action taking place elsewhere, most notably in the JPY which has been a beneficiary of the broad risk aversion. Sentiment has been soured by US President Trump placing doubts on the summit with North Korea and expressed dissatisfaction regarding trade talks with China. Subsequently, this took USD/JPY below 110.00 during Asia-Pacific trade with losses now accelerating the pair towards 110.00 after taking out the widely-watched 200DMA at 110.21 with the psychological 110.00 level the next target for traders which holds USD 2bln in option expiries due to roll-off at the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The potential damage for the USD from the JPY has been somewhat offset by the softer EUR (DXY +0.1%) with the shared currency dealt a blow by this morning&rsquo;s PMI releases which thus far have painted a dreary picture for the Eurozone with German metrics showing a miss across the board ahead of the EZ-wide figure. IFR highlight that if we get a break of the 1.1700 level to the downside, large stops and gamma below this level could see 1.1500 on the cards. The EUR is also losing some ground to the GBP (which itself has also fallen victim to the USD) with the EUR/GBP cross hovering around the 0.8750 level ahead of UK inflation figures which look for Y/Y&nbsp; CPI to remain at 2.5% in what is a key week for UK data points with retail sales due tomorrow and UK GDP (2nd reading on Friday) with markets likely to be particularly sensitive to domestic data given the &lsquo;lack of clarity&rsquo; in guidance from the BoE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies have been subdued as oil prices retreated from multi-year highs with AUD also dampened after weak Construction data, while NZD has seen a bout of pressure after the RBNZ published an article on unconventional monetary policy in which it stated it has significant room for easing in a conventional manner with the OCR at 1.75%. The losses in NZD were then instantly pared given the context of the comments which were made as an implicit argument against adopting unconventional measures, before the broad risk averse sentiment pressured currencies across the FX space and saw NZD/USD test 0.6900 to the downside. Elsewhere, TRY experienced a flash crash which saw the currency drop over 2.5% against the greenback and extend on its recent trend of record lows approaching into next month&rsquo;s election, in which President Erdogan has vowed to take greater control of the central bank if he wins, although the currency has since pared some of the losses amid a lack of immediate fresh news catalyst behind the latest bout of selling.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) was led lower by the energy sector following weakness in crude as Santos shares slumped about 9% after the Co. rejected the approach from Harbour Energy and disengaged from further talks. Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) underperformed as exporters suffered the brunt of a firmer currency, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) and Hang Seng (-1.0%) conformed to the broad risk averse tone amid Trump discontentment with trade discussions. Furthermore, the PBoC conducted a net daily liquidity drain from the interbank market, while basic materials names were pressured by NDRC plans to reduce benchmark coal prices and after US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin clarified that steel and aluminium tariffs were not part of the recent truce and will remain in place for China. Conversely, baby related stocks gained in Hong Kong as participants reacted took their first opportunity to react to the prospects of China relaxing its child policy restrictions and Standard Chartered was boosted on reports Barclays was examining a potential merger with rivals including the dual-listed lender. Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid gains in T-notes and a broad risk-averse tone, while the BoJ were also present in the market for JPY 840bln of JGBs in maturities spread across the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he is not happy with how talks went with China and that talks were a start, but he is not satisfied. US President Trump also stated there is no deal with China on ZTE and that he would like to see a large fine for the Co. which could be USD 1.3bln as well as a new board and management, while he also envisions ZTE being required to purchase large portion of their components from US companies. Elsewhere, US Commerce Secretary Ross plans to visit China in early June for trade talks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day and CNY 70bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily drain of CNY 30bln.

(Newswires) The Telegraph report that UK Environment Secretary Gove has accused Hammond of being &quot;short-sighted&quot; over Brexit and helping to inflict a &quot;damaging blow&quot; to the Conservative Party&#39;s &quot;environmental credentials&quot;. (Telegraph) UK Foreign Minister Johnson has continued to increase pressure on the government by stating that UK PM May must &lsquo;get on with&rsquo; removing the UK from the EU. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian President Mattarella has not yet decided whether to give the PM role to Conte according to sources, while there were also reports that Italy 5SM leader Di Maio may be back in the running for the role of PM. Furthermore, League leader Salvini said Conte remains their PM candidate and would like Paolo Savona as Economy Minister. (Newswires/Repubblica)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump Administration is said to consider a 10% cut in European steel and aluminium exports to the US. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY was the most active as the negative risk tone spurred flows into the safe-haven, which pushed USD/JPY firmly below the 111.00 handle and resulted to similar underperformance in related-crosses. Commodity-linked currencies were subdued as oil prices retreated from multi-year highs with AUD also dampened after weak Construction data, while NZD saw a bout of pressure after the RBNZ published an article on unconventional monetary policy in which it stated it has significant room for easing in a conventional manner with the OCR at 1.75%. The losses in NZD were then instantly pared given the context of the comments which were made as an implicit argument against adopting unconventional measures, before the broad risk averse sentiment pressured currencies across the FX space and saw NZD/USD test 0.6900 to the downside. Elsewhere, TRY experienced a flash crash which saw the currency drop over 2.5% against the greenback and extend on its recent trend of record lows approaching into next month&rsquo;s election, in which President Erdogan has vowed to take greater control of the central bank if he wins, although the currency has since pared some of the losses amid a lack of immediate fresh news catalyst behind the latest bout of selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Construction Work Done (Q1) 0.2% vs. Exp. 1.3% (Prev. -19.4%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBNZ published an article on unconventional monetary policy post-GFC, in which it stated that it has significant room for easing in a conventional manner as the OCR is at 1.75%, while RBNZ also noted that New Zealand monetary policy is stimulatory and that it is not projecting a significant decline in OCR. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were lacklustre overnight amid a broad risk averse tone, with WTI crude futures slipping back below the USD 72/bbl after source reports suggested June could be a live month for OPEC in which it could increase production to offset shortages from Venezuela and Iran, while the latest API reports also showed a narrower than expected drawdown in headline crude inventories. Elsewhere, gold traded range-bound with participants tentative ahead of today&rsquo;s FOMC minutes release, while copper was also lacklustre alongside the downbeat risk sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly Crude Stocks (18 May): -1.3mln (Exp. -1.600mln, Prev. +4.854mln). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC may decide to raise oil output in June due to concerns over Venezuela production decline and Iran oil shortages, according to OPEC and oil industry sources. (Newswires) Saudi, Russian and UAE oil ministers will discuss a controlled relaxation of the over-compliance seen with the OPEC+ production deal. Furthermore, reports added that the 3 ministers are due to meet in St. Petersburg this week and an early, full unwinding of OPEC cuts is not under consideration. (Argus)<br /><br />Russia&#39;s Energy Ministry said it does not rule out a global oil production cut deal will be stretched to 2019. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he thinks North Korea leader Kim is serious about denuclearisation and that we are moving along on the summit. However, he also added that there is a substantial possibility that the summit with North Korea&#39;s Kim will not work out in June and that he is disappointed by the change in attitude of North Korea&#39;s Kim. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korean President Moon stated there is no doubt North Korea will hold a summit with the US, according to a South Korean government spokesperson. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea Leader Kim is said to be worried about a military coup for when he is in Singapore for summit with US President Trump. In other news, North Korea have accepted the list of South Korean reporters to visit its nuclear test site during dismantling. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump&rsquo;s administration is seeking to shutter &#39;every&#39; Iran nuclear enrichment site, according to US officials. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House &quot;peace team&quot; has completed draft of administration Middle East peace plan, although White House wants to postpone its unveiling until time and conditions are right. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were marginally lower at settlement, as the yield curve saw some very modest steepening, with yields higher by less than 1bps across the curve. In European trade, bunds were driving the fixed income complex as safe haven flows gyrated in response to Italian political headlines. In the US, although Treasury volume was okay, Treasuries traded in a c.7 tick range ahead of the FOMC minutes tomorrow. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 1 tick higher at 118-28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said the House Ways and Means Committee are working on additional tax cuts by November and that he will propose new tax cuts before that month. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House passed the Dodd-Frank rollback bill which was then sent to President Trump to sign, while the US House also passed the &quot;right to try&quot; bill which seeks to permit terminally ill patients to try experimental drugs still in clinical trial stage.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly negative as the downbeat sentiment rolls over from US where stocks retreated and DJIA pulled back from the 25k level, after US President Trump placed doubts on the summit with North Korea and was said to be unsatisfied regarding trade talks with China. ASX 200 (-0.2%) is led lower by the energy sector following weakness in crude and with Santos shares slumping over 9% after the Co. rejected the approach from Harbour Energy and disengaged from further talks. Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) is the underperformer as exporters suffer the brunt of a firmer currency, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) and Hang Seng (-0.9%) conform to the broad risk averse tone amid Trump discontentment with trade discussions. Furthermore, the PBoC conducted a net daily liquidity drain from the interbank market, while basic materials names are pressured amid NDRC plans to reduce benchmark coal prices and after US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin clarified that steel and aluminium tariffs were not part of prior discussions and will remain in place for China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, JPY is the biggest mover as the negative risk tone spurs flows into the safe-haven, which pushed USD/JPY firmly below the 111.00 handle and resulted to similar underperformance in related-crosses. Commodity-linked currencies are also subdued as oil prices retreat from multi-year highs with AUD also dampened after weak Construction data, while NZD saw a bout of pressure after the RBNZ published an article on unconventional monetary policy in which it stated it has significant room for easing in a conventional manner with the OCR at 1.75%. However, the losses in NZD were then instantly pared given the context of the comments which were made as an implicit argument against adopting unconventional measures, while the RBNZ also noted it is not projecting a significant decrease in the OCR. Elsewhere, TRY is heavily pressured following a flash crash which saw the currency drop over 2.5% against the greenback, although has since pared some of the losses amid a lack news catalyst behind the sell-off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid gains in T-notes and a broad risk-averse tone, while the BoJ are also present in the market for JPY 840bln of JGBs in maturities spread across the curve.</p>\r\n",
