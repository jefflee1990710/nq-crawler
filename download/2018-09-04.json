(Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany Chancellor Merkel said the aim is to reach an agreement with the UK on Brexit but added that the UK cannot enjoy the same rights as EU members post-Brexit. In addition, Merkel stated she will use all of her force and creativity to make sure a deal happens and that she does not want discussions with the UK to break down, while she also commented we cannot fully rule out a breakdown of Brexit talks as we still have no result. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU could adjust Irish border backstop to win UK&#39;s approval in Brexit negotiations according to a press report citing a leading EU lawmaker. However, there were also reports from the same news agency that the German government is preparing for all possible Brexit outcomes, regulated or unregulated and urged EU and member states to prepare for a failure in Brexit negotiations. (Stuttgarter Zeitung)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Governor Carney said if economy stays on path we will need more rate hikes and that expectations in markets and businesses is for a Brexit deal. Carney also said he recognises the need to help with Brexit change and is willing to do whatever he can to promote a smooth Brexit, while he added that an announcement will be made on his future in due course and there were also separate reports that Carney is expected to extend his term until 2020 after support from PM May regarding plans to keep BoE stable amid Brexit. (Newswires/FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&rsquo;s Haldane said there is a one in four chance of a no deal Brexit, while he added it is not automatic that the shock to prices following a no deal Brexit would be a one-off and will depend on damage to supply capacity of the UK. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Tenreyro said her central forecast is for UK demand to grow by 1.75% on average over the next three years, while she added that trade tensions have increased and the direction of policy move after a no-deal Brexit is not clear. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NHC said Tropical Storm Gordon strengthened a little as it approached the north-central Gulf Coast while it added further strengthening is a possibility and could turn into a hurricane before reaching landfall this evening, although NHC had earlier commented that rapid weakening is forecast after Gordon moves inland.

Chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM) were top gainers after brokerages lifted their price targets. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) outperformed amid a price target hike at Nomura. PC&amp;G (PCG) posted gains of around 4% following an upgrade at BofA and after the California&rsquo;s legislature passed a bill that could help the co. avoid liabilities related to wildfires damages. Nordstrom (JWN) was up more than 3% after Goldman Sachs rated the stock &lsquo;buy&rsquo;. On the flip side, Nike (NKE) was down more than 3% after a negative backlash to its decision to feature Colin Kaepernick (who protested during the national anthem back in 2016) for its 30th anniversary &lsquo;Just Do It&rsquo; campaign. Facebook (FB) also posted losses after MoffetNathanson downgraded it to &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; from &lsquo;buy&rsquo; citing a negative revenue growth view, and similarly, Verizon (VZ) was down more than 2% following a downgrade at Barclays. Finally, JD.com CEO is under investigation due to sexual misconduct, weighing on shares. Meanwhile, there was much fanfare after Amazon (AMZN) crossed the USD 1trln in market cap mark. SPX -0.16% at 2896, NDX -0.42% at 7622, DJI -0.04% at 25953.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Tuesday, as traders returned from the holiday weekend, with 2s30s up by around 2bps at settlement, while other curve spreads were slightly wider. The complex took its cue from BTPs in early European trade, with the Italian deputy PM Salvini again making soothing comments that Italy would stick to the EU&rsquo;s budget rules. Informa reported that there was heavy corporate issuance and the associated rate locking weighed on the long-end of the curve, while central bank buying in the front and medium end contributed to the steepening. Yields were nudged further upwards after a decent ISM print. US T-note futures (z8) settled 3+ ticks higher at 120-08+.</p>\r\n",

New Orders also leaped to 65.1 from 60.2 and Employment rose to 58.5 to 56.0 with analysts at ING noting that the accumulation of orders add upside potential for Q3 and Q4. ING also adds that accelerating profits and growth in durable goods indicates a strong investment contribution to Q3 and Q4 GDP, and that since the ISM is at historically high levels it is consistent with a GDP growth of around 8%(!), though added that the relationship between profits accelerating and durable goods has broken down under the Trump Presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CONSTRUCTION SPENDING </strong>disappointed and only rose by 0.1% in July, consensus was for a 0.4% increase. The softness in this reading was attributed to a 1% drop in the private non-residential sector as well as a 3.4% fall in the commercial sector whilst public and housing construction rose mildly. Pantheon Economics notes that these numbers are usually volatile though overall it seems like is weakening after a strong first half of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The German government is reportedly preparing for all possible Brexit outcomes, regulated or unregulated, and urged the EU and the member states to prepare for a failure in Brexit negotiations, Stuttgarter Zeitung reported. Later, Germany&#39;s Merkel said the aim is to reach an agreement with the UK on Brexit, but added that the UK cannot enjoy the same rights as EU members following Brexit. She said she will use all of her force and creativity to make sure a deal happens, adding she does not want discussions with the UK to break down. She did warn, however, that a breakdown in talks cannot be fully ruled out since talks still have no results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BOE Governor Carney hinted that he&rsquo;d be open to extend his stay at the head of the Bank, saying that he recognises the need to help with Brexit changes and was willing to do whatever else he can to promote a smooth Brexit, adding that the Treasury will make an announcement on his future in due course. He also said that there are some advantages to run the succession process when there is more clarity on Brexit. Carney repeated that the MPC does not have a forecast for a no-deal scenario though he expects monetary policy to be tighter under such an outcome whilst he expects to see more positive momentum for GBP if a deal is reached. BOE&#39;s Tenreyro (Dove) noted the direction of policy move after a no-deal outcome is not clear and believes the final shape of Brexit could have a significant effect on the path of the economy. BOE&rsquo;s Haldane (Dove) was slightly more upbeat on the outlook for Brexit, and believes there is a one in four chance of a no-deal, though he said that a no-deal could lead to a material rise in shop prices due to weaker GBP and potential tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> The Syrian Observatory reported Russian war planes resumed air strikes on Syria&rsquo;s rebel-held Idlib province after 22 days. This came after US President Trump warned Syrian President Assad to not recklessly strike the Idlib province in Syria, while Trump also said that Iran and Russia would be making a grave humanitarian error and that hundreds of thousands could be killed if they attack Idlib. Russia&#39;s Kremlin reacted, saying Trump&rsquo;s warning against Idlib is offensive. In later trade the US issued a statement pledging &ldquo;swift&rdquo; action if Syrian President Assad uses chemical weapons again. Elsewhere, NBC reported European officials are planning workarounds for US and Iran sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed&rsquo;s Bullard (Non-Voter, Dove) said &lsquo;we are about where we need to be on rates&rsquo; and noted most of his colleagues see a high chance of a September hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.16% at 2896, NDX -0.42% at 7622, DJI -0.04% at 25953. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.28%, Materials -0.80%, Industrials -0.01%, Cons Discretionary +0.24%, Cons Staples -0.22%, Healthcare -0.72%, Financials +0.53%, Tech -0.30%, Telecoms -1.12%, Utilities +0.55%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) was hit after Goldman Sachs reinitiated coverage with a sell rating, while also casting some doubt on its production targets. Chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM) were top gainers after brokerages lifted their price targets. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) outperformed amid a price target hike at Nomura. PC&amp;G (PCG) posted gains of around 4% following an upgrade at BofA and after the California&rsquo;s legislature passed a bill that could help the co. avoid liabilities related to wildfires damages. Nordstrom (JWN) was up more than 3% after Goldman Sachs rated the stock &lsquo;buy&rsquo;. On the flip side, Nike (NKE) was down more than 3% after a negative backlash to its decision to feature Colin Kaepernick (who protested during the national anthem back in 2016) for its 30th anniversary &lsquo;Just Do It&rsquo; campaign. Facebook (FB) also posted losses after MoffetNathanson downgraded it to &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; from &lsquo;buy&rsquo; citing a negative revenue growth view, and similarly, Verizon (VZ) was down more than 2% following a downgrade at Barclays. Finally, JD.com CEO is under investigation due to sexual misconduct, weighing on shares. Meanwhile, there was much fanfare after Amazon (AMZN) crossed the USD 1trln in market cap mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES 7 C HIGHER AT USD 69.87/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLED 2 C HIGHER AT $78.17/BBL. </strong>Crude was stoked higher ahead of Gordon hitting land later this evening; reports suggest that Gordon is expected to strengthen before hitting land as a hurricane, but will then rapidly weaken. The latest production estimates suggest that 9% of daily crude production has been impacted in the GoM. The crude complex did come off highs in the European afternoon, with reports suggesting that Libyan production was running at a clip of around 1mln BPD, despite militant violence in Tripoli. Traders were also citing newswires surveys out over the last couple of days which hint that OPEC August production will inch up, though the broader narrative remains fixed on the expected tightening of crude supplies later this year, as Iranian sanctions bite, and on that theme, will other OPEC members have the capacity to plug in the gaps left by outages (Iranian imports have already been hit, though production levels are more stable). Weekly API inventory will be released on Wednesday, on account of the US holiday on Monday; analysts expect crude stocks will draw by 1.9mln barrels in the week, distillates are seen building 0.5mln, gasoline is expected to draw 1.5mln barrels; traders cited by newswires are expecting a build at Cushing this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US TREASURY FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 3+ TICKS HIGHER AT 120-08+. </strong>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Tuesday, as traders returned from the holiday weekend, with 2s30s up by around 2bps at settlement, while other curve spreads were slightly wider. The complex took its cue from BTPs in early European trade, with the Italian deputy PM Salvini again making soothing comments that Italy would stick to the EU&rsquo;s budget rules. Informa reported that there was heavy corporate issuance and the associated rate locking weighed on the long-end of the curve, while central bank buying in the front and medium end contributed to the steepening. Yields were nudged further upwards after a decent ISM print.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Traders returned back from Labor Day and bought USD, pushing DXY to 95.737, before paring back slightly. The USD strength was attributed to traders harbouring concerns regarding trade after US/Canada failed to reach a trade deal last week, which was then followed up by contentious tweets from US President Trump. An ISM beat helped along the greenback, to the detriment of the CAD, which saw levels above 1.32.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>Monday&rsquo;s US market holiday is looking more and more like a brief stay of execution or day of calm before another storm for the usual suspects and familiar subjects of investor angst. Indeed, the TRY, RUB, ZAR, BRL, MXN and ARS all succumbed to more heavy selling pressure, sometimes in unison and individually on other occasions, like the Rand on Q2 GDP data confounding consensus for a return to growth and condemning SA to a technical recession instead. USDZAR was around 15.0000 pre-release, but now circa 15.3200 having been up to 15.3375 and seemingly set to test 15.5000, while the Lira fell to 6.7200+ at one stage, Rouble recoiled to almost 68.4800, Real hit 4.1905, Mexican and Argentine Pesos slumped to nearly 19.4800 and 39.0500 respectively, latter despite measures to address fiscal frailty only yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF:</strong> Relative G10 performers, with USDJPY retreating from circa 111.50 highs towards the middle of its range down to 110.90 having failed to absorb the extent of offers on the upside. There was some air let out of the recent CHF bid, with EURCHF and USDCHF trading higher; nevertheless, desks continue to warn about possible SNB intervention in FX; on Friday, the SNB FX reserves data will be eyed for hints about the extent to which the SNB has been in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling is trading heavy, though is off the worst levels on the day. There was some help from BOE governor Carney, who hinted that he could remain at the helm of the BOE until 2020, but the main boost came after German press reported that the EU could adjust Irish border backstop to win UK&#39;s approval in Brexit negotiations; the report was followed-up by positive comments from German Chancellor Merkel, which helped cable rise back to the 1.2850 level, and EURGBP breached 0.90 to the downside, and it has been straddling that level since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, EUR, AUD, CAD: </strong>All extending losses vs the all conquering Greenback, with the Loonie down to 1.3200+ after better US manufacturing surveys on balance than Canadian, and ahead of the resumption of NAFTA talks on Wednesday, alongside the BoC policy meeting that is only given a sub-20% rate hike probability. The Kiwi only just hovered above new y-t-d and multi-year lows around 0.6540, the single currency breached its 21 DMA (1.1544) to test bids at 1.1530 and AUD only managed a mild bounce from circa 0.7160 following comments from RBA&rsquo;s Lowe maintaining a lengthy lead time before tightening, albeit with the next move more likely to be up. Back to NZD, GDT prices may provide some much needed comfort if higher that is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>* The BoC will publish its interest rate decision on Wednesday 5th September at 1500BST/0900CDT. It is expected to hold rates at 1.50%. There will be no updated economic projections or post-meeting press conference. Governor&rsquo;s Poloz recent speech at Jackson Hole, Q2 GDP, and ongoing NAFTA have prepared traders for a potential dovish slant to the statement. The BoC is expected to reiterate data dependency and emphasize gradual policy normalisation. Analysts suggest that the BOC&#39;s meeting may play second fiddle to the US/Canada trade talks taking place on Wednesday. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20010/download\">For the full RANsquawk Preview click here.</a></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index is ending Tuesday&rsquo;s EU session off best levels, but not before extending its rebound from Labor Day lows to just beyond 95.600, and still holding gains vs all G10 counterparts plus EMs of course. To recap, nearest chart resistance resides up at 95.709.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monday&rsquo;s US market holiday is looking more and more like a brief stay of execution or day of calm before another storm for the usual suspects and familiar subjects of investor angst. Indeed, the Try, Rub, Zar, Brl, Mxn and Ars all succumbed to more heavy selling pressure, sometimes in unison and individually on other occasions, like the Rand on Q2 GDP data confounding consensus for a return to growth and condemning SA to a technical recession instead. Usd/Zar was around 15.0000 pre-release, but now circa 15.3200 having been up to 15.3375 and seemingly set to test 15.5000, while the Lira fell to 6.7200+ at one stage, Rouble recoiled to almost 68.4800, Real hit 4.1905, Mexican and Argentine Pesos slumped to nearly 19.4800 and 39.0500 respectively, latter despite measures to address fiscal frailty only yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative G10 performers, with Usd/Jpy retreating from circa 111.50 highs towards the middle of its range down to 110.90 having failed to absorb the extent of offers on the upside, while the Brexit-undermined Pound got some respite from the BoE testimony to the TSC that underlined guidance for further, gradual policy tightening, assigned only a 25% chance to no deal and added that upward inflation pressures in that unlikely event may not be deemed &lsquo;one-off&rsquo;. Cable rebounded from circa 1.2815 and Eur/Gbp retreated through 0.9000 from 0.9030 at one stage and broad Sterling weakness in wake of another UK PMI miss (construction after manufacturing, and with the main services survey to come next).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD/EUR/CHF/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All extending losses vs the all conquering Greenback, with the Loonie down to 1.3200+ after better US manufacturing surveys on balance than Canadian, and ahead of the resumption of NAFTA talks on Wednesday, alongside the BoC policy meeting that is only given a sub-20% rate hike probability. The Kiwi only just hovered above new y-t-d and multi-year lows around 0.6540, the single currency breached its 21 DMA (1.1544) to test bids at 1.1530, the Franc slipped under 0.9750 and Aud only managed a mild bounce from circa 0.7160 following comments from RBA&rsquo;s Lowe maintaining a lengthy lead time before tightening, albeit with the next move more likely to be up. Back to Nzd, GDT prices may provide some much needed comfort if higher that is.</p>\r\n",

(Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US and Canada NAFTA talks concluded on Friday without a breakthrough and are set to resume on Wednesday, while reports also noted that President Trump will notify Congress to proceed with a Mexico-only trade deal that will replace NAFTA. There were also comments from USTR Lighthizer that President Trump will sign a deal with Mexico, and Canada if it is willing, while he added that talks with Canada were constructive and made progress. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU chief Brexit negotiator Barnier stated he strongly opposes UK PM May&#39;s Chequers Brexit trade proposals, while reports noted that negotiators will re-engage again this week. In addition, Barnier also commented that EU and UK do not need more time to reach an agreement and that political decisions are required. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May said she will refuse compromises on her Brexit plan that are not in the national interest and that she is confident the government can broker a good deal for Britain, while she added she will not succumb to those calling for a second referendum. PM May added that progress has been made in negotiations following the Chequers agreement and that the government has also been preparing for the event of a no-deal Brexit. (Sunday Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian equities were choppy with the region indecisive as trade-related concerns lingered and after a non-existent lead from the US which was shut for Labor Day holiday. ASX 200 (-0.3%) was negative and fell below the 6300 level as weakness in tech, energy and financials dragged, while Nikkei 225 (unch) swung between gains and losses amid currency fluctuations. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.1%) closed in the green after also see-sawed as participants contemplated over the potential fresh US tariffs this week and amid CNY price swings, as well as continued liquidity inaction by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher amid the indecisive trade in riskier assets. However, upside was also capped as participants digested the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement in which it upped its purchases of JPY 1-5yr by a total JPY 100bln, which would suggest monthly purchases of those maturities are on track to be reduced to JPY 3.25tln from JPY 3.30tln M/M if the purchase amounts are maintained, considering the recently announced reduction in the number of buying operations for this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8183 (Prev. 6.8347)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA kept the Cash Rate Target unchanged at 1.50% as expected and reiterated that low rates are supporting the economy and that progress on inflation is expected to be gradual, but that it sees inflation higher in 2019.

(Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of voters in the Conservatives&#39; most marginal constituencies believe PM May&#39;s Chequers plan is &quot;bad for Britain&quot;, a new poll has found, (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond could reportedly unveil the budget as soon as next month in order to avoid clashing with last stages of Brexit discussions. (Times) As a reminder, the Treasury has originally wanted to release the budget at the end of November</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a reminder, BoE Governor Carney will be questioned by MPs today over whether he plans to extend his term as governor of the BoE as concerns mount that the uncertainty is damaging its credibility. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump warned Syrian President Assad to not recklessly strike the Idlib province in Syria, while Trump also said that Iran and Russia would be making a grave humanitarian error and that hundreds of thousands could be killed if they attack Idlib. Russia&#39;s Kremlin replied by saying US President Trump&rsquo;s warning against Idlib is offensive and such warnings are not a comprehensive approach to the problem. (Twitter/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Central Bank Governor said there are some factors in favour of a rate hike, while adding there are a lot of factors in favour of holding rates. Of note: the Turkish Central Bank interest rate decision is a day before on the 13th September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade mostly lower (Eurostoxx 50 -1.0%), with the core bourses unwinding gains and plunging into the red following a positive open. Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB outperforming peers as the index is buoyed by Italian banks benefiting from BTP price action. Broad-based losses are experienced across European sectors, with energy names lifted by price action in the complex. The Eurostoxx 50 underwent a reshuffle with sources stating Deutsche Bank, E.on and St. Gobain due to leave the index whilst Linde, Amadeus and Kering are to ender the Stoxx 500. Elsewhere, SocGen (-0.2%) is expects to pay USD 1.4bln in fines over allegations of sanction violations, however the bank is expected to pay far less than rival BNP Paribas paid four years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - A firm rebound in the index to almost 95.600 from lows only a fraction above 95.000 yesterday, and amidst broad gains vs G10 counterparts alongside further outperformance against flagging EMs. Technically, the DXY has near term resistance to aim for at 95.709, but will get further impetus and direction (one way or another) when US markets re-open after the long holiday weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The major underperformers and victims of overall Usd strength/EM weakness and a downturn in risk sentiment, with the Kiwi diving to fresh 2018 and multi-year lows in the process, around 0.6540, and Aud only holding up a bit better on the back of not so dovish/more upbeat RBA rhetoric post-policy meeting overnight (which also offset disappointing current account data), and favourable cross winds. Aud/Usd back below 0.7200, but off circa 0.7160 lows, and Aud/Nzd above 1.0950, albeit just. Ahead, RBA&rsquo;s Lowe to speak</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/CHF - All around 0.4-0.5% softer vs the Greenback, with the single currency well below 1.1600+ peaks and through a key Fib level (1.1569), but finding some traction ahead of 1.1500 and the 21 DMA (1.1544), while the Loonie has lost more ground ahead of the next round of NAFTA talks and BoC tomorrow, even though crude prices are bucking the weak commodity trend and in theory supportive. Usd/Cad is hovering just below 1.3150 with decent offers said to be sitting between 1.3160-70, while the Franc has retreated through 0.9700 and hardly flinched at in line Swiss CPI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP - Usd/Jpy is back above 111.00 and a tad more emphatically to test supply around 111.50, but also eyeing decent option expiries from 111.45-50 (1 bn) for the NY cut, while Cable is only just holding above 1.2800 having breached its 21 DMA (1.2849) and Monday&rsquo;s base (1.2828) amidst stops and another bad UK PMI survey (or rather considerably worse than expected) in the form of construction. The Pound now looking towards the BoE testimony for more independent impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - More pain for the likes of the Lira, Peso, Rouble and Rand, with the latter hit even harder following an unexpected SA GDP contraction that means technical recession to compound the misery of domestic political problems and US sanctions. Usd/Zar up over 15.2500, Usd/Try 6.7200+ at one stage, Usd/Rub above 68.3800 and not helped by a non-committal Central Bank Governor ahead of next Friday&rsquo;s policy meet, while Usd/Mxn is approaching 19.4400 and Usd/Ars is awaiting reaction to tighter fiscal measures announced yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monday&rsquo;s worse than anticipated manufacturing survey suggested a downside bias for the UK construction PMI, but the headline miss was even more pronounced this time and prompted a further rebound in UK debt to new, albeit marginal, Liffe intraday highs at 122.67 (+9 tick vs -1/4 point at worst). Moreover, Bunds have tagged along and are now revisiting 163.00, with another meltdown in EMs sparking a degree of safe-haven demand, along with a retreat across EU cash indices and headlines reporting the resumption of Russian airstrikes in Syria. However, it&rsquo;s not risk-off in the classic or traditional sense with the Usd bid above all else rather than the Jpy or Chf, and Gold below $1200/oz, though bullion has long since lost that kind of allure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures trade on the front foot with both benchmarks above USD 71/bbl and USD 79/bbl respectively. Price action is supported as investors and traders assess the potential threat to US production from tropical storm Gordon that is expected to hit the Gulf Coast (with hurricane warnings in place). Anadarko Petroleum evacuated workers and shut production at two Gulf of Mexico platforms as the storm nears. Elsewhere, due to yesterday&rsquo;s US Labor Day holiday, the API weekly crude inventories have been delayed until tomorrow. In terms of metals, the complex is heavily pressured by the strengthening dollar with gold taking out USD 1200/oz to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venezuelan President Maduro announced to begin charging under new gasoline pricing regime in border areas beginning today.

Moreover, Bunds have tagged along and are now revisiting 163.00, with another meltdown in EMs sparking a degree of safe-haven demand, along with a retreat across EU cash indices and headlines reporting the resumption of Russian airstrikes in Syria. However, it&rsquo;s not risk-off in the classic or traditional sense with the Usd bid above all else rather than the Jpy or Chf, and Gold below $1200/oz, though bullion has long since lost that kind of allure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures trade on the front foot with both benchmarks above USD 71/bbl and USD 79/bbl respectively. Price action is supported as investors and traders assess the potential threat to US production from tropical storm Gordon that is expected to hit the Gulf Coast (with hurricane warnings in place). Anadarko Petroleum evacuated workers and shut production at two Gulf of Mexico platforms as the storm nears. Elsewhere, due to yesterday&rsquo;s US Labor Day holiday, the API weekly crude inventories have been delayed until tomorrow. In terms of metals, the complex is heavily pressured by the strengthening dollar with gold taking out USD 1200/oz to the downside.</p>\r\n",

Technically, the 10 year German bond future may find some support or gain traction ahead of 162.82-80 (50% fib area), but this looks more fundamental, flow and spread-related with US Treasuries also slipping to fresh overnight session lows and the curve steepening more steeply. Back to Liffe, the nearest downside level on the charts for Gilts is 122.17, while the STIR strip is holding up better, front end especially, ahead of the UK construction PMI and BoE testimony to the TSC (and following surveys overnight showing a downturn in August retail consumption, BRC and Barclaycard).</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.4%) was negative and fell below the 6300 level as weakness in tech, energy and financials dragged, while Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) swung between gains and losses amid currency fluctuations. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) also see-sawed as participants contemplated over the potential fresh US tariffs this week and amid CNY price swings, as well as continued liquidity inaction by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher amid the indecisive trade in riskier assets. However, upside was also capped as participants digested the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement in which it upped its purchases of JPY 1-5yr by a total JPY 100bln, which would suggest monthly purchases of those maturities are on track to be reduced to JPY 3.25tln from JPY 3.30tln M/M if the purchase amounts are maintained, considering the recently announced reduction in the number of buying operations for this month.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The RBA is to conduct its latest policy meeting today in which expectations are one-sided for the central bank to keep the Cash Rate Target unchanged at the record low 1.50% where it has been for over 2 years. This has been reflected in ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures which price in 100% expectations for no change in rates, while the implied yield curve suggests the RBA is expected to remain on hold through to at least 2020 in comparison to just a month ago when expectations were leaning towards a hike in August 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA rate decisions have been somewhat of a formality for quite some time as the central bank has refrained from providing any surprises and have continuously repeated its statement that the board sees no strong case for a change in rates in the near-term and that the next move is likely to be a hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rhetoric from officials also back an unlikelihood for rate changes anytime soon as RBA&#39;s Ellis previously commented that progress on getting unemployment down and inflation up is likely to be only gradual which suggests any increase is still likely to be some time away, while RBA Governor Lowe has all but dismissed future prospects of easing as he recently stated there is a low probability of the central bank cutting rates barring a major crisis in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data releases since the last meeting have been mixed with Employment Change in July at a surprise contraction of -3.9k vs. Exp. 15.0k (Prev. 50.9k) and although the Unemployment Rate fell to 5.3% vs. Exp. 5.4% (Prev. 5.4%), this coincided with a drop in the Participation Rate to 65.5% vs. Exp. 65.7% (Prev. 65.7%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Construction Work for Q2 was more encouraging at 1.6% vs. Exp. 0.7% (Prev. 0.2%, Rev. 2.4%) and Capital Expenditure Q2 -2.5% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.4%) missed expectations, but there was an upgrade to capex plans for 2018-2019 with Capital Expenditure Est. 3 lifted to 102.0B (Prev. 87.7B). Therefore, these varied releases adds support to the widespread consensus for the RBA to stand pat and maintain a wait and see approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other factors worth noting include Westpac&#39;s recent hike in mortgage rates, as some economists suggested this could spur the other big 4 banks to follow suit and is effectively seen as policy tightening which could ease pressure for the RBA to begin its normalization. The RBA has also noted current high debt levels as a restriction which could make future policy decisions difficult and could also make economy less resilient to economic shocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The policy decision is due at 0530BST, although the announcement itself is not expected to trigger any significant price moves as has been the case as a hold in rates is unanimously expected and given the tendency for the central bank to repeat prior statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent Comments and Calls<br />- Westpac forecasts RBA to keep rates unchanged at record low 1.50% through 2020 vs. Prev. forecast of no change through to end-2019.<br />- RBC forecasts RBA to hike rates in Q4 2019 and again in Q1 2020, then it expects rates to be kept unchanged for some time.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade choppy with the region indecisive as trade-related concerns linger and after a non-existent lead from US which was shut for Labor Day holiday. ASX 200 (-0.4%) is negative and fell below the 6300 level amid weakness in tech, energy and financials, while Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) swung between gains and losses amid currency fluctuations. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) also see-sawed as participants contemplate over potential fresh US tariffs this week and amid CNY price swings as well as continued liquidity inaction by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is slightly firmer overnight amid softness in its major counterparts across the pond with EUR/USD testing 1.1600 to the downside and with GBP/USD languishing firmly below 1.2900 on the ongoing Brexit-related bickering which has led to increasing worries of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal. Antipodeans are also softer with NZD/USD giving up the 0.6600 handle and with AUD/USD pressured by a wider than expected Current Account Deficit, while focus turns to the RBA rate decision later although no major fireworks are expected with expectations one-sided for the central bank to remain on hold. Elsewhere, USD/JPY trades choppy around the 111.00 level alongside the indecisive risk tone and China&rsquo;s currency firmed after the PBoC strengthened the fix which pushed USD/CNY and USD/CNH briefly below 6.8100 and 6.8200 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid the indecisive trade in riskier assets. However, upside is capped as participants also digest the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement in which it upped its purchases of JPY 1-5yr by a total JPY 100bln, which would suggest monthly purchases of those maturities are on track to be reduced to JPY 3.25tln from JPY 3.30tln M/M if the purchase amounts are maintained considering the recently announced reduction in the number of buying operations for this month.</p>\r\n",
