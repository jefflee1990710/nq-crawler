He also suggested that QE could end after September if the economy &amp; inflation develop as now expected.

He is also of the belief that there is a need to adjust ECB communication; and that the ECB should discuss &#39;intensively&#39; how to change its language, and suggested that the ECB should adjust its policy guidance before summer.

USD/JPY dropped below 111.00 and briefly below 110.50. Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda spoke overnight, and although he mentioned that QQE with YCC will continue for as long as necessary, he did appear slightly more upbeat about the outlook for prices. The next major risk event for the JPY will be next week&rsquo;s BoJ decision, with various source reports suggesting that the Bank will mark up its FY2018 growth estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile EUR/USD burst through 1.2200, topping out just shy of 1.2300, with barrier option defence in front of the figure being touted; we last trade just below 1.2260. Hawkish comments from the ECB&rsquo;s Hansson &ndash; who said QE could be ended in one step without any problems, and could end after September if economy &amp; inflation develop as now expected &ndash; helped to push EUR within a whisker of the 1.23 handle. GBP/USD continued to move higher, printing above 1.3800 at one point, in turn registering a fresh post-Brexit highs. Key UK risk events this week include tomorrow&rsquo;s inflation data and Friday&rsquo;s retail sales release. AUD and NZD have both continued their respective advances against the greenback, while the CAD underperformed. The loonie still managed to print gains against the USD, with USD/CAD sitting above 1.24. Traders await Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC decision, with rates markets pricing in a circa 90% chance of a 25bps hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Bundesbank spokeswoman said that the Bundesbank has not yet invested reserves in CNY following earlier reports citing Bundesbank&#39;s Dombret, which suggested that the bank will add the CNY into its currency reserves.

        "content": "<p>NOTE: US MARKETS WERE CLOSED FOR THE MARTIN LUTHER KING NATIONAL HOLIDAY</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANK SPEAK: Tenreyro&rsquo;s first speech; Hawkish Hansson</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Hansson said that QE could be ended in one step without any problems. He also suggested that QE could end after September if the economy &amp; inflation develop as now expected. He also noted that the Euro&rsquo;s appreciation not a threat to inflation up until now, its rise should not be overdramatized. He is also of the belief that there is a need to adjust ECB communication; and that the ECB should discuss &#39;intensively&#39; how to change its language, and suggested that the ECB should adjust its policy guidance before summer. Hansson is also of the belief that the ECB should hike rates a &quot;few times&quot; before starting to reduce the size of its balance sheet. EUR strengthened on his comments, before paring back slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although she has given interviews and appeared before the UK Treasury Select Committee, BOE&rsquo;s external member Tenreyro delivered her first actual speech as an MPC member. Tenreyro said that at December meeting, she saw &#39;ample time&#39; before the BOE would need to raise rates, expects a couple more hikes over next three years if economy performs as expected. Sterling was little changed after her comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: EMINI S&amp;P closed +5.75 at 2,794.50; EMINI Nasdaq 100 closed +5 6780.25; Mini Dow closed +136 at 25937</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures traversed sideways in thin trade. European shares were mixed/slightly lower on Monday, with cyclical stocks weighed on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UK, focus was on Carillion, the second-largest government contractor, after the company collapsed. It&rsquo;s rivals Serco, Kier and Interserve were higher, though Balfour Beatty &ndash; which has some JVs with the company &ndash; was lower. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tomorrow, key US earnings will be in the spotlight, with the likes of UnitedHealth, Citigroup, Charles Schwab and Markit on the earnings slate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: USD down 0.6% heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The greenback has started the week where it left off, lower, despite a lack of fundamental catalysts, against a backdrop of lower liquidity with the US out for Martin Luther King day. The DXY last trades at 90.50 there or thereabouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/JPY dropped below 111.00, and now trades below the 110.50 mark. Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda spoke overnight, and although he mentioned that QQE with YCC will continue for as long as necessary, he did appear slightly more upbeat about the outlook for prices. The next major risk event for the JPY will be next week&rsquo;s BoJ decision, with various source reports suggesting that the Bank will mark up its FY2018 growth estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile EUR/USD burst through 1.2200, topping out just shy of 1.2300, with barrier option defence in front of the figure being touted; we last trade just below 1.2260. Hawkish comments from the ECB&rsquo;s Hansson &ndash; who said QE could be ended in one step without any problems, and could end after September if economy &amp; inflation develop as now expected &ndash; helped to push EUR within a whisker of the 1.23 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/USD continued to move higher, printing above 1.3800 at one point, in turn registering a fresh post-Brexit highs. Key UK risk events this week include tomorrow&rsquo;s inflation data and Friday&rsquo;s retail sales release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AUD and NZD have both continued their respective advances against the greenback, while the CAD underperformed. The loonie still managed to print gains against the USD, with USD/CAD sitting above 1.24. Traders await Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC decision, with rates markets pricing in a circa 90% chance of a 25bps hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: Crude trades higher at the start of the week in thin trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trade in crude was thin due to a US market holiday, leaving crude free to advance amid a weaker US dollar. Brent managed to break through the $70 figure, while WTI is now flirting with the $65 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fundamental news was thin, with traders latching on to comments from a few major oil producers, which called on OPEC to continue with its output supply curbs despite prices recently rising to multi-year highs.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The greenback has started the week where it left off, lower, despite a lack of fundamental catalysts, against a backdrop of lower liquidity with the US out for Martin Luther King day. The DXY last trades at 90.50 there or thereabouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/JPY dropped below 111.00 before finding support ahead of 110.50. Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda spoke overnight, and although he mentioned that QQE with YCC will continue for as long as necessary, he did appear slightly more upbeat about the outlook for prices. The next major risk event for the JPY will be next week&rsquo;s BoJ decision, with various source reports suggesting that the Bank will mark up its FY2018 growth estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile EUR/USD burst through 1.2200, topping out just shy of 1.2300, with barrier option defence in front of the figure being touted; we last trade just below 1.2260.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/USD continued to move higher, printing above 1.3800 at one point, in turn registering a fresh post-Brexit highs. Key UK risk events this week include tomorrow&rsquo;s inflation data and Friday&rsquo;s retail sales release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AUD and NZD have both continued their respective advances against the greenback, while the CAD underperformed. The loonie still managed to print gains against the USD, with USD/CAD sitting at 1.2425, off of the 1.2405 low. Traders await Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC decision, with rates markets pricing in a circa 90% chance of a 25bps hike.</p>\r\n",

The DXY has now slipped below 90.500, and to recap 90.251 is a support of sorts, but 90.000 looks more likely to give Dollar bears something to at least think about. Turning to currency pairs, Eur/Usd has now surpassed 2 of the December 2014 peaks ahead of 1.2300 and looks intent of testing the next one at 1.2302, but 1.2350 could prove more of an obstacle. Cable is above 1.3800 and one bank has 1.3835 in mind, while Usd/Jpy is testing 110.50 again. Usd/Chf has broken the resolve of chart buyers at 0.9630 and 0.9599 is next, Aud/Usd is back up near best levels ahead of 0.8000 and Nzd/Usd only a few pips off 0.7300, while Usd/Cad is on the brink of 1.2400 vs 1.2355 on January 5<sup>th</sup> when Canadian jobs data blew away consensus vs the NFP disappointment.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>European equity markets have started the week in negative territory, taking a breather after the gains seen since the start of the year. The UK construction and management company Carillion was in focus after the company was forced to go into voluntary liquidation as talks to rescue the company failed, however, trading in their shares was suspended. Serco shares rallied over 3% as markets bet that the company should be able to benefit from the collapse of Carillion, while Carillion supplier Speedy Hire fell over 10%. GKN shares have started the week positively after reports that they are considering spinning off a unit to fend off takeover interest and as Melrose said it&rsquo;s planning to meet with shareholders following their rejected takeover offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD has started the week where it left off: lower. USD/JPY bore the brunt of the weakness, dropping below 111.00 before finding support ahead of 110.50. BoJ Governor Kuroda spoke overnight and although he mentioned that QQE with YCC will continue for as long as necessary, the BoJ Governor appeared slightly more upbeat about the outlook for prices. Meanwhile EUR/USD burst through 1.2200 and GBP/USD trades at its highest level since the UK voted to leave the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weaker USD has benefitted precious metals with gold higher and palladium now trading at a record high. Base metals also gained with LME copper up over 2% on the LME and zinc up to a 10-year high. WTI and Brent crude futures are both a touch lower as Brent failed to make a clean break above USD 70/bbl. Volumes are expected to remain light today owing to the Martin Luther King holiday in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Fixed Income markets, Bunds and Gilts both extended gains before fading to stand some 20 ticks above parity, with the former seeing further strength on a break of Friday&rsquo;s Eurex session high to reach 160.76 (+38 ticks on the day), but unable to really challenge the next resistance area on some intraday or short term charts between 160.85-90. 0.5% in 10 year cash is now support rather than psychological resistance and the level is holding, while Gilts probably saw some selling ahead of 124.00 as the Liffe high so far is 123.97 (+37 ticks). Turnover remains light and will likely stay subdued without US participants, but this could result in some exaggerated price action/moves. UST futures are trading, but again amidst low volumes and modestly firmer with a slight flattening bias for choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The latter is the obvious nearest objective, before support around 90.442 and 90.251, as the Greenback loses more ground against all its G10 and other major rivals, plus commodities and EM currencies. The CNY hit its strongest level vs the Usd after the PBoC&rsquo;s fix and Germany&rsquo;s Buba said the Chinese unit will become a reserve currency.

The Eur has rallied beyond 1.2200 with relative ease, but may encounter a bit more resistance approaching a series of December 2014 peaks around 1.2252-56, 1.2273 and 1.2302, as CFTC data shows another record rise in spec longs (circa 144.7k contracts or 21.5 bn in cash terms). Aud and Nzd now above 0.7950 and 0.7275 vs their Dollar counterpart, with the Kiwi eyeing 0.7298 just before the next big figure.

Usd/Cad just above 1.2400 and Usd/Mxn around 18.8750, with the Loonie and Peso both benefiting from supportive NAFTA vibes (US President Trump said to be softening his stance somewhat). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The benchmark yield breached 0.5%, but stopped well short of the next upside area around 0.62-0.63% targeted by many tech studies and has subsequently retreated to retest the psychological level, which represents a pivot point and will likely determine whether futures rebound further or reverse course again. Monday&rsquo;s agenda is typically light in terms of data and of course volumes are thinner than normal due to the US MLK holiday. Turning to Liffe, Gilts have also re-joined the fray on a firmer footing between 123.66-80 vs the 123.60 previous close, while Short Sterling and Euribor strips are flat to 2 ticks ahead, with the latter perhaps drawing some comfort from comments by ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann downplaying near term rate hike expectations (after late 2018 tightening prospects rose to circa 70% post-December&rsquo;s minutes). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began the week mostly positive as optimism trickled through from last Friday&rsquo;s performance on Wall St in which all majors posted fresh record levels once again as earnings season got underway and where the energy sector was bolstered by upside in crude. ASX 200 (+0.1%) traded positive with outperformance in gold miners after the precious metal which edged a 5th weekly consecutive gain, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) was also in the green but well off best levels as a firmer JPY pared the strength seen in the index at the open. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) eyed record closing highs and the Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) was choppy after the PBoC announced to lend nearly CNY 400bln via its Medium-term Lending Facility, which briefly eased mainland jitters arising from discouraging lending data and further reports of increased financial sector oversight to curb risks. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with demand subdued by a positive risk tone in Japan and after an uneventful Rinban announcement, in which the BoJ maintained purchase amounts.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week mostly positive as optimism trickles through from last Friday&rsquo;s performance on Wall St in which all majors posted fresh record levels once again as earnings season got underway and where the energy sector was bolstered by upside in crude. ASX 200 (+0.1%) is positive with gold miners outperforming in Australia after advances in the precious metal which edged a 5<sup>th</sup> weekly consecutive gain on Friday, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) is also in the green but well off best levels as a firmer JPY pares the strength seen in the index at the open. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) closes in on a record high and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) also found support after the PBoC announced to lend nearly CNY 400bln via its Medium-term Lending Facility, which helped shrug off early mainland jitters arising from discouraging lending data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD continues to weaken against its major counterparts with antipodeans also benefitting as a proxy, after the PBoC set its firmest fix since May 2016 which pushed USD/CNH to below 6.4400. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was another fallout from the greenback&rsquo;s woes as the pair tripped through stops on a break below 111.00 and amid comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who stuck to the usual rhetoric of maintaining current policy, although some noted the absence of reference to &lsquo;powerful easing&rsquo;. In addition, NAFTA currencies also remain firm with USD/MXN at its lowest in a month after reports that President Trump is said to be softening his attitude towards NAFTA and taking risks of withdrawal more seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand subdued by a positive risk tone in Japan and after an uneventful Rinban announcement, in which the BoJ maintained purchase amounts in 5yr-10yr, 10yr-25yr and 25yr+ maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
