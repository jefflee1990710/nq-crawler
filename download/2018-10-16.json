Banks Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) moved higher after topping earnings estimates. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) pulled up the healthcare sector on the back of beating earnings estimates and raising forecasts for the year. Tesla (TSLA) was another top mover following Elon Musk tweeting the implementation of a new chip in its cars which will improve autopilot features. W.W. Grainger (GWW) and BlackRock (BLK) were bottom movers today after both their earnings beat estimates but revenues missed. Other stocks down, on what otherwise was a largely positive day, were AutoZone (AZO), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and Comerica (CMA). SPX +2.2% at 2750.78, NDX +2.9% at 7276, DJI +2.2% at 25798.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were mixed, with only modest movement in yields within tight ranges. There was a bias towards curve flattening, though major spreads were only modestly narrower, with some analysts suggesting flatteners were being put on in pre-FOMC minutes trade (Weds, see below for preview). The lack meaningful moves helped contribute to a firmer risk tone after the release of a solid JOLTs survey for August, falling equity volatility, as well as generally upbeat earnings reports. JPMorgan&#39;s latest client Treasury survey found active clients cutting longs to below the four-week average, while shorts were also pared back, and consequently, neutrals rose, taking net positioning to the top of its monthly range. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 2 ticks higher at 118-07.</p>\r\n",

With regards to a timescale, an official said that Brexit talks are on track for November, though &nbsp;Irish PM Varadkar repeated that the deadline for a Brexit deal could slip from October (on Monday he suggested December); he nonetheless strongly believes a no-deal Brexit is unlikely. Similarly, EU Brexit Negotiator Barnier sees December as the &#39;ultimate deadline&#39; for a deal. On the EU side, a Senior official said a December Brexit agreement could work for the EU but could mean a tight schedule for the UK parliament, adding it is not going to be easy to find a deal. Elsewhere, The Telegraph reported UK Cabinet Ministers should pressure UK PM May to abandon her Chequers plan or Tory Eurosceptic MPs will threaten a no confidence vote within days. In late trade, sources said the UK government Cabinet was told by the Chief Whip that the Brexit backstop will not pass Parliament, since it does not have enough votes. In later reports, the European Commission said to have offered UK to remain in the Customs Union beyond December 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>The Italian Government confirmed the 2.4% deficit/GDP target for 2019 and 1.2% economic growth forecast for 2018 with a Parliament watchdog not validating the economic forecasts. In an interview with CNBC, Italian Lega Economic adviser Borghi stated that Italy are open to compromise on the budget whilst Italian PM Conte said that they are proud of the budget and they hope for a positive dialogue with Brussels. In response, EU Commission President Juncker noted the Italian public finance is a cause of great concern, hinting Brussels may reject the country&rsquo;s fiscal plan. He stressed there is no prejudice in Brussels against Italy though he stated the Eurozone would rebel if the EU approves the budget. Moreover, European Commission VP Dombrovskis stated the EU has already assessed the 2.4% Italy deficit target. In terms of components, the budget was touted not to include a tax incentives to encourage domestic retail investors to buy government bonds but the measure could be added as an amendment in Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>EU&#39;s Trade Commissioner Malmstrom said if the US imposes 25% tariffs, the EU must react, adding that they are making efforts not to lose time in trade talks but do not want a deadline. Elsewhere, USTR is to open trade talks with the EU, UK and Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Turkish officials reported that evidence has been found within the Saudi consulate that Khashoggi was killed there; this came after US Senate Majority McConnell announced that if reports about the missing journalist are found to be true, the Senate is likely to act. A US Administration official then indicated the US has an important relationship with Saudi Arabia, though this does not mean it is ignoring other issues with the Kingdom. Elsewhere, US National Security Advisor Bolton is to meet Russia&#39;s Security Council Secretary and Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow next week. Finally, it was reported the Trump administration has a new plan to drive Iran out of Syria by squeezing it financially alongside other efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>US President Trump renewed criticism of the Fed ahead of the FOMC Minutes on Wednesday saying &#39;my biggest threat is the Fed&#39; and adding the Fed is independent and he does not speak to them, in a Fox Business interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION </strong>for September came in strong positing at 0.3%. above the 0.2% consensus. Analysts at Wells Fargo note that higher oil prices continue to support mining activity which rose by 0.5% last month; manufacturing also rose 0.2% on the back of gains in motor vehicles. Further to this, Hurricane Florence seems to have had limited impact on the data. Wells Fargo however highlights that total industrial production is has slowed down over the quarter and they expect further &lsquo;moderation in the coming months amid</p>\r\n\r\n<p>slower global growth, a strong dollar, ongoing trade tensions and rising rates&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JOLTS: </strong>The number of openings rose to 7.136mln in August, above the expected 6.945mln, hitting another new high. The prior was also revised up to 7.077mln. Analysts at Pantheon noted that the strong reading is consistent with other private surveys which are showing that labour demand is rising much faster than supply. They further noted that the quits rate was unchanged at 2.4% and they do not expect any further increase this year. The data, which doesn&rsquo;t often move markets, saw a positive, bullish reaction, helping stocks to rebound after their recent slide, which also contributed to a firmer risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAHB</strong> Index rose to 68 in October against a previous and 67; analysts at Pantheon highlight the reading was boosted by the buyer traffic index which rose to a nine-month high. Nonetheless they argue &lsquo;some uptick in sales in the next couple of months is a reasonable bet, but a sustained upward trend is too much to hope for;&rsquo; as they believe housing market has peaked for this cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Adobe (ADBE) was a heavyweight gainer on the day after investors were reassured by its backing of previous earnings forecasts and 2019 targets, contributing to the tech sectors outperformance. Banks Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) moved higher after topping earnings estimates. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) pulled up the healthcare sector on the back of beating earnings estimates and raising forecasts for the year. Tesla (TSLA) was another top mover following Elon Musk tweeting the implementation of a new chip in its cars which will improve autopilot features. W.W. Grainger (GWW) and BlackRock (BLK) were bottom movers today after both their earnings beat estimates but revenues missed. Other stocks down, on what otherwise was a largely positive day, were AutoZone (AZO), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and Comerica (CMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 0.14 HIGHER AT USD 71.92/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.63 HIGHER AT USD 81.41/BBL. </strong>In early US trade, crude was trading cautious, with traders expecting weekly inventory data to show a build in headline crude stocks of 2.2mln, Cushing stocks are expected to build (by 282k vs 9/Oct, and 1.76mln vs 5/Oct); products are seen drawing, with distillates stocks expected to fall by 1.3mln, while gasoline stocks are seen slipping by 1.1mln. The crude complex picked up in later trade, as it tracked improving risk sentiment, following a solid JOLTs report out of the US, falling VIX, and investors encouraged by decent corporate earnings. In other news, traders continue to monitor news flow regarding the &#39;missing&#39; journalist in Turkey, and PVM argued that Saudis have denied any involvement and after US President floated the idea of a &#39;rouge killer&#39;, at present it does not seem likely that Saudi oil supply will be negatively affected by the incident at this stage. Elsewhere, traders continue to cite EIA data from earlier in the week which showed US shale production is expected to rise by 100k in November to 7.71mln BPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 2 TICKS HIGHER AT 118-07. </strong>Treasuries were mixed, with only modest movement in yields within tight ranges. There was a bias towards curve flattening, though major spreads were only modestly narrower, with some analysts suggesting flatteners were being put on in pre-FOMC minutes trade (Weds, see below for preview). The lack meaningful moves helped contribute to a firmer risk tone after the release of a solid JOLTs survey for August, falling equity volatility, as well as generally upbeat earnings reports. JPMorgan&#39;s latest client Treasury survey found active clients cutting longs to below the four-week average, while shorts were also pared back, and consequently, neutrals rose, taking net positioning to the top of its monthly range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;* DXY: </strong>Drifted below the 95.00 handle to fresh October lows at 94.789, with the index and Dollar in general unable to glean any real support from a marginal beat in US industrial production, an upbeat JOLTS report, and an uptick in the NAHB index. The DXY moved back towards the 95.00 figure where it has been consolidating in late trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>The Pound remains relatively resilient despite ongoing Brexit uncertainty and a raft of official opinion that the risk of a no deal is now greater than it has been. However, PM May called for unity from her cabinet and reported no signs of anybody threatening to resign, while UK data in the form of average earnings also underpinned Sterling, with Cable probing higher above 1.3200 and nearer to 1.3250 and Eur/Gbp back below 0.8800 towards 0.8750 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency failed to sustain another 1.1600+ foray vs the Greenback, with technical resistance at a key DMA capping the pair and some fundamental weights impacting via a disappointing ZEW survey and persistent EU angst over elements of Italy&rsquo;s budget (ie Juncker reiterating grave concerns about the country&rsquo;s fiscal situation).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD: </strong>The Kiwi is retesting overnight peaks just shy of 0.6600 vs the Usd, as the Greenback extends losses vs most counterparts bar the traditional safe-havens. To recap, the Nzd derived independent impetus from Q3 CPI data showing headline inflation data above consensus and closer to the RBNZ&rsquo;s 2% target at 1.9% y/y.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Another major beneficiary of weakness in its US peer and continuing its rebound from recent lows under 1.3000 towards 1.2925.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Still lagging behind its antipodean counterpart with the cross hovering around 1.0850, but regaining some lost ground vs the Usd as 0.7100 held firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, JPY: </strong>Bucking the overall trend for the bulk if not entire EU session, as the Franc retreated to 0.9900 vs the Usd and extended losses through 1.1450 against the Eur, reversing course from the end of last week and yesterday, while the Jpy failed to seriously challenge a sub-112.00 fib and nibbled at bids said to be relatively generously stacked up to 112.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK: </strong>More hawkish Riksbank prospects and heightened expectations of a lift-off in the repo at December&rsquo;s policy meeting post-last week&rsquo;s strong Swedish inflation data gave the Krona another boost, with Eur/Sek down through key chart support and almost breaching 10.3000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP - FOMC September 2018 Meeting Minutes due on 17th October 2018 at 1400 EST/1900 BST.</strong> FOMC hiked rates by 25bps at its September meeting, as was expected, and removed the reference in its statement that policy is &#39;accommodative&#39;. Forecasts were little changed, though the central bank&#39;s new dot sees rates at between 3.25-3.50% in 2021, matching the level of its 2020 projection, hinting that the FOMC has put a soft end-date to its hiking cycle. Additionally, it appears that the FOMC does not intend to raise rates above its estimate of neutral (the broadest estimate of the Fed&#39;s neutral rate range, determined from FOMC speakers over the past few months, is between 2.50-3.50%). In his press conference, Powell endorsed a gradual approach, and noted that some participants saw a moderate overshoot of neutral rate. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20321/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk Preview.</a></p>\r\n",

The crude complex picked up in later trade, as it tracked improving risk sentiment, following a solid JOLTs report out of the US, falling VIX, and investors encouraged by decent corporate earnings. In other news, traders continue to monitor news flow regarding the &#39;missing&#39; journalist in Turkey, and PVM argued that Saudis have denied any involvement and after US President floated the idea of a &#39;rouge killer&#39;, at present it does not seem likely that Saudi oil supply will be negatively affected by the incident at this stage. Elsewhere, traders continue to cite EIA data from earlier in the week which showed US shale production is expected to rise by 100k in November to 7.71mln BPD.</p>\r\n",

To recap, the Nzd derived independent impetus from Q3 CPI data showing headline inflation data above consensus and closer to the RBNZ&rsquo;s 2% target at 1.9% y/y.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drifting a bit further below the 95.000 handle and down to fresh October lows at 94.789, with the index and Dollar in general unable to glean any real support from a marginal beat in US ip, an upbeat JOLTS tally and an uptick in the NAHB index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound remains relatively resilient despite ongoing Brexit uncertainty and a raft of official opinion that the risk of a no deal is now greater than it has been. However, PM May called for unity from her cabinet and reported no signs of anybody threatening to resign, while UK data in the form of average earnings also underpinned Sterling, with Cable probing higher above 1.3200 and nearer to 1.3250 and Eur/Gbp back below 0.8800 towards 0.8750 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major beneficiary of weakness in its US peer and continuing its rebound from recent lows under 1.3000 towards 1.2925.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still lagging behind its antipodean counterpart with the cross hovering around 1.0850, but regaining some lost ground vs the Usd as 0.7100 held firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency failed to sustain another 1.1600+ foray vs the Greenback, with technical resistance at a key DMA capping the pair and some fundamental weights impacting via a disappointing ZEW survey and persistent EU angst over elements of Italy&rsquo;s budget (ie Juncker reiterating grave concerns about the country&rsquo;s fiscal situation).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bucking the overall trend for the bulk if not entire EU session, as the Franc retreated to 0.9900 vs the Usd and extended losses through 1.1450 against the Eur, reversing course from the end of last week and yesterday, while the Jpy failed to seriously challenge a sub-112.00 fib and nibbled at bids said to be relatively generously stacked up to 112.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More hawkish Riksbank prospects and heightened expectations of a lift-off in the repo at December&rsquo;s policy meeting post-last week&rsquo;s strong Swedish inflation data gave the Krona another boost, with Eur/Sek down through key chart support and almost breaching 10.3000.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) and Japanese exporters coat-tailed on favourable currency moves, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.9 %) and Hang Seng (+0.1%) initially conformed to the upbeat tone as participants brushed aside continued PBoC liquidity inaction and took encouragement from the numerous corporate positive profit alerts, although Chinese bourses then failed to sustain the gains and gradually slipped into negative territory.

Meanwhile, the UK benchmark is pressured by a firmer currency along with heavy-weight mining names following price action in the complex. Sectors are mixed, with utilities names outperforming while energy names lag given the recent slump in oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of individual stocks, Volvo shares fell over 5% after the detection of premature degradation of emission control components. On the flip side, Drax Group are up by over 4.5% after the company acquired a UK power generation portfolio with a proposed deal for GBP 702mln, while Altice share rose 5% following commentary that Co. has Mirova, Macquaries and KKR as frontrunners for a fibre JV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi has been boosted by stronger than expected NZ CPI data overnight, and almost rallied to 0.6600 vs the Usd, while the Pound derived enough momentum from higher than forecast UK average earnings to breach 1.3200, albeit briefly amidst ongoing Brexit fall-out from the failure to clinch an agreement in time for this week&rsquo;s EU summit that in turn was a prerequisite for another one in November to finalise a withdrawal deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/EUR/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, as the DXY continues to pivot 95.000, with the Loonie rebounding from recent 1.3000+ lows after a somewhat mixed BoC business survey on Monday (are rather redundant given that it was conducted pre-USMCA), while the single currency stalled around 1.1600 again and hampered by downbeat ZEW investor sentiment readings. Eur/Usd is just holding above 1.1565 lows, but could be drawn towards hefty option expiries at the 1.1550 strike (1.3 bn ahead of the NY cut).

Indeed, following pretty positive comments from Eurogroup head Centeno who stated that Italy does not pose a risk, the 10 year bond has rallied over 121.00, albeit belatedly, while Portuguese paper extends its post-S&amp;P outlook upgrade ascent. However, Gilts and US Treasuries remain close to their lows post-UK data and pre-IP respectively.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) was led by mining names after the recent strength in gold prices and with Rio Tinto shares supported following its Q3 production update in which iron ore shipments declined Y/Y but the Co. affirmed FY18 shipments at the upper end of its guidance range. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) and Japanese exporters coat-tailed on favourable currency moves, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) and Hang Seng (-0.4%) initially conformed to the upbeat tone as participants brushed aside continued PBoC liquidity inaction and took encouragement from the numerous corporate positive profit alerts, although Chinese bourses then failed to sustain the gains and gradually slipped into negative territory. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as they tracked weakness in T-notes, with prices also subdued by the improved risk tone in Japan and reduced demand at the 5yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations again for a net neutral daily position.

Tusk added that a no-deal Brexit more likely than it was before and stated the fact that we are preparing for a no-deal scenario must not, under any circumstances, lead us away from making every effort to reach the best agreement possible, for all sides. Furthermore, Tusk also noted that he invited UK PM May to address remaining EU 27 member states on Wednesday night.

As such, the Asia-Pac currencies took much of the attention overnight in which USD/JPY briefly reclaimed the 112.00 level on safe-haven outflows, while antipodeans were mixed with AUD unmoved after an unsurprising RBA minutes which mostly kept to reiterations and with NZD/USD struggling to hold on to the gains seen in the aftermath of firmer than expected CPI data from New Zealand which edged closer towards the 2% inflation target mid-point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA minutes from October 2nd meeting reiterated that the board agreed there was no strong case for near-term rate move and that the next move is likely to be upwards. RBA minutes also noted the board agreed keeping rates steady is a source of stability and confidence, while the board was noted to be uncertain regarding consumption due to subdued income growth and decline in home prices.

ASX 200 (+0.5%) was led by mining names after the recent strength in gold prices and with Rio Tinto shares supported following its Q3 production update in which iron ore shipments declined Y/Y but the Co. affirmed FY18 shipments at the upper end of its guidance range. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) and Japanese exporters coat-tailed on favourable currency moves, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) and Hang Seng (-0.4%) initially conformed to the upbeat tone as participants brushed aside continued PBoC liquidity inaction and took encouragement from the numerous corporate positive profit alerts, although Chinese bourses then failed to sustain the gains and gradually slipped into negative territory. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as they tracked weakness in T-notes, with prices also subdued by the improved risk tone in Japan and reduced demand at the 5yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The RBA are to release the minutes from the October meeting where the central bank held the Cash Rate Target at the record low of 1.50%. This was in-line with consensus as ASX 30 Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures had indicated a 100% expectation the central bank would keep policy unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the meeting, the RBA reiterated that low rates are supporting the economy and stated that progress on inflation expected to be gradual but that it sees inflation higher in 2019 and 2020. Furthermore, RBA added that wage growth remains low which is likely to continue for a while but stated that outlook for labor market and business conditions are positive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a guide, AUD/USD saw only mild support following the policy announcement and statement despite the comments not providing anything particularly surprising, as the tone of the statement was slightly upbeat and did little to alter the perception regarding the likelihood for the next move in rates to be a hike rather than a cut.</p>\r\n",
