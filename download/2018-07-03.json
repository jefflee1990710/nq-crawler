ECB&rsquo;s Praet said he is confident the sustained convergence of inflation will continue in the period ahead, even after a gradual wind down of new asset purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.5%, NASDAQ COMP &nbsp;-1.2%, DJI &nbsp;-0.5%.</strong> SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -0.4%, Cons Non-Cyclicals:&nbsp; +0.5%, Energy: +0.6%, Financials: -0.5%, Health Care:&nbsp; &nbsp;+0.4%, Industrials: -0.3%, Materials: -0.2%, Telecoms: +1.3%, Tech: -1.0%, Utilities: +0.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Nasdaq futures </strong>underperformed after report that the Chinese court ruled in favour of UMC (UMC) in a patent case against Micron (MU), temporarily banning Micron&rsquo;s chip sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*Stock Specifics: </strong>Focus today was more M&amp;A based, as Juniper (JNPR) was among top performers in the SPX as Catalent (CTLT) is to buy the co. for USD 11.50.shr. Elsewhere, Campbell Soup (CPB) were higher following reports which stated Third Point is pushing the co. to explore a sale. At the bottom of the SPX saw Facebook (FB) as one of the underperformers following an expansion of agencies looking into the investigation of data sharing practices related to Cambridge Analytica. Chip names came under pressure late in the trading session as Micron (MU) lost a patent case against UMC in China. Micron shares tumbled almost 7% with Nvidia and Intel dragged lower too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES. </strong>Treasuries were slightly higher and saw moderate bear-steepening with most of the action concentrated in the belly and long end of the curve where yields were lower by c.2bps. 2s5s, 2s10s and 2s30s narrowed by c.3bps but overall action was quiet ahead of the Independence Day holiday on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE:</strong> WTI and Brent crude futures reversed some of the gains seen earlier in the session, which saw WTI above $75 for the first time since 2014, amid no fundamental news though there were rumours on social media noting talk that the US released oil from their vast Strategic Petroleum Reserve as oil prices earlier hit multi-year highs. However, US Energy Secretary Perry recently said that the SPR is for emergencies (like hurricanes) rather than to manipulate oil prices and there was never any confirmation. Separately, there was also talk that the Syncrude plant in Alberta, Canada could be restarting although this is still only a rumour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more likely catalyst for the move lower was regurgitation of earlier news that the Saudi Cabinet said they were ready to use its spare production capacity if it is required. Similarly, UAE&rsquo;s ADNOC said they have the ability to increase oil production by several hundred thousand barrels per day in coordination with OPEC and non-OPEC monitoring committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> API&rsquo;s are at the same time as usually scheduled today, despite early US market closures. This week, analysts expect crude stocks to draw by 3.3mln barrels, gasoline is expected to draw by 1.0mln, stocks of distillates are seen drawing by 600k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CNY-CNH, SEK, GBP: </strong>All deriving support from Central Banks, to varying degrees and not necessarily sustainably, as the Yuan weakened further initially after a significantly lower PBoC midpoint fix before recovering some composure amidst reports of local bank buying via USDCNY forwards. The Chinese CB then offered some verbal assurances that devaluation is not a deliberate policy move, but more a function of USD strength and other external factors. The PBoC reaffirmed its intent to keep the currency stable and at a reasonable level, prompting a further rebound on the offshore unit, though the CNY remained weak on a closing basis. However, the Swedish Krona extended gains after the Riksbank maintained end of 2018 repo rate hike guidance, but with 2 hawkish dissenters calling for tightening at the July meeting, or in September/October. EURSEK has tested support just above 10.3000 vs circa 10.4400 highs. Similar, one of the 3 BoE rate hike voters, Saunders, underlined his case for further policy normalisation, and along with another UK PMI beat (construction this time), Cable rebounded from the low 1.3100 area to sample, but not consume all offers around 1.3200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Another loss of momentum above 95.000 as the Greenback drifted down across the board saw the index retest support ahead of 94.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*AUD, NZD:</strong> AUDUSD is retesting resistance around 0.7400 from fresh ytd lows overnight in wake of disappointing Aussie building approvals data and a still very neutral RBA amidst general Greenback weakness on the aforementioned PBoC-inspired Yuan recovery. The Kiwi is trying to pare recent losses vs the USD like its antipodean peer, but lagged behind also following the latest GDT auction, as the cross flirts with 1.1000 and NZDUSD is capped by offers circa 0.6750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, CAD, MXN, JPY, CHF: </strong>All firmer vs the Dollar, with the single currency rebounding firmly from sub-1.1600 lows yesterday, as Germany&rsquo;s CSU-CDU parties struck a compromise agreement on migration, but encountering some technical headwinds around the 30 DMA (1.1666). The has rallied off 1.3200 lows and Peso is recovering even more lost ground (USDMXN retreating through 20.000) on positive initial exchanges between AMLO and US President Trump plus an advisor to the former suggesting renewed impetus for NAFTA talks. Meanwhile, USDJPY has pulled back further from slightly higher 111.00+ highs towards 110.50, but the Franc remains subdued and more rangebound between 0.9915-50 vs the Dollar amidst a more stable, albeit still volatile risk tone overall.</p>\r\n",

The Chinese CB then offered some verbal assurances that devaluation is not a deliberate policy move, but more a function of Usd strength and other external factors. The PBoC reaffirmed its intent to keep the currency stable and at a reasonable level, prompting a further rebound on the offshore unit, though the Cny remained weak on a closing basis. However, the Swedish Krona extended gains after the Riksbank maintained end of 2018 repo rate hike guidance, but with 2 hawkish dissenters calling for tightening at the July meeting, or in September/October. Eur/Sek has tested support just above 10.3000 vs circa 10.4400 highs. Similar, one of the 3 BoE rate hike voters, Saunders, underlined his case for further policy normalisation, and along with another UK PMI beat (construction this time), Cable rebounded from the low 1.3100 area to sample, but not consume all offers around 1.3200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another loss of momentum above 95.000 as the Greenback drifted down across the board saw the index retest support ahead of 94.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aud/Usd is retesting resistance around 0.7400 from fresh ytd lows overnight in wake of disappointing Aussie building approvals data and a still very neutral RBA amidst general Greenback weakness on the aforementioned PBoC-inspired Yuan recovery. The Kiwi is trying to pare recent losses vs the Usd like its antipodean peer, but lagged behind also following the latest GDT auction, as the cross flirts with 1.1000 and Nzd/Usd is capped by offers circa 0.6750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/MXN/JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All firmer vs the Dollar, with the single currency rebounding firmly from sub-1.1600 lows yesterday, as Germany&rsquo;s CSU-CDU parties struck a compromise agreement on migration, but encountering some technical headwinds around the 30 DMA (1.1666). The has rallied off 1.3200 lows and Peso is recovering even more lost ground (Usd/Mxn retreating through 20.000) on positive initial exchanges between AMLO and US President Trump plus an advisor to the former suggesting renewed impetus for NAFTA talks. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy has pulled back further from slightly higher 111.00+ highs towards 110.50, but the Franc remains subdued and more rangebound between 0.9915-50 vs the Dollar amidst a more stable, albeit still volatile risk tone overall.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) both opened higher with defensive sectors leading the upside in Australia, although sentiment in Tokyo later deteriorated alongside flows into JPY as markets were startled by a continued currency devaluation by the PBoC. Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) was initially negative after PBoC inaction resulted to a CNY 150bln drain from the interbank market, but went positive after the PBoC chief said they are to keep the Yuan basically stable. The Hang Seng (-1.4%) was the worst performer with intraday losses of over 3%, as it reacted to the prior day&rsquo;s declines during its market closure in which the benchmark indices in Japan, mainland China and South Korea all slumped over 2%. In addition, money market rates in Hong Kong continued to surge and China Mobile was another fall-out from the ongoing US-China trade tensions with the Co. slipping after the US Commerce Department and NTIA recommended to deny the telco&rsquo;s licence request to enter the US the market. Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy alongside the flimsy risk sentiment in Japan, but with prices kept within a tight range amid a mixed 10yr auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skips open market operations for a net daily of CNY 150bln. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.6497 (Prev. 6.6157); weakest fix since August 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major state-owned Chinese banks were seen to be exchanging CNY for USD in forwards and then immediately offloading them into the spot market to support the domestic currency, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC Chief said they are to keep the Yuan basically stable and at a reasonable level, they are keeping an eye on recent fluctuations in FX markets and that recent FX market fluctuations are due to a stronger USD and external uncertainties. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Saunders attributes soft Q1 GDP figures to temporary factors and adverse weather conditions. Said a lot of spare capacity in the UK economy has been used up and UK Wage growth is gradually picking up. Rates could rise further than expected by markets. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Interior Minister/CSU leader Seehofer said he&#39;ll stay on in the role and that he has a clear agreement on migration with Chancellor Merkel. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Pompeo is to visit North Korea on Thursday for nuclear discussions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swedish Riksbank Rate unchanged at -0.50% as expected. Riksbank&#39;s repo rate path is unchanged and slow repo rate rises will be initiated towards end of year. Ohlsson advocated for a rate hike, Floden and Ohlsson wanted a higher rate path. The executive board has decided to extend the mandate that facilitates rapid intervention on the foreign exchange market. Floden and Ohlsson had some reservations on this position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity bourses in Europe are higher (Euro Stoxx 50 +1.2%), following on from Wall St. with the risk tone also improved following Germany&rsquo;s CSU/CDU policy agreement over immigration reduces worries of political upheaval in the country. FTSE 100 (+0.3%) underperforms amid a firmer GBP and weight being placed on Glencore (-10%) shares after being subpoena by the DoJ over their operations as of 2007 in Nigeria, DR Congo and Venezuela. UK banking names are also underperforming following FT reports that PPI expenditures could increase by &ldquo;billions&rdquo; after legislation passed overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commerzbank (+2.2%) has reached an agreement with SocGen to sell its Equity &amp; Commodities business (EMC) to them. Terms were undisclosed, however, this division created a revenue of ~ EUR 380mln in 2017.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allianz (+2.9%) are up after the co. has announced a 41.5mln share buyback with a value of up to USD 1.16bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YUAN/KRONA &ndash; Firm rebounds for the Cny and Cnh after further depreciation following another soft fix on a combination of support from Chinese banks and PBoC comments downplaying official devaluation speculation. The onshore unit still closed at multi-month lows vs the Usd, but offshore Yuan managed to reverse earlier losses back above 6.7000. Elsewhere, the Sek has strengthened across the board on hawkish dissent against rate guidance reiterating tightening around the end of 2018, as Floden and Ohlsson both preferred earlier hikes (and registered objections vs extending the direct FX intervention mandate as well). Eur/Sek has retreated to almost 10.3100 levels from close to 10.4400 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; Another mover on Central Bank impulses, as BoE hawk Saunders underscored his stance, but the Pound also supported by another more upbeat than anticipated UK PMI (construction above consensus like manufacturing on Monday). Cable is back near 1.3200 as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - Aud/Usd is retesting resistance around 0.7400 from fresh ytd lows overnight in wake of disappointing Aussie building approvals data and a still very neutral RBA amidst general Greenback weakness on the aforementioned PBoC-inspired Yuan recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - Trying to pare recent losses vs the Usd like its antipodean peer, but the Kiwi lagging behind ahead of the latest GDT auction, as the cross flirts with 1.1000 and Nzd/Usd is capped by offers circa 0.6750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - Firmer vs the Dollar having dipped below 1.1600 yesterday, as Germany&rsquo;s CSU-CDU parties reach a compromise agreement on migration, but now encountering some technical headwinds around the 30 DMA (1.1666).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/MXN - Both benefiting from the latest Usd downturn (DXY back under 95.000 and eyeing support above 94.500 again), with the Loonie rallying off 1.3200 lows and Peso recovering even more lost ground (Usd/Mxn retreating through 20.000) on positive initial exchanges between AMLO and US President Trump plus an advisor to the former suggesting renewed impetus for NAFTA talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Relatively flat, albeit also off worst levels vs the Usd within 110.75-111.15 and 0.9915-50 respective ranges amidst a more stable, though still volatile risk tone overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts consolidating around the 123.00 level after a decent DMO&nbsp;auction that drew stronger demand at a lower rate than the previous 2028 offering and came with a short tail, but still at the lower end of their extended Liffe trading boundaries of 122.90 to 123.23 amidst a broad recovery in risk sentiment. Similarly, Bunds have witnessed some range extension on Eurex and are back down nearer the foot of the 162.22-49 range after failing to clearly breach chart resistance around 162.45 on the earlier bounce. On that note, technical support is seen at the new intraday low, with a clean break exposing 162.04 before 162.00. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are hugging overnight lows in marginal bear-steepening mode ahead the holiday-shortened CBOT session and July 4 full closure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI has broken above yesterday&rsquo;s highs amid a softer USD and ongoing supply disruptions. WTI is currently trading at USD 74.61 and Brent is currently at USD 77.82. In a news thin morning the most significant news came from UAE&rsquo;s ADNOC who said they have the ability to increase oil production by several hundred thousand barrels per day in coordination with OPEC and non-OPEC monitoring committee. This had no effect on oil prices, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTE: API&rsquo;s are at the same time as usually scheduled today, despite early <a href=\"https://www.nyse.com/markets/hours-calendars\">US&nbsp;market closures.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is up 0.2% on the day as a weaker USD leads the yellow metal into positive territory. Copper has rebounded from a seven month low as trade tensions are pushing the construction material higher on supply concerns. Platinum is languishing around a near 10 year low as demand is sliding for the metal on Auto tariff concerns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

FTSE 100 (+0.3%) underperforms amid a firmer GBP and weight being placed on Glencore (-10%) shares after being subpoena by the DoJ over their operations as of 2007 in Nigeria, DR Congo and Venezuela. UK banking names (Standard Life Aberdeen flat, Lloyds flat) are also underperforming following FT reports that PPI expenditures could increase by &ldquo;billions&rdquo; after legislation passed overnight.&nbsp;<br />Commerzbank (+2.2%) has reached an agreement with SocGen to sell its Equity &amp; Commodities business (EMC) to them. Terms were undisclosed, however, this division created a revenue of ~ EUR 380mln in 2017. &nbsp;<br />Allianz (+2.9%) are up after the co. has announced a 41.5mln share buyback with a value of up to USD 1.16bln.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />YUAN/KRONA &ndash; Firm rebounds for the Cny and Cnh after further depreciation following another soft fix on a combination of support from Chinese banks and PBoC comments downplaying official devaluation speculation. The onshore unit still closed at mult-month lows vs the Usd, but offshore Yuan managed to reverse earlier losses back above 6.7000. Elsewhere, the Sek has strengthened across the board on hawkish dissent against rate guidance reiterating tightening around the end of 2018, as Floden and Ohlsson both preferred earlier hikes (and registered objections vs extending the direct FX intervention mandate as well). Eur/Sek has retreated to almost 10.3100 levels from close to 10.4400 at one stage.&nbsp;<br />GBP &ndash; Another mover on Central Bank impulses, as BoE hawk Saunders underscored his stance, but the Pound also supported by another more upbeat than anticipated UK PMI (construction above consensus like manufacturing on Monday). Cable is back near 1.3200 as a result.&nbsp;<br />AUD - Aud/Usd is retesting resistance around 0.7400 from fresh ytd lows overnight in wake of disappointing Aussie building approvals data and a still very neutral RBA amidst general Greenback weakness on the aforementioned PBoC-inspired Yuan recovery.&nbsp;<br />NZD - Trying to pare recent losses vs the Usd like its antipodean peer, but the Kiwi lagging behind ahead of the latest GDT auction, as the cross flirts with 1.1000 and Nzd/Usd is capped by offers circa 0.6750.&nbsp;<br />EUR - Firmer vs the Dollar having dipped below 1.1600 yesterday, as Germany&rsquo;s CSU-CDU parties reach a compromise agreement on migration, but now encountering some technical headwinds around the 30 DMA (1.1666).&nbsp;<br />CAD/MXN - Both benefiting from the latest Usd downturn (DXY back under 95.000 and eyeing support above 94.500 again), with the Loonie rallying off 1.3200 lows and Peso recovering even more lost ground (Usd/Mxn retreating through 20.000) on positive initial exchanges between AMLO and US President Trump plus an advisor to the former suggesting renewed impetus for NAFTA talks.&nbsp;<br />JPY/CHF - Relatively flat, albeit also off worst levels vs the Usd within 110.75-111.15 and 0.9915-50 respective ranges amidst a more stable, though still volatile risk tone overall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FIXED INCOME&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Gilts consolidating around the 123.00 level after a decent DMA auction that drew stronger demand at a lower rate than the previous 2028 offering and came with a short tail, but still at the lower end of their extended Liffe trading boundaries of 122.90 to 123.23 amidst a broad recovery in risk sentiment. Similarly, Bunds have witnessed some range extension on Eurex and are back down nearer the foot of the 162.22-49 range after failing to clearly breach chart resistance around 162.45 on the earlier bounce. On that note, technical support is seen at the new intraday low, with a clean break exposing 162.04 before 162.00. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are hugging overnight lows in marginal bear-steepening mode ahead the holiday-shortened CBOT session and July 4 full closure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />WTI has broken above yesterday&rsquo;s highs amid a softer USD and ongoing supply disruptions. WTI is currently trading at USD 74.61 and Brent is currently at USD 77.82. In a news thin morning the most significant news came from UAE&rsquo;s ADNOC who said they have the ability to increase oil production by several hundred thousand barrels per day in coordination with OPEC and non-OPEC monitoring committee. This had no effect on oil prices, however.&nbsp;<br />Gold is up 0.2% on the day as a weaker USD leads the yellow metal into positive territory. Copper has rebounded from a seven month low as trade tensions are pushing the construction material higher on supply concerns. Platinum is languishing around a near 10 year low as demand is sliding for the metal on Auto tariff concerns. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;NOTE: API&rsquo;s are at the same time as usually scheduled today. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Looking at Liffe in more detail, Gilts kicked off 14 ticks under yesterday&rsquo;s 123.29 settlement price and have meandered between 123.08-23, while Short Sterling futures have been mostly softer, albeit only 1-2 ticks below par following larger gains on Monday, and now attempting a mild bounce amidst FTSE underperformance.</p>\r\n",

An immigration accord between Merkel and Seehofer has allayed fears of a coalition split, while Wall Street&rsquo;s rebound from the lows is also expected to provide some support for EU stocks off the open, as the PBoC plays down Yuan deval speculation after reports of intervention overnight. Ahead, Eurozone PPI and retail sales data scheduled along with a speech by ECB&rsquo;s Praet and the latest weekly QE tallies. Bunds currently at the base of a 162.28-43 range.</p>\r\n",

PM May also commented that they want a future customs relationship with the EU in place by 2020 to make sure a backstop is not necessary and that EEA membership for the UK would not deliver on the vote for Brexit. (Newswires) However, the Times reports that tensions have been running high in PM May&rsquo;s cabinet amid mounting suspicions over a compromise on customs.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remained firm overnight with the greenback holding on to gains against its major counterparts in which EUR/USD and GBP/USD attempted a breakdown of the 1.1600 and 1.3100 handles respectively during US trade. Both pairs later found support at the aforementioned levels, with EUR also briefly underpinned on reports that German Interior Minister Seehofer will stay on in the role after an agreement was reached with Chancellor Merkel. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were choppy with the pair momentarily reclaiming the 111.00 handle to the upside before giving it back as markets were spooked after the PBoC set the weakest fix since August last year. This briefly pushed USD/CNH higher by over 4 points to above 6.7300 and triggered contagion concerns but was then followed by speculated intervention from state-run banks to support the domestic currency. AUD was also indecisive amid poor Building Approvals and the China devaluation, while the RBA rate decision was uneventful as the central bank kept rates unchanged as unanimously expected and mostly reiterated prior comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA kept the Cash Rate unchanged at the record low 1.50% as expected. RBA reiterated that steady policy is consistent with growth and inflation targets and that low level of rates is supporting the economy. RBA also repeated that Inflation is likely to remain subdued for some time and that it expects gradual pick-up in inflation with CPI expected to be a bit a higher than 2% this year.

        "content": "<p>The RBA are expected to maintain the Cash Rate Target at the record low during its latest policy meeting with ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures pricing in 100% probability of no move in rates and while the respective yield curve suggests August 2019 as the earliest date for when expectations are leaning more towards a hike. Furthermore, a recent newswire poll also found that median forecasts for a hike were pushed back to Q3 2019 from a Prev. forecast of Q2 2019 with 20 out of 33 analysts now predicting rates to be unchanged by June next year, while 12 expect a 25bps increase by then and 1 was calling for a 25bps cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expectations for the RBA to remain on hold for a prolonged period are largely due to subdued wage growth and inflation remaining below the central bank&#39;s 2%-3% target band, while ongoing global factors such as trade concerns are also seen as a constraint on the economy and prices. RBA officials have also continued to signal an unwillingness to adjust policy as Governor Lowe repeated that any hike in rates is still some time away and that there is no strong case for near-term move in rates, while RBA&rsquo;s Ellis noted that spare capacity in Australia is keeping rates low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data points since the last meeting has been mixed with GDP growth for Q1 firmer than expected at 3.1% vs. Exp. 2.8% (Prev. 2.4%). Conversely, jobs data has been less encouraging with Employment Change below expectations at 12.0k vs. Exp. 19.0k(Prev. 22.6k, Rev. 18.4k) in which Full-Time workers contracted by 20.6k and although the Unemployment Rate fell to 5.4% vs. Exp. 5.5% (Prev. 5.6%), this coincided with a surprise decline in the Participation Rate. These mixed data releases therefore suggest a lack of urgency for policy tweaks and supports the case for the RBA to maintain its wait-and-see approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RBA rate decision is due Tuesday morning at 0530BST in which focus will also be on the accompanying statement. However, no major fireworks are expected considering the past meetings in which the central bank has mostly kept to its all too familiar rhetoric that it judged steady policy is consistent with targets and that a stronger AUD would slow pick-up in inflation and growth of the economy.</p>\r\n",

In addition, China Mobile is another fall-out from the ongoing US-China trade tensions with the Co. slipping after the US Commerce Department and NTIA recommended to deny the telco&rsquo;s licence request to enter the US the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remains firmer overnight with the greenback holding on to the prior day&rsquo;s gains against its major counterparts which saw EUR/USD and GBP/USD attempt a breakdown of the 1.1600 and 1.3100 handles respectively. Both pairs later found support from the aforementioned levels during US trade, with EUR also briefly underpinned on reports that German Interior Minister Seehofer will stay on in the role after an agreement was reached with Chancellor Merkel. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were choppy with the pair momentarily reclaiming the 111.00 handle to the upside before giving it back after the PBoC set the weakest fix since August last year, which briefly pushed USD/CNH higher by over 4 points and spooked markets on contagion concerns and spurred speculated intervention by state-run banks to support the domestic currency. AUD is also indecisive amid poor Building Approvals and the China devaluation with focus shifting to today&rsquo;s RBA rate decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are choppy alongside the flimsy risk sentiment in Japan, but with prices kept within a tight range as participants also await a 10yr JGB auction later.</p>\r\n",
