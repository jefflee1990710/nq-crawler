        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP – 20 July 2018: Trump worried Fed will hike rates twice this year; Trump threatens to impose tariffs on all China imports",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities down, Treasuries down, crude up, dollar down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: &nbsp;Trump mulled USD 505bln tariffs, Japan Abe warned over protectionism, Fed&rsquo;s Bullard on Trump Fed comments, Brexit chatter.<br />* COMING-UP WEEKEND/NEXT WEEK: G20 meeting over weekend // US Existing Home Sales, EZ &amp; US Manufacturing &amp; Services PMIs (Flash), Australian CPI, GE IFO Survey, US New Home Sales, EU&rsquo;s Juncker visits the US, ECB Interest Decision, US Durable Goods, US GDP (Prelim reading), Earnings from GOOGL, AMZN, FB.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>A White House told CNBC that President Trump is concerned that the Fed may lift rates twice more in 2018; CNBC also reported that aides have been advising Trump that the Fed &lsquo;is doing this right&rsquo;, raising further concerns that Trump is stepping on the independence of the central bank. On Trump&rsquo;s comments made on Thursday regarding the dollar and rates, OMB Director Mulvaney said Trump did not try and influence Fed decisions, though Mulvaney himself wished that the Fed would give attention to the supply-side of the economy. Fed&rsquo;s Bullard (Non-Voter, Dove) said US President Trump can comment on monetary policy but it is up to the Fed to take the best actions to achieve its dual mandate; he added that he was not surprised by the President&rsquo;s comments, and expects Trump to weigh in on Fed policy again, but that does not change Fed&#39;s pursuit of stable inflation and maximum employment. On trade wars, Bullard said an escalating trade war could be risk to the US economy if it goes badly, and repeated his warning that the Fed should hold-off on rate hikes due to risks it could invert the yield curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump on Friday said the US is ready to impose tariffs on all USD 505bln of Chinese import goods, adding that China never had anyone to talk to in the US. Trump continued, saying China, the EU and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower; the ECB itself was asked for a comment , though declined. There are suggestions that Trump will continue in this spirit, despite November&rsquo;s midterm elections; NEC Director Kudlow says Trump will not let go of trade regardless of the November election. Japanese PM Abe on Friday said Japan auto exports post no national security threat to the US, and auto tariffs would be greatly damaging to the world, adding that the G20 will work to avoid US trade restrictions. Meanwhile, Germany&rsquo;s finance minister Scholz was not expecting any progress on trade to be made at the G20. Germany&#39;s Chancellor Merkel said that if need be, the EU is working on counter-measures to Trump&rsquo;s trade measures, but that was the worst case scenario, adding that EU&rsquo;s President Juncker will go to Trump next Tuesday with an auto tariff deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May said the EU must not evolve its Brexit position and the EU must not fall back onto earlier Brexit positions, adding that the legal test for backstop produced by the EU is not acceptable. May also said that the backstop should not be necessary due to the new proposals. Nevertheless, Irish Foreign Minister Covaney does not believe the UK&rsquo;s White Paper will be agreed in full, says it is a basis for a real discussion, but did note that the negotiations will not be easy; however, he did say that the EU will show flexibility. EU&#39;s chief Brexit negotiator Barnier continued on that theme, saying several elements in the UK White Paper open way for constructive talks. Barnier questioned how the EU can &#39;delegate&#39; the collection of tariffs in the UK, and asked if it is it legally feasible, directly attacking a key element of May&rsquo;s White Paper. On the Irish issue, Barnier said all 27 EU members insist on all-weather backstop for the Irish border, and he invited the UK to work on the backstop next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX&nbsp; -0.09% at 2802, NDX -0.03% at 7350, DJI -0.03% at 25058. </strong>SECTORS: Energy: -0.36%, Materials: -0.41%, Industrials: -0.1%, Cons Discretionary: -0.41%, Cons Staples: +0.59%, Health Care: -0.19%, Financials: +0.21%, Tech: +0.09%, Telecoms: -0.47%, Utilities: -0.75%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Microsoft Corp (MSFT) beat on EPS and revenue and its Intelligent Cloud revenue was higher by 23% to USD 9.6bln, and it was ranked the second largest company in the cloud market. Ex-Dow component General Electric (GE) beat on both top and bottom line and traded higher pre-market however gains were erased, and the stock trended lower throughout Friday&rsquo;s session. Honeywell (HON) provided a stellar earnings report and beat on both top and bottom line as well as boosting its sales, segment margin and free cash flow guidance for 2018. Skechers lost over a quarter of their market cap after their same store sales missed expectations at 4.5% (Exp. 5.2%) and reported EPS of 19c, 12c below wall street&rsquo;s expectations; SKX also lowered its Q3 EPS and revenue guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q8, expired) SETTLES $1.00 HIGHER AT $70.46/BBL; WTI (U8) SETTLES 2 CENTS HIGHER AT $68.26/BBL; BRENT SETTLES 49 CENTS HIGHER AT $73.07/BBL. </strong>Trade in crude futures was subdued, judging by the standards of recent sessions, with WTI subject to a bout of &nbsp;book-squaring as the Q8 contract expires. In terms of news flow, Russian Oil Minister Novak said that it can return to oil cuts after 2018 if needed, adding the new OPEC/Russia Organisation may start on 1 January 2019. In Nigeria, exports of Bonny Light are seen at 216k BPD in September, falling to 152k BPD in October. In China, Sinopec was said to slow down buying of US crude as the WTI/Brent arb narrows. In the North Sea, Aker Solutions workers on Equinor&#39;s marine oil platform have voted for a strike involving 200 workers, which will likely take place between early August to early October. This week, Baker Hughes reported that oil drillers cut active rigs by 5, taking it to 858.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 10 TICKS LOWER AT 119-31+. </strong>The yield curve bear-steepened on Friday There was further selling in the complex on reports that Trump was concerned that the Fed would hike twice more in 2018. 30yr yields ending the session higher by c.6bps, whilst the 2yr only higher by c.1bps. Volume was decent across the complex. Yield spreads were wider 2s30s by c.7bps, 2s10s by c.5bps and 5s30s by c.4bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>Literally, all change for the Dollar on a very volatile and hectic Friday in terms of market moves, news and latest exchanges in global tariff wars. In fact, the big turnaround for the Greenback and DXY started late yesterday when US President Trump retrained his sights on the Usd and Fed, bemoaning the strength of the former and rate hikes from the latter, but the final straws came when he accused China (PBoC), the EU (ECB) and others of deliberately weakening their currencies via loose monetary policy to glean a competitive edge vs the US. All this after warning that the White House is ready to roll on taxes on all $505 bn worth of Chinese imports, while German Chancellor Merkel reiterated that the EU is working on counter measures for autos, which could be implemented in the worst event. DXY back below 95.000 having rallied to a fresh 95.656 ytd peak only on Thursday and now in real danger of ending the week with a net loss (circa 94.750 open).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMMODITY FX: </strong>The Loonie heads G10 counterparts after a whippy ride of its own amidst very choppy crude prices, some mixed data and NAFTA reports. However, firmer than forecast Canadian CPI and much stronger than expected retail sales have boosted the Cad towards 1.3100 vs its US rival from nearly 1.3300 at one stage. Similar swings for the antipodean Dollars, with heightened US-China trade tensions and severe YUAN depreciation, bordering on devaluation when both the Cny and Cnh tumbled through 6.8000 (before reports of intervention) weighing heavily on the Aud and Nzd, but then the aforementioned broad Usd reversal boosting the Kiwi a tad more than its neighbour. Aud/Usd back around 0.7400 from the low 0.7300 area at worst and in time for another big expiry at the strike (1.25 bn), Nzd/Usd rebounding to 0.6800 from almost the big figure below at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, JPY, EUR: </strong>The Pound has endured more pressure from Brexit-related political upheaval following the controversial Chequers White Paper that prompted the resignation of prominent UK Cabinet Ministers and saw PM May narrowly scrape through parliament votes that were effectively a test of confidence. However, data also damaged Sterling with sub-forecast CPI and an unexpected drop in retail sales (irrespective of the glorious weather and World Cup) lifting odds on an August BoE rate hike (albeit still seen around 70%). Nevertheless, Cable has benefited from the late Dollar U-turn to reclaim the 1.3100 handle from a new 2018 low around 1.2960, but remains weaker vs the Eur with the cross firmly above 0.8900. Usd/Jpy is back below 112.00 vs 113.00+ peaks on a downturn in overall risk sentiment and sourced reports suggesting the BoJ may looks at various policy adjustments at their next policy meeting, but aimed at sustainability rather than tightening. Meanwhile, the single currency followed general trends and moves inversely vs the Greenback, with mainly losses over the week to a 1.1575 low (key Fib) and then 1.1700+ recovery high, with little in terms of Eurozone specifics to provide independent impetus, and not much seen from the ECB next Thursday,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>The Franc was also hostage or beneficiary of external factors/dynamics for the most part, pivoting around par vs the Usd and rebounding from lows circa 1.1700+ vs the Eur in the absence of any real Swiss impulses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>Ending Friday and the week well off worst levels, albeit again thanks to the Dollar demise as opposed to positives of their own, although the Lira is hoping for some support via the CBRT next Tuesday and a hefty rate hike, unlike the Rand that derived little from the SARB that maintained rates and did not signal more than a willingness to act if 2nd round price pressures boost inflation. Usd/Try under 4.8000 and Usd/Zar just above 13.4200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Monday: US Existing Home Sales. Tuesday: EZ &amp; US Manufacturing &amp; Services PMIs (Flash).

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Literally, all change for the Dollar on a very volatile and hectic Friday in terms of market moves, news and latest exchanges in global tariff wars. In fact, the big turnaround for the Greenback and DXY started late yesterday when US President Trump retrained his sights on the Usd and Fed, bemoaning the strength of the former and rate hikes from the latter, but the final straws came when he accused China (PBoC), the EU (ECB) and others of deliberately weakening their currencies via loose monetary policy to glean a competitive edge vs the US. All this after warning that the White House is ready to roll on taxes on all $505 bn worth of Chinese imports, while German Chancellor Merkel reiterated that the EU is working on counter measures for autos, which could be implemented in the worst event. DXY back below 95.000 having rallied to a fresh 95.656 ytd peak only on Thursday and now in real danger of ending the week with a net loss (circa 94.750 open).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie heads G10 counterparts after a whippy ride of its own amidst very choppy crude prices, some mixed data and NAFTA reports. However, firmer than forecast Canadian CPI and much stronger than expected retail sales have boosted the Cad towards 1.3100 vs its US rival from nearly 1.3300 at one stage. Similar swings for the antipodean Dollars, with heightened US-China trade tensions and severe YUAN depreciation, bordering on devaluation when both the Cny and Cnh tumbled through 6.8000 (before reports of intervention) weighing heavily on the Aud and Nzd, but then the aforementioned broad Usd reversal boosting the Kiwi a tad more than its neighbour. Aud/Usd back around 0.7400 from the low 0.7300 area at worst and in time for another big expiry at the strike (1.25 bn), Nzd/Usd rebounding to 0.6800 from almost the big figure below at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound has endured more pressure from Brexit-related political upheaval following the controversial Chequers White Paper that prompted the resignation of prominent UK Cabinet Ministers and saw PM May narrowly scrape through parliament votes that were effectively a test of confidence. However, data also damaged Sterling with sub-forecast CPI and an unexpected drop in retail sales (irrespective of the glorious weather and World Cup) lifting odds on an August BoE rate hike (albeit still seen around 70%). Nevertheless, Cable has benefited from the late Dollar U-turn to reclaim the 1.3100 handle from a new 2018 low around 1.2960, but remains weaker vs the Eur with the cross firmly above 0.8900. Usd/Jpy is back below 112.00 vs 113.00+ peaks on a downturn in overall risk sentiment and sourced reports suggesting the BoJ may looks at various policy adjustments at their next policy meeting, but aimed at sustainability rather than tightening. Meanwhile, the single currency followed general trends and moves inversely vs the Greenback, with mainly losses over the week to a 1.1575 low (key Fib) and then 1.1700+ recovery high, with little in terms of Eurozone specifics to provide independent impetus, and not much seen from the ECB next Thursday,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc was also hostage or beneficiary of external factors/dynamics for the most part, pivoting around par vs the Usd and rebounding from lows circa 1.1700+ vs the Eur in the absence of any real Swiss impulses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Friday and the week well off worst levels, albeit again thanks to the Dollar demise as opposed to positives of their own, although the Lira is hoping for some support via the CBRT next Tuesday and a hefty rate hike, unlike the Rand that derived little from the SARB that maintained rates and did not signal more than a willingness to act if 2nd round price pressures boost inflation. Usd/Try under 4.8000 and Usd/Zar just above 13.4200.</p>\r\n",

This weighed on US equity futures with selling exacerbated after the Emini S&amp;P and DJIA broke below 2800 and 25000 respectively, while Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) wiped out initial gains in the panic. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+2.0%) and Hang Seng (+0.8%) were also initially downbeat as the currency-related concerns overshadowed the PBoC&rsquo;s recent efforts including this week&rsquo;s CNY 540bln net liquidity injection. However, Chinese stocks were recovered from intraday lows as and moved back into the black amid rumours surrounding modifications on New Asset Management Rules. ASX 200 (+0.3%) remained stable throughout the session. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher with prices supported amid losses in Japanese stocks and the brief market panic, although gains were capped heading into an enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr, 5yr, 10yr &amp; 20yr JGBs which proved to be uneventful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly injection of CNY 540bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 90bln net drain. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7671 (Prev. 6.7066)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese National CPI (Jun) Y/Y 0.7% vs. Exp. 0.8% (Prev. 0.7%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese National CPI Ex. Fresh Food (Jun) Y/Y 0.8% vs. Exp. 0.8% (Prev. 0.7%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese National CPI Ex. Fresh Food &amp; Energy (Jun) Y/Y 0.2% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.3%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump says China never had anyone to talk to in the US. He adds US is ready to impose tariffs on all USD 505bln of Chinese import goods. (CNBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany&#39;s Chancellor Merkel says if need be, the EU is working on counter-measures but this is by far the worst solution, adds EU&#39;s Juncker is to go to the US with an auto tariff deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Tenreyro states &quot;In May and June I thought it was prudent to wait a bit to confirm that the soft patch was due to the weather, and not a sign of something more fundamental going on with demand&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- &quot;The PMIs [activity surveys] on output were positive and confirm in some sense the assessment that we had in our central forecast that the soft patch was snow-related.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The Evening Standard article reads &quot;Her tone suggests she might be ready to join the hawks and raise rates for only the second time in 11 years in a fortnight&rsquo;s&quot; but Tenreyro refused to respond to that statement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Repubblica reported tensions in the Italian administration with Deputy PM&#39;s Salvini and Di Maio clashing with Finance Minister which subsequently triggered speculation over his resignation; this was later denied by Italian Deputy PM Maio. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&#39;s Borghi of the Budget Committee says &quot;sooner or later Italy will leave the Euro&quot;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he is much tougher on Russia than past Presidents and that getting along with Russia is positive, while he added he will be Putin&#39;s worst enemy if relationship doesn&#39;t work out. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Director of National Intelligence said it is possible for North Korea to denuclearize within a year but added that it is unlikely to happen. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities began the session relatively mixed (Eurostoxx 50 +0.6%) with significant underperformance in the Italian FTSE MIB amid political jitters. This comes after the Italian newspaper Repubblica reported tensions in the Italian administration with Deputy PM&#39;s Salvini and Di Maio clashing with Finance Minister Tria (later denied), while Corriere reported hard-line Eurosceptic comments from Italy&rsquo;s Budget Committee head. In stock specific news, Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever (+1.3%) completed the first EUR 3bln tranche of EUR 6bln buyback program, while the second tranche starts as of today. European equities have been dealt a blow in recent trade by comments from Trump that the US is ready to impose tariffs on all USD 505bln of Chinese goods with the DAX (-0.9%) underperforming amid declines in auto names following the recent comments from Merkel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, the reversal has arguably been swifter than the rise for Bunds and Gilts that have both retreated into negative territory and new lows, at 162.95 and 124.01 respectively (-13/-7 ticks vs +31/+19 ticks at one stage). UK debt may have acknowledged larger than expected PSNB shortfalls, but in truth the about turn occurred well before that amidst a recovery in BTPs on more reports from Italy and some conflicting views about what prompted the initial sell-off (could be a rift between Tria and Di Miao rather than Borghi being convinced about Italexit at some stage, but even the former subsequently denied). 10 year EU benchmarks now just below parity, while US Treasuries remain marginally softer near overnight session troughs and the curve a tad steeper into a sparse schedule to end the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Back on the 95.000 handle, just, after the US President turned his attention away from international trade and other issues to the Usd and Fed, lamenting the strength of the former and the hawkishness of the latter. However, the Greenback and index indirectly, are still looking at other factors for direction, and in particular moves in the YUAN that was fixed considerably higher on shore by the PBoC today (circa 4.7600 vs the Usd) and pushed both the Cny and Cnh above 6.8000 before a bounce amidst intervention speculation and reports about local banks selling at 6.8100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD - Not quite heroes from zeroes, but the antipodean Dollars and Loonie have benefited the most from relative silence on the global trade war front (for now at least) and the partial Renminbi revival (as the closest proxies in the reverse situation). The Kiwi has rebounded from close to 0.6700 and above 0.6750, the Aud held just above key chart support (0.7311-27 area that covers the 2018 base and a 61.8% Fib) to stand around 0.7370, but a hefty 1.25 bn option expiry at the 0.7400 strike may cap further upside and the Cad has returned to 1.3250 vs lows yesterday near 1.3300. For the Loonie, Canadian CPI and/or retail sales are likely to provide the main independent drivers ahead of the weekend, though oil prices are still factoring to a degree (higher again today).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CHF/GBP - All marginally firmer vs the Greenback and off psychological/round number levels or fresh ytd lows on the aforementioned Usd fade, with the single currency straddling 1.1650, Jpy pivoting 112.50 having bounced off its 200HMA around 112.25-30, Franc at the upper end of a tight range either side of parity and Cable regaining 1.3000+ status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are mostly in the green on the day with WTI (+0.6%) and Brent (+0.7%) just off highs (at around USD 70.14/bbl and USD 73.36/bbl respectively), albeit both benchmarks are on track to set their third week of losses amid oversupply concerns fused with US-Sino trade tensions. To recap, this week&rsquo;s API and DoE inventories both printed a surprise build in stockpiles, whilst speculation amounts over the potential for an economic slowdown caused by trade tensions which could lower demand in the future. Traders will be looking out for the Baker Hughes rig count later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold trades relatively flat as the USD eases off highs. London copper rose as much as 1% as the red metal pulls away from one-year lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Oil Minister Novak says can return to oil cuts after 2018 if needed; adding the new OPEC Russia Organisation may start on January 1st 2019.

This comes after the Italian newspaper Repubblica reported tensions in the Italian administration with Deputy PM&#39;s Salvini and Di Maio clashing with Finance Minister Tria (later denied), while Corriere reported hard-line Eurosceptic comments from Italy&rsquo;s Budget Committee head. In stock specific news, Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever (+1.3%) completed the first EUR 3bln tranche of EUR 6bln buyback program, while the second tranche starts as of today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Back on the 95.000 handle, just, after the US President turned his attention away from international trade and other issues to the Usd and Fed, lamenting the strength of the former and the hawkishness of the latter. However, the Greenback and index indirectly, are still looking at other factors for direction, and in particular moves in the YUAN that was fixed considerably higher on shore by the PBoC today (circa 4.7600 vs the Usd) and pushed both the Cny and Cnh above 6.8000 before a bounce amidst intervention speculation and reports about local banks selling at 6.8100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD - Not quite heroes from zeroes, but the antipodean Dollars and Loonie have benefited the most from relative silence on the global trade war front (for now at least) and the partial Renminbi revival (as the closest proxies in the reverse situation). The Kiwi has rebounded from close to 0.6700 and above 0.6750, the Aud held just above key chart support (0.7311-27 area that covers the 2018 base and a 61.8% Fib) to stand around 0.7370, but a hefty 1.25 bn option expiry at the 0.7400 strike may cap further upside and the Cad has retuned to 1.3250 vs lows yesterday near 1.3300. For the Loonie, Canadian CPI and/or retail sales are likely to provide the main independent drivers ahead of the weekend, though oil prices are still factoring to a degree (higher again today).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CHF/GBP - All marginally firmer vs the Greenback and off psychological/round number levels or fresh ytd lows on the aforementioned Usd fade, with the single currency straddling 1.1650, Jpy pivoting 112.50 having bounced off its 200HMA around 112.25-30, Franc at the upper end of a tight range either side of parity and Cable regaining 1.3000+ status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, the reversal has arguably been swifter than the rise for Bunds and Gilts that have both retreated into negative territory and new lows, at 162.95 and 124.01 respectively (-13/-7 ticks vs +31/+19 ticks at one stage). UK debt may have acknowledged larger than expected PSNB shortfalls, but in truth the about turn occurred well before that amidst a recovery in BTPs on more reports from Italy and some conflicting views about what prompted the initial sell-off (could be a rift between Tria and Di Miao rather than Borghi being convinced about Italexit at some stage, but even the former subsequently denied). 10 year EU benchmarks now just below parity, while US Treasuries remain marginally softer near overnight session troughs and the curve a tad steeper into a sparse schedule to end the week.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are mostly in the green on the day with WTI (+0.6%) and Brent (+0.7%) just off highs (at around USD 70.14/bbl and USD 73.36/bbl respectively), albeit both benchmarks are on track to set their third week of losses amid oversupply concerns fused with US-Sino trade tensions. To recap, this week&rsquo;s API and DoE inventories both printed a surprise build in stockpiles, whilst speculation amounts over the potential for an economic slowdown caused by trade tensions which could lower demand in the future. Traders will be looking out for the Baker Hughes rig count later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold trades relatively flat as the USD eases off highs. London copper rose as much as 1% as the red metal pulls away from one-year lows.</p>\r\n",

However, the Greenback and index indirectly, are still looking at other factors for direction, and in particular moves in the YUAN that was fixed considerably higher on shore by the PBoC today (circa 4.7600 vs the Usd) and pushed both the Cny and Cnh above 6.8000 before a bounce amidst intervention speculation and reports about local banks selling at 6.8100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not quite heroes from zeroes, but the antipodean Dollars and Loonie have benefited the most from relative silence on the global trade war front (for now at least) and the partial Renminbi revival (as the closest proxies in the reverse situation). The Kiwi has rebounded from close to 0.6700 and above 0.6750, the Aud held just above key chart support (0.7311-27 area that covers the 2018 base and a 61.8% Fib) to stand around 0.7370, but a hefty 1.25 bn option expiry at the 0.7400 strike may cap further upside and the Cad has retuned to 1.3250 vs lows yesterday near 1.3300. For the Loonie, Canadian CPI and/or retail sales are likely to provide the main independent drivers ahead of the weekend, though oil prices are still factoring to a degree (higher again today).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CHF/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All marginally firmer vs the Greenback and off psychological/round number levels or fresh ytd lows on the aforementioned Usd fade, with the single currency straddling 1.1650, Jpy pivoting 112.50 having bounced off its 200HMA around 112.25-30, Franc at the upper end of a tight range either side of parity and Cable regaining 1.3000+ status.</p>\r\n",

In fact, following an initial mark-up to 163.16 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 163.08 close and brief set-back to a 163.09 low, Bunds bounced to 163.31 and closer to the next bullish chart objective around 163.37. The rationale &ndash; underlying demand for safe-haven assets as global trade wars rage on, or at least the threat of reciprocal import tariffs and other protectionist measures raise the stakes for negotiations, ongoing Brexit uncertainty and volatility in Italian markets as the new populist Government continues to pursue more expansive fiscal policies, and relatively dovish ECB guidance going into next week&rsquo;s meeting. More immediately, Eurozone current account data is unlikely to spark much interest/reaction, but any comments from ECB&rsquo;s Coeure could, if aired.</p>\r\n",

This weighed on US equity futures with selling exacerbated after the Emini S&amp;P and DJIA broke below 2800 and 25000 respectively, while Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) aggressively wiped out initial gains in the panic. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (-0.6%) were also downbeat as the currency-related concerns overshadowed the PBoC&rsquo;s recent efforts including this week&rsquo;s CNY 540bln net liquidity injection. However, Chinese stocks were recovered from intraday lows as markets began to calm down, while the ASX 200 (+0.3%) remained stable throughout the session with the index somewhat oblivious to the China-induced turbulence. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher with prices supported amid losses in Japanese stocks and the brief market panic, although gains were capped heading into an enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr, 5yr, 10yr &amp; 20yr JGBs which proved to be uneventful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly injection of CNY 540bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 90bln net drain.

(Guardian) Furthermore, May is to put the nation on a no-deal Brexit footing this summer as she prepares a series of public warnings about the impact of leaving the European Union without agreement. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary Raab faced ridicule on his debut trip to Brussels as Brexit Secretary as the EU flatly rejected PM May&rsquo;s Chequers plan and mocked spelling errors in translations of the document.

(FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, focus centred on the Chinese currency which was heavily pressured after the PBoC devalued the mid-point for a 7th consecutive day and to its weakest since mid-July last year. This pushed USD/CNH higher by as much as 400 pips towards 6.8400, while CNY briefly weakened beyond 6.8000 which was touted as a key level and had in the past spurred China action, although both pairs have since pulled back from intraday highs on profit taking and amid intervention through state-owned banks. AUD was also pressured due to its China exposure but with downside stemmed after the Chinese currency moves later moderated, and other G10 currencies were relatively unchanged although mild flows were seen into safe-haven JPY amid the bout of turmoil. Elsewhere, RBI were also suspected in intervening to support the INR after it fell to a record low against the greenback, while the DXY was flat overnight but back above the 95.00 level after having recovered from Trump&rsquo;s latest rant in which he stated he is not happy about interest rates rising and that a strong USD disadvantages the US.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed with price action mostly range-bound as focus overnight centred on China&rsquo;s currency weakness. As such, WTI crude futures have held on to the gains seen following yesterday&rsquo;s statement from Saudi Arabia which expects a substantial oil stock draw during H2, although upside was capped by resistance at USD 70/bbl. Elsewhere, gold swung between gains and losses as Trump&rsquo;s comments regarding a dislike for higher rates and disadvantages from a stronger USD initially weighed on the greenback and underpinned the precious metal, although the moves were later pared on further damage control efforts by the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norway oil rig workers&#39; strike has ended, according to shipowner group. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he is much tougher on Russia than past Presidents and that getting along with Russia is positive, while he added he will be Putin&#39;s worst enemy if relationship doesn&#39;t work out.

The US also auctioned $13bln of 10-year TIPS in a fairly lacklustre auction, which saw a tail of 1.5bps; cover was softer too, and analysts said that the auction demonstrates that there weren&rsquo;t any significant inflationary fears, else they may have been seen in the auction results. US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 7+ ticks higher at 120-09+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he is not happy about interest rates rising and that a strong USD puts the US at a disadvantage, while he also noted that China&rsquo;s currency is &#39;dropping like a rock&#39;. Trump added that rate hikes might put the US at a disadvantage since European and Japanese policy remains loose but emphasised that these were his own views. (CNBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House spokesperson later said that US President Trump respects the independence of the Fed and that Trump is not interfering with Fed decisions, while the White House also noted that Trump&rsquo;s views are well known and that those comments today are reiterations of long held positions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fitch said the US is on the strong side of AAA and that trade wars not expected to hit its rating.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade choppy with sentiment spooked overnight amid a China currency sell-off after the PBoC set the reference rate to its weakest in over a year. This weighed on US equity futures with selling exacerbated after the Emini S&amp;P and DJIA broke below 2800 and 25000 respectively, while Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) aggressively wiped out initial gains in the panic. Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (-0.5%) are also downbeat as the currency-related concerns overshadowed the PBoC&rsquo;s recent efforts including this week&rsquo;s CNY 540bln net liquidity injection. However, Chinese stocks have moved off intraday lows as markets began to calm down, while the ASX 200 remained stable throughout the session with the index somewhat oblivious to the China-induced turbulence. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, focus was centred on CNH which was heavily pressured after the PBoC devalued the mid-point for a 7th consecutive day and to its weakest since mid-July last year. This pushed USD/CNH higher by as much as 400 pips towards 6.8400, while CNY briefly weakened beyond 6.8000 which was touted as a key level and had in the past spurred China action, although both pairs have since pulled back from intraday highs on profit taking and some expectations of intervention. AUD was also pressured due to its China exposure but with downside stemmed after the Chinese currency moves later moderated, while other G10 currencies are relatively unchanged although there were flows into safe-haven JPY amid the bout of turmoil. Elsewhere, the DXY is flat overnight but back above the 95.00 level after having recovered from Trump&rsquo;s latest rant in which he stated he is not happy about interest rates rising and that a strong USD disadvantages the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices supported amid losses in Japanese stocks and the brief market panic, although gains are capped with participants looking ahead to the enhanced liquidity auction later.</p>\r\n",
