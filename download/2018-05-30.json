(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&#39;s Five Star Movement have called for Savona to withdraw candidacy for Economy Minister to allow a government to be formed, while party leader Di Maio said Savona should be part of M5S-League government but not as Economy Minister. Di Maio also noted that an alternative Economy Minister should try to renegotiate treaties in the EU if the League agrees and that the choice is either a snap election or a political government.

The Emini S&amp;P 500 grinded higher overnight before being boosted at the US cash open and breaking back above the 100dma at 2712, (which was breached to the downside yesterday), and then finding resistance with the familiar 2730 level. Sector wise, energy outperformed following higher oil prices and hawkish OPEC chatter; financials also outperformed, regaining some of yesterday&rsquo;s losses thanks to higher yields and a reduced US concern over Italian politics. On the negative side, utilities and technology underperformed, but still closed green. Of note for financial names, the Federal Reserve and financial regulators unveiled proposals to ease the Volcker Rule. It has tailored the strictest requirements to the top 40 most active prop trading banks, relieving the smaller banks. Banks with under USD 10bln in trading assets would see the adjustments ease hedging, market making and underwriting exemptions. The adjustments also removes the 60 day &ldquo;rebuttable presumption&rdquo; where it considers investments which are held for less than 60 days, are considered a prop trade, and therefore illegal. SPX 1.27% at 2724, NDX +0.72% at 6976, DJI +1.26% at 24668.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries edged lower on Wednesday as equities steadied and oil rebounded amid easing political concerns over in Europe, yet no government has been formed in Italy. Some analysts were noting that volume was elevated across the curve as attention shifted to the September contracts (June contracts expires on 20th June). Most of the action was concentrated on the front end of the curve where 2yr and 5yr yields were higher by c.1bps. Although yields were higher, modest flattening was seen across the yield curve. However, 2s30s and 5s30s narrowed by c.5bps and 2s10s and 5s10s narrowed by c.5bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 20 ticks lower at 120-19+.</p>\r\n",

Later, the M5S called for euro-sceptic economist Savona to withdraw his candidacy as Economy Minister, which if he agreed, would pave way for the formation of a coalition government; 5SM leader Di Maio noted Savona should still be part of a coalition government, but not as Economy Minister, while urging that the alternative Economy Minister would try and renegotiate treaties in the EU. In response, Salvini dismissed the suggestion, saying we cannot swap ministers around. Amid to toing and froing, Italy&rsquo;s President Mattarella and PM-designate Cottarelli met on Wednesday and urged not to rush the situation, and allow time to see if a government can be formed. Mattarella expressed his preference to avoid elections in summer. Salvini also appealed against a July 29th vote, though he wants elections to take place as soon as possible, adding the League will not block rapid political solutions to solve emergencies. M5S leader DI Maio said he would like to see Conte as PM or a new vote, with hopes that his party will be able to form a government alone, whilst the League&rsquo;s Salvini presented Giorgetti as potential PM. Finally, ECB sources reported the ECB sees no need to intervene in the Italian crisis and suggested it does not have the tools or mandate to solve the crisis. M5S leader Di Maio already noted the ECB is reportedly buying fewer Italian bonds than before in its QE programme. Meanwhile, the latest opinion poll by Ipsos showed support for the League up by 8ppts to 25.4%, while support for 5SM was unchanged at 32.6%. Over in Spain, the Spanish opposition was seen close to securing votes necessary to remove current PM Rajoy in Friday&rsquo;s confidence vote, and the PP party said to most likely see a defeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*BANK OF CANADA: As expected, the BOC held rates at 1.25%, though it issued a hawkish statement that raises the spectre of a rate rise in July (the probability of a July hike jumped to around 80% vs 50%). With regards to the statement itself, BOC dropped its previous reference to &ldquo;cautious&rdquo; policy adjustments, and higher rates will be warranted to keep inflation near target. The Bank did say it will take a gradual approach to lifting rates. Elsewhere, it repeated familiar warnings that it has made in recent month, that trade risks are weighing on business investment, while there have been stresses observed in some EM markets. &ldquo;All things considered, the Bank appears to be positioning itself to raise interest rates again later this year, possibly as soon as July, but we still doubt it will follow through,&rdquo; writes Capital Economics, &ldquo;not with the US likely to ratchet up trade tensions by imposing steel tariffs on Canada later this week, and not with financial markets likely to remain on edge ahead of new elections in Italy&rdquo;. Focus tomorrow is on BoC&rsquo;s Leduc due to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*US-SINO TRADE CONFLICT: China announced it will further cut import tariffs for consumer goods, namely clothing, sports apparel, shoes, washing machines, fridges, cosmetics, healthcare and food items from July 1st. China also urged state-owned companies to limit overseas investment risk, according to People&#39;s Daily, as the US prepares to announce measures in June. The WSJ reported China is reportedly seeking to line-up countries against the US. US Trade Advisor Navarro told NPR that last week&#39;s comments by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that the US/China trade war was over was &quot;an unfortunate soundbite&quot;, suggesting that the US remains at (trade) war with China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*GEOPOLITICS: White House Press Secretary Sanders says the US continues to prepare for the 12th June North Korea summit; preparations have been positive so far. US Secretary of State Pompeo told Russia Foreign Minister Lavrov that the US seeks improved ties with Russia. Elsewhere, reports citing the CIA suggest that the US intelligence community believes that North Korea has no intention of giving up its nuclear programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*DATA: US Q1 GDP (second estimate) moderated slightly from 2.3% to 2.2%, though the narrative seems to have changed recently as in the components, whilst inventories fell, intellectual property investment and final sales to domestic buyers rose significantly. Even though growth was revised moderately lower, it is expected to pick up in Q2, to between 3.0% and 3.5%, Capital Economics says. US Advance Goods Trade Balance fell in April to USD 68.2bln from USD 68.3bln as imports largely surpassed exports with most of the fall attributed to a USD 1.6bln drop in the industrial supplies&rsquo; deficit. Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics believe that imports &lsquo;have some way to fall&rsquo; though exports also continue to underperform, weighing further on the trade balance. US ADP National Employment rose in May and came in at 178k, slightly short expectations at 190k. The softer estimate may indicate a softer payroll number for Friday&rsquo;s official NFP estimate, economists said. Pantheon noted that it was unclear whether the weaker estimates were driven by lower labour demand or by insufficient supply of qualified workers. Nonetheless, given that regional reports released in May rebounded strongly, there are good reasons to believe not much has changed in the labour market and even if payrolls were to slip below 200k, the drop would be temporary, as underlying employment trend remains robust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FED BEIGE BOOK: The US economy expanded moderately in late April and beginning of May with few shifts in growth pattern, the latest Beige Book revealed. Manufacturing moved into &#39;higher gear&#39; with more than half of Fed districts reporting a pickup in industrial activity; employment increased at modest-to-moderate rate, prices rose moderately, with the remainder reporting slight or modest increases. And wage increases were modest, with some districts expecting similar employment and wage gains in the coming months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*EQUITIES: SPX 1.27% at 2724, NDX +0.72% at 6976, DJI +1.26% at 24668.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +0.83%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +1.38%, Energy: +3.01%, Financials: +1.82%, Health Care: +1.36%, Industrials: +1.24%, Materials: +1.15%, Telecom: +0.74%, Tech: %, Utilities: +0.69%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Equity futures rebounded from yesterday&rsquo;s sell-off, which many analysts believed to be overdone; UBS noted that S&amp;P500 revenue exposure to Europe and Italy is only about 10% and 1% respectively, so overall the impact of the political woes in Italy to US equities is likely to be minimal. The Emini S&amp;P 500 grinded higher overnight before being boosted at the US cash open and breaking back above the 100dma at 2712, (which was breached to the downside yesterday), and then finding resistance with the familiar 2730 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sector wise, energy outperformed following higher oil prices and hawkish OPEC chatter; financials also outperformed, regaining some of yesterday&rsquo;s losses thanks to higher yields and a reduced US concern over Italian politics. On the negative side, utilities and technology underperformed, but still closed green.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of note for financial names, the Federal Reserve and financial regulators unveiled proposals to ease the Volcker Rule. It has tailored the strictest requirements to the top 40 most active prop trading banks, relieving the smaller banks. Banks with under USD 10bln in trading assets would see the adjustments ease hedging, market making and underwriting exemptions. The adjustments also removes the 60 day &ldquo;rebuttable presumption&rdquo; where it considers investments which are held for less than 60 days, are considered a prop trade, and therefore illegal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stock specific stories: Michael Kors (KORS) weighed on Wednesday following a poor earnings report, where revenue outlook was lowered due to an expected reduction in shipments following higher fuel prices, and also concerns about its Jimmy Choo business putting pressure on EPS in Q2 and Q4 of 2019. However, its EPS and revenue was relatively in line with expectations, but investors focused on the poor outlook which saw the stock fall lower than 12%. Boosting the SPX a few energy names led the index following hefty increases in oil prices, but as a result airline names underperformed on Wednesday trade.&nbsp; Monster Beverages (MNST) an outperformer today following a new USD 500mln share buyback programme. Another notable story today, Dick&rsquo;s Sporting Goods (DKS) had a solid earnings report beating on both the top and bottom end, along with also raising its FY18 guidance which saw the stock hit intraday highs of ~30%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>M&amp;A news today was relatively light, however in late trade Dealreporter stated that China&rsquo;s MOFCOM has halted its review of NXP semiconductors (NXPI) and Qualcomm (QCOM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*CRUDE: WTI settles $1.48 higher at $68.21/bbl; Brent settles $2.11 higher at $77.50/bbl. Crude was on the front foot in pre-markets as safe haven demand eased slightly; additionally, reports that loadings data showed Forties supply was set to fall to an 11-month low added bullish support. The main story of the day, however, was a sources report suggesting that OPEC and Non-OPEC were not yet ready to fully lift supply curbs, and any adjustment to oil output will be gradual, according to a Gulf source; the report also added that no decision has been made yet. Elsewhere, Kazakhstan was reportedly in talks with non-OPEC allies to ease supply curbs; Indonesian oil output was reportedly running around 737k BPD (its 2018 target is 800k BPD). The Iran oil minister asked OPEC the cartel support Iran in its coming struggle with the US sanctions defining them &#39;illegal, unilateral, extraterritorial&#39; and demanded to place the US sanctions topic on the agenda at its next meeting on June 22nd. The UAE minister said Iran&rsquo;s request may be discussed at the June OPEC meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*BRENT-WTI ARB: The widening spread between Brent and WTI prices have been driven higher by the geopolitical risk premium contained in Brent (NOTE: the July contract expires on Thursday), and was around $9 on Wednesday. The widening spread is said to be beneficial for US crude exporters, given the competitive price edge. However, WTI prices are being constrained by supply bottlenecks, as well as an aging infrastructure. PVM points out that there is only one oil terminal in the US that can handle supertankers, while a lack of pipeline capacity in the Permian basin is preventing crude from flowing to the Gulf Coast export hub. Citi&#39;s analysts suggest that the lack of pipeline capacity is causing some oversupply in some producing regions, adding negative drivers to WTI prices, but the Bank doubts that there is truth to reports that Texas pipelines are at or close to their limit. In fact, other reports have suggested that US export capacity is currently around 3.5mln BPD, around 1mln bbls above the current levels of exports, suggesting that there remains room for US exporters to meet additional demand int he short-term, as a result of favourable arbitrage economics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*ENERGY INVENTORIES: After the bell, the API will report energy inventories for the week; the Street looks for crude stocks to draw by 0.5mln bbls, distillates to draw by 1.3mln, and gasoline to draw by 1.4mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FIXED INCOME: US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 20 ticks lower at 120-19+. Treasuries edged lower on Wednesday as equities steadied and oil rebounded amid easing political concerns over in Europe, yet no government has been formed in Italy. Some analysts were noting that volume was elevated across the curve as attention shifted to the September contracts (June contracts expires on 20th June). Most of the action was concentrated on the front end of the curve where 2yr and 5yr yields were higher by c.1bps. Although yields were higher, modest flattening was seen across the yield curve. However, 2s30s and 5s30s narrowed by c.5bps and 2s10s and 5s10s narrowed by c.5bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FOREX: EUR: The single-currency bounced-back on Wednesday, rising by around 1% against the USD, consolidating around 1.1650 in afternoon trade. There hasn&#39;t been any marked shift in the narrative, and some were suggesting that the heavy buying at the European open was simply a short-squeeze. (With regards to Italian BTPs, some desks were talking about profit-taking on shorts, given that we have dropped so quickly). In fact, one desk noted that given Bund/BTP spreads, the &#39;fair value&#39; of EURUSD is around 1.10. There was attention on a Goldman Sachs note, where the bank said it sees EURUSD around 1.15 over the next three-months, and cut it&#39;s 12-month forecast to 1.25 from 1.30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY, CHF, XAU: Rising rates and a more constructive risk tone helped the USD to advance against haven FX, with USDJPY consolidating just beneath the 109 figure. The Swissy, however, remained bid against the USD though was down against the EUR, while gold managed to keep its head above $1300. Some desks prefer fading EURCHF rallies around 1.1530 given the lingering political risks in the Eurozone. But with that said, traders are wary of the risks of going long Swiss given the SNB&#39;s history of intervention in FX.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD: A double-whammy of bullish pressures helped CAD outperform. USDCAD was straddling 1.30 ahead of the BOC meeting, and following a hawkish hold, USDCAD dropped to successfully test the 1.29 handle, and consolidated beneath the figure until an OPEC sources report lifted crude, buoying CAD further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD: The Kiwi has flown to the top of the G10 pile and stretched its lead over the AUD in the process as the cross hovers just above 1.0800. A broad upturn in risk appetite and sentiment after the extreme aversion prompted by latest Italian political developments has helped the NZD to rebound over 0.6950 vs the USD and retest offers/resistance ahead of 0.7000, while AUDUSD has struggled to clear 0.7550 convincingly amidst more US-China trade barbs and bartering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMFX: The softer dollar and more constructive risk tone helped the complex bounce. MXN&#39;s gains were more muted however, amid continuing uncertainty around NAFTA as well as the upcoming Mexican elections on 1 July; higher US rates were also cited as holding back the peso&#39;s gains. Elsewhere, the Banxico&rsquo;s inflation report kept growth forecasts unchanged, adding that it saw inflation falling in 2018 to close to 3%, while also talking about the familiar risks faced by the Mexican economy. Despite a wider budget deficit, the ZAR gained over 1% vs the USD, with greenback weakness being cited, as well as higher commodity prices &ndash; RUB also gained on commodity prices. TRY&#39;s ascendancy continues, and there was further upside against the dollar on Wednesday after the Turkish central bank said it will continue the use of all available instruments to achieve price stability, and added that a tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained and if needed further tightening will be delivered. The BRL was weaker against the USD, however, after Q1 GDP data only grew modestly and below consensus expectations; analysts warn of a cloudy outlook ahead. Additionally, news that Brazil&#39;s Petrobras will raise gasoline prices weighed.</p>\r\n",

The main story of the day, however, was a sources report suggesting that OPEC and Non-OPEC were not yet ready to fully lift supply curbs, and any adjustment to oil output will be gradual, according to a Gulf source; the report also added that no decision has been made yet. Elsewhere, Kazakhstan was reportedly in talks with non-OPEC allies to ease supply curbs; Indonesian oil output was reportedly running around 737k BPD (its 2018 target is 800k BPD). The Iran oil minister asked OPEC the cartel support Iran in its coming struggle with the US sanctions defining them &#39;illegal, unilateral, extraterritorial&#39; and demanded to place the US sanctions topic on the agenda at its next meeting on June 22nd. The UAE minister said Iran&rsquo;s request may be discussed at the June OPEC meeting.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>BRENT-WTI ARB: </strong>The widening spread between Brent and WTI prices have been driven higher by the geopolitical risk premium contained in Brent (NOTE: the July contract expires on Thursday), and was around $9 on Wednesday. The widening spread is said to be beneficial for US crude exporters, given the competitive price edge. However, WTI prices are being constrained by supply bottlenecks, as well as and aging infrastructure. PVM points out that there is only one oil terminal in the US that can handle supertankers, while a lack of pipeline capacity in the Permian basin is preventing crude from flowing to the Gulf Coast export hub. Citi&#39;s analysts suggest that the lack of pipeline capacity is causing some oversupply in some producing regions, adding negative drivers to WTI prices, but the Bank doubts that there is truth to reports that Texas pipelines are at or close to their limit. In fact, other reports have suggested that US export capacity is currently around 3.5mln BPD, around 1mln bbls above the current levels of exports, suggesting that there remains room for US exporters to meet additional demand int he short-term, as a result of favourable arbitrage economics.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>ENERGY INVENTORIES:</strong> After the bell, the API will report energy inventories for the week; the Street looks for crude stocks to draw by 1.8mln bbls, distillates to draw by 1.1mln, and gasoline to draw by 1.2mln.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

A broad upturn in risk appetite and sentiment after the extreme aversion prompted by latest Italian political developments has helped the Nzd to rebound over 0.6950 vs the Usd and retest offers/resistance ahead of 0.7000, while Aud/Usd has struggled to clear 0.7550 convincingly amidst more US-China trade barbs and bartering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firmer for the most part and gathering strength temporarily post-Canadian data that was arguably better or not as bad as US releases at the same time, but the Loonie really took off and traded through 1.2900 vs its US counterpart on the back of a hawkish hold from the BoC. In short, the cautious caveat on monetary policy was removed from the accompanying statement and the economic outlook upgraded to warrant tightening in order that inflation remains close to target. Note, option break-evens on the event indicated a 90 pip move, and this was surpassed on balance as Usd/Cad was nearer 1.3000 pre-BoC. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Off best levels, but holding the bulk of its recovery gains vs the Greenback around 1.1610 on less angst regarding the situation in Rome and after contrasting Eurozone vs US data (former mostly stronger than expected and latter vice-versa). However, the heat now turns up on Spain&rsquo;s PM Rajoy who appears resigned to losing a vote of no confidence in Madrid and this could spark a fresh bout of market mayhem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both holding gains vs the Dollar after some volatile price action and little fresh in terms of UK or Swiss specific drivers &ndash; Cable approaching 1.3300 and briefly above the big figure, Usd/Chf easing below 0.9900 and Eur/Chf sub-1.1500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rangebound vs the Usd between 108.35-109.00, and mainly towards the upper end after climbing from overnight lows alongside a broad shift in tone from risk-off to back on again, albeit partially/selectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decent recovery gains across the board, as the DXY eased back further from Tuesday&rsquo;s 95.030 ytd peaks and hawkish CBRT minutes gave the TRY more momentum.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.6%) were both negative with declines led by financials following hefty losses in the sector stateside which dropped over 3% amid a slump in yields, although losses in Australia were stemmed by gains in defensive stocks. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-1.8%) and Hang Seng (-1.5%) underperformed on prospects of trade tariffs which outweighed another consecutive firm liquidity effort by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded higher and above the 151.00 level as yields tracked the downside in their US and most European counterparts, aside from Italian government bonds which tumbled on the political disarray and dampened rate hike probabilities for both the ECB and Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China stated the US announcement of plans to proceed with tariffs is contrary to previous consensus and stated it is capable of protecting its own interests no matter what the US does.

This is after ANSA reported that Cottarelli was considering giving up the mandate, allowing for a possible election on July 29th, but a source close to Mattarella later stated there was no mention of this and that he asked for more time to name a cabinet. Comments from the populists also transpired, with calls for early elections and the backing of Giorgetti for PM by the League and Conte by 5SM. Both parties also reiterated the intention to form a government but have emphasized the likelihood of a snap election.

Conversely, Gilts are back on an even keel and recently retested Liffe peaks and the Short Sterling strip has flipped to mildly positive territory on little obvious in the way of UK or independent impetus, but Brexit uncertainty still a factor. Back to Italy, and the looming month end issuance is an obvious near term supply driver, but aside from the clear concession (notwithstanding the retreat in yields), index and redemption dynamics could entice investors and offset some of the ongoing political rationale that may put off buyers.</p>\r\n",

However, Italy&rsquo;s political situation remains up in the air after no progress on an interim Government and heightened prospects of another election within the next few months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, safe-havens like the JPY and CHF retain a firm underlying bid (circa 0.9900 and sub-109.00 vs the Greenback and sub-1.1500/126.00 vs the Eur respectively) despite more verbal intervention from the SNB (Jordan reiterating the need for NIRP and direct intervention given fragile currency markets).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD the next best G10 performers, or rebounders from recent lows to be more precise, as the antipodeans revisit 0.6900+ and 0.7500+ levels vs the Usd respectively amidst a general improvement in risk sentiment, which has offset data misses overnight (in the form of NZ and Aussie building permits).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD both largely side-lined, but also unwinding some losses with Cable back over 1.3250 and the Loonie firming towards 1.3000 ahead of the BoC policy meeting and a raft of Canadian data in the run up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solid Swedish GDP data has underpinned the Krona and nudged Eur/Sek down through 10.3000.</p>\r\n",

The catalyst for the marked pull-back in safe-haven debt is mainly BTP-related as futures consolidate recovery gains and yields ease back from extreme highs posted yesterday, but Bunds will also be taking note of a strong regional inflation report from Saxony. Back to the UK, 3 month STIRs are holding up well in the face of heavy reversals in Eurodollar futures with declines along the strip contained to 2 ticks, thus far. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The initial mark-up defied bearish leads from US Treasuries and less stress in Italian bonds after Tuesday&rsquo;s meltdown even though the political scene is arguably less clear following no agreement on an interim Government between the President and proposed caretaker PM. Bunds may have paid some heed to much stronger than forecast German retail sales, but upcoming state and national CPI data is likely to impact much more if outside consensus. Also ahead, the latest unemployment report and pan Eurozone sentiment indices before the focus switches back to Italy for end of month BTP issuance.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, the PBoC continued to weaken the fix and EM currencies extended on losses with PHP the notable underperformer as it neared a 12-year low against the greenback. Antipodeans also languished with AUD/USD below 0.7500 while NZD/USD struggled to reclaim the 0.6900 handle for most the session following disappointing Building Approvals data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SNB&rsquo;s Chairman Jordan said monetary policy of negative interest rates and FX intervention takes into account market fragility, while he also added that developments in recent days show the situation of the currency market does remain fragile.

The 2s10s spread flattened to narrows last seen in 2007, while 2s5s fell 3bps; that said, there was some widening observed in 5s30s which, at settlement, was around 5bps wider. Given the political concerns in Europe, there was much focus on ECB rate pricing, and unsurprisingly, the buying of the curve pushed implied probabilities of rate hikes further out, with the first rate hike not fully priced until the latter part of next year. There was a similar reaction in Fed pricing, with the odds of a rate hike easing to around 75% (from around 97% at the beginning of May). US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 44 ticks higher at 121-07+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Discount Rate Minutes stated that 12 banks supported keeping discount rate steady ahead of the last Fed meeting.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade lower across the board on spill-over selling from Wall St, with global market sentiment daunted by political uncertainty in Europe and on trade concerns after reports the US plans to proceed with tech tariffs and investment restrictions on China. ASX 200 (-0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.8%) are both negative with declines led by financials following hefty losses in the sector stateside which dropped over 3% amid a slump in yields, although losses in Australia have been stemmed by gains in defensive stocks. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-2.1%) and Hang Seng (-1.7%) are also similarly pressured on prospects of trade tariffs which outweighed another consecutive firm liquidity effort by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, JPY holds on to the gains amid the widespread risk averse tone with USD/JPY and JPY-crosses within ongoing downward channels which began last week, while the USD also remains firm on safe-haven bids and with EUR/USD stuck around 10-month lows near the 1.1500 level amid the ongoing European political uncertainty. Furthermore, the PBoC continued to weaken the fix and EM currencies extended on losses with PHP notably underperforming as it nears a 12-year low against the greenback. Antipodeans also languish with AUD/USD below 0.7500 and NZD/USD struggling to gain a footing on the 0.6900 handle following disappointing Building Approvals data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs trade higher and above 151.00 as yields track the downside in their US counterparts triggered by political disarray, which dampened rate hike probabilities for both the ECB and Fed.</p>\r\n",
