Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) EPS was 4c higher than analyst expectations and revenues fell slightly short. Illumina&rsquo;s (ILMN) figures beat on both ends and raised its FY18 EPS forecast well above expectations. IPG Photonics underperformed the SPX today after it missed on both EPS &amp; revenue, and forecasted its Q3 EPS beneath street expectations. Qualcomm (QCOM) started their tender offer to purchase up to $10bln of its shares which is scheduled to expire midnight on August 27th 2018. The modified Dutch auction tender offer will be offered at a price no less than $60 and no more than $67.50. Chipotle (CMG) announced they have closed on of its stores in Ohio following numerous customer illness complaints, however CNBC reported during market hours that it has reopened. SPX +0.5% at 2816, NDX +0.5% at 7322, DJI +0.4% at 25414.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the BOJ took a dovish approach, the US Treasury curve resumed its flattening, albeit modest, with 2s10s coming in by around 2bps ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s Fed meeting (no fireworks expected), and 5s30s flattened by the same amount. Ultimately, however, Treasuries have continued in their summer lull, and after the BoJ dust settled, were rangebound. There was some upside to yields on reports that China and the US were seeking to resume trade talks. US 10YR T-notes settled 1+ ticks higher at 119-13+.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP - 31 July 2018: US-China seeking to resume trade talks",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities, Treasuries, crude, dollar.<br />* REAR-VIEW: US/china seeking restart of trade talks, US/Mexico near deal on autos; Core PCE misses, Q2 employment costs misses, US consumer confidence beat, Chicago PMI beat.<br />* COMING-UP: FOMC; ADP employment; DOE inventories; ISM manufacturing, Markit manufacturing, BCB, Treasury Quarterly Refunding announcement. Apple earnings aftermarket on Tuesday.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The US and China are reportedly to restart trade talks in an effort to defuse tensions and avoid an all out trade war, Bloomberg reported, citing sources. Representatives of Treasury&rsquo;s Mnuchin and China&rsquo;s Vice Premier Liu are said to be holding private discussions as they seek ways to reengage in negotiations. No timetable has been set, and negotiations to resolve the dispute have stalled for weeks with both sides refusing to budge; talks were said to have broken down after Trump imposed $34bln of tariffs on Chinese imports in July, which China says will void any commitments they have made during negotiations. The article also notes that high-level talks in the Trump administration are set to take place this week to discuss the US &ldquo;trade posture&rdquo; towards China. Later in the day, CNBC reported that the next $16bln of China tariffs are likely to be delay beyond this week, sources said; while the WSJ reported that US-China trade talks said to show little progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>Reports&nbsp;continue to circulate that the US is side-lining Canada in trade talks, with the Canadians receiving no response to their request to take part in bilateral US/Mexico talks on Thursday. The US is said to want concessions from Canada before it agrees to further talks. Elsewhere, there were suggestions that the US and Mexico are nearing a deal on autos, and Mexico President-elect AMLO believes an agreement on NAFTA renegotiation can be reached within the coming days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US PCE, PERSONAL INCOME, SPENDING: </strong>Core PCE rose at a clip of 1.9% YY in June, short of the expected 2.0%, while the prior was revised down from 2.0% to 1.9%. The FOMC&rsquo;s June projections have pencilled in a core PCE rate of 2.0% in 2018. Analysts at Oxford Economics said &ldquo;with inflation likely to show resilience around the Fed&rsquo;s 2% target, we expect a total of four rate hikes in 2018.&rdquo; Meanwhile, personal income (0.4% vs est 0.4%) and consumption (0.4% vs est 0.4%) were &ldquo;consistent with a solid 4.0% rebound in consumer spending growth in Q2 after a lacklustre 0.5% advance in Q1,&rdquo; Oxford Economics says, and it believes that the 4% annual rate is an unsustainable pace of spending, and looks for some cooling in the second half of the year. This in turn should lead overall GDP growth to moderate towards 2.5% in H2.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US EMPLOYMENT COSTS</strong>: Employment costs missed expectations at 0.6% in Q2 (Est. 0.7%), while wages rose 0.5% in Q2, falling from the 0.9% pace in Q1. Pantheon Macroeconomics points out, however, that private sector wages rose at a clip of 2.9% YY, the quickest pace since late 2008, and up from the 2.6% in Q2 2017. &ldquo;The rate of acceleration is modest, but the upward trend is real, and most policymakers won&#39;t want to see numbers much in excess of 3% unless they see real evidence of a sustainable pick-up in productivity growth,&rdquo; Pantheon wrote, &ldquo;for now, the headline is that the rate of increase of labour costs is no threat to inflation. But that won&#39;t stop the Fed hiking in both Sep and Dec.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: </strong>The Street was expecting a fall to 126, but the index rose to 127.4 from a prior (revised higher) 127.1). Encouragingly, the differential between the jobs plentiful and jobs hard to get metrics also rose by 3 points to 28.1. The present situation sub-index was the main driver of the headline, after a 4.8 point rise in the month. Expectations edged lower, slightly, though some analysts notes that it remains at elevated levels. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CHICAGO PMI: </strong>The Chicago PMI was expected to slip slightly in July, but rose more than the most optimistic analyst forecast, with the index coming in at 65.5, the highest since January. &ldquo;Movements in the Chicago PMI usually track swings in orders for Boeing aircraft - the company&#39;s HQ is in Chicago - but it has deviated in recent months, undershooting after the first announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and now overshooting in the past couple of months,&rdquo; Pantheon Macroeconomics said, and the consultancy now expects a modest dip in the next couple of reports, &ldquo;but the headline will remain over 60, unless the administration imposes some/all of the $200B-worth of extra tariffs now under discussion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADA GDP: </strong>Surprised to the upside in May, printing 0.5% MM versus an expected 0.4%, bouncing back from April&rsquo;s weather-induced weakness. CIBC said the Canadian economy is on track for around 3% quarterly growth, after today&rsquo;s data, which would be the first above-trend quarter since last Spring. &ldquo;Note that Governor Poloz was already banking on a strong Q2 real GDP gain as a justification for the July rate hike. Hence, today&rsquo;s news only slightly increases the odds for a September move, since we won&rsquo;t have any picture for Q3 at that point,&rdquo; CIBC wrote, adding &ldquo;while we had earlier expected the Bank of Canada to wait until 2018 due to adverse developments in Canada-US trade relations, the US seems to be engaged again on the NAFTA front (albeit with Mexico for now) and its pledge to exempt Europe from auto tariffs while it engages in talks with the EU could easily be extended to its NAFTA partners. As a result, we&rsquo;re moving up the timetable for the next hike to October, but see the BoC on hold after that until 2019.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK Foreign Minister Hunt warned that the likelihood of a no deal is increasing by the day, according to the Evening Standard, but stressed it would be an economic tragedy for the continent, and called on Germany and France to engineer a sensible Brexit. Irish PM Varadkar, meanwhile, said a no-deal Brexit was very unlikely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.5% at 2816, NDX +0.5% at 7322, DJI +0.4% at 25414. </strong>SECTORS: Energy: -0.3%, Materials: +0.9%, Industrials: +2.1%, Consumer Discretionary: +0.4%, Cons Staples: +0.4%, Health Care: +1.0%, Financials: -0.7%, Tech: +0.3%, Telecoms: -0.8%, Utilities: +1.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Pfizer hit over a 16 year high after beating on revenues and EPS, the pharmaceutical giant also raised its&nbsp; FY18 adjusted EPS forecast by 5c, however it lowered its revenue forecasts for the same period by $500mln. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) EPS was 4c higher than analyst expectations and revenues fell slightly short. Illumina&rsquo;s (ILMN) figures beat on both ends and raised its FY18 EPS forecast well above expectations. IPG Photonics underperformed the SPX today after it missed on both EPS &amp; revenue, and forecasted its Q3 EPS beneath street expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Qualcomm (QCOM) started their tender offer to purchase up to $10bln of its shares which is scheduled to expire midnight on August 27th 2018. The modified Dutch auction tender offer will be offered at a price no less than $60 and no more than $67.50. Chipotle (CMG) announced they have closed on of its stores in Ohio following numerous customer illness complaints, however CNBC reported during market hours that it has reopened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (U8) SETTLES $1.37 LOWER AT $68.76/BBL; BRENT (U8) SETTLES 72C LOWER AT $74.25/BBL. </strong>Oil was lower, with traders citing Monday&rsquo;s dovish overtures from US President Trump, who stated that he was prepared to talk to Iranian leader without preconditions in an attempt to thrash out a new deal that might see a solution to the tensions, rather than reimpose sanctions on the nation. Iran, however, does not seem to want to bite, and its leader Rouhani on Tuesday said the US exit from the JCPOA was illegal, and called on Europeans to salvage the deal. Iran said that US President Trump is mistaken if he thinks that Saudi etc can cover losses in Iranian oil output, and oil prices will move higher unless US grants waivers to purchasers of Iranian crude. Yemeni Houthis were also said to offer to back-off its recent attacks against tankers in the Red Sea, if a coalition les by Saudi Arabia were to halt strikes on Houthis. The latest EIA data for May stated that US crude oil production fell 30k BPD to 1.442mln from 10.472mln BPD, and US crude exports for the same period increased to 2.005mln BPD from 1.756mln BPD in April, and that total US oil demand rose 318k BPD, a 1.6% increase, to 20.357mln BPD. Elsewhere, US dollar strength was said to be weighing on the crude complex in afternoon trade, ahead of inventory data to be released by the API after market. This week, the Street expects headline crude stocks at -3.2mln, distillates +200k, gasoline -1.5mln. Meanwhile, the most recent oil price survey by Reuters finds that analysts see Brent averaging $72.87/bbl in 2018 (prev $72.58) and is expected to fall to an average of $72.20 in 2019 (prev $71.59); WTI is seen averaging $67.32/bbl in 2018 (prev $66.79), and is seen falling to $66.60 in 2019 (prev $66.08).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE 1+ TICKS HIGHER AT 119-13+. </strong>After the BOJ took a dovish approach, the US Treasury curve resumed its flattening, albeit modest, with 2s10s coming in by around 2bps ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s Fed meeting (no fireworks expected), and 5s30s flattened by the same amount. Ultimately, however, Treasuries have continued in their summer lull, and after the BOJ dust settled, were rangebound. There was some upside to yields on reports that China and the US were seeking to resume trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The buck pared back earlier losses, and trades slightly positive heading into the APAC session. A generally constructive run of data does little to shift the narrative that the FOMC will continue lifting rates in a gradual manner, and the dollar also had some support form SOMA redemptions, which Nordea said would be USD positive given the net liquidity impact of around -$24bln; however, month-end FX rebalancing models from major banks all seemed to point to USD selling, which offset the usual positive upside that negative liquidity impacts tend to have. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The BOJ&rsquo;s decision has, on net, been interpreted as dovish, with the Bank pledging to keep rates low as it aims to lift inflation (CPI forecasts were also cut); the tolerance the Bank has towards 10-year yields rising above their previous 11bps line in the sand is being seen as a tweak that allows flexibility, and allows banks to improve their NIMs, so the few analysts who have suggested it represents tightening are being dismissed by the price action; this is in spite of the BOJ also reducing the eligible pool to which its negative rates are applied to. At the end of the day, the result was USDJPY rising sharply to within a whisker of 112.00, though could not breach that level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Canadian dollar fought off the USD forces to finish stronger after a decent GDP report. Positive trade sentiment also helped, with traders content to eventually look-through reports suggesting that the Canadians were being side lined in NAFTA talks due to US perceptions that they are unwilling to make concessions. The Loonie consolidates sub-1.30 as we head into APAC trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP - FOMC RATE DECISION: </strong>The FOMC will likely hold the fed funds rate target between 1.75-2.00%, no economic projections or post-meeting press conference with Chair Powell will leave focus on the statement. There are risks that the FOMC could issue a statement on the Fed&rsquo;s independence, following the recent critique of high rates by US President Trump, which might be interpreted in a hawkish manner. Rate decision and statement to be published at 1400 EST/1900 BST on 1 August 2018. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19736/download\">Click here to read full preview</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP - TREASURY REFUNDING: </strong>The US Treasury will on Wednesday announce details of its quarterly refunding, where it is expected to raise the sizes of auction amounts across the curve. Wells Fargo&rsquo;s analysts expect 2-year and 3-year auctions sizes to be raised by USD 1bln for the next three months, and says that we could also see 5-year, 7-year, 10-year and 30-year auction sizes subject to a one-time USD1bln increase. If Wells&rsquo; projections are accurate, it would mean that the US Treasury&rsquo;s net issuance for the second half of the year would be around USD 695bln (USD 555bln in coupon notes and bonds, USD 140bln in bills) &ndash; this would represent a 20% increase in relative net issuance in the first half of the year, Wells Fargo says, driven by growing deficits and rising Fed Treasury redemptions. &ldquo;If our projected across the board increases are realized, we think the market reaction will be fairly muted. However, 2s/10s conceivably could steepen a lot if Treasury increases the 10y auction size by $2 billion. Similarly, 10s/30s should steepen if the 10y and 30y auctions both are upsized by $2 billion,&rdquo; the Bank writes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP - BCB:</strong> Brazil&#39;s Selic rate is expected to be kept at 6.50% on 1 August. Analysts note that recent inflation expectations remain well anchored, and the price impact from the trucker&#39;s strike seem to be fading. &quot;The board will likely reinforce the message that it continues to closely monitor the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations,&quot; Barclays writes.</p>\r\n",

Apples Q2 earnings report stated that they saw over 20% growth in China and Japan, and they expected to complete its previously announced $210bln share repurchase programme during Q3. WSJ report analysts expect the average selling price of iPhones to be $694 and expect service revenue at $9.2bln, with some noting a benefit from games such as Fortnite. Analysts expect Q4 guidance to be in the range of $55.87bln to $63.11bln and they expect FY18 estimates for EPS to be $11.46, and $261.5bln for revenues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR:</strong> Due to the US-China trade wars any commentary on the trade wars will be important and to see the effect it has had on the tech giant as many of its suppliers are in China, and the majority of its revenues stem from the US. Also, it was recently reported that Apple&rsquo;s products such as its Watch, AirPods and HomePods may be hurt with a 10% import duty in the US under the latest Trump tariffs. Following the new $100bln share repurchase programme which was announced last quarter, any figures and timing related to this will be of use, as well as any updates on the iPhone X as last quarter it was the bestselling iPhone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple are to launch three new iPhones in September, which include a larger iPhone X, and a more affordable version with a lower cost LCD display. The release may result in customers waiting for the release before purchasing new iPhones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* REMINDER: </strong>Apple (AAPL) make up 5.1% of the Dow Jones&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the rack all day, but ending July with heavier losses against the Greenback et al as hawkish BoJ speculation/fears were allayed by the insertion of very dovish forward guidance on rates and an effective admission that reaching the 2% inflation mandate cannot be achieved within a given timeframe. Moreover, the policy tweaks came with the caveat of more easing if necessary and Governor Kuroda underlined flexibility around the new 10 year JGB yield target (+/- 10 bp either side of 0%) to allow for market volatility, adding that the move is not a signal of higher rates. Usd/Jpy encountered some resistance around 111.50, but eventually cleared a cluster of technical levels&nbsp; to hit fresh peaks around 111.95 and eyeing offers at 112.00 next. Note also, a 1 bn option expiry at that strike and Jpy crosses also extended further to the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stark contrast, booming Australian building approvals boosted the Aud and the antipodean Dollar got a further lift from reports that US and Chinese officials are looking to restart trade talks in an effort to avert a full-scale war or escalation of tariff tensions. Consequently, Aud/Usd looks more comfortable above 0.7400 and just above 0.7410-25 option expiries (1 bn) vs the Kiwi that is struggling to keep its head above 0.6800 vs the Usd and 1.0900 against the Aud following weak business confidence and expectations overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much better than expected Chicago PMI and US consumer confidence helped the broad Dollar and index rebound firmly from worst levels (DXY sub-94.200 at one stage), while trumping a raft of earlier releases that were relatively close to consensus anyway (PCE metrics and ECI). However, bearish month end positioning for portfolio rebalancing were also offset by a US bank model flagging less strong signals and SOMA-related flows may have compounded the Greenback recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP/CAD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All ending a choppy EU session narrowly mixed vs the Usd, with the single currency retreating towards 1.1700 in time for hefty NY cut expiries between the big figure and 1.1720 (1 bn) after topping out just ahead of 1.1750 yet again (multi-top formation), but also undermined by the aforementioned SOMA dynamic. Similarly, Cable lost momentum near recent peaks around 1.3050-70 after Pound-supportive month end positioning waned and the usual Eur/Gbp cross demand kept that pair at 0.8900+ levels. Meanwhile, the Loonie rallied through 1.3000 vs its US counterpart on the back of strong Canadian GDP, PPI and raw material prices, but only briefly as ongoing NAFTA issues and another retreat in oil prices continued to weigh (not to mention the late Usd revival).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More downside for the Lira through 4.9000 vs the Usd as US-Turkish relations remained strained and the CBRT inflation report highlighted growing upside inflation risks with marked upgrades to 2018 and 2019 CPI projections. However, the Yuan recovered a chunk of its recent 6.8000+ losses vs the Dollar after the latest US-China headlines.</p>\r\n",

Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB outperforms its peers as Leonardo (+8.8%) lifted the index after a guidance upgrade, local banks are also supporting the Italian benchmark. Sector-wise, Energy names are fuelled amid oil giant BP (+0.8%) reporting strong numbers, while Financials are boosted by optimistic earnings from Credit Suisse (+1.2%) in-turn lifting its peers with Deutsche Bank (+2.0%), SocGen (+1.3%) Commerzbank (+0.8%), UBS (+1.0%) all higher in sympathy. Looking ahead, FTSE 100 giant Shire are to report around mid-day, while major auto-producing countries are meeting in Geneva today to discuss US Auto tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY - Flanking the G10 spectrum into month end, with the Aud boosted by much stronger than expected Aussie building approvals overnight and forming a firmer foothold above 0.7400 vs the Usd, but possibly hampered by hefty option expiry interest between 0.7410-25. Conversely, the Jpy is underperforming after the BoJ policy meeting and more flexible or technical changes to its QE framework rather than any real hawkish shift, not to mention the addition of very dovish rate guidance. Hence, Usd/Jpy is back over 111.00 and testing 111.50+ close to 10 and 21 DMA convergence around 111.47 plus a Fib at 111.51, while Japanese exporters were reportedly on the offer from 111.30-50 for month end. Note, however, Aud/Jpy has rallied through 82.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR - Both extending gains vs the Greenback as the DXY dips towards recent 94.200 lows, with Cable up over 1.3150 again and absorbing the first offers said to be sitting between 1.3150-70, while the single currency is consolidating its recovery above 1.1700 with little net reaction to mixed Eurozone data (flash inflation prints all higher than anticipated vs softer prelim growth), but perhaps some expiry-related flow to contend with given 1bn options running off from 1.1700-20 later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD - Also bucking the firmer overall trend and down vs their US peer, albeit not as weak as the Jpy. The Loonie has been undermined by Canada&rsquo;s exclusion from high level NAFTA talks between the US and Mexico, although off worst levels approaching 1.3100 and back near the middle of a 1.3020-95 range ahead of a raft of data, including May GDP, June PPI and raw materials prices. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is still hovering above the 0.6800 handle, but not helped by a deterioration in NZ business sentiment or activity outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - Although the Dollar has benefited from yet another bout of Yuan weakness on fixed and free-floating grounds, &lsquo;strong&rsquo; sell signals from end of July portfolio rebalancing models are still weighing overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have both retreated further from early peaks to stand just off fresh Eurex and Liffe lows of 161.50 and 122.54 respectively. The former has responded to mostly better than expected Eurozone data to considerably whittle away gains to just 7 ticks from 62 ticks at one stage, while the latter has recoiled in sympathy to sit just 6 ticks above parity vs +38 ticks at best, with reports about a major fund maintaining a short position perhaps also weighing. However, the marked downturn is also indicative of the overall bear-steepening trend in core bonds and attention switching to the rest of this week&rsquo;s major events, like the Fed, BoE and NFP. Indeed, US Treasuries have also handed back a chunk of their advances, although still firm, and probably reflecting on much bigger borrowing projections too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.5%) and Brent (-0.6%) prices are ebbing lower in early European trade with oil prices set for their biggest monthly loss in 2 years. News flow remains light for the complex while Iranian President Rouhani continues to defend the nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;rights&rdquo; to export oil. Meanwhile, spot gold (-0.2%) prices are relatively uneventful in recent trade while the DXY remains rangebound ahead of a few key risk events this week. Elsewhere, Shanghai rebar steel posted its best month in eight amid output curbs in China tightening supply.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>AUD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flanking the G10 spectrum into month end, with the Aud boosted by much stronger than expected Aussie building approvals overnight and forming a firmer foothold above 0.7400 vs the Usd, but possibly hampered by hefty option expiry interest between 0.7410-25. Conversely, the Jpy is underperforming after the BoJ policy meeting and more flexible or technical changes to its QE framework rather than any real hawkish shift, not to mention the addition of very dovish rate guidance. Hence, Usd/Jpy is back over 111.00 and testing 111.50+ close to 10 and 21 DMA convergence around 111.47 plus a Fib at 111.51, while Japanese exporters were reportedly on the offer from 111.30-50 for month end. Note, however, Aud/Jpy has rallied through 82.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both extending gains vs the Greenback as the DXY dips towards recent 94.200 lows, with Cable up over 1.3150 again and absorbing the first offers said to be sitting between 1.3150-70, while the single currency is consolidating its recovery above 1.1700 with little net reaction to mixed Eurozone data (flash inflation prints all higher than anticipated vs softer prelim growth), but perhaps some expiry-related flow to contend with given 1bn options running off from 1.1700-20 later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also bucking the firmer overall trend and down vs their US peer, albeit not as weak as the Jpy. The Loonie has been undermined by Canada&rsquo;s exclusion from high level NAFTA talks between the US and Mexico, although off worst levels approaching 1.3100 and back near the middle of a 1.3020-95 range ahead of a raft of data, including May GDP, June PPI and raw materials prices. Meanwhile, the Kiwi is still hovering above the 0.6800 handle, but not helped by a deterioration in NZ business sentiment or activity outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Dollar has benefited from yet another bout of Yuan weakness on fixed and free-floating grounds, &lsquo;strong&rsquo; sell signals from end of July portfolio rebalancing models are still weighing overall.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp.

The BoJ said the decision on asset purchases was unanimous and decision on YCC was made by 7-2 vote with Kataoka and Harada the dissenters, while it added it will permit upward and downward moves in 10yr yields but will buy JGBs promptly in the event of a rapid increase in yields. Furthermore, the BoJ adjusted its ETF allocation to include more TOPIX inclusion and lowered the balance of reserves for which NIRP is applied.

Data releases were the main catalyst for antipodeans with AUD/USD underpinned by better than expected Building Approvals data and with NZD/USD less inspired after a further deterioration in Business Confidence data. Elsewhere, CAD weakened on news that Canada was rejected from high level NAFTA talks between US and Mexico, while USD/JPY was choppy around the 111.00 handle on uncertainty heading into one of the most anticipated and highly-rumoured BoJ policy announcements in almost 2 years, but then saw late support after the BoJ decision proved to be less hawkish than some had feared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Building Approvals (Jun) M/M 6.4% vs. Exp. 1.0% (Prev. -3.2%).

Selling action today was being attributed to expectations that the BOJ would adjust its yield curve control parameters, with speculation that the BOJ might raise the target, or widen its tolerance band. Elsewhere, of note, the US Treasury sold 3-month paper at 2% on Monday, the highest since June 2008. Later, the US Treasury announced its quarterly financing estimates, where it estimates it will borrow $329bln in the Jul-Sep quarter (raising its estimate from $273bln), and estimates $769bln in net borrowing in H2 2018.

ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are mixed with Australia just about kept afloat amid outperformance in telecoms and gains in commodity-related sectors, while the Japanese benchmark is weighed alongside widespread uncertainty and varied speculation regarding potential BoJ policy tweaks. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) also conform to the downbeat tone after the PBoC skipped repo operations for an 8th consecutive occasion and after Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI missed expectations in which the latter fell to its weakest in nearly a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, major currencies are varied amid a non-committal tone ahead of the key risk events with the DXY trading flat and its major counterparts across the bond also kept range-bound with EUR/USD holding onto the recently reclaimed 1.1700 handle. Data releases were the main catalyst for antipodeans with AUD/USD underpinned by better than expected Building Approvals data and with NZD/USD less inspired after a further deterioration in Business Confidence data. Elsewhere, CAD weakened on news that Canada was rejected from high level NAFTA talks between US and Mexico, while USD/JPY is choppy around the 111.00 handle on uncertainty heading into one of the most anticipated and highly-rumoured BoJ policy announcements in almost 2 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were choppy and initially began on the back-foot as yields continued to gain, although 10yr JGBs then returned flat with all focus on the upcoming BoJ.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Preview: BoJ policy decision due later with speculation rife regarding discussions for a potential policy tweak",
        "content": "<p>The Bank of Japan will conclude its latest 2-day policy meeting on Tuesday which is likely to be more eventful than recent meetings, considering there are mixed views on what the central bank may amid reports of possible policy tweaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent sources articles have suggested that the BoJ will discuss potential policy changes on the basis of sustainability, not tightening, which could result to an adjustment of the yield curve target to allow a long-term natural rise. This is said to be due to the central bank likely to concede that it may take even longer to hit the 2% price target, and therefore would need to ensure its policy measures can be sustained, while a policy tweak could also help alleviate some of the side-effects from its prolonged ultraloose policy which has squeezed banks&#39; profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports also noted the central bank could discuss how to make its JPY 6tln ETF buying program more sustainable and may review the allocation of ETF purchases including considering purchasing more ETFs linked to TOPIX and less ETFs associated with Nikkei indices, which would likely spur investors to follow suit in rebalancing their portfolios should this materialize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, many are far from convinced regarding a hawkish tweak, considering that inflation remains far from the 2% target and with BoJ Governor Kuroda denying any knowledge of the aforementioned reports. Furthermore, several BoJ watchers view the central bank as unlikely to tighten monetary policy before October, despite all the speculation, while some have even suggested further easing could be on the table to support inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, some sources familiar with the central bank&#39;s thinking expect the BoJ to maintain the outline of current policy, but have reported that officials are examining small tweaks to its 10-year yield target of 0%, and could signal it would permit long-term rates to move more flexibly. However, this is seen by some as somewhat far-fetched given the central bank&#39;s recent actions, in which it announced fixed-rate buying operations twice last week and on Monday, for an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at 0.11% in an attempt to cap gains in long-term yields and keep them near the 0% target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BoJ will also release its Outlook Report consisting of board members&#39; median forecasts for real GDP and core CPI; reports suggest that the BoJ will likely miss its inflation target for another three years, and accordingly, may reduce its inflation forecasts to around 1.0% from 1.3% for FY18 and to 1.5% from 1.8% for FY19. This follows softer than expected headline national CPI for June at 0.7% versus expectations of 0.8% (and unchanged from from May) and although Tokyo CPI for July was more encouraging at Y/Y 0.9% versus the consensus 0.7% (and prior 0.6%), it still remained below the halfway point to the BoJ&rsquo;s price goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, there is no exact scheduled time for the policy announcement which tends to be any time after the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0330BST/2130CDT/1030HKT. Focus will be on if there are any hawkish policy tweaks which would likely strengthen JPY and weigh on sentiment, as it would be the first ever tightening shift to the BoJ&rsquo;s ultra-loose policy which was instigated over 5 years ago and the first tweak to Yield Curve Control since it was introduced in September 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, JPY is likely to weaken if the BoJ refrains from policy tweaks, or is deemed less hawkish than some anticipate (for instance, if it kept policy unchanged but merely cut its inflation profile) as this would ease some of the tightening fears and lead to an unwinding of the recent flows which has pushed the 10yr yield to above 0.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previous Outlook Report</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real GDP<br />- Fiscal 2018 forecast at 1.6%.<br />- Fiscal 2019 forecast at 0.8%.<br />- Fiscal 2020 forecast at 0.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core CPI<br />- Fiscal 2018 forecast at 1.3%.<br />- Fiscal 2019 forecast at 1.8% (excluding effects of sales tax hike)<br />- Fiscal 2020 forecast at 1.8% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent Comment and Calls<br />- Goldman Sachs expects BoJ to maintain policy settings and cut core CPI forecasts, while it also sees BoJ asserting additional easing is unnecessary and that momentum in prices is being sustained. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs thinks policy adjustments would be challenging due to subdued inflation and state the BoJ are unlikely to come to a definitive conclusion in regards to policy tweaks.<br />- MUFJ Morgan Stanley expects the BoJ to maintain policy at the upcoming meeting, but states that action in the October meeting is a possibility in which the BoJ could adjust the long-term yield target to between -0.1% and +0.2%.</p>\r\n",
