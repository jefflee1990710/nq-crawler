        "content": "<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he wants China to do well and that President Xi is a friend, although he also commented that China is not able to give the US a deal which is acceptable.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Pompeo is reportedly set to announce the formation of an &#39;Iran action group&#39; on Thursday, while he also commented that the US hopes to one day soon reach an agreement with Iran. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump stated that Turkey has not turned out to be a great friend, while US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin commented that more sanctions are prepared for Turkey if Pastor Brunson is not released. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkish Foreign Minister said he does not wish to have issues with the US and that problems can be solved but not with the current approach, while a Turkish Presidential Spokesman said they have taken the necessary measures in the financial market to shield it vs. a speculative attack and they are not having an economic war with anyone. Elsewhere, Turkish Finance Minister Albayrak said capital controls will never be in their agenda and that they have no IMF plan. Albayrak also commented that focus is on attracting FDI and that they will emerge out of this volatility stronger. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said he is hopeful of a breakthrough in NAFTA negotiations in the next few days and that US President Trump has said it is okay if there is not a breakthrough. In related news, there were also comments from Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guarjardo that Mexico is still working towards a NAFTA deal with US and that all partners must show some flexibility in talks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Housing Starts Number Jul 1.168M vs. Exp. 1.26M (Prev. 1.173M, Rev. 1.158M). (Newswires)<br />US Building Permits Number Jul 1.311M vs. Exp. 1.31M (Prev. 1.292M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A positive risk tone helped some of this week&rsquo;s battered stocks rise on Thursday, with equity futures boosted by the announcement that US and China delegations are to meet to discuss trade later in the month. However, during hours President Trump said that China is not able to give the US a deal which is acceptable, which slightly soured sentiment, resulting in small pivot for the futures to the downside. Today&rsquo;s performance was helped along by the continuing easing tensions with regards to Turkey (and EM in general, as the CNH strengthened against the USD), while metals prices were also on the rise today, following the prior day&rsquo;s slump. The Mini Dow outperformed following strong earnings from Walmart (WMT); however, the BUY initiation on Boeing (BA) from UBS saw the stock reach intraday highs of ~4%, provided an even larger boost to the DJI than WMT earnings. Elsewhere, Cisco (CSCO) beat on both top and bottom lines and also provided Q1 forecasts slightly above Wall St expectations. China&rsquo;s JD.com (JD) reported earnings also which resulted in a very volatile share price, as the name opened heavily in the red but the losses were erased which extended to some of the largest intraday gains in the Nasdaq 100 at one stage. However, this surge then unwound throughout the remainder of the session, where the stock finished back in the red, where it started. SPX +0.79% at 2840, NDX +0.27% at 7374, DJI +1.58% at 25559.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex took its cue from a more constructive risk backdrop, with signs that the US is moving to ease trade tensions with China. Yields didn&rsquo;t move too much, however, Treasuries found some buyers after a weak Philly Fed survey. But with that said, the bias was towards modestly higher yields, although major curve spreads saw another round of modest flattening. US 10-year T-notes settled 5+ ticks lower at 120-08+.</p>\r\n",

Geopolitical analysts Stratfor said that &ldquo;although these talks will not occur at the highest level, they could still lead to progress in negotiations on trade between China and the US.&rdquo; However, Trump&rsquo;s comments later in the day that China is not able to give the US a trade deal which is acceptable cooled the optimism slightly, though some traders noted that this might be characteristic of Trump&rsquo;s &lsquo;carrot-andstick&rsquo; approach. Earlier in the session, US NEC Director Kudlow reassured investors on Thursday that the are no downside risks to a trade dispute, as the US economy is growing; Kudlow also said the US is making great headway in Europe trade talks and progress is also being made with Mexico. He, however, said him and Trump are dissatisfied with Turkey &ndash; which Trump reiterated later in the day, saying that the nation had not turned out to be a great friend. Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo said Mexico is still working towards a deal with the US and required all partners to show some flexibility in talks. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* TURKEY: </strong>During a conference call with investors on Thursday, Turkish Finance Minister Albayrak once again expressed confidence that the country will remerge stronger from the current currency crisis and that the current domestic challenges are fully understood recognised. He also noted banks are healthy as there has not been any major deposit flow lately and added that the Turkish Central Bank reserves are more than USD 90bln. In terms of policy measures, he made clear that &nbsp;capital controls will never be in their agenda, that they have no IMF plans, and their focus is on attracting FDI. Albayrak urged a coherent, credible medium term programme to fight inflation, noting monetary policy is not enough, as he wants to see a single digit figure as early as possible. He expressed the need for a prudent fiscal &nbsp;trajectory and said we will see fiscal tightening. He then went on to &nbsp;say additional sources of funding will be announced in a couple of weeks and that he expects a more modest growth rate. The Lira has put in a third consecutive session of gains against the USD, shrugging-off comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, who said more sanctions are prepared for Turkey if Pastor Brunson is not released. Elsewhere, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister said that they are thinking about counter measures against the US sanctions imposed on Russian companies over North Korea. Kremlin also reported that Russian President Putin may take part in a 3-way summit with the Iranian and Turkish leaders in September. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* PHILLY FED </strong>surprised markets on Thursday with the Index figure sliding from 22 to 11.9, the lowest level since November 2016. This sentiment was consistent across the sub-indexes&nbsp;<br />where new orders crashed to a 23-month low, shipments, delivery times, unfilled orders, work-week and employment all came in lower too. One cannot help but suggest that uncertainty over Chinese import tariffs is a factor restraining progress for the Index respondents, analysts at Pantheon Economics suggest. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* BUILDING PERMITS </strong>were in line with expectations at 1.31mln, and housing starts came in at 1.168mln missing expectations of 1.26mln; the biggest drop came from the West where wild fires have engulfed the region, analysts at Oxford Economics said, though this is likely to be temporary and a rebound can be expected in the coming months as builder confidence remains strong. OxEco cautioned that rising cost pressures and tightening in the labour market could slow momentum. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* JOBLESS CLAIMS</strong> came in at 212K, marginally missing the 215K consensus. This holds with the narrative of strong Q2 growth in the US as claims continue to fall, analysts at Pantheon Economics said. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* SPX +0.79% at 2840, NDX +0.27% at 7374, DJI +1.58% at 25559.</strong> SECTORS: Energy +0.77%, Materials +0.64%, Industrials +1.15% Cons Discretionary +0.57%, Cons &nbsp;Staples +2.00%, Healthcare +0.89%, Financials +1.19%, Tech +0.06%, Telecoms +1.91%, Utilities +1.18%.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* FUTURES:</strong> A positive risk tone helped some of this week&rsquo;s battered stocks rise on Thursday, with equity futures boosted by the announcement that US and China delegations are to meet to discuss trade later in the month. However, during hours President Trump said that China is not able to give the US a deal which is acceptable, which slightly soured sentiment, resulting in small pivot for the futures to the downside. Today&rsquo;s performance was helped along by the continuing easing tensions with regards to Turkey (and EM in general, as the CNH strengthened against the USD), while metals prices were also on the rise today, following the prior day&rsquo;s slump. The Mini Dow outperformed following strong earnings from Walmart (WMT); however, the BUY initiation on Boeing (BA) from UBS saw the stock reach intraday highs of ~4%, provided an even larger boost to the DJI than WMT earnings.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Walmart (WMT) announced its quarterly figures today marking the unofficial end of earnings season, its Adj. EPS beat by 7c and revenues came in over USD 2bln higher than expected and it raised its FY19 adj EPS forecasts. Cisco (CSCO) beat on both top and bottom lines and also provided Q1 forecasts slightly above Wall St expectations. China&rsquo;s JD.com (JD) reported earnings also which resulted in a very volatile share price, as the name opened heavily in the red but the losses were erased which extended to some of the largest&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;intraday gains in the Nasdaq 100 at one stage. However, this surge then unwound throughout the remainder of the session, where the stock finished back in the red, where it started.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Fox&rsquo;s Gasparino reported Tesla&rsquo;s (TSLA) legal team is bracing for billions of dollars in potential liability from private lawsuits over the tweets from Elon Musk, which may total more than any SEC action. &nbsp;Chipotle (CMG) was hit after a Ohio Health District said 674 people reported gastrointestinal symptoms after eating at the Ohio restaurant. NOTE: On August 3rd Daytona Daily News reported there were reportedly 683 illnesses after people ate at its Ohio restaurant. Symantec (SYMC) were one of the outperformers as activist investors, Starboard Value, built a position in the co. and nominated five members to its board of 11 directors, according to people familiar with the matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* HEALTHCARE:</strong> US President Trump continued his opioid attack saying he wants a federal lawsuit against opioid makers, and Teva (TEVA) received FDA approval for a generic version of Mylan&rsquo;s (MYL) EpiPen.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* WTI (U8) FUTURES SETTLE 45C HIGHER AT USD 65.46, BRENT (V8) FUTURES SETTLE 67C HIGHER AT USD 71.43. &nbsp;</strong><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* US 10-YEAR T-NOTES SETTLED 5+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-08+.</strong> The Treasury complex took its cue from a more constructive risk backdrop, with signs that the US is moving to ease trade tensions with China. Yields didn&rsquo;t move too much, however, Treasuries found some buyers after a weak Philly Fed survey. But with that said, the bias was towards modestly higher yields, although major curve spreads saw another round of modest flattening. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* TRY, CNH:</strong> The TRY has stretched its &lsquo;winning&rsquo; run to three straight sessions after the Finance Minister&rsquo;s investor conference call stressed no capital controls or plans to tap the IMF, and envisages more FDI along the lines of Qatar&rsquo;s $15bln to be announced in the next fortnight or so. As a result, the Lira rebounded further to break through the 5.7000 level to the downside against the USD, however the cross changed course and traded north of 5.80 at time of writing. While the CNH also recovered more lost ground vs the Greenback towards 6.8690 from close to 6.9500 on confirmation that a Chinese trade delegation will visit Washington by the end of August, albeit not involving &lsquo;high&rsquo; level personnel from either side.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* USD:</strong> Lower across the board amidst the improving risk sentiment and not helped by US data/surveys, especially a dire Philly Fed manufacturing index and components. Hence, the DXY pulled back further from new YTD highs of 96.991 registered on Wednesday to just above 96.300.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* AUD, NZD, EUR: </strong>All vying for top G10 spot as the antipodean Dollars regained most lost ground on the general shift from aversion to renewed risk appetite that spread from EMs in reverse to the flow of contagion of late. However, heavy option expiry interest kept AUDUSD below 0.7300 (1bln at the strike), while the Kiwi struggled to get too far beyond&nbsp;<br />0.6600 before paring back and heading into Asia-Pac below the level. Attention now turns to for the former, as the RBA Governor&rsquo;s semi-annual speech in Parliament takes place on Friday. Elsewhere, the single currency continued its rebound from fresh 2018 lows around 1.1301 to just over 1.1400 briefly, before falling beneath the figure.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* GBP:</strong> Another net gainer vs the USD, with some underlying traction from better than expected UK retail sales, but more upside following the NY cut for option expiries when a big $1.7bln 1.2700 strike rolled off. Indeed, Cable rallied just over 1.2750 to trip a few stops, and the GBP was also very close to another major option expiry vs the EUR at 0.8950 ($1bln).&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* JPY, &nbsp;CAD:</strong> Ending Thursday&rsquo;s US session pretty flat vs their US counterpart, with USDJPY remaining constrained within a 110.45-90 range and supported by the base of a chart cloud plus Tokyo buying interest from 110.37 through 110.40-50, but also wary about 1.7bln expiries between 110.50-60. The Loonie meandered from 1.3110-70 with little reaction to Canadian manufacturing sales or ADP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Lira/Yuan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Try looks all set to stretch its &lsquo;winning&rsquo; run to 3 sessions in a row after the Finance Minister&rsquo;s investor conference call stressed no capital controls or plans to tap the IMF and more FDI along the lines of Qatar&rsquo;s $15 bn to be announced in the next fortnight or so. The Lira has rebounded further to circa 5.7000 vs the Usd as a result, while the Cnh also recovered more lost ground vs the Greenback towards 6.8690 from close to 6.9500 on confirmation that a Chinese trade delegation will visit Washington by the end of August, albeit not involving &lsquo;high&rsquo; level personnel from either side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lower across the board amidst the improving risk sentiment and not helped by US data/surveys, especially a dire Philly Fed manufacturing index and components. Hence, the DXY pulled back further from new ytd highs of 96.991 registered on Wednesday to just above 96.300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All vying for top G10 spot as the antipodean Dollars regained most lost ground on the general shift from aversion to renewed risk appetite that spread from EMs in reverse to the flow of contagion of late. However, heavy option expiry interest kept Aud/Usd below 0.7300 (1 bn at the strike), while the Kiwi struggled to get too far beyond 0.6600, with attention for the former now turning to the RBA Governor&rsquo;s semi-annual speech in Parliament on Friday. Elsewhere, the single currency continued its rebound from fresh 2018 lows around 1.1301 to just over 1.1400, but not a lot further again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another net gainer vs the Usd, with some underlying traction from better than expected UK retail sales, but more upside following the NY cut for option expiries when a big 1.7 bn 1.2700 strike rolled off. Indeed, Cable rallied just over 1.2750 to trip a few stops, and the Gbp was also very close to another major option expiry vs the Eur at 0.8950 (1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Thursday&rsquo;s EU session pretty flat vs their US counterpart, with Usd/Jpy remaining constrained within a 110.45-90 range and supported by the base of a chart cloud plus Tokyo buying interest from 110.37 through 110.40-50, but also wary about 1.7 bn expiries between 110.50-60. The Franc stayed in 0.9915-45 confines and Loonie meandered from 1.3110-65 with little reaction to Canadian manufacturing sales or ADP.</p>\r\n",

However, sentiment then improved and some of the regional majors nearly pared all their losses after reconciliation hopes were spurred by news that China&rsquo;s Vice Commerce Minister is to visit US for trade discussions later this month. Finally, 10yr JGBs head into the European morning flat although price action was choppy overnight alongside the tumultuous tone in riskier assets, while today&rsquo;s 5yr auction failed to spur demand as the b/c and accepted prices declined from prior.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Vice Commerce Minister Wang is to visit US for trade discussions later this month.

        "content": "<p>The Norges Bank are set to hold their latest interest rate decision on Thursday, with analysts unanimously expecting an unchanged base-rate at 0.50% on August 16th, and all those polled expecting a 25BPS hike in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norwegian figures have been almost entirely in line with Central Bank expectations over the summer, with employment growing at the forecast rate (3M/3M 0.5%) and core inflation rebounding after running below forecast in Q2 to 1.4% and in line with June calculations. Whilst this is below the Norges Bank&#39;s 2% target, the Bank believes it will to return to target slowly. Alongside this, the spot oil price is down 3% since the previous meeting, but ING highlights that the metric used by the Central Bank for calculations, ie the futures curve is &ldquo;roughly unchanged, as the oil curve has flattened over the past couple of months&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain key figures for Norway have been on the weaker side (i.e. Manufacturing PMI 49.3 vs. Exp. 56.6 &amp; Retail Sales -2.9% vs. Exp. 0.3%), however analysts at Nordea expect this to be judged as &ldquo;temporary noise&rdquo; due to the summer (i.e. Manufacturing PMI&rsquo;s <50 due to the low response rate off the back of summer holidays). Analysts at Danske Bank point to the Business tendency survey, which showed an increase to 9.2 in Q2 (the highest since Q4 2010) as justification for these data point misses as transitory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TWI for the NOK has been essentially flat over the summer, whilst the Norges Bank expected this to gradually appreciate. Analysts at ING note that while this could result in tighter policy from the NB, &ldquo;the krone&#39;s struggles are mainly down to the negative risk environment that prevails in markets&rdquo; and as such do not expect the Central Bank to be overly concerned with short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering all the above, ING and Danske Bank expect little or no change to the NB stance outlined at the June meeting when the &lsquo;current assessment of the outlook and balance of risks suggests that the key policy rate will most likely be raised in September 2018&rsquo;, alongside &ldquo;the intention to keep hiking rates roughly twice a year, with the next hike expected in March 2018&rdquo;. The only change expected from both banks is a mention of recent sentiment-souring through the Turkish &amp; Russian financial turmoil and the increased US-Sino trade spat.</p>\r\n",

(Telegraph)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Spanish government is said to be considering corporate tax hike along with Podemos. (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>FX</strong>&nbsp;<br />FX markets were mostly driven by the same factors that spurred risk sentiment with the greenback and safe-haven JPY both initially firmer against their major counterparts due to the risk averse tone at the open and amid a further deterioration in the CNY. However, an improvement in risk sentiment following the announcement of the first trade discussions between US-China in 2 months then provided support for the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts in which EUR/USD broke above resistance at 1.1350 and GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.2700 handle. Elsewhere, antipodeans were also spurred by the trade discussion news which helped AUD/USD shrug off the indecision from mixed jobs data, while the optimism helped CNY also nurse some of its recent losses which strengthened past 6.9000 against USD.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Australian Employment Change (Jul) -3.9k vs. Exp. 15.0k (Prev. 50.9k).

As such, WTI crude futures have just about reclaimed the USD 65.00/bbl level but still have far to go to make any meaningful recovery from yesterday&rsquo;s 3% declines which was triggered by a surprise build in stockpiles, as well as the several commodity-bearish conditions including a stronger greenback and risk averse tone. Elsewhere, gold extended on its declines and briefly approached USD 1160.00/oz to the downside and copper tested the prior day&rsquo;s lows before recovering on the US-China trade news.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong>&nbsp;<br />White House stated that retaliatory tariffs from Turkey are regrettable and a step in the wrong direction and that US steel tariffs on Turkey would not be removed if Pastor Brunson is released but would consider removing sanctions. Elsewhere, US VP Pence warned Turkey would do well not to test Trump&#39;s resolve, while there were also comments from Turkish Foreign Minister that Turkey is willing to discuss issues with the US without threats. (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>US</strong>&nbsp;<br />The Treasury Complex was on the front foot, spurred by continuing worries regarding Ems (Turkey, and the yuan slide). Yields fell, dragging the 10-year to 2.85, while major curve spreads found new cycle narrows (2s10s slipped beneath 25bps to 11-year flats, while 2s5s also narrowed to the flattest in just under 11 years. There was some negative ticks as risk sentiment improved on reports that Qatar was to invest $15bln into Turkey, seeing Treasuries back away from HOD. US 10-year T-notes settled 10+ ticks higher at 120-14.&nbsp;<br />US President Trump stated tariffs will rescue the US steel industry, while he also stated he is considering interview with Special Counsel Mueller. In addition, there were separate reports that US President Trump&#39;s team is preparing to oppose a potential subpoena from Special Counsel Mueller.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets traded lower across the board on spill over selling from Wall St where all majors declined amid a tech and energy rout, although the announcement of US-China trade talks provided some glimmer of hope. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2) were negative from the open as Australia was weighed by a slump across commodities including the 3% drop in oil and with hefty opening losses in Japan as exporters bore the brunt of a firmer JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) conformed to the negative tone after index heavyweight Tencent sparked off the global tech rout due to its first profit decline in 13 years and the Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) slipped to a 2&frac12;-year low alongside the broad weakness which had earlier dragged the MSCI EM Index into bear market territory. However, sentiment then improved and some of the regional majors nearly pared all their losses after reconciliation hopes were spurred by news that China&rsquo;s Vice Commerce Minister is to visit US for trade discussions later this month. Finally, 10yr JGBs head into the European morning flat although price action was choppy overnight alongside the tumultuous tone in riskier assets, while today&rsquo;s 5yr auction failed to spur demand as the b/c and accepted prices declined from prior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, antipodeans were spurred by the trade discussion news which helped AUD/USD shrug off the indecision from mixed jobs data, while the optimism helped CNY also pare some of its recent weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are currently flat although price action was choppy alongside the tumultuous tone in riskier assets, while focus turns to a 5yr auction later. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
