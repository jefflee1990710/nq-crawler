To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities down, Treasuries mostly up, DXY slightly up, Crude down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Ongoing US-China trade negotiations, Canada CPI and retail sales, Fed&rsquo;s Mester<br />* NEXT WEEK&rsquo;S MAIN EVENTS: FOMC Minutes, ECB Minutes, Eurozone PMIs (Flash), UK CPI, Eurogroup, UK GDP (2nd), US Durable Goods.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The Chinese foreign ministry denied reports which had suggested that there was an agreement to cut the US trade deficit with China by USD 200bln per annum, though talks are still ongoing. NEC Director Kudlow noted US-China talks are going very well but if negotiations do not succeed, Trump is prepared to take tough action on his own. He also confirmed that China has offered reduction in trade deficit with US of more than USD 200bln and defines it as a &#39;good number&#39;. Separately, US Trade Official Navarro did not attend the trade meetings yesterday, but reports highlighted that President Trump is still said to have a strong relationship with him. EU and India have filed a list of US imports that may be subject to additional tariffs in retaliation to US steel and aluminium tariffs. The Russian Economy Minister said the US refused to discuss tariffs with Russia within WTO framework, with Russia considering a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Iran&rsquo;s President Rouhani encouraged countries to revise relationships with the US and cut ties with Israel. Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Lavrov hopes that the US pull out of the nuclear deal does not imply an attack on Iran, adding that there is no new Cold War between Russia and the West.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FED SPEAK: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Mester (Voter, Hawk) said the US economy is near the Fed&rsquo;s Policy goals, the most favourable outlook seen in a long time. She added rate hikes are a possible defence against financial stability risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*DATA: </strong>Canadian CPI fell slightly short of expectations; although the MM gauge rose by 0.1% MM in April, base effects pushed YY CPI down to 2.2%, from 2.3%. On the flip side, the BoC YY Core measure edged higher to 1.5% from 1.4% whilst the BoC MM Core measure softened a touch to 0.1% from 0.2%. CPI Median and CPI Trim were unchanged. Retail sales beat expectations amid an increase in motor vehicles sales. Given firmer prices and stronger retail sales, analysts expect the BoC to hike rates again this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: </strong>SPX -0.26%, NDX -0.51%, DJI +0.01%&nbsp; SECTORS:&nbsp;Cons Cyclicals: -0.1%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.7%, Energy: -0.8%, Financials: -0.7%, Health Care: +0.4%, Industrials: +0.6%, Materials: +0.2%. US equity futures sold off at the cash-open and traded mostly rangebound for the rest of the session, with wires keen to attribute the losses to uncertainty around US-China negotiations. On the week, ES posts modest losses, and is closing-out just shy of the key 2720 level. In stocks specifics, Applied Materials (AMAT), Nordstrom (JWN) and Campbell Soup (CPB) were at the bottom of the S&amp;P after reporting their earnings whilst Deere (DE) led the index for the session after reporting encouraging numbers and raising its 2018 revenue guidance. In M&amp;A news, PayPal (PYPL) outperformed in the NASDAQ amid its acquisition of iZettle for USD 2.2bln to expand its operations in Europe/Latin America. Separately, Dell has begun talking with holders of its Vmware (VMW) tracking stock to measure interest in a merger with Vmware (VMW).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*CRUDE: </strong>WTI futures settle USD 0.21 lower at USD 71.28/bbl, Brent futures settle USD 0.79 up at USD 78.51/bbl. Oil prices were lower on Friday, but market sentiment overall remained bullish for the week amid geopolitical developments on the Iranian front and a general pick up in global demand. WTI futures held above USD 71/bbl whilst Brent failed its attempt to climb above USD 80/bbl, temporarily breached on Thursday. The Baker Hughes oil rig count was unchanged for this week at 844, after 6 consecutive weeks of gains. Further developments on the re-imposition of US sanctions and any geopolitical updates are the highpoints for next week. On a longer term view, UBS noted &lsquo;politics will remain the most important driver for oil in the next few months&rsquo; adding &lsquo;at least until the OPEC meeting in late June&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*TREASURIES: </strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 10+ ticks higher at 118-27. Treasuries climbed higher on Friday and found buyers after a relatively bearish week for the complex. On the week, the 10yr yields posted its biggest rise in a month. The yield curve saw some modest flattening on Friday, with 2yr yields lower by c.2bps, 10yr and 30yr yields by c.4bps. 2s5s and 2s10s narrowed by c.3bps in the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FOREX: </strong>USD: The DXY index traded sideways within recent ranges above 93.000, underpinned by US Treasury yields which are protecting the Greenback from trade-related tensions between the US and China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD: Friday&rsquo;s big loser in the G10 ranks after a NAFTA deal hopes faded on Thursday, and following the latest inflation and retail sales data which pushed USDCAD above 1.2800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, EUR: Both losing vs the Greenback with the Pound holding up better due to further progress towards a Brexit transition deal with Cable sitting around 1.3480. The single currency slumped to a fresh base for the year near 1.1750. EURGBP&nbsp; below 0.8750 and within striking distance of a large option expiry at 0.8700 for Monday (1 bln+).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY: A softer than forecasted inflation on Friday combined with compound JPY weakness vs the stronger USD, pushed USDJPY above 111.00, though the air was thin, and afternoon USD selling saw the pair back down to 110.60.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD, AUD, CHF: The Kiwi is back in the ascendency due to another change in the direction of cross-winds as AUDNZD retreats through 1.0900. Overall, AUDUSD and NZDUSD have pivoted around 0.7500 and 0.6900 respectively. The Franc has mostly benefited from EUR weakness with the cross testing bids/support at 1.1750.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A broad winner on several supportive factors ranging from upbeat US data and elevated Treasury yields to the demise of major and EM currency counterparts, like the Lira that slumped to 4.50 vs the Usd, Zar,&nbsp;Ars (Peso not gleaning lasting benefit from $5 bn daily intervention). and Mxn On the flip-side, trade winds were choppy with US-China negotiations said to be going well, but reports that Beijing had offered terms that would cut the deficit by $200 bn/year were subsequently denied and Japan is weighing up retaliatory tariffs. Nevertheless, the index climbed to a new ytd peak at 93.833 after overcoming a few set-backs and the obvious attraction is now 94.000, while the next technical target is just over 94.200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friday&rsquo;s fall guy in the G10 ranks, and also among the big losers on the week overall as NAFTA deal hopes faded into Thursday&rsquo;s soft US deadline and reports on negotiations went from almost there to still poles apart, depending on which of the 3 principles proffered an opinion. However, benign Canadian inflation data was the final straw for the Loonie &nbsp;(overshadowing a retail sales beat that was largely auto-driven), as Usd/Cad climbed above 1.2800, soaked up offers at 1.2850 and then re-tested peaks above 1.2900. For the record, 1.2924 traded on Tuesday after better than forecast US retail sales data, on balance and taking into account back month upgrades and the low for the week was circa 1.2750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;GBP/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also hefty losers vs the Greenback , but with the Pound holding up better on balance due to further progress towards a Brexit transition deal, albeit via another back-stop (on the contentious customs union issue). Cable has revisited 2018 lows around 1.3450, but the single currency slumped to a fresh base for the year near 1.1750 having started the week only a few pips shy of 1.2000 vs Cable close to 1.3600 at best. Hence, Eur/Gbp is below 0.8750 and within striking distance of a large option expiry at 0.8700 for Monday (1 bn+).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disappointing Japanese data in the form of an unexpected GDP contraction and softer than forecast inflation combined to compound Jpy weakness vs the aforementioned buoyant Usd, with Usd/Jpy rallying almost 2 big figures from one extreme to the other. Some key chart resistance levels were breached along the way along with export, option-related and corporate supply, and stops could be triggered next if the headline pair breaks 111.20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is back in the ascendency as the week closes out, but largely due to another change in the direction of cross-winds as Aud/Nzd retreats through 1.0900. Overall, Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd have pivoted around 0.7500 and 0.6900 respectively in relatively volatile trade, through mixed regional data, neutral RBA minutes and an upbeat NZ annual budget release. Usd/Chf has also been anchored around a big figure for the most part (parity), but the Franc has benefited from Eur weakness and the cross is now testing bids/support at 1.1750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choppy and out of sync moves for the Scandi crowns, but ultimately both are also outperforming the Eur following Riksbank and Norges Bank policy guidance confirming a more hawkish/less dovish near term outlook vs the ECB.</p>\r\n",

Nonetheless, the region showed some improvement from the weakness on Wall St, after the Chinese trade delegation was said to offer a package to reduce the US trade deficit by USD 200bln annually. This was the same amount the US had demanded during the 1st round of trade talks earlier this month in Beijing, while President Trump also commented that it is important to keep trade cooperation between US and China, which is in contrast to an earlier pessimistic tone from Trump that he doubted trade talks would be successful. In addition, sentiment was further underpinned by China ending its anti-dumping investigation on US sorghum, while North Korea seemed to have reverted back from its recent change in temperament and is said to increase efforts to defuse military tensions. ASX 200 (-0.1%) initially opened higher but failed to hold on to gains amid weakness in financials and mining-related sectors, while Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) was kept afloat by a weaker currency. Chinese markets were &nbsp;supported amid trade optimism in the wake of US-China trade talks with Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.3%) closing in positive territory. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally softer amid similar price action in T-notes and as yields tracked continued gains in their counterparts stateside, which saw the US 10yr yield extend above 3.100% and the 30yr yield reach its highest since September 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly injection of CNY 410bln (Prev. net drain of CNY 140bln W/W).

However, it was later reported that the China trade delegation was said to offer US President Trump a package that cuts the US trade deficit by USD 200bln annually. In addition, US President Trump commented shortly after that it is important to keep trade cooperation between US and China, while China Vice Premier Liu He said China is willing to work with US on trade issues following the meeting with Trump. Chinese foreign ministry says it isn&#39;t true the USD 200bln reduction in trade surplus was offered on their side, but talks are still ongoing.

(Newswires) Canada&rsquo;s PM Trudeau declined to comment when asked whether a NAFTA deal can be sealed this year but stated that current auto proposals are broadly acceptable to industries in the three nations, while Canada&rsquo;s Finance Minister Morneau is optimistic a NAFTA deal can be completed and thinks the NAFTA sunset clause is not practical.

The Italian benchmark has fallen to a one-month low as details of the 5SM and League government contract emerge with measures such as a universal basic income, adjusting tax bands and limited deficit spending; both parties are yet to agree on a PM. Given the &#39;alliances&#39; view on the banking sector, Italian banks sit at the foot of the index (Ubi Banca -4.5%, Banco BPM -4.9%, Bper Banca -4.3%, Intesa Sanpaolo -1.7%). Moving on, telecoms lag following downgrades of Altice and Telecom Italia as well as a few ex-dividends weighing on the sector. Elsewhere, Swiss luxury goods maker Richemont (-5.2%) took a hit amid disappointing earnings, dragging Swatch (-1.2%) down in sympathy. Finally, FTSE 100 heavyweight AstraZeneca (-2.0%) shares fell ill after reporting a miss on revenue and EPS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index is still largely trading sideways within recent ranges above 93.000 and underpinned by lofty US Treasury yields that are shielding the Greenback from trade-related bumps and bruises as talks between the US, China and other nations on tariffs continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outlier amidst very tight Usd/major moves, as the Kiwi revisits 0.6900 and recoups losses vs the Aud with the cross back down under 1.0900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes as the Jpy extends losses vs the Dollar to 111.00 in wake of more disappointing Japanese data (CPI softer than forecast following the surprise GDP contraction), and clears a key Fib resistance level (110.85) along the way. Stops reportedly at 111.20 unscathed so far. Conversely, the Franc has rebounded to trade through parity vs the Greenback, and is also testing bids below 1.1800 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP/CAD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All encircling round numbers vs the Usd and not showing much sign or inclination to break away, as Eur/Usd hugs 1.1800, Cable clings to 1.3500, Usd/Cad drifts back down to 1.2800 and Aud/Usd sits just above 0.7500. A large Eur/Usd option expiry at the strike (1.8 bn) could keep that pair tethered, but the Loonie could well see more volatile price action after displaying resilience in the face of no NAFTA deal (and reports suggesting no agreement in the offing) given looming Canadian CPI and retail sales data. On that note, the break-even via options indicates a circa +/- 75 pip reaction that could trigger 1.2700 expiries or a topside barrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A real Friday feel so far, and hardly helped by an empty domestic agenda for a 3rd session on the trot with Gilts indecisive either side of their previous 121.01 settlement level within a 121.22-120.97 range and the Short Sterling strip flat to 2 ticks adrift, but turnover very subdued. Pre-weekend positioning may well be a significant theme in the absence of anything else and no further Brexit developments, but next week there is clear potential for independent impetus via the BoE&rsquo;s QIR testimony, CPI data, retail sales and revised Q1 GDP that the MPC expects to be upgraded from a meagre 0.1% q/q preliminary print.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A choppy start to the final session of the week for the 10 year German debt future that was marked down 5 ticks off the open and dipped to 157.80 vs Thursday&rsquo;s 157.87 close before finding a foothold and rebounding above parity to test resistance around 158.00 (158.06 top so far). However, volumes are relatively light and Bunds seem caught between a consolidative tone in US Treasuries and fluctuations in Italian BTPs as the wait for a coalition Government in Rome drags on. Latest reports suggest that talks will now continue through the weekend to Monday, at least, but policy details are emerging in dribs and drabs via newswires. However Italian Bonds are succumbing to more downside pressure (134.26 low vs. 134.88 close and an early 135.16 high)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent are currently trading in positive territory approaching the week end, with Brent once again approaching the in-focus figure of USD 80BBL, currently trading +0.48% at USD 79.61/BBL. Traders awaiting further direction from Baker Hughes&rsquo; rig count later in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the weeks&rsquo; close approaches, Gold is seeing some profit taking, with the yellow metal currently down 0.1%. Aluminium has also witnesses a slide as the metal fell for the third straight session on increasing inventories. Nickel is currently the outperformer in the metals scope, as it has risen to a near one month high of USD 14,830/tonne.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "EU MID SESSION UPDATE: FTSE MIB lags its peers as 5 Star/League confirms programme, EU bourses negative amid US-China trade tensions",
        "content": "<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are trading on the backfoot with (Eurostoxx 50 -0.3%) with underperformance in Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB (-1.1%). The Italian benchmark has fallen to a one-month low as details of the 5SM and League government contract emerge with measures such as a universal basic income, adjusting tax bands and limited deficit spending; both parties are yet to agree on a PM. Given the &#39;alliances&#39; view on the banking sector, Italian banks sit at the foot of the index (Ubi Banca -4.0%, Banco BPM -2.9%, Bper Banca -2.1%, Intesa Sanpaolo -2.0%). Moving on, telecoms lag following downgrades of Altice and Telecom Italia as well as a few ex-dividends weighing on the sector. Elsewhere, Swiss luxury goods maker Richemont (-5.6%) took a hit amid disappointing earnings, dragging Swatch (-1.9%) down in sympathy. Finally, FTSE 100 heavyweight AstraZeneca (-2.5%) shares fell ill after reporting a miss on revenue and EPS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent are currently trading in positive territory approaching the week end, with Brent once again approaching the in-focus figure of USD 80BBL, currently trading +0.52% at USD 79.71/BBL. Traders awaiting further direction from Baker Hughes&rsquo; rig count later in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the weeks&rsquo; close approaches, Gold is seeing some profit taking, with the yellow metal currently down 0.1%. Aluminium has also witnesses a slide as the metal fell for the third straight session on increasing inventories. Nickel is currently the outperformer in the metals scope, as it has risen to a near one month high of USD 14,830/tonne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index is still largely trading sideways within recent ranges above 93.000 and underpinned by lofty US Treasury yields that are shielding the Greenback from trade-related bumps and bruises as talks between the US, China and other nations on tariffs continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outlier amidst very tight Usd/major moves, as the Kiwi revisits 0.6900 and recoups losses vs the Aud with the cross back down under 1.0900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes as the Jpy extends losses vs the Dollar to 111.00 in wake of more disappointing Japanese data (CPI softer than forecast following the surprise GDP contraction), and clears a key Fib resistance level (110.85) along the way. Stops reportedly at 111.20 unscathed so far. Conversely, the Franc has rebounded to trade through parity vs the Greenback, and is also testing bids below 1.1800 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP/CAD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All encircling round numbers vs the Usd and not showing much sign or inclination to break away, as Eur/Usd hugs 1.1800, Cable clings to 1.3500, Usd/Cad drifts back down to 1.2800 and Aud/Usd sits just above 0.7500. A large Eur/Usd option expiry at the strike (1.8 bn) could keep that pair tethered, but the Loonie could well see more volatile price action after displaying resilience in the face of no NAFTA deal (and reports suggesting no agreement in the offing) given looming Canadian CPI and retail sales data. On that note, the break-even via options indicates a circa +/- 75 pip reaction that could trigger 1.2700 expiries or a topside barrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A real Friday feel so far, and hardly helped by an empty domestic agenda for a 3rd session on the trot with Gilts indecisive either side of their previous 121.01 settlement level within a 121.22-120.97 range and the Short Sterling strip flat to 2 ticks adrift, but turnover very subdued. Pre-weekend positioning may well be a significant theme in the absence of anything else and no further Brexit developments, but next week there is clear potential for independent impetus via the BoE&rsquo;s QIR testimony, CPI data, retail sales and revised Q1 GDP that the MPC expects to be upgraded from a meagre 0.1% q/q preliminary print.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A choppy start to the final session of the week for the 10 year German debt future that was marked down 5 ticks off the open and dipped to 157.80 vs Thursday&rsquo;s 157.87 close before finding a foothold and rebounding above parity to test resistance around 158.00 (158.06 top so far). However, volumes are relatively light and Bunds seem caught between a consolidative tone in US Treasuries and fluctuations in Italian BTPs as the wait for a coalition Government in Rome drags on. Latest reports suggest that talks will now continue through the weekend to Monday, at least, but policy details are emerging in dribs and drabs via newswires. However Italian Bonds are succumbing to more downside pressure (134.26 low vs. 134.88 close and an early 135.16 high).</p>\r\n",

However, volumes are relatively light and Bunds seem caught between a consolidative tone in US Treasuries and fluctuations in Italian BTPs as the wait for a coalition Government in Rome drags on. Latest reports suggest that talks will now continue through the weekend to Monday, at least, and the lack of clarity regarding policy and personnel as much as anything else is taking its toll on sentiment, with the 10 year bond on the back foot again having attempted to pare some lost ground in early Eurex trade.</p>\r\n",

Nonetheless, the region showed some improvement from the weakness on Wall St, after the Chinese trade delegation was said to offer a package to reduce the US trade deficit by USD 200bln annually. This was the same amount the US had demanded during the 1st round of trade talks earlier this month in Beijing, while President Trump also commented that it is important to keep trade cooperation between US and China, which is in contrast to an earlier pessimistic tone from Trump that he doubted trade talks would be successful. In addition, sentiment was further underpinned by China ending its anti-dumping investigation on US sorghum, while North Korea seemed to have reverted back from its recent change in temperament and is said to increase efforts to defuse military tensions. ASX 200 (-0.2%) initially opened higher but failed to hold on to gains amid weakness in financials and mining-related sectors, while Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) was kept afloat by a weaker currency. Chinese markets were somewhat indecisive with Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (+0.3%) swinging between gains and losses but in a tight range with focus on trade talks. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally softer amid similar price action in T-notes and as yields tracked continued gains in their counterparts stateside, which saw the US 10yr yield extend above 3.100% and the 30yr yield reach its highest since September 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FTSE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK gambling names &ndash; The cut of maximum stake in FOBTs from GBP 100 to GBP 2 may not be implemented for another two years.

With Ocado&rsquo;s share price reaching an all-time high on Thursday, soaring 44.4pc to 797p, the company has now become a more expensive proposition for Jeff Bezos&rsquo; firm. If Amazon has been plotting an approach for Ocado, then it would have made sense to swoop when its share price was sitting at 230p two years ago.&rdquo; However, the piece goes on to say that the deal with Kroger makes it an attractive option as it vindicates its business model.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said the EU has been terrible to the US on trade and reportedly told German Chancellor Merkel to drop support for a major gas deal with Russia and instead buy American gas instead to avoid a trade war, while White House economic adviser Hasset is also said to see no trade war if Germany invests. (Newswires) French President Macron said there will be no detailed talks with US without tariff exemptions and that Europe will retaliate to protect its interests. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian stocks traded mostly positive but with gains contained as focus remained on US-China trade talks and the current geopolitical climate. Nonetheless, the region showed some improvement from the weakness on Wall St, after the Chinese trade delegation was said to offer a package to reduce the US trade deficit by USD 200bln annually. This was the same amount the US had demanded during the 1st round of trade talks earlier this month in Beijing, while President Trump also commented that it is important to keep trade cooperation between US and China, which is in contrast to an earlier pessimistic tone from Trump that he doubted trade talks would be successful. In addition, sentiment was further underpinned by China ending its anti-dumping investigation on US sorghum, while North Korea seemed to have reverted back from its recent change in temperament and is said to increase efforts to defuse military tensions. ASX 200 (-0.2%) initially opened higher but failed to hold on to gains amid weakness in financials and mining-related sectors, while Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) was kept afloat by a weaker currency. Chinese markets were somewhat indecisive with Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (+0.3%) swinging between gains and losses but in a tight range with focus on trade talks. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally softer amid similar price action in T-notes and as yields tracked continued gains in their counterparts stateside, which saw the US 10yr yield extend above 3.100% and the 30yr yield reach its highest since September 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly injection of CNY 410bln (Prev. net drain of CNY 140bln W/W).

Elsewhere, JPY continued to weaken with USD/JPY at its strongest in around 4 months as it eyed the 111.00 handle to the upside, following softer than expected inflation figures from Japan which adds to the slew of disappointing economic releases this week including Wednesday&rsquo;s GDP miss and further supports the likelihood of a prolonged continuation of the BoJ&rsquo;s powerful monetary easing. The greenback&rsquo;s NAFTA-counterparts were also kept subdued after the &lsquo;soft deadline&rsquo; passed, while US Trade Representative Lighthizer offered no comfort as he commented that NAFTA countries were nowhere near to a deal and noted gaping differences on a range of issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were uneventful overnight with oil prices taking a breather from the prior days swings in which WTI crude and Brent crude briefly rose above USD 72.00/bbl and USD 80.00/bbl respectively, before pulling back from their highest levels since 2014. Elsewhere, gold was lacklustre amid strength in the greenback, while copper was uneventful amid a flimsy risk tone in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said he had discussions with IEA&rsquo;s Birol to underscore commitment to maintaining stability in the oil market.

Yields continued to rise to fresh highs along the cruve, except for in the 2yr sector, where they were slightly lower. Most of the action concentrated in the long-end of the curve, where 10yr yields were higher by c.1bps and 30yr by c.3bps at settlement. 2s30s widened by c.5bps, 2s10s and 5s30s by c.3bps. Today&rsquo;s USD 11bln in 10yr TIPS auction tailed by 1bps, bid-to-cover came in at 2.42x in line with the 6-auction average though dealer participation was well above average. The Treasury announced next week&rsquo;s supply of USD 48bln in 3-month bills, USD 42bln in 6-month bills and USD 26bln 52-week bills next. It will also auction USD 16bln in a 2-year FRN reopening, USD 30bln in 7-year notes, USD 36bln in 5-year notes and USD 33bln in 2-year notes. Of note, the Treasury finally introduced a two-month bill.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks traded mostly positive but with gains contained as focus remained on US-China trade talks and the current geopolitical climate. Nonetheless, the region showed some improvement from the weakness on Wall St, after the Chinese trade delegation was said to offer a package to reduce the US trade deficit by USD 200bln annually. This was the same amount the US had demanded during the 1st round of trade talks earlier this month in Beijing, while President Trump also commented that it is important to keep trade cooperation between US and China, which is in contrast to an earlier pessimistic tone from Trump that he doubted trade talks would be successful. In addition, sentiment was further underpinned by China ending its anti-dumping investigation on US sorghum, while North Korea seemed to have reverted back from its recent change in temperament and is said to increase efforts to defuse military tensions. ASX 200 (-0.2%) initially opened higher but failed to hold on to gains amid weakness in financials and mining-related sectors, while Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) was kept afloat by a weaker currency. Chinese markets were somewhat indecisive with Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (+0.3%) swinging between gains and losses but in a tight range with focus on trade talks. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally softer amid similar price action in T-notes and as yields tracked continued gains in their counterparts stateside, which saw the US 10yr yield extend above 3.100% and the 30yr yield reach its highest since September 2014.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade mostly positive but with gains contained as focus remains on US-China trade talks and the current geopolitical climate. Nonetheless, the region has shown some improvement from the performance on Wall St after the Chinese trade delegation was said to offer a package that cuts the US trade deficit by USD 200bln annually. This was the same amount the US had demanded during the 1st round of trade talks earlier this month in Beijing, while President Trump also commented that it is important to keep trade cooperation between US and China, which is in contrast to an earlier pessimistic tone from Trump that he doubted trade talks would be successful. In addition, North Korea seemed to have reverted back from its recent change in temperament as state media reported the nation will increase efforts to defuse military tensions. ASX 200 (-0.2%) initially opened higher but failed to hold on to gains amid weakness in financials and mining-related sectors, while Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) was kept afloat by a weaker currency. Chinese markets are somewhat indecisive with Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (+0.3%) swinging between gains and losses but in a tight range with focus on trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is flat and remains near its YTD highs amid rising yields, which in turn has kept its major counterparts subdued with EUR/USD and GBP/USD languishing at the lower end of the 1.1800 and 1.3500 handles respectively. Elsewhere, JPY continued to weaken with USD/JPY at its strongest in around 4 months as it eyes the 111.00 handle to the upside, following softer than expected inflation figures from Japan which adds to the slew of disappointing economic releases this week including Wednesday&rsquo;s GDP miss and further supports the likelihood of prolonged continuation of the BoJ&rsquo;s powerful monetary easing. The greenback&rsquo;s NAFTA-counterparts were also kept subdued after the &lsquo;soft deadline&rsquo; passed, while US Trade Representative Lighthizer commented that NAFTA countries were nowhere near to a deal and noted gaping differences on a range of issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally softer amid similar price action in T-notes and with yields tracking continued gains in their counterparts stateside, which saw the US 10yr yield extend above 3.100% and the 30yr yield reach its highest since September 2014.</p>\r\n",
