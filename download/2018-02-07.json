The 1.3850 region acted as support, and cable trades off lows heading into Asia. The NZD dropped to the .7220 mark in wake of the RBNZ&rsquo;s rate decision, with the central bank standing pat on policy, but noting that some short-term economic weakness was on the cards, and it expects the TWI NZ$ to ease back over its forecast window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk504673747\">COMMODITIES</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude was trading higher as US traders got to their desks.

Incidentally, volume in the EMINIS was higher than yesterday&rsquo;s bounce-back, and as some bank desk noted after the sell-off, there appears to be value in US equities on the back of lower P/E multiples amid the background of solid corporate earnings and a positive US economic backdrop. Meanwhile, the VIX continues to ease back, now knocking around the 25 mark (vs c.30 on Tuesday). On the other hand, some desks have pointed out that investors were concerned about an &lsquo;overstretched&rsquo; market before Monday&rsquo;s sell-off, and traders remain mindful of rising yields and the impending withdrawal of stimulus by central banks (albeit, at a &lsquo;gradual&rsquo; pace). In stock specific news, Boeing was an outperformer, after the company noted key issues remain regarding Embraer (ERJ) talks, and separately, it said it is hopeful South Korea will decide on the purchase of P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft by the year end.

There was also modest steepening in major curve spreads (2s10s + 2bps, 5s30s +3bps, 2s30s +3bps). A weak 10-year auction, as well as US lawmakers agreeing on a two-year bipartisan budget that would lift caps on government spending &ndash; and increase the debt ceiling through March 2019 &ndash; were the main drivers. &nbsp;The US Treasury sold $24bln of 10-year notes, in a soft auction, which tailed by 0.8bps, while cover fell versus the previous auction and recent averages. Dealer participation rose, leaving directs and indirects with a lower takedown. The auction of 10s follows the soft auction of 3s on Tuesday; markets were keeping an eye out to see if current yields are at attractive levels for investors to step in, arresting the sharp rise in yields witnessed recently; however, evidence of this remains to be seen. In wake of today&rsquo;s auction, the curve continued to sell-off, with 10s hitting 2.85% shortly afterwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>US BUDGET DEAL: </strong>Lawmakers have reached a two-year, bipartisan budget deal that will lift government spending by around $300bln, add to the deficit, and raise the debt ceiling through March 2019. The deal still needs to be voted on in the House and the Senate. (Newsiwres)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk505799634\"><strong>RBNZ:</strong> Held rates at 1.75%, as expected. The central bank sees growth strengthening in the medium-term on the back of accommodative policy, high terms of trade, fiscal spending; however, it noted &ldquo;numerous uncertainties&rdquo;. It noted inflation expectations were anchored around 2%. RBNZ noted that the NZD has firmed since November, in part due to USD, and assumed on a trade weighted basis, it will ease over its forecast horizon. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CBANK SPEAK: Dudley, Evans, Kaplan, Nowotny</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Dudley (Voter) said that for now, his economic outlook was unchanged, though a sustained drop in the stock market would impact his outlook, and he stressed that the recent sell off wasn&#39;t that a big of a bump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Evans (Non-Voter) says that his dissenting vote against a December hike was a close call. He believes the US economy is firing on all cylinders. The Fed can change the pace of its balance sheet runoff if needed, he said, and that the risks seem to be moving towards additional inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter) said that market corrections are healthy. He is less convinced that higher wages will translate into higher prices, and the Fed is likely to overshoot full employment and that it is wise to remove accommodation but patiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny argued that US policymakers were trying to deliberately hold the value of the dollar down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: S&amp;P500 -0.50% at 2682, NDX -1.26% at 6582, DJIA -0.10% at 24890</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top sectors: Telecom +0.3%, Industrials +0.27%, Financials +0.17%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom sectors: Energy -1.67%, IT -1.36% Materials -0.86%,&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equities have clearly shown signs of stabilisation following Monday&rsquo;s hammering, though the losses from Friday and Monday are yet to be fully pared back. Incidentally, volume in the EMINIS was higher than yesterday&rsquo;s bounce-back, and as some bank desk noted after the sell-off, there appears to be value in US equities on the back of lower P/E multiples amid the background of solid corporate earnings and a positive US economic backdrop. Meanwhile, the VIX continues to ease back, now knocking around the 25 mark (vs c.30 on Tuesday). On the other hand, some desks have pointed out that investors were concerned about an &lsquo;overstretched&rsquo; market before Monday&rsquo;s sell-off, and traders remain mindful of rising yields and the impending withdrawal of stimulus by central banks (albeit, at a &lsquo;gradual&rsquo; pace).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stock specific news, Boeing was an outperformer, after the company noted key issues remain regarding Embraer (ERJ) talks, and separately, it said it is hopeful South Korea will decide on the purchase of P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft by the year end. Chipotle was a laggard after investors cooled on the restaurant following its earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: T-Note Futures settled -15+ ticks at 121-00</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Wednesday, (2s +4.5bps, 5s +6.4bps, 10s +8.5bps, 30s 8.3bps). There was also modest steepening in major curve spreads (2s10s + 2bps, 5s30s +3bps, 2s30s +3bps). A weak 10-year auction, as well as US lawmakers agreeing on a two-year bipartisan budget that would lift caps on government spending &ndash; and increase the debt ceiling through March 2019 &ndash; were the main drivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury sold $24bln of 10-year notes, in a soft auction, which tailed by 0.8bps, while cover fell versus the previous auction and recent averages. Dealer participation rose, leaving directs and indirects with a lower takedown. The auction of 10s follows the soft auction of 3s on Tuesday; markets were keeping an eye out to see if current yields are at attractive levels for investors to step in, arresting the sharp rise in yields witnessed recently; however, evidence of this remains to be seen. In wake of today&rsquo;s auction, the curve continued to sell-off, with 10s hitting 2.85% shortly afterwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: <a name=\"_Hlk505799518\">DXY trades +0.75% heading into APAC trade</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar Index strengthened on Wednesday, rising above the 90-handle. The dollar has found buying interest on safe-haven demand in recent days, though on Wednesday, it seemed to be more a function of tracking yields higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yen and swissy were sold, with USDJPY rising towards highs of 109.70, while USDCHF breaks through .94 to highs near .9450. And gold eased towards $1312 as haven demand lost its lustre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP moved lower on Wednesday, and in absence of specific newsflow, the weakness was attributed to momentum-driven trade. The 1.3850 region acted as support, and cable trades off lows heading into Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NZD dropped to the .7220 mark in wake of the RBNZ&rsquo;s rate decision, with the central bank standing pat on policy, but noting that some short-term economic weakness was on the cards, and it expects the TWI NZ$ to ease back over its forecast window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZAR the EMFX complex was weaker on USD strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle $1.60 lower at $61.79 per barrel; Brent futures settle $1.35 lower at $65.51 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk505799503\">Crude was trading higher as US traders got to their desks. News the Forties Pipeline was shutdown due to a faulty feed control valve. However, weekly inventory data from the EIA showed stocks building in the week (contrary to the API data released on Tuesday), after which crude slid lower. Additionally, traders continued to cite Tuesday&rsquo;s EIA, which sees US production continuing to rise through 2018. Also, a stronger dollar contributed to crude weakness.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baker Hughes January 2018 rig count: Average US rig count for +7 to 937, International rig count +6 to 960.

As a result, consensus looks for the Reserve Bank to maintain its balanced assessment and to emphasise that interest rates are likely to remain low for a considerable period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NZIER Shadow Board has once again recommended that the Reserve Bank should remain on hold with a small tightening bias, although it stressed that there is no urgency to lift the OCR. NZIER&rsquo;s chief economist stressed that &ldquo;businesses have become more downbeat about the economy since the new Government took office. Although this pessimism is not reflected in expected demand in their own business, it still suggests the Reserve Bank should allow more time to assess these recent developments before lifting interest rates.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recently released Q4 CPI data was perhaps not as weak as the headlines suggested, as the domestic inflationary pressures were more upbeat than the tradeables side of the release which weighed on the headline. Nonetheless, markets reacted to the data pushing out expectations of the first RBNZ rate increase from November 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. At the time of writing OIS are only pricing in 13bps worth of tightening for the reminder of the year (or a little over a 50/50 chance of a hike).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Westpac are more sanguine than the majority, noting that they &ldquo;have long argued that inflation will prove lower than the RBNZ expects, and continue to forecast OCR hikes only from late-2019.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Q4 labour market report proved to be slightly more encouraging than the inflation release at first glance, although it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have altered the monetary policy outlook for most. Following the release ANZ noted that &ldquo;the labour market remains strong, but is perhaps showing a few more signs of slowing under its own (capacity-constrained) weight. &nbsp;But despite this, signs of a sustained lift in wage pressure remain tentative at best. Some wage measures are off their lows, but are hardly lifting in a way that would suggest broader inflation pressures are about to be unleashed. We therefore see little in the figures to alter the RBNZ&rsquo;s cautious stance towards the monetary policy outlook.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Westpac struck a similar tone, opining that &ldquo;However, a broader range of measures suggests that there is still some slack remaining in the labour market. Wage growth remains very subdued, even after accounting for low inflation. There is no urgency for the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates in this environment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This decision will be accompanied by the quarterly Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) which will include&nbsp;the latest set of economic forecasts (<a href=\"https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/-/media/ReserveBank/Files/Publications/Monetary%20policy%20statements/2017/mpsnov17.pdf\" style=\"color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline\">November&rsquo;s MPS can be found here</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also worth noting that a new Policy Targets Agreement (PTA) is yet to be signed. ASB suggest that &ldquo;the published forecasts should depict a solid outlook for economic outlook. The low inflation starting point and higher than expected NZD could result in marginal downward tweaks in the published Official Cash Rate profile, but given pending changes in the monetary policy framework, financial markets should tread cautiously on drawing too much into any tweaks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the bank desks are saying: -</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ANZ: </strong>The RBNZ will again leave the OCR at 1.75%, and retain a cautiously upbeat stance. Developments since the November Statement have been mixed to say the least, but we are not expecting the broad spirit of its assessment to change a great deal. A similar interest rate profile is likely (although at the margin the risks are perhaps that it is a touch lower). The RBNZ is not expecting to have to tighten until the second half of 2019. This is a view we now share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASB: </strong>On Thursday, the RBNZ delivers its final Monetary Policy Statement, and penultimate Official Cash Rate (OCR) decision under the current Policy Target Agreement. Grant Spencer has been acting Governor since Wheeler&rsquo;s 5-year term ended in September (just after the General Election). Adrian Orr has subsequently been announced as the new Governor, taking over on March 27th (just days after the March 22nd OCR review). It&rsquo;s widely expected Adrian Orr will sign a Policy Targets Agreement that incorporates a second target of maximizing employment, alongside price stability. The details of such are yet to be announced. With a change in team, rules and referee taking place at the RBNZ, along with the general consensus that there is no urgency to move rates (see chart of the week), there little need for the RBNZ to offer anything more than an update on where it sees inflationary pressure heading. The published forecasts should depict a solid outlook for economic outlook. A weaker inflation starting point and higher-than-expected NZD could result in marginal downward tweaks in the published OCR profile. However, due to pending changes in the monetary policy framework, financial markets would be best to interpret the rate profile cautiously. One of the key thematics we have been emphasising is interest rate convergence, with rising (but lower) global interest rates converging with upwardly drifting (but higher) NZD rates. While our 1.75% OCR is currently above equivalent policy rates for most OECD comparators, global short-term rates are expected to play catch-up. Current market pricing has close to three Fed hikes fully priced in for 2018, versus our on hold for 2018 OCR view and market pricing of around 15bps of OCR hikes by the end of the year. The removal of policy accommodation is also expected by the ECB and Bank of England, contributing to further compression with NZD rates. Australian short-term rates are also expected to edge up, albeit gradually. To a large extent the expected moves in policy rates have already been &ldquo;priced in&rdquo; to the curve, particularly for short-to-medium-term horizons. Viewing wholesale interest rate curves shows that NZD rates are below USD counterparts over the 6-month to the 4-year tenor. This convergence is taking place amid a backdrop of a trend decline in assessments of where policy interest rates will settle in the longer term. Estimates of the neutral NZ policy rate OCR rate at around 3.5% (as compared to 6-7% back in 1999) are only 75 bps above current estimates of where the Fed policy rate will gravitate to in the longer-term. Potential catalysts include the achievement of low inflation and low inflation expectations given disinflation by the RBNZ, weaker productivity growth, a potential &ldquo;glut&rdquo; of savings over investment and the likelihood that policy moves have greater traction, due to the climb in indebtedness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BNZ: </strong>At Thursday&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Statement, we expect the RBNZ will largely stick with the OCR forecasts it had back in November. That is, no full first OCR hike until early 2020. The information flow over the last couple of months might even argue, at the margin, for a softer track. However, this is balanced by 1) the sense there is already a strong precautionary element to the OCR setting, 2) the Bank&rsquo;s recent emphasis on the flexibility it has in guiding inflation to the mid-point of its target band and 3) the fact there are a number of identifiable inflation impulses on the near horizon. This probably explains why the market is still looking for a first rate hike far earlier than the RBNZ has indicated &ndash; albeit that this expectation has drifted out into early 2019, from late 2018. We have also delayed our view on OCR hikes, to a February 2019 start point (while pushing our peak, still 3.00%, out to 2020).<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Westpac: </strong>We expect the RBNZ to continue with its firmly neutral OCR outlook and repeat its long&ndash;held guidance that &ldquo;Monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable period&rdquo;. Recent developments have been roughly neutral, with low inflation and the high exchange rate counterbalanced by a resurgent housing market and upwardly revised GDP. Foreign exchange markets may react to any comment about the exchange rate being too high, but interest rate markets are unlikely to be perturbed by a steady&ndash;as&ndash;she&ndash;goes MPS.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>THIS WEEK&rsquo;S TREASURY SUPPLY: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury will sell USD 68bln of new 3s (USD 28bln, Tuesday), new 10s (USD 24bln, Wednesday), and new 30s (USD 16bln, Thursday). With USD 46.6bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is seen at USD 21.4bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month&rsquo;s series of auctions comes at a key inflection point, with bonds selling-off aggressively at the beginning of the year. The 10-year note, for instance, has added c.40bps in 2018, a trend exacerbated by strong US data and hints that the Fed may lift rates more aggressively than anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the recent sell-off along the US curve, markets will be eyeing this week&rsquo;s series of auctions to determine whether there is demand for US paper at these levels, or whether this week&rsquo;s &lsquo;stabilisation&rsquo; in yields portends a pause before another round of selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January&rsquo;s 10-year note auction was received very well, with solid stop-through as well as cover above recent averages, and the high yield the largest since July 2014. &nbsp;Fund takedown was the most since October, while foreign participation rose to the highest since March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest positioning data shows dealers have raised positioning in the 7-11yr bucket to $2.1bln, the most since November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts at Societe Generale say that the 10-year note trades fair on asset swap when compared to the off-the-runs when viewed over the last two auction cycles, though trades cheap on the curve vs 5s and 30s. Meanwhile, the 2s10s spread has widened by over 10bps since the last auction cycle, and benchmark 10s are yielding more than the previous auction&rsquo;s stop-out rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SocGen believes the 10s auction will benefit from cheap valuations, and we will likely see the largest stop-out rate at a 10s auction since January 2014. It also notes that the 10y benchmark is trading negative in repo, indicating the build-up of a short base, which could be a positive going into the auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Negatives, the bank argues, include the larger auction size, following the US Treasury&rsquo;s recent Quarterly funding announcement, increased probability of more Fed rate hikes in 2018 following last week&rsquo;s stellar Employment Situation Report, as well as compensation inflation picking up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY (JANUARY AUCTION VS SIX-AUCTION AVERAGE):</strong><br />- High-yield: 2.579% (vs six-auction average of 2.342%)<br />- Tail: Stopped-through by 0.5bps (vs six-auction average tail of 0.3bps)<br />- Bid-to-cover: 2.69x (vs six-auction average of 2.43x)<br />- Dealers: 22.0% (vs six-auction average of 29.7%)<br />- Directs: 6.5% (vs six-auction average of 7.1%)<br />- Indirects: 71.4% (vs six-auction average of 63.2%)</p>\r\n",

Eur/Usd felt the weight of the aforementioned cross (Eur/Jpy) flow and drifted down towards key support and Fibs just ahead of 1.2300, while Sterling was plagued by ongoing UK political-Brexit issues as latest reports suggest the EU may be seeking bigger budget defense contributions, with Cable edging down towards 1.3900 having breached its 1.3958 21 DMA. Usd/Cad did not deviate far from 1.2500 despite better than forecast Canadian building permits, with the 55 DMA at 1.2507 unchallenged ahead of a speech from BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins on Thursday.

        "content": "<p>Fixed has reversed course again, with Bunds handing back all and a bit more of their recovery gains despite a decent second outing for the new German 10 year cash benchmark. The core Eurex bond future just bounced of a new 158.55 intraday low (-31 ticks vs +6 ticks at the other end of the spectrum), while Gilts have revisited their Liffe base from a 121.97 peak (+4 ticks vs -25 ticks) as US stock futures chip away at losses ahead of the Wall Street open and EU indices firm up in tandem. However, what lies in store in terms of US equity performance will really set the tone from further consolidation or a pull-back that will help determine whether Monday or Tuesday was the blip or new direction. Note also, more Fed and ECB speakers in the mix and the 10 year US refunding leg to provide impetus. At the short end of the curve, decent flows seen in Sterling options via a mid curve condor, Eurodollar butterfly and outright futures.</p>\r\n",

Gilts have now crossed the water line at 121.95 vs Monday&rsquo;s 121.93 Liffe settlement having been &frac14; point adrift at worst, but remain conscious about the BoE (along with Brexit of course) as the MPC kicks off its first policy meet of 2018 today. USTs firmer and the curve fractionally flatter after a lacklustre start to this week&rsquo;s refunding auctions, with 10 year notes to absorb and the yield around 2.76% within a 2.88%-2.68% rough range since last Friday&rsquo;s strong US labour report. Note also, despite a light data docket there will be some attention on the latest Senate stop-gap funding vote on top of the stock vigil.</p>\r\n",

However, the DXY has failed to sustain a rebound above near term resistance (89.600 treble top and then 89.700-750) or seriously challenge the next key tech levels above 90.000 (between 90.113-150). Hence, Wednesday could be key for the Buck in terms of whether its recent recovery continues or the end-2017 through January bear market resumes, and this also applies to Wall Street and equities in general after Monday&rsquo;s rout and partial recovery yesterday. Looking at headline currency pairings, Eur/Usd is drifting lower having breached the 1.2400 level amidst conflicting headlines about a deal or no deal struck on a German grand coalition, but comfortably above the 20 DMA at 1.2303, while Cable has retreated further from 1.4000 and through a similar MA at 1.3958 to a 1.3920 low amidst reports that the EU will insist on harsh Brexit transition conditions if terms are violated. Usd/Cad remains anchored around 1.2500 after trade deficit misses on both side of the NA divide, while the Aud and Nzd are both hovering nearer recent lows around 0.7860 and 0.7300 respectively, with the Kiwi not getting much traction from better than expected NZ jobs data as attention quickly shifts to the RNBZ policy meeting later today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<h2>The RBI is widely seen to keep rates unchanged when it conducts its bi-annual policy meeting today, with 14 out of 15 analysts surveyed forecasting the Repurchase Rate and Reverse Repo Rate to be maintained at 6.00% and 5.75% respectively, while 1 analyst is calling for a 25bps hike.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the near one-sided consensus for no policy changes, there are also increasing calls that the central bank may keep a neutral bias but provide a hawkish tone and some anticipate possible signals of future rate hikes. This follows a recent trend of firmer inflation data in which CPI rose to a 16-month high during December at 5.2% vs. Exp. 5.1% (Prev. 4.9%), which risks overshooting the central bank&#39;s medium-term target of 4% within a band of +/- 2 percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent increases in oil prices, coupled with the government&rsquo;s vow to ensure a minimum support price of 50% greater than farmers&rsquo; cost of production and the likely impact this may have on food prices, would be another cause of concern for the RBI in its attempts to contain inflation and effectively narrows room for looser policy. In addition, the recent budget announcement to target fiscal deficit at 3.3% of GDP vs. Exp. 3.2% and the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act target of 3.0%, hints of a looser approach to government spending and suggests less urgency for RBI measures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>External pressure for rate cuts also seems to have been somewhat alleviated as Indian Chief Economic Adviser Subramanian suggested that the scope for RBI rate cuts may be limited with growth picking up, which is in contrast to the usual comments from government officials who have on previous numerous occasions explicitly urged for rate cuts from the RBI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The announcement is scheduled for 0900GMT/0300CST and aside from the decision on rates, focus will be on the tone from the RBI and if expectations of a hawkish tone or signal for future hikes materializes.&nbsp;As a reminder, market reactions to the RBI are no so straight forward, as INR has previously been supported by dovish surprises which is due to increased expectations of foreign fund inflows spurred by the looser policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent comments and calls<br />-&nbsp;Barclays sees larger fiscal deficits and higher global commodity prices to possibly influence the MPC to adopt a cautious stance.<br />- BofAML expects a slightly hawkish pause, but says that inflation risks are overdone.<br />- ICICI Securities expects the RBI to be hawkish and also expects an upward revision to inflation forecasts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

With USD 46.6bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is seen at USD 21.4bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month&rsquo;s series of auctions comes at a key inflection point, with bonds selling-off aggressively at the beginning of the year. The 10-year note, for instance, has added c.40bps in 2018, a trend exacerbated by strong US data and hints that the Fed may lift rates more aggressively than anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the recent sell-off along the US curve, markets will be eyeing this week&rsquo;s series of auctions to determine whether there is demand for US paper at these levels, or whether this week&rsquo;s &lsquo;stabilisation&rsquo; in yields portends a pause before another round of selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January&rsquo;s 10-year note auction was received very well, with solid stop-through as well as cover above recent averages, and the high yield the largest since July 2014.&nbsp; Fund takedown was the most since October, while foreign participation rose to the highest since March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest positioning data shows dealers have raised positioning in the 7-11yr bucket to $2.1bln, the most since November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts at Societe Generale say that the 10-year note trades fair on asset swap when compared to the off-the-runs when viewed over the last two auction cycles, though trades cheap on the curve vs 5s and 30s. Meanwhile, the 2s10s spread has widened by over 10bps since the last auction cycle, and benchmark 10s are yielding more than the previous auction&rsquo;s stop-out rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SocGen believes the 10s auction will benefit from cheap valuations, and we will likely see the largest stop-out rate at a 10s auction since January 2014. It also notes that the 10y benchmark is trading negative in repo, indicating the build-up of a short base, which could be a positive going into the auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Negatives, the bank argues, include the larger auction size, following the US Treasury&rsquo;s recent Quarterly funding announcement, increased probability of more Fed rate hikes in 2018 following last week&rsquo;s stellar Employment Situation Report, as well as compensation inflation picking up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY (JANUARY AUCTION VS SIX-AUCTION AVERAGE):</strong><br />- High-yield: 2.579% (vs six-auction average of 2.342%)<br />- Tail: Stopped-through by 0.5bps (vs six-auction average tail of 0.3bps)<br />- Bid-to-cover: 2.69x (vs six-auction average of 2.43x)<br />- Dealers: 22.0% (vs six-auction average of 29.7%)<br />- Directs<a name=\"_Hlk505700467\">: 6.5% (vs six-auction average of 7.1%)</a><br />- Indirects: 71.4% (vs six-auction average of 63.2%)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mostly higher as region attempted to track the rebound on Wall St. where stocks found reprieve from the 2-day market turmoil on dip buying, which saw S&amp;P 500 briefly reclaim 2700 and the DJIA home in on the 25000 level. ASX 200 (+0.8%) traded positive in which energy and resources names led the recovery as commodities nursed losses, while Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) was initially the best performer and gained over 3% in early-trade before it gradually pared most the advances amid a choppy currency and as momentum waned. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.3%) were both lifted at the open by the early rising tide, although mainland stocks then retreated amid Shenzhen volatility and after the PBoC continued to drain liquidity from the banking system with its inaction. Finally, 10yr JGBs shrugged off the initial safe-haven outflows and returned flat, as price action proved to be as indecisive as the recovery in Japanese stocks. Furthermore, the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement failed to spur any market reaction as the bank kept its purchase amounts inline with the previous.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The RBI is widely seen to keep rates unchanged when it conducts its bi-annual policy meeting today, with 14 out of 15 analysts surveyed forecasting the Repurchase Rate and Reverse Repo Rate to be maintained at 6.00% and 5.75% respectively, while 1 analyst is calling for a 25bps hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the near one-sided consensus for no policy changes, there are also increasing calls that the central bank may keep a neutral bias but provide a hawkish tone and some anticipate possible signals of future rate hikes. This follows a recent trend of firmer inflation data in which CPI rose to a 16-month high during December at 5.2% vs. Exp. 5.1% (Prev. 4.9%), which risks overshooting the central bank&#39;s medium-term target of 4% within a band of +/- 2 percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent increases in oil prices, coupled with the government&rsquo;s vow to ensure a minimum support price of 50% greater than farmers&rsquo; cost of production and the likely impact this may have on food prices, would be another cause of concern for the RBI in its attempts to contain inflation and effectively narrows room for looser policy. In addition, the recent budget announcement to target fiscal deficit at 3.3% of GDP vs. Exp. 3.2% and the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act target of 3.0%, hints of a looser approach to government spending and suggests less urgency for RBI measures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>External pressure for rate cuts also seems to have been somewhat alleviated as Indian Chief Economic Adviser Subramanian suggested that the scope for RBI rate cuts may be limited with growth picking up, which is in contrast to the usual comments from government officials who have on previous numerous occasions explicitly urged for rate cuts from the RBI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The announcement is scheduled for 0900GMT/0300CST and aside from the decision on rates, focus will be on the tone from the RBI and if expectations of a hawkish tone or signal for future hikes materializes.&nbsp;As a reminder, market reactions to the RBI are no so straight forward, as INR has previously been supported by dovish surprises which is due to increased expectations of foreign fund inflows spurred by the looser policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent comments and calls<br />-&nbsp;Barclays sees larger fiscal deficits and higher global commodity prices to possibly influence the MPC to adopt a cautious stance.<br />- BofAML expects a slightly hawkish pause, but says that inflation risks are overdone.<br />- ICICI Securities expects the RBI to be hawkish and also expects an upward revision to inflation forecasts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as region mirrors the rebound on Wall St. where stocks found reprieve from the 2-day market turmoil. Furthermore, the turnaround was attributed to dip buying amidst the backdrop of continued strong economic fundamentals, which saw S&amp;P 500 briefly reclaim 2700 and the DJIA home in on the 25000 level. ASX 200 (+1.1%) trades positive with energy and resource names leading the recovery as commodities nurse losses, while Nikkei 225 (+2.7%) is the best performer on a weaker currency and has clawed back the majority of the prior day&rsquo;s near-5% decline. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) are also higher as nearly all bourses are lifted by the rising tide, aside from New Zealand which gets its first opportunity to digest the prior day&rsquo;s sell-off on return from holiday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively range-bound overnight with most majors holding on to recent gains against the USD, although JPY was an exception with the safe-haven subdued amid the improvement in risk appetite. Elsewhere, NZD/USD was underpinned after strong jobs data in which Employment Change topped estimates and the Unemployment Rate unexpectedly declined, while the PBoC was also a hindrance on the greenback after it set the strongest fix since August 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are weaker on safe-haven outflows and amid similar declines in USTs, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement failed to spur any market reaction as the bank kept amounts inline with the previous.</p>\r\n",
