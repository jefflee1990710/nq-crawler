In the end, the vast uncertainty posed by Brexit outweighed the optimism surrounding recent wage growth and as such, some of the more hawkish MPC members (Saunders, Haldane) refrained from dissenting. In terms of economic forecasts, adjustments were relatively minor with modest tweaks to growth alongside a downgrade in 2018 CPI to 2.3% from 2.5% with assumptions based on &ldquo;on a smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdom&rsquo;s eventual trading relationship with the European Union&rdquo;. The Bank continue to adopt more of a reactive stance on Brexit by awaiting the outcome of government negotiations and remain vague on how they would respond to various Brexit scenarios by stating &ldquo;The MPC judges that the monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction&rdquo;. Questions were put to the Governor about commentary that the Bank could be forced to raise rates in the face of disorderly Brexit, but Carney was quick to bat this line of enquiry out of the way by downplaying the likelihood of such an outcome. In lieu of the BoE&rsquo;s current optimism as March 2019 approaches without much in the way of progress between the UK and EU, ING warns &ldquo;if a deal isn&#39;t agreed until early next year, or indeed much closer to the March 29th Article 50 deadline (which shouldn&#39;t be completely ruled out), then the date of the next rate rise could easily get pushed back into the second half of 2019&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump and Chinese President Xi announced they have made progress in trade discussions; Trump noted they have had &quot;a long and very good conversation&quot; about many subjects with heavy emphasis on trade; he added discussions are moving along nicely and meetings are being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina. China&#39;s Premier Li was also optimistic and said he is &ldquo;willing&rdquo; to meet Trump; he hopes for a steady, healthy relationship based on mutual understanding as the nature of US-China trade relations is mutually beneficial, urging the US to meet China halfway. In related news, the US Department of Justice is said to plan initiative on China economic espionage whilst the US International Trade Commission made affirmative determination in the first phase anti-dumping duty investigation on mattresses from China. Elsewhere, the EU is set to revise plan to fix WTO to gain US support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NEC DIRECTOR KUDLOW</strong> said that Trump will act aggressively on China if no deal is reached. Commenting on the US market, he does not expect a long-term downside in stocks he believes a correction partially reflects uncertainty around upcoming mid-term. He added that Trump would veto tax increases if democrats seek them. Finally, he stated that Trump has not called Fed&rsquo;s Chair Powell to discuss his actions &ldquo;yet&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> A UK PM May spokesperson denied reports published by The Times, which stated that a deal with the EU on financial services was reached, noting that while they continue to make good progress on negotiating financial services with the EU, the negotiations are still ongoing. Both sides were upbeat about the progress made on Financial Services Agreements with EU Chief Negotiator Barnier announcing that the EU may grant and withdraw equivalence in some financial services autonomously. He added that, as with other 3rd countries, the EU ready to have close regulatory dialogue with UK in full respect for autonomy of both parties. In later trade, the FT reported that the EU is floating a compromise with the UK which would give stronger guarantees of no need for a customs border in Ireland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> Il Sole reported on Thursday that the Italian President has signed for the budget transfer to parliament. In comments, Italian PM Conte said he does not see dialogue with the European Commission over the budget as &quot;an exchange of concessions&quot;, adding that the weak economic data is the current government&#39;s fault and positive effects of reforms will only be seen from 2019. On the EU side, Il Messaggero reported the EU has already decided the infringement procedure against Italy which will start at the end of the year. In later comments, Italy PM office noted the government has &quot;productive and constant&quot; dialogue with the EU commission and that both parties have the goal of focusing on public finances stability and protection of savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ISM MFG PMI</strong> slipped in October from 59.8 to 57.7 below the expected 59.0, though overall the index remains strong. Moreover, new orders fell to 57.6 from 61.8 the lowest since April 2017 and employment also dropped to 56.8 from 58.8; prices paid rose to 71.6 from 66.9. Analysts at Scotiabank note that overall activity is consistent with economic growth easing from peaks seen in the last two quarters to a more sustainable growth pace. Additionally, they argue the uptick in prices paid is likely to be a transitionary first-round tariffs effect; overall &ldquo;solid growth coming from the US manufacturing sector simply reinforces the forecast narrative while the Fed is likely to look through the price signal&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CONSTRUCTION SPENDING </strong>was unchanged in September though the previous reading was upwardly revised to 0.8% from 0.1%. Looking at the components, private construction spending rose by 0.3% whilst new single-families homed were down 0.8%. Analysts at Wells Fargo note &ldquo;this series is notoriously volatile and subject to large revisions&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +1.06% at 2741, NDX +1.49% at 7069, DJI +1.05% at 25379. S</strong>ECTORS: Energy +0.82%, Materials +3.02%, Industrials +1.72%, Cons Discretionary +2.23%, Cons Staples +0.48%, Healthcare +1.30%, Financials +0.45%, Tech +1.20%, Telecoms +0.14%, Utilities -0.53%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>The materials sector was an outperformer today following DowDuPont (DWDP) beating EPS estimates and a USD 3bln share repurchase programme. Constructive China trade comments from Trump helped industrial names Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) trade higher on the day. Newfield Exploration (NFX) surged after news broke of it being acquired by the Canadian Encana Corp (ECA.TO). Casino stock Wynn Resorts (WYNN) was a top mover too after the Macau region reported strong October revenue. HanesBrands (HBI) slid on the back of it lowering its full-year profit forecast. A drop in oil prices weighed on the energy sector with Baker Hughes (BHGE), Apache (APA) and Marathon Oil (MRO) all down on the day. Ford (F) was another bottom mover after it reported an October decline in US vehicle sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES $1.62 LOWER AT $63.69/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES $2.15 LOWER AT $72.89/BBL. </strong>Crude was lower on Thursday, with WTI printing a fourth day of losses, while Brent (F19, the first day as the front-month contract) printing a third day of losses. &quot;Although worries over the apparent slowing of global economic growth has contributed some demand uncertainty to crude oil&rsquo;s fundamental equation, rising production is putting a direct pressure on prices to move lower,&quot; Citi said, &quot;US August crude oil production of 11.346mln BPD was nearly 250k BPD more than the DOE had forecast. Russian production for October may have been a new post-Soviet record of 11.4 mmbpd or so. And early estimates on OPEC production for October are also showing net gains,&quot; the bank added, citing a Reuters survey which sees the increase at 390k BPD on higher output from Libya and Saudi Arabia. &quot;The reaction so far has broken the uptrend in Brent crude oil drawn underneath prior lows since June 2017, which may trigger a further round of speculative long liquidation,&quot; Citi warned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES TICKS 4+ TICKS AT &nbsp;118-18+. </strong>Treasuries were marginally higher on Thursday after disappointing ISM Manufacturing data and as investors prepare for tomorrow&rsquo;s October labour market report where 183k jobs are expected to be added to the economy. Informa notes &ldquo;anything remotely close to that number could spell trouble for the bond market, as it will almost certainly trigger a mass migration to the equity markets as investor confidence builds&rdquo;. Yields across the curve were lower by c.2bps at settlement; 2s10s and 2s30s widened by c.1bps and 10s30 narrowed by less than 1bps. The US treasury announced it will sell USD 45bln of 3-month and USD 39bln of 6-month bills on November 5th to settle on November 8th, USD 26bln of 52-week bills on November 6th to settle on November 8th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>A pretty sharp and abrupt fall from grace for the Buck as the DXY reversed almost 100 ticks at one stage from new 2018 highs of 97.201 set on October 31 to trade at 96.300 at one stage amidst all round selling vs major and EM counterparts. The ongoing recovery in global stocks and broader risk sentiment weighed on the Greenback along with unwinding month end/SOMA/tax flows, plus an element of hedging for tomorrow&rsquo;s monthly US jobs data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>The antipodean Dollars both extended rebounds vs their US peer, with the former only just falling short of decent option expiries at the 0.7200 strike in time for the NY cut having tripped stops at 0.7160 in wake of a much wider than forecast Aussie trade surplus overnight. Meanwhile, the Kiwi flew further above 0.6600 towards 0.6650 as the Aud/Nzd cross held below or around 1.0850.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, EUR:</strong> Also advancing vs the Usd, and the Pound overcoming several obstacles including UK data/survey misses in the form of Nationwide house prices and the manufacturing PMI, denials from the Brexit Ministry and EU officials that a deal to maintain access or equivalence for financial services has been reached, with an aide to Barnier also playing down reports that a full withdrawal agreement could be struck by November 21st. However, Cable rebounded strongly from worst levels (below its 10 DMA circa 1.2873) to eventually take out supply residing between 1.2920-25 and trigger stops around 1.2930 on its way to just over 1.2950, while Eur/Gbp recoiled from 0.8865 to 0.8805. Note, 1.2977 in Cable forms another key Fib and hawkish BoE minutes/QIR on balance may propel Sterling higher. The single currency also got very close to option expiry interest, and huge 1.1400 run-offs amounting 4 bn, having held ytd lows near 1.1300 on Wednesday and clearing offers between 1.1370-80 in the process, with 1.1423 the next upside chart target (major Fib).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, CAD,</strong> JPY: All beneficiaries of the Greenback&rsquo;s relatively pronounced U-turn, with the Franc shrugging off Swiss inflation data and the manufacturing PMI to inch closer to parity vs circa 1.0090 at one stage, with hawkish-sounding fare from SNB&rsquo;s Zurbrugg also a factor. The Loonie is up virtually a full point at 1.3090 despite soft oil and a dip in Canadian manufacturing PMI while even the retrained Jpy finally got a lift to trade up to 112.65 vs the Usd having held at 113.00 at the other end of the range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>All firmer vs the Buck, but the Zar especially strong and breaching the psychological 14.5000 level, while the Yuan rebounded from recent lows amidst some conciliatory words from US President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi on trade, and the Czk maintained a bid following the CNB&rsquo;s 25 bp hike (via 5-2 vote, and with one dissenter calling for &frac12; point vs the dove wanting no change).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: Nonfarm Payrolls (October 2018) due at 1230 GMT/0830 EST on 2 November 2018. </strong>The consensus expects wage annualised growth to top 3.0%; analysts are mindful of the potential weather impact.

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pretty sharp and abrupt fall from grace for the Buck as the DXY reversed almost 100 ticks at one stage from new 2018 highs of 97.201 set on October 31 to trade at 96.300 at one stage amidst all round selling vs major and EM counterparts. The ongoing recovery in global stocks and broader risk sentiment weighed on the Greenback along with unwinding month end/SOMA/tax flows, plus an element of hedging for tomorrow&rsquo;s monthly US jobs data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The antipodean Dollars both extended rebounds vs their US peer, with the former only just falling short of decent option expiries at the 0.7200 strike in time for the NY cut having tripped stops at 0.7160 in wake of a much wider than forecast Aussie trade surplus overnight. Meanwhile, the Kiwi flew further above 0.6600 towards 0.6650 as the Aud/Nzd cross held below or around 1.0850.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also advancing vs the Usd, and the Pound overcoming several obstacles including UK data/survey misses in the form of Nationwide house prices and the manufacturing PMI, denials from the Brexit Ministry and EU officials that a deal to maintain access or equivalence for financial services has been reached, with an aide to Barnier also playing down reports that a full withdrawal agreement could be struck by November 21st. However, Cable rebounded strongly from worst levels (below its 10 DMA circa 1.2873) to eventually take out supply residing between 1.2920-25 and trigger stops around 1.2930 on its way to just over 1.2950, while Eur/Gbp recoiled from 0.8865 to 0.8805. Note, 1.2977 in Cable forms another key Fib and hawkish BoE minutes/QIR on balance may propel Sterling higher. The single currency also got very close to option expiry interest, and huge 1.1400 run-offs amounting 4 bn, having held ytd lows near 1.1300 on Wednesday and clearing offers between 1.1370-80 in the process, with 1.1423 the next upside chart target (major Fib).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scandi crowns ran into some resistance around 9.5000 and sub-10.3000 vs the Eur respectively, but maintained momentum vs an increasingly soggy Usd after Norwegian and Swedish manufacturing PMI beats, with the Nok also underpinned by more Norges Bank policy guidance for gradual tightening and the next hike in Q1 next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All beneficiaries of the Greenback&rsquo;s relatively pronounced U-turn, with the Franc shrugging off Swiss inflation data and the manufacturing PMI to inch closer to parity vs circa 1.0090 at one stage, with hawkish-sounding fare from SNB&rsquo;s Zurbrugg also a factor. The Loonie is up virtually a full point at 1.3070 despite soft oil and a dip in Canadian manufacturing PMI and now eyeing BoC commentary from Wilkins and Schembri, while even the retrained Jpy finally got a lift to trade up to 112.65 vs the Usd having held at 113.00 at the other end of the range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All firmer vs the Buck, but the Zar especially strong and breaching the psychological 14.5000 level, while the Yuan rebounded from recent lows amidst some conciliatory words from US President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi on trade, and the Czk maintained a bid following the CNB&rsquo;s 25 bp hike (via 5-2 vote, and with one dissenter calling for &frac12; point vs the dove wanting no change).</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, the Swedish Krona is outpacing its Norwegian peer amidst the aforementioned rebound in risk appetite, and both getting some additional impetus from firmer than forecast manufacturing PMIs, as Eur/Sek retreats through 10.3000 and Eur/Nok tests bids ahead of 9.5000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - A few negative/less bullish developments after Wednesday&rsquo;s Brexit boost, with Nationwide UK house prices slowing to multi-year lows, the manufacturing PMI considerably below consensus and the Brexit Ministry playing down reports about a deal being done and dusted for domestic financial services firms maintaining access to EU markets post-withdrawal, though progress towards an arrangement along &lsquo;equivalence&rsquo; lines seems certain.

In fact, options may also have aided the recovery with talk of double KO hedging at the big figure below and Eur/Usd is currently absorbing more supply in the 1.1370-80 zone. Elsewhere, the Franc has overcome a couple of obstacles in the form of benign, albeit in line with estimates Swiss CPI and a manufacturing PMI miss to join the overall revival against the Buck and is paring losses from circa 1.0090 towards 1.0030 ahead of SNB comments from Zurbrugg. The Loonie is also displaying resilience amidst another downturn in crude prices to test resistance at 1.3100 vs lows of 1.3170 or so at one stage in the run up to Canada&rsquo;s manufacturing PMI and BoC speeches (Wilkins and Schembri both scheduled).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Flat and rangy between 113.00-112.75 in contrast to other majors, but with decent expiry interest from 112.45-50 (1 bn) and better risk sentiment on balance likely to keep the headline pair underpinned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Regional currencies are all benefiting from the general Dollar pull-back, but with the Rand outperforming and testing offers/resistance ahead of 14.5000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.7%) and Brent (-1.0%) are lower with the complex extending on yesterday&rsquo;s losses over rising supply concerns; and subsequently comments from US President Trump that there is sufficient supply to allow for a significant reduction in purchases from Iran.

The 10 year German benchmark tripped stops once 160.06 gave way, but more when 160.00 and 159.96 were breached before 159.73 descending channel support held, while the Italian equivalent appeared to gather momentum on the President&rsquo;s seal of budget approval and only suffered a minor set-back on reports that the EU has already decided on EDP measure that will be implemented at the end of 2018. Elsewhere, Brexit denials and counters about a financial services accord and complete deal by November 21 have combined with a disappointing UK manufacturing PMI survey to push the main Liffe debt future up to 122.30, while US Treasuries are narrowly mixed to a tad weaker for choice ahead of a busy start to November in terms of stateside releases before tomorrow&rsquo;s BLP report.</p>\r\n",

The pan-European Stoxx 600 (+0.7%) is fuelled by earnings with the likes of BT (+10.2%), ASM (+15.0%) and Smith &amp; Nephew (+7.0%) all near the top of the index. In terms of sectors, energy names are lagging, in-fitting with the price action in the complex, while telecom names outperform after BT raised their EBITDA guidance. In terms of US earnings on the docket, traders will be keeping an eye on tech-giant Apple who are due to report after market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - All change for the Usd and index just a day after month end when the Greenback outperformed due to multiple bullish factors and the DXY finally breached 97.000 to register a fresh ytd peak of 97.201. However, a broad upturn in risk sentiment, portfolio re-positioning and some specific impulses have prompted a marked turnaround with the index back down to 96.510 ahead of a busy agenda before NFP on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/SEK/NOK - The clear G10 front-runners, or heading the widespread recovery charge vs the Usd, as the Kiwi tops 0.6600 with the aid of favourable cross-winds even though the Aud is testing stops around 0.7160 against its US counterpart and holding above 1.0800 within a 1.0820-75 range after significantly better than expected Aussie trade data overnight. Meanwhile, the Swedish Krona is outpacing its Norwegian peer amidst the aforementioned rebound in risk appetite, and both getting some additional impetus from firmer than forecast manufacturing PMIs, as Eur/Sek retreats through 10.3000 and Eur/Nok tests bids ahead of 9.5000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - A few negative/less bullish developments after Wednesday&rsquo;s Brexit boost, with Nationwide UK house prices slowing to multi-year lows, the manufacturing PMI considerably below consensus and the Brexit Ministry playing down reports about a deal being done and dusted for domestic financial services firms maintaining access to EU markets post-withdrawal, though progress towards an arrangement along &lsquo;equivalence&rsquo; lines seems certain. Hence, Cable is back under 1.2900 and through the 10 DMA (around 1.2873) having rallied over a key Fib (1.2911) to test the first line of offers seen between 1.2920-25, and with stops reputedly above 1.2930 on a break. Next up, BoE super Thursday from noon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/CAD - The single currency has staged a pretty impressive comeback from almost/virtually matching 2018 lows yesterday, and stopped just short of 1.1400 where mega option expiries lie (approx. 4 bn). In fact, options may also have aided the recovery with talk of double KO hedging at the big figure below and Eur/Usd is currently absorbing more supply in the 1.1370-80 zone. Elsewhere, the Franc has overcome a couple of obstacles in the form of benign, albeit in line with estimates Swiss CPI and a manufacturing PMI miss to join the overall revival against the Buck and is paring losses from circa 1.0090 towards 1.0030 ahead of SNB comments from Zurbrugg. The Loonie is also displaying resilience amidst another downturn in crude prices to test resistance at 1.3100 vs lows of 1.3170 or so at one stage in the run up to Canada&rsquo;s manufacturing PMI and BoC speeches (Wilkins and Schembri both scheduled). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Flat and rangy between 113.00-112.75 in contrast to other majors, but with decent expiry interest from 112.45-50 (1 bn) and better risk sentiment on balance likely to keep the headline pair underpinned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Regional currencies are all benefiting from the general Dollar pull-back, but with the Rand outperforming and testing offers/resistance ahead of 14.5000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative calm in core and non-core bonds after a flurry of activity and pretty pacey price action saw Bunds and Gilts lurch to fresh session lows at 159.75 and 121.97 (-51 and -44 ticks respectively), while BTPs spiked to a new intraday peak at 122.35 (+71 ticks). The 10 year German benchmark tripped stops once 160.06 gave way, but more when 160.00 and 159.96 were breached before 159.73 descending channel support held, while the Italian equivalent appeared to gather momentum on the President&rsquo;s seal of budget approval and only suffered a minor set-back on reports that the EU has already decided on EDP measure that will be implemented at the end of 2018. Elsewhere, Brexit denials and counters about a financial services accord and complete deal by November 21 have combined with a disappointing UK manufacturing PMI survey to push the main Liffe debt future up to 122.30, while US Treasuries are narrowly mixed to a tad weaker for choice ahead of a busy start to November in terms of stateside releases before tomorrow&rsquo;s BLP report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.7%) and Brent (-1.0%) are lower with the complex extending on yesterday&rsquo;s losses over rising supply concerns; and subsequently comments from US President Trump that there is sufficient supply to allow for a significant reduction in purchases from Iran. Analysts from Huatai stating that oil investors are now betting on the potential for a global slowdown. Additionally, Goldman Sachs have reiterated their year-end Brent forecast at USD 80/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.8%) prices have rebounded after hitting a 3-week low in the previous session, largely due to marginal dollar weakness. According to the World Gold Council, the yellow metal&rsquo;s Q3 global demand is slightly higher year-on-year. Elsewhere, aluminium hit a new two year low, following the weak Chinese PMIs on Wednesday and concerns over the US-Sino trade war&rsquo;s potential impact on global demand.</p>\r\n",

The 10 year German benchmark tripped stops once 160.06 gave way, but more when 160.00 and 159.96 were breached before 159.73 descending channel support held, while the Italian equivalent appeared to gather momentum on the President&rsquo;s seal of budget approval and only suffered a minor set-back on reports that the EU has already decided on EDP measure that will be implemented at the end of 2018. Elsewhere, Brexit denials and counters about a financial services accord and complete deal by November 21 have combined with a disappointing UK manufacturing PMI survey to push the main Liffe debt future up to 122.30, while US Treasuries are narrowly mixed to a tad weaker for choice ahead of a busy start to November in terms of stateside releases before tomorrow&rsquo;s BLP report.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All change for the Usd and index just a day after month end when the Greenback outperformed due to multiple bullish factors and the DXY finally breached 97.000 to register a fresh ytd peak of 97.201. However, a broad upturn in risk sentiment, portfolio re-positioning and some specific impulses have prompted a marked turnaround with the index back down to 96.510 ahead of a busy agenda before NFP on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clear G10 front-runners, or heading the widespread recovery charge vs the Usd, as the Kiwi tops 0.6600 with the aid of favourable cross-winds even though the Aud is testing stops around 0.7160 against its US counterpart and holding above 1.0800 within a 1.0820-75 range after significantly better than expected Aussie trade data overnight. Meanwhile, the Swedish Krona is outpacing its Norwegian peer amidst the aforementioned rebound in risk appetite, and both getting some additional impetus from firmer than forecast manufacturing PMIs, as Eur/Sek retreats through 10.3000 and Eur/Nok tests bids ahead of 9.5000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few negative/less bullish developments after Wednesday&rsquo;s Brexit boost, with Nationwide UK house prices slowing to multi-year lows, the manufacturing PMI considerably below consensus and the Brexit Ministry playing down reports about a deal being done and dusted for domestic financial services firms maintaining access to EU markets post-withdrawal, though progress towards an arrangement along &lsquo;equivalence&rsquo; lines seems certain. Hence, Cable is back under 1.2900 and through the 10 DMA (around 1.2873) having rallied over a key Fib (1.2911) to test the first line of offers seen between 1.2920-25, and with stops reputedly above 1.2930 on a break. Next up, BoE super Thursday from noon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has staged a pretty impressive comeback from almost/virtually matching 2018 lows yesterday, and stopped just short of 1.1400 where mega option expiries lie (approx. 4 bn). In fact, options may also have aided the recovery with talk of double KO hedging at the big figure below and Eur/Usd is currently absorbing more supply in the 1.1370-80 zone. Elsewhere, the Franc has overcome a couple of obstacles in the form of benign, albeit in line with estimates Swiss CPI and a manufacturing PMI miss to join the overall revival against the Buck and is paring losses from circa 1.0090 towards 1.0030 ahead of SNB comments from Zurbrugg. The Loonie is also displaying resilience amidst another downturn in crude prices to test resistance at 1.3100 vs lows of 1.3170 or so at one stage in the run up to Canada&rsquo;s manufacturing PMI and BoC speeches (Wilkins and Schembri both scheduled). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flat and rangy between 113.00-112.75 in contrast to other majors, but with decent expiry interest from 112.45-50 (1 bn) and better risk sentiment on balance likely to keep the headline pair underpinned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regional currencies are all benefiting from the general Dollar pull-back, but with the Rand outperforming and testing offers/resistance ahead of 14.5000.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia is said to freeze fuel prices at June levels. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The global risk-on theme resulted in lower Treasury prices, with yields rising by between 3-4bps at settlement. The bias was towards a slightly, slightly steeper curve, though the moves were modest at best at beneath 1bps. A solid ADP report helped support the rise in yields. In its quarterly refunding announcement, the US Treasury said it will sell USD 37bln in 3yr, USD 27bln in 10yr and USD 19bln in 30yr notes, all in line with expectations, and is to offer a new 5yr TIPS in Oct. 2019. Wells Fargo suggests that there are three key takeaways from today&#39;s refunding announcement: &quot;First, it appears Treasury is fairly comfortable with how the nominal coupon auction schedule is shaping up to meet the FY 2019 financing needs. Second, Treasury remains committed to keeping total bills outstanding on an upward trajectory. Finally, even with the smaller increases to nominal coupon auctions than we expected, there will likely still be an onslaught of net coupon issuance in CY 2019&quot;. US T-notes futures (Z8) settled 11 ticks lower at 118-14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said the US has a chance of making a fair deal with China, while he also commented that equity markets are waiting for the midterms which he suggested will fall if Democrats win and will rise if GOP wins.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mostly higher as the region sustained the momentum from Wall St where stocks continued to pare back some of the losses from its worst monthly performance in 7 years, helped on the day by month-end rebalancing and with sentiment also underpinned by strong jobs data as well as a rally across FAANG stocks post-Facebook earnings beat. ASX 200 (+0.2%) was lifted by early outperformance in the mining sector as BHP shares gained on the announcement of a USD 10.4bln shareholder return program, although upside was capped by indecisiveness across financials amid less than inspiring NAB results and M&amp;A hopes with Macquarie said to be mulling an offer for AMP Capital. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) was pressured by the recent currency strength and with much of the focus on earnings, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) and Hang Seng (+1.8%) outperformed following the better than expected Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI data and continued supportive efforts by Chinese authorities.<br />Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower with yields higher across the curve after the BoJ tweaked its monthly bond purchases in which it cut the number of occasions it will buy 1-3yr and 3-5yr JGBs to just 4 times from 5 times per month, although firmer demand at the 10yr auction helped stem losses.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as the region sustains the momentum from Wall St where stocks continued to pare back some of the losses from its worst monthly performance in 7 years, helped on the day by month-end rebalancing and with sentiment also underpinned by strong jobs data as well as a rally across FAANG stocks post-Facebook earnings beat. ASX 200 (+0.1%) is led higher by the mining sector after BHP shares gained on the announcement of a USD 10.4bln shareholder return program and with financials also remaining afloat despite the less than inspiring NAB results, as M&amp;A news provides optimism with Macquarie said to be mulling an offer for AMP Capital. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) is negative but off intraday lows as exporters attempt to shrug-off the recent currency strength and with earnings in focus, while Shanghai Comp. (+1.1%) and Hang Seng (+1.3%) are positive alongside the broad appetite for risk and following the better than expected Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is softer overnight and has pulled back below the 97.00 level as its major counterparts make up for lost ground, with GBP/USD the outperformer after reports that UK PM May reached a tentative agreement with Brussels which would grant UK financial companies access to European markets post-Brexit. This lifted the pair back above 1.2800 and helped EUR/USD nurse losses, while antipodeans also firmed on their high-beta status and with AUD/USD underpinned by a larger than expected trade surplus. Conversely, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are mixed with USD/JPY reeling from the prior day&rsquo;s flows into the JPY amid rising yields in Japan following an adjustment in the BoJ&rsquo;s bond purchases</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as yields increase across the curve after the BoJ tweaked its monthly bond purchases in which it cut the number of occasions it will buy 1-3yr and 3-5yr JGBs to just 4 times from 5 times per month.</p>\r\n",
