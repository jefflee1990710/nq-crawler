        "subject": "Daily FX-Wrap: Sterling pounded, ARS up ahead of IMF talks; big week for USD",
        "content": "<p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>ING notes the complex could come under pressure this week, as US traders return from the Labor Day holiday. On this week&#39;s docket: Will Argentina get an expedited IMF deal on Tuesday? After the consultation period expires on Thursday, will US President Trump decide to impose 25% tariffs on a further $200bln of Chinese imports? On Friday, the latest Employment Situation Report will be published, and ING argues that the conditions seem to be in place for another week of USD strength versus EMFX.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRY: </strong>But with that said, TRY saw strength on Monday - shrugging-off surging inflation - after the central bank said it would adjust its monetary stance at its policy meeting next week, adding that recent developments surrounding the inflation outlook pose significant risks to price stability. The Turkish finmin also weighed in, pledging to step in to support banks if the sell-off in the Lira necessitates such support.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ARS: </strong>Ahead of talks with the IMF on Tuesday to negotiate an early disbursement of funds, Argentine policymakers have signalled an intent to sing from the IMF&#39;s hymnn sheet, President Macri said Argentina will tax exports to boost revenues, adding that the country cannot spend more money than it has. The finmin was also on the wires, and argued that the peso was oversold considering the country&#39;s fundamentals. Nvertheless, the right noises were being made, and the ARS bucked the trend in EMFX, to trade stronger against the buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Brexit headline risk is showing its face once again, and GBP 1m implied vols hit highest in almost six months, as sterling slid after the weekend&#39;s op-ed penned by UK PM May in the Telegraph ruling out a second Brexit referendum, while elsewhere, the Times reported that Tory rebels are planning to derail May&#39;s &#39;Chequers plan&#39;, and the FT reported that former Brexit minister Davis would vote against the plan, raising the prospect of a Parliamentary defeat for PM May. The Chequers plan was also attacked from the EU front, with the bloc&#39;s chief negotiator Barnier telling German press that the proposal was not workable and that the UK should make more compromises. RBC&#39;s analysts noted stressed that the process towards an agreement between the UK and the EU is poorly understood and that the &#39;no deal&#39; option is the default option. The bank continues to see more risks of this scenario gaining in prominence and being further priced into markets. On the data front, a weak manufacturing PMI added to the downside, with some analysts concerned that the export component slipped below 50 for the first time in two years; survey compiler Markit said &quot;although there were some reports of softer growth of new work from the domestic market, the main drag was the trend in new export orders.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie saw downside in quiet, thin trade, despite markets being shut for Labor Day, with US President Trump&#39;s weekend NAFTA comments that &quot;there is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal. If we don&rsquo;t make a fair deal for the US after decades of abuse, Canada will be out&quot;. Negotiations are set to resume on Wednesday, but Trump has already notified Congress of his intention to sign a deal with Mexico within 90 days, regardless of whether a deal with Canada has been reached, or not.&nbsp;<br />boc</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Overnight retail sales data were flat, but in sync with a weaker tone of incoming data; within the retail sales data the gap between small retailers and their larger (and listed) counterparts narrowed after the former was up and the latter fell; but combined with the business inventories data (though Q2 company profits were up), and Corelogic house prices falling, some desks cut their GDP tracking estimates (UBS cut its view by 0.1ppts). The Aussie had a offered tone, but bounced off multi-year lows 0.7145-0.7165 in European trade after positive news on the EM front (Turkey&#39;s central bank pledging to adjust its monetary stance, amid some constructive comments from fiscal authorities), which drove a bout of USD weakness. Overnight, the RBA is expected to stand pat on rates, which could be one of the more boring central bank updates this week, though focus will be on comments relating to the RBA&#39;s hiking trajectory. UBS said that given how far Aussie has come, short-term moves will be a function of positioning. &quot;Aussie is down 2.5% in the last four trading sessions and should take a breather at some stage, the market has still not reversed long AUD/NZD cross positions which opens for a final stab towards 1.0750-80, a near term-break of 1.0940-50 now requires re-evaluation.&quot; UBS says a potential move lower in the cross, should open up for a test of AUDUSD towards 0.7100-20 but that&#39;s where the buck may stop in the short-term, before taking a breather.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Softer-than-expected UK manufacturing PMI gave the GBP another leg lower, providing further support to the index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy names outperform, in-line with the recent price action in the complex, while consumer discretionary names lag, weighed on by German auto names amid reports an increase in US auto import tariff would cost German carmakers EUR 7bln per annum in revenues. In terms of individual movers, SBM Offshore shares spiked higher by 11.3% at the open after the Co. reached a final settlement on Saturday with MPF over alleged improper sales practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Already weak after a damning assessment of the Chequers White Paper by EU&rsquo;s Barmier, the Pound has been further undermined by a weak UK manufacturing PMI, with Cable back below 1.2900 and prone to a further retreat towards technical support around 1.2852, while Eur/Gbp rebounds to just over 0.9000, ahead of chart resistance circa 0.9030-35 and the late August near 12 month peak just shy of 0.9100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - Conversely, Aud/Usd has reclaimed 0.7200+ status (albeit marginally) and 1.0900 vs the NZD on the back of less risk averse sentiment overall and a broadly softer Greenback in thin US Labor Day holiday trade. Note, the Aud was weaker overnight amidst mixed Aussie data in the form of a retail sales miss vs higher Q2 company profits, while the Kiwi is straddling 0.6600 vs its US peer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CAD/CHF - All narrowly mixed vs the Usd with the single currency pivoting 1.1600 and not really moving on somewhat divergent Eurozone manufacturing PMIs, while Usd/Jpy is equally constrained either side of 111.00 and the Loonie around 1.3050 having fallen on NAFTA disappointment (no deal on Friday between Canada and the US, with talks to resume Wednesday when the BoC meets). For choice, the Franc is lagging circa 0.9700 vs the Usd after a drop in Swiss retail sales and despite a decent pick up in the manufacturing PMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Dawdling within tight 95.000-230 trading parameters, and largely dependent on indirect impulses/drivers given the aforementioned US market holiday until a scheduled speech from Fed&rsquo;s Evans that may provide some independent impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Try has been especially volatile around Turkish inflation data that saw CPI accelerate further and prompt a swift CBRT response flagging a policy adjustment at next Thursday&rsquo;s meeting and pledge to use all tools available to restore price stability. The Lira rebounded from 6.7300 lows vs the Usd to 6.5075, but has lost some recovery momentum even though the Finance Minister seemed to &lsquo;approve&rsquo; of the Central Bank&rsquo;s tightening signal, awaiting to see how much official rates are hiked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh Liffe intraday peaks for the 10 year debt future and a little more outperformance vs core bond peers on a weaker than forecast manufacturing PMI that has also lifted UK STIR contracts 1-2 ticks further above previous closes. Gilts just topped out at 122.53 (+20 ticks vs -14 ticks at one stage) vs Bunds only 5 ticks ahead at a marginal new Eurex high of 163.32. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain underwater and the curve is steeper, but a decent 10k lot clip was bought in the Dec 10 year future at 120-06+ recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent trade in the green, nursing some overnight losses, with the former eyeing USD 70/bbl to the upside amid comments from a few oil officials. The Nigerian Energy Minister stated he is comfortable with oil prices around the mid-70s, while an Omani oil official noted some OPEC+ states have trouble reaching their own output quotas, while adding oil prices may rise to USD 90/bbl due to a lack of investments leading to shortfalls. Elsewhere, gold benefits from a domino effect caused by the Turkish Central Bank, whose comments sparked some TRY strength, in turn weighing on the USD.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already weak after a damning assessment of the Chequers White Paper by EU&rsquo;s Barmier, the Pound has been further undermined by a weak UK manufacturing PMI, with Cable back below 1.2900 and prone to a further retreat towards technical support around 1.2852, while Eur/Gbp rebounds to just over 0.9000, ahead of chart resistance circa 0.9030-35 and the late August near 12 month peak just shy of 0.9100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, Aud/Usd has reclaimed 0.7200+ status (albeit marginally) and 1.0900 vs the NZD on the back of less risk averse sentiment overall and a broadly softer Greenback in thin US Labor Day holiday trade. Note, the Aud was weaker overnight amidst mixed Aussie data in the form of a retail sales miss vs higher Q2 company profits, while the Kiwi is straddling 0.6600 vs its US peer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Usd with the single currency pivoting 1.1600 and not really moving on somewhat divergent Eurozone manufacturing PMIs, while Usd/Jpy is equally constrained either side of 111.00 and the Loonie around 1.3050 having fallen on NAFTA disappointment (no deal on Friday between Canada and the US, with talks to resume Wednesday when the BoC meets). For choice, the Franc is lagging circa 0.9700 vs the Usd after a drop in Swiss retail sales and despite a decent pick up in the manufacturing PMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dawdling within tight 95.000-230 trading parameters, and largely dependent on indirect impulses/drivers given the aforementioned US market holiday until a scheduled speech from Fed&rsquo;s Evans that may provide some independent impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Try has been especially volatile around Turkish inflation data that saw CPI accelerate further and prompt a swift CBRT response flagging a policy adjustment at next Thursday&rsquo;s meeting and pledge to use all tools available to restore price stability. The Lira rebounded from 6.7300 lows vs the Usd to 6.5075, but has lost some recovery momentum even though the Finance Minister seemed to &lsquo;approve&rsquo; of the Central Bank&rsquo;s tightening signal, awaiting to see how much official rates are hiked.</p>\r\n",
