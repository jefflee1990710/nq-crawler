The broad USD strength weighed on precious metals with gold falling over 0.5%, while reports that Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump Organisation prompted some weakness in the USD, although the pressure was relatively short-lived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR was subdued as markets continued to digest the recent comments from ECB members, including Wednesday&rsquo;s dovish comments from Draghi, while ECB&rsquo;s Villeroy mentioned that the ECB had made progress on inflation but wouldn&rsquo;t pre-commit to timing on QE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP was choppy as markets digest various Brexit related comments. Brexit minister Davis said that a transition period would be based on existing arrangements, ahead of next week&rsquo;s EU Summit. There&rsquo;s a number of large risk events for the currency next week including the BoE decision, inflation &amp; labour market data, as well as the EU Summit where the UK hopes to agree a transition period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY traded in a relatively tight range but USD/JPY again briefly traded with a 105 handle despite the dollar strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD Weakened in the wake of GDP data which missed expectations at 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.8%, breaking through the 0.7300 level to the downside. Elsewhere, despite Trump giving Australia an exemption from the tariffs on steel and aluminium, trade war concerns continue to weigh on the AUD which dropped below 0.7800 against the USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF was little changed following central bank interest rate decision that maintained rates and downgraded inflation expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD weakened on the lowest existing home sales figures for 5 years which saw USD/CAD trip stops through the 1.30 level to a 9-month high of 1.3066, finding resistance at a key fib level of 1.3066.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK saw a significant move past the 200DMA 9.53 level in EURNOK after the Norges Bank brought forward the timing of possible rate hikes from Autumn 2018 to Summer 2018 (with August or September highlighted). Whilst interest rates remained unchanged this struck a more hawkish tone that displays a confidence in the Scandinavian economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norges Bank Rate Decision 0.50% vs. Exp. 0.50% (Prev. 0.50%)<br />Norges Bank said it sees rate hike after summer 2018 vs. Prev. after autumn 2018 and stated that the Norwegian economy suggests that it will soon be appropriate to raise the key policy rate.

A slight downtick was observed on the news that Special Counsel Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump organisation seeking Russia documents, which dented risk sentiment. Reports that Walmart had issued misleading e-commerce results gave further impetus to the downtick.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>USD </strong>Strengthened with the continual fall of the EUR contributing to the strength of the dollar, leading to the DXY pushing through the 90.000 level. The broad USD strength helped weigh on precious metals with gold falling over 0.5%.&nbsp; The reports that Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump Organisation prompted some dollar weakness but the move was relatively short-lived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>EUR </strong>Weakness in the single currency was observed as markets continue to digest the recent comments from ECB members, including Wednesday&rsquo;s dovish comments from Draghi. ECB&rsquo;s Villeroy mentioned that the ECB had made progress on inflation but wouldn&rsquo;t pre-commit to timing on QE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CHF </strong>Little moves noted in CHF following central bank interest rate decision that maintained rates and downgraded inflation expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>NZD </strong>&amp; <strong>AUD </strong>NZD Weakened in the wake of GDP data which missed expectations at 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.8%, breaking through the 0.7300 level to the downside. Despite Trump giving Australia an exemption from the tariffs on steel and aluminium, trade war concerns continue to weigh on the AUD which dropped below 0.7800 against the USD.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>GBP </strong>was choppy as markets digest various Brexit related comments. Brexit minister Davis said that a transition period would be based on existing arrangements, ahead of next week&rsquo;s EU Summit. There&rsquo;s a number of large risk events for GBP traders next week including the BoE decision, inflation &amp; labour market&nbsp; data, as well as the EU Summit where the UK hopes to agree a transition period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CAD </strong>lowest existing home sales figures for 5 years lent some weakness to the CAD where USD/CAD tripped stops through the 1.30 level to a 9-month high of 1.3066, finding resistance at a key fib level of 1.3066.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>NOK </strong>saw a significant move past the 200DMA 9.53 level in EURNOK after the Norges Bank brought forward the timing of possible rate hikes from Autumn 2018 to Summer 2018 (with August or September highlighted). Whilst interest rates remained unchanged this struck a more hawkish tone that displays a confidence in the Scandinavian economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>JPY </strong>traded in a relatively tight range but USD/JPY again briefly traded with a 105 handle despite the dollar strength.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>Treasuries </strong>: 10 YEAR T-NOTE FUTURES (JUNE 2018) SETTLES DOWN 1.5 TICKS AT 120.60. Bear flattening was observed with the short-end underperforming&nbsp; in the curve. A bid was observed after the Mueller subpoena news hit wires but overall volumes were relatively light and liquidity thin. IFR notes that this trend could continue leading up to the Fed rate decision on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>Crude&nbsp; </strong>experienced choppy trading though Thursday, rising amid the small gains in stocks. The IEA monthly report echoed that Wednesday&rsquo;s OPEC report as they expect demand to pick up this year but noted supply is also increasing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The Dollar has emerged as the pm session outperformer and broad gainer vs most G10 counterparts bar the safe haven Jpy (still pivoting around 106.00) and Brexit boosted Gbp (Cable back up near 1.4000, and Eur/Gbp easing towards 0.8800) after more reports that a transition deal between the UK and EU is close at hand. Usd/Cad has hit fresh 2018 highs above 1.3000 (circa 1.3045) with additional impetus to flog the Loonie coming from very weak Canadian housing data (that overshadowed a firmer ADP read, which itself has been upstaged by last Friday&rsquo;s official jobs report) and remarks from the Mexican Economy Minister regarding NAFTA (basically saying that the US can be left out of the trade accord). Next bullish target for Usd/Cad is a Fib at 1.3066 before 1.3100, while Usd/Mxn is looking firmer above 18.5000 and its 200 DMA. The Aud and Nzd also extended losses vs the Greenback amidst more inflammatory remarks between the US and China on protectionist policies and with the Kiwi still feeling the adverse effects of NZ&rsquo;s GDP data miss overnight &ndash; Aud/Usd edging closer to 0.7800 and Nzd/Usd back below 0.7300. Note, the US admin also extended/expanded sanctions vs Russia after the UK on Wednesday and Russia plans to retaliate as it has to the UK &ndash; Usd/Rub rallying as a result. Eur/Usd still relatively steady despite slipping to around 1.2325 at one stage, and perhaps finding some option expiry-related support as 1 bn ran-off between 1.2335-50. Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf remained elevated, and the former inched a bit closer to 0.9500 again on latest Franc highly overvalued assessments from the SNB, but the Nok only lost some of its hawkish Norges Bank momentum to trade back at 9.5000+ vs the Eur (only just) after Governor Olson said only 1 hike is likely this year.

Indeed, Bunds are having another look at 158.00 after topping out just ahead on Wednesday and the next bullish objective is 158.19 vs 158.09 at best so far (+15 ticks vs -13 ticks at the Eurex low). However, Gilts are still lagging despite a solid if not stellar DMO auction, though have just climbed into positive territory at 121.99 (+4 ticks vs -22 ticks at worst) and could test resistance just above 122.00. Elsewhere, UST futures remain firm following disappointing retail sales data against the backdrop of trade/protectionism policy wars.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Aside from the usual suspects (global trade wars and President Trump&rsquo;s White House staff reshuffling), 2 Central Bank policy meetings were in focus, and while the SNB trimmed its inflation forecasts virtually everything else remained unchanged from the previous quarterly assessment. Hence, Eur/Chf was essentially static and rangebound between 1.1680-1.1700, while Usd/Chf held within a 0.9460-35 range despite broader Usd weakness (Usd/Jpy sub-106.00 and DXY still under 90.000). However, the Norges Bank more than lived up to hawkish expectations by bringing forward its hike forecast to after Summer from after Autumn in December, and more precisely August or September, according to Governor Olsen. 2018 non-oil GDP is now seen at 2.6% vs 2.3%, and the output gap closing quicker, so inflation also to target sooner (now 2% vs 2.5% prior to March 2<sup>nd</sup>). Eur/Nok duly dumped, albeit somewhat belatedly, through the 200DMA at 9.5300, then bids at 9.5000 and down to around 9.4746. Elsewhere, Eur/Usd was rangy from 1.2350-85, while Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are softer after the former failed to sustain 0.7900+ levels on Wednesday and following weaker than anticipated NZ GDP data overnight. Conversely, Cable fell quite sharply and abruptly, with Eur/Gbp rallying around the same time on nothing obvious, so perhaps order/flow/stop-related rather than fundamental. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are mostly lower as region mirrors the rout seen on Wall St. where the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA posted a 3<sup>rd</sup> consecutive day of losses amid ongoing trade war concerns and disappointing Retail Sales data. ASX 200 (-0.1%) has been led lower by continued weakness in financials and energy sectors, while Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) is pressured by JPY strength and as political woes continue to cloud over Japan with former tax chief Sagawa to possibly testify as soon as next week on the cronyism/government land sale scandal. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) are also in the red, although losses are contained amid outperformance in Shenzhen and with some also suggesting that free-trade advocate Larry Kudlow&rsquo;s appointment as the new National Economic Council Director to be a more favourable scenario for China in comparison than other touted hardliner candidates, despite Kudlow already stepping up his rhetoric on China in his first interview since being chosen for the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, DXY remains lacklustre and below the 90.00 level amid ongoing US-China trade tensions, which has marginally benefitted its major counterparts on what has been a relatively uneventful session so far for currencies. Elsewhere, the subdued greenback and safe-haven flows into JPY pressured USD/JPY below the 106.00 handle and saw similar weakness in JPY-crosses, while NZD/USD was choppy with initial pressure seen after New Zealand GDP data missed expectations, before the pair later recovered on the back of a softer USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with only marginal support seen from the dampened global risk appetite and with demand lacking as participants await today&rsquo;s 20yr auction. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
