Top sectors: IT +2.5%, Utilities +2.2%, Healthcare +1.5%. Bottom sectors: Energy -0.3%, Cons Stap +0.2%, Cons Disc +0.7%. In early trade, sour sentiment and concerns about the valuation of equities extended, lining stocks up for another grim end to the week. However, in afternoon trade, the DJIA and SPX fell to test their 200d MA, which neither could meaningfully break beneath. The result was an immediate improvement in sentiment and buyers emerged, pushing stocks up to erase losses for the day. The run-in to the close was choppy, however, and gains appeared fragile. The weekly stats, however, still look grim, with the SPX off by over 5% in the week, straddling the 2600 handle as we close out trade. However, Friday&rsquo;s gains have taken at least some of the sting out of the gains, and technical analysts were encouraged by the fact that the 200d MA held its ground when tested. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREASURIES:&nbsp;US T-Note futures settle 9 ticks higher at 121-05+.

At settlement, 2s10s were steeper by c.5bps, 2s30s wider by c5bps, 5s30s steeper by c.3bps. Fixed income traders were happy to look through the budget deal reached by US lawmakers, despite the assumption that it will likely see issuance increased, likely weighing on prices. Given the sharp rise seen in bond yields over the last few weeks &ndash; which many have attributed it to better inflation prospects, solid growth, and a Fed which may hike &frac34; times in 2018 &ndash; attention next week will be on US CPI data to assess how widespread inflation pressures are.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU plans the next round of Brexit talks for 26 February.

Another read might be that the greenback was merely tracking a steepening UST yield curve. On Friday, however, it was supported as lawmakers reached the budget deal. The established havens &ndash; JPY and CHF &ndash; were mixed on Friday, however, with the yen gaining against its US counterpart, eyeing the 108.50 handle, though USDCHF was higher on the day, though capped by 0.94 (EURCHF found a bid despite a weaker EURUSD). The performance of EMFX continues to suggest that the contagion from the stock slide is limited, with the ZAR and MXN making ground against the USD on Friday, though the TRY and BRL didn&rsquo;t fare as well. Gold, meanwhile, is the victim of a steepening curve &ndash; while it generally held its value amid Monday&rsquo;s slide, gains were given up after Tuesday&rsquo;s stabilisation; but even as stocks were under pressure today, gold could not manage to rally above the key $1320 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa Ruling ANC party panel Is said to meet this Monday regarding President Zuma&rsquo;s exit.

Benchmarks are set to print the largely weekly falls seen in two years, with WTI slipping beneath $60, extending its slump to six sessions; today&rsquo;s catalyst was the sour risk mood in early trade (and even when risk sentiment improved after stocks successfully bounced off of 200d MA, oil struggled to rally), as well as Ineos ramping up crude supply along the Forties pipeline quicker than was anticipated. Perhaps crude struggled to rally as risk improved due to oil drillers adding 26 rigs in the week pushing the rig count to the highest since Jan 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count W/W 975 (Prev. 946).
