(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said protectionism is not a solution and the wrong measures of the US have raised concerns of the international community. The Foreign Ministry added that there have been no negotiations with the US and that the US is to blame for the trade friction (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda reiterated will continue with powerful easing to achieve target and that inflation is still a distant from the target, while he also said he told PM Abe the BoJ will do the utmost to reach the 2% target as quick as possible. Furthermore, BoJ Governor Kuroda said he is confident the BoJ can smoothly engineer exit from easy policy but added the economy is yet to reach timing for BoJ to reveal exit strategy, while he also noted that central banks must be aware about the impact of prolonged easing via conventional or non-conventional monetary policy. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Coeure (neutral) noted the ECB is to discuss timing of QE soon and also commented that growth outlook is not a warrant to modify current monetary policy stance. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Praet (dove) said data suggests there is no need to change the ECB&#39;s outlook, while he also stated ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary and that inflation remains subdued. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU exploring counter-measures to US aluminium tariffs, according to trade body European Aluminium. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FX<a name=\"_Hlk503148913\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148890\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148850\"></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk507704203\">DXY was lower against most majors on Monday, falling beneath the 90.000 figure. Weakness was exacerbated slightly in late trade after the CBO raised deficit forecasts, but the focus overall remained on the wider geopolitical/trade wars narrative. Attention is on overnight comments from China&rsquo;s President Xi, to see whether there is any follow through on China&rsquo;s tough retaliatory talk. USD focussed traders are also mindful of the FOMC meeting minutes and CPI data, both on the slate for Wednesday.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR price action was mainly dictated by the USD side of the pair, with EURUSD continuing to strengthen slightly in wake of the NFP report on Friday. The 1.23 level is proving sticky, and the pair finds itself consolidating just above the level heading into APAC (1.2310-1.2330).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY was ignoring US yields (higher) as well as the positive sentiment among equity traders (equities up). USDJPY traded in the middle of its recent range (recent range: 106.30 to 107.80; today&rsquo;s range 106.75 to 107.20), though the bias seems towards the down-side in late US trading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP was consolidating around 1.41 against the greenback, before a bout of USD weakness helped with a push towards 1.4160. Wednesday&rsquo;s data dump is in vogue, as well as a host of BOE policymakers due to speak in the week. Analysts cite short-term resistance under 1.40 (50dma) and the March high (mid 1.42s) are resistance on the top-side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD traded higher, with USDCAD falling to 1.27 after the BOC&rsquo;s business outlook survey, which hints at price pressures ahead, though the survey did suggest that GDP growth will slow to below potential this year, which may have caused BOC officials to shift uncomfortably in their seats. The BOC is not expected to adjust rates at its April meeting next week; markets are not fully pricing in a hike until September, while there is only a 20% chance of a hike next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD shrugged-off early concerns about trade wars/geopolitics to move higher as USD was sold near the cash open. The tone of US policymakers seems to be framing trade wars as a negotiating tactic. NZD action was similar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a lot of news directly driving crude prices on Monday, with oil takings its cue from the general risk tone, and equities (both firm). Geopolitical concerns are dominating the thoughts of traders; the Iranian President today warned that US President Trump would regret pulling out of the nuclear deal, promising a strong response if the US re-applied sanctions on Iran. There are also whispers of potential military action in the Middle East after US policymakers refused to rule out the option when asked about Syria; Trump said a US response would come within 48 hours. Elsewhere, one potential source of support was removed after Norway&rsquo;s labour union called off strike action after agreeing a new wage deal. In terms of inventories, analysts expect crude stocks to build by 200k barrels in the week, Cushing is seen building by 1.5mln, distillates are expected to draw 400k barrels, and gasoline is seen drawing by 1.4mln barrels. Front WTI futures settled $1.36 higher at $63.42/bbl; front Brent settled $1.54 higher at $68.65/bbl.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump condemned the reported chemical attack in Syria and stated that the US is to make decision on next step in 24-48 hours, while Trump also suggested a decision may come by the end of today and did not rule out military action. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley stated the US &lsquo;will respond&rsquo; to Syria&rsquo;s chemical attack irrespective of the UN security council intervention. However, there were also comments from the Russian UN envoy that the US has been warned by Moscow that military action in Syria could lead to &quot;grave repercussions&quot;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump lawyer Cohen was raided by the FBI under referral from Special Counsel Mueller in which the FBI seized documents relating to tax and businesses records, as well as info regarding payments to Stormy Daniels. However, reports later stated that it was unclear if the FBI raid on Trump lawyer Michael Cohen&#39;s office is related or not to Mueller investigation or Stormy Daniels, according to a source. (Newswires/CBS)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said that we are &#39;fairly close&#39; on NAFTA, while he also commented that if China hits US farmers, then the US will make it up to the farmers. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NEC Director Kudlow is said to be optimistic about trade talks, although does not know if US will impose China tariffs or not, while he also commented that progress is being made in renegotiating NAFTA. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Chief of Staff Kelly could leave by the summer. (Fox Business)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>MARKET RECAP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures rebounded over the weekend from Friday trade following efforts from the US to alleviate trade concerns; US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stated the US is willing to negotiate, but Trump is prepared to defend US interests. Healthcare and Technology led today&rsquo;s US cash market, with Merck (MRK) leading the DJ closing over 5% higher as its phase 3 Keynote trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival. In M&amp;A news sources reported Viacom (VIAB) asked CBS (CBS) to raise its merger offer by $2.8bln, with CBS still waiting to respond, however, an unnamed CBS investor has asked the company to not pay above market price for Viacom. Elsewhere, WSJ citing sources said US DoJ is to approve Bayer&rsquo;s (BAYN GY) acquisition of Monsanto (MON) after the two make concessions. SPX +0.34% at 2613, NDX +0.61% at 6472, DJI +0.2% at 23980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Treasury yields rose modestly on Monday, curve spreads were narrower by between 1bps and 2bps at settlement. While there were lingering concerns about trade wars/geopolitics, volumes and yields were within Friday&rsquo;s range. Losses were trimmed in the US afternoon, following the CBO budget and economic outlook report, which forecast higher deficits on the back of GOP spending plans. The US Treasury will sell $64bln in 3s/10s/30s this week; with $76.5bln maturing at mid-month, the Treasury will be paying down some $12.5bln. US 10-Year T-Note Futures settle 3+ ticks lower at 120-29.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: Stocks up despite trade wars/geopolitics ",
        "content": "<p><strong>*SNAPSHOT:</strong> Stocks up, USD lower, treasuries lower, oil higher<br /><strong>*REAR-VIEW: </strong>Syria chemical attack, Russian sanctions, BoC Survey &amp; ECB speak<strong> </strong><br /><strong>*AHEAD: </strong>President Xi Jinping to speak, Fed/ECB/BoE speak (Tues)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS: </strong>China President Xi Jinping will deliver comments to the Boao Conference overnight (the Asian version of Davos), and attention will be on comments relating to trade wars. China is said to be considering a gradual devaluation of the yuan, which put upward pressure on USDCNH; other unconfirmed sources have suggested that China has already halted US Treasury purchases, which would be seen as a strong escalation of trade wars. There seems to be a consensus growing around the idea that the US&rsquo; tough stance is a negotiating tactic design to bring Chinese concessions. US NEC Director Kudlow expressed optimism around trade talks today and said he was unsure whether the US will impose China tariffs or not. (Over the weekend, WSJ reported that the USTR was already exchanging letters with Chinese economic envoys on measures that China could take to avert a trade war).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA:</strong> Despite reports suggesting that no deal &lsquo;in principle&rsquo; is likely to be announced at the Summit of Americas this week, there were further constructive comments from US officials on the progress of NAFTA talks; Trump said partners are &lsquo;fairly close&rsquo; to a deal, while NEC Director Kudlow also noted progress was being made. The Mexicans, meanwhile, said there were no conditions to reach a NAFTA deal this week, adding that there was an 80% chance that NAFTA parties could reach an agreement in principle by the first week of May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Last week&rsquo;s US sanctions hit Russian assets on Monday. Following on from weekend tough talk, on Monday, US President Trump suggested that Russia may have been responsible in the Syrian chemical weapons attack &ndash; which has been described by humanitarian organisations as a war crime &ndash; and the US was considering what action to take, with a decision due within 48 hours; military action has not been ruled out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>At the release of the central bank&rsquo;s 2017 annual report, ECB president <strong>Draghi</strong> said he is confident that inflation will move higher, but is uncertain about the degree of economic slack that remains. Draghi added that the recent stock market slide has not had an impact on broader financial conditions. ECB VP <strong>Constancio</strong> largely repeated previous comments that deflationary risks have vanished, though inflation has not responded as the ECB has desired. The central bank&rsquo;s chief economist <strong>Praet</strong> emphasised data dependence, arguing that an ample degree of stimulus was still required, noting that inflation remains subdued and that there was no reason to change the ECB&rsquo;s outlook. ECB&rsquo;s <strong>Coeure</strong>, meanwhile, said the growth outlook does not warrant any modifications to the ECB&rsquo;s current policy stance, elsewhere adding that the timing of QE exit will be discussed soon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX +0.34% at 2613, NDX +0.61% at 6472, DJI +0.2% at 23980<br />* SECTORS: CONS CYC (XLY): -0.25%, CONS NON-CYC (XLP): -0.19%, ENERGY (XLE): +0.47%, FINANCIALS (XLF): +0.50%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +0.93%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): -0.34%, MATERIALS (XLB): +0.52%, TECH (XLK): +0.78%, TELECOMS (XTL): -1.17%, UTLITIES (XLU): +0.12%. </strong><br />US equity futures rebounded over the weekend from Friday trade following efforts from the US to alleviate trade concerns; US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stated the US is willing to negotiate, but Trump is prepared to defend US interests. Healthcare and Technology led today&rsquo;s US cash market, with Merck (MRK) leading the DJ closing over 5% higher as its phase 3 Keynote trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival. In M&amp;A news sources reported Viacom (VIAB) asked CBS (CBS) to raise its merger offer by $2.8bln, with CBS still waiting to respond, however, an unnamed CBS investor has asked the company to not pay above market price for Viacom. Elsewhere, WSJ citing sources said US DoJ is to approve Bayer&rsquo;s (BAYN GY) acquisition of Monsanto (MON) after the two make concessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: US 10-Year T-Note Futures settle 3+ ticks lower at 120-29. </strong>Although Treasury yields rose modestly on Monday, curve spreads were narrower by between 1bps and 2bps at settlement. While there were lingering concerns about trade wars/geopolitics, volumes and yields were within Friday&rsquo;s range. Losses were trimmed in the US afternoon, following the CBO budget and economic outlook report, which forecast higher deficits on the back of GOP spending plans. The US Treasury will sell $64bln in 3s/10s/30s this week; with $76.5bln maturing at mid-month, the Treasury will be paying down some $12.5bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: Front WTI futures settle $1.36 higher at $63.42/bbl; front Brent settled $1.54 higher at $68.65/bbl. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a lot of news directly driving crude prices on Monday, with oil takings its cue from the general risk tone, and equities (both firm). Geopolitical concerns are dominating the thoughts of traders; the Iranian President today warned that US President Trump would regret pulling out of the nuclear deal, promising a strong response if the US re-applied sanctions on Iran. There are also whispers of potential military action in the Middle East after US policymakers refused to rule out the option when asked about Syria; Trump said a US response would come within 48 hours. Elsewhere, one potential source of support was removed after Norway&rsquo;s labour union called off strike action after agreeing a new wage deal. In terms of inventories, analysts expect crude stocks to build by 200k barrels in the week, Cushing is seen building by 1.5mln, distillates are expected to draw 400k barrels, and gasoline is seen drawing by 1.4mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX: DXY</strong> is lower against most majors on Monday, falling beneath the 90.000 figure. Weakness was exacerbated slightly in late trade after the CBO raised deficit forecasts, but the focus overall remained on the wider geopolitical/trade wars narrative. Attention is on overnight comments from China&rsquo;s President Xi, to see whether there is any follow through on China&rsquo;s tough retaliatory talk. USD focussed traders are also mindful of the FOMC meeting minutes and CPI data, both on the slate for Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Price action was mainly dictated by the USD side of the pair, with EURUSD continuing to strengthen slightly in wake of the NFP report on Friday. The 1.23 level is proving sticky, and the pair finds itself consolidating just above the level heading into APAC (1.2310-1.2330).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY</strong> was ignoring US yields (higher) as well as the positive sentiment among equity traders (equities up). USDJPY traded in the middle of its recent range (recent range: 106.30 to 107.80; today&rsquo;s range 106.75 to 107.20), though the bias seems towards the down-side in late US trading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP</strong> was consolidating around 1.41 against the greenback, before a bout of USD weakness helped with a push towards 1.4160. Wednesday&rsquo;s data dump is in vogue, as well as a host of BOE policymakers due to speak in the week. Analysts cite short-term resistance under 1.40 (50dma) and the March high (mid 1.42s) are resistance on the top-side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD</strong> higher, with USDCAD falling to 1.27 after the BOC&rsquo;s business outlook survey, which hints at price pressures ahead, though the survey did suggest that GDP growth will slow to below potential this year, which may have caused BOC officials to shift uncomfortably in their seats. The BOC is not expected to adjust rates at its April meeting next week; markets are not fully pricing in a hike until September, while there is only a 20% chance of a hike next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD</strong> shrugged-off early concerns about trade wars/geopolitics to move higher as USD was sold near the cash open. The tone of US policymakers seems to be framing trade wars as a negotiating tactic. NZD action was similar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Capacity pressure is building up in the economy as both wage growth and inflation appear solid, although GDP growth remains stable. Scotiabank notes any insights from this survey over investment purposes may be interesting given the recent mixed signals from capital goods imports, which make up most of the country&rsquo;s imports. As a side note, evidence from the survey were gathered for March thus they will not reflect the uncertainty driven by the latest NAFTA and US-China trade developments.</p>\r\n",

(Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China are looking at CNY devaluation as a tool in their trade spat with the US, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said that there have been no negotiations with the US, and that the US is to blame for the trade friction. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC policy adviser said that China should invest more in real assets rather than invest in US debt and that US is seeking to restrict China&#39;s rise via trade war. However, there were also comments from China think-tank CASS that the nation is unlikely to use USTs as a trade war weapon. That said, this appears to be at odds with research from SGH Macro which suggests that their understanding is that China has halted purchases of USTs. (Newswires/SGH Macro)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports stated that no deal in principle regarding NAFTA is expected to be announced in the upcoming Summit of Americas in Lima, Peru. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian stocks initially began the week rangebound with a non-committal tone seen in the region following the stock rout last Friday on Wall St after President Trump upped the ante on possible trade tariffs against China and US NFP data fell short of estimates. However, sentiment then gradually improved throughout the trading day which was attributed to US efforts over the weekend to alleviate trade concerns in which President Trump predicted that the US would reach an agreement with China on trade and after White House economic adviser Kudlow explicitly stated that this is not a trade war. As such, ASX 200 (+0.4%) shrugged off the early indecision and traded positive, although weakness in mining and energy names capped upside, while Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) was lifted by JPY weakness. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) recovered from the initial cobwebs seen on the mainland&rsquo;s re-open from a 4-day closure and first opportunity to react to the additional USD 100bln tariff consideration against China, while Hang Seng (+1.3%) outperformed on declining money market rates after the PBoC resumed liquidity operations after halting for over 2 weeks. Finally, 10-yr JGBs were uneventful with marginal gains seen as they tracked recent price action in T-notes and with the BoJ also in the market to the tune of JPY 710bln in the belly to super-long end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 10bln via 7-day reverse repos. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3114 (Prev. 6.2926)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda says will continue with powerful easing to achieve target. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Evans (Non-Voter, Dove) said that the US economy is very strong and that he is optimistic on inflation reaching 2% target. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&rsquo;s three main right-leaning parties have announced that they will present a united front ahead of a fresh round of talks to form a government this week. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European bourses (Eurostoxx 50 +0.7%) have kicked the week off on the front-foot in fitting with the positivity seen during Asia-Pac hours. Asian bourses were supported by US efforts over the weekend to alleviate trade concerns in which President Trump predicted that the US would reach an agreement with China on trade and after White House economic adviser Kudlow explicitly stated that this is not a trade war. As such, all ten sectors in Europe trade in positive territory with financial names outperforming as Deutsche Bank (+4.0%) leads the sector after news they have appointed Christian Sewing as CEO; Commerzbank (+1.5%) are also seen higher in sympathy. Elsewhere, energy names modestly lag their peers given price action in the energy sector. In terms of other individual movers in what&rsquo;s been a busy morning of equity newsflow, EDP (+3.8%) have been supported by reports of a potential bid by Engie (-0.5%), Rolls Royce (+1.9%) are seen higher after offloading L&rsquo;Orange to Woodward for EUR 700mln and shares in Casino (+1.8%) have been lifted by a positive broker move at Deutsche Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, for the DXY, a decent comeback from Friday&rsquo;s post-NFP data lows and some short-lived gains on the back of source reports about China contemplating Yuan devaluation as an option in its ongoing war of words vs the US on trade and import tariffs. The Index briefly probed above 90.200 compared to lows just above 90.000 as USD/CNY spiked to just over 6.3250 after the PBoC&rsquo;s official 6.3114 mid-point fix. The Kiwi is back on top of the G10 rankings, but again not really on anything fundamental for the currency or NZ-wise and more on cross flows as the AUD continues to underperform and bear the brunt of any negative repercussions from a full-blown US-China-global trade war. NZD/USD is back near 0.7300 and AUD/NZD is re-testing support just ahead of 1.0500 as AUD/USD continues to reject advances towards 0.7700. Another gainer vs the USD and other majors amidst ongoing bullish Sterling seasonal factors, as Cable pivots 1.4100, EUR/GBP straddles 0.8700 (market contacts noting offers at the figure earlier) and GBP/JPY reclaims 151.00, albeit just. Note, significantly firmer than Halifax house prices also underpinned the Pound, fleetingly. CAD/EUR/JPY/CHF are all narrowly mixed vs the Greenback in typically quiet early Monday trade, with USD/CAD still capped ahead of 1.2800 amidst more reports of positive NAFTA talks, though a deal may not be reached in principle in time for the upcoming Summit of Americas as had been touted. EUR/USD is extremely contained between 1.2660-90, USD/JPY has recoiled around the 107.00 axis and USD/CHF is trapped within 0.9590-0.96.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core bonds are on the retreat again after a rebound on the China devaluation headlines soon fizzled out, with Bunds and Gilts now extending losses to 21 and 26 ticks respectively at the new 159.34 and 122.18 Eurex and Liffe intraday lows. EU stocks are hugging highs on less anxiety over the US-China trade tiff in general, although latest Chinese comments remain relatively resolute and come with the threat of Yuan devaluation, according to sources anyway. US Treasuries also on the retreat after initial post-US labour data gains last Friday and with the curve steeper ahead of this week&rsquo;s auctions, FOMC minutes and CPI data. Back to the 10 year EU benchmarks, and technically Bund bears may now look at Friday&rsquo;s low of 159.15, while nearest downside chart support comes in at 122.10, which is the April 5 session base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures trade modestly higher but in close proximity to some of the lows seen on Friday amid trade concerns and an uptick in the Baker Hughes rig count. Elsewhere, energy-specific newsflow has been relatively quiet over the weekend but traders will continue to be mindful of geopolitical developments with US President Trump warning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and allies that they could pay a big price following a suspected chemical attack that killed dozens over the weekend. Furthermore, Iranian President Rouhani has stated that US President Trump will regret any withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal and that Iran&rsquo;s response to the matter will be stronger than imagined. In metals markets, spot gold has fallen victim to the apparent return of risk appetite to the market and the modestly firmer USD. Elsewhere, Dalian iron ore slipped to a 10-month low in Asia-Pac trade amid ongoing trade concerns whilst aluminium has been seen higher during London hours amid the potential fallout of sanctions by the US on Russian aluminium producer Rusal.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION: EU bourses firmer. FX price action largely dictated by threats of Chinese CNY devaluation. Light calendar ahead",
        "content": "<p>European bourses (Eurostoxx 60 +0.7%) have kicked the week off on the front-foot in fitting with the positivity seen during Asia-Pac hours. Asian bourses were supported by US efforts over the weekend to alleviate trade concerns in which President Trump predicted that the US would reach an agreement with China on trade and after White House economic adviser Kudlow explicitly stated that this is not a trade war. As such, all ten sectors in Europe trade in positive territory with financial names outperforming as Deutsche Bank (+3.3%) leads the sector after news they have appointed Christian Sewing as CEO; Commerzbank (+2.1%) are also seen higher in sympathy. Elsewhere, energy names modestly lag their peers given price action in the energy sector. In terms of other individual movers in what&rsquo;s been a busy morning of equity newsflow, EDP (+4.5%) have been supported by reports of a potential bid by Engie (-0.3%), Rolls Royce (+1.6%) are seen higher after offloading L&rsquo;Orange to Woodward for EUR 700mln and shares in Casino (+2.5%) have been lifted by a positive broker move at Deutsche Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, for the DYX, a decent comeback from Friday&rsquo;s post-NFP data lows and some short-lived gains on the back of source reports about China contemplating Yuan devaluation as an option in its ongoing war of words vs the US on trade and import tariffs. The Index briefly probed above 90.200 compared to lows just above 90.000 as USD/CNY spiked to just over 6.3250 after the PBoC&rsquo;s official 6.3114 mid-point fix. The Kiwi is back on top of the G10 rankings, but again not really on anything fundamental for the currency or NZ-wise and more on cross flows as the AUD continues to underperform and bear the brunt of any negative repercussions from a full-blown US-China-global trade war. NZD/USD is back near 0.7300 and AUD/NZD is re-testing support just ahead of 1.0500 as AUD/USD continues to reject advances towards 0.7700. Another gainer vs the USD and other majors amidst ongoing bullish Sterling seasonal factors, as Cable pivots 1.4100, EUR/GBP straddles 0.8700 (market contacts noting offers at the figure earlier) and GBP/JPY reclaims 151.00, albeit just. Note, significantly firmer than Halifax house prices also underpinned the Pound, fleetingly. CAD/EUR/JPY/CHF are all narrowly mixed vs the Greenback in typically quiet early Monday trade, with USD/CAD still capped ahead of 1.2800 amidst more reports of positive NAFTA talks, though a deal may not be reached in principle in time for the upcoming Summit of Americas as had been touted. EUR/USD is extremely contained between 1.2660-90, USD/JPY has recoiled around the 107.00 axis and USD/CHF is trapped within 0.9590-0.96.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core bonds are on the retreat again after a rebound on the China devaluation headlines soon fizzled out, with Bunds and Gilts now extending losses to 21 and 26 ticks respectively at the new 159.34 and 122.18 Eurex and Liffe intraday lows. EU stocks are hugging highs on less anxiety over the US-China trade tiff in general, although latest Chinese comments remain relatively resolute and come with the threat of Yuan devaluation, according to sources anyway. US Treasuries also on the retreat after initial post-US labour data gains last Friday and with the curve steeper ahead of this week&rsquo;s auctions, FOMC minutes and CPI data. Back to the 10 year EU benchmarks, and technically Bund bears may now look at Friday&rsquo;s low of 159.15, while nearest downside chart support comes in at 122.10, which is the April 5 session base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures trade modestly higher but in close proximity to some of the lows seen on Friday amid trade concerns and an uptick in the Baker Hughes rig count. Elsewhere, energy-specific newsflow has been relatively quiet over the weekend but traders will continue to be mindful of geopolitical developments with US President Trump warning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and allies that they could pay a big price following a suspected chemical attack that killed dozens over the weekend. Furthermore, Iranian President Rouhani has stated that US President Trump will regret any withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal and that Iran&rsquo;s response to the matter will be stronger than imagined. In metals markets, spot gold has fallen victim to the apparent return of risk appetite to the market and the modestly firmer USD. Elsewhere, Dalian iron ore slipped to a 10-month low in Asia-Pac trade amid ongoing trade concerns whilst aluminium has been seen higher during London hours amid the potential fallout of sanctions by the US on Russian aluminium producer Rusal.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>White House economic advisor Kudlow</strong> said that he hopes the US will not use tariffs but added that it may have to, while he also stated that China&rsquo;s first response was highly unsatisfactory. Furthermore, <strong>Kudlow</strong> commented that a tariff solution is possible in 3 months and that tariffs are not a bluff, while he further added that this is not a trade war. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin</strong> said the US is willing to continue negotiations but that President Trump is prepared to defend US interests. <strong>Mnuchin</strong> also commented that there is a potential for a trade war and that progress is being made on NAFTA as well as North Korea. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US President Trump</strong> didn&#39;t seek advice from White House economic adviser <strong>Kudlow</strong> on China tariffs, while <strong>Chief of Staff Kelly</strong> was said to be blindsided by speed of tariff announcements. Furthermore, reports added that <strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin</strong> <strong>and US Trade Representative Lighthizer</strong> worked in lockstep on the China tariffs. (Axios)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PBoC policy adviser</strong> said that China should invest more in real assets rather than invest in US debt and that US is seeking to restrict China&#39;s rise via trade war. However, there were also comments from China think-tank <strong>CASS </strong>that the nation is unlikely to use USTs as a trade war weapon. That said, this appears to be at odds with research from <strong>SGH Macro </strong>which suggests that their understanding is that China has halted purchases of USTs. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Asian stocks initially began the week rangebound with a non-committal tone seen in the region following the stock rout last Friday on Wall St</strong> after President Trump upped the ante on possible trade tariffs against China and US NFP data fell short of estimates. However, sentiment then gradually improved throughout the trading day which was attributed to US efforts over the weekend to alleviate trade concerns in which President Trump predicted that the US would reach an agreement with China on trade and after White House economic adviser Kudlow explicitly stated that this is not a trade war. As such, <strong>ASX 200 (+0.4%)</strong> shrugged off the early indecision and traded positive, although weakness in mining and energy names capped upside, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) </strong>was lifted by JPY weakness. Elsewhere, <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%)</strong> recovered from the initial cobwebs seen on the mainland&rsquo;s re-open from a 4-day closure and first opportunity to react to the additional USD 100bln tariff consideration against China, while <strong>Hang Seng (+1.9%)</strong> outperformed on declining money market rates after the PBoC resumed liquidity operations after halting for over 2 weeks. Finally, 10-yr JGBs were uneventful with marginal gains seen as they tracked recent price action in T-notes and with the BoJ also in the market to the tune of JPY 710bln in the belly to super-long end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 10bln via 7-day reverse repos.

Nonetheless, the <strong>DXY</strong>-index has nursed some losses amid a modest pullback in <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong>, while <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> traded sideways and within proximity for another attempt to reclaim the 1.4100 handle to the upside. Elsewhere, <strong>AUD</strong> was initially restricted by a lacklustre commodity complex but then gained as the risk tone brightened, while <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses also recovered some of the lost ground from last week&rsquo;s miss on US jobs data and safe-haven flows into <strong>JPY</strong>, in which the pair just about reclaimed the 107.00 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Canadian PM Trudeau</strong> said he is hopeful to get promising news on NAFTA in the coming time, while <strong>Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland </strong>said they have had good NAFTA conversations so far and that they are a in a new more intensive phase of discussions. Furthermore, there were also reports that a senior <strong>Mexican economy ministry official</strong> was said to be very convinced that a new NAFTA agreement on trade will be reached very soon and that the next round of NAFTA talks are planned for today in Washington DC.

The disappointing jobs data gave further impetus for bond bulls as the 10y yield dropped back below 2.8%. Fed Chairman Powell reiterated that further gradual rate hikes would be necessary, which saw market pricing for a June hike remain around 70%. However, odds of a fourth interest rate hike are still remarkably low as Powell said it was too early to say how tariffs and trade talk will affect the outlook.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks begin the week rangebound with a non-committal tone seen in the region despite the stock rout last Friday on Wall St after President Trump upped the ante on possible trade tariffs against China and US NFP data fell short of estimates. Furthermore, stocks were also unreactive to an airstrike on a Syrian military airbase which Syrian state media reports had initially attributed to a US offensive, before they later identified Israel as the source of the military attack. As such, ASX 200 (+0.1%) is indecisive with weakness seen in mining and energy names following an over 2% decline in WTI crude futures last Friday and with China iron ore prices slipping to a 10-month low, while Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) is positive but lacks any firm impetus. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (+0.8%) are mixed with underperformance in the mainland after reopening from a 4-day closure to take its first opportunity to react to the additional USD 100bln tariff consideration against China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the major pairs are relatively rangebound overnight as currencies consolidate from the post-NFP price action in which the greenback weakened across the board due to the disappointing jobs numbers. Nonetheless, the DXY-index has nursed some losses amid a modest pullback in EUR/USD, while GBP/USD trades sideways and within proximity for another attempt to reclaim the 1.4100 handle to the upside. Elsewhere, AUD is restricted by a lacklustre commodity complex, while USD/JPY languishes below 107.00 following last week&rsquo;s miss on US jobs data and safe-haven flows into JPY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10-yr JGBs are uneventful with marginal gains seen as they tracked recent price action in T-notes and with the BoJ also in the market to the tune of JPY 710bln in the belly to super-long end.</p>\r\n",
