        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 22 June 2018: Crude jumps on OPEC; Trump threatens EU with higher auto tariffs; Dow snaps losing streak",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities up, Treasuries flat, DXY down, Crude up.<br />* REAR-VIEW: OPEC agrees to target compliance; Canada CPI and retail sales miss; EZ Flash PMIs strong.<br />* NEXT WEEK: Turkish General Election, US Durable Goods, US GDP (Final), US Trade Balance, US PCE, RBNZ Rate Decision, EU Summit, Japan Labour Market, German Labour Market, Canadian GDP (monthly).</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump threatened to apply 20% tariffs on all European cars coming into the US if trade barriers and EU tariffs are not &#39;broken down and removed&#39;, he tweeted. &nbsp;Elsewhere, Russia&#39;s economy minister Oreshkin announced Russia will increase tariffs on US autos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>Canadian inflation softened in May, missing expectations. The m/m figure came in at 0.1% (consensus 0.3%), headline y/y headline came in at 2.2% (cons 2.3%). The BoC Core measures were also weak, and an average of the three slipped to 1.9% from 2.03%. &nbsp;Retail Sales also disappointed with the monthly print posting at -1.2%, consensus 0.0%. The negative direction of the latest data has sent the probability of a rate hike in July to around 50%, from the previous 64%. Data remains the main driver for BoC policymakers who have recently expressed less concerns over long-run weaknesses such as housing and consumer debt, Scotiabank notes. They have also noted business investment is picking up, and Scotia still thinks a hike in July is possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.2% at 2754, NASDAQ 100 -0.3% at 7197, DJI +0.5% at 24581. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -0.1%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.9%, Energy: +2.2%, Financials: -0.5%, Health Care: -0.4%, Industrials: +0.3%, Materials: +1.4%, Telecoms: +1.2%, Tech: -0.4%, Utilities: +0.7%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITY FUTURES: </strong>The US equity futures had a relatively quiet day; the Emini grinded higher overnight, but at the Wall St. open it fell ~10points in the first hour, before losses were erased as the day progressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITY SECTORS: </strong>The energy sector led the way on Friday trade, tracking higher oil prices after the OPEC meeting (see crude section). Financials underperformed today among the tech sector who were hampered by RHT earnings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>CarMax (KMX) reported earnings which beat on both the top and bottom line, and stated wholesale vehicle unit sales increased by 9.6% in Q1, and its used vehicle sales increased by 1.6% for the same period. The stock outperformed the SPX , nearly raising as much as 15%. The laggard of the SPX was RedHat (RHT), which fell victim to a poor earnings report, where its guidance was lower than Wall St expectations, seeing the stock trade lower by as much as 15%, despite beating its numbers on both top and bottom line. The poor outlook spilt over into some other software names such as Splunk (SPLK), Microsoft (MSFT) and VM Ware (VMW).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Noteworthy for US auto names (but more so European ones), President Trump threatened a 20% tariff on EU autos imported into the US if trade barriers and tariffs were not lowered or removed. In an immediate reaction auto names spiked lower in both regions, however some of the losses were pared back and GM and FCAU closed higher, but F and HOG remained in the red.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) 1 TICK LOWER AT 119-26+. </strong>Treasuries were flat on Friday, and volume was thin, though the complex does close higher for the second straight week, ahead of next week, where the US Treasury will auction more than $200bln of paper. Higher stocks initially had Treasuries on the back foot on Friday, and yields were also dancing to the tune of oil prices. But losses were pared as we headed into the close, with the curve steepening a touch on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI CRUDE FUTURES (Q8) SETTLE $3.04 HIGHER AT $68.58; BRENT CRUDE FUTURES (Q8) SETTLE $2.50 HIGHER AT $75.55/BBL. </strong>Crude prices bounced after OPEC agreed to relax supply curbs by less than was guided by the various &lsquo;sources&rsquo; reports over the last fortnight. While the cartel did not specify a figure in its communique, ministers said supply would be increased by around 1mln BPD, though netting the impact of current Venezuelan outages, the &lsquo;real&rsquo; figure would be between 600-800k BPD (depending on who you ask). The cartel also stressed it was targeting a compliance level of 100% (from 147% at current rates); it said that if a particular member is unable to reach its compliance level, other members would be able to negotiate to fill in any voids, and that would be a process between the individual members. Crude rallied after the announcements filter through into the market, apparently on relief that the relaxation in curbs was not as stark as was guided earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP: </strong>DXY: The index and broad Usd have been thwarted by several factors at the end of a week that looked very promising at one stage when the DXY notched a new 2018 peak just over 95.500. On Friday the chief negatives came via energy and oil prices in particular that spiked sharply on OPEC&rsquo;s decision to loosen its output cap via stricter compliance amidst &lsquo;general&rsquo; agreement that this equates a nominal rise of 1 mn bpd, or 600-800k in physical terms. Back to the Dollar, and the retreat actually started yesterday on the back of disappointing macros releases, and especially the Philly Fed survey, while strong recoveries in currency counterparts also impacted again. The index is currently retesting 93.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>The main beneficiaries of the Usd pull-back and short squeeze in crude, with the Aud also unwinding and reversing post-dovish RBA minutes underperformance with the aid of supportive fiscal policy in the form of income tax cuts. Indeed, Aud/Usd has rebounded to just under 0.7450 from sub-0.7350 at one stage, and from a chart perspective it would be constructive to close above 0.7413. Similarly, but not quite as emphatically, the Kiwi is back near 0.6900 from a low of 0.6823, though still circa 50 pips below where it started on Monday. AUDNZD over 1.0750 again has not helped, while some defensive positioning may be weighing ahead of next week&rsquo;s RBNZ policy meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>Upbeat Eurozone preliminary PMIs offset more political jitters (via reports that Germany&rsquo;s SPD is preparing for snap elections) to keep the single currency on the recovery path from 1.1510 ytd lows vs the Usd, but unable convincingly clear the 21 DMA (1.1671) and layered bids up to 1.1700. Meanwhile, the Pound got its biggest boost alongside some better Brexit news via the passage of EU withdrawal bill amendments through Parliament with more concessions, from an unexpected hawkish shift at the BoE, as Haldane joined the 2 existing rate hike dissenters. Moreover, the minutes were more upbeat on inflation and insistent that negligible Q1 growth was down to bad weather, while the rate at which APF will no longer be reinvested was cut to 1.5% from 2%. Cable duly jumped from circa 1.3100 lows and is now just under 1.3300 having tested resistance and offers just above, with 1.3243 key on a closing basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The G10 laggard even though oil&rsquo;s revival provided some comfort for the Loonie, as soft inflation and simply weak retail sales compounded ongoing NAFTA uncertainty/divergence with the US that has highlighted so publicly at the G7 summit. Usd/Cad started the week circa 1.3200 and hit a low just under 1.3160 but catapulted to 1.3380 in wake of the data misses before easing back and perhaps respecting strong chart resistance just shy of 1.3390. However, a bleak BoC outlook next week could see the Loonie suffer anew, and vice-versa of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>Mixed fortunes for the traditional safe havens, with the Jpy choppy between 109.50-110.75 vs the Greenback and trading on swings in US-China/global trade sentiment as all sides upped the ante on tariffs and sanctions, but have yet to impose stiffer import levies, leaving some time to talk and room for compromise before impending implementation dates. The Franc has gained vs the Dollar to test sub-0.9900 levels, but lost ground vs the Eur to 1.1500+ on latest pledges to keep policy loose and intervene at the mid-year SNB policy review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Sunday: Turkish General Election; Monday: German IFO; Wednesday: BoE Governor Carney speaks, US Durable Goods, Trade Balance; Thursday: RBNZ Rate Decision, German CPI (Prelim), US GDP (Final), EU Summit; Friday: Japan Labour Market, German Labour Market, UK GDP (Final), EZ CPI, US PCE, Canadian GDP (monthly). <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19459/download\">Click here for full briefing</a>.</p>\r\n",

On Friday the chief negatives came via energy and oil prices in particular that spiked sharply on OPEC&rsquo;s decision to loosen its output cap via stricter compliance amidst &lsquo;general&rsquo; agreement that this equates a nominal rise of 1 mn bpd, or 600-800k in physical terms. Back to the Dollar, and the retreat actually started yesterday on the back of disappointing macros releases, and especially the Philly Fed survey, while strong recoveries in currency counterparts also impacted again. The index is currently retesting 93.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main beneficiaries of the Usd pull-back and short squeeze in crude, with the Aud also unwinding and reversing post-dovish RBA minutes underperformance with the aid of supportive fiscal policy in the form of income tax cuts. Indeed, Aud/Usd has rebounded to just under 0.7450 from sub-0.7350 at one stage, and from a chart perspective it would be constructive to close above 0.7413. Similarly, but not quite as emphatically, the Kiwi is back near 0.6900 from a low of 0.6823, though still circa 50 pips below where it started on Monday. Aud/Nzd over 1.0750 again has not helped, while some defensive positioning may be weighing ahead of next week&rsquo;s RBNZ policy meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upbeat Eurozone preliminary PMIs offset more political jitters (via reports that Germany&rsquo;s SPD is preparing for snap elections) to keep the single currency on the recovery path from 1.1510 ytd lows vs the Usd, but unable convincingly clear the 21 DMA (1.1671) and layered bids up to 1.1700. Meanwhile, the Pound got its biggest boost alongside some better Brexit news via the passage of EU withdrawal bill amendments through Parliament with more concessions, from an unexpected hawkish shift at the BoE, as Haldane joined the 2 existing rate hike dissenters. Moreover, the minutes were more upbeat on inflation and insistent that negligible Q1 growth was down to bad weather, while the rate at which APF will no longer be reinvested was cut to 1.5% from 2%. Cable duly jumped from circa 1.3100 lows and is now just under 1.3300 having tested resistance and offers just above, with 1.3243 key on a closing basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The G10 laggard even though oil&rsquo;s revival provided some comfort for the Loonie, as soft inflation and simply weak retail sales compounded ongoing NAFTA uncertainty/divergence with the US that has highlighted so publicly at the G7 summit. Usd/Cad started the week circa 1.3200 and hit a low just under 1.3160, but catapulted to 1.3380 in wake of the data misses before easing back and perhaps respecting strong chart resistance just shy of 1.3390. However, a bleak BoC outlook next week could see the Loonie suffer anew, and vice-versa of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed fortunes for the traditional safe havens, with the Jpy choppy between 109.50-110.75 vs the Greenback and trading on swings in US-China/global trade sentiment as all sides upped the ante on tariffs and sanctions, but have yet to impose stiffer import levies, leaving some time to talk and room for compromise before impending implementation dates. The Franc has gained vs the Dollar to test sub-0.9900 levels, but lost ground vs the Eur to 1.1500+ on latest pledges to keep policy loose and intervene at the mid-year SNB policy review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nok has sharply outperformed its Scandi peer and the Eur on diverging policy dynamics as the Norges Bank essentially confirmed September as the month to lift rates, while the Sek was hit by political jitters after Sweden&rsquo;s Democrats called for a post-election EU referendum. Eur/Nok hit fresh ytd lows under 9.4000 on Thursday, but has been caught between hefty option expiry interest today at the 9.4000 and 9.4500 strikes. Conversely, Eur/Sek is back over 10.3000 and the cross close to 1.1000.</p>\r\n",

As such, Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) saw early underperformance amid recent JPY strength, while ASX 200 (-0.2%) bucked the trend for most the session amid strength in financials led by ANZ Bank which announced to double its share repurchase. Elsewhere, trade concerns continued to cloud over the Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) from the open, although stocks then recovered as participants also digested another net weekly liquidity injection from the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively unchanged with prices sitting near 2-week highs, while the latest CPI data from Japan was largely ignored despite the headline being a tad firmer than expected as inflation remained far from the 2% price goal. In addition, today&rsquo;s BoJ Rinban announcement also failed to spur demand as the central bank maintained all purchase amounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 40bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 30bln via 14-day reverse repos, for a net weekly injection of CNY 140bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 240bln net injection. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.4804 (Prev. 6.4706)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some US administration officials are reportedly pushing for resuming talks with China due to a split opinion among the Trump trade team in which &#39;high level&#39; talks would take place before July 6th, according to three people familiar with the matter. However, the report also noted chances of near term negotiations are slim and that Trump shows no sign of backing down.

The energy sector was dragging on equities as OPEC accord tensions pressured the sector but bounced on a deal nearing closure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SMI is currently the outperforming bourse whilst the DAX underperforms as trade concerns linger over German auto names and pressure on the index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French company specific news dominates newswires, with the French Government saying they have no intention of breaking up EDF (flat) into a nuclear and non-nuclear unit, as well as Airbus (+1.5%) on a positive note being circulated from JP Morgan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has continued its firm rebound from post-Fed and especially ECB policy meeting lows, with upbeat preliminary PMIs for June providing additional momentum to extend recovery gains beyond 1.1600 vs the Usd and briefly challenging the 21 DMA around 1.1670. However, offers layered between there and 1.1700 are capping further upside for now, and reports that Germany&rsquo;s SPD are preparing for an election also undermined the single currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - The major beneficiaries a pre-OPEC squeeze in oil prices and broad Greenback retracement in wake of yesterday&rsquo;s disappointing US data (Philly Fed survey in particular), as the former regains 0.7400 and looks to close above a chart pivot circa 0.7413, while the latter is hovering around 0.6900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Building on post-BoE gains with Cable testing 1.3300 for a near 2 big figure bounce from worst levels in the run up to Thursday&rsquo;s MPC policy revelations, but also meeting some technical resistance ahead of its 21 DMA (1.3310).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY - The renowned safe-havens remain rather divergent vs the Usd, with the Franc firmer either side of 0.9900, but Jpy back below 110.00 as chart support at the 30 DMA (109.99) was only breached fleetingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - Consolidating above 1.3300 against its US counterpart and eyeing crude ahead of OPEC like the antipodean dollars and other commodity currencies, but also looking towards Canadian CPI and retail sales data for independent impetus ahead of next week&rsquo;s BoC outlook report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Finding some support around 94.500, but off fresh ytd peaks some 100 ticks higher on the aforementioned worse-than-forecast US releases and decent recoveries in rival trading partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK debt and STIR contracts are back-pedalling having recovered some lost ground in wake of Thursday&rsquo;s hawkish BoE twist, but not solely on the tighter vote split or latest MPC minutes as Bunds have also recoiled further from yesterday&rsquo;s peaks amidst broadly upbeat Eurozone PMIs &ndash; to test near term chart support at 161.80 (-35 ticks on the day), which equates to a 50% retracement of Thursday&rsquo;s move. Back to Liffe, the 10 year bond has been down to 122.63 vs the previous 123.03 close after an initial print of 122.99 that also marks the high so far, while the 3 month strip hit lows as much as 4 ticks under parity. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain close to overnight session lows with the curve mildly steeper ahead of the flash PMIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil trades higher as OPEC near an agreement on an output increase. Initially sources had suggested that &lsquo;building [a] consensus [would] be a big challenge&rsquo; and &lsquo;not all OPEC members [were] likely to accept the Ministerial Committee&#39;s proposal for an oil output increase of around 1mln BPD&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst source reports had also suggested that Iran were doubting a consensus could be reached a more collaborative tone was struck after last minute talks and negotiations, with Iran stating that the meeting with the Saudi Oil Minister was positive. Following this multiple oil ministers confirmed that a compromise deal including a higher Iran quota may be part of the agreement and the 1mln BPD increase was an overestimation. The real effect is to be 700k BPD as according to the Nigerian Energy Minsiter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libyan oil ports had exacerbated the rise in oil, with a further storage tank catching fire due to domestic conflicts. However, Libya&rsquo;s NOC has confirmed Ras Lanuf and Es Sider are under the control of Libya&rsquo;s National Army, with fires now all extinguished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is up slightly heading in to the weeks end as the USD edges off of 11 month highs. Steel is set for the worst week in two months as the metal is eyeing losses once again on Friday. Copper is also set to fall on Friday as worries loom about falling Chinese demand due to trade concerns.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, Eurogroup President Centeno said there will be no follow up programme with Greece after exit of the current bailout and that they also agreed to a 10yr deferral on interest and amortisation, while he added this will allow Greece to issue bonds across the curve.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were quiet during Asia trade, although the greenback found some mild reprieve from the prior day&rsquo;s weakness in which the DXY attempted to recover lost ground below the 95.00 level. Elsewhere, EUR/USD briefly pulled back to test 1.1600 to the downside and GBP/USD maintained the momentum from the prior day&rsquo;s more-hawkish-split-surprise at the BoE, while commodity-linked currencies coat-tailed on overnight gains in oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices outperformed in commodities overnight in which WTI reclaimed the USD 66/bbl level ahead of today&rsquo;s OPEC meeting. Furthermore, the upside coincided with the reopen of Brent futures which were underpinned following reports that the OPEC+ committee were backing a 1mln bpd increase which they stressed was nominal and could effectively be only 600k bpd once distributed due to current over compliance. Elsewhere, the metals complex was less eventful with gold and copper prices sideways amid cautious risk tone and attempts by the greenback to nurse losses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC+ committee is said to support 1mln bpd output increase &quot;on paper&quot;. Iraq Oil Minister Al-Luaibi said OPEC+ Committee has reached a preliminary decision and that a majority backed the output increase which would be gradual and nominal. Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih also commented that the output increase proposal is nominal which means it would be actually smaller once distributed, while a delegate suggested the OPEC+ proposal would result to a real increase of 600K bpd. Furthermore, Iraq and Oman Oil Ministers reportedly think Iran can agree on the output increase. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran Oil Minister said he doubts OPEC can reach consensus on supply cut deal, after leaving the monitoring committee meeting abruptly.

Yields were lower by c.3bps across the curve, 2s5s and 2s20 narrowed by c.2bps. 2s30s narrowed by c.1bps. The US Treasury sold $5bln in 30yr TIPS stopping through by 0.6bps at a high yield of 0.934%. The bid-to-cover came in at 2.62x. Dealers were awarded the smallest portion of the latest 30yr TIPS supply at 14.6% while indirects/directs took a share well above average, at 80.8% and 4.6% respectively. US 10YR T-notes futures (Sep 2018) finished 8 ticks higher at 119-27+.<br /><br />US President Trump noted there may be a little pain on Canada but added that it will work out.

As such, Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) saw early underperformance amid recent JPY strength, while ASX 200 (-0.2%) bucked the trend for most the session amid strength in financials led by ANZ Bank which announced to double its share repurchase. Elsewhere, trade concerns continued to cloud over the Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) from the open, although stocks then recovered as participants also digested another net weekly liquidity injection from the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively unchanged with prices sitting near 2-week highs, while the latest CPI data from Japan was largely ignored despite the headline being a tad firmer than expected as inflation remained far from the 2% price goal. In addition, today&rsquo;s BoJ Rinban announcement also failed to spur demand as the central bank maintained all purchase amounts.</p>\r\n",

As such, Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) saw early underperformance amid recent JPY strength while trade concerns continue to cloud over the Hang Seng (-0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) but with losses in the latter contained amid a liquidity injection from the PBoC. Conversely, ASX 200 (Unch) bucked the trend for most the session and remains near decade highs with its largest sector financials front-running the outperformance as ANZ Bank gains following the announcement to double its share repurchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are quiet so far during Asia trade, although the greenback found some mild reprieve from the prior day&rsquo;s weakness with the DXY attempting to recover lost ground below the 95.00 level. Elsewhere, EUR/USD has slightly pulled back to test 1.1600 to the downside and GBP/USD maintains the momentum from the prior day&rsquo;s more hawkish-split-surprise at the BoE, while commodity-linked currencies coat-tail on overnight gains in oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively unchanged with prices sitting near 2-week highs, while the latest CPI data from Japan was largely ignored despite the headline being a tad firmer than expected as inflation remains far from the 2% price goal. In addition, today&rsquo;s BoJ Rinban announcement also failed to spur demand as the central bank maintained its purchase amounts.</p>\r\n",
