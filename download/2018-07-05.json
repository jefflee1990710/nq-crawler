Futures traded with an upside bias, though there was a wobble after ADP payroll data missed expectations, ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s NFP, sending ES through its 50dma at 2725, though ultimately found support at 2717 in afternoon trade which provided a springboard to test fresh session highs beneath 2740; once again, there was a wobble after the FOMC&rsquo;s meeting minutes expressed concerns on trade and future recessions, though equity traders eventually resumed buying, though afternoon volume was below average. Consumer staples and Tech outperformed, with the latter lifted by the rebound in chips names following the selloff seen earlier this week after Micron&#39;s legal woes in China, while General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) were buoyed as European officials were said to consider talks with vehicles exporters to cut tariffs on cars.

As US traders got to their desk, the TPLEX rose, likely in sympathy with the Bund, which caught a bid as Italian BTPs sold-off. There was some further upside after a mixed ISM survey (it appears Treasuries looked through the data), though the T-Note found sellers around 120-13+, and after fleeting knee-jerk higher post-Fed minutes, the T-Note continued its move lower towards the middle of the range, to finish flattish. The curve continued to flatten on Thursday, with 2s10s, 2s30s, 5s10s and 5s30s narrowing to lows not seen in a decade. Attention falls on tomorrow&rsquo;s payrolls data (preview below). US 10YR T-notes futures (u8) 2 ticks lower at 120-08.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities up, Treasuries flat, DXY down, Crude down. &nbsp;<br />* REAR-VIEW: FOMC concerned about tariffs; Non-MFG ISM mixed; UK PM May facing backlash from pro-Brexit Cabinet ministers; EIA reports surprise crude build.<br />* AHEAD: US Non-Farm Payrolls; Canadian Employment Data; EU&#39;s Barnier to speak; May meets Cabinet on Brexit.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOMC MINUTES: </strong>While the FOMC&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes generally were in line with the post-meeting statement and press conference with Chair Powell, there were a few new pieces of information that warrant attention. The Fed is clearly concerned about the risks of global trade wars, saying risks had intensified and were concerning, with the central bank&rsquo;s contacts expressing concerns about how tariffs might impact investment, with some contacts also suggesting that capital spending has already been scaled back. On the yield curve, the central bank had detailed discussions of the flattening of the yield curve, and staff presented analysis on how yield spreads and recession risks might unfold. On forward guidance, a number of officials said it may be appropriate to tweak guidance in the statement about policy remaining &lsquo;accommodative&rsquo;, and some voters said the language was no longer appropriate given the economy&rsquo;s strength. On the neutral rate, many said gradual hikes could take the FFR above neutral some time next year. Other particulars were in line with the Fed&rsquo;s policy statement and the Powell presser. Generally, the market was undecided on how to interpret the minutes, with the market initially tilting dovish on the discussion of trade risks and the yield curve, before turning slightly hawkish as the Fed seems content to tighten policy as it has previously said it would.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US Trade Representative confirmed USD 34bln China tariffs are scheduled to start at 00:01EDT on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Russia Foreign Minister said it will do everything possible to maintain the Iran nuclear deal and will continue trade cooperation with Iran, Interfax reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE SPEAK: </strong>Governor Carney&nbsp;pushed forward expectations for an August rate hike from ~57% to ~62%, delivering a positive assessment of the UK economy, and expressing confidence that inflation is nudging up on the back of higher oil prices, further supported by domestic price pressures gradually building up. Carney also noted that in recent months, global financial conditions have tightened somewhat, though this is likely more to do with US monetary than trade policy. He appeared confident the soft UK economy in Q1 was largely due to weather and not economic climate, adding tighter monetary policy will be needed and warned there are some signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity. He announced the central bank will have enough information to make a rate decision in August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB SPEAK: </strong>ECB&#39;s Praet&#39;s (dovish) comments were in line with the most recent ECB policy meeting; he reiterated that the expectation is that rates will remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and, in any case, for as long as necessary. He noted the uncertainty about the inflation outlook has been declining significantly, and the risk of deflation has vanished, there are grounds to be confident that the sustained convergence of inflation will continue in the ahead. ECB&#39;s Nowotny (Hawk) said a trade war can lead to a currency war. ECB&#39;s Weidmann (Hawk) sees risks in letting EU governments borrow more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK Business Minister Clark said the Cabinet&#39;s Brexit discussion on Friday (where PM May is said will be substantial, and he is confident that UK PM May will reach agreement with senior ministers on customs. However, key Cabinet members are reportedly in opposition to May&#39;s Brexit strategy, with reports stating that Brexit Minister Davis is in strong opposition to the White Paper, and is fighting a plan to tie the UK to the EU&#39;s rules on goods. Elsewhere, the European Council chair (and Austrian PM Kurz) said Brexit talks should be extended if no deal is agreed, arguing that he is in favour of pursuing negotiations rather than have a hard Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;ISM Non-manufacturing PMI&nbsp;rose to 59.1 from 58.6, beating expectations at 58.3, though the breakdown was more mixed. The employment&nbsp;sub-index eased,&nbsp;and has now been softening for three consecutive months, with the latest figure down to 53.6 from 54.1. Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics argue &quot;given that GDP growth almost certainly strengthened in Q2, we&#39;re assuming that the softening in the&nbsp;employment index is due to fear over the possible impact of tariffs&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere, the&nbsp;ADP&nbsp;reported 177k payrolls were added to the US economy in June, missing expectations of 190k. However, the previous figure was upwardly revised to 189k from an initially reported 178k. While the number was below the trend rate of payroll growth, analysts are unclear whether this was due to weaker demand, or a lack of supply. &ldquo;At this stage it&#39;s just not possible to know if this is a response to the uncertainty triggered by the trade tariffs and ongoing disputes with trading partners, or simply a reflection of diminishing labour supply,&rdquo; Pantheon Macroeconomics said.&nbsp;Jobless Claims&nbsp;rose to 231k, consensus was for 225k, hitting the highest level in 6 weeks. The rise does not appear alarming as &lsquo;seasonals are unreliable over short periods, but the y/y trend is unchanged&rsquo; analysts at Pantheon said. &quot;The US holiday is likely to impact next week&rsquo;s reading, which could push the figure to 250k before the trend converges back to the recent lows 220k in the following weeks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.9% at 2,736, NASDAQ COMP +1.1% at 7,586, DJI &nbsp;+0.8% at 24,357.

Micron (MU) rallied on Thursday, and gave further support to the tech sector after it announced to anticipate only a 1% negative impact to its revenue related to the injunction which saw the Chinese court temporarily halting its ability to sell products to China. Elsewhere, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) were buoyed as European officials were said to consider talks with vehicles exporters to cut tariffs on cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>Boeing (BA) and Embraer (ERJ) confirmed their joint venture in commercial aviation comprising Embraer&#39;s commercial aircraft and services business, with Boeing to hold a 80% stake valued at USD 3.8bln. Praxair (PX) was up 4% after signing a deal to sell most of its European assets to Taiyo (LNEGY) for EUR 5bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) 2 TICKS LOWER AT 120-08. </strong>The treasury complex drifted on Thursday, and closes out the session in the middle of its ~10 tick trading range. As US traders got to their desk, the TPLEX rose, likely in sympathy with the Bund, which caught a bid as Italian BTPs sold-off. There was some further upside after a mixed ISM survey (it appears Treasuries looked through the data), though the T-Note found sellers around 120-13+, and after fleeting knee-jerk higher post-Fed minutes, the T-Note continued its move lower towards the middle of the range, to finish flattish. The curve continued to flatten on Thursday, with 2s10s, 2s30s, 5s10s and 5s30s narrowing to lows not seen in a decade. Attention falls on tomorrow&rsquo;s payrolls data (preview below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Q8) SETTLE $1.20 LOWER AT $72.94/BBL; BRENT (U8) SETTLES $0.85 LOWER AT $77.39/BBL.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE INVENTORIES: </strong>WTI prices dropped sharply after the EIA reported an unexpected build in crude inventories in the week. Headline crude stocks were +1.245mln (exp -3.538mln), stocks at Cushing drew down by 2.113mln (exp -2.713mln) to the lowest since December 2014, gasoline stocks drew more than expected at 1.505mln (exp -800k) and distillates printed a small build of 134k (exp -545k). Weekly crude production, meanwhile, was unchanged at 10.9mln BPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* OPEC: </strong>Sources reported that Saudi Arabia informed OPEC it pumped 10.448mln BPD in June, which would be up on the 10.27mln BPD it pumped in May. Saudi Aramco also reported that it cut its official selling prices for August, which analysts said was consistent with the increase in Saudi production that was evident in the June production estimates.&nbsp; Traders continued to cite US President Trump&rsquo;s latest threat to OPEC, via a tweet on Wednesday evening, urging the cartel to ease oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* OIL GEOPOLITICS: </strong>The Iranians continued their belligerent rhetoric on Thursday, doubling down on Wednesday&rsquo;s pledge to block the Straits of Hormuz if Iran cannot sell its crude due to US sanctions/pressure on Iranian crude buyers to stop purchasing oil. In later trade, the head of the Iranian parliamentary committee for financial security reported Iran cannot close strait of Hormuz and notes Iran&#39;s Rouhani did not mean what he said as according to Arabiya. US Central Command on Wednesday said the US Navy stands ready with its partners to ensure freedom of navigation and the flow of commerce through the Straits to promote security and stability in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The dollar index was trading sub-94.500 and softer overall ahead of the Fed minutes and early pre-NFP pointers suggesting a moderately sub-forecast skew to the headline number tomorrow. However, indirect factors also weighed, such as hawkish/bullish central bank chatter lifting counterparts, and more corrective moves in EMs such as the Rand, Peso and Lira. There was some upside for the DXY following the FOMC&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes; while the Fed was concerned about trade and possible recession/yield curve inversion, the message was one of a central bank confident in the economy, and a number of officials believe it will be appropriate to change its forward guidance around &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; in the months ahead, helping the buck to pare back losses on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR: </strong>Euro rallied and European sovereign bonds fell as investors repriced the trajectory of ECB rate increases, after the &#39;ECB sources&#39; report on Wednesday (which stated that some ECB policymakers are worried that a hike at the end of 2019 may be too late), and following data which showed German factory orders surging in May. EUR is still, however, struggling to negotiate the 1.17 level, and was lingering just beneath it ahead of the FOMC meeting minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP: </strong>The pound had initially taken advantage of USD weakness, also aided by optimistic comments from BOE governor Carney; but sterling dropped against both the dollar and euro after reports suggested that Germany is said to see UK PM May&#39;s Brexit customs plan as &#39;unworkable&#39;. Sterling traders will be cognizant of tomorrow&#39;s Cabinet meeting at Chequers, where PM May will discuss particulars on her customs plan, and the upcoming White Paper; however, some in her cabinet are already said to express scepticism of her &#39;third way&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>US Employment Situation Report (June 2018) to be published by The Bureau of Labor statistics at 1330 BST/0830 EDT on 6 June 2018. Analysts expect 195k nonfarm payrolls to be added to the US economy in June; average hourly earnings are seen rising by 0.1ppts to 2.8% YY, the jobless rate is seen unchanged at 3.8%. ADP payrolls data came in below expectations in June, jobless claims have edged up over the month, planned job layoffs rose in the month, and employment sub-components in the ISM surveys moderated slightly. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19551/download\">For the full preview click here.</a></p>\r\n",

The Fed is clearly concerned about the risks of global trade wars, saying risks had intensified and were concerning, with the central bank&rsquo;s contacts expressing concerns about how tariffs might impact investment, with some contacts also suggesting that capital spending has already been scaled back. On the yield curve, the central bank had detailed discussions of the flattening of the yield curve, and staff presented analysis on how yield spreads and recession risks might unfold. On forward guidance, a number of officials said it may be appropriate to tweak guidance in the statement about policy remaining &lsquo;accommodative&rsquo;, and some voters said the language was no longer appropriate given the economy&rsquo;s strength. On the neutral rate, many said gradual hikes could take the FFR above neutral some time next year. Other particulars were in line with the Fed&rsquo;s policy statement and the Powell presser. Generally, the market was undecided on how to interpret the minutes, with the market initially tilting dovish on the discussion of trade risks and the yield curve, before turning slightly hawkish as the Fed seems content to tighten policy as it has previously said it would.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) initially struggled for direction and remained at the whim of the currency before trade war fears eventually took its toll, while ASX 200 (+0.5%) bucked the trend with upside led by strength in telecoms and the heavily-weighted financials sector. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) began choppy after the PBoC skipped open market operations for a net liquidity drain of CNY 140bln which coincided with its previously announced targeted RRR cut taking effect, before trade concerns and fears of a full-blown trade war proved to be the deciding factor. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains and approached closer to the 151.00 level, with the late support seen as risk sentiment soured on tariff fears and which also followed firmer demand in the 30yr auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 140bln, although its previously announced targeted RRR cut took effect from today, which is said to release CNY 700bln of funds. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.6180 (Prev. 6.6595)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Mofcom said China will respond if US implements tariffs, while Customs states that tariffs on US goods will immediately take effect after US tariffs on China are in place. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Board Member Masai said it may take some time to reach to reach 2% price goal and that it is appropriate to continue with strong monetary easing in a persistent and sustainable manner. Furthermore, Masai also suggested that structural problems in the banking industry should be discussed independently from monetary easing. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is said to have asked Chancellor Hammond and Business Secretary Clarke to warn colleagues of the dangers in pressing for a hard Brexit at the meeting on Friday at Chequers. Elsewhere, there were also reports that ministers warned PM May not to sidestep controversial Brexit issues at the meeting amid concern focus on customs may neglect issues such as services sector and freedom of movement. (Newswires/Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Downing Street has released some details of how EU-UK customs could be handled post-Brexit. The new plan (dubbed &quot;facilitated customs arrangement&quot;) would allow the UK to set its own tariffs on imports to the UK. Technology would be used beforehand to determine where the goods will end up, and whether UK or EU tariffs would apply. Downing Street is confident the arrangement would partly be in place by the end of the transition period in December 2020. The arrangement has not been explained in full - and it is not clear whether the cabinet will back the plan. (BBC) However, it was later reported that UK Brexit Secretary David Davis wrote to PM May in a last-ditch attempt to warn her that her Brexit plan to be presented at Chequers is unworkable as it is merely a customs arrangement with some technical adjustments. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US ambassador to Germany told car industry bosses that US is ready to compromise regarding tariffs and that US would not impose tariffs if EU lifts tariffs on US cars. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Governor Carney said data gives him confidence that the soft UK economy in Q1 was largely due to weather and not economic climate; reiterating tighter monetary policy will be needed. Added that pay and domestic cost growth have continued to firm broadly as expected, widespread evidence that slack is largely used up. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Praet says the uncertainty about the inflation outlook has been declining significantly, and the risk of deflation has vanished, there are grounds to be confident that the sustained convergence of inflation will continue in the period ahead. Added that the expectation is that policy rates will remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and, in any case, for as long as necessary. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Dolenc looks for the Bank&#39;s key rate to remain &#39;relatively low for long&#39; until late next year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some ECB policymakers are said to be concerned regarding some investors&rsquo; expectations for a hike in end-2019 as they view this as too late, according to sources which also suggested that the door is open for possible rate move in September or October next year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US officials are said to have dropped their all or nothing approach on North Korean denuclearization ahead of a US Secretary of State Pompeo&#39;s visit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automotive names are driving European stocks higher after reports of compromises being close on auto tariffs, with a reduction in tariffs being touted. As such the DAX is outperforming on the back of strength in index heavy-weights Daimler (+3.9%), Volkswagen (+4.3%), BMW (+5.2%) and Continental (+2.8%), with traders eyeing the 100DMA of 12,515 on the upside, currently trading at 12,454. Peugeot (+3.3%) and Michelin (+3.0%) are also driving the CAC, with the bourse breaking through its 100DMA and approaching its 200DMA of 5,374. Further support is offered to the French index after Sodexo (+6.7%) reported positive sales figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated British Foods (-4.6%) reported uninspiring earnings, and have increased concerns over their sugar business not meeting profit targets. This is pressuring consumer staples (-0.5%) which is currently the worst performing sector. The materials sector is outperforming on the back of mining names (FTSE 350 mining index +1.9%) moving in sympathy with Glencore (+3.3%) post announcement of a USD 1bln share repurchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Linde (+1.3%) have said that a sale of Praxair&rsquo;s European gas businesses will allow for a merger clearance by the European Commission. Praxair have agreed to sell their assets to Taiyo Nippon Sanso</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds continue to fall after increasingly brief periods of consolidation, respite and flatter rebounds, with the 10 year debt future just registering a new Eurex low at 162.06, -49 ticks from yesterday&rsquo;s close, and Gilts have corrected lower from the Liffe open as anticipated, to a 122.80 base and 29 tick decline on the day, with independent bearish impetus via an upbeat Carney. Aside from the hawkish ECB vibes, via sources, market contacts note that a chart gap was filled around 162.44 and Wednesday&rsquo;s 162.37 session base has subsequently been breached, along with a downside technical objective at 162.22 to expose 162.01 ahead of 161.85, while for Gilts the nearest technical support is now around 122.66. Elsewhere, US Treasuries also slipping deeper into negative territory and re-steepening a tad awaiting the return of market participants from their Independence Day celebrations and a busy line up of data, including anecdote/proxies for Friday&rsquo;s NFP report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has extended gains vs the Usd through the 1.1700 handle and first heavy expiry option hedges at the strike (2.3 bn today, and a further 1.7 bn on Friday), albeit briefly, in wake of latest ECB sources claiming market expectations for an end 2019 rate hike would be too late, and with perhaps some added momentum from upbeat German data (industrial orders). Eur/Jpy also boosted by M&amp;A-related flows, but capped around 129.50 and just ahead of its 55 DMA (129.54).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is vying with the Eur for top G10 spot, but again largely on short covering, technical retracement and cross-winds, as Nzd/Usd remains supported above 0.6750 and Aud/Nzd slips below 1.0900, while Aud/Usd retreats further from 0.7400 on the persistent US-China/global trade war threat and declining metals prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD/CHF/JPY - All relative stable vs the Greenback, with Cable building a firmer base above 1.3200, but not able to clear 1.3250 and its 21 DMA just above ahead of a speech from BoE Governor Carney and the next big Brexit event (Chequers on Friday). In the event the MPC head was positive on growth and the inflation outlook, lifting near term rate hike expectations and the Gbp through the aforementioned psychological and technical resistance levels albeit briefly. The Loonie is essentially stuck around 1.3150, Franc equally tight within 0.9940-10 bounds and hardly responding to in line Swiss CPI data (albeit weaker vs the Eur circa 1.1600), while the Jpy hugs 110.50 eyeing decent expiries between there and 110.60 (1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - Onward and upward for the Krona, and latest catalyst comes in the form of strong Swedish data (industrial output), with further gains vs the Eur that is strong in its own right, as mentioned earlier &ndash; Eur/Sek inching close towards 10.2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices were down with WTI languishing around the USD 74 level after US President Trump reiterated his position on Twitter overnight vs. OPEC of prices being too high. This was reversed in later trade however, with WTI positive and Brent negative on the day as traders look ahead to today&rsquo;s holiday-delayed DoE inventory report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope Gold is pulling back after hitting a one week high in yesterdays trade of USD 1,261/oz, currently at USD 1,253/oz. Base metals are slipping as the threat of a trade war looms, with zinc and nickel sulking around one-year lows. Copper is also being hit by these worries, with the bellwether metal down 2.8% in Shanghai.</p>\r\n",

As such the DAX is outperforming on the back of strength in index heavy-weights Daimler (3.7%), Volkswagen (3.5%), BMW (4.3%) and Continental (+2.3%), with traders eyeing the 100DMA of 12,515 on the upside, currently trading at 12,454. Peugeot (2.7%) and Michelin (2.6%) are also driving the CAC, with the bourse breaking through its 100DMA and approaching its 200DMA of 5,374. Further support is offered to the French index after Sodexo (+5.3%) reported positive sales figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated British Foods (-5.2%) reported uninspiring earnings, and have increased concerns over their sugar business not meeting profit targets. This is pressuring consumer staples (-0.7%) which is currently the worst performing sector. The materials sector is outperforming on the back of mining names (FTSE 350 mining index +2.2%) moving in sympathy with Glencore (+3.2%) post announcement of a USD 1bln share repurchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has extended gains vs the Usd through the 1.1700 handle and first heavy expiry option hedges at the strike (2.3 bn today, and a further 1.7 bn on Friday), albeit briefly, in wake of latest ECB sources claiming market expectations for an end 2019 rate hike would be too late, and with perhaps some added momentum from upbeat German data (industrial orders). Eur/Jpy also boosted by M&amp;A-related flows, but capped around 129.50 and just ahead of its 55 DMA (129.54).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is vying with the Eur for top G10 spot, but again largely on short covering, technical retracement and cross-winds, as Nzd/Usd remains supported above 0.6750 and Aud/Nzd slips below 1.0900, while Aud/Usd retreats further from 0.7400 on the persistent US-China/global trade war threat and declining metals prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD/CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All relative stable vs the Greenback, with Cable building a firmer base above 1.3200, but not able to clear 1.3250 and its 21 DMA just above ahead of a speech from BoE Governor Carney and the next big Brexit event (Chequers on Friday). The Loonie is essentially stuck around 1.3150, Franc equally tight within 0.9940-10 bounds and hardly responding to in line Swiss CPI data (albeit weaker vs the Eur circa 1.1600), while the Jpy hugs 110.50 eyeing decent expiries between there and 110.60 (1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onward and upward for the Krona, and latest catalyst comes in the form of strong Swedish data (industrial output), with further gains vs the Eur that is strong in its own right, as mentioned earlier &ndash; Eur/Sek inching close towards 10.2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds continue to fall after increasingly brief periods of consolidation, respite and flatter rebounds, with the 10 year debt future just registering a new Eurex low at 162.06, -49 ticks from yesterday&rsquo;s close, and Gilts have corrected lower from the Liffe open as anticipated, to a 122.83 base and 26 tick decline on the day. Aside from the hawkish ECB vibes, via sources, market contacts note that a chart gap was filled around 162.44 and Wednesday&rsquo;s 162.37 session base has subsequently been breached, along with a downside technical objective at 162.22 to expose 162.01 ahead of 161.85, while for Gilts the nearest technical support is now around 122.66. Elsewhere, US Treasuries also slipping deeper into negative territory and re-steepening a tad awaiting the return of market participants from their Independence Day celebrations and a busy line up of data, including anecdote/proxies for Friday&rsquo;s NFP report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices are down with WTI languishing around the USD 74 level after US President Trump reiterated his position on Twitter overnight vs. OPEC of prices being too high. Traders are now looking ahead to today&rsquo;s holiday-delayed DoE inventory report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope Gold is pulling back after hitting a one week high in yesterdays trade of USD 1,261/oz, currently at USD 1,253/oz. Base metals are slipping as the threat of a trade war looms, with zinc and nickel sulking around one-year lows. Copper is also being hit by these worries, with the bellwether metal down 2.8% in Shanghai.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, there were also reports that ministers warned PM May not to sidestep controversial Brexit issues at the meeting amid concern focus on customs may neglect issues such as services sector and freedom of movement. (Newswires/Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Downing Street has released some details of how EU-UK customs could be handled post-Brexit. The new plan (dubbed &quot;facilitated customs arrangement&quot;) would allow the UK to set its own tariffs on imports to the UK. Technology would be used beforehand to determine where the goods will end up, and whether UK or EU tariffs would apply. Downing Street is confident the arrangement would partly be in place by the end of the transition period in December 2020. The arrangement has not been explained in full - and it is not clear whether the cabinet will back the plan. (BBC) However, it was later reported that UK Brexit Secretary David Davis wrote to PM May in a last-ditch attempt to warn her that her Brexit plan to be presented at Chequers is unworkable as it is merely a customs arrangement with some technical adjustments. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB Supervisory Board Member Hakkarainen said 20 out of 50 UK banks and financial companies they had discussed exploring options on keeping banking passport with, have applied for a license to operate in EU in time to get approval before Brexit.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were uneventful amid a lack of tier-1 data and with participants looking ahead to the upcoming events for want of a better catalyst. As such, DXY was lacklustre following the Independence Day closure hangover and as its main counterparts across the pond traded little changed, with GBP also tentative ahead of PM May&rsquo;s third customs proposal at Chequers on Friday. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and antipodeans conformed to the tedious trade seen across currency markets, while price action in CNH was also calm despite the PBoC setting its firmest reference rate since October 2017 which was relatively in-line with Nomura projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were subdued with WTI crude futures declining back below the USD 74.00/bbl amid the risk averse tone and renewed calls by US President Trump for OPEC to lower prices, with focus now turning to today&rsquo;s holiday-delayed DoE inventory report. Elsewhere, gold traded sideways amid an uneventful greenback and tentativeness ahead of this week&rsquo;s FOMC minutes and NFP data, while the trade-triggered jitters and early pressure in Chinese commodity prices ensured a glum day in copper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that OPEC must remember gas prices are up and they are driving prices higher, while he urged them to reduce pricing now.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are somewhat indecisive ahead of this week&rsquo;s looming risk events including today&rsquo;s FOMC minutes and Friday&rsquo;s NFP jobs data, in which the varied tone also follows the market closure in US for Independence Day and a similarly mixed performance in European counterparts. ASX 200 (+0.4%) is positive with upside led by strength in telecoms and the heavily-weighted financials sector, while Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) struggles for direction and remains at the whim of the currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) trade choppy after the PBoC skipped open market operations for a net liquidity drain of CNY 140bln but which coincides with its previously announced targeted RRR cut taking effect, while the approaching July 6th tariffs between US &amp; China have also added to the cautiousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are uneventful amid a lack of tier-1 data and with participants looking ahead to the upcoming events for want of a better catalyst. &nbsp;&nbsp;As such, DXY is lacklustre following the Independence Day closure hangover and as its main counterparts across the pond trade little changed, with GBP also tentative ahead of PM May&rsquo;s third customs proposal at Chequers on Friday. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and antipodeans conform to the tedious trade seen across currency markets, while price action in CNH is also calm despite the PBoC setting its firmest reference rate since October 2017 which was relatively inline with Nomura projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid the non-committal tone in the region and ahead of a 30yr auction, while comments by BoJ Board Member Masai failed to spur price action in which she reiterated the BoJ&rsquo;s view that it is appropriate to continue with strong monetary easing, but also suggested that structural issues in the banking industry should be discussed independently from monetary easing.</p>\r\n",
