        "content": "<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore is expected to tighten policy at its semi-annual policy announcement today with 12 out of 19 analysts surveyed forecasting the central bank to slightly increase the appreciation rate or slope of the SGD Nominal Effective Exchange Rate from the current 0%. However, calls are nowhere near one-sided with the remaining analysts or 37% of total respondents advocating for no policy changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a guide, the MAS utilizes the exchange rate as its main policy tool in which it could tweak policy through either the mid-point, slope or width of the currency band. For example, the MAS could alter the mid-point of its SGD NEER band which if lowered, would effectively be easing policy by weakening the SGD against a basket of currencies. The central bank could also alter the slope of the trading band to adjust the path of the currency, or widen the width of the trading band which would be seen as a neutral measure but would allow the currency more room to fluctuate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expectations for a tighter policy stance have been supported by stronger growth as Singapore&#39;s economy expanded by 3.6% in 2017 vs. 2.4% in 2016, while improvement in the labour market and likely unwillingness to fall behind the curve are among the reasons being cited to likely spur a move from the MAS. In addition, there was a slight tweak in the central bank&#39;s statement in the last announcement 6 months ago which stated &#39;MAS had indicated in the October 2016 MPS that the neutral policy stance would be appropriate for an extended period&#39; vs. the April language that &#39;as indicated in the October 2016 MPS, a neutral policy stance is appropriate for an extended period&#39;. As such, some have suggested the change in statement was to likely pave the way for possible tightening this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, ongoing trade uncertainties from increased protectionist stances and MAS anticipation of subdued price pressures could encourage the MAS to keep its neutral stance. Furthermore, a firmer currency against the greenback with USD/SGD currently below 1.3100 vs. around 1.3600 during the last meeting could also support calls for the central bank to hold off on tightening its FX-based monetary policy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&#39;s announcement is due at 0100BST/1900CDT and will coincide with the release of Advanced GDP figures for Q1 (Q/Q Exp. 1.2%, Prev. 2.1%; Y/Y Exp. 4.3% Prev. 3.6%) although focus is likely to be centred on the policy announcement.</p>\r\n",

On earnings front today also saw Blackrock (BLK) beating on both the top and bottom line sending them to close higher than 1.5%, combined with the higher yields today led to financials outperforming which finished Thursday trade higher by 2%. Delta earnings beat expectations, posting record revenues in the face of strong demand, though fuel and labour costs were rising. On Friday, JPM, Wells Fargo and Citi report numbers before the market open. JPM expected to report 2.28 eps on 27.7bln of revenue, Wells expected to report 1.06 eps on 21.7bln, and Citi expected to report 1.61 eps on revenues of 18.9bln. SPX +0.83% at 2664, NDX +1.11% at 6656 , DJI +1.21% at 24483.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury yields were higher on Thursday with short-dated yields up by 4bps and long-end yields up around 5bps by settlement, although most of the selling was in the belly of the curve. Selling pressure was seen pre-market after Trump&rsquo;s tweet hinted that military action might not be in the offing. Even later in the session, when it emerged the US was close to military action, the Treasury complex struggled to catch a bid. The US completed this week&rsquo;s supply offering with an auction of 30-year bonds, which stopped through the screens by 0.1bps, the strongest auction this week. Traders were encouraged by the direct bidders after the weakness seen this week, while indirects took down 61%, in line with recent averages. US 10yr T-Notes settle 12 ticks lower at 120-15.</p>\r\n",

Trump is meeting with US officials tonight, and there is an expectation that military action could be announced imminently. US officials also confirmed evidence of chemical weapons from victims involved in the chemical attack in Syria. Finally, in late trade, Russia requested a UN security council meeting on Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS:</strong> Further positive comments on the NAFTA front were seen today, with US President Trump noting there is not a set timeline for talks, but he is confident a deal is close, and it could take weeks or months as negotiations are &quot;coming along great&rdquo;. US Trade Representative Lighthizer and Republican Senator Cornyn have both echoed Trump&rsquo;s language adding some positivity on the proximity of an agreement, alongside which Ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft added the countries are working towards a modern pact. Separately, the USTR said to have lowered regional value content demand for NAFTA cars to 75%, while the Times reported that Canadian PM Trudeau is confident US will not put a steel tariff on Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB</strong> Accounts from March Meeting noted widespread concerns about the potential impact of trade wars. Policymakers said FX is a source of uncertainty, though past appreciation has not had a marked impact on demand, and euro strength was not fully due to macro environment, and may have a more negative impact on inflation. Policymakers also said gradual communication adjustments are required, inflation path close to sustained adjustment, but majority say it is not sufficient. It also said that monetary support still required after the end of bond purchases. Reaction was muted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB SPEAK</strong>: ECB&#39;s Coeure said current monetary policy position is appropriate, and that the outlook for productivity growth may be less concerning than current figures suggest. Coeure also said that the possibility of larger-than-estimated slack does not mean that monetary policy will have to remain unchanged, while he also expects the central bank&#39;s key rates will remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, in line with ECB&#39;s current guidance. Elsewhere, the ECB&#39;s Weidmann said price stability goal must not be weakened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BANXICO:</strong> Mexico holds rates at 7.50%, as expected; unanimous decision. Banxico also notes that balance of risks to growth is on the downside, but upward bias in inflation. Crucially, it noted that NAFTA risks had recently eased slightly. There was no reaction in the peso.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX +0.83% at 2664, NDX +1.11% at 6656 , DJI +1.21% at 24483&nbsp; SECTORS: CONS CYC (XLY): +0.45%, CONS NON-CYC (XLP): -0.19%, ENERGY (XLE): -0.01%, FINANCIALS (XLF): +1.82%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +0.64%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): +1.45%, MATERIALS (XLB): +1.07%, TECH (XLK): +1.29%, TELECOMS (XTL): -0.03%, UTLITIES (XLU): -1.28%.</strong>&nbsp; US equity futures traded higher on Thursday trade, boosted in the morning by US President Trump&rsquo;s tweets, which put some Syrian tensions to ease. Futures also jumped at the US cash open and carried on the upward trend for most of the session, until reports suggested that the US is planning to strike eight targets in Syria (however this was never officially confirmed) and the markets resumed the buying trend. The S&amp;P was led by Incyte (INCY) and MGM Resorts (MGM), INCY were upgraded to buy from neutral at UBS, and MGM were supported by reports from WSJ that it is in early talks to purchase Wynn Resorts&rsquo; (WYNN) Boston-area Casino Project. L-Brands (LB) lagged as the company&rsquo;s PINK brand&rsquo;s saw sales fall in March. McDonald&rsquo;s (MCD) hampered the DJI today following reports which suggested workers in Kentucky may have spread Hepatitis A to some customers; and on the flip side, Intel (INTC) and Boeing (BA) led the DJI. In M&amp;A news, Takeda (4502 JT) reportedly seeks several trillions of JPY worth of loans as it looks to acquire Shire (SHPG) which closed among the best performers in NDX. Also, General Electric (GE) are considering merging its units with other public companies, or an IPO or spinoff of its Transportation unit, as an alternative to asset sales. Later trade today saw rumours that Warren Buffet&rsquo;s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) was reportedly ready to make an announcement for the takeover of Southwest Airlines (LUV), which gave a boost to all airline names, which finished trade well in the green, however these reports were unconfirmed. On earnings front today also saw Blackrock (BLK) beating on both the top and bottom line sending them to close higher than 1.5%, combined with the higher yields today led to financials outperforming which finished Thursday trade higher by 2%. Delta earnings beat expectations, posting record revenues in the face of strong demand, though fuel and labour costs were rising. On Friday, JPM, Wells Fargo and Citi report numbers before the market open. JPM expected to report 2.28 eps on 27.7bln of revenue, Wells expected to report 1.06 eps on 21.7bln, and Citi expected to report 1.61 eps on revenues of 18.9bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE:</strong> <strong>WTI (May) settles 25 cents higher at USD 67.07 per barrel and Brent (June) settles down 4 cents at USD 72.02 per barrel.&nbsp;</strong>The geopolitical pressure contained in crude prices was unwound slightly on Thursday, helped along by cryptic Trump tweets that were interpreted as constructive for risk. However, that geopolitical risk premium began re-entering crude prices in the US afternoon, after suggestions that US military action in Syria was likely to be forthcoming. Elsewhere, OPEC upped its global oil demand view for 2018; the cartel also said OPEC crude production decreased 201k bpd in March to average 31.96mln bpd, according to secondary sources. OPEC Sec Gen Barkindo said OPEC compliance was over 150% in March, and over 120% for non-OPEC members; Barkindo added that longer-term alliance between OPEC/Non-OPEC will be discussed in June, and he is confident that the supply cut deal will be extended beyond 2018, and he sees oil market rebalancing in Q2/Q3 2018 (previous saw it rebalancing by end-2018). Analysts were also updating their forecasts on Thursday; Barclays now raised its Brent and WTI forecasts by $3 to $63/bbl and $58/bbl respectively. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, cut its crude forecast for WTI and Brent to $70.60/bbl and $75.51/bbl respectively (against a previous of $72.50/bbl and $77.50/bbl).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>US 10yr T-Notes settle 12 ticks lower at 120-15.</strong>&nbsp;US Treasury yields were higher on Thursday with short-dated yields up by 4bps and long-end yields up around 5bps by settlement, although most of the selling was in the belly of the curve. Selling pressure was seen pre-market after Trump&rsquo;s tweet hinted that<strong> </strong>military action might not be in the offing. Even later in the session, when it emerged the US was close to military action, the Treasury complex struggled to catch a bid. The US completed this week&rsquo;s supply offering with an auction of 30-year bonds, which stopped through the screens by 0.1bps, the strongest auction this week. Traders were encouraged by the direct bidders after the weakness seen this week, while indirects took down 61%, in line with recent averages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX</strong>: DXY on a firmer footing and not far from 90.000, with initial relatively limited upside seen on hawkish elements of the March FOMC minutes on Wednesday, but more momentum building after US President Trump&rsquo;s tweets about Syria that suggested less urgency in terms of the timing of any military action; however, gains were slightly pared in later trade after it became clear that US military action may still be imminent. CAD/EUR/JPY/CHF all victims of broad Greenback recovery to an extent, with USDCAD hovering either side of the 1.2600 figure in late trade; the Loonie was also undermined by weaker than expected Canadian house price data. EURUSD failed or faded again just ahead of 1.24, and then recoiled to test bids/support at the big figure below in wake of dovish/cautious ECB minutes that highlight policy divergence from not just the Fed, but BoE too, and EURGBP finally breached 0.8700 to the downside before triggering stops through 0.8690 on its way down to circa 0.8665. USDJPY held just under well documented big 107.00 option strikes prior to Trump and then cleared the key level and absorbed at least some reported export offers ahead of recent highs that also align with the next upside pivot around 107.50-55.&nbsp; GBP/NZD/AUD: Bucking the overall trend or at least holding up better than G10 counterparts, with Cable rebounding to 1.42 again amidst talk of real money and sovereign buying interest on dips. NZD faded from best levels close to 0.7400, but kept ahead of AUD as the cross pivoted around 1.0500 and AUDUSD slipped under 0.7750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending the session on a firmer footing and not far from 90.000, with initial relatively limited upside seen on hawkish elements of the March FOMC minutes, but more momentum building after US President Trump&rsquo;s latest tweet about Syria that suggested less urgency in terms of the timing of any military action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD/EUR/JPY/CHF </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All net losers and victims of the broad Greenback recovery to an extent, with Usd/Cad back over 1.2600 and the Loonie also undermined by weaker than expected Canadian house price data. Eur/Usd failed or faded again just ahead of 1.2400, and then recoiled to test bids/support at the big figure below in wake of dovish/cautious ECB minutes that highlight policy divergence from not just the Fed, but BoE too, and Eur/Gbp finally breached 0.8700 to the downside before triggering stops through 0.8690 on its way down to circa 0.8665. Usd/Jpy held just under well documented big 107.00 option strikes prior to Trump and then cleared the key level and absorbed at least some reported export offers ahead of recent highs that also align with the next upside pivot around 107.50-55.&nbsp; Usd/Chf relatively bid throughout, but extended gains to almost 0.9650 and not much further from the 200 DMA (0.9668).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP/NZD/AUD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bucking the overall trend or at least holding up better than G10 counterparts, with Cable rebounding to 1.4200 again amidst talk of real money and sovereign buying interest on dips. Nzd/Usd faded from best levels close to 0.7400, but kept ahead of Aud as the cross pivoted around 1.0500 and Aud/Usd slipped under 0.7750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK/NOK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes for the Scandi currencies, as Eur/Sek spiked on softer than expected Swedish inflation and house price updates, but Eur/Nok retreated further from post sub-consensus Norwegian CPI peaks following more Norges Bank guidance via Governor Olsen for a post-Summer hike. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This saw a lacklustre tone for ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%), although losses were contained as fears of an imminent strike on Syria abated with the White House National Security Council to meet on Thursday afternoon to decide on its response. Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) also conformed to the overall gloom after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations again and amid weakness in Shanghai metals trade, while Hang Seng (+0.3%) initially bucked the trend as blue-chip energy stocks were underpinned after geopolitical concerns buoyed oil prices but then gradually fell in-line with its peers. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful despite the weakness in Japanese stocks and after a 30yr auction was also ignored despite showing higher b/c and accepted prices than prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skips open market operations again today.

This is at odds with a previous report suggesting that officials could be looking to keep the UK in the Customs Union given the potential disadvantages of leaving. (WSJ/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German economy ministry says economic upswing continues but at a slightly weaker pace, adds consumer demand has been less dynamic, but trading sentiment remains optimistic.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are trading mixed in early trade, with traders awaiting any clarity on the Syria situation. As such, with little in the way of broad price action across the major indices, a bulk of the focus has fallen upon individual movers with Carrefour (-5.6%) softer after releasing uninspiring financial results for Q1. Shire (+2.8%) shares are higher amid reports that Takeda is seeking several JPY trillion worth of loans as it seeks to acquire the Co. Additionally, Volkswagen (+1.5%) have been supported after announcing their plan to IPO their trucks division in Q1 2019, alongside news that the automaker plans a management board seat for workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX, the broad USD and Index has derived a degree of underlying support from more hawkish tones within the latest FOMC minutes. NZD continues to fly and outpace its antipodean peer with the cross seriously testing support around 1.0500 and a major downside technical area just below (1.0494-83 represents a 3 year rising trendline on some charts). NZD/USD is edging closer to 0.7400, while AUD/USD is still encountering resistance ahead of heavy supply at 0.7790, although a high profile US bank has gone long via a technical trade, targeting 0.7915-90 and perhaps even 0.8100. SEK, like its Scandi neighbour yesterday undermined by softer than forecast inflation data on balance, albeit with the underlying Swedish CPIF measure back to the Riksbank&rsquo;s 2% objective and likely to keep rate hike prospects by the end of 2018 intact. EUR/SEK currently around the top of a 10.3770-2950 range. GBP/EUR/JPY seeing hardly any movement vs the USD, with Cable capped just below 1.4200 amidst a raft of headlines from UK Brexit Minister Davis, but nothing new on transition deal terms ahead of a speech from BoE Governor Carney later. EUR/USD still not really threatening 1.2400 offers and looking for independent impetus from ECB policy minutes after mixed messages of late. Note also, hefty option expiry interest at 1.2345 today (1.2 bn) could be exerting a downward pull. USD/JPY also caught between big expiry-related flow at 107.00 and bearish impulses due to Syria, trade and more general geopolitical/global tensions. CAD and CHF are the current G10 laggards or relative underperformers with the Loonie unwinding some NAFTA and oil inspired gains to trade back circa 1.2600 vs the USD, and Franc still trending lower vs the USD and EUR amidst the suspicion of official selling to curb and safe-haven demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much upside momentum in Bunds on the back of a pretty bad Eurozone ip data miss, which in truth was on the cards after sub-forecast releases from several member states. However, Bunds have ticked up again following a retreat to marginal news Eurex lows at 159.35 alongside Gilts that are paring losses from -15 ticks at one stage. In the Eurozone periphery, some post auction fall out in BTPs was observed but the 10y future is now paring losses. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are a few ticks off overnight lows amidst yet more curve steepening as the Fed appears to have adopted a more aggressive view on rates, albeit a certain faction of the FOMC policy panel. On the data front, weekly claims may garner more attention than normal and last Friday&rsquo;s disappointing NFP headline print, while 30 year supply could warrant a bit more concession given tepid 3 and 10 year results. But the central focus is Syria (with US-China and global trade wars rather side-lined for the moment) ahead of UK an US meetings to discuss whether a strike is the only option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures trade relatively flat and in close proximity to recent highs as prices retain their geopolitical risk premium. This comes as traders await any updates on the Syrian situation with the White House National Security Council due to meet later today and decide their response. The UK will also be carrying out an equivalent meeting with the latest reports suggesting that UK submarines are within range for strikes on Syria which could begin as soon as tonight. This comes amid reports that Russia is anticipating information on the US&rsquo; Syrian targets and is said to be getting countermeasures ready. In metals markets, spot gold continues to linger in modest negative territory amid the fallout of the slightly more hawkish than anticipated FOMC release last night. Elsewhere,&nbsp; copper mirrored the subdued risk tone overnight and was pressured in tandem with weakness in Shanghai metals trade, whilst Palladium prices continue to move higher amid the fallout of Russian sanctions.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: Markets holding fire in anticipation of Middle-East action",
        "content": "<p>European equities are trading mixed in early trade, with traders awaiting any clarity on the Syria situation. As such, with little in the way of broad price action across the major indices, a bulk of the focus has fallen upon individual movers with Carrefour (-5.6%) softer after releasing uninspiring financial results for Q1. Shire (+2.8%) shares are higher amid reports that Takeda is seeking several JPY trillion worth of loans as it seeks to acquire the Co. Additionally, Volkswagen (+1.5%) have been supported after announcing their plan to IPO their trucks division in Q1 2019, alongside news that the automaker plans a management board seat for workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX, the broad USD and Index has derived a degree of underlying support from more hawkish tones within the latest FOMC minutes, but the Greenback remains mixed vs G10 rivals and DXY unable to bounce meaningfully above 89.500 as a result. NZD continues to fly and outpace its antipodean peer with the cross seriously testing support around 1.0500 and a major downside technical area just below (1.0494-83 represents a 3 year rising trendline on some charts). NZD/USD is edging closer to 0.7400, while AUD/USD is still encountering resistance ahead of heavy supply at 0.7790, although a high profile US bank has gone long via a technical trade, targeting 0.7915-90 and perhaps even 0.8100. SEK, like its Scandi neighbour yesterday undermined by softer than forecast inflation data on balance, albeit with the underlying Swedish CPIF measure back to the Riksbank&rsquo;s 2% objective and likely to keep rate hike prospects by the end of 2018 intact. EUR/SEK currently around the top of a 10.3770-2950 range. GBP/EUR/JPY seeing hardly any movement vs the USD, with Cable capped just below 1.4200 amidst a raft of headlines from UK Brexit Minister Davis, but nothing new on transition deal terms ahead of a speech from BoE Governor Carney later. EUR/USD still not really threatening 1.2400 offers and looking for independent impetus from ECB policy minutes after mixed messages of late. Note also, hefty option expiry interest at 1.2345 today (1.2 bn) could be exerting a downward pull. USD/JPY also caught between big expiry-related flow at 107.00 and bearish impulses due to Syria, trade and more general geopolitical/global tensions. CAD and CHF are the current G10 laggards or relative underperformers with the Loonie unwinding some NAFTA and oil inspired gains to trade back circa 1.2600 vs the USD, and Franc still trending lower vs the USD and EUR amidst the suspicion of official selling to curb and safe-haven demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much upside momentum in Bunds on the back of a pretty bad Eurozone ip data miss, which in truth was on the cards after sub-forecast releases from several member states. However, Bunds have ticked up again following a retreat to marginal news Eurex lows at 159.38 alongside Gilts that are paring losses from -15 ticks at one stage. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are a few ticks off overnight lows amidst yet more curve steepening as the Fed appears to have adopted a more aggressive view on rates, albeit a certain faction of the FOMC policy panel. On the data front, weekly claims may garner more attention than normal and last Friday&rsquo;s disappointing NFP headline print, while 30 year supply could warrant a bit more concession given tepid 3 and 10 year results. But the central focus is Syria (with US-China and global trade wars rather side-lined for the moment) ahead of UK an US meetings to discuss whether a strike is the only option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures trade relatively flat and in close proximity to recent highs as prices retain their geopolitical risk premium. This comes as traders await any updates on the Syrian situation with the White House National Security Council due to meet later today and decide their response. The UK will also be carrying out an equivalent meeting with the latest reports suggesting that UK submarines are within range for strikes on Syria which could begin as soon as tonight. This comes amid reports that Russia is anticipating information on the US&rsquo; Syrian targets and is said to be getting countermeasures ready. In metals markets, spot gold continues to linger in modest negative territory amid the fallout of the slightly more hawkish than anticipated FOMC release last night. Elsewhere, &nbsp;copper mirrored the subdued risk tone overnight and was pressured in tandem with weakness in Shanghai metals trade, whilst Palladium prices continue to move higher amid the fallout of Russian sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

However, Bunds have ticked up again following a retreat to marginal news Eurex lows at 159.38 alongside Gilts that are paring losses from -15 ticks at one stage. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are a few ticks off overnight lows amidst yet more curve steepening as the Fed appears to have adopted a more aggressive view on rates, albeit a certain faction of the FOMC policy panel. On the data front, weekly claims may garner more attention than normal and last Friday&rsquo;s disappointing NFP headline print, while 30 year supply could warrant a bit more concession given tepid 3 and 10 year results. But the central focus is Syria (with US-China and global trade wars rather side-lined for the moment) ahead of UK an US meetings to discuss whether a strike is the only option.</p>\r\n",

Note also, hefty option expiry interest at 1.2345 today (1.2 bn) could be exerting a downward pull. Usd/Jpy also caught between big expiry-related flow at 107.00 and bearish impulses due to Syria, trade and more general geopolitical/global tensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current G10 laggards or relative underperformers with the Loonie unwinding some NAFTA and oil inspired gains to trade back circa 1.2600 vs the Usd, and Franc still trending lower vs the Usd and Eur amidst the suspicion of official selling to curb and safe-haven demand.</p>\r\n",

There was some knee-jerk buying of Treasuries as US President Trump ramped-up the rhetoric, telling Russia to &lsquo;expect missiles&rsquo; in Syria, and the buying pushed 30-year yields to beneath the 3.00% handle, while 10s visited 2.75%. The Treasury&rsquo;s 10-year auction was soft, seeing a tail of 0.5bps (recent averages suggested it would come in on the screws).&nbsp; The internals were grim, with indirect participation the lowest since January 2015, leaving directs and dealers with participation above recent averages. The soft auction had surprised a few analysts, particularly amid demand for haven assets today, as the US prepares military action in Syria.

This saw a lacklustre tone for ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%), although losses were contained as fears of an imminent strike on Syria abated with the White House National Security Council to meet on Thursday afternoon to decide on its response. Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) also conformed to the overall gloom after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations again and amid weakness in Shanghai metals trade, while Hang Seng (+0.3%) initially bucked the trend as blue chip energy stocks were underpinned after geopolitical concerns buoyed oil prices but then gradually fell in-line with its peers. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful despite the weakness in Japanese stocks and after a 30yr auction was also ignored despite showing higher b/c and accepted prices than prior.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade subdued after a negative lead from US with sentiment dampened amid heightened geopolitical tensions after US President Trump warned that missiles will be coming to Syria, while markets also digest a more hawkish tone in the FOMC minutes which stated that a number of policymakers said the economic outlook implies a steeper rise in Fed Funds Rate over the next few years than previously expected. This has resulted to a lacklustre tone for ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch), although losses are contained as fears of an imminent strike on Syria have since abated with the White House National Security Council to meet on Thursday afternoon to decide on its response. Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) also conforms to the overall gloom after the PBoC skipped liquidity operations again and amid weakness in Shanghai metals trade, while Hang Seng (+0.5%) bucks the trend with blue chip energy stocks underpinned after geopolitical concerns buoyed oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback attempted to nurse recent losses with DXY briefly supported from a hawkish FOMC minutes in which all members saw higher inflation and GDP, while several advocated that the future Fed&rsquo;s Fund Rate will likely need to be above its longer-run normal value for a time and that future FOMC statements may need to signal that policy will shift to a neutral or restraining factor for the economy. This saw a pullback in the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts with GBP/USD meeting resistance just shy of the 1.4200 handle, while AUD/USD is indecisive as support from higher oil prices is counterbalanced by weakness across the metals complex. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is choppy below the 107.00 handle, while HKD briefly touched the weakest point of the trading band against USD at 7.85 for the first time in which the HKMA is obligated to intervene in the FX market and buy HKD.<br /><br />Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful alongside an indecisive tone for Japanese stocks and with participants awaiting a 30yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
