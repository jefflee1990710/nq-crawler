However, as traders gathered their composure, the attention&nbsp;moved back towards the narrative of a weaker USD in 2018, and as stocks surged amid risk-on, the buck slipped. Additionally, there is nothing to suggest that terminal rates will be higher in this rate-rising cycle, and indeed, many are now focusing on the idea of stagflation. The EUR recouped losses against the buck, almost touching 1.2450, the GBP action was capped by 1.40. Havens found a bid as the dollar weakened, with gold a particular outperformer, rising to $1,355, however, the JPY was resilient to other moves in the day, trading in around a 1 figure range (106.70 to 107.90), though remains above 107 (just) as we approach Asia trade. Commodity FX tracked crude higher. In EMFX, ZAR was up by over 2.5% strengthening as Zuma resigned as president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa President Zuma resigned and stated that has been compelled to resign by his party</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk504673747\">COMMODITIES</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI futures settled $1.41 higher at $60.60 per barrel; Brent futures settle $61.64 higher at $64.36 per barrel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks (w/e 9th Feb 2018): 1.841M vs. Exp. 2.825M (Prev. 1.895M). (Newswires)<br />US crude production +0.2% to 10.271mln bpd.

Cushing stocks fell by more than expected, though products were firmer than forecast. In early US trade, crude was also buttressed by comments from Saudi Arabia and Russia: Oil Minister Al Falih said Saudi Arabia will invest for maximum oil output capacity, expecting oil production at 100,000bpd below February levels, adding that global oil supply is under control, demand has been growing by around 1.5mln BPD for three years. His Russian counterpart Novak said the global deal with OPEC will end &quot;sooner or later&quot; and that deal participants will look not only at supply and demand balance but on investments and USD rate. It was only after crude was helped by a soft dollar that the $60 handle gave way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk506409081\">GEOPOLITICAL </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Vice President Pence stated the US is open to conversation with North Korea but noted sanctions will not be removed until the regimes nuclear programme is cancelled, while he also stated that the US has viable military options to deal with the situations but hopes to solve it with peaceful means. (Newswires)<br /><br /><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an immediate reaction to strong CPI data/weak retail sales data, equities skidded lower, and in pre-market action, the emini shed 40 points to 2630 on the notion that the data will give the FOMC more fuel to continue reducing its accommodation, with four hikes in 2018 now becoming a baseline view for more, and more market participants (the FOMC itself has forecast three hikes in 2018). That in itself is a problematic view, some say, arguing that the terminal rate it probably a better focal point, and nothing about today&rsquo;s data suggest that there will be a higher peak of the Federal Funds Rate in this hiking cycle. As cash trade got underway, equities bounced back, with the emini eventually rising towards 2700, though seemed unable to breach that level. Many traders noted that the initial sell-off to the data was somewhat overdone given that the health of corporate America is still in good shape (corporate earnings have looked good &ndash; thus far, 72% of the 354 S&amp;P 500 companies that had reported at the end of play yesterday had beat expectations, some desk note, while February dividend flows remain a supporting factor), while some took comfort from the Nasdaq punching above its 50dma. The equity surge came amid another fall in VIX, with the index falling to beneath 20 on Wednesday. Spooz have now printed straight four days of gains. S&amp;P +1.3% at 2699, Nasdaq100 +1.9% at 6675, DJIA +1% at 24893.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top sectors: Technology +1.57%, Consumer Cyclicals +1.30% and Energy +1.29%<br />Bottom sectors: Utilities -0.72%, Telecom -0.68% and Consumer Non Cyclicals -0.01%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields were higher across the curve after solid CPI data raised the prospects of further Fed hikes in 2018. Once again, most of the action was in the belly, with 10-year yields rising to four-year highs above 2.90% (+7bps at settlement). Longer-end yields didn&rsquo;t rise as aggressively, with 30s up by 5bps at settlement, outperforming the short-end, where yields on 2s were +7bps and 5s were +9bps.&nbsp; The probability of a March hike rose above 80%, according to money market pricing; the probability of three 2018 rate rises rose to 64% from 50% at the close of play on Tuesday, while the chances of four hikes jumped to 26% from 17% yesterday. Tomorrow, the US Treasury will auction USD 7bln in 30-year TIPS. US 10yr T-Notes settle down 21+ ticks at 120-10+.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: Markets shake-off early CPI/retail-induced weakness as risk returns",
        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES: S&amp;P +1.3% at 2699, Nasdaq100 +1.9% at 6675, DJIA +1% at 24893</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top sectors: Technology +1.57%, Consumer Cyclicals +1.30% and Energy +1.29%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom sectors: Utilities -0.72%, Telecom -0.68% and Consumer Non Cyclicals -0.01%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an immediate reaction to strong CPI data/weak retail sales data, equities skidded lower, and in pre-market action, the emini shed 40 points to 2630 on the notion that the data will give the FOMC more fuel to continue reducing its accommodation, with four hikes in 2018 now becoming a baseline view for more, and more market participants (the FOMC itself has forecast three hikes in 2018). That in itself is a problematic view, some say, arguing that the terminal rate it probably a better focal point, and nothing about today&rsquo;s data suggest that there will be a higher peak of the Federal Funds Rate in this hiking cycle. As cash trade got underway, equities bounced back, with the emini eventually rising towards 2700, though seemed unable to breach that level. Many traders noted that the initial sell-off to the data was somewhat overdone given that the health of corporate America is still in good shape (corporate earnings have looked good &ndash; thus far, 72% of the 354 S&amp;P 500 companies that had reported at the end of play yesterday had beat expectations, some desk note, while February dividend flows remain a supporting factor), while some took comfort from the Nasdaq punching above its 50dma. The equity surge came amid another fall in VIX, with the index falling to beneath 20 on Wednesday. Spooz have now printed straight four days of gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US 10yr T-Notes settle down 21+ ticks at 120-10+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields were higher across the curve after solid CPI data raised the prospects of further Fed hikes in 2018. Once again, most of the action was in the belly, with 10-year yields rising to four-year highs above 2.90% (+7bps at settlement). Longer-end yields didn&rsquo;t rise as aggressively, with 30s up by 5bps at settlement, outperforming the short-end, where yields on 2s were +7bps and 5s were +9bps.&nbsp; The probability of a March hike rose above 80%, according to money market pricing; the probability of three 2018 rate rises rose to 64% from 50% at the close of play on Tuesday, while the chances of four hikes jumped to 26% from 17% yesterday. Tomorrow, the US Treasury will auction USD 7bln in 30-year TIPS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dollar was strongly boosted in wake of CPI data beating expectations across the board, with the DXY falling to just above 89.00 (though the level held). However, as traders gathered their composure, the focussed moved back towards the narrative a weaker USD in 2018, and as stocks surged amid risk-on, the buck slipped. Additionally, there is nothing to suggest that terminal rates will be higher in this rate-rising cycle, and indeed, many are now focussing on the idea of stagflation. The EUR recouped losses against the buck, almost touching 1.2450, the GBP action was capped by 1.40. Havens found a bid as the dollar weakened, with gold a particular outperformer, rising to $1,355, however, the JPY was resilient to other moves in the day, trading in around a 1 figure range (106.70 to 107.90), though remains above 107 (just) as we approach Asia trade. Commodity FX tracked crude higher. In EMFX, ZAR was up by over 2.5% strengthening as Zuma resigns as president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle $1.41 higher at $60.60 per barrel; Brent futures settle $61.64 higher at $64.36 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A smaller than expected build helped lift crude prices, though the $60 mark was proving to be tough resistance. Cushing stocks fell by more than expected, though products were firmer than forecast. In early US trade, crude was also buttressed by comments from Saudi Arabia and Russia: Oil Minister Al Falih said Saudi Arabia will invest for maximum oil output capacity, expecting oil production at 100,000bpd below February levels, adding that global oil supply is under control, demand has been growing by around 1.5mln BPD for three years. His Russian counterpart Novak said the global deal with OPEC will end &quot;sooner or later&quot; and that deal participants will look not only at supply and demand balance but on investments and USD rate. It was only after crude was helped by a soft dollar that the $60 handle gave way.</p>\r\n",

However, the DXY did manage to extend its recovery to just over 90.000 at one stage as other G10 pairings responded to the more hawkish Fed policy implications from headline CPI not just surpassing expectations, but also the 2% y/y level. Eur/Usd retreated below 1.2300 before grinding higher again towards big option expiry interest in the 1.2300-10 area (2 bn) and then beyond after the NY cut, while Cable tested support just ahead of 1.3800, which held in and also prefaced a rebound to 1.3900+ again in choppy trading conditions. Usd/Cad jumped to almost 1.2650, but is now back down below 1.2600, though still underpinned ahead of daily cloud chart support at 1.2555. Nzd/Usd recaptured the 0.7300 handle after declining to sub-0.7250, but Aud/Usd remained top heavy under 0.7900 as the Aud/Nzd was anchored near 1.0700. Usd/Chf tracked the overall risk-averse then risk-on, at least less sour turnaround within a wide 0.9300-75 range. In short, not much love for the Dollar on February 14.</p>\r\n",

Perhaps, and perversely fixed is drawing some support from the sell-off in stocks ahead of the Wal Street open, as investors are unnerved by the hawkish Fed implications. At the short end, Eurodollar futures getting sold heavily. Meanwhile, the Dollar has benefited almost across the board and posting fresh session highs vs all majors and other currency peers, bar the Jpy that continues to run up against 107.50 offers and looks more prone to another sub-107.00 test and approach towards 106.50 barriers.

        "subject": "PREVIEW: US CPI (Jan) and Retail Sales (Jan) to be released on 14 February at 1330 GMT/0830 ET",
        "content": "<p>After January&rsquo;s nonfarm payroll data showed wage inflation rising above expectations, attention will be on the January CPI data for confirmation of the trend in price pressures. In wake of the Jan NFP data, markets aggressively repriced their expectations for Fed rates hikes in 2018. Some suggest that a disappointing print raises the potential of a correction to that pricing, while a beat may give credence to the notion that the Fed may lift rates more than three times in 2018, as it forecast in its most recent economic projections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also worth paying particular attention to the retail sales data, with some desks noting that the data will give a strong indication of how the American consumer is really feeling; if wages are rising, it should be reflected in retail spending. Some have also argued that sales-driven strength in the economy would be more likely to compel the Fed to hike four times in 2018, rather than a further pick-up in CPI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CONSUMER PRICES:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- CPI Y/Y (Jan) expected at 1.9% vs previous 2.1% (range 1.8% to 2.3%)<br />- CPI M/M (Jan) expected at 0.3% vs previous upwardly revised 0.2% (range 0.2% to 0.4%)<br />- Core CPI Y/Y (Jan) expected at 1.7% vs previous 1.8% (range 1.6% to 2.0%)<br />- Core CPI M/M (Jan) expected at 0.2% vs previous downwardly revised 0.2% (range 0.1% to 0.3%)<br />- Real weekly earnings M/M (Jan) expected at -0.3% vs previous 0.2% (range -0.5% to 0.3%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rise in gasoline prices (5% seasonally adjusted in January) will likely apply upward pressure on the headline CPI M/M. NatGas prices were also higher on account of the colder weather conditions in the US &ndash; both will see energy inflation rise, analysts believe. Meanwhile, PPI data signals that food prices will continue to rise, Capital Economics believes. Core inflation is seen rising, with vehicle prices still rising despite the post-hurricane surge in demand. And PPI data suggests clothing prices may rise on increased cotton costs. &nbsp;It is worth noting that the January CPI data will incorporate three methodological changes (geographic sample, used car pricing, and mobile phone pricing all being amended). &ldquo;These changes are likely to increase the volatility of monthly core CPI inflation,&rdquo; UBS writes, but the changes are less likely to impact long-term CPI volatility. UBS believes that the methodology changes will, overall, likely be small on CPI inflation over time. While mobile phone prices will present downside forces, cell phones make up less than 0.1% of the CPI sample, so UBS estimates the impact will be minimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RETAIL SALES:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Retail sales M/M (Jan) expected at 0.2% vs previous 0.4% (range -0.2% to 0.6%)<br />- Retail control group M/M (Jan) expected at 0.4% vs previous 0.3% (range 0.0% to 0.5%)<br />- Retail sales ex-autos M/M (Jan) no forecasts, previous 0.4%<br />- Retail sales ex-autos and gas M/M (Jan) no forecasts, previous 0.4%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After solid performance in Q4, retail sales growth is seen starting 2018 on a softer note. Weaker autos sales data for January has led to some analysts lowering their expectations for retail sales growth (some suggest that it could shave 2% off of retail auto sales). However, gasoline prices rose by around 5% in the month on a seasonally adjusted basis, which presents some upside for gasoline station sales. The control group measure may fare slightly better: &ldquo;Excluding autos, gasoline and building materials, control group retail sales surged by an unsustainable 9.8% in the fourth quarter,&rdquo; Capital Economics says, &ldquo;they are now well above their previous trend, so we wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they held steady or even declined in January.&rdquo; CapEco says that this would likely result in a 0.1% fall in headline retail sales in January, which wouldn&rsquo;t be too disappointing, and would leave the Y/Y measure at a healthy 4.6%.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%)</strong> and <strong>Hang Seng (+2.3%)</strong> were resilient with Hong Kong propped up by strength amongst financials. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher amid a risk-averse tone in Japan and alongside overnight gains in USTs, while the 5yr JGB auction results were somewhat inconclusive and failed to impact prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations.

In terms of sector specifics, financials have been in focus following earnings from <strong>Credit Suisse (+3.2%)</strong> who sit at the top of the SMI with gains for the sector mildly offset by <strong>Credit Agricole (-2.1%)</strong> who failed to appease investors with their latest statement. Elsewhere, energy names lag their peers alongside price action for WTI and Brent in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s API build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early focus on the Swedish Krona and a knee-jerk reaction to Riksbank Ohlsson&rsquo;s objection against holding the repo rate steady at -0.5%. <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Sek</strong> briefly dropped below 9.8750 as the hawkish Board member dissented in favour of a 25 basis point hike before rebounding towards pre-policy verdict session highs (around 9.9200) on the unchanged guidance for tightening in H2 this year, slightly softer inflation outlook and caveat that more easing remains an option if favourable economic conditions change. Thereafter, SEK was placed under pressure during Jansson&rsquo;s presser after stating that the Bank discussed whether to delat the first rate hike path.Meanwhile, the <strong>Jpy</strong> continued its sharp appreciation vs the Dollar and other major currency counterparts overnight, with <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong> taking out the 2017 low circa 107.30, and reported big barriers at 107.00 to record a fresh multi-year base around 106.85. However, spec short covering has subsequently pushed the pair back up over the 107.00 level to test offers around 107.50, and this has helped the <strong>DXY</strong> recover 89.500+ status. <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> looks flanked by bids and offers at 1.2350 and 1.2400 respectively, with hefty option expiries in the vicinity of those range extremes also likely to provide support and resistance (2.6 bn between 1.2335-50 and 2 bn from 1.2400-05). Other <strong>Usd</strong>/G10s are also relatively rangebound, but the Kiwi is outperforming after a rise in NZ inflation expectations, with <strong>Nzd</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> back above 0.7300. In the EM region, <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Zar</strong> remains in the spotlight and back near recent lows around 11.8500 awaiting a response from President Zuma to the latest ANC party &lsquo;requests&rsquo; to stand down, while raids on Gupta family residences have resulted in several arrests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core bonds have marginally extended session highs, with Bunds just eclipsing interim chart resistance at 158.35 by a tick and Gilts climbing to 121.21 at best (+27 ticks on the day), but a lack of follow-through buying and conviction in terms of turnover has resulted in a gradual pull-back. Another resilient showing from EU stocks after indifference across the Asia-Pac region overnight, and more stock losses in Japan, has sapped some demand for safe-haven debt, while intraday and short term longs are probably keeping positions relatively light and tight given top tier US data ahead in the form of CPI and retail sales. For the Eurozone, supply also to make room for from Germany and Portugal. Turning to US Treasuries, some consolidation off overnight highs in futures, but the curve retaining a flatter bias as the 10 year benchmark yield settles above 2.80%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GLOBAL NEWS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>South African police have raided Gupta family&#39;s home. Ajay, Atul and Tony Gupta are accused of using their friendship with Mr Zuma to control state appointments and contracts, claims they and the president have denied. (FT) There were also reports that Zuma was arrested but this was dismissed as fake news by the South African police minister Mbalula. Later it was reported that South African ANC have pushed for a motion of no confidence against Zuma for tomorrow. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> crude futures trade lower in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s build in API inventories ahead of today&rsquo;s DoE release with focus on US production figures which climbed above the 10mln bpd level last week and surpassed that of Saudi Arabia. In terms of recent energy commentary, the Saudi Oil Minister Al Falih says Saudi Arabia will invest for maximum oil output capacity and thus shows no signing of caving to the ongoing surge in US production. In metals markets, spot <strong>gold</strong> is modestly firmer, tracking fluctuations in the USD, while <strong>Copper</strong> saw its largest jump since October during Asia-Pac trade as shorts were covered ahead of the Lunar New Year and Dalian <strong>Iron</strong> <strong>Ore</strong> printed 3-week highs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (Feb 9) 3.947M vs. Exp. 2.800M (Prev. -1.05M).

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: EU bourses firmer, financials higher post-Credit Suisse earnings. Riksbank stands pat with dissent from Ohlsson",
        "content": "<p>European equities (Eurostoxx 50 +0.7%) trade higher across the board as sentiment remains supported in the wake of a firmer Wall St. close and mixed Asia-Pac session with macro newsflow otherwise relatively light for the region. In terms of sector specifics, financials are seen higher following earnings from Credit Suisse (+3.2%) who sit at the top of the SMI with gains for the sector mildly offset by Credit Agricole (-2.1%) who failed to appease investors with their latest statement. Elsewhere, energy names lag their peers alongside price action for WTI and Brent in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s API build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early focus on the Swedish Krona and a knee-jerk reaction to Riksbank Ohlsson&rsquo;s objection against holding the repo rate steady at -0.5%. Eur/Sek briefly dropped below 9.8750 as the hawkish Board member dissented in favour of a 25 basis point hike before rebounding towards pre-policy verdict session highs (around 9.9200) on the unchanged guidance for tightening in H2 this year, slightly softer inflation outlook and caveat that more easing remains an option if favourable economic conditions change. Meanwhile, the Jpy continued its sharp appreciation vs the Dollar and other major currency counterparts overnight, with Usd/Jpy taking out the 2017 low circa 107.30, and reported big barriers at 107.00 to record a fresh multi-year base around 106.85. However, spec short covering has subsequently pushed the pair back up over the 107.00 level to test offers around 107.50, and this has helped the DXY recover 89.500+ status. Eur/Usd looks flanked by bids and offers at 1.2350 and 1.2400 respectively, with hefty option expiries in the vicinity of those range extremes also likely to provide support and resistance (2.6 bn between 1.2335-50 and 2 bn from 1.2400-05). Other Usd/G10s are also relatively rangebound, but the Kiwi is outperforming after a rise in NZ inflation expectations, with Nzd/Usd back above 0.7300. In the EM region, Usd/Zar remains in the spotlight and back near recent lows around 11.8500 awaiting a response from President Zuma to the latest ANC party &lsquo;requests&rsquo; to stand down, while raids on Gupta family residences have resulted in several arrests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core bonds have marginally extended session highs, with Bunds just eclipsing interim chart resistance at 158.35 by a tick and Gilts climbing to 121.21 at best (+27 ticks on the day), but a lack of follow-through buying and conviction in terms of turnover has resulted in a gradual pull-back. Another resilient showing from EU stocks after indifference across the Asia-Pac region overnight, and more stock losses in Japan, has sapped some demand for safe-haven debt, while intraday and short term longs are probably keeping positions relatively light and tight given top tier US data ahead in the form of CPI and retail sales. For the Eurozone, supply also to make room for from Germany and Portugal. Turning to US Treasuries, some consolidation off overnight highs in futures, but the curve retaining a flatter bias as the 10 year benchmark yield settles above 2.80%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures trade lower in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s build in API inventories ahead of today&rsquo;s DoE release with focus on US production figures which climbed above the 10mln bpd level last week and surpassed that of Saudi Arabia. In terms of recent energy commentary, the Saudi Oil Minister Al Falih says Saudi Arabia will invest for maximum oil output capacity and thus shows no signing of caving to the ongoing surge in US production. In metals markets, spot gold is modestly firmer, tracking fluctuations in the USD, while Copper saw its largest jump since October during Asia-Pac trade as shorts were covered ahead of the Lunar New Year and Dalian Iron Ore printed 3-week highs. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Early focus on the Swedish Krona and a knee-jerk reaction to Riksbank Ohlsson&rsquo;s objection against holding the repo rate steady at -0.5%. Eur/Sek briefly dropped below 9.8750 as the hawkish Board member dissented in favour of a 25 basis point hike before rebounding towards pre-policy verdict session highs (around 9.9200) on the unchanged guidance for tightening in H2 this year, slightly softer inflation outlook and caveat that more easing remains an option if favourable economic conditions change. Meanwhile, the Jpy continued its sharp appreciation vs the Dollar and other major currency counterparts overnight, with Usd/Jpy taking out the 2017 low circa 107.30, and reported big barriers at 107.00 to record a fresh multi-year base around 106.85. However, spec short covering has subsequently pushed the pair back up over the 107.00 level to test offers around 107.50, and this has helped the DXY recover 89.500+ status. Eur/Usd looks flanked by bids and offers at 1.2350 and 1.2400 respectively, with hefty option expiries in the vicinity of those range extremes also likely to provide support and resistance (2.6 bn between 1.2335-50 and 2 bn from 1.2400-05). Other Usd/G10s are also relatively rangebound, but the Kiwi is outperforming after a rise in NZ inflation expectations, with Nzd/Usd back above 0.7300. In the EM region, Usd/Zar remains in the spotlight and back near recent lows around 11.8500 awaiting a response from President Zuma to the latest ANC party &lsquo;requests&rsquo; to stand down, while raids on Gupta family residences have resulted in several arrests.</p>\r\n",

In truth, the unchanged 3% y/y headline inflation rate has not materially altered near term BoE policy expectations despite several more banks joining the May tightening bandwagon, and there is valid reason for caution given the impending next stage of Brexit negotiations not to mention plenty more data points to digest and assess before the next MPC meetings. Nothing on the domestic docket today, but key UK officials kick off a round of Brexit speeches and US data will be in focus as CPI and retail sales could be pivotal for Fed rate intentions. Prior to that, the Riksbank may also provide some impetus.</p>\r\n",

The firmer early tone reflects risk-off demand for JGBs and US Treasuries overnight as Asia-Pac stocks failed to derive any support or positive momentum from Wall Street again, and the Nikkei retreated further on a combination of sub-forecast Japanese GDP data and another Jpy rally. The US curve witnessed more flattening ahead of today&rsquo;s CPI (and retail sales) releases amidst reports that Fed hawk Mester may be a contender for VC, but looming 30 year German supply could temper similar moves ahead of the auction. Note, Portugal is also issuing bonds today (2022 and 2028 maturities in Eur1.5 bn), and the 10 year benchmark has rebounded firmly above the 2% yield mark in the secondary market to provide a significant concession.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp.

NZD/USD is the outperformer and reclaimed the 0.7300 handle after an increase in New Zealand 2yr inflation expectations, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are subdued as the risk tone deteriorated in Tokyo and after Q4 GDP figures also disappointed. Elsewhere, CNH is among the few that have lost ground to the greenback after the PBoC set a weaker reference rate, while SGD is mildly underpinned by better than expected Singapore GDP numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid a risk-averse tone in Japan and alongside similar overnight gains in USTs, while focus turns to the 5yr JGB auction later.</p>\r\n",
