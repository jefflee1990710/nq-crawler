He also stated that China is doing a lot to help on North Korea but could do more. Trump declined to confirm reports that the US is debating a possible pre-emptive strike on North Korea.

The statement and subsequent press conference steered clear of any comments on the domestic currency, and reiterated the Bank&rsquo;s current data-dependent stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CAD ended virtually unchanged vs. the greenback, while the Antipodeans finished higher but off of best levels as USD demand took hold in late dealing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP continued its march higher, with cable briefly breaching 1.39 as EURGBP moved below its 200 DMA, before USD demand took hold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SEK benefitted from comments out of the Riksbank, as policy board member Ohlsson stated that the central bank is nearing the point of normalising monetary policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES: WTI Crude futures settled up USD 0.24, at USD 63.97, Brent Crude futures settled up USD 0.23, at USD 69.38</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude oil initially benefitted from a combination of the softer dollar and supply side risks as the Niger Delta avengers declared imminent attacks in Nigeria. OPEC Secretary General Barkindo stated that oil prices are to be fair and reasonable in 2018, while Kuwait suggested that OPEC/Non-OPEC with the production cut stood at circa 125%.

        "subject": "The big Canadian banks weigh in on today's Bank of Canada decision",
        "content": "<p><strong>CIBC: </strong>Today&#39;s rate hike was a rear-view mirror move, but the Bank of Canada hints that the view out the front window isn&#39;t quite as sunny. Canada did so well in 2017 that it left little slack in labour markets or capacity in its wake, easily justifying a quarter-point hike today. The output gap is now slightly positive, so quarterly growth rates from here have to average below 2% (the Bank has 1.8% for the average of the next four quarters) to avoid an inflationary overheating. We share the Bank of Canada&#39;s view that higher rates will be needed over time to stay on that path, but they won&rsquo;t come quite as fast and furious as the market was starting to think. For one, the Bank&#39;s statement put NAFTA uncertainties right up front, and has started to build in a drag on investment and exports into its forecast. While the Bank isn&rsquo;t ready to assume that NAFTA will be completely cancelled, doubts on that front can impact business sentiment, and they&rsquo;ve included a 0.5% hit to the level of GDP through the next two years to account for that effect. That creates a little less room for the additional drag of higher interest rates on the domestic economy, and a reason to avoid additional trade woes from having an excessive pace for rate hikes send the loonie still stronger. Interestingly, the Monetary Policy Report highlights a fact that the Bank chose to downplay a bit in the way it worded its Business Outlook Survey. Respondents &ldquo;are increasingly concerned&rdquo; about rising protectionism and NAFTA prospects. We can sympathize with those doubts. Our own outlook assumes that, at a minimum, the US puts Canada on notice of its intention to pull out of NAFTA in the months ahead. In a move we believe was aimed at calming market expectations for follow-up hikes a bit, the Bank also left room in its statement to explain that &quot;monetary accommodation&quot; (ie. rates at stimulative levels) will be needed to reach their growth and inflation forecasts, reasserting the need to be cautious in how fast they hike ahead, even to have growth run at roughly potential by 2019. That could be confusing for those who define neutral as the rate needed to grow at potential. But the Bank of Canada is differentiating between some higher long term neutral rate, and the rate that might be neutral in the next year or two given other headwinds, including the extra sensitivity of a household sector carrying a lot of debt. Changes in the forecast were trivial, but that&rsquo;s to be expected since the Bank of Canada is committed to finding the rate path that steers the economy right to a 2% inflation pace and output running right at potential. It&rsquo;s not whether growth will slow in the next two years, it&rsquo;s just how many rate hikes that will take. Overall, this was a dovish statement relative to the minimum degree of optimism needed to justify a rate hike today, and could put some downward pressure on 2-year yields and the value of the C$. We&rsquo;re looking for one further hike this year, likely early in Q3, and a further 50 bps in 2019. Yes, we&rsquo;re facing higher rates, but not SO fast given other risks to growth ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBC: </strong>The Bank of Canada ratified market expectations by hiking rates 25bp today, to leave the overnight target rate at 1.25% (OIS markets had priced in the move by ~85%).&nbsp; In its rate statement, the central bank maintained a similar tone seen late last year, reiterating some degree of caution in being &ldquo;guided by incoming data in assessing the economy&rsquo;s sensitivity to interest rates, the evolution of economic capacity, and the dynamics of both wage growth and inflation.&rdquo; However, whereas they stated that higher interest rates &ldquo;will likely be required over time&rdquo; in the past, they now suggest &ldquo;the economic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time&rdquo; &ndash; perhaps a little clearer indication &ndash; even if subtle &ndash; that we are now in the process of removing accommodation, though some of that accommodation &ldquo;will likely be needed to keep the economy operating close to potential and inflation on target&rdquo;. Other aspects of the rate statement and MPR forecasts/discussions were also about as expected.&nbsp; The Bank&rsquo;s GDP growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 were unchanged on balance (revised down 0.1pp in 2017 to 3.0% and up 01pp to 2.2% in 2018, with 2019 growth boosted by 0.1pp to 1.6% to match the Bank&rsquo;s revised estimate of potential growth &ndash; previously 1.5%).&nbsp; Given the blockbuster jobs reports to end 2017, it is also not surprising that &ldquo;&hellip; recent data show that labour market slack is being absorbed more quickly than anticipated&rdquo;.&nbsp; The mid-point of the Bank&rsquo;s output gap range was nudged up into an excess demand position in 2017Q4 with a range of- 0.25% to +0.75% of potential GDP and an expectation that inflation &ndash; currently close to 2 per cent &ndash; is expected to remain there over the projection horizon. Any caution from the central bank remains most closely tied to NAFTA risks, even though Canadian businesses have overcome some of their worries in terms of firm capital spending intentions.&nbsp; Within the MPR, the central bank notes that respondents to the latest Business Outlook Survey expressed trade concerns nevertheless and that &ldquo;greenfield foreign direct investment into Canada has declined since mid-2016, especially from Europe but also from the United States&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Bank estimates the net impact of trade policy uncertainty on business investment at 2% by the end of 2019. Overall, the &ldquo;cautious&rdquo; catchword from the BoC remains in place even with today&rsquo;s hike and this may be how additional moves later this year pan out (we expect three more to leave the overnight target at 2.00% by the end of 2018).&nbsp; We concur with the Bank&rsquo;s assessment that &ldquo;some accommodation will likely be needed to keep the economy operating close to potential and inflation on target&rdquo; and we believe that the Bank will need to slow the pace of rate hikes in 2019 (we currently have the overnight rate holding at 2.25%, below the 3.00% mid-point of the Bank&rsquo;s estimated neutral rate range, largely reflecting the impact of higher rates on high household debt).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scotiabank: </strong>As expected the BoC hiked its policy rate by 25bps to 1.25% and that&rsquo;s the right thing to have done in my opinion. My read of the overall bias in the full suite of communications including the statement, MPR and press conference is mildly hawkish as the BoC lowered the bar for further rate hikes on balance. OIS markets are pricing most of another hike by April/May which is in keeping with our forecast for timing the next policy move, and two more in total this year which is also in keeping with our forecast. CAD is about a half cent stronger versus the USD than it was earlier this morning after netting out position covering on moves immediately prior to the statement and after digesting all of the information provided by the BoC in its full communciations. A stronger currency in the aftermath makes sense to me. There is nothing in the broad set of communications that stands in the way of further hikes in the relatively near-term. This is a more hawkish statement than markets were anticipating over recent days and it stands to repeat that the overall communications incrementally lowered the bar for further hikes. With the following comment, the door is wide open to further rate hikes: &ldquo;While the economic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time, some continued monetary policy accommodation will likely be needed to keep the economy operating close to potential and inflation on target.&rdquo; That just says they&rsquo;re open to more hikes but not zipping toward neutral faster than we forecast. This merits elaboration. Do not misinterpret &ldquo;continued monetary policy accommodation.&rdquo; Continued monetary accommodation speaks to the spread between the pace of future hikes and a neutral policy rate estimate and should not be interpreted as a dovish signal against the &ldquo;warrant higher interest rates over time&rdquo; remark. The BoC can still keep hiking and maintain monetary policy accommodation by remaining below a neutral rate this year and that&rsquo;s all that this comment implies. The BoC upgraded its assessment of slack to note that the &ldquo;economy is operating roughly at capacity&rdquo; whereas in December it was still emphasizing the &ldquo;continued absorption of economic slack.&rdquo; This is hawkish. The BoC upgraded its perspective on labour slack and now says &ldquo;labour slack is being absorbed more quickly than anticipated.&rdquo; This is hawkish. Global forecasts were revised up and pretty significantly in several cases and this provides an incrementally more hawkish backdrop to then back into implications for the Canadian economy. The US outlook was revised up to 2.6% growth this year (2.2% previously) and by a tick to 2.3% next year. The Eurozone&rsquo;s growth outlook was revised up four tenths this year to 2.2%. Japan was also revised up and China was kept flat at 6.4% and 6.3% projected growth this year and next. Therefore the global outlook strengthened in this MPR which is a hawkish signal. The BoC upgraded its language on inflation by stating that &ldquo;looking through these temporary factors, inflation is expected to remain close to 2 percent over the projection horizon.&rdquo; It did not previously advise it was &lsquo;looking through&rsquo; as clearly as it did today and so this is incrementally hawkish. There are nevertheless four ways in which the BoC retained some caution but they are not impediments to the broader messages above that support further tightening and they are not always consistent. They are as follows. 1. On NAFTA, I found the BoC&rsquo;s communications to be marginally coherent at best. The statement appeared to upgrade NAFTA uncertainties. 2. Potential GDP growth estimates were revised up a tick to 1.6% this year and next but that simply offsets the upward revision to actual GDP growth in each year. The level of potential GDP was revised up by only 0.2% as at 2017Q3 which is fairly trivial and still leaves capacity swinging into net excess demand this year as actual growth outstrips potential growth by about six-tenths in 2018. Further, it&rsquo;s a bit questionable that the BoC revised up its potential growth estimate by a tick but didn&rsquo;t change the range accordingly which sits unchanged at 1.1&ndash;1.7% this year and 1.1&ndash;1.9% next year. The BoC&rsquo;s discussion on potential growth uncertainties and how improving capital investment and productivity trends might raise the economy&rsquo;s non-inflationary speed limit is on the minds of many, but a) they may have simply undershot potential growth estimates in the past, and b) at this point they are indicating the bias is toward less slack in terms of how it all nets out. 3. The BoC retained reference to how it will remain &lsquo;cautious&rsquo; toward future policy moves as expected and retained data dependent guidance when it said it will be &ldquo;guided by incoming data in assessing the economy&rsquo;s sensitivity to interest rates, the evolution of economic capacity, and the dynamics of both wage growth and inflation.&rdquo; 4. On wages, the BoC issued this paper that indicates an altered preference for the most relevant wage metric. The BoC used to always say wage gains for permanent employees was the preferred measure in the past, but now guides that a common trend measure is preferred. That measure&mdash;at 2.2% y/y versus the permanent employees&rsquo; measure of 2.9% y/y&mdash;is why Poloz now argues that real wage gains are small to absent thus far instead of rising. Regardless, our view is that either measure of wage growth is likely to continue rising this year given reduced labour slack, the further shaking out of the negative drag from the commodity income shock, productivity gains over time and full knock-on effects of minimum wage hikes. The wage cycle in a forward looking sense should reinforce broader inflationary pressures regardless of the measure that is used. The next BoC statement will be on March 7th and we expect no rate move at that meeting. The next BoC communications will include a speech by Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins on February 8th and a speech by Deputy Governor Schembri on February 15th.</p>\r\n",

The net/eventual Cad weakening was largely due to ongoing NAFTA caution, which is deemed to be weighing more heavily on the economic outlook and warrants caution in terms of future tightening. This, along with a softer Eur after several ECB officials expressed concern about the strength of the single currency helped the Greenback consolidate recovery gains (Eur/Usd around 1.2230 vs 1.2325 at best) and the DXY maintain 90.500+ status, albeit tentatively. Elsewhere, Eur/Sek was also pressured by Riksbank deputy governor Ohlssen declaring that the time for normalising policy is getting closer &ndash; cross down towards the bottom of an approx 9.81-87 band. Gbp, Aud and Nzd held firmer vs the Dollar, narrowly near 1.3800, 0.7970 and 0.7270 respectively, but the Jpy and Chf lost ground to stand at 110.75 and 96.1000.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, some also suggested profit taking in overbought conditions after both the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA notched historical feats at the open in which they briefly rose above the 2800 and 26000 levels respectively for the 1st time ever. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) were negative as losses in miners continued to weigh on Australia, while risk appetite in Japan remained sapped by the recent JPY strength. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.4%) pulled back from yesterday&rsquo;s record close and the Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) bucked the trend after another firm liquidity effort by the PBoC, although a slump in Shenzhen stocks provided some mainland jitters as the ChiNext board for small cap and tech firms fell to its lowest since July after blockchain-related stocks tumbled in the wake of the crypto-chaos. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued as prices failed to benefit from a broad risk-averse tone, while today&rsquo;s Rinban announcement was also uneventful in which the BoJ maintained its purchase amounts in the belly to short-end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 100bln via 7-day, CNY 90bln via 14-day and CNY 10bln via 63-day reverse repos.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>European equity markets are lower, echoing the tone seen in Asia and the US, with Informa (-8.6%) shares propping up the FTSE 100 after reports that the company is in talks to merge with UBM, whose shares are up 12.5%. Burberry (-8.1%) shares are also lower after a disappointing trading update although tech shares outperform, lifted by ASML (+4.6%) after the chipmaker reported better than expected profit.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The ECB have continued to sound the alarm over the strengthening currency with Vice-President Constancio and Austrian Central Bank Governor Nowotny both echoing comments made yesterday by France&rsquo;s Villeroy. Constancio said he is concerned about sudden movements that do not reflect fundamentals while Nowotny said the strengthening Euro is not helpful. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The comments helped EUR/USD to session lows before finding support ahead of 1.2200 before today&rsquo;s inflation data. Elsewhere, the USD has shown some signs of a recovery with USD/JPY approaching 111.00 and USD/CAD above 1.2450 ahead of the Bank of Canada decision</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bunds and Gilts have both extended gains following a few early wobbles, with the 10 year German benchmark up to 160.95 (+18 ticks) and its UK counterpart reaching 124.10 (+17 ticks) at one stage. However, Tuesday&rsquo;s Eurex and Liffe session peaks were not breached, albeit only by a couple of ticks in the case of Bunds, and a lack of follow-through buying or decent volume has subsequently prompted a slow drift back in the core bond futures. Technically, Bunds need to clear 160.95-97 before 161.00 and then the next chart resistance around 161.07, while bears/sellers will note the 50% retrace target of yesterday&rsquo;s move at 160.69, which could open up 160.53 and Tuesday&rsquo;s 160.41 low if breached on a more pronounced retreat. In yield terms, it&rsquo;s basically a 0.5-0.6% market. US Treasuries choppy and now a few ticks below par in a re-steepening move, but relatively rangebound after better price action overnight as the focus turns to IP data, Fed speakers and the latest Beige Book.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures are both marginally lower in early European trade as markets look ahead to the weekly API inventory data (delayed to today following the MLK holiday).

        "content": "<p>The ECB have continued to sound the alarm over the strengthening currency with Vice-President Constancio and Austrian Central Bank Governor Nowotny both echoing comments made yesterday by France&rsquo;s Villeroy. Constancio said he is concerned about sudden movements that do not reflect fundamentals while Nowotny said the strengthening Euro is not helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comments helped EUR/USD to session lows before finding support ahead of 1.2200 before today&rsquo;s inflation data. The flash reading of CPI is expected to be confirmed at 1.4% when it is released at 1000GMT. Elsewhere, the USD has shown some signs of a recovery with USD/JPY approaching 111.00 and USD/CAD above 1.2450 ahead of the Bank of Canada decision (<a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/18426/download\" style=\"color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline\">Preview available here</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have both extended gains following a few early wobbles, with the 10 year German benchmark up to 160.95 (+18 ticks) and its UK counterpart reaching 124.10 (+17 ticks) at one stage. However, Tuesday&rsquo;s Eurex and Liffe session peaks were not breached, albeit only by a couple of ticks in the case of Bunds, and a lack of follow-through buying or decent volume has subsequently prompted a slow drift back in the core bond futures. Technically, Bunds need to clear 160.95-97 before 161.00 and then the next chart resistance around 161.07, while bears/sellers will note the 50% retrace target of yesterday&rsquo;s move at 160.69, which could open up 160.53 and Tuesday&rsquo;s 160.41 low if breached on a more pronounced retreat. In yield terms, it&rsquo;s basically a 0.5-0.6% market. US Treasuries choppy and now a few ticks below par in a re-steepening move, but relatively rangebound after better price action overnight as the focus turns to IP data, Fed speakers and the latest Beige Book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equity markets are lower, echoing the tone seen in Asia and the US, with Informa (-8.6%) shares propping up the FTSE 100 after reports that the company is in talks to merge with UBM, whose shares are up 12.5%. Burberry (-8.1%) shares are also lower after a disappointing trading update although tech shares outperform, lifted by ASML (+4.6%) after the chipmaker reported better than expected profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures are both marginally lower in early European trade as markets look ahead to the weekly API inventory data (delayed to today following the MLK holiday). Gold and silver prices have generally tracked movements in the USD. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Eur/Usd currently in the low 1.2200 area ahead of support at the figure and just below having spiked to a new 3 year peak around 1.2325, with 1.2350 the nearest resistance before a 1.2375-80 fib level. Eur/Gbp still hovering just below 0.8900 and Eur/Jpy circa 135.50. Aud the top G10 performer having almost touched 0.8000 vs the Usd overnight and rebounding to 1.1000 vs the Kiwi on firmer than expected housing loan data and an improvement in consumer sentiment. Nzd/Usd back down near 0.7250 amidst a decline in NZ commodity prices, Usd/Jpy closer to the top of a 110.00-111.00 broad range and Usd/Chf also at the upper end of 0.9575-0.9640 parameters in wake of latest comments from SNB&rsquo;s Jordan about the Franc being highly valued. Usd/Cad circa 1.2450 and awaiting the BoC policy verdict, statement and press conference for further direction, with a 25 bp hike wide expected but not certain given ongoing NAFTA uncertainty &ndash; to recap options suggest a more than big figure move on the meeting depending on the outcome. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, some also suggested profit taking in overbought conditions after both the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA notched historical feats at the open in which they briefly rose above the 2800 and 26000 levels respectively for the 1st time ever. <strong>ASX 200 (-0.5%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.3%)</strong> were negative as losses in miners continued to weigh on Australia, while risk appetite in Japan remained sapped by the recent JPY strength.

Elsewhere, crude prices languished in the aftermath of the prior day&rsquo;s losses with Brent crude barely holding above the USD 69/bbl after various banks upgraded their oil price forecasts to below current market levels, while Russian energy minister Novak also remained cautious and stressed that the oil market is not yet balanced and stuck to Russia&rsquo;s previous forecast for 2018 at USD 50-60/bbl.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Tillerson urged Russia and China to fully implement UN Sanctions on North Korea and later added that the world will not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea.

        "content": "<p>Asia<a name=\"_Hlk503925704\">&rsquo;s major stock markets traded mostly negative following a weak performance on Wall St, where the main indices reversed from record levels on political concerns including the looming government shutdown deadline and reports that former Trump strategist Steve Bannon was subpoenaed by Special Counsel Mueller. Furthermore, some also suggested profit taking in overbought conditions after both the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA notched historical feats at the open in which they briefly rose above the 2800 and 26000 levels respectively for the 1st time ever. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) were negative as losses in miners continued to weigh on Australia, while risk appetite in Japan remained sapped by the recent JPY strength. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.4%) pulled back from yesterday&rsquo;s record close and the Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) bucked the trend after another firm liquidity effort by the PBoC, although a slump in Shenzhen stocks provided some mainland jitters as the ChiNext board for small cap and tech firms fell to its lowest since July after blockchain-related stocks tumbled in the wake of the crypto-chaos.</a> Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued as prices failed to benefit from a broad risk-averse tone, while today&rsquo;s Rinban announcement was also uneventful in which the BoJ maintained its purchase amounts in the belly to short-end.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia&rsquo;s benchmark stock markets mostly trade with a downbeat tone following a weak lead on Wall St, where the major bourses reversed from record levels on political concerns including the looming government shutdown deadline and reports that former Trump strategist Steve Bannon was subpoenaed by Special Counsel Mueller. Furthermore, some also suggested profit taking in overbought conditions after both the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA notched historical feats at the open in which they briefly rose above the 2800 and 26000 levels respectively for the 1<sup>st</sup> time ever. ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are negative with weakness in miners continuing to weigh on Australia, while risk appetite in Japan is sapped by the recent JPY strength. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.4%) conforms to the negative picture as it pulls back from yesterday&rsquo;s record close, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) bucks the trend after another firm liquidity effort by the PBoC. Finally, despite the outperformance in the Shanghai Comp, Shenzhen stocks are on the backfoot with the Shenzhen Component down 1.7% and the ChiNext board for small cap and tech firms has fallen to its lowest since July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD weakness persisted in early Asia trade which was triggered by a surge in EUR/USD as the pair tripped through stops at the 1.2300 level to print fresh 3-year highs. The greenback&rsquo;s woes were not helped by AUD/USD which tested the 0.8000 handle to the upside with mild support seen after better than expected Home Loans data, while the PBoC also set another stronger reference rate albeit to a lesser extent in comparison to what we&rsquo;ve seen during the past few days. However, some of the moves were then pared, which has helped the USD recover off lows and USD/JPY nurse recent losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10yr JGBs are quiet with prices failing to benefit from a broad risk averse tone, while today&rsquo;s Rinban announcement was also uneventful with the BoJ maintaining its purchase amounts in the belly to short-end. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
