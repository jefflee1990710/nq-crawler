        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP - 1 Aug 2018: US to escalate trade wars, Fed stands pat",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities mixed, Treasuries steepen, Crude down, Dollar flat &nbsp;<br />* REAR-VIEW: US announces higher tariffs on $200bln of Chinese goods; Fed stands pat;<br />* COMING-UP: BOE rate decision (Thurs), BCB rate decision (Weds), Banxico rate decision (Thurs), US durable goods revisions.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>There was a tone of risk off in early trade, with traders citing news suggesting that the US was now considering planning to apply 25% tariffs on $200bln of Chinese goods, rather than the 10% initially suggested. The news initially drove risk-off flows. Officials are said to be seeking ways to re-engage after talks recently stalled. China warned against the &ldquo;blackmailing&rdquo; tactics, and issued a fresh threat to retaliate, adding that Beijing uses dialogue to resolve trade issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>Another round of reports suggested that the US and Mexico are close to reaching an agreement on autos rules of origin within NAFTA talks, according to a senior Mexican official. Sources said that the US was showing more flexibility within talks. US is still pursuing a Sunset Clause, however, which would require the deal to be reviewed every five years, but Mexican officials seemed to suggest that this was possible. Once again, the report suggested that Mexico and Canada are leaning against efforts to link auto tariffs with NAFTA talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>The FOMC kept rates unchanged at between 1.75-2.00%, as expected, and made very minor tweaks to its policy statement; risks are still &ldquo;roughly balanced,&rdquo; long-term inflation expectations still &ldquo;little changed,&rdquo; policy remains &ldquo;accommodative&rdquo;, while the acceleration in growth was seen as &ldquo;strong&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Solid&rdquo; previously. There were no amendments to its forward guidance, so analysts were happy to declare that the statement is consistent with gradual hikes, and money markets continue to price the probability of two further rate hikes this year at around 70%. Some analysts were alert to the possibility that the Fed could issue a statement on its independence, which would have been seen as hawkish, but this did not materialise. There was also no major commentary on trade wars, despite concerns that agents&rsquo; expressed in the latest Beige Book. Accordingly, market reaction was muted, since there was no real new information and the outcome was generally in line with expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ADP PAYROLLS: </strong>The ADP reported that 219k jobs were added to the US economy in July, beating the consensus view seeking 185k; there was also a small upward revision to last month&rsquo;s data. As usual, analysts cautioned that the ADP data heavily uses lagged official nonfarm payrolls data, and as such, may not provide a reliable signal for Friday&rsquo;s official release. Either way, the general run of commentary was focussing on the decent payroll growth, seemingly unconcerned about the threat of a global trade war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ISM MANUFACTURING: </strong>The headline slipped to a 12-month low, missing expectations (58.1 vs consensus 59.4 vs prior 60.2). Orders fell by 3.2 points, production was off by 3.8 points, and delivery times fell by 6.1 points. Order backlogs also fell. On the bright side, the employment sub-index rose by half-a-point to 56.5, against expectations it would remain unchanged at 56.0. &ldquo;The ISM press release says that respondents are &lsquo;overwhelmingly concerned about how tariff-related activity, including reciprocal tariffs, will continue to affect their business&rsquo;,&rdquo; Pantheon Macroeconomics notes. &ldquo;The ISM index remains at a high level, consistent with decent growth and strong payrolls, but that will change if the relatively small tariffs imposed so far are followed by the $200B-worth of new levies now under consideration by the administration,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;dumb policy hurts.&rdquo; Pantheon also notes that the prices paid index dipped to a six-month low, due to the decline in oil prices, and Pantheon said &ldquo;this will not change the upward trajectory of core PPI inflation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: </strong>The headline was a big miss, falling 1.1% MM against an expected rise of 0.3%; the prior saw a healthy upward revision, however, with the net two-month revision +1.7%. Analysts noted that today&rsquo;s data was slightly under the BEA&rsquo;s assumption in the latest GDP report, and UBS says this might subtract 5bps off the 4.1% GDP growth reported in Q2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The EU is willing to accept to &ldquo;fudge&rdquo; crucial Brexit negotiations if it helps avoid a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit scenario. A fudge would make the declaration an aspirational statement designed to placate Westminster&rsquo;s warring factions, rather than a blueprint for future trade talks, the FT reported. Separately, In Germany, sources denied reports that Germany is willing to offer the UK a vague Brexit deal so as to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU, the Guardian reported. Business Insider reported that a UK Home Office leak reveals officials in the government have discussed retaining free movement for EU citizens in the event of a no-deal. Meanwhile, EU&rsquo;s Barnier said he was optimistic that Brexit talks would reach a satisfactory result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) are now just shy of a 1trln market cap after its EPS and revenues beat and its iPhone ASP came in higher than expected as did its service revenue, however the tech mammoth&rsquo;s unit sales of iPhones, iPads, and Mac&rsquo;s came in beneath expectations. Apple stock saw intraday highs above 5%. Baidu (BIDU) reported an EPS which beat analyst expectations, however revenues fell $100mln short and provided Q3 revenue forecasts lower than analyst expectations. Baidu (BIDU) were lower after poor revenues but were hit with a double wammy as Alphabet (GOOGL) is reportedly planning a censored search engine for China, according to reports in The Intercept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Carl Icahn discloses a sizable stake in Cigna Corp (CI), and is likely to urge investors to reject takeover offer from Express Scripts (ESRX). California insurance commissioner requests DOJ block the merger CVS (CVS) and Aetna (AET). Synaptics (SYNA) announced they have put an end to the potential deal talks with Dialog Semiconductors (DLG GY), Tesla (TSLA) is said to plan a USD 5bln investment into China, and it is also moving some workers to Fremont to increase its battery and car production. The US treasury department was said to not have taken direct aim at Amazon (AMZN), and instead it suggested Amazon was not doing anything different than other companies who use the US Postal Service, according to Politico. PG&amp;E (PCG) were hit after those familiar with the matter stated the company hired a law firm to explore debt restructuring options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U8) SETTLES $1.10 LOWER AT $67.66; Brent (V8) settles $1.82 lower at $72.39. </strong>Crude was sold on Wednesday on a combination of surprise inventory builds, as well as fears that the US was considering ramping up trade wars against China. The DOE reported crude stocks built in the week by a surprise 3.8mln (expected draw of 2.79mln); Cushing printed a deeper than expected decline (-1.338mln vs exp. -1.127mln), gasoline drew by 2.536mln (deeper draw than the -1.288mln expected), and distillates built by more than expected at 2.983mln versus expected +264k. The report echoed what the API reported on Tuesday. Citi said &ldquo; confirmation from this morning&rsquo;s more definitive DOE report cannot be taken for granted, but would tend to keep the downside open, at least for the near-term, in our view.&rdquo; Eslewhere, Russia&rsquo;s July oil output was 40.54k BPD below October 2016 level (11.22mln BPD vs 11.06mln BPD in June), Russian energy minister Novak said, adding again that the recent output hike was aimed at stabilising the oil market. In Iraq, southern exports were up to 3.543mln BPD from June&rsquo;s 3.521mln. In commentary, Kuwait&rsquo;s oil minister said the global oil market is now approaching stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE 8 TICKS LOWER AT 119-05+: </strong>Yields were higher and the Treasury curve bear-steepened on Wednesday, amid decent ADP data that hints at a solid NFP report on Friday, as well as increased issuance due out of the US Treasury over the coming quarter (see below), while the FOMC&rsquo;s latest statement still alludes to a course of gradual hikes that will see the fed funds rate target lifted on another two occasion in 2018. 10-year yields once again returned to above 3.00% (just) rising around 4bps in the session, while longer-dated yields were up by around 5bps at settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US TREASURY QUARTERLY REFUNDING: </strong>The Treasury announce it will lift issuance of 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year notes, and signalled net bill issuance will be ramped-up over the next quarter (2s, 3s and 5s auction sizes will be raises by $1bln per month). The increased issuance was more than analysts at Goldman Sachs had expected, and the bank says that the increases look sufficient to cover most of the financing needs of the US (that Goldman has projected), and says it suggests that the pace of issuance increases at the next announcement could slow. The Treasury also announced it would launch the much-awaited 2-month bill in October; the Treasury did not adjust any new TIPS plans in its announcement, and indicated an announcement could be made at the November refunding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The DXY is taking greater influence from the movements of China&rsquo;s yuan, analysts are increasingly pointing out, and today was no different. However, as the session progressed, the DXY found a modest bid, and heads into the APAC session up slightly. In terms of fractals, analysts at Informa have noted that August can be quiet for the buck, but can also see sharp moves, the USD tends to perform well and the commodity bloc tends to suffer most, particularly the NOK and NZD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The yen has strengthened slightly in US trade, likely helped along by more reports that the US will raise the tariffs it intends to apply on $200bln of Chinese goods, from 10% to 25%. 111.40-50 has been touted as support, and the yen is sticking above those levels heading into Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling is flat, heading into Thursday BOE rate decision, where it is expected to lift rates by 25bps. Accordingly, cable holds above 1.31. There has been a number of Brexit stories on Wednesday, but the pound is paying little attention, with the trading range under 50 pips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRY: </strong>The Lira is printed fresh record lows against the USD (USDTRY just beneath 5.00) on news that the US said to have prepared Turkish sanctions, threatening economic penalties after the imprisonment of Pastor Brunson. Washington has reportedly prepared a list of Turkish entities and individuals that it will target should it decide to impost sanctions, sources reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP - BOE: </strong>Policy decision, minutes and quarterly inflation report due to be released at 12:00BST (07:00ET), Press Conference with Governor Carney at 12:30BST (07:30ET). The Bank of England is expected to lift its base rate by 25bps from 0.50% to 0.75%; vote split expected to be 7-2. Recent UK data points and MPC rhetoric has led to markets pricing in a 80-90% chance of a hike. Little in the way of material changes are expected for inflation and growth forecasts, with the economy having developed largely in-fitting with the MPC&rsquo;s expectations. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19745/download\">Click here to read the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP - BCB: </strong>Brazil&#39;s Selic rate is expected to be kept at 6.50% on 1 August. Analysts note that recent inflation expectations remain well anchored, and the price impact from the trucker&#39;s strike seem to be fading. &quot;The board will likely reinforce the message that it continues to closely monitor the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations,&quot; Barclays writes.</p>\r\n",

The DOE reported crude stocks built in the week by a surprise 3.8mln (expected draw of 2.79mln); Cushing printed a deeper than expected decline (-1.338mln vs exp. -1.127mln), gasoline drew by 2.536mln (deeper draw than the -1.288mln expected), and distillates built by more than expected at 2.983mln versus expected +264k. The report echoed what the API reported on Tuesday. Citi said &ldquo; confirmation from this morning&rsquo;s more definitive DOE report cannot be taken for granted, but would tend to keep the downside open, at least for the near-term, in our view.&rdquo; Eslewhere, Russia&rsquo;s July oil output was 40.54k BPD below October 2016 level (11.22mln BPD vs 11.06mln BPD in June), Russian energy minister Novak said, adding again that the recent output hike was aimed at stabilising the oil market. In Iraq, southern exports were up to 3.543mln BPD from June&rsquo;s 3.521mln. In commentary, Kuwait&rsquo;s oil minister said the global oil market is now approaching stability.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trade in the currency markets has turned increasingly choppy, but more rangebound as the clock ticks down to the Fed with little reaction or support for the broad Dollar from an upbeat ADP survey ahead of Friday&rsquo;s NFP report or higher US Treasury yields on the back of that and Quarterly Refunding details revealing a net $30 bn increase in Q3 issuance. In fact, the index dipped to a fresh session low just under 94.500 before regrouping and hardly reacting to manufacturing PMI and ISM surveys or construction spending. To recap, no policy action or changes to forward guidance are anticipated from the FOMC &ndash; see our full preview on the Research Suite or via the headline feed nearer the announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On track to end Wednesday joint bottom of the G10 league table, with rising US-China trade tensions triggering more weakness in the Cny and Cnh (partly by design given another rise in the official mid-point onshore fixing), while the Kiwi was also undermined by a weak NZ jobless rate and paltry average earnings. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd just about on 0.7400 and 0.6800 handles respectively, while the Franc slipped in Swiss National Holiday-thinned volumes within 0.9900-35 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed Eurozone manufacturing PMIs were largely shrugged off by the single currency that seemed more pre-occupied with option-related flows given a conflagration of expiries running off from 1.1670 to 1.1685 in 2.5 bn). The Pound was equally oblivious to a slight UK PMI miss, as the headline remained comfortably above 50 and is highly unlikely to prevent the BoE from delivering a widely expected 25 bp hike tomorrow. Indeed, Cable meandered between circa 1.3100 or only a fraction under and 1.3145, while Eur/Gbp straddled 0.8900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both bouncing through big figure levels vs the Greenback, but mainly due to the Dollar losing some momentum into the Fed, with the Loonie testing 1.3000 resistance again and Jpy back over 112.00 where large option expiries await on Thursday and Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decent recoveries from lows vs the Usd for many EMs, like the Zar after the ANC&rsquo;s constitutional amendment to allow land to be reclaimed by the state for nothing, while the Mxn maintained its NAFTA-related impetus amidst reports that a deal on autos with the US is all but done and a full agreement could be in the offing within days. However, the Try&rsquo;s torment continued due to all the ongoing and well documented negative factors.</p>\r\n",

However, Asia-Pac bourses were far from solid ground and US equity futures also pared some of their gains after reports that the Trump administration is planning to propose an increase to 25% tariffs from 10% on USD 200bln of Chinese goods and as Caixin Manufacturing PMI added to the recent China PMI misses. As such, ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) were mixed throughout most the session with Australia dampened by weakness in financials and energy, while Tokyo trade was driven by a weaker currency and earnings deluge. Elsewhere, Apple suppliers were varied despite the tech giant&rsquo;s earnings beat as they also digested softer than expected product sales, and Chinese markets (Hang Seng -0.9%; Shanghai Comp. -1.8%) opened positive but then gains later proved to be flimsy on the conflicting trade reports and disappointing data. Finally, 10yr JGBs fell around 80 ticks to break below 150.00 as the BoJ&rsquo;s more flexible approach on yields continued to reverberate in the bond market, with the 10yr yield back above 0.1% and the 5yr yield at a 6-month high. Of note, it was reported that Japan Securities Clearing Corporation stated that emergency margin calls related to JGB futures were triggered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump administration plans to propose a higher tariff of 25% (Prev. 10%) on USD 200bln of imports from China with an announcement possible as soon as today, according to sources.

(FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equites are marginally lower as focus once again remains on earnings. The FTSE 100 is currently underperforming (-1.1%) on the back of softer mining names (i.e. Rio Tinto missing on expectations), as well as the retail sector sliding after Next posted uninspiring earnings. The CAC (flat) is currently outperforming off the back of ArcelorMittal posting strong earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IT sector is currently in the green and following in step with the positivity seen after Apple&rsquo;s earnings last night, with the FAANG stock beating on both the top and bottom line; up 3.5% pre-market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dialog Semiconductor is leading the gains in the Stoxx 600 after strong financial results, and Volkswagen also reported positive earnings, beating on both revenue and profit expectations, but are struggling to hold on the early gains, currently down 1.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple Inc (AAPL) Q3 EPS USD 2.34 vs. Exp.

However, core bonds have regained a degree of composure, or at least stabilised off worst levels with Gilts just above their life low (circa 30 ticks adrift) and Bunds holding in above 161.00 having slipped to a deeper Eurex intraday base at 161.13 (-45 ticks on the day). Technically, both EU benchmarks have already breached some chart supports, but the 10 year UK debt future has another strong chart prop at 122.28, while its German counterpart may find a bit of traction around of the big figure at 161.11 following a mixed 2028 auction. Elsewhere, US Treasuries sitting near overnight lows and on a defensive footing ahead of data and the FOMC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index and Greenback overall has rebounded further from Tuesday&rsquo;s lows, the former back above 94.500 within a range up to 94.700 at best and the Buck up vs all G10 peers, plus many EMs again following yet another higher Usd/Cny setting by the PBoC (ongoing reaction to or precaution against US-China trade war risk). Ahead, several potentially key US data points ahead of the FOMC and NFP on Friday, but no real expectations of any major policy guidance changes from the Fed &ndash; see the Ransquawk Research Suite for a full preview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is underperforming again and only just keeping tabs with big figure levels vs its US and antipodean rivals at 0.6800 and 1.0900 respectively in wake of disappointing NZ data overnight (unemployment rate weaker than forecast and bigger miss on wages). However, the Aud is also on the backfoot amidst heightened US tariff threats vs China and the aforementioned Yuan depreciation, with Aud/Usd retreating towards 0.7400 after yesterday&rsquo;s post-Aussie building approvals boost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - Not much reaction from either to manufacturing PMIs, with the single currency trading in a tight range below 1.1700 and in the midst of mega option expiry interest (2.5 bn between 1.1670-85), while Cable is holding just above 1.3100 and eyeing BoE super Thursday with high expectations for a 25 bp rate hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Extending post-BoJ losses vs the Usd to 112.00+, but not quite testing Fib support around 112.18 and wary of huge option expiry hedging for tomorrow and Friday at the big figure strike (3.6 bn in total).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie has retreated from sub-1.3000 highs vs its US counterpart on the back of upbeat Canadian data, with weak oil prices and ongoing NAFTA neglect niggling ahead of the manufacturing PMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCANDI - Mixed Swedish and Norwegian manufacturing PMIs sparked some diverse moves in Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok, but only knee-jerk given well known erratic readings due to seasonal factors (for the record the latter slumped below 50).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Rand is recovering after a slide beyond 13.3750 vs the Usd in wake of ANC action to alter SA&rsquo;s constitution on land appropriation excluding financial compensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices are slipping with WTI and Brent both down ~1.0% in early European trade, and hovering around their 100DMA&rsquo;s of USD 67.84 and USD 74.14 respectively.

The FTSE 100 is currently underperforming (-1.0%) on the back of softer mining names (i.e. Rio Tinto missing on expectations), as well as the retail sector sliding as a whole, with Next leading the losses after uninspiring earnings. The CAC is currently outperforming off of the back of ArcelorMittal posting strong earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IT sector is currently in the green and following in step with the positivity seen after Apple&rsquo;s earnings yesterday night, with the FAANG stock beating on both the top and bottom line, and rising as high as 3% at one point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dialog Semiconductor is leading the gains in the Stoxx 600 after strong financial results, and Volkswagen also reported positive earnings, beating on both revenue and profit expectations, but are struggling to hold on the early gains, currently down 1.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - &nbsp;The index and Greenback overall has rebounded further from Tuesday&rsquo;s lows, the former back above 94.500 within a range up to 94.700 at best and the Buck up vs all G10 peers, plus many EMs again following yet another higher Usd/Cny setting by the PBoC (ongoing reaction to or precaution against US-China trade war risk). Ahead, several potentially key US data points ahead of the FOMC and NFP on Friday, but no real expectations of any major policy guidance changes from the Fed &ndash; see the Ransquawk Research Suite for a full preview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is underperforming again and only just keeping tabs with big figure levels vs its US and antipodean rivals at 0.6800 and 1.0900 respectively in wake of disappointing NZ data overnight (unemployment rate weaker than forecast and bigger miss on wages). However, the Aud is also on the backfoot amidst heightened US tariff threats vs China and the aforementioned Yuan depreciation, with Aud/Usd retreating towards 0.7400 after yesterday&rsquo;s post-Aussie building approvals boost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - Not much reaction from either to manufacturing PMIs, with the single currency trading in a tight range below 1.1700 and in the midst of mega option expiry interest (2.5 bn between 1.1670-85), while Cable is holding just above 1.3100 and eyeing BoE super Thursday with high expectations for a 25 bp rate hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Extending post-BoJ losses vs the Usd to 112.00+, but not quite testing Fib support around 112.18 and wary of huge option expiry hedging for tomorrow and Friday at the big figure strike (3.6 bn in total).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie has retreated from sub-1.3000 highs vs its US counterpart on the back of upbeat Canadian data, with weak oil prices and ongoing NAFTA neglect niggling ahead of the manufacturing PMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCANDI - Mixed Swedish and Norwegian manufacturing PMIs sparked some diverse moves in Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok, but only knee-jerk given well known erratic readings due to seasonal factors (for the record the latter slumped below 50).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Rand is recovering after a slide beyond 13.3750 vs the Usd in wake of ANC action to alter SA&rsquo;s constitution on land appropriation excluding financial compensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hardly any reaction to the marginal UK manufacturing PMI miss or final pan Eurozone print that somehow managed to match the flash reading even though national readings were weak on balance. However, core bonds have regained a degree of composure, or at least stabilised off worst levels with Gilts just above their life low (circa 30 ticks adrift) and Bunds holding in above 161.00 having slipped to a deeper Eurex intraday base at 161.13 (-45 ticks on the day). Technically, both EU benchmarks have already breached some chart supports, but the 10 year UK debt future has another strong chart prop at 122.28, while its German counterpart may find a bit of traction around of the big figure at 161.11 following a mixed 2028 auction. Elsewhere, US Treasuries sitting near overnight lows and on a defensive footing ahead of data and the FOMC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices are slipping with WTI and Brent both down ~1.0% in early European trade, and hovering around their 100DMA&rsquo;s of USD 67.84 and USD 74.14 respectively. This comes after Brent declined more than&nbsp; 6% in July and WTI fell around 7% in the same period, with both benchmarks having the largest decline in over 2 years. Yesterday also saw API inventories showing a surprise build of 5.6mln BBL&rsquo;s, vs. and expected draw of 2.8mln BBL&rsquo;s. Oil traders are now looking ahead to EIA data later in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is holding steady ahead of the FOMC rate decision later on in the day.

Gilts started at 122.56 vs Tuesday&rsquo;s 122.68 close and instantly hit offers to trade down at 122.33 (-35 ticks) as their core Eurozone equivalent succumbs to more downside pressure and posts a fresh 161.21 Eurex low (-47 ticks). Similarly, the 3 month strip is on the back foot again between 1-2 ticks below parity, and aside from pre-BoE caution STIR contracts are conforming to the overall resumption of the bear trend. Ahead, July&rsquo;s manufacturing PMI.</p>\r\n",

However, Asia-Pac bourses were far from solid ground and US equity futures also pared some of their gains after reports that the Trump administration is planning to propose an increase to 25% tariffs from 10% on USD 200bln of Chinese goods and as Caixin Manufacturing PMI added to the recent China PMI misses. As such, ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) were mixed throughout most the session with Australia dampened by weakness in financials and energy, while Tokyo trade was driven by a weaker currency and earnings deluge. Elsewhere, Apple suppliers were varied despite the tech giant&rsquo;s earnings beat as they also digested softer than expected product sales, and Chinese markets (Hang Seng -0.1%; Shanghai Comp. -0.3%) opened positive but then gains later proved to be flimsy on the conflicting trade reports and disappointing data. Finally, 10yr JGBs fell around 80 ticks to break below 150.00 as the BoJ&rsquo;s more flexible approach on yields continued to reverberate in the bond market, with the 10yr yield back above 0.1% and the 5yr yield at a 6-month high.

However, Asia-Pac bourses were far from solid ground and US equity futures also pared some of their gains after reports that the Trump administration is planning to propose an increase to 25% tariffs from 10% on USD 200bln of Chinese goods and as Caixin Manufacturing PMI added to the recent China PMI misses. As such, ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) were mixed throughout most the session with Australia dampened by weakness in financials and energy, while Tokyo trade was driven by a weaker currency and earnings deluge. Elsewhere, Apple suppliers were varied despite the tech giant&rsquo;s earnings beat as they also digested softer than expected product sales, and Chinese markets (Hang Seng -0.1%; Shanghai Comp. -0.3%) opened positive but then gains later proved to be flimsy on the conflicting trade reports and disappointing data. Finally, 10yr JGBs fell around 80 ticks to break below 150.00 as the BoJ&rsquo;s more flexible approach on yields continued to reverberate in the bond market, with the 10yr yield back above 0.1% and the 5yr yield at a 6-month high. Of note, it was reported that Japan Securities Clearing Corporation stated that emergency margin calls related to JGB futures were triggered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump administration plans to propose a higher tariff of 25% (Prev. 10%) on USD 200bln of imports from China with an announcement possible as soon as today, according to sources.

(Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EU is willing to &ldquo;fudge&rdquo; important Brexit negotiations and offer Britain a vague blueprint for future ties with the bloc if it helps UK PM May avoid a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; outcome and win parliamentary backing for a withdrawal treaty.

(Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback remained firm with the DXY near the prior day&rsquo;s highs around 94.50 as its major counterparts languished with EUR/USD below the 1.1700 handle and GBP/USD eyeing 1.3100 to the downside. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses held on to the majority of the gains in the aftermath of the BoJ&rsquo;s less hawkish than feared policy tweak, while antipodeans slightly pulled back amid the weakest CNY fix since May last year and declines in crude, as well as a surprise increase in New Zealand&rsquo;s Unemployment Rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand Unemployment Rate (Q2) 4.5% vs. Exp. 4.4% (Prev. 4.4%). (Newswires)<br />New Zealand HLFS Participation Rate (Q2) 70.9% vs. Exp. 70.8% (Prev. 70.8%)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were softer overnight in which WTI crude futures extended on the prior session&rsquo;s losses and briefly tested a breakdown of the USD 68.00/bbl level following a surprise build in API crude inventories. Elsewhere, gold was kept subdued as the greenback remained firm and copper also conformed to the lacklustre tone across the complex amid disappointing Chinese PMI data and talk of proposals for increased tariffs on China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (27/Jul) 5.59mln (Exp. -2.8mln, Prev. -3.160mln).

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the BOJ took a dovish approach, the US Treasury curve resumed its flattening, albeit modest, with 2s10s coming in by around 2bps ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s Fed meeting (no fireworks expected), and 5s30s flattened by the same amount. Ultimately, however, Treasuries have continued in their summer lull, and after the BOJ dust settled, were rangebound. There was some upside to yields on reports that China and the US were seeking to resume trade talks. US 10YR T-notes settled 1+ ticks higher at 119-13+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump reiterated threat to shutdown government if a deal is not made on the border wall and immigration. There were also comments from US Senate Leader McConnell that the Senate is trying to pass the spending bills and to avoid an &#39;event&#39;, while he added that he supports what Trump wants to do regarding the wall but wants it to be provided through use of normal appropriations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US and Mexico said to be nearing auto deal, while it was also reported that Mexico President-elect AMLO believes an agreement on NAFTA renegotiation can be reached within the coming days. In related news, Mexico&rsquo;s Deputy Economy Minister had earlier commented they will continue preparing all possible responses to potential US car tariffs despite the agreement between US President Trump and EU&#39;s Juncker.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity market are mostly higher as region gets a tailwind from US where all majors finished positive on trade optimism from initial reports that US and China are to seek a restart of talks, while earnings also remained in the spotlight with Apple beating on top and bottom lines. However, Asia-Pac bourses are far from solid ground and US equity futures have also pared some of their gains after reports that the Trump administration is planning to propose an increase to 25% tariffs from 10% on USD 200bln of Chinese goods and with Caixin Manufacturing PMI adding to the recent China PMI data misses. As such, ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) are mixed with Australia dampened by weakness in financials and energy, while Tokyo trade has been driven by a weaker currency and earnings deluge. Elsewhere, Apple suppliers are mixed despite the tech giant&rsquo;s earnings beat as they also digest softer than expected product sales, and Chinese markets (Hang Seng +0.1%; Shanghai Comp. +0.2%) are positive but with gains flimsy on conflicting trade reports and disappointing data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback remains firm with the DXY near the prior day&rsquo;s highs around 94.50 as its major counterparts languish with EUR/USD below the 1.1700 handle and GBP/USD eyeing 1.3100 to the downside. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses have held on to the majority of the gains in the aftermath of the BoJ&rsquo;s less hawkish than feared policy tweak, while antipodeans slightly pulled back amid weakness in crude and an unexpected increase in New Zealand&rsquo;s Unemployment Rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower and have shed around half a point as the BoJ&rsquo;s policy tweak and more flexible approach on yields continues to reverberate in the bond market, with the 10yr yield back above 0.1% and the 5yr yield at a 6-month high.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>RBI are to announce its latest policy decision on Wednesday in which they are expected to hike the Repurchase Rate and Reverse Repo Rate by 25bps each to 6.50% and 6.25% respectively, while the Cash Reserve Ratio is likely to be kept at 4.00% where it has been for over 5 years. However, forecasts are not so clear cut with a survey showing that 39 out of 52 economists were calling for a hike,&nbsp;while another poll had 60% calling for a hike and separate&nbsp;press&nbsp;survey had even&nbsp;suggested the&nbsp;majority of economists anticipate&nbsp;no change in rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, the general consensus for the RBI to raise rates again following the surprise 25bps hike at the prior meeting have been attributed to the likelihood of further efforts to curb inflation after the latest CPI release rose to 5.0% vs. Prev. 4.9% and following a surge in Wholesale Prices to 5.8% vs. Prev. 4.4%, while higher energy prices would also continue to add to the inflation concerns. In addition, the central bank is also seen to want to stabilize a depreciating currency after INR continued to weaken to fresh record lows against the greenback which had prompted intervention on several occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, there are also arguments for the central bank to keep policy on hold as the central bank may want to first observe the full impact of its prior rate adjustment, while weaker than expected Industrial Production of 3.2% vs. Exp. 4.5% (Prev. 4.9%) and ongoing global trade uncertainty are other factors restricting scope for higher rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate announcement is due at 1000BST in which participants will also be eyeing what stance the RBI takes and the voting composition considering the MPC last time defied expectations in unanimous vote (6-0) to hike rates and maintained a neutral policy stance vs. forecasts for maintaining rates and a shift in policy stance to signal potential interest rate hikes ahead. The market reaction to INR can also be as unpredictable as the central bank&rsquo;s policy decisions with a hike in rates to support the currency likely to have the intended impact, although it is also worth noting that looser policy can also unconventionally underpin the currency which is due to expectations of money inflows amid more favourable conditions.</p>\r\n",
