(WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC is to cut the re-lending rate for SME loans by 50bps. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May told EU&rsquo;s Tusk that the UK will provide more detail on their vision for the future EU relationship in a white paper after the June council, according to a statement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Vasiliauskas stated the ECB could start to discuss lifting short-term interest rates from autumn 2019. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Coeure said ECB expects policy rates to remain unchanged until at least through the summer of 2019. (Newswires)<br /><br />S&amp;P raised Greece rating to B+; Outlook Stable from B; Outlook Positive. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An adviser to Mexico presidential front runner Lopez Obrador said they will do all they can to strengthen the MXN and that the currency is currently undervalued, while the adviser added the government would look to do this by creating investor confidence conditions and not through market intervention. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Energy Secretary Perry said the US will do everything it can to keep gasoline prices reasonable, while he added that OPEC and Non-OPEC deal to boost output &quot;may be a little short of what is needed&quot;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the reports on investment restrictions in Bloomberg &amp; WSJ are false and that statement will be out will not be specific to China but to all countries that are trying to steal US technology. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Trade Advisor Navarro said the US has no plans to impose investment restrictions but will defend itself against threats to its technology, while Navarro also noted today&#39;s equity slide is an overreaction. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures traded lower today following negative sentiment provided by US President Trump who threatened a &lsquo;more than reciprocity&rsquo; response to countries with tariffs and trade barriers against the US, while reports that the Trump Administration was mulling fresh curbs on companies with at least 25% Chinese ownership from purchasing US companies that possess &ldquo;industrially significant technology&rdquo; also weighed on sentiment from the open, which was then exacerbated after US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stated the reports were false and that &ldquo;statement will be out not specific to China, but to all countries that are trying to steal our technology,&rdquo; raising fears of widespread action. This led to the Emini trading below the 50dma for the first time since 9th of May before sliding through the 100dma at 2709 to 2700.50. Later, comments from White House Trade Advisor Navarro helped to pared some of the losses. In terms of sectors, tech bore the brunt of the selling action, after the Trump measures were said to largely take aim at chipmakers while Energy was hit as it tracked crude lower post-OPEC+ meeting. Utilities outperformed given their defensive nature, with the UTY ETF rising to flirt with its 200dma (hasn&rsquo;t crossed that mark since December). SPX -1.4%, NDX 100 -2.2%, DJIA -1.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While stocks (and havens) were clearly shaken by the ramping up of global trade war tensions, the Treasury complex was more sanguine ahead of this week&rsquo;s supply, with yields falling modestly across the curve, and major curve spreads were little changed (still, there was attention on 2s5s and 2s10s which ticked slightly lower to the flattest in over a decade). Some of the Treasury bid deflated, however, after conciliatory comments by White House Trade Advisor Navarro. US 10YR T-notes futures (Sep 2018) 6+ ticks higher at 120-01.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities down, Treasuries up, DXY down, Crude down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Trump administration mulls fresh trade measures; China to strike back.<br />* AHEAD: API inventories; US consumer confidence; Fed speak (Kaplan, Bostic); ECB speak (Coeure, de Guindos); BOE speak (McCafferty, Haskel).</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Weekend news that the Trump Administration was mulling fresh curbs on companies with at least 25% Chinese ownership from purchasing US companies that possess &ldquo;industrially significant technology&rdquo; weighed on sentiment (Specifically, it seems as though the US is set to target Chinese entities that are significant for the &ldquo;Made in 2025&rdquo; initiative). US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin weighed in, stating that the reports were false, adding that &ldquo;statement will be out not specific to China, but to all countries that are trying to steal our technology,&rdquo; raising fears of widespread action, not just aimed at China. Elsewhere, US energy secretary Perry said that the US must ensure that the domestic steel industry is not hit by global trade disputes. Later, China President Xi told CEO&rsquo;s he is to strike back at the US, the WSJ reported, and said there will be &lsquo;no more turning the cheek&rsquo; which means that US firms might face regulatory delays, or consumer backlash. However, later in the session, White House Trade Advisor Navarro said US has no plans to impose investment restrictions, but US will defend itself against threats to its technology; Navarro also notes today&#39;s equity slide is an overreaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CENTRAL BANK SPEAKERS: </strong>ECB&#39;s Vasiliauskas stated that the ECB could start to discuss lifting short-term interest rates from Autumn 2019; ECB&#39;s Praet said prolonging the purchase of assets for 2019 is an option. BoJ&#39;s Sakurai says inflation is still very low despite full employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -1.4%, NDX 100 -2.2%, DJI &nbsp;-1.3%. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -2.2%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.5%, Energy: -2.2%, Financials: -1.0%, Health Care:&nbsp; &nbsp;-0.9%, Industrials: -1.2%, Materials: -1.5%, Telecoms: -0.1%, Tech: -2.3%, Utilities: +1.7%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>US equity futures traded lower today following negative sentiment provided by US President Trump who threatened a &lsquo;more than reciprocity&rsquo; response to countries with tariffs and trade barriers against the US. This with the aforementioned trade story led to the Emini trading below the 50dma for the first time since 9th of May. In afternoon trade, the ES attempted a test of the 50dma, which coincided with the weighted average moving price, though ultimately failed, seeing ES slide through the 100dma at 2709 to 2700.50. Later, comments from White House Trade Advisor Navarro helped to pared some of the losses, helping ES move back above 2720.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Unsurprisingly, tech bore the brunt of the selling action, after the Trump measures were aid to largely take aim at chipmakers; and Energy was hit post-OPEC+ meeting, tracking crude lower. Utilities outperformed given their defensive nature, with the UTY ETF rising to flirt with its 200dma (hasn&rsquo;t crossed that mark since December).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Carnival (CCL) beat on both the top and bottom line, however it released Q3 guidance below analyst expectations. This saw the stock underperform In the SPX where it saw intraday losses of ~10%, and also hampered other cruise names, NCLH &amp; RCL. On tomorrow&rsquo;s earning docket we are expecting numbers from Lennar (LEN) &amp; IHS Markit (INFO).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>Campbell Soup (CPB) outperformed the SPX index today following source reports that Kraft Heinz (KHC) and General Mills (GIS) may be considering a bid for the name. This was followed by further source reports which stated CPB have not yet hired bankers for any deal. In smaller equity stories, Education Realty Trust (EDR) is to be acquired by Greystar-led fund for USD 41.50/share in a USD 4.6 Billion Transaction. Also, Blackstone (BX) is to acquire EDR&rsquo;s student housing portfolio for USD 1.2bln. Finally, Gray Television (GTN) is to acquire Raycom Media for USD 3.65bln to create the single largest owner of top-rated local television stations and digital assets in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>The European Union raised tariffs on imports of Harley Davidson (HOG) motorcycles from 6% to 31% in response to US tariffs on EU steel and aluminium. The motorcycle manufacturer said the move would have an immediate and lasting detrimental impact to its business in the region, and it will shift some production outside of the US due to the tariffs. Other stock specifics focused on broker moves; Microsoft (MSFT) was upgraded at Atlantic, and Kroger (KR) was downgraded at Pivotal Research.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) 6+&nbsp;TICKS HIGHER AT 120-01.</strong> While stocks (and havens) were clearly shaken by the ramping up of global trade war tensions, the Treasury complex was more sanguine ahead of this week&rsquo;s supply, with yields falling modestly across the curve, and major curve spreads were little changed (still, there was attention on 2s5s and 2s10s which ticked slightly lower to the flattest in over a decade). Some of the Treasury bid deflated, however, after conciliatory comments by White House Trade advisor Navarro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* THIS WEEK&rsquo;S TREASURY SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury will this week auction USD 116bln in supply this week (USD 34bln of new 2s on Tuesday, USD 36bln of new 5s on Wednesday, USD 30bln in new 7s on Thursday, as well as USD 16bln of 2-year FRN on Tuesday). TD Securities notes that with USD 64.3bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is implied at USD 51.7bln. The bank also expected the Treasury to announce a further increase in auction sizes in the coming months, continuing to cheapen front-end Treasuries vs OIS. The 2s auction may be supported by the relative stability in Fed hike expectations, along with renewed fears about global trade wars. Recent auctions in the 2-year sector have been well received, with last month&rsquo;s sale seeing the largest stop-through since July 2017, and means that over the last six auctions, the stop-out rate has come in on the screws. However, although direct bidders&rsquo; participation has been fairly stable, dealer takedown has been nudging up, while indirect participation has been edging down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q8) SETTLE 50c LOWER&nbsp; AT $68.08/BBL; BRENT (Q8) FUTURES SETTLE 82c LOWER AT $74.73/BBL. </strong>Markets continue to digest the outcomes of the OPEC/OPEC+ &lsquo;deal&rsquo;, with continued confusion on exactly how much supply will be released. The market has chosen to take the spirit of the forward guidance as a whole &ndash; Saudi&rsquo;s will do whatever is necessary to ensure the market remains balanced, and its oil minister said it would be troubling if the rise in oil prices became a trend; and accordingly, crude fell (more Brent than WTI) and backwardations narrowed. The Saudis and Russians have suggested a rise of 1mln BPD would be seen but, for what it is worth, most analysts have come to a consensus that the cartel is now targeting compliance, seeking a return back to 100%, which would see a &lsquo;net&rsquo; increase around 600k BPD from OPEC; it would, however, entail a production cut from non-OPEC, which UBS estimates is running at a 54% compliance rate, based on May 2018 numbers). On Monday, US energy secretary Perry said the oil market is stressed from the standpoint of supply, stating that the US will do everything it can to ensure gasoline prices are reasonable. On the OPEC/Non-OPEC deal, Perry said it fell short of what was needed. Following the recent conflict at Libyan oil ports, a Haftar spokesman stated they are to hand over control of the eastern ports to the NOC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* INVENTORY EXPECTATIONS: </strong>This week, analysts expect crude stocks to draw by 2.5mln barrels, stocks at Cushing are seen drawing by 2.25mln, gasoline is expected to build by 1.2mln, while stocks of distillates are seen building by 600k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The index has marginally extended the downside of its range to sub-94.300 vs 94.700 at the other extreme and the broad Dollar is ending the first EU trading day of the week on a mixed footing having held gains vs all its G10 counterparts bar the safest of safe-havens earlier. US-specific macro impulses rather contrasting and not really impacting, but for the record the national activity index slipped below par, while home sales came in considerably better than forecast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The Japanese currency was in demand amid the demand for haven assets in wake of a ramping up of trade war rhetoric. The yen was supported by declining Treasury yields (albeit slight) but also gained as US equities slipped, particularly in the latter part of the US day, as the APAC session came into focus. Navarro comments in late trade helped USDJPY move back to neutral for the day, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency moved back above 1.17 for the first time since the ECB&rsquo;s policy meeting in mid-June, largely as a result of a sliding Greenback. EUR shrugged off a mixed German Ifo survey, but found some technical traction to climb over its 21 DMA (1.1673) and test multi-resistance points around 1.1680. 1.17 was still holding following positive comments from Navarro, that appeared to play down the WSJ reports, though is being tested strongly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Cable bounced from the low 1.3220 area towards 1.3300, but faded amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and press reports highlighting rebellions against UK PM May. GBP had another look to try and print fresh HOD after reports that PM May told the EU&rsquo;s Tusk that the UK will release in a white paper its vision for the post-Brexit relationship with the EU, though it will be published after the June Council meeting. GBP&rsquo;s gains against the EUR after the headline hit were fleeting, given the single currency was itself testing HOD against the buck at the time. 1.33 remains the focus, but the level hasn&rsquo;t been tested in US trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, CAD, AUD: </strong>All casualties of the heightened global protectionism dynamic, with the Kiwi unable to maintain 0.6900 vs its US peer, the Loonie back below 1.3300 and AUD looking vulnerable around 0.7400 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRY: </strong>The Lira&rsquo;s trading range was wide in wake of its Presidential election over the weekend, which saw the incumbent Erdogan&rsquo;s AKP win another term without the need for a second vote. The knee jerk was for TRY strength against the USD, falling to lows above 4.54, though gains were pared as the session progressed, with participants refocussing on the more activist role that the President will play in monetary policy, as he pledged to do so in his campaign; Erdogan favours low rates at a time when the Lira &ndash; and EMs in general &ndash; have come under pressure, seeing inflation rise in recent months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* MXN: </strong>The peso has advanced to under 20 against the dollar, after an advisor to Lopez Obrador, the leading candidate in the upcoming Presidential elections, said that AMLO will do all he can to strengthen the peso, which he said was currently undervalued. The advisor talked about the need to create the conditions for investor confidence, and not via market interventions.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) both initially opened higher with gains led by the energy sector in the wake of the OPEC+ agreement to raise output so they no longer overshoot on production cuts. The actual communique didn&rsquo;t explicitly state an amount for the output increase, although the touted figures by ministers were much less than some of the previously suggested scenarios of as much as 1.8mln bpd, which in turn lifted crude by around 4% on Friday. However, gains in the bourses were later pared as trade tensions returned to the fore with the US Treasury said to be devising rules to restrict China investment under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Elsewhere, the Hang Seng (-1.2%) was among the laggards as money market rates in Hong Kong printed fresh decade highs, while Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) was choppy as support from the PBoC&rsquo;s policy efforts tussled with renewed trade concerns. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with prices flat near last week&rsquo;s best levels amid the cautious risk tone. The release of the Summary of Opinions also failed to spur demand as the BoJ stuck to its rehashed statements, and the central bank&rsquo;s presence in the market was largely ignored as it was only seeking Treasury discount bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC announced that it will lower some banks&#39; RRR by 50 basis points on July 5th. (Xinhua)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC is to cut the re-lending rate for SME loans by 50bps. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a daily net drain of CNY 10bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.4893 (Prev. 6.4804)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Summary of Opinions from June 14th-15th meeting stated it is appropriate to pursue powerful monetary easing with persistence under the current guideline as inflation is a long way from target but added the momentum towards achieving 2% is maintained. Furthermore, Summary of Opinions stated that although Japan&#39;s GDP for the March quarter of 2018 contracted for the first time in nine quarters, this largely reflects temporary factors such as irregular weather. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRADE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is said to be planning new restrictions on tech exports to China and Chinese investment with an announcement expected by end of the week. Furthermore, repots stated the US Treasury is devising rules to block firms with 25% Chinese ownership from acquiring companies involved in industrially significant technologies and that it plans using International Emergency Economic Powers Act 1977 to impose investment restrictions. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that the US is insisting all countries that have placed trade barriers and tariffs on goods going into their country, remove them or be met with more than reciprocity by the US, while he added trade must be fair and not one-way. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Vasiliauskas states the ECB could start to discuss lifting short-term interest rates from autumn 2019.

(Espresso)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least 50 UK Conservative MPs are willing to rebel against the government if PM May fails to inject more money into defence, an ally of Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, said last night. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over 50 Conservative MPs are prepared to block any attempt to remove Britain from the EU without a deal &mdash; including some sitting ministers &mdash; according to senior Conservative politicians.

Overnight, it was stated that the Trump administration is reportedly planning to bar a number of Chinese companies from investing in US tech while blocking exports to China. The two measures are to be announced at the end of the week. In the wake of this, the IT sector in Europe underperforms. In terms of stock specifics, Prysmian (-7.6%) rests at the foot of the Stoxx 600 amid additional FY costs and a cut in the company&rsquo;s EBITDA outlook.

Nothing really new or obvious to spark the retracement, but Italian debt has pared some losses towards 126.00 vs just below 125.50 at worst vs EU cash equities that are nudging new troughs.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began the week mixed as the region digested a targeted RRR reduction by the PBoC with reports the US is planning new restrictions on tech exports to China and on Chinese investment, which are expected to be announced by end of the week. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) both initially opened higher with gains led by the energy sector in the wake of the OPEC+ agreement to raise output so they no longer overshoot on production cuts. The actual communique didn&rsquo;t explicitly state an amount for the output increase, although the touted figures by ministers were much less than some of the previously suggested scenarios of as much as 1.8mln bpd, which in turn lifted crude by around 4% on Friday. However, gains in the bourses were later pared as trade tensions returned to the fore with the US Treasury said to be devising rules to restrict China investment under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Elsewhere, the Hang Seng (-0.7%) was among the laggards as money market rates in Hong Kong printed fresh decade highs, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) was choppy as support from the PBoC&rsquo;s policy efforts tussled with renewed trade concerns. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with prices flat near last week&rsquo;s best levels amid the cautious risk tone. The release of the Summary of Opinions also failed to spur demand as the BoJ stuck to its rehashed statements, and the central bank&rsquo;s presence in the market was largely ignored as it was only seeking Treasury discount bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin&nbsp;the week cautious as the region digests a targeted RRR reduction by the PBoC with reports the US is planning new restrictions on tech exports to China and on Chinese investment, which are expected to be announced by end of the week. ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) both initially opened higher with gains led by the energy sector in the wake of the OPEC+ agreement to raise output so they no longer overshoot on production cuts. The actual communique didn&rsquo;t explicitly state an amount for the output increase, although the touted figures by ministers were much less than some of the previously suggested scenarios of as much as 1.8mln bpd, which in turn lifted crude by around 4% on Friday. However, gains in the bourses were later pared as trade tensions returned to the fore with the US Treasury said to be devising rules to restrict China investment under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Elsewhere, the Hang Seng (-0.7%) conforms to the overall weakness, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) is choppy with trade concerns overshadowing the PBoC&rsquo;s policy efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, most major currencies are uneventful with the DXY flat around 94.50 and with its counterparts across the pond trading sideways overnight in the mid-1.1600 and mid-1.3200 handles for EUR/USD and GBP/USD respectively. Elsewhere, USD/CAD is slightly higher but with price action relatively low-key in comparison to the volatility last Friday triggered by weak data and oil strength, while JPY benefits from safe-haven flows with USD/JPY retreating further below the 110.00 level. However, the biggest movers in FX came from EM with CNY weaker on the PBoC&rsquo;s quasi-loosening and with TRY buoyed after President Erdogan won the election on Sunday with more than 50% of votes to avoid the need for a 2nd round run-off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful with prices flat near last week&rsquo;s best levels amid the cautious risk tone. The release of the Summary of Opinions also failed to spur demand as the BoJ stuck to its rehashed statements, and the central bank&rsquo;s presence in the market was largely ignored as it was only seeking to buy Treasury discount bills. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
