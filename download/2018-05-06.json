The Summary of Opinions for that meeting stated it is appropriate to pursue powerful monetary easing with persistence under the current guideline, while there was also the opinion that with the inflation rate increasing towards target and the potential growth rate rising going forward, the effects of monetary easing measures will be enhanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The policy decision failed to impact markets as expectations were unanimous for the central bank to keep policy unchanged, while the statement also didn&rsquo;t contain anything surprising. This is seen as likely to be the same for today&rsquo;s release as there has also been a more recent policy announcement in April. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
