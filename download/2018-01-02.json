Elsewhere, supply of the five major grades of crude that underpin Brent are set to decline to 708k BPD in February from 974k BPD planned in January, according to oil research house PVM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Moody&rsquo;s forecasts that oil prices will trade in the range of $40-60 in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The API energy inventory data will be released on Wednesday, due to the holiday shortened week. The consensus view looks for crude stocks to draw by 4.2mln barrels. Genscape is said to have forecast stocks at Cushing will draw by 2.35m barrels. The products are both seen building in the week, with the Street expecting gasoline stocks to rise 1.6m barrels and distillates to rise by 100k barrels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar Index has gleaned some support from the best US manufacturing PMI print since March 2015 (after Markit&rsquo;s final reading for December 2017 was tweaked up to 55.1) to trade back up near the 92.000 handle, but remains weak overall having fallen to a 91.750 approx low amidst broad basket losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, Usd/Cad briefly traded below a mega option expiry at the 1.2525 strike (1.1 bn) and seemed destined to test a barrier down at 1.2500 before the partial Greenback recovery, with the Loonie also underpinned by a firmer December manufacturing survey (Canada&rsquo;s PMI up to 54.7 from 54.4 previously). Usd/Cad resistance and daily pivot at 1.2553 capping the pair as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Jpy almost hit its 112.03-04 100 DMA and still looks bearish from a chart perspective while below its daily cloud, while Cable clings to the 1.3550 area despite a UK manufacturing PMI disappointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eur/Usd got close to its 2017 peak (1.2092) with the aid of a record breaking pan Eurozone manufacturing PMI, while Aud/Usd almost reached 0.7850 as specs continued to cut shorts and re-establish longs that were reversed ahead of the 2017/2018 turn. Nzd/Usd stopped just a fraction short of strong tech resistance at 0.7131, but remains bullish while the Kiwi holds above 0.7100. Usd/Chf is ending the session around the middle of a 0.9750-0.9700 range and braced for more downside. EM currencies have also gained more ground vs the US unit, which has kicked off 2018 in the same vein as last year &ndash; on the back foot.</p>\r\n",

This helped the Chinese bourses outperform with the <strong>Hang Seng (+1.8%) and Shanghai Composite (+1.0%)</strong> outperforming other indices. <strong>South Korean markets edged slightly higher (+0.4%)</strong>, despite the recent geopolitical developments in the North with Kim Jong Un claiming he has a &ldquo;nuclear button&rdquo; on his desk.

(Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary Davis&#39;s allies fear that he risks being &quot;marginalised&quot; if Boris Johnson is handed a new &quot;super-charged&quot; Brexit role in a forthcoming Cabinet reshuffle with the Times reporting that May could sack as many as 5 ministers. (Telegraph/Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Markit/CIPS Manufacturing PMI (Dec) 56.3 vs. Exp. 58.0 (Prev. 58.2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>European equities have kicked the year off on the backfoot despite a relatively upbeat Asia-Pac session which saw indices supported by better than expected Chinese Caixin manufacturing PMI. In terms of sectors, European auto names notably underperform their peers with the European Auto Sector Index enduring its worst day since July of last year. This comes in the context of underperformance in autos during Asia-Pac trade after both Hyundai and Kia Motors warned of only modest sales growth this year. Furthermore, the firmer EUR could also be supressing some of the more currency-sensitive exporters in Europe. Elsewhere, material names underperform despite the encouraging Chinese data overnight, while airline names have seen support after a slew of upgrades at BofA. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX, the Greenback has extended losses across the board, with the DXY now losing complete grip of the 92.000 handle and heading for 91.500 from around 91.750. No specific bearish news, but the overall trend of Dollar weakness persists into the New Year as markets brace for some potential fundamental drivers via FOMC minutes (Wednesday) and NFP (Friday). AUD and CAD are vying for top G10 performer vs the beleaguered USD with the AUD buoyed by better than expected Chinese PMI data overnight and up towards multi-month peaks around 0.7835. EUR and NZD both around 0.25% firmer vs the Greenback, with the Kiwi eyeing 0.7150 next, while EUR/USD has 1.2050 in its sight following hawkish/upbeat ECB rhetoric and ahead of the final Eurozone manufacturing PMI. GBP has been seen higher throughout the session with initial optimism amid reports of a potential UK cabinet reshuffle which saw EUR/GBP slip below 0.8900 before GBP strength was stuck in its tracks after UK manufacturing PMI (56.3 vs. Exp. 58.0) fell short of expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In fixed income markets, a couple of decent sell orders appear to have exacerbated losses in debt futures, with clips of 2k noted and blocked in Bunds and Gilts at various times on the way down to fresh Eurex and Liffe lows of 161.22 and 124.45 respectively. To recap, Bunds actually traded flat initially, but then sold off immediately, while Gilts somehow resumed Liffe a tick firmer at 125.17 before correcting lower with their Eurozone counterpart and USTs that have succumbed to further weakness amidst the overall decline in bonds and ratchet higher in yields. Various catalysts including upbeat manufacturing surveys, hawkish CB commentary and bearish chart impulses/signals, while looming supply has also impacted (corporate pipeline and sovereign syndications anticipated in 10 year tenors from several Eurozone peripheral member states). Bunds inching closer to the next downside support area around 161.18/yield edging nearer to 0.50%.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the energy complex, both WTI and Brent crude futures have been supported by ongoing tensions in the Middle East after Iran&#39;s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) announced it is taking charge of security in Tehran as nationwide protests entered their fifth day. This has subsequently offset and over-shadowed any potential bearish pressure from news that Libya have resumed oil flows to the Es Sider terminal and the reopening of the Forties pipeline. In metals markets, gold prices remain supported after breaching USD 1300/oz to the upside last week and alongside a broadly softer USD. Elsewhere, Chinese steel futures were seen higher overnight, although some analysts note fears over potential for upside given the prospects for cold weather to slow construction activity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>European equities have kicked the year off on the backfoot despite a relatively upbeat Asia-Pac session which saw indices supported by better than expected Chinese Caixin manufacturing PMI. In terms of sectors, European auto names notably underperform their peers with the European Auto Sector Index enduring its worst day since July of last year. This comes in the context of underperformance in autos during Asia-Pac trade after both Hyundai and Kia Motors warned of only modest sales growth this year. Furthermore, the firmer EUR could also be supressing some of the more currency-sensitive exporters in Europe. Elsewhere, material names underperform despite the encouraging Chinese data overnight, while airline names have seen support after a slew of upgrades at BofA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX, the Greenback has extended losses across the board, with the DXY now losing complete grip of the 92.000 handle and heading for 91.500 from around 91.750. No specific bearish news, but the overall trend of Dollar weakness persists into the New Year as markets brace for some potential fundamental drivers via FOMC minutes (Wednesday) and NFP (Friday). AUD and CAD are vying for top G10 performer vs the beleaguered USD with the AUD buoyed by better than expected Chinese PMI data overnight and up towards multi-month peaks around 0.7835. EUR and NZD both around 0.25% firmer vs the Greenback, with the Kiwi eyeing 0.7150 next, while EUR/USD has 1.2050 in its sight following hawkish/upbeat ECB rhetoric and ahead of the final Eurozone manufacturing PMI. GBP has been seen higher throughout the session with initial optimism amid reports of a potential UK cabinet reshuffle which saw EUR/GBP slip below 0.8900 before GBP strength was stuck in its tracks after UK manufacturing PMI (56.3 vs. Exp. 58.0) fell short of expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fixed income markets, a couple of decent sell orders appear to have exacerbated losses in debt futures, with clips of 2k noted and blocked in Bunds and Gilts at various times on the way down to fresh Eurex and Liffe lows of 161.22 and 124.45 respectively. To recap, Bunds actually traded flat initially, but then sold off immediately, while Gilts somehow resumed Liffe a tick firmer at 125.17 before correcting lower with their Eurozone counterpart and USTs that have succumbed to further weakness amidst the overall decline in bonds and ratchet higher in yields. Various catalysts including upbeat manufacturing surveys, hawkish CB commentary and bearish chart impulses/signals, while looming supply has also impacted (corporate pipeline and sovereign syndications anticipated in 10 year tenors from several Eurozone peripheral member states). Bunds inching closer to the next downside support area around 161.18/yield edging nearer to 0.50%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the energy complex, both WTI and Brent crude futures have been supported by ongoing tensions in the Middle East after Iran&#39;s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) announced it is taking charge of security in Tehran as nationwide protests entered their fifth day. This has subsequently offset and over-shadowed any potential bearish pressure from news that Libya have resumed oil flows to the Es Sider terminal. In metals markets, gold prices remain supported after breaching USD 1300/oz to the upside last week and alongside a broadly softer USD. Elsewhere, Chinese steel futures were seen higher overnight, although some analysts note fears over potential for upside given the prospects for cold weather to slow construction activity. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
