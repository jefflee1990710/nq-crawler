Moreover, US Defence Secretary Mattis noted it is time for Iran to shape up and show responsibility. On the Iranian front, the Foreign Ministry said Iran will respond with equal countermeasures if the US attempts to block its oil exports. In addition, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander said the US should not threaten Iran as they will receive a &quot;strong unimaginable and regrettable&quot; response. US Defence Secretary Mattis is concerned about military in the South China Sea; adds it is time for Iran to shape up and show responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump tweeted &quot;Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. It&rsquo;s as simple as that&quot; added &quot;and everybody&rsquo;s talking! Remember, we are the &ldquo;piggy bank&rdquo; that&rsquo;s being robbed. All will be Great!&quot;. Later an official reported the EU is looking to suspend Trump tariffs in order to facilitate a trade deal, noting that tariffs make it harder to negotiate. This came in the context of President Trump threatening the EU with tariffs on autos and auto parts which has subsequently prompted EU Commission Head Juncker to visit Washington to address the matter. Additionally, the USDA Secretary Perdue reported the US authorised a one-time programme of up to USD 12bln to assist farmers that suffered from tariffs. The plan includes direct payment, food purchase and trade promotion programmes and is anticipated to kick in on labour day. On NAFTA, the Mexico incoming NAFTA negotiator Jesus Seade said to expect the renegotiation to conclude within the next few months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TURKISH RATE DECISION: </strong>The Central Bank unexpectedly kept the Weekly Repo Rate unchanged at 17.75%. The consensus was for a 100 &ndash; 125bps hike. At the meeting, the CBT stated that further monetary tightening will be delivered if needed, and will be necessary to maintain tight monetary policy stance for an extended period, until inflation displays significant movement. The CBT added the cost factors and volatility in food prices have been the main drivers of inflation upside. Analysts were concerned that after President Erdogan appointed his son-in-law to the Finance and Treasury, while taking more control over the central bank, his influence has succeeded in avoiding higher rates, in line with President Erdogan&#39;s election campaign position. In an immediate reaction to the rate decision, USDTRY rose from 4.75 to 4.91.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May released a statement on Tuesday announcing she will lead Brexit negotiations with the EU whilst the Brexit department will lead on domestic preparations. Later, a UK Government spokeswoman Donnelly reported that UK PM May wants negotiations to accelerate. On the White Paper, UK PM&#39;s Europe Advisor Robbins noted the negotiation team has sounded out European partners on the Chequers agreement but there has been no straight answer on whether it is acceptable or not. UK Brexit Secretary Raab warned it will be challenging to have a full framework on the future relationship with the EU sorted out by March 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX&nbsp; +0.46% at 2819, NDX +0.47% at 7406, DJI +0.78% at 25238.</strong> SECTORS: Energy: +1.17%, Materials: +1.22%, Industrials: +0.31%, Cons Discretionary: +0.04%, Cons Staples: -0.33%, Health Care: +0.84%, Financials: +0.21%, Tech: +0.76%, Telecoms: +1.51%, Utilities: +0.33%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*EARNINGS: </strong>Alphabet (GOOGL) reported AMC on Monday which beat on both top and bottom end on an adjusted basis to exclude the recent fine from the EU which boosted NDX futures Monday evening as the stock saw highs of 5% after market. 3M (MMM) also reported figures beating both top and bottom line which resulted in pre-market gains, however it lowered the top end of its guidance which then led to the initial pre market gains being depleted slightly before closing slightly higher. United Tech (UTX) and Verizon (VZ) also attributed to gains in the DJI, as both names beat on both top and bottom end, with UTX raising its FY18 EPS guidance and VZ wireless revenues also gaining.&nbsp; Harley Davidson (HOG) also beat on both EPS &amp; Revenue, and confirmed its FY shipment guidance, its motorcycle sales for the quarter were higher by 0.7%, however shipments were down 11% to 72593, however it backed its FY19 motorcycle shipments forecast. Whirlpool (WHR) washed away ~14% of their share price today after a poor earnings report where both EPS and revenues missed Wall St. expectations and also cut its FY18 ongoing EPS forecast as well as its operating cash flow view to roughly USD 1.5bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (U8) FUTURES SETTLE 63C HIGHER AT USD 68.52/BBL; BRENT (U8) FUTURES SETTLE 38C HIGHER AT USD 73.44.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of this week&#39;s inventor data, crude rallied; analysts noted that gains were being led by gasoline, which might suggest a constructive view with regards to this week&#39;s API/DOE data according to Citi. The Street is expecting a headline crude draw of 2.3mln barrels, gasoline is seen drawing by 700k barrels, and distillate is expected to build by 200k barrels. Analysts also noted that WTI was outperforming Brent on Tuesday, which Citi attributes to some complacency regarding the latest public exchange of warnings between the US (Trump) and Iran (Zarif). Citi also noted the weakness in the September/October calendar spread in Brent, which in its view, confirms that the wider market has a current surplus, with physical tightness to develop later, after US sanctions on Iranian crude exports become effective in November; Iran&#39;s foreign ministry has warned of countermeasures if the US tried to end its oil exports. Elsewhere, a strike at Total&#39;s North Sea platform ended on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 2+ TICKS HIGHER AT 119-180.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries ended Tuesday&rsquo;s session mixed and mostly flat. Most of the action was concentrated in the long end of the curve where yields were lower by c.2bps at settlement. 2s30s and 5s30s narrowed by c.2bps, 2s10s and 5s10s narrowed by c.1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury sold $35bln in 2yr notes at a high-yield of 2.657%, the highest since July 2008. The bid-to-cover came in at 2.92x, the highest since January. Indirects took the largest share since February whilst directs were awarded the smallest portion since March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Dollar has been largely locked in ranges vs G10 counterparts, and the DXY anchored around 94.500 accordingly, as USD/major pairings trade close to round numbers that have been pivotal in recent sessions. US Treasury yields remain firm and supportive, but the Greenback has lost some momentum vs certain higher-yielding/beta currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>Strong EU pm performances by the antipodeans, and especially the AUD that has reclaimed 0.7400+ status with a bit more vigour than its Kiwi peer back on the firm side of 0.6800, as the cross climbs towards 1.0900 again. Perhaps the former is benefiting from short covering and positioning ahead of Aussie Q2 CPI data overnight given expectations for firmer inflation reads whereas upcoming NZ trade could be more of a wildcard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Vying for 2nd spot with the Kiwi and firmer vs other G10s, as Cable breaks above its 200 HMA (having held around the 100 HMA circa 1.3075 earlier in the session) to test 1.3150 and EURGBP retreats towards 0.8900 amidst latest Brexit reports suggesting UK PM May will now take the lead role in negotiations with the EU and leave the dedicated Leave department to sort out domestic preparations for life outside the union (with or without a deal).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, EUR:</strong> Both being drawn to big figures, at 111.00 and 1.1700 respectively, with the former seeing more reaction and hedging for a potentially more hawkish tilt from the BoJ, which coincidentally falls on month end and is said to have prompted exporter selling of the headline pair in advance. Meanwhile, the single currency has benefited to a degree from Eurozone flash PMIs and manufacturing beats more than offsetting services misses to bounce off key chart resistance in the 1.1660-65 area and right into decent option expiry interest in time for the NY cut (1.1690-1.1710 in 1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, CHF: </strong>The Loonie has also benefited from another broad USD downturn to breach the upper end of a 1.3190-65 range and test 1.3135 amidst another rebound in crude prices. However, the Franc is lagging and remains caught in a relatively narrow 0.9920-55 corridor vs the Greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Some decent recovery gains vs the USD, but also more measured rebound from the MXN amidst ongoing NAFTA uncertainly and sharp underperformance for the likes of the Lira that lurched back towards all-time lows vs the USD after the CBRT confounded all but the most slender minority by keeping the main 1 week repo at 17.75% vs forecasts for a 100 or even 150 bp hike. The Bank did shift to a more hawkish stance via the accompanying statement, but USDTRY spiked above 4.9000 from around 4.7500 and not far from all-time lows before regaining some composure.

The Street is expecting a headline crude draw of 2.3mln barrels, gasoline is seen drawing by 700k barrels, and distillate is expected to build by 200k barrels. Analysts also noted that WTI was outperforming Brent on Tuesday, which Citi attributes to some complacency regarding the latest public exchange of warnings between the US (Trump) and Iran (Zarif). Citi also noted the weakness in the September/October calendar spread in Brent, which in its view, confirms that the wider market has a current surplus, with physical tightness to develop later, after US sanctions on Iranian crude exports become effective in November; Iran&#39;s foreign ministry has warned of countermeasures if the US tried to end its oil exports.

The risk, however, is that the US Treasury will increase auction sizes in the 5-year sector at the August refunding (on 1 August), which could weigh on the sector.</li>\r\n  <li>Looking specifically at the 2-year sector, recent auctions have been taken down without too much drama, with last month&rsquo;s auction coming in on the screws; in terms of participation, the uptrend in dealer participation combined with higher dealer inventory hints at some pressure on front-end rates, which may drive the 2-year and 3-year sectors continuing to cheapen versus OIS, TD says. Auction results will be published shortly after 1800 BST/1300 EST.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar has been largely locked in ranges vs G10 counterparts, and the DXY anchored around 94.500 accordingly, as Usd/major pairings trade close to round numbers that have been pivotal in recent sessions. US Treasury yields remain firm and supportive, but the Greenback has lost some momentum vs certain higher-yielding/beta currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strong EU pm performances by the antipodeans, and especially the Aud that has reclaimed 0.7400+ status with a bit more vigour than its Kiwi peer back on the firm side of 0.6800, as the cross climbs towards 1.0900 again. Perhaps the former is benefiting from short covering and positioning ahead of Aussie Q2 CPI data overnight given expectations for firmer inflation reads whereas upcoming NZ trade could be more of a wildcard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vying for 2nd spot with the Kiwi and firmer vs other G10s, as Cable breaks above its 200 HMA (having held around the 100 HMA circa 1.3075 earlier in the session) to test 1.3150 and Eur/Gbp retreats towards 0.8900 amidst latest Brexit reports suggesting UK PM May will now take the lead role in negotiations with the EU and leave the dedicated Leave department to sort out domestic preparations for life outside the union (with or without a deal).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both being drawn to big figures, at 111.00 and 1.1700 respectively, with the former seeing more reaction and hedging for a potentially more hawkish tilt from the BoJ, which coincidentally falls on month end and is said to have prompted exporter selling of the headline pair in advance. Meanwhile, the single currency has benefited to a degree from Eurozone flash PMIs and manufacturing beats more than offsetting services misses to bounce off key chart resistance in the 1.1660-65 area and right into decent option expiry interest in time for the NY cut (1.1690-1.1710 in 1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has also benefited from another broad Usd downturn to breach the upper end of a 1.3190-65 range and test 1.3135 amidst another rebound in crude prices. However, the Franc is lagging and remains caught in a relatively narrow 0.9920-55 corridor vs the Greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some decent recovery gains vs the Usd, but also more measured rebound from the Mxn amidst ongoing NAFTA uncertainly and sharp underperformance for the likes of the Lira that lurched back towards all time lows vs the Usd after the CBRT confounded all but the most slender minority by keeping the main 1 week repo at 17.75% vs forecasts for a 100 or even 150 bp hike. The Bank did shift to a more hawkish stance via the accompanying statement, but Usd/Try spiked above 4.9000 from around 4.7500 and not far from all time lows before regaining some composure. In similar vein, the Cny and Cnh both pared losses from 4.8000+ lows vs the Buck, and maybe anticipating some form of intervention or another rant about FX manipulation from US President Trump.</p>\r\n",

This could be due to technical impulses, and for Bunds a failure to clear upside resistance in the 162.23-26 area with the subsequent pull-back bringing a rising chart trend-line back into play at 162.10. Market contacts are flagging this as a pivot on a closing basis to signal either a bearish or bullish outlook, while for Gilts nearest resistance and support come in at 123.70 and 122.85. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) were higher with strength seen in financials especially in Japan amid ongoing speculation the BoJ could tweak its policy settings next week, considering that the central bank&rsquo;s current prolonged ultra-easy policy is viewed as a dampener on Japanese bank profits. Hang Seng (+1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.6%) led the gains in the region with sentiment underpinned after China announced further measures on Monday to support demand including a tax reduction targeting research spending, bonds for infrastructure investment and a more proactive fiscal policy. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initally marginally higher on short-covering following recent declines, although the rebound in prices was later reversed amid softer 40yr auction results and prospects of a BoJ policy tweak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 70bln.

Sentiment for the sector has also been bolstered by US President Trump stating he wishes to work something out with the EU regarding trade and that he is ready to do something regarding auto imports from the EU. Sector wise, Material names outperform on the base-metal rebound while Financials are boosted by UBS&rsquo; (+3.6%) strong post-earnings performance, lifting fellow financial names such as Commerzbank (+3.5%) and Credit Suisse (+2.2%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, the writing was on the wall ahead of the flash Eurozone release, so the manufacturing beat or services miss did not come as a surprise, but the sub-forecast composite reading could have encouraged some short covering/profit taking in core bonds. Whatever the rationale/catalyst, Bunds and Gilts are back on big figure handles after declining to fresh lows for the day at 161.82 and 122.94 respectively (-28 and -35 ticks), with the former also setting a fresh July base in the process. In fact, the 10 year UK debt future rebounding to a new Liffe peak at 123.24 in wake of a solid 2024 DMO auction and its EZ counterpart rebounded in sympathy initially before marginally outperforming and climbing into positive territory at 162.17. Back to Liffe, CBI Trends Survey is due shortly. Meanwhile, USTs remain largely side-lined, but a tad firmer and still in corrective mode following Monday&rsquo;s pronounced bear-steepening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Firm, but off best levels as the index consolidates within a 94.535-865 range after another rise in tandem with higher US Treasury yields and ongoing Yuan depreciation. Note, the PBoC fixed the Usd/Cny mid point considerably higher today, resulting in the on-shore unit closing at its weakest level (6.8100) since the end of June last year, while the Cnh has fallen below 6.8400. However, rebounds in other currencies on several more specific/independent factors have nudged the Greenback down from its overnight peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY/NZD - All now marginally firmer vs the Usd, with Cable crossing 1.3100 again ahead of the latest CBI industrial trends survey, the Jpy nestling midway between 111.05-50 parameters after reports of exporter offers for month end (plus persistent hawkish BoJ spec) and the Kiwi retesting psychological resistance around 0.6800 before NZ trade data later tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/EUR/CHF - The Loonie is holding in a 1.3165-90 band, Aud around 0.7375 and still tracking Yuan moves, but the single currency has bounced off 1.1655 lows on the back of Eurozone flash PMIs showing outperformance in the manufacturing sector vs somewhat less upbeat services activity. Note also, a 50% Fib resides at 1.1663 and there is decent option expiry interest at 1.1665 and from 1.1690-1.1710 (1 bn each), with the latter capping the upside, just. Meanwhile, the Franc is still sitting tight within a 0.9920-55 band, though has pared relative gains vs the Eur on the aforementioned prelim PMIs &ndash; cross firming up after a brief dip below 1.1600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Try and Huf in focus given CB policy meetings today, and the Lira looking for further tightening from the CBRT to keep its recovery momentum going (Usd/Try pivoting 4.7500 at present), but the Forint not anticipating action from the NBH or any tweak to its neutral sycne (Eur/Huf circa 326.75 currently).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities trade fairly mixed with WTI and Brent off overnight lows as they breach USD 68.00/bbl and USD 73.00/bbl to the upside respectively in an attempt to nurse yesterday&rsquo;s losses. Earlier today, Iran said it will respond with equal countermeasures if the US attempts to block its oil exports. This week, analysts are forecasting US crude stocks to print a draw of 3.5mln barrels, for distillates a build 0.2mln barrels and for gasoline a draw of 0.8mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold is trading flat following the pullback from the dollar. In base metals, London copper rebounds on supply concerns following a deadlock at the world&rsquo;s largest copper mine in Chile where Unions stated negotiations with management have broken down while an agreement before next week does not seem likely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian Foreign Ministry says Iran will respond with equal countermeasures if the US attempts to block its oil exports.

        "content": "<p>Fifteen of the 16 analysts polled by Reuters expect the central bank to hike its one-week repo rate by 100&ndash;125bps to 18.75%-19.00%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>June&#39;s inflation data saw the Y/Y rate rise to 14.39% from 12.15%, while PPI Y/Y ticked up to 23.71% from 20.16%. Adding to the hike case is the Turkish lira, which has been depreciating against the Greenback and has lost more than a fifth of its value this year, contributing to higher food costs, fuel and consumer goods prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPMorgan says &ldquo;the CBT needs to help restore policy credibility, and hike rates in light of the sharp rise in inflation in June and also the re-emergence of rising inflation expectations&rdquo; (12 month expectations are at around 11%; four months ago they were around 9%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other analysts have argued for a rate hike based on a prevailing sense of investor scepticism, against a background of rising external risks, as trade wars seemingly ramp up, and Chinese slowdown concerns resurface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts at ABN AMRO, however, expect the CBT to stand pat on policy following the appointment of President Erdogan&rsquo;s son-in-law Berat Albayrak as Finance Minister, seen as a market-unfriendly presence and defined as &lsquo;an enemy of interest rates&rsquo;, placing the independence of the central bank, which has been questioned before, at risk. ABN AMRO&nbsp; argues &ldquo;given the tight grip of Erdogan on the central banks and as interest rate hikes do not fit with Turkey&rsquo;s economic growth strategy, we expect the Turkish central bank to keep the one-week repo rate on hold at the monetary policy meeting on 24 July.&quot;</p>\r\n",

Sentiment for the sector has also been bolstered by US President Trump stating he wishes to work something out with the EU regarding trade and that he is ready to do something regarding auto imports from the EU. Sector wise, Material names outperform on the base-metal rebound while Financials are boosted by UBS&rsquo; (+3.2%) strong post-earnings performance, lifting fellow financial names such as Commerzbank (+2.9%) and Credit Suisse (+2.7%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Firm, but off best levels as the index consolidates within a 94.535-865 range after another rise in tandem with higher US Treasury yields and ongoing Yuan depreciation. Note, the PBoC fixed the Usd/Cny mid point considerably higher today, resulting in the on-shore unit closing at its weakest level (6.8100) since the end of June last year, while the Cnh has fallen below 6.8400. However, rebounds in other currencies on several more specific/independent factors have nudged the Greenback down from its overnight peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY/NZD - All now marginally firmer vs the Usd, with Cable crossing 1.3100 again ahead of the latest CBI industrial trends survey, the Jpy nestling midway between 111.05-50 parameters after reports of exporter offers for month end (plus persistent hawkish BoJ spec) and the Kiwi retesting psychological resistance around 0.6800 before NZ trade data later tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/EUR/CHF - The Loonie is holding in a 1.3165-90 band, Aud around 0.7375 and still tracking Yuan moves, but the single currency has bounced off 1.1655 lows on the back of Eurozone flash PMIs showing outperformance in the manufacturing sector vs somewhat less upbeat services activity. Note also, a 50% Fib resides at 1.1663 and there is decent option expiry interest at 1.1665 and from 1.1690-1.1710 (1 bn each), with the latter capping the upside. Meanwhile, the Franc is still sitting tight within a 0.9920-55 band, though has pared relative gains vs the Eur on the aforementioned prelim PMIs &ndash; cross firming up after a brief dip below 1.1600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Try and Huf in focus given CB policy meetings today, and the Lira looking for further tightening from the CBRT to keep its recovery momentum going (Usd/Try pivoting 4.7500 at present), but the Forint not anticipating action from the NBH or any tweak to its neutral sycne (Eur/Huf circa 326.75 currently).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, the writing was on the wall ahead of the flash Eurozone release, so the manufacturing beat or services miss did not come as a surprise, but the sub-forecast composite reading could have encouraged some short covering/profit taking in core bonds. Whatever the rationale/catalyst, Bunds and Gilts are back on big figure handles after declining to fresh lows for the day at 161.82 and 122.94 respectively (-28 and -35 ticks), with the former also setting a fresh July base in the process. In fact, the 10 year UK debt future rebounding to a new Liffe peak at 123.22 in wake of a solid 2024 DMO auction and its EZ counterpart rebounded in sympathy to just eclipse its previous Eurex best at 162.09. Back to Liffe, CBI Trends Survey is due shortly. Meanwhile, USTs remain largely side-lined and in corrective mode following Monday&rsquo;s pronounced bear-steepening.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities trade fairly mixed with WTI and Brent off overnight lows as they breach USD 68.00/bbl and USD 73.00/bbl to the upside respectively in an attempt to nurse yesterday&rsquo;s losses. Earlier today, Iran said it will respond with equal countermeasures if the US attempts to block its oil exports. This week, analysts are forecasting US crude stocks to print a draw of 3.5mln barrels, for distillates a build 0.2mln barrels and for gasoline a draw of 0.8mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold is trading flat following the pullback from the dollar. In base metals, London copper rebounds on supply concerns following a deadlock at the world&rsquo;s largest copper mine in Chile where Unions stated negotiations with management have broken down while an agreement before next week does not seem likely.</p>\r\n",

Whatever the rationale/catalyst, Bunds and Gilts are back on big figure handles after declining to fresh lows for the day at 161.82 and 122.94 respectively (-28 and -35 ticks), with the former also setting a fresh July base in the process. In fact, the 10 year UK debt future just rebounded to a new Liffe peak at 123.18 , though may fade again as attention turns to upcoming supply and then the CBI survey. Elsewhere, USTs remain largely side-lined and in corrective mode following Monday&rsquo;s pronounced bear-steepening. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were higher with strength seen in financials especially in Japan amid ongoing speculation the BoJ could tweak its policy settings next week, considering that the central bank&rsquo;s current prolonged ultra-easy policy is viewed as a dampener on Japanese bank profits. Hang Seng (+1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.6%) led the gains in the region with sentiment underpinned after China announced further measures on Monday to support demand including a tax reduction targeting research spending, bonds for infrastructure investment and a more proactive fiscal policy. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initally marginally higher on short-covering following recent declines, although the rebound in prices was later reversed amid softer 40yr auction results and prospects of a BoJ policy tweak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 70bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7891 (Prev. 6.7593); weakest fix since 11th July 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Foreign Ministry spokesperson said China has no desire to bolster its exports through competitive devaluation and that its currency is being supported due to sound economic fundamentals. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China state researcher said China has room to cut the RRR rate in H2 2018. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&rsquo;s Broadbent (Neutral) said the first response will be to cut interest rates if inflation pressures weaken after the BoE starts to reverse QE and that unwinding QE may make dis-inflationary pressures in itself. Furthermore, Broadbent stated that estimates of the impact of QE on the economy are less precise than for interest rates. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May has been criticized for willingness to hand the EU a &lsquo;blank cheque&rsquo; as ministers prepare to publish the Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill on Tuesday which reportedly states the EU will inform the UK of the required payment amounts during the transition process. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Business Secretary Greg Clark is set to eye powers to block foreign takeovers. (Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were relatively quiet amid a sparse overnight economic calendar and as the greenback held onto yesterday&rsquo;s recovery spurred by higher US yields and further traction in USD/CNH. This kept its major counterparts near the prior day&rsquo;s lows with EUR/USD below 1.1700 and GBP/USD slipping below the 1.3100 handle, while USD/JPY was indecisive after its rebound stalled at 111.50. Elsewhere, antipodeans were also subdued by recent softness in commodities and further CNH depreciation which declined to levels last seen in April 2017 after the PBoC set the weakest reference rate in over a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly subdued overnight in which oil languished following the prior day&rsquo;s decline below the USD 68.00/bbl in WTI crude futures and with Brent under USD 73.00/bbl, while some desks previously noted that term structures were moving in a bearish direction with the Brent contango widening, which hinted at a lack of concern regarding tight markets. Elsewhere, gold prices remained weak as the greenback held on to its gains and amid the positive risk tone in the region, while copper outperformed on China strength following the announcement of further measures to support its economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran&rsquo;s Foreign minister Zarif said Iran is not impressed with the comments from US President Trump. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Satellite imagery showed North Korea has begun dismantling its key facilities at the Sohae satellite launch facility, according to 38 North. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yield curve bear-steepened with yields rising to their highest levels in over 5 weeks; at settlement, longer-dated yields were higher by c.7bps whilst 2yr yields were higher by c.3bps. The move was helped by developments over in Japan as the BoJ announced its first fixed-rate buying operation since February to purchase an unlimited amount of 10yr JGBs at 0.11% (though didn&rsquo;t have to actually use the operation). The announcement followed a sharp fall in JGBs after sources on Friday reported that the central bank may scale back stimulus and tweak its targets. US Treasury 2s10s and 2s30s widened by more than 3bps, 5s10s and 5s30s by c.2ps. Ahead of the US GDP release on Friday, US President Trump said to expect GDP growth to come in at 4.8%. US 10yr T-notes futures (U8) settled 16 ticks lower at 119-15+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said we will see if we can work something out with the EU regarding trade and that he is ready to do something regarding auto imports from the EU. President Trump also stated he talked to the Mexican President at length and thinks they can work out a deal on NAFTA, while he added that the US and Mexico are working together on something dramatic for trade.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher which is consistent with the performance of their counterparts on Wall St where financials outperformed amid rising yields and Nasdaq 100 futures were boosted after-hours following earnings from Alphabet. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) are higher with strength seen in financials especially in Japan amid ongoing speculation the BoJ could tweak its policy settings next week, considering that the central bank&rsquo;s current prolonged ultra-easy policy is viewed as a dampener on Japanese bank profits. Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%) have led the gains in the region with sentiment underpinned after China announced further measures on Monday to support demand including a tax reduction targeting research spending, bonds for infrastructure investment and a more proactive fiscal policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively quiet amid a sparse economic calendar and with the greenback holding onto yesterday&rsquo;s recovery spurred by higher US yields and further traction in USD/CNH. This has kept its major counterparts near the prior day&rsquo;s lows with EUR/USD below 1.1700 and GBP/USD struggling to maintain the 1.3100 handle, while USD/JPY is indecisive after its rebound stalled at 111.50. Elsewhere, antipodeans are also subdued by recent softness in commodities and further CNH depreciation which declined to levels last seen in April 2017 after the PBoC set the weakest reference rate in over a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid short-covering following recent declines, although the rebound in prices has been contained ahead of a 40yr auction later and ongoing prospects of a BoJ policy tweak.</p>\r\n",
