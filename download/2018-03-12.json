Attention is also on this week&#39;s OPEC and IEA monthly reports, which are expected to build on the theme of record US output. US crude production levels continue to scale record highs, and last week&#39;s EIA STEO showed no signs of this trend abating (production forecasts revised up, demand forecasts were revised down). On this note, today the EIA reported that April shale output is likely to accelerate, forecasting a +131k BPD at 6.954mln vs. March&#39;s +105k BPD. In terms of positioning, the latest CFTC commitment of traders data shows WTI longs cut by ~17k contracts -- still at a healthy 479k -- in the week (to 6/Mar), as longs were slightly pared, but shorts jumped; some desks warn that more negative oil data could compel further spec longs to close out their positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Workers at Libya&#39;s Zawiya oil port are said to halt loadings despite earlier reports of negotiations taking place to end strike action at Zawiya.

Stocks found some support in afternoon trade, on reports that Larry Kudlow - a proponent of free trade - may replace Cohn. Tech-focused Nasdaq was up being the highest preforming index following Micron&rsquo;s (MO) upgrading at Nomura, and Oclaro&rsquo;s jump after Lumentum (LITE) would acquire them for USD 1.7bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD&nbsp;</strong>trades negative heading into APAC trade, with the 90.0 figure failing to hold. Attention remains on Trade War related news flow; EU policy makers have responded to Trump&#39;s weekend tweets, and are said to be preparing counter-measures to any tariffs imposed. USD traded as low as 89.84.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:&nbsp;</strong>Continued clawing-back losses seen in aftermath of ECB&#39;s meeting last week, 1.23 has been a level in focus. The single currency trades above this figure as EU policy makers talk up a possible response to trumps tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:&nbsp;</strong>maintained low following reports of cronyism from Abe, trading within range through EU and US trade is eyeing the 106.20 mark, a level traders have been watching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD:&nbsp;</strong>PM Trudeau sounded upbeat on his media rounds on Monday, and believes Canada will get a good deal. He also suggested that Canada would not walk away from NAFTA negotiations, contrary to his claims on 2/Feb, where he was said to be willing to walk away from NAFTA. Nevertheless, the upbeat and optimistic was the theme, and USDCAD has been trading laterally with little real action on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:&nbsp;</strong>was trading flat in European trade around the 1.3860, however, was lifted after news that the UK is close on Brexit implementation period with the EU, boosting cable to 1.39, and trading henceforth within a narrow range of 1.388 and 1.390</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLED 6 TICKS HIGHER AT 120-27.&nbsp;</strong>Action was subdued on Monday, and volume was thin. In overnight trade, the curve had bear steepend amid a constructive risk environment. However, gains were seen through European and US trade, despite a healthy slate of corporate issuance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The US sold 3y and 10y notes on Monday, with the former stopping-through .02bps and the yield highest since 2007, while the latter was on the screws and performing much better than the previous auction where 3s and 10s were sold on the same day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE:&nbsp;</strong>Oil futures began the week on the back foot. Crude stocks are seen building this week, with the median looking for +1.5mln, and Cushing +320k (according to Genscape). Products are once again seen drawing, the street forecasting distillate draw of 1.4mln, and gasoline draw of 2.1mln..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Attention is also on this week&#39;s OPEC and IEA monthly reports, which are expected to build on the theme of record US output. US crude production levels continue to scale record highs, and last week&#39;s EIA STEO showed no signs of this trend abating (production forecasts revised up, demand forecasts were revised down). On this note, today the EIA reported that April shale output is likely to accelerate, forecasting a +131k BPD at 6.954mln vs. March&#39;s +105k BPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* In terms of positioning, the latest CFTC commitment of traders data shows WTI longs cut by ~17k contracts -- still at a healthy 479k -- in the week (to 6/Mar), as longs were slightly pared, but shorts jumped; some desks warn that more negative oil data could compel further spec longs to close out their positions. Last week, data also showed oil drillers cutting four rigs in the week (first cut in seven weeks).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Small deviation and a few changes in the G10 rankings, but ranges remain very tight and the overall theme has been more consolidation after Friday&rsquo;s lively post-NFP activity. The Chf, Jpy, Aud and Gbp are all vying for top spot with the safe-havens underpinned by Japanese political jitters and an early Wall Street wobble (sub-0.9500/106.50 again), while Aud/Usd is still poised just below key Fib resistance between 0.7875-95, which also encompasses the 55 DMA and late February high. Cable and Eur/Gbp continue to trade on Brexit headlines, with the former testing 1.3900 and latter just off 0.8850 lows on claims from Junior Brexit Minister Walker that the UK and EU are nearing an agreement on the implementation length of transition. Eur/Usd meanwhile has rebounded over 1.2300 after losing the handle on dovish sounding ECB rhetoric from Smets (inflation still below target and may take longer to get there given length of time to close output gap), but did not challenge a 1.2330 option expiry (1 bn) or its 30 DMA at 1.2346 on the upside, and equally a 1.2275 strike in the same size and 1.2266 Fib were left unscathed on the downside. In terms of the DXY, 90.000 and above is proving tough to sustain as the Dollar is only holding gains vs the Cad in the majors (around 1.2825) and Mxn (niggling NAFTA issues). Elsewhere, Eur/Nok is just sitting above post-Norwegian inflation target cut lows around 9.5600 ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s Norges Bank policy meeting and after the PM pledged budget restraint to curb Krona strength.</p>\r\n",

Conversely, Gilts have dipped to a marginal new Liffe low at 121.19, -5 ticks vs +13 ticks at best, and despite market polls looking for a low DMO remit as a result of tomorrow&rsquo;s Spring Budget.

        "content": "<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> March 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>DAX outperforms amid multi-billion revamp in German utility sector.</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>USD-index hovers around 90, having trimmed earlier losses.</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Looking ahead, highlights include the Eurogroup meeting, 3- and 10-year note auctions from the US</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asia stocks were higher across the board as the region took its first opportunity to react to Friday&rsquo;s rally on Wall St and jobs data from US where NFP smashed expectations, but wage growth slowed which in turn provided a goldilocks backdrop for stocks. ASX 200 (+0.6%) was led by commodity names after crude rallied over 3% on Friday and PM Turnbull confirmed Australia is to be exempted from US tariffs. Nikkei 225 (+1.6%) outperformed but closed off its best levels as the cronyism scandal continued to haunt PM Abe after Japan&rsquo;s Finance Ministry confirmed documents had been doctored in a land-sale to a school operator which allegedly used ties to PM Abe&rsquo;s wife to get a cheap deal on state-owned land. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) also gained although the mainland got off to a slow start as US-China trade war concerns somewhat lingered and as participants also mulled over Xi&rsquo;s power consolidation after China&rsquo;s legislature voted to formally scrap presidential term limits from its constitution. Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand constrained amid the heightened appetite for risk, while the BoJ were also in the market but kept its Rinban amounts unchanged from the prior. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 40bln via 28-day reverse repos. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3333 (Prev. 6.3451)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese Finance Minister Aso is under pressure to resign over a report regarding alleged favours to a school with connections to the Japanese PM Abe. The prime minister told parliament in February last year that he&rsquo;d resign if any link emerges between himself or his wife Akie and the land deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian PM Turnbull confirmed that Australia is to be exempt from US Steel and aluminium tariffs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea reportedly wants a peace treaty and to build ties with US, while its leader Kim also wants a US embassy in Pyongyang. (Dong A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK and EU companies reportedly could face an additional GBP 58bln in annual costs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK consumer spending suffered its weakest start to the year since 2012, according to data compiled by Visa. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European cash open mimicked the strong positive sentiment seen in Asia and on Wall St. on Friday following US NFP data beating expectations but wage growth slowing down providing a goldilocks backdrop for stocks. Major bourses are in the green (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.45%) with the exception of the FTSE 100 underperforming weighed down by a strong sterling. DAX 30 is supported by the utilities sector outperforming following reports of RWE (+8.8%) agreeing to swap control of Innogy (+12.9%) for renewable assets with rival E.ON (+5.4%). E.ON has agreed to purchase Innogy from RWE as part of a deal valuing at EUR 20bln, marking one of the largest shake-ups of the European power supply market. This could however place doubt on the deal between Innogy&rsquo;s Npower and UK listed SSE (-2.2%). Following months of attempted takeover, Melrose (-2.9%) has submitted their final offer to engineering group GKN (+0.8%) of GBP 8.1bln following their previous offer of GBP 7.4bln which GKN described as &ldquo;fundamentally&rdquo; undervaluing its business and the approach as &ldquo;entirely opportunistic&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A relatively quiet start to the week, but the Greenback is weaker vs all G10 counterparts bar the Loonie, as Usd/Cad hovers above 1.2800 after last Friday&rsquo;s mixed US and Canadian jobs data (to recap, the former blew away forecasts at 300k+, but latter just missed and would have been negative without part-time workers). The Kiwi is outperforming amidst equity market gains and mostly risk-on trade as it regains 0.7300 status vs the Usd, but Usd/Jpy has pulled back from marginal 107.00+ highs post-NFP to around 106.50 on the land sale scandal involving PM Abe and Finance Minister Aso. Note also, tech resistance around the 21 DMA at 106.79 is capping the pair, but hefty option expiries at 107.00 run off this Thursday and could keep the headline afloat. Aud another relative gainer and firmer within a 0.7845-80 range as Australia negotiates a security deal with the US to avoid aluminium and steel tariffs. Usd/Chf is probing back below 0.9500, Eur/Usd is sitting in a tight band above 1.2300 and Cable is holding between 1.3850-80 ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s UK Budget. Back to option expiries, but for today there is 1 bn either side of 1.2300 in Eur/Usd at 1.2275 and 1.2330 and just over 300 mn in Nzd/Usd at 0.7300.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s still relatively low-key, but core bonds have inched a bit higher in recent trade, with Bunds rising to 157.17 (+19 ticks vs -7 ticks at the early Eurex low) and Gilts reaching 121.37 at one stage (+13 ticks vs flat at the Liffe intraday base).

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: European equities follow the lead from Asia and Wall St. after a goldilocks backdrop is set for stocks",
        "content": "<p>European cash open mimicked the strong positive sentiment seen in Asia and on Wall St. on Friday following US NFP data beating expectations but wage growth slowing down providing a goldilocks backdrop for stocks. Major bourses are firmly in the green with the exception of the FTSE 100 underperforming weighed down by a strong sterling. DAX 30 is supported by the utilities sector outperforming following reports of RWE (+8.8%) agreeing to swap control of Innogy (+12.9%) for renewable assets with rival E.ON (+5.4%). E.ON has agreed to purchase Innogy from RWE as part of a deal valuing at EUR 20bln, marking one of the largest shake-ups of the European power supply market. This could however place doubt on the deal between Innogy&rsquo;s Npower and UK listed SSE (-2.2%). Following months of attempted takeover, Melrose (-2.9%) has submitted their final offer to engineering group GKN (+0.8%) of GBP 8.1bln following their previous offer of GBP 7.4bln which GKN described as &ldquo;fundamentally&rdquo; undervaluing its business and the approach as &ldquo;entirely opportunistic&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A relatively quiet start to the week, but the Greenback is weaker vs all G10 counterparts bar the Loonie, as Usd/Cad hovers above 1.2800 after last Friday&rsquo;s mixed US and Canadian jobs data (to recap, the former blew away forecasts at 300k+, but latter just missed and would have been negative without part-time workers). The Kiwi is outperforming amidst equity market gains and mostly risk-on trade as it regains 0.7300 status vs the Usd, but Usd/Jpy has pulled back from marginal 107.00+ highs post-NFP to around 106.50 on the land sale scandal involving PM Abe and Finance Minister Aso. Note also, tech resistance around the 21 DMA at 106.79 is capping the pair, but hefty option expiries at 107.00 run off this Thursday and could keep the headline afloat. Aud another relative gainer and firmer within a 0.7845-80 range as Australia negotiates a security deal with the US to avoid aluminium and steel tariffs. Usd/Chf is probing back below 0.9500, Eur/Usd is sitting in a tight band above 1.2300 and Cable is holding between 1.3850-80 ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s UK Budget. Back to option expiries, but for today there is 1 bn either side of 1.2300 in Eur/Usd at 1.2275 and 1.2330 and just over 300 mn in Nzd/Usd at 0.7300.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s still relatively low-key, but core bonds have inched a bit higher in recent trade, with Bunds rising to 157.17 (+19 ticks vs -7 ticks at the early Eurex low) and Gilts reaching 121.37 at one stage (+13 ticks vs flat at the Liffe intraday base). Looking at the charts, the 10 year German debt future will be eyeing last Friday&rsquo;s high at 157.25 next, and market contacts flag 157.36 as another upside objective before the mtd peak at 157.69 after that.

The Kiwi is outperforming amidst equity market gains and mostly risk-on trade as it regains 0.7300 status vs the Usd, but Usd/Jpy has pulled back from marginal 107.00+ highs post-NFP to sub-106.50 on the land sale scandal involving PM Abe and Finance Minister Aso. Note also, tech resistance around the 21 DMA at 106.79 is capping the pair, but hefty option expiries at 107.00 run off this Thursday and could keep the headline afloat. Aud another relative gainer and firmer within a 0.7845-80 range as Australia negotiates a security deal with the US to avoid aluminium and steel tariffs. Usd/Chf is probing back below 0.9500, Eur/Usd is sitting in a tight band above 1.2300 and Cable is holding between 1.3850-80 ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s UK Budget. Back to option expiries, but for today there is 1 bn either side of 1.2300 in Eur/Usd at 1.2275 and 1.2330 and just over 300 mn in Nzd/Usd at 0.7300. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) was led by commodity names after crude rallied over 3% on Friday and PM Turnbull confirmed Australia is to be exempted from US tariffs. Nikkei 225 (+1.6%) outperformed but closed off its best levels as the cronyism scandal continued to haunt PM Abe after Japan&rsquo;s Finance Ministry confirmed documents had been doctored in a land-sale to a school operator which allegedly used ties to PM Abe&rsquo;s wife to get a cheap deal on state-owned land. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) also gained although the mainland got off to a slow start as US-China trade war concerns somewhat lingered and as participants also mulled over Xi&rsquo;s power consolidation after China&rsquo;s legislature voted to formally scrap presidential term limits from its constitution. Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand constrained amid the heightened appetite for risk, while the BoJ were also in the market but kept its Rinban amounts unchanged from the prior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 40bln via 28-day reverse repos. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3333 (Prev. 6.3451)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese Finance Minister Aso is under pressure to resign over a report regarding alleged favours to a school with connections to the Japanese PM Abe. The prime minister told parliament in February last year that he&rsquo;d resign if any link emerges between himself or his wife Akie and the land deal.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were choppy with initial support seen amid the heightened risk-appetite, although upside was later pared as the land-sale scandal led to calls for Finance Minister Aso to resign and threatened PM Abe&rsquo;s approval ratings which could also dampen his prospects to head the LDP for a third term. Elsewhere, antipodeans were underpinned with AUD lifted by recent gains in crude and Australia&rsquo;s exemption from Trump tariffs, while NZD/USD led the advances after it reclaimed the 0.7300 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were quiet overnight with WTI crude futures taking a breather after last Friday&rsquo;s 3% rally to above the USD 62/bbl as risk appetite was spurred post-NFP jobs data. Elsewhere, gold traded flat amid similar price action for the greenback, while copper was also range-bound and failed to benefit from the risk tone amid fatigue from Friday&rsquo;s advances and as Chinese metal prices were remain pressured from Trump tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count (9 Mar) 984 (Prev. 981).

(WSJ) There were also reports that Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh stated that OPEC could agree in June to begin relaxing oil output cuts for 2019.

Perhaps the most interesting thing about the treasury complex was that, despite equity traders seeing the dovish side of the employment report, the bond traders didn&rsquo;t entirely agree, and the March T-Note futured settled around 4 ticks lower than pre-NFP levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Bullard (Non-voter, Dove) reiterated that 4 hikes this year could slow the economy.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks were higher across the board as the region took its first opportunity to react to Friday&rsquo;s rally on Wall St and jobs data from US where NFP smashed expectations, but wage growth slowed which in turn provided a goldilocks backdrop for stocks. ASX 200 (+0.6%) was led by commodity names after crude rallied over 3% on Friday and PM Turnbull confirmed Australia is to be exempted from US tariffs. Nikkei 225 (+1.6%) outperformed but closed off its best levels as the cronyism scandal continued to haunt PM Abe after Japan&rsquo;s Finance Ministry confirmed documents had been doctored in a land-sale to a school operator which allegedly used ties to PM Abe&rsquo;s wife to get a cheap deal on state-owned land. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) also gained although the mainland got off to a slow start as US-China trade war concerns somewhat lingered and as participants also mulled over Xi&rsquo;s power consolidation after China&rsquo;s legislature voted to formally scrap presidential term limits from its constitution. Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand constrained amid the heightened appetite for risk, while the BoJ were also in the market but kept its Rinban amounts unchanged from the prior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD was subdued in which the DXY just about held above the 90.00 level following last Friday&rsquo;s jobs data as the weaker wage growth eased concerns of rising inflation. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were choppy with initial support seen amid the heightened risk-appetite, although upside was later pared as the land-sale scandal led to calls for Finance Minister Aso to resign and threatened PM Abe&rsquo;s approval ratings which could also dampen his prospects to head the LDP for a third term. Elsewhere, antipodeans were underpinned with AUD lifted by recent gains in crude and Australia&rsquo;s exemption from Trump tariffs, while NZD/USD led the advances after it reclaimed the 0.7300 handle.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are higher across the board as region takes its first opportunity to react to Friday&rsquo;s rally on Wall St and jobs data from US where NFP smashed expectations but wage growth slowed, which in turn provided a goldilocks backdrop for stocks. ASX 200 (+0.8%) was led by commodity names after crude rallied over 3% on Friday and PM Turnbull confirmed Australia is to be exempted from recently imposed US tariffs. Nikkei 225 (+1.7%) outperforms but is off its best levels as the cronyism scandal continues to haunt PM Abe after Japan&rsquo;s Finance Ministry confirmed documents had been doctored in a land-sale to a school operator which allegedly used ties to PM Abe&rsquo;s wife to get a cheap deal on state-owned land. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) are also higher, but with the mainland slightly lagging as US-China trade war concerns somewhat linger and with participants also mulling over Xi&rsquo;s power consolidation after China&rsquo;s legislature voted to formally scrap presidential term limits from its constitution with only 2 dissenters among 2964 votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD is subdued with the DXY just about holding above the 90.00 level following last Friday&rsquo;s jobs data as the weaker wage growth eased concerns of rising inflation. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were choppy with initial support seen amid the heightened risk-appetite, although upside was later pared as the land-sale scandal threatened PM Abe&rsquo;s approval ratings and could dampen prospects to head the LDP for a third term. Antipodeans outperform with AUD lifted by recent gains in crude and Australia&rsquo;s exemption from Trump tariffs, while NZD/USD leads the advances on a reclaim of the 0.7300 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand subdued by an appetite for risk, while the BoJ also kept its Rinban amounts unchanged from the prior. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
