Dentsply Sirona (XRAY) fell almost 20% today after it cut its FY18 Adj. EPS forecasts, however revenues and EPS were in line with expectations. Disney (DIS) are expected to report 5 minutes after the closing bell, EPS expected at $1.95 and revenues are expected at $15.34bln. Elsewhere, Tesla (TSLA) jumped to fresh session highs after the FT reported that a Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund took a USD 2bln stake in the electric vehicle maker. Shortly after this move, Elon Musk tweeted he is considering taking the company private at $420, and said the funding was secured. This was followed by a serious of replies on Twitter from Musk where he stated he plans to remain the CEO and later tweeted &ldquo;Investor support has been confirmed, only reason why this is not certain is that it&rsquo;s contingent on a shareholder vote.&rdquo; Tesla outperformed in the NDX and was competing with the number one spot; BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) were also higher after Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) phase 1/2 trial response came in at only 30%, which saw the stock drop. BMRN previously reported its phase 1/2 trial evaluating gene therapy for Haemophilia A which reduced bleed rates by 97%. SPX +0.28% at 2858, NDX +0.32% at 7463, DJI at +0.5% at 25629.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were lower for the session amid an improvement in the risk-tone. Most of the selling action was in the belly of the curve where 5yr yield was up by c.4bps whilst yields at the front and end of the curve were higher by c.3bps. The US sold $34bln in 3yr notes, tailing for the fifth consecutive time, by 0.2bps (in line with recent averages) at a high yield of 2.765%, the highest yield at a 3s auction since May 2007. Overall an unpleasant auction, analysts said: cover was softer than recent averages, and internals were also non-eventful, indirects took the smallest share since December 2016, directs took the smallest portion and dealers were left with the highest share also since December 2016. US 10YR T-notes settled 8+ ticks lower at 119-15.</p>\r\n",

The news followed reports that European countries will try to preserve the Iran deal and pledged to protect firms against the impact of US sanctions for doing business with Iran. US National Adviser Bolton on Tuesday said the US is looking at imposing further sanctions which are &quot;very real&quot;, adding that waivers from sanctions in Iran will be rare.&nbsp; Elsewhere, Bolton said that North Korea has not taken the necessary steps towards de-nuclearisation and that relaxing North Korean sanctions is not being considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT</strong>: The UK is said to see Brexit deal deadline being pushed back to November, from October, according to reports, as the UK believes that the EU wants a united front in case US President Trump disrupts the G-20 meeting. PM May is said to be resisting the EU&rsquo;s timetable for talks, and is said to believe that Trump may in fact help her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE SPEAK</strong>: BoE&rsquo;s McCafferty (Hawk) said to start seeing rising inflationary pressures and that it is a reasonable rule of thumb to expect a couple smaller interest rate hikes over the next couple of years, very similar to Governor Carney&rsquo;s comments on Friday. Note he is leaving the BoE in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US JOLTS</strong> rose in June to 6.662mln from the previous 6.638mln, beating the expectations of 6.646mln, hitting the highest second level since 2000. Overall the latest release indicates demand for jobs remains strong; the FT noted &ldquo;solid hiring by US employers has failed to spur growth in annual wages and prompted debate over whether the Federal Reserve needs to tread carefully as it continues to tighten monetary policy.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.28% at 2858 , NDX +0.32% at 7463, DJI at +0.5% at 25629</strong>. SECTORS: Energy +0.7%, Materials +0.3%, Industrials +0.7%, Cons Discretionary +0.4%, Cons Staples -0.6%, Healthcare 0.00%, Financials +0.5%, Tech +0.3%, Telecoms +0.4%, Utilities -0.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> As earnings season starts to slow, AMC yesterday we had earnings from Marriot (MAR) which beat on EPS, but the miss on revenues saw the stock fall over 3%. Dentsply Sirona (XRAY) fell almost 20% today after it cut its FY18 Adj. EPS forecasts, however revenues and EPS were in line with expectations. Disney (DIS) are expected to report 5 minutes after the closing bell, EPS expected at $1.95 and revenues are expected at $15.34bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Tesla (TSLA) jumped to fresh session highs after the FT reported that a Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund took a USD 2bln stake in the electric vehicle maker. Shortly after this move, Elon Musk tweeted he is considering taking the company private at $420, and said the funding was secured. This was followed by a serious of replies on Twitter from Musk where he stated he plans to remain the CEO. Shares were halted in the latter part of the session before a statement was released regarding his reasoning behind the plan to go private, he noted a final decision has not been made, the plan is not to merge TSLA with SpaceX, and the structure of the change would provide shareholders with a choice. He then tweeted &ldquo;Investor support has been confirmed, only reason why this is not certain is that it&rsquo;s contingent on a shareholder vote.&rdquo; Tesla outperformed in the NDX and was competing with the number one spot; BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) were also higher after Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) phase 1/2 trial response came in at only 30%, which saw the stock drop. BMRN previously reported its phase 1/2 trial evaluating gene therapy for Haemophilia A which reduced bleed rates by 97%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A:</strong> Carl Icahn again urged Cigna (CI) shareholders to vote against the takeover of Express Scripts (ESRX), saying they are overpaying and ESRX face existential risks on several fronts. Also, AT&amp;T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) came under scrutiny from the US anti-trust regulators, who are opposed to the approval of the merger, and stated the court is against &lsquo;common sense&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U8) SETTLE $0.16 HIGHER AT $69.17; BRENT (V8) SETTLES $0.90 HIGHER AT $74.65</strong>. Both Brent and WTI were trading higher, with traders continuing to cite reports from last week suggesting Saudi output is set to decline in July (the official OPEC report is released on Monday). Traders were also pointing to the overnight news that the yuan-denominated crude contract in Shanghai hit its daily limit up on &ldquo;speculation&rdquo;. The EIA cut world demand growth forecast (2018 trimmed by 60k BPD, and 2019 cut by 140k BPD) though it kept its US oil demand forecast unchanged. In terms of production, however, US crude production is set to rise by 1.02mln BPD next year to 11.8mln, it said. After the bell, the API will report weekly inventories, and the street looks for a draw of 3.3mln for headline crude, distillates are seen building 200k, gasoline is seen drawing 1.7mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE 8+ TICKS LOWER AT 119-15:</strong> Treasuries were lower for the session amid an improvement in the risk-tone. Most of the selling action was in the belly of the curve where 5yr yield was up by c.4bps whilst yields at the front and end of the curve were higher by c.3bps. The US sold $34bln in 3yr notes, tailing for the fifth consecutive time, by 0.2bps (in line with recent averages) at a high yield of 2.765%, the highest yield at a 3s auction since May 2007. Overall an unpleasant auction, analysts said: cover was softer than recent averages, and internals were also non-eventful, indirects took the smallest share since December 2016, directs took the smallest portion and dealers were left with the highest share also since December 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10-YEAR NOTE PREVIEW</strong>: The US Treasury will auction a total of USD 78bln in 3-year (USD 34bln, Tuesday), 10-year (USD 26bln, Wednesday) and 30-year (USD 18bln, Thursday), all to settle on 15 August; analysts at TD Securities note that USD38.2bln matures at the mid-month settlement, implying net supply of USD 33.8bln in new cash. TD also points out that USD 23.1bn matures on the Fed&#39;s balance sheet, and the Fed will allow USD 12.6bn to run-off, reinvesting USD 10.5bn, which will add-on USD 4.6bn to 3s, USD 3.5bn to the 10s, and USD 2.4bn to 30s. It is also worth noting that this series of auctions has a higher issuance amount, per the August refunding, though TD Securities believe that the drift higher in yields is likely to support demand. Analysts at Societe Generale note that outright 10-year yields are cheaper (at the time of writing) than July&rsquo;s high yield rate, which should provide support. SocGen says, however, that some concession will be needed in order to account for the increased auction size, and the resumption of Treasury curve flattening. The auction may benefit from short covering demand from speculators, who are at a record net short in 10y futures, SocGen say, and in addition, the last 10-year auction stopped through, with a sharp increase in investment fund participation, which SocGen says is a positive for Wednesday&rsquo;s auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The index has retreated a bit further from recent peaks after another failure to build on gains above 95.500 and seriously test the 96.656 ytd peak, with a brief dip below 95.000 amidst widespread declines vs G10 peers and EM counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* LIRA, YUAN:</strong> The TRY has pared a chunk of its losses vs the USD after Monday&rsquo;s mauling and plunge to fresh record lows above ~5.35, albeit after another roller-coaster ride ahead of a Turkish delegation to the US to discuss relations. The Lira is off recovery highs, but around 5.25, while the CNY and CNH have also bounced further from worst levels on visibly/audibly less verbal cross-fire on tariffs between China and the US. Yuan sentiment also aided by latest Chinese foreign currency reserves data showing a bit more firepower to prop up the Renminbi, if desired, as the PBoC eased the mid-point fixing, albeit marginally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Notwithstanding more neutral-dovish policy guidance from the RBA suggesting on hold beyond the current 2-year hiatus, the AUD gleaned the most from stability and or recoveries in EM FX to consolidate and build on gains over 0.7400, reaching 0.7439 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency has gradually emerged as the next best G10, regaining 1.1600 vs the Greenback, but not quite testing resistance at a 1.1629 Fib before losing momentum and slipping back below that level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF:</strong> Both around 0.2-0.25% ahead vs the Dollar, but still rangy, with USDJPY not threatening bids at 111.00 for too long, or supply at 111.50, while the Franc pulled a bit further away from lows close to parity and back around 0.9950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, CAD:</strong> The Kiwi continues to struggle above 0.6750 where a circa 475mn option expiry ran off at the NY cut, and in the face of headwinds from the AUDNZD cross that rose through 1.1000 and a key technical resistance level at 1.11025 (which would be bullish from a chart perspective if sustained, but the RBNZ may provide some fundamental input on Thursday). Note, an underwhelming GDT auction hardly impacted even though futures suggested that WMP prices could rise 1% vs merely 0.1%. USDCAD respected its 100 DMA at 1.2961 to grind back up above 1.3000 as the Buck regained a degree of composure and Canada&rsquo;s IVEY PMIs pulled up from previous levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling suffered more Brexit-related woes with reports suggesting PM May is under pressure from Tory activists and could seek a longer deadline for EU negotiations to November from the end of October. Cable held just off yesterday&rsquo;s fresh 2018 lows, around 1.2950 for the most part, while EURGBP hovering around 0.8950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The US Treasury will auction a total of USD 78bln in 3-year (USD 34bln, Tuesday), 10-year (USD 26bln, Wednesday) and 30-year (USD 18bln, Thursday), all to settle on 15 August; analysts at TD Securities note that USD38.2bln matures at the mid-month settlement, implying net supply of USD 33.8bln in new cash. TD also points out that USD 23.1bn matures on the Fed&#39;s balance sheet, and the Fed will allow USD 12.6bn to run-off, reinvesting USD 10.5bn, which will add-on USD 4.6bn to 3s, USD 3.5bn to the 10s, and USD 2.4bn to 30s. It is also worth noting that this series of auctions has a higher issuance amount, per the August refunding, though TD Securities believe that the drift higher in yields is likely to support demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 3s, analysts at Barclays note that the sector saw healthy demand at the beginning of the year, but that has moderated, and the monthly bid-cover ratio fell from 3.1x in January to 2.5x at the July auction, with demand at 3-year the softest of all the tenors. In terms of participation, broker/dealer takedown has been edging up in 2018 at 3-year auctions, rising from 36% in January to 54% in July, which Barclays says is a function of smaller participation by investment funds. Barclays says that the 3-year WI roll is slightly rich when compared with previous auction cycles, given the larger add-ons (USD 4.6bn) and increased size at the upcoming auction. It also suggests that current on-the-run 3s trade slightly rich when compared to older 3s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Results will be published after 1800 BST/1300 EST on 7 August.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index has retreated a bit further from recent peaks after another failure to build on gains above 95.500 and seriously test the 96.656 ytd peak, with a brief dip below 95.000 amidst widespread declines vs G10 peers and EM counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LIRA/YUAN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Try has pared a chunk of its losses vs the Usd after Monday&rsquo;s mauling and plunge to fresh record lows circa 5.4250, albeit after another roller-coaster ride ahead of a Turkish delegation to the US to discuss relations. The Lira is off recovery highs, but around 5.3000, while the Cny and Cnh have also bounced further from worst levels on visibly/audibly less verbal cross-fire on tariffs between China and the US. Yuan sentiment also aided by latest Chinese foreign currency reserves data showing a bit more firepower to prop up the Renminbi, if desired, as the PBoC eased the mid-point fixing, albeit marginally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding more neutral-dovish policy guidance from the RBA suggesting on hold beyond the current 2 year hiatus, the Aud gleaned the most from stability and or recoveries in EM FX to consolidate and build on gains over 0.7400, reaching 0.7439 at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has gradually emerged as the next best G10, regaining 1.1600 vs the Greenback, but not quite testing resistance at a 1.1629 Fib before losing momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both around 0.2-0.25% ahead vs the Dollar, but still rangy, with Usd/Jpy not threatening bids at 111.00 for too long, or supply at 111.50, while the Franc pulled a bit further away from lows close to parity and back under 0.9950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi continues to struggle above 0.6750 where a circa 475mn option expiry ran off at the NY cut, and in the face of headwinds from the Aud/Nzd cross that rose through 1.1000 and a key technical resistance level at 1.11025 (which would be bullish from a chart perspective if sustained, but the RBNZ may provide some fundamental input on Thursday). Note, an underwhelming GDT auction hardly impacted even though futures suggested that WMP prices could rise 1% vs merely 0.1%. Usd/Cad respected its 100 DMA at 1.2961 to grind back up towards 1.3000 as the Buck regained a degree of composure and Canada&rsquo;s IVEY PMIs pulled up from previous levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling suffered more Brexit-related woes with reports suggesting PM May is under pressure from Tory activists and could seek a longer deadline for EU negotiations to November from the end of October. Cable held just off yesterday&rsquo;s fresh 2018 lows, but sub-1.2950 for the most part, while Eur/Gbp advanced further above 0.8950.</p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) was higher as focus remained on earnings with SoftBank and Rakuten among the top gainers in the index after both reported solid profit growth, while ASX 200 (-0.3%) lagged its regional peers with the index dragged by weakness in telecoms and miners. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.7%) were positive with property developers underpinned by strong guidance including Country Garden and Evergrande Real Estate, although price action was far from smooth with a bout of intraday volatility in Chinese bourses after the PBoC continued to withhold from liquidity operations and amid lingering trade uncertainty. Finally, 10yr JGBs were little changed with only minimal losses seen amid gains in stocks and as the Japanese 10yr yield remained above 0.11%, while participants the 10yr inflation-indexed bond auction also failed to spur demand as b/c and lowest accepted price declined from prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations and are net neutral on the day.

Civil servants have been ordered to compile 70 &ldquo;technical notices&rdquo; by month-end to explain to businesses how to prepare for no-deal scenario.

Broad-based gains are seen across all sectors while the energy sector outperforms on oil price action. In terms of notable European earnings, Commerzbank (-2.0%) shares are lower post-results as the bank slightly adjusted their outlook due to &ldquo;intense competition&rdquo;, while Denmark&rsquo;s Pandora (-16.5%) rests at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following a guidance cut. US earnings to look out for today include Emerson Electric (06:30 EDT), PPL Corp (07:40 EDT) and Walt Disney (16:05 EDT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - The clear G10 front-runner on several supportive factors, as Aud/Usd regains a firmer foothold above 0.7400 to print a marginal new August high (0.7437) having held in above chart support in the interim, and the Aud/Nzd cross trades above 1.1000 to expose 1.1025 resistance again.

Broad-based gains are seen across all sectors while the energy sector outperforms on oil price action. In terms of notable European earnings, Commerzbank (-1.8%) shares are lower post-results as the bank slightly adjusted their outlook due to &ldquo;intense competition&rdquo;, while Pandora (-18.4%) rests at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 following a guidance cut. On the flip side, Swiss listed OC Oerlikon (+9.6%) rose to the top of the European index after upgrading guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - The clear G10 front-runner on several supportive factors, as Aud/Usd regains a firmer foothold above 0.7400 to print a marginal new August high (0.7435) having held in above chart support in the interim, and the Aud/Nzd cross trades above 1.1000 to expose 1.1025 resistance again. No lasting drag on the Aud from the latest RBA policy meeting and statement that was essentially a repeat of the previous version and several before that, with the ongoing mantra that rates are appropriate at current levels and are likely to remain apt for some time to come given the slow evolution of inflation and wage growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/EUR - The Loonie is next best major performer vs the Usd, albeit only just eclipsing the single currency and Kiwi as the Greenback loses some momentum across the board (DXY around 95.200 vs 95.500+ yesterday) EMs also off recent lows). Usd/Cad is back below 1.3000 and eyeing strong support at 1.2961 (100 DMA) before 1.2950, while Eur/Usd has bounced a bit further from Monday&rsquo;s 1.1530 multi-week base towards 1.1600, but not quite testing the big figure, yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/JPY - All marginally firmer vs the Dollar, with Cable back above 1.2950 having hit new lows for 2018 on Monday circa 1.2915, but the Pound not faring so well vs the Eur (0.8930+) amidst yet more Conservative Party rebellion against UK PM May and her Chequers White Paper. Usd/Chf remains above 0.9950, but easing back from near parity, while Usd/Jpy is still rangebound just under 111.50 between 111.45-25 after reports that the BoJ talked about tightening rates twice before the end of the year, according to people supposedly in the know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - As noted, some respite for regional currencies after a dip in the Cny mid-point fixing and more efforts by Turkey to arrest the Lira&rsquo;s slide alongside reports that mediation with the US has been successful to a degree.

As mentioned earlier, thin holiday and seasonal trading conditions are impacting price volatility and chart levels are also exerting some directional influence with Bunds and Gilts both conscious of strong resistance (162.47 and 123.39). Elsewhere, US Treasuries are slipping alongside their EU equivalents, but also in preparation by way of some concession for this week&rsquo;s supply that kicks off with $34 bn 3 year notes and cumulatively represents a larger net issuance total than the previous auctions of 3, 10 and 30 year paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent are showing mild gains as the futures hold onto the USD 69.00/bbl and USD 74.00/bbl handles respectively.

As mentioned earlier, thin holiday and seasonal trading conditions are impacting price volatility and chart levels are also exerting some directional influence with Bunds and Gilts both conscious of strong resistance (162.47 and 123.39). Elsewhere, US Treasuries are slipping alongside their EU equivalents, but also in preparation by way of some concession for this week&rsquo;s supply that kicks off with $34 bn 3 year notes and cumulatively represents a larger net issuance total than the previous auctions of 3, 10 and 30 year paper.</p>\r\n",

No lasting drag on the Aud from the latest RBA policy meeting and statement that was essentially a repeat of the previous version and several before that, with the ongoing mantra that rates are appropriate at current levels and are likely to remain apt for some time to come given the slow evolution of inflation and wage growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie is next best major performer vs the Usd, albeit only just eclipsing the single currency and Kiwi as the Greenback loses some momentum across the board (DXY around 95.200 vs 95.500+ yesterday) EMs also off recent lows). Usd/Cad is back below 1.3000 and eyeing strong support at 1.2961 (100 DMA) before 1.2950, while Eur/Usd has bounced a bit further from Monday&rsquo;s 1.1530 multi-week base towards 1.1600, but not quite testing the big figure, yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All marginally firmer vs the Dollar, with Cable back above 1.2950 having hit new lows for 2018 on Monday circa 1.2915, but the Pound not faring so well vs the Eur (0.8930+) amidst yet more Conservative Party rebellion against UK PM May and her Chequers White Paper. Usd/Chf remains above 0.9950, but easing back from near parity, while Usd/Jpy is still rangebound just under 111.50 between 111.45-25 after reports that the BoJ talked about tightening rates twice before the end of the year, according to people supposedly in the know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted, some respite for regional currencies after a dip in the Cny mid-point fixing and more efforts by Turkey to arrest the Lira&rsquo;s slide alongside reports that mediation with the US has been successful to a degree.

Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) was higher as focus remained on earnings with SoftBank and Rakuten among the top gainers in the index after both reported solid profit growth, while ASX 200 (-0.3%) lagged its regional peers with the index dragged by weakness in telecoms and miners. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.4%) were positive with property developers underpinned by strong guidance including Country Garden and Evergrande Real Estate, although price action was far from smooth with a bout of intraday volatility in Chinese bourses after the PBoC continued to withhold from liquidity operations and amid lingering trade uncertainty. Finally, 10yr JGBs were little changed with only minimal losses seen amid gains in stocks and as the Japanese 10yr yield remained above 0.11%, while participants the 10yr inflation-indexed bond auction also failed to spur demand as b/c and lowest accepted price declined from prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations and are net neutral on the day.

(BuzzFeed/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May has been blamed for the disorganised preparations for a no-deal Brexit as businesses need to be advised on how to get ready for the possibility. Civil servants have been ordered to compile 70 &ldquo;technical notices&rdquo; by month-end to explain to businesses how to prepare for no-deal scenario. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Police leaders have warned a no-deal Brexit is posing a risk to the public as the UK would lose access to EU-wide security powers and databases.

According to recent reports, discussions suggested PM May is losing support due to her Chequers plan and some see her departure as essential to salvaging the Brexit, although these reports cited Conservative Party activists. Elsewhere, AUD/USD was steady heading into the RBA rate decision - which proved to be a non-event - before moving higher to test 0.7400, while TRY went on a roller-coaster ride in which it initially extended on its record lows with another 7% decline before paring some of the losses on reports US and Turkey reached a pre-agreement on certain issues and with a delegation of Turkish officials planning to visit the US in 2 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA kept Cash Rate Target unchanged at record low 1.50% as expected and reiterated that it judged steady policy was consistent with growth and inflation targets, while it RBA repeated that low rates are supporting the economy. RBA also stated that wage growth remains subdued which is likely to continue for a while and that it sees headline CPI to be lower than expected this year. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities saw mild gains overnight in which WTI crude and Brent crude futures just about reclaimed the USD 69.00/bbl level and USD 74.00/bbl to the upside respectively, although price action was extremely light and oblivious to Chinese crude futures hitting limit up or the US re-imposing the first wave of Iranian sanctions which will cover the auto sector, gold and key metals, while crude sanctions are not anticipated until November. Elsewhere, gold and copper prices were marginally higher as prices nursed some of the prior day&rsquo;s losses, although upside was capped as the greenback held on to recent gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BHP is said to seek a 5-day mediation by Chile government in contract discussions to avoid a strike at the Escondida copper mine, while there were also reports the union at Chile&#39;s Escondida copper mine was preparing a strike contingency plan as it awaited the final response from the Co.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian President Rouhani said Iran is open to negotiations as long as the US is sincere, while he added that talks alongside sanctions are meaningless and that the US must prove it is willing to solve problems through talks. Furthermore, Rouhani commented that practical actions are required from the EU to save the JCPOA and also warned the US will regret placing sanctions on Iran. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries remained in a tight range on Monday amid thin volumes across the complex, as the dog days of summer set in. Yields were mixed across the curve, but ultimately, close to the unchanged mark. The US Treasury will auction a total of USD 78bln in 3-year (USD 34bln, Tuesday), 10-year (USD 26bln, Wednesday) and 30-year (USD 18bln, Thursday), all to settle on 15 August; analysts at TD Securities note that USD38.2bln matures at the mid-month settlement, implying net supply of USD 33.8bln in new cash.</p>\r\n",

This is reflected in ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures which price in 100% expectations for no change in rates and with its associated implied yield curve suggesting August 2019 as the earliest date for a hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RBA hasn&#39;t provided any fresh rhetoric to change the outlook for the central bank since the last meeting, where it continued to reiterate that the board judged it was appropriate to maintain policy, while it also repeated the next rate move is likely to be a hike if economy improves as expected, although it saw no strong case for a near-term change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent economic indicators from Australia would also suggest a lack of urgency to tighten policy considering that headline inflation for Q2 was softer than expected at 2.1% vs. Exp. 2.2% (Prev. 1.9%) and although this still represented the 1st time CPI printed within the RBA&#39;s 2%-3% target range in 10 quarters, some have noted that the soft reading despite higher energy prices provides scope for rates to stay on hold well into next year. Elsewhere, other data releases have generally been encouraging with Employment Change (Jun) 50.9k vs. Exp. 17.0k topping estimates which was mostly fuelled by Full-Time jobs, while the Unemployment Rate was also steady at 5.4% despite a surprise increase in the participation rate. In addition, the latest Retail Sales and Building Approvals data were also better than expected which increases the optimism regarding Q2 GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The announcement is due at 0530BST/2330CDT/1230HKT, although no major fireworks are anticipated from the decision as has been the case for some time, while participants would also be eyeing the statement just in case there is any unexpected deviation from its continuously rehashed statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent comments and Calls<br />- Goldman Sachs pushed back RBA rate hike forecast by 1 year to November 2019 due to slower than anticipated build-up of inflationary pressures and cooldown in property market.<br />- Citi said there is a larger risk for the RBA to remove guidance regarding next direction being a hike, although it added that it sees a high bar for the guidance removal.<br />- NAB noted talk that trade and higher bank funding costs, as well as tighter credit conditions could mean next RBA move could be a cut, while it added investors could begin to price in a cut but that the hurdle for a cut is high.</p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) is higher as focus remains on earnings with SoftBank and Rakuten among the top gainers in the index after both reported solid profit growth, while ASX 200 (-0.4%) lags its regional peers with the index dragged by weakness in telecoms and miners. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) are positive with property developers underpinned by strong guidance including Country Garden and Evergrande Real Estate, although price action is choppy with upside capped after the PBoC continued to withhold from liquidity operations and amid lingering trade uncertainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the major currencies remain uneventful with the DXY sideways above the 95.00 level, while EUR/USD is stuck within the prior day&rsquo;s range and GBP/USD languishes following its slip below 1.3000 amid ongoing Brexit disarray. Recent reports have noted that discussions suggested PM May is losing support due to her Chequers plan and that some see her departure as essential to salvaging the Brexit, although these reports had cited Conservative Party activists. Elsewhere, AUD/USD lacks firm direction heading into the RBA rate decision later and amid tentativeness in China&rsquo;s currency, while TRY has been on a roller-coaster ride in which it initially extended on its record lows with another 7% decline before paring some of the losses on reports US and Turkey reached a pre-agreement on certain issues and with a delegation of Turkish officials planning to visit the US in 2 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are little changed with only minimal losses seen amid gains in stocks and as the Japanese 10yr yield remain above 0.11%, while participants also await a 10yr inflation-indexed bond auction later.</p>\r\n",
