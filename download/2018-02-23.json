        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: Stocks jump in late trade  ",
        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES: NDX +2% at 6897, SPX +1.61% at 2747, DJI +1.4% at 25311</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top sectors: Utilities +2.7%, Energy +2.2%, IT +2.2%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom sectors: +0.8%, Telecom +0.8%, Consumer Staples +1%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ES H8 contract was again in the 2700 to 2730 battleground (50d MA around 2730 in focus), remaining in positive territory throughout the course of the session, with utilities and staples doing a lot of the heavy lifting (all sectors were green). Late in the day, however, ES managed to find some impetus in quiet trade, rising out of that range towards session highs &ndash; with some chatter of a mini short squeeze &ndash; shaking-off the lethargy seen in recent afternoon trade. There wasn&rsquo;t a specific narrative behind Friday&rsquo;s equity gains, with many news outlets attributing the gains to Fed-related headlines, though that seems to be trying fit a narrative around the price action, rather than actually explaining the price action. Perhaps a more convincing explanation was the fall in US yields providing support (some models signal month-end Treasury buying). In stock specific news, HPE jumped after reporting earnings on Thursday, GIS was the laggard after announcing an $8bln deal to buy BUFF; in late trade, news that JWN family members were reportedly near finalising an offer to take the company private added a positive catalyst to equity trading. While stock trading has been choppy this week, ES finishes in the green (very slightly &ndash; and last week&rsquo;s highs haven&rsquo;t been meaningfully tested), though the range has been the narrowest in around six weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Note futures settle 10 ticks higher at 120-23+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Month-end flows were seen supporting the Treasury Complex, and yields were lower across the curve. Some pointed out that index extensions this month are large, which may be contributing to Treasury buying. Some were also attributing Treasury gains to jittery stock markets, although that narrative is challenged by the equity price action, which has hardly screamed &lsquo;panic&rsquo;. The complex will likely take its next cue from Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s testimony to Congress next week; fixed income traders will be looking for clues as to whether the Fed will raise its assessment of long-term rates, which could help the curve steepen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY finishes the week green</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY closes out the week in positive territory, though didn&rsquo;t manage to stay above the 90.00 mark. On Friday the DXY was trading within a range (between c.89.80 to c.90.00, with unsustained breaches on both sides). Where the greenback goes from here will largely depend on the dual testimony of new Fed governor Powell before lawmakers (next Tuesday and Thursday). While analyst chatter is largely focussing on inflation, some are looking for clues as to whether the Fed will likely raise it&rsquo;s longer-term view of where the Federal Funds Rate will peak in the cycle (a higher &lsquo;peak&rsquo; rate will help a steepening of the curve, which may lend to dollar strength, the theory goes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other majors were also trading range-bound, unswayed by central bank speak from the Fed and ECB. GBP mostly looked through Brexit headlines (which again hint at difficulties in negotiations &ndash; next week&rsquo;s Brexit speech from PM May is eyed, as well as EU&rsquo;s Tusk coming to London). There was a mini flash crash in the pound that got some attention in pre-US trade (around 65 pips); although no convincing narrative has been put forward, thin liquidity around the 11am fix was cited, where 700mln GBP was put through on a single platform). Cable is flat just beneath 1.40, though trades with a positive bias vs the EUR (general weak EUR day).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 78 cents higher at $63.55 per barrel; Brent futures settle 92 cents higher at $67.31 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude ends Friday on a firm footing, with CLc1 finishing green for the seventh straight session (according to Rtrs pricing, which differs slightly from daily settlement prices), capping another strong week for the crude complex (second week of gains). Today&rsquo;s theme picks up from Thursday&rsquo;s price action, where OPEC+ commentary was finally corroborated by weekly inventory data, though US production levels and export levels continued to be cautiously eyed by traders. There was further OPEC jawboning today, with Saudi&rsquo;s energy minister once again arguing that oil markets were rebalancing, and he sees inventories continuing to fall through the course of 2018. Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s El Feel oilfield (70k BPD) was shutdown, contributing to the bullish price action.</p>\r\n",

Today&rsquo;s theme picks up from Thursday&rsquo;s price action, where OPEC+ commentary was finally corroborated by weekly inventory data, though US production levels and export levels continued to be cautiously eyed by traders. There was further OPEC jawboning today, with Saudi&rsquo;s energy minister once again arguing that oil markets were rebalancing, and he sees inventories continuing to fall through the course of 2018. Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s El Feel oilfield (70k BPD) was shutdown, contributing to the bullish price action.</p>\r\n",

RBA minutes did not offer any new policy clues, leaving Aud/Usd to back off further from 0.7900, especially after the more hawkish FOMC account of January&rsquo;s policy meet that gave the Greenback the extra push to test chart resistance around 90.500-600. BoE testimony to the TSC essentially underlined the shift in guidance towards somewhat earlier tightening and by somewhat more than anticipated at the November QIR, but Cable struggled to clear 1.4000 (21DMA at 1.4007). ECB minutes reiterated growing confidence in the economic and inflation outlook, but also risks related to Eur strength that implies no change in guidance before March at the earliest, even though some members favoured dropping the easing bias &ndash; Eur/Usd hovering around 1.2300. Riksbank minutes were decidedly cautious/dovish and Eur/Sek spiked as a result, Krona extending losses made on weaker than forecast Swedish inflation data. Usd/Cad down sharply from Thursday&rsquo;s post-weak Canadian retail sales highs (1.2773, fresh 2018 peak) with the immediate spike lower post-firm CPI unable to sustain a move further to the downside in the pair. Nzd undermined by cross buying through 1.0700 vs Aud and testing bids around 0.7300 vs the Usd after strong headline NZ retail sales data, but a less upbeat breakdown.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Ahead of Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s dual-testimony before US lawmakers next week, the Fed&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Report will be released at 11:00 ET on Friday 23 February. Key points to note:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>INFLATION: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Previously, the Fed had categorised inflation weakness as &ldquo;transitory,&rdquo; (in his November confirmation hearing, Powell himself alluded to uncertainty regarding the path of inflation). However, the recent CPI data and average hourly earnings data both point to an acceleration in price pressures. The focus is on how Powell frames the recent firming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- UBS believes Powell will likely project increased confidence that inflation will rise to target this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The Fed&rsquo;s latest guidance (in its 31 January statement) states: &ldquo;On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.&rdquo; Clearly this guidance is now stale in wake of recent developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PACE OF NORMALISATION:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The insertion of the word &ldquo;further&rdquo; in the January statement has been interpreted as a hawkish signal that the Fed could hike rates more than forecast in December (in the December staff economic projections, the Fed pencilled in three hikes in 2018 &ndash; note, those December forecasts may be alluded to in the report, new forecasts are due in March).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- SGH Macro Advisers says a clear majority of the FOMC, including its new Chairman, will want the optionality on the table of a potential fourth rate hike this year. But SGH believes that Powell and most of his Committee colleagues will not want to signal the fourth rate move as a given in either the testimony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The Fed&rsquo;s current guidance (in its 31 January statement) states: &ldquo;The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MARKET VOLATILITY: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The recent market volatility has been attributed to inflationary pressures forcing traders to reprice their expectations of the Fed hiking cycle. After the FOMC&rsquo;s experience of the &lsquo;taper tantrum&rsquo; in 2013, it will be cautious about managing market expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- At his swearing-in ceremony Powell alluded to the recent market volatility, stating that the Fed will &ldquo;remain alert&rdquo; to any financial stability risks presented by market gyrations. Other FOMC members &ndash; Like Kaplan &ndash; have attributed the market moves as &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

Miners were led by BHP (+1.5%) and South 32 (+5%), while oil prices rose throughout the US session after the latest DoE crude inventory data showed US oil output had dropped. Elsewhere, the&nbsp;<strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.7%)</strong><strong> </strong>edged higher with the gains led by defensive stocks with investors seemingly content to shrug off the notion of a more aggressive Fed unwinding stimulus more rapidly than expected.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European bourses are trading on the back foot (Eurostoxx 50 -0.3%) despite calls for a slightly firmer open. In terms of sector specific moves, telecoms are the clear outperformer with BT Group (BT/A LN) shares at the top of the FSTE 100 following a positive broker upgrade at Berenberg. However, the biggest story in the UK equity space comes from RBS (-4.5%) who are one of the notable laggards in the FSTE 100 as a return to profit for the Co. was not enough to soothe investor concerns over restructuring costs and a lack of clarity from the DoJ investigation. Other notable movers include Valeo (-9.5%), IAG (-4.7%), Swiss Re (+1.8%) and Pearson (+1.1%) post-earnings, while Standard Life Aberdeen (+2.2%) have been granted some reprieve after offloading their insurance unit to Phoenix (+5.4%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY has slipped further below the 90.000 level, and it remains a very close call whether the Greenback can continue its recent &lsquo;winning&rsquo; run to make it 5 out of 5 trading days and a first complete week of gains this year. Technically, the index needs to close above 90.500-600, so quite a bit above the upper end of the 90.060-89.750 range thus far, and much may depend on the overall tone that emerges from the latest round of Fed rhetoric via a slew of speakers and Powell&rsquo;s first semi-annual monetary policy report. However, Usd/Jpy still looks pivotal for the Dollar&rsquo;s overall direction with the pair now heavy around 107.00 having failed to rebound to 108.00 at the height of its rebound from 105.55 lows. Note also, a large 107.00 option expiry strike for next Monday (1.6 bn) may act like an anchor. Eur/Usd straddles 1.2300, with no reaction to final Eurozone CPI and Cable continues to be drawn towards 1.4000 while holding in above solid support ahead of 1.3800 on Brexit-related weakness (similarly 0.8800 is a pivot in Eur/Gbp). In terms of crosses, Eur/Sek has been a mover in wake of cautious and dovish Riksbank minutes as several Board members registered concerns about weak inflation at the January policy meeting, and the pair has eclipsed the 10.0333 peak from 2017, with the previous year&rsquo;s high at 10.0833 next on the charts. Back to G10s, the Nzd gained little lasting traction from better NZ retail sales overnight, with a breakdown revealing discretionary items providing a major boost, and Aud/Nzd stop-buying also working against the Kiwi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Market observers cite stops triggered in Bunds around the 158.90 level on the way to and through 159.00, and the core Eurozone debt future extended to 159.23 before running out of steam for a 47 tick advance on the previous close. Gilts have followed suit, but continue to lag on more hawkish BoE vs ECB near term policy dynamics and remain capped ahead of 122.00, albeit just at 121.97 (+27 ticks on the day). The 10 year Eurozone benchmark is outperforming peripheral bonds with Italian paper carrying more political risk premium ahead of the March 4 election and with supply coming today. US Treasuries also ticking up in sympathy it seems, but also continuing the relief and consolidation rally amidst further flattening, as this week&rsquo;s mega issuance is out of the way (at least in terms of the auction process) and the focus returns to Fed policy via a raft of speakers and the semi-annual MPR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures have seen a mild pullback from yesterday&rsquo;s post-DoE surge, albeit in close proximity to yesterday&rsquo;s best levels. Energy newsflow remains light with traders awaiting today&rsquo;s Baker Hughes release which has recently seen a trend of climbing rig counts. In metals markets, gold prices are marginally softer alongside the firmer USD and remains on track for its worst weekly performance since late last year. Elsewhere, Chinese steel futures staged a rebound overnight as traders eye a potential pick-up in demand next week as Chinese participants fully return to market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is said to announce new sanctions on North Korea later today, according to sources.

        "content": "<p>European bourses are trading with little firm direction (Eurostoxx 50 -0.1%) despite calls for a slightly firmer open. In terms of sector specific moves, telecoms are the clear outperformer with BT Group (BT/A LN) shares at the top of the FSTE 100 following a positive broker upgrade at Berenberg. However, the biggest story in the UK equity space comes from RBS (-4.4%) who are one of the notable laggards in the FSTE 100 as a return to profit for the Co. was not enough to soothe investor concerns over restructuring costs and a lack of clarity from the DoJ investigation. Other notable movers include Valeo (-9.2%), IAG (-4.4%), Swiss Re (+2.3%) and Pearson (+3%) post-earnings, while Standard Life Aberdeen (+1.2%) have been granted some reprieve after offloading their insurance unit to Phoenix (+4.9%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY has slipped further below the 90.000 level, and it remains a very close call whether the Greenback can continue its recent &lsquo;winning&rsquo; run to make it 5 out of 5 trading days and a first complete week of gains this year. Technically, the index needs to close above 90.500-600, so quite a bit above the upper end of the 90.060-89.750 range thus far, and much may depend on the overall tone that emerges from the latest round of Fed rhetoric via a slew of speakers and Powell&rsquo;s first semi-annual monetary policy report. However, Usd/Jpy still looks pivotal for the Dollar&rsquo;s overall direction with the pair now heavy around 107.00 having failed to rebound to 108.00 at the height of its rebound from 105.55 lows. Note also, a large 107.00 option expiry strike for next Monday (1.6 bn) may act like an anchor. Eur/Usd straddles 1.2300, with no reaction to final Eurozone CPI and Cable continues to be drawn towards 1.4000 while holding in above solid support ahead of 1.3800 on Brexit-related weakness (similarly 0.8800 is a pivot in Eur/Gbp). In terms of crosses, Eur/Sek has been a mover in wake of cautious and dovish Riksbank minutes as several Board members registered concerns about weak inflation at the January policy meeting, and the pair has eclipsed the 10.0333 peak from 2017, with the previous year&rsquo;s high at 10.0833 next on the charts. Back to G10s, the Nzd gained little lasting traction from better NZ retail sales overnight, with a breakdown revealing discretionary items providing a major boost, and Aud/Nzd stop-buying also working against the Kiwi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Market observers cite stops triggered in Bunds around the 158.90 level on the way to and through 159.00, and the core Eurozone debt future extended to 159.17 before running out of steam for a 41 tick advance on the previous close. Gilts have followed suit, but continue to lag on more hawkish BoE vs ECB near term policy dynamics and remain capped ahead of 122.00, albeit just at 121.97 (+27 ticks on the day). The 10 year Eurozone benchmark is outperforming peripheral bonds with Italian paper carrying more political risk premium ahead of the March 4 election and with supply coming today. US Treasuries also ticking up in sympathy it seems, but also continuing the relief and consolidation rally amidst further flattening, as this week&rsquo;s mega issuance is out of the way (at least in terms of the auction process) and the focus returns to Fed policy via a raft of speakers and the semi-annual MPR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures have seen a mild pullback from yesterday&rsquo;s post-DoE surge, albeit in close proximity to yesterday&rsquo;s best levels. Energy newsflow remains light with traders awaiting today&rsquo;s Baker Hughes release which has recently seen a trend of climbing rig counts. In metals markets, gold prices are marginally softer alongside the firmer USD and remains on track for its worst weekly performance since late last year. Elsewhere, Chinese steel futures staged a rebound overnight as traders eye a potential pick-up in demand next week as Chinese participants fully return to market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The core debt future is now retesting resistance around 158.85 and just hit 158.91, but needs more momentum to make a clean upside break and mount a serious challenge against the next bullish technical objectives (159.30-33 on some charts, assuming the psychological 159.00 level does not thwart buyers in the interim). More qualms about relative Eur strength raised by the ECB suggest no rush to speed up the pace of policy normalisation, and a similar message or tone could well be in the offing from Coeure later today as one of the dovish-leaning GC members. Data-wise, final Eurozone CPI is unlikely to be a major market-mover, but a raft of Fed speakers and new Chair Powell&rsquo;s first semi-annual Monetary Policy Report will be pivotal.</p>\r\n",

There was no new narrative for today&rsquo;s price action; once again, traders seem to be contending with the Fed at a time when some have been complaining about frothy valuations (for some time, it should be noted). There may have been some positioning-related elements keeping the bid in stocks: analysts at JPMorgan argued that their equity models suggest that systematic selling of US equities has significantly eased, and volatility-targeting strategies might now be building longs; the bank also said that next week&rsquo;s month-end is likely to see substantial buying from fixed-weight allocators, meaning that equity flows could be &ldquo;a headwind for any near-term bearish bias.&rdquo; The EMINI managed to print highs just above 2730 in afternoon trade before running out of steam, and in late trade, the March 2018 contract dropped to re-test the 2700 level, and that level was breached heading into the close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
