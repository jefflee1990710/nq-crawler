DXY also extended gains on the news, breaking above 90.000; CAD found support at 1.29, though testing the week&rsquo;s lows around 1.2850 proved too much ahead of Trump&rsquo;s official statement; The MXN, meanwhile, rose to week-highs against the buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A volatile EUR finished lower after a masterful balancing act by ECB president Draghi, who managed to hawkishly tweak forward guidance on QE, though struck a dovish message in his post-meeting presser. The result was the EUR falling, breaching 1.23 to the downside in late US trade. The focus for EURUSD now falls on the USD part of the pair, with Trump to detail steel/aluminium tariffs later on Thursday, and tomorrow&rsquo;s NFP (specifically the wages data) in focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of the BOJ meeting overnight, USDJPY has largely stayed out of trouble, refusing to participate in the choppy FX trade, patrolling a range between 105.90 to 106.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP was always on the back foot amid the USD strength. But there were also idiosyncratic reasons for the pounds slippage in late trade, after reports said UK govt officials don&rsquo;t see a #Brexit deal being reached until next year, which pushed GBPUSD beneath 1.38 to session lows, though EURGBP seemed more reticent about another test of 0.8850, given the generally EUR weakness post-ECB today.

(Newswires)<br />Note: There were earlier reports that AP Sources suggested tariffs are to take effect in 15 days with Canada and Mexico to be exempted indefinitely from the tariffs, while Trump had earlier commented that it is likely Canada and Mexico will not have tariffs if a deal is reached.

As expected, the US Treasury said it would auction $62b in 3s/10s/30s next week. US T-note futures settled up 5ticks at 120-25+. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT: Equities up; DXY up, EUR down, JPY uneventful; Treasuries flat; crude down.<br />* REAR VIEW: Mexico/Canada indefinitely exempt from Tariffs, AP reports; ECB drops pledge to increase QE.<br />* AHEAD: BOJ overnight, China CPI overnight, US non-farm payrolls tomorrow. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THEMES:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TARIFFS: </strong>Trump confirmed<strong> </strong>he would apply tariffs on aluminium and steel (10% and 25% respectively) though news<strong> </strong>that Canada and Mexico may be indefinitely exempt (based on NAFTA progress) provided a late catalyst for choppy price action. Both countries currencies sharply strengthened against the USD, while equities saw a small bounce, though failed to print session highs. AP also reported that other countries will be able to negotiate exclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> The ECB dropped/softened its easing bias, as was expected, removing references in its statement to increase/extend QE (Draghi said it was a remnant from 2016 &ndash; when the economic landscape was very different). The move helps to prepare markets for an end to its QE programme, which was taken as hawkish. However, the ECB&rsquo;s updated forecasts (revised 2019 HICP forecast down slightly), and Draghi&rsquo;s press conference (impressed uncertainties due to US protectionism, reiterated the need for substantial stimulus, repeated inflation is yet to show signs of a sustained move to target) was more dovish, seeing the EUR weaken in wake of the meeting/presser. Late in the day, the customary post-meeting sources story suggested that ECB staff calculations on future path of monetary policy assume asset purchases of EUR 30bln in Q4 (the QE programme is currently slated to end in Sepp/2018), according to unnamed Euro area officials, raising the possibility of a tapered rate of asset purchases through the end of this year (at a rate of EUR 10bln/month).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PAYROLLS:</strong> Macroeconomic evidence augurs well for the February payrolls report. Wage growth expected to ease slightly but continue to hint at wage pressures. Full RANsquawk preview <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/18746/download\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOJ:</strong> The BoJ is to conclude its latest 2-day policy meeting on Friday with the consensus one-sided for the central bank to maintain its QQE with Yield Curve Control and keep NIRP at -0.10%. Furthermore, Kuroda et al. are also seen to keep policy settings unchanged throughout the year with 22 out of 34 economists surveyed expecting the 10yr yield target to be kept at around 0% for the whole of 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.03 LOWER AT USD 60.12; BRENT FUTURES SETTLE 73 CENTS LOWER AT USD 63.31.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Crude is struggling to find bullish catalysts. Recent jawboning energy officials (OPEC+, CERA, etc) is once again being offset by bearish factors. Today, the narrative focussed once again on the difficulties in bringing inventories down: Genscape forecast Cushing stocks have built in the week (+293k from 2/Mar), Motiva&rsquo;s Port Arthur refinery (600k BPD) is said to be raising production on its large crude unit after restart, and additionally, the threat of trade wars has kept commodities under pressure (more barriers to trade is likely to see global growth slow, reducing demand for crude/industrial commodities). Also, at the margin, a firmer dollar was contributing to the bearish narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +0.4%, DJI +0.4%, NDX +0.5%</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US STOCKS </strong>bounced to fresh session highs in late trade after AP reported that Canada and Mexico would be indefinitely exempt from Trump&rsquo;s steal/aluminium tariffs, spurring risk sentiment as traders welcomed a watered-down version of trade wars. However, the gains proved fleeting, and after Trump began his announcement, the sellers returned, as the trade war narrative gripped the news cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>CONS DISC (XLY): +0.18%, CONS STAP (XLP): +0.74%, ENERGY (XLE): -0.24%, FINANCIALS (XLF): +0.09%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +0.48%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): +0.33%, MATERIALS (XLB): -0.05%, TECH (XLK): +0.26%, TELECOMS (XTL): +0.26%, UTLITIES (XLU): +0.60%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLED 5 TICKS HIGHER AT 120-25+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES </strong>seem blas&eacute; about almost everything, ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s payrolls data, and it was another subdued day with limited price action. For parts of the early day, Tsys were following their German counterpart during the ECB press conference. Moves were muted, but the net impact was a compression of the spread between the two. As expected, the US Treasury said it would auction $62b in 3s/10s/30s next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: CAD, MXN BOUNCE ON TARIFF EXEMPTION HOPES.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD, CAD, MXN: </strong>Sharp strength against the USD after the Associated Press reported that Mexico and Canada would be indefinitely exempt from tariffs, sending both currencies to session highs against the greenback. DXY also extended gains on the news, breaking above 90.000; CAD found support at 1.29, though testing the week&rsquo;s lows around 1.2850 proved too much ahead of Trump&rsquo;s official statement; The MXN, meanwhile, rose to week-highs against the buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR:</strong> A volatile EUR finished lower after a masterful balancing act by ECB president Draghi, who managed to hawkishly tweak forward guidance on QE, though struck a dovish message in his post-meeting presser. The result was the EUR falling, breaching 1.23 to the downside in late US trade. The focus for EURUSD now falls on the USD part of the pair, with Trump to detail steel/aluminium tariffs later on Thursday, and tomorrow&rsquo;s NFP (specifically the wages data) in focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY:</strong> Ahead of the BOJ meeting overnight, USDJPY has largely stayed out of trouble, refusing to participate in the choppy FX trade, patrolling a range between 105.90 to 106.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling was always on the back foot amid the USD strength. But there were also idiosyncratic reasons for the pounds slippage in late trade, after reports said UK govt officials don&rsquo;t see a #Brexit deal being reached until next year, which pushed GBPUSD beneath 1.38 to session lows, though EURGBP seemed more reticent about another test of 0.8850, given the generally EUR weakness post-ECB today. Some desks are targeting have been targeting a full correction of GBP (from 1.4350 region) to 1.3650; earlier in the day, some desks were reported to have been interested in adding shorts on a break of 1.3850.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Eur/Usd jumped around 70 pips (broadly in line with option pricing) to a circa 1.2445 high in wake of the ECB&rsquo;s March policy statement that dropped the phrase indicating that the pace of QE could be increased if required, but failed once again to test/breach key resistance residing around 1.2461 and ultimately tumbled to a fresh session low sub-1.2350 and under chart support circa 1.2355. Ultimately, President Draghi maintained that asset buying may be extended beyond September and ample accommodation is still warranted given that underlying inflation pressures remain subdued and the battle to hit target is not yet won. He also underlined that recent trade developments pose downside risks to the outlook, ahead of US President Trump&rsquo;s meeting on proposed tariffs and expected sign off by the end of the week. However, with the promise of a temporary exemption and better than expected Canadian housing data in the form of starts and building permits, Usd/Cad eased back from highs around 1.2950 to the low 1.2900 area eyeing BoC&rsquo;s Lane tonight. Nevertheless, the DXY extended its topside range to almost 90.000, largely due to the Eur&rsquo;s net decline, but also ongoing appreciation vs other G10 rivals, bar the Jpy that continues to hug 106.00.</p>\r\n",

However, bond sellers and Eur buyers may continue to book profits given the possibility that President Draghi delivers a more balanced message via his prepared text and/or Q&amp;A responses shortly. Indeed, peripheral bonds have largely taken the removal of upping QE in the event of a deterioration in economic conditions in stride, probably on the premise that the ECB is still easing and has left the door open in terms of extending asset purchases beyond September if required.</p>\r\n",

Material and Energy names are the session laggards, with BHP Billiton (-3.9%), Anglo American (-2.0%) underperforming in the FTSE and Arcelormittal (-1.0%) in the CAC. Elsewhere, the Telecom sector (+1.0%) outperformance has been supported by phone operators Vodafone (+1.3%), Orange (+0.54%) and DT Telekom (+0.7%). So far, newsflow has been on the lighter side as participants await the ECB decision, in which there is rising speculation that the central bank could drop its QE easing bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>DXY</strong> is mildly firmer within a relative narrow 89.770-545 band, as the Greenback ekes out relatively small gains vs all its G10 rivals on more reports that Canada, Mexico and possibly other nations may be given exemptions from US import tariffs that are expected to be officially signed off later today or on Friday. This has calmed global trade war fears to an extent, while North Korea continues its charm initiative on the nuclear front by offering a conditional ICBM suspension. However, the impending ECB meeting provides potential more currency market activity with expectations very split on whether the QE easing bias will dropped or not. <strong>Eur/Usd </strong>currently towards the lower end of a tight range around the 1.2400 level amidst reports that new ECB Staff forecasts will be largely the same as in December, but latest forward guidance and the tone of President Draghi&rsquo;s press conference/Q&amp;A are key along with the aforementioned pledge to increase and/or extend asset buying if needed. Options break-even pricing assigns a circa +/- 67 pip move on the eventuality as a benchmark. Elsewhere, <strong>Usd/Jpy</strong> also remains largely anchored around a big figure &ndash; 106.00 where a hefty expiry runs off (1.1 bn), and now awaiting the BoJ for more independent impetus. The <strong>Aud</strong> and <strong>Nzd </strong>continue to underperform around 0.7800 and 0.7250 vs the Usd as the partial Dollar revival weighs on commodity prices, and the Aud fails to derive any sustained benefit from a big trade data beat overnight.

Some are pointing to &lsquo;source&rsquo; reports indicating an upgrade to the ECB&rsquo;s Staff GDP projection for 2018 (2.5% touted from 2.3% previously), while another technical failure ahead of 157.00 may also have left buyers bereft of further upside incentive and intraday longs could simply be squaring up or paring back positions ahead of the ECB. Irrespective of rhyme or reason, the core Eurex debt future has been down to 156.65, -16 ticks and 27 ticks off best levels, while Gilts have extended their losses to 19 ticks to 121.07 vs +5 ticks at one stage. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain relatively side-lined and immune/flat ahead of the US open and weekly jobless claims, but next week&rsquo;s 3, 10 and 30 year auction details may provide some impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices hovering around yesterday&rsquo;s lows with WTI back at USD 61/bbl (-0.1%), while Brent is around the low USD 60s (-0.2%) amid the slight firming of the USD index.

        "content": "<p>Equities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As trade war fears are easing, the European cash open mimicked the lead seen on Wall St. and overnight in Asia, with major bourses recouping prior losses (Eurostoxx 50 +0.2%) with the exception of the DAX 30 (-0.2%) which sees Merck (-3.0%) at the bottom of the index after the release of its earnings this morning. Material and Energy names are the session laggards, with BHP Billiton (-3.9%), Anglo American (-2.0%) underperforming in the FTSE and Arcelormittal (-1.0%) in the CAC. Elsewhere, the Telecom sector (+1.0%) outperformance has been supported by phone operators Vodafone (+1.3%), Orange (+0.54%) and DT Telekom (+0.7%). So far, newsflow has been on the lighter side as participants await the ECB decision, in which there is rising speculation that the central bank could drop its QE easing bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY is mildly firmer within a relative narrow 89.770-545 band, as the Greenback ekes out relatively small gains vs all its G10 rivals on more reports that Canada, Mexico and possibly other nations may be given exemptions from US import tariffs that are expected to be officially signed off later today or on Friday. This has calmed global trade war fears to an extent, while North Korea continues its charm initiative on the nuclear front by offering a conditional ICBM suspension. However, the impending ECB meeting provides potential more currency market activity with expectations very split on whether the QE easing bias will dropped or not. Eur/Usd currently towards the lower end of a tight range around the 1.2400 level amidst reports that new ECB Staff forecasts will be largely the same as in December, but latest forward guidance and the tone of President Draghi&rsquo;s press conference/Q&amp;A are key along with the aforementioned pledge to increase and/or extend asset buying if needed. Options break-even pricing assigns a circa +/- 67 pip move on the eventuality as a benchmark. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy also remains largely anchored around a big figure &ndash; 106.00 where a hefty expiry runs off (1.1 bn), and now awaiting the BoJ for more independent impetus. The Aud and Nzd continue to underperform around 0.7800 and 0.7250 vs the Usd as the partial Dollar revival weighs on commodity prices, and the Aud fails to derive any sustained benefit from a big trade data beat overnight. Elsewhere, some Nok weakness vs the Eur after Stats Norway trimmed its 2018 inflation and growth forecasts (cross nudging towards 9.7300) and Usd/Hkd is close to the top of its peg tolerance ceiling with the HKMA indicating that 7.8500 is the line in the sand (vs 7.8300 at present). USD/TRY also firmer this morning, after Moody&rsquo;s downgraded Turkey&rsquo;s sovereign rating deeper into junk territory with the outlook negative.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixed Income</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have seen a fraction more upside and a fresh 156.92 Eurex peak (+11 ticks vs -10 ticks at the low) amidst reports of some Japanese buying vs US Treasuries although the latter remain a few ticks ahead and just above 120-00. Conversely, Gilts are now lagging and in negative territory having probed higher with their 10 year Eurozone equivalent in very early Liffe trade between 121.11-31 parameters vs Wednesday&rsquo;s 121.26 settlement level. Note, however, turnover is paltry and price activity very choppy, albeit still relatively rangebound with today&rsquo;s major risk even to come via the ECB, plus NFP on Friday of course.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices hovering around yesterday&rsquo;s lows with WTI back at USD 61/bbl (-0.1%), while Brent is around the low USD 60s (-0.2%) amid the slight firming of the USD index.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks recouped some of the prior day&rsquo;s losses with gains across the region after trade protectionism concerns somewhat eased and amid a continued friendlier tone from North Korea, with the nation said to offer a conditional halt to its ICBM program. ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) were higher with sentiment also underpinned by economic releases including encouraging trade figures in Australia and stronger than expected Japanese Final Q4 GDP. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.2%) outperformed and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) initially lagged after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations, before better than expected Chinese trade data provided some inspiration. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued as demand lacked amid the improved risk appetite and following an uneventful enhanced-liquidity auction, while the BoJ also began their latest 2-day policy meeting which is not expected to provide any fireworks.</p>\r\n",
