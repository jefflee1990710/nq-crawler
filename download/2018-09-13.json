(Times/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Minister Raab said Northern Ireland needs to be shift across the board in EU&#39;s approach and in the event of a no deal Britain would pay not a penny more than its legal obligations, although he also commented that EU and UK is making progress every time they meet for negotiations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&#39;s spokesman confirmed once again the government&#39;s aim is to base Brexit deal on Chequers plan and stated that a no-Brexit deal is unlikely but possible, while the spokesman added that a further ramp up of no-deal preparations will be coming in next weeks and months.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU leaders will next week discuss whether to have a special Brexit Summit in November, according to a senior diplomat who added that Brexit negotiator Barnier does not need a legal mandate from states to negotiate post-Brexit relations with the EU. Furthermore, there were also comments from a senior EU official that the EU have worked on a no-deal scenario for months and will continue preparing for a no-deal scenario, while the official added an Irish backstop must be in place from day one and that a backstop is the only way to avoid a hard border.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia Energy Minister Novak said we have discussed all energy related topics with US Energy Secretary Perry and can find things in common, while he also stated they agreed to restore dialogue with Perry but is concerned over possible sanctions on Nord Stream 2.

Bostic added will evaluate data before deciding on fourth hike and that there is uncertainty whether US is at full employment, while he also commented the Fed can be patient with hikes if there is no risk of the economy overheating and that it is possible that neutral rate has moved higher.

Qualcomm (QCOM) was higher as it begins its $16bln share buybacks. AMD (AMD), however, was lower despite a PT upgrade at Deutsche Bank, as well as FBN initiating the name with an outperform rating. Industrials were higher, though UPS (UPS) was dragging on the sector after its new cost saving measures failed to impress. Discovery (DISCA) was leading the discretionary sector, continued its momentum on Thursday after Wednesday&#39;s news that it partners with Sling TV. TripAdvisor (TRIP) was higher after chowdah reports. Staples were positive, despite Kroger (KR) notably underperforming after SSS missed estimates, sending shares as much as 11% lower. SPX +0.5% at 2904, NDX +1.0% at 7562, DJI +0.6% at 26146.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury curve modestly flattened on Thursday, after a weak CPI report (which followed a soft PPI report earlier in the week). Yields on 2s and 3s hit fresh decade highs in the session. At settlement, most curve spreads were under 1bps lower. The US sold $15bln of 30-year bonds at 3.088%, coming in on the screws, though the yield was 0.2bps lower than the previous auction cycle. Cover was above the previous auction, but in line with recent averages. Indirect takedown was encouraging, as was dealer participation was notably lower than recent averages. US T-note futures (Z8) settled half-a-tick lower at 119-13+.</p>\r\n",

Later, US President Trump said the US in not under pressure to make a deal, accusing the WSJ of getting it wrong, arguing that China instead is under pressure to make a deal with the US. Elsewhere, Trump told donors he plans to re-brand NAFTA as &ldquo;USMC,&rdquo; but could drop the &lsquo;C&rsquo; if Canada doesn&#39;t agree to his changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>An official reported the US is working on an additional &quot;severe&quot; round of Russian sanctions by November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>The Bank of England rate decision came in as expected, with the Base Rate held steady at 0.75% with neither a dovish nor hawkish stance exhibited from the Central Bank. BoE commentary was largely a reiteration of previous rhetoric, with the Bank remaining in &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; mode with regards to rates, stating that should growth continue as expected, &ldquo;tightening is appropriate at a gradual and limited pace&rdquo;. On the growth front, the BoE suggests that survey data points to Q3 GDP of 0.5% vs. prev. 0.4%. The BoE did note, however, that downside risks to the global economy have increased, particularly in the EM scope, and that the Brexit situation compared to August has become uncertain. With regards to Brexit, the Bank refrained from providing any major tweaks to its guidance, with Brexit currently being somewhat of a &lsquo;moving target&rsquo; as the EU and UK grapples to strike a deal for their future trading relationship. Overall, Lloyds concluded that, Brexit aside, &ldquo;if capacity constraints continue to build, the BoE may well be convinced to raise interest rates sooner than current market pricing suggests (Q4 2019) and potentially ahead of our own view of August next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE&rsquo;S CARNEY: </strong>The BOE governor said that the MPC cannot cut rates to offset a no-deal Brexit, according to a report in The Times; he said house prices would plummet in a no-deal scenario. Carney argued that structural changes to the UK economy in a no-deal Brexit scenario would mean looser monetary policy would only pump-up inflation further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>The ECB did not provide any significant change at its meeting on Thursday as interest rates were kept unchanged as expected. The only small alteration to the forward guidance was on the timing of the QE programme as the ECB confirmed reduction in purchases to EUR 15bln will begin in October and gradually be narrow after December 2018. With regards to outlook, the ECB cut its 2018 and 2019 growth forecasts to 2.0% and 1.8% respectively,&nbsp; as expected, confirming ECB sources reports on Wednesday that weaker external demand was posing downside risk to growth. Nonetheless the inflation outlook was left unchanged at 1.7% over its forecast horizon. At the Press Conference ECB&rsquo;s President Draghi sounded more upbeat over the resilience od the economy in the Euro area and the central bank&rsquo;s aim of meeting the inflation target in a sustainable way. He mentioned the Governing Council has not yet discusses the reinvestment policy which will initiate after QE ends, and stressed that the capital key will persist as a guiding tool and suggesting fixability will be in place over timing and maturities of the reinvestments. Rabobank sees two potential conclusions for the ECB action in the future; the first on would see the Council adoption gradual policy tightening if it is confident inflation will converge to target; the second would see the central bank simply ending the QE purchases, which now appears to be the main focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CBT: </strong>The Turkish Central Bank stole the limelight on super Thursday, with a hike to 24.00% from 17.75%. It also combined this with an alteration to the funding provided through overnight lending, which is now to be done through one-week repo auctions, alongside committing to further tightening if necessary. While the hike itself was not surprising following a flagged policy adjustment by the central bank last week, the magnitude of the hike was welcomed, and supported the rest of the EM complex. The CBRT said that this was necessary to support price stability, as upside risks were being seen despite weaker demand conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CPI </strong>rose by 0.2% in August, missing expectation of a 0.3% rise, which was enough to take the YY figure to 2.7%, consensus was for 2.8%. Core CPIs also came slight short of expectations with the MM headline coming in at 0.1% (Exp. 0.2%) and the YY one at 2.2% (Exp. 2.4%). The softness of the data was attributed to falling apparel prices as well as healthcare costs, while new car prices were unmoved. On the flip side, airline fares primary rents rose. Analysts a t Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that the latest release confirms that the&nbsp; &ldquo;inflation threat is limited&rdquo; for now, and the Fed will likely hike two more times this year as falling unemployment may pose a threat to inflation in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Sources said the UK has agreed to the EU&#39;s request for information, that could help resolve the deadlock around the Irish border issue. This comes following EU&rsquo;s negotiators rewriting parts of the divorce agreement in order to make it more acceptable for the UK in finding a technical solution for the backstop. UK PM May&#39;s spokesman confirmed once again the government&#39;s aim is to base a Brexit deal on the Chequers plan and reiterated no-Brexit deal is unlikely but possible; &nbsp;with regards to the timing of negotiations he is expecting further ramp up of no-deal preparations in the incoming weeks and months. &nbsp;Similarly, UK Brexit Minister Raab said that in the event of a no deal Britain would pay not a penny more than its legal obligations, though reiterated that the EU and UK are making progress every time they meet for negotiations. Over in Europe, EU leaders are to discuss next week whether to have a special Brexit Summit in November with a senior diplomat stating that Brexit negotiator Barnier does not need a legal mandate from states to negotiate post-Brexit relations with the EU. He also added that the EU has worked on a no-deal scenario for months and continues to do so, urging an Irish backstop to be in place from day one, stressing that a backstop is the only way to avoid a hard border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.5% at 2904, NDX +1.0% at 7562, DJI +0.6% at 26146. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.0%%, Materials +0.3%%, Industrials +0.5%%, Cons Discretionary +0.1%, Cons Staples -0.4%, Healthcare +1.2%, Financials -0.2%, Tech +1.2%, Telecoms +0.3%, Utilities +0.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>The technology sector underpinned gains, with Micron (MU) snapping the recent runs of declines after apositive mention by David Tepper, who is long of the stock. Qualcomm (QCOM) was higher as it begins its $16bln share buybacks. AMD (AMD), however, was lower despite a PT upgrade at Deutsche Bank, as well as FBN initiating the name with an outperform rating. Industrials were higher, though UPS (UPS) was dragging on the sector after its new cost saving measures failed to impress. Discovery (DISCA) was leading the discretionary sector, continued its momentum on Thursday after Wednesday&#39;s news that it partners with Sling TV. TripAdvisor (TRIP) was higher after chowdah reports. Staples were positive, despite Kroger (KR) notably underperforming after SSS missed estimates, sending shares as much as 11% lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES $1.78 LOWER AT $68.59/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLES USD 1.56 LOWER AT USD 78.18/BBL. </strong>Oil was lower on Thursday, with newswires attributing the moves to fears that emerging market tensions and trade wars could hit demand, despite the expected tightening in supply. The latest IEA monthly report alluded to the tightening supply conditions in Iran and Venezuela, which it says could be an issue going forward, but not at present, with OPEC production rising to 32.63mln BPD in August, near estimates. IEA also pointed out that OECD stocks had been little changed since March, suggesting the market is in balance, rather than in a deficit. Elsewhere, the IEA sees global demand rising above 100mln BNPD in the coming quarter, but acknowledged downside risks which are emerging. Meanwhile, the UK North Sea Buzzard oilfield did not restart yesterday, and Libyan oilfields and ports are operating as normal following attacks on the NOC HQ. Meanwhile, on weather watch, Florence is expected to make landfall overnight as a Cat 2 Hurricane, though is still expected to be dangerous, with winds over100mph, as well as flooding expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES HALF-A-TICK LOWER AT 119-13+.</strong> The Treasury curve modestly flattened on Thursday, after a weak CPI report (which followed a soft PPI report earlier in the week). Yields on 2s and 3s hit fresh decade highs in the session. At settlement, most curve spreads were under 1bps lower. The US sold $15bln of 30-year bonds at 3.088%, coming in on the screws, though the yield was 0.2bps lower than the previous auction cycle. Cover was above the previous auction, but in line with recent averages. Indirect takedown was encouraging, as was dealer participation was notably lower than recent averages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>Already ramped up, albeit wide-ranging market expectations and the potential for disappointment ahead of Turkey&rsquo;s eagerly awaited rate verdict were merely intensified by comments from President Erdogan reiterating his opposition to tightening the monetary policy reins. Hence, the magnitude of the reaction to the resulting 625 bp hike (to 24%) was arguably exacerbated as Usd/Try reversed sharply from circa 6.4000 to just a fraction above 6.0000 and a high around 6.5500. Note also, the CBRT also underlined its independence and/or credibility by announcing that from Friday daily funding provisions will be made via the 1-week repo instead of the Lira vs Dollar depo facility. The aggressive action gave other regional currencies a boost, with the Rand also extending its recent recovery gains on supportive Moody&rsquo;s comments and a SA Government pledge to promote stronger growth via reallocating budget spending &ndash; Usd/Zar down through 14.6300 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>Also looking for some Central Bank inspiration, but half-heartedly given overwhelming consensus for unchanged policy from either the ECB or BoE, and minor if any tweaks at all to policy guidance. However, the single currency and Pound rallied sharply vs a broadly deflated Greenback after US CPI misses that compounded Wednesday&rsquo;s weaker than forecast PPI data, with the added impetus of positive Brexit headlines (EU will decide soon on a special November summit, UK said to be willing to provide more detail for Brussels and Raab confident about deal prospects). Eur/Usd cleared 1.1650 and offers around 1.1680 to pierce its 100 DMA and touch 1.1700, while Cable climbed through near term resistance between 1.3080-85 to trade up at 1.3120, with Eur/Gbp nudging beyond 0.8900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Buoyed by strong Aussie labour data overnight (albeit not consistently) the Aud led rival G10s from the outset vs its US counterpart and appears to be breaking stiff resistance around 0.7200, though still prone to any adverse US-China or global trade, tariff and diplomatic developments, like additional US sanctions vs China and Russia due to North Korea that somewhat negates Washington&rsquo;s invite to Beijing for more talks, which was welcomed at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, NZD: </strong>Both beneficiaries of the latest Usd downturn (DXY down under 94.500 and its 100 DMA), with the Franc strengthening considerably over 0.9700 and Kiwi building on gains above 0.6550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, JPY: </strong>Bucking the general trend of outperforming vs the Greenback or vice-versa, as the Loonie lost some NAFTA-related momentum and slipped back to ~1.3000, while the Jpy lost any domestic support from bids layered between 111.50-70 and 10 pip intervals, plus option expiry-related interest from 111.50-65 to trade at new recent lows circa 111.20.&nbsp; 112.00 the obvious next tech and psych level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP &ndash; US RETAIL SALES: </strong>The Street looks for the pace of US retail sales growth to ease slightly in August to 0.4% MM vs&nbsp;the prior 0.5% in July.&nbsp;Wells Fargo&rsquo;s analysts note the rising consumer price inflation could &ldquo;restrain the more rapid pace of real consumer spending&rdquo; experienced in recent months, and it&nbsp; expects July&#39;s retail sales to be revised in August. RBC&#39;s analysts have expectations in line with the consensus, and notes&nbsp;gasoline prices were firm in the month which&nbsp;should help support the data. Citi&#39;s analysts, meanwhile, look for the the headline figure to print 0.3%, citing softer August auto sales as a reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP &ndash; CBR RATE DECISION: </strong>Russia&#39;s central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged at 7.25% at the conclusion of its meeting on Friday. The meeting comes amid political pressure that is seemingly being placed on the central bank; Russian PM Medvedev this week demanded that the central bank cut rates amid the turmoil in EM, a call that analysts at Commerzbank describe as &quot;dangerous sliding tackle,&quot; and drew comparisons with Turkey (whose President Erdogan notably called for lower rates, which may have contributed to the EMFX crisis, but definitely contributed to the TRY crisis). The central bank governor Nabiullina leaned against Medvedev&#39;s comments, however, stating that there were more factors for keeping rates unchanged rather than cutting; she also noted that there were key factors for raising the key rate, although she did not want to get further drawn into comments ahead of the rate meeting. &quot;The fact that the governor of Bank Rossii Elvira Nabiullina immediately spoke up and confirmed her hawkish approach in a speech prevented anything worse form happening,&quot; Commerzbank writes. &quot;In a worst case scenario this could mean that the rouble gets into a TRY-like downward spiral. In the best case scenario the central bank now has to take strong counter-measures to prevent this from happening - with higher interest rates that put more pressure on the Russian economy than would have been necessary without Medvedev&rsquo;s comments.&quot;</p>\r\n",

The latest IEA monthly report alluded to the tightening supply conditions in Iran and Venezuela, which it says could be an issue going forward, but not at present, with OPEC production rising to 32.63mln BPD in August, near estimates. IEA also pointed out that OECD stocks had been little changed since March, suggesting the market is in balance, rather than in a deficit. Elsewhere, the IEA sees global demand rising above 100mln BNPD in the coming quarter, but acknowledged downside risks which are emerging. Meanwhile, the UK North Sea Buzzard oilfield did not restart yesterday, and Libyan oilfields and ports are operating as normal following attacks on the NOC HQ. Meanwhile, on weather watch, Florence is expected to make landfall overnight as a Cat 2 Hurricane, though is still expected to be dangerous, with winds over100mph, as well as flooding expected.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already ramped up, albeit wide-ranging market expectations and the potential for disappointment ahead of Turkey&rsquo;s eagerly awaited rate verdict were merely intensified by comments from President Erdogan reiterating his opposition to tightening the monetary policy reins. Hence, the magnitude of the reaction to the resulting 625 bp hike (to 24%) was arguably exacerbated as Usd/Try reversed sharply from circa 6.4000 to just a fraction above 6.0000 and a high around 6.5500. Note also, the CBRT also underlined its independence and/or credibility by announcing that from Friday daily funding provisions will be made via the 1 week repo instead of the Lira vs Dollar depo facility. The aggressive action gave other regional currencies a boost, with the Rand also extending its recent recovery gains on supportive Moody&rsquo;s comments and a SA Government pledge to promote stronger growth via reallocating budget spending &ndash; Usd/Zar down through 14.6300 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also looking for some Central Bank inspiration, but half-heartedly given overwhelming consensus for unchanged policy from either the ECB or BoE, and minor if any tweaks at all to policy guidance. However, the single currency and Pound rallied sharply vs a broadly deflated Greenback after US CPI misses that compounded Wednesday&rsquo;s weaker than forecast PPI data, with the added impetus of positive Brexit headlines (EU will decide soon on a special November summit, UK said to be willing to provide more detail for Brussels and Raab confident about deal prospects). Eur/Usd cleared 1.1650 and offers around 1.1680 to pierce its 100 DMA and touch 1.1700, while Cable climbed through near term resistance between 1.3080-85 to trade up at 1.3120, with Eur/Gbp nudging beyond 0.8900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buoyed by strong Aussie labour data overnight (albeit not consistently) the Aud led rival G10s from the outset vs its US counterpart and appears to be breaking stiff resistance around 0.7200, though still prone to any adverse US-China or global trade, tariff and diplomatic developments, like additional US sanctions vs China and Russia due to North Korea that somewhat negates Washington&rsquo;s invite to Beijing for more talks, which was welcomed at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both beneficiaries of the latest Usd downturn (DXY down under 94.500 and its 100 DMA), with the Franc strengthening considerably over 0.9700 and Kiwi building on gains above 0.6550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bucking the general trend of outperforming vs the Greenback or vice-versa, as the Loonie lost some NAFTA-related momentum and slipped back to 1.3000, while the Jpy lost any domestic support from bids layered between 111.50-70 and 10 pip intervals, plus option expiry-related interest from 111.50-65 to trade at new recent lows circa 111.90.&nbsp; 112.00 the obvious next tech and psych level.</p>\r\n",

This lifted most the regional bourses with Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) also euphoric on better than expected Machine Orders which grew at the fastest pace since January 2016, while ASX 200 (-0.8%) bucked the trend as financials were dampened after further unscrupulous practices were revealed at banking royal commission. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+2.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) were firmer with sentiment boosted by the more encouraging trade-related headlines and after the PBoC upped its liquidity efforts, while participants also digested lending data in which New Yuan Loans missed estimates although Aggregate Financing, which is the broadest measure for China&rsquo;s credit growth, topped forecasts.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Rosengren (Non-Voter, Hawk) said a recession has inevitably followed when employment falls to as low as current levels. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equities are mixed, with trading tentative ahead of the BoE, ECB and CRBT rate decisions later on in the day. Major moves have been confined to equity specific stories, with Michelin&rsquo;s guidance reaffirmation leading the CAC to the top of the bourse pile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite FTSE heavyweights RBS (announcement of a special dividend) and Glencore (base metal strength) outperforming, the FTSE is leading the losses in the index space, with SSE close to the foot of the bourse after a broker downgrade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IT sector is the marked sector outperformer with semiconductor names benefiting from AMD&rsquo;s outperformance in the US session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index and broad Dollar are softer post-US initiatives to resume formal trade discussions with China, but off lows and relatively side-lined ahead of US inflation data later. The DXY is attempting to nudge back up towards 95.000 from 94.767 at worst, as Usd/G10 pairings consolidate before Thursday&rsquo;s headline events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - The major outperformer and beneficiary of planned mediation on tariffs between Washington and Beijing, but still labouring on approaches or rebounds to 0.7200, even with the extra incentive of upbeat Aussie data overnight (August payrolls easily exceeded consensus and largely due to full time jobs). Note also, Aud/Usd flanked by hefty option expiry interest at 0.7220-30 (1 bn) and 0.7140-50 (1.1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Back to the bottom of the G10 pile on the aforementioned de-escalation of global protectionism tensions, and significantly stronger than expected Japanese machinery orders, with reported domestic offers at 111.50 revisited ahead of larger supply said to be lurking between 111.60-70, plus large option expiries between 111.50-65 (2.1 bn) in the mix .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP/NZD/EUR/CAD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback and awaiting more impetus/direction, with the Franc pivoting 0.9700 and barely noting Swiss producer/import price data, while Cable attempts to build a firmer footing above 1.3000 on latest positive Brexit deal headlines (Raab anticipating ramped up UK-EU negotiations soon) rather than any real prospect of support or adverse impulse from the BoE at noon. However, option expiries could also exert some influence given decent NY cut run-offs at 1.3000-15 (1 bn) and 1.3060 (1.3 bn). The Kiwi has extended its recovery from near 0.6500 to just above 0.6550 ahead of NZ manufacturing PMI tonight, and the single currency looks more comfortable over 1.1600 following more Italian reports and denials about Finance Minister Tria on the verge of resigning over budget disagreements, but will be looking for further impetus/direction from ECB President Draghi later. Flow-wise, 1.1600 and 1.1625 expiries (in 2 bn and 1bn respectively) could cap gains, and for the Loonie that is straddling 1.3000 upcoming Canadian new house price data will likely pale vs any fresh NAFTA developments as more talks are scheduled today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - Both slightly firmer vs the Eur, and with the Swedish Krona not unduly dented by downward revisions to Q2 GDP growth given that the Riksbank has already leaned back on its rate hike path.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Lira looks all set to grab the limelight at midday with anticipation/hype running rife for the CBRT rate decision amidst extremely wide-ranging estimates about the extent and manner of the flagged policy stance change. For the benchmark 1 week repo, forecasts span from unchanged to as much as +725 bp, while others suggest that the Bank may be more creative/subtle/restricted and tweak other official rates/corridors instead. Usd/Try poised around the middle of a 6.3385-3905 band in the run-up, while the Rand continues its impressive rebound towards 14.8000 vs the Usd on the softer Dollar overall, and with some independent encouragement from Moody&rsquo;s downplaying the threat of an SA ratings downgrade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds seem to have been under the influence of some technical sales when near term chart support was breached around 159.63-60 amidst latest Italian Government rebuttals of coalition divisions on the fiscal front and renewed pressure on Finance Minister Tria via the 5-Star faction. Indeed, light stops were tripped down to 159.55 and a gap filled before early Eurex peaks were retested in wake of rather sluggish BTP auctions. Meanwhile, Gilts actually carved out a marginal new Liffe high at 121.88 (flat vs -16 ticks at one stage) amidst more bemoaning the impact of high rates from Turkey&rsquo;s President just hours before the CBRT is widely expected to tighten, and aggressively! Elsewhere, US Treasuries are mildly softer and steeper ahead of long bond supply and CPI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is slipping after IEA&rsquo;s monthly report which reported an increased level of production by OPEC to offset falling Iranian production, and weather premiums are being unwound as Florence has weakened abit more, but is still life-threatening storm surge and rainfall is still expected. Brent futures are now hovering above USD 79.00/bbl after breaking USD 80.00/bbl in Wednesday&rsquo;s trade. This is discounting the potential support offered to the fossil fuel by the closure of&nbsp; oil production facilities in the eastern part of the South China Sea before two typhoons hit the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is essentially unmoved ahead of this Thursdays Central Bank flurry, with low volumes seen as investors hold off trading the yellow metal. Shanghai copper (+2.3%) has seen its largest one-day gain in 3 months off the back of restored US-China trade talks, with nickel (+2.6%) and zinc (+2.6%) also benefiting from the improved risk tone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IEA Monthly Report: maintains their global oil demand growth forecast for 2018 and 2019 at 1.4mln bpd and 1.5mln bpd respectively. Said that the global oil market is tightening up. The Brent price range of USD 70-80bbl seen since April could be tested. OPEC crude output stands at a 9-month high of 32.63mln bpd in August.</p>\r\n",

Major moves have been confined to equity specific stories, with Michelin&rsquo;s guidance reaffirmation leading the CAC to the top of the bourse pile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite FTSE heavyweights RBS (announcement of a special dividend) and Glencore (base metal strength) outperforming, the FTSE is leading the losses in the index space, with SSE close to the foot of the bourse after a broker downgrade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IT sector is the marked sector outperformer with semiconductor names benefiting from AMD&rsquo;s outperformance in the US session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index and broad Dollar are softer post-US initiatives to resume formal trade discussions with China, but off lows and relatively side-lined ahead of US inflation data later. The DXY is attempting to nudge back up towards 95.000 from 94.767 at worst, as Usd/G10 pairings consolidate before Thursday&rsquo;s headline events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - The major outperformer and beneficiary of planned mediation on tariffs between Washington and Beijing, but still labouring on approaches or rebounds to 0.7200, even with the extra incentive of upbeat Aussie data overnight (August payrolls easily exceeded consensus and largely due to full time jobs). Note also, Aud/Usd flanked by hefty option expiry interest at 0.7220-30 (1 bn) and 0.7140-50 (1.1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Back to the bottom of the G10 pile on the aforementioned de-escalation of global protectionism tensions, and significantly stronger than expected Japanese machinery orders, with reported domestic offers at 111.50 revisited ahead of larger supply said to be lurking between 111.60-70, plus large option expiries between 111.50-65 (2.1 bn) in the mix .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP/NZD/EUR/CAD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback and awaiting more impetus/direction, with the Franc pivoting 0.9700 and barely noting Swiss producer/import price data, while Cable attempts to build a firmer footing above 1.3000 on latest positive Brexit deal headlines (Raab anticipating ramped up UK-EU negotiations soon) rather than any real prospect of support or adverse impulse from the BoE at noon. However, option expiries could also exert some influence given decent NY cut run-offs at 1.3000-15 (1 bn) and 1.3060 (1.3 bn). The Kiwi has extended its recovery from near 0.6500 to just above 0.6550 ahead of NZ manufacturing PMI tonight, and the single currency looks more comfortable over 1.1600 following more Italian reports and denials about Finance Minister Tria on the verge of resigning over budget disagreements, but will be looking for further impetus/direction from ECB President Draghi later. Flow-wise, 1.1600 and 1.1625 expiries (in 2 bn and 1bn respectively) could cap gains, and for the Loonie that is straddling 1.3000 upcoming Canadian new house price data will likely pale vs any fresh NAFTA developments as more talks are scheduled today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - Both slightly firmer vs the Eur, and with the Swedish Krona not unduly dented by downward revisions to Q2 GDP growth given that the Riksbank has already leaned back on its rate hike path.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Lira looks all set to grab the limelight at midday with anticipation/hype running rife for the CBRT rate decision amidst extremely wide-ranging estimates about the extent and manner of the flagged policy stance change. For the benchmark 1 week repo, forecasts span from unchanged to as much as +725 bp, while others suggest that the Bank may be more creative/subtle/restricted and tweak other official rates/corridors instead. Usd/Try poised around the middle of a 6.3385-3905 band in the run-up, while the Rand continues its impressive rebound towards 14.8000 vs the Usd on the softer Dollar overall, and with some independent encouragement from Moody&rsquo;s downplaying the threat of an SA ratings downgrade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds seem to have been under the influence of some technical sales when near term chart support was breached around 159.63-60 amidst latest Italian Government rebuttals of coalition divisions on the fiscal front and renewed pressure on Finance Minister Tria via the 5-Star faction. Indeed, light stops were tripped down to 159.55 and a gap filled before early Eurex peaks were retested in wake of rather sluggish BTP auctions. Meanwhile, Gilts actually carved out a marginal new Liffe high at 121.88 (flat vs -16 ticks at one stage) amidst more bemoaning the impact of high rates from Turkey&rsquo;s President just hours before the CBRT is widely expected to tighten, and aggressively! Elsewhere, US Treasuries are mildly softer and steeper ahead of long bond supply and CPI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is slipping after IEA&rsquo;s monthly report which reported an increased level of production by OPEC to offset falling Iranian production, and weather premiums are being unwound as Florence has weakened abit more, but is still life-threatening storm surge and rainfall is still expected. Brent futures are now hovering above USD 79.00/bbl after breaking USD 80.00/bbl in Wednesday&rsquo;s trade. This is discounting the potential support offered to the fossil fuel by the closure of&nbsp; oil production facilities in the eastern part of the South China Sea before two typhoons hit the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is essentially unmoved ahead of this Thursdays Central Bank flurry, with low volumes seen as investors hold off trading the yellow metal. Shanghai copper (+2.3%) has seen its largest one-day gain in 3 months off the back of restored US-China trade talks, with nickel (+2.6%) and zinc (+2.6%) also benefiting from the improved risk tone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The Street expects a hike of 425bps to 22.00%; anything less may disappoint traders</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RATES:&nbsp;</strong>Turkey&#39;s central bank is expected to lift its weekly repo rate to 22.00% from 17.75% (range of forecasts is between 20.00% on the low, and 25.00% on the high); the corridor between the overnight lending rate (currently 19.25%) and the overnight borrowing rate (currently 16.25%) is expected to be maintained at plus/minus 1.50% (respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts at Barclays are slightly beneath consensus, looking for 300bps of hikes, though acknowledges upside risks to its forecast with the CBT over-delivering with a much bigger policy hike, and adds &quot;should the CBT delay the return to a simplified monetary policy framework (i.e. continue funding at the o/n lending rate) and hike all policy rates by 150bp instead, markets are likely to be disappointed&quot; though the bank this the chances of such an outcome are low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>INFLATION:&nbsp;</strong>Recent inflation data showed CPI rising to 17.9% YY in August, while PPI surged to 32.1% YY with analysts noting that the underlying momentum suggests inflation could tick-up further in the months ahead. The data prompted the central bank to state that it will take measures to adjust its monetary policy stance, in order to improve price stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Headline inflation and core inflation indicators keep moving higher. CPI pressure is now broad based as nearly every sub-category continues to exhibit upside adjustments on monthly releases,&quot; TD Securities says. &quot;What makes the situation worse, Turkey is a clear standout case that in no way represents the normality in EMs; while EM CPI has been marginally on the rise in 2018, Turkey&#39;s inflation has totally decoupled from the trend since 2016,&quot; the bank says, adding &quot;in the past two and a half years, Turkey&#39;s CPI has tripled and continues to rise, highlighting how the nature of Turkey&#39;s price problems is fully home based.&quot; TD also notes that the current account remains troublesome, and estimates the CA deficit at around 7% of GDP, the largest in the world&#39;s top EM economies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRY:&nbsp;</strong>The lira, which has dropped by around 40% YTD, and some analysts have argued that it could be facing further downside ahead. &quot;Further depreciation is to be expected as inflation rises, economic growth slows down, and the CBRT FX reserves are eroded further,&quot; TD Securities observes. &quot;In order to stabilise the currency and restore financial market normalcy, the CBT will have to hike in excess of 175-180bps on Thursday.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MARKET REACTION:&nbsp;</strong>TD expects the CBT to lift rates by 275bps, which it says should support the lira in the short term (it says the TRY could see between 3-7% upside before the end of the week to around 6.00-6.25). However, if the central bank did not deliver at least 175bps of tightening, USDTRY could rise to 6.60-6.75, TD argues.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index and broad Dollar are softer post-US initiatives to resume formal trade discussions with China, but off lows and relatively side-lined ahead of US inflation data later. The DXY is attempting to nudge back up towards 95.000 from 94.767 at worst, as Usd/G10 pairings consolidate before Thursday&rsquo;s headline events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major outperformer and beneficiary of planned mediation on tariffs between Washington and Beijing, but still labouring on approaches or rebounds to 0.7200, even with the extra incentive of upbeat Aussie data overnight (August payrolls easily exceeded consensus and largely due to full time jobs). Note also, Aud/Usd flanked by hefty option expiry interest at 0.7220-30 (1 bn) and 0.7140-50 (1.1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to the bottom of the G10 pile on the aforementioned de-escalation of global protectionism tensions, and significantly stronger than expected Japanese machinery orders, with reported domestic offers at 111.50 revisited ahead of larger supply said to be lurking between 111.60-70, plus large option expiries between 111.50-65 (2.1 bn) in the mix .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP/NZD/EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback and awaiting more impetus/direction, with the Franc pivoting 0.9700 and barely noting Swiss producer/import price data, while Cable attempts to build a firmer footing above 1.3000 on latest positive Brexit deal headlines (Raab anticipating ramped up UK-EU negotiations soon) rather than any real prospect of support or adverse impulse from the BoE at noon. However, option expiries could also exert some influence given decent NY cut run-offs at 1.3000-15 (1 bn) and 1.3060 (1.3 bn). The Kiwi has extended its recovery from near 0.6500 to just above 0.6550 ahead of NZ manufacturing PMI tonight, and the single currency looks more comfortable over 1.1600 following more Italian reports and denials about Finance Minister Tria on the verge of resigning over budget disagreements, but will be looking for further impetus/direction from ECB President Draghi later. Flow-wise, 1.1600 and 1.1625 expiries (in 2 bn and 1bn respectively) could cap gains, and for the Loonie that is straddling 1.3000 upcoming Canadian new house price data will likely pale vs any fresh NAFTA developments as more talks are scheduled today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both slightly firmer vs the Eur, and with the Swedish Krona not unduly dented by downward revisions to Q2 GDP growth given that the Riksbank has already leaned back on its rate hike path.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira looks all set to grab the limelight at midday with anticipation/hype running rife for the CBRT rate decision amidst extremely wide-ranging estimates about the extent and manner of the flagged policy stance change. For the benchmark 1 week repo, forecasts span from unchanged to as much as +725 bp, while others suggest that the Bank may be more creative/subtle/restricted and tweak other official rates/corridors instead. Usd/Try poised around the middle of a 6.3385-3905 band in the run-up, while the Rand continues its impressive rebound towards 14.8000 vs the Usd on the softer Dollar overall, and with some independent encouragement from Moody&rsquo;s downplaying the threat of an SA ratings downgrade.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) were firmer with sentiment boosted by the more encouraging trade-related headlines and after the PBoC upped its liquidity efforts, while participants also digested lending data in which New Yuan Loans missed estimates although Aggregate Financing, which is the broadest measure for China&rsquo;s credit growth, topped forecasts.

This lifted most the regional bourses with Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) also euphoric on better than expected Machine Orders which grew at the fastest rate since January 2016, while ASX 200 (-0.5%) bucked the trend with financials dampened amid the banking royal commission where further unscrupulous practices were revealed. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) are firmer with sentiment boosted by the more encouraging trade-related headlines and after the PBoC upped its liquidity efforts, while participants also digest lending data in which New Yuan Loans missed estimates although Aggregate Financing, which is the broadest measure for China&rsquo;s credit growth, topped forecasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX price action has mostly quietened overnight with the DXY languishing below the 95.00 level after the prior day&rsquo;s soft PPI data and with its major counterparts EUR/USD and GBP/USD holding steady ahead of today&rsquo;s ECB and BoE policy decisions. Elsewhere, the increased risk appetite spurred some JPY outflows, while commodity-linked currencies remain firm amid the recent gains in the metals complex after the US reached out to China for discussions, with AUD/USD also briefly underpinned by better than expected jobs data before it later met resistance at the 0.7200 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat as focus centred on the region&rsquo;s riskier assets and with participants sidelined ahead of a 5yr auction later. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
