(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he is not happy with how talks went with China and that talks were a start, but he is not satisfied. US President Trump also stated there is no deal with China on ZTE and that he would like to see a large fine for the Co. which could be USD 1.3bln as well as a new board and management, while he also envisions ZTE being required to purchase large portion of their components from US companies. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross is planning to visit China in early June for trade talks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond said must deliver a Brexit that prioritises jobs, growth and prosperity, while he added that they must listen to businesses and that they expect further progress when EU leaders meet next month. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Governor Carney said the MPC doesn&#39;t think much of the lost Q1 growth due to poor weather will be made up, while he also commented that the majority of MPC are not in favor of publishing the rate path. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Vlieghe said his central projection will require one or two quarter point rate increases per year over the 3-year forecast period and that there are no material differences between his view of the economy and the MPC&#39;s collective view as published in the May QIR. BoE&#39;s Vlieghe also said he favours moving in the direction of being more explicit about the policy path and that it is expected that inflation is to return sustainably to target. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump Administration is said to consider a 10% cut in European steel and aluminium exports to the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian President Mattarella has not yet decided whether to give the PM role to Conte according to sources, while there were also reports that Italy 5SM leader Di Maio may be back in the running for the role of PM. Furthermore, League leader Salvini said Conte remains their PM candidate and would like Paolo Savona as Economy Minister. (Newswires/Repubblica)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM: A broad recovery on a combination of simple short covering and corrective trade amidst a pull-back in US Treasury yields lifted regional currencies off recent lows, and the Lira tracked moves early on to trade near 4.5400 vs the USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY: Choppy and mostly bearish trade due to the aforementioned retreat in UST yields, some waning of US-China trade time out euphoria and a broad rebound in major/EM counterparts. The index slipped back to sub-93.300 levels at one stage but appears to have steady the ship and back above 93.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF, CAD: Ending the EU session as G10 outperformers with the Franc seeing some safe-haven demand vs the USD and EUR (sub-0.9950 and just above 1.1700 respectively), latter on renewed Italian political factors. Meanwhile, the Loonie go another boost from new post-2014 peaks in crude prices and firmer than expected Canadian wholesale trade data to consolidate gains vs its US peer around 1.2750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, GBP, NZD, EUR, JPY: Narrowly mixed vs the Greenback and within wider parameters ploughed at various times. AUDUSD found the going heavy above and around 0.7600, while Cable topped out after getting to within striking distance of 1.3500 as hawkish views from BoE&rsquo;s Vlieghe were subsequently counterbalanced by the more neutral faction at the QIR TSC testimony, including Governor Carney. Next independent focus for the Pound is UK CPI on Wednesday. The Kiwi could not sustain comeback gains above 0.6950 and through 0.6975, as the AUDNZD cross firmed up again (over 1.0900 and almost to 1.0950), while the single currency also lost momentum and the 1.1800 handle. USDJPY was rangebound around 111.00 where heavy option expiry interest is housed through to Friday and with ongoing easing flagged by BoJ Governor Kuroda.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly Crude Stocks (18 May): -1.3mln (Exp. -1.600mln, Prev. +4.854mln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi, Russian and UAE oil ministers will discuss a controlled relaxation of the over-compliance seen with the OPEC+ production deal. Furthermore, reports added that the 3 ministers are due to meet in St. Petersburg this week and an early, full unwinding of OPEC cuts is not under consideration. (Argus)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC may decide to raise oil output in June due to concerns over Venezuela production decline and Iran oil shortages, according to OPEC and oil industry sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia&#39;s Energy Ministry said it does not rule out a global oil production cut deal will be stretched to 2019.

However, he also added that there is a substantial possibility that the summit with North Korea&#39;s Kim will not work out in June and that he is disappointed by the change in attitude of North Korea&#39;s Kim. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korean President Moon stated there is no doubt North Korea will hold a summit with the US, according to a South Korean government spokesperson.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, US equity futures price action has been horizontal with the S&amp;P 500 Emini was using the same playbook on Tuesday as it did on Monday; the overnight action was subdued in a tight range; at the cash open, ES tried to meaningfully break above 2740, but the air was thin, and we sold off to towards the middle of the range (roughly 2730 to slightly above 2740 &ndash; as it was on Monday). There was a general resilience to geopolitical headlines, as well moves in other asset classes, though the bottom-end of the range was tested in late trade, and ES made its way back towards 2720 in the closing minutes of trade. In sectors, consumer discretionary remained in the red amid disappointing earnings from Kohl&rsquo;s (KSS) and Toll Brothers (TOL) which suffered losses of more than 6%, dragging into negative territory its peers, Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI). Automakers (F, GM, FCAU) were lifted after China is to cut tariffs on some autos parts to 15% from 25%, though the industrial sector was lagging for the session. In equity specific stories, Micron (MU) led the S&amp;P after launching a USD 10bln share repurchase programme and after entering a deal with Intel (INTC), immediately followed by TJX Companies (TJX) on the back of strong earnings figures and by Fifth Thirds (FITB), which was upgraded at Baird and Macquarie. Elsewhere, Lowe&rsquo;s (LOW) named JC Penney CEO Marvin Ellison as President and CEO. SPX -0.3%% at 2724, NDX -0.2% at 6893, DJI -0.7% at 24834.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were marginally lower at settlement, as the yield curve saw some very modest steepening, with yields higher by less than 1bps across the curve. In European trade, bunds were driving the fixed income complex as safe haven flows gyrated in response to Italian political headlines. In the US, although Treasury volume was okay, Treasuries traded in a c.7 tick range ahead of the FOMC minutes tomorrow. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 1 tick higher at 118-28.</p>\r\n",

This followed earlier reports that Japan and Russia told the WTO about possible aluminium and steel tariffs retaliation, with Russia looking to impose USD 538mln and Japan USD 440mln in tariffs on US goods. US Treasury Mnuchin stated that tariffs on steel and aluminium will remain in force against China. This follows his comments over the weekend, when Mnuchin said that tariffs would be &quot;on hold&quot; but it wasn&#39;t clear whether he meant the retaliatory tariffs or the steel and aluminium tariffs which were already being enforced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*GEOPOLITICS: US President Trump believes North Korea leader Kim is serious about denuclearisation, thou cast some doubt on whether or not the June meeting will go ahead. Trump also added that things are moving along on the summit and noting there is no deal with China with ZTE. In later trade, South Korea&#39;s Moon said there is no doubt North Korea will hold a summit with the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* ITALIAN POLITICS: Italy&rsquo;s President Mattarella requested more time to decide on the new Premier, after he raised concerns over the 5SM/League fiscal plan, with a decision set to come on Wednesday or on Thursday. Currently PM candidate Conte is the front-runner for the position, though earlier reports indicated uncertainty over his candidacy, that were soon after dismissed. Later in the session, it was said that M5S leader Di Maio may be back in the running for the role of PM. Elsewhere, &nbsp;M5S leader Di Maio and League leader Salvini reportedly considering to be naming Savona Economy Minister, who has previously held critical positions on the EUR currency and EU as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* BANK OF ENGLAND: BoE&#39;s Vlieghe (Neutral/Hawk) says his central projection will require one or two quarter point rate increases per year over the three year forecast period, adding that there are no material differences between his view of the economy and the MPC&#39;s collective view as published in the May QIR; analysts noted that this was a more aggressive path than the BoE&#39;s conditioning path of rates derived from yields in the May QIR, which assumes just under three 0.25% rate increases over the three-year forecast horizon. Vlieghe also said he favours issuing more explicit guidance about the policy path, adding that in his judgement, the advantages outweigh the risks and that such change would represent a further, modest, evolutionary improvement in communications. BoE&#39;s Carney (Neutral), speaking after Vlieghe, said the majority of MPC are not in favour of publishing the rate path. Elsewhere, Carney reiterated that the Q1 growth slowdown is likely due to idiosyncratic and temporary factors, but it is right to wait for more data, though he added that the MPC does not think much of the lost Q1 growth due to poor weather will be made up. BoE&#39;s Carney says if Brexit transition deal doesn&#39;t come to fruition, it could have a considerable economic impact. BoE&#39;s Saunders (Hawk) says its might be useful to talk more about where neutral level of rates is, while Carney expects to report more on neutral level of UK interest rates in August inflation report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* ECB SPEAK: ECB&#39;s Liikanen said it will take time for core inflation to provide support to headline inflation and expects rates to remain low for an extended period after QE ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.3%% at 2724, NDX -0.2% at 6893, DJI -0.7% at 24834.&nbsp;SECTORS:&nbsp;Cons Cyclicals -0.32%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.16%, Energy: -1.33%, Financials: +0.66%, Health Care: -0.23%, Industrials: -1.04%, Materials: -0.73%, Telecom: +0.28%, Tech: -0.20%, Utilities: +0.34%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, US equity futures price action has been horizontal on Monday; the S&amp;P 500 Emini was using the same playbook on Tuesday as it did on Monday; the overnight action was subdued in a tight range; at the cash open, ES tried to meaningfully break above 2740, but the air was thin, and we sold off to towards the middle of the range (roughly 2730 to slightly above 2740 &ndash; as it was on Monday). There was a general resilience to geopolitical headlines, as well moves in other asset classes, though the bottom-end of the range was tested in late trade, and ES made its way back towards 2720 in the closing minutes of trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sectors, consumer discretionary remained in the red amid disappointing earnings from Kohl&rsquo;s (KSS) and Toll Brothers (TOL) which suffered losses of more than 6%, dragging into negative territory its peers, Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI). Automakers (F, GM, FCAU) were lifted after China is to cut tariffs on some autos parts to 15% from 25%, though the industrial sector was lagging for the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In equity specific stories, Micron (MU) led the S&amp;P after launching a USD 10bln share repurchase programme and after entering a deal with Intel (INTC), immediately followed by TJX Companies (TJX) on the back of strong earnings figures and by Fifth Thirds (FITB), which was upgraded at Baird and MacQuarie. Elsewhere, Lowe&rsquo;s (LOW) named JC Penney CEO Marvin Ellison as President and CEO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In M&amp;A news, Adobe (ADB) was said to be acquiring Magento Commerce from private equity Permira for USD 1.68bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*CRUDE: WTI futures (for June) settle 11 cents lower at USD 72.13 per barrel, Brent futures (for July) settle 35 cents higher at USD 79.57/bbl. It was a mixed session for crude, with Brent popping its head above $80/bbl again as Venezuelan supply concerns lend support, exacerbated by continued tensions with Iran which is staring down the barrel of US sanctions. There were also supportive comments from OPEC officials; Saudi, Russian and UAE oil ministers will discuss a controlled relaxation of the over-compliance seen with the OPEC+ production deal, according to Argus, who also reported that an early, full unwinding of OPEC cuts is not under consideration. Later, sources reported that OPEC may decide to raise oil output in June for some members due to concerns over Venezuela production decline and Iran oil shortages. Russia did not rule out global oil production cut deal with be extended into 2019. Meanwhile, Ecuador&rsquo;s oil minister said the country will continue to support the OPEC decision to keep production cuts. However, the crude complex was negative ticks in afternoon trade, after US President Donald Trump sounded a tone of caution with regards to North Korea, lending some doubt to the possibility of a meeting in June with Kim Jong-un, which saw gains given back in crude, with WTI going red. After the bell, the API will report energy inventories; analysts expect crude stocks to draw by 1.6mln, distillate stocks to draw by 1.3mln, gasoline stocks seen drawing 1.4mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*TREASURIES: US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 1 tick higher at 118-28. Treasuries were marginally lower at settlement, as &nbsp;the yield curve saw some very modest steepening, with yields higher by less than 1bps across the curve. In European trade, bunds were driving the fixed income complex as safe haven flows gyrated in response to Italian political headlines. In the US, although Treasury volume was okay, Treasuries traded in a c.7 tick range ahead of the FOMC minutes tomorrow. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury sold 33bln in 2yr notes, stopping through by 0.5bps at a yield of 2.590%, the highest since 2008. Dealers were awarded a share of 45.4%, the highest since December whilst indirects were awarded the smallest portion since 2016 at 39.3%.The bid-to-cover came at 2.88, well above the 6-auction average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tomorrow the US auctions 5-year notes. Recent auctions in the 5-year sector have been very close to the 1pm WI levels, leading some to expect another good showing on Wednesday; last month&rsquo;s auction saw the highest stop-out rate at a 5-year auction since 2008, though cover was soft, and foreigners&rsquo; participation was the smallest since September. The latest positioning data indicates that dealers have trimmed their holdings in the 3-6 year bucket, according to Societe Generale, to USD 12.3bln, lowest since April. &ldquo;The current 5-year note is trading fair on both Treasury spline versus old 5s and on the curve relative to the 2s and 10s,&rdquo; SocGen writes. The bank holds a slightly positive bias provided some outright and curve concession is seen before the auction deadline. SocGen notes, however, that the higher auction amount is a negative, but the cheap outright levels (with the 5-year yield is currently trading above all the 5y auction stops since September 2008) and that should support the auction takedown</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FOREX: EM: A broad recovery on a combination of simple short covering and corrective trade amidst a pull-back in US Treasury yields lifted regional currencies off recent lows, and the Lira tracked moves early on to trade near 4.5400 vs the USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY: Choppy and mostly bearish trade due to the aforementioned retreat in UST yields, some waning of US-China trade time out euphoria and a broad rebound in major/EM counterparts. The index slipped back to sub-93.300 levels at one stage but appears to have steady the ship and back above 93.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF, CAD: Ending the EU session as G10 outperformers with the Franc seeing some safe-haven demand vs the USD and EUR (sub-0.9950 and just above 1.1700 respectively), latter on renewed Italian political factors. Meanwhile, the Loonie go another boost from new post-2014 peaks in crude prices and firmer than expected Canadian wholesale trade data to consolidate gains vs its US peer around 1.2750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, GBP, NZD, EUR, JPY: Narrowly mixed vs the Greenback and within wider parameters ploughed at various times. AUDUSD found the going heavy above and around 0.7600, while Cable topped out after getting to within striking distance of 1.3500 as hawkish views from BoE&rsquo;s Vlieghe were subsequently counterbalanced by the more neutral faction at the QIR TSC testimony, including Governor Carney. Next independent focus for the Pound is UK CPI on Wednesday. The Kiwi could not sustain comeback gains above 0.6950 and through 0.6975, as the AUDNZD cross firmed up again (over 1.0900 and almost to 1.0950), while the single currency also lost momentum and the 1.1800 handle. USDJPY was rangebound around 111.00 where heavy option expiry interest is housed through to Friday and with ongoing easing flagged by BoJ Governor Kuroda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*COMING UP: FOMC May 2018 Meeting Minutes due at at 1900 BST/1400 EDT. FOMC held rates in May, but tweaked its guidance on inflation. Elsewhere, comments on natural rate and the yield curve will be of note. The release isn&rsquo;t expected to be a major market mover, though may have a hawkish tilt. For the full preview click here.</p>\r\n",

Later, Russia did not rule out global oil production cut deal with be extended into 2019. Meanwhile, Ecuador&rsquo;s oil minister said the country will continue to support the OPEC decision to keep production cuts. However, the crude complex was negative ticks in afternoon trade, after US President Donald Trump sounded a tone of caution with regards to North Korea, lending some doubt to the possibility of a meeting in June with Kim Jong-un, which saw gains given back in crude, with WTI going red. After the bell, the API will report energy inventories; analysts expect crude stocks to draw by 1.6mln, distillate stocks to draw by 1.3mln, gasoline stocks seen drawing 1.4mln.</p>\r\n",

With a total of USD 70.6bln maturing, the auction will raise net USD 44.4bln in the week. The last auction, in April, was poor; the line was covered just 2.61x, below the 6-auction average of 2.81x, the auction also tailed by 0.5bps and dealers were left with a larger than average chunk of the issuance. Soc Gen are cautious ahead of the auction. &ldquo;The 2y sector does not seem to have a set-up for the upcoming auction from relative value perspective, with the current 2y note trading rich on both the Treasury spline versus old 2s and on the curve versus the 1y and 3y sectors,&rdquo; the bank writes. The increased auction size could also be a negative although they also note that the auction could benefit from cheap outright levels.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, other source reports noted that the side were nearing an agreement that would remove ban on ZTE and would include China pledge to remove tariffs on, as well as increase imports of, US agricultural products. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said on Monday that he still sees the need of real work to achieve changes in China and noted that intellectual property issues are more important than the trade gap.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian stocks traded mostly subdued amid holiday closures and a lack of fresh catalysts, which saw sentiment wane from the prior day&rsquo;s trade-related gains that boosted the DJIA above the 25k level for the first time since March. ASX 200 (-0.7%) weakened amid broad losses across all sectors and with telecoms underperforming on continued woes for Telstra shares, while Healthscope was the worst performer after it flagged impairment charges. Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) traded indecisive as exporters suffered from a firmer currency and with Sony shares pressured after its 3-year strategy and targets was met with disappointment, while Shanghai Comp. (flat) was subdued following a continued net neutral liquidity position by the PBoC and with market closures in both Hong Kong and South Korea adding to the humdrum tone, although baby-related stocks were underpinned on prospects China could relax its child-policy restrictions. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lacklustre alongside an indecisive risk tone in Japan and with participants side-lined ahead of 20yr auction which eventually saw a mixed result, while a deluge of comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda also failed to spur price action as he kept to reiterations and suggested the BoJ is still far from an exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 7-day and CNY 50bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net neutral daily position.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda said will take into consideration side effects including impact on financial institutions when guiding monetary policy currently, while he added that he is not seeing conditions rife to study timing of exit and that the BoJ will not exit easy policy prior to reaching 2% price target. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Vlieghe (Neutral) says his central projection will require one or two quarter point rate increases per year over the three-year forecast period. This is a more aggressive path than the BoE&#39;s conditioning path of rates derived from yields in the May QIR which assumes just under three quarter point rate increases over the three-year forecast period. (BoE)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Carney (Neutral) reiterates that Q1 slowdown is likely due to idiosyncratic and temporary factors, but it is right to wait&nbsp;for more data.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (non-voter, dove) said wage growth has not picked up and that there may still be slack in the jobs market, while he also suggested the need to allow the economy to continue strengthening.

(ANSA) In related news, Italy&#39;s President Mattarella reportedly expressed concerns with the 5SM/League fiscal plan and is said to need time to mull the PM choice. Furthermore, Mattarella was reported to demand leaders of Italy&rsquo;s Lower and Upper House to attend a meeting on Tuesday. There were reports that President Mattarella could pick the new Premier on Wednesday or Thursday. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB is purchasing the same amount of Italian government bonds under QE programme, as according to traders at primary dealers. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European equity bourses are trading flat as German traders return to their desks following a public holiday. The outperforming bourse is currently the IBEX (+0.6%), closely followed by the FTSE MIB (+0.4%) which is benefitting from some much desired political &#39;stability&#39; following the confirmation of the name of the proposed next Premier, Giuseppe Conte; subject to approval from Mattarella.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European automotive names have been boosted on the news that China is to cut their car import duties to 15% from 25% (Volkswagen (VOW3 GY) +1.0%, Daimler (DAI GY) +1.2%, BMW (BMW GY) +1.9%). In terms of sector specifics, France&rsquo;s head of ARCEP saying he could be open to telecom sector consolidation has lead to strength for names such as Orange (ORA FP) +3.5%, Bouygues (EN FP) +3.6% and Iliad (ILD FP) +4.4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stock specific news IAG (IAG LN) is set to offer NOK 330/share for Norwegian Air, an acquisition amounting to EUR 1.52bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More retracement from best levels for the index amidst a broad Usd pull-back vs counterparts that looks more technical than fundamental at this stage overall. The DXY is trying to stabilise after a dip below 93.300, but remains well off the 94.064 ytd peak set on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just shading the non-US dollars as top G10 performer after the first session of the BoE&rsquo;s QIR testimony in front of the TSC featuring MPC member Vlieghe who delivered a more hawkish policy outlook than the mainstream with a preference for 1 to 2 quarter point hikes per annum over the 3 year forecast horizon (largely based on less slack in the UK economy). Cable extended recovery gains above 1.3400 in response and almost reached 1.3500 before losing momentum ahead of Governor Carney&rsquo;s appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted, all gleaning more from the general Greenback retreat, with the Kiwi back above 0.6950 and Aud briefly revisiting 0.7600+ territory as the Loonie tested 1.2750 with oil prices providing another boost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firmer vs the Usd, albeit to a lesser extent than other majors. Eur/Usd has reclaimed 1.1800 and Usd/Chf is further below parity, while Usd/Jpy is pivoting around 111.00 amidst more dovish comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda and the conflicting risk-on climate on balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consolidation, short-covering and position paring from arguably oversold levels have combined to lift beleaguered currencies from the depths, with the Zar and Mxn regaining various degrees of composure around 12.20 vs 12.69 and 19.74 vs 19.84 (and even high in some cases at worst). However, after a similar recovery rally the Try suffered an abrupt reversal to plumb fresh record lows vs. the dollar circa 4.63.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have both retreated further from early intraday highs as the inverse correlation with none-core counterparts continues (BTPs maintained enough momentum to trade at 133.14 before topping out again), but with UK fixed also undermined by unexpectedly hawkish vibes from BoE&rsquo;s Vlieghe. The 10 year UK benchmark dropped to 121.28 at one stage (-44 ticks vs +5 ticks at the other end of the Liffe spectrum), while the German equivalent hit 158.74 (-1/2 point vs +19 ticks at the high). Meanwhile, US Treasuries are essentially flat and resisting all the ups and downs elsewhere ahead of the first of this week&rsquo;s supply and with bigger US-specific fish to fry later this week (like FOMC minutes tomorrow).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are broadly higher during recent trade in which crude extended on gains boosted by a softer greenback with geopolitics also remaining at the fore after US Secretary of State Pompeo warned of the severity for Iran sanctions. The US also imposed sanctions on Venezuela following the election last weekend, stirring further fears over supply disruption in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold prices are buoyed as the dollar retreats from YTD highs. Elsewhere, London copper rise for the second day with prices underpinned as the US-Sino trade war fears fade (for now).</p>\r\n",

The outperforming bourse is currently the FTSE MIB (+0.8%) which is benefitting from some much desired political &#39;stability&#39; following the confirmation of the name of the proposed next Premier, Giuseppe Conte; subject to approval from Mattarella .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European automotive names have been boosted on the news that China is to cut their car import duties to 15% from 25% (Volkswagen (VOW3 GY) +0.8%, Daimler (DAI GY) +1.0%, BMW (BMW GY) +1.0%). In terms of sector specifics, France&rsquo;s head of ARCEP saying he could be open to telecom sector consolidation has lead to strength for names such as Orange (ORA FP) +2.5% , Bouygues (EN FP) +2.7% and Iliad (ILD FP) +4.6%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stock specific news IAG (IAG LN) is set to offer NOK 330/share for Norwegian Air, an acquisition amounting to EUR 1.52bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are broadly higher during recent trade in which crude extended on gains boosted by a softer greenback with geopolitics also remaining at the fore after US Secretary of State Pompeo warned of the severity for Iran sanctions. The US also imposed sanctions on Venezuela following the election last weekend, stirring further fears over supply disruption in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold prices are buoyed as the dollar retreats from YTD highs. Elsewhere, London copper rise for the second day with prices underpinned as the US-Sino trade war fears fade (for now).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More retracement from best levels for the index amidst a broad Usd pull-back vs counterparts that looks more technical than fundamental at this stage overall. The DXY is trying to stabilise after a dip below 93.300, but remains well off the 94.064 ytd peak set on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just shading the non-US dollars as top G10 performer after the first session of the BoE&rsquo;s QIR testimony in front of the TSC featuring MPC member Vlieghe who delivered a more hawkish policy outlook than the mainstream with a preference for 1 to 2 quarter point hikes per annum over the 3 year forecast horizon (largely based on less slack in the UK economy). Cable extended recovery gains above 1.3400 in response and almost reached 1.3500 before losing momentum ahead of Governor Carney&rsquo;s appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted, all gleaning more from the general Greenback retreat, with the Kiwi back above 0.6950 and Aud briefly revisiting 0.7600+ territory as the Loonie tested 1.2750 with oil prices providing another boost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firmer vs the Usd, albeit to a lesser extent than other majors. Eur/Usd has reclaimed 1.1800 and Usd/Chf is further below parity, while Usd/Jpy is pivoting around 111.00 amidst more dovish comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda and the conflicting risk-on climate on balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consolidation, short-covering and position paring from arguably oversold levels have combined to lift beleaguered currencies from the depths, with the Try, Zar and Mxn all regaining various degrees of composure around 4.55 vs circa 4.60, 12.20 vs 12.69 and 19.74 vs 19.84 (and even high in some cases at worst).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have both retreated further from early intraday highs as the inverse correlation with none-core counterparts continues (BTPs maintained enough momentum to trade at 133.14 before topping out again), but with UK fixed also undermined by unexpectedly hawkish vibes from BoE&rsquo;s Vlieghe. The 10 year UK benchmark dropped to 121.28 at one stage (-44 ticks vs +5 ticks at the other end of the Liffe spectrum), while the German equivalent hit 158.74 (-1/2 point vs +19 ticks at the high). Meanwhile, US Treasuries are essentially flat and resisting all the ups and downs elsewhere ahead of the first of this week&rsquo;s supply and with bigger US-specific fish to fry later this week (like FOMC minutes tomorrow).</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were quiet amid a sparse calendar and with no tier-1 data releases scheduled overnight. As such, the major currency pairs traded range-bound and the DXY was sideways around 93.50 following its recent pullback from YTD highs. Elsewhere, EUR/USD was contained by resistance at 1.1800 and GBP/USD languished amid the ongoing Brexit-related impasse, with markets also awaiting a slew of BoE speakers which dominates the European morning schedule including Governor Carney. USD/JPY marginally extended below the 111.00 handle following the USD-pullback and safe-haven flows to JPY, while commodity-linked currencies held near the prior day&rsquo;s best levels after oil prices hit fresh multi-year highs last seen in 2014.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed in which crude extended on gains to print fresh highs last seen in 2014 with geopolitics remaining at the fore after US Secretary of State Pompeo warned of the severity for Iran sanctions, while the US also imposed sanctions on Venezuela following the election last weekend. Elsewhere, gold was subdued and retreated from last week&rsquo;s resistance levels, while copper mirrored the lacklustre risk tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump signed order on Venezuela preventing the selling-off of Venezuelan accounts receivable related to oil, according to a senior US Official.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yield curve flattened modestly on Monday with most of the action concentrated in the short end of the curve, 2yr yields were higher by c.2bps amid some of Europe away from market and ahead of Fed minutes this week. 2s5s and 2s10s were narrower by c.1bps at settlement. The sell-off was helped by positive news on the US-China front, though ranges and volumes were thin for the session. This week the&nbsp; US will auction 2s, 5s and 7s. The US Treasury increased the auction sizes at the most recent refunding announcement and will auction a total of USD 115bln in 2-year notes (USD 33bln, today), 5-year notes (USD 36bln, Wednesday) and 7-year notes (USD 30bln, Thursday), as well as 2y FRNs (USD 16bln, Wednesday) this week. With a total of USD 70.6bln maturing, the auction will raise net USD 44.4bln in the week. The last auction, in April, was poor; the line was covered just 2.61x, below the 6-auction average of 2.81x, the auction also tailed by 0.5bps and dealers were left with a larger than average chunk of the issuance. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 10+ ticks higher at 118-27.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bostic (voter, dovish) said he sees 2 more rate hikes in 2018 and that it remains to be seen how much slack remains in the US economy.

Harker also said he favours pausing hikes once the Fed has hit neutral rates, while he later provided a conflicting remark that he would support three more hikes in 2018 if inflation is sustained at current levels. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (non-voter, dove) said wage growth has not picked up and that there may still be slack in the jobs market, while he also suggested the need to allow the economy to continue strengthening.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade mostly subdued amid holiday closures and a lack of fresh catalysts, with sentiment waning from the prior day&rsquo;s trade-related gains which had helped boost the DJIA above the 25k level for the first time since March. ASX 200 (-0.9%) is weaker amid broad losses across all sectors and with telecoms underperforming on continued woes for Telstra shares, while Healthscope is the worst performer after it rejected takeover bids and flagged impairment charges. Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) is downbeat as exporters suffer from a firmer currency and with Sony shares pressured as its 3-year strategy and targets was met with disappointment, while Shanghai Comp. is also weaker following a continued net neutral liquidity position by the PBoC and with market closures in both Hong Kong and South Korea adding to the humdrum tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are quiet amid a sparse calendar and with no tier-1 data releases scheduled overnight. As such, the major currency pairs are range-bound and the DXY is sideways around 93.50 following its recent pullback from YTD highs. Elsewhere, EUR/USD is contained by resistance at 1.1800 and GBP/USD languishes amid ongoing Brexit-related cabinet infighting, with markets also awaiting a slew of BoE speakers which dominates the European morning schedule including Governor Carney. USD/JPY marginally extends further below the 111.00 handle following the USD-pullback and safe-haven flows to JPY, while commodity-linked currencies have held near the prior day&rsquo;s best levels after oil prices hit fresh multi-year highs last seen in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lacklustre with participants side-lined ahead of a 20yr auction later, while a deluge of comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda also failed to spur price action as he kept to reiterations and suggested BoJ is far from exit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
