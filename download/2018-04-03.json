Perhaps the buck was following Treasury yields higher (although major curve spreads actually flattened), or perhaps it was the rise in TIPS yields. Or perhaps it was due to softer Eurozone PMIs, keeping the single currency under pressure. The backed-off the 1.23 level that was proving magnetic in recent trade after stops were tripped around 1.2280, seeing EURUSD find lows around 1.2260. The net impact was GBP seeing some upside against the EUR, and less so against the USD. CAD found strength following positive NAFTA headlines on Monday, sending the Loonie to test the bottom-end of its recent range; the 1.28 level was breached, but USDCAD managed to bring its head back above the level. High-beta FX also benefited from the better risk tone.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Inventories (29 Mar) -3.280M vs. Exp. 0.200M (Prev. 5.321M).

The SPX&rsquo;s 200dma &ndash; which had been a strong support through the slides earlier this year &ndash; was the focal point of price action, before stocks climbed in later trade after news that the White House is not holding talks regarding action against Amazon (AMZN), which saw other major indices rise in sympathy. Additionally, ahead of the upcoming Q2 earnings season, analysts are optimistic on the outlook. In stock specific news, Viacom (VIAB) weighed on the SPX &amp; NDX following reports that CBS (CBS) is considering an all stock offer for the company which values them under its current market valuation. Tesla (TSLA) led the NDX higher on Tuesday, rebounding some of the stocks previous losses on reports that Q1 production was up 40% Q/Q, with 2020 Model 3 vehicles being made within the last 7 days, and it expects this trend to carry on in the next week. Further, it stated by addressing bottlenecks Model 3 production rate will be able to double this quarter. SPX +1.27% at 2614 , NDX +1.06% at 6459, DJI +1.63% at 24030.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields along the Treasury curve are higher on Tuesday by between 3.5bps and 5bps, with most of the moves being seen in the belly of the curve. Major curve spreads only saw modest steepening, however, remain only slightly of recent narrows. Volume was slightly better on Tuesday&rsquo;s subdued showing. Most of the action was centred around the European and US opens, where large block trades in TYM8 catalysed selling pressures, while sellers were also encouraged by better risk sentiment, equities rebounding, and a few chunky corporate issuance announcements, while vehicle sales beats from the Big Three manufacturers also was being cited. Some note that the TPLEX will take its cue from inflation headlines in the weeks/months ahead (absent any haven bid), and as such, attention moves towards NFP data at the end of the week (specifically wages) as well as comments due from Fed Chair Powell on Friday. US T-Notes (June) settled 13+ ticks lower at 120-27.</p>\r\n",

The SPX&rsquo;s 200dma &ndash; which has been a strong support through the slides earlier this year &ndash; was the focal point of price action, before stocks climbed in later trade after news that the White House is not holding talks regarding action against Amazon (AMZN), which saw other major indices rise in sympathy. Additionally, ahead of the upcoming Q2 earnings season, analysts are optimistic on the outlook. In stock specific news, Viacom (VIAB) weighed on the SPX &amp; NDX following reports that CBS (CBS) is considering an all stock offer for the company which values them under its current market valuation. Tesla (TSLA) led the NDX higher on Tuesday, rebounding some of the stocks previous losses on reports that Q1 production was up 40% Q/Q, with 2020 Model 3 vehicles being made within the last 7 days, and it expects this trend to carry on in the next week. Further, it stated by addressing bottlenecks Model 3 production rate will be able to double this quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Notes (June) settle 13+ ticks lower at 120-27.</strong><br />Yields along the Treasury curve are higher on Tuesday by between 3.5bps and 5bps, with most of the moves being seen in the belly of the curve. Major curve spreads only saw modest steepening, however, remain only slightly of recent narrows. Volume was slightly better on Tuesday&rsquo;s subdued showing. Most of the action was centred around the European and US opens, where large block trades in TYM8 catalysed selling pressures, while sellers were also encouraged by better risk sentiment, equities rebounding, and a few chunky corporate issuance announcements, while vehicle sales beats from the Big Three manufacturers also was being cited. Some note that the TPLEX will take its cue from inflation headlines in the weeks/months ahead (absent any haven bid), and as such, attention moves towards NFP data at the end of the week (specifically wages) as well as comments due from Fed Chair Powell on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY +0.2% heading into APAC trade.</strong><br />While in recent weeks <strong>USD</strong> strength has come hand-in-hand with risk-off sentiment, the USD managed to modestly rally on Tuesday amid a more constructive risk environment. Perhaps the buck was following Treasury yields higher (although major curve spreads actually flattened), or perhaps it was the rise in TIPS yields. Or perhaps it was due to softer Eurozone PMIs, keeping the single currency under pressure. The backed-off the 1.23 level that was proving magnetic in recent trade after stops were tripped around 1.2280, seeing EURUSD find lows around 1.2260. The net impact was GBP seeing some upside against the EUR, and less so against the USD. CAD found strength following positive NAFTA headlines on Monday, sending the Loonie to test the bottom-end of its recent range; the 1.28 level was breached, but USDCAD managed to bring its head back above the level. High-beta FX also benefited from the better risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures (May) settle 50 cents higher at USD 63.51 per barrel, June contract settles 47 cents higher at 63.46 per barrel; Brent futures (June) settle 48 cents higher at USD 68.12/bbl</strong><br />Oil was supported by better risk sentiment and positive news flow, shrugging-off the USD strength seen in flashes over the course of the session. Russia said it will trim oil production levels in early April after yesterday&rsquo;s news that it pumped 10.97mln BPD in March, overtaking the US to take the mantle as the world&rsquo;s largest producer. Russian energy minister Novak also alluded to the possible creation of an amalgamated OPEC/non-OPEC organisation, as has been floated by others recently. Elsewhere, According to Petro Logistics, OPEC Q1 output has fallen to the lowest level since the beginning of the supply cut deal, with production in Q1 425k fewer than the average daily supply for 2017 as a whole. In Norway, the largest labour union has threatened industrial action, potentially seeing 37k oil workers strike. After the bell, API will report energy inventories for the week. The Street expects headline crude stocks to build by 200k, distillate stocks are seen drawing by 1.1mln barrels, and gasoline stocks are seen declining by 1.3mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The SPX&rsquo;s 200dma &ndash; which has been a strong support through the slides earlier this year &ndash; was the focal point of price action, before stocks climbed in later trade after news that the White House is not holding talks regarding action against Amazon (AMZN), which saw other major indices rise in sympathy. Additionally, ahead of the upcoming Q2 earnings season, analysts are optimistic on the outlook. In stock specific news, Viacom (VIAB) weighed on the SPX &amp; NDX following reports that CBS (CBS) is considering an all stock offer for the company which values them under its current market valuation. Tesla (TSLA) led the NDX higher on Tuesday, rebounding some of the stocks previous losses on reports that Q1 production was up 40% Q/Q, with 2020 Model 3 vehicles being made within the last 7 days, and it expects this trend to carry on in the next week. Further, it stated by addressing bottlenecks Model 3 production rate will be able to double this quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Notes (June) settle 13+ ticks lower at 120-27.</strong><br />Yields along the Treasury curve are higher on Tuesday by between 3.5bps and 5bps, with most of the moves being seen in the belly of the curve. Major curve spreads only saw modest steepening, however, remain only slightly of recent narrows. Volume was slightly better on Tuesday&rsquo;s subdued showing. Most of the action was centred around the European and US opens, where large block trades in TYM8 catalysed selling pressures, while sellers were also encouraged by better risk sentiment, equities rebounding, and a few chunky corporate issuance announcements, while vehicle sales beats from the Big Three manufacturers also was being cited. Some note that the TPLEX will take its cue from inflation headlines in the weeks/months ahead (absent any haven bid), and as such, attention moves towards NFP data at the end of the week (specifically wages) as well as comments due from Fed Chair Powell on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY +0.2% heading into APAC trade.</strong><br />While in recent weeks <strong>USD</strong> strength has come hand-in-hand with risk-off sentiment, the USD managed to modestly rally on Tuesday amid a more constructive risk environment. Perhaps the buck was following Treasury yields higher (although major curve spreads actually flattened), or perhaps it was the rise in TIPS yields. Or perhaps it was due to softer Eurozone PMIs, keeping the single currency under pressure. The backed-off the 1.23 level that was proving magnetic in recent trade after stops were tripped around 1.2280, seeing EURUSD find lows around 1.2260. The net impact was GBP seeing some upside against the EUR, and less so against the USD. CAD found strength following positive NAFTA headlines on Monday, sending the Loonie to test the bottom-end of its recent range; the 1.28 level was breached, but USDCAD managed to bring its head back above the level. High-beta FX also benefited from the better risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures (May) settle 50 cents higher at USD 63.51 per barrel, June contract settles 47 cents higher at 63.46 per barrel; Brent futures (June) settle 48 cents higher at USD 68.12/bbl</strong><br />Oil was supported by better risk sentiment and positive news flow, shrugging-off the USD strength seen in flashes over the course of the session. Russia said it will trim oil production levels in early April after yesterday&rsquo;s news that it pumped 10.97mln BPD in March, overtaking the US to take the mantle as the world&rsquo;s largest producer. Russian energy minister Novak also alluded to the possible creation of an amalgamated OPEC/non-OPEC organisation, as has been floated by others recently. Elsewhere, According to Petro Logistics, OPEC Q1 output has fallen to the lowest level since the beginning of the supply cut deal, with production in Q1 425k fewer than the average daily supply for 2017 as a whole. In Norway, the largest labour union has threatened industrial action, potentially seeing 37k oil workers strike. After the bell, API will report energy inventories for the week.

Conversely, Australian stocks then recovered as mining stocks and energy names outperformed. <strong>Hang Seng (+0.3%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) </strong>conformed to the tech-related losses and after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations for an 8th consecutive occasion, while markets in Hong Kong also took their 1st opportunity to react to China&rsquo;s tariffs on US products and reports of the government pressuring banks to halt local government lending. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as they tracked the prior session&rsquo;s gains in T-notes amid the risk-averse tone, while the 10yr JGB auction results were inconclusive with the results mixed as the b/c fell but accepted prices surged from prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Liikanen has emerged as a potential compromise candidate for the ECB President role. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda said the bank is internally discussing an exit from current monetary policy but will not communicate it with the markets until policy normalising timing draws near. He added the BoJ will patiently continue easing of current monetary policy as there is still a distance to the price target. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBA kept the Cash Rate Target unchanged at 1.50% as expected and reiterated that steady policy is consistent with growth and inflation goals.</strong> RBA also repeated that a strengthening currency would result to slower pace of economic pick-up but that the currency remains in the range seen prior years, while it also commented that inflation likely to stay low for some time.

The tech sell-off rolled over from the previous sessions with the sector currently underperforming. Semi-conductors are amongst the worst performers as names take a hit on the news that Apple is looking to steer away from Intel chips to create their own by 2020. On the flip side, Barclays was initially higher after reports the bank is planning a multi-million GBP share buyback. Miners are amongst the top performers after feeling the boost from firmer base metal prices. Finally, Sky (+1.3%) is at the top of the FTSE 100 amid news that Fox is offering to sell Sky News to Disney as it seeks to obtain regulatory clearings for its proposed takeover of Sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Dollar remains on the back foot amidst heighted US vs China tit-for-tat import tariff impositions, but off worst levels vs G10 and other major counterparts to leave the Index close to the 90.000 mark within a 89.850-90.070 approximate range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the more lively currencies as EU markets return from their extended Easter break amidst some mixed and contradictory comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda (at least in terms of the wire headline interpretations). He initially underscored easy policy guidance and appeared to quell any speculation about an exit given that inflation is still some distance from target, but then revealed that internal discussions about unwinding the balance sheet and raising rates are underway, though nothing will be communicated to the markets until such time that economic growth and prices are right.

Gilts continue to outperform or rather hold up better between 122.75-123.00 Liffe parameters despite a better than anticipated UK manufacturing PMI vs mixed Eurozone releases that ultimately left the pan unchanged from the flash estimate. As noted earlier, respective closing times look to be partially at play in terms of Bunds lagging their UK equivalent or vice-versa, but technicals also appeared to exacerbate the sell-off in 10 year German and other EZ paper (like stocks, but in the sector sense of course). Indeed, market contacts noted stops on a break of 159.12, but bigger sell-orders if 159.05 is breached vs the 159.07 current low (-36 ticks vs -7 ticks for Gilts at the Liffe low), while Bonos seem to be heeding some cautious comments from the Bank of Spain on the public finance outlook. Elsewhere, US Treasuries continue to unwind recent safe-haven gains even though EU equities are succumbing to more intense selling pressure after displaying a degree of resistance earlier.</p>\r\n",

In contrast, JPM thinks bonds are close to being overbought. Investor sentiment is not complacent anymore, with worries ranging from growth to liquidity to valuations, which JPM says is a healthy development. Positioning is less stretched &ndash; HF beta is back to its historical range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) The complacency over growth outlook appears to be correcting, as PMIs turned lower and with trade uncertainty dominating. JPM does not think that growth necessarily needs to downshift sharply; beyond some stalling, there is no obvious imbalance in the drivers of end-demand which needs to be corrected. The pace of growth is likely to remain above trend. Eurozone CESI is not far from 2016 lows and should bounce from here, JPM believes. April PMIs could arrest the recent decline as negative weather impact drops out. Key US data &ndash; claims, confidence and ISM &ndash; remains encouraging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) Earnings to stay a support, with Q1 reporting season to be taken well, JPM says. Even post some stalling, Q1 activity levels are still stronger than they were in Q4, while in contrast Q1 consensus EPS expectations (ex-tax) are much more muted than they were in Q4, with median Euro area projection at only 5% YY for Q1. JPM notes though that the bulk of the EPS upgrades on the back of the US tax cuts are by now behind us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) Despite persistent concerns, bond yields are still within past ranges, and central bank tightening is still in its early stages, with US real policy rates continuing to be outright negative. None of the last eight downturns started with real rates lower than 2%. Classic end-of-cycle indicators are not flashing warnings signs, yet. The yield curve is flattening, but it is unlikely to get inverted until at least 2H 2018. Crucially, stocks have never peaked before the yield curve inverted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5) Relative to fixed income, JPM finds equity valuations remain undemanding and continue to offer a substantial valuation gap vs historical averages. JPM thinks bond yields should keep repricing higher this year, but its core view is that equities should be able to tolerate rising yields, as we are not yet reaching the yield levels that would be detrimental to valuation multiples or to the sustainability of the economic cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tailwinds behind the US vs Eurozone outperformance (Tech, earnings, USD) to continue fading; Remain UW UK and Switzerland, JPM says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- OW Eurozone:</strong> Eurozone equities are ytd outperforming the US ones, in USD, and JPM expects this to continue. The bank thinks that most of the positive EPS impact from US tax cuts is by now behind us, and that USD could stabilise near term, which should help Eurozone. Further, the region benefits from rising yields given its Value tilt and Eurozone P/E multiples look cheaper again. In contrast, Technology might become a relative drag on the US. Within Eurozone, JPM favours periphery over core. Italy remains JPM&#39;s top pick and we would use any potential politics-induced volatility as a buying opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- OW Japan: </strong>The policy divergence between BoJ and the RoW should translate into higher Japanese equities, JPM says. Robust domestic activity helps earnings, Japan would benefit from a further rise in global yields and Japanese valuations appear attractive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- Neutral EM: </strong>JPM was OW EM in 2016 and in 2017, but believes the region might show some consolidation vs DM this year. Of course, if USD keeps falling, then this would be a positive for EM, the bank argues. On the other side, JPM worries that EM might struggle if the US political agenda moves strongly anti-trade or if China activity slows, and JPM notes bullish China view appears consensus. The bank believes that Tech might start to consolidate its dramatic outperformance, which could be another headwind for the EM. Finally, if there is a sharp repricing of bond yields, EM might be under relative pressure as carry trades are unwound. This is especially because EMBI index received record inflows last year, of 125bn USD. JPM sees this as a tactical call, rather than as a fundamental change of direction, and believes the EM backdrop still looks attractive over the medium term: 1) Fed tightening is not a concern, by itself; looking at the last four Fed tightening cycles, EM outperformed in three. 2) the EM-DM growth differential is bottoming out, after five years of disappointments. 3) EM valuations look attractive at 12x fwd P/E &ndash; a 30% discount to DM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- UW UK: </strong>UK is a defensive, high-dividend yielding market which might have a problem if bond yields move sustainably higher. Growth-Policy trade-off looks poor for the UK, with higher rates and inflation, but softer activity. A stronger GBP is a problem for FTSE100 as it derives close to 70% of revenues from abroad.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are lower across the board as the downbeat tone rolls over from Wall St where China&rsquo;s trade retaliation and tech woes weighed heavily across all bourses, with losses in S&amp;P 500 exacerbated on technical selling after a break below the 200DMA while the Nasdaq underperformed as it slipped into the red YTD and into correction territory. ASX 200 (Unch) and Nikkei 225 (-0.8%) are subdued with the latter suffering the brunt of a firmer currency and with losses seen across tech names following similar underperformance in their US counterparts, which was led by selling in Amazon after President Trump&rsquo;s tirade on the online giant. Conversely, Australian energy names have shrugged off the losses in crude prices and outperform, with gains led by a near 20% surge in Santos shares after it was approached with an offer that was at a 28% premium to the prior day&rsquo;s close. Hang Seng (-0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) also conform to the tech-related losses and after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations for an 8<sup>th</sup> consecutive occasion, while markets in Hong Kong also take their 1<sup>st</sup> opportunity to react to China&rsquo;s tariffs on US products and reports of the government pressuring banks to halt local government lending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action is relatively quiet with most major pairs consolidating after yesterday&rsquo;s risk-averse driven moves. As such, both EUR/USD and GBP/USD lack vitality but are off the prior day&rsquo;s lows with EUR/USD just about reclaiming the 1.2300 handle, while USD/JPY also tepidly attempts to recover from some of the safe-haven flows which dragged the pair below the 106.00 handle. Elsewhere, CAD and MXN were supported on news that US President Trump was said to push for a NAFTA deal &#39;in principle&#39; within a fortnight, while antipodeans are mixed ahead of the RBA decision with AUD outperforming its counterpart across the Tasman after AUD/NZD rebounds from support at around 1.0600 and as NZD/USD homes in on the 0.7200 level to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track the prior session&rsquo;s gains in T-notes amid the risk-averse tone, while focus shifts to the 10yr JGB auction results later.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, the associated implied yield curve currently suggests March 2019 as the earliest date for a possible hike, while a recent survey also showed that respondents viewed rates to be kept unchanged throughout this year, but that median forecasts are&nbsp;for a total 50bps increase to 2.00% by end-September next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rhetoric since the last meeting continues to suggest the unlikelihood of any near-term changes to policy with RBA Governor Lowe repeating that the likely next move in rates will be up not down, although he does not see a case for a near term adjustment of monetary policy. In addition, Lowe also stated that the central scenario is that rates will increase, but it is not inevitable and would depend on how quick unemployment could be lowered. The RBA&#39;s statement and minutes from the March meeting have also been reiterations in which the central bank stated it judged policy was consistent in reaching its targets and although the RBA noted the adverse impact of a stronger currency on the economy, it continued to suggest a lack of urgency regarding the current level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, the data also hints that the RBA won&#39;t be in any hurry to adjust policy given the recent mixed releases including GDP for Q4 which missed expectations Y/Y but included upward revisions to the prior. The most recent jobs data was similarly inconclusive with lower than expected headline Employment Change counterbalanced as the addition to jobs was solely fuelled by Full-Time Employment and although there was a surprise increase to the Unemployment Rate, this was due to a higher Participation Rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s meeting is scheduled for 0530BST/2330CDT/1230HKT and is not expected to trigger any significant price action, considering that the central bank&rsquo;s decisions have been somewhat of a formality and with the central bank likely to reiterate the usual comments which&nbsp;it has been doing so for quite some time now.</p>\r\n",
