The energy sector outperformed after crude futures settled higher by almost 2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>USD </strong>strengthened<strong> </strong>after strong industrial production data, which jumped 1.1% (expected 0.3%), the strongest gain since October. The USD caught a second wind after the University of Michigan sentiment which rose to its highest level in 14 years. Reports of a hawkish thinktank report on the Fed also helped the USD push higher as it was said to suggest that the Fed will prepare markets for four rate hikes in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>EUR, &nbsp;GBP </strong>Eurozone inflation was revised lower to 1.1% from 1.2% but this saw no major moves in the market with the EUR maintaining a weakening trend throughout the day as markets continue to digest the recent dovish message from the ECB. Similar price action was observed in GBP/USD ahead of a big week ahead including BoE decision, inflation &amp; labour market data and the EU summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CAD, AUD, NZD </strong>Commodity currencies were hit again as markets expect the economies could be worst hit from an escalation in trade wars. AUD/USD slipped to a 10 day low after breaking below the 200DMA at 0.7804.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>JPY </strong>trended higher in the European morning as USD/JPY broke back below 106.00. Strong US data lent support to the pair which reclaimed the 106.00 handle and then hovered around that level in the US afternoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>Treasuries </strong>: 10 YEAR T-NOTE FUTURES (JUNE 2018) SETTLES DOWN 5 TICKS AT 120.11 Yields were higher across the curve after the relatively strong data saw a sell-off in bonds in relatively good volume. However, volume and flows dried out at the end of the day and Treasuries meandered into the close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>Crude: </strong>An early afternoon spike saw WTI and Brent crude futures jump to session highs amid no apparent fundamental catalyst. Some speculated that the move was based on details in the Michigan sentiment report which suggested strong expected demand during upcoming driving season. Others were pinning the jump on short-covering ahead of a weekend interview with the Saudi Crown Prince on 60 Minutes.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: more trade/tariff tiffs and political jitters, plus contrasting CB impulses and data",
        "content": "<p>An almost clean sweep of stronger than expected US data and reports of a hawkish think tank report suggesting the Fed may prepare markets for 4 hikes this year next week (vs current dot plot consensus of 3), has boosted the Usd across the board and helped the DXY stage a firmer bounce above 90.000. However, the Dollar is still struggling vs the Jpy above 106.00 amidst ongoing land sale/cronyism claims against Japanese PM Abe and MoF chief Aso with the latter not attending next week&rsquo;s G20 gathering as a result. The Greenback continues to be hampered by global protectionism factors and concerns about President Trump&rsquo;s changing of the White House guard, but significantly less so than its NAFTA counterparts and namesakes down under in the commodity bloc. Indeed, Usd/Cad hit new 2018 highs and peaks above the 1.3000 level, with the Loonie also undermined by disappointing Canadian macro releases and a still cautious BoC. On that note, Governor Poloz sees slack in the economy that may allow more growth without stoking inflation. Usd/Cad stopped just short of 1.3100 on Friday and the big figure is the obvious next upside target before chart resistance around 1.3110. A raft of dovish ECB guidance due to sub-target inflation that was underscored by downside tweaks to final CPI data knocked the Eur, with the single currency losing grip of 1.2300 vs the Usd and breaching supports at the 1.2279 21 DMA, plus 1.2266 Fib vs 1.2412 at one stage. Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd recoiled even further and faster from best levels to circa 0.7720 and 0.7200 respectively vs 0.7916 and 0.7354 on a combination of global trade war fears and data misses (NZ Q4 GDP for example ahead of the RBNZ policy meeting next week). The Chf never really saw strong demand during risk-off trade/flows, and certainly after the SNB maintained that the Franc is highly valued &ndash; back down towards 0.9550 vs the Usd and near 1.1700 vs the Eur. Conversely, the Nok rallied sharply as the Norges Bank brought forward its rate hike guidance to August or September this year, and could have even mulled tightening sooner according to comments from a Deputy Governor. Eur/Nok broke down through a key technical level at 9.5300, then decent bids at 9.5000 and hit a 9.4745 approximate base before consolidating. Back to G10s, Gbp has been a relative outperformer with Cable mostly firmer within a 1.3900-1.4000 range and Eur/Gbp easing between 0.8850-00, largely due to rising hopes of a Brexit transition deal at next week&rsquo;s EU Summit, but with the Irish border stand-off still a major if not the sticking point. Looking ahead, more major CB policy meetings, with the FOMC headlining.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.12)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.7)</strong> were choppy after the PBoC skipped open market operations and instead announced to lend CNY 327bln via its MLF, while US equity futures were briefly pressured on administration instability concerns after initial reports that National Security Adviser McMaster was said to be removed from position, although this was later denied by the White House. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher with support seen amid losses in Japanese stocks and with the BoJ also present in the market with its Rinban amounts left unchanged, while Aussie yields declined across the curve following a 10yr auction in which the average yield was down nearly 20bps from prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese PM Abe was reported to be aware of alterations made to documents in land sale days prior to the public admission.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were initial reports on Twitter citing Washington Post that National Security Adviser McMaster is said to be removed from position, although this was later denied by the White House.

On a sector basis, energy names are outperforming this morning amid the slight push higher in oil prices. UK homebuilders are lagging in the FTSE 100, after Berkeley Group warned over challengers in increasing housing supply further. Elsewhere, NEX Group (+32%) shares surge the most in history after they confirmed that CME Group have approached them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a lot of change in <strong>Usd/G10</strong> and other currency pairings as the same themes continue to impact sentiment and moves. The Dollar remains rather mixed against major counterparts as US President Trump continues to rejig top level White House personnel, while pursuing his policies on the trade and tax front. <strong>Usd/Jpy</strong> is probing a bit deeper below the 106.00 level amidst reports suggesting PM Abe may have been aware of tampered documents before the whole land sale scandal was publicly aired. The headline pair has been down to 105.65, just ahead of bids around 105.50 and of course recent lows circa 105.25. <strong>Eur/Usd</strong> remains capped by benign ECB inflation talk and actual data (Eurozone headline CPI revised lower similarly with Italian CPI in the final February release) but holding above 1.2300 and could be contained by decent option expiry interest for Friday at the figure (2.6 bn) and 1.2350 (1.3 bn). <strong>Cable</strong> still looks firmer within a wide 1.3900-1.4000 range, with <strong>Eur/Gbp</strong> slipping further towards 0.8800 on hopes of a Brexit transition deal can be agreed, assuming the Irish border issue is resolved first. <strong>Usd/Cad</strong> consolidating just below new 2018 highs around 1.3070 amidst ongoing NAFTA concerns and following some weak Canadian data with manufacturing sales up next. Kiwi still the G10 laggard after the NZ GDP miss and a slowdown in the manufacturing PMI overnight, with <strong>Nzd/Usd</strong> now around 0.7250 and the <strong>Aud/Nzd</strong> cross rebounding from the low 1.0700 area, despite <strong>Aud/Usd</strong> losing the 0.7800 handle on the aforementioned heightened global protectionism risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been a slow grind, but nevertheless <strong>Bunds</strong> continue to climb and with more macro impetus this time via softer than expected inflation from Italy and the Eurozone as a whole. The new/latest Eurex session peak is 158.35 (+21 ticks in the day) and basically touching the base of the previously identified zone on the charts ahead of 158.68 resistance and upside levels that correspond to about 0.5% in yield terms. Meanwhile, <strong>Gilts</strong> are also probing further ahead and closer to the nearest bullish tech objective up at 122.24, at 122.12 (+23 ticks), and <strong>USTs</strong> are seeing more bull-flattening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities have seen a slight reprieve this morning with oil prices making marginal gains, however WTI fell short by around USD 0.10 off yesterday&rsquo;s high of USD 61.55/bbl. In the metals complex, gold has pushed up by USD 4/oz, having found support at the earlier weeks low of USD 1313.70/oz</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Equities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final session of the week, sees European bourses trading in mixed fashion following from the indecisive lead from its Asian and US counterparts. On a sector basis, energy names are outperforming this morning amid the slight push higher in oil prices. UK homebuilders are lagging in the FTSE 100, after Berkeley Group warned over challengers in increasing housing supply further. Elsewhere, NEX Group (+35%) shares surge the most in history after they confirmed that CME Group have approached them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a lot of change in Usd/G10 and other currency pairings as the same themes continue to impact sentiment and moves. The Dollar remains rather mixed against major counterparts as US President Trump continues to rejig top level White House personnel, while pursuing his policies on the trade and tax front. Usd/Jpy is probing a bit deeper below the 106.00 level amidst reports suggesting PM Abe may have been aware of tampered documents before the whole land sale scandal was publicly aired. The headline pair has been down to 105.65, just ahead of bids around 105.50 and of course recent lows circa 105.25. Eur/Usd remains capped by benign ECB inflation talk and actual data (Eurozone headline CPI revised lower similarly with Italian CPI in the final February release), but holding above 1.2300 and could be contained by decent option expiry interest for Friday at the figure (2.6 bn) and 1.2350 (1.3 bn). Cable still looks firmer within a wide 1.3900-1.4000 range, with Eur/Gbp slipping further towards 0.8800 on hopes of a Brexit transition deal can be agreed, assuming the Irish border issue is resolved first. Usd/Cad consolidating just below new 2018 highs around 1.3070 amidst ongoing NAFTA concerns and following some weak Canadian data with manufacturing sales up next. Kiwi still the G10 laggard after the NZ GDP miss and a slowdown in the manufacturing PMI overnight, with Nzd/Usd now around 0.7250 and the Aud/Nzd cross rebounding from the low 1.0700 area, despite Aud/Usd losing the 0.7800 handle on the aforementioned heightened global protectionism risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixed Income</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been a slow grind, but nevertheless Bunds continue to climb and with more macro impetus this time via softer than expected inflation from Italy and the Eurozone as a whole. The new/latest Eurex session peak is 158.35 (+21 ticks in the day) and basically touching the base of the previously identified zone on the charts ahead of 158.68 resistance and upside levels that correspond to about 0.5% in yield terms. Meanwhile, Gilts are also probing further ahead and closer to the nearest bullish tech objective up at 122.24, at 122.12 (+23 ticks), and USTs are seeing more bull-flattening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities have seen a slight reprieve this morning with oil prices making marginal gains, however WTI fell short by around USD 0.10 off yesterday&rsquo;s high of USD 61.55/bbl. In the metals complex, gold has pushed up by USD 4/oz, having found support at the earlier weeks low of USD 1313.70/oz</p>\r\n",

The Dollar remains rather mixed against major counterparts as US President Trump continues to rejig top level White House personnel, while pursuing his policies on the trade and tax front. Usd/Jpy is probing a bit deeper below the 106.00 level amidst reports suggesting PM Abe may have been aware of tampered documents before the whole land sale scandal was publicly aired. The headline pair has been down to 105.65, just ahead of bids around 105.50 and of course recent lows circa 105.25. Eur/Usd remains capped by benign ECB inflation talk and actual data (Italian CPI revised a bit lower in the final February release), but holding above 1.2300 and could be contained by decent option expiry interest for Friday at the figure (2.6 bn) and 1.2350 (1.3 bn). Cable still looks firmer within a wide 1.3900-1.4000 range, with Eur/Gbp slipping further towards 0.8800 on hopes of a Brexit transition deal can be agreed, assuming the Irish border issue is resolved first. Usd/Cad consolidating just below new 2018 highs around 1.3070 amidst ongoing NAFTA concerns and following some weak Canadian data with manufacturing sales up next. Kiwi still the G10 laggard after the NZ GDP miss and a slowdown in the manufacturing PMI overnight, with Nzd/Usd now around 0.7250 and the Aud/Nzd cross rebounding from the low 1.0700 area, despite Aud/Usd losing the 0.7800 handle on the aforementioned heightened global protectionism risk.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) were mixed with Australia led by Consumer Staples as Wesfarmers shares surged on plans to spin off its Coles supermarket chain, while Nikkei 225 was kept subdued by a firmer JPY and as cover up allegations were fuelled by reports PM Abe knew of the document alterations days before the public admission. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) were choppy after the PBoC skipped open market operations and instead announced to lend CNY 327bln via its MLF, while US equity futures were briefly pressured on administration instability concerns after initial reports that National Security Adviser McMaster was said to be removed from position, although this was later denied by the White House. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher with support seen amid losses in Japanese stocks and with the BoJ also present in the market with its Rinban amounts left unchanged, while Aussie yields declined across the curve following a 10yr auction in which the average yield was down nearly 20bps from prior.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are mixed with Australia led by Consumer Staples as Wesfarmers shares surge on plans to spin off its Coles supermarket chain, while Nikkei 225 is kept subdued by a firmer JPY and with claims of a cover up being fuelled by reports PM Abe knew of the document alterations days ahead of the public admission. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are mixed after the PBoC skipped open market operations but instead announced to lend CNY 327bln via MLF, and US equity futures were briefly pressured on concerns of US administration instability after initial reports that National Security Adviser McMaster was said to be removed from position, although this was later denied by the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are quiet overnight amid a lack of tangible drivers and sparse data releases. As such, the greenback has held on to most of the prior day&rsquo;s gains with the DXY maintaining above the 90.00 level, although the quiet tone has somewhat provided much-needed respite for major currencies after the recent selling against USD. Elsewhere, JPY continues to firm as the cronyism scandal threatens to cloud over Abenomics and with safe-haven flows also exacerbated amid the false McMasters firing report, while a subdued commodity-complex has in turn kept related currencies pressured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher with support seen amid losses in Japanese stocks and as the BoJ kept the amounts of today&rsquo;s Rinban operation unchanged, while Aussie yields declined across the curve following a 10yr auction in which the average yield was down nearly 20bps from prior.</p>\r\n",
