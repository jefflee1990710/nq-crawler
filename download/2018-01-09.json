The sales will raise a net USD 15.5bln in new cash, given the USD 40.5bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, according to TD Securities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SHORT-END:&nbsp;</strong>Yields along the front have risen to nine-year highs at the beginning of 2018 on expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates; money markets are pricing in around 62% probability of a hike in March, according to the CME Fedwatch tool, with Fed Funds futures pricing in just over two hikes in 2018 (versus the three hikes pencilled in by the Fed&rsquo;s latest &lsquo;dots&rsquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, despite front-end yields rising, major curves &ndash; the 2s10s spread, for instance &ndash; have flattened, with 10-year yields continuing to trade between 2.40% and 2.50% this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3-YEAR AUCTION:&nbsp;</strong>Yields on 3s have cheapened by around 10bps since the last auction cycle, which may provide some support for the auction. Recent auctions have been mixed, clearing very close to the 1pm WI, analysts at Barclays write.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Final demand has remained stable because while foreign demand has declined, domestic demand has increased,&rdquo; Barclays writes, &ldquo;on a three-month moving average, foreign demand has declined 6pp, to 16%, while domestic demand has increased about 5ppts, to 46%.&rdquo; And Barclays argues that while on-the-run 3s appear rich on a spot basis, that is due to its specialness in repo markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PREVIOUS 3-YEAR AUCTION HSTORY (via TD Securities):</strong><br />- Size: USD 24bln (vs six-month average of USD 24bln)<br />- High-yield: 1.932% (vs six-auction average of 1.644%)<br />- Tail: 0.3bps (vs six auction average of 0.0bps)<br />- Dealers: 33.6% (vs six auction average of 36.1%)<br />- Directs: 7.4% (vs six auction average of 9.0%)<br />- Indirects: 59.0% (vs six auction average of 54.9%)</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were positive in which commodity names led in Australia and the Japanese benchmark outperformed as it played catch up on return from the extended weekend. However, some of the gains in Japan were later pared on tapering concerns after the BoJ reduced its Rinban announcement for longer dated bonds. Elsewhere, KOSPI (-0.1%) was dampened after index-heavyweight Samsung Electronics missed on Q4 preliminary results, while both Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) also gained despite initial cautiousness on further inaction by the PBoC which resulted to a net daily drain of CNY 130bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower by about 15 ticks on concern of BoJ tapering after the Rinban announcement saw a reduction of buying in 10yr-25yr maturities to JPY 190bln from JPY 200bln, as well as the amount in 25yr+ maturities which was cut to JPY 80bln from JPY 90bln.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>China are to suspend the counter-cyclical factor in the CNY fix, according to sources.

(Business Insider)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Global European equities are trading higher across the board (Eurostoxx 50 +0.2%) with all sectors (ex-energy) in the green. </strong>Performance is relatively broad-based with some slight outperformance in material names. Focus has also been on the UK supermarket sector after the latest trading update from Morrisons (+2.6%) sent their shares to the top of the FTSE alongside the latest Kantar and Nielsen reports. Elsewhere, focus has also fallen on UK homebuilders with Persimmon shares initially&nbsp; supported by upbeat guidance before upside momentum then dissipated. British American Tobacco shares have been supported after stating that the impact of new US tax legislation would result in a benefit of 6% to FY 2018 EPS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX, <strong>USD is extending recent recovery gains to just over 92.500, with the Greenback getting a boost from reports that the PBoC is planning to suspend the counter-cyclical factor in CNY fixes</strong>, which saw USD/CNH spike to 6.51520 from 6.50340 following the earlier 6.4968 USD/CNY mid-point setting. JPY firmer and the G10 outperformer on reduced Rinban activity overnight which alongside monthly BoJ data suggests a concerted slowdown in JGB buying. <strong>USD/JPY</strong> down to 112.50 from 113.00+ at one stage, but bids around the low held and broader US Dollar gains now nudging the pair back up towards 113.00 again.&nbsp; <strong>EUR</strong> is still on the back foot across the board as more long positions are trimmed, with <strong>EUR/USD</strong> now under 1.1950 and eyeing stops said to be in place at 1.1925. <strong>AUD/CAD/NZD</strong> all off best levels vs their US counterpart, with <strong>AUD/USD</strong> above 0.7850 on much better than expected Aussie building approvals data overnight, but now back down under 0.7825, <strong>USD/CAD</strong> looking firmer over 1.2400 after another dip below the figure (another uptick in oil prices and solid BoC business outlook survey supporting the Loonie) and NZD/USD down around 0.7170 having almost touched 0.7200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A somewhat belated and limp uptick in Bunds and Gilts given the well-received German and UK supply offerings with the only slight fly in the ointment perhaps coming via the 2027 DMO average yield.

The rather muted price moves suggest more supply related topside pressure looming ahead of the start of US refunding and with plenty of EU issuance still to come this week, not to mention corporate deals. US Treasuries also seem to have supply in mind with a steeper bias across the maturity curve, and the 10 year yield just crossing 2.5% again. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, <strong>WTI and Brent</strong> crude prices were initially trading in close proximity to recent highs in a continuation of sentiment yesterday after expectations of a draw of 4.1mln bbls for this week&rsquo;s inventory data. Furthermore, OPEC officials suggested that the Iran situation was being monitored, and output will only be raised in the event that there is a significant and sustained disruption to output. However, <strong>prices then began to be dragged lower after comments from the Iranian energy minister who claimed that OPEC does not want oil prices above USD 60/bbl</strong>. In metals markets, the <strong>recovery in the USD placed some weight on precious metals </strong>(Silver tested USD 17.00/oz to the downside) after a relatively uneventful Asia-Pac session. Elsewhere,&nbsp; Chinese iron ore futures were seen higher overnight as production cutbacks in China continues to sway sentiment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran oil minister Zanganeh says OPEC does not want oil prices above USD 60/bbl.

        "content": "<p>European equities are trading higher across the board (Eurostoxx 50 +0.2%) with all ten sectors in the green. Performance is relatively broad-based with some slight outperformance in material names. Focus has also been on the UK supermarket sector after the latest trading update from Morrisons (+2.6%) sent their shares to the top of the FTSE alongside the latest Kantar and Nielsen reports. Elsewhere, focus has also fallen on UK homebuilders with Persimmon shares initially&nbsp; supported by upbeat guidance before upside momentum then dissipated. British American Tobacco shares have been supported after stating that the impact of new US tax legislation would result in a benefit of 6% to FY 2018 EPS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fixed income markets, Bunds continue to chip away at losses, with the deficit down to just 6 ticks at the latest Eurex session high (161.74 vs 161.56 at worst), but Gilts remain around &frac14; pt offside having declined 37 ticks at one stage to 124.43 (just above Monday&rsquo;s Liffe low). UK debt appears to be making a concession for upcoming supply from the DMO in a classic pre-auction set up fashion, with the secondary 10 year yield back up around 1.25% and bang on the coupon price of today&rsquo;s issue. On that note, the Buba has set a 0.5% coupon on its new 10 year Bund ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s launch, which could draw cash rates from the current circa 0.44% level. US Treasuries also seem to have supply in mind with a steeper bias across the maturity curve, and the 10 year yield just crossing 2.5% again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX, USD is extending recent recovery gains to just over 92.500, with the Greenback getting a boost from reports that the PBoC is planning to suspend the counter-cyclical factor in CNY fixes, which saw USD/CNH spike to 6.51520 from 6.50340 following the earlier 6.4968 USD/CNY mid-point setting. JPY firmer and the G10 outperformer on reduced Rinban activity overnight which alongside monthly BoJ data suggests a concerted slowdown in JGB buying. USD/JPY down to 112.50 from 113.00+ at one stage, but bids around the low held and broader US Dollar gains now nudging the pair back up towards 113.00 again. &nbsp;EUR is still on the back foot across the board as more long positions are trimmed, with EUR/USD now under 1.1950 and eyeing stops said to be in place at 1.1925. AUD/CAD/NZD all off best levels vs their US counterpart, with AUD/USD above 0.7850 on much better than expected Aussie building approvals data overnight, but now back down under 0.7825, USD/CAD looking firmer over 1.2400 after another dip below the figure (another uptick in oil prices and solid BoC business outlook survey supporting the Loonie) and NZD/USD down around 0.7170 having almost touched 0.7200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude prices were initially trading in close proximity to recent highs in a continuation of sentiment yesterday after expectations of a draw of 4.1mln bbls for this week&rsquo;s inventory data. Furthermore, OPEC officials suggested that the Iran situation was being monitored, and output will only be raised in the event that there is a significant and sustained disruption to output. However, prices then began to be dragged lower after comments from the Iranian energy minister who claimed that OPEC does not want oil prices above USD 60/bbl. In metals markets, the recovery in the USD placed some weight on precious metals (Silver tested USD 17.00/oz to the downside) after a relatively uneventful Asia-Pac session. Elsewhere, &nbsp;Chinese iron ore futures were seen higher overnight as production cutbacks in China continues to sway sentiment. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: Dutch EUR 1.5-2.5bln 2024 DSL Auction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rabobank: The DSL Jan 2024 is the shortest maturity Dutch govvie with a positive yield and this could be supportive at the auction. The bond also appears to offer value versus swap compared to its peers on the Dutch curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the issue date at 0900GMT, the DSTA will announce the price at which Primary Dealers may buy the issue. As usual, the issuance will take the form of a tap auction, during which the DSTA may revise the price at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: Austrian EUR 1.38bln 0.5% 2027 and 2047 Bond Auction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SocGen:&nbsp;EGB spreads look resilient for now, with supply weighing only at the margin. This week sees sizeable issuance, with the reopening of the 2024 DSL, and 2027 and 2047 RAGBs&nbsp;on Tuesday. Amongst these three bonds, only the RAGB April 2027 has seen interesting concession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is some competing supply this week which may deter investors, but analysts at IFR suspect that the auctions will go week as Austria is a high-quality name and an infrequent borrower and therefore there is likely to be demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of historical data</p>\r\n\r\n<p>0.5% 2027 prev. b/c 4.249, average yield 0.476%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.5% 2047 prev. 2.84, average yield 1.495%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bids are submitted by 1000GMT and results are published shortly after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: ECB 7-Day MRO</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On December 19th the ECB announced that EUR 3.372bln was allotted in its 14-day MRO operation. Results are usually published around 1030GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: German EUR 0.5bln I/L 0.1% 2046 Auction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of historical data:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prev. b/c 1.4, real yield -0.36%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bids are submitted by 1030GMT and results are published shortly after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: UK GBP 2.25bln 1.25% 2027 Gilt Auction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SocGen:&nbsp;From a relative value perspective, the signs are mixed, with the auction bond looking fair if z-spreads are plotted against duration, but cheap (close to 4bp) if maturity is used.&nbsp;Aside from relative value arguments, there should be decent pent-up demand for gilts. There has been a lack of recent issuance and it is close to two months since the 10y was last auctioned. Auctions of the 10y seldom go badly, with the average bid/cover over all auctions at 2.24x and average tail at just over 0.2bp. With asset managers tending to have cash to allocate at the start of the year, and with the gilts that pay coupon on&nbsp;22 January&nbsp;scheduled to go ex-dividend&nbsp;on Thursday, we think the auction should go well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of historical data:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prev. b/c 2.15, average yield 1.317%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bids are submitted by 1030GMT and results are published shortly after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US to sell USD 24bln 3-year notes at 1300 ET (1800 GMT) on 9 Jan 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THIS WEEK&rsquo;S TREASURY SUPPLY:</strong> Excluding bills, the US will this week sell a total of USD 56bln in 3s, 10s and 30s this week (USD 24bln of 3s on Tuesday, USD 20bln in a 10s reopening on Wednesday, USD 12bln in a 30s reopening on Thursday). The sales will raise a net USD 15.5bln in new cash, given the USD 40.5bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, according to TD Securities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SHORT-END:</strong> Yields along the front have risen to nine-year highs at the beginning of 2018 on expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates; money markets are pricing in around 62% probability of a hike in March, according to the CME Fedwatch tool, with Fed Funds futures pricing in just over two hikes in 2018 (versus the three hikes pencilled in by the Fed&rsquo;s latest &lsquo;dots&rsquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, despite front-end yields rising, major curves &ndash; the 2s10s spread, for instance &ndash; have flattened, with 10-year yields continuing to trade between 2.40% and 2.50% this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3-YEAR AUCTION:</strong> Yields on 3s have cheapened by around 10bps since the last auction cycle, which may provide some support for the auction. Recent auctions have been mixed, clearing very close to the 1pm WI, analysts at Barclays write.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Final demand has remained stable because while foreign demand has declined, domestic demand has increased,&rdquo; Barclays writes, &ldquo;on a three-month moving average, foreign demand has declined 6pp, to 16%, while domestic demand has increased about 5ppts, to 46%.&rdquo; And Barclays argues that while on-the-run 3s appear rich on a spot basis, that is due to its specialness in repo markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PREVIOUS 3-YEAR AUCTION HSTORY (via TD Securities): </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Size: USD 24bln (vs six-month average of USD 24bln)<br />- High-yield: 1.932% (vs six-auction average of 1.644%)<br />- Tail: 0.3bps (vs six auction average of 0.0bps)<br />- Dealers: 33.6% (vs six auction average of 36.1%)<br />- Directs: 7.4% (vs six auction average of 9.0%)<br />- Indirects: 59.0% (vs six auction average of 54.9%)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mostly higher as the region mirrored the tone seen in US, where all majors posted fresh record highs but the DJIA still snapped its New Year streak. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were positive in which commodity names led in Australia and the Japanese benchmark outperformed as it played catch up on return from the extended weekend. However, some of the gains in Japan were later pared on tapering concerns after the BoJ reduced its Rinban announcement for longer dated bonds. Elsewhere, KOSPI (-0.4%) was dampened after index-heavyweight Samsung Electronics missed on Q4 preliminary results, while both Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) also gained despite initial cautiousness on further inaction by the PBoC which resulted to a net daily drain of CNY 130bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower by about 15 ticks on concern of BoJ tapering after the Rinban announcement saw a reduction of buying in 10yr-25yr maturities to JPY 190bln from JPY 200bln, as well as the amount in 25yr+ maturities which was cut to JPY 80bln from JPY 90bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, JPY strengthened on the reduced Rinban announcement in which USD/JPY slipped below 113.00 and GBP/JPY gave up the 153.00 handle.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as the region mirrors the tone seen in US, where all majors posted fresh record highs but the DJIA still snapped its New Year streak. ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) are positive as commodity names lead in Australia and with the Japanese benchmark outperforming as it plays catch up on return from the extended week-end. However, some&nbsp;of the gains in Japan were later pared on tapering concerns after the BoJ reduced its Rinban announcement for longer dated bonds. Elsewhere, KOSPI (+0.1%) is somewhat restricted after index-heavyweight Samsung Electronics missed on Q4 preliminary results, while both Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are indecisive on further inaction by the PBoC leading to a net daily drain of CNY 130bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, JPY strengthened on the reduced Rinban announcement which saw USD/JPY slip below the 113.00 level and GBP/JPY give up the 153.00 handle. Antipodeans were also firmer against the greenback with AUD/USD underpinned after stronger than expected Building Approvals (M/M 11.7% vs. Exp. -1.3%; Y/Y 17.1% vs. Exp. 4.6%), while NZD/USD eyed a test of 0.7200 to the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower by about&nbsp;15 ticks on concern of BoJ tapering after the Rinban announcement saw a reduction of buying in 10yr-25yr maturities to JPY 190bln from JPY 200bln, as well as in 25yr+ maturities which was cut to JPY 80bln from JPY 90bln. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
