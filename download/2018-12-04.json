In addition, UK Parliament voted that the government is in contempt over Brexit legal advice and ordered to publish advice immediately. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May pledged a more formal role for Parliament on her Brexit deal and that she will work with Parliament to prepare the mandate for next steps of negotiations, while she also commented that a second referendum wouldn&#39;t bring the country together.

Bush. RANsquawk desk will operate as usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump announced that negotiations with China have already started and unless extended, they will end 90 days from the trade truce reached on December 1st. Trump announced that Trade representative Lighthizer will be working closely with Secretary of State Mnuchin, NEC Director Kudlow, as well as Commerce secretary Ross and Advisor Navarro to see if a real deal can be achieved. In related comments, Kudlow noted that if a deal with China is not reached, the US would increase tariffs by 25% and &ldquo;could add to that&rdquo; while highlighting that technology related issues are the most important ones; Ross also appeared hopeful that the 90-day period will be sufficient to implement a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMMERCE SECRETARY ROSS </strong>was upbeat on the US economy and noted that a growth pace of 3.5% is above trend, highlighting that the biggest problem US has is a lack of workers. He said there is no truth to reports he is leaving his role by the end of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; ITALY: </strong>Italy&#39;s Deputy PMs Di Maio and Salvini were said to be open to a possible 2% deficit target which was opposed once again by the EU; estimates show the cut is not enough indicating it should be reduced by EUR 12bln. An Italian Junior Minister argued that an agreement may not be found with the EU and claimed that the government has already taken into account this possibility while stating that Italy will do everything possible to avoid a disciplinary procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The UK government has suffered three defeats altogether which could mean PM May is losing control of the Commons and potentially of Brexit overall. Cable took a hit on the UK Parliament voting 311 to 293 to hold the government in contempt after it failed to release the full Brexit legal advice and ordered its immediate release; parliament Leader Leadsom announced that the full document will now be published officially on Wednesday. Lawmakers also voted in favour of giving parliament more power over the next steps on Brexit if PM May&#39;s deal is voted down on Dec 11th therefore making a no-deal scenario highly unlikely since a majority of MPs are against such a scenario. Elsewhere, the top EU Court determined that Britain can revoke Brexit Article 50 unilaterally which would enable the UK to stop Brexit from happening at all and therefore paving the way for a 3rd possible Brexit outcome alongside UK PM May&rsquo;s deal and a no-deal scenario.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Williams (Voter, Neutral) said that the US economy is strong, adding that the Fed has reached objectives as well has it ever has, continue to expect further gradual rate hikes. He went on to say that indicators show a strong and healthy labour market. He expects economy to continue to growth at a strong rate of 2.5% next year and prices inflation to move slightly about 2%; no signs it will rise too much, and he will evaluate incoming data which thus far has been better than strong expectations. Also, financial conditions are still pretty favourable to growth. He highlighted risks on horizon and he is watching for signs that the economy may be slowing more quickly than anticipated. On the inverted yield curve, Williams said he does not want to lose track of data at hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED&#39;S DISCOUNT RATE MINUTES </strong>showed 12 Fed banks favoured no discount rate change; several observed continued strengths in spending and confidence, The Fed bank directors saw ongoing tightening in the labour market and still positive on economic outlook while trade policy remained a concern for some directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;SPX -3.24% at 2700, NDX -3.78% at 6795, DJI -3.10% at 25027. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -2.93%, Materials -3.07%, Industrials -4.34%, Cons Discretionary -3.91%, Cons Staples -1.63%, Healthcare -2.29%, Financials -4.39%, Tech -3.85%, Telecoms -3.15%, Utilities +0.15%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Autozone (AZO) surged at the open after it reported a beat on EPS and comp sales estimates. Discovery (DISCA) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI) parred Monday&rsquo;s losses. Waste Management (WM) rose on an upgrade at Goldman Sachs. Dollar General (DG) underperformed after lowering guidance. China trade sensitive sectors such as the industrials (CAT, DE, BA) and chipmakers (AMAT, AMD, LRCX, MU, NVDA) drifted lower through the day as scepticism grew towards US/China trade truce. Banks (C, BAC, MS, GS, USB, WFC, JPM) came under pressure as treasury yields dropped further. Square (SQ) underperformed after a price target cut at Stifel. UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) traded lower following price target cuts at Morgan Stanley. Amazon (AMZN) saw downticks on news US President Trump panel seeks higher postal shipping rates for the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 0.30 HIGHER AT USD 53.25/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 0.39 HIGHER AT USD 62.08/BBL.</strong> Ahead of the OPEC meeting set to start on Wednesday, oil prices gave up some gains amid deteriorating risk-sentiment and following Saudi and Iran oil ministers&rsquo; latest comments, casting some doubt on the unity of the group to endorse production cuts3 at their meeting. Reports have suggested that OPEC+ are working towards a minimum output cut of 1.3mln BPD from the October levels with all producers cutting 3.0%-3.5% production from October levels. The main obstacle to this appears to be the position of Russia willing to cut output by a maximum of 150k BPD as OPEC is eyeing to cut a minimum of 250-350k BPD; sources have suggested that OPEC could delay output cuts if Russia does not agree to a substantial output cut. Citigroup also notes that there &ldquo;may be some pushback from a range of producers on this proposal, since it effectively allows Saudi Arabia to retain some of the market share they have picked up by ramping output higher since May&rdquo;. Looking ahead, API data are due today after market close with expectations being that crude stocks fell by 0.9mln/bbl for the week; if expectations prove accurate this will be the first crude oil draw since mid-September. Looking at the components distillate is seen building 1.2mln, gasoline building 1.3mln and cushing building 2.1mln. Additionally, the weekly EIA release has been pushed back to Thursday at 16:00 GMT, due to the national day of mourning for Former President George H.W. Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 15 TICKS HIGHER AT 120-03.</strong> The treasury complex drifted higher on Tuesday with particular attention falling on the long end of the curve which attracted investors&rsquo; demand amid prospect that the Fed might slow the pace of rate hikes in 2019. The 10yr yield hit a 3-month low at 2.8830% and the 30yr yield fell to 3.1278%, overall representing the largest drop since May. Yields on the short-end of the curve were lower by less than 1bps while the 30yr yield was lower by c.1bps at settlement. Much attention is on the inversion of the curve, Barron&rsquo;s has noted that a true inversion would involve the short and long-ends of the curve, and how the five-year maturities &lsquo;don&rsquo;t really count&rsquo;; 2s10s hit 9.32bps the lowest since 2007, but Barron&rsquo;s noted that the last 10 times 2s10s has inverted, there were three occasions when there was no recession. Goldman Sachs noted that it doesn&rsquo;t believe that investors ought to overly fear a flat yield curve, either as a signal or a cause of a recession, describing it as a &ldquo;sheep in wolf&rsquo;s clothing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>More volatile trade in Sterling that has failed to glean any lasting support from a 2nd consecutive UK PMI beat amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty on the 1st official day of debate. Indeed, Cable has reversed further from circa 1.2840 peaks made in wake of the EU legal recommendation in favour of giving Britain unilateral power to revoke Article 50, as PM May&rsquo;s office responded with a firm reminder that the Government has no intention to reverse course and has no plan B in the event that the meaningful vote fails. Meanwhile, the contempt motion has started, but the cross-party amendment aiming to put Parliament in control if the WA is rejected could well pose a bigger problem for May and her Cabinet supporters. Cable is back near 1.2750 and not far off early lows around 1.2720, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded over 0.8900 towards 0.8940 peaks vs 0.8890 at one stage, perhaps aided by some buying interest for the 4 pm Frankfurt fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The major safe-haven currency is on track to cement gains through 113.00 vs the Greenback and end Tuesday&rsquo;s EU session as the clear outperformer having breached several key tech levels on the way up from 113.65 lows, including a chart support, Fib and MA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, NZD, CHF, AUD:</strong> The single currency awaits further Italian budget developments and another draft presentation to the EU with Eur/Usd slipping below 1.1350 and probing the 1.1305-1.1320 support zone. while the Kiwi has eased back below 0.6950, but is holding up better than its Antipodean as Aud/Usd pulls back further from another test of 0.7400 and the Aud/Nzd cross slips back to 1.0600 &ndash; a rare rise in GDT auction prices providing the Kiwi with some impetus? The Franc breaks above 0.9950 vs the Buck, but below 1.1300 vs the Eur after weaker than forecast Swiss inflation data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> CAD, DXY: </strong>The Loonie has lost ground vs its US peer on lingering USMCA niggles after the ceremonial signing of the new NAFTA pact las week, and as the comeback in crude prices waned somewhat (Saudi Arabia pouring cold water on talk of a minimum 1.3 mn bpd OPEC+ cut). Usd/Cad is back up on the 1.3250 handle, while the index has regained composure after a dip through stops at 96.400 to reclaim 96.500, pass a key Fib (96.612) and sitting just above 96.950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: BOC DECEMBER 2018 MEETING. </strong>BOC will publish its rate decision and accompanying statement at 1500 GMT/1000 EST on 5 Dec 2018. Analysts see the BOC holding its policy rate at 1.75%, in line with market pricing. Attention will be on commentary around the energy sector (sliding oil prices and the crude production halt in Alberta) which could weigh on Canadian growth. This is a non-MPR meeting, and although there will not be a press conference with Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins, Poloz is due to speak on Thursday. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20695/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: </strong>OPEC, OPEC+ MEETINGS IN VIENNA OPEC 175th meeting: 6th December at 0830GMT (Press Conference 1200GMT). OPEC+ 5th meeting: 7th December at 0830GMT (Joint Press Conference 1200GMT). There is expectation that the alliance of OPEC and its partners will roll back part of its supply cut deal made in the summer (when supply was cut in an effort to keep the market well supplied ahead of the then-impending sanctions on Iran, as well as lower production in Venezuela). The Street estimates that the &lsquo;cut&rsquo; amount could be anywhere between 1mln to 1.4mln barrels, based on chatter from OPEC officials, advisory notices from the OPEC&rsquo;s own economic panel (which has suggested that a cut of 1.3mln barrels might be required from October levels to achieve market balance) as well as sources (who said OPEC+ will debate a cut of up to 1.4mln barrels). Sources noted that OPEC and allies are pushing towards a cut of 1.3mln BPD from October levels, however, Saudi Energy Minister poured some cold water on this after stating that it is premature to suggest that OPEC+ will cut output. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20699/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More volatile trade in Sterling that has failed to glean any lasting support from a 2nd consecutive UK PMI beat amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty on the 1st official day of debate. Indeed, Cable has reversed further from circa 1.2840 peaks made in wake of the EU legal recommendation in favour of giving Britain unilateral power to revoke Article 50, as PM May&rsquo;s office responded with a firm reminder that the Government has no intention to reverse course and has no plan B in the event that the meaningful vote fails. Meanwhile, the contempt motion has started, but the cross party amendment aiming to put Parliament in control if the WA is rejected could well pose a bigger problem for May and her Cabinet supporters. Cable is back near 1.2750 and not far off early lows around 1.2720, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded over 0.8900 towards 0.8940 peaks vs 0.8890 at one stage, perhaps aided by some buying interest for the 4 pm Frankfurt fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major safe-haven currency is on track to cement gains through 113.00 vs the Greenback and end Tuesday&rsquo;s EU session as the clear outperformer having breached several key tech levels on the way up from 113.65 lows, including a chart support, Fib and MA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/NZD/CHF/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All firmer vs the Usd, but off best levels as the single currency awaits further Italian budget developments and another draft presentation to the EU. Eur/Usd is hovering just under 1.1400 having failed yet again to build on gains or breach Fib resistance at 1.1424, while the Kiwi has eased back below 0.6950, but is holding up better than its Antipodean as Aud/Usd pulls back further from another test of 0.7400 and the Aud/Nzd cross slips back to 1.0600 &ndash; a rare rise in GDT auction prices providing the Kiwi with some impetus? The Franc is still meandering either side of 0.9950 vs the Buck, but below 1.1300 vs the Eur after weaker than forecast Swiss inflation data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has lost ground vs its US peer on lingering USMCA niggles after the ceremonial signing of the new NAFTA pact las week, and as the comeback in crude prices waned somewhat (Saudi Arabia pouring cold water on talk of a minimum 1.3 mn bpd OPEC+ cut). Usd/Cad is back up on the 1.3200 handle, while the index has regained composure after a dip through stops at 96.400 to reclaim 96.500 and sit just above a key Fib (96.612).</p>\r\n",

An indecisive tone was seen in the Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) amid a lack of fresh drivers and as participants await the next developments of the US-China trade saga with China reportedly considering possibilities of lowering US auto tariffs. In addition, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was said to be hopeful for an agreement but warned tariffs will be implemented if a deal fails to materialize, while China reportedly censored a post by the US Embassy regarding the recent trade developments and tariff ceasefire which some have suggested could be a possible effort to avoid looking weak or that it gave in to US pressure. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded higher amid the risk averse tone and as they tracked the overnight gains in T-notes. This coincided with the US 10yr Treasury yield dropping below its 200DMA for the first time in around a year, while the US 2yr/10yr spread continued to narrow to its flattest in over a decade. Today also saw a 10yr auction from Japan, although there was a muted reaction as the auction bore mixed results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Italian Deputy PM Salvini later said the 2% deficit is just a number and has defended the budget, as according to reports in LAZ (Corriere/Messaggero/Stampa)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy Junior Economic Minister says an agreement may not be found with the EU regarding the budget, and that the government has already taken into account this possibility adding that the government will do everything possible to avoid disciplinary procedure by the EU over the budget. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Moscovici says talks with Italy on the 2019 budget are intense; adding that Italy is trying to solve the problem, who later said that the EU commission are not disputing pension reform in Italy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank&#39;s Jansson states that it is too early to suggest whether rates can be lifted in December or February. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Economic Advisor Kudlow commented that the 90-day US-China truce will begin January 1st, although the White House later corrected this and stated that the truce began on December 1st. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell (Neutral) said he sees long term challenges in otherwise strong economy and added that the Fed has made great progress towards mission goals. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (Non-Voter, Dove) said he is focused on not being pre-determined about the future path of rates, while he added he is paying attention to slowdown in global growth and expects US growth to slow next year. Furthermore, Kaplan said it is very possible that the US economy will look very different by mid-2019 and that he wants to be patient and watch things unfold.

(SCMP)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities have kicked the session off with modest losses (Eurostoxx 50 -0.5%) as markets take a breather from yesterday&rsquo;s &ldquo;trade truce&rdquo; inspired gains. The CAC 40 (-0.6%) was initially showing some marginal underpeformance relative to its peers in what has been a difficult start to the week for French equities amid domestic protests over the weekend, albeit tensions might show some signs of abating following reports that the French PM is to halt the proposed fuel tax hike. Elsewhere, sectors are relatively mixed thus far with mild outperformance seen in energy names (in-fitting with price action in the complex). Consumer discretionary stocks are a clear underperformer with Volkswagen (-2.2%), Porsche (-2.0%) and BMW (-1.9%) all lower after German car registrations fell 10% Y/Y.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postal names are softer in Europe following a disappointing update from BPost (-20.4%) which has sent their shares to the foot of the Stoxx 600, dragging Post NL (-5.3%) and Deutsche Post (-1.7%) lower in sympathy. In terms of individual movers and shakers have predominantly been the result of broker moves with Rightmove (+1.8%), JC Decaux (-3.3%), BAE Systems (-4.9%) and Continental (-4.0%) all gaining traction as a result of rating action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY, GBP &ndash; Major G10 outperformers with cable breaching yesterday&rsquo;s high of 1.2825 (vs. intraday lows of 1.2720), absorbing offers around 1.2800-1.2820 on the way to a peak of 1.2839. The Pound may have derived support from another UK PMI beat (construction) having already gained impetus after the ECJ&rsquo;s senior advisor stated that the UK can revoke Article 50 unilaterally (under certain conditions). The single currency vs. the pound holding just above 0.8900 vs. lows of 0.8890 with stops reported at 0.8950 (though some distance away). To the downside, 0.8861 is reported to be a support level. Elsewhere, the JPY is taking advantage of the ongoing buck decline and a marked downturn in risk sentiment after initial US-China truce euphoria, with USD/JPY taking out the Tenken line at 113.34, a Fib level at 113.17 and the 55DMA at 113.05 to hit a low of 112.75 (ahead of the psychological 112.50 and the 100-DMA at 112.25)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; On the backfoot again with the index retreating further from 97.000 to trip stops at 96.400 and register a fresh post-G20 low of 96.372. This against the backdrop of broad Dollar losses vs. its major counterpart and a sharp retreat in US Treasury yields with the long-end of the curve outperforming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; Also benefitting from the Greenback&rsquo;s misfortunes and hopes that Italy vs. EU fiscal friction may be resolved amidst latest reports that PM Conte will deliver another revised 2019 budget draft with deficit circa 2.0%. EUR/USD back above 1.1400 (with 1.234bln option expiries between 1.1400-05) but just stopped short of a key Fib at 1.1424.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK,CHF&nbsp; &ndash; Upbeat Norwegian regional network report with the backdrop of rising oil prices has benefitted the Crown with EUR/NOK falling below 9.6500 ahead of a Fib level at 9.6345. Conversely, Swiss CPI was softer than expected tempering the Franc&rsquo;s safe-haven allure with USD/CHF pivoting 0.9950 and EUR/CHF at the upper end of a 1.1330-1.1345 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; Antipodeans are overall on the front foot , AUD and NZD up around 0.5% vs. the buck. The RBA kept interest rates at 1.5% as expected, while the statement noted that Australia&rsquo;s terms of trade have been stronger than expected. AUD/USD stopped just shy of 0.7400 (vs. low of 0.7350) while Kiwi tested above 0.6950 vs. buck (vs. low of 0.6925) ahead of the latest NZ GDT auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &ndash;Turkish Lira remains pressured by the ongoing recovery in oil prices (large net importer). USD/TRY trading around 5.30 with concerns that the Central Bank may prematurely loosen policy (aided by the slowdown in CPI) also weighing on investors&rsquo; minds. However, the ZAR is the clear EM outperformer amid the latest SA GDP figures showing the country has recovered out of recession, while a rally gold (major producer) is also providing the Rand with impetus. Finally, CNY undergoes another day of strengthening in a continuation from the G20 momentum. USD/CNY trading comfortably below 6.8500 after the PBoC set the strongest Yuan fix since June last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds continue to consolidate since the gap higher on the open and failure to break the 162 handle as the post G-20 risk appetite subsides further. The German 10 year benchmark hovers around the 161.80 area and did not really reactive to the increase in EZ PPI after yields declined to 5 month lows of 0.279%. This came as the Italian 10 year future dipped to test the 125.10 level ahead of PM Conte&rsquo;s latest 2019 budget presentation to see whether the revised draft finally meets EU approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the retreat in Gilts from 122.31, post the ECJ&rsquo;s opinion piece on the unilateral right to reverse Brexit, has seen the UK 10-year bond break below yesterday&rsquo;s close of 122.97 to 122.76, with further pressure from an upbeat construction PMI (hot on the heels of Monday&#39;s manufacturing beat) and pre-2024 auction concession, which was relatively well received, but did not stop the rot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, US yields are seeing significant curve flattening after yesterday&#39;s inversion at the short end (3s-5s), as 10-year yields retreat through the 3.0% level to ~2.95% ahead of this week&rsquo;s key events in the form of supply (on the short end), and NFP squeezed into a shortened trading week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+2.2%) and WTI (+2.2%) have continued to rise on expectations for a cut at the upcoming OPEC+ meeting, with any cut likely to take into account the reduction to Canadian output which is also supporting oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices came off highs after Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih stated that it is premature to suggest that OPEC+ will reduce output at the meeting this week, in turn hinting division amongst OPEC members. Initial source reports suggest that OPEC+ are working towards a minimum output cut of 1.3mln BPD from the October levels. However, Russia&rsquo;s position of a maximum output cut of 150k BPD is the main obstacle to this, as OPEC want a minimum cut of 250-350k BPD. With sources suggest that OPEC may delay cuts if Russia does not agree to a substantial output cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking ahead we have API data later in the day, with expectations being that crude stocks fell by 2.25mln/bbl for the week; if expectations prove accurate this will be the first crude oil draw since mid-September. Additionally, the weekly EIA release has been pushed back to Thursday at 16:00 GMT, due to the national day of mourning for Former President George H.W. Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold hit a session high of USD 1238.83, reaching its highest value since the end of October, as the dollar continues to weaken on a decline in US yields following the positive G20 trade outcomes. Steel futures have hit a 7-month low as prices are pressured by the oversupplied market, this comes after the positive sentiment seen in base metals on Monday from US-China trade developments. Separately, palladium (+1.0%) hit a record high of USD 1221.95 earlier in the session.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, the JPY is taking advantage of the ongoing buck decline and a marked downturn in risk sentiment after initial US-China truce euphoria, with USD/JPY taking out the Tenken line at 113.34, a Fib level at 113.17 and the 55DMA at 113.05 to hit a low of 112.75 (ahead of the psychological 112.50 and the 100-DMA at 112.25)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; On the backfoot again with the index retreating further from 97.000 to trip stops at 96.400 and register a fresh post-G20 low of 96.372. This against the backdrop of broad Dollar losses vs. its major counterpart and a sharp retreat in US Treasury yields with the long-end of the curve outperforming.&nbsp;<br />EUR &ndash; Also benefitting from the Greenback&rsquo;s misfortunes and hopes that Italy vs. EU fiscal friction may be resolved amidst latest reports that PM Conte will deliver another revised 2019 budget draft with deficit circa 2.0%. EUR/USD back above 1.1400 (with 1.234bln option expiries between 1.1400-05) but just stopped short of a key Fib at 1.1424. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK,CHF &nbsp;&ndash; Upbeat Norwegian regional network report with the backdrop of rising oil prices has benefitted the Crown with EUR/NOK falling below 9.6500 ahead of a Fib level at 9.6345. Conversely, Swiss CPI was softer than expected tempering the Franc&rsquo;s safe-haven allure with USD/CHF pivoting 0.9950 and EUR/CHF at the upper end of a 1.1330-1.1345 range.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; Antipodeans are overall on the front foot , AUD and NZD up around 0.5% vs. the buck. The RBA kept interest rates at 1.5% as expected, while the statement noted that Australia&rsquo;s terms of trade have been stronger than expected. AUD/USD stopped just shy of 0.7400 (vs. low of 0.7350) while Kiwi tested above 0.6950 vs. buck (vs. low of 0.6925) ahead of the latest NZ GDT auction. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &ndash;Turkish Lira remains pressured by the ongoing recovery in oil prices (large net importer). USD/TRY trading around 5.30 with concerns that the Central Bank may prematurely loosen policy (aided by the slowdown in CPI) also weighing on investors&rsquo; minds. However, the ZAR is the clear EM outperformer amid the latest SA GDP figures showing the country has recovered out of recession, while a rally gold (major producer) is also providing the Rand with impetus. Finally, CNY undergoes another day of strengthening in a continuation from the G20 momentum. USD/CNY trading comfortably below 6.8500 after the PBoC set the strongest Yuan fix since June last year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME&nbsp;</strong><br />Bunds continue to consolidate since the gap higher on the open and failure to break the 162 handle as the post G-20 risk appetite subsides further. The German 10 year benchmark hovers around the 161.80 area and did not really reactive to the increase in EZ PPI after yields declined to 5 month lows of 0.279%. This came as the Italian 10 year future dipped to test the 125.10 level ahead of PM Conte&rsquo;s latest 2019 budget presentation to see whether the revised draft finally meets EU approval.&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile, the retreat in Gilts from 122.31, post the ECJ&rsquo;s opinion piece on the unilateral right to reverse Brexit, has seen the UK 10-year bond break below yesterday&rsquo;s close of 122.97 to 122.76, with further pressure from an upbeat construction PMI (hot on the heels of Monday&#39;s manufacturing beat) and pre-2024 auction concession, which was relatively well received, but did not stop the rot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, US yields are seeing significant curve flattening after yesterday&#39;s inversion at the short end (3s-5s), as 10-year yields retreat through the 3.0% level to ~2.95% ahead of this week&rsquo;s key events in the form of supply (on the short end), and NFP squeezed into a shortened trading week.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES &nbsp;</strong><br />Brent (+2.2%) and WTI (+2.2%) have continued to rise on expectations for a cut at the upcoming OPEC+ meeting, with any cut likely to take into account the reduction to Canadian output which is also supporting oil prices. &nbsp;<br />Prices came off highs after Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih stated that it is premature to suggest that OPEC+ will reduce output at the meeting this week, in turn hinting division amongst OPEC members. Initial source reports suggest that OPEC+ are working towards a minimum output cut of 1.3mln BPD from the October levels. However, Russia&rsquo;s position of a maximum output cut of 150k BPD is the main obstacle to this, as OPEC want a minimum cut of 250-350k BPD. With sources suggest that OPEC may delay cuts if Russia does not agree to a substantial output cut. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking ahead we have API data later in the day, with expectations being that crude stocks fell by 2.25mln/bbl for the week; if expectations prove accurate this will be the first crude oil draw since mid-September. Additionally, the weekly EIA release has been pushed back to Thursday at 16:00 GMT, due to the national day of mourning for Former President George H.W. Bush.&nbsp;<br />Gold hit a session high of USD 1238.83, reaching its highest value since the end of October, as the dollar continues to weaken on a decline in US yields following the positive G20 trade outcomes. Steel futures have hit a 7-month low as prices are pressured by the oversupplied market, this comes after the positive sentiment seen in base metals on Monday from US-China trade developments. Separately, palladium (+1.0%) hit a record high of USD 1221.95 earlier in the session.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Gilts retreated from 122.31 to a 123.11 low vs yesterday&rsquo;s 122.97 close before finding underlying bids, while the 3 month strip is 1-2 ticks above parity having been 3 ticks ahead at best, in stark contrast to the Pound that spiked to circa 1.2785 vs the Dollar and around 0.8905&nbsp;vs the Euro before running out of momentum. Still to come, the construction PMI, Gbp2.5 bn 2024 DMO supply, the first official day of Brexit debating before December 11&rsquo;s meaningful vote in Parliament, the contempt ruling and BoE testimony to a TSC on the impact of leaving the EU under various scenarios, which looked rather bleak and worse than Government analysis when published last week.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (-2.4%) were lower from the open in which a pullback in consumer and energy stocks led the downside in Australia and with Japanese sentiment dampened by a firmer currency. An indecisive tone was seen in the Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) amid a lack of fresh drivers and as participants await the next developments of the US-China trade saga with China reportedly considering possibilities of lowering US auto tariffs. In addition, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was said to be hopeful for an agreement but warned tariffs will be implemented if a deal fails to materialize, while China reportedly censored a post by the US Embassy regarding the recent trade developments and tariff ceasefire which some have suggested could be a possible effort to avoid looking weak or that it gave in to US pressure. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded higher amid the risk averse tone and as they tracked the overnight gains in T-notes. This coincided with the US 10yr Treasury yield dropping below its 200DMA for the first time in around a year, while the US 2yr/10yr spread continued to narrow to its flattest in over a decade. Today also saw a 10yr auction from Japan, although there was a muted reaction as the auction bore mixed results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

This came after UK Speaker of the House Bercow decided to grant the debate amid allegations of contempt over the lack of legal advice from the government over Brexit and later stated that there is an arguable case the UK government may be in contempt of parliament by declining to release its full Brexit legal advice.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eurogroup said it plans to back the EU&#39;s Commission view on Italy&#39;s budget and that fiscal expansion in Italy is particularly worrying. Elsewhere, there were comments from Italian PM Conte that he is not working on a 2019 budget which has a deficit below 2%, while Italy Deputy PM Salvini said the basics of the Italian budget will not change and that they have no interest in a collision with the EU commission. (Newswires/ANSA) It was later reported that Italy&#39;s Deputy PMs Di Maio and Salvini are said to be open to a possible 2% deficit. However, Italian press noted that a budget deficit at 2% is not low enough for the EU. EU estimates that Italy needs to cut budgets by around EUR 12bln. (Corriere/Messaggero/Stampa)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Weidmann (Hawk) said policy will remain expansive even after QE ends, while he added they should not delay normalisation unnecessarily and that the next step depends on data. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD softened against its major counterparts with the DXY back below the 97.00 level amid a decline in US yields, which benefitted both EUR/USD and GBP/USD despite gains being initially capped as Europe and UK face ongoing issues regarding the Italian budget friction and Brexit-related uncertainty. USD/JPY declined due to the risk averse tone and losses in the greenback, while USD/CNH fell over 300 pips as China&rsquo;s currency extended on post-G20 advances after the PBoC strengthened the fix by the most since June last year. Elsewhere, AUD/USD was initially indecisive due to mixed data but then rose following the conclusion of an unsurprising RBA policy decision to keep rates on hold, as the USD continued to suffer across the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA kept the Cash Rate at the record low 1.50% as expected and reiterated that low rates are supporting the economy. The RBA also repeated that progress on inflation and unemployment is expected to be gradual, while it expects GDP to average 3.5% over 2 years. Furthermore, the RBA stated household consumption is a continuing source of uncertainty but commented that terms of trade had been stronger than earlier anticipated.

Elsewhere, gold gained on broad weakness in the greenback with the precious metal up around USD 14.00 per ounce for the week, while copper was lacklustre as the risk sentiment soured during Asia trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC key-members are reportedly returning to determine a new output deal, despite Qatar&#39;s withdrawal from the group.

(Newswires/Politico)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Economic Advisor Kudlow said he is cautiously optimistic about China-US deal and that they are pretty close to deal on IP, while he also stated that China is committed to lifting tariffs and non-tariff barriers immediately including the 40% auto tariffs and retaliatory tariffs on US commodities. Furthermore, Kudlow commented that the 90-day US-China truce will begin January 1st, although the White House later corrected this and stated that the truce began on December 1st.

In addition, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was said to be hopeful for an agreement but warned tariffs will be implemented if a deal fails to materialize, while China reportedly censored a post by the US Embassy regarding the recent trade developments and tariff ceasefire which some have suggested could be a possible effort to avoid looking weak or that it gave in to US pressure. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded higher amid the risk averse tone and as they tracked the overnight gains in T-notes. This coincided with the US 10yr Treasury yield dropping below its 200DMA for the first time in around a year, while the US 2yr/10yr spread continued to narrow to its flattest in over a decade. Today also saw a 10yr auction from Japan, although there was a muted reaction as the auction bore mixed results.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Preview: RBA expected to keep rates at record low of 1.50% in policy decision due at 0330GMT",
        "content": "<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia are forecast to maintain the status quo at its final policy meeting of 2018 with ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures pricing in 100% expectations for the Cash Rate Target to be maintained at the record low 1.50% where it has been since August 2016. Furthermore, the implied yield curve continues to suggest February 2020 as the earliest for when the curve is leaning more towards a hike rather than a hold, while a recent major newswire poll showed 23 out of 38 economists view a hike by March 2020, while 13 are calling for rates to be kept unchanged until mid-2020 and that 2 anticipate a future cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rhetoric from the central bank remains supportive of the view for the RBA to stick to its prolonged pause as Governor Lowe recently stated steady policy is to be maintained for &#39;a while yet&#39; and that it is likely rates will increase at some point if the economy progresses as expected. The minutes from the last meeting also reiterated the board saw no strong case for a near-term rate move and that the next move is likely to be up rather than down, which was inline with the view from the RBA&rsquo;s latest quarterly Statement of Monetary Policy. In addition, the RBA noted there could be a more pronounced drop in the unemployment rate during the near-term and that it sees GDP growth to be above trend over the forecast period, which highly suggests looser policy is currently unnecessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data releases from Australia have been mixed with jobs data firmer than expected as Employment Change topped estimates at 32.8k vs. Exp. 20.0k and the Unemployment Rate unexpectedly remained steady at 5.0% vs. Exp. 5.1% (Prev. 5.0%) despite a higher Participation Rate. Conversely, Construction Work completed for Q3 disappointed at -2.8% vs. Exp. 1.0% (Prev. 1.6%) and Capex data was somewhat inconclusive as the headline Private Capital Expenditure contracted for Q3 at -0.5% vs. Exp. 1.1% (Prev. -2.5%) although the equally important Private Capital Expenditure Estimate 4 for 2018-2019 was revised higher to 114.1B from Prev. 102.0B. These varied releases therefore support&nbsp;the case for a wait and see approach, while the central bank will also get to digest the latest GDP figures this Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate decision is scheduled at 0330GMT/2130CDT/1130HKT, although no major fireworks are expected from the announcement as has been the case for quite some time now considering the predictability of the central bank and its propensity to stick to its regular statements.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade mostly negative as the relief rally fizzles out in the region with investors booking their recent profits. ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) were lower from the open with a pullback in energy stocks leading the downside in Australia and with Japanese sentiment dampened by a firmer currency. Elsewhere, a non-committal tone is seen in the Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) amid a lack of fresh drivers and as participants eye the next developments of the US-China trade saga with China reportedly considering possibilities of lowering US auto tariffs, while there were also recent comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin who was hopeful for a real agreement but also warned tariffs will be implemented if a deal fails to materialize. In addition, China reportedly censored a post by the US Embassy regarding the recent trade developments/tariff ceasefire which some have suggested could be a possible effort to avoid looking weak or that it gave in to US pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD is softer against its major counterparts with the DXY back below the 97.00 level amid a decline in US yields, which benefitted both EUR/USD and GBP/USD but with gains only moderate as Europe and UK face ongoing issues regarding the Italian budget friction and Brexit-related uncertainty. USD/JPY declined due to the risk averse tone and losses in the greenback, while USD/CNH briefly broke below 6.8600 with China&rsquo;s currency extending on post-G20 advances after the PBoC strengthened the fix by the most since June last year. Conversely, this failed to support the China-exposed AUD/USD which is indecisive after mixed data and as focus shifts to the RBA rate decision later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid the risk averse tone and as they track the overnight gains in T-notes. This coincides with the US 10yr Treasury yield dropping below its 200DMA for the first time in around a year, while the US 2yr/10yr spread continued to narrow to its flattest in over a decade.</p>\r\n",
