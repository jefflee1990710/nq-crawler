Philip Lowe, the RBA governor, has recently played down expectations for a hike in the near term, saying that the timing of a move &ldquo;will depend on the extent and pace of progress that we make in reducing the unemployment rate and having inflation return to target&rdquo;. He added that he expects this progress to be only gradual, indicating that the board does not see a strong case for a hike in the near term. Economists as CBA say that the RBA&rsquo;s recent communication has struck a helpful balance between taking an optimistic stance on the economic outlook while managing to hose down interest rate expectations. The minutes are expected to echo these recent communications, signalling that rate hikes are still some way off and when they do come, are expected to be at a gradual pace</p>\r\n",

On the charts, nearest supports for Eur/Usd and Cable come in around 1.2371-76 (Fib and DMA) and 1.3920, and resistance at 1.2555 and 1.4151. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy meandered within an extremely narrow band near the top of wider 106.10-65 parameters and mostly around the 106.50 level that is essentially also on a key chart Fib. The Aud just kept its head above 0.7900 vs the Greenback and its other G10 counterparts ahead of several potential risk events starting with a speech by RBA&rsquo;s Bullock later today, the latest policy meeting minutes on Tuesday and wage data on Wednesday when a very large 0.7950 option expiry strike runs off (3.2 bn). On the flow side, offers are reported at 0.7940 and in chart terms the 20 DMA is at 0.7956. Trading volumes and conditions have been impacted by Asian, US and Canadian holidays not to mention the usual Monday lethargy, but the potential more decent market moves and price action ratchets up as the week unfolds given FOMC and ECB minutes, the BoE&rsquo;s QIR testimony plus some key data and survey releases.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU bourses trade with little in the way of firm direction (Eurostoxx 50 flat) after erasing opening gains in what&rsquo;s been a quiet session thus far ahead of the US holiday. In terms of sector specifics, consumer staples have been softer throughout the morning following a disappointing earnings update from Reckitt Benckiser (-5%) which has sent their shares to the bottom of the FSTE 100 and on track for their worst daily performance since 2015. In sympathy, Nestle (-0.9%) are also seen lower and subsequently has placed some weight on the SMI (-0.2%). Elsewhere, other notable movers include Daimler (-2%) who have fallen victim to reports in German press that the Co. included emissions-cheating software on their diesel models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY appears to have established a firmer foothold above the 89.000 level, but the Greenback is struggling to break a few big figures and extend its recovery from last week&rsquo;s multi year lows in holiday-thinned markets (several Asian centres still shut and the US out for Presidents&rsquo; Day). Eur/Usd has dipped below 1.2400 and Cable just under 1.4000, but both pairs continue come back strong suggesting decent demand if not solid bidding interest for the single currency and Sterling respectively. Eur/Usd also remains technically bullish while above its 21 and 10 DMAs (1.2376 and 1.2355 respectively) and key Fib supports (50% at 1.2371 and 68% at 1.2340), with buying interest also touted at 1.2350. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy has bounced off overnight lows and further above the 106.00 handle within a 106.10-65 range, but remains bearish having closed sub-106.51 last week (key Fib) and ahead of its 106.73 descending 100 HMA. Elsewhere in the G10 arena, the Aud is outperforming back above 0.7900 vs its US counterpart ahead of key local events, like RBA minutes and wage data, while a mega 0.7950 (3.2 bn) option expiry on Wednesday may also be exerting some upside influence. In terms of positioning, latest weekly CTFC data shows another reduction in Usd net shorts by spec accounts, while Eur and Gbp longs were trimmed again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More downside on Eurex where the 10 year German bond and other Eurozone debt futures have extended losses, former to 31 ticks at a fresh 158.30 low. Interestingly the latest leg down has not come alongside or coincided with any further stock gains, so rather than asset-switching or related flows the selling in fixed looks independent. Indeed, French OATs, Italian BTPs and Spanish Bonos are all on the rack, in stark contrast to Greek bonds that are revelling in bullish upgrade trade. Gilts are holding up better, and actually rebounded further from early Liffe lows to a fresk intraday peak at 121.22 (-6 ticks vs -23 ticks at one stage) before fading again, while USTs are basically side-lined and idling in quiet overnight trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures trade higher after WTI reclaimed USD 62/bbl during Asia-Pac trade with energy newsflow otherwise particularly light. That said, markets will be monitoring the geopolitical landscape after Israeli PM Netanyahu labelled Iran as &ldquo;the greatest threat to our world&rdquo;, with the Saudi Arabian foreign minister claiming that Iran is the &ldquo;most dangerous nation for cyber attacks&rdquo;. In the metals complex, spot gold trades with little in the way of firm direction after largely tracking fluctuations in the USD. Elsewhere, copper prices in London have been hampered by the firmer USD with price action otherwise relatively contained given Chinese participants away from market. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asian bourses get off to a firm start to the week, with the ASX 200 (+0.4%), Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) and KOSPI (+0.8%) trading with modest gains. ASX 200 has been supported by strength observed in financial, subsequently offsetting the losses in Woodside Petroleum (-6%) following AUD 2.5bln capital raising. South Korean participants have return from their elongated break to catch up with last weeks global equity recovery. Nikkei 225 has been buoyed by encouraging trade data, whereby exports rose for a 14<sup>th</sup> consecutive month. Markets have been somewhat quiet given the Lunar New Year holiday with Chinese markets out of action until Wednesday (HK reopens tomorrow)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A familiar story for the USD, which is on the back foot against its major counterparts after slipping through the 89.00 figure, potentially setting another retest around key support at 88.25-30. Commodity currencies are tracking oil prices higher today with WTI making a break above USD 62, largely owing to the USD selling theme. Eyes on AUD this week, with RBA minutes due out tomorrow, alongside key wage data later this week. Cross-related buying in AUD/NZD have kept AUD above 0.79&nbsp;for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across Asia FX, the SGD will come into focus later today with the finance minister set to announce the latest budget at 0730GMT. Expectations are for the finance minister to hike the GST by 1-2%, which some suggest may increase speculation that the MAS could potentially tighten monetary policy in April. The appreciation in the THB seems to have had a dampening effect on Thailand&rsquo;s growth in Q4 as the latest figures missed analyst estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very quiet session in the fixed income space with Japanese yields relatively flat across the curve. Elsewhere, Aussie yields have shown a slight bull flattening bias today. AU-US 10 spreads (+0.1bps) continue to remain at the tightest levels since 1998.</p>\r\n",
