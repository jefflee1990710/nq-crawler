The EUR range was narrow, between c.1.2350 and just under 1.24, with offers around the latter preventing a meaningful test. The strength in crude prices helped push USDCAD lower and penetrating 1.2550 briefly. AUD and NZD were lower, in line with risk sentiment.

As trade progressed, there was a rebound, however, and the Emini turned slightly positive until the hawkish tone of the FOMC meeting minutes led to negative ticks in the Emini, before once again basing around the almost magnetic 2,650 level, before dipping into the close. In stock specifics, toymaker Mattel (MAT) led the NDX in Wednesday trade following an upgrade from Jefferies. On the flipside of the NDX, Fastenal (FAST) was the largest laggard following its Q1 earnings report (mostly in line), but it noted its gross profit did fell and net sales were also down. FAST was also the laggard of the S&amp;P. On the positive side, SPX gains were led by Hilton Worldwide (HLT) following a secondary stock offering at $73/shr, and reports that HNA China is selling the shares and that the proceeds from the sale will not be received by the hotel business. Exxon (XOM) led the DJI tracking crude prices higher, but Boeing (BA) a laggard - energy was the only green sector on Wednesday. Telecoms, meanwhile, underperformed. M&amp;A news was light, but CBC (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) took the limelight again after CNBC&rsquo;s Faber noted the former is expected to make another offer soon for the latter, but the new bid will likely be insufficient; pre-market reports also suggested Shari Redstone is considering a merger with or without CBS CEO Moonves. Separately, Analogic (ALOG) is going to be purchased by PE firm Altaris Capital Partners for USD 84/shr, significantly lower than the closing price on Tuesday of $96.05. SPX -0.55% at 2642, NDX -0.49% at 6583 , DJI -0.90% at 24189.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spite of geopolitical risks spooking traders, lending a bid to some haven assets, the Treasury complex was only slightly higher on the day, with the curve modestly bull-flattening, and major curve spreads narrowed once again (5s30s at 38bps now, while 2s30s slipped by nearly 3bps to 68bps). There was some knee-jerk buying of Treasuries as US President Trump ramped-up the rhetoric, telling Russia to &lsquo;expect missiles&rsquo; in Syria, and the buying pushed 30-year yields to beneath the 3.00% handle, while 10s visited 2.75%. The Treasury&rsquo;s 10-year auction was soft, seeing a tail of 0.5bps (recent averages suggested it would come in on the screws).&nbsp; The internals were grim, with indirect participation the lowest since January 2015, leaving directs and dealers with participation above recent averages. The soft auction had surprised a few analysts, particularly amid demand for haven assets today, as the US prepares military action in Syria. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 2+ ticks higher at 120-27.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 11 April 2018: Markets on edge as US prepares potential military action in the middle east  ",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT: Stocks lower, USD flat, treasuries higher, oil higher<br />* REAR-VIEW: Geopolitical tensions rise, Hawkish FOMC Minutes, US CPI in-line<br />* AHEAD: Trump decision on Syria, Asia C-bank speak, Earnings season gets underway </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Following Russia&rsquo;s warning that US military action in Syria over alleged use of chemical weapons will be met with Russian assistance to Syria, US President Trump upped the rhetoric, warning Russia to &ldquo;get ready&rdquo; for missiles. There were further reports on Wednesday that pro-government forces in Syria had begun evacuating airports and military basis in preparation for US strikes. US defence secretary Mattis said the US is assessing intelligence on Syrian chemical attack, and the military stands ready to provide options upon the order from President Trump. Meanwhile, a Russian official said that Moscow and US militaries were in contact over Syria. Later reports suggested that President Trump will make a decision on Syria on Wednesday evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS:</strong> News flow was quiet on Wednesday, partly because the market&rsquo;s attention has been fixed on geopolitics. Trump will be meeting members of Congress tomorrow to discuss tariffs. Elsewhere, traders are on the look-out for the US Treasury&rsquo;s semi-annual currency report, which is set to be released &lsquo;mid-April&rsquo;. Attention will be on whether the US labels China a currency manipulator, or not. The move might be seen as a belligerent escalation, and instead, some are of the opinion that, ahead of midterms, the US may make an example out of other nations &ndash; perhaps India or Thailand &ndash; to demonstrate it is taking action against alleged currency manipulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CPI MM (Mar) -0.10% (Exp. 0.00%, Prev. 0.20%); US CPI YY (Mar) 2.40% (Exp. 2.40%, Prev. 2.20%).</strong> US headline CPI increased to 2.4% YY, as anticipated, from 2.2%, largely on base effects led by cell phone price plans adding 0.2ppts alone to the figure. The core measure rose to 2.1% YY in line with estimates, above 2.0% for the first time since March 2017. The gains were in part offset by lower apparel and used car prices, which fell by 0.3%. The core measure was also lifted by higher medical care prices. Nonetheless, the recent 5% decline in oil prices pushed the MM figure into negative territory at -0.1%. Analysts have said that the firmer than expected PPI prints as well as the solid CPI data will likely keep the Fed firmly on track for another 25bps rate hike in June. There was little market reaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOMC MEETING MINUTES:</strong> Although the March meeting minutes contained few major surprises, the tone was hawkish, while traders also noted that the central bank was more confident in the medium-term trajectory for inflation.

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT: Stocks lower, USD flat, treasuries higher, oil higher<br />* REAR-VIEW: Geopolitical tensions rise, Hawkish FOMC Minutes, US CPI in-line<br />* AHEAD: Trump decision on Syria, Asia C-bank speak, Earnings season gets underway </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Following Russia&rsquo;s warning that US military action in Syria over alleged use of chemical weapons will be met with Russian assistance to Syria, US President Trump upped the rhetoric, warning Russia to &ldquo;get ready&rdquo; for missiles. There were further reports on Wednesday that pro-government forces in Syria had begun evacuating airports and military basis in preparation for US strikes. US defence secretary Mattis said the US is assessing intelligence on Syrian chemical attack, and the military stands ready to provide options upon the order from President Trump. Meanwhile, a Russian official said that Moscow and US militaries were in contact over Syria. Later reports suggested that President Trump will make a decision on Syria on Wednesday evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS:</strong> News flow was quiet on Wednesday, partly because the market&rsquo;s attention has been fixed on geopolitics. Trump will be meeting members of Congress tomorrow to discuss tariffs. Elsewhere, traders are on the look-out for the US Treasury&rsquo;s semi-annual currency report, which is set to be released &lsquo;mid-April&rsquo;. Attention will be on whether the US labels China a currency manipulator, or not. The move might be seen as a belligerent escalation, and instead, some are of the opinion that, ahead of midterms, the US may make an example out of other nations &ndash; perhaps India or Thailand &ndash; to demonstrate it is taking action against alleged currency manipulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CPI MM (Mar) -0.10% (Exp. 0.00%, Prev. 0.20%); US CPI YY (Mar) 2.40% (Exp. 2.40%, Prev. 2.20%).</strong> US headline CPI increased to 2.4% YY, as anticipated, from 2.2%, largely on base effects led by cell phone price plans adding 0.2ppts alone to the figure. The core measure rose to 2.1% YY in line with estimates, above 2.0% for the first time since March 2017. The gains were in part offset by lower apparel and used car prices, which fell by 0.3%. The core measure was also lifted by higher medical care prices. Nonetheless, the recent 5% decline in oil prices pushed the MM figure into negative territory at -0.1%. Analysts have said that the firmer than expected PPI prints as well as the solid CPI data will likely keep the Fed firmly on track for another 25bps rate hike in June. There was little market reaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOMC MEETING MINUTES:</strong> Although the March meeting minutes contained few major surprises, the tone was hawkish, while traders also noted that the central bank was more confident in the medium-term trajectory for inflation. Q1 growth weakness is seen as transitory. While the FOMC reiterated gradual hikes, the kicker was the line that &ldquo;several participants expressed the judgment that it would likely become appropriate at some point for the Committee to set the federal funds rate above its longer run normal value for a time&rdquo; which traders cited for a (delayed) hawkish market reaction (which saw USD strength, though Treasuries were more inert).

There is also optimism that the OPEC and IEA reports, due Thursday and Friday respectively, will take a bullish tone as the EIA STEO did on Monday (2018 supply growth cut, 2019 supply growth estimated raised; 2018 demand view raised, as was 2019).

        "content": "<p>The US Treasury will auction USD 62bln in 3-year notes (USD 30bln, Tuesday), 10-year bonds ($21bln, Wednesday) and 30-year bonds ($13bln, Thursday). With a total of USD 76.5bln maturing at mid-month settlement, the auction will actually pay down USD 12.5bln in the week. The previous 10 year auction was relatively uneventful as the issuance stopped on the screws and the cover was in line with 6- auction average. TD Securities say they expect a solid auction if 10s trade around 2.90-2.95%, but would expect a softer auction around 2.80%. At pixel time the 10y yield is 2.79%. Barclays note there has been a recent pick up in foreign demand and on a 3- month moving average basis, foreign demand is up 9ppts to 25%. It will be interesting to see if this trend continues amid the ongoing trade war rhetoric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent 10-year auction history:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>High yield: (prev. 2.889% vs six-auction average of 2.554%)</li>\r\n  <li>Tail: (prev. stop on the WI vs six-auction average of stopping on the WI</li>\r\n  <li>Bid-to-cover: (prev. 2.50x vs six-auction average of 2.49x)</li>\r\n  <li>Dealers: (prev. 27.3% vs six-auction average of 26.5%)</li>\r\n  <li>Directs: (prev. 6.5% vs six-auction average of 7.0%)</li>\r\n  <li>Indirects: (prev. 66.2% vs six-auction average of 66.6%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"325\" src=\"/system/ckeditor_assets/pictures/30/content_Capture.JPG\" width=\"800\" /></p>\r\n",

Headline CPI MM is set to remain subdued in March following the 5% decline in oil prices. Nonetheless, any uptick in the headline is likely to place upward pressure on the YY headline, the consultancy says.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) was also lacklustre with J Front the worst off amongst the retailers on expectations of weaker profits this year, while SoftBank outperformed on M&amp;A hopes after reports its unit Sprint and T-Mobile renewed merger talks. Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) were initially choppy as participants digested the miss on Chinese CPI and PPI data, although stocks gradually found some comfort from efforts by PBoC Governor Yi Gang to build upon the momentum from President Xi at the Boao forum in which the PBoC Governor talked about opening up and announced to increase stock connect quotas. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat as prices lacked direction amid an indecisive risk tone in the region, while the BoJ also kept the amounts of its Rinban announcement unchanged at just over JPY 1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC sets CNY mid-point at 6.2911 (Prev. 6.3071). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skips open market operations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA Governor Lowe says board does not see a strong case for raising interest rates in the near term; more likely next move in cash rate will be up rather than down. While some central banks are hiking rates, Australian circumstances are different. Serious escalation of trade tensions would risk health of the economy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda says BoJ will continue powerful QE to meet inflation target, adds that there are expectations for consumer prices to keep rising. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US-led coalition is asking all Middle East flight companies to change itinerary for next 48 hours amid possible strike, according to Kurdistan24. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French President Macron says chemical weapons were used in Syria and that a reaction is coming in days. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All Syria military bases are said to be on high alert as a US attack is expected, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yemen Houthi rebels say they have launched a drone attack at an Aramco facility in south Saudi Arabia. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Chief Negotiator Barnier states that the UK still has enough time to re-evaluate the relationship it wants with the UK after Brexit, offering PM May an opportunity to move towards a closer relationship with the EU after the break-up. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK Industrial Output YY (Feb) 2.20% vs. Exp. 2.90% (Prev. 1.60%, Rev. 1.20%)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK Industrial Output MM (Feb) 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.40% (Prev. 1.30%)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equities began the day trading slightly lower (Stoxx 600 -0.2%) with the risk-on sentiment seen in yesterday&rsquo;s trade not being echoed early on. This comes to fruition despite the revelations from Chinese president Xi mentioning a preference to implement auto tariff cuts as soon as possible (this relating to a possible reduction on import taxes on autos by half from 25% currently). Market sentiment is largely being guided by increased tensions in Syria amid potentially imminent military action by the US. This follows on from overnight news of increased air traffic over Syrian airspace and condemnation from the international community.&nbsp; EU equity sector performance has largely been driven by company specific news with Deutsche Telekom (+4%) driving the telecoms sector higher (+0.7%) as T-Mobile, a company in which they own 64% of shares, has restarted deal talks with Sprint. Elsewhere, Tesco are seen higher (+6.2%) amid encouraging earnings, whilst Hammerson shares are seen lower (-1.9%) post the rejection of a revised proposal from Klepierre for GBP 3.65/share and finally CHR Hansen also lag their peers (-4%) amid a miss on earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX, remains narrowly mixed against G10 peers, but the Index looks prone to another downturn and test of near term chart support ahead of 89.000, with the late March low around 89.250 an obvious target. Optimism surrounding US-China trade negotiations have been somewhat neutralised or even negated by the Syrian situation. However, the Dollar could receive a reprieve from upcoming headline inflation data and or FOMC minutes. Several factors appear to have lifted GBP ahead of data with market observers still noting the bullish April seasonal element (even though the weather is still far from favourable), and of course Tuesday&rsquo;s promptings from BoE hawk McCafferty. Reports suggesting an olive branch offered by chief EU Brexit negotiator Barnier may also be impacting as Cable climbed above 1.4200 and tested the next tech resistance zone 1.4215-25 (above the 10 DMA). Note, contacts reported selling in EUR/GBP from 0.8710 down to 0.8703 in the run up to the 9.30BST releases but in the event buyers were thwarted by weak output numbers vs an encouraging smaller trade shortfall. Renowned safe-havens have diverged yet again, as USD/JPY continues to hug 107.00 amidst option expiry interest at the strike, but with a more offered tone on the aforementioned geopolitical jitters. Conversely, USD/CHF is back up near 0.9600 vs circa 0.9550 at one stage, while EUR/CHF has rallied to fresh post-SNB floor removal highs around 1.1880, with M&amp;A related flows perhaps impacting alongside more official activity, according to others. EUR is edging more gains towards 1.2400, but hampered by offers ahead of the next big figure and also wary of decent expiries between 1.2345-60 (1.8bn). ECB minutes and speeches may provide more independent direction after hawkish comments from Nowotny on Tuesday were confirmed as personal rather than a collective policy view. AUD/NZD/CAD are seeing a degree of consolidation after recent relative big moves and overall outperformance vs the US counterpart with AUD/USD meeting resistance ahead of 0.7800 (at 0.7785) after sub-forecast Chinese inflation data, a moderation in consumer sentiment and another RBA signal that rates are not going up in the near term. The Kiwi has slipped back from near 0.7375 highs to test support around 0.7350 and USD/CAD is pivoting around 1.2600.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts got a fraction more positive momentum from the overall weakness in February factory output, or rather the lack of production in certain sectors to be precise, with a marginal and fleeting uptick. However, the core UK bond is back in range between 122.29-42 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 122.25 close, with Bunds also consolidating off best levels, but retaining an underlying bid (upper end of 159.37-17 parameters vs Tuesday&rsquo;s 159.05 Eurex settlement) eyeing further impetus from the impending ECB events. Technically, the 10 year German benchmark has not clearly breached the nearest upside chart resistance area from 159.30-35 that would open up pre-Nowotny levels around 159.50. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain relatively lacklustre ahead of CPI, FOMC minutes and the 10 year auction, after a lacklustre 3 year sale to kick-off this week&rsquo;s supply. On that note, Germany&rsquo;s 30 year tap was not even given a lukewarm greeting by investors, but the relatively limited negative reaction in futures is testament to as degree of demand for safe-haven debt in the current fragile risk climate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany sells EUR 1.043bln vs. Exp. EUR 1.5bln 2.5% 2046 Bund with a b/c 1.0 (prev. b/c 1.8), average yield 1.12% (prev. 1.29%) and retention of 30.47% (prev. 19.5%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures trade relatively flat following yesterday&rsquo;s circa 3.7% gains. Downside was initially seen in the wake of last night&rsquo;s unexpected build in the API inventories (+1.758mln vs. Exp. -0.200mln) with comments from the Iranian oil minster stating that USD 60/bbl is a good price for oil given current conditions with USD 70/bbl too high a level. Note, the comments appear to be at odds with reports yesterday suggesting that Saudi are to seek an oil price of around USD 80/bbl. However, losses were short-lived with traders mindful of any geopolitical developments with US military officials saying that the US is ready to attack Syria upon orders from President Trump which could come at any time. In metals markets, spot gold has benefitted from the modest risk aversion seen in markets thus far with the slightly softer USD also giving prices a helping hand. Elsewhere, copper was initially firmer overnight alongside early gains in Chinese metals amid restocking demand and expectations of increased construction activity in the upcoming month before staging a retreat. Finally, iron ore prices were seen lower overnight amid concerns over steel margins, whilst aluminium is once again seen higher in London trade as the fallout from Russian sanctions continues to guide price action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih says happy with oil market at present. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh says current oil prices are acceptable and that all are comfortable with the price. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (6 Apr) +1.758M vs. Exp. -0.200M (Prev. -3.280M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>API Cushing number (6 Apr) +1.452M vs. Exp. 1.50M (Prev. 4.058M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>API weekly Distillate stocks (6 Apr) -3.849M vs. Exp. 2.200M (Prev. 2.200M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>API weekly Gasoline stocks (6 Apr) +2.005M vs. Exp. -1.400M (Prev. 1.123M)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback remains narrowly mixed against G10 peers, but the Index looks prone to another downturn and test of near term chart support ahead of 89.000, with the late March low around 89.250 an obvious target. Optimism surrounding US-China trade negotiations have been somewhat neutralised or even negated by the Syrian situation and potential US-led response within the next 24 hours. However, the Dollar could receive a reprieve from upcoming headline inflation data and or FOMC minutes in the interim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several factors appear to have lifted Sterling ahead of a raft of UK data, with market observers still noting the bullish April seasonal element (even though the weather is still far from favourable), and of course Tuesday&rsquo;s promptings from BoE hawk McCafferty for no further delay on a 2<sup>nd</sup> hike. Reports suggesting an olive branch offered by chief EU Brexit negotiator Barnier may also be impacting as Cable climbed above 1.4200 and tested the next tech resistance zone 1.4215-25 (above the 10 DMA). Note, contacts reported selling in Eur/Gbp from 0.8710 down to 0.8703 in the run up to the 9.30BST releases and the inference might have been hedging/betting on something above consensus, but in the event buyers were thwarted by weak output numbers vs an encouraging smaller trade shortfall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The renowned safe-havens have diverged yet again, as Usd/Jpy continues to hug the 107.00 level amidst option expiry interest at the strike, but with a more offered tone on the aforementioned geopolitical jitters. Conversely, Usd/Chf is back up near 0.9600 vs circa 0.9550 at one stage, while Eur/Chf has rallied to fresh post-SNB floor removal highs around 1.1880, with M&amp;A related flows perhaps impacting alongside more official activity, according to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edging more gains towards 1.2400, but hampered by offers ahead of the next big figure and also wary of decent expiries between 1.2345-60 (1.8 bn). ECB minutes and speeches may provide more independent direction after hawkish comments from Nowotny on Tuesday were confirmed as personal rather than a collective policy view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A degree of consolidation after recent relative big moves and overall outperformance vs the US counterpart with Aud/Usd meeting resistance ahead of 0.7800 (at 0.7785) after sub-forecast Chinese inflation data, a moderation in consumer sentiment and another RBA signal that rates are not going up in the near term. The Kiwi has slipped back from near 0.7375 highs to test support around 0.7350 and Usd/Cad is pivoting around 1.2600. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n",

Some market participants may also be covering shorts made on the back of hawkish comments from ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny on Tuesday that were subsequently confirmed as his own view and not necessarily consistent with the GC consensus. On that note, March policy meeting minutes could offer more insight along with anything divulged on the economy and guidance from Hansson and Draghi. On the flip-side, German long end supply and the 10 year UST auction may require some concession, and more immediately debt will be eyeing EU stocks for additional direction.</p>\r\n",

However, while stocks were higher, futures were traversing sideways for much of the US session, with ES straddling 2650, only making moves above that area in late trade. In stock specifics, autos were bid after China&rsquo;s Business Journal stated the country is considering cutting import duties on cars by half, with all major names closing green, led by Tesla (TSLA).

In late trade, tech was in focus as Facebook&rsquo;s (FB) CEO Zuckerberg testified to lawmakers; there was little by way of new information, though tech and FB itself had an upside bias.&nbsp; Shares traded higher throughout most the testimony but came off highs as Zuckerberg stated there will always be a free version of Facebook.</p>\r\n",

(+0.9%) </strong>were initially choppy as participants digested the miss on Chinese CPI and PPI data, although stocks gradually found some comfort from efforts by PBoC Governor Yi Gang to build upon the momentum from President Xi at the Boao forum in which the PBoC Governor talked about opening up and announced to increase stock connect quotas. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat as prices lacked direction amid an indecisive risk tone in the region, while the BoJ also kept the amounts of its Rinban announcement unchanged at just over JPY 1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities.<br /><br /><strong>PBoC Governor Yi Gang </strong>said China will implement financial market opening up steps and that China will remove foreign ownership caps on banks, while he added that trade between US and China should balance out in the future. Governor Yi further commented that China will not allow CNY to depreciate and will permit domestic and foreign financial companies to compete on an equal playing field. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PBoC Governor Yi Gang</strong> also announced to increase daily quota limits for the stock connect with Hong Kong and that China targets launching the Shanghai-London stock connect within this year, while the CSRC later stated that daily quotas for stock connect scheme are to be expanded as of May 1st. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>China Vice Finance Minister</strong> said China will continue to announce more tax cuts and conduct personal income reforms, while the official added that China will implement tariff cuts ASAP and that the announcement to reduce tariffs was based on its own decision.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong><br /><br />FX markets were relatively flat overnight in which most majors remained at levels seen during late US trade. This kept the DXY near 2-week lows, while <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> held on to most the upside seen following previous hawkish comments from ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny on rate hikes, which a central bank spokesperson later clarified was Nowotny&rsquo;s own view and did not represent the ECB governing council. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> was off best levels amid the indecisive risk tone, while commodity-linked currencies remained firm after the prior day&rsquo;s advances which were aided by 3.7% gains in oil prices, although <strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> marginally pulled back following lacklustre data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Westpac Consumer Sentiment Index (Apr) 102.4 (Prev. 103.0). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed overnight with oil prices taking a breather following the prior day&rsquo;s rally which was fuelled by risk sentiment and OPEC rhetoric including reports that Saudi is said to seek prices near USD 80/bbl. This eventually resulted to 3.7% gains in <strong>WTI</strong> on Tuesday and supported <strong>Brent</strong> to its highest since December 2014, although prices have pulled back from best levels on mild profit taking and after a surprise build in API crude inventories. Elsewhere, <strong>copper</strong> was initially firmer alongside early gains in Chinese metals trade amid restocking demand amid expectations of increased construction activity in the upcoming months, before prices gradually retreated, and gold prices remained afloat as the DXY languished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (6 Apr) +1.758M vs. Exp. -0.200M (Prev. -3.280M). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EIA raised 2018 &amp; 2019 world oil demand growth forecasts, while it cut view on 2018 production but raised view on 2019 production. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Ministry said Saudi Arabia plans to keep crude oil exports below 7.0mln bpd for May and that it sees Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s March crude production at 9.91mln bpd. Furthermore, the ministry reiterated its commitment to restore inventories to their normal levels and there were also comments from Energy Minister Al-Falih that he is happy with the oil market at present. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UAE Energy Minister said long-term ties with Russia will allow OPEC to react more effectively in changing oil markets fundamentals, while reports added that it is too early for OPEC to discuss oil cut extension or replacing falling Venezuela output. (PlattsOil)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh said current oil prices are acceptable and that all are comfortable with the price. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada&rsquo;s Energy Minister said the government is fully supportive of the Kinder Morgan Pipeline and that it is not a matter of whether it will go ahead but rather how it will proceed. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US military officials said the US ready to attack Syria upon order from Trump which could come at any time, while there were also separate reports that the announcement on US action in Syria was said to be imminent. (i24 News/Fox)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US-led coalition reportedly asked all Middle East flight companies to change itineraries for the next 48 hours amid a possible strike. (Kurdistan24)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia vetoed US bid at UN Security Council to present a new inquiry to lay blame for chemical weapons over the attacks in Syria, while there were also reports that Russia is jamming US drones over Syria airspace impacting military ops. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bear-flattening was the theme, with short-end yields higher by around 3bps, while the longer-end of the curve was more or less unchanged at settlement. President Xi&rsquo;s speech overnight was the catalyst, helping to drive decent overnight volumes. However, as we entered the European day, the tplex was happy to range trade, with 10-year T-Notes patrolling the 120-24 to 120-29 bracket. There was some attention on the 5s30s part of the curve, which flattened to the narrowest since 2007. In the late part of the European afternoon, Treasuries were for a short while dictated by Bund action, which caught a bid after the ECB backtracked from Nowotny&rsquo;s hawkish comments, made earlier in the day. However, the effect was short lived. The US sold $30bln of 3yr notes, which tailed by 0.1bps, with the yield the highest at auction since May 2007. Cover was more-or-less in line with recent averages, though indirect participation dropped to the lowest since September; dealers took the most since September 2017. This week&rsquo;s $64bln of 3s/10s/30s will see a net paydown of around $12.5bln by the US Treasury, given the $74.5bln of maturities at the mid-month settlement. US 10y T-notes futs settled down 4+ ticks at 120-24+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House said it sees encouragement in Chinese President Xi&rsquo;s words but added it wants to see concrete actions.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed as sentiment settles down from the bullishness seen from President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s conciliatory tone on Tuesday which resulted to a solid performance on Wall St, while attention turns to the geopolitical climate with a possible announcement on Syria said to be imminent. ASX 200 (-0.3%) failed to sustain mild opening gains as softer Australian consumer sentiment data and weaker than expected Chinese inflation figures dampen the upside seen in commodity related sectors. Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) is also lacklustre with J Front the worst off amongst the retailers on expectations of weaker profits this year, while SoftBank outperforms on M&amp;A hopes after reports its unit Sprint and T-Mobile renewed merger talks. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) are choppy as participants digest the miss on Chinese CPI and PPI data, while the region is also seeing some fatigue with efforts by PBoC Governor Yi Gang to build upon the momentum from President Xi at the Boao forum, getting a milder reception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively flat overnight with most majors remaining at levels seen during late US trade. This has kept the DXY near 2-week lows, while EUR/USD holds on to most of the upside seen following previous hawkish comments from ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny on rate hikes, which a central bank spokesperson later clarified was Nowotny&rsquo;s own view and did not represent the ECB governing council. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is off best levels amid the indecisive risk tone, while commodity-linked currencies remain firm after the prior day&rsquo;s advance which was aided by 3.7% gains in oil prices, although AUD/USD has marginally pulled back following lacklustre data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with prices lacking direction amid an indecisive risk tone in the region, while the BoJ also maintained the amounts unchanged in its Rinban announcement for just over JPY 1tln of JGBs in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",
