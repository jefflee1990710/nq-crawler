Praxair (PX) and Linde AG received CFIUS clearance for their business combination, and the deal is seen completing in the second half of the year. ENERGY: Was the biggest laggard, with some of the big names reporting; Exxon (XOM) beat on revenues but miss on EPS, suggesting that higher crude prices aren&rsquo;t solving the issues, Chevron (CVX) beat on EPS though missed on revs. There wasn&rsquo;t much support from crude prices. TECH: FAANGs were mixed; Amazon (AMZN) was higher after a solid earnings report, though the rest of the group were struggling to carve out gains, and tech shares were generally soft, as was INTC despite solid earnings. Elsewhere in tech, ahead of its earnings, reports suggest that Apple (AAPL) will manufacture 8 million iPhone X units in Q2 as it looks to drive down its inventory. CONS DISC: Charter Communications (CHTR) was slammed after reporting the loss of more internet and TV subscribers than expected, with Comcast (CMCSA) and Altice (ATC) falling in sympathy. SPX +0.15% at 2670, NDX +0.10% at 6656, DJI -0.05 at 24310.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury curve bull-flattened on Friday, with short-dated yields narrowing by around 1bps, while the longer-end of the curve saw yields drop by around 5bps at settlement. The buying resulted in further narrowing of major curve spreads &ndash; on the week, 2s30s narrows by around 3bps, 5s30s narrowed by around 2bps, while 2s10s flattened by around 2bps in the week. There was some selling action after better than expected US GDP on Friday, though the selling was reversed shortly afterwards, as the sell-off in tech shares prompted buying in the long-end of the curve.</p>\r\n",
