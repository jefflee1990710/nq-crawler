        "content": "<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he has no time-frame for ending China trade dispute and does not anticipate much coming from the trade talks with China this week. US President Trump also accused China and Europe of currency manipulation and stated that when the US places tariffs on China, China artificially devalues its currency. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Vice Premier Liu He stated that China are to bolster IP protection and increase legal enforcement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU stated their efforts are undiminished in Brexit negotiations. (Newswires)<br /><br />EU Construction Output (Jun) Y/Y 2.60% vs. Exp. 1.60% (Prev. 1.80%, Rev. 2.00%). (Newswires)<br /><br /><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DoE offered 11mln barrels sour crude for sale from the US reserves. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi crude output rose by 459k BPD MM to 10.489mln BPD in June and Saudi crude exports rose by 260k BPD MM to 7.24mln BPD in June, according to JODI data. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World refined copper market deficit narrowed to 31,000 tons in May from 98,000 tons in April, according to ICSG. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he thought he had a deal with Turkey for Pastor Brunson&rsquo;s release and that he helped Israel to free a Turkish citizen for the pastor&#39;s release. US President Trump said he would consider lifting Russian sanctions if Moscow took steps to cooperate with US on issues such as Syria and Ukraine, while he also stated it is fine if Iranian President Rouhani wants to meet him but that he could not care less if not. US President Trump later added that it is likely will have a 2nd summit with North Korean leader Kim. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he disagrees with the Fed&rsquo;s decision to hike interest rates and that he is not thrilled with Fed Chair Powell for doing so, while he also said Fed should be more accommodating and should give him some more help. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bostic (voter, dovish) said the economy no longer needs the stimulus it required before and is doing pretty well with GDP strong and the unemployment rate historically very low. Bostic added the Fed is worried about flatness of yield curve, while he also stated the Fed is on a gradual path to get rates back to neutral and that he still favours 3 hikes for 2018. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Agricultural Secretary Perdue said a trade war is needed to get exports up and to get a level field. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stock specifics, Estee Lauder (EL) reported EPS and revenue above Wall St expectations, but guided beneath expectations, and also raised its FY19 restructuring charges estimates, weighing on the stock in pre-market trade, though did go positive after the open. Tesla (TSLA) declined by as much as 8% in pre-market trade, but only opened 5% lower and losses slowly abated as trade progressed. The fall in the name was due to a negative note from JP Morgan which stated, &lsquo;funding appears not to be secured&rsquo; and that the &lsquo;going private&rsquo; process appears much less developed than they had earlier presumed. Also, not helping the EV maker, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund, who recently took a USD 2bln stake in TSLA, are also in discussions with one of Tesla&rsquo;s rivals, Lucid Motors. Nike (NKE) outperformed, following an upgrade from Piper Jaffray &amp; Susquehanna; the latter stated NKE is gaining market share from its competitors such as Adidas (ADS GY) and Foot Locker (FL). In M&amp;A: PepsiCo (PEP) announced it is to acquire SodaStream (SODA) for USD 144/shr in a deal worth USD 3.2bln in cash, which represents a 10.9% premium to SODA&rsquo;s closing price on Friday. Reports suggested that Apple (AAPL) is planning an updated, cheaper Mac computer to revive desktop computer sales. SPX +0.24% at 2857, NDX -0.08% at 7371, DJI +0.35% at 25758.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As US traders were getting to their desks, a slight risk-off sentiment was prevailing, and yields were edging lower. The latest CFTC data released Friday showed specs hold a record net short position in Treasuries, which prompted Doubline&rsquo;s Gundlach to warn of the potential for a massive short squeeze; attention, therefore is on the general risk sentiment (Turkey is away this week following its Downgrade, for Eid; China related trade news flow seems positive, however) as well as the Fed minutes and Jackson Hole later in the week. Informa reported that buying action today was from real money accounts continuing to buy as tariffs and EM issues remain in the spotlight (though tensions have noticeably eased, broadly speaking). The front part of the curve (2s5s, 2s10s, 2s30s) narrowed, while 5s10s, 5s320s and 10s30s was more-or-less unchanged at settlement. US 10-year T-notes settled 12 ticks higher at 120-20.</p>\r\n",

Trump reportedly lamented that Powell was not a &ldquo;cheap money&rdquo; Fed chair, which he expected, according to three people familiar with the matter. Fed&#39;s Bostic (Voter, Dovish) said the economy does no longer need the stimulus it required before since it is doing pretty well; GDP is &#39;strong&#39; and unemployment rate is historically &#39;very, very low&#39;. Bostic warned that the Fed is concerned about the flatness of the yield curve, stating that he will not knowingly vote for any policy which he believes will lead to yield curve inversion. He went on to say that it is not clear if an inverted yield curve is a signal of recession. He added the Fed is doing pretty well on its inflation objective and that it is on a gradual path to get rates back to neutral with the central aim to keep the balance sheet unwind running in the background. In terms of downside risks, he sees trade policy as the &#39;chief&#39; source of uncertainty and also emphasized the Fed is watching EM such as Turley and Venezuela, following the recent turmoil. He, however, cited tax reform as an upside risk and reiterated his case for three hikes in 2018. Bostic also He also said to favour central bank independence as he believes it would allow better policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>TRADE:</strong> &nbsp;The run of recent trade news has been constructive, with the latest NAFTA news reports Mexico&rsquo;s top farm lobby said on Sunday that the US has dropped demands to impose restrictions on Mexican agricultural exports; this should enable US and Mexico to focus on the remaining outstanding issues including the auto sector rules, as the two sides come closer to a deal. It is worth noting that US President Trump does not have a mandate from Congress to negotiate a new bi-lateral trade deal with Mexico; some argue that Trump will therefore need to bring the updated deal into the NAFTA framework. &nbsp;On the Canadian side, PM Trudeau said he is looking forward to more engagement shortly. The WTO confirmed on Monday that Turkey has lodged a complaint against the additional doubling up of US tariffs announced earlier in the month by the Trump administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Turkey President Erdogan reiterated on Monday they will not ask for IMF assistance. Elsewhere, Iran again urged the EU to speed up efforts to keep Tehran in the 2015 multinational nuclear deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>SPX +0.24% at 2857, NDX -0.08% at 7371, DJI +0.35% at 25758. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.66%, Materials +0.71%, Industrials +0.64% Cons Discretionary +0.62%, Cons&nbsp; Staples -0.03%, Healthcare +0.31%, Financials +0.35%, Tech -0.15%, Telecoms +0.08%, Utilities -0.35%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Estee Lauder (EL) reported EPS and revenue above Wall St expectations, but guided beneath expectations, and also raised its FY19 restructuring charges estimates, weighing on the stock in pre-market trade, though did go positive after the open. Tesla (TSLA) declined by as much as 8% in pre-market trade, but only opened 5% lower and losses slowly abated as trade progressed. The fall in the name was due to a negative note from JP Morgan which stated, &lsquo;funding appears not to be secured&rsquo; and that the &lsquo;going private&rsquo; process appears much less developed than they had earlier presumed. Also, not helping the EV maker, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund, who recently took a USD 2bln stake in TSLA, are also in discussions with one of Tesla&rsquo;s rivals, Lucid Motors. Nike (NKE) outperformed, following an upgrade from Piper Jaffray &amp; Susquehanna; the latter stated NKE is gaining market share from its competitors such as Adidas (ADS GY) and Foot Locker (FL). In M&amp;A: PepsiCo (PEP) announced it is to acquire SodaStream (SODA) for USD 144/shr in a deal worth USD 3.2bln in cash, which represents a 10.9% premium to SODA&rsquo;s closing price on Friday. Reports suggested that Apple (AAPL) is planning an updated, cheaper Mac computer to revive desktop computer sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>WTI (U8) FUTURES SETTLE&nbsp; 52C HIGHER AT USD 66.43/BBL, BRENT (V8) FUTURES SETTLE 38C HIGHER AT USD 72.21/BBL.</strong> Oil traded higher on Monday though the complex gave up some of the gains following a notice released by the DoE offering 11mln barrels sour crude for sale from the US reserves; it appears as though this is an inventory management measure, and was already planned. With the exception of this news, there was no real catalyst driving prices action. News flow remained relatively light after Saudi Arabia expressed willingness over the weekend to make up for any shortfall that could arise from US sanctions. On Monday the possibility of further US sanctions forced Total to exit Iran, abandoning the South Pars project which will necessitate of a replacement. Iran over the weekend warned that no OPEC member should be able to take over its share of oil exports; on Monday, it was reported that China shifted to Iranian tankers to keep oil flowing amid US sanctions. Moreover, there was confirmation that the planned strike action at three Total&rsquo;s North Sea oil and gas platforms began today whilst the latest targeted missile attack by Yemeni Houthi Rebels on Saudi assets seemed to have muted impact on sentiment. Saudi reported crude output rising by 459k BPD MM to 10.489mln BPD in June and crude exports up by 260k BPD MM to 7.24mln BPD, according to JODI data. As a reminder, WTI September (U8) contract is due to expire tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>US 10-YEAR T-NOTES SETTLED 12 TICKS HIGHER AT 120-20.</strong> As US traders were getting to their desks, a slight risk-off sentiment was prevailing, and yields were edging lower. The latest CFTC data released Friday showed specs hold a record net short position in Treasuries, which prompted Doubline&rsquo;s Gundlach to warn of the potential for a massive short squeeze; attention, therefore is on the general risk sentiment (Turkey is away this week following its Downgrade, for Eid; China related trade news flow seems positive, however) as well as the Fed minutes and Jackson Hole later in the week. Informa reported that buying action today was from real money accounts continuing to buy as tariffs and EM issues remain in the spotlight (though tensions have noticeably eased, broadly speaking). The front part of the curve (2s5s, 2s10s, 2s30s) narrowed, while 5s10s, 5s320s and 10s30s was more-or-less unchanged at settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>DXY:</strong> Back down towards the 96.000 handle and closer to the bottom-end of session ranges that only marginally extended to the upside from circa 96.300 to 96.400 at one stage. The general bias has been towards USD weakness as we approach APAC trade, with traders citing US/China trade talk hopes (helping CNH to gain, lifting some of its Asian counterparts) as well as reduced EM angst in Turkey (which is on holiday for Eid this week).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> GBP:</strong> The outlier and perhaps unexpected outperformer amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and more EU warnings that the UK could conceivably leave without any deal. However, Cable made a more concerted run at 1.2750 and took out stops through to a circa 1.2775 high, while EURGBP slipped back towards 0.8950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CHF, JPY:</strong> Also firmer vs the Dollar amidst another bout of weakness in EMs (SA Rand aside due to short covering/consolidation after recent steep ZAR depreciation), as the Franc retreated from 0.9970 to 0.9935 and 1.1350 vs almost 1.1400 vs the Eur, while USDJPY took another look at bids/support at 110.50, but not quite stops said to be placed on a break of 110.30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CAD, EUR, AUD, NZD:</strong> The Loonie weakened alongside crude prices from best levels around 1.3055 vs its US counterpart to 1.3090 or thereabout, but recovered some poise as BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins stated that mortgage borrowers will see a rise in financing costs at some stage. So, no explicit mention about higher policy rates, but market expectations for tightening as early as September have climbed over 40% after last Friday&rsquo;s much stronger than forecast headline Canadian inflation data. The single currency survived a brief dip below 1.1400 vs the USD that appeared to coincide with a chase down to 126.00 in EURJPY, but is back near its 200 HMA at 1.1438, while the AUD remains above 0.7300 vs the Greenback, albeit tentatively and facing the prospect of more dovish policy guidance from RBA Governor Lowe tonight. Nevertheless, the NZD has been the laggard all day with the Kiwi hovering between 0.6640-10 and mostly nearer the bottom end, as the AUDNZD cross firmed back up above 1.1000 within a 1.1020-50 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>TRY:</strong> The Lira succumbed to more investor angst after S&amp;P&rsquo;s ratings cut and with no support from FX depo or repo auctions, while the latest tirade against speculators and the US attacking the country from Turkish President Erdogan largely fell on deaf ears. Indeed, USDTRY rebounded even more firmly from sub-6.0000 lows to just shy of 6.2000 as the stalemate over US Pastor Brunson and sanctions rumbled on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>AHEAD:</strong> All in all, an inauspicious start to a week that really kicks off in earnest later via ECB and Fed minutes, Jackson Hole and the US-China trade talks that may be labelled as &lsquo;low&rsquo; level, but apparently have been prefaced by a roadmap to resolve the reciprocal import tariff tiff by November. USDCNH currently around 6.8580 after a lower USDCNY fix by the PBoC overnight (at 6.8718 from 6.8894 last Friday).</p>\r\n",

With the exception of this news, there was no real catalyst driving prices action. News flow remained relatively light after Saudi Arabia expressed willingness over the weekend to make up for any shortfall that could arise from US sanctions. On Monday the possibility of further US sanctions forced Total to exit Iran, abandoning the South Pars project which will necessitate of a replacement. Iran over the weekend warned that no OPEC member should be able to take over its share of oil exports; on Monday, it was reported that China shifted to Iranian tankers to keep oil flowing amid US sanctions. Moreover, there was confirmation that the planned strike action at three Total&rsquo;s North Sea oil and gas platforms began today whilst the latest targeted missile attack by Yemeni Houthi Rebels on Saudi assets seemed to have muted impact on sentiment. Saudi reported crude output rising by 459k BPD MM to 10.489mln BPD in June and crude exports up by 260k BPD MM to 7.24mln BPD, according to JODI data. As a reminder, WTI September (U8) contract is due to expire tomorrow.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back down towards the 96.000 handle and closer to the bottom end of session ranges that only marginally extended to the upside from circa 96.300 to 96.400 at one stage. Usd/G10 pairings are ending the first EU trading session of the week pretty much where they started, on a mixed footing, but at least a bit more consistent with risk or safe-haven characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outlier and perhaps unexpected outperformer amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and more EU warnings that the UK could conceivably leave without any deal. However, Cable made a more concerted run at 1.2750 and took out stops through to a circa 1.2775 high, while Eur/Gbp slipped back towards 0.8950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also firmer vs the Dollar amidst another bout of weakness in EMs (SA Rand aside due to short covering/consolidation after recent steep Zar depreciation), as the Franc retreated from 0.9970 to 0.9935 and 1.1350 vs almost 1.1400 vs the Eur, while Usd/Jpy took another look at bids/support at 110.50, but not quite stops said to be placed on a break of 110.30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/EUR/AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie weakened alongside crude prices from best levels around 1.3055 vs its US counterpart to 1.3090 or thereabout, but recovered some poise as BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins stated that mortgage borrowers will see a rise in financing costs at some stage. So, no explicit mention about higher policy rates, but market expectations for tightening as early as September have climbed over 40% after last Friday&rsquo;s much stronger than forecast headline Canadian inflation data. The single currency survived a brief dip below 1.1400 vs the Usd that appeared to coincide with a chase down to 126.00 in Eur/Jpy, but is back near its 200 HMA at 1.1438, while the Aud remains above 0.7300 vs the Greenback, albeit tentatively and facing the prospect of more dovish policy guidance from RBA Governor Lowe tonight. Nevertheless, the Nzd has been the laggard all day with the Kiwi hovering between 0.6640-10 and mostly nearer the bottom end, as the Aud/Nzd cross firmed back up above 1.1000 within a 1.1020-50 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira succumbed to more investor angst after S&amp;P&rsquo;s ratings cut and with no support from FX depo or repo auctions, while the latest tirade against speculators and the US attacking the country from Turkish President Erdogan largely fell on deaf ears. Indeed, Usd/Try rebounded even more firmly from sub-6.0000 lows to just shy of 6.2000 as the stalemate over US Pastor Brunson and sanctions rumbled on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AHEAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, an inauspicious start to a week that really kicks off in earnest later via ECB and Fed minutes, Jackson Hole and the US-China trade talks that may be labelled as &lsquo;low&rsquo; level, but apparently have been prefaced by a roadmap to resolve the reciprocal import tariff tiff by November. Usd/Cnh currently around 6.8580 after a lower Usd/Cny fix by the PBoC overnight (at 6.8718 from 6.8894 last Friday).</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.1%) traded higher but with sentiment in the mainland bourse flimsy as it swung from gains and losses, however the bulls eventually took the upper hand following another firm liquidity effort by the PBoC and continued hopes regarding trade talks. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially uneventful amid a similar tone across asset classes and a lack of BoJ presence in the bond market, although prices gradually edged higher throughout the session amid the underperformance of stocks in Tokyo which helped 10yr JGBs break above resistance around the 150.50 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 120bln via 7-day reverse repos.

Elsewhere, Atlantia (-9.0%) shares continue take a beating, the latest reports suggesting the Italian government has begun revoking Autostrade&rsquo;s licence, also casting doubt over an initial offer of EUR 500mln for compensation and building work from Atlantia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The broad Dollar and DXY is mildly firmer, but well within established ranges and G10 pairs are narrowly mixed even though risk appetite suggests that a degree of divergence between traditional safe-havens and high beta currencies would better reflect the overall tone.&nbsp; Hence, the index is relatively lacklustre within 96.300-010 bounds awaiting firmer direction and impulses that could arrive later this week via US-China trade talks, FOMC minutes and/or Jackson Hole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/EUR/JPY - Highlighting the rather indifferent and conflicting start to the week, the Kiwi, single currency and Jpy are all underperforming at the base of the major pecking order, with the former just about retaining 0.6600+ status, Eur/Usd still struggling to extend rebounds above 1.1400 (topping out ahead of the 200 HMA at 1.1458) and Usd/Jpy continuing to pivot around 110.50 (albeit Eur/Jpy also capped circa 126.50 and under its 200 HMA of 126.82).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/GBP/CHF - Essentially flat-lining vs the Greenback, but with the Loonie holding near recent highs circa 1.3055 after last Friday&rsquo;s BoC rate hike boosting Canadian CPI data and eyeing a speech from Governor Wilkins this afternoon, while the Aud straddles 0.7300 again wary of more unsupportive RBA rhetoric in the form of dovish guidance from Governor Lowe who is due to speak later tonight. Elsewhere, Cable is also aimless around a 1.2750 axis awaiting further Brexit developments and the Franc is even more restrained either side of 0.9950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Try is back under pressure after S&amp;P&rsquo;s downgrade and no FX Depo auction today, with comments from President Erdogan largely shrugged off or arguably undermining the Lira if anything, although the US rejecting Turkey&rsquo;s offer to release Pastor Brunson in exchange for bank aid is probably more of a negative factor. Usd/Try back near 6.1000, in contrast to Usd/Rub around 67.0000 in wke of Fitch affirming Russia and Usd/Zar sub-14.5000 in consolidation after last week&rsquo;s Rand slump and ahead of SA inflation data and the beginning of testimonies for the capture inquest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED</strong> <strong>INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have pared some losses after extending intraday lows to 163.42 and 123.54 on Eurex and Liffe respectively (-1/4 point and -21 ticks on the day), as EU stocks climb higher, Italian BTPs get a boost from comments by Salvini claiming that infrastructure funding is in place, and perhaps less intuitively a relatively firm rebound in US Treasuries. Nothing concrete to support the suggestion, but it would certainly be reasonable and feasible to deduce that the 10 year EU benchmarks have conceded ground to any or all of the above, ie via asset reallocation and/or spread positioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (Unch) and Brent (+0.4%) trade mixed, with the former eyeing USD 66/bbl to the upside while the latter straddling above USD 72.00/bbl. News flow for crude was light over the weekend, although Iran expressed opposition to Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s willingness to make up for any shortfall that could arise from US sanctions, in which it told OPEC that no country is allowed to take over the share of other members for production and exports of oil under any circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (+0.3%) is in the green as it crawls closer to the USD 1190/oz level. London copper rose 1% this morning as hopes for US-Sino trade talks buoyed risk appetite after reports suggested China and Washington are to hold low-level trade talks on August 21st and 22nd, ahead of the new US tariffs on USD 16bln of Chinese goods take effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK union confirmed the offshore oil &amp; gas platform strike has begun at the three platforms Alwyn, Elgin and Dunbar. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China are said to have shifted to Iranian tankers to keep oil flowing amid US sanctions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Cable is also aimless around a 1.2750 axis awaiting further Brexit developments and the Franc is even more restrained either side of 0.9950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Try is back under pressure after S&amp;P&rsquo;s downgrade and no FX Depo auction today, with comments from President Erdogan largely shrugged off or arguably undermining the Lira if anything, although the US rejecting Turkey&rsquo;s offer to release Pastor Brunson in exchange for bank aid is probably more of a negative factor. Usd/Try back near 6.1000, in contrast to Usd/Rub around 67.0000 in wke of Fitch affirming Russia and Usd/Zar sub-14.5000 in consolidation after last week&rsquo;s Rand slump and ahead of SA inflation data and the beginning of testimonies for the capture inquest.</p>\r\n",

Similarly, the Short Sterling strip has been mostly flat to 1 ticks adrift in contrast to a mild bid in Eurodollar contracts beyond front month Sep18, and for no real obvious reason. Perhaps the FTSE uptick is weighing on sentiment, but if anything domestic factors should be supportive for UK rates given weak Rightmove house prices overnight and more Brexit-related issues undermining business confidence (latest IoD survey showing the lowest level so far this year).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were mostly higher but with gains contained as the region struggled for direction due to a lack of fresh catalysts and as earnings dominated news flow. ASX 200 (+0.1%) traded positive but with price action kept in a tight range as strength in miners was counterbalanced by weakness in the largest weighted financials sector and consumer staples following disappointing results from Woolworths, while Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) underperformed amid a firmer currency and as some analysts even suggested stealth tapering after the BoJ refrained from buying stocks for 2 days last week. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) traded higher but with sentiment in the mainland bourse flimsy as it swung from gains and losses, however the bulls eventually took the upper hand following another firm liquidity effort by the PBoC and continued hopes regarding trade talks. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded marginally higher amid the underperformance of stocks in Tokyo although the gains were minimal in reflection of the uneventful trade across asset classes and lack of BoJ presence in the bond market.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher but with gains contained as the region struggles for direction due to a lack of fresh catalysts and with earnings dominating news flow. ASX 200 (+0.2%) is positive but with price action in a tight range as strength in miners is counterbalanced by weakness in the largest weighted financials sector and consumer staples following disappointing results from Woolworths, while Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) underperforms amid a firmer currency and with some analysts even suggesting stealth tapering after the BoJ refrained from buying stocks for 2 days last week. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) began choppy as the mainland initially swung from gains and losses, although the bulls eventually took the upper hand following another firm liquidity effort by the PBoC and continued hopes regarding trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively uneventful amid a lack of data releases or macro drivers. Nonetheless, the greenback attempts to recover some of Friday&rsquo;s losses against its major counterparts which saw EUR/USD and GBP/USD stall around the 1.1450 and 1.2750 levels respectively, while a mild pullback is also seen in AUD/USD and NZD/USD with the former just about holding onto the 0.7300 handle. Elsewhere, JPY marginally benefits from cross-related flows and CNY gained against USD after a firmer fix but with advances in the Chinese currency capped around 6.8500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid the underperformance of stocks in Tokyo although the gains are minimal in reflection of the uneventful trade across asset classes and lack of BoJ presence in the bond market.</p>\r\n",
