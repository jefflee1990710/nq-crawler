Bostic suggested that there was no need to hike rates three times in 2018 (the Fed&rsquo;s &lsquo;dots&rsquo; have pencilled in three hikes in 2018). The Atlanta Fed president also warned on yield curve inversion, saying he did not want Fed policy to drive a yield curve inversion, and will be closely watching long-term yields when voting on rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Williams (voter) avoided monetary policy in his comments at the Brookings Institute today, instead focussing on the debate around price-level targeting. The San Francisco Fed president has, in recent speeches, suggested that three hikes in 2018 would be appropriate, and the Fed is well positioned to adjust that based on incoming data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House is close to a decision in nominating next Fed Vice-Chair according to administration official.

In an immediate reaction, the CAD weakened on the headline, but the details of the survey provided encouragement, contributing some Canadian dollar strength to pare back the knee-jerk losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiring intentions were higher, investment intentions were up, and the intensity of labour shortage was noted reflecting strong demand and tight labour markets and slack is now seen as limited towards the energy sector, while output costs are expected to grow. The outlook component also rose towards the peak seen in the summer of 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SPX +0.15% at 2747; DJI -0.07% at 25278; NDX +0.35% at 6677<br />Top sectors: Utilities +0.6%, Energy +0.5%, Tech +0.4%<br />Bottom sectors: Healthcare -0.5%, Financials -0.1%, Basic Materials 0.0%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of earnings season moving into full swing, equities rose in quiet trade on Monday, with the defensive utilities sector &ndash; which was among the worst performers last week &ndash; leading gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healthcare names were weaker amid the healthcare conference hosted by JPMorgan. Banks also couldn&rsquo;t join in the equity market gains, despite yields rising slightly. On Thursday, the bank names will begin reporting numbers for the quarter.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREASURIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields were little change on the day, with a small bias towards a steeper curve. Volumes were thin, however, with the Japanese away on another market holiday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attention now moves towards this week&rsquo;s supply out of the US Treasury. Excluding bills, the US will this week sell a total of USD 56bln in 3s, 10s and 30s this week ($24bln of 3s on Tuesday, $20bln in a 10s reopening on Wednesday, $12bln in a 30s reopening on Thursday).

The EUR pressure came despite firmer retail sales and consumer confidence data. However, the consumer inflation expectations sub-index declined, and after last week&rsquo;s prices data showing core inflation stuck below 1%, highlighting the challenges facing the ECB in its policy objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR weakness gave support to GBP, which was up by around half-a-percent against the single currency amid a reshuffle in governmental cabinet positions; all the major positions (Chancellor, Foreign Secretary, and Brexit Secretary) were unchanged, however, and thus did little to shake sterling. Against the USD, GBP continues to linger around the 1.3550 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Havens saw subdued action, with the JPY remaining above 113.0 and gold around $1320. The WSJ reported that US officials are in debate regarding the possibility of mounting a limited military strike on North Korea, which lent some upticks to both gold and yen, though the moves were small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite expectations of a January rate hike by the BOC rising after the Business Outlook Survey, CAD trades slightly negative against the buck. In a knee-jerk reaction, the Loonie weakened towards 1.2450, though as the details of the survey were digested, the losses were pared back.

Analysts expect crude stocks to draw by 4.1mln barrels in the week, according to a Reuters poll, which would be the 8th straight week of draws.

In fact, the single currency is weaker overall, and aside from anything else it appears that more position paring is at play given record IMM longs built up in the latest week. Indeed, Eur/Jpy is retreating towards 135.00 from around 136.30, and this has pulled Usd/Jpy back under 113.00.

        "content": "<p><strong>BMO:</strong> The Business Outlook Survey marks the last critical piece of information before the Bank of Canada&rsquo;s January 17th policy decision. This Q4 version covers the mid-November to early-December period, and follows a more moderate overall picture in the prior reading -recall that future employment, sales growth and M&amp;E investment all pulled back in Q3 after rising strongly through 2016 and early2017. While consumer confidence was surging late in 2017, business confidence was potentially held back by derailing NAFTA talks and looming minimum wage increases in a few provinces. Two key issues on the Bank&rsquo;s mind are the dynamics of wage growth and inflation, and the evolution of economic capacity - the BOS provides insight into both. On the former, the incidence of labour shortages was steady in Q3 at historically-normal levels, but the intensity of those shortages, where they do exist, rose to the highest since 2006. If that pressure becomes more widespread, the Bank will read it as a hawkish cue on top of two blowout job reports to end the year. On the latter, stronger M&amp;E investment is potentially adding to economic capacity, and therefore holding off capacity pressures. That said, the increase in reported capacity pressure edged up again in Q3, and if it continues to rise, flagging inflation-inducing capacity utilization rates (Q3 was the highest since 2007), that would provide another hawkish reading. Strength in these two indicators could push the Bank to raise rates in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CIBC:</strong> If the November-December employment surge was real, it should mean that businesses were confident about what lies ahead. That should make for a generally positive Business Outlook Survey on Monday. But watch for colour commentary on what companies are assuming on NAFTA and its risks to capital spending plans, an issue that could see the Bank of Canada pause for longer than the market expects after a January hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBC: </strong>The BOS is the last key indicator ahead of the BoC&rsquo;s January 17th rate meeting and MPR release and should be closely followed, with current pricing ~40% for a hike at the meeting. Although it was a partial retracement from the historically strong Q2 report, the last BOS saw solid readings for the balance of opinion on future sales (+19), M&amp;E Investment (+17), and employment intentions (+34). Moreover, more intense labour shortages and an elevated proportion of firms having difficulty meeting demand, as well as higher inflation expectations, suggested that capacity pressures may be biting. As always, commentary from firm interviews and the overall tone from the BoC should be at least as important as the statistical results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scotiabank: </strong>The main thing to watch will be what the Business Outlook Survey says regarding the level of confidence or concern in the nation&rsquo;s c-suites. After the outlook for future sales growth over the coming year slipped somewhat in the October edition of the survey, the main sensitivity will be toward whether respondents are more or less concerned about developments such as NAFTA talks that skidded into the ditch from October onward. Alternatively, are they more focused upon domestic capacity pressures and labour shortages? Recognition of the NAFTA risks was not captured in the October survey since it sampled opinions between August 24th and September 19th. October is when the US negotiating team aggressively laid down hard lines in the sand that have been objectionable to Canada basically since the years leading up to the original Canada-US Free Trade Agreement that was signed into existence twenty-nine years ago almost to the day. Even before NAFTA negotiations stumbled, survey responses regarding hiring and investment plans were coming off the boil albeit from elevated levels. The BoC is aware of the limits to this survey, but may be sensitive to information contained within by way of business expectations as well as plans to invest and hire plus how they view the outlook for price pressures. I would think it would have to be a fairly disastrous overall report to overwhelm the broad tone of other evidence.</p>\r\n",

Aside from no change in the likely 2018 Fed rate hike trajectory despite the headline NFP miss, the Greenback got a boost overnight amidst reported BoK intervention to curb KRW strength, and subsequently from some weakness in rival G10/major currencies. To recap, a sustained move back above 92.200 would bring technical resistance around 93.720 back into play, but a close below the 92.000-91.988 area could see the DXY resume its bear trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aud/Usd back down below 0.7850, with the Aud undermined by a marked slowdown in Australia&rsquo;s construction index and Government forecasts for a sharp 20% decline in iron ore prices this year. Latest IMM spec positioning also shows a near 2 year peak in Aud shorts as Aud/Usd tops out ahead of 0.7900 again, and the Aud/Nzd cross remains well below 1.1000 &ndash; hence, Kiwi holding up better vs the Usd within a 0.7150-0.7200 broad range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing support/bids below the 1.2000 level vs the Usd and eyeing a mega option expiry/digital/vanilla strike at 1.1985 for Tuesday (2.3 bn) as IMM data reveals record long Eur positions and perhaps overbought conditions. 1.1970-60 buy orders and chart support not yet being threatened, while last year&rsquo;s 1.2092 peak continues to cap the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding up better vs its US counterpart (like the Nzd), but Usd/Cad back above the 1.2400 level having tested the 1.2350 area after Friday&rsquo;s much stronger than expected Canadian jobs report. Downside still favoured amidst firm crude prices and heightened January BoC rate hike probability. Bids seen at 1.2350, then 1.2300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All lower vs the Usd, but within established recent ranges, with Cable between 1.3500-1.3600 awaiting news of PM May&rsquo;s UK cabinet reshuffle, Usd/Jpy nearer the top end of 113.00-113.50 and Usd/Chf also edging up towards 0.9800 from 0.9750 at the low &ndash; latter 2 safe-havens losing out on broadly risk-on sentiment elsewhere.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (+0.1%) and KOSPI (+0.4%) were positive in which with the latter outperformed ahead of inter-Korean talks which begin tomorrow. The tone for the rest of the Asia-Pac region was mostly reserved throughout the day amid the absence of Japanese participants due to public holiday, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) were choppy after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations and amid reports of tighter shadow banking regulations, as well as PBoC researcher comments regarding scope for higher rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC Deputy Head of Research Ji Min stated that there is room for a rate increase in the short-term. (China Daily)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations again today citing relatively high bank liquidity.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is expected to conduct a cabinet reshuffle today which would affect a quarter of her cabinet, according to UK press. Furthermore, it was also reported that PM May is to appoint a cabinet minister for a no deal Brexit in the reshuffle. (Guardian/Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Chancellor Merkel stated that she thinks they can manage to form a coalition. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann said that the ECB should set a date to end its asset purchase program. (El Mundo)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were choppy with the greenback initially pressured as the Asia-Pac region reacted to the weaker than expected US NFP jobs data and as EUR/USD rebounded in early trade amid optimism from German Chancellor Merkel on forming a coalition. However, the moves were later pared amid a lack of further drivers and sparse overnight calendar, which helped the USD-index reclaim the 92.00 level. Elsewhere, CAD remained firm in which USD/CAD continued to test a break below the 1.2400 handle after Friday&rsquo;s stellar Canadian jobs data and GBP/USD traded indecisive but nonetheless shrugged off reports of an impending cabinet reshuffle and appointment of a &lsquo;no-deal Brexit&rsquo; minister. Finally, AUD softened on cross-related underperformance in AUD/NZD and bearish Australian government iron ore prices forecasts, while KRW also suffered amid touted intervention after officials reiterated to take measures on one-sided price action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"_Hlk503148913\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148890\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148850\">COMMODITIES </a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodity prices were largely unchanged with WTI crude futures taking a breather from the New Year rally which had underpinned prices to their highest close in over 3 years. Elsewhere, gold prices consolidated alongside a range-bound greenback, while copper was also relatively flat and held near last week&rsquo;s lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia&#39;s government sees iron ore prices dropping 20% this year to an average USD 51.50/ton, due to increasing global supply and moderating Chinese demand. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump on Saturday said he would be open to talks with North Korea&rsquo;s leader and also claimed credit for inter-Korean talks which will begin on Tuesday. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China MOFCOM is to restrict crude exports to North Korea following UN rules. (Newswires)<br /><br />North Korean Leader Kim is said to have a kidney problem, according to South Korean press. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury yields were higher on Friday, with the curve mildly bear-steepening. Despite headline payrolls disappointing, the wages data continue to point to growth, albeit at a subdued rate when compared to previous recoveries. The data did little to suggest the Fed will alter course, and in combination with optimism about the impact of tax reform, traders were content to end the week selling Treasuries. US 10-Year T-Note Futures settled 5 ticks lower at 123-16+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Mester (Voter, Hawk) said she would be happy with three/four hikes in 2018 and that she was encouraged by the &ldquo;strong&rdquo; US Employment Situation Report for December. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Williams (Voter, Neutral) said Fed should raise interest rates three times this year as the already strong economy will be further boosted from tax cuts. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Harker (Non-Voter, Soft Hawk) said it could take some time for the next Fed rate hike and that a lack of wage pressure is the reason behind his caution. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Bullard (Non-Voter, Dove) repeated his recent view that the Fed should &#39;wait and see&#39; regarding further rate hikes and argued that the central bank has made no progress towards inflation since 2015. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Chief Economist Hassett stated that the Fed would not need to tighten policy at a quicker pace in response to the recent tax reductions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as momentum somewhat seeps through from last Friday&rsquo;s performance on Wall St. where all majors printed fresh record levels despite the NFP miss, while the DJIA extended above the 25,000 level and posted its best start to the year in over a decade. As such, ASX 200 (+0.1%) and KOSPI (+0.3%) are positive with the latter slightly outperforming ahead of inter-Korean talks which begin tomorrow. Conversely, the picture for the rest of the Asia-Pac region has left much to be desired with the tone reserved amid the absence of Japanese participants due to public holiday, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) are choppy after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations and amid reports of tighter regulations, as well as PBoC researcher comments regarding scope for higher rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD-index languishes below the 92.00 level as the region digests the weaker than expected US NFP jobs data. This has benefited the greenback&#39;s major counterparts with EUR/USD also rebounding amid optimism from German Chancellor Merkel on forming a coalition, while GBP/USD shrugged off reports of an impending cabinet reshuffle and appointment of a &lsquo;no-deal Brexit&rsquo; minister, to move closer towards a retest of the 1.3600 handle to the upside. Elsewhere, the remainder of major currencies are quiet amid a light calendar although CAD remains firm with USD/CAD back below 1.2400 after Friday&rsquo;s stellar Canadian jobs data.</p>\r\n",
