In early European trade, Il Sole reported the Italian fiscal plan is likely to be rejected by Italy&rsquo;s budget watchdog. Following the news Economy Minister Tria, to calm markets, noted the government&rsquo;s economic forecasts are cautious and urged constructive talks with the EU over the budget. He added that the strategy of debt containment was not being efficient, and he sees need for a boost to economic growth. He said to have held a constructive dialogue with the European Commission and expressed concern over the current yields and the spread; he highlighted they will do what they must do if the spread hits 400-500 bps. In later comments, Italy&#39;s EU Affairs Minister Savona said the budget outline should change if the spread is too high, stressing Italy would need much more than 2.4% deficit though noting government will have to change budget if market pressure on Italy gets out of hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> US President Trump stated that China is not prepared for a trade deal; there have been a couple of meetings arranged but they were cancelled, Trump said. Trump also reiterated his threat to apply another $267bln of sanctions on Chinese imports if China retalliates to its tariff measures. Separately, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, China will not use the Yuan in their trade dispute, and labelled remarks on FX from the US Treasury as groundless speculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The UK and the EU are making progress in Brexit talks, and the terms of the divorce could be settled by Monday, according to newswire sources. Gaps on the Irish border issue has narrowed the report said, adding that details on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the bloc could be settled by early November. Meanwhile, Irish foreign minister Coveney said he was hopeful that enough progress will be seen in negotiations next week for EU Negotiator Barnier to recommend a meeting in November. Speaking later in the session, UK Brexit Secretary Raab stated that negotiations with the EU had intensified and there were some differences on the withdrawal agreement. Raab did say that the UK was in discussions on a proposal to link the withdrawal agreement and future ties &ndash; something the EU has previously said must be done separately (WA first, FR second). &nbsp;The German government is aiming to pass legislation on tax consequences of Brexit and is looking to give affected parties a transition period if faced negative consequences from Brexit, according to Reuters citing sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (Neutral, Non-Voter) is comfortable with &quot;gradually and patiently&quot; raising rates at least until June 2019. Kaplan said US cyclical inflation pressures are building on the back of tariffs, oil prices and a hot labour market, but he does not see inflation running away. He added the Fed has latitude on the speed of rate hikes, but higher inflation may challenge that next year; he noted hyper productivity might lift neutral interest rate. Fed&#39;s Evans (Non-Voter, Dove) said the economy has been solid in 2017 and 2018, and he believes the US will continue to see growth in the near-term. Fed&rsquo;s Harker (non-voter) said there was very little slack remaining in the labour market. Fed&#39;s Harker (Non-Voter, Dovish) said &#39;very little slack left&#39; in the US labour market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.14% at 2880, NDX +0.26% at 7372, DJI -0.21% at 26430. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +0.99%, Materials -3.40%, Industrials -1.51%, Cons Discretionary -0.23%, Cons Staples -0.19%, Healthcare +0.24%, Financials -0.34%, Tech +0.35%, Telecoms -0.18%, Utilities +0.42%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>eBay (EBAY) was up after sources reported that activist investor Carl Icahn is said to be targeting the co. Tesla (TSLA) pared some recent losses after Macquarie initiated the stock with an Outperform. Walmart (WMT) was firmer after an upgrade at Deutsche Bank. MGM Resorts (MGM) and AMD (AMD) were other top movers on the day. PPG Industries (PPG) was among the worst performing stocks on the SPX after lowering Q3 &amp; Q4 view. American Airlines (AAL) tumbled after lowering its Q3 TRASM by 50 bps due to hurricane Florence cancellations. Mylan (MYL) and Kroger (KR) were hit after downgrades at Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank respectively. Perrigo (PRGO) also weighed on the healthcare sector&rsquo;s gains following the replacement of its CEO. Zynga (ZNGA) moved higher on M&amp;A speculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 0.67 HIGHER AT USD 74.96/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 1.09 HIGHER AT USD 85.00/BBL. </strong>The consolidation of WTI around $75/bbl and Brent around $85/bbl continued on Monday, with participants focusing on comments by IEA chief Birol, who said prices were now entering the &ldquo;red zone&rdquo;, and argued that the oil market was very tight, urging producers to ramp up supply. Interestingly, Birol suggested that Saudi Arabia is able to pump 11mln BPD &ndash; short of the 12mln BPD that was suggested by the Saudi Crown Prince in an interview last week, once again casting doubt on OPEC/OPEC+ supply slack. Birol also added that the IEA was not discussing an oil-stockpile release. Elsewhere, the DOE reported that SPR sales were 1.3mln barrels last week. And in Mexico, Pemex is set to announce new discoveries of light crude in the Gulf of Mexico, though there were few details. Traders are also mindful of weather in the Gulf of Mexico, where around 40% of crude output has been shuttered in anticipation of Hurricane Michael hitting. Looking to this week&rsquo;s inventory data (API Wednesday aftermarket, DOE on Thursday), traders said Genscape was forecasting a build in Cushing stocks this week (+1.7mmln vs 28/Sept, +2.19mln week-on-week).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 3+ TICKS HIGHER AT 117-26. </strong>Following bond market closure on Columbus Day, the Treasury complex drifted higher on Tuesday with longer dated yields coming off multi-year highs, with reports the higher yields were enticing real money, while there were also reports of shorts being covered. The yield curve saw some modest bull-flattening with 30yr yields lower by c.3bps at settlement. The US Treasury will auction USD 74bln in 3-year (USD 36bln of new paper, Wednesday), 10-year (USD 23bln re-opening, Wednesday) and 30-year (USD 15blnre-opening, Thursday); with approximately USD 24bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, the auctions will raise USD 50bln in new cash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The DXY rose to HOD around 96.15 in European trade, as the EC&rsquo;s criticism of the Italian budget plan saw bund/BTP spreads blow out to over 300bps, weighing on the EUR. However, the buck struggled to maintain the gains as trade progressed, and as the US closing bell approached, entered negative territory for the day. Ahead, the USD may once again take its cue from Treasury yields, with the US set to sell $230bn of securities this week including bills. &ldquo;The timing of the auctions could cause the market some issues at a time when it has been struggling to digest larger auction sizes,&quot; UBS fixed income strategists said, &quot;on Wednesday the treasury issues both US 3y and US 10y bonds, but the real test for the market will be Thursday&#39;s USD 15bn of US 30-year, especially given the recent steepening of the UST curve.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The EUR has been relatively stable amid the latest bout of bund/BTP spread widening this week. Commerzbank explains that as long as Mario Draghi&rsquo;s &#39;whatever it takes&#39; pledge remains in place, national crises within the Eurozone will only cause serious FX turbulence if they attack the systemic foundation of the single currency in a way that the ECB&#39;s monetary policy is unable to deal with. &quot;Yesterday&rsquo;s yield rise above all reflects the market&rsquo;s scepticism towards Italian fiscal policy. As long as this scepticism is limited to Italian assets we see no reason to revalue the euro on a sustainable basis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling rallied back to the 1.3150 level on news that the divorce terms with the EU could be settled by Monday; analysts seem to be impressed with the speed of progress, which would give the UK government enough chance to get any deal through parliament by year-end. Officials themselves have presented more cautious comments, perhaps limiting further upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ZAR: </strong>The rand strengthened on news finance minister&rsquo;s offer to resign was accepted by President Ramaphosa. There were some reports in the session that Ramaphosa was said to prefer ex-central banker Mboweni as next finmin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> JPY has been consolidating above 113.00. The latest murmurings out of the US Treasury about the value of China&#39;s currency suggest that near-term escalation of trade conflicts is imminent; accordingly, JPY has once again been in demand. However, SocGen notes that USDJPY and USDCNH are decoupling at the moment, which could signal that USDJPY is taking influence from the US Treasury curve, which has steepend as of late, but also the impact higher Treasury yields is having on pulling JGB yields up with it, with 10-year JGB yields above 0.15%, and 30-year JGBs yielding close to 1.0%, levels which some have suggested might see Japanese institutional investors coming into the JGB market again, saving them costs on FX hedging (given USD hedging costs are judged expensive at present).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PRIMER:</strong> US Q3 2018 Earnings Season. EPS EXPECTATIONS: Consensus view looks for 21.5% YY EPS growth in Q3 2018, according to Reuters. Excluding the energy sector, EPS growth is seen at 18.5% YY. Some analysts have suggested that the tax benefit is expected to add between 7-8% of that growth. Deutsche Bank notes that early reports have seen EPS beats of 3.6%, and it therefore says that this implies earnings growth of around 25.6% in Q3. Heading into earnings season, there were 78 negative EPS pre-announcements issued by S&amp;P 500 companies vs 39 positive. REVENUE EXPECTATIONS: Reuters estimates Q3 2018 revenue growth around 9.5% YY. However, Reuters estimates that excluding the energy sector, revenue growth will likely come in at 8.4%. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/primer-us-q3-2018-earnings-season-09-10-2018\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk Primer.</a></p>\r\n",

Interestingly, Birol suggested that Saudi Arabia is able to pump 11mln BPD &ndash; short of the 12mln BPD that was suggested by the Saudi Crown Prince in an interview last week, once again casting doubt on OPEC/OPEC+ supply slack. Birol also added that the IEA was not discussing an oil-stockpile release. Elsewhere, the DOE reported that SPR sales were 1.3mln barrels last week. And in Mexico, Pemex is set to announce new discoveries of light crude in the Gulf of Mexico, though there were few details. Traders are also mindful of weather in the Gulf of Mexico, where around 40% of crude output has been shuttered in anticipation of Hurricane Michael hitting. Looking to this week&rsquo;s inventory data (API Wednesday aftermarket, DOE on Thursday), traders said Genscape was forecasting a build in Cushing stocks this week (+1.7mmln vs 28/Sept, +2.19mln week-on-week).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar continues its steady advance after a few more blips, with the index back above 96.000 and eclipsing last week&rsquo;s pre-NFP best, albeit marginally at 96.163 vs 96.124 and temporarily. The Greenback retains an underlying bid as US Treasury yields remain elevated ahead of this week&rsquo;s supply, which kicks off on Wednesday with 3 and 10 year auctions due to the holiday-shortened week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency succumbed to more Italian-related fiscal woes to slip further vs the Usd and closer to nearest technical support under 1.1450 at 1.1430 vs 1.1422 before regaining some composure. In short, Economy Minister Tria used his appearance before a parliamentary committee to defend the Government&rsquo;s 2019-2021 budget plan even though the country&rsquo;s auditing court deems its GDP projections to be optimistic and the BoI&rsquo;s 1% estimate for 2019 GDP chimes with those sentiments given the &lsquo;official&rsquo; 1.5% forecast. However, the Kiwi kept the Eur company at the base of the G10 rankings as it eased towards 0.6425, and extended its relative underperformance vs the AUD to 1.0990+ on the cross, as the latter maintained 0.7050+ status vs its US rival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All circa 0.25% weaker vs the Usd at one stage, as Cable fell to within a whisker of Monday&rsquo;s lows ahead of 1.3013 chart support awaiting a speech from Brexit Minister Raab and a barrage of headlines from Ireland&rsquo;s DUP, Germany and Brexiteers within the UK Government. The Loonie bounced off circa 1.3000 lows again after weaker than forecast Canadian housing starts and a downward revision to the previous month&rsquo;s tally, as rebounding oil prices provided some traction, while the Franc marginally added to recent losses at 0.9955, but reclaimed the 1.1300 handle against the aforementioned even weaker Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted earlier, the Jpy&rsquo;s greater safe-haven appeal appears to be fading as 113.00 held after a brief dip below overnight and the headline pair is drawn back up towards a key MA, albeit not quite high enough to execute option expiries at 113.25 (1.1 bn) in time for the NY cut. However, Eur/Jpy remains offered sub-130.00 and has not bounced convincingly from a 129.35 base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choppy trade across the region, as the Cny and Cnh struggled to contain losses through 6.9000 vs the Usd after a PBoC fix just north of that marker overnight, while the Try was hardly delighted or seemingly impressed by the Government&rsquo;s pretty rudimentary measures to deflate CPI via blanket 10% price cuts (not compulsory) and the same reduction in higher rate bank loans. Elsewhere, the Zar fell through barrier support at 15.0000 briefly, but then gradually recovered towards 14.7300 amidst reports that SA President Ramaphosa will make an announcement about Finance Minister Nene and reports that he may opt for ex-SARB&rsquo;s Mboweni as a replacement.</p>\r\n",

Some analysts have suggested that the tax benefit is expected to add between 7-8% of that growth. Deutsche Bank notes that early reports have seen EPS beats of 3.6%, and it therefore says that this implies earnings growth of around 25.6% in Q3. Heading into earnings season, there were 78 negative EPS pre-announcements issued by S&amp;P 500 companies vs 39 positive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>REVENUE EXPECTATIONS: </strong>Reuters estimates Q3 2018 revenue growth around 9.5% YY. However, Reuters estimates that excluding the energy sector, revenue growth will likely come in at 8.4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SECTORS:</strong> (<em>EPS growth forecast/revenue growth forecast</em>)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>S&amp;P 500 +21.5%/+9.5%</li>\r\n  <li>Consumer discretionary: +12.7%/+8.0% - Credit Suisse says that the discretionary ex-internet and retail sector are the only sectors likely to see negative EPS growth when tax benefits are stripped away. &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>Consumer staples: +7.3%/+5.7%</li>\r\n  <li>Energy: +101.5%/+20.9% - expected to be lifted by crude prices, which have surged over the quarter.</li>\r\n  <li>Financials: +40.8%/+8.2% - EPS growth will be distorted by hurricane-related losses booked in Q3 2017.</li>\r\n  <li>Health Care: +10.8%+7.1%</li>\r\n  <li>Industrials: +16.9%/+9.6%</li>\r\n  <li>Materials: +28.8%/+15.2%</li>\r\n  <li>Real Estate: +4.3%/+14.0%</li>\r\n  <li>Tech: +20.3%/+12.2% - Credit Suisse believes tech will be fueled by stronger revenues, with top-line growth in FAANG names seen at between 17-35%.</li>\r\n  <li>Communications: +14.8%/+9.7%</li>\r\n  <li>Utilities: +4.8%/+0.7%</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MARGINS: </strong>Morgan Stanley has pointed out that mentions of cost pressures have been on the rise and margins are near historical highs; investors will be scrutinising the ability of companies to continue pushing earnings growth through margin expansions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TARIFFS: </strong>There has been little information about the potential impact of tariffs on the bottom-line. &quot;Most commentary has taken a &#39;wait and see&#39; approach or indicated that costs will be passed on. With an incremental $200 billion in goods from China now being tariffed we would expect some additional commentary around potential effects.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q4 GUIDANCE: </strong>Morgan Stanley also notes that &quot;in contrast to most recent years, earnings estimates have continued rising through 2018, meaning the bar has not been continually lowered,&quot; and adds that &quot;as we lap a tough 4Q17 comp that saw hurricane relief, tax cut pre-spend, and crypto mania with this year&rsquo;s higher oil and moderation of dollar tailwinds, the outlook for 4Q might be more challenging than the market appreciates.&quot;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.0%) was pressured by the healthcare and lT sectors, while Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) was playing catch-up to yesterday&rsquo;s slump while also subdued by a firmer currency, after re-entering the market from a long weekend. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp.

Italian Deputy PM Salvini stated the government will not change the budget plan; believes it will generate wealth. Italy&#39;s Finance Minister Tria stated that strategy of debt containment has not been efficient and sees need for a boost to economic growth. He added that a constructive dialogue is underway with the European Commission. Italian Finance Minister Tria says that they will do what they have to do if the spread hits 400-500 bps, their goal is to make the spread reflect economic fundamentals adding that if a financial crisis happens they will do as Draghi did.

Indeed, Usd/Jpy is slipping back towards 113.00 again having dipped just below the big figure overnight, and is currently testing the 200 WMA around 113.18. However, decent option expiry interest at 113.25 (1.1 bn) may keep the headline pair afloat, and there is a key Fib circa 112.73 providing underlying support. Conversely, the GBP and NZD are at the foot of the G10 table as Cable retests stops/bids at 1.3050 after another retreat from 1.3100 ahead of yet another UK parliamentary presentation on Brexit, while the Kiwi is pivoting 0.6450 and lagging its more resilient AUD counterpart with the cross up near 1.1000 and Aud/Usd holding close to 0.7100. Elsewhere, the EUR remains top-heavy at 1.1500 vs the Greenback and against the Pound ahead of 0.8800 due to ongoing Italian budget jitters, with the former pairing extending mult-month losses to just above 1.1440 and closer to technical support ahead of 1.1400 at 1.1422. The CAD awaits Canadian housing starts after nothing from BoC&rsquo;s Lane so far, and eyeing option expiries at 1.2950 and 1.2975 in 800 mn+, while the CHF remains relatively confined between 0.9920-50 vs the Dollar and around 1.1400 vs the Eur. DXY underpinned amidst all the above and poised to revisit 96.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Aside from further YUAN depreciation an air of consolidation pervades, with the TRY cautious within 6.0810-1340 trading parameters ahead of the Government&rsquo;s plan to tackle inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both WTI and Brent are up by over 0.6% and testing USD 75/BBL and USD 85/BBL respectively following supply concerns from the Gulf of Mexico where just under 20% of crude oil production has been halted in preparation for hurricane Michael alongside evidence that Iranian crude exports are declining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is uneventful, with the yellow metal trading within a thin USD 4/oz range . Aluminium has fallen slightly amidst reports that Norsk Hydro are preparing to resume their aluminium refinery at half capacity in the coming weeks; currently -0.15% on the day. Iron ore futures in China are up by over 3% in today&#39;s session, with prices supported by increased restocking demand at steel mills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hurricane Michael is currently a Category 1 Hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. Which is currently travelling north and may intensify into a Category 3 Hurricane when it makes landfall at around 07:00 ET on Thursday. Prompted evacuation of 13 oil platforms and has led to a halt of just under 20% of oil production from the gulf of Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More choppy trade in Italian BTPs during and following the latest budget commentary from Rome, but ultimately nothing to prevent another sell-off in futures and ramp up in yields as even Economy Minister Tria appears to be sticking to coalition party lines. 119.00 has now been clearly breached to a 118.26 low, but Bunds have only bounced circa 30 ticks from their 157.61 Eurex session base amidst hefty cash offerings and with the overall trend in bonds still bearish. Similarly, Gilts still below par, albeit very close to a new Liffe peak of 119.93 (-3 ticks vs -28 ticks at one stage) and acknowledging a bumper 2071 syndication that was avidly sought after. US Treasuries midway between overnight ranges and steeper again awaiting the return of cash markets after Monday&rsquo;s holiday and long weekend. Back to the 10 year Italian benchmark, and turning to techs, if 118.00 gives way there is support around 117.71, but little else and losing that chart level is likely to see inverse-correlations to core bonds return with more vigour.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The 10 year German benchmark has retreated a bit further from yesterday&rsquo;s safe haven peaks, partly in line with overnight moves in US Treasuries, but also as Italian BTPs attempt to claw back more lost ground after Monday&rsquo;s meltdown. The former has been mostly in negative territory between 158.00-157.74 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 157.95 close, while the latter has ventured back above 120.00 from a low of 119.46 and 119.77 previous settlement amidst reports that Italy&rsquo;s budget watchdog is likely to reject the Government&rsquo;s fiscal plan. However, Deputy PM Salvini remains resolute about sticking to expansionary deficit targets, while PM Conte and Economy Minister Tria may embark on an investor roadshow to promote Italian bonds and entice domestic buyers. Ahead, no Eurozone data slated, but more from the ECB via Mersch and budget meetings in Rome. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Antipodeans were initially trading with no firm direction; however, AUD and NZD are currently flat against the greenback. Elsewhere, the JPY trades choppy, hovering on either side of the 113.00 level as the deteriorated sentiment brought safe-haven inflows into the Japanese currency.</p>\r\n",
