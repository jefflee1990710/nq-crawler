There wasn&rsquo;t any new narrative for today&rsquo;s price action, though some had suggested that the greenback was back to following Treasury yields, though some analysts &ndash; pointing to correlation studies &ndash; suggest that this line of reasoning could be flimsy. Nevertheless, the dollar losing impetus following yesterday&rsquo;s hawkish Fed allowed EUR to move back above 1.23, helped along by the ECB&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes which stated that the central bank was unlikely to change its forward guidance was premature in January, though could be revised at upcoming meetings; elsewhere, the central bank was upbeat on the economy and inflation. The pound couldn&rsquo;t reclaim the 1.40 despite the USD weakeness, with UK PM May in meetings with her cabinet to thrash out progress relating to Brexit.

Also of comfort to crude will have been the slight dip in US production in the week, while Cushing inventories also printed a draw. The crude complex was also helped by a weaker dollar, with the DXY -0.25% at the crude settlement.

Nevertheless, the dollar losing impetus following yesterday&rsquo;s hawkish Fed allowed EUR to move back above 1.23, helped along by the ECB&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes which stated that the central bank was unlikely to change its forward guidance was premature in January, though could be revised at upcoming meetings; elsewhere, the central bank was upbeat on the economy and inflation. The pound couldn&rsquo;t reclaim the 1.40 despite the USD weakeness, with UK PM May in meetings with her cabinet to thrash out progress relating to Brexit. Commodity FX took its cue from crude/metals (gold did manage to regain the 1330 handle), while EMFX was mixed/slightly lower against the buck, though MXN was higher after the Banxico&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle $1.09 higher at $62.77 per barrel; Brent settles 97 cents higher at $66.39 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI futures settled higher on Thursday after EIA data showed a surprise draw &ndash; in line with what was signalled by the API data released on Wednesday; however, the draw was deeper than the API data suggested. Also of comfort to crude will have been the slight dip in US production in the week, while Cushing inventories also printed a draw. The crude complex was also helped by a weaker dollar, with the DXY -0.25% at the crude settlement. Traders had been expressing scepticism this week as the optimistic narrative from OPEC+ was being offset by ramped-up output from the US &ndash; this week&rsquo;s data suggests at least a temporary pause in that theme, though attention will be on tomorrow&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count data for further cues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks (16 Feb, w/e) -1.616M vs. Exp. 1.795M (Prev. 1.841M); crude production -0.01% to 10.27mln bpd<br />- EIA Weekly Cushing Stocks (w/e 16 Feb 2018): -2.664mln (Prev. -3.642mln)<br />- EIA Weekly Distillate Stocks (w/e 16 Feb 2018): -2.422mln (Exp. -1.46mln, Prev -0.459mln)<br />- EIA Weekly Gasoline Stocks (w/e 16 Feb 2018): 0.261mln (Exp. -0.283mln, Prev. 3.599mln)<br />- EIA Weekly Refining Utilisation (w/e 16 Feb 2018): -1.7% (Exp. -0.8%, Prev. 2.7%)</p>\r\n",

Next week sees approximately USD 107bln of cash flows which includes around USD 100bln in redemptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This set of auctions marks the first of 2-, 5- and 7-year auctions since the US Treasury announced they would be increasing the amount offered in January to help fund the anticipated growth in borrowing stemming from the Trump administration&rsquo;s tax reform and spending package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2-YR AUCTION REVIEW:</strong> Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 2s was soft, with the high yield coming in around WI levels (stops-through 0.1bps), and cover was softer than recent averages (2.72x vs six-action average of 2.83x). Additionally, dealer takedown was high (40.3% vs six-auction average of 38.1%), and indirect participation slipped versus both the previous auction and recent averages. Some had expected a better result, given concession and short positioning going into the auction. There was little market reaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5-YR AUCTION REVIEW:</strong> The US Treasury auctioned $35bln in new 5-year notes, which came in on the screws, with the yield highest since December 2009, while cover was slightly below recent averages. Analysts have pointed out that there were similarities to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 2s (which stopped-through by 0.1bps), in that dealer participation was higher than recent averages, while indirect participation was lower. The sale came ahead of the FOMC&rsquo;s January meeting minutes, and as such, there was limited price action in wake of the auction (again, similar to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7-YR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> The last 7-year auction saw the highest stop-out since 2011, with dealer participation notably low. The latest data shows dealers are net long in the 6-year to 7-year sector to the tune of USD 5.1bln (w/e 7 Feb). Analysts note that the current 7-year note trades fair on asset-swap against older 7s versus the previous auction cycle, while also trading fair on the curve versus 5s and 10s.&nbsp; &ldquo;A cheaper outright level, with the current 7-year note yield above the 7-year auctions stop-out rate since March 2011, is a positive for the upcoming auction along with the month-end extension demand,&rdquo; Societe Generale writes. Negatives for the auction include the higher issuance sizes announced by the US Treasury at the recent quarterly refunding &ndash; and that supply comes amid a hefty slate of both sovereign and corporate supply this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"274\" src=\"/system/ckeditor_assets/pictures/3/content_7yr_hist.jpg\" width=\"383\" /></p>\r\n",

There was some initial reservation on the revelation that some GC members favoured removing the easing bias, but again this is not really a surprise given well known more hawkish policy setters. The 10 year German benchmark has climbed to 158.68 and back towards the 158.75 Eurex peak, but still short of yesterday&rsquo;s session best ahead of a busy US agenda. Meanwhile, Gilts continue to languish and have retreated below par after a knee-jerk bounce on the UK GDP data. More action in FX where the Usd is firming up again, but still underperforming the safe-haven Jpy.</p>\r\n",

Any clarity around this<br />issue could set up market expectations for the ECB&rsquo;s March meeting which could be decisive for the ECB to outline their plans for<br />2018. In terms of recent rhetoric from the ECB, Vasiliauskas has stated that it is appropriate to rephrase ECB&rsquo;s guidance to focus<br />on all instruments, not just bonds and that ECB&rsquo;s QE should be tapered and not be ended suddenly</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, focus at the previous conference fell on the ECB&rsquo;s assessment of recent FX volatility, something that at the time<br />Draghi described as a source of uncertainty. This was then followed up by source reports suggesting that rate setters are split on<br />their views regarding the timing of their next move given the recent EUR move, therefore any clarity on this issue will be<br />welcomed by the market albeit the recent extension of USD weakness may leave any stated views slightly out-of-date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As ever with the ECB minutes, they come out four weeks after the initial meeting and as such are often perceived as slightly out-ofdate<br />but (as was the case with the previous minutes release), still have the propensity to move the market if they are at odds with<br />what was discussed during Draghi&rsquo;s press conference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The prospect of &lsquo;further&rsquo; gradual rate hikes as noted in the most recent FOMC minutes boosted speculation that 4 rate hikes could be on the table particularly that these minutes were before the strong wage data in the most recent NFP and inflation data last week, which had subsequently pushed bond yields higher with the US 10yr yield hitting 2.95%, while equities slumped late in the US session. This transpired in Asia, with the <strong>Nikkei (-1.1%)</strong> and <strong>Hang Seng (-1.5%) </strong>seeing losses of over 1%, while <strong>ASX 200 (+0.1%)</strong> saw initial 0.4% gains trimmed, with price action in Australia largely dictated by the slew of earnings. In credit markets, the belly of the curve underperformed, with JGB 10yr yields tracking UST yields higher, while a firm 20yr JGB auction supported longer dated debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japan PM Abe Adviser Hamada says the BoJ should consider buying foreign bonds.

In terms of sector specific moves, material names modestly lag their peers following price action in the complex as well as a disappointing earnings update from <strong>Anglo American (-4%)</strong> which has sent their shares near the bottom of the FSTE 100; with the index also hampered by lacklustre earnings from the likes of <strong>British American Tobacco (-4.6%),</strong> <strong>Barratt Developments (-4.0%)</strong> and BAE systems. However, losses for UK stocks have been capped by a well-received earnings report from <strong>Barclays (+5.1%)</strong> which allied with upside in <strong>AXA shares (+1.2%) </strong>post-earnings has also supported the financial sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>DXY</strong> has nailed 90.000 with the aid of hawkish FOMC minutes, but <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong> continues to buck the broader trend amidst the ongoing global stock market retracement and heightened volatility. Flow-wise, heavy supply at and just ahead of 108.00 is still capping the pair, while 108.02 represents Fib resistance and the headline looks increasingly toppy given lower peaks since the recent 107.90 high. Hence, the broader <strong>Dollar</strong> and index is struggling to maintain gains and mount a challenge of the next upside technical objective at 90.886 despite reclaiming more lost ground vs other G10 rivals. <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> has lost grip of the 1.2300 handle and could see more downside on the back of a significantly weaker than expected German Ifo survey, especially as the technical picture also looks bearish below its 1.2319 Fib level and with little in the way of support until 1.2206. Cable is testing bids under 1.3900 amidst latest Brexit-related UK political accusations aimed at PM May, but holding above chart support seen around 1.3830. As per the single currency, Sterling may be prone to further losses in wake of a data miss as UK Q4 GDP was downgraded on zero business investment during the quarter (again likely as a result of Brexit). Elsewhere, Usd/majors fairly flat as the DXY hovers just above the 90.000 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bunds</strong> have extended post-German Ifo survey gains, and maintained outperformance vs <strong>Gilts</strong> in the process even though UK debt has been boosted by an unexpected downward revision to Q4 growth (and no business investment whatsoever).

        "content": "<p>European equities (-1%) have kicked the session off on the back-foot as European participants digest the fall-out of yesterday&rsquo;s more hawkish than anticipated FOMC minutes which saw rate-setters take a confident view on the growth and inflation outlook. In terms of sector specific moves, material names modestly lag their peers following price action in the complex as well as a disappointing earnings update from Anglo American (-4%) which has sent their shares near the bottom of the FSTE 100; with the index also hampered by lacklustre earnings from the likes of British American Tobacco (-4.6%), Barratt Developments (-4.0%) and BAE systems. However, losses for UK stocks have been capped by a well-received earnings report from Barclays (+5.1%) which allied with upside in AXA shares (+1.2%) post-earnings has also supported the financial sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY has nailed 90.000 with the aid of hawkish FOMC minutes, but Usd/Jpy continues to buck the broader trend amidst the ongoing global stock market retracement and heightened volatility. Flow-wise, heavy supply at and just ahead of 108.00 is still capping the pair, while 108.02 represents Fib resistance and the headline looks increasingly toppy given lower peaks since the recent 107.90 high. Hence, the broader Dollar and index is struggling to maintain gains and mount a challenge of the next upside technical objective at 90.886 despite reclaiming more lost ground vs other G10 rivals. Eur/Usd has lost grip of the 1.2300 handle and could see more downside on the back of a significantly weaker than expected German Ifo survey, especially as the technical picture also looks bearish below its 1.2319 Fib level and with little in the way of support until 1.2206. Cable is testing bids under 1.3900 amidst latest Brexit-related UK political accusations aimed at PM May, but holding above chart support seen around 1.3830. As per the single currency, Sterling may be prone to further losses in wake of a data miss as UK Q4 GDP was downgraded on zero business investment during the quarter (again likely as a result of Brexit). Elsewhere, Usd/majors fairly flat as the DXY hovers just above the 90.000 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have extended post-German Ifo survey gains, and maintained outperformance vs Gilts in the process even though UK debt has been boosted by an unexpected downward revision to Q4 growth (and no business investment whatsoever).

Next week sees approximately USD 107bln of cash flows which includes around USD 100bln in redemptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This set of auctions marks the first of 2-, 5- and 7-year auctions since the US Treasury announced they would be increasing the amount offered in January to help fund the anticipated growth in borrowing stemming from the Trump administration&rsquo;s tax reform and spending package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2-YR AUCTION REVIEW:</strong> Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 2s was soft, with the high yield coming in around WI levels (stops-through 0.1bps), and cover was softer than recent averages (2.72x vs six-action average of 2.83x). Additionally, dealer takedown was high (40.3% vs six-auction average of 38.1%), and indirect participation slipped versus both the previous auction and recent averages. Some had expected a better result, given concession and short positioning going into the auction. There was little market reaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5-YR AUCTION REVIEW:</strong> The US Treasury auctioned $35bln in new 5-year notes, which came in on the screws, with the yield highest since December 2009, while cover was slightly below recent averages. Analysts have pointed out that there were similarities to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 2s (which stopped-through by 0.1bps), in that dealer participation was higher than recent averages, while indirect participation was lower. The sale came ahead of the FOMC&rsquo;s January meeting minutes, and as such, there was limited price action in wake of the auction (again, similar to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7-YR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> The last 7-year auction saw the highest stop-out since 2011, with dealer participation notably low. The latest data shows dealers are net long in the 6-year to 7-year sector to the tune of USD 5.1bln (w/e 7 Feb). Analysts note that the current 7-year note trades fair on asset-swap against older 7s versus the previous auction cycle, while also trading fair on the curve versus 5s and 10s.&nbsp; &ldquo;A cheaper outright level, with the current 7-year note yield above the 7-year auctions stop-out rate since March 2011, is a positive for the upcoming auction along with the month-end extension demand,&rdquo; Societe Generale writes. Negatives for the auction include the higher issuance sizes announced by the US Treasury at the recent quarterly refunding &ndash; and that supply comes amid a hefty slate of both sovereign and corporate supply this week.</p>\r\n",

Ahead, Germany&rsquo;s Ifo survey in focus, but the regional spotlight falls on the ECB and minutes from the January policy meeting. On the supply front, the final leg of this week&rsquo;s mega US issuance arrives in the form of Usd29 bn 7 year notes that normally draws decent foreign demand and comes with a bigger concession given the latest rise in rates across the curve. However, indirect bidders have been reticent so far and another set of weak results could be the precursor for another leg higher.</p>\r\n",

AU 10yr yield now trading at a 6bps discount to US 10yr yields, while the currency has also been pressured from the softness in commodity markets.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI crude futures failed to be supported by the surprise drawdown in last nights API crude report, with WTI trading with losses of around 1%. Additionally, moves to the downside had been exacerbated after stops had been tripped at USD 61.05, which saw WTI hit a low of USD 60.75 and as such now remains below the USD 61.00/bbl mark. Precious metals had a relatively quiet session as gold prices languished around yesterday&rsquo;s lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (16 Feb, w/e) -0.907M vs. Exp. 1.800M (Prev. 3.947M)<br />- API weekly dist. stocks (16 Feb, w/e) -3.563mln (Exp. -1.500mln, Prev. 1.095mln)<br />- API weekly gasoline stk (16 Feb, w/e) 1.468mln (Exp. -0.300mln, Prev. 4.634mln)<br />- API Cushing number (16 Feb, w/e) -2.644mln (Prev. -3.319mln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREASURIES: US T-Note Futures settle 9 ticks lower at 120-06+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury auctioned $35bln in new 5-year notes, which came in on the screws, with the yield highest since December 2009, while cover was slightly below recent averages. Analysts have pointed out that there were similarities to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 2s (which stopped-through by 0.1bps), in that dealer participation was higher than recent averages, while indirect participation was lower. The sale came ahead of the FOMC&rsquo;s January meeting minutes, and as such, there was limited price action in wake of the auction (again, similar to yesterday&rsquo;s auction).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The immediate reaction to the FOMC&rsquo;s meeting minutes was dovish, albeit very muted. However, as the details were digested, the tplex saw selling pressure, with T-Note futures finding fresh session lows and yields for 10s and 30s rising to YTD highs. At settlement, the curve had bear steepened, and major curve spreads had widened (5s30s was particularly noticeable rising c.3bps).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&#39;s Quarles</strong> states that gradual interest rate increases are appropriate, adding that soft inflation likely transitory and is not a cause for great concern. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&#39;s Kashkari</strong> stress the need to wait &amp; see on inflation, adds that US economy is doing very well and is surprised at confidence due to tax cut.

The prospect of &lsquo;further&rsquo; gradual rate hikes as noted in the most recent FOMC minutes boosted speculation that 4 rate hikes could be on the table, which had subsequently pushed bond yields higher with the US 10yr yield hitting 2.95%, while equities slumped late in the US session. This transpired in Asia, with the Nikkei and Hang Seng seeing losses of over 1%, while ASX 200 saw initial 0.4% gains pared, with price action in Australia largely dictated by the slew of earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across FX markets, the USD index hovers back 90.00 following the hawkish FOMC meeting minutes, while throughout the Asian session JPY is notably firmer against its counterpart amid the risk off tone, which has seen the JPY trading at session highs. Elsewhere, antipodeans are on the back foot with the AUD weakening through the 0.78 handle vs the greenback. AU 10yr yield now trading at a 0.6bps discount to US 10yr yields, while the currency has also been pressured from the softness in commodity markets.</p>\r\n",
