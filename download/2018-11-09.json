        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP â€“ 9th November 2018: WTI sees tenth day of losses",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities down, Treasuries up, dollar up, crude down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: US Final PPI jumps; Michigan confidence moderates; Jo Johnson resigned from PM May&rsquo;s government; Eurogroup&rsquo;s Centeno does not exclude procedure against Italy; PBOC sees &ldquo;downward pressures&rdquo; in China economy.<br />* NEXT WEEK: EU Summit (TBC), Deadline for Italian budget re-submission, Japanese PPI &amp; GDP, UK Labour Market report, OPEC Monthly Report, Australian NAB Business Conditions, German ZEW Survey, US Federal Budget, Chinese Retail Sales, UK CPI, Eurozone GDP Flash &amp; Employment, US CPI, Australian Labour Market report, UK Retail Sales, US Philly Fed, NY Fed Mfg, Indonesian Rate Decision, Eurozone CPI, US Industrial Production.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>In latest comments, Irish PM Varadkar said negotiations are at a sensitive point noting that a deal is possible in the next couple of weeks though highlighting that a lot of things can go wrong; and similarly German Foreign Affairs Minister Maas said to be optimistic on an agreement but he is still preparing for a no deal. Elsewhere, UK Junior Transport Minister Jo Johnson resigned from the position over PM May&#39;s proposed plan with sources reporting that more government resignations could follow from this, whilst PM May once again denied any possibility of a second referendum. In later trade, the EU was said to require more movement from the UK on Brexit while the EU Commission briefed EU27 representatives; Brexit negotiations are set to continue over the weekend. As a brief summary, optimism at the start of the week in wake of reports that UK PM May secured private concessions from Brussels was short-lived after UK Cabinet meetings were unable to strike any meaningful progress. Cabinet members, led by Environment Minister Gove demanded full legal advice before signing-off on May&rsquo;s deal, which subsequently delayed an EU ambassador meeting which was scheduled to assess the viability of an emergency November EU summit. Furthermore, both the Republic of and Northern Ireland voiced their discontent with PM May&rsquo;s efforts to resolve the Irish border issue, thus bringing into question the UK PM&rsquo;s ability to strike a deal with Brussels and then have the numbers to pass it in the UK Parliament given the supply and confidence agreement with the DUP. As such, next week will most likely be absolutely crucial in determining whether or not both sides can strike an agreement with a slew of meetings scheduled to attempt to break the deadlock. A breakdown in talks with no meaningful progress will almost inevitably be treated as a market negative, whereas an agreement between the EU and UK will be met positively; however, the longevity of any moves in this scenario might be brought into question as markets then asses the viability of May passing the deal in Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>European Trade Commissioner Malmstrom said the US still shows little interest in tariff cuts deal and added the EU is working as fast as possible on a trade deal with the US. Elsewhere, US Trade Advisor Navarro stated US steel and aluminium tariffs have spurred investment and has not led to the disasters predicted; he added US economic security is national security. Also, US Secretary of State Pompeo stated the US is seeking friendly and constructive dialogue with China while Chinese Official Yang said China has committed itself to working with the US in a non-confrontational way adding economic teams will seek mutually acceptable solution on trade. Yang added that China&rsquo;s door to dialogue has and will remain open. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> On Friday, Eurogroup Head Centeno stated that sanctions against Italy are not on the agenda right now, whilst Economy Minister Tria said he doesn&#39;t take for granted that there will be excessive procedure against Italy. Nonetheless, such a move would be a serious test of the populist government&rsquo;s resolve and would either force the hand of the government to lower its demands or defy the EC; either outcome would likely be costly for the government. Alongside this, after the EU Commission expressed the view that the deficit/GDP ratio will reach 2.9% on Thursday, Deputy PM Di Maio and Finance Minister Tria reiterated their commitment to the 2.4% deficit goal in 2019. Di Maio also stated he does not think the EU will levy sanctions on Italy whilst Tria, commenting on the spread, said a 300bps widening is worrying if it lasts for long and note it stretched to 301bps on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US PPI:</strong> October PPI beat to the upside, with the headline printing 0.6% MM, beating the 0.2% consensus. Core also beat to the upside (0.5% MM vs 0.2% expected). &ldquo;This looks terrible, but all the overshoot to consensus is in the wildly volatile trade services component, which measures margins in retailing and wholesaling and accounts for 23% of the core,&rdquo; Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote, &ldquo;we expected a rebound after a run of soft numbers but the 1.6% m/m jump was bigger than we expected; it likely will correct in November.&rdquo; Pantheon also notes that core goods prices were unchanged, and the rate of increase is slowing as the push from rising oil prices fades. &ldquo;Car and light truck prices fell sharply m/m, perhaps explaining why auto sales were so strong last month. Core services inflation has peaked too, unless oil prices rebound strongly&rdquo; the consultancy said, adding that &ldquo;in short, this looks to us like a one-time spike in the core; it doesn&rsquo;t change our views on the outlook for either the PPI or measures of consumer inflation at all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN:</strong> Consumer sentiment saw a small moderation in November, according to the University of Michigan. &ldquo;Importantly, interviewing went through Wednesday night so there was only a one-day overlap after the mid-term election results were known by consumers,&rdquo; Surveys of Consumers chief economist Richard Curtin, &ldquo;those few cases held expectations that were identical with the data collected earlier in the month, which is not so surprising given that the split between the House and Senate was widely anticipated.&rdquo; The survey also stated that the unchanged data meant that the Sentiment Index remained higher thus far in 2018 (98.4) than in any prior year since 2000. &ldquo;The stability of consumer sentiment at high levels acts to mask some important underlying shifts,&rdquo; the survey said, &ldquo;income expectations have improved, and consumers anticipate continued robust growth in employment, but consumers also anticipate rising inflation and higher interest rates.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Williams (voter, neutral) said sustainable growth depends on healthy job market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.9% at 2781, NDX -1.7% at 7039, DJI -0.7% at 25989. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.4%, Materials -1.4%, Industrials -1.4%, Cons Discretionary -1.5%, Cons Staples +0.5%, Healthcare -0.3%, Financials -0.9%, Tech -1.7%, Telecoms -1.5%, Utilities +0.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Walt Disney (DIS) was a top mover today after it beat EPS and revenue estimates. Campbell Soup (CPB) traded higher following investment firm Third Point urging shareholders to vote in favour of its trimmed list of board nominees. Several consumer staples outperformed today such as Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Coty (COTY) and Kimberley-Clark (KMB). Activision Blizzard (ATVI) nosedived after missing EPS and revenue estimates and significantly cutting its EPS guidance. Century Link (CTL) also dipped lower after poor earnings. General Electric (GE) was a bottom mover on the back of JPMorgan lowering its price target, citing dismal earnings. A drop in copper prices lead to a fall in the miner Freeport-McMoRan (FXC). Trade-sensitive stocks, such as Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), traded lower after negative economic data from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 48C LOWER AT $ 60.19/BBL; BRENT (F9) SETTLES 47C LOWER AT $ 70.18/BBL. </strong>WTI fell for the tenth straight session, a losing streak not seen in 35 years. Front month WTI has been trying to form a base around $60/bbl, while some note that technical factors could portend a bounce-back is on the cards since the RSI is in oversold territory not seen in four years. Both Brent and WTI are now in bear market territory. The narrative being cited is that although Iranian sanctions were seen as hitting oil output, the US has granted sanction waivers, while inventory builds are adding to the downside. On the demand side of the equation, trade wars, concerns about a slowdown in China, and the recent global GDP growth revisions lower by some institutions has put a negative shadow over WTI. On Friday, Baker Hughes reported that US drillers added oil rigs for the fourth week in five (+12 in the week, while gas rigs +2 in the week, taking the total rig count +14).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 11 TICKS HIGHER AT 118-04. </strong>Although the Fed&rsquo;s statement on Thursday was largely considered hawkish, Treasuries resumed its role as a haven amid the stock slide and renewed concerns around the Chinese economy (PBOC sees downward pressures on China growth, in its Q3 monpol implementation report, which brought out buyers in Tsys), with yields coming in by between c.3-4bps by settlement; major curve spreads were generally biased towards flattening (of up to around 1.5bps) though the 5s30s and 10s30s part of the curve was modestly wider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP - USD: </strong>Another topsy-turvy week for the Dollar, but in contrast to its sharp retracement from last Wednesday&rsquo;s new ytd peak, it has been a case of stopping the rot and regrouping after a midweek/post-midterm election slump. Indeed, the DXY looks set to end Friday&rsquo;s session around 96.700 and almost 100 ticks off worst levels, with decent prospects of netting a small gain vs &lsquo;opening&rsquo; levels circa 96.402, partly on the back of firmer than forecast US PPI data and an upbeat Fed keeping end of 2018 tightening firmly on the agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie has essentially mirrored Greenback moves or been most inversely-correlated than other majors, with sliding oil prices exacerbating its marked downturn as the week draws to a close. Canadian data did not really factor, as Usd/Cad rebound to 1.3200 from circa 1.3050 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Also largely oblivious to UK data, even when a barrage finally arrived on the final session of the week and included relatively encouraging Q3 GDP and a narrower than expected trade deficit. Instead, the Pound was split between Brexit headline-watching and external impulses with more reports about progress towards a deal with the EU offset by denials, in-house Government squabbling and above all else still no Irish border/customs union/back-stop resolution. Hence, Cable currently not far from where it started the week (1.3040) within a 1.2960-1.3175 range, and awaiting any news about another Cabinet meeting over the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency has also endured a week of fairly extreme peaks and troughs, partly in lock-step with the Buck&rsquo;s changing fortunes, but also due to more Italian-EU budget wrangling that came to a head with EC forecasts highlighting marked divergence of opinion on growth, deficit, debt reduction and servicing due to BTP spread widening (as well as higher outright yields). Some downbeat Eurozone macro releases (like services PMIs) also undermined the Eur to an extent, with Eur/Usd presently back down near the base of 1.1325-1.1500 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>The Antipodean Dollars derived little if any independent impetus from either the RBA or RBNZ even though both were a bit more upbeat in terms of economic assessments. The ongoing US-China trade spat continues to hamper the Aud especially, while the Kiwi had its wings clipped by Governor Orr keeping the option to ease the OCR on the table. However, the former has recovered well from just below 0.7200 at one stage and is now just shy of 0.7250 having popped its head above 0.7300 at best, while the Nzd is hovering around 0.6750 and closer to the upper echelons of a 0.6630-0.6800 band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>A late week swoon in risk sentiment has helped the Jpy in particular claw back some lost ground vs the Usd, but it is still nearer the lows than highs on the aforementioned Buck revival having traded down to 114.10 and circa 113.00. Meanwhile, the Franc has paid some heed to several reminders from the SNB, including a Government publication containing quotes from Governor Jordan, about the ongoing need for direct intervention and policy accommodation given a still highly valued Chf and currency market fragility. Hence, Usd/Chf has been mainly above parity and not far from 1.1000 earlier on Friday, with the Eur/Chf over 1.1400 for the most part, even though the single currency has had bearish factors to deal with (as noted above).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK, NOK: </strong>A solid week from both a fundamental and technical perspective for the Scandi crowns has been derailed somewhat by significantly softer than expected Norwegian inflation data, not far in advance of Swedish CPI next week that could determine whether the Riskbank opts to hike in December or February 2019. Eur/Nok currently around 9.5450 vs 9.5000 at the base this week and just over 9.5800 at the other extreme, and Eur/Sek now circa 10.2750 vs 10.3530 and 10.2430 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Monday: Japanese PPI Tuesday: UK Labour Market report, OPEC Monthly Report, Australian NAB Business Conditions, German ZEW Survey, US Federal Budget, Japanese GDP, deadline for Italian budget re-submission Wednesday: Chinese Retail Sales, Fed&#39;s Powell speaks at Dallas Fed Event, UK CPI, Eurozone GDP Flash &amp; Employment, US CPI Thursday: Australian Labour Market report, UK Retail Sales, US Philly Fed, NY Fed Mfg, Indonesian Rate Decision Friday: EU Summit (TBC), Eurozone CPI, US Industrial Production. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20526/download\">Click here for full report.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RANsquawk Central Bank Weekly </strong>9 November Reviewing FOMC, RBA, RBNZ, Riksbank minutes; <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20527/download\">To download the report, please click here</a></p>\r\n",

Both Brent and WTI are now in bear market territory.

On the demand side of the equation, trade wars, concerns about a slowdown in China, and the recent global GDP growth revisions lower by some institutions has put a negative shadow over WTI. On Friday, Baker Hughes reported that US drillers added oil rigs for the fourth week in five (+12 in the week, while gas rigs +2 in the week, taking the total rig count +14).</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: some belated fireworks, more Brexit bartering and Italian budget barbs",
        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another topsy-turvy week for the Dollar, but in contrast to its sharp retracement from last Wednesday&rsquo;s new ytd peak, it has been a case of stopping the rot and regrouping after a midweek/post-midterm election slump. Indeed, the DXY looks set to end Friday&rsquo;s session around 96.700 and almost 100 ticks off worst levels, with decent prospects of netting a small gain vs &lsquo;opening&rsquo; levels circa 96.402, partly on the back of firmer than forecast US PPI data and an upbeat Fed keeping end of 2018 tightening firmly on the agenda,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has essentially mirrored Greenback moves or been most inversely-correlated than other majors, with sliding oil prices exacerbating its marked downturn as the week draws to a close. Canadian data did not really factor, as Usd/Cad rebound to 1.3200 from circa 1.3050 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also largely oblivious to UK data, even when a barrage finally arrived on the final session of the week and included relatively encouraging Q3 GDP and a narrower than expected trade deficit. Instead, the Pound was split between Brexit headline-watching and external impulses with more reports about progress towards a deal with the EU offset by denials, in-house Government squabbling and above all else still no Irish border/customs union/back-stop resolution. Hence, Cable currently not far from where it started the week (1.3040) within a 1.2960-1.3175 range, and awaiting any news about another Cabinet meeting over the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has also endured a week of fairly extreme peaks and troughs, partly in lock-step with the Buck&rsquo;s changing fortunes, but also due to more Italian-EU budget wrangling that came to a head with EC forecasts highlighting marked divergence of opinion on growth, deficit, debt reduction and servicing due to BTP spread widening (as well as higher outright yields). Some downbeat Eurozone macro releases (like services PMIs) also undermined the Eur to an extent, with Eur/Usd presently back down near the base of 1.1325-1.1500 parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Antipodean Dollars derived little if any independent impetus from either the RBA or RBNZ even though both were a bit more upbeat in terms of economic assessments. The ongoing US-China trade spat continues to hamper the Aud especially, while the Kiwi had its wings clipped by Governor Orr keeping the option to ease the OCR on the table. However, the former has recovered well from just below 0.7200 at one stage and is now just shy of 0.7250 having popped its head above 0.7300 at best, while the Nzd is hovering around 0.6750 and closer to the upper echelons of a 0.6630-0.6800 band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A late week swoon in risk sentiment has helped the Jpy in particular claw back some lost ground vs the Usd, but it is still nearer the lows than highs on the aforementioned Buck revival having traded down to 114.10 and circa 113.00. Meanwhile, the Franc has paid some heed to several reminders from the SNB, including a Government publication containing quotes from Governor Jordan, about the ongoing need for direct intervention and policy accommodation given a still highly valued Chf and currency market fragility. Hence, Usd/Chf has been mainly above parity and not far from 1.1000 earlier on Friday, with the Eur/Chf over 1.1400 for the most part, even though the single currency has had bearish factors to deal with (as noted above).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A solid week from both a fundamental and technical perspective for the Scandi crowns has been derailed somewhat by significantly softer than expected Norwegian inflation data, not far in advance of Swedish CPI next week that could determine whether the Riskbank opts to hike in December or February 2019. Eur/Nok currently around 9.5450 vs 9.5000 at the base this week and just over 9.5800 at the other extreme, and Eur/Sek now circa 10.2750 vs 10.3530 and 10.2430 respectively.</p>\r\n",

Material names lag amid the slump in base metal prices, while consumer staples outperform. The finance sector is also experiencing weakness with the likes of Spanish banks exposed to Mexico (BBVA -6.7%, Sabadell -2.8%, Santander -2.4%) pressured after Mexican banks fell overnight amid a surprise proposal from the incoming President AMLO to scrap bank fees. (Note: BBVA made 28% of its revenues and 34% of its operating income from Mexico last year.) Meanwhile, UBS (-4.3%) shares declines after the US Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the bank for defrauding investors in its sales of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the global financial crisis. Over in Germany, steel-maker Thyssenkrupp (-11.0%) shares slumped after the company announced a profit warning due to provisions for an ongoing cartel probe and quality problems at its auto business. Elsewhere, Richemont (-6.7%) shares declines amid disappointing earnings, hitting the likes of European Luxury names (LVMH -2.0%, Kering -3.6%) in sympathy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The buck appears to have stopped for the Greenback on Wednesday, and its resurgence from mid-term election lows has been fuelled to a degree by the latest FOMC policy statement that effectively underpins market expectations for a December hike. Amidst almost universal gains vs currency counterparts, the index is now nudging 97.000 from just shy of 95.700 at one stage and the 2018 peak of 97.201 is back within striking distance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Brexit impulses continue to ebb and flow between positive vibes on deal prospects and the proverbial cliff edge withdrawal, but the bottom line is that Irish border and back-stop differences remain unresolved to leave the UK at risk of failing to agree terms at home and/or with the EU. Hence, Sterling has lost momentum and is underperforming alongside the NOK (undermined by much softer than expected Norwegian inflation data to trade down around 9.5700 vs the Eur) within the G10 ranks, as Cable teeters above 1.3000, and largely shrugged off a barrage of UK data (GDP firm and trade above consensus, but other elements less encouraging).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/EUR - The next worst majors, with Loonie hit by collapsing oil prices and sliding towards 1.3200 vs its US peer, while the single currency continues its relatively sharp and abrupt pull-back from 1.1500 to retest support ahead of the 1.1300 ytd low. Ongoing Italian-EU budget differences are weighing along with more signs of a slowdown, or even weakness in the Eurozone economy, while hefty option expiries are also eyed (1.1300 in 1.1 bn, 1.1340-50 in 2.0 bn and 1.1375 in 1.3 bn for example).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - Also falling prey to their US rival&rsquo;s revival and hardly helped by neutral or wait-and-see policy guidance from the RBA or RBNZ, as Aud/Usd recoils to sub-0.7250 and Nzd/Usd backs off further from almost 0.6800 to under 0.6750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - More divergence between the &lsquo;safe-havens&rsquo; as the Jpy bucks the overall trend and holds its own vs the Usd, albeit weakening to 114.00+ at one stage overnight, while the Franc is depreciating and not far from 1.1000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-1.6%) and Brent (-1.4%) lost the USD 60/bbl and USD 70/bbl handles respectively, after the complex entered into bear market territory amid rising supply and concerns of a slowdown in global economic growth. Both benchmarks declined around 20% from the four-year highs reached at the front end of October and are set for a fifth straight week of declines, while North Sea Brent Crude hit seven-month lows. The slide has been exacerbated by US&rsquo; decision to permit eight countries to continue importing Iranian oil after the imposition of sanctions on the OPEC member, as well as record production of crude oil over in the States. Looking ahead, investors and traders will be focusing on this weekend&rsquo;s meeting of OPEC and its allies where they are set to discuss output strategies in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. During the week, there were source reports that Russia and Saudi are to start discussing oil production cuts in 2019. This comes after OPEC&rsquo;s October production reached the highest level since 2016, while Russia hiked its output in the prior month to recent highs of 11.4mln BPD. Producers on Sunday will have to discuss the threat of a glut alongside the prospect of lower demand from faltering EM economies and repercussions from US-Sino trade disputes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, metals trade lower across the board with copper underperforming amid post-FOMC dollar strength and concerns regarding slowing global economic growth. Among precious metals, spot gold (-0.3%) tracks USD action, with the yellow metal dropping to the lowest level this month, while spot silver (-0.4%) is set for its largest weekly percentage decline in nine weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Federal judge blocked Keystone XL Pipeline stating that US administration&#39;s justification for the approval was incomplete, while the judge added that the State Department failed to evaluate climate impact, oil spills and cultural resources.

Furthermore, Haley commented that Russia wants to lift banking restriction on North Korea but the US will not let that happen. (Newswires) Reports thereafter suggested that North Korea and US are rescheduling there postponed talks. (Yonhap)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have both advanced further amidst the broadly risk-off environment and with extra incentive from the more pronounced sell-off in crude, while the former will also be keeping note of Italian debt as Roman Government officials and their EU peers continue to wrangle over budget issues, ahead of Tria&rsquo;s showdown with Centeno. Bunds are just off a 159.82 peak and Gilts have eased off 121.59 (+45 and +41 ticks respectively), while BTPs are closer to the bottom end of a 121.41-122.10 range vs yesterday&rsquo;s 122.05 close. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are back in bull-flattening mode following the Fed and looking towards PPI data before Michigan sentiment and wholesale trade.</p>\r\n",

Producers on Sunday will have to discuss the threat of a glut alongside the prospect of lower demand from faltering EM economies and repercussions from US-Sino trade disputes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, metals trade lower across the board with copper underperforming amid post-FOMC dollar strength and concerns regarding slowing global economic growth. Among precious metals, spot gold (-0.3%) tracks USD action, with the yellow metal dropping to the lowest level this month, while spot silver (-0.4%) is set for its largest weekly percentage decline in nine weeks.</p>\r\n",

Amidst almost universal gains vs currency counterparts, the index is now nudging 97.000 from just shy of 95.700 at one stage and the 2018 peak of 97.201 is back within striking distance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brexit impulses continue to ebb and flow between positive vibes on deal prospects and the proverbial cliff edge withdrawal, but the bottom line is that Irish border and back-stop differences remain unresolved to leave the UK at risk of failing to agree terms at home and/or with the EU. Hence, Sterling has lost momentum and is underperforming alongside the NOK (undermined by much softer than expected Norwegian inflation data to trade down around 9.5700 vs the Eur) within the G10 ranks, as Cable teeters above 1.3000, and largely shrugged off a barrage of UK data (GDP firm and trade above consensus, but other elements less encouraging).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next worst majors, with Loonie hit by collapsing oil prices and sliding towards 1.3200 vs its US peer, while the single currency continues its relatively sharp and abrupt pull-back from 1.1500 to retest support ahead of the 1.1300 ytd low. Ongoing Italian-EU budget differences are weighing along with more signs of a slowdown, or even weakness in the Eurozone economy, while hefty option expiries are also eyed (1.1300 in 1.1 bn,&nbsp;1.1340-50 in 2.0 bn and&nbsp;1.1375 in 1.3 bn for example).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also falling prey to their US rival&rsquo;s revival and hardly helped by neutral or wait-and-see policy guidance from the RBA or RBNZ, as Aud/Usd recoils to sub-0.7250 and Nzd/Usd backs off further from almost 0.6800 to under 0.6750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More divergence between the &lsquo;safe-havens&rsquo; as the Jpy bucks the overall trend and holds its own vs the Usd, albeit weakening to 114.00+ at one stage overnight, while the Franc is depreciating and not far from 1.1000.</p>\r\n",

However, the letter noted that PM May said she would never allow this to occur, while a spokesperson also said the government will not agree to anything that results to a hard border on Ireland, nor will it accept a division of the UK into 2 customs territories.

(Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY held firm near post-FOMC highs as expectations remained unwavered for a December rate hike. The greenback had already strengthened in the hours heading into the Fed announcement, which then persisted following the release. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD languished near the prior day&rsquo;s lows, while antipodeans were softer with AUD failing to benefit from the slight upward revisions to growth and CPI forecasts in the RBA&rsquo;s SOMP, as the central bank also noted a potential impact to the Asia region from the US-China trade dispute. Elsewhere, reports that a US Federal judge blocked the Keystone XL Pipeline only briefly pressured CAD, while the risk averse tone spurred flows into safe-haven JPY which weighed on JPY-crosses and although USD/JPY gave up the 114.00 handle, losses in the pair were stemmed by the USD strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA Statement on Monetary Policy stated board does not see a strong case for a change in rates in the near-term, while it added outlook for inflation and unemployment mean higher rates are likely at some point. RBA stated that trade-weighted AUD is contained by offsetting forces and that many Asian economies could be impacted by US-China trade dispute.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly lower following a lacklustre lead from Wall St where the mid-term stock rally stalled as focus shifted to the FOMC, which maintained rates as expected and provided little to derail expectations for a 4th hike this year. ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.0%) are lower with energy stocks pressured after a continued slump in oil prices and as soft earnings results also clouds over Tokyo sentiment. Hang Seng (-1.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) have declined in tandem with their regional peers as tech and energy stocks lag, while continued PBoC liquidity inaction and inline inflation data also proved to be inconclusive for sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY holds firm and sits near post-FOMC highs as expectations remain unwavered for a December hike. The greenback had already been strengthening in the hours heading into the Fed&rsquo;s penultimate meeting of 2018, which then persisted following the announcement in which the Fed stated it expects further gradual rate increases will be consistent with sustained economic expansion, while it also suggested a strong view on the economy. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD languish near the prior day&rsquo;s lows, while antipodeans are softer with AUD failing to benefit from the slight upward revisions to growth and CPI forecasts in the RBA&rsquo;s Statement on Monetary Policy, as the central bank also noted a potential impact to the Asia region from the US-China trade dispute. Weakness was also observed in JPY-crosses as the risk averse tone spurs flows into safe-haven JPY, which also dragged USD/JPY back below the 114.00 handle but with losses in the pair stemmed by the recent USD strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with prices uneventful as the pressure from the recent losses in T-notes is counterbalanced by the risk averse tone and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 980bln of JGBs across the curve.</p>\r\n",
