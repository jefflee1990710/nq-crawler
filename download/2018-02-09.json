        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: Stocks bounce-back on Friday",
        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +1.5% at 2620, DJI +1.4% 24192, NDX +1.7% at 6413</strong><br />Top sectors: IT +2.5%, Utilities +2.2%, Healthcare +1.5%<br />Bottom sectors: Energy -0.3%, Cons Stap +0.2%, Cons Disc +0.7%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early trade, sour sentiment and concerns about the valuation of equities extended, lining stocks up for another grim end to the weed. However, in afternoon trade, the DJIA and SPX fell to test their 200d MA, which neither could meaningfully break beneath. The result was an immediate immediately improvement in sentiment and buyers emerged, pushing stocks up to erase losses for the day. The run-in to the close was choppy, however, and gains appeared fragile. The weekly stats, however, still look grim, with the SPX off by over 5% in the week, straddling the 2600 handle as we close out trade. However, Friday&rsquo;s gains have taken at least some of the sting out of the gains, and technical analysts were encouraged by the fact that the 200d MA held its ground when tested. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES:&nbsp;US T-Note futures settle 9 ticks higher at 121-05+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields narrowed along the curve, with Treasuries re-establishing themselves a s a safe-haven amid the stock slide. At settlement, 2s10s were steeper by c.5bps, 2s30s wider by c5bps, 5s30s steeper by c.3bps. Fixed income traders were happy to look through the budget deal reached by US lawmakers, despite the assumption that it will likely see issuance increased, likely weighing on prices. Given the sharp rise seen in bond yields over the last few weeks &ndash; which many have attributed it to better inflation prospects, solid growth, and a Fed which may hike &frac34; times in 2018 &ndash; attention next week will be on US CPI data to assess how widespread inflation pressures are.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY +0.2% on Firday</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dollar heads into the close having put in its best weekly performance in 15-months, reminding us that the buck still has safe-haven properties. Another read might be that the greenback was merely tracking a steepening UST yield curve. On Friday, however, it was supported as lawmakers reached the budget deal. The established havens &ndash; JPY and CHF &ndash; were mixed on Friday, however, with the yen gaining against its US counterpart, eyeing the 108.50 handle, though USDCHF was higher on the day, though capped by 0.94 (EURCHF found a bid despite a weaker EURUSD). The performance of EMFX continues to suggest that the contagion from the stock slide is limited, with the ZAR and MXN making ground against the USD on Friday, though the TRY and BRL didn&rsquo;t fare as well. Gold, meanwhile, is the victim of a steepening curve &ndash; while it generally held its value amid Monday&rsquo;s slide, gains were given up after Tuesday&rsquo;s stabilisation; but even as stocks were under pressure today, gold could not managed to rally above the key $1320 level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle USD 1.95 lower at USD 59.20 per barrel; Brent futures settle USD 2.02 lower at USD 62.79 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benchmarks are set to print the largely weekly falls seen in two years, with WTI slipping beneath $60, extending its slump to six sessions; today&rsquo;s catalyst was the sour risk mood in early trade (and even when risk sentiment improved after stocks successfully bounced off of 200d MA, oil struggled to rally), as well as Ineos ramping up crude supply along the Forties pipeline quicker than was anticipated. Perhaps crude struggled to rally as risk improved due to oil drillers adding 26 rigs in the week pushing the rig count to the highest since Jan 2017.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "The big 4 Canadian banks weigh in on today's labour market report",
        "content": "<p><strong>BMO:</strong> Canadian employment suffered its first setback in 16 months in January, and it was a hefty one. After a banner 2017, employment stumbled with an 88,000 decline to start the year, the largest drop since 2009, and the jobless rate backed up a notch to 5.9% (though still way down from 6.7% a year ago). The details provided few soothing words, as total hours worked fell 0.6%, the job declines were spread across most sectors and provinces, and even the participation rate took a step back (dropping 3 ticks to 65.5%). True, full-time jobs were up by 49,000, but that was swamped by a 137,000 loss of part-time jobs&mdash;the largest monthly drop ever. Our grading of this report would score it at a mere 24.5 (out of 100). There are at least three special factors we can point to in the month as possible drivers, or at least &ldquo;influencers&rdquo;: 1) minimum wage hikes, 2) harsh weather, and 3) the extraordinary strength seen late last year, that was bound to at least partially pull back from at some point. We often caution against reading too much into any one month of Canadian employment data, and that holds for both strong reports and weak results. Today&rsquo;s sour news is at least in part an offset to the unusually strong gains seen late last year, and most likely does not represent the start of new trend. However, it does bring the job market back down to Earth, and reinforces the view that the Bank of Canada will proceed ultra-cautiously through the rest of this year. Even prior to this week&rsquo;s financial market gyrations and this weak jobs data, we were of the view that the Bank would wait until the second half of the year before hiking again &mdash; these developments only embolden that view. At the very least, we can dismiss any chance the Bank hikes in March, and April is now looking more like a long shot as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CIBC: </strong>Observers of Canada&rsquo;s economy are being taken to school on the vagaries of its labour market data, and the lesson is not to take any one month&rsquo;s survey too literally. Rather than signalling the start of an economic downturn, the 88K drop in employment in January simply casts doubt on whether the same survey, which tallied huge job gains in the last two months of 2017, should ever be used as a near term temperature reading on the labour market. Other wonky figures within the January report underscore the noise in the survey and should have us downplaying the significance of its headlines. For one, much of the decline in employment is attributable to a sudden 0.3% decline in the participation rate, a reason why the unemployment rate only edged up one tick. Recessions don&rsquo;t start with people deciding to stay home, they start with companies sending them home. Another reason to see the January data as mostly noise is that it came on the heels of an equally suspect pair of huge job gains in November and December. Average the last three surveys, and we&rsquo;re left with employment growing at a roughly 20,000 monthly pace from October to January, which seems much more reflective of the state of the economy. Remember that given the sample size, the monthly employment change is only accurate to within 59K 19 times in 20. Some will look for evidence that a huge minimum wage hike in Ontario was the driver of the poor labour survey. The fact that Ontario shed more than 50K jobs, all of which were part-time and young, fits that story. But leaning against that theory, all of the employment decline in Canada&rsquo;s largest province came from a decline in labour market participation, with the unemployment rate actually dropping. If anything, juicy minimum wages should cause more people to start looking for work, not fewer. Given the large sampling error associated with one single poll for one region, we will need at least six months of Ontario data to reach any conclusions on how the minimum wage hike has shaped the provincial labour market. Wages are running at 3.3% nationally and did show a sharp pick-up in Ontario as one would expect. Note, however, that the Bank of Canada is now using a measure that combines these data with other wage and compensation data (from the data collected from employers, and that used in the national accounts), and it has been tracking at a slower pace than these labour force survey data of late. Still, we know that pay rates moved up by law in provinces raising the minimum wage, and a tighter labour market should be producing some wage inflation. We hadn&rsquo;t really bought into the jobs gains of late 2017 as a sign the economy was surging. Indeed, we&rsquo;re now tracking only 1.8% annualized GDP growth for Q4. Similarly, there&rsquo;s no reason to rely much on this first monthly employment measure for 2018 as a signal for Q1. Markets&mdash;Markets couldn&rsquo;t make heads nor tails of this hodge-podge of strong wages, good full-time employment and weak part-time employment, and decided in the end to do nothing. A wise call in our view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBC: </strong>Employment plunged 88k in January, bringing an end to an impressive 17-month long streak of gains - the longest such stretch in 17 years &mdash; in what is normally a very volatile measure. The monthly drop in headline employment is eyecatching but still only retraced about 60% of the 146 increase over just the last two months. Other details also weren&rsquo;t as bad as the headline employment drop might suggest. Part-time employment dropped a whopping 137k &mdash; the largest one-month decline on record - but full-time jobs rose 49k. The unemployment rate ticked up to 5.9% but that was still just slightly above the 5.8% in December that matched the lowest reading on record since 1976. The rate is still down almost a percent from a year ago and more than that if sources of &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; unemployment like discouraged workers are included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scotiabank:</strong> This is a weak report across the headline and most details except wage growth that the BoC is likely to look through (see below), but it doesn&rsquo;t change much by way of the broad directions of the labour force. The concentration of the job loss in Ontario and the focus upon lost part-time jobs in that province will no doubt feed debate on whether large minimum wage hikes took a toll on employment but proving causality may remain contentious. It&rsquo;s possible the BoC dismisses most of this report as a transitory adjustment to higher minimum wages. Markets are largely shaking off the report. The C$ initially sold off in the wake of the headlines but has since moved toward being little changed. The Canada two-year yield is down only 1&ndash;2bps post data. Wage growth accelerated to 3.3% y/y using what used to be the BoC&rsquo;s preferred measure for permanent employees. The BoC is likely to look through this print for two reasons. One is that the acceleration from 2.9% y/y the prior month likely reflects the transitory effects of sharply higher minimum wages introduced by Ontario at the start of the new year. There could be more of this effect to come as recognition by respondents to this household survey broadens following the January reference period which is the week including the 15th in any given month, but it should generally shake out of the wage figures once the year-ago rate is re-based next January. Second is that the BoC has recently adopted the wage common measure which is a blend of four wage metrics drawn from: the Labour Force Survey; the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours; quarterly national accounts; and quarterly productivity accounts. In my opinion, the wage common measure understates true wage pressure by directly and indirectly overweighting the lower SEPH wage figure. The wages from the two quarterly sources are drawn from T4 filings when they become available and in the six-quarter lagged period when T4 data isn&rsquo;t available they rely heavily upon SEPH wages. The result in my opinion is an artificially low weight placed upon the wage measure for permanent employees. The SEPH survey also excludes unincorporated businesses which are a big part of Canada&rsquo;s job market. Canada has still created 513,000 jobs since July 2016 after which job growth began to super accelerate. Over the past three months, Canadian jobs are still up by 58,000 jobs for an average three month gain that smooths for volatility equalling a respectable 19,300. Tempted to spin on a dime toward being bearish on Canada in the wake of this jobs print? I wouldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s still the case that a longstanding bearish bias by consensus has seriously underestimated cumulative job growth as elaborated upon in this past week&rsquo;s Global Week Ahead. Out of 513,000 jobs created starting after job growth accelerated following July 2016, consensus has forecast only 91k for a net miss of 422,000 jobs.</p>\r\n",

Cable recoiled from 1.4050+ peaks by the end of &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday to a sub-1.3800 low as the chief negotiator warned that no withdrawal agreement means no transitional period. Eur/Gbp shot up from the low 0.8700 area towards 0.8900 as a result and as Eur/Usd maintained a firmer line between 1.2225-1.2290 parameters. The Jpy and Chf maintained safe-haven gains vs the Usd and other G10 peers as the Wall Street/global equity correction continued (albeit with US stocks showing early signs of ending the week on the bounce). Usd/Jpy was rangebound within a 108.50-109.30 band, and mostly straddling 109.00, but dipped below the big figure again after BoJ Governor Kuroda secured a (rare) 2<sup>nd</sup> term in office. Usd/Cad stuck close to 1.2600 before testing resistance above the 1.2616 100 DMA just before the Canadian employment report, and then shot up to 1.2680 on the shock 88k drop in headline payrolls (vs +10k consensus) and almost as big back data downward revision (to -2.4k from 78.6k). However, the Loonie rebounding sharply on strong wages and as a breakdown revealed that the huge jobs miss was due to part-time workers. Usd/Cad duly reversed to a 1.2560 bas before returning to trade around 1.2600. The Aud and Nzd maintained a weaker tone and underperformance on a mix of disappointing data and dovish RBA/RBNZ policy guidance with Aud/Usd mostly sub-0.7800 until a squeeze above the big figure where a very large option expiry ran off (2.75 bn), and Nzd/Usd only just keeping above 0.7200. The DXY remains on course to continue its 2018 recovery and maintain 90.000+ status despite all the above and more volatile trade. Ahead, Eur/Sek will be eyeing the first Riksbank meet of the year for independent direction/impetus &ndash; see preview below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysts expect the Riksbank will hold rates at -50bps at its meeting next week. However, focus will be on the interest rate path given uncertainties around inflation. &ldquo;The risks to our forecast ahead of next week&#39;s announcement from the Riksbank are strongly tilted towards a downward adjustment of the interest rate path,&rdquo; Nordea writes, arguing that the central bank&rsquo;s inflation forecast is higher than its own, and significantly higher than the forecast of the Swedish National Institute of Research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the outcome of the recent wages data will have been disappointing for the Riskbank, with hourly pay rising only 2.5% Y/Y in the latest data, while the prior month&rsquo;s prints were revised lower. &ldquo;The deviation from the Riksbank&#39;s forecast for 2017 of 2.7% may seem marginal, but the central bank is probably concerned as wage growth doesn&#39;t seem to accelerate,&rdquo; Nordea says, &ldquo;consequently, the outcome for wages should also feed through to the wage forecast for 2018.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nordea, therefore, argues that the Riksbank will lower its inflation forecast, and that will likely have an impact on its rate path for Q3 and Q4, which may be cut to signal a postponement of the first rate hike.</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, the Jpy and Chf are back in favour, while the Gbp in particular is looking very weak again, back below pre-BoE levels and also just breaching &lsquo;strong&rsquo; tech support at 1.3823,and opening up 1.3805 before the next big figure. Note, pretty tough Brexit talk from EU&rsquo;s Barnier weighing on Sterling on top of the broader downturn in sentiment.

        "content": "<p>Equities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fresh sell-off late yesterday saw US equities (DJIA and S&amp;P 500) move into correction territory amid the surge higher in yields in which the US 10yr yield made a high of 2.88%, matching the post NFP high. This also transpired into a sell-off in the Asia-Pac region with Chinese bourses seeing its largest weekly decline in 2yrs, prompting Chinese authorities to announce a CNY 2tln temporary liquidity package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, despite this, losses in Europe have been somewhat contained, European bourses showing a relatively mixed picture (EuroStoxx 50 -0.4%). Sentiment may have been given a slight lift after the Senate passed a 2yr US budget deal to keep the government operating with eyes now on the House to vote on the bill (voting to begin from 0300-0600EST). On a stock specific basis, M&amp;A talk has been doing the rounds with the L&rsquo;Oreal CEO hinting that they may acquire a EUR 23bln stake in Nestle. Umicore shares the best performer following their strong trading update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Jpy is now bouncing further from overnight lows (around 108.50 where decent domestic bids were reported) through 109.00 and offers at 109.20 to a 109.30 peak so far. Similarly, Usd/Chf is firmer up towards 0.9400 vs 0.9350 at one stage and the DXY is deriving some underlying support ahead of the 90.000 level despite Greenback losses against other G10 counterparts. Cable has lost grip of the 1.4000 handle and a degree of its bullish/hawkish BoE impetus, but remains firm ahead of 1.3900, as Eur/Gbp continues to trade below 0.8800 and Eur/Usd is capped by 1.2289 resistance (55 DMA) in front of supply at 1.2300. Usd/Cad is still pivoting around 1.2600 and now awaiting Canadian jobs data amidst the ongoing NAFTA impasse, while Aud/Usd stays on the backfoot after the RBA&rsquo;s dovish SOMP and weaker than forecast mortgage data within a 0.7795-60 range &ndash; 200 DMA at 0.7755 providing support and big 0.7800 option expiry (2.75 bn) also exerting some influence. Nzd/Usd is holding just above 0.7200 in wake of this week&rsquo;s RBNZ meeting, which opened the door to further easing alongside central guidance for tightening in mid-2019, but Usd/Cnh has retreated from its post-capital control related spike highs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixed income</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much net reaction to a very mixed set of UK data initially, but Gilts are now inching up again to retest resistance around the 121.00 handle and just posted a new 121.11 Liffe session high, while Bunds are also on the rebound from a fresh 157.70 Eurex base and marginally extending their topside to 158.12. Core bonds are still caught between an inverse trade-off with equities and the overall bearish trend that was exacerbated by the unexpected strength in US pay growth and has upped the 2018 Fed rate hike ante (alongside a more hawkish shift from other major global CBs of course, bar the BoJ). Heavy sovereign and corp debt supply has also been a factor despite avid investor demand for several offerings in contrast to tepid interest in the US refunding even with concessions. US Treasuries holding mid-range and the curve retaining a steeper profile waiting for the final Wall Street session of the week to see if the correction deepens or Friday provides some scope for consolidation if not a firmer recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures continue to hover near recent lows, however prices have seen a slight pull back amid source reports that the Forties pipeline system is still running at a restricted rate.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, political uncertainty in the US also added to the downbeat tone with the <strong>government officially in a shutdo</strong>wn after Senator Rand Paul blocked to fast track the Senate vote on the 2-year budget deal, other commentators have also paid credence to the continued upside in US yields adding pressure to equities. As such, <strong>ASX 200 (-0.9%)</strong> was weaker with energy names dampened after Brent crude prices fell to a near 2-month low, while losses in the <strong>Nikkei 225 (-2.7%)</strong> were magnified by recent JPY strength. Elsewhere, underperformance in China resumed in which <strong>Hang Seng (-3.7%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp (-5.3%)</strong> slumped as the large cap energy and financials dragged, while the PBoC remained steadfast in its efforts to keep interbank liquidity stable and refrained from open market operations for a 12th day. However, the central bank instead announced it released nearly CNY 2tln in temporary liquidity through the Contingent Reserve Allowance which will allow banks to temporarily utilize deposit reserves to satisfy cash demand ahead of the Lunar New Year. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher on safe-haven bids and with the BoJ also present in the market for JPY 850bln in JGBs across the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skips open market operations, for the 12<sup>th</sup> consecutive day, while it said it released temporary liquidity valued nearly CNY 2tln as it seeks to satisfy cash demand before the Lunar New Year.

However, they too pared some of their recent strength overnight which saw <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> attempt to reclaim the 109.00 handle to the upside. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies were lacklustre amid losses in crude, with <strong>AUD</strong> also weighed after Home Loans data missed expectations and the RBA&rsquo;s Quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy provided a pessimistic tone on inflation.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA Quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy reiterated that appreciating AUD will dampen growth and inflation, while the central bank stated that it will take time to reach full employment and mid-point of inflation target range. Furthermore, the RBA cut its near-term unemployment forecasts, but kept inflation and growth forecasts largely unchanged.

Banxico cited the need to anchor inflation expectations and was also due to expected Fed hikes. The central bank further commented that there was an upward bias in the risks to inflation, and that unfavourable evolution of NAFTA talks pose a risk to price pressures. (Newswires)<br /><br />COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were range-bound overnight in which crude prices languished after Thursday&rsquo;s losses, with <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures firmly below USD 61/bbl and Brent Crude at its lowest in nearly 2 months. Furthermore, some attributed the weakness to supply concerns with US crude output said to top Saudi Arabia, as well as the reopen of the Forties pipeline. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was relatively flat and took a breather from the prior session&rsquo;s safe-haven support, while <strong>copper</strong> remained downbeat alongside the global risk appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to reports, China plans to launch crude oil futures on March 26<sup>th</sup>.

As we entered NY trade, the curve was bear-steepening influenced by a decent slate of corporate supply, as well as some suggesting that the gilt sell-off post-BOE was leading fixed-income price action; but the steepness of the Treasury curve was unwound as equities fell, and havens caught a bid. The US auctioned $16bln in 30-year bonds, tailing by 1.2bps. The internals of the 30-year auction weren&#39;t particularly attractive: cover was softer,&nbsp;foreign takedown appears week (indirects were below recent averages), and dealers took the most since the November auction. The curve began flattening in wake if the auction.&nbsp;There has been nothing from this week&#39;s supply of 3s, 10s and 30s which suggests that there is strong demand for US paper at the higher yields seen as of late, which is demanding caution about the current &lsquo;stabilisation&rsquo; in yields. Elsewhere, the US Treasury announced it will auction $7bln of 30-year TIPS next week.&nbsp;10-Year T-Note Futures settle 3+ ticks lower at 120-28+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&rsquo;s Dudley (voter, soft dove)</strong> said as long as inflation is beneath 2% the Fed can afford to be patient with rate hikes, and that he thinks 3 hikes in 2018 still seems very reasonable but 4 hikes are possible if the economic outlook improves.&nbsp; Dudley also said the US is possibly moving to a path of faster wage growth but noted the FOMC shouldn&rsquo;t put too much faith in one number, while he also said it is unlikely there will be a reason not to hike in March.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade negative across the board with global sentiment lambasted after the return of the market turmoil on Wall St, where the major indices closed in correction territory and the DJIA tumbled over 1000 points on the day. Furthermore, political uncertainty in the US has also added to the downbeat tone with the government on track for a shutdown with Senator Rand Paul blocking to fast track the Senate vote on the 2-year budget and with the next votes at the House not expected till after the midnight funding deadline. As such, ASX 200 (-1.4%) is weaker with energy names dampened after crude prices fell to a 2-month low, while losses in the Nikkei 225 (-3.4%) were magnified by a firmer currency. Elsewhere, underperformance in China resumed with Hang Seng (-4.2%) and Shanghai Comp (-5.5%) slumping as the large cap energy and financials dragged, while the PBoC remained steadfast in its efforts to keep interbank liquidity stable and refrained from open market operations for a 12<sup>th</sup> day. However, the central bank instead announced it released nearly CNY 2tln in temporary liquidity through the Contingent Reserve Allowance which will allow banks to temporarily utilize deposit reserves to satisfy cash demand ahead of the Lunar New Year.<br /><br />In FX markets, price action is relatively muted across the majors which are mostly nursing the prior day&rsquo;s losses against the greenback, aside from safe havens CHF and JPY which were the notable beneficiaries from the stock market rout. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies were lacklustre amid losses in crude, with AUD also weighed after Home Loans data missed expectations and the RBA&rsquo;s Quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy was pessimistic on inflation.<br /><br />Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher on safe-haven bids, while the BoJ are also present in the market for JPY 850bln in JGBs across the curve.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
