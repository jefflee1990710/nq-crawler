        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/20092/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>SNAP-SHOT: Equities mixed, Treasuries down, crude mixed, dollar up.</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>* REAR-VIEW: US President Trump wants USD 200bln in China tariffs despite talks; CBR surprise 25bps rate hike; US Retail Sales miss but revised up; Business Inventories in line; Uni of Mich strong; Fed&rsquo;s Evans upbeat on US economy.</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>AHEAD: BOJ, BCB, SNB, Norges, South African and Hungarian Rate Decisions; RBA and Riksbank Minutes; UK CPI and Retail Sales; EZ CPI Final; US Housing Starts; NY Fed Manufacturing; SNB, Norges Bank and South African Reserve Bank Rate Decisions; Canadian CPI &amp; Retail Sales.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> US President Trump is reportedly said to want USD 200bln in China tariffs and he told advisers to proceed with the duties, despite on-going trade talks. Note the plans came despite Treasury Secretary Mnuchin&#39;s advances made to Bejing. On the NAFTA front, a senior source suggested that Canada is comfortable with missing the October 1st deadline to reach a trade deal with the US and Mexico which was set to speed up negotiations as Mexican negotiators are pushing for an official trilateral agreement to be reached by December 1st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CBR: </strong>The Central Bank of Russia caught the majority of investors cold on Friday with an unexpected 25bps rate hike, taking the key rate to 7.50% from 7.25%. This showed the CBR following the path of the Turkish Central Bank on Super Thursday and therefore keeping up the tightening momentum in the EM space. Moreover, further tightening was mentioned in the policy statement in the context of maintaining positive real interest rates on deposits, which will support the attractiveness of savings and balanced growth in consumption. The CBR also committed to stop buying FX reserves through to the end of 2018, but any action would take into account inflation and economic dynamics. Following the decision, Governor Nabiullina repeated that inflation is moving back towards target faster than expected and will be around 4.2% by the end of the year; she also anticipates current account inflow of USD 30bln by that time. She clarified that the latest rate hike is not necessarily the beginning of a tightening cycle, though did not rule out the possibility of more hikes in the future. Overall, the CBR struck a hawkish tone at the September meeting by not completely ruling out the possibility of more hikes in the future. In summary, Informa notes that some analysts do not believe this is one and done from the Russian Central Bank, but others see no need for the CBR to raise rates again, especially after PM Medvedev&rsquo;s call for lower rates, and with the possibility of further sanctions coming from the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK Brexit Negotiator Raab struck a positive tone over Brexit negotiations following a call with EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator Barnier, as he stated to be closing in on workable solutions to the outstanding issues in Brexit talks. He nonetheless noted there still remain some substantial differences to resolve but he stressed &#39;we reiterated our willingness to devote the necessary time and energy to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion&#39;. The updates from Raab were also backed by Barnier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BoE&#39;s Governor Carney said that the uncertainty around Brexit has an increased dampening effect on pay growth, and that the BoE is prepared for whatever path the economy takes. He also noted that the recent pay data supports the BoE&#39;s August forecast. Also, FT reported that BoE&rsquo;s Carney at last Thursday&rsquo;s UK cabinet briefing told the cabinet that the domestic economy could receive a GBP 16bln lift if PM May was able to negotiate a deal with the EU bases on her Chequers proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> Russian Energy Minister Lavrov said all efforts must be made to preserve the Iran nuclear pact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed&#39;s Evans (Non-Voter, Dove) said to expect inflation to edge up a bit above the 2% target and unemployment to fall to 3.5% by the end of the year. He forecasts at 3% GDP by the end of 2018. On the yield curve, he noted flattening may suggest heightened risk but he believes all the indicators are strong and warned it is too premature to put too much weight on the shape of the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US RETAIL SALES </strong>surprised to the downside in August rising 0.1% and posting below the consensus of 0.4%. Although this reading widely disappointed, the prior reading was upwardly revised to 0.7%. The weakness was attributed to a fall in auto sales which have now been declining for three consecutive months; nonetheless this was partially offset by solid consumer spending which remains on track for Q3. Wells Fargo is confident that, even though the effect of tax cuts will start to fade, spending and consumer will remain solid in the second half of the year and growth will continue to be supported by a strong consumer confidence and well as healthy labour market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US BUSINESS INVENTORIES </strong>rose 0.6% in July, as expected, with stock building widespread across manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. The latest reading indicates that businesses continue to ramp up their inventories amid the strong economic performance. Analysts at Oxford Economics expect &lsquo;businesses to continue running fairly lean inventories through year-end&rsquo; and see them adding 1.2ppts to their Q3 GDP growth which now stands at 3.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* UNI OF MICHGHAN </strong>posted a significant gain in August rising to 100.8 from 96.2 and beating expectations of 96.2. Analysts at Pantheon note &lsquo;expectations is now at a new cycle high&rsquo; suggesting consumers are not worried of the potential effects of tariffs as the economy remains supported by the tax cuts and the strong labour market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION </strong>rose 0.4% in August, a touch above the 0.3% consensus, mostly on the back of a jump in auto production, a bigger than anticipated increase in mining output and utilities. Analysts at Pantheon note &lsquo;oil-well drilling activity has levelled-off, and its contribution to third quarter GDP growth will be nothing like the second quarter&rsquo;s 0.5ppts; it will near-zero.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.01% at&nbsp; 2904, NDX -0.2% at 7546, DJI 0.03% at 26154.</strong> SECTORS: Energy +0.56%, Materials +0.02%, Industrials +0.56%, Cons Discretionary -0.18%, Cons Staples -0.28%, Healthcare -0.38%, Financials +0.40%, Tech 0.00%, Telecoms -0.54%, Utilities -0.52%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FUTURES: </strong>US equity futures were relatively rangebound throughout the early session, however after reports that US President Trump reportedly told advisers to proceed with USD 200bln in China tariffs, the indices were pressured with the ES falling ~9 points from 2909 to 2900 level where it was briefly breached to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*EARNINGS: </strong>Adobe (ADBE) reported earnings AMC Thursday where they beat on both top and bottom line and forecast Q4 EPS &amp; revenue higher than street expectations which saw the stock higher than 2% on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*SPECIFICS:</strong> Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) outperformed during Friday trade due to a positive note from Argus where they raised the PT to USD 40 from USD 23. L Brands (LB) were higher after it announced it is to close all its Henri Bendel stores in January 2019 as it is the right choice for growth. NISource (NI) were on pace for its worst day since 2001 after an explosion at its gas facility which killed at least one person. Finally, Tesla (TSLA) were higher following reports from Electrek that the auto name produced 6700 vehicles over the last week, close to its personal record.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*M&amp;A: </strong>United Tech (UTX) CEO spoke at an investor conference on Friday during hours where he announced he sees the deal with Rockwell Collins (COL) closing this month, and added China is waiting upon US DoJ approval before it makes its decision, but stated progress is going well with China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES 40C HIGHER AT $68.99BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLES 9C LOWER AT $78.09/BBL. </strong>&nbsp;The oil complex was mixed on Friday amid a choppy session, with no major fundamental driving the moves. Analysts at Citi citing profit taking led by the US product markets as hurricane Florence was downgraded to category 1 and seems weaker than expected a few days ago. Brent has retreated below the $80 level to test $78 whilst WTI held just below $69.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count (07 Sep) 867 (Prev. 860)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Gas Rig Count (07 Sep) 186 (Prev. 186)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count (07 Sep) 1055 (Prev. 1048)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES TICKS 8 LOWER AT 119-05+.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The treasury complex edged lower with the 10yr yield hitting the 3% level briefly due to the strong Uni of Mich Sentiment data, which posted above 100, the moves are also attributable to the upward revisions to retail sales. The data was all consistent with markets expectations for two more Fed rate hikes this year. Nonetheless, the yield failed to go above 3% and traded below for the rest of the trading session after the level was hit, acting as key resistance. Yields were by c.3bps at settlement whilst spreads were narrower with the exception of 2s5s which widened by less than 1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> A very late reprieve for a flagging Dollar index and the Greenback overall, as US industrial production broke a run of data misses to lift the DXY back up towards 94.800 vs 94.350 at worst. In truth, the recovery started after a mixed retail sales report with headline prints sub-forecasts, but effectively nullified by upgrades to the previous month, and as US Treasury yields resumed their upward trajectory irrespective of benign PPI and CPI updates earlier in the week. The 10-year benchmark revisited 3%, but for reference the index is still some distance from best levels above 95.500 and largely due to external factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Some major developments and currency moves, with the Lira, Rouble and Rand continuing their revival with the aid of Central Bank policy tightening and less concern about credit standings in the case of the Zar. The Try got a real helping hand from the CBRT and a huge 625 bp hike in the 1-week repo rate, much nearer the top of a wide range of estimates down to no move at all given persistent pressure from Turkish President Erdogan not to raise borrowing costs, which continued and intensified after the Bank went ahead and exerted its independence. In response, the Lira spiked to circa 6.0000 vs the Usd before losing some momentum from 6.5500 lows, while the Rub rallied close to 67.4700 against the Usd at one stage on the back of an unexpected &frac14; point CBR hike in the face of similar Government opposition. For the Zar, Moody&rsquo;s provided traction with a ratings review that lowered the prospect of a downgrade, and the Rand extended its rebound vs the Usd to sub-14.6700 compared to just below 15.3200 at worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* G10: </strong>A contrasting week, but net gains across the board against the Buck still appear highly likely even though the latter may get an extra boost from a 100+ prelim Michigan Sentiment print. The Gbp and Eur both reclaimed a couple of big figures amidst progressively positive Brexit updates, and especially EU Barnier&rsquo;s assertion that a deal within 6-8 weeks is feasible even though both he and the UK&rsquo;s new front-line negotiator, Raab, conceded on Friday that &lsquo;substantive&rsquo; differences remain, and namely the Irish border. Note, BoE and ECB meetings/accompanying statements were largely as expected, but for choice President Draghi was relatively more upbeat than Governor Carney who stressed Brexit no deal risks for the UK economy. Cable has drifted back from around 1.3140 highs to sub-1.3100, but was just shy of 1.2900 at the other end of the spectrum, while Eur/Usd hit 1.1720 at best vs circa 200 pips lower at the bottom of the week&rsquo;s range. The Aud and Nzd have been embroiled in another tussle, with the cross choppy around 1.0900 and Aud/Usd veering between 0.7230-0.7080 and currently around 0.7175 with some underlying support from upbeat Aussie jobs data, but the upside capped by ongoing US-China trade issues even though the 2 nations are planning to resume dialogue. The Kiwi has been in approx. 0.6600-0.6500 parameters, but did derive some traction from a pick-up in NZ manufacturing PMI. Trade, or NAFTA to be precise, also drove Loonie sentiment for the most part, and overall the news was positive with deal prospects facilitated by reports that Canada may be open to giving the US some dairy access. Hence, Usd/Cad now close to the base around 1.3040 vs 1.2970 and almost 1.3200 at the peak. The Nok has clearly outperformed its Scandi counterpart on data/surveys justifying the bigger lead time from Norges Bank tightening vs Riksbank, like Norwegian GDP and Swedish inflation. The safe-haven Jpy and Chf are both ending Friday softer vs the Usd, but the former is also down on the week around 112+ vs 110.85 at one stage, with less risk aversion on balance and higher US Treasury yield impacting, while the Franc is still relatively firm circa 0.9660 and through 1.1300 vs the Eur, prompting SNB head Jordan to express his wish to see other Central Banks tighten monetary policy and implying another dovish quarterly review in Switzerland next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monday: Eurozone CPI Tuesday: N/A Wednesday: BoJ Interest Rate Decision, UK CPI, New Zealand GDP Thursday: SNB Interest Rate Decision, Norges Bank Interest Rate Decision, EU leaders expected to discuss Brexit Friday: Japan CPI, Eurozone Markit Manufacturing, Services and Composite PMIs (Flash), Canada CPI Sunday: JMMC meeting in Algeria.<a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20086/download\"> For the full RANsquawk Week In Focus report click here.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* ECB: Markets snooze with ECB on auto-pilot</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* BOE: Brexit ties the hands of the MPC after Aug hike</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* CBRT: CBRT blockbuster hike angers Erdogan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* FED: CPI unlikely to cancel plans for 4 hikes in 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* RBA: Mins likely to downplay hikes to mortgage rates</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* CBR: Defies calls for a cut and surprises with a hike</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* SNB: Focus on SNB assessment of CHF strength</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* NORGES: 25bps of tightening due on Thursday</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* BOJ: Focus on debate around forward guidance</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20090/download\">For the full RANsquawk Central Bank Weekly Report click here.</a></p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: bold CBRT action the main attraction, but not the only one",
        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very late reprieve for a flagging Dollar index and the Greenback overall, as US industrial production broke a run of data misses to lift the DXY back up towards 94.800 vs 94.350 at worst. In truth, the recovery started after a mixed retail sales report with headline prints sub-forecasts, but effectively nullified by upgrades to the previous month, and as US Treasury yields resumed their upward trajectory irrespective of benign PPI and CPI updates earlier in the week. The 10 year benchmark revisited 3%, but for reference the index is still some distance from best levels above 95.500 and largely due to external factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some major developments and currency moves, with the Lira, Rouble and Rand continuing their revival with the aid of Central Bank policy tightening and less concern about credit standings in the case of the Zar. The Try got a real helping hand from the CBRT and a huge 625 bp hike in the 1 week repo rate, much nearer the top of a wide range of estimates down to no move at all given persistent pressure from Turkish President Erdogan not to raise borrowing costs, which continued and intensified after the Bank went ahead and exerted its independence. In response, the Lira spiked to circa 6.0000 vs the Usd before losing some momentum from 6.5500 lows, while the Rub rallied close to 67.4700 against the Usd at one stage on the back of an unexpected &frac14; point CBR hike in the face of similar Government opposition. For the Zar, Moody&rsquo;s provided traction with a ratings review that lowered the prospect of a downgrade, and the Rand extended its rebound vs the Usd to sub-14.6700 compared to just below 15.3200 at worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G10</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contrasting week, but net gains across the board against the Buck still appear highly likely even though the latter may get an extra boost from a 100+ prelim Michigan Sentiment print. The Gbp and Eur both reclaimed a couple of big figures amidst progressively positive Brexit updates, and especially EU Barnier&rsquo;s assertion that a deal within 6-8 weeks is feasible even though both he and the UK&rsquo;s new front-line negotiator, Raab, conceded on Friday that &lsquo;substantive&rsquo; differences remain, and namely the Irish border. Note, BoE and ECB meetings/accompanying statements were largely as expected, but for choice President Draghi was relatively more upbeat than Governor Carney who stressed Brexit no deal risks for the UK economy. Cable has drifted back from around 1.3140 highs to sub-1.3100, but was just shy of 1.2900 at the other end of the spectrum, while Eur/Usd hit 1.1720 at best vs circa 200 pips lower at the bottom of the week&rsquo;s range. The Aud and Nzd have been embroiled in another tussle, with the cross choppy around 1.0900 and Aud/Usd veering between 0.7230-0.7080 and currently around 0.7175 with some underlying support from upbeat Aussie jobs data, but the upside capped by ongoing US-China trade issues even though the 2 nations are planning to resume dialogue. The Kiwi has been in approx. 0.6600-0.6500 parameters, but did derive some traction from a pick-up in NZ manufacturing PMI. Trade, or NAFTA to be precise, also drove Loonie sentiment for the most part, and overall the news was positive with deal prospects facilitated by reports that Canada may be open to giving the US some dairy access. Hence, Usd/Cad now close to the base around 1.3040 vs 1.2970 and almost 1.3200 at the peak. The Nok has clearly outperformed its Scandi counterpart on data/surveys justifying the bigger lead time from Norges Bank tightening vs Riksbank, like Norwegian GDP and Swedish inflation. The safe-haven Jpy and Chf are both ending Friday softer vs the Usd, but the former is also down on the week around 112+ vs 110.85 at one stage, with less risk aversion on balance and higher US Treasury yield impacting, while the Franc is still relatively firm circa 0.9660 and through 1.1300 vs the Eur, prompting SNB head Jordan to express his wish to see other Central Banks tighten monetary policy and implying another dovish quarterly review in Switzerland next week.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) were higher in which miners led the broad gains in Australia, while Japanese exporters benefitted from a weaker currency which lifted the benchmark index to above the 23,000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were both initially positive after continued liquidity efforts by the PBoC, although sentiment in the mainland eventually waned as amid weakness in Shenzhen and as participants digested mixed data in which Industrial Production printed in-line with expectations and Retail Sales beat, while Fixed Assets Investments growth declined to a fresh multi-year low. In addition, recent Trump comments also spurred some apprehension after he commented the US are under no pressure to make a deal with China and that it is China which is pressured to reach an agreement. Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful with demand for safe-havens dampened by the positive risk appetite in Japan, but with downside also capped amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 700bln of maturities in the short-end to belly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 110bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 40bln via 14-day reverse repos for a weekly net injection of CNY 330bln vs. Prev. neutral position last week.

The DAX is leading the way in the equities space, driven by Infineon, who are benefitting from broad-based IT sector strength after yesterday&rsquo;s outperformance in the US. The SMI is currently the laggard and weighed on by Roche&rsquo;s announcement of a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; sales growth in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK homebuilders are struggling after comments from BoE&rsquo;s Carney stating that UK home prices could fall by over 35% if there is a &ldquo;no-deal&rdquo; Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investec announced the demerger of their asset management business, and are currently leading the gains in the Stoxx 600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Another downturn in the index and for the Greenback overall, partly on a further reflection post-benign US CPI, but also or perhaps mainly due to relative strength in rival currencies. The DXY remains below 94.500 and not far from recent lows, with more data on the horizon via retail sales, ip and business inventories before preliminary Michigan sentiment for September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G10 - All majors are ahead vs the Usd, bar the Loonie that continues to trade around the 1.3000 handle awaiting more NAFTA news. The Kiwi has overtaken its Aussie peer with some independent impetus overnight from firmer NZ manufacturing PMI growth to extend gains towards 0.6600, while Aud/Usd continues to look heavy above 0.7200.

The DAX is leading the way in the equities space, driven by Infineon, who are benefitting from broad-based IT sector strength after yesterday&rsquo;s outperformance in the US.

The DXY remains below 94.500 and not far from recent lows, with more data on the horizon via retail sales, ip and business inventories before preliminary Michigan sentiment for September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G10 - All majors are ahead vs the Usd, bar the Loonie that continues to trade around the 1.3000 handle awaiting more NAFTA news. The Kiwi has overtaken its Aussie peer with some independent impetus overnight from firmer NZ manufacturing PMI growth to extend gains towards 0.6600, while Aud/Usd continues to look heavy above 0.7200.

        "content": "<p>Russia&#39;s central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged at 7.25% at the conclusion of its meeting on Friday. The meeting comes amid political pressure that is seemingly being placed on the central bank; Russian PM Medvedev this week demanded that the central bank cut rates amid the turmoil in EM, a call that analysts at Commerzbank describe as &quot;dangerous sliding tackle,&quot; and drew comparisons with Turkey (whose President Erdogan notably called for lower rates, which may have contributed to the EMFX crisis, but definitely contributed to the TRY crisis). The central bank governor Nabiullina leaned against Medvedev&#39;s comments, however, stating that there were more factors for keeping rates unchanged rather than cutting; she also noted that there were key factors for raising the key rate, although she did not want to get further drawn into comments ahead of the rate meeting. &quot;The fact that the governor of Bank Rossii Elvira Nabiullina immediately spoke up and confirmed her hawkish approach in a speech prevented anything worse form happening,&quot; Commerzbank writes. &quot;In a worst case scenario this could mean that the rouble gets into a TRY-like downward spiral. In the best case scenario the central bank now has to take strong counter-measures to prevent this from happening - with higher interest rates that put more pressure on the Russian economy than would have been necessary without Medvedev&rsquo;s comments.&quot;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another downturn in the index and for the Greenback overall, partly on a further reflection post-benign US CPI, but also or perhaps mainly due to relative strength in rival currencies. The DXY remains below 94.500 and not far from recent lows, with more data on the horizon via retail sales, ip and business inventories before preliminary Michigan sentiment for September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G10</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All majors are ahead vs the Usd, bar the Loonie that continues to trade around the 1.3000 handle awaiting more NAFTA news. The Kiwi has overtaken its Aussie peer with some independent impetus overnight from firmer NZ manufacturing PMI growth to extend gains towards 0.6600, while Aud/Usd continues to look heavy above 0.7200 and hampered by option expiry interest with 1.6 bn rolling off between the big figure and 0.7190. Elsewhere, Cable and Eur/Usd appear more comfortable on 1.3100 and 1.1700 handles respectively, amidst largely positive Brexit vibes at the UK-EU level if not on the domestic front, with the former eyeing 1.3150 and latter filling a chunk of bids/stops at 1.1715 before fading ahead of the 1.1734 August peak and strong chart resistance at 1.1750. Usd/Jpy continues to trade against the broad trend, but has retreated from 112.00+ highs to sub-111.88 Fib levels again, as 112.15 technical resistance held firm, while Usd/Chf has fallen further from 0.9700 and through 0.9650 even though SNB head Jordan uttered some words of loose intervention via an expression of desire to see other Central Banks tighten policy. Turning to Scandinavia, more Sek underperformance post-softer than consensus Swedish inflation data with Eur/Sek up to 10.5400+ at one stage vs 10.4640 or so at the low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try back in focus with another attempt to probe post-CBRT peaks around 6.0000 vs the Usd thwarted by more rhetoric from Turkish President Erdogan aimed at the US again, but also reiterating his stern opposition to higher rates. The Lira duly weakened in response, as has become an all too familiar pattern, but is off worst levels with some tangible support from data showing a narrower than forecast current account deficit. Elsewhere, the Rub is hedging bets around 68.4700 vs the Usd ahead of the CBR policy decision that is widely expected to be a &lsquo;hawkish hold&rsquo;.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) were higher in which miners led the broad gains in Australia, while Japanese exporters benefitted from a weaker currency which lifted the benchmark index to above the 23,000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were both initially positive after continued liquidity efforts by the PBoC, although sentiment in the mainland eventually waned as amid weakness in Shenzhen and as participants digested mixed data in which Industrial Production printed in-line with expectations and Retail Sales beat, while Fixed Assets Investments growth declined to a fresh multi-year low. In addition, recent Trump comments also spurred some apprehension after he commented the US are under no pressure to make a deal with China and that it is China which is pressured to reach an agreement.

(Times/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Minister Raab said there has to be a shift across the board for the EU&#39;s approach to Northern Ireland and in the event of a no deal Britain would pay not a penny more than its legal obligations, although he also commented that EU and UK is making progress every time they meet for negotiations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&rsquo;s former policy adviser, Freeman, states that May should stand down after a Brexit deal has been secured. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian Deputy Finance Minister Castelli states that the nation&rsquo;s citizen&rsquo;s income will commence on Jan 1st 2019 and will be a minimum of EUR 780mln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remained subdued near the 94.50 level after the CPI-triggered losses which benefitted its counterparts across the pond with EUR/USD eyeing 1.1700 to the upside and with GBP/USD at the 1.3100 handle. Elsewhere, AUD/USD was indecisive following the mixed Chinese data and Trump&rsquo;s comments, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were higher on safe-haven outflows which lifted the pair briefly above the 112.00 level. Elsewhere, TRY held on to recent strength which inspired a relatively calm tone in EM currencies after the CBRT defied President Erdogan&rsquo;s wishes for lower rates and hiked by 625bps the prior day.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were uneventful with mild gains seen overnight, although WTI crude remained below USD 69.00/bbl following the prior day&rsquo;s 2.6% decline which analyst attributed to concerns emerging market tensions and trade wars could weigh on demand. Elsewhere, gold marginally higher amid a subdued greenback while copper also mirrored the modest upside seen across the complex but with price action capped by underperformance in mainland China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Energy Secretary Perry said Saudi Arabia, OPEC and Russia &#39;would be admired&#39; if no oil price rises are seen following Iran sanctions, while he also said that Nord Stream 2 sanctions are possible but is optimistic on future talks with Russia. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia Energy Minister Novak said we have discussed all energy related topics with US Energy Secretary Perry and can find things in common, while he also stated they agreed to restore dialogue with Perry but is concerned over possible sanctions on Nord Stream 2.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury curve modestly flattened on Thursday, after a weak CPI report (which followed a soft PPI report earlier in the week). Yields on 2s and 3s hit fresh decade highs in the session. At settlement, most curve spreads were under 1bps lower. The US sold $15bln of 30-year bonds at 3.088%, coming in on the screws, though the yield was 0.2bps lower than the previous auction cycle. Cover was above the previous auction, but in line with recent averages. Indirect takedown was encouraging, as was dealer participation was notably lower than recent averages. US T-note futures (Z8) settled half-a-tick lower at 119-13+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bostic (Voter, Dove) said rate increases can continue for a handful of quarters and is still worried that trade risks will mar investment plans although noted that the effect has been limited so far. Bostic added will evaluate data before deciding on fourth hike and that there is uncertainty whether US is at full employment, while he also commented the Fed can be patient with hikes if there is no risk of the economy overheating and that it is possible that neutral rate has moved higher. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (Non-voter. Dove) reiterated the Fed should be proceed to neutral rate which is seen between 2.50%-2.75%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump told donors he plans to re-brand NAFTA as USMC agreement but may drop C if Canada doesn&#39;t agree to his changes. (WSJ) In related news, Mexico NAFTA negotiator Smith Ramos said it is ideal to keep NAFTA trilateral, but they remain prepared to proceed with a bilateral deal with US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House and Senate reportedly reached a tentative agreement to fund government through December 7th. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Trump campaign manager Manafort was reported to have agreed a plea deal with Special Counsel Mueller although reports noted it was unclear if he is agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors or is conceding to a guilty plea, while sources later stated that a Manafort plea deal with Special Counsel Mueller is close but not there yet.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher as the region takes impetus from the gains in US where the S&amp;P 500 notched a 4th consecutive gain and the Nasdaq outperformed as tech rebounded with a vengeance. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) are higher with miners leading the broad gains in Australia, while Japanese exporters benefit from a weaker currency which lifted the benchmark index to above the 23,000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) were both initially positive after continued liquidity efforts by the PBoC, although sentiment in the mainland eventually waned as participants digested mixed data in which Industrial Production printed inline with expectations and Retail Sales beat, while Fixed Assets Investments growth declined to a fresh multi-year low. In addition, recent Trump comments also spurred some apprehension after he commented the US are under no pressure to make a deal with China and that it is China which is pressured to reach an agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remains subdued near the 94.50 level after the recent CPI-triggered losses which benefits its counterparts across the pond with EUR/USD eyeing 1.1700 to the upside and with GBP/USD at the 1.3100 handle. Elsewhere, AUD/USD is indecisive following the mixed Chinese data and Trump&rsquo;s comments, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are higher on safe-haven outflows which lifted the pair briefly above the 112.00 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful with safe-haven demand dampened by the positive risk appetite in Japan, but with downside also capped amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 700bln of maturities in the short-end to belly.</p>\r\n",
