Furthermore, US President Trump is said to have spoken with Mexico&#39;s election winner AMLO about border security, NAFTA, trade and possibly a separate trade deal with Mexico. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexican President-elect Obrador said he spoke on the phone with US President Trump for half an hour and that talks included a comprehensive deal on job-creating development projects to reduce migration and strengthen security.

Focus on Monday was on Dell technologies (DVMT) (class v stock of Dell) and VM Ware (VMW). Dell is to become a public traded company once again, by purchasing its own tracking stock of VM Ware, Dell Technologies, by offering 1.3665 shares of its Class C dell stock or an optional cash election. VM Ware will pay a USD 11bln dividend to DVMT holders as part of the deal announcement, dependent upon satisfaction of the deal. This reportedly removes the chance of a reverse merger for VM Ware (VMW), but sources over the weekend who knew about the matter, suggested Dell may pursue a merger with VM Ware down the line. Also, VM Ware would own between 20.8% to 31% of Dell after the deal, depending how many investors choose the cash option. Elsewhere, Casino names such as Wynn Resorts (WYNN) hampered the SPX on Monday following lower than expected casino revenue from Macau, which also hit Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Melco (MLCO). SPX +0.3%, NASDAQ COMP +0.7%, DJIA +0.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were lower on Monday, breaking their inverse relationship with equities, which also remained in negative territory for most of the the session. The yield curve bear-flattened with most of the selling action concentrated in the front end of the curve where 2yr and 5yr yields were higher by c.2bps, though action and volume was thin ahead of the US holiday this week. 2s10s and 2s30 narrowed by less than 2bps. US 10YR T-notes futures (Sep 2018) 3+ ticks lower at 120-02+.</p>\r\n",

He also said to have spoken about order security, NAFTA, trade and possibly a separate trade deal with Mexico in a phone call with Mexico&#39;s presidential elections winner Lopez Obrador. Separately, Trump announced if the WTO does not treat the US properly the nation will be doing something, although refrained from saying that the US would leave the organisation. Earlier in the day US Commerce Secretary Ross said it is too early to talk about leaving the WTO, adding that the stock market level will not change policy. Focus this week turns to the US $34 billion worth of tariffs to be imposed on Chinese imports, effective from July 6th , as well as the retaliatory response from China which is set to levy an extra 25% tariff on American auto imports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Some senior US President Trump officials are hoping the President may hold a round-table talk with Kim Jong Un in September in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GERMAN GOVERNMENT CRISIS: </strong>Bild reported the German CDU was apparently close to a deal with the CSU on the migrant crisis, at a meeting taking place Monday evening between Germany&#39;s CDU and CSU, aimed at solving disagreements over the issue. This comes in the context of Germany Interior Minister and CSU party leader Seehofer making a resignation offer following disagreements over the weekend with Chancellor Merkel on the deal that was negotiated at the EU summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier on Monday, leader Seehofer dismissed his resignation offer and was said to remain in politics if Chancellor Merkel&#39;s CDU party was to back down regarding migration, while he also said he wants to avoid the collapse of Merkel&#39;s government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note the resignation of Interior Minister Seehofer would pose a serious threat to the CDU/CSU coalition; a break up of the alliance would weaken Germany&rsquo;s Merkel position as she would remain Chancellor of a minority government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The BBC reported that Downing Street has produced a third model for handling customs after the UK leaves the EU. &nbsp;Specific details of the new plan have not been revealed publicly though a senior UK minister noted &quot;I think it&#39;ll be a hybrid, complex fudge specifically tailored for a different regime for goods and services&quot;. Senior ministers will discuss the new customs option at Chequers, the PM&#39;s country retreat, on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* MEXICO&rsquo;S ELECTIONS: </strong>Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won a decisive victory in the Presidential election, as expected, &nbsp;with quick count results showing he received 53.0%-53.8% of votes. The new leader Lopez Obrador said he will have a frank dialogue with the US and seek a friendly relationship, adding he will continue NAFTA negotiations with the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE SPEAK: </strong>BoE&rsquo;s Haldane said it is important to push inflation back to 2% target and not wait too long. Note he dissented at the last BoE meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: </strong>The US ISM Manufacturing PMI for June came in at 60.2, beating expectations at 58.4. The components slightly missed expectations, though they remained solid and provide support for Q2 economic growth above 4%. Prices Paid continue to signal increases in input prices for manufacturing firms, New Orders support further business investment and Employment remains robust; analysts at Wells Fargo say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.3%, NASDAQ COMP &nbsp;+0.7%, DJI &nbsp;+0.2%</strong>. SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -0.2%, Cons Non-Cyclicals:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-0.7%, Energy: -1.5%, Financials: +0.3%, Health Care:&nbsp; &nbsp;+0.1%, Industrials: 0.0%, Materials: -0.6%, Telecoms: 0.0%, Tech: +0.7%, Utilities: +0.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Futures: </strong>US Equity futures traded lower overnight where the Emini500 found support ahead of the psychological level 2700, before paring back some of the earlier losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Stock Specifics:</strong> Focus on Monday was on Dell technologies (DVMT) (class v stock of Dell) and VM Ware (VMW). Dell is to become a public traded company once again, by purchasing its own tracking stock of VM Ware, Dell Technologies, by offering 1.3665 shares of its Class C dell stock or an optional cash election. VM Ware will pay a USD 11bln dividend to DVMT holders as part of the deal announcement, dependent upon satisfaction of the deal. This reportedly removes the chance of a reverse merger for VM Ware (VMW), but sources over the weekend who knew about the matter, suggested Dell may pursue a merger with VM Ware down the line. Also, VM Ware would own between 20.8% to 31% of Dell after the deal, depending how many investors choose the cash option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Casino names such as Wynn Resorts (WYNN) hampered the SPX on Monday following lower than expected casino revenue from Macau, which also hit Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Melco (MLCO).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) 3+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-02+.</strong> Treasuries were lower on Monday, breaking their inverse relationship with equities, which also remained in negative territory for most of the the session. The yield curve bear-flattened with most of the selling action concentrated in the front end of the curve where 2yr and 5yr yields were higher by c.2bps, though action and volume was thin ahead of the US holiday this week. 2s10s and 2s30 narrowed by less than 2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q8) SETTLE &nbsp;$0.21 LOWER AT $73.94/BBL; BRENT (Q8) FUTURES SETTLE $1.93 LOWER AT $77.30/BBL.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent rally of oil seems to have ran out of steam with losses limited in WTI, and Brent down more than 1%. Over the weekend US President Trump tweeted that he asked Saudi King Salman to increase output by as much as 2mln BPD, however the White House stated that the Saudis could increase the output if required, and that there was not an actual agreement to do so.&nbsp; In the early morning we saw Russia&rsquo;s output for June increase to 11.063mln BPD, 100kBPD increase (1.1%) and 0.8% increase m/m, however its exports did fall by 1.3% m/m. In other news the NOC confirmed source reports on Friday that a Force Majeure has been declared today on its Zueitina and Hariga oil ports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;* USD: </strong>A solid start to July/Q3/H2 for the Greenback with broad gains made vs major and EM rivals amidst ongoing global trade/import tariff wars, plus political factors weighing on certain currencies, like the EUR, GBP and MXN. The index reclaimed 95.000+ status, as EURUSD retreated to just above 1.1600 having breached chart support (10 DMA circa 1.1623) ahead of a crisis meeting between Germany&rsquo;s 3 grand coalition parties to try and iron out migration policy differences. Big option expiry interest between 1.1590-1.1600 (1.25 bn) stemmed the decline into the NY cut, while Cable also held within a cluster of expiries from 1.3095-1.3130 (1.1 bn) after failing to derive lasting support from a firmer than forecast UK manufacturing PMI. The Peso got an initial boost from news that AMLO secured a comfortable, if not resounding election victory to trade as high as 19.6455 vs the USD, but also succumbed to overall Dollar strength even though the new leader attempted to quell concerns about fiscal laxity. USDMXN currently back up over 20.0000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> Extended losses vs their US counterpart and exchanged places at the foot of the G10 table over the course of Monday&rsquo;s session as AUDUSD held just above ytd lows ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s RBA policy meeting, but NZDUSD edged closer to 0.6700 and the cross inched up to test 1.0950. The Kiwi may have been wary about another weak GDT auction result tomorrow after declines in prices of late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, CHF: </strong>Also losing out to widespread USD strength (helped by upbeat manufacturing PMI and ISM headline prints), with the Loonie just above 1.3200 and Franc down under 0.9950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Relatively resilient vs the USD and rangebound having recovered from 111.00+ lows to meander from 110.50-90, with the JPY seeing some demand on safe-haven positioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* YUAN:</strong> The CNY and CNH fell further in wake of another firm PBoC midpoint fix and weaker than expected Chinese official and Caixin manuf PMIs, with the offshore unit testing multi-year lows vs the USD around 6.6900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RBA Interest Rate Decision due at 0530BST/2330CDT. </strong>The RBA is expected to maintain the Cash Rate Target at the record low 1.50%. Expectations for the RBA to remain on hold for a prolonged period are largely due to subdued wage growth and inflation remaining below the central banks 2%-3% target band. The data points since the last meeting have been mixed with GDP growth for Q1 firmer than expected whilst jobs data has been less encouraging. For the full preview click here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Riksbank Interest Rate Decision Due Tuesday due at 0830BST/0230CDT. </strong>Analysts unanimously expect the Riksbank to keep rates unchanged at -0.50%. Housing market slowdown poses some downside risk for GDP. Core inflation has become the focus, with this painting a subdued picture. For the full preview click here.</p>\r\n",

Over the weekend US President Trump tweeted that he asked Saudi King Salman to increase output by as much as 2mln BPD, however the White House stated that the Saudis could increase the output if required, and that there was not an actual agreement to do so.&nbsp; In the early morning we saw Russia&rsquo;s output for June increase to 11.063mln BPD, 100kBPD increase (1.1%) and 0.8% increase m/m, however its exports did fall by 1.3% m/m. In other news the NOC confirmed source reports on Friday that a Force Majeure has been declared today on its Zueitina and Hariga oil ports.</p>\r\n",

The index reclaimed 95.000+ status, as Eur/Usd retreated to just under 1.1600 having breached chart support (10 DMA circa 1.1623) ahead of a crisis meeting between Germany&rsquo;s 3 grand coalition parties to try and iron out migration policy differences. Big option expiry interest between 1.1590-1.1600 (1.25 bn) stemmed the decline into the NY cut, while Cable also held within a cluster of expiries from 1.3095-1.3100 (1.1 bn) after failing to derive lasting support from a firmer than forecast UK manufacturing PMI. The Peso got an initial boost from news that AMLO secured a comfortable, if not resounding election victory to trade as high as 19.6455 vs the Usd, but also succumbed to overall Dollar strength even though the new leader attempted to quell concerns about fiscal laxity. Usd/Mxn currently back up over 20.1000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extended losses vs their US counterpart and exchanged places at the foot of the G10 table over the course of Monday&rsquo;s session as Aud/Usd held just above ytd lows ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s RBA policy meeting, but Nzd/Usd edged closer to 0.6700 and the cross inched up to test 1.0950. The Kiwi may have been wary about another weak GDT auction result tomorrow after declines in prices of late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also losing out to widespread Usd strength (helped by upbeat manufacturing PMI and ISM headline prints), with the Loonie back below 1.3200 and Franc down under 0.9950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatively resilient vs the Usd and rangebound having recovered from 111.00+ lows to meander from 110.50-90, with the Jpy seeing some demand on safe-haven positioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YUAN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cny and Cnh fell further in wake of another firm PBoC midpoint fix and weaker than expected Chinese official and Caixin manuf PMIs, with the offshore unit testing multi-year lows vs the Usd around 6.6900.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-2.2%) were lacklustre although strength in Property and Healthcare sectors kept Australia afloat for most the session, while Japan was dampened following mixed Tankan data but with a weaker JPY intiially limiting the downside.

Over the weekend, German Interior Minister Seehofer rejected Chancellor Merkel&rsquo;s deal with the EU on migration whilst also threatening to resign. Trade war woes continue to linger after the EU threatened to impose new retaliatory tariffs worth USD 300bln if the US continues with the EU auto tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financials and industrials underperform amid the uncertainty surrounding the potential fall of the German government (Interior Minister Seehofer is to meet Chancellor Merkel today) and the fall of base metals. Energy names take a hit following the recent decline in oil prices. In terms of stocks specifics, Microfocus (+5.1%) shares were lifted following reports they&rsquo;re to sell their SUSE business to EQT partners for USD 2.4bln. Vedanta (+26.8%) shares spiked higher after Volcan approached the company with a buyout offer. Meanwhile, Playtech (-29.3%) shares slumped after the company lowered their guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has been under pressure in early EU trade, as 1.1700 held firm vs the Usd amidst reports of decent selling against vs the JPY after the cross breached 129.00 to the downside, from 128.95 to 125.80. Meanwhile, a prominent US bank has also implemented a short Eur position on unstable German political grounds and despite the prospect of SNB intervention via the CHF around 1.1550, targeting 1.1200 with a 1.1660 stop. Back to the headline pair, 1.1623 represents 10 DMA support just below the base so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - Although the Dollar has retreated from best levels vs several major counterparts the DXY remains underpinned above 94.500 with Usd/Jpy holding midway between 110.50-111.05 and the Greenback broadly firmer across the board. Sub-forecast Chinese PMIs suggest that trade wars may hit the world&rsquo;s 2nd largest economy more than the US, and the YUAN continues to weaken in response if not by design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - Among the G10 underperformers on the latest downturn in overall risk sentiment, and with the Aud also undermined by a slower PMI print and decline in job ads overnight, as it slips further below 0.7400 vs its US peer and pivots 1.0900 against the Kiwi that is striving to keep its head above 0.6750 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Fleeting respite and some welcome relief from the latest negative Brexit reports for the Pound as the UK manufacturing PMI beat expectations to remain relatively steady and comfortably above the 50.0 threshold. Cable has ticked up from sub-1.3150 levels, while Eur/Gbp has drifted down below 0.8850, albeit with the aid of aforementioned single currency weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF - The Loonie and Franc are both relatively rangebound, but softer vs the Dollar on tariff factors, a softer Swiss manufacturing PMI and fall in retail sales. Usd/Cad is hovering in a 1.3140-90 range and Usd/Chf between 0.9900-30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MXN - Off recent peaks vs the Usd, but with the Peso still holding above 20.000 in wake of the election and convincing win for AMLO</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities trade lower with WTI (-0.4%) and Brent (-0.9%) pressured as markets react to a tweet from US President Trump over the weekend that he spoke with Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s King Salman on raising production maybe by as much as 2mln barrels and that prices were too high which the Saudi ruler agreed with. However, the White House were quick on clarifying that Saudi Arabia stated they could raise output if required and that there was no actual agreement to raising output by the said amount. In regards to this, Iran&rsquo;s OPEC Governor Ardebili said on Saturday &ldquo;there is no way one country could go 2mln BPD above their production allocation unless they are walking out of OPEC&rdquo;. An Iranian official later stated that adjustments to the OPEC output levels would require an emergency meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amongst the weekend comments, Saudi crude output reached a near-record 10.7mln BPD according to a survey while Russian June output reached over 11mln BPD according to the oil ministry. Libya&rsquo;s NOC declared a force majeure at Hariga and Zeutina ports while weekend reports suggested around 850K BPD may be offline in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (-0.3%) is subdued by a slightly firmer dollar as the yellow metal continues to be detached from the risk sentiments. Chinese iron ore futures fell almost 2% on Monday, due to a&nbsp; fresh increase in iron ore stocks at China&rsquo;s ports, after a hat trick of positive closes last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note, Canadian tariffs came into play on Sunday, where a 25% levy imposed largely targeting US steel and aluminium products as well as a 10% tariff on over 250 other US goods (such as beer kegs, whisky, and orange juice).</p>\r\n",

Hence, a recoil and a degree of underperformance to a 162.42 low vs its UK equivalent that held parity at 123.06 even though the UK release came in above consensus. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are even more resilient after last week&rsquo;s heavy supply and the curve is flatter yet again ahead of Markit PMI, ISM and construction spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities trade lower with WTI (-0.7%) and Brent (-1.0%) pressured as markets react to a tweet from US President Trump over the weekend that he spoke with Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s King Salman on raising production maybe by as much as 2mln barrels and that prices were too high which the Saudi ruler agreed with. However, the White House were quick on clarifying that Saudi Arabia stated they could raise output if required and that there was no actual agreement to raising output by the said amount. In regards to this, Iran&rsquo;s OPEC Governor Ardebili said on Saturday &ldquo;there is no way one country could go 2mln BPD above their production allocation unless they are walking out of OPEC&rdquo;. An Iranian official later stated that adjustments to the OPEC output levels would require an emergency meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amongst the weekend comments, Saudi crude output reached a near-record 10.7mln BPD according to a survey while Russian June output reached over 11mln BPD according to the oil ministry. Libya&rsquo;s NOC declared a force majeure at Hariga and Zeutina ports while weekend reports suggested around 850K BPD may be offline in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (-0.3%) is subdued by a slightly firmer dollar as the yellow metal continues to be detached from the risk sentiments. Chinese iron ore futures fell almost 2% on Monday, due to a &nbsp;fresh increase in iron ore stocks at China&rsquo;s ports, after a hat trick of positive closes last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note, Canadian tariffs came into play on Sunday, where a 25% levy imposed largely targeting US steel and aluminium products as well as a 10% tariff on over 250 other US goods (such as beer kegs, whisky, and orange juice).</p>\r\n",

(FT)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany Interior Minister and CSU party leader Seehofer offered to resign, which follows a meeting over the weekend with Chancellor Merkel that Seehofer described as pointless and in which he rejected the migration deal that was negotiated at the EU summit. However, reports later stated that Seehofer is said to remain in politics if Chancellor Merkel&#39;s CDU party backs down regarding migration, while he also said he wants to avoid the collapse of Merkel&#39;s government and is said to be seeking one more discussion with the CDU. (Newswires) CSU caucus chief Dobrindt opposed the resignation and requested an internal vote, while there were also comments from Economy Minister Altmaier who stated that the German coalition is in a serious situation. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were mostly quiet, although the DXY attempted to recover last Friday&rsquo;s lost ground which has resulted to a mild pull-back in EUR/USD with the single currency slightly hampered by political discord in Germany which threatens Merkel&rsquo;s government after Interior Minister and CSU party leader Seehofer offered to resign amid migration dispute. The firmer greenback also saw GBP/USD relinquish the 1.3200 handle and USD/JPY briefly test 111.00 to the upside. Elsewhere, antipodeans weakened amid Trump-triggered oil declines and a pessimistic tone in the New Zealand Treasury&rsquo;s economic indicators, while MXN was initially underpinned following the elections in which Lopez Obrador won a decisive victory and is also set for a majority in parliament. However, gains were reversed as markets digested the ramifications of a left-wing government which would likely have a much fiscally looser stance than some of its opponents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand Treasury said March quarter Real GDP grew 0.5% which was below forecast in the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update and that annual current account deficit widened to NZD 7.9bln or 2.8% of GDP from NZD 7.7bln or 2.7% of GDP. Furthermore, the Treasury also stated it is seeing signs of less momentum in the economy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won a decisive victory in the Presidential election with quick count results showing he received 53.0%-53.8% of votes, while an exit poll also showed that Lopez Obrador is set to get a majority at the lower house. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices were pressured from the open and briefly fell below USD 73.00/bbl in reaction to a tweet from US President Trump over the weekend that he spoke with Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s King Salman on raising production maybe by as much as 2mln barrels and that prices were too high which the Saudi ruler agreed with. However, the White House were quick on clarifying that Saudi Arabia stated they could raise output if required and that there was no actual agreement to raising output by the said amount. Nonetheless, oil prices gapped lower at the open and head into the European open with losses of around 1.2%. Elsewhere, gold prices were uneventful with mild pressure seen as the greenback nursed losses, while copper languished amid weakness in stocks and disappointing data from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that he asked Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s King Salman to raise production maybe up to 2mln bpd to make up for Iran and Venezuela, while Trump added that prices are too high and that King Salman has agreed. The White House later clarified that Saudi Arabia has 2mln bbls of spare capacity and could raise output if needed but didn&rsquo;t vow to raise it by a stated amount. (Newswires/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh is said to urge fellow OPEC members to refrain from unilateral measures in a letter to UAE Energy Minister and OPEC President in which Zanganeh also warned that any production increases above limits is in breech of the agreement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia reportedly boosted June crude exports to highest since 2013, according to KPLER. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count (29 Jun) 1047 (Prev. 1052). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury trading was particularly quiet on Friday despite it being month-end, quarter-end, and half-end. Heading into the afternoon, volumes declined as it appeared most market players tried to get away early ahead of the Independence Day holiday next week. Despite equities trending higher, the risk-on sentiment failed to send bonds lower with IFR noting slightly month-end demand keeping bonds elevated. US 10YR T-Notes futures (Sep 2018) settled unchanged at 120-06.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said will wait until mid-term elections to decide on NAFTA and that he has no plans on backing down regarding China. Elsewhere, US President Trump said on Friday he is working on phase 2 of the tax plan and that he is considering cutting corporation tax again from 21% to 20%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Department was reported on Friday to have begun a review of US export controls ordered by President Trump, which will align with CFIUS legislation requirement to review emerging and foundational technologies essential to US national security. In separate news, there were also reports on Friday that US President Trump is said to have told advisors he wants the US to withdraw from the WTO. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU warned that US car import tariffs could result to a global retaliation that could impact as much as USD 300bln of US goods. (FT)</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) are mixed with strength in Property and Healthcare sectors just about keeping Australia afloat, while Japan is dampened following mixed Tankan data but with a weaker JPY limiting the downside. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) underperforms after both the Official and Caixin Manufacturing PMI missed estimates, while PBoC inaction resulting to a net daily drain and the absence of participants in Hong Kong for public holiday also ensured a subdued tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most FX majors are quiet, although the DXY attempts to recover last Friday&rsquo;s lost ground which has resulted to a mild pull-back in EUR/USD with the single currency slightly hampered by political discord in Germany which threatens Merkel&rsquo;s government after Interior Minister and CSU party leader offered to resign amid migration dispute. The firmer greenback also saw GBP/USD relinquish the 1.3200 handle and USD/JPY test 111.00 to the upside. Elsewhere, antipodeans are weaker amid Trump-triggered oil declines and a pessimistic tone in the New Zealand Treasury&rsquo;s economic indicators, while MXN is underpinned following the elections in which Lopez Obrador is said to have won a decisive victory and is also set for a majority in parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid the subdued risk tone in Japan and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market, while the less than impressive BoJ tankan survey and source reports the BoJ are to revise its CPI forecasts at this month&rsquo;s Outlook Report is also seen to likely to keep the BoJ maintaining its ultra-loose policy for a prolonged period.</p>\r\n",
