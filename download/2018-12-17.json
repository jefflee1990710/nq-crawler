With a similar view, White House Trade Advisor Navarro reiterated that the Fed is being the predominant factor in the stock market downturn and that, in his opinion, interest rates should not br raised on Wednesday since the economy is growing without inflation. On the economy, White House Economic Advisor Hassett believes Q4 GDP growth should be approximately 3% while the probability of US recession over the next 12 months is about zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> A Chinese Trade envoy told the WTO that US measures on steel and aluminium &quot;allow protectionism&quot; to exists under the suggestion of &quot;national security and called the US to work on a WTO reform and &quot;equal-grounds&quot; consultation. An EU trade envoy, also addressing the WTO, stated that the multilateral trading system is in a deep crisis, and the US is at its epicentre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Opposition leader Corbyn announced to be implementing a forward motion of no confidence in PM May for refusing to bring forward the meaningful vote immediately; note the vote is a political reprimand and does not trigger a general election. UK Brexit Minister Steve Baker noted that Eurosceptic Conservatives will vote with the Government and against Labour. Separately, a UK PM May spokesperson ruled out holding a second Brexit referendum while stating that there are no plans to hold an indicative vote in Parliament over Brexit options. Nonetheless PM May, in delivering her statement to the Commons, appeared open to an idea of indicative votes noting that if her deal was voted down then the government will bring forward proposals to parliament. This followed rumours that the British PM was pressured to hold the vote in Parliament to shed light on the next step in Brexit negotiations while her close allies were said to be pushing for a second referendum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 1.32 LOWER AT USD 49.88/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 0.67 LOWER AT USD 59.61/BBL. </strong>Oil prices slid lower on Monday, falling below the pre-OPEC meeting levels, as pessimism grows over the 1.2mln BPD cut&rsquo;s ability to balance out the market, as well as concerns over global growth. Not helping this was Genscape seeing a 630K barrel build at Cushing, Oklahoma - for the week ending December 14th - as well as the Buzzard, North Sea oilfield restarting. Elsewhere, EIA forecast US total shale regions&rsquo; oil production for January rising by 134,000 BPD at 8.166mln BPD (vs. 123,000 BPD rise in December). Looking ahead, tomorrow&rsquo;s API data is expected to show a 2.5mln barrel draw in crude, according to analysts, a 400K barrel build in distillates and a 1mln barrel build in gasoline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX -2.08% at 2546, NDX -2.22% at 6448, DJI -2.11% at 23593. SECTORS:</strong> Energy -1.86%, Materials -1.88%, Industrials -1.71%, Cons Discretionary -2.82%, Cons Staples -2.28%, Healthcare -2.11%, Financials -1.02%, Tech -2.21%, Telecoms -1.90%, Utilities -3.27%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Healthcare stocks took a &ldquo;turn for the worse&rdquo; today after a federal judge ruled that Obamacare was unconstitutional, Centene (CNC), HCA Healthcare (HCA), WellCare Health (WCG) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) all opened lower. Goldman Sachs (GS) underperformed following Malaysian regulators charging the co. in its involvement with the infamous 1MDB fund. PG&amp;E (PCG) traded lower as Californian regulators opened a case against the co. in regard to the camp fires. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) continued losses from Friday following the reports of asbestos in its talcum powder. Broker moves saw Best Buy (BBY) suffer from a downgrade at BAML and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) initially open higher on an upgrade at JPMorgan before drifting lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 8+ TICKS HIGHER AT 120-23. </strong>General risk-off sentiment pushed treasuries into negative territory on Monday as equities extended their slide. The equity sell-off weighed on yields which were lower across the curve by c.3bps at settlement. Focus now falls on the last 2018 Fed meeting scheduled for Wednesday; a 25bps rate hike is widely expected and investors will be looking out for the Fed&rsquo;s latest outlook as well as next year&rsquo;s hiking trajectory. This comes despite Trump renewing his Fed&rsquo;s criticism on Monday. Spreads were wider across the curve with 2s30s and 5s30s wider by c.1bps. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD:</strong> The broad Dollar and index have come under a bit more pressure in wake of significantly weaker than forecast Empire State manufacturing and NAHB indices, in the absence of much else on the macro front, and coming hot on the heels of another FOMC broadside from US President Trump ahead of the Fed&rsquo;s last policy meeting of 2018. The DXY inched a little closer to 97.000 as a result and further away from las Friday&rsquo;s fresh 97.700+ best for the year, with 96.850 forming nearest chart support if the big figure yields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>The Franc has emerged as the major front runner and broad winner vs the Dollar and Euro, eyeing 0.9900 and 1.1250 respectively amidst another downturn in risk sentiment and with uncertainty remaining on several EU issues, including Brexit, budget and politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, JPY, GBP, NZD:</strong> All firmer vs the Greenback, with the single currency now testing 1.1350 and the 30 DMA just above having surpassed option interest in just over 1 bn ahead of the NY cut (1.1320-35) and Usd/Jpy retreating through 113.00 again after only nibbling at offers said to be layered between 113.50-114.00, but not really threatening 1 bn expiries at 112.50. Elsewhere, the Pound remains relatively fragile and pivoted 1.2600 amidst reports that Labour Party leader Corbyn will call for a no confidence motion in PM May while rebounding towards 1.2650 after ERG members expressed support for May in the vote. Last but not least, the Kiwi has eased off overnight highs towards 0.6800 as risk appetite wanes, though the Nzd is still holding up better than the AUD, as the cross hugs 1.0550 and Aud/Usd stays south of 0.7200 in wake of the Aussie Government&rsquo;s 2018/19 GDP downgrade overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, MXN, TRY:</strong> Mixed performances to start the final full trading week before Xmas and the New Year, as the Loonie slipped back below 1.3400 against the backdrop of receding oil prices though reclaiming that figure in later US trade, but the Peso continues to give AMLO&rsquo;s budget the thumbs up, with Usd/Mxn trading towards the bottom end of a 20.065-2400 range. However, a Turkish ip miss kept the Lira under pressure between 5.3650-6965 parameters.</p>\r\n",

The DXY inched a little closer to 97.000 as a result and further away from las Friday&rsquo;s fresh 97.700+ best for the year, with 96.850 forming nearest chart support if the big figure yields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc has emerged as the major front runner and broad winner vs the Dollar and Euro, eyeing 0.9900 and 1.1250 respectively amidst another downturn in risk sentiment and with uncertainty remaining on several EU issues, including Brexit, budget and politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/GBP/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All firmer vs the Greenback, with the single currency now testing 1.1350 and the 30 DMA just above having surpassed option interest in just over 1 bn ahead of the NY cut (1.1320-35) and Usd/Jpy retreating through 113.00 again after only nibbling at offers said to be layered between 113.50-114.00, but not really threatening 1 bn expiries at 112.50. Elsewhere, the Pound remains relatively fragile and pivoted 1.2600 in the run up to the latest speech from UK PM May amidst reports that Labour Party leader Corbyn will call for a confidence vote if she does not announce a new date for the pulled Parliament meaningful ballot on the draft withdrawal agreement. Last but not least, the Kiwi has eased off overnight highs towards 0.6800 as risk appetite wanes, though the Nzd is still holding up better than the AUD, as the cross hugs 1.0550 and Aud/Usd stays south of 0.7200 in wake of the Aussie Government&rsquo;s 2018/19 GDP downgrade overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/MXN/TRY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed performances to start the final full trading week before Xmas and the New Year, as the Loonie slipped back below 1.3400 against the backdrop of receding oil prices, but the Peso continues to give AMLO&rsquo;s budget the thumbs up, with Usd/Mxn trading towards the bottom end of a 20.065-2400 range. However, a Turkish ip miss kept the Lira under pressure between 5.3650-6965 parameters.</p>\r\n",

The Dow plunged almost 500 points to its lowest level since early May, led lower by shares in Apple and Johnson &amp; Johnson, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq were dragged down by tech names as the sector lagged. ASX 200 (+1.0%) was buoyed by material and mining names after MOFCOM confirmed the suspension of retaliatory tariffs on US vehicles and auto parts, while Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) initially outperformed on currency effect as the export-heavy index benefitted from the weaker JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (Unch) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) traded choppy and swung between gains and losses in which the indices initially dipped in the red as industrial names were again pressured in a continuation from the weak IP data last week, housing names then provided the bourses with some support amid an improvement in house prices data.

Similarly, sectors are in the red with some underperformance seen in Consumer Discretionary alongside the European Retail Sector, the latter dropping to its lowest level since July 2016. This follows Asos (-40.0%) plummeting after cutting their full year outlook, which has pulled other retail names down in sympathy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, ABB (+0.8%) are up after the Co has reached a deal with Hitachi regarding their power grids division valued at USD 11bln.

However, the Dollar is treading cautiously into the FOMC amidst an approximate 75% probability for a 4th 25 bp hike, with the focus firmly on updated policy guidance and fresh dot plots to see whether the consensus has shifted towards a pause in tightening or a shallower rate profile from 2019 out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is just about keeping its head above 0.6800 vs its US counterpart and in front of the G10 pack, but largely by default and relative weakness in the Aud after the Australian Treasury downgraded its 2018/9 growth forecast to 2.75% from 3% overnight. Indeed, Aud/Usd remains capped ahead of 0.7200 where a decent 1.1 bn option expiry resides, while the Aud/Nzd cross is back under 1.0550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has reclaimed 1.1300+ status vs the Greenback, but may also be hampered by expiry interest between 1.1320-35 as 1.1 bn runs off at the NY cut, or technical resistance at the 30 DMA circa 1.1353 if the headline pair manages to clear option-related offers/hedges convincingly. No discernible reaction to final Eurozone inflation data even though the EU-harmonised measure was unexpectedly trimmed to 1.9% y/y from 2%. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/GBP - Also firmer vs the Usd, but mainly due to the Buck&rsquo;s pull-back from last Friday&rsquo;s highs (97.716, a marginal new 2018 peak as well) rather than anything Franc or Pound positive.

This has been helped along by the negative revision to EZ CPI with Bund techs looking to the 163.64 contract high on the upside as resistance. Meanwhile Gilts have been further depressed by the accounting changes at the ONS which &ldquo;effectively wipes out the Brexit buffer&rdquo; after the Brexit-driven downturn, that has pushed the benchmark to trade in close proximity to lows of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, US Treasuries have seen some bull steepening with 2s/10s and 10-year futures are uneventful ahead of an action-packed central bank week, that kicks off with the Chinese Central Economic Work Conference from Tuesday ahead of the FOMC on Wednesday, with BoJ, BoE and more thereafter, alongside US housing data tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+1.0%) and WTI (+1.0%) have shown a modest upside in prices with this more a by-product of currency effects as the dollar drifts lower.

Elsewhere, steel and iron ore prices have begun to rise due to winter production cuts, as Chinese authorities are trying to reduce air pollution levels. Separately, Vedanta may restart its 400ktpa Indian copper smelter following it&rsquo;s forced closure by the government due to pollution.</p>\r\n",

This has been helped along by the negative revision to EZ CPI with Bund techs looking to the 163.64 contract high on the upside as resistance.

The downturn in Bunds reflects similar price action in US Treasuries overnight as Asia-Pacific equities managed to shrug off weaker leads from Wall Street, while BTPs have recovered from a retreat below parity to eke out a marginal new high and may also be keeping their core counterpart depressed. However, the German debt is holding above near term support ahead of 163.00 around 163.04 and looking towards ECB&rsquo;s Smets for some fresh direction before final Eurozone inflation data that is unlikely to surprise.</p>\r\n",

The Dow fell almost 500 points to its lowest level since early May, led lower by shares in Apple and Johnson &amp; Johnson while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq were dragged down by tech names as the sector lagged. ASX 200 (+0.1%) is kept afloat by material and mining names while Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) outperforms on currency effect as the heavy-export index benefits from the weaker JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) are lower in which the former eroded gains to dip in the red as industrial names are still pressured by the weak Chinese IP data from last week, while the latter is weighed on by healthcare names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, most major pairs were uneventful as the DXY remained little changed sub-97.500 ahead of the FOMC meeting later this week, as such EUR/USD and GBP/USD remain within a tight range near Friday&rsquo;s levels at just above 1.1300 and around 1.2575 respectively. Elsewhere, antipodeans trade sideways as AUD shrugged off a cut to 2018/19 GDP forecast by the Treasury (2.75% vs. Prev. 3.00%) and NZD was little impacted by a weaker-than-previous services PMI. Elsewhere, JPY is marginally weaker as USD/JPY creeps closer to 113.50 with some attributing the softness to Hitachi&rsquo;s transaction to purchase 80% of Swiss listed ABB&rsquo;s power grids in a deal valued at USD 11bln. Finally, MXN outperforms in the EM scope after Mexican President AMLO presented the country&rsquo;s budget over the weekend with assumptions of 2% growth, 3.4% inflation, USD/MXN at 20.00 and an average export price for Mexican crude at USD 55/bbl.</p>\r\n",
