Monster (MNST) reported EPS 1c above expectations and revenues fell in-line with expectations. The shares in MNST were boosted as the energy drink maker announced a USD 500mln share repurchase programme. Germany&rsquo;s Adidas (ADS GY) reported figures early this morning where operating profit beat expectations and net income was higher than the previous, but revenues fell slightly short of consensus. Nonetheless, this benefited Nike (NKE) who was one of the outperformers in the DJI. Elsewhere, Tesla (TSLA) posted losses of ~5% after the co. was said to face a broader SEC scrutiny over CEO Elon Musk statements with the SEC said to be looking at Tesla before the takeover tweets, while Tribune Media (TRCO) terminated its merger agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI), confirming the source reports we saw in late trade yesterday. TRCO benefitted and traded over 3% higher on Thursday. SBGI fell ~3.5%, before paring back losses after the announcement of a USD 1bln share repurchase programme during trade where it regained to positive territory. Rite Aid (RAD) and Albertson&rsquo;s also terminated the merger agreement, which saw RAD fall more than 10%. Dun &amp; Bradstreet (DNB) agreed to be taken over by Cannae Holdings (CNNE) &amp; CC capital for USD 145/shr in cash in a transaction valued at USD 6.5bln. Finally, Glenview, which owns around USD 1.3bln in Cigna (CI) and Express Scripts (ESRX) (though held no position in Cigna at the time of the decision), opposed Icahn&rsquo;s views and showed they are supportive of the deal. Campbell Soup (CPB) was up 2% after sources reported Third Point is in talks to form a group that would own 8.5% of the Co. SPX -0.12% at 2854, NDX -0.03% at 7466, DJI at -0.27% at 25514.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex drifted higher on Thursday, with yields suppressed by unchanged PPI and ahead of the CPI release due tomorrow. The yield curve bull-flattened with yields hitting session lows following the 30yr auction; 5yr yields lower by c.3bps and the 30yr yield by c.4bps. The US sold $18bln in 30yr bonds tailing by 0.3bps at a high yield of 3.09%. The bid-to-cover posted at 2.27x, below the previous auction and the 6wk average, at the lowest level since February. In terms of internals, dealers were awarded the biggest share since February, indirects were awarded shares well above the trendline whilst directs took the smallest portion since January. * US 10YR T-notes settled 7 ticks higher at 119-23.</p>\r\n",

Additionally, the Russian embassy stated the new US sanctions are &quot;draconian&quot; and not backed by facts or evidence. Russian Lawmakers announced the country may consider restricting exports of RD-180 rocket engines to US as a result. Elsewhere, North Korea and South Korea announced they will hold high level talks on August 13th; ahead of the meeting North Korea&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry made clear that if the Trump administration sticks to old scenarios it cannot expect any progress on denuclearisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The US and the EU have begun laying groundwork for a trade agreement, with the State Department instructing the EU embassies to source trade deliverables. Note the EU delegation is planning a late August Washington trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Evans&rsquo; (Non-Voter, Dove) comments were slightly more hawkish than his typically dovish stance, given he dissented over a rate hike at the December meeting. He argued the US economy is performing &lsquo;very well&rsquo; and thinks one or two more rate hikes are reasonable by the end of year. He noted fundamentals are &lsquo;extremely strong&rsquo; with uncertainty surrounding trade offset by business confidence, following tax cuts and moves towards deregulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BoE&rsquo;s McCafferty said UK wage growth is to reach 4% next year and that although the City was currently pencilling in two interest rate rises in the next two years, he expects that the increases would probably be &ldquo;front-end loaded&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>The ECB&#39;s Economic Bulletin noted downside risks to the global economy have intensified as threats to protectionism remain prominent thus risks of heightened market volatility need monitoring. It predicted that if all threatened tariff measures are implemented, the average US tariff rate would rise to highest in 50 years. Finally, it highlighted that EZ indicators point to broad-based growth though at a somewhat slower pace than in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>Mexico&rsquo;s Foreign Minister said NAFTA talks are going well, but there is no NAFTA deal yet though they are doing their best to get a NAFTA auto agreement done as soon as possible. On the Canada front, Canada&#39;s ambassador to the US McNaughton said relations with the US are strong despite the tariffs, adding an auto deal is getting close though a sunset clause does remain a sticking point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US PPI:</strong> The m/m figure for July missed expectations at 0.2% coming in unchanged and pushing headline y/y to 3.3% below the 3.4% consensus. The weakness of the release was attributed to a 0.5% drop in oil prices, with oil anticipated to ease further in the upcoming months. Some also attributed the softness to a fall in the &lsquo;trade services&rsquo;, a volatile measure of profit margins for retailers. Analysts at Pantheon see a y/y peak at around 3% followed by a decline throughout the winter whilst Wells Fargo notes &lsquo;the upward trend in core inflation should remain gradual.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Claims dropped to 213k from 219k, below the consensus of 220k. The trend seems to have shifted to a new cycle low. Analysts at Pantheon note &ldquo;even as firms appear to be pulling back a bit on the pace of new hiring, the pace of gross firings continues to decline&rdquo; as companies find it difficult to replace employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.12% at 2854, NDX -0.03% at 7466, DJI at -0.27% at 25514. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.83%, Materials +0.63%, Industrials -0.35%, Cons Discretionary +0.05%, Cons Staples +0.44%, Healthcare +0.01%, Financials -0.29%, Tech +0.16%, Telecoms +1.13%, Utilities +0.45%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) posted losses of ~5% after the co. was said to face a broader SEC scrutiny over CEO Elon Musk statements with the SEC said to be looking at Tesla before the takeover tweets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Earnings from Fox (FOXA) saw the name slightly higher on Thursday trade as they beat both on top and bottom line and reiterated their commitment for the takeover of Sky (SKY LN). Monster (MNST) reported EPS 1c above expectations and revenues fell in-line with expectations. The shares in MNST were boosted as the energy drink maker announced a USD 500mln share repurchase programme. Germany&rsquo;s Adidas (ADS GY) reported figures early this morning where operating profit beat expectations and net income was higher than the previous, but revenues fell slightly short of consensus. Nonetheless, this benefited Nike (NKE) who was one of the outperformers in the DJI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>Tribune Media (TRCO) terminated its merger agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI), confirming the source reports we saw in late trade yesterday. TRCO benefitted and traded over 3% higher on Thursday. SBGI fell ~3.5%, before paring back losses after the announcement of a USD 1bln share repurchase programme during trade where it regained to positive territory. Rite Aid (RAD) and Albertson&rsquo;s also terminated the merger agreement, which saw RAD fall more than 10%. Dun &amp; Bradstreet (DNB) agreed to be taken over by Cannae Holdings (CNNE) &amp; CC capital for USD 145/shr in cash in a transaction valued at USD 6.5bln. Finally, Glenview, which owns around USD 1.3bln in Cigna (CI) and Express Scripts (ESRX) (though held no position in Cigna at the time of the decision), opposed Icahn&rsquo;s views and showed they are supportive of the deal. Campbell Soup (CPB) was up 2% after sources reported Third Point is in talks to form a group that would own 8.5% of the co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U8) SETTLE LOWER BY 13C AT USD 66.81/BBL; BRENT FUTURES (V8) SETTLE LOWER BY 21C AT USD 72.07/BBL. </strong>Following Wednesday&rsquo;s selloff in crude where it settled over $2 dollars lower, news flow was very quiet but PVM note despite the ongoing geopolitical tensions between Yemen Houthis and Saudi Arabia have picked up again after a missile was fired from the rebels into a Saudi town, sentiment was muted. Oil had recouped some of the losses seen yesterday but ended today&rsquo;s session relatively slightly lower, after swinging between gains and losses amid ongoing trade and geopolitical risks that might pose questions over oil demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE&nbsp; 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 119-23.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex drifted higher on Thursday, with yields suppressed by unchanged PPI and ahead of the CPI release due tomorrow,. The yield curve bull-flattened with yields hitting session lows following the 30yr auction; 5yr yields lower by c.3bps and the 30yr yield by c.4bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US sold $18bln in 30yr bonds tailing by 0.3bps at a high yield of 3.09%. The bid-to-cover posted at 2.27x, below the previous auction and the 6wk average, at the lowest level since February. In terms of internals, dealers were awarded the biggest share since February, indirects were awarded shares well above the trendline whilst directs took the smallest portion since January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD: </strong>Marked divergence between the antipodean Dollars with the Kiwi extending post-RBNZ losses as Assistant Governor McDermott embellished a dovish policy statement by clarifying that the prospect of a rate cut has risen, and latest guidance was designed to signal that tightening is not on the agenda. NZDUSD duly retreated further from 0.6700 and through 0.6650 with bears now looking beyond 0.6600 at levels around 0.6575 and 0.6550, while the AUDNZD cross soared above 1.1150 on its way to 1.1175 and is now eyeing 1.1200, as AUDUSD keeps its head south of 0.7400 vs its US counterpart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>No real respite away from the Yuan, as US sanctions and more domestic induced negatives hit the Lira and Rouble especially hard, but also the usual subjects of investor ire like the Rand, Peso and Real to name just a few. USDTRY hit yet another new record high around 5.5676 as Turkey&rsquo;s delegation returned from the US empty-handed or at least with no reported progress or deal to resolve the diplomatic rift, while the RUB only recovered slightly from circa 66.7100 lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>GBP Traded mixed amid broad USD strength and EUR weakness. GBPUSD declined after the comments from Evans which gave the USD a lift where he was less dovish than usual, but the EUR suffered while EURGBP retreated below 0.9000 from 0.9030 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, JPY:</strong> Both choppy and mostly rangebound vs the Greenback with single currency pivoting 1.1600 again and largely respecting key support and resistance levels either side of the big figure, while the Loonie only extended its trading parameters towards 1.3050 amidst mixed Canadian data (housing starts weaker than anticipated, but prices in line) and positive-sounding NAFTA news. USDJPY was even more anchored around 111.00 and likely bound by mega option expiries from that level and stretching up to 112.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>Ending Thursday&rsquo;s session as the clear G10 (and non-major for that matter) outperformer, and perhaps back to its safe-haven best, as the Franc tests bids circa 0.9900 vs the USD and bounces off 1.1500+ lows vs the EUR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: * US CPI. </strong>Although Thursday&rsquo;s PPIs surprised to the downside, dragged lower by softer services&rsquo; prices, the CPI release due on Friday is anticipated to come in strong. Expectations for headline CPI are for an increase of 0.2% M/M, which would bring the Y/Y figure to 3.0%; RBC notes that some mean reversion would suggest a more significant contribution to inflation is in the offing this month as shelter prices rose just 0.1% in June. The core measure is expected to remain steady at 2.3% Y/Y, the highest since the beginning of 2017. Scotiabank expects this to be &lsquo;the strongest reading since the end of 2011&rsquo; supported by base effects and elevated oil prices. Nevertheless, gasoline prices saw a modest decline of 1% in July which may subtract from the headline figure, analysts at RBC say. Since the economy is robust and advancing at a strong GDP rate of 4.1%, the sustained growth is likely to place further pressure on prices which could lead inflation to &lsquo;mildly overshoot the Fed target&rsquo;, analysts at Barclays note. Further upside risks, of cost-push nature, may originate from the recent escalation of trade tariffs between US and China, with the latest seeing China&rsquo;s implementation of 15% tariff on USD 16bln imports in response to US levies. Overall the CPI release should keep the Fed on track for another hike in September given the robust economic conditions in the US, BMO argues. In terms of longer term outlook, CIBC states &lsquo;there is no reason for the Fed for accelerate its rate hike path.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* UK GDP. </strong>UK GDP which is expected to show a rebound from the soft Q/Q Q1 print of 0.2% to a growth level of 0.4%, Y/Y is set to come in at 1.3% vs. Prev. 1.2%. In terms of expectations for the event, RBC note &ldquo;In the three months to May, GDP grew 0.2% 3m/3m driven by the services sector with both industry and construction acting as drags. However, the weaker March data, in particular for construction, now drops out of the 3m/3m calculation&rdquo;. Note, given the ONS&rsquo; new reporting schedule, the release will also be accompanied with the June M/M reading which is largely calculated on the latest production figures (Prev. 0.3%. From a policymaking perspective, the BoE will be looking for further vindication in their view that the soft growth at the start of the year was &lsquo;transitory&rsquo;. That said, the print will likely do little to either remove or enhance the possibility of an additional immediate rate hike given that the MPC acted last week and market remind unconvinced over the BoE&rsquo;s rate-hiking capabilities in the face of Brexit.</p>\r\n",

TD also points out that USD 23.1bn matures on the Fed&#39;s balance sheet, and the Fed will allow USD 12.6bn to run-off, reinvesting USD 10.5bn, which will add-on USD 4.6bn to 3s, USD 3.5bn to the 10s, and USD 2.4bn to 30s. It is also worth noting that this series of auctions has a higher issuance amount, per the August refunding, though TD Securities believe that the drift higher in yields is likely to support demand. Analysts at Societe Generale are cautious on the 30s auction, noting that the July&rsquo;s auction saw a tail, while cover was softer than recent auctions. It does however point out that participation of investment funds continues to notable. &ldquo;This is partly explained by ongoing demand for long duration securities from pension funds and is likely to help with the upcoming auction takedown as well,&rdquo; SocGen explains. In terms of set up, SG says that the 30s sector remains rich on the curve, though has cheapened since last month, when 5s30s hit fresh decade lows. The bank notes that positioning is likely to be supportive, as speculators&rsquo; have been further increasing net shorts in the ultra-bond to record levels. &ldquo;Any short covering from them is a positive for the auction,&rdquo; SocGTen says, but adds that &ldquo;dealers have increased their holdings in the 11+ year sector to the highest level since 2001, which is a negative.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marked divergence between the antipodean Dollars with the Kiwi extending post-RBNZ losses as Assistant Governor McDermott embellished a dovish policy statement by clarifying that the prospect of a rate cut has risen and latest guidance was designed to signal that tightening is not on the agenda. Nzd/Usd duly retreated further from 0.6700 and through 0.6650 with bears now looking beyond 0.6600 at levels around 0.6575 and 0.6550, while the Aud/Nzd cross soared above 1.1100 and 1.1150 on its way to 1.1175 and is now eyeing 1.1200, as Aud/Usd keeps its head north of 0.7400 vs its US counterpart with the aid of further Cny/Cnh consolidation off recent lows after firmer than expected Chinese inflation data overnight, and no more two-way trade/protectionism threats between Beijing and Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No real respite away from the Yuan, as US sanctions and more domestic induced negatives hit the Lira and Rouble especially hard, but also the usual subjects of investor ire like the Rand, Peso and Real to name just a few. Usd/Try hit yet another new record high around 5.4790 as Turkey&rsquo;s delegation from the US empty-handed or at least with no reported progress or deal to resolve the diplomatic rift, while the Rub only recovered slightly from circa 66.7100 lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, and in stark contrast to the recent trend, a partial reprieve for the Pound on reports that the EU may offer concessions to the UK on terms to remain in the single market post-Brexit, but unconfirmed and subject to confirmation or flat rejection. However, Cable did reclaim 1.2900 status at one stage from a fresh ytd low around 1.2842, while Eur/Gbp retreated below 0.9000 from 0.9030 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All choppy and rangebound vs the Greenback with single currency pivoting 1.1600 again and largely respecting key support and resistance levels either side of the big figure, while the Loonie only extended its trading parameters towards 1.3050 amidst mixed Canadian data (housing starts weaker than anticipated, but prices in line) and positive-sounding NAFTA news. Usd/Jpy was even more anchored around 111.00 and likely bound by mega option expiries from that level and stretching up to 112.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Thursday&rsquo;s session as the clear G10 (and non-major for that matter) outperformer, and perhaps back to its safe-haven best, as the Franc tests bids circa 0.9900 vs the Usd and bounces off 1.1500+ lows vs the Eur.</p>\r\n",

This initially weighed across the region with underperformance in the Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) after disappointing Machine Orders which declined at the fastest pace YTD and as automakers reeled from fresh reports of improper testing. ASX 200 (+0.5%) was also subdued at the open with Australia&rsquo;s energy sector dragged by a slump in crude, although the index then recovered amid strength in the largest weighted financials sector with Suncorp underpinned by a deal to sell its Australia life insurance unit and after it declared a special dividend. Elsewhere, both Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.8%) opened negative on the trade tensions, but then rebounded with a vengeance alongside a broad recovery in the region and after Chinese inflation data topped estimates to suggest stronger than anticipated activity. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid a lack of drivers and choppy sentiment in the region, while the 30yr auction also failed to spur demand with all metrics weaker than prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8317 (Prev. 6.8313)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese CPI (Jul) Y/Y 2.1% vs. Exp. 1.9% (Prev. 1.9%). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese PPI (Jul) Y/Y 4.6% vs. Exp. 4.4% (Prev. 4.7%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese Machinery Orders (Jun) M/M -8.8% vs. Exp. -1.3% (Prev. -3.7%); fastest decline since December 2017.

RBNZ repeated rates are to stay expansionary for a considerable time and the next move could be up or down, while it also stated that recent growth moderation could persist for longer. Furthermore, it lowered its forecast for OCR to 1.8% from 1.9% for both September 2019 and December 2019 and lowered TWI NZD forecast to 72.8% from 74.0%, while RBNZ Governor Orr later stated the OCR could be lowered if growth slows further. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May reportedly sent letters to Conservative party grassroots to seek support from individual members for the Chequers plan. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US White House is reportedly drafting an executive order that would permit placing sanctions on foreign nationals that interfere with US elections. (Washington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian embassy says the new US sanctions are &quot;draconian&quot; and not backed by facts or evidence, while there were reports Russia may respond to the US with the use of countersanctions law. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade flat-to-lower (Eurostoxx 50 Unch) with heavier underperformance in the FTSE 100 (-0.6%) following a plethora of large cap ex-dividends. Softer oil prices also weigh on index&rsquo;s energy giants while the sector as a whole lags. Consumer discretionary outperforms on the back of Adidas (+7.4%) lifting the sector and supporting the DAX 30 (Unch) amid earnings. Of note: Deutsche Bank upgraded the European auto sector to overweight from benchmark, while the firm downgraded European pharma and consumer staples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - By far the biggest G10 loser as the RBNZ tweaked OCR rate projections out to the end of next year and stressed that a hike is firmly off the table given increased risks of a cut. The Kiwi has nosedived in response and further on dovish comments from deputy Governor McDermott to test support around 0.6650 vs its US counterpart and 1.1175 vs its AUD antipodean peer, which is holding up better with the YUAN in wake of stronger than expected Chinese CPI and PPI data overnight (Aud/Usd between 0.7415-55).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY/RUB - Bringing up the rear again in the EM area, as US sanctions continue to bite and investors take flight, while the Rouble is also losing more ground due to ongoing weakness in oil prices. Usd/Try is just off a new all time high circa 5.4475 and Usd/Rub a fresh ytd peak around 66.7100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR - Broad risk aversion due to ongoing global trade and diplomatic spats from the US to China, EU, Turkey, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Canada, plus heightened risks of a no deal Brexit continue to take their toll on Sterling and the single currency to varying degrees. Indeed, Cable has fallen again and through 1.2850 for what seems to be daily 2018 lows, but Eur/Gbp is not extending too much further above 0.9000, for now, as the single currency also fails to maintain gains over 1.1600 vs the Greenback ahead of key technical resistance levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF/CAD - All moderately softer vs the Dollar, but sticking close to recent ranges with Usd/Jpy pivoting around 111.00 and hefty option expiries from the big figure upwards (1.8 bn between 111.00-05, 1.1 bn from 111.25-30 and 2 bn at 111.50-55), while the Franc remains anchored either side of 0.9950 and Loonie is back on the 1.3000 handle after very volatile moves on Wednesday following reports that Canada may be allowed to attend US-Mexico NAFTA negotiations having been excluded from the latest talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been a case of nearly, but not quite for the 10 year EU benchmarks as nearest bullish chart levels/targets were tested and marginally eclipsed, though lacking the depth of conviction due to summer volumes (in part) for a further extension and clean breaks. Indeed, Bunds got to 162.48 (+37 ticks), but failed to push on through 162.50 to really tempt stops, and similarly Gilts only inched a couple of ticks beyond 123.10 before losing momentum and retreating to a new Liffe low of 122.92 as their Eurozone equivalent recoils to 162.23. In truth, it has all reverted to relatively grey seasonal trade (like the UK weather!) with even FX markets calming down after runs on EM currencies and more downside for the current G10 whipping boys, Kiwi and Pound. Back to debt futures, US Treasuries are essentially flat ahead of some decent data (for the first time this week) and final auction as $18 bn long bonds go under the hammer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (Unch) and Brent (Unch) are trading within the prior day&rsquo;s range, with WTI futures breaching USD 67/bbl to the upside. Brent initially flip-flopped either side of USD 72/bbl before grasping a firmer footing north of the level. News flow has been light for the complex. Elsewhere gold continues to move off intraday highs of USD 1216.29 as the dollar strengthens in European trade. Copper takes a breather having surged overnight, stabilising around USD 2.765/oz.</p>\r\n",

Softer oil prices also weigh on index&rsquo;s energy giants while the sector as a whole lags. Consumer discretionary outperforms on the back of Adidas (+8.2%) lifting the sector and supporting the DAX 30 (Unch) amid earnings. Of note: Deutsche Bank upgraded the European auto sector to overweight from benchmark, while the firm downgraded European pharma and consumer staples.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - By far the biggest G10 loser as the RBNZ tweaked OCR rate projections out to the end of next year and stressed that a hike is firmly off the table given increased risks of a cut. The Kiwi has nosedived in response and further on dovish comments from deputy Governor McDermott to test support around 0.6650 vs its US counterpart and 1.1175 vs its AUD antipodean peer, which is holding up better with the YUAN in wake of stronger than expected Chinese CPI and PPI data overnight (Aud/Usd between 0.7415-55).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY/RUB - Bringing up the rear again in the EM area, as US sanctions continue to bite and investors take flight, while the Rouble is also losing more ground due to ongoing weakness in oil prices. Usd/Try is just off a new all time high circa 5.4475 and Usd/Rub a fresh ytd peak around 66.7100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR - Broad risk aversion due to ongoing global trade and diplomatic spats from the US to China, EU, Turkey, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Canada, plus heightened risks of a no deal Brexit continue to take their toll on Sterling and the single currency to varying degrees. Indeed, Cable has fallen again and through 1.2850 for what seems to be daily 2018 lows, but Eur/Gbp is not extending too much further above 0.9000, for now, as the single currency also fails to maintain gains over 1.1600 vs the Greenback ahead of key technical resistance levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF/CAD - All moderately softer vs the Dollar, but sticking close to recent ranges with Usd/Jpy pivoting around 111.00 and hefty option expiries from the big figure upwards (1.8 bn between 111.00-05, 1.1 bn from 111.25-30 and 2 bn at 111.50-55), while the Franc remains anchored either side of 0.9950 and Loonie is back on the 1.3000 handle after very volatile moves on Wednesday following reports that Canada may be allowed to attend US-Mexico NAFTA negotiations having been excluded from the latest talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been a case of nearly, but not quite for the 10 year EU benchmarks as nearest bullish chart levels/targets were tested and marginally eclipsed, though lacking the depth of conviction due to summer volumes (in part) for a further extension and clean breaks. Indeed, Bunds got to 162.48 (+37 ticks), but failed to push on through 162.50 to really tempt stops, and similarly Gilts only inched a couple of ticks beyond 123.10 before losing momentum and retreating to a new Liffe low of 122.92 as their Eurozone equivalent recoils to 162.23. In truth, it has all reverted to relatively grey seasonal trade (like the UK weather!) with even FX markets calming down after runs on EM currencies and more downside for the current G10 whipping boys, Kiwi and Pound. Back to debt futures, US Treasuries are essentially flat ahead of some decent data (for the first time this week) and final auction as $18 bn long bonds go under the hammer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (Unch) and Brent (Unch) are trading within the prior day&rsquo;s range, with WTI futures breaching USD 67/bbl to the upside. Brent initially flip-flopped either side of USD 72/bbl before grasping a firmer footing north of the level. News flow has been light for the complex. Elsewhere gold continues to move off intraday highs of USD 1216.29 as the dollar strengthens in European trade. Copper takes a breather having surged overnight, stabilising around USD 2.765/oz.</p>\r\n",

Bunds and Gilts are both extending gains off firmer starts on Eurex and Liffe to 162.44 and 123.07 respectively (+33 and +23 ticks) having kicked off at 162.27 and 122.97, with the former deriving additional upside impetus from another downturn in BTPs on top of the overall risk-averse tone as EMs suffer the worst of ongoing sanctions and global trade angst. Meanwhile, Short Sterling contracts are bid from Mar19 out amidst heavy bullish/dovish option activity via call spreads, betting/hedging on a bad Brexit and cut in BoE rates. Back to bonds, 162.47 for Bunds has capped rallies of late, while Gilts have near term resistance around 123.10 before 123.39.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets eventually traded mostly higher on what has been a choppy session as sentiment recovered from the initial trade-related losses triggered by China&rsquo;s retaliation announcement of 25% tariffs on USD 16bln of US goods. This initially weighed across the region with underperformance in the Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) after disappointing Machine Orders which declined at the fastest pace YTD and as automakers reeled from fresh reports of improper testing. ASX 200 (+0.7%) was also subdued at the open with Australia&rsquo;s energy sector dragged by a slump in crude, although the index then recovered amid strength in the largest weighted financials sector with Suncorp underpinned by a deal to sell its Australia life insurance unit and after it declared a special dividend. Elsewhere, both Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.8%) were initially weakened on the trade tensions, but then rebounded alongside a broad recovery in the region and after Chinese inflation data topped estimates to suggest stronger than anticipated activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is steady and its counterparts across the pond are mixed with EUR/USD holding near the prior day&rsquo;s highs while GBP/USD languishes below 1.2900 and near a 1-year low. This saw EUR/GBP extend above 0.9000 in which UBS eyes further upside to 0.9200 by year-end and to 0.9500 by end-2019. Elsewhere, antipodeans are mixed with NZD/USD slipping to its lowest since early 2016 after a dovish RBNZ which kept rates unchanged as expected at 1.75% where it expects it to remain into 2020, while AUD found support along with CNH on the firmer than expected Chinese CPI and PPI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid a lack of drivers and the choppy sentiment in the region, while participants are also sidelined ahead of the 30yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
