(Telegraph)<br /><br />Italy reportedly provided some hope for UK PM May after Italian Deputy PM Salvini stated the government would support the UK in trade discussions and accused the EU of attempting to swindle UK Brexit voters. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S&amp;P affirmed Slovakia at A+; Outlook Stable, while Fitch also affirmed Slovakia at A+; Outlook Stable and affirmed Sweden at AAA; Outlook Stable.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump threatened he would be willing to allow for a government shutdown if the Democrats do not provide the votes for border security which includes building the Wall.

A combination of reasons was being thrown around: the FAANG weakness (add Twitter to that mix) this week was said to weigh on investor confidence, the VIX rose towards highs of the week, while haven currencies (JPY) were bid, while oil was sliding (Oil drillers add rigs for the first week in three, Baker Hughes said). Some also suggest that, ahead of next week&#39;s central bank activity (BOJ, FOMC, BOE), investors were taking chips off the table. Elsewhere, LAM Research (LRCX) was among the leaders after beating on the top and bottom-lines, and with management declaring the September quarter as the bottom, which helped boost other tech stocks. Although Chevron (CVX) missed expectations, its chairman noted that earnings were up significantly on the year, benefiting from higher crude prices and higher production, as well as strong operations. Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) was higher, with numbers aided by knee and hip products. Expedia (EXPE) beat on EPS, in line on revenues. On the other side of the coin, Twitter (TWTR) user data disappointed, sending shares lower; Edwards Lifesciences reported lower than expected revenue, while Intel (INTC) beat on top and bottom-lines, boosted guidance, but said that new chips wouldn&#39;t be rolled out until next year, pressuring shares on concerns that the chipmaker would be vulnerable to rivals who are pushing in on its space. CBS (CBS) posted losses of 6% after CEO Moonves was said to be accused of sexual misconduct; Viacom (VIAB) gained and was up 4% on the back of the news. N.Y. state rescinded approval of the merger between Charter (CHTR) (Spectrum) and Time Warner Cable, citing repeated failure to meet agreed-to targets. SPX -0.65% at 2819, NDX -1.40% at 7297, DJI -0.29% at 25452.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The complex was higher, with the curve garnering some support as the tech slide continued, though volume was thin, and yields only came in modestly; at one point, however, three-year yields found fresh highs not seen in over a decade. There was choppy trade around the GDP release (bias to the upside), but ultimately, there was not a lot to sing home about. Attention on next week&rsquo;s quarterly refunding and FOMC, and, given its impact on Treasuries recently, the BOJ meeting at the early part of the week. US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 3 ticks higher at 119-14.</p>\r\n",
