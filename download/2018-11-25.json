(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was reported on Friday that Italy&#39;s EU Affairs Minister Savona was said to be thinking about resigning in dissent over the government&#39;s challenge to EU budget rules, although there were later reports that Italy&#39;s Deputy PM Salvini spoke to EU Affair Minister Savona and does not believe he is planning to quit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian Deputy PM Salvini threatened to bring down the government if coalition&rsquo;s budget deficit target was changed. However, there were conflicting reports which suggested Salvini hinted of some room for compromise in which he stated that nobody is fixated on 2.4% budget deficit and that if there&#39;s a budget that makes the country grow, it could be 2.2% or 2.6%.

Airlines traded higher today following the sharp sell-off in crude prices including stocks such as Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL). On the other side of the crude sell-off the energy sector got slammed across the board, Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), EOG Resources (EOG) and Conoco Phillips (COP) were all weighing down the group. Facebook (FB) was also a bottom mover as its political scandals remain present in news flow. SPX -0.65% at 2632, NDX -0.73% at 6527, DJI -0.73% at 24286.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were mixed, with the T-Note drifting slightly higher in thin-liquidity conditions. The upward momentum was inspired by pre-market risk off, as equity futures and, crucially, crude futures, were on the back foot. Moves were small, however, and as we leave for the weekend, the Z18 contract is knocking in the middle of the day&#39;s range (11904 to 119-15). T-notes (Z8) settled 1+ tick higher at 119-09.</p>\r\n",
