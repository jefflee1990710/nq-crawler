The USD slide continues, with the DXY sliding for the fourth day this week; if it prints red tomorrow, the dollar index will have seen a daily decline every day this week. There wasn&rsquo;t any fresh reason for the declines, with the analyst community content to use the protectionism/stagflation/global growth-allowing-other-FX-to-play-catch-up narrative. The index itself is now flirting with the 88.50 mark, which some technical analysts have suggested is a triple bottom near the 61.8% retracement level of the 2014 low to 2017 high. The result was EUR jumped above 1.25 again &ndash; which will likely irritate officials at ECB HQ, JPY on the cusp of breaching 106.00 (there was brief weakness for the yen vs the USD after news that academic Professor Wakatabe was in the frame for the BOJ deputy governor role. Though weakness was fleeting &ndash; an announcement on BOJ positions may come overnight, according to some reports), and allowing GBP to sit at 1.41. EMFX naturally took advantage of the firmer risk tone, though the BRL was lower vs the USD after inflation data.&nbsp; </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 74 cents higher at USD 61.34 per barrel; Brent futures settle 3 cents lower at USD 64.33 per barrel. A weaker dollar was being cited as the reason crude pared back losses on Thursday (WTI LOD was around $59.65, Brent LOD was around $63.10). Traders continued to cite the Russia/Saudi comments from yesterday (where Saudi said it will trim production next month) as well as this week&rsquo;s inventory data, which showed smaller than expected builds for headline crude. Traders also noted that Brent&rsquo;s premium to WTI was narrowing to six-month lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UAE Energy Minister said oil producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia aim to draft an agreement on long-term alliance by the year-end.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The emini extended gains for a fifth day, continuing to pare-back losses incurred after the volatility-induced slide. The March contract rose to highs above 2725, after breaking through the 2720 resistance level (now turned support). Grinding out gains is proving tough work, and the contract remains around 5% off highs near 2785. Traders continued to cite the healthy landscape of corporate America (solid earnings, fiscal reform boost, etc), and decent prospects for global growth as the driver. In terms of sectors, tech and industrials were leading; Apple was higher after Berkshire Hathaway made the company its top investment, while Cisco&rsquo;s results released on Wednesday were received well. Energy was the laggard, after crude softness in early trade. The VIX, meanwhile remains under the 20 handle. SPX +1.21% at 2731, DJI +1.23% at 25200, NDX +1.8% at 6795.<br /><br />Top performers: Utilities +1.75%, Tech +1.72%, Industrials +1.23%.<br />Bottom performers: Energy -0.50%, Financials +0.47%, Cons Cyclicals +0.52%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surge higher in yields paused on Thursday, with buyers emerging as 10-year yields rose above 2.90% (2.94% was the HOD). Today&rsquo;s data slate (PPI, industrial production, Philly Fed, weekly jobless claims) had little influence on price action, with the narrative still fixed on inflationary pressures following the January payrolls data which signalled wages were firming, and January&rsquo;s CPI data released this week, that surprised to the upside; yesterday&rsquo;s retail sales missed was being explained away as a blip following retail inventories being drawn down strongly, leaving retailers with little need to slash prices in January sales, perhaps explaining the weakness in the January retail sales data. The US Treasury auctioned new 30-year tips, tailing by 1.4bps, though indirect participation was encouraging. The US Treasury announced it will next week auction $28bln in 2s, $35bln in 5s, and $29bln in 7s, as well as $15bln of 2y FRNs. At settlement, The Treasuries were little changed on the day, with most of the action focussed in the long end, where yields fell by just shy of 3bps. T-Note Futures settle 4 ticks higher at 120-14+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The March contract rose to highs above 2725, after breaking through the 2720 resistance level (now turned support). Grinding out gains is proving tough work, and the contract remains around 5% off highs near 2785. Traders continued to cite the healthy landscape of corporate America (solid earnings, fiscal reform boost, etc), and decent prospects for global growth as the driver. In terms of sectors, tech and industrials were leading; Apple was higher after Berkshire Hathaway made the company its top investment, while Cisco&rsquo;s results released on Wednesday were received well. Energy was the laggard, after crude softness in early trade. The VIX, meanwhile remains under the 20 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: T-Note Futures settle 4 ticks higher at 120-14+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surge higher in yields paused on Thursday, with buyers emerging as 10-year yields rose above 2.90% (2.94% was the HOD). Today&rsquo;s data slate (PPI, industrial production, Philly Fed, weekly jobless claims) had little influence on price action, with the narrative still fixed on inflationary pressures following the January payrolls data which signalled wages were firming, and January&rsquo;s CPI data released this week, that surprised to the upside; yesterday&rsquo;s retail sales missed was being explained away as a blip following retail inventories being drawn down strongly, leaving retailers with little need to slash prices in January sales, perhaps explaining the weakness in the January retail sales data. The US Treasury auctioned new 30-year tips, tailing by 1.4bps, though indirect participation was encouraging. The US Treasury announced it will next week auction $28bln in 2s, $35bln in 5s, and $29bln in 7s, as well as $15bln of 2y FRNs. At settlement, The Treasuries were little changed on the day, with most of the action focussed in the long end, where yields fell by just shy of 3bps;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY trades 0.65% lower heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD slide continues, with the DXY sliding for the fourth day this week; if it prints red tomorrow, the dollar index will have seen a daily decline every day this week. There wasn&rsquo;t any fresh reason for the declines, with the analyst community content to use the protectionism/stagflation/global growth-allowing-other-FX-to-play-catch-up narrative. The index itself is now flirting with the 88.50 mark, which some technical analysts have suggested is a triple bottom near the 61.8% retracement level of the 2014 low to 2017 high. The result was EUR jumped above 1.25 again &ndash; which will likely irritate officials at ECB HQ, JPY on the cusp of breaching 106.00 (there was brief weakness for the yen vs the USD after news that academic Professor Wakatabe was in the frame for the BOJ deputy governor role. Though weakness was fleeting &ndash; an announcement on BOJ positions may come overnight, according to some reports), and allowing GBP to sit at 1.41.EMFX naturally took advantage of the firmer risk tone, though the BRL was lower vs the USD after inflation data. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 74 cents higher at USD 61.34 per barrel; Brent futures settle 3 cents lower at USD 64.33 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A weaker dollar was being cited as the reason crude pared back losses on Thursday (WTI LOD was around $59.65, Brent LOD was around $63.10). Traders continued to cite the Russia/Saudi comments from yesterday (where Saudi said it will trim production next month) as well as this week&rsquo;s inventory data, which showed smaller than expected builds for headline crude. Traders also noted that Brent&rsquo;s premium to WTI was narrowing to six-month lows.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, <strong>Nikkei 225 (+1.5%)</strong> advanced and managed to overlook a firmer JPY and slump in machine orders, while <strong>Hang Seng (+1.6%)</strong> closed the session as the outperformer in a holiday-shortened session, before it joined its mainland counterparts for Lunar New Year celebrations. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat with early mild pressure seen amid the uptick in riskier assets, although this was later counterbalanced amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for 1yr-10yr JGBs totalling over JPY 1tln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese government may provide a list of nominees for BoJ Governor and Deputy Governors on Friday.

(Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU diplomats have removed a so-called &quot;punishment clause&quot; from a draft text of the arrangement for the Brexit transition period, the BBC understands. (BBC) However, it was later reported that the EU denied this was the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European bourses trade higher across the board <strong>(Eurostoxx 50 +0.6%)</strong> in a continuation of the sentiment seen yesterday on Wall Street and overnight in Asia-Pac trade. On a sector basis, consumer staples underperform following lacklustre earnings from Swiss-titan <strong>Nestle (-2.2%)</strong>, with the index heavyweight subsequently leading the SMI to lag its peers in the region. Elsewhere, South African exposed <strong>Old Mutual (+3.8%)</strong> and <strong>Anglo American (+3.0%)</strong> lead the FTSE 100 as South Africa now eyes life-after Zuma with Ramaphosa now appointed as Preisdent. Miners occupy a bulk of the other outperformers in the UK amid movements in the commodity complex with <strong>Antofagasta (+2.9%)</strong> also lifted after winning approval for a USD 1.1bln revamp of its Los Pelambres copper mine. Elsewhere, <strong>Standard Life (-4.9%)</strong> sits at the bottom of the FSTE 100 after Scottish Widows and Lloyds sent notices to co. to terminate investment management relations. Finally, earnings dominate the state of play in the <strong>CAC with Airbus (+9.3%),</strong> <strong>Schneider Electric (+3.6%)</strong> and <strong>CapGemini (+2.5%)</strong> all lifted by encouraging earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japan&rsquo;s Finance Minister Aso has seemingly given the green light for <strong>Jpy</strong> bulls to charge on, and 106.00 vs the <strong>Usd</strong> is now within striking distance given little in the way of technical support until 105.85 vs the latest 106.20 low. Moreover, all other G10 rivals are eyeing recent peaks vs the Greenback with Cable just eclipsing the 1.4067 level posted after the BoE&rsquo;s hawkish policy guidance shift on February 8th, while <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> almost challenged Fib resistance at 1.2518 ahead of the 1.2537 year to date high before slipping back below 1.2500. <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Chf</strong> is toppy around the bottom of a 0.9300-0.9230 range, while <strong>Nzd</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> has rebounded above the 0.7400 handle and <strong>Aud</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> is over 0.7950 despite mixed jobs data overnight and ahead of RBA Governor Lowe orates later today. <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Cad</strong> relatively steady albeit sharply down from Wednesday&rsquo;s post-US CPI data spike highs and sub-1.2500 amidst ongoing NAFTA uncertainty and awaiting a speech from BoC Deputy Governor Schembri. All this leaves the Dollar Index below 89.00 again and vulnerable against a deeper set-back towards 2018 lows under 88.50, especially as the <strong>Usd</strong> continues to suffer broader losses with the likes of <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Zar</strong> sliding towards 11.6400 in wake of the resignation of Zuma as SA President with immediate effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ANC party are to nominate Cyril Ramaphosa as President, according to ANC; as expected. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK fixed was already probing new Liffe lows in the run up to the DMO auction but succumbed to a bit more downside pressure after the results revealed a lengthy 19 tick price or 0.7 bp yield tail, even with the lofty 1.914% average cost of funding. The 10 year future inched close to the next round number at 120.13 (-69 ticks vs the previous close), and <strong>Bunds</strong> appear to have fallen in sympathy to a fresh Eurex base at 157.43 (-55 ticks). In truth, much like the Usd core bonds are in a downward spiral and corresponding yields are inclining in bear-flattening mode regardless. <strong>USTs</strong> are only a few ticks off worst levels, albeit with the long bond future back in positive terrain. In yield terms, the benchmark US 10 year maturity is just easing back from a new high in the recent/current cycle around 2.93% and 3% seems that natural assumption from here, with 3.25% in mind for 30 year cash for the same psychological if not technical rationale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> crude futures trade in close proximity to recent highs seen in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s smaller than expected build in the DoEs and comments from Saudi with prices also supported by the broad softness in the USD. In metals, gold prices have also benefitted from the softer USD, although gains are likely capped by the broad-based risk sentiment in the market. Elsewhere, <strong>copper</strong> prices have hit their highest level in 10 days amid this morning&rsquo;s risk environment, while price action was relatively limited during Asia-Pac trade given the closure of the Shanghai Futures Exchange for the Lunar New Year holiday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: European bourses firmer across the board. SMI lags following soft Nestle earnings. USD remains weaker.",
        "content": "<p>European bourses trade higher across the board (Eurostoxx 50 +0.6%) in a continuation of the sentiment seen yesterday on Wall Street and overnight in Asia-Pac trade. On a sector basis, consumer staples underperform following lacklustre earnings from Swiss-titan Nestle (-2.2%), with the index heavyweight subsequently leading the SMI to lag its peers in the region. Elsewhere, South African exposed Old Mutual (+3.8%) and Anglo American (+3.0%) lead the FTSE 100. Miners occupy a bulk of the other outperformers in the UK amid movements in the commodity complex with Antofagasta (+2.9%) also lifted after winning approval for a USD 1.1bln revamp of its Los Pelambres copper mine. Elsewhere, Standard Life (-4.9%) sits at the bottom of the FSTE 100 after Scottish Widows and Lloyds sent notices to co. to terminate investment management relations. Finally, earnings dominate the state of play in the CAC with Airbus (+9.3%), Schneider Electric (+3.6%) and CapGemini (+2.5%) all lifted by encouraging earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japan&rsquo;s Finance Minister Aso has seemingly given the green light for Jpy bulls to charge on, and 106.00 vs the Usd is now within striking distance given little in the way of technical support until 105.85 vs the latest 106.20 low. Moreover, all other G10 rivals are eyeing recent peaks vs the Greenback with Cable just eclipsing the 1.4067 level posted after the BoE&rsquo;s hawkish policy guidance shift on February 8th, while Eur/Usd almost challenged Fib resistance at 1.2518 ahead of the 1.2537 year to date high before slipping back below 1.2500. Usd/Chf is toppy around the bottom of a 0.9300-0.9230 range, while Nzd/Usd has rebounded above the 0.7400 handle and Aud/Usd is over 0.7950 despite mixed jobs data overnight and ahead of RBA Governor Lowe orates later today. Usd/Cad relatively steady albeit sharply down from Wednesday&rsquo;s post-US CPI data spike highs and sub-1.2500 amidst ongoing NAFTA uncertainty and awaiting a speech from BoC Deputy Governor Schembri. All this leaves the Dollar Index below 89.00 again and vulnerable against a deeper set-back towards 2018 lows under 88.50, especially as the Usd continues to suffer broader losses with the likes of Usd/Zar sliding towards 11.6400 in wake of the resignation of Zuma as SA President with immediate effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bounces are becoming less pronounced and prolonged as sellers look increasingly impatient or anxious about missing the boat. Hence, after a short-lived recovery and period of consolidation debt futures are back on the rack having registered fresh session lows. Bunds hit 157.53 after failing to sustain the earlier rebound convincingly through 157.78 and now seem prone to further losses with last week&rsquo;s 157.26 Eurex intraday base the obvious downside target, while Gilts fell to 120.31 for a 51 tick decline from Wednesday&rsquo;s Liffe settlement and USTs are only a few ticks off worst levels, albeit with the long bond future back in positive terrain. In yield terms, the benchmark US 10 year maturity is just easing back from a new high in the recent/current cycle around 2.93% and 3% seems that natural assumption from here, with 3.25% in mind for 30 year cash for the same psychological if not technical rationale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures trade in close proximity to recent highs seen in the wake of yesterday&rsquo;s smaller than expected build in the DoEs and comments from Saudi with prices also supported by the broad softness in the USD. In metals, gold prices have also benefitted from the softer USD, although gains are likely capped by the broad-based risk sentiment in the market. Elsewhere, copper prices have hit their highest level in 10 days amid this morning&rsquo;s risk environment, while price action was relatively limited during Asia-Pac trade given the closure of the Shanghai Futures Exchange for the Lunar New Year holiday.</p>\r\n",

The Short Sterling strip is also attempting to draw a line in the sand with 3 month contracts now broadly flat from 1-2 ticks below par at one stage. Back to Gilts, rebounds may be capped amidst the overall bear trend in debt markets ahead of DMO issuance in the form of Gbp2.25 bn 2057 paper, though there is clearly a decent concession and natural demand at the long end of the curve from the usual funds looking to weight assets vs liabilities. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The 10 year German debt future gapped down 33 ticks from the get go and dipped further to a 157.58 low before finding what looks like fragile base and token rebound to 157.73 as US Treasuries remain under pressure and yields continue to grind higher.

That in itself is a problematic view, some say, arguing that the terminal rate it probably a better focal point, and nothing about today&rsquo;s data suggest that there will be a higher peak of the Federal Funds Rate in this hiking cycle. As cash trade got underway, equities bounced back, with the emini eventually rising towards 2700, though seemed unable to breach that level. Many traders noted that the initial sell-off to the data was somewhat overdone given that the health of corporate America is still in good shape (corporate earnings have looked good &ndash; thus far, 72% of the 354 S&amp;P 500 companies that had reported at the end of play yesterday had beat expectations, some desk note, while February dividend flows remain a supporting factor), while some took comfort from the Nasdaq punching above its 50dma. The equity surge came amid another fall in VIX, with the index falling to beneath 20 on Wednesday. Spooz have now printed straight four days of gains.</p>\r\n",

This was attributed to various factors including stagflation and deficit concerns, while some also suggested the data wasn&rsquo;t likely to result to a higher peak of the Federal Funds Rate in the current hiking cycle. AUD/USD remained firmer despite a bout of indecision following Employment Change data which beat expectations but was solely driven by part-timers, as Full-Time Employment contracted substantially. Elsewhere, JPY continued to strengthen with USD/JPY firmly below 107.00 as Japanese officials remained coy to the recent price action and Finance Minister Aso stated the JPY strength was not enough to require intervention.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Australian Employment Change (Jan) 16.0k vs. Exp. 15.0k (Prev. 34.7k, Rev. 33.5k).

ASX 200 (+0.9%) is positive with its biggest movers dictated by earnings releases and with commodity names underpinned by strength in the complex. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) advanced and managed to overlook a firmer JPY and slump in machine orders, while Hang Seng (+1.3%) also edges gains in a holiday-shortened session, before joining its mainland counterparts for Lunar New Year celebrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD languishes from the prior day&rsquo;s losses where firmer than expected CPI data and subsequent increased calls for more hikes from the Fed, failed to plug the greenback&rsquo;s 2018 losses. This was attributed to various factors including stagflation and deficit concerns, while some also suggested the data isn&rsquo;t likely to result to a higher peak of the Federal Funds Rate in the current hiking cycle. AUD/USD remains firmer despite a bout of indecision following Employment Change data which beat expectations but was solely driven by part-timers as Full-Time Employment contracted substantially. Elsewhere, JPY continued to strengthen with USD/JPY firmly below 107.00 as Japanese officials remain coy to the recent price action with Finance Minister Aso stating the JPY strength is not enough to require intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively flat with mild pressure seen amid the uptick in riskier assets, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement for 1yr-10yr JGBs failed to impact prices as the central kept the amounts unchanged from prior.</p>\r\n",
