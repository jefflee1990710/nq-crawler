        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP - 9 MAR 2018: Payrolls beat + wages miss = Goldilocks",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT: </strong>For the week: SPX up, DXY flat, 10y T-Note futs flat, crude up.<br /><strong>* REAR VIEW:</strong> Payrolls beat but earnings growth eases<strong>.</strong> Trump to meet NK&rsquo;s Kim in the coming months.<br /><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>Next week: US CPI, UK Spring Statement, SNB rate meeting , Norges Bank meeting, NZ GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>US JOBS REPORT:</strong> Headline payrolls was a huge beat &ndash; the largest monthly gain in 18-months &ndash; but the pace of wage growth eased. Contrary to what other indicators have suggested about the tightness of the labour market, some analysts note that a headline beat of this magnitude questions the theory that the US is at full employment, particularly as the pace of payroll growth is picking up, while wage growth has only shown fragile signs of jumping higher. But with that said, there are reasons to be positive: the solid employment growth was combined with a rise in the workweek hours, which presents upside risks for income growth, analysts say. From a policy perspective, this report will have done less for the hawks than the January data (given easier wage growth), however, it is hard to be disappointed with such a robust pace of payroll additions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> US President Trump plans to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in the first face-to-face meeting between the two nations&#39; leaders, following NK&#39;s earlier pledge in the week to pursue denuclearisation in exchange for regime safety. The encounter, Trump&#39;s first major foreign policy move, could take place in a matter of months. Reportedly Trump will not impose any preconditions on the meeting, he has said that he wants to see &ldquo;concrete steps.&rdquo; The North Koreans, meanwhile, are said to have agreed to suspend nuclear tests before the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FEDSPEAK:</strong> Fed&#39;s George (Kansas, non-voter, hawk) said risks to the US economic outlook appear to be predominately to the upside, following fiscal stimulus. The Fed should continue to hike rates and carefully calibrate its policy to lean against a potential build-up of inflationary pressure or financial market imbalances, she said. Fed&rsquo;s Evans (Chicago, non-voter, dove) suggest more caution was needed from the Fed, repeating his argument that the central bank could afford to wait until mid-year before hiking, and we could see two, three or even four hikes in the year. Fed&rsquo;s Rosengren (Boston, non-voter, hawk) was more explicit, and is firmly in the four hikes camp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX +1.7%, DJI +1.7%, Nasdaq Comp +1.8% // SECTORS: CONS DISC (XLY): +1.45%, CONS STAP (XLP): +0.50%, ENERGY (XLE): +1.88%, FINANCIALS (XLF): +2.33%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +1.34%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): +2.09%, MATERIALS (XLB): +1.70%, TECH (XLK): +1.92%, TELECOMS (XTL): -0.20%, UTLITIES (XLU): +1.3%. </strong>Major equity indices surged after the February employment situation report showed that headline payroll growth was solid, though easing average hourly wages hint that inflation pressures may not be so aggressive. The result was a &ldquo;goldilocks,&rdquo; friendly environment for stocks, and equities stayed at higher levels, with the EMINI rising to over 2780. In the background, risk was also supported by positive developments on the Korean peninsula, while the tariffs announced by the Trump administration on Thursday as certainly more benign than had been feared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI FUTURES SETTLE $1.92 HIGHER AT $62.04 PER BARREL; BRENT FUTURES SETTLE $1.88 HIGHER AT $65.49 PER BARREL. </strong>Non-oil specific factors were the driving force behind Friday&rsquo;s bounce. With the risk backdrop already supported by deescalating tensions on the Korean peninsula, watered down trade wars, and then a huge non-farm payrolls headline beat boosted risk appetite, sending crude higher. That&rsquo;s helped WTI close out the week with small gains, though still off last week&rsquo;s highs above $64. There were some oil-specific factors: oil drillers cut rigs for the first time in seven weeks (by four rigs to 796), and Libya&rsquo;s El Feel (70k BPD) remained shut according to reports. But bulls will still be questioning whether this is enough to build a fresh bullish case, some have suggested. While some expect seasonal factors to offer some support, next week we are likely to get a dose of jawboning from OPEC (it releases its monthly report on Wednesday, and the IEA releases its report on Thursday). But the broader narrative remains dominated by increasing US supply amid some suggestions that global demand has eased (for instance, in this week&rsquo;s EIA report). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES:</strong> <strong>10-YEAR T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLED 4+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-21.</strong> Bear-steepening was the theme for Treasuries, but the yields were only 1-3bps higher across the curve. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the TPLEX today was that, despite equity traders seeing the dovish side of the employment report, the bond traders didn&rsquo;t entirely agree, and the March T-Note fut settled around 4 ticks lower than pre-NFP levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD:</strong> DXY is flat on the week, trading around 90.10, though finishes the Friday down. It was a choppy pre-market, with the buck snapping higher on the headline payroll beat (313k was above the most optimistic forecast), though tumbled back down after average hourly earnings data fell to 2.6% YY from a revised down 2.8%. Meanwhile, specs have raised their long USD bets to a four-week high (week ending 6/Mar), CFTC/Reuters reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie closes out the week near highs against the US dollar slightly above 1.28; CAD has broken through the weekly range (1.2850 to 1.3025 this week) after the jobs report data provided traders relief that the sharp declines seen in January have not been repeated in February (slightly less jobs added, but unemployment slipped while participation was stable). There is only a slim chance of a hike at the April BOC, so the focus remains on the NAFTA trade negotiations, which have seemingly tuned for the better for Canada and Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR</strong> action was dictated by action from the USD side of the pair, the net effect on the day was neutral, with EUR closing out the week near 1.23, slightly lower on the week. It was similar for the <strong>JPY</strong>, which has been lingering around the 106.80 level after a dovish BOJ overnight, moving in a thin range through European and US trade. GBP, meanwhile, is about 0.3% stronger on the day against the EUR and the USD.</p>\r\n",

With the risk backdrop already supported by deescalating tensions on the Korean peninsula, watered down trade wars, and then a huge non-farm payrolls headline beat boosted risk appetite, sending crude higher. That&rsquo;s helped WTI close out the week with small gains, though still off last week&rsquo;s highs above $64. There were some oil-specific factors: oil drillers cut rigs for the first time in seven weeks (by four rigs to 796), and Libya&rsquo;s El Feel (70k BPD) remained shut according to reports. But bulls will still be questioning whether this is enough to build a fresh bullish case, some have suggested. While some expect seasonal factors to offer some support, next week we are likely to get a dose of jawboning from OPEC (it releases its monthly report on Wednesday, and the IEA releases its report on Thursday). But the broader narrative remains dominated by increasing US supply amid some suggestions that global demand has eased (for instance, in this week&rsquo;s EIA report). &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Indeed, there was something for everyone given a huge 300k+ payroll gain vs 200k or so consensus (and another 50k+ in back month upgrades for January and December), but a miss on average earnings and downgrade from 2.9% previously (which was the beat that got inflation and Fed rate hike pulses racing in early February). So, extremely volatile and somewhat erratic trade as all the numbers were digested, with Usd/Jpy edging above 107.00 and extending gains made on a combination of less geopolitical and global trade war angst. However, the headline pair eased back below the figure just before huge option expiry interest (around 4 bn) at the strike ran off and may need to close above 106.75-80 (21 DMA) to advance further into a new range (having tested 105.25 ytd lows earlier in the weak when US President Trump&rsquo;s import tariffs were really stoking protectionism policy fears). Eur/Usd is trying to keep above the 1.2300 level and stem net losses made on the March ECB meeting, as QE guidance was tweaked via dropping the can be increased again if necessary easing bias, but Draghi delivered a more cautious/balanced press conference given that core inflation remains subdued and victory on that front cannot be declared. Conversely, firmer than expected and above new Norges Bank target level Norwegian inflation could well see tightening guidance adjusted to indicate a move sooner than currently projected &ndash; Nordea thinks so and has revised its forecast to September from end of 2018 (Eur/Nok now around 9.5750 and close to lows seen last Friday when the Finance Ministry lowed the mandate to 2% from 2.5%). Usd/Cad another big mover and lower after Canada (alongside Mexico) got an exemption from the steel and aluminium taxes, albeit contingent on a NAFTA agreement &ndash; currently sub-1.2850 vs 1.3000+ 2018 highs, and despite another disappointing Canadian jobs report (headline employment just below consensus and all down to part-time workers). The Loonie may have benefited from reports of decent cross/Jpy demand, like Eur/Jpy that saw stops tripped on post-NFP buy orders. Back to G10s, the safe-haven Chf also weakened as the week progressed and risk aversion shifted to risk-on sentiment, to sit around 0.9500 vs the Greenback. Conversely, the Aud, Cad and Gbp are all ending Friday on the front foot back above 0.7800, close to 0.7300 and 1.3900 vs the Usd respectively, while the DXY is just keeping its head above 90.000. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Arguably even more confusion in FX circles where the Usd has been whipped about, and vs the Cad very erratic after a soft Canadian headline employment print and weak internals.

In addition, Asia-Pac risk appetite was further bolstered by geopolitical developments in which the South Korean National Security Office chief announced that North Korean Leader Kim is committed to denuclearization and will refrain from conducting further tests, with President Trump and North Korea&#39;s Kim to meet by May. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.3%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (+0.5%)</strong> were positive but with upside capped by a subdued commodities sector and weakness across steel names on Trump tariffs, while <strong>KOSPI (+1.0%) </strong>outperformed on the further appeasement in the Korean peninsula. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+1.1%)</strong> was underpinned amid the broad positivity in the region, while <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%)</strong> somewhat lagged after PBoC inaction led to a net weekly drain of CNY 240bln, while participants also digested US tariffs alongside mixed Chinese lending and inflation data. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with markets focused on riskier assets and after an uneventful BoJ announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BoJ kept monetary policy unchanged as expected with NIRP held at -0.1% and 10yr JGB yield target at around 0%. The decision was made by 8-1 vote with board member Kataoka the dissenter</strong>, who called for the BoJ to buy JGBs so 10yr yields or longer drop further and repeated that the BoJ should clarify it will ease further if domestic factors delay reaching price target.

In terms of tech analysis, 1.2334 seems to be capping the upside (21 DMA), while support is seen down at 1.2245 and there is also big expiry interest in close proximity with 1.8 bn running off at 1.2300 and 2.3 bn at 1.2350. The <strong>Loonie</strong> is amongst the G10 outperformers and back below 1.2900 vs the Greenback after Canada (and Mexico) got an indefinite exemption from steel and aluminium taxes pending NAFTA negotiations. However, today&rsquo;s employment report offers plenty of scope for independent impetus and there are some decent option expiries that could come into play around 1.2815-25 (1.1 bn) and 1.3000 (1.6 bn). The <strong>Aud</strong> and <strong>Nzd</strong> are off recent lows vs their US counterpart amidst the latest upturn in broad risk sentiment around 0.7800 and 0.7275, while Cable is holding just above 1.3800 and 1.3780 short term chart support despite a raft of poor UK data, and in particular a collapse in construction output. Elsewhere, <strong>Eur</strong>/<strong>Nok</strong> dropped (to sub-9.600) on stronger than expected Norwegian inflation data, with headline CPI above the new 2% target level just ahead of next week&#39;s policy meeting. Looking at the Dollar Index, yesterday&rsquo;s close above the 21 DMA at 89.820 bodes well for further recovery gains and a breach of the topside from the current circa 90.100-300 range.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further topside and downside activity in core bonds, as <strong>Bunds</strong> climbed to a 157.25 Eurex intraday high (+4 ticks), but stalled ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s 157.36 session peak and promptly recoiled to register a fresh low through 157.00 at 156.97 (-24 ticks). Market contacts note that 157.24 represents key resistance via a declining trend-line and clearly this was not convincingly cleared with little follow-through buying to trigger or threaten stops. In a similar vein, the 156.99-92 support area is providing a buffer and barrier ahead of the next major downside target at 156.79, which would be a 50% retracement of Thursday&rsquo;s move. <strong>Gilts</strong> still rangy, albeit marginally extending the upper and lower ends of Liffe trading parameters at one stage (to 121.43, -4 ticks and to 121.18, -29 ticks at the other extreme). <strong>US Treasuries</strong> a few ticks below par and braced for the big data release/risk to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> crude futures remain in close proximity to yesterday&rsquo;s lows with energy newsflow relatively light ahead of today&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count.

Market contacts note that 157.24 represents key resistance via a declining trend-line and clearly this was not convincingly cleared with little follow-through buying to trigger or threaten stops. In a similar vein, the 156.99-92 support area is providing a buffer and barrier ahead of the next major downside target at 156.79, which would be a 50% retracement of Thursday&rsquo;s move. Gilts still rangy, albeit marginally extending the upper end of Liffe trading parameters at one stage (to 121.43, -4 ticks vs -26 ticks at the other extreme). US Treasuries at few ticks below par and braced for the big data release/risk to come.</p>\r\n",

Usd/Jpy has now broken free from its recent 106.00 anchor to the upside, above 106.50 and through the 20 DMA around 106.75-80, but could be contained by hefty option expiries within a new 106.50-107.00 range (1.2 bn and 3.8 bn respectively), with the upper end not just more alluring due to the size of interest at the strike, but also perhaps compelling if US jobs data is strong (wages especially). Usd/Chf is testing 0.9500, while Eur/Usd is trading either side of the 1.2300 handle and remaining lower after Thursday&rsquo;s sharp reversal from initial post-ECB/Draghi presser peaks. In terms of tech analysis, 1.2334 seems to be capping the upside (21 DMA), while support is seen down at 1.2245 and there is also big expiry interest in close proximity with 1.8 bn running off at 1.2300 and 2.3 bn at 1.2350. The Loonie is amongst the G10 outperformers and back below 1.2900 vs the Greenback after Canada (and Mexico) got an indefinite exemption from steel and aluminium taxes pending NAFTA negotiations. However, today&rsquo;s employment report offers plenty of scope for independent impetus and there are some decent option expiries that could come into play around 1.2815-25 (1.1 bn) and 1.3000 (1.6 bn). The Aud and Nzd are off recent lows vs their US counterpart amidst the latest upturn in broad risk sentiment around 0.7800 and 0.7275, while Cable is holding just above 1.3800 and 1.3780 short term chart support despite a raft of poor UK data, and in particular a collapse in construction output. Elsewhere, Eur/Nok dropped (to sub-9.600) on stronger than expected Norwegian inflation data, with headline CPI above the new 2% target level just ahead of next week&#39;s policy meeting. Looking at the Dollar Index, yesterday&rsquo;s close above the 21 DMA at 89.820 bodes well for further recovery gains and a breach of the topside from the current circa 90.100-300 range. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This whippy price action may well continue ahead of NFP as markets also digest and reflect further on Thursday&rsquo;s adjusted ECB policy guidance.

In addition, Asia-Pac risk appetite was further bolstered by geopolitical developments in which the South Korean National Security Office chief announced that North Korean Leader Kim is committed to denuclearization and will refrain from conducting further tests, with President Trump and North Korea&#39;s Kim to meet by May. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.3%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) </strong>were positive but with upside capped by a subdued commodities sector and weakness across steel names on Trump tariffs, while <strong>KOSPI (+1.0%)</strong> outperformed on the further appeasement in the Korean peninsula. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+0.9%)</strong> was underpinned amid the broad positivity in the region, while <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%)</strong> somewhat lagged after PBoC inaction led to a net weekly drain of CNY 240bln, while participants also digested US tariffs alongside mixed Chinese lending and inflation data. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with markets focused on riskier assets and after an uneventful BoJ announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BoJ kept monetary policy unchanged as expected with NIRP held at -0.1% and 10yr JGB yield target at around 0%.</strong> The decision was made by 8-1 vote with board member Kataoka the dissenter, who called for the BoJ to buy JGBs so 10yr yields or longer drop further and repeated that the BoJ should clarify it will ease further if domestic factors delay reaching price target. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC Governor Zhou said China&#39;s economy will be less reliant on quantitative stimulus and that China may reduce reliance on money supply to boost growth. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Mofcom said it firmly opposes US trade measures and urged the US to withdraw tariffs on steel and aluminium, while it added it will take strong measures to safeguard its own interests. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 240bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 120bln net injection. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3451 (Prev. 6.3239)<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chinese CPI (Feb) Y/Y 2.9% vs. Exp. 2.5% (Prev. 1.5%); highest in over 4 years.

(Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK government officials reportedly do not see a Brexit deal being reached until next year with January viewed as the more realistic deadline. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB staff calculations on future path of monetary policy assume asset purchases of EUR 30bln in Q4, according to Euro area officials, while source reports also stated that there is a broad agreement on GC that QE will come to a halt by the end of 2018. (Newswires) Additionally, the above assumptions are seen as technical and don&rsquo;t mean a pre-commitment on extending bond buying past September</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX<a name=\"_Hlk503148913\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148890\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk503148850\"></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heightened risk-appetite spurred outflows from safe-haven <strong>JPY</strong> which underpinned <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>JPY</strong> closer towards the 107.00 handle and saw similar outperformance for <strong>JPY</strong>-crosses. Elsewhere, <strong>KRW</strong> found support on the news of North Korea&rsquo;s commitment to denuclearization but with gains limited as some scepticism remained, while <strong>USD</strong>, <strong>CAD</strong> and <strong>MXN</strong> were all firmer as some trade war concerns abated after President Trump exempted Canada and Mexico from tariffs, with Trump also said to be open on providing relief for allies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland says a win-win-win NAFTA agreement is within reach. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were subdued overnight following the confirmation of Trump&rsquo;s tariffs and as the USD held on to its gains. <strong>WTI</strong> crude futures were lacklustre after the prior day&rsquo;s losses in which prices briefly slipped below USD 60/bbl in US hours, while <strong>natgas</strong> futures were also weaker and tripped stops on a break through the prior day&rsquo;s support. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> and <strong>copper</strong> remained dampened amid a stronger greenback and weakness in Chinese metal prices which saw around 5% declines in Dalian iron ore futures and Shanghai Rebar during early trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Korea National Security Office chief Chung said that North Korean Leader Kim is committed to denuclearization and is to refrain from further tests, while he added that President Trump will meet with North Korea&#39;s Kim by May. (Newswires)<br /><br />The White House commented that it looks forward to North Korean denuclearization, but added that sanctions and pressure must remain in the meantime. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries seemed blas&eacute; about almost everything ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s payrolls data, and it was another subdued day with limited price action. For parts of the early day, Tsys were following their German counterpart during the ECB press conference. Moves were muted, but the net impact was a compression of the spread between the two. As expected, the US Treasury said it would auction $62b in 3s/10s/30s next week. US T-note futures settled up 5ticks at 120-25+.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump confirmed 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium, while the US will hold off tariffs with Canada and Mexico until NAFTA talks. US President Trump open to modifying tariffs with individual countries and will review other military allies for tariff exclusions, while he also wants a reciprocal tax programme at some point.&nbsp; (Newswires)<br />Note: There were earlier reports that AP Sources suggested tariffs are to take effect in 15 days with Canada and Mexico to be exempted indefinitely from the tariffs, while Trump had earlier commented that it is likely Canada and Mexico will not have tariffs if a deal is reached. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&#39;s George (non-voter, hawk)</strong> said it is important to keep hiking interest rates and that she expects continued moderate economic expansion and tighter labour market, while she further added that sees predominantly upside risks to her outlook.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are higher across the board after the positive lead from US where President Trump confirmed aluminium and steel tariffs, but exempted NAFTA partners and was also said to be open to providing relief for allies. In addition, Asia-Pac risk appetite was further bolstered by geopolitical developments in which the South Korean National Security Office chief announced that North Korean Leader Kim is committed to denuclearization and will refrain from conducting further tests, with President Trump and North Korea&#39;s Kim to meet by May. As such, ASX 200 (+0.4%) is positive but with upside capped by a subdued commodities sector and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) initially led the region on JPY outflows, while KOSPI (+1.3%) is the outperformer on the improved inter-Korean ties. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) is underpinned alongside the broad optimism in the region, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) lags after further PBoC inaction leading to a net weekly drain of CNY 240bln, with participants also digesting US tariffs as well as mixed Chinese lending and inflation data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the heightened risk-appetite spurred outflows from safe-haven JPY which underpinned USD/JPY closer towards the 107.00 handle and saw similar outperformance for JPY-crosses. Elsewhere, KRW found support on the news of North Korea&rsquo;s commitment to denuclearization but with gains limited as some scepticism remained, while USD, CAD and MXN are all firmer as some trade concerns abated after President Trump exempted Canada and Mexico from tariffs and amid hopes other allies may be given relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with markets focused on riskier assets and as participants await today&rsquo;s BoJ announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The BoJ is to conclude its latest 2-day policy meeting on Friday with the consensus one-sided for the central bank to maintain its QQE with Yield Curve Control and keep NIRP at -0.10%. Furthermore, Kuroda et al. are also seen to keep policy settings unchanged throughout the year with 22 out of 34 economists surveyed expecting the 10yr yield target to be kept at around 0% for the whole of 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calls for the BoJ to maintain policy have been supported by recent data releases including weaker GDP growth which slowed to a final reading of 1.6% for Q4 from 2.5% in Q3 and although January CPI rose to its highest since March 2015 at 1.4% vs. Exp. 1.3% (Prev. 1.0%), this still remains a distance to the 2% price target while Core CPI (which the BoJ have an inflation-overshooting commitment to) continues to languish below 1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the BoJ have kept no secrets in its intentions to remain on hold as BoJ Governor Kuroda recently commented that they will maintain current policy and that it is inappropriate to discuss exit now, while he also said he is cautious on raising the yield target even if yields increase and other central banks exit loose policy. However, Kuroda also dropped a mini bombshell late last week which rattled JGBs as he stated the BoJ will be considering exit around fiscal 2019 and that there could be a policy change before 2% target is reached, although he has since clarified that an exit strategy may be debated if inflation reaches 2% in 2019 and did not mean an exit would start as early as FY19. Elsewhere, Board Member and dissenter Kataoka remains too dovish for the BoJ and has continued to call for further easing to reach the price target quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable developments related to the BoJ since the last meeting include BoJ Governor Kuroda being nominated for a 2nd term which was as expected and therefore failed to impact markets, while Japan also named dovish candidates BoJ Executive Director Amamiya and reflationist academic Wakatabe for Deputy Governor roles. Elsewhere, the BoJ has on some occasions tweaked its regular bond buying operations in which reductions in the Rinban amounts have been digested by the market as somewhat of a quasi-tapering move. However, the bank has previously dismissed this and suggested that tweaks in its bond buying is not a signal of future policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no exact scheduled time for the BoJ announcement which tends to be anytime from the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0230GMT/2130EST/1030HKT, while no fireworks are expected with this announcement with the BoJ widely seen remain on pause as it has persistently done ever since 2016 when it introduced YCC.</p>\r\n",
