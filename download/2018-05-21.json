The DXY is back below 94.000 around 93.700 vs a new YTD peak at 94.064, with the Greenback&rsquo;s dollar rivals among the outperformers. EUR saw an impressive comeback from new 2018 lows vs the USD with the headline pair firmly above 1. 1750. However, 1.1800 is capping recovery gains. AUD extended relative gains vs the USD with the aid of M&amp;A-related news as US&rsquo; Harbour upped its bid for Santos to Usd10.8 bn. AUDUSD rebounded above 0.7550 where a big option expiry rolled off at the NY cut (1.8 bn), and with approx. 4bln still in play from Tuesday to Friday between 0.7450-0.7550. Note, market contacts believe that stops lie on a break above 0.7565 ahead of all that.<br />CAD pulled back a tad further from recent peaks above 1.2900 to under 1.2850 amidst elevated oil prices and more sabre-rattling from US Secretary of State Pompeo on Iran, which together seemed to nullify negativity surrounding no NAFTA deal.

The ES jumped to slightly above the 2730 level, and caught a bid towards 2740 at the cash equity open, before paring back to 2730. As the session wore on, ES was drifting between 2730-2740 in quiet trade, with the Canadians and a lot of Europe away for Whit Monday and Victoria Day respectively. The Dow, meanwhile, was generally trading around the 25,000 mark, having breached it to the upside for the first time since March. All sectors traded in positive territory, industrials and tech outperformed amid US and China temporarily holding off tariffs. The telecom sector also printed notable gains approaching 2% after Comcast (CMCSA) has said to purchase assets for Fox (FOXA) for USD 60bln if AT&amp;T (T) wins the battle with the Department of Justice for the merger with Time Warner (TWX).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In M&amp;A news, General Electric (GE) has reached a USD 11.1bln deal with Wabtec (WAB) over its transportation unit.

In stocks specifics, Micron (MU) outperformed in the NASDAQ after lifting its Q3 guidance. Agricultural names, namely Deere (DE) and Caterpillar (CAT), outperformed after US President Trump said that China agreed to purchase a massive amount of agricultural and farm products. Baidu (BIDU) lagged its peers in the NASDAQ after entering an agreement to divest its Global DU business.

The sell-off was helped by positive news on the US-China front, though ranges and volumes were thin for the session. This week the&nbsp; US will auction 2s, 5s and 7s.

US Economic Adviser Kudlow said (on Chinese negotiations) that &ldquo;the fine print, the details will come later.

Among others, 54 year old Lawyer and Private Law professor Conte has been touted to be the front-runner for the role, with M5S leader Di Maio confirming later that Conte should be taking the position. The League leader Salvini said the European Commission must not worry, though he said he would place Italy&#39;s national interest first, noting the primary goal is to reduce debt. Later, President Mattarella urged leaders of the Lower an Upper House to attend a meeting on Tuesday, and expressed concerns with M5S/League fiscal plan, and has reportedly requested more time to mull PM choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* NAFTA: US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said there are still some significant, open issues regarding NAFTA, and it might be easier to pass a &lsquo;skinny&rsquo; NAFTA deal if negotiations don&rsquo;t go as planned.

He sees the possible use of price-level targeting to offset low neutral rate. Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Non-voter, Dove) reiterated that Fed should not move too fast to raise rates.

Other supply-side issues also played a role (Shell reported that the force majeure is still in place on Bonny Light crude from Nigeria, while Forcardos exports are seen falling to 195k BPD in January vs 298k BPD in February); news that Motiva&rsquo;s Port Arthur refinery is boosting crude production after&nbsp; a crude unit restart had little lasting impact.

The last auction, in April, was poor; the line was covered just 2.61x, below the 6-auction average of 2.81x, the auction also tailed by 0.5bps and dealers were left with a larger than average chunk of the issuance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FOREX: USD: Ending Monday&rsquo;s session on a mixed footing vs G10 peers though initial momentum was seen on the back of US and China reciprocal suspension of import tariffs. The DXY is back below 94.000 around 93.700 vs a new YTD peak at 94.064, with the Greenback&rsquo;s dollar rivals among the outperformers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD: Extended relative gains vs the USD with the aid of M&amp;A-related news as US&rsquo; Harbour upped its bid for Santos to Usd10.8 bn. AUDUSD rebounded above 0.7550 where a big option expiry rolled off at the NY cut (1.8 bn), and with approx. 4bln still in play from Tuesday to Friday between 0.7450-0.7550. Note, market contacts believe that stops lie on a break above 0.7565 ahead of all that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD, NZD: The Loonie pulled back a tad further from recent peaks above 1.2900 to under 1.2850 amidst elevated oil prices and more sabre-rattling from US Secretary of State Pompeo on Iran, which together seemed to nullify negativity surrounding no NAFTA deal. The Kiwi benefited from broader USD consolidation to reclaim 0.6900+ status and recover losses made overnight on the back of a notable NZ retail sales data miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR: An impressive comeback from new 2018 lows vs the USD with the headline pair firmly above 1. 1750.However, 1.1800 is capping recovery gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY, GBP, CHF: All laggards and underperformers for the most part. USDJPY saw stops filled at 111.20 at one stage but did not really threaten barrier option supply at 111.50 or exporter offers said to be layered up to 112.00. Cable also fell to fresh YTD lows after stops down through 1.3450 amidst yet more negative Brexit news and talk of Tory in-fighting with some MPs said to be preparing for an Autumn election. However, GBPUSD is back above 1.3400. USDCHF touched parity again before drifting back down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY: Another torrid day for the Lira that plumbed fresh all-time lows vs the USD around 4.6000, with specs/investors far from confident that the CBRT and/or Government will do anything or be able to stop the rot and the next CN policy meeting still some weeks away on June 7.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>Giuseppe Conte</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 54&nbsp;year old Lawyer and Private Law professor is being touted as the front-runner to be Italian Premier. The lawyer of the supreme courts has an academic background that has flowed from the University of Rome to Yale University in the United States with stops at Cambridge University and International Kulture Institute in Vienna. Conte is the co-director of the Laterza series dedicated to &ldquo;Masters of Law&rdquo; as well as reportedly being an expert in &ldquo;company crisis management&rdquo;. Conte has held a previous position in politics, leading the commission that successfully pushed for the dismissal of councillor Franceso Bellomo whom had &ldquo;inappropriate actions&rdquo; with students in preparation for judiciary duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Giulio Sapelli</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously touted as the front runner for Premier, but now fallen to the way-side in favour of Giuseppe Conte, Giulio Sapelli is currently a professor of economic history at the University of Milan and has significant commercial experience having sat on the board of companies such at Unicredit and Eni. The professor who also teaches Political Economy is an editor of the Messenger and is a self-titled &ldquo;original voice&rdquo; among Italian economists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Giampiero Massolo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A further name that has been suggested for the position, but is now expected to be named as foreign minister is Giampiero Massolo. The Italian who was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1954 is a graduate of Political Science with a specialisation in international politics. Since May 2018 Massolo has served as Chairman of the board of directors of Fincatieri, an Italian shipbuilding company, and has held multiple political positions in the past, with the majority within the foreign affair and foreign ministry positions, and the most notable position being that of head of Italian secret services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Paolo Savona</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another candidate that has been suggested in popular media as premier previously, but now set for an economic position is that of Paolo Savona, the Italian economist and university professor. Savona has a prolific academic carer and has taught at the Universities of Perugia, Rome Tor Vergata, and Scuola Superiore di Pubblica Amministrazion. The economist has held positions in the Bank of Italy where he spent time as president, the OECD and is currently Chairman of the fintech startup Euklid Ltd. The 82 year old has written papers such as &quot;Why Democracy State and Market failed to protect the system of individual freedoms&quot; which have been critical of recent Italian Governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Giancarlo Giorgetti</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally one of the front runners for the PM position, but discarded in media due to having direct links to League and thus contradicting statements from 5SM/League. The Lombardi politician is currently the federal secretary of League and a founder of the party, whom has a softer approach to the EU than his party. The politician has also been quoted to be a strong admirer of ECB president Mario Draghi and has strong overseas political ties, particularly in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Andrea Roventini</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another professor considered for the position alongside Conte is Roventini who currently teaches at University of Verona. Chosen by Di Maio as Minister of economy post the announcement of a majority, the professor advocates investments as a driver to economic growth and debt reduction, opposes the Fornero Law (the much-revile pension plans), and has criticised austerity policies in the past.</p>\r\n",

More importantly, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced that tariffs on China would be placed on hold as discussions progress, which eased trade concerns and saw the E-mini S&amp;P gap higher by 0.6% while DJIA futures gained over 200 points. Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) benefitted from a weaker currency, while ASX 200 (-0.1%) lagged behind its regional peers with upside capped by weakness in its largest weighted financials sector as the Royal Banking Commission shifts its attention to Westpac&rsquo;s business lending practices. Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) and Hang Seng (+0.6%) outperformed with Chinese bourses the main benefactor of the reduced trade tensions following the postponement of US trade war. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued amid gains in stocks and early pressure in T-notes at the open as participants reacted to the trade-related developments, although the latter has since recovered amid reports of block buying from intraday lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations today for a net neutral daily position.

Recent reports state that the President does no see any obstacles to a Giuseppe Conte Premiership. Elsewhere the FTSE 100 hit record highs with some credit attributed to FX effects. Sectors are all in the green with outperformance in consumer discretionary and underperformance in financials. In stocks specifics, FTSE 100 heavyweight AstraZeneca (+2.3%) shares are higher amid the FDA approving a treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index has now crossed over 94.000 amidst broad Usd gains on the back of a semi-successful conclusion to the latest trade talks between the US and China. In short, concessions have been made on either side and a truce called on tariffs pending further discussions to reach a mutual agreement and ultimately rebalance the lop-sided trade accounts. For the record, 94.064 is the fresh multi-month DXY high and chart-wise 94.200-219 is the next upside target (Fib level), as latest CFTC data reveal a further reduction in short vs all counterparts aside from the Jpy and Cad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stops have finally been tripped at 111.20 vs the Dollar and the obvious nearest bullish objective is 111.50 vs a circa 111.39 peak so far where barrier option offers are reported. 111.00 now becomes support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is back under 0.6900 vs the Usd and 1.0900 vs its antipodean neighbour as significantly weaker than expected NZ retail data compounds the impact of overall Greenback strength and relative Aud resilience just above 0.7500. Hefty option expiry interest this week in Aud/Usd may also be a factor as some 6 bn are housed from 0.7450-0.7550, with 2.3 bn due to run off today by the NY cut at the upper end of that range (0.5 bn at 0.7500 and 1.8 bn at 0.7550).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both softer against the Usd and at deeper lows for 2018, as Eur/Usd slips towards 1.1700 and a major Fib just above the big figure (1.1709) and Cable briefly breaks of 1.3400 to the downside having triggered stops on a break of 1.3450.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next worst G10 performer vs the Usd as the headline pair heads back to parity, but Eur/Chf looks set to test 1.1700 without SNB intervention (verbal or actual).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie is also holding its own vs the Usd and fending off 1.2900 amidst ongoing strength in crude prices some better Canadian data of late and not that much disappointment after latest NAFTA negotiations failed to strike an accord despite progress on several issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No respite for the likes of the Lira, as Usd/Try jumps to just shy of 4.5600 and the Turkish authorities only offer words to address the situation and little tangible to arrest the currency&rsquo;s slide. Many market observers are now eyeing even more record lows for the Lira unless the CBRT takes decisive/dramatic policy action on June 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds took out another interim technical resistance level around 159.01 on their way to a fresh Eurex intraday high at 159.13, but have faded ahead of the next upside objective on some charts that lies at 159.25. However, this is all fundamental and broadly a function of mirroring the fortunes of Italian BTPs that have pared some losses from a 132.92 low (-94 ticks) to reclaim 133.00+ status, which also saw UK debt belatedly join the core safe-haven bid and extended early Liffe gains to 34 ticks at 121.93 before losing momentum. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are largely unresponsive and detached with a greater focus on consolidation after last week&rsquo;s bear-steepening and contemplating the impact of a US-China trade truce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is currently up with both WTI and Brent +0.3% in-fitting with the broader risk-picture, albeit off best levels alongside fluctuations in the USD. Energy newsflow remains light with the only commentary of note being from IEA&#39;s Birol who stated that he sees initial signs of a slowdown in oil demand and they are ready to act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold is at 5 month lows as the USD prints fresh YTD highs with demand for the safe-haven dampened by the risk tone which was also the key factor that propped up copper prices (+0.1%) overnight, especially considering the outperformance in its largest consumer China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iron ore is currently down 3%, falling for the fourth straight session on restocking delays in steel mills which has also weighed on steel prices, currently down 1%</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade mixed (FTSE 100 +0.8%, CAC 40 +0.7%, IBEX +0.3% and FTSE MIB -0.5%) with the absence of German and Swiss stocks in light of Whit Monday. Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB is underperforming yet again amid a slew of ex-dividends fused with political developments over the weekend in which the populist leaders agreed on a choice of Premier and cabinet for a coalition government. The party leaders are to meet with Italian President Mattarella this afternoon. Recent reports state that the President does no see any obstacles to a Giuseppe Conte Premiership. Elsewhere the FTSE 100 hit record highs with some credit attributed to FX effects. Sectors are all in the green with outperformance in industrials and underperformance in financials. In stocks specifics, FTSE 100 heavyweight AstraZeneca (+2.1%) shares are higher amid the FDA approving a treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index has now crossed over 94.000 amidst broad Usd gains on the back of a semi-successful conclusion to the latest trade talks between the US and China. In short, concessions have been made on either side and a truce called on tariffs pending further discussions to reach a mutual agreement and ultimately rebalance the lop-sided trade accounts. For the record, 94.064 is the fresh multi-month DXY high and chart-wise 94.200-219 is the next upside target (Fib level), as latest CFTC data reveal a further reduction in short vs all counterparts aside from the Jpy and Cad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stops have finally been tripped at 111.20 vs the Dollar and the obvious nearest bullish objective is 111.50 vs a circa 111.39 peak so far. 111.00 now becomes support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is back under 0.6900 vs the Usd and 1.0900 vs its antipodean neighbour as significantly weaker than expected NZ retail data compounds the impact of overall Greenback strength and relative Aud resilience just above 0.7500. Hefty option expiry interest this week in Aud/Usd may also be a factor as some 6 bn are housed from 0.7450-0.7550, with 2.3 bn due to run off today by the NY cut at the upper end of that range (0.5 bn at 0.7500 and 1.8 bn at 0.7550).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both around 0.35% down vs the Usd and at deeper lows for 2018, as Eur/Usd slips towards 1.1700 and a major Fib just above the big figure (1.1709) and Cable eyes a break of 1.3400 having triggered stops on a break of 1.3450.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next worst G10 performer vs the Usd as the headline pair heads back to parity, but Eur/Chf looks set to test 1.1700 without SNB intervention (verbal or actual).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie is also holding its own vs the Usd and fending off 1.2900 amidst ongoing strength in crude prices some better Canadian data of late and not that much disappointment after latest NAFTA negotiations failed to strike an accord despite progress on several issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No respite for the likes of the Lira, as Usd/Try jumps to just shy of 4.5600 and the Turkish authorities only offer words to address the situation and little tangible to arrest the currency&rsquo;s slide. Many market observers are now eyeing even more record lows for the Lira unless the CBRT takes decisive/dramatic policy action on June 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds took out another interim technical resistance level around 159.01 on their way to a fresh Eurex intraday high at 159.13, but have faded ahead of the next upside objective on some charts that lies at 159.25. However, this is all fundamental and broadly a function of mirroring the fortunes of Italian BTPs that have pared some losses from a 132.92 low (-94 ticks) to reclaim 133.00+ status, which also saw UK debt belatedly join the core safe-haven bid and extended early Liffe gains to 34 ticks at 121.93 before losing momentum. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are largely unresponsive and detached with a greater focus on consolidation after last week&rsquo;s bear-steepening and contemplating the impact of a US-China trade truce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is currently up with both WTI and Brent +0.3% in-fitting with the broader risk-picture, albeit off best levels alongside fluctuations in the USD. Energy newsflow remains light with the only commentary of note being from IEA&#39;s Birol who stated that he sees initial signs of a slowdown in oil demand and they are ready to act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold is at 5 month lows as the USD prints fresh YTD highs with demand for the safe-haven dampened by the risk tone which was also the key factor that propped up copper prices (+0.1%) overnight, especially considering the outperformance in its largest consumer China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iron ore is currently down 3%, falling for the fourth straight session on restocking delays in steel mills which has also weighed on steel prices, currently down 1%.</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, US Treasuries are largely unresponsive and detached with a greater focus on consolidation after last week&rsquo;s bear-steepening and contemplating the impact of a US-China trade truce. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

In short, concessions have been made on either side and a truce called on tariffs pending further discussions to reach a mutual agreement and ultimately rebalance the lop-sided trade accounts. For the record, 94.064 is the fresh multi-month DXY high and chart-wise 94.200-219 is the next upside target (Fib level), as latest CFTC data reveal a further reduction in short vs all counterparts aside from the Jpy and Cad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stops have finally been tripped at 111.20 vs the Dollar and the obvious nearest bullish objective is 111.50 vs a circa 111.39 peak so far. 111.00 now becomes support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is back under 0.6900 vs the Usd and 1.0900 vs its antipodean neighbour as significantly weaker than expected NZ retail data compounds the impact of overall Greenback strength and relative Aud resilience just above 0.7500. Hefty option expiry interest this week in Aud/Usd may also be a factor as some 6 bn are housed from 0.7450-0.7550, with 2.3 bn due to run off today by the NY cut at the upper end of that range (0.5 bn at 0.7500 and 1.8 bn at 0.7550).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both around 0.35% down vs the Usd and at deeper lows for 2018, as Eur/Usd slips towards 1.1700 and a major Fib just above the big figure (1.1709) and Cable eyes a break of 1.3400 having triggered stops on a break of 1.3450.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next worst G10 performer vs the Usd as the headline pair heads back to parity, but Eur/Chf looks set to test 1.1700 without SNB intervention (verbal or actual).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie is also holding its own vs the Usd and fending off 1.2900 amidst ongoing strength in crude prices some better Canadian data of late and not that much disappointment after latest NAFTA negotiations failed to strike an accord despite progress on several issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No respite for the likes of the Lira, as Usd/Try jumps to just shy of 4.5600 and the Turkish authorities only offer words to address the situation and little tangible to arrest the currency&rsquo;s slide. Many market observers are now eyeing even more record lows for the Lira unless the CBRT takes decisive/dramatic policy action on June 7.</p>\r\n",

Bunds just climbed to 158.82, +15 ticks on the day vs -6 ticks earlier, while the equivalent BTP future has been down to 133.29, -57 ticks, with the yield spread blowing out further and Italian paper also racking up fresh losses against peripheral peers like Spanish Bonos. Technically, the core German bond has effectively respected near term support on the downside and subsequently filled a chart gap, but market contacts do not see additional buying unless the 158.82-85 area is breached (last Friday&rsquo;s session peak and declining trend-line resistance).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly positive with sentiment underpinned following the conclusion of the 2nd round of US-China trade talks in which China agreed to purchase more goods to avoid a trade war, but stopped short of indicating an actual amount it plans to reduce the trade deficit by. More importantly, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced that tariffs on China would be placed on hold as discussions progress, which eased trade concerns and saw the Emini S&amp;P gap higher by 0.6% while the DJIA briefly gained over 200 points. Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) benefits from a weaker currency, while ASX 200 (-0.1%) lags behind its regional peers with upside capped by weakness in its largest weighted financials sector as the Royal Banking Commission shifts its attention to Westpac&rsquo;s business lending practices. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) and Hang Seng (+1.4%) are the outperformers alongside the reduced trade tensions following the postponement of US tariffs on China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback begins the week firmer at fresh YTD highs amid the improved tone regarding US trade policy, which effectively helps ease one of the uncertainties for the US economy that the Fed previously highlighted. The USD strength saw EUR/USD print fresh 6-month lows, while GBP/USD eyes its weakest levels for 2018 as Brexit-disarray also weighs with some Conservative MPs reported to prepare for the possibility of a snap election in autumn amid Brexit stalemate. Elsewhere, AUD/USD is firmer on cross-related flows, while USD/JPY reclaimed the 111.00 handle amid the broad positive risk tone and after trade data showed softer than expected exports and imports for Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued amid gains in stocks and early pressure in T-notes at the open as participants reacted to the trade-related developments, although the latter has since recovered amid reports of block buying from intraday lows.</p>\r\n",
