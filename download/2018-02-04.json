All sectors were red. Equities were taking their cue from the treasuries this week, with investors concerns about the bond sell-off souring risk sentiment, with the theme exacerbated today by a robust NFP report for January. There were some bright spots, however. Amazon surged after a decent earnings report released aftermarket on Thursday. However, the other tech giants didn&rsquo;t fare as well, with Alphabet and Apple both getting hit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREASURIES: US T-Note futures settle -15+ ticks at 120-23+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The curve bear-steepened, helped along by a solid NFP report which, in addition to the hawkish FOMC this week, has pushed yields on the long end higher. US30s now yield 3.10%, rising 9bps on the day, while 10s have popped above 2.85%. But despite higher yields, only 2s5s and 2s10s were steeper (2s10s just shy of 70bps, the steepest since November); 2s30s narrowed by over 6bps, 5s30s were more modestly narrower.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fedspeak:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Williams (voter) says Fed should continue raising rates gradually, expects inflation to pick up this year and next, wage growth is slowly picking up and expects it to intensify, economy performing as expected.

(Sunday Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FOREX: DXY closes the week flat after stellar NFP, hawkish Fed</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In wake of the solid NFP report, the USD saw choppy price action, with most of the gains coming against the CAD, JPY and EUR. Some desks were impressed that the post-payrolls price action wasn&rsquo;t faded as aggressively as it had been in previous reports. The DXY made its way back up towards the 89.20 level, which has acted as key support/resistance in recent days, taking the DXY back to flat levels for the week following six straight weeks of negative finishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CAD bore the brunt of dollar gains, with USDCAD popping above 1.24, though the air proved too thin for the pair at those levels, with price action settling beneath the figure. The Loonie did find some knee-jerk strength, however, after comments from Canada PM Trudeau was quoted as saying that he was prepared to walk away from NAFTA.<br /><br />The AUD and NZD were also major losers against the USD, with the former giving up on the .80 handle, and the latter finding support at .73. The JPY and CHF were sold, with the former aided by widening yield differentials after the BOJ offered to buy unlimited quantities of 10-year JGBs at 11bps (first time since January). While GBP sank, it managed to defend the 1.41 handle ahead of next week&rsquo;s BOE.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk504673747\">COMMODITIES </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count (Feb 2) 946 (Prev. 947).
