(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures traded relatively rangebound heading into the US cash open, consolidating around the key 2720 level. As the cash day got underway, the Emini broke above 2725 to session highs to test 2732.50 multiple of times but after failing to negotiate the level, fell back to the 2720 level. The highly anticipated Trump speech on drug prices was initially negative for pharma names, after the &lsquo;blueprint&rsquo; aimed to cut drug prices. Names such as ESRX &amp; CVS fell to lows; however, as Trump then announced it is to remove the &ldquo;middle men&rdquo; who have been making too much money, the stocks rebounded and extended to fresh highs, and as a result, healthcare was among the outperformers in Friday trade, along with Telecoms. In earnings, after the bell on Thursday, Nvidia (NVDA) reported earnings which beat on both the top and bottom line, but noted cryptocurrency related purchases were higher than expected; however, cloud computing orders were lower than the Street estimates. Symantec (SYMC) was also in focus as FY results are expected to be lower than analyst expectations, according to a company update. Also, an audit committee of the board opened an internal investigation after concerns were raised by employees. The co. also stated the annual report may be delayed following a probe in its financials. The slew of negative news for SYMC sent the stock to intraday declines of ~35%. &nbsp;SPX +0.17% at 2728, NDX -0.16% at 6953, DJI +0.37% at 24830.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The curve flattened to fresh decade narrows on Friday (5s30s); however, when the dust settled, Friday action was uneventful, and yields were little changed. At the end of the week, a June hike is completely priced (100%) rising around 5ppts in the week, according to the CME Fedwatch data. Heading into the cash open, Treasuries found sellers, with the 10yr T-Note future hitting session lows before ticking higher gradually as the cash equity day got underway. Nonetheless the moves were relatively range-bound as volume was hardly spectacular heading to the weekend, and following yesterday&rsquo;s softer CPI prints. * FOREX: *DXY: The index ended. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled half a tick higher at 119-13.</p>\r\n",
