However, there were later unconfirmed Twitter reports that the White House was unaware of any new developments related to tariffs on China. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese regulators are said to propose a 50% cut to car purchase tax. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond delivered the budget today in which he stated that the era of austerity is finally coming to an end and that the UK will harvest a &#39;double deal dividend&#39; if EU talks are positive, while he announced that VAT threshold for businesses will remain unchanged for an additional two years and that they will introduce a UK digital services tax on large tech giants which will raise GBP 400mln/year when adopted in April 2020.<br /><br />UK Chancellor Hammond said the higher rate threshold for income tax will increase to GBP 50,000 and that tax-free allowance for income will increase to GBP 12,500 in April 2020. UK Chancellor Hammond said will increase remote gaming duty on games of chance by 21%; will freeze short-haul air passenger duty and increase other air passenger duty in line with inflation.<br />Furthermore, Hammond said we are confident that a Brexit deal can be secured but are not complacent and are increasing the Brexit contingency funds for departments to GBP 2bln, while he also noted that they will conduct a full spending review next year and that the national living wage will rise by 4.9% in April 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OBR sees 2019 UK GDP growth at 1.6% (vs. prev. 1.3%), 2020 1.4% (vs. prev. 1.3%), 2021 1.4% (vs. prev. 1.4%), 2023 1.6%.<br />OBR sees sustained real wage growth in each of the next 5 years; 2018/19 budget deficit 1.2% of GDP (March 1.8%), 2019/20 budget deficit of less than 1.4% of GDP (March 1.6%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK DMO cut 2018/2019 gilt issuance remit by GBP 8.5bln to GBP 97.5bln vs Exp. GBP 101.0bln (Prev. GBP 106bln).<br />Furthermore, it plans to reduce net treasury bill sales by GBP 4bln in 2018/2019 vs. Exp. no change, while projection shows 2019/20 gross financing requirement of GBP 132.7bln (March projection GBP 147.4bln). (Newswires).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Chancellor Merkel confirmed she is not seeking any re-election as CDU head or CDU lawmaker and not seeking any political posts after current terms ends in 2021. Furthermore, Merkel said this is her last term as chancellor and that she will not run for chancellor if a snap election was held before 2021. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Deputy PM Kozak said the Russian government does not rule out imposing prohibitive export duty on crude and oil products. (RIA)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump attorney Giuliani said Trump might answer questions from Special Counsel Mueller after the mid-term elections, if a broader deal can be reached.

Auto makers were top movers after reports Chinese regulators are to propose a 50% car purchase tax cut, fuelling moves for General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). Cerner (CERN) traded higher on the back of an upgrade at Leerink. Shire (SHPG) made gains after reports that Takeda would divest certain treatments to gain EU approval of their merger. Boeing (BA) was a bottom mover in the wake of the Lion Air Flight crash. Video game developers Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) all moved lower today. Amazon (AMZN) moved lower through the day dragging down the wider tech sector. SPX -0.66% at 2641, NDX -2.02% at 6714, DJI -1.01% at 24440.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex ended Monday&rsquo;s session pretty much unchanged, and only marginally lower, with risk-sentiment deteriorating heading into the close triggering buying action, after the US said to plan the next China tariffs if Trump and Xi talks fail. In earlier trade, the complex saw some selling action after German Chancellor Merkel confirmed she is not seeking any re-election as CDU head and will step down as Chancellor at the end of her term. Yields were higher by less than 1bps at settlement and 2s30s and 5s30s were wider by c.1bps. Elsewhere, the US Treasury expects to borrow USD 425bln in Q4. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 2+ ticks lower at 118-30+.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, the US has temporarily blocked WTO dispute panels over metals tariffs. China is mulling a plan to cut auto taxes to offer support to the sector which has been battered by the trade conflict with the US. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* UK BUDGET: </strong>UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Hammond confirmed &lsquo;austerity will end&rsquo; on the provison that the UK will secure an exit deal with the European Union. Most of the measures announced were leaked in advance, and there was little new of note. For market folks, the key news was gilt issuance in 2018/19 will be cut by GBP 8.5bln to 97.5bln; elsewhere, the OBR nudged up growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020. The Budget is contingent on progress with Brexit, and therefore, the possibility of an emergency budget before the Spring Budget remains a possibility. Also of note, the OBR revised its estimates of tax revenue forecasts. ING observed that there was a lack of detail on how the &lsquo;ending austerity&rsquo; measures will be funded while sticking to fiscal discipline. &ldquo;It is widely believed that the government will need to look at tax rises to help square the funding circle, and there were some subtle hints of this in today&rsquo;s budget with the announcement of new taxes on tech firms,&rdquo; ING writes, &ldquo;but given the government&rsquo;s thin majority in Parliament, there is limited appetite for substantial tax rises at this point.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GERMANY:</strong> German Chancellor Merkel, during a briefing on the Hesse election results, confirmed she is not seeking any re-election as CDU head or CDU lawmaker and she is not looking at any political posts after current terms ends in 2021. She stated this is her last term as Chancellor, clarifying she will not run for the position even if snap election were needed to be held before 2021. Commenting on the votes, she said the elections in Bavaria and Hesse should serve as a turning point for the coalition government, noting she is responsible for what has happened since the federal election last year. Meanwhile, sources reported German Health Minister Jens Spahn announced candidacy to succeed Merkel as CDU party leader and CDU Secretary General Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer candidacy for the CDU chair position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May&#39;s spokesperson reported commitments are funded irrespective of a Brexit deal, adding economic interventions would be considered if economic circumstances change; he stressed they are not pursuing a Norway model for a Brexit deal. This followed from UK Chancellor Hammond&rsquo;s comments over the weekend where he noted the UK will require new tax and spending plans, as well as an extension of austerity policies in the event of a no deal Brexit, while he added BoE may also need to act by adjusting interest rates. Elsewhere, DUP spokesperson Sammy Wilson announced&nbsp; the DUP will support the budget but could oppose the government in the future if the exit deal means Northern Ireland &#39;is separated from the rest of the UK&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>An Italy&#39;s government source said that if the funds allocated for the pension reform and citizens income in 2018 budget are not fully used, they will go towards reduction of the 2.4% deficit target. Additionally, given the recent market turmoil, Il Corriere reported Italian PM Conte has asked for bank aid options if the spread worsens; Economy Minister Tria echoed the PM request noting the government is exploring various options to support banks in case of need. Note the Five-Star was said to oppose the use of state funds to rescue banks but is open to use state-guaranteed schemes to support mergers in the banking sector. Elsewhere, ANSA reported the Italian Government is set to submit the revised budget law to Parliament by Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.66% at 2641, NDX -2.02% at 6714, DJI -1.01% at 24440. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -1.86%, Materials -0.31%, Industrials -1.69%, Cons Discretionary -1.52%, Cons Staples +1.08%, Healthcare +0.18%, Financials +0.80%, Tech -1.80%, Telecoms -1.61%, Utilities +1.36%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>IBM&rsquo;s (IBM) bid for Red Hat (RHT) today caused Red Hat to shoot up by nearly 50% at highs and IBM to fall, reaching lows of -5%. Auto makers were top movers after reports Chinese regulators are to propose a 50% car purchase tax cut, fuelling moves for General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). Cerner (CERN) traded higher on the back of an upgrade at Leerink. Shire (SHPG) made gains after reports that Takeda would divest certain treatments to gain EU approval of their merger. Boeing (BA) was a bottom mover in the wake of the Lion Air Flight crash. Video game developers Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) all moved lower today. Amazon (AMZN) moved lower through the day dragging down the wider tech sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.55 LOWER AT USD 67.04/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.77 LOWER AT USD 77.34/BBL.</strong> Crude was lower on Monday; Citi explained that &ldquo;supply uncertainty is normally a bullish factor for oil prices, but it turns out that the uncertainty over the impact of pending US sanctions on Iranian crude oil inventories is less clear, as it complicates the decision making for OPEC oil ministers at the upcoming December 6 summit in Vienna,&rdquo; with Citi acknowledging risks that it plays out in a bearish fashion, &ldquo;with any wait-and-see approach by OPEC running the risk of a Q1 surplus off the seasonal drop in global oil demand.&rdquo; Citi says that OPEC&rsquo;s response to the impact of Iranian sanctions has been enough to create a modest supply/demand surplus, but that might change, possibly without warning, &ldquo;but for now it looks as though it continues to weigh on market sentiment,&rdquo; Citi says. Elsewhere on Monday, South Korea&#39;s foreign minister Kang has requested US secretary of state Pompeo for US exemptions from Iranian sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 2+ TICKS LOWER &nbsp;AT 118-30+.</strong> The Treasury complex ended Monday&rsquo;s session pretty much unchanged, and only marginally lower, with risk-sentiment deteriorating heading into the close triggering buying action, after the US said to plan the next China tariffs if Trump and Xi talks fail. In earlier trade, the complex saw some selling action after German Chancellor Merkel confirmed she is not seeking any re-election as CDU head and will step down as Chancellor at the end of her term. Yields were higher by less than 1bps at settlement and 2s30s and 5s30s were wider by c.1bps. Elsewhere, the US Treasury expects to borrow USD 425bln in Q4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Greenback has regained momentum after some consolidation and a pull-back to hold gains vs all G10 rivals bar the NZD, as the Kiwi holds close to the middle of a 0.6500-55 range amidst a broad improvement in risk sentiment after last week&rsquo;s hefty global equity market declines. However, the DXY remains off best levels circa 96.70 and last Friday&rsquo;s 96.860 peak with the ytd best at 96.984 still representing resistance ahead of 97.000 that could yet be tested given strong month end buying signals and the additional draw of SOMA and tax repatriation impulses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>Extending their outperformance and declines vs the Dollar, with Usd/Jpy just below 112.50 while the Franc never really recovered from parity, though doing better vs the Eur as the cross remained below 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP:</strong> Both more contained vs the Usd after some volatile moves in early EU trade and ending with net losses as the single currency failed to reclaim 1.1400 and Cable drifted down a bit further towards 1.2800. There were upticks as the Chancellor began delivering his budget, though this was pared back and was more or less unchanged around 1.28 by the time the Chancellor was finishing up, as was expected. The Eur was undermined by more political dynamics as German Chancellor Merkel confirmed reports that she intends to stand down after her current term ends after another blow to the CDU-CSU ruling coalition via the Hesse regional election, while ongoing Brexit uncertainty and some pre-UK budget kept the Pound pressured, alongside the aforementioned October 31 Dollar bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CAD: </strong>The Aud remained top-heavy ahead of 0.7100 vs its US counterpart throughout and perhaps wary of further CNH weakness towards 6.9700 even though the PBoC set the Usd/Cny lower overnight, while the Loonie never really recovered from 1.3100+ lows and retreated a bit further to around 1.3125 against the backdrop of soft crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>The Lira gave up some of its gains seen after last week&rsquo;s hawkish CBRT meeting (in word rather than deed), after Mexican President Elect Obrador said his government will build two new runways at a military base and upgrade the current airport, noting the decision will save the federal government around 100bln pesos. Usd/Try moved higher consolidating just above 5.5400. Elsewhere, the Real handed back initial upside through 3.6000 vs the Usd on Bolsonaro&rsquo;s Brazilian election win and the Peso suffered additional losses over 19.8000 after Mexico scrapped its plans to build a new airport.</p>\r\n",

However, the DXY remains off best levels circa 96.710 and last Friday&rsquo;s 96.860 peak with the ytd best at 96.984 still representing resistance ahead of 97.000 that could yet be tested given strong month end buying signals and the additional draw of SOMA and tax repatriation impulses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending their outperformance and declines vs the Dollar, with Usd/Jpy up through 112.50 and closer to heavy option expiry interest sitting between 112.65-70 (2BN), albeit not in time for the NY cut, while the Franc never really recovered from parity, though doing better vs the Eur as the cross remained below 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both more contained vs the Usd after some volatile moves in early EU trade and ending with net losses as the single currency failed to reclaim 1.1400 and Cable drifted down a bit further towards 1.2800. The Eur was undermined by more political dynamics as German Chancellor Merkel confirmed reports that she intends to stand down after her current term ends after another blow to the CDU-CSU ruling coalition via the Hesse regional election, while ongoing Brexit uncertainty and some pre-UK budget kept the Pound pressured, alongside the aforementioned October 31 Dollar bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aud remained top-heavy ahead of 0.7100 vs its US counterpart throughout and perhaps wary of further CNH weakness towards 6.9700 even though the PBoC set the Usd/Cny lower overnight, while the Loonie never really recovered from 1.3100+ lows and retreated a bit further to around 1.3125 against the backdrop of soft crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recovery gains for the Lira after last week&rsquo;s hawkish CBRT meeting (in word rather than deed) as Usd/Try slipped just below 5.5100, but the Real handed back initial upside through 3.6000 vs the Usd on Bolsonaro&rsquo;s Brazilian election win and the Peso suffered additional losses over 19.8000 after Mexico scrapped its plans to build a new airport.</p>\r\n",

Gilts just off a fresh intraday base of 122.64 (-45 ticks) vs Bunds at 160.20 from 160.06 at one stage (-81 ticks) and the UST curve up to almost &frac12; point adrift and steeper.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.2%) were subdued with the mainland worst hit following softer Industrial Profit growth and a net liquidity drain by the PBoC, while this week&rsquo;s key earnings including China&rsquo;s big 4 banks further added to the tentativeness.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are kicking off the week on the front-foot, despite the downbeat tone in Asia. As such, Eurostoxx 50 (+1.0%) is supported mostly by the financial sector following optimistic earnings from HSBC (+5.0%), which saw the likes of Intesa Sanpaolo (+3.7%), Deutsche Bank (+1.4%) and RBS (+3.0%) higher in tandem.

However, the single currency has been whippy between 1.1360-1.1415 trading parameters amidst reports that German Chancellor Merkel will not stand for re-election as CDU head after serving out the current term, but would like to remain as Chancellor in wake of another chastening regional result for the coalition. However, Eur/Usd has bounced firmly ahead of hefty option expiry interest at the 1.1350 strike (1.5 bn) and a sharp rally in EU auto stocks on China&rsquo;s cut in purchase tax to 5% from 10%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY - Victims of the improvement in risk appetite, with the Franc just off parity-plus lows and Jpy retreating from circa 111.80 to 112.25 amidst similar reversals in cross pairings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - Conversely, the Scandi crowns are registering decent gains vs the Eur amidst the upturn in risk sentiment and following last week&rsquo;s Riksbank and Norges Bank policy meetings that keeps them well on track to normalise rates ahead of the ECB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM- Broad gains in regional currencies vs the Usd, but with the Mxn a notable underperformer on disappointment that Mexico will not pursue plans to build a new airport.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent are both down by around 0.3% amid concerns that global growth is slowing, particularly in China, and that ongoing market uncertainties are leading to a downward pressure on prices. Of note with the Iranian sanctions, it is imminent is that India, China and Turkey, three of Iran&rsquo;s top five customers, are resisting pressure to completely end purchases; citing a lack of worldwide supply for this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over in the metals market, gold is down by 0.2% as the yellow metal moves inversely to the USD, although still in a relatively tight USD 5/oz range as market concerns still remain over upcoming US earnings, trade tensions and a slowdown in global economic growth.

Indeed, after breaching a 50% Fib around 160.56 and then 160.50, last Friday&rsquo;s 160.22 low has also been eclipsed through an interim support area between 160.35-33 to a base of 160.10 (-73 ticks), and bears will now be targeting 160.00.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Gilts have fallen in sympathy to 122.69 (-40 ticks) and even hitherto resilient US Treasuries are just off fresh overnight session lows and in negative territory, albeit mildly.</p>\r\n",

As such, Eurostoxx 50 (+0.8%) is supported mostly by the financial sector following optimistic earnings from HSBC (+4.6%), which saw the likes of Intesa Sanpaolo (+3.2%), Deutsche Bank (+1.7%) and RBS (+4.1%) higher in tandem. Elsewhere, Europe&rsquo;s auto stocks index (+3.9%) rose sharply following reports that Chinese regulators are said to propose a 50% cut to car purchase tax. Subsequently, DAX 30 outperforms as the index is buoyed by shares in Daimler (+5.4%), BMW (+5.2%) and Volkswagen (+5.1%). Finally, Euronext is experiencing problems in which the CAC and AEX remain halted until the technical glitches are resolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD - All performing well vs their US counterpart to varying degrees, with the Kiwi outpacing and bouncing firmly from overnight lows to 0.6555 vs circa 0.6500 amidst a broad upturn in risk sentiment, while Aud/Usd struggles around 0.7100 and the Loonie pivots 1.3100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR - Both choppy, but the Pound relatively rangebound ahead of the UK budget and following mixed data, as Cable hovers above 1.2800 within a tight 1.2805-40 range. However, the single currency has been whippy between 1.1360-1.1415 trading parameters amidst reports that German Chancellor Merkel will not stand for re-election as CDU head after serving out the current term, but would like to remain as Chancellor in wake of another chastening regional result for the coalition. However, Eur/Usd has bounced firmly ahead of hefty option expiry interest at the 1.1350 strike (1.5 bn) and a sharp rally in EU auto stocks on China&rsquo;s cut in purchase tax to 5% from 10%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY - Victims of the improvement in risk appetite, with the Franc just off parity-plus lows and Jpy retreating from circa 111.80 to 112.25 amidst similar reversals in cross pairings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK - Conversely, the Scandi crowns are registering decent gains vs the Eur amidst the upturn in risk sentiment and following last week&rsquo;s Riksbank and Norges Bank policy meetings that keeps them well on track to normalise rates ahead of the ECB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM- Broad gains in regional currencies vs the Usd, but with the Mxn a notable underperformer on disappointment that Mexico will not pursue plans to build a new airport. Looking ahead, it will be interesting to see how the Brl reacts to Bolsonaro&rsquo;s resounding 2nd round win vs a flattish close on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds continue to underperform after a brief rebound on the initial Merkel reports, and aside from the drag related to Italian BTPs, which have now been up to 122.63 (+131 ticks), the 10 year German bond is also feeling the weight of a firmer rebound in the Dax and other stock markets with some technical selling also in the mix. Indeed, after breaching a 50% Fib around 160.56 and then 160.50, last Friday&rsquo;s 160.22 low has also been eclipsed through an interim support area between 160.35-33 to a base of 160.10 (-73 ticks), and bears will now be targeting 160.00. &nbsp;Meanwhile, Gilts have fallen in sympathy to 122.69 (-40 ticks) and even hitherto resilient US Treasuries are just off fresh overnight session lows and in negative territory, albeit mildly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent are both down by around 0.3% amid concerns that global growth is slowing, particularly in China, and that ongoing market uncertainties are leading to a downward pressure on prices. Of note with the Iranian sanctions, it is imminent is that India, China and Turkey, three of Iran&rsquo;s top five customers, are resisting pressure to completely end purchases; citing a lack of worldwide supply for this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over in the metals market, gold is down by 0.2% as the yellow metal moves inversely to the USD, although still in a relatively tight USD 5/oz range as market concerns still remain over upcoming US earnings, trade tensions and a slowdown in global economic growth. Elsewhere, the head of the Japanese steel industry group stated that he is worried about the weakening Chinese economy. Copper&rsquo;s gains have been cut after a slowdown in industrial profits indicate that China&rsquo;s economy is losing steam, affecting demand for the metal.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.1%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) both opened positive with the healthcare sector leading the broad upside in Australia, while the Japanese benchmark was less decisive with earnings dominating news flow. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.8%) are subdued with the mainland underperforming following softer Industrial Profit growth and a net liquidity drain by the PBoC, while this week&rsquo;s key earnings including China&rsquo;s big 4 banks further add to the tentativeness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are quiet as the DXY holds steady near the 96.50 level and with its major counterparts also uneventful with EUR/USD eyeing a retest of the 1.1400 handle to the upside, while GBP/USD is lacklustre after last week&rsquo;s Brexit-related losses in which the pair briefly slipped to below 1.2800. Elsewhere, antipodeans have held on to a majority of Friday&rsquo;s upside following a rebound in commodity prices and firmer fix by the PBoC, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are slightly choppy amid a similar flimsy risk tone in the region.<br /><br />Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat as prices reflect the indecisiveness across stocks and amid a lack of BoJ presence in the market today.</p>\r\n",
