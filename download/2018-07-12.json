        "content": "<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Commerce Ministry stated that so far they have had no contact with the US about restarting negotiations. Elsewhere, there were also comments from US President Trump that US is in a nasty trade battle with China but added they will negotiate a fair trade deal if that&#39;s possible and that he expects something very good with China in the end. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK published its Brexit White Paper which stated there will be more barriers to the UK&#39;s access to the EU&#39;s market and that a facilitated customs arrangement will be as if Britain was in a combined territory with the EU. The White Paper also plans to diverge from EU rules for services which means a lower level of access after Brexit and abandons the idea of mutual recognition for financial services, while it will end the free movement of people and the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice over Britain post-Brexit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU chief Brexit negotiator Barnier will discuss White Paper with member states and debate with the UK next week, while there were also reports the European Parliament&#39;s Brexit Steering Group welcomed the UK&#39;s White Paper, particularly that the UK is proposing an Association Agreement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is said to warn UK PM May that a soft Brexit would probably kill potential future trade deal between UK and US as they would be dealing with EU instead of UK. (The Sun)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB minutes stated that the progress toward a sustained adjustment of inflation path is substantial and are confident that adjustment would continue. ECB minutes added that open ended character of interest rate guidance should be emphasized and that given the uncertainty, it is prudent to leave the end of QE conditional on incoming data. Furthermore, the minutes also noted that policymakers were unanimous in support of policy proposals. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French finance minister Le Maire said if the US trade war persists, EU will take new decisions and commented that specific deal on autos with the US threatens jobs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US President Trump said he is in talks with the EU and will meet them next week on trade. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Powell (Chair, Neutral) reiterated the Fed is hearing concerns regarding trade wars and that sustained high tariffs could be a negative for the economy. Furthermore, Powell said low wage growth is a puzzle, but added the labour market is strong by any measure and the US economy is in a really good place. (Marketplace)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Mester (Voter, Hawk) said the US economy justifies 2 more rate hikes this year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Harker (Non-Voter, Dove) stated he welcomes 4 rate hikes this year if inflation accelerates, but added he still sees 3 hikes this year and that the Fed rate hikes could lift policy rate to 3.00%-3.25%. Furthermore, Harker said inflation is moving towards the 2% target and noted the inflation goal is symmetric and is comfortable moving to 2.5%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said many of the US trade talks with China have broken down, while he earlier commented that the US is available to discuss with China to the extent that the country wants to make changes on trade and that the US is very focused on retaliatory trade measures and how to resolve them. Furthermore, Mnuchin also commented that NAFTA negotiations are a priority following Mexico&rsquo;s elections. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US CPI MM, SA (Jun) 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.2% (Prev. 0.2%). (Newswires)<br />US CPI YY, NSA (Jun) 2.9% vs. Exp. 2.9% (Prev. 2.8%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delta (DAL) beat on the top and bottom lines, hiked its dividend by 1%, though cut guidance; quarterly profits were hit by rises in fuel costs, though DAL said it has had early success in addressing these. Papa John&rsquo;s (PZZA) rose after founder and President stepped-down after allegedly using a racial slur on a media call. ConocoPhilips (COP) boosted its share buyback authorisation by $9bln taking it to $15bln, and is making progress in trimming debt. Tesla (TSLA) was lower after a downgrade at UBS, and news that it hit 200k cars produced, meaning lower tax credit for buyers. In M&amp;A news, Semiconductor Broadcom (AVGO) was hit as it nears a deal to buy CA Technologies (CA) for almost $19bln, it&rsquo;s first major M&amp;A since the Trump Administration blocked its $117bln deal to buy Qualcomm (QCOM) in March; investors were sceptical, with AVGO down 14%, though CA rose 18%. The battle for SKY LN assets has picked up after Comcast (CMCSA) raised its offer to $34bln; the UK government ok&rsquo;d Fox&rsquo;s (FOXA) remedies for its Sky bid, clearing the path for Fox/Comcast to battle it out. Elsewhere, EU antitrust regulators are set to approve the Linde (LIN GY)-Praxair (PX) $83bln merger, sources reported. Aetna (AET) and CVS Health (CVS) were up on reports that the DOJ will not challenge the merger of the two, according to research firm Reorg. Wallmart (WMT) is considering a bid from Capital One Financial (COF) for its credit card business, sending COF higher on Thursday, while Walmart&#39;s current partner Synchrony (SYF) fell. SPX +0.9% at 2798, NDX +1.7% at 7366, DJI +0.9% at 24926.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The complex moved sideways on Thursday. The yield curve modestly bear-flattened with most of the yields higher by under 2bps. Major curve spreads saw another session of flattening by c.1bps; 2s10s fell to as low as 25bps for another fresh low, while 2s30s and 5s30s also narrowed by 2bps and 1bps respectively. US 10YR T-notes futures (u8) settled 3 ticks lower at 120-05.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP - 12 July 2018: Markets go back to ignoring trade wars",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities up, Treasuries flat, crude mixed, Dollar Index flat.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Mnuchin says most talks with China have broken down; ECB minutes show broad support for tapering; US CPI mostly in line; Fed chair Powell reveals little new.<br />* COMING-UP: Chinese Trade Balance, Japanese Industrial Output, US University of Michigan Sentiment, BoE&#39;s Cunliffe, Fed&#39;s Bostic and ECB&#39;s De Guindos; WFC, PNC, JPM and C earnings.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the US is very focused on retaliatory trade measures and how to resolve them, adding that the US is monitoring the impact of its trade policies. He also said that he is available to discuss trade with the Chinese, should they want to, saying that the Trump administration is focussed on free and fair trade, but added many of the US trade talks with China have broken down. Chinese vice trade minister Wang, who on Wednesday called for talks to de-escalate trade tensions, said talks would be pointless if the US constantly keeps chopping and changing its position. Mnuchin, meanwhile, will visit the EU later this month for talks with the EU&rsquo;s Juncker. On NAFTA, Mnuchin said negotiations are a big priority now that Mexico&rsquo;s elections are out of the way. Elsewhere, French finance minister Le Maire says if the US trade war persists, EU will take new decisions, adding that specific deal on autos with the US threatens jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>The accounts of its June meeting showed broad support for a dovish approach to tapering asset purchases and bring QE to an end this year, as well as to introduce forward guidance on rates to anchor expectations of the ECB&rsquo;s first rate hike of the cycle. ING said the assessment of the outlook for the economy showed remarkable optimism, with the central bank confident that the expansion will remain solid and broad-based, continuing at an above potential pace, though the ECB stated that downside risks could be presented by global factors. &ldquo;Reading between the lines of the minutes, the ECB tries to give the impression that the de-facto announcement of an end to QE at the June meeting was the most normal thing in the world, a natural evolution of previous recalibrations,&rdquo; ING said. &ldquo;While back in June not everyone would have agreed with the ECB, the reactions after the announcement seem to prove the ECB right. With hindsight.&rdquo; ING believes the ECB will find it difficult to end QE this year given the risks, but said that the broad majority of ECB members seems determined to end QE, and would like to return to interest rates as the main policy tool. &ldquo;This, however, does not necessarily mean that they will be in a hurry to hike rates.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed chair Powell gave an interview to Marketplace where he rattled off his familiar comments: Fed is hearing concerns regarding trade wars &ndash; sustained high tariffs could be a negative for the economy. Powell said low wage growth is a puzzle, but the labour market is strong by any measure, and the US economy is in a really good place. Powell did caution that it would be a policy challenge if inflation were to rise while the economy was weakening. On fiscal policy, Powell said it will likely support the economy over the next three years. Fed&#39;s Mester (Hawkish) said the US economy justifies 2 more rate hikes this year. Fed&rsquo;s Harker (Non-Voter) noted inflation is moving towards the 2% target and defined the inflation goal symmetric; he said he is comfortable with inflation moving to 2.5% He said to welcome 4 rate hikes this year if inflation accelerates though his base case remains for 3 hikes. He believes Fed rate Hikes could lift policy rate to 3% - 3.75% and warned gains in services inflation are something to watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CPI </strong>posted a 0.1% MM gain in June, below expectations of 0.2%, Core CPI was in line at 0.2%. The y/y figures were as expected at 2.9% and 2.3% respectively, with the core at &lsquo;a level equal to its highest increase since prior to the recession&rsquo; according to UBS. In the core measures, softer apparel prices and a fall in hotel room rates were offset by higher prices in the used car sector and in medical services. Gasoline prices SA ticked up by 0.5%, moderating from the 3% increase seen in April. Overall the latest release appears to be &lsquo;consistent with continued gradual increase in interest rates&rsquo; with the latest release having little effect on the medium-term inflation view, UBS said. Pantheon Macroeconomics, meanwhile, argued that the Fed is hiking rates because of the labour market and not because of the current inflation outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US WEEKLY CLAIMS: </strong>Jobless Claims dropped to 214k, consensus was for 226k, bringing the 4-week moving average to 223k (Prev. 225k) and thus signalling a healthy labour market. The effect of tariffs does not seem to be reflected in the measure just yet though, Pantheon Macroeconomics said, this was cited as a potential factor behind their move higher seen in the previous weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.9% at 2798, NDX +1.7% at 7366, DJI +0.9% at 24926. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -0.1%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.7%, Energy: +0.2%, Financials: +0.2%, Health Care: +1.1%, Industrials: +1.1%, Materials: +0.2%, Telecoms: +0.5%, Tech: +1.8%, Utilities: +0.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS:</strong> Delta (DAL) beat on the top and bottom lines, hiked its dividend by 1%, though cut guidance; quarterly profits were hit by rises in fuel costs, though DAL said it has had early success in addressing these. Papa John&rsquo;s (PZZA) rose after founder and President stepped-down after allegedly using a racial slur on a media call. ConocoPhilips (COP) boosted its share buyback authorisation by $9bln taking it to $15bln, and is making progress in trimming debt. Tesla (TSLA) was lower after a downgrade at UBS, and news that it hit 200k cars produced, meaning lower tax credit for buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>Semiconductor Broadcom (AVGO) was hit as it nears a deal to buy CA Technologies (CA) for almost $19bln, it&rsquo;s first major M&amp;A since the Trump Administration blocked its $117bln deal to buy Qualcomm (QCOM) in March; investors were sceptical, with AVGO down 14%, though CA rose 18%. The battle for SKY LN assets has picked up after Comcast (CMCSA) raised its offer to $34bln; the UK government ok&rsquo;d Fox&rsquo;s (FOXA) remedies for its Sky bid, clearing the path for Fox/Comcast to battle it out. Elsewhere, EU antitrust regulators are set to approve the Linde (LIN GY)-Praxair (PX) $83bln merger, sources reported. Aetna (AET) and CVS Health (CVS) were up on reports that the DOJ will not challenge the merger of the two, according to research firm Reorg. Wallmart (WMT) is considering a bid from Capital One Financial (COF) for its credit card business, sending COF higher on Thursday, while Walmart&#39;s current partner Synchrony (SYF) fell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLES 3 TICKS LOWER AT 120-05. </strong>The complex moved sideways on Thursday. The yield curve modestly bear-flattened with most of the yields higher by under 2bps. Major curve spreads saw another session of flattening by c.1bps; 2s10s fell to as low as 25bps for another fresh low, while 2s30s and 5s30s also narrowed by 2bps and 1bps respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 30-YEAR AUCTION REVIEW: </strong>Thursday&rsquo;s auction of 30s was fairly average, with metrics close to recent averages; the auction saw a tail of 0.4bps at a high yield of 2.958% (lowest since January), cover was at 2.34x (the lowest since February). Indirects takedown was the lowest since April, leaving dealers the largest since April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q8) SETTLE $0.05 LOWER AT $70.33; BRENT (U8) SETTLES $1.05 HIGHER AT $74.45. </strong>Crude prices were mixed, after Wednesday&rsquo;s slide. While Brent was outperforming, the term structures were moving bearishly, with the front Brent contracts (U8/V8) entering contango briefly, settling at 1 cent (from 7 cents yesterday); for WTI, the Q8/U8 backwardation narrowed by 54 cents. In addition to the chunky supply coming back onto the market from Libya, and ongoing global trade tensions, Reuters&rsquo; John Kemp suggested that hedge funds might have been booking profits after a year-long rally. Additionally, there has been some suggestions that the US will allow waivers for countries to import Iranian crude, potentially lessening the impact of a &lsquo;supply crunch&rsquo;. Brent seemed to look through today&rsquo;s news from Libya, where the El Feel (with a capacity of 100k+ BPD) was to restart for the first time since February, which Citi says could suggest the rebound in supply could extend beyond simply reversing the impact of the more recent port closures. In its monthly report, the IEA issued fresh warnings that global crude spare capacity is facing risks of being stretched by prolonged supply outages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The DXY got to within spitting distance of the 95.00 handle, but found the air thin as it approached the highs and fell back to within a c.94.65-c.94.80 range, slightly lower on the day, with risk appetite tentatively returning on Wednesday. CPI data failed to have a lasting impact on FX/rates. Ahead of next week&rsquo;s semi-annual testimony, Fed chair Powell stayed off the subject of monetary policy in comments today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>There has been much debate about the yen&rsquo;s supposedly strange behaviour in recent sessions, not reacting/reacting in a delayed fashion to bouts of risk. On Wednesday, a break of the three-year trend resistance around 111.50 has provided the platform for USDJPY to bounce to above 112.50 at one point today. The theory from the folks at UBS is that the market has been short USDJPY in the last couple of weeks in anticipation of a fall in equities; that fall ultimately failed to materialise, and shorts became nervous as the USDJPY approached the 11.40-60 pivot, and once it cleared, it brought about a short-covering squeeze higher. From a technical perspective, UBS notes that key levels of resistance now are around 112.50 and 113.00, and has suggested longs near 111.60-80 targeting those levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Cable has managed to return to the 1.3220 area once again, and has done little in the last few sessions to break either below that level, or about meaningfully above 1.3240. Desks still are focusing on downside vulnerabilities, with Scotia pointing out that Sterling&rsquo;s failure against the 40-day moving average earlier in the week leaves the pound looking prone to a little more softness. Intraday trend momentum signals are aligned negatively, Scotia said, but the longer run signals are flat (daily) and weekly price action hints at some potential for a broader base to develop, and it looks for losses to stabilize between 1.3050/1.3150. Like at the BOE HQ, politics are likely to be the driving factor of sterling moves, more than economic fundamentals. ING has argued that if the EU is comforted by the latest White Paper, we could see GBP up to 1.33-1.34 (which some policymakers have tentatively suggested), and on the flip side, if &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit probabilities pick up, a slide beneath 1.30 could be on the cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>A better risk tone and stabilisation in commodities helped the likes of the Aussie pare back some of Wednesday&rsquo;s slide, while AUDJPY jumped to the highest since mid-June, helped by rising stocks, and yen declines. With that said, traders are cognizant of trade war risks, and some desks prefer to look to play the Aussie to the downside as it hits recent highs, with any escalation of trade wars likely to lend strength to the USD, to the Aussie&rsquo;s detriment; the RBA and Fed also are on divergent courses, which would support AUDUSD downside, analysts have said.</p>\r\n",

USD 28.7bln in new cash will be raised, given the USD 40.3bln maturing mid-month, according to TD Securities. Recent auctions in the 30-year sector have been well-received, with the last four auctions all stopping-through (only three of the last 12 30-year auctions has seen a tail, suggesting that demand remains firm for long-dated debt). Analysts at SocGen suggest that the decent performance in the long-end can be attributed to corporations rushing to increase their pension plan contributions before the September deadline, to take advantage of higher tax deductions. However, there are some negatives: benchmark 30-year yields are beneath the stop-out rate of the last five auctions, which SocGen says will likely warrant some concession heading into Thursday&rsquo;s sale. Additionally, the bank argues that the sector remains rich on the curve, with 5s30s near the lowest levels in over a decade. On the flip side, current 30s are cheap on the spline versus the older 30s relative to the previous two auction cycles.</p>\r\n",

DXY currently back down around 94.750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A rather belated decline in the Franc if the rationale was less risk aversion around US-China trade wars and/or NATO, but nevertheless the move was pronounced vs both the Usd and Eur as the former rallied over parity and the cross climbed to 1.1700. Stop buying was reported in the latter from 1.1660 upward, while the headline pair hit a ytd peak at 1.0057 on May 10. Conversely, the Jpy pared some losses vs the Greenback having been the big underperformer overnight to trade back over 112.50 vs 112.60 at one stage, although the safe-haven remains vulnerable to any further improvement in overall sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All ending Thursday&rsquo;s session on the front foot vs their US peer, with the Aud retesting 0.7400, Loonie down towards the base of a 1.3150-1.3220 range and not adversely impacted by a stagnant Canadian new homes price index, while the Kiwi marginally extended its wingspan to touch 0.6780.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another beneficiary of the post-US data Usd downturn as Cable climbed to 1.3245 and largely shrugged off the Brexit White Paper that was largely as leaked via the UK press or reported via other outlets ahead of its official publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choppy trade within 1.1650-95 parameters vs the Usd, but the single currency recovering from a post-ECB minutes dip (main takeaway a desire to underline the open-ended nature of policy guidance) to sit around the base of hefty option expiry interest situated between 1.1675 and 1.1700 (2.5 bn in total).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An outperformer vs its Nok rival and the Eur on a softer than expected Swedish CPIF y/y print and dovish elements of the latest Riksbank minutes (ie Jansson&rsquo;s view that the timing of a rate hike, signalled for approaching the end of 2018, is more likely to be pushed back than brought forward). Nok/Sek up near 1.0950 and Eur/Sek close to 10.3700.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) were positive in which the latter coat-tailed on upside in USD/JPY and with Softbank among the biggest gainers after US investment fund Tiger Global took a stake of over USD 1bln in the Co., while broad gains were also seen in Australia aside from commodity-related sectors following recent weakness in the complex including a near-5% drop in crude. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+2.1%) conformed to the improved risk tone after the PBoC conducted repo operations for the 1st time in over a week and amid continued positive rhetoric regarding A-shares valuations which were said to be at historic lows. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with price action uneventful throughout the session amid focus on riskier assets and with the 20yr auction results largely ignored, despite showing firmer demand and higher accepted prices than previous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>PBoC injected CNY 30bln via 7-day reverse repos for a net neutral daily position. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.6726 (Prev. 6.6234)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>White House aide stated that US has conducted several high-level talks with China and are open to further discussions. However, there were later conflicting reports that talks between US-China have collapsed following the fresh tariff list and that there were no immediate plans to restart discussions. Thereafter, in early European trade the Chinese Commerce Ministry said that so far they have had no contact with the US about restarting negotiations (Newswires/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Bank of Korea kept the 7-Day Repo Rate unchanged at 1.50% as expected, with the decision not unanimous as board member Lee Il-Houng dissented. BoK Governor Lee commented that GDP growth forecast for 2018 was lowered to 2.9% from 3.0% and stated that recent depreciation in KRW against USD was rapid. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>UK PM May is said to propose a looser relationship with the EU regarding financial services which would reduce access to the European market for UK-based financial firms post-Brexit. (FT) Hardline Tory Brexiters are looking to try to force UK PM May to publish a rival draft of the white paper drawn up by David Davis in the run-up to last week&rsquo;s Chequers summit, which Downing Street ditched. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>UK RICS Housing Survey (Jun) 2 vs. Exp. -4 (Prev. -3). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>US President Trump was reportedly threatening to withdraw from NATO, as according to sources, but this was denied later in trade, with the same source saying that Trump had criticized the alliance today in an unscheduled session. In a press conference US President Trump said he is in talks with the EU and will meet them next week on trade, adding their commitment to NATO is very strong (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Riksbank minutes: Measures of underlying inflation indicate that inflationary pressures are still moderate, which, according to several members, raises questions about the development of inflation in the long-run. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Fed&#39;s Williams (Voter, Hawkish) said despite strength in equities and house prices, he is not seeing risk taking in financial system of last decade and stated that employers struggling to fill job vacancies which signals a strong economy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>European equities are currently mixed, with the Euro Stoxx 50 essentially flat on the day and consolidating following the losses seen in yesterday&rsquo;s trade. Equities were slightly choppy amid source reports suggesting that US President Trump was criticising NATO and had threatened to drop out, reports thereafter suggested that pulling out is not on the cards.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>The IBEX (-0.2%) and FTSE MIB (-0.3%) are in the red, weighed on by bank stocks with exposure to Turkish assets (BBVA -0.7%) alongside broad-based financial underperformance (UniCredit -1.0%, Banca Generali -1.1%, CaixaBank -1.1%) and possible strike action at Fiat&rsquo;s (-1.0%) Melfi plant over Cristiano Ronaldo&rsquo;s transfer cost. Telecom Italia (-1.3%) is also underperforming after a price target cut at Barclays, and is weighing on the telecoms sector, which is currently negative for the day.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>The FTSE is outperforming on the back of betting names such as Paddy Power Betfair (+2.7%) benefitting from England&rsquo;s exit from the World Cup.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Updates on Sky (+1.8%) where Comcast have tabled a GBP 26bln offer to buy the co., moving swiftly to trump Fox&rsquo;s GBP 24.5bln offer earlier in the week.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>It remains rather begrudging or at least lacking in conviction, but Bunds and Gilts did stretch the upper end of their intraday ranges to 162.68 and 123.09 (+15 and +16 ticks) before topping out again. No real rationale, though this did coincide with a downturn in BTPs and other peripheral bonds, which looks supply-related in part at least. Conversely, US Treasuries remain depressed and close to overnight session lows ahead of a slew of data, highlighted by CPI that may be skewed to the upside vs consensus in wake of Wednesday&rsquo;s above forecast PPI. Weekly claims also due after last Friday&rsquo;s mixed NFP report and the last leg of this week&rsquo;s auctions in the shape of $14 bn 30 year debt. Note also, some Fed speak via Kashkari and Harker.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>JPY/AUD - Flanking the G10 list of worst and best performers on less investor angst over a full blown US-China trade war even though the latter (via a Commerce Ministry official) has scotched speculation that the 2 sides have been talking already. Short covering also a factor behind the broad bounce in risk assets and resultant reduced demand for safe-havens like the Jpy that finally yielded to pressure below 111.00 vs the Usd, as the pair broke higher and into a fresh range overnight. Stops are said to have been tripped through 111.50 and major trend-line resistance around 111.57 that had been capping the upside, with more triggered when 112.00 was breached on the way to a circa 112.40 peak. Conversely, the Aud has been able to stem further losses and rebound ahead of 0.7350 vs its US counterpart, although the 0.7400 handle remains elusive.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>CHF - Mildly softer vs the Usd as the Franc slips through 0.9950, but still not really behaving like a true port in a currency storm given strict SNB intervention to prevent the highly valued Chf getting too strong.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>NZD/GBP/EUR/CAD - All around 0.1-0.15% up on the Greenback, but rangebound with the Kiwi hovering between 0.6750-75, Cable pivoting 1.3200 and awaiting the Brexit White Paper, Eur/Usd trading just below 1.1700 ahead of the ECB minutes and Loonie straddling 1.3200 having lost all and more of its BoC-inspired strength following the tank in oil prices yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>SEK/TRY - Sub-forecast Swedish inflation data and Riksbank minutes highlighting dovish dissenting views have undermined the Krona as the Eur cross climbs to 10.3300 from just over 10.2700 at one stage, but the Lira has regained some composure after slumping to a fresh all time low vs the Usd on Wednesday circa 5.0000 amidst comments from Turkey&rsquo;s new Treasury and Finance Minister &lsquo;assuring&rsquo; CBRT independence and reaffirming pledges to pursue policies that will be fiscally prudent, with single digit inflation and structural reform among the other main priorities. Usd/Try back down around 4.8000.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Oil is recovering this morning after the significant losses seen in yesterday&rsquo;s trade that was spurred on by trade concerns and increased Libyan production. WTI is up 0.8% and Brent up 1.8% but still well below the levels seen prior to yesterday&rsquo;s trade, with WTI finding some support at its 100DMA, currently at USD 69.40. IEA maintain their forecast for 2018 global oil demand growth of 1.4mln BPD, say OPEC crude production in June reached a 4-month high of 31.87mln BPD, up 180k BPD (excl. Congo)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Gold prices are edging up on the back of trade war concerns, with the yellow metal currently at the USD 1,245/oz level. Copper (+0.8%) and nickel (+3.8%) are also seeing some reprieve and have edged up, with copper moving away from year-long lows. Steel has advanced to near 10-month highs as the Chinese Government intensifies efforts to cut pollution is raising supply concerns.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Equities were slightly choppy amid source reports suggesting that US President Trump was criticising NATO and had threatened to drop out, reports thereafter suggested that pulling out is not on the cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IBEX (-0.2%) and FTSE MIB (-0.3%) are in the red, weighed on by bank stocks with exposure to Turkish assets (BBVA -0.7%) alongside broad-based financial underperformance (UniCredit -1.0%, Banca Generali -1.1%, CaixaBank -1.1%) and possible strike action at Fiat&rsquo;s (-1.0%) Melfi plant over Cristiano Ronaldo&rsquo;s transfer cost. Telecom Italia (-1.3%) is also underperforming after a price target cut at Barclays, and is weighing on the telecoms sector, which is currently negative for the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FTSE is outperforming on the back of betting names such as Paddy Power Betfair (+2.7%) benefitting from England&rsquo;s exit from the World Cup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Updates on Sky (+1.8%) where Comcast have tabled a GBP 26bln offer to buy the co., moving swiftly to trump Fox&rsquo;s GBP 24.5bln offer earlier in the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asos (-9.0%) have stated that their guidance for FY18 sales is within +25-30% range and possibly will be toward the lower end of this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/AUD - Flanking the G10 list of worst and best performers on less investor angst over a full blown US-China trade war even though the latter (via a Commerce Ministry official) has scotched speculation that the 2 sides have been talking already. Short covering also a factor behind the broad bounce in risk assets and resultant reduced demand for safe-havens like the Jpy that finally yielded to pressure below 111.00 vs the Usd, as the pair broke higher and into a fresh range overnight. Stops are said to have been tripped through 111.50 and major trend-line resistance around 111.57 that had been capping the upside, with more triggered when 112.00 was breached on the way to a circa 112.40 peak. Conversely, the Aud has been able to stem further losses and rebound ahead of 0.7350 vs its US counterpart, although the 0.7400 handle remains elusive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF - Mildly softer vs the Usd as the Franc slips through 0.9950, but still not really behaving like a true port in a currency storm given strict SNB intervention to prevent the highly valued Chf getting too strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/GBP/EUR/CAD - All around 0.1-0.15% up on the Greenback, but rangebound with the Kiwi hovering between 0.6750-75, Cable pivoting 1.3200 and awaiting the Brexit White Paper, Eur/Usd trading just below 1.1700 ahead of the ECB minutes and Loonie straddling 1.3200 having lost all and more of its BoC-inspired strength following the tank in oil prices yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/TRY - Sub-forecast Swedish inflation data and Riksbank minutes highlighting dovish dissenting views have undermined the Krona as the Eur cross climbs to 10.3300 from just over 10.2700 at one stage, but the Lira has regained some composure after slumping to a fresh all time low vs the Usd on Wednesday circa 5.0000 amidst comments from Turkey&rsquo;s new Treasury and Finance Minister &lsquo;assuring&rsquo; CBRT independence and reaffirming pledges to pursue policies that will be fiscally prudent, with single digit inflation and structural reform among the other main priorities. Usd/Try back down around 4.8000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It remains rather begrudging or at least lacking in conviction, but Bunds and Gilts did stretch the upper end of their intraday ranges to 162.68 and 123.09 (+15 and +16 ticks) before topping out again. No real rationale, though this did coincide with a downturn in BTPs and other peripheral bonds, which looks supply-related in part at least. Conversely, US Treasuries remain depressed and close to overnight session lows ahead of a slew of data, highlighted by CPI that may be skewed to the upside vs consensus in wake of Wednesday&rsquo;s above forecast PPI. Weekly claims also due after last Friday&rsquo;s mixed NFP report and the last leg of this week&rsquo;s auctions in the shape of $14 bn 30 year debt. Note also, some Fed speak via Kashkari and Harker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is recovering this morning after the significant losses seen in yesterday&rsquo;s trade that was spurred on by trade concerns and increased Libyan production. WTI is up 0.8% and Brent up 1.8% but still well below the levels seen prior to yesterday&rsquo;s trade, with WTI finding some support at its 100DMA, currently at USD 69.40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold prices are edging up on the back of trade war concerns, with the yellow metal currently at the USD 1,245/oz level. Copper (+0.8%) and nickel (+3.8%) are also seeing some reprieve and have edged up, with copper moving away from year-long lows. Steel has advanced to near 10-month highs as the Chinese Government intensifies efforts to cut pollution is raising supply concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IEA maintain their forecast for 2018 global oil demand growth of 1.4mln BPD, say OPEC crude production in June reached a 4 month high of 31.87mln BPD, up 180k BPD (excl. Congo)</p>\r\n",

Short covering also a factor behind the broad bounce in risk assets and resultant reduced demand for safe-havens like the Jpy that finally yielded to pressure below 111.00 vs the Usd, as the pair broke higher and into a fresh range overnight.

Aside from post-World Cup lethargy and a sombre mood, the lacklustre tone reflects a similar tone on Eurex with Bunds remaining rangebound albeit inching to a marginal new high at 162.59, but still leaving a chart gap up to 162.64 unfilled, according to market contacts looking at near term tech levels.
