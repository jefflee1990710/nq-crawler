        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 27 April 2018: Markets close out the week with a whimper",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities flat, Treasuries down, DXY flat, Crude down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: US GDP beat, UK GDP misses, North/South Korea prospect of denuclearization.&nbsp;<br />* AHEAD: FOMC, Nonfarm Payrolls, Quarterly Refunding, Eurozone CPI, global PMIs, RBA.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>North Korean leader Kim and South Korean President Moon completed their inter-Korean summit and released the &ldquo;Panmunjom Declaration,&rdquo; a document that pledges to work toward signing a peace deal this year ending the Korean War, denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula in phases, and developing inter-Korean relations leading toward reunification, Stratfor reported. &ldquo;In practical terms, Kim and Moon agreed to a nonaggression pact, stated plans to resume family reunions on Aug. 15, set up an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong, halted propaganda activities on the Demilitarized Zone and began the process to connect cross-border railways and roads.&rdquo; US President Trump welcomed progress between North and South Korea, and will meet with Kim in the coming weeks; US Vice President Pence commented that the US would meet any talks, promises or assurances from North Korea with reservation, vigilance, and verification. Trump also reiterated that Iran must not &lsquo;get even close&rsquo; to nuclear weapons. The US House Intelligence Committee issued its Russia report, and the Republican report found no evidence of collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia but affirms evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Elsewhere, at the margin, US President Trump seemed to intimate that he might intervene in the Russia investigation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE NEWS: NAFTA: </strong>Canada&rsquo;s foreign minister again reiterated that progress was being made on NAFTA talks, particularly in the area of auto content. After Mexico&rsquo;s economy minister Guajardo and Freeland stayed in Washington yesterday and today to thrash out a deal, expectations are high a deal will be reached (Mexcio says an agreement is close, Canada is more cautious) &ndash; earlier in the week, sources reported that a deal could be reached as soon as 1/May, though on Friday, other sources said ministers were due to meet again on 7 May; the news is in line with earlier timelines suggested by both Mexican and Canadian policymakers. TRUMP/MERKEL: During his press conference with German Chancellor Merkel, President Trump wants to &quot;remedy&quot; trade imbalances with the EU. German Chancellor Merkel said Germany will continue to be a reliable trade partner to the US, Germany is committed to free trade within the WTO framework, but she noted that there are some shortcomings, in an apparent nod to some of Trump&rsquo;s arguments. On trade between the US/EU, Merkel avoided answering a question on whether EU and Germany will be exempt from US steel/aluminium tariffs, says Trump will make a decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: US Q1 GDP </strong>data surprised to the upside, slowing from 2.9% in Q4, but at 2.3%, beat expectations of 2.0%; the internals show that consumer spending and business investment slowed, though the PCE measures point to inflation rising. The data is unlikely to concern the Fed, particularly given that Q1 has often seen a &lsquo;weather impact&rsquo; in recent years. Analysts were focussing, however, on the slowdown in consumption (1.1% vs 4.0% in Q4), but Capital Economics says that was partly due to the drop back in motor vehicles spending, following a post-hurricane spike at the end of last year. University of Michigan final April data was encouraging, with sentiment printing 98.8 against an expected 98.0, conditions a touch below expectations at 114.9, while expectations were revised up. The inflation gauges were unchanged for the year-ahead, though the 5 to 10-year gauge rose 0.1ppts to 2.5%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX +0.15% at 2670, NDX +0.10% at 6656, DJI -0.05 at 24310. </strong>Energy -1.2%, Materials -0.2%, Industrials -0.1%, Consumer discretionary +0.5%, Consumer staples +0.6%, Healthcare +0.5%, Financials +0.1%, IT -0.3%, Telecoms +1.8%, Utilities +1.0%. Equity futures are negative for the week, but closed out the week on a whimper, with most of the action horizontal &ndash; there was some negative ticks in afternoon trade, though the ES was content to consolidate beneath the 2670. &nbsp;M&amp;A: Reports suggest that Sprint (S) is seeking to finalise its merger with T-Mobile (TMUS) which could come as soon as next week. Praxair (PX) and Linde AG received CFIUS clearance for their business combination, and the deal is seen completing in the second half of the year. ENERGY: Was the biggest laggard, with some of the big names reporting; Exxon (XOM) beat on revenues but miss on EPS, suggesting that higher crude prices aren&rsquo;t solving the issues, Chevron (CVX) beat on EPS though missed on revs. There wasn&rsquo;t much support from crude prices. TECH: FAANGs were mixed; Amazon (AMZN) was higher after a solid earnings report, though the rest of the group were struggling to carve out gains, and tech shares were generally soft, as was INTC despite solid earnings. Elsewhere in tech, ahead of its earnings, reports suggest that Apple (AAPL) will manufacture 8 million iPhone X units in Q2 as it looks to drive down its inventory. CONS DISC: Charter Communications (CHTR) was slammed after reporting the loss of more internet and TV subscribers than expected, with Comcast (CMCSA) and Altice (ATC) falling in sympathy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong>The Treasury curve bull-flattened on Friday, with short-dated yields narrowing by around 1bps, while the longer-end of the curve saw yields drop by around 5bps at settlement. The buying resulted in further narrowing of major curve spreads &ndash; on the week, 2s30s narrows by around 3bps, 5s30s narrowed by around 2bps, while 2s10s flattened by around 2bps in the week. There was some selling action after better than expected US GDP on Friday, though the selling was reversed shortly afterwards, as the sell-off in tech shares prompted buying in the long-end of the curve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>WTI (June) futures settle 9 cents lower at 68.10/bbl; Brent (June) settled 10 cents lower at 67.98/bbl. Despite both slipping on the day, Brent is on track for its third week of gains, though WTI finishes red. Dollar strength was touted as a contributing factor to the daily weakness, being helped along after a soft UK GDP report, while talk of profit-taking after a decent run was also cited, as well as the slight easing in global geopolitical tensions after the meeting between North and South Korea. During the press conference between US President Trump and German Chancellor Merkel, crude came under pressure, likely as a result of positive comments made by Trump regarding geopolitics regarding North Korea, though Trump was more vague (and stern) with regards to Iran. Just a few months ago, analysts were struggling to place a bullish narrative around the crude complex, however, the upside bias is being seen in many analyst notes as of late: A note from BofAML&rsquo;s analysts was receiving attention, with the bank said to see Brent prices above $80 in Q1. Meanwhile, analysts at PVM are looking for crude to consolidate around current levels (though will be subject to bouts of profit-taking) ahead of 12/May, when the US will decide whether to pull-out of the Iran nuclear deal (bullish crude, is the theory), or stay in/amend the current deal (bearish crude, the theory goes). Baker Hughes reported oil drillers added rigs for the fourth straight week, with the weekly count rising by 5 to 825 (total up 8 to 1021), though there was little impact on crude prices. Analysts continue to monitor the situation in Venezuela; sources reported that the country will have to make full debt payments to China following the lapse of a grace period, and will have to ship 375k BPD to meet those obligations. Elsewhere, Philips 66 again called for more pipeline capacity in the Permian Basin, amid mounting evidence that US pipelines are struggling to handle the boost in US production, and the pipeline situation is reported to be weighing on local prices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX: DXY </strong>The broad Dollar has eased off best levels in wake of some mixed US data beneath a headline Q1 GDP beat, but remains on track to continue its recent renaissance, with the index almost extending gains to resistance just ahead of 92.000 having started the week around 90.300. In terms of drivers along with the charts turning more positive as upside levels were surpassed, less angst on the trade and geopolitical front, plus some upbeat economic indicators and last, but by no means least weakness in rival currencies. <strong>GBP </strong>Friday&rsquo;s biggest G10 loser and underperformer by some distance, and largely due to a much bleaker than expected 1st look at Q1 UK growth, which was only modestly impacted by bad weather to add insult to injury. This put a further big dent in May BoE rate hike prospects with some market measures assigning less than a 20% chance vs 50% before the release. Cable extended last week&rsquo;s already heavy losses from 1.3900+ to circa 1.3750, with little in the way of support seen until just ahead of the next downside big figure. Even Eur/Gbp rebounded through 0.8700 and just over 0.8750 amidst ongoing weakness in the single currency. Sterling appears on track to end April as the fall guy having been among the most attractive on seasonal and other factors with just one day to go. <strong>EUR/JPY/CHF </strong>All undermined by dovish/downbeat Central Bank policy pronouncements after the ECB acknowledged a slowdown in growth and did not even discuss life after the current end of QE in September, while the BoJ removed its timetable for inflation reaching target and the SNB maintained that the Franc is still highly valued, albeit not has strong as it has been. Eur/Usd tumbled further from brief post-ECB meeting peaks around 1.2210 to a 1.2055 low and testing support down to 1.2550, but bounced in the run up to another big option expiry cluster at the NY cut (3 bn at the 1.2100 strike after 5+ bn at 1.2200 ran off on Thursday). Usd/Jpy spiked just above 109.50 at one stage, but faded ahead of a 109.65 Fib again to revisit the 109.00 handle. Usd/Chf reached 0.9900 before easing back amidst broad Greenback consolidation and profit taking. <strong>AUD/NZD/CAD</strong> The non-US Dollars all held up better during the final trading session of the week, but after hefty declines since the previous Friday on a mixture of disappointing data, cross flows, technicals and CB vibes suggesting no hurry to raise rates whatsoever. Aud/Usd slipped further towards the next downside round number at 0.7500, Nzd/Usd tested sub-0.7050 as the cross climbed back over 1.0700 and Usd/Cad rallied to 1.2900 before easing back. Note, the Kiwi could have drawn some traction from one end of the month bank model suggesting Nzd/Usd upside. SEK The Krona was undermined by the Riksbank pushing back rate hike projections until late 2018 in response to weaker than forecast Swedish inflation developments, with Eur/Sek up to 8 year highs over 10.5400, but then fading alongside the Eur in general to sub-10.5000. Note, Ohlsson dissented in favour of a hike to -0.25% from 0.50%, but this was largely shrugged off and a lone, outlying hawkish shout. <strong>TRY/MXN</strong> The Lira got a belated lift after the CBRT jacked up its LLW by a bigger than expected 75 basis points to 13.50% with Usd/Try retesting lows just above 4.0000, while the Peso was supported by more reports suggesting that a NAFTA accord may be reached early next month &ndash; Usd/Mxn sub-18.7000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEK AHEAD: </strong>Next week&rsquo;s docket is packed with tier one releases; from the US, FOMC (Weds), Treasury Quarterly Refunding (Weds) and Payrolls (Friday) stand out, while ISM surveys will also garner attention; Canada and Mexico watchers will focus on NAFTA talks, with a deal expected to be reached next week; In APAC, RBA reports on Tuesday ahead of its SOMP on Friday, and a host of PMI data will be released globally.

        "content": "",
        "reaction_details": "<p>Despite both slipping on the day, Brent is on track for its third week of gains, though WTI finishes red. Dollar strength was touted as a contributing factor to the daily weakness, being helped along after a soft UK GDP report, while talk of profit-taking after a decent run was also cited, as well as the slight easing in global geopolitical tensions after the meeting between North and South Korea. During the press conference between US President Trump and German Chancellor Merkel, crude came under pressure, likely as a result of positive comments made by Trump regarding geopolitics regarding North Korea, though Trump was more vague (and stern) with regards to Iran. Just a few months ago, analysts were struggling to place a bullish narrative around the crude complex, however, the upside bias is being seen in many analyst notes as of late: A note from BofAML&rsquo;s analysts was receiving attention, with the bank said to see Brent prices above $80 in Q1. Meanwhile, analysts at PVM are looking for crude to consolidate around current levels (though will be subject to bouts of profit-taking) ahead of 12/May, when the US will decide whether to pull-out of the Iran nuclear deal (bullish crude, is the theory), or stay in/amend the current deal (bearish crude, the theory goes). Baker Hughes reported oil drillers added rigs for the fourth straight week, with the weekly count rising by 5 to 825 (total up 8 to 1021), though there was little impact on crude prices. Analysts continue to monitor the situation in Venezuela; sources reported that the country will have to make full debt payments to China following the lapse of a grace period, and will have to ship 375k BPD to meet those obligations. Elsewhere, Philips 66 again called for more pipeline capacity in the Permian Basin, amid mounting evidence that US pipelines are struggling to handle the boost in US production, and the pipeline situation is reported to be weighing on local prices.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Dollar has eased off best levels in wake of some mixed US data beneath a headline Q1 GDP beat, but remains on track to continue its recent renaissance, with the index almost extending gains to resistance just ahead of 92.000 having started the week around 90.300. In terms of drivers along with the charts turning more positive as upside levels were surpassed, less angst on the trade and geopolitical front, plus some upbeat economic indicators and last, but by no means least weakness in rival currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friday&rsquo;s biggest G10 loser and underperformer by some distance, and largely due to a much bleaker than expected 1<sup>st</sup> look at Q1 UK growth, which was only modestly impacted by bad weather to add insult to injury. This put a further big dent in May BoE rate hike prospects with some market measures assigning less than a 20% chance vs 50% before the release. Cable extended last week&rsquo;s already heavy losses from 1.3900+ to circa 1.3750, with little in the way of support seen until just ahead of the next downside big figure. Even Eur/Gbp rebounded through 0.8700 and just over 0.8750 amidst ongoing weakness in the single currency. Sterling appears on track to end April as the fall guy having been among the most attractive on seasonal and other factors with just one day to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/JPY/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All undermined by dovish/downbeat Central Bank policy pronouncements after the ECB acknowledged a slowdown in growth and did not even discuss life after the current end of QE in September, while the BoJ removed its timetable for inflation reaching target and the SNB maintained that the Franc is still highly valued, albeit not has strong as it has been. Eur/Usd tumbled further from brief post-ECB meeting peaks around 1.2210 to a 1.2055 low and testing support down to 1.2550, but bounced in the run up to another big option expiry cluster at the NY cut (3 bn at the 1.2100 strike after 5+ bn at 1.2200 ran off on Thursday). Usd/Jpy spiked just above 109.50 at one stage, but faded ahead of a 109.65 Fib again to revisit the 109.00 handle. Usd/Chf reached 0.9900 before easing back amidst broad Greenback consolidation and profit taking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD/CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The non-US Dollars all held up better during the final trading session of the week, but after hefty declines since the previous Friday on a mixture of disappointing data, cross flows, technicals and CB vibes suggesting no hurry to raise rates whatsoever. Aud/Usd slipped further towards the next downside round number at 0.7500, Nzd/Usd tested sub-0.7050 as the cross climbed back over 1.0700 and Usd/Cad rallied to 1.2900 before easing back. Note, the Kiwi could have drawn some traction from one end of the month bank model suggesting Nzd/Usd upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Krona was undermined by the Riksbank pushing back rate hike projections until late 2018 in response to weaker than forecast Swedish inflation developments, with Eur/Sek up to 8 year highs over 10.5400, but then fading alongside the Eur in general to sub-10.5000. Note, Ohlsson dissented in favour of a hike to -0.25% from 0.50%, but this was largely shrugged off and a lone, outlying hawkish shout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRY/MXN</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira got a belated lift after the CBRT jacked up its LLW by a bigger than expected 75 basis points to 13.50% with Usd/Try retesting lows just above 4.0000, while the Peso was supported by more reports suggesting that a NAFTA accord may be reached early next month &ndash; Usd/Mxn sub-18.7000.</p>\r\n",

The USD was supported by higher rates, outperforming its major peers, while bond markets were under pressure. Equities did not suffer from higher interest rates and were modestly up across major economies, but US equities printed lower percentage returns in local currency than other majors. The strong dollar added to the fall in bond markets values (in dollar terms) out of the US, which was more pronounced in Europe and Japan. As such, the model produces neutral-to-weak dollar selling signals.&quot;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li>S&amp;P 500 slipping from record highs mainly due to worries about protectionism, regulation and geopolitics. But even if these fears recede, CapEco sees the index falling.</li>\r\n  <li>It says the key reason is the changing outlook for monetary policy, which has been very loose since the bull market began in 2009. &quot;Admittedly, the Fed began to raise its policy rate over two years ago and is now also shrinking its balance sheet. But its policy rate is still very low, while its asset holdings are only being cut very gradually. And unconventional monetary policy in the developed world overall has become more accommodative.&quot;</li>\r\n  <li>CapEco says that very loose monetary policy has boosted equity prices for two reasons: 1) facilitated a recovery in economic activity and corporate profits, 2) it cut investors&rsquo; required return from risky assets. &quot;Accordingly, 70% of the gain in the S&amp;P 500 during the bull market has been due to higher earnings, and 30% to a higher price/earnings ratio,&quot; adding that &quot;Clearly, monetary policy is not the only factor to have affected these two variables. Corporate tax cuts, for example, have driven up earnings recently. Yet it is likely to have been a key one.&quot;&nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>&quot;In the past, tighter Fed policy has eventually taken a toll on the US economy, with the S&amp;P 500 usually turning a bit sooner,&quot; CapEco says, and it expects this to happen again, even if continued very loose monetary policy in the rest of the world prolongs the bull market. &quot;Admittedly,&quot; the consultancy writes, &quot;we are not forecasting a recession in the US, which has nearly always been bad news for the S&amp;P 500. But we do expect the economy there to slow significantly.&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>In the wake of cautious comments from Gov Carney, a very weak Q1 GDP print has ended the chances of a rate hike in May. For us, it means no hike at all in 2018&nbsp;</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Q1 GDP grows just +0.1%, much weaker than the +0.3% expected by the MPC: </strong>The first estimate of UK Q1 GDP of +0.1% q/q / +1.2% y/y has for us ended any real prospect of a 25bp increase in Bank Rate being sanctioned when the MPC announces its next decision on 10th May.We revert to our prior forecast of Bank Rate remaining on hold at 0.50% over the forecast horizon. Following on the heels of several disappointing empirical and sentiment data releases over recent weeks, both in the UK and elsewhere, a print this weak would have severely dented expectations of a hike even had the Governor not already acknowledged growing doubts a week ago.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>A lot has changed in a month, none of it for the better: </strong>The minutes of the previous MPC meeting, published on the 22nd March, explicitly referred to &quot;the market-implied probability of a 25bp increase at the May meeting (of) around 90%&quot;, and in our opinion contained very little to push back against that level of conviction. The minutes did note the cut in the Bank of England staff&#39;s expectation for Q1 GDP from 0.4% to 0.3% q/q, but attributed that to the impact of the bad weather last month, and stuck to the view that underlying GDP would grow by around 0.4% in the quarter. Revision-prone as first estimates of UK GDP notoriously are, we believe it would be untenable to repeat that assertion in May given the extent of this downside miss.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Implied probability following Carney&#39;s comments and GDP print below 25%: </strong>The apparently deliberate warning from the Governor in comments during a BBC interview last week that a May hike was less clear cut than the market was implying have amplified the reaction to this very soft GDP estimate. It seems inconceivable to us now that Mr Carney will vote for a hike at the next meeting, and while other members may hold different views, it is hard to imagine any but the most hawkish deeming a hike in May to be appropriate. We now expect a 7-2 split vote as in March, with external members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders likely prepared to assume the pronounced recent data weakness is transitory and exaggerated by inclement weather, and to advocate immediately pushing ahead with tighter policy.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>The MPC will for now deem recent weakness as temporary and stick to its guns: </strong>The overall message from the MPC on 10th May - in the minutes of their meeting, and the accompanying QIR and press conference - is likely to remain upbeat and positive. The economy will be predicted to bounce back in Q2 from temporary (albeit more pronounced than expected) weakness in the first quarter, and forecasts of accelerating earnings and ongoing underlying growth of around 0.4% q/q will not be revised, in our view. They are likely to repeat their prediction that rates are expected to rise gradually over the course of this year and beyond.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>We view the slowdown as more serious, and see no prospect of hikes in 2018E: </strong>While the extent of the loss of momentum in Q1 may indeed have been exaggerated by the bad weather, we think there are deeper fundamental drivers of slowing activity that are set to persist. Brexit-related anxiety is a headwind that is blowing more strongly as time goes by without the full guarantee of a transitional deal, and with very little clarity on future arrangements post-exit. The slow motion slowdown we have warned of many times is continuing to materialise, and with inflation likely to return to target within the next 3-6 months, we believe the case for higher rates will look increasingly threadbare from both real activity and inflation standpoints.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

FTSE saw significant strengthening following uninspiring GDP data, that weakened the GBP and further reduced the possibility of tighter monetary policy.

Some consolidation off best levels currently as the FTSE joins other EU stock indices on the front foot in early Friday trade, and perhaps as attention turns to preliminary Q1 GDP before 2 BoE speakers in the pm session, including Governor Carney and Chief Economist Haldane. From a chart perspective, nothing much on the upside until 122.00.</p>\r\n",

However, Bunds are grinding higher after an initial mark-up to 158.38 from Thursday&rsquo;s 158.31 Eurex close, reaching 158.61 before losing some momentum ahead of the EU cash bourse opens and a raft of data still to come on the penultimate session ahead of month end. Moreover, Friday&rsquo;s scheduled ECB speakers are from the hawkish-leaning faction and could put their case forward amidst some reports that Draghi declined a request from Nowotny to put policy guidance beyond the current end of QE in September on the agenda. Back to the futures, and tech-wise 158.74-80 is seen as the nearest resistance area before the 21 DMA at 158.92, while chart support maybe too far away to mention, but for the record 157.90 is flagged by some technicians.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) traded positive although gains were relatively mild as participants also digested a flurry of data releases and earnings, while KOSPI (+0.6%) benefited from a warming of ties amid the historic inter-Korean summit. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) and Hang Seng (+0.2%) were mixed with underperformance in the mainland following a neutral position by the PBoC in today&rsquo;s open market operations, while data also showed a slowdown in the pace of Chinese Industrial Profit growth. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher with prices underpinned at the open to track the upside in USTs and with gains then held throughout the session including after an uneventful BoJ announcement in which it kept policy unchanged but removed the wording on reaching inflation goal around FY19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ kept monetary policy unchanged as expected with NIRP held at -0.10% and the 10yr JGB yield target at around 0%.<br />The decision was made by 8-1 vote with Kataoka the dissenter again, while the central bank removed its reference to achieving 2% CPI target around FY19. Furthermore, BoJ stated that risks to economy were balanced for FY2018 but are skewed to downside for FY2019.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remained firm and held near the prior day&rsquo;s best levels as its major counterparts EUR and GBP consolidated from yesterday&rsquo;s swings with EUR/USD stuck near the 1.2100 level. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were also lacklustre amid mixed releases including softer than expected Tokyo CPI and Retail Sales data, although Industrial Production was more encouraging and topped estimates, while an unchanged BoJ policy announcement also ensured price action was uneventful. Elsewhere, KRW strengthened overnight amid the inter-Korean summit in which North Korea Leader Kim became his nation&rsquo;s first leader to step on South Korea territory since 1953.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAFTA countries are aiming for a May 1st agreement although big issues remain, according to sources familiar with the matter. However, Mexico&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Videgaray stated they are reasonably near to a NAFTA deal and that an agreement is definitely possible in a few days.

Elsewhere, gold languished as the greenback held onto the prior day&rsquo;s advances, while copper also lacked demand alongside underperformance in Chinese riskier assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea Leader Kim met with South Korean President Moon in which the leaders shook hands and stepped on both sides of the border together holding hands, before they held talks. Following the talks, a South Korean presidential official said that North Korea leader Kim suggested to meet more often and is willing to visit South Korea&#39;s Presidential Palace, while Kim also said he attended the summit to put an end to history of conflict.

Thursday&rsquo;s auction of 7-year debt was solid, stopping through the screens by 0.6bps, and the yield was the highest since April 2010. The bid-to-cover of 2.56x was also well above recent averages and the highest since January. Primary dealers were awarded the smallest share since the beginning of 2018, directs&rsquo; coverage was in close proximity to recent averages whilst indirects, a proxy for foreign demand, took the largest portion since January. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled 7+ ticks higher at 119-10.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) traded positive although gains were relatively mild as participants also digested a flurry of data releases and earnings, while KOSPI (+0.6%) benefited from a warming of ties amid the historic inter-Korean summit. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) and Hang Seng (+0.2%) were mixed with underperformance in the mainland following a neutral position by the PBoC in today&rsquo;s open market operations, while data also showed a slowdown in the pace of Chinese Industrial Profit growth. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher with prices underpinned at the open to track the upside in USTs and with gains then held throughout the session including after an uneventful BoJ announcement in which it kept policy unchanged but removed the wording on reaching inflation goal around FY19.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) are positive although gains are relatively mild as participants also digest a flurry of data releases and earnings, while KOSPI (+0.7%) benefits from a warming of ties amid the historic inter-Korean summit. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) and Hang Seng (+0.5%) are positive but with underperformance in the mainland following a neutral position by the PBoC in today&rsquo;s open market operations, while data also showed a slowdown in the pace of Chinese Industrial Profit growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remained firm and held near the prior day&rsquo;s best levels as its major counterparts EUR and GBP consolidate from yesterday&rsquo;s swings with EUR/USD sideways near the 1.2100 level. USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are also lacklustre amid mixed releases including softer than expected Tokyo CPI and Retail Sales data, although Industrial Production was more encouraging and topped estimates, while a looming BoJ policy announcement has added to the hesitation. Elsewhere, KRW strengthened overnight amid the summit in which North Korea Leader Kim became his nation&rsquo;s first leader to step on South Korea territory since 1953 and in which him and South Korean President Moon stepped on both sides of the border together holding hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs opened with marginal gains as they tracked the upside in USTs, although price action has been sideways with focus shifting to the BoJ policy decision.</p>\r\n",

The meeting will include the latest Outlook Report which contains bank officials&rsquo; forecasts for Real GDP and Core CPI, while it will also be the first meeting to be attended by newly appointed BoJ Deputy Governors Amamiya and Wakatabe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The commentary from the BoJ continues to suggest no near-term policy changes being contemplated with Governor Kuroda recently reiterated that Japan needs strong accommodative monetary policy for some time, while he has also continuously repeated that the BoJ will maintain QQE w/ YCC for as long as necessary to reach the 2% target in a stable manner. In addition, the central bank has begun to mention the idea of normalization in which Kuroda stated the bank is internally discussing an exit from current monetary policy, although he added that they will not communicate it with the markets until policy normalizing timing draws near.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the data suggests that policy tightening is unlikely to be anytime soon as CPI remains a far distance from the 2% price target with National CPI at 1.1% vs. Exp. 1.1% (Prev. 1.5%) and with Core CPI at 0.9% vs. Exp. 0.9% (Prev. 1.0%). Furthermore, the recent Tankan survey was somewhat inconclusive as large manufacturers&rsquo; sentiment deteriorated for the first time in 2 years and large industry indices and outlooks missed forecasts across the board, although the data also showed strong all industry capex expectations and increased confidence for smaller businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, there is no exact scheduled release time for the announcement which can be anytime from the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0330BST/2130CDT/1030HKT. Alongside the decision and statement, the BoJ will release its latest projections which were affirmed across the board in January, and participants will be on the look-out if there are any changes to projections&nbsp;with the inclusion of the newly appointed Deputy Governors including known-reflationist Wakatabe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previous Outlook Report:<br />Real GDP<br />- Affirmed fiscal 2017 forecast at 1.9%.<br />- Affirmed fiscal 2018 forecast at 1.4%.<br />- Affirmed fiscal 2019 forecast at 0.7%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core CPI<br />- Affirmed fiscal 2017 forecast at 0.8%.<br />- Affirmed fiscal 2018 forecast at 1.4%.<br />- Affirmed fiscal 2019 forecast at 1.8% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).</p>\r\n",
