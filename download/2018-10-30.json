Also, the EU is said to stand ready to act to avoid clearing disruption from Brexit. A UK spokesperson reported the UK has no indication that the Brexit bill will exceed GBP 39bln. Elsewhere, S&amp;P said that the UK sovereign ratings are likely to be lowered in a no-deal situation (currently at AA, outlook negative).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> The country saw the release of its Q3 GDP which fell to 0.8% from 1.2%. Italy&#39;s business lobby Confindustria head, commenting on the figures, noted that if the country will not grow in the next months it will be exclusively the government&#39;s fault. The government defended its position by stressing the growth slowdown was caused by the previous government and by requests from the EU; it justified the weakness in the GDP stating they are a reason for an expansionary policy. The government also does not seem to backdown on its budget plans as leaders reiterated once again the budget deficit will remain at 2.4%. In later comments, Italy&#39;s treasury said that the EU has asked for clarification on plans to reduce the country&rsquo;s debt stating they will respond to EU questions on debt reduction by November 13th. Alongside this, the EU noted Italy&#39;s public debt remains a key vulnerability and a cause of concern for the whole Euro Zone, adding that Italy&rsquo;s planned fiscal expansion is not compatible with the debt cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> US Secretary of State of Pompeo is likely to meet his North Korean counterpart in New York next week, according to Yonhap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> US President Trump once again renewed criticism on the Fed, by quoting analyst Wells Fargo analyst Scott Wren in a tweet: &ldquo;If the Fed backs off and starts talking a little more Dovish, I think we&rsquo;re going to be right back to our 2,800 to 2,900 target range that we&rsquo;ve had for the S&amp;P 500&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Chief Economist Praet (Dovish) stated it takes time to reach the inflation goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC:</strong> BoC Governor Poloz said appropriate pace of future rate increases &#39;will depend on our assessment at each fixed announcement date&#39;. He noted the policy rate still negative in real terms and reiterated it will need to rise to neutral to achieve inflation target; neutral rate estimated between 2.5%-3.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CONSUMER CONFIDENCE fell to 137.9</strong> in October from 138.4, yet above the 136.0 consensus, whilst the prior was revised slightly lower to 135.3. This represents a fresh 18-year record even if the level was slightly softer than last month. The labour market remains strong with signs that the jobless rate could drift even lower, Wells Fargo notes, even though confidence seems to be shrugging off volatile financial markets, the question remains on whether this will hold &lsquo;as the stock market loses steam&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +1.58% at 2683, NDX +1.43% at 6810, DJI +1.76% at 24874.

Coca Cola (KO) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) pushed higher after beating their sales estimates. Under Armour (UAA) shot up after reporting strong earnings and raising guidance. Take-Two Interactive Software&rsquo;s (TTWO) boast of the biggest ever, single-release opening weekend in the entertainment industry reflected in its share price which traded higher. Pfizer (PFE) restrained the wider health care sector after cutting revenue guidance. IBM (IBM) was a bottom mover following its acquisition bid for RedHat (RHT). General Electric (GE) nosedived after investors were unsatisfied with its less than expected cut in dividend. Mastercard (MA) traversed lower after its results, also bringing down competitor Visa (V). A range of tech heavyweights also traded lower today including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Netflix (NFLX). In late trade Papa John&rsquo;s (PZZA) spiked higher following reports that Bain Capital and CVC Capital Partners are among some of the competing buyout firms looking to acquire the co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.86 LOWER AT USD 66.18/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 1.43 LOWER AT USD 75.91/BBL.</strong> Crude traded red, once again trading on the theme of demand fears and a stronger USD. &quot;The petroleum markets are attracting both a share of this risk-off trade flow and factoring in its own worries over the apparent current oversupply in the market, with crude oil down closer to 2.0% on the day with the Brent market threatening weekly uptrend support,&quot; Citi says, &quot;long liquidation ahead of Wednesday&#39;s December Brent expiration may be contributing to the downdraft.&quot; After the bell, API reports weekly energy inventories; this week, the Street is looking for Crude +3.7mln, Cushing +2.39mln, distillates -1.8mln, gasoline -2.3mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 5+ TICKS LOWER AT 118-25.</strong> In European trade, the treasury complex found some buyers after Italy suggested the GDP slowdown is an additional reason for the budget expansion. Nonetheless, in US hours, a strong US consumer confidence and an improving risk-sentiment reversed those moves, with the complex ending Tuesday&rsquo;s session in negative territory. Yields were higher by c.2bps across the curve at settlement. 2s5s narrowed by c.1bps whilst 5s30s were wider by c.1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>Bullish month end factors almost nudged the Dollar beyond several big figure, round number and psychological levels vs major and EM peers, with the DXY printing a fresh YTD and breaching 97.000 for the first time since 2007 ahead of the final day of the month which may see the index rally further on any residual end of October rebalancing, tax payment and/or SOMA demand (latter estimated at circa Usd23 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>Extending gains vs their US counterpart and outperformance across the G10 sphere in the process as the former finally breaches strong resistance at 0.7100 ahead of Australian CPI data overnight and the latter almost hitting 0.6575 amidst more stable risk sentiment overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, CAD, CHF:</strong>&nbsp; All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with the single currency bouncing off sub-1.1350 lows in wake of disappointing Eurozone GDP data (Italian especially after stagnation in Q3), but Loonie unable to break out of its 1.3100-45 range amidst weak oil prices and the Franc also struggling to pare any lost ground from parity+ levels following a weaker than forecast Swiss KoF index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, JPY:</strong> The clear laggards as Cable slipped through 1.2750 and not far from chart support around 1.2725 at one stage due to ongoing Brexit uncertainty and a big miss in the CBI&rsquo;s headline UK volume of sales balance, while the Jpy only just held above 113.00 vs the Usd and briefly touched a key Fib (112.97) ahead of the BoJ policy meeting that is widely tipped to maintain rates, QQE and YCC, with potential for downgrades to growth forecasts in the latest Outlook Report (for a full preview see our Research Suite or headline feed later tonight).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM:</strong> Some contrasting performances with most regional currencies firmer vs the Usd, but the Cnh not heeding more semi-official talk about ensuring Yuan stability or gleaning much comfort from US President Trump&rsquo;s assertion that a great trade accord with China can be struck. However, the Mxn managed to reverse a chunk of its recent airport-related losses after mildly better than expected Mexican Q3 growth and the Try continued its strong resurgence with some technical impetus as the Lira rallied over 5.5000 and cheaper crude also a factor on the implications for Turkish inflation ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW:</strong> BoJ policy announcement due on Wednesday 31st October. The BoJ will conclude its latest 2-day policy meeting on Wednesday in which no major fireworks are anticipated given the onesided expectations for the central bank to maintain its policy settings of negative rates at -0.1% and the long-term yield target at around 0.0%. In addition, the BoJ is expected to keep its flexible approach on yields and reaffirm its forward guidance of keeping current extremely low rates for an extended period of time, while the central bank will also release its latest Outlook Report containing board members&#39; median forecasts for Real GDP and Core CPI. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20433/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.5%) both pared opening losses as a rebound in tech and resilience in Australia&rsquo;s top-weighted financial sector led the advances, while the Japanese benchmark and its exporters cheered the favourable currency moves. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+1.0%) and Hang Seng (-0.9%) both initially lagged following recent reports that suggested US is planning to announce further tariffs on China if talks between US President Trump and Chinese President Xi fail, while the upcoming deluge of blue-chip earnings and continued liquidity drain by the PBoC added to the cautious tone. However, Chinese markets gradually recovered amid continued supportive intentions by China&rsquo;s authorities and optimism by US President Trump who was said to predict a great deal with China on trade. Finally, 10yr JGBs were softer amid the improved risk tone but with losses stemmed by the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 880bln in JGBs, while the central bank also kicks off its latest 2-day policy meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 120bln. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.9574 (Prev. 6.9377); weakest setting since May 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were unconfirmed Twitter reports that the White House was unaware of any new developments related to tariffs on China. Furthermore, US President Trump is said to predict a great deal with China on trade. (Newswires/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Central Bank adviser says China should use its FX reserves to stabilise the yuan exchange rate when needed. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Securities Regulatory Commission said will encourage value investment in stock market and repurchases by companies, while it will also guide more long-term capital into the market. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese Economy Minister Motegi said the TPP-11 trade pact will take effect as soon as year-end or early next year at the latest. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU pledged that EU groups will temporarily have access to UK derivative clearing services even if sides fail to secure a Brexit agreement, according to reports in FT citing European Commission Vice-President Dombrovskis. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond says that a no-deal Brexit could require fiscal stimulus. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK MPs are to debate the Budget later with some Labour MPs dismissing the government&rsquo;s claim to end austerity. (BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy are not planning to alter their budget as of now, as according to Siri speaking to Corriere. (Corriere)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German state CPIs Y/Y showed an uptick from the prior with an average of around 0.2 ppts. The national CPIs due later today is expected at 2.4% from 2.3% previously, but the bias against consensus looks firmly towards 2.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU GDP Flash Prelim YY Q3 1.7% vs. Exp. 1.8% (Prev. 2.1%, Rev. 2.2%) (Newswires)<br />EU GDP Flash Prelim QQ Q3 0.2% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.4%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian GDP Y/Y Q2 0.8% vs. Exp. 0.9% (Prev. 1.2%) (Newswires)<br />Italian GDP Q/Q Q2 0.0% vs. Exp. 0.1% (Prev. 0.2%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS<br /><br />Norges Bank&#39;s Nicolaisen reiterates view of seeing gradual rate hikes. Also says that he sees the key policy rate is expected to be at 2%, or marginally higher by the end of 2021. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European bourses are mixed with the SMI (+0.5%) out in front despite being weighed on heavily by Geberit (-9.0%) following their earnings; and the DAX (-0.7%) lagging with Lufthansa (-8.5%) dragging it down. Sectors began in the green, but have since fallen to being largely in the red with industrials lagging (-0.7%), although energy is still the outperforming sector (+0.8%). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of individual equities Ocado (+3.0%) is higher following a master services agreement with Kroger, while BP (+3.3%) rose after reporting earnings higher than their previous, notably revenue is up by USD 20bln. Elsewhere, Jyske Bank (-10.0%) are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after reporting a miss on earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The Greenback remains relatively evenly split vs G10 counterparts, with its Dollar peers still outperforming and preventing the index from staging a more concerted attempt to test recent peaks ahead of the ytd high and psychological 97.000 marker. However, the DXY is nudging closer at 96.847 vs 96.860 and 96.984 respectively as other majors succumb to more downside pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD - As noted above, the non-US Dollars are bucking the overall trend again, and deriving support from another resilient performance across Asia-Pacific bourses overnight given Wall Street&rsquo;s retreat from early recovery highs. The Aud in particular may also be gleaning encouragement from US President Trump&rsquo;s talk about a decent trade agreement with China and latest Yuan stabilisation talk from a PBoC advisor that appears to be keeping the Cny and Cnh just off 7.0000 vs the Usd. However, Aud/Usd is still struggling to climb above 0.7100, while the Kiwi looks equally toppy over 0.6550 and the Loonie seems unable to breach resistance at 1.3100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP/EUR/CHF - All victims of the general Buck bid into month end, and their own downfalls to an extent, as Usd/Jpy climbs through recent highs and closer to 113.00, with a 50% Fib at 112.97 just ahead of the big figure. Cable has failed to maintain recovery gains above 1.2800 and is now below 1.2750 , with tech support seen down at 1.2724, while Eur/Usd has retreated further from 1.1400 to 1.1350 amidst a stagflationary mix of Eurozone data and surveys. The Franc has extended losses beyond parity and hardly helped by a disappointing Kof indicator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK - Pared data-related losses after misses on Norwegian retail sales and credit with the aid of Norges Bank rhetoric reaffirming more gradual policy tightening and the likelihood of the depo rate reaching 2% or just over by 2021. Eur/Nok now back towards the middle of a 9.5210-5525 range. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are mostly lower with WTI and Brent retreating further from USD 67/bbl and USD 77/bbl respectively, on speculation that an escalating trade war between the world&rsquo;s two largest economies will dampen global growth at a time when US crude inventories are growing. Meanwhile, IEA&rsquo;s Chief Birol said he sees the oil market tightening next month, while adding that oil demand faces downward pressure in 2019. Traders will be keeping an eye on the weekly API crude inventories released later today for a sign of rising inventories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold is softer as the yellow metal mirrors dollar action, while copper and Shanghai rebar steel dipped as market sentiment was dampened by the prospects of a fresh round of US tariffs on USD 257bln of Chinese goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Energy Minister Novak says that prohibitive Russia oil duties are a last resort move (TASS)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US official says that the country may double gas production or export capacity (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IEA Chief Birol says many nations&#39; current account deficits have been impacted by higher oil prices, adds US becoming undisputed global leader of oil and gas production. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have rebounded firmly from earlier lows amidst a broad losses of momentum in EU equities and an even steeper reversal in Italian bonds in wake of GDP data showing now q/q growth in Q3 and auctions at multi-year high average yields. The 10 year benchmark has been down to 121.25 vs 122.90 at the early intraday high, with its core peers now 9 ticks up and just 2 ticks adrift compared to 39 and 27 ticks underwater on Eurex and Liffe respectively at one stage. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are largely side-lined, but making token and shallower moves in line with their mainstream equivalents, with the curve steeper and futures still nearer overnight session troughs.</p>\r\n",

However, the DXY is nudging closer at 96.847 vs 96.860 and 96.984 respectively as other majors succumb to more downside pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted above, the non-US Dollars are bucking the overall trend again, and deriving support from another resilient performance across Asia-Pacific bourses overnight given Wall Street&rsquo;s retreat from early recovery highs. The Aud in particular may also be gleaning encouragement from US President Trump&rsquo;s talk about a decent trade agreement with China and latest Yuan stabilisation talk from a PBoC advisor that appears to be keeping the Cny and Cnh just off 7.0000 vs the Usd. However, Aud/Usd is still struggling to climb above 0.7100, while the Kiwi looks equally toppy over 0.6550 and the Loonie seems unable to breach resistance at 1.3100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/GBP/EUR/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All victims of the general Buck bid into month end, and their own downfalls to an extent, as Usd/Jpy climbs through recent highs and closer to 113.00, with a 50% Fib at 112.97 just ahead of the big figure. Cable has failed to maintain recovery gains above 1.2800 and is now only just holding above 1.2750, with tech support seen down at 1.2724, while Eur/Usd has retreated further from 1.1400 to 1.1350 amidst a stagflationary mix of Eurozone data and surveys. The Franc has extended losses beyond parity and hardly helped by a disappointing Kof indicator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pared data-related losses after misses on Norwegian retail sales and credit with the aid of Norges Bank rhetoric reaffirming more gradual policy tightening and the likelihood of the depo rate reaching 2% or just over by 2021. Eur/Nok now back towards the middle of a 9.5210-5525 range. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Although EU stocks are already on the wane, the overall mood is has become a little less risk-averse amidst comments from US President Trump about the potential for a good trade deal with China.

However, Chinese markets gradually recovered amid continued supportive intentions by China&rsquo;s authorities and optimism by US President Trump who was said to predict a great deal with China on trade.

ASX 200 (+1.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.5%) both pared opening losses as a rebound in tech and resilience in Australia&rsquo;s top-weighted financial sector led the advances, while the Japanese benchmark and its exporters cheered the favourable currency moves. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.1%) both initially lagged following recent reports that suggested US is planning to announce further tariffs on China if talks between US President Trump and Chinese President Xi fail, while the upcoming deluge of blue-chip earnings and continued liquidity drain by the PBoC added to the cautious tone. However, Chinese markets gradually recovered amid continued supportive intentions by China&rsquo;s authorities and optimism by US President Trump who was said to predict a great deal with China on trade.

However, there were later unconfirmed Twitter reports that the White House was unaware of any new developments related to tariffs on China. Furthermore, US President Trump is said to predict a great deal with China on trade.

Elsewhere, the recovery in stocks coupled with Gotobi demand spurred outflows from JPY, while antipodeans outperformed due to their high-beta status amid the improvement in risk tone and as CNY briefly recovered from the weakest reference rate setting since May 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly rangebound overnight and head into the European open relatively unchanged, although WTI crude futures recovered from early pressure and reclaimed the USD 67.00/bbl amid a turnaround in risk sentiment.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as sentiment improves from the performance on Wall Street, where stocks extended on losses due to renewed tariff concerns and in which the major US indices were momentarily all in correction territory. ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) both pared opening losses with resilience in Australia&rsquo;s top-weighted financial sector keeping the index afloat, while the Japanese benchmark and its exporters cheered the favourable currency moves. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.2%) both initially lagged following recent reports that suggested US is planning to announce further tariffs on China if talks between US President Trump and Chinese President Xi fail, while the upcoming deluge of blue-chip earnings and continued liquidity drain by the PBoC added to the cautious tone. However, Chinese markets gradually recovered alongside their peers and amid some optimism by US President Trump who was said to predict a great deal with China on trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY holds near the prior day&rsquo;s best levels despite attempts by its major counterparts to nurse recent losses, with EUR/USD remaining below 1.1400 and GBP/USD just about reclaiming the 1.2800 handle to the upside as it partially recovers from the post-budget indecision and lost ground against the greenback. Elsewhere, the recovery in stocks spurred outflows from JPY, while antipodeans outperform due to their high-beta status amid the improvement in risk tone and as CNY recovers from the weakest reference rate setting since May 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful with price action contained by opposing forces of the improved risk tone and BoJ presence in the market, while the central bank also kicks off its latest 2-day policy meeting.</p>\r\n",
