Looking forward, on the back of PPI data that suggests inflation is in the pipeline, CPI in line with expectations, as well as the underperformance of retail sales data could provide the Fed with some ammo to refrain from aggressively pursuing normalisation when it meets next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there was little new from ECB&#39;s Draghi at today&#39;s ECB Watchers&#39; conference, he said adjustments to policy will remain predictable and proceed at a measured pace, and the sustained adjustment in inflation path towards aim is condition for net asset purchases to end. EUR eased from levels just under 1.24 before falling a 1.2360-1.2380 range, and reticent to test the day&#39;s highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP ticked higher following comments from Germany&#39;s Brexit negotiator who said &#39;a lot of progress&#39; was being made in talks. EURGBP, however, remains contained within the 50dma (at 88.42) and 200dma (at 0.8891) range. Cable, meanwhile, is on course for the fifth positive day against the USD, but action seems capped by 1.40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY found a bid amid the soft risk tone, taking its cue from softer equities and a fragile buck. USDJPY was moving away from overnight highs around the 106.70 area, falling to test 106.00, though the level held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RUB weakened after tensions between the UK and Russia ratcheted up. USDRUB moved towards the top-end of its recent range, around 57.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><a name=\"_Hlk507704203\">COMMODITIES</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude was supported in early trade after encouraging data out of China&rsquo;s industrial sector. However, the global risk tone clearly remains fragile, as was evidenced after the US cash equity open today, when stocks dropped &ndash; taking crude with it &ndash; in early trade.<br />Elsewhere, crude inventories rose by 5.022mln barrels, according to DOE data, eclipsing the forecast of a 2.023mln build, and the API&rsquo;s data, which on Tuesday showed a build of 1.156mln. Cushing stocks saw a build of 338k, in line with what Genscape had estimated earlier in the week and there were sharp draws in distillates and gasoline inventories. In a knee jerk reaction, oil prices slipped on the headline although focus quickly shifted to the product draw, and crude pared back losses to trade higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC&rsquo;s monthly oil market report added to the oversupply narrative, raising its non-OPEC production forecast to 1.66mln BPD in 2018 (it had previously forecast growth of 1.40mln BPD in its prior report). The cartel also trimmed demand estimates for its crude by 250k BPD in 2018 to 32.61mln BPD, but nudged up its view of global oil demand growth to 1.6mln BPD in 2018 (from 1.59mln in the previous report). Meanwhile, on the positive side, OPEC&rsquo;s output was said to fall by 77k BPD in February to 32.186mln BPD, secondary sources reported, and compliance with the output cut deal rose to 147%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks (9 Mar) 5.022M vs. Exp. 2.023M (Prev. 2.408M). (Newswires)<br />US crude production rose 12k to 10.381mln bpd.<br />EIA Weekly Cushing Stocks (9 Mar) 0.338mln (Prev. -0.605mln)<br />EIA Weekly Distillate Stocks (9 Mar) -4.360mln vs. Exp. -1.519mln (Prev. -0.559mln)<br />EIA Weekly Gasoline Stocks (9 Mar) -6.271mln vs. Exp. -1.176mln (Prev. -0.788mln)<br />EIA Weekly Refining Utilisation (9 Mar)&nbsp; +2.0% vs. Exp. -0.3% (Prev. +0.2%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump chose Larry Kudlow for the NEC Director role which Kudlow accepted.&nbsp; Furthermore, there were later comments by Larry Kudlow that he would like to see USD slightly stronger than it currently is, while he had also commented that China has not played by the rules on trade for a long time and that EU could get carve outs if it negotiates with the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is to publish rules for tariff exemptions shortly and said that he is confident a deal will be reached on NAFTA. Furthermore, Ross told the Senate panel that the US will continue to protect US biofuel producers with trade actions such as tariffs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is said to be close to firing AG Sessions and National Security Adviser McMaster. (Vanity Fair)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senate advanced the Dodd-Frank relief bill to pave way for a passage vote. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Retail Sales MM (Feb) -0.1% vs. Exp. 0.3% (Prev. -0.3%, Rev. -0.1%). (Newswires)<br />US Retail Control (Feb) 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.0%)<br />US PPI Final Demand YY (Feb) 2.8% vs. Exp. 2.8% (Prev. 2.7%)<br />US PPI Ex. Food/Energy YY (Feb) 2.5% vs. Exp. 2.5% (Prev. 2.2%)<br />Goldman Sachs lowered its US Q1 GDP to 1.8% (Prev. 2.0%) after today&#39;s data. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After February&#39;s retail sales and PPI data -- which showed retail sales remained subdued and real consumption slowed in Q1; while PPI continued to firm, signalling inflation pressures in the pipeline -- US equity futures dipped slightly. The net impact was that the &#39;Goldilocks&#39; narrative remained intact, allowing stocks to move higher at the cash open. However, lingering trade concerns ultimately weighed on risk-assets after the open to send equities lower. There was a little bounce in afternoon trade on news that Larry Kudlow had been offered the NEC Director job to replace Cohn which only provided brief support. SPX -0.56% at 2750, DJI -1.00% at 24760, NDX -0.08% at 7041.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bull-flattening along the curve was the theme again, with shorted yields slightly positive, and the long-end rallied by around 4bps. Major curves were mixed; the 2s5s was c.1bps narrower, 2s30s flat, 5s30s flat, and the 5s10s was wider by c.2bps. 10yr T-note futures (June 2018) settled 7 ticks higher at 120-17+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li>SNAPSHOT: Equities down; USD down; GBP flat; EUR Down; Oil flat; Treasuries flat &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>REAR VIEW: In line US PPI (Feb), disappointing Retail Sales; Kudlow appointment; Russian diplomat expulsion</li>\r\n  <li>AHEAD: French CPI; US Jobless claims; Norges Bank rates decision</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.56% at 2750, DJI&nbsp;-1.00% at 24760, NDX&nbsp;-0.08% at 7041<br /><br />* SECTORS: CONS DISC (XLY): -0.20%, CONS STAP (XLP): -1.26%, ENERGY (XLE): -0.64%, FINANCIALS (XLF): -1.19%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): -0.58%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): -1.12%, MATERIALS (XLB): -1.31%, TECH (XLK): -0.07%, TELECOMS (XTL): -0.76%, UTILITIES (XLU): +0.98%<br /><br />* After February&#39;s retail sales and PPI data -- which showed retail sales remaining subdued, and real consumption slowing in Q1; while PPI continued to firm, signalling inflation pressures in the pipeline -- US equity futures dipped slightly. The net impact was that the &#39;Goldilocks&#39; narrative remained intact, allowing stocks to move higher at the cash open. However, trade concerns continue to linger, and weighed on risk-assets after the open, sending equities lower. There was a little bounce in afternoon trade on news that Larry Kudlow had been offered the NEC chair job to replace Cohn, with stocks later finding a springboard from the 50dma at 2747 as news broke that Kudlow was said to accept the role.<br /><br />* USD: strengthened off overnight lows to trade back within the 89.70 to 89.90 range through the US session, despite mixed data (PPI and retail sales) and continued concerns regarding trade wars. Looking forward, on the back of PPI data that suggests inflation is in the pipeline, CPI in line with expectations, as well as the underperformance of retail sales data could provide the Fed with some ammo to refrain from aggressively pursuing normalisation when it meets next week.<br /><br />* EUR: While there was little new from ECB&#39;s Draghi at today&#39;s ECB Watchers&#39; conference, he said adjustments to policy will remain predictable and proceed at a measured pace, and the sustained adjustment in inflation path towards aim is condition for net asset purchases to end. EUR eased from levels just under 1.24 before falling a 1.2360-1.2380 range, and reticent to test the day&#39;s highs.<br /><br />* GBP: ticked higher following comments from Germany&#39;s Brexit negotiator who said &#39;a lot of progress&#39; was being made in talks. EURGBP, however, remains contained within the 50dma (at 88.42) and 200dma (at 0.8891) range. Cable, meanwhile, is on course for the fifth positive day against the USD, but action seems capped by 1.40.<br /><br />* CAD trading within a range of 1.2970 and 1.2940, little market moving news throughout the day and trading flat.<br /><br />* JPY: found a bid amid the soft risk tone, taking its cue from softer equities and a fragile buck. USDJPY was moving away from overnight highs around the 106.70 area, falling to test 106.00, though the level held.<br /><br />* RUB: The RUB weakened after tensions between the UK and Russia ratcheted up. USDRUB moved towards the top-end of its recent range, around 57.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* TREASURIES: 10 YEAR T-NOTE FUTURES (JUNE 2018) SETTLES 7 TICKS HIGHER AT 120-17+. Bull-flattening along the curve was the theme again, with shorted yields slightly positive, and the long-end rallied by around 4bps. Major curves were mixed; the 2s5s was c.1bps narrower, 2s30s flat, 5s30s flat, and the 5s10s was wider by c.2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* CRUDE: was supported in early trade after encouraging data out of China&rsquo;s industrial sector. However, the global risk tone clearly remains fragile, as was evidenced after the US cash equity open today, when stocks dropped &ndash; taking crude with it &ndash; in early trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude inventories rose by 5.022mln barrels, according to DOE data, eclipsing the forecast of a 2.023mln build, and the API&rsquo;s data, which on Tuesday showed a build of 1.156mln. Cushing stocks saw a build of 338k, in line with what Genscape had estimated earlier in the week, though off the API&rsquo;s reported 156k draw. There were sharp draws in the products, with the distillates draw far deeper than expected (draw 4.36mln vs an expected draw of 1.52mln), while gasoline drew by 6.271mln (deeper than the draw of 1.18mln forecast). In a knee jerk reaction, oil prices slipped on the headline, though the focus quickly shifted to the product draw, and crude pared back losses to trade higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC&rsquo;s monthly oil market report added to the oversupply narrative, raising its non-OPEC production forecast to 1.66mln BPD in 2018 (it had previously forecast growth of 1.40mln BPD in its prior report). The cartel also trimmed demand estimates for its crude by 250k BPD in 2018 to 32.61mln BPD, but nudged up its view of global oil demand growth to 1.6mln BPD in 2018 (from 1.59mln in the previous report). Meanwhile, on the positive side, OPEC&rsquo;s output was said to fall by 77k BPD in February to 32.186mln BPD, secondary sources reported, and compliance with the output cut deal rose to 147%.</p>\r\n",

However, the global risk tone clearly remains fragile, as was evidenced after the US cash equity open today, when stocks dropped &ndash; taking crude with it &ndash; in early trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude inventories rose by 5.022mln barrels, according to DOE data, eclipsing the forecast of a 2.023mln build, and the API&rsquo;s data, which on Tuesday showed a build of 1.156mln. Cushing stocks saw a build of 338k, in line with what Genscape had estimated earlier in the week, though off the API&rsquo;s reported 156k draw. There were sharp draws in the products, with the distillates draw far deeper than expected (draw 4.36mln vs an expected draw of 1.52mln), while gasoline drew by 6.271mln (deeper than the draw of 1.18mln forecast). In a knee jerk reaction, oil prices slipped on the headline, though the focus quickly shifted to the product draw, and crude pared back losses to trade higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC&rsquo;s monthly oil market report added to the oversupply narrative, raising its non-OPEC production forecast to 1.66mln BPD in 2018 (it had previously forecast growth of 1.40mln BPD in its prior report). The cartel also trimmed demand estimates for its crude by 250k BPD in 2018 to 32.61mln BPD, but nudged up its view of global oil demand growth to 1.6mln BPD in 2018 (from 1.59mln in the previous report). Meanwhile, on the positive side, OPEC&rsquo;s output was said to fall by 77k BPD in February to 32.186mln BPD, secondary sources reported, and compliance with the output cut deal rose to 147%.</p>\r\n",

Aud/Usd finally breached 0.7900, but ran into heavy supply before the next chart resistance level at 0.7925 and subsequently retreated below the big figure again amidst a broader Greenback uptick (DXY bouncing off near 89.500 lows towards 89.890). Eur/Usd just held above 30 DMA support at 1.2345, while Eur/Gbp dipped under 0.8850 at one stage on more reports that the UK and EU are very close to a Brexit withdrawal agreement, though Cable failed to re-test 1.4000 and drifted down towards the round number below. Usd/Chf remained above 0.9450 within a 0.9425-80 range, perhaps eyeing more Chf is highly overvalued rhetoric from the SNB tomorrow. However, Usd/Jpy breached its 10 DMA at 106.31 and now looking at buying interest around 106.20 ahead of 106.00 after import buying interest prompted a short squeeze earlier in the week. Usd/Cad and Nzd/Usd are both ending the session pretty flat but closer to highs and lows respectively circa 1.2960 and 0.7320. Eur/Nok knocking around 9.5700 and expecting a hawkish shift from the Norges Bank on Thursday via rate hike guidance brought forward from Autumn this year at the previous policy meeting. Note, full previews for both available via the Research Suite. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) were negative with financials pressured amid the ongoing royal commission hearings in which NAB employees were said to knowingly approved fake loans to reach targets, while Nikkei 225 was pressured by a firmer JPY and with some analysts also noting &lsquo;Abexit&rsquo; worries in the wake of the land-sale/cronyism scandal. Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) and Hang Seng (-1.4%) conformed to the weakness with tech and telecom names weighed as the US seeks to impose tariffs of USD 60bln on Chinese goods, which would target tech and telecom products as a punishment for intellectual property infringement. Although, losses in the mainland were somewhat stemmed by mixed data including higher than expected Industrial Production and Fixed Asset Investments. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat despite the weakness in stocks, with an uneventful BoJ minutes release and unchanged BoJ Rinban operation amount for 1yr-10yr maturities also ensured quiet price action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BoJ Minutes from the January 22nd-23rd meeting stated it is appropriate to pursue powerful easing and that price momentum to reach target is maintained. (Newswires) </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda stated that the BoJ is still a long way from target for inflation and is not at the point to consider exit details. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ECB</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB President Draghi said performance of underlying inflation remains subdued; currently see inflation converging towards aim over the medium term. Draghi added that there are two risks that could conspire to reduce confidence in inflation: 1. An escalation of US trade measures and 2. Developments in FX markets. (ECB)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Praet said cannot yet declare mission accomplished on inflation but substantial progress has been made. Reiterates policy to be patient, persistent and prudent. (ECB)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Coeure said the economic expansion is &ldquo;very strong&rdquo; but inflation is not at the desired level. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Mersch said that the ECB are not yet ready at this stage to change interest rates. (ECB)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Constancio said euro area asset prices currently do not point to signs of a general overvaluation in the euro area and certainly not of credit-fuelled bubbles. (ECB)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BREXIT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany&#39;s Brexit negotiator Ptassek said Brexit negotiations are accelerating and a lot of progress is being made on withdrawal agreement. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May&#39;s Brexit Committee is said to agree to extend freedom of movement with the EU until 2021. (The Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DATA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eurozone Industrial Production MM (Jan) -1.0% vs. Exp. -0.4% (Prev. 0.4%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eurozone Employment Change QQ (Q4) 0.3% vs. Exp. 0.3% (Prev. 0.4%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swedish CPI YY (Feb) 1.6% vs. Exp. 1.6% (Prev. 1.6%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are trading in the green this morning, subsequently pairing the initial losses that stemmed from Asian and US bourses, which saw risk-sentiment soured by reports of Secretary of State Tillerson being fired and increased caution over trade wars. All major sectors with the exception of utilities are trading higher in the Euro Stoxx, while much of the morning stock movers have been dictated by company earnings, with Adidas (+9%) shares sitting at the top of DAX. Elsewhere, the IBEX underperforms its counterparts as index heavyweight Inditex (-3%) slipped after highlighting concerns over FX headwinds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd weakness amidst ongoing global trade war and White House personnel concerns remains the principle theme, as the DXY continues to reject advances towards the 90.000 level and beyond, which in turn is shifting the technical outlook more bearish. However, Eur/Usd and single currency crosses have been knocked back to an extent by comments from ECB President Draghi and Chief Economist Praet, reiterating that inflation is still below target and therefore policy needs to stay &lsquo;patient, persistent and prudent&rsquo;. Key downside risks were highlighted &ndash; FX and the aforementioned potentially adverse trade developments due to US President Trump&rsquo;s import tariff proposals. Eur/Usd is back below 1.2400, but holding above the 30 DMA at 1.2345, and also eyeing decent expiry interest from 1.2390-1.2405 (around 1 bn). Conversely, Aud/Usd is testing resistance either side of the 0.7900 handle again and recent peaks just below the big figure, aided by some Chinese data beats overnight and more balanced rather than dovish/cautious RBA rhetoric via Assistant Governor Kent. Chart-wise, yesterday&rsquo;s 0.7898 high forms the first/nearest bullish target and offers are touted around 0.7925, if 0.7900 is breached. Cable looks capped by the 1.4000 level, and Usd/Cad by 1.3000, while Usd/Jpy is back in the 106.50 area after a further retreat from 107.00+ peaks late last week and earlier this week with the 10 DMA at 106.31 holding in for now. Elsewhere, Eur/Sek just a fraction softer after broadly as forecast Swedish CPI data that will underscore growing calls for the Riksbank to refrain from tightening for longer.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No real surprise to see the German benchmark unsettled by a far from well received 30 year tap by all conventional measures used to gauge the success of issuance, bar a lower average yield vs the previous offering of the same maturity. 10 year Bunds have now been as low as 157.34, 13 ticks below yesterday&rsquo;s Eurex close and 33 ticks down from the early session peak. However, UK Gilts and USTs remain relatively bid despite ongoing resilience across EU bourses in the face of latest Wall Street wobbles and declines in Asia-Pac equities on protectionism and US President Trump&rsquo;s latest changes in high ranking members of the administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany sold EUR 1.211bln vs. Exp. EUR 1.5bln of 30-year bunds: B/C 1.06 (Prev. 1.51), Avg yield 1.27% (Prev. 0.69), Retention 19.3% (Prev. 16.9%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodity bloc, oil prices are trading slightly higher with prices finding some slight reprieve from yesterday&rsquo;s smaller than expected build in the latest API report, alongside the improvement in risk sentiment, which has seen WTI retest USD 61/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Ministry says crude exports to remain under 7mln bpd in April and production under 10mln bpd. OPEC and non-OPEC partners remain committed to returning inventories to normal levels. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Equities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are trading in the green this morning, subsequently pairing the initial losses that stemmed from Asian and US bourses, which saw risk-sentiment soured by reports of Secretary of State Tillerson being fired and increased caution over trade wars. All major sectors with the exception of utilities are trading higher in the Euro Stoxx, while much of the morning stock movers have been dictated by company earnings, with Adidas (+9%) shares sitting at the top of DAX. Elsewhere, the IBEX underperforms its counterparts as index heavyweight Inditex (-3%) slipped after highlighting concerns over FX headwinds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd weakness amidst ongoing global trade war and White House personnel concerns remains the principle theme, as the DXY continues to reject advances towards the 90.000 level and beyond, which in turn is shifting the technical outlook more bearish. However, Eur/Usd and single currency crosses have been knocked back to an extent by comments from ECB President Draghi and Chief Economist Praet, reiterating that inflation is still below target and therefore policy needs to stay &lsquo;patient, persistent and prudent&rsquo;. Key downside risks were highlighted &ndash; FX and the aforementioned potentially adverse trade developments due to US President Trump&rsquo;s import tariff proposals. Eur/Usd is back below 1.2400, but holding above the 30 DMA at 1.2345, and also eyeing decent expiry interest from 1.2390-1.2405 (around 1 bn). Conversely, Aud/Usd is testing resistance either side of the 0.7900 handle again and recent peaks just below the big figure, aided by some Chinese data beats overnight and more balanced rather than dovish/cautious RBA rhetoric via Assistant Governor Kent. Chart-wise, yesterday&rsquo;s 0.7898 high forms the first/nearest bullish target and offers are touted around 0.7925, if 0.7900 is breached. Cable looks capped by the 1.4000 level, and Usd/Cad by 1.3000, while Usd/Jpy is back in the 106.50 area after a further retreat from 107.00+ peaks late last week and earlier this week with the 10 DMA at 106.31 holding in for now. Elsewhere, Eur/Sek just a fraction softer after broadly as forecast Swedish CPI data that will underscore growing calls for the Riksbank to refrain from tightening for longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixed Income</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have derived a degree of support from weaker than expected Eurozone ip data, but are still only mid-range between 157.41-67 Eurex parameters having pulled back relatively sharply from the high. It seems that intraday and/or longer term longs were unsettled by the fact that the 10 year future held below the March peak in early exchanges, while a recovery in EU equities has also diminished the safe-haven allure of core bonds. However, Gilts are retaining modest outperformance after Tuesday&rsquo;s Spring Budget around the 121.50 mark vs 121.60 at best and a 121.41 base, while US Treasuries remain firm and in bull-flattening mode ahead of retail sales and PPI data. Back to Eurozone debt, some underperformance in the periphery and Spanish Bonos especially, with Portuguese and long end German supply looming, and despite a raft of mainly dovish ECB commentary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodity bloc, oil prices are trading slightly higher with prices finding some slight reprieve from yesterday&rsquo;s smaller than expected build in the latest API report, alongside the improvement in risk sentiment, which has seen WTI retest USD 61/bbl.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Usd weakness amidst ongoing global trade war and White House personnel concerns remains the principle theme, as the DXY continues to reject advances towards the 90.000 level and beyond, which in turn is shifting the technical outlook more bearish. However, Eur/Usd and single currency crosses have been knocked back to an extent by comments from ECB President Draghi and Chief Economist Praet, reiterating that inflation is still below target and therefore policy needs to stay &lsquo;patient, persistent and prudent&rsquo;. Key downside risks were highlighted &ndash; FX and the aforementioned potentially adverse trade developments due to US President Trump&rsquo;s import tariff proposals. Eur/Usd is back below 1.2400, but holding above the 30 DMA at 1.2345, and also eyeing decent expiry interest from 1.2390-1.2405 (around 1 bn). Conversely, Aud/Usd is testing resistance either side of the 0.7900 handle again and recent peaks just below the big figure, aided by some Chinese data beats overnight and more balanced rather than dovish/cautious RBA rhetoric via Assistant Governor Kent. Chart-wise, yesterday&rsquo;s 0.7898 high forms the first/nearest bullish target and offers are touted around 0.7925, if 0.7900 is breached. Cable looks capped by the 1.4000 level, and Usd/Cad by 1.3000, while Usd/Jpy is back in the 106.50 area after a further retreat from 107.00+ peaks late last week and earlier this week with the 10 DMA at 106.31 holding in for now. Elsewhere, Eur/Sek just a fraction softer after broadly as forecast Swedish CPI data that will underscore growing calls for the Riksbank to refrain from tightening for longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) were negative with financials pressured amid the ongoing royal commission hearings in which NAB employees were said to knowingly approved fake loans to reach targets, while Nikkei 225 was pressured by a firmer JPY and with some analysts also noting &lsquo;Abexit&rsquo; worries in the wake of the land-sale/cronyism scandal.

This benefitted the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts overnight with EUR/USD back above the 1.2400 level, while GBP/USD eyed the 1.4000 handle.

However, oil saw some mild reprieve in late US trade on the release of the latest API inventory report which showed a lower than expected build in crude stockpiles and drawdowns across the other product components.

The US treasury sold USD 13bln of 30yr bonds at high yield of 3.109% softer cover than recent averages (2.38x vs 2.41x over the last six), with uninspiring internals (smallest indirect participation since November 2016, while directs took the largest share since October 2015).

ASX 200 (-0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) are negative with financials pressured amid the ongoing royal commission hearings in which NAB were said to knowingly approved fake loans to reach targets, while Nikkei 225 is pressured by a firmer JPY and with some analysts also noting Abexit worries in the wake of the land-sale/cronyism scandal. Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) and Hang Seng (-1.1%) are also downbeat with tech and telecom names weighed as the US is seeking to impose tariffs of USD 60bln on Chinese goods, which would target tech and telecom products as a punishment for intellectual property infringement. Although, losses in the mainland are somewhat stemmed by mixed data including higher than expected Industrial Production and Fixed Asset Investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD is weaker overnight after Tillerson&rsquo;s ouster added to the political instability concerns and already high staff turnover at the White House. This has benefitted the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts overnight with EUR/USD back above the 1.2400 level, while GBP/USD eyes a reclaim of the 1.4000 handle. Elsewhere, antipodeans are underpinned as stronger than expected Chinese Industrial Production and Fixed Assets Investment slightly overshadowed the miss on Retail Sales, while USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are mixed with the Japanese currency mostly retaining the gains seen from the risk averse tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are mildly higher amid the weakness in stocks, and with the BoJ present in the market for 1-10yr JGBs in which the amounts of the Rinban operation were kept unchanged.</p>\r\n",
