BoC said it removed reference to gradual pace of rate hikes to avoid the impression that it is following a preordained, mechanical policy path and said that core measures of inflation all remain around 2% which is consistent with an economy that is at capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoC Governor Poloz said every one of our interest rate meetings is live and the use of the word &quot;gradual&quot; didn&#39;t mean we would only move every other meeting as some in markets thought, while he also said US tensions with China could impact Canadian export growth. Elsewhere, BoC&#39;s Wilkins said monetary policy remains stimulative and the policy rate is still negative in real terms, while Wilkins also commented that although focus of many commentators tends to be on the downside risks, it is also possible that strong consumer confidence builds on solid job and income growth which leads to greater-than-expected consumption.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Beige Book stated that US manufacturers reported higher prices as tariffs pushed up the costs of raw materials and that consumer spending increased at a modest pace, while inflation ranged from modest to moderate. Several Fed districts also reported that firms faced rising materials and shipping costs, as well as uncertainties over trade and difficulty finding qualified workers. Furthermore, the Beige Book noted the US economy expanded and that most districts reported modest to moderate growth. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Mester (Voter, Hawk) said a prolonged market downturn and build up in risks would affect US economic data and added she is not adjusting her policy stance based on the recent market drop. Furthermore, Mester said inflation expectations have been very stable and that the Fed will not overreact to temporary moves in inflation, while she also suggested Fed is getting closer to &quot;neutral&quot; policy and are more sensitive to incoming data. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bostic (Voter, dove) said the Fed is of the mind to let the economy stand on its own and that the US economy is chugging along quite well.

Boeing (BA) moved higher after increasing its profit outlook for the year. AT&amp;T (T) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT) fell lower than expected EPS, whereas Varian Medical Systems (VAR), DTE Energy (DTE) and Texas Instruments (TXN) moved higher after beating their EPS estimates. A revenue miss for General Dynamics (GD) caused the stock dip lower. DXC Technologies (DXC) was also a bottom mover following the resignation of its VP of the Americas region. United Parcel Service (UPS) traded lower after commenting on headwinds it&rsquo;s facing from trade tensions. Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG) traded higher as did the wider consumer staples sector on what was a mainly negative day for stocks. SPX -3.23% at 2653, NDX -4.76% at 6784, DJI -2.40% at 24595.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bias was towards lower yields as equities saw another red day; although yields fell by between 2-6bps across the curve, major curve spreads were mixed, and with bull-steepening observed. The Treasury 5-year auction saw a tail of 0.6bps, with some desks noting that the lack of concession and the larger auction size was a negative. The internals were grim, with dealer participation rising sharply, and direct bidder participation collapsing &ndash; similar to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 2-year paper. US T-note futures (Z8) settle 11+ ticks higher at 118-20.</p>\r\n",

Weds AMC earnings from MSFT, V, F, AMD, TSLA; Thurs earnings include AMZN, GOOGL, INTC, MCK, VLO, CMCSA, BUD, AAL, MRK, COP, MO, RTN, IP, UNP, BMY, AEP, WM, MMC, RCL, TWTR, SNAP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>The Bank of Canada raised rates by 25bps, and removed language that it would continue to hike at a &ldquo;gradual&rdquo; pace, though it retained its language about how future rate rises were needed (&ldquo;Governing Council agrees that the policy interest rate will need to rise to a neutral stance to achieve the inflation target.&rdquo;). The BOC also held on to its data-dependent approach to policy setting. &ldquo;The upbeat communique was not necessarily echoed in the MPR, as both GDP and inflation saw downward revisions. That said, the BoC is notably more convinced on the growth rotation narrative thanks to the NAFTA resolve, which likely prompted the hawkish tweaks in the policy statement,&rdquo; TD Securities said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NEW HOME SALES: </strong>September new home sales data was depressed by Hurricane Michael, and saw a decline of 5.5% in the month to 553k, while the net revisions to the last three months&rsquo; data was -55k. Pantheon Macroeconomics attributed the weakness to weather conditions which it suggests the market ignored and expects a rebound in the months ahead. However, it still notes that &ldquo;the bigger picture is one of a market under pressure from rising rates and the beginnings of a cyclical tightening in lending standards. Rising inventory is depressing prices; the monthly data are wild but the y/y rate of change in median prices fell to -0.4% in September, the first decline since early 2012.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> Following the meeting of the Conservative Party 1922 Backbench Committee, several Conservative Party members who were present at the meeting said the party mood is to support PM May, indicating that despite her recent troubles, there is still support for the PM. Earlier in the session, EU Council Head Tusk says there is no guarantee that a hard Irish border can be avoided; adding that Brexiteers are completely responsible for the border problem. PM May Spokesman says the PM has been clear that she does not want to enter into an indefinite post Brexit implementation period. Meanwhile, the Irish PM continues to sound-off his familiar warnings. On the regulatory front, an EU document sees potential financial stability risks if UK firms are barred from clearing EU business in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and said that the EU could allow UK clearing for EU customers on a temporary basis to give the bloc more time to build up its own clearing capacity; the article also noted that financial stability risks from a no-deal Brexit have &#39;diminished significantly&#39; as UK-based firms move contracts and operations to the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>After the EU took unprecedented action in rejecting Italy&rsquo;s 2019 budget, finance minister Tria continued the nation&rsquo;s confrontational and defiant stance against the EU, stating that the budget is correct and he sees no reason to present the EU with a new one; Tria did note, however, that if we were to see a repeat of 2008 crisis, the budget will be changed. Elsewhere, Italian cabinet undersecretary Giorgetti stated that if the Bund/BTP spread widened towards 400bps, Italian banks would need to be recapitalised, and stated that the government be ready to intervene immediately if required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Mester (hawk, voter) said a prolonged market downturn and build-up in risks would affect US economic data, though she is not adjusting her policy stance based on the recent market drop. Elsewhere, she added that tariffs are a potential risk to the US economy; she sees no signs of a pending US recession, and noted that inflation expectations had been very stable. Mester also said that agents within her district had suggested they are able to raise prices. She also argued that we are approaching the neutral rate, and the Fed has become more sensitive to incoming economic data. In the longer-term, Mester sees the FFR target at 3.0%, in line with the FOMC&rsquo;s latest projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED BEIGE BOOK: </strong>US manufactures reported raising prices as tariffs pushed up the costs of raw materials, consumer spending increased at a modest pace, inflation ranged from modest to moderate. Several Fed districts reported that firms faced rising materials and shipping costs, uncertainties over trade and difficulty finding qualified workers. The Beige Book found that the US economy expanded, with most districts reporting &quot;modest to moderate growth&quot;; employment expanded modestly/moderately across the US too, employers cited shortages of workers including highly skilled engineers, finance &amp; sales professionals and construction and manufacturing workers; wage growth characterised as mostly modest to moderate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -3.23% at 2653, NDX -4.76% at 6784, DJI -2.40% at 24595. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -3.73%, Materials -3.08%, Industrials -3.35%, Cons Discretionary -3.31%, Cons Staples +0.51%, Healthcare -3.32%, Financials -2.73%, Tech -4.39%, Telecoms -4.93%, Utilities +2.29%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITES: </strong>The S&amp;P 500 finished red for the sixth straight session, with traders citing mixed earnings (beats from Boeing, which also raised guidance; misses from AT&amp;T and Texas Instruments), while attention remains on corporate margins amid concerns that rising prices will begin to weigh on economic growth; weak economic data (new home sales) on Wednesday did little to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Boeing (BA) moved higher after increasing its profit outlook for the year. AT&amp;T (T) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT) fell lower than expected EPS, whereas Varian Medical Systems (VAR), DTE Energy (DTE) and Texas Instruments (TXN) moved higher after beating their EPS estimates. A revenue miss for General Dynamics (GD) caused the stock dip lower. DXC Technologies (DXC) was also a bottom mover following the resignation of its VP of the Americas region. United Parcel Service (UPS) traded lower after commenting on headwinds it&rsquo;s facing from trade tensions. Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG) traded higher as did the wider consumer staples sector on what was a mainly negative day for stocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES $0.39 HIGHER AT $66.82/BBL; BRENT (Z8) SETTLES $0.27 LOWER AT $76.17/BBL. </strong>Crude staged a mini bounce back on Wednesday, coming off lows seen on Tuesday, though it wasn&rsquo;t enough to pare away Tuesday&rsquo;s heavy losses, and ultimately, the complex ended mixed. Markets were &ldquo;seeing sine bargain hunting emerge at the lower levels reached on Tuesday in the hope that the market has already seen a considerable array of bearish news,&rdquo; Citi said, &ldquo;the drop likely priced in some further increase in Saudi and OPEC total oil production as promised in recent statements from Saudi oil minister Al-Falih.&rdquo; Weekly data from the DOE showed headline crude stocks building more than expected (6.346mln vs 3.69mln expected), and Cushing stocks also saw a build of 1.37mln, slightly higher than Genscape was said to have forecast this week. The products both drew down, with distillates drawing more than expected (2.26mln vs 1.93ln expected) and gasoline drew down by 4.826mln vs an expected 1.878mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 11+ TICKS HIGHER AT 118-20.</strong> The bias was towards lower yields as equities saw another red day; although yields fell by between 2-6bps across the curve, major curve spreads were mixed, and with bull-steepening observed. The Treasury 5-year auction saw a tail of 0.6bps, with some desks noting that the lack of concession and the larger auction size was a negative. The internals were grim, with dealer participation rising sharply, and direct bidder participation collapsing &ndash; similar to Tuesday&rsquo;s auction of 2-year paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 7-YEAR PREVIEW:</strong> The US Treasury will auction USD 127bln in 2-year (USD 38bln, Tuesday), 5-year (USD 39bln, Wednesday), 7-year (USD 31bln, Thursday), as well a 2-year FRN (USD 19bln, Wednesday). With around USD 110.7bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, the auctions will raise USD 16.3bln in new cash, TD Securities notes; the bank also points out that the Fed&#39;s balance sheet run-off will get into full swing this month, with the cap rising to USD 30bln (though USD 23.8bln in Fed holdings will mature), and TD says that the Fed will therefore allow the entire amount to run off and will not add on to any auctions this month. TD says that recent averages suggest a stop on the screws, but it would not be surprised to see a modest tail after last month&#39;s weak auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Greenback has extended gains vs almost all G10 counterparts, and has turned the tables on several EM rivals, bar the RUB and TRY, which remain on course to clock gains ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s CBR and CBT policy meetings. However, the Rouble got a rather unexpected boost from reports that no further US sanctions against Russia are in the offing, albeit still under consideration, while the Lira&rsquo;s rebound seemed more consolidative &ndash; Usd/Rub sub-65.00 at one stage and Usd/Try under 5.6800. Back to the Dollar, and looking at the index, 96.000 has been breached more convincingly along with a couple of chart resistance levels that had been holding, and 96.542 was reached before some loss of momentum amidst recoveries in rival currencies. However, from a solely technical perspective, 96.984 is exposed and marks the ytd peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, SEK: </strong>Both prone to Central Bank impulses and with quite divergent results as the Loonie continued its rebound from recent 1.3100+ lows vs the Usd to trade just above 1.3000 on the back of the BoC&rsquo;s hawkish 25bps hike. To recap, guidance for further tightening was maintained, but the word &lsquo;gradual&rsquo; was removed, and perhaps in reference to latest weaker than forecast headline CPI data the Canadian CB noted that core inflation is averaging 2% and consistent with the economy running at capacity. Conversely, the Sek has been mostly weaker in wake of the Riksbank&rsquo;s dovish hold, as options were left open for a December or February 2019 repo rise even though the 2 arch dissenters both voted for a 25 bp hike this time. Eur/Sek rallied to just shy of 10.3900 at one stage, but now back towards mid-range around 10.3600 on Governor Ingves&rsquo; post-meeting presser stressing that the time for a hike is getting closer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP:</strong> Still the major laggards and outperformers as the single currency was undermined by disappointing flash Eurozone PMIs and tested bids/support under 1.1400 vs the Usd ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s ECB meet, while ongoing Brexit uncertainty dragged Cable under 1.2900 ahead of UK PM May&rsquo;s appearance before the 1922 backbenchers and before decent chart levels held circa 1.1390 and 1.2890.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>In stark contrast to the Rub and Try, it was buy the rumour and sell the fact for the Zar that slumped to 14.5200+ lows vs 14.1500 highs vs the Usd on a downbeat SA MTBS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP &ndash; ECB:</strong> Monetary Policy Decision Due At 12:45 BST, 13:45 CET, 07:45 EDT, On Thursday 25th October 2018, Press Conference Due At 13:30 BST, 14:30 CET, 08:30 EDT. Unanimous expectations look for the ECB to leave its three key rates unchanged. Markets await any updates on the Bank&rsquo;s reinvestment policy after Draghi stated the issue will be discussed before the end of 2018. Draghi likely to be grilled on the Bank&rsquo;s concerns over Italy&rsquo;s budgetary demands. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20385/download\">Click here to read full report.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP &ndash; NORGES BANK: </strong>The Norges Bank is unanimously expected to maintain interest rates at 0.75% at its interim October meeting on Thursday, according to 17 economists polled, with all but one expecting the next rate increase to come in March next year. This is an &ldquo;in-between&rdquo; meeting, where there is no press conference and the only release is the Executive Board&rsquo;s statement of the decision. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20374/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP &ndash; CBRT:</strong> The consensus expects the Turkish Central Bank to maintain its Repo Rate at 24.00%. The TRY has appreciated after the Turkish authorities took action to de-escalate tensions with the US, as well as the announcement of a fiscal plan to improve public finances; however, the inflation situation still remains a concern, after September CPI jumped from 17.9% to 24.5%. &quot;The Taylor Rule tells us that rates should be hiked to 36.3% based on these numbers. Core inflation at 24% suggests only slightly lower rates at 35.6%. Whichever view one prefers, with CPI expected to rise in the coming months, the level of interest rates remains too low,&quot; TD Securities writes. But TD observes that the central bank has been lifting rates this year in response to currency weakness, not after bad inflation prints. And, therefore, given the recent appreciation of the currency, TD suggests that the CBRT will not feel compelled to pre-empt any further rises in CPI, most likely opting to hold rates. In terms of the market reaction, TD believes the USDTRY pair will remain relatively unchanged if the central bank leaves rates unchanged, but delivers convincing hawkish language of tightening to come as we are looking for could lead to a knee-jerk moves of between 0.5% and 1.0% while the market digests the details of the announcement. And in terms of risks, &quot;a surprise hike could push USDTRY 1-3% lower, depending on its magnitude,&quot; TD says, &quot;while a hold accompanied by markedly less hawkish rhetoric would push USDTRY higher, with the 6.95/6.00handle back in sight.&quot;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback has extended gains vs almost all G10 counterparts, and has turned the tables on several EM rivals, bar the RUB and TRY, which remain on course to clock gains ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s CBR and CBT policy meetings. However, the Rouble got a rather unexpected boost from reports that no further US sanctions against Russia are in the offing, albeit still under consideration, while the Lira&rsquo;s rebound seemed more consolidative &ndash; Usd/Rub sub-65.00 at one stage and Usd/Try under 5.6800. Back to the Dollar, and looking at the index, 96.000 has been breached more convincingly along with a couple of chart resistance levels that had been holding, and 96.542 was reached before some loss of momentum amidst recoveries in rival currencies. However, from a solely technical perspective, 96.984 is exposed and marks the ytd peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both prone to Central Bank impulses and with quite divergent results as the Loonie continued its rebound from recent 1.3100+ lows vs the Usd to trade just above 1.3000 on the back of the BoC&rsquo;s hawkish &frac14; point hike. To recap, guidance for further tightening was maintained, but the word &lsquo;gradual&rsquo; was removed, and perhaps in reference to latest weaker than forecast headline CPI data the Canadian CB noted that core inflation is averaging 2% and consistent with the economy running at capacity. Conversely, the Sek has been mostly weaker in wake of the Riksbank&rsquo;s dovish hold, as options were left open for a December or February 2019 repo rise even though the 2 arch dissenters both voted for a 25 bp hike this time. Eur/Sek rallied to just shy of 10.3900 at one stage, but now back towards mid-range around 10.3600 on Governor Ingves&rsquo; post-meeting presser stressing that the time for a hike is getting closer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still the major laggards and outperformers as the single currency was undermined by disappointing flash Eurozone PMIs and tested bids/support under 1.1400 vs the Usd ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s ECB meet, while ongoing Brexit uncertainty dragged Cable under 1.2900 ahead of UK PM May&rsquo;s appearance before the 1922 backbenchers and before decent chart levels held circa 1.1390 and 1.2890.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stark contrast to the Rub and Try, it was buy the rumour and sell the fact for the Zar that slumped to 14.5200+ lows vs 14.1500 highs vs the Usd on a downbeat SA MTBS.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) opened higher on early bargain hunting following their recent declines and as the aggressive recovery stateside reverberated in the region. However, both indices failed to sustain their gains as commodity-related sectors dragged on Australia with energy the underperforner after a near-5% slip in oil prices, while the Japanese benchmark was temperamental and made several attempts on the 22000 level to the downside. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.4%) conformed to the volatile tone and swung between gains and losses amid indecisiveness due to on-going trade concerns and further efforts by Chinese authorities including a respectable liquidity injection by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher as prices benefitted from the overnight volatility and with today&rsquo;s BoJ Rinban operation heavily focused on the belly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 150bln via 7-day reverse repos. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.9357 (Prev. 6.9338)<br /><br />China NDRC said it is to increase support to stabilize jobs in the region that are most affected by US-China trade dispute, while there were separate reports that some Shenzhen companies received government funds. (Newswires/China Securities Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May reportedly held a cabinet meeting that some noted as &lsquo;impassioned&rsquo; while others described it to have been a row, in which several ministers insisted she negotiate a time limit to any Brexit backstop and reports noted increases the pressure to achieve a deal she can sell to her own party. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Cabinet papers revealed the next phase of Brexit planning in which the transition is to last for years and could be a long-running multi-year transition, while Northern Ireland is to be in a separate VAT area. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian Finance Minister Tria is seeking a way out of budget impasse and sees more prudence from cabinet; adding that he thinks Italy must be ready to respond to markets. Meanwhile, Deputy PM Salvini reiterated that Italy will not change its budget, and Italy will not leave the euro or the EU. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Council Head Tusk says there is no guarantee that a hard Irish border can be avoided; adding that Brexiteers are completely responsible for the border problem. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy Cabinet Undersecretary Giorgetti says IT/GE spread near 400bps would mean bank recap. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Markit Services Flash PMI (Oct) 53.3 vs. Exp. 54.5 (Prev. 54.7)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Markit Comp Flash PMI (Oct) 52.7 vs. Exp. 53.9 (Prev. 54.1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Markit Manufacturing Flash PMI (Oct) 52.1 vs. Exp. 53.0 (Prev. 53.2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Markit Manufacturing Flash PMI (Oct) 52.3 vs. Exp. 53.4 (Prev. 53.7)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Markit Services Flash PMI (Oct) 53.6 vs. Exp. 55.5 (Prev. 55.9)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swedish Riksbank Rate -0.50% vs. Exp. -0.5% (Prev. -0.5%). The Riksbank stated that the forecast for the repo rate path is the same as in September and anticipated that the repo rate will be lifted by 25bps in either December or February. Floden and Ohlsson dissented against the decision to hold the repo rate unchanged and advocated to lift rates by 25bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank&#39;s Governor Ingves says that underlying inflation is a little weak, but price pressures are seen rising; he adds that sometime around year end is probably the time to hike rates. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump reportedly stepped up criticism of Fed Chairman Powell raising rates, while he also said it is too early to tell but that he maybe regrets appointing Powell. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Pompeo said will revoke visas for those identified as responsible for killing journalist Khashoggi and that it would not be the last step but added shared strategic interests with Saudi Arabia remain, while Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said to stay tuned regarding Canada&#39;s arms exports to Saudi Arabia. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are mostly higher, albeit off highs seen at the cash open as positive sentiment slowly fades away and US equity futures extended losses. The SMI (+0.5%) outperforms with Nestle (+1.0%) and Swiss Re (+0.8) lifting the index. The IT sector is under further pressure after yesterday&#39;s slump, amid uninspiring earnings from STMicroelectronics (-8.8%), which in turn is weighing on chip makers across the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, luxury names are lifted the on back of Kering (+7.5%) after reporting a beat on earnings aided significantly by Gucci sales, with other names such as LVMH (+1.3%) and Hermes (+2.0%) move in sympathy. Furthermore, Vinci (+3.5%) are higher following a 7% beat on their revenue growth, while Deutsche Bank (-3.7%) are in the red after cutting revenue guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - Propping up the G10 pile, but for different reasons as the single currency breached technical support around 1.1430 vs the Usd and tripped stops below 1.1425 in wake of prelim Eurozone PMIs that fell short of expectations, and with the pan manufacturing survey particularly weak given sub-50 new orders. Meanwhile, Cable retreated further from 1.3000+ highs to trigger some chart-related offers around 1.2937 ahead of UK PM May&rsquo;s 1922 showdown and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, which is keeping the Eur/Gbp cross above 0.8800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - Clawing back lost ground, largely due to the aforementioned Eur weakness, having weakened to circa 10.3900 and not far from heavy supply/resistance at 10.4000 following the latest Riksbank policy meeting, as guidance was maintained for a hike either in December or February next year. This, despite recent Swedish inflation data surprising to the upside and 2 hawkish dissenters calling for a 25 bp rise in the repo. However, the consensus remains for gradual normalisation and an expansionary stance to continue for an extended period even after the 1st tightening for years is delivered. Hence, Eur/Sek back down to 10.3300, or just under, and Eur/Nok following suit (sub-9.5000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The broad Dollar and index are benefiting from the demise of most major rivals, as overall risk sentiment wobbles again after signs of a revival on Tuesday and overnight. The DXY is just off 96.341 highs, and finally breached a key level around 96.150 that has been capping rallies, with bulls now eyeing 96.402.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie continues to bounce off lows circa 1.3100 vs its US counterpart, even though oil prices have declined further, and the Cad&rsquo;s relative resistance appears in large part down to overwhelming expectations that the BoC will deliver a 25 bp rate hike later today.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - The antipodean Dollars have both slipped back from overnight peaks, as the Yuans weaken and the aforementioned Chinese-led global stock market recovery wanes. Aud/Usd is back under 0.7100 and Nzd/Usd pivoting 0.6550, with the Kiwi now looking towards NZ trade data for some independent impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Perversely perhaps, the 2 classic safe-havens are not performing that well, as Usd/Jpy hovers above 112.50 and the Franc trades either side of 0.9950, albeit the latter firmer vs the Eur (cross down through 1.1400).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is moving sideways, off yesterday&#39;s highs as the yellow metal detaches itself from USD action to moves in lockstep with risk sentiment, as markets are focused on the Italian budget, trade tensions and concerns over US earnings. Copper prices fell slightly (-0.2%), which could be related to doubts from investors regarding China&rsquo;s plans to invigorate their economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil market is mixed with WTI (Unch) little changed and Brent (-0.8%) in the red, as the upcoming Iranian sanctions move back into focus after Saudi Arabia reassured markets that oil supply will meet demand yesterday. Furthermore, the weekly API&#39;s printed a larger-than-expected build of 9.88mln barrels against an expected 3.70mln barrels, which provided further pressure to the complex. Traders will be keeping an eye on the weekly DoE crude inventory numbers released later today with focus on US oil production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (19 Oct) +9.88mln vs. Exp. +3.7mln (Prev. -2.13mln). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disappointing prelim Eurozone PMIs and a less hawkish than some anticipated Riksbank have given Bunds and Gilts a nudge to fresh intraday highs at 160.19 and 122.30 respectively, +40 and +39 ticks vs previous Eurex and Liffe closes, while BTPs have whittled away gains from 51 ticks to single digits, and actually lost a net 20 ticks at one stage (119.93 session low), as the Italian Government continues to stick to a rigid line on the 2019 deficit. Some additional impetus from a UK perspective via the slowdown in BBA mortgage apps, but not a lot as this release is far from top tier. Rather, it&rsquo;s another stock wobble and dip in broad risk sentiment with crude prices falling further that has underpinned safe-haven debt with turnover picking up and US Treasuries now playing catch-up amidst more bull-flattening. Little sign of auction concession, so far, but that could manifest shortly before the German Bobl and US 5 year offering later.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, Vinci (+3.5%) are higher following a 7% beat on their revenue growth, while Deutsche Bank (-3.7%) are in the red after cutting revenue guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - Propping up the G10 pile, but for different reasons as the single currency breached technical support around 1.1430 vs the Usd and tripped stops below 1.1425 in wake of prelim Eurozone PMIs that fell short of expectations, and with the pan manufacturing survey particularly weak given sub-50 new orders. Meanwhile, Cable retreated further from 1.3000+ highs to trigger some chart-related offers around 1.2937 ahead of UK PM May&rsquo;s 1922 showdown and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, which is keeping the Eur/Gbp cross above 0.8800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK - Clawing back lost ground, largely due to the aforementioned Eur weakness, having weakened to circa 10.3900 and not far from heavy supply/resistance at 10.4000 following the latest Riksbank policy meeting, as guidance was maintained for a hike either in December or February next year. This, despite recent Swedish inflation data surprising to the upside and 2 hawkish dissenters calling for a 25 bp rise in the repo. However, the consensus remains for gradual normalisation and an expansionary stance to continue for an extended period even after the 1st tightening for years is delivered. Hence, Eur/Sek back down to 10.3300, or just under, and Eur/Nok following suit (sub-9.5000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The broad Dollar and index are benefiting from the demise of most major rivals, as overall risk sentiment wobbles again after signs of a revival on Tuesday and overnight. The DXY is just off 96.341 highs, and finally breached a key level around 96.150 that has been capping rallies, with bulls now eyeing 96.402.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie continues to bounce off lows circa 1.3100 vs its US counterpart, even though oil prices have declined further, and the Cad&rsquo;s relative resistance appears in large part down to overwhelming expectations that the BoC will deliver a 25 bp rate hike later today. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - The antipodean Dollars have both slipped back from overnight peaks, as the Yuans weaken and the aforementioned Chinese-led global stock market recovery wanes. Aud/Usd is back under 0.7100 and Nzd/Usd pivoting 0.6550, with the Kiwi now looking towards NZ trade data for some independent impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Perversely perhaps, the 2 classic safe-havens are not performing that well, as Usd/Jpy hovers above 112.50 and the Franc trades either side of 0.9950, albeit the latter firmer vs the Eur (cross down through 1.1400).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disappointing prelim Eurozone PMIs and a less hawkish than some anticipated Riksbank have given Bunds and Gilts a nudge to fresh intraday highs at 160.19 and 122.30 respectively, +40 and +39 ticks vs previous Eurex and Liffe closes, while BTPs have whittled away gains from 51 ticks to single digits, and actually lost a net 20 ticks at one stage (119.93 session low), as the Italian Government continues to stick to a rigid line on the 2019 deficit. Some additional impetus from a UK perspective via the slowdown in BBA mortgage apps, but not a lot as this release is far from top tier. Rather, it&rsquo;s another stock wobble and dip in broad risk sentiment with crude prices falling further that has underpinned safe-haven debt with turnover picking up and US Treasuries now playing catch-up amidst more bull-flattening. Little sign of auction concession, so far, but that could manifest shortly before the German Bobl and US 5 year offering later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is moving sideways, off yesterday&#39;s highs as the yellow metal detaches itself from USD action to moves in lockstep with risk sentiment, as markets are focused on the Italian budget, trade tensions and concerns over US earnings. Copper prices fell slightly (-0.2%), which could be related to doubts from investors regarding China&rsquo;s plans to invigorate their economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil market is mixed with WTI (Unch) little changed and Brent (-0.8%)&nbsp;in the red, as the upcoming Iranian sanctions move back into focus after Saudi Arabia reassured markets that oil supply will meet demand yesterday. Furthermore, the weekly API&#39;s printed a larger-than-expected build of 9.88mln barrels against an expected 3.70mln barrels, which provided further pressure to the complex. Traders will be keeping an eye on the weekly DoE crude inventory numbers released later today with focus on US oil production.</p>\r\n",

Some additional impetus from a UK perspective via the slowdown in BBA mortgage apps, but not a lot as this release is far from top tier. Rather, it&rsquo;s another stock wobble and dip in broad risk sentiment with crude prices falling further that has underpinned safe-haven debt with turnover picking up and US Treasuries now playing catch-up amidst more bull-flattening. Little sign of auction concession, so far, but that could manifest shortly before the German Bobl and US 5 year offering later.</p>\r\n",

Cover was slightly softer than recent averages, but the internals were encouraging, with indirect takedown the highest since December 2016 and above recent averages, and directs taking the lowest since August 2009. Some analysts noted that the strength of the auction might have been partly due to weakness in the equities complex. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 8+ ticks at 118-8+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said the 10% tax cut for the middle class will be revenue neutral and that the tax cut will not impact corporation taxes, while Ways and Means Chair Brady said he will begin work in the coming weeks to develop Trump&#39;s 10% middle class tax cut and that the tax cut plan will be advanced if Republicans retain control of the House and Senate in the November midterm elections. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump reportedly stepped up criticism of Fed Chairman Powell raising rates, while he also said it is too early to tell but that he maybe regrets appointing Powell. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bostic (voter, dove) said possible headwinds are not throwing the economy or the Fed off track and that unless data surprises to the downside, the Fed should continue its gradual rate increases a &quot;few&quot; more times. Bostic added he would favour a fourth rate hike this year and that Q3 GDP made him more comfortable for a hike. (Newswires)<br /><br />Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, dove) reiterated the Fed should gradually raise rates towards neutral which he estimates is in the lower half of 2.5%-3.5%, while he added wage pressures are building but does not see runaway inflation and is mindful of the US dollar&#39;s rise as the Fed lifts rates.

ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) opened higher on early bargain hunting following their recent declines and as the aggressive recovery stateside reverberated in the region. However, both indices failed to sustain their gains as commodity-related sectors dragged on Australia with energy the underperforner after a near-5% slip in oil prices, while the Japanese benchmark was temperamental and made several attempts on the 22000 level to the downside. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+1.5%) and Hang Seng (+0.9%) conformed to the volatile tone and swung between gains and losses amid indecisiveness due to on-going trade concerns and further efforts by Chinese authorities including a respectable liquidity injection by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher as prices benefitted from the overnight volatility and with today&rsquo;s BoJ Rinban operation heavily focused on the belly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity are mostly lower on what has been a choppy session and which follows the dramatic rebound on Wall St where all majors finished negative albeit well off worst levels. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch) opened higher on early bargain hunting following the recent declines and as the aggressive recovery in their US counterparts reverberated in the region. However, both indices failed to sustain their gains as commodity-related sectors dragged on Australia with energy underperforming after a near-5% slip in oil prices, while the Japanese benchmark was indecisive and made several attempts on the 22000 level to the downside. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) and Hang Seng (-0.2%) conform to the non-committal tone as China swings from gains and losses amid on-going trade concerns and after another respectable liquidity effort by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are uneventful due to a lack of tier-1 data and catalysts which has kept the DXY stuck around the 96.00 level, with further criticism from President Trump on Fed Chair Powell and rate hikes failing to spur a reaction in the greenback. EUR/USD is contained at the prior day&rsquo;s tight range and GBP/USD remains below the 1.3000 handle, while antipodeans have consolidated amid a stable CNY and relatively flat fix by the PBoC. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses have also provided very little excitement and largely mirrored the indecisive risk tone across the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher amid the cautious risk tone and with today&rsquo;s BoJ Rinban announcement heavily focused on the belly. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
