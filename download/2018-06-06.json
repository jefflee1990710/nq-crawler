NEC Director Kudlow said there will be trade discussions on trade at G7 meeting, as well as a bilateral meeting with Canadian PM Trudeau. He also said that at this stage, there are no trade &lsquo;deals&rsquo; in place with China. On ZTE, Kudlow said that no decision had been reached from both parties. Kudlow added that reports that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin had requested exemptions for Canadian steel were &lsquo;patently false&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>NAFTA:</strong> Mexico&#39;s Economy Minister Guajardo said he sees a greater than 50% chance of a NAFTA agreement this year. Later, US House Speaker Republican Ryan thinks they are &quot;pretty far into the deadline&quot; to renegotiate NAFTA in this session of Congress. Elsewhere, following yesterday&rsquo;s reports that the White House is considering a shift in NAFTA talks towards bilateral negotiations, PM Trudeau rejected the idea (it was also rejected yesterday), stating that trilateral negotiations are better. Separately, Canada foreign minister Freeland said Canada has had no formal or informal notification of additional US tariffs; her comments followed reports in the Washing Post that the US would be discussing new penalties against Canada. Focusing more on the US, Politico reported US president Trump is looking to reorganise the federal government, which will recommend combining safety net programs under Health and Human Services department, whilst also recommending big changes at other agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RBI:</strong> India&rsquo;s Central Bank unexpectedly hiked its rates, with the benchmark rate being lifted by 25bps to 6.25%, in an (surprising) unanimous vote 6-0, which may signal the beginning of a tightening cycle in the incoming months, analysts at Capital Economics said. Developments in inflation have been cited as the main reasons behind the rate decision, given that core inflation has hit a four-year high, pushing domestic demand and inflation expectations higher. Global market uncertainty was also touted as another reason behind the rate hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB</strong>: ECB&#39;s Praet (Dovish) said inflation expectations are increasingly consistent with the central bank&rsquo;s objectives, and post-QE, forward guidance on policy rates will then have to be specified. Praet added that there is growing evidence that the labour market tightness in translating into a firmer pickup in wage growth. ECB&rsquo;s Hansson (Hawk) said the ECB could lift rates before mid-2019 due to &quot;moderately&quot; rising inflation. ECB&#39;s Weidmann (Hawk) claimed that inflation is now expected to gradually return to levels compatible with their target whilst market expectation of end of QE by end of 2018 is plausible. He made clear the end of QE would only be first step in policy normalisation. ECB&#39;s Knot (Hawk) said it is reasonable to end QE soon as inflation outlook is stable and less dependent on stimulus. He further noted the ECB should wind down QE as soon as possible. The only concern he expressed in FX was&nbsp; on how the exchange rate would impact inflation, noting that the effect is starting to fade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE:</strong> BoE&rsquo;s McCafferty (Hawk) said low interest rates are likely to be with us for quite some time. McCafferty sees inflation pressures starting to build up and it is likely to carry on over the next few years, though he is not convinced inflation will fall much further. He called for the need to keep inflation under control and warned about leaving hikes too late. He also noted are there is in no hurry to turn around on QE; he wants rates to go higher so movements can be made in both directions depending upon the situation. On Brexit, he said uncertainty has led to many businesses to take different decisions than would otherwise be the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>There are increasing reports that Brexit hardliners are becoming disillusioned with the leadership of PM May. There was some speculation that Brexit Secretary Davis would step down as the government prepares to announce plans on the Irish border (details will reportedly be released on Thursday), which reportedly did not include an end date on the temporary, smooth Irish border. Reports later suggested Davis will not resign, though he will not present the border details. In later trade, Davis made clear he wants a new economic partnership with the EU after Brexit. There were reports in later trade that PM May has compromised with Tory rebels, and that the rebels could be won over on Customs Union amendments to EU withdrawal Bill next week (to be brought before the Commons next Tuesday).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> French Foreign Affairs Minister noted the Iran&rsquo;s uranium enrichment plans is a &ldquo;dangerous flirtation with [a] red line&rdquo; but this is still in accordance with the nuclear agreement. European minsters and the EU&#39;s top diplomat stated a withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord would further unsettle the region, further conflict would be &ldquo;disastrous.&rdquo; Elsewhere, Russia and the US are to look for meeting opportunities between Russia&#39;s Foreign Minister Lavrov and US Secretary of State Pompeo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA</strong>: US trade deficit narrowed slightly, against expectations it would be relatively unchanged. The breakdown saw exports net of oil and aircrafts up 1.9% m/m and imports down 0.7%. Exports of core goods jumped by 14%. The headline will add a point to GDP growth which could surpass the 4% level, analysts at Pantheon said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.84% at 2772, NDX +0.60% at 7210, DJI +1.37% at 25140.</strong>&nbsp;SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +0.77%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.04%, Energy: +0.41%, Financials: +1.41%, Health Care: +0.85%, Industrials: +0.80%, Materials: +1.63%, Telecoms: +1.44%, Tech: +0.19%, Utilities: -2.15%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*US Equity futures traded sideways overnight and, in the morning, but futures rebound in the middle of the session where the Emini DowJones breached the 25000 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Stock Specifics: Tesla&rsquo;s (TSLA) Musk said it is quite likely the target of building 5000 Models 3 vehicles per week will be achieved by the end of this month, which saw the stock higher than 10%. Elsewhere, Signet Jewellers (SIG) reported a very strong earnings report which saw the stock higher than 20% on Wednesday trade. Focus also lied on Athena Health (ATHN) which announced it is looking at strategic alternatives, and also announced a search for a new CEO. Previous GE (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt is to be executive chairman at the co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A News:</strong> Not much by way of M&amp;A today but Devon Energy (DVN) is to sell its interests in EnLink (ENLK) to a Global Infrastructure Partners&rsquo; affiliate for USD 3.12bln, meanwhile raising its share repurchase programme to USD 4bln. Also, an update from CVS (CVS) &amp; Aetna (AET) where the deal is seen to be closing in the second half of this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (JUL 18) SETTLES DOWN $0.79 AT $64.73/BBL; BRENT (AUG 18) SETTLES DOWN $0.02 &nbsp;AT $75.36/BBL.</strong> Crude prices were soft on Wednesday, though the general range seen in WTI this week between c.$64-c.$65.50 was generally maintained. The DOE reported a surprise build in crude stocks (+2.07mln vs exp -1.82mln); Cushing stocks drew by 0.96mln. Products built, with distillates +2.16mln (exp +0.87mln) and gasoline +4.6mln (exp +0.58mln). Amid the crude slide, it was reported that Saudi OSPs for July were at four-year highs; separately, India&#39;s oil minister said that Saudi oil minister told him the country is revising its policy to cut oil output. Mexico&rsquo;s energy minister said production could return to 2mln BPD by 2022. Also, Iraq Oil Minister Luaibi said production increase is not on the table at the June meeting, adds prices are good and that the market is stable. Elsewhere, Venezuela PDVSA is considering a force majeure on June exports, after reports yesterday it doesn&rsquo;t have the inventory to satisfy some orders. Regarding Iran, it was reported that most European refiners (around 20% of Iran&rsquo;s export market) plan to halt purchases of Iranian crude due to US sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) SETTLED 13+ TICKS LOWER AT 119-08+</strong> . Yields have been moving higher during the session but 10-year yields failed to test the 3% level. The prevailing wisdom is that the level will give way, though yields have been stubborn in doing so just yet ahead of next week&rsquo;s FOMC meeting, where it will update its growth projections. At settlement. Most of the actions was in the belly and long-end of the curve where yields were higher byc.6bps. 2s10s and 2s30s were wider by c.2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FX:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Broad losses vs majors (and EMs on the rebound again) leaves the index languishing around and briefly under 93.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Extending ECB-related gains vs the Greenback and other currency counterparts of hawkish impulses ahead of June&rsquo;s policy meeting next week (Thursday) as a string of speakers effectively endorsed sources suggesting that the next phase of QE unwinding and guidance to that end will be discussed with a view to communicating changes if deemed appropriate. EURUSD almost got to 1.1800, while EURGBP climbed back over 0.8750, EURCHF just above 1.1600 and EURJPY spiked through 129.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, JPY:</strong> Both still relatively rangebound vs the USD, with the Franc pivoting above 0.9850 after a modest Swiss inflation data beat and JPY consolidating above 110.00, but not extending beyond circa 110.25 amidst reports of huge supply from Japanese banks and despite more downbeat local data overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, GBP: </strong>The next best G10s and gainers vs a generally weaker Greenback pre-G7, with the Kiwi hitching a ride with its antipodean peer to an extent as the cross remained below 1.0900 and NZDUSD rebounded to 0.7050 at one point but then&nbsp; fell to sustain gains above that level, while Cable consolidated its recovery above 1.3400 amidst reports that the UK will unveil its Temporary Customs Arrangement (ie Brexit back-stop blueprint with the EU) as early as tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CAD:</strong> AUD ended the Wednesday&rsquo;s US 0.6% higher vs the USD. AUDUSD regained overnight momentum to re-test offers ahead of 0.7700 with a bit more conviction amidst a broad upturn in risk appetite following considerably stronger than expected Aussie growth data, and thus consolidated above 0.7650. As for the Loonie, a smaller than forecast trade shortfall compounded comparatively better news on the NAFTA front following reports that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin tried to get Canada on President Trump&rsquo;s steel and aluminium import tax exemption list pushed USDCAD at recent lows just below 1.2950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> COMING -UP:</strong> Central Bank of Turkey Rate Decision to be published on 7 June at 1200 BST. The consensus view expects the CBT to hold its one-week repo rate at 16.50%, after its recent tweaks to its policy framework, where it has made the benchmark rate its one-week repo rate (previously it was the late liquidity window), hiking the rate by 300bps to 16.50%, and keeping a symmetric overnight corridor around the repo-rate of 150bps for the overnight borrowing and lending rates. Even after an emergency rate hike and a &lsquo;simplification&rsquo; of its policy framework, some analysts continue to expect rates to be lifted further, as the central bank attempts to regain its inflation targeting credibility.</p>\r\n",

Back to the Loonie, a smaller than forecast trade shortfall compounded comparatively better news on the NAFTA front following reports that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin tried to get Canada on President Trump&rsquo;s steel and aluminium import tax exemption list. Usd/Cad revisited recent lows around 1.2850 from peaks some 2 big figures higher on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending ECB-related gains vs the Greenback and other currency counterparts of hawkish impulses ahead of June&rsquo;s policy meeting next week (Thursday) as a string of speakers effectively endorsed sources suggesting that the next phase of QE unwinding and guidance to that end will be discussed with a view to communicating changes if deemed appropriate. Eur/Usd almost got to 1.1800 where big expiry option interest sat for the NY cut (1.8 bn), while Eur/Gbp climbed back over 0.8750, Eur/Chf fell just shy of 1.1600 and Eur/Jpy spiked through 129.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best G10s and gainers vs a generally weaker Greenback pre-G7, with the Kiwi hitching a ride with its antipodean peer to an extent as the cross remained below 1.0900 and Nzd/Usd rebounded to 0.7050, while Cable consolidated its recovery above 1.3400 amidst reports that the UK will unveil its Temporary Customs Arrangement (ie Brexit back-stop blueprint with the EU) as early as tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both still relatively rangebound vs the Usd, with the Franc pivoting 0.9850 after a modest Swiss inflation data beat and Jpy trading either side of 110.00, but not extending beyond circa 110.25 amidst reports of huge supply from Japanese banks and despite more downbeat local data overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broad losses vs majors (and EMs on the rebound again) leaves the index languishing around and briefly under 93.500.</p>\r\n",

Opponents say the measure would make it harder for commercial banks to offer credit; the SNB itself and the banking sector are against the proposals, and a recent poll by SRG suggests that Swiss voters will reject the motion &ndash; most polls show support for the plebiscite is only around 35%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MARKET REACTION: </strong>ING argues that a vote in favour of the motion could see EURCHF at around 1.30, with the prospect of between 2-3 years of uncertainty, and would likely see a restructuring of the credit system, likely hitting growth in the short-term. However, analysts at UBS would expect the CHF to strengthen in wake of a surprise vote in favour of the motion: &ldquo;The initial market reaction would be to buy the franc because it would be seen as a decision for tighter credit and hence tighter monetary policy,&rdquo; UBS says, &ldquo;Plus the SNB is arguing that it would no longer be allowed to intervene in FX markets.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>RATES: </strong>The consensus view expects the CBT to hold its one-week repo rate at 16.50%, after its recent tweaks to its policy framework, where it has made the benchmark rate its one-week repo rate (previously it was the late liquidity window), hiking the rate by 300bps to 16.50%, and keeping a symmetric overnight corridor around the repo-rate of 150bps for the overnight borrowing and lending rates. Even after an emergency rate hike and a &lsquo;simplification&rsquo; of its policy framework, some analysts continue to expect rates to be lifted further, as the central bank attempts to regain its inflation targeting credibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>INFLATION: </strong>The most recent inflation data showed a marked uptick to 12.1% YY in May from 10.8% YY in April, largely driven by May&rsquo;s slide in the TRY, but also higher oil prices (NOTE: the CBT has a 5% inflation target). The gains in inflation were broad-based, with nine of the 12 categories seeing rises, and core inflation jumped 0.4ppts to 12.6% YY, the highest in this series of data, which runs back to 2004. Analysts at Commerzbank argue that the true impact of the Lira weakness, oil prices, higher US rates (US yields have resumed their march upwards this week, following the fall on risk-off flows as the European crisis flared up again) will fully be seen over the course of the next few months. While policymakers have expressed confidence that inflation will peak-out in the coming months (it is worth noting that there is an election on 24/Jun), Commerz suggests that market participants will want more assurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RISKS OF A HIKE: </strong>Capital Economics suggests that the recent appreciation of the TRY following the central bank&rsquo;s emergency rate hike and tweaking of its policy framework suggests that the CBT will stand pat, but concedes that there is marginal risk of a rate rise, particularly so given its recent tough talk and an emphasis on tackling high, unanchored inflation. But Capital Economics also notes that the central bank may avoid tightening policy following Turkish President Erdogan&rsquo;s recent tirade against higher rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MARKET REACTION: </strong>Analysts at ING are not ruling out a &lsquo;measured&rsquo; 50bps hike to the repo rate, which it says would be &lsquo;very supportive&rsquo; for the TRY, and would also be seen as another step by the CBT towards regaining inflation-targeting credibility.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) was positive with gains led by miners after recent upside in metal prices and with BHP also higher due to interest in its US shale assets, while better than expected GDP data also contributed to the upbeat tone. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) eked modest gains amid a weaker currency but with upside capped as wage data added to the recent slew of disappointing releases from Japan, while Shanghai Comp. (flat) and Hang Seng (+0.5%) were mixed as trade uncertainty lingered. Furthermore, the PBoC refrained from reverse repo operations and instead opted to inject via its Medium-term Lending Facility, while there was also speculation PBoC is likely to lift rates on its lending facilities and reverse repos should the Fed hike as expected next week. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued amid weakness in USTs and modest gains in Tokyo stocks, while the BoJ Riban announcement was largely ignored as the central bank kept purchase amounts unchanged in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China may reduce RRR and increase yields on MLF and reverse repos.

In light of this and ahead of the ECB blackout period commencing on Thursday, a slew of members came out with comments:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Praet (Dovish) said inflation expectations are increasingly consistent with their aim, post QE forward guidance on policy rates will then have to be further specified. He further added that markets are expecting an end of QE at end of 2018, this is an observation and input that is up for discussion and that it is clear that next week will need to discuss end of QE programme. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Hansson (Hawk) said the ECB could lift rates before mid-2019 due to &quot;moderately&quot; rising inflation. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Weidmann (Hawk) said that inflation is now expected to gradually return to levels compatible with their target, adding that market expectation of end of QE by end of 2018 is plausible. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Knot (Hawk) said it is reasonable to end QE soon inflation outlook is stable and less dependent on stimulus. He adds that the ECB should wind down QE as soon as possible. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBI Interest Rate Decision 6.25% vs. Exp. 6.00% (Prev. 6.00%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBI Reverse Repo Rate 6.00% vs. Exp. 5.75% (Prev. 5.75%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Polish NBP Base Rate (Jun) 1.50% vs. Exp. 1.50% (Prev. 1.50%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK opposition Labour party are reportedly going to announce a major shift towards a soft Brexit, in which party leader Corbyn will table &quot;internal market&quot; amendment to the withdrawal bill, customs bill and trade bill. (The Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary David Davis is &quot;not backing down&quot; in dislike of elements of the backstop plan, according to sources via Sam Coates of The Times. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are mixed (Euro Stoxx 50 flat) with the energy and material sector outperforming following higher commodity prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FTSE 100 (+0.4%) is the leading bourse being supported by energy and material names</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FTSE MIB (flat) currently underperforming bourse and being weighed on by Italian banks (-1.6%) following Conte setting Italy on a collision course with the EU Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In individual stock news Schindler Holding (+4.1%) is seeing positivity following an upgrade to buy at Goldman Sachs. WH Smith (+6.3%) is also up on the day following positive earnings results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBS (-0.8%) is down on the day following the announcement that the UK government may further divest from the co. in September of this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has extended gains made late yesterday on the back of hawkish ECB sourced reports about a live policy meeting next Thursday, as no less than 3 GC members essentially confirm that the next stage of the exit strategy will be on the agenda. Eur/Usd has tripped stops at 1.1755 to trade just short of 1.1780, but may be hampered by decent option expiry interest between 1.1750-60 (1 bn) and almost double that amount at the 1.1800 strike (1.8 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Off overnight peaks vs its US counterpart, but firmly back above 0.7600 after Tuesday&rsquo;s sharp pull-back (on a gaping Aussie current account deficit and still neutral RBA) as Q1 GDP surpassed expectations and broad risk sentiment improves on latest global trade reports (including China offering to buy around Usd70 bn worth of US goods).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty even and vying for bronze medal position on the G10 podium on nothing really new in terms of UK or NZ specifics, but a broad downturn in the Greenback. Cable has breached 1.3400 and the Kiwi has bounced off circa 0.7000 lows posted yesterday amidst heightened risk aversion on several counts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another relative reprieve for the Loonie after NAFTA and data disappointment amidst reports that US Treasury Sectretary Mnuchin attempted to persuade President Trump to give Canada a steel and aluminium pardon. Usd/Cad has retreated to the low 1.2900 area from around 1.3065 at one stage yesterday ahead of several releases slated for today, like trade, building permits and the Ivey PMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc is holding off recent lows vs the Usd above 0.9900 with some support gleaned from firmer than forecast Swiss CPI, but Usd/Jpy has climbed over 110.00 in wake of yet more disappointing Japanese data that will keep the BoJ in full QQE mode. The pair is testing key technical levels (including a Fib and the 200 DMA) and reported mega Japanese bank offer above the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given all the above, 94.000+ status has been relinquished again and the index is only just keeping its head above 93.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB officials, including the more pragmatic Praet, plus hawkish Hansson, Weidmann and Knot seem to be confirming source suggestions that next Thursday could well be another crucial policy convene in terms of conveying to markets the next phase of policy normalisation. Hence, Bunds have come under renewed pressure after a fleeting rebound to a fresh Eurex peak at 161.32, which could have been BTP-related or on more June-September rolls, and have now extended losses to 93 ticks at 160.38, while Euribor futures are as much as 4.5 ticks in the red. Elsewhere, and in the absence of anything major on the UK front ahead of a 2023 Gilt tap and BoE commentary, the 10 year Liffe benchmark and Short Sterling contracts are largely following suit with the former flitting between 122.25-68 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 122.84 settlement price and the 3 month strip down 4 ticks at worst. Back to supply, German Bobls drew better demand than the 5yr DMO tap (see headline feed for further details), but cored debt futures knee-jerked to fresh intra-day lows amidst hedge unwinds, at 131.27 on Eurex and 122.21 on Liffe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are relatively mixed with Brent (-USD 0.1) and WTI (-USD 0.4) as prices come off recent highs after nursing recent losses with overnight gains post-API, which showed a larger than expected draw in crude stockpiles. Nonetheless, the inventory report pressured RBOB after a significant build in gasoline stockpiles, although this was then gradually pared throughout the session. Overnight Russia&rsquo;s Energy Minister Novak reiterated OPEC+ countries should consider a possible easing of oil output restrictions depending on demand conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold is trading marginally lower albeit still rangebound and currently testing USD 1295/oz to the downside. Meanwhile, Chinese iron ore futures rose to 2-week highs amid an explosion on Tuesday at an iron ore mine in China&rsquo;s north-eastern province of Liaoning. LME base metals are performing well with LME 3-month copper rising as much as 0.8%, its highest since late February, while LME aluminium climbed to its highest since May 10th earlier in the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>API Weekly Crude Stocks (1 Jun) -2.028M vs. Exp. -1.800M (Prev. 1.001M). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>API Weekly Gasoline Stocks (1 June) +3.759mln (Exp. +0.600mln, Prev. -1.682mln)</p>\r\n",

Eur/Usd has tripped stops at 1.1755 to trade just short of 1.1770, but may be hampered by decent option expiry interest between 1.1750-60 (1 bn) and almost double that amount at the 1.1800 strike (1.8 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Off overnight peaks vs its US counterpart, but firmly back above 0.7600 after Tuesday&rsquo;s sharp pull-back (on a gaping Aussie current account deficit and still neutral RBA) as Q1 GDP surpassed expectations and broad risk sentiment improves on latest global trade reports (including China offering to buy around Usd70 bn worth of US goods).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty even and vying for bronze medal position on the G10 podium on nothing really new in terms of UK or NZ specifics, but a broad downturn in the Greenback. Cable has breached 1.3400 and the Kiwi has bounced off circa 0.7000 lows posted yesterday amidst heightened risk aversion on several counts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another relative reprieve for the Loonie after NAFTA and data disappointment amidst reports that US Treasury Sectretary Mnuchin attempted to persuade President Trump to give Canada a steel and aluminium pardon. Usd/Cad has retreated to the mid 1.2900 area from around 1.3065 at one stage yesterday ahead of several releases slated for today, like trade, building permits and the Ivey PMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc is holding off recent lows vs the Usd with some support gleaned from firmer than forecast Swiss CPI, but Usd/Jpy has climbed above 110.00 in wake of yet more disappointing Japanese data that will keep the BoJ in full QQE mode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given all the above, 94.000+ status has been relinquished again and the index is only just keeping its head above 93.500.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "PREVIEW: RBI expected to keep rates unchanged but possibly signal tightening bias at policy announcement due at 1000BST/0400CDT/1700HKT ",
        "content": "<p>The RBI will conclude its latest bi-monthly policy meeting later in which the central bank is forecast to keep policy unchanged with the Repurchase Rate expected to be maintained at 6.00% and the Reverse Repo Rate to be held at 5.75%. However, expectations are not so straightforward as a recent survey of around 60 analysts suggested 40% were calling for a 25bps rate hike at today&rsquo;s meeting and nearly 70% were calling for a hike in August, while it is worth noting that the survey was taken prior to last week&rsquo;s release of stronger than expected Q1 GDP figures and also signalled a dramatic shift to what polls had suggested only 2 months ago of a hike in H2 next year at the soonest. Elsewhere, a separate poll which had a smaller sample size of 15 economists suggested a wider disparity with 11 calling for no change in rates and only 4 were expecting a rate increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, the calls for a hike have been spurred by several factors with inflation being the principal among the reasons after CPI in April increased to 4.6% vs. Exp. 4.4% (Prev. 4.3%), while recent upside in oil which printed it highest since 2014 last month adds to the inflationary pressures, which the central would likely want to nip to stay close to its medium-term inflation target at 4.0%. Furthermore, stronger than expected GDP for Q1 which was its highest in 7-quarters and kept India as the world&rsquo;s fastest growing major economy, essentially provides room for tighter policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some have also suggested the recent trend by domestic commercial banks in raising their Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate and hikes by central banks in other EM economies such as Indonesia and Philippines to support their depreciating currency and contain capital outflows, could spur similar action by the RBI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, most see an abrupt tightening today without prior notice by the central bank to be premature given the uncertainty in the economy including external factors such as increasing protectionist policies. In addition, the central bank may want to bide its time and see how the monsoon season progresses considering its potential impact on the agricultural industry and food prices, while recent INR weakening which has led to suspected intervention by the RBI to stem the depreciation of the currency is also another argument for the central bank to maintain the status quo. This is due to the erratic behaviour of the currency which has previously been unconventionally supported by looser policy due to better economic prospects and expected money inflows, therefore a rate hike could have the opposite effect of pressuring the currency which the RBI would want to avoid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The announcement is due at 1000BST and aside from the actual rate decision, participants will also be eyeing what stance the RBI takes as there are expectations the central bank will change its policy stance from its current neutrality to signal potential interest rate hikes ahead. The voting composition of the MPC will also be in focus as the minutes from the prior meeting in April showed Deputy Governor Acharya suggested he would be joining prior dissenter RBI Executive Director Patra in voting for a hike, and if this materializes it would only theoretically need one more MPC vote to shift over as long as it was RBI Governor Patel who has the deciding call in the event of a 3-3 split vote.</p>\r\n",

On that note, latest comments from Praet do not appear to reject the sourced speculation as he acknowledges recent firmer inflation impulses and tighter labour markets that should push up wages. Back to Bunds, and the range so far has been 160.91-161.14 vs Tuesday&rsquo;s 161.46 close, with Italian and other peripheral bonds also down on the prospect of more QE tapering plus the overriding political premium after initial euphoria at the end of last week.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian government official said NAFTA is a trilateral agreement and that they are to continue negotiating that way, while the official added that it is not the first time the US was said to break NAFTA talks into bilateral negotiations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico confirmed previously announced US tariffs alongside a 350k tonne tariff free quota for import of pork legs and shoulders from non-US suppliers. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZTE (763 HK) signed an agreement in principle with the US that would lift the Commerce Department ban and in which the US is to claim approx. USD 1.7bln against the Co. according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World Bank maintained 2018 global economic growth estimate at 3.1% and stated that risks to global economy are tilted to the downside. World Bank predicted global growth to moderate over the next 2 years and stated that trade protectionism is posing a significant risk, while it also raised China 2018 growth estimate to 6.5% from 6.4%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian equity markets traded somewhat mixed after a similar performance on Wall St, where tech extended on gains and the Nasdaq edged fresh records highs, although the DJIA underperformed amid weakness in energy and financials. ASX 200 (+0.4%) was positive with gains led by miners after recent upside in metal prices and with BHP also higher due to interest in its US shale assets, while better than expected GDP data also contributed to the upbeat tone. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) eked modest gains amid a weaker currency but with upside capped as wage data added to the recent slew of disappointing releases from Japan, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.6%) were mixed as trade uncertainty lingered. Furthermore, the PBoC refrained from reverse repo operations and instead opted to inject via its Medium-term Lending Facility, while there was also speculation PBoC is likely to lift rates on its lending facilities and reverse repos should the Fed hike as expected next week. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued amid weakness in USTs and modest gains in Tokyo stocks, while the BoJ Riban announcement was largely ignored as the central bank kept purchase amounts unchanged in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China may reduce RRR and increase yields on MLF and reverse repos. (Twitter/China Securities Journal)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped Reverse Repo operations but conduced CNY 463bln lending through its Medium-term Lending Facility.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK opposition Labour party are reportedly going to announce a major shift towards a soft Brexit, in which party leader Corbyn will table &quot;internal market&quot; amendment to the withdrawal bill, customs bill and trade bill. (The Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were source reports that stated the ECB sees 14th June meeting as &#39;live&#39; to discuss QE exit. Sources suggested that Draghi could use next week&rsquo;s meeting to signal a potential move in July. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann (Hawk) said Italy&rsquo;s market turmoil shows the currency union is not yet &lsquo;crisis proof&rsquo;, while he added it would be tragic if reforms and fiscal consolidation achieved during the crisis, were reversed. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian PM Conte won his confidence vote in the Senate; as expected. Italy&#39;s League leader Salvini said the government is to overhaul the pension system. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were largely influenced by NAFTA trade concerns with the greenback weaker after reports that President Trump was considering a shift towards bilateral negotiations which Canada and Mexico both opposed. MXN underperformed after Mexico confirmed tariffs in retaliation to the US and CAD continued its rebound with support seen following reports that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was said to have urged President Trump to exempt Canada from steel and aluminium tariffs. Elsewhere, EUR/USD remained firm and back at the 1.1700 handle after source reports suggested next week&rsquo;s meeting is live in regards to discussing a QE exit, while AUD outperformed after GDP figures topped estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian GDP (Q1) Q/Q 1.0% vs. Exp. 0.9% (Prev. 0.4%, Rev. 0.5%). (Newswires)<br />Australian GDP (Q1) Y/Y 3.1% vs. Exp. 2.8% (Prev. 2.4%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly uneventful overnight in which WTI crude futures continued to nurse its recent losses, while the marginal overnight gains also followed the release of the latest API crude inventory report which showed a relatively inline drawdown to what analyst had forecast. Nonetheless, the inventory report pressured RBOB after a significant build in gasoline stockpiles, although this was then gradually pared throughout the session. Elsewhere, gold and copper traded sideways as the metals complex mostly took a breather from the prior day&rsquo;s gains, although Dalian iron ore futures rallied at the open which some attributed to reports of a deadly iron ore mine explosion in China&rsquo;s Liaoning province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>API Weekly Crude Stocks (1 Jun) -2.028M vs. Exp. -1.800M (Prev. 1.001M). (Newswires)<br />API Weekly Gasoline Stocks (1 June) +3.759mln (Exp. +0.600mln, Prev. -1.682mln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia&rsquo;s Energy Minister Novak reiterated OPEC+ countries should consider a possible easing of oil output restrictions depending on demand conditions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />G7 leaders to call on North Korea to undergo a complete verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation, according to a senior EU official. Furthermore, G7 is said to establish a rapid response mechanism to reinforce cooperation on defending democracies from foreign threats and is likely to uphold sanctions against Russia over Crimea and Ukraine. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields fell on Tuesday, with investors citing concerns regarding the rhetoric of Italian PM Conte, who delivered an address to lawmakers ahead of his confidence motions, which was said to contribute to Eurozone peripheral yields widening versus the Bund. The solid ISM data helped yields rise slightly, though a collection of negative news flow on trade and NAFTA kept the bid in Treasuries. Yields were down between 1-3bps across the curve, with most of the action in the belly (2s -1.6bps, 5s -2.6bps, 10s -3bps, 30s -1bp), though the curve was left modestly steeper at settlement (2s30s +1.5bps, 5s30s +2.5bps). Some of the steepening was attributed to block trades in FVU7 and WNU8, according to Informa. US 10YR T-Notes futures (Sep 2018) settled 6+ ticks higher at 119-22+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senate Majority Leader McConnell cancelled 3 weeks of the month-long August recess &quot;due to the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats of the president&rsquo;s nominees, and the goal of passing appropriations bills prior to the end of the fiscal year&quot;. McConnell said senators will spend the time working to approve nominees and spending bills but are still expected to have the first week of August off. (Politico)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican and Democratic senators are to introduce a bill to force Trump to obtain congressional approval for tariffs on national security grounds, according to Republican Senate Foreign Relations Chair Corker.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade somewhat mixed after a similar performance on Wall St, where tech extended on gains and the Nasdaq edged fresh records highs, although the DJIA underperformed amid weakness in energy and financials. ASX 200 (+0.4%) is positive with gains led by miners after recent upside in metal prices and with BHP also higher due to interest in its US shale assets, while better than expected GDP data also contributes to the upbeat tone. Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) has eked only modest gains despite a weaker currency, with upside capped as wage data adds to recent slew of disappointing releases from Japan. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (+0.5%) are slightly mixed as trade uncertainty continues with the latest reports stating that China offered to import an additional USD 70bln in US goods and that ZTE reached an agreement in principle that would lift the Commerce Department ban which involves around USD 1.7bln payment by the Co. Furthermore, the PBoC refrained from reverse repo operations and instead opted to inject via its Medium-term Lending Facility, while there was also speculation PBoC is likely to lift rates on its lending facilities and reverse repos should the Fed hike as expected next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were largely influenced by NAFTA trade concerns with the greenback weaker after reports that President Trump was considering a shift towards bilateral negotiations which Canada and Mexico both opposed, while MXN underperformed after Mexico confirmed previously announced tariffs and a 350k tonne tariff-free quota for import of pork legs and shoulders from non-US suppliers in retaliation to the US. Elsewhere, CAD continues its rebound with support seen following reports that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is said to have urged President Trump to exempt Canada from steel and aluminium tariffs, while AUD is the outperformer after GDP figures topped estimates in which Y/Y growth surged to 3.1% vs. Exp. 2.8% (Prev. 2.4%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful with prices subdued amid weakness in USTs and modest gains in Tokyo stocks, while the BoJ Riban announcement was largely ignored with the central bank keeping purchase amounts unchanged in 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n",
