OPEC nonetheless announced the recent plunge in prices does not entail an extraordinary meeting whilst the WSJ announced Saudis and OPEC are reportedly considering a clandestine cut to oil output with some upticks seen in the complex heading to the close. UBS said that this month&rsquo;s news of Iran sanctions waivers, along with pledges from OPEC to maintain adequate supply levels have seen the removal of Iran risk from the oil price. Others said the selling was a continuation of the weakness seen this week, where crude is on track for a seventh straight week of declines, with the bears firmly in control. WTI was initially able to hold ground above its 200-week moving average around 52.19, while the 60.51 mark for Brent (61.8% retracement level from Jul&rsquo;17 to Oct&rsquo;18) was the support region, however, after those levels were breached, WTI dropped to 50.60 and Brent to sub-60 at 58.92, before stabilising after US cash open, when ES futures bounced, with Brent consolidating beneath USD 59.00, and WTI above USD 51.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>French concerns over post-Brexit fishing practices and Spain&rsquo;s objection to treatment of Gibraltar remain potential sticking points in negotiations. On Friday, EU sherpas said to fail to reach deal over Gibraltar while the EU said to continue work on Gibraltar deal ahead of the Summit. Spain has threatened to use the matter of Gibraltar as a basis to veto any draft deal on Britain&rsquo;s exit from the EU in the future (requires unanimous backing) and insisted that guarantees about Gibraltar&#39;s future should be part of the Brexit treaty, rejecting the solution of a political declaration on Friday. However, it is worth drawing the distinction that the approval of the Withdrawal Agreement only requires the backing of a supermajority (20/27 members) and as such, Spain themselves cannot halt the Withdrawal Agreement unless supported with the backing of some of its European counterparts. Nonetheless, many commentators have suggested that the EU27 deem it highly significant that the EU27 show a united front on the Withdrawal Agreement and as such the process to agree a text ahead of Sunday could be a complex one for PM May. Furthermore, the Withdrawal Agreement is likely to remain an issue of contention back home and thus the risk of further departures from May&rsquo;s cabinet and Parliamentary backlash remains live. This brings us around to this Sunday&rsquo;s EU Leaders summit, ahead of which, UK PM May will head to Brussels on Saturday to iron out any differences with EU&rsquo;s Juncker to ensure the Withdrawal Agreement text is accepted by her European counterparts; if the text is not prepared, German Chancellor Merkel has threatened to not attend the summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>There was optimism that the populist government could reign in some of their budgetary demands with reports suggesting that the EU Affairs Minister Savona could step down from his position (later denied) due to dissent over Italy&rsquo;s intentions to violate EU budget laws. This also came amidst a backdrop of increasing pressure from President Mattarella who wants the technocratic PM Conte to get a deal done with the European Commission, whilst other Italian press report highlight the need for Italy to increase the sincerity of Italy&rsquo;s concessions to Europe. Once again, Italian Deputy PM Di Maio said the pillars of 2019 budget will not be changed while Italy will show the highest willingness to negotiate with the EU; he also reiterated that the Italian government does not want to leave Europe and the Euro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANDIAN CPI &amp; RETAIL SALES: </strong>CPI rose 0.3% in October, more than the expected 0.1%, pushing the yy headline to 2.4% also above the 2.2% consensus. Gasoline prices, mortgage costs and airfare rates all contributed significantly to price pressure while telephone services and natural gas weighed prices down. The Core measures also surprised to the upside rising 0.3% last month. Scotiabank notes that &ldquo;inflation is roughly on the mark if not ever so slightly firmer than the BoC forecast for Q3 and Q4 combined&rdquo;. Elsewhere, retail sales posted at 0.2% also above the 0.1% expected with motor vehicles sale contributing 0.14% to the headline. On an annualised basis, sales rose 1.5% in Q3 &ldquo;consistent with a moderation in household consumption in Q3&rdquo;, TD Securities note. Overall, today&rsquo;s data leaves the BoC near-term outlook unchanged while &ldquo;the recent pullback in oil prices has effectively eliminated the risk of a December rate hike&rdquo; TD Securities adds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;* SPX -0.65% at 2632, NDX -0.73% at 6527, DJI -0.73% at 24286. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -3.25%, Materials -1.10%, Industrials -0.21%, Cons Discretionary -0.44%, Cons Staples +0.34%, Healthcare +0.12%, Financials -0.91%, Tech -0.87%, Telecoms -1.20%, Utilities +0.12%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Rockwell Collins (COL) was a top mover today after Chinese regulators gave the go ahead for United Technologies (UTX) to acquire it, United rose on the news too. Airlines traded higher today following the sharp sell-off in crude prices including stocks such as Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL). On the other side of the crude sell-off the energy sector got slammed across the board, Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), EOG Resources (EOG) and Conoco Phillips (COP) were all weighing down the group. Facebook (FB) was also a bottom mover as its political scandals remain present in news flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* T-NOTES (Z8) SETTLE 1+ TICK HIGHER AT 119-09.</strong>&nbsp;Treasuries were mixed, with the T-Note drifting slightly higher in thin-liquidity conditions. The upward momentum was inspired by pre-market risk off, as equity futures and, crucially, crude futures, were on the back foot. Moves were small, however, and as we leave for the weekend, the Z18 contract is knocking in the middle of the day&#39;s range (11904 to 119-15).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP: * DXY:</strong> The Greenback and index look all set to end a holiday-shortened week back in demand, albeit largely to the detriment or courtesy of underperformance in counterpart currencies as the Dollar&rsquo;s independent bullish momentum has waned amidst less upbeat US economic developments, Fed policy perceptions and softer Treasury yields. However, the DXY just posted a fresh peak of the week a fraction off 97.00 at 96.919 having been down to 96.037 at one stage and around 96.433 at the onset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>A particularly volatile final 2 sessions of the week for Sterling, and yet again mainly on Brexit-related impulses, as Cable hit a high of circa 1.2925 on Thursday as news broke and details emerged on the political declaration for future ties between the UK and EU reached by the Brexit negotiators in advance of Sunday&rsquo;s summit. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp recoiled from 0.8930 to a low almost 100 pips below, with the single currency still feeling the weight of Italian-EU budget wrangling. However, Sterling pulled back pretty sharply as reaction to draft agreement beyond markets was far from rapturous, with Cable now hovering just above 1.2800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency suffered a pronounced fall from 1.1472 vs the Usd at best to sub-1.1340 lows after Brussels officially ruled that Italy&rsquo;s 2019 budget contravenes EU fiscal rules and warrants sanctions via the EDP, as Government officials in Rome stood firm on the main points of the plan and offered little in terms of concessions. However, the final straws were bleak Eurozone preliminary PMIs that fuelled speculation about the ECB downgrading its outlook for growth to downside from balanced and next month&rsquo;s policy meeting after minutes from the October gathering underlined some members already leaning towards a more downbeat assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, CAD, AUD: </strong>All ending the week on the backfoot after choppy 2-way trade earlier, and broadly on a downturn in overall risk sentiment alongside plunging crude and other commodity prices. The Kiwi extended losses below 0.6800 and Loonie through 1.3250 at one stage even though Canadian data was better than expected in the form of CPI and retail sales. Similarly, the Aud is hovering precariously above 0.7200 and also undermined by ANZ rolling back its first RBA tightening projection to August 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Bucking the general Black Friday trend and marginally outperforming vs the Usd on its greater allure during bouts of risk aversion, albeit in a comparatively narrow range just under 113.00 and not that much wider trading parameters for the week to date (112.30-113.15 vs 112.80 at &lsquo;open&rsquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF:</strong> Also confined to a pretty narrow band vs the Greenback between 1.0005-0.9905 and only intermittently displaying stronger safe-haven properties than the Usd, but the Franc firmly outpaced the Eur on the aforementioned Italy vs EU budget spat &ndash; cross currently circa 1.1310 vs just over 1.1400 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>The Try traded against the grain to maintain its bullish momentum vs the Usd, and now above 5.3000 looking technically ripe for more upside. Conversely, the deterioration in risk sentiment hit most other regional currencies hard, and for the Zar wiped out a chunk of its post-SARB rate hike gains, although the Rand still held comfortably over the 14.0000 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong> Sunday: EU leader summit Monday: New Zealand Retail Sales, Israel Interest Rate Decision Tuesday: CaseShiller, US Consumer Confidence Wednesday: US GDP (2nd Estimate), US Rich Fed, Japanese Retail Sales, Fed&rsquo;s Powell to Speak at NY Economic Club Thursday: FOMC Minutes.

        "subject": " Weekly FX Wrap: super Thanksgiving Thursday for Sterling, but Black Friday for Euro",
        "content": "<p>DXY: The Greenback and index look all set to end a holiday-shortened week back in demand, albeit largely to the detriment or courtesy of underperformance in counterpart currencies as the Dollar&rsquo;s independent bullish momentum has waned amidst less upbeat US economic developments, Fed policy perceptions and softer Treasury yields. However, the DXY just posted a fresh peak of the week a fraction off 97.00 at 96.919 having been down to 96.037 at one stage and around 96.433 at the onset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP: A particularly volatile final 2 sessions of the week for Sterling, and yet again mainly on Brexit-related impulses, as Cable hit a high of circa 1.2925 on Thursday as news broke and details emerged on the political declaration for future ties between the UK and EU reached by the Brexit negotiators in advance of Sunday&rsquo;s summit. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp recoiled from 0.8930 to a low almost 100 pips below, with the single currency still feeling the weight of Italian-EU budget wrangling. However, Sterling pulled back pretty sharply as reaction to draft agreement beyond markets was far from rapturous, with Cable now hovering just above 1.2800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR: The single currency suffered a pronounced fall from 1.1472 vs the Usd at best to sub-1.1340 lows after Brussels officially ruled that Italy&rsquo;s 2019 budget contravenes EU fiscal rules and warrants sanctions via the EDP, as Government officials in Rome stood firm on the main points of the plan and offered little in terms of concessions. However, the final straws were bleak Eurozone preliminary PMIs that fuelled speculation about the ECB downgrading its outlook for growth to downside from balanced and next month&rsquo;s policy meeting after minutes from the October gathering underlined some members already leaning towards a more downbeat assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD, CAD, AUD: All ending the week on the backfoot after choppy 2-way trade earlier, and broadly on a downturn in overall risk sentiment alongside plunging crude and other commodity prices. The Kiwi extended losses below 0.6800 and Loonie through 1.3250 at one stage even though Canadian data was better than expected in the form of CPI and retail sales. Similarly, the Aud is hovering precariously above 0.7200 and also undermined by ANZ rolling back its first RBA tightening projection to August 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY: Bucking the general Black Friday trend and marginally outperforming vs the Usd on its greater allure during bouts of risk aversion, albeit in a comparatively narrow range just under 113.00 and not that much wider trading parameters for the week to date (112.30-113.15 vs 112.80 at &lsquo;open&rsquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF: Also confined to a pretty narrow band vs the Greenback between 1.0005-0.9905 and only intermittently displaying stronger safe-haven properties than the Usd, but the Franc firmly outpaced the Eur on the aforementioned Italy vs EU budget spat &ndash; cross currently circa 1.1310 vs just over 1.1400 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM: The Try traded against the grain to maintain its bullish momentum vs the Usd, and now above 5.3000 looking technically ripe for more upside. Conversely, the deterioration in risk sentiment hit most other regional currencies hard, and for the Zar wiped out a chunk of its post-SARB rate hike gains, although the Rand still held comfortably over the 14.0000 level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After opening with little in the way of firm direction amid holiday thinned markets (US, Japan and India), European equities have posted modest gains with the EuroStoxx 50 higher by 0.2%. Leading the charge in Europe is the FTSE MIB (+0.6%) with Italian assets underpinned by optimism that the populist government could reign in some of their budgetary demands with reports suggesting that the EU Affairs Minister Savona could step down from his position (later denied) due to dissent over Italy&rsquo;s intentions to violate EU budget laws. This also comes amidst a backdrop of increasing pressure from President Mattarella who wants the technocratic PM Conte to get a deal done with the EC, whilst other Italian press report highlight the need for Italy to increase the sincerity of Italy&rsquo;s concessions to Europe. In terms of sector specifics, upside in Italian banking names has helped spur gains in European financials with the telecoms sector outperforming. To the downside, energy names lag, in-fitting with price action in the complex with crude seemingly unable to stem recent losses. Individual movers include Renault (+4.2%), who have been granted some reprieve from recent losses following a broker upgrade at Jefferies and as Nissan continue to reorganise their corporate leadership. Elsewhere, GEA Group (-14.3%) are lower after cutting guidance whilst Altice (-9.8%) continue to face selling pressure following yesterday&rsquo;s disappointing market update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - Not the most discounted major currency on offer, but cut price in wake of considerably weaker than forecast preliminary PMIs from France, Germany and the Eurozone overall. The single currency is now under 1.1400 vs the Usd and has broken the 10DMA to the downside at 1.1356, with fibs now being eyed ahead of 1.1300, while pivoting 0.8850 against the Gbp even though Sterling is also suffering in sympathy and jittery on Brexit issues following initial euphoria due to the UK-EU Political Declaration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD/AUD - Also going relatively cheap and underperforming against their US peer, with the Loonie back below 1.3200 amidst an even steeper slide in crude prices ahead of Canadian CPI and retail sales data. Meanwhile, the Aud has retreated through 0.7250 again and hardly helped by overnight developments as ANZ revised its RBA outlook to unchanged until August 2020, and the ASIC launched a probe of CBA for the alleged mis-selling of insurance products. Similarly, the Kiwi has lost grip of 0.6800 amidst speculation that the RBNZ could loosen mortgage restrictions as part of its FSR due next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - As noted above, the Pound has lost a bit more positivity after Thursday&rsquo;s rally on the draft PD reached by Brexit negotiators given a mixed reaction to the details in UK political circles and ongoing doubt about approval by EU leaders. Cable is back below 1.2850 vs circa 1.2900 at best yesterday, albeit &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; above the recent 1.2785 low with decent bids noted at 1.2800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Marginal divergence, as the Jpy keeps its head just above 113.00 vs the Greenback, but trade extremely rangebound given Japan&rsquo;s market closure just a day after US Thanksgiving and with many US participants widely anticipated to be out again today. Conversely, the Franc has dipped from best levels within a narrow 0.9970-35 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The Dollar has benefited from the aforementioned relative weakness elsewhere, and the index is holding nearer the upper end of 96.394-751 parameters as a result, and on course to end the holiday-shortened week with a net gain, albeit modest having traded up to 96.898 and down to 96.037 at the other extreme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Some consolidation at the end of a solid week for the likes of the Zar and Try that have both made potentially significant breaks of key levels at 14.0000 and 5.3000 vs the Usd respectively due to a combination of bullish technical and fundamental factors, ie the SARB &frac14; point hike yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-4.3%) and Brent (-2.6%) are on track for their seventh weekly loss with WTI prices briefly breaching the USD 52.00/bbl level to the downside while Brent lingers just above USD 61/bbl. Some traders are citing the recent decline to technical factors, while Saudi Arabia signalled that its output may have reached a record high of above 10.7mln BPD, and the kingdom&rsquo;s Energy Minister Al-Falih noted that demand for oil will be lower in January 2019 compared to December 2018. This comes amidst the backdrop of this week&rsquo;s EIA data which showed that US production remained at a record high of 11.7mln barrels, the most since at least 1983; according to government data. Therefore, the complex is suffering from a double whammy with supply glut concerns and weaker demand concerns weighing on traders&rsquo; minds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil fell into bear market territory this month after the US granted temporary waivers to eight countries in regard to Iranian oil, in turn pouring cold water on some supply concerns, while sources emerged this morning noting that China are to resume the purchase of Iranian oil in November after their waiver. Some analysts highlighted that due to complications over insurance, shipping and payments, it may take until February or later until some of Iran&rsquo;s largest buyers such as South Korean and Japan resume purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a reminder, due to the US Thanksgiving Holiday, WTI had no settlement price yesterday, while Brent Jan&rsquo;19 contract closed on Thursday at the lowest premium to WTI since August 31st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (-0.4%) prices saw some downside after the yellow metal felt pressure from the firmer USD and copper weakened amid underperformance in China alongside a decline in Chinese commodity prices. Furthermore, China&rsquo;s Dalian Exchange are to relax their risk management restrictions on some futures in an attempt to attract more investors to boost liquidity given the recent slump in iron ore prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU bonds have extended session highs in wake of the downbeat flash Eurozone PMIs that will be an added concern for those at the ECB already worried about the extent of the economic slowdown. Bunds have inched closer towards the top of a resistance band ahead of 161.00, at 160.97 (+34 ticks) and Gilts recently topped out just above their nearest big figure at 123.02 (+32 ticks), with the former not really or unduly hampered by ongoing strength in Italian BTPs at present (10 year future now off best levels but still 50+ ticks ahead and not far from 123.00 at one stage). However, US Treasuries are rather reluctant to tag along, albeit off overnight session lows ahead of Markit&rsquo;s preliminary PMI as not many trading desks are expected to be back up to full quota and action, if any, after Thanksgiving, not to mention early market closes that will likely keep turnover depressed.</p>\r\n",

Leading the charge in Europe is the FTSE MIB (+0.5%) with Italian assets underpinned by optimism that the populist government could reign in some of their budgetary demands with reports suggesting that the EU Affairs Minister Savona could step down from his position (later denied) due to dissent over Italy&rsquo;s intentions to violate EU budget laws. This also comes amidst a backdrop of increasing pressure from President Mattarella who wants the technocratic PM Conte to get a deal done with the EC, whilst other Italian press report highlight the need for Italy to increase the sincerity of Italy&rsquo;s concessions to Europe. In terms of sector specifics, upside in Italian banking names has helped spur gains in European financials, with the sector outperforming. To the downside, energy names lag, in-fitting with price action in the complex with crude seemingly unable to stem recent losses. Individual movers include Renault (+4.2%), who have been granted some reprieve from recent losses following a broker upgrade at Jefferies and as Nissan continue to reorganise their corporate leadership. Elsewhere, GEA Group (-14.3%) are lower after cutting guidance whilst Altice (-9.8%) continue to face selling pressure following yesterday&rsquo;s disappointing market update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - Not the most discounted major currency on offer, but cut price in wake of considerably weaker than forecast preliminary PMIs from France, Germany and the Eurozone overall. The single currency is now under 1.1400 vs the Usd and testing the 10DMA on the downside at 1.1356, while pivoting 0.8850 against the Gbp even though Sterling is also suffering in sympathy and jittery on Brexit issues following initial euphoria due to the UK-EU Political Declaration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NZD/AUD - Also going relatively cheap and underperforming against their US peer, with the Loonie back below 1.3200 amidst an even steeper slide in crude prices ahead of Canadian CPI and retail sales data. Meanwhile, the Aud has retreated through 0.7250 again and hardly helped by overnight developments as ANZ revised its RBA outlook to unchanged until August 2020, and the ASIC launched a probe of CBA for the alleged mis-selling of insurance products. Similarly, the Kiwi has lost grip of 0.6800 amidst speculation that the RBNZ could loosen mortgage restrictions as part of its FSR due next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - As noted above, the Pound has lost a bit more positivity after Thursday&rsquo;s rally on the draft PD reached by Brexit negotiators given a mixed reaction to the details in UK political circles and ongoing doubt about approval by EU leaders. Cable is back near 1.2850 vs circa 1.2900 at best yesterday, albeit &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; above the recent 1.2785 low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Marginal divergence, as the Jpy keeps its head just above 113.00 vs the Greenback, but trade extremely rangebound given Japan&rsquo;s market closure just a day after US Thanksgiving and with many US participants widely anticipated to be out again today. Conversely, the Franc has dipped from best levels within a narrow 0.9970-35 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The Dollar has benefited from the aforementioned relative weakness elsewhere, and the index is holding nearer the upper end of 96.394-751 parameters as a result, and on course to end the holiday-shortened week with a net gain, albeit modest having traded up to 96.898 and down to 96.037 at the other extreme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Some consolidation at the end of a solid week for the likes of the Zar and Try that have both made potentially significant breaks of key levels at 14.0000 and 5.3000 vs the Usd respectively due to a combination of bullish technical and fundamental factors, ie the SARB &frac14; point hike yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU bonds have extended session highs in wake of the downbeat flash Eurozone PMIs that will be an added concern for those at the ECB already worried about the extent of the economic slowdown. Bunds have inched closer towards the top of a resistance band ahead of 161.00, at 160.93 (+30 ticks) and Gilts recently topped out just ahead of their nearest big figure at 122.95 (+1/4 point exactly), with the former not really or unduly hampered by ongoing strength in Italian BTPs at present (10 year future now off best levels but still 50+ ticks ahead and not far from 123.00 at one stage). However, US Treasuries are rather reluctant to tag along, albeit off overnight session lows ahead of Markit&rsquo;s preliminary PMI as not many trading desks are expected to be back up to full quota and action, if any, after Thanksgiving, not to mention early market closes that will likely keep turnover depressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-5.1%) and Brent (-3.3%) are on track for their seventh weekly loss with WTI prices briefly breaching the USD 52.00/bbl level to the downside while Brent lingers just above USD 60.50/bbl. Some traders are citing the recent decline to technical factors, while Saudi Arabia signalled that its output may have reached a record high of above 10.7mln BPD, and the kingdom&rsquo;s Energy Minister Al-Falih noted that demand for oil will be lower in January 2019 compared to December 2018. This comes amidst the backdrop of this week&rsquo;s EIA data which showed that US production remained at a record high of 11.7mln barrels, the most since at least 1983; according to government data. Therefore, the complex is suffering from a double whammy with supply glut concerns and weaker demand concerns weighing on traders&rsquo; minds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil fell into bear market territory this month after the US granted temporary waivers to eight countries in regard to Iranian oil, in turn pouring cold water on some supply concerns, while sources emerged this morning noting that China are to resume the purchase of Iranian oil in November after their waiver. Some analysts highlighted that due to complications over insurance, shipping and payments, it may take until February or later until some of Iran&rsquo;s largest buyers such as South Korean and Japan resume purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a reminder, due to the US Thanksgiving Holiday, WTI had no settlement price yesterday, while Brent Jan&rsquo;19 contract closed on Thursday at the lowest premium to WTI since August 31st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (-0.4%) prices saw some downside after the yellow metal felt pressure from the firmer USD and copper weakened amid underperformance in China alongside a decline in Chinese commodity prices. Furthermore, China&rsquo;s Dalian Exchange are to relax their risk management restrictions on some futures in an attempt to attract more investors to boost liquidity given the recent slump in iron ore prices.</p>\r\n",

Back to Eurex, the core Eurozone bond has now breached near term resistance and eyeing the 160.87-92 area next vs a 160.80 peak so far (+17 ticks vs -12 ticks at one stage).</p>\r\n",

However, upcoming preliminary Eurozone PMIs have the potential to prompt more activity, especially if weaker than expected after ECB minutes highlighting some divergence over growth risks from the official balanced outlook vs a downgrade and potential shift to the latter in December. Back to Italy, and despite ongoing intransigence over the major outline of the 2019 from key Government officials, not all in Rome appear intent on pursuing fiscal policies that will force the EU to implement excess deficit measures, so markets are anticipating some form of compromise before push really comes to shove.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, USD/JPY was lacklustre amid the absence of Tokyo participants and commodity-linked currencies were also uneventful and paid no heed to the pressure across the energy complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly lower amid the broad risk-averse tone with the energy complex pressured as WTI crude futures slipped 2.5% and Brent crude fell to its lowest since December 2017. The weakness overnight was attributed to ongoing oversupply concerns and stops for a major order being triggered, while other sources also noted technical and algo selling. Elsewhere, gold was marginally underpinned by a softer greenback and copper weakened amid underperformance in China, as well as decline in Chinese commodity prices with Dalian iron ore futures down around 3% on worries of weak demand from steel mills.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea appear to be expanding operations at its main nuclear site, according to the IAEA, while there were also reports that atomic agency inspectors are said to be demanding North Korea allow nuclear inspectors back into the country amid reactor activity concerns.

Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp.

In addition, the US called for its allies to stop using Huawei equipment and weak earnings results from Meituan Dianping in which the online service provider&rsquo;s losses ballooned, further added to the glum.</p>\r\n",

Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.4%) is positive with the index supported by strength in its top-weighted financials sector amid gains in Australia&rsquo;s largest banks after Macquarie pulled-off a rarity at the banking royal commission in which it emerged unscathed and with its reputation enhanced. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-1.4%) and Hang Seng (-0.7%) are negative amid ongoing trade uncertainty as China responded to the recent trade report by the US, in which it dismissed the accusations of unfair trade practices as groundless and totally unacceptable. In addition, US called for its allies to stop using Huawei equipment and weak earnings results from Meituan Dianping in which the online service provider&rsquo;s losses ballooned, further added to the glum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the major pairs trade sideways with price volatility virtually non-existent due to the holiday closures and lack of data releases. The DXY is subdued around the 96.50 level as EUR/USD sits above 1.1400, while GBP/USD holds on to most the prior day&rsquo;s gains from the news that UK and EU negotiators agreed on the text of their political declaration regarding future ties. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies mirror the humdrum tone seen in oil prices and USD/JPY is also uneventful amid the absence of market participants in Tokyo.</p>\r\n",
