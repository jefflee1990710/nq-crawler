GBP Not quite zero to hero, but a sterling effort by the Pound given triple dose of disappointing data this week. Cable initially extended its reversal from new post-Brexit vote high (around 1.4375) to circa 1.4160 on a bad retail sales miss, but is back above 1.4200 and looking to close over the 200 HMA at 1.4225 to resume its April rally. However, after the gilt market close, comments from BoE&rsquo;s Governor Carney put a downward bias into sterling, with some interpreting his comments as a suggestion that the May hike was not a dead-cert. NZDAUD The Kiwi is losing grip of the 0.7300 handle vs the Usd after Q1 CPI slowed markedly in y/y terms to 1.1% and further below the RBNZ&rsquo;s 2% target, while its antipodean peer is holding up better, but recoiling from another advance above 0.7800 in wake of downbeat Aussie employment data, both in headline and full time placement terms. JPY/EUR/CAD All locked in tight confines, with USDJPY absorbing some exporter offers around 107.50, but not all and finding plenty of support ahead of 107.00, while EURUSD pivoted 1.2375 between a 1.2400-1.2350 band and USDCAD saw similar price action either side of 1.2600 even though Canada&rsquo;s ADP was strong and there was more good news on NAFTA negotiations (telecoms chapter reportedly settled to take the tally to 11). USDCHF popped above 0.9700, and arguably around the time that EURCHF touched 1.2000 (depending on what price feed or platform is referenced), before relative sharp retracements in both pairs. Note, however, one of the prominent Swiss banks is looking for further Franc depreciation. USDRUB, USDTRY and USDMXN saw more lively price action, with the Rouble underpinned within 60.5000-61.2000 trading parameters amidst the ongoing crude oil rally and the Lira extending its recovery to almost 4.0000 before losing some impetus, but the Peso handing back more gains from sub-18.0000 levels on a wave of Mexican political jitters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to an OPEC delegate there was no talk from the Saudis to target USD 100/bbl and that USD 100 target is a danger to the market, while there were also comments from the Oman Oil Minister that USD 65-75/bbl is a realistic oil price range. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC sources noted Iraq is still cheating on set quota. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Deputy AG Rosenstein reportedly told President Trump he is not target of investigation of Michael Cohen. In related news, President Trump was said to tell associates he will not remove Special Counsel Mueller, while there were also separate reports that House Republicans are said to lay the groundwork for Trump to fire Rosenstein. (Newswires/NY Mag)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Brainard (Voter, Dovish) said inflation is well anchored bet there are some signs of imbalances. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Equity futures trended lower through Thursday trade printing lows beneath 2685, however in late trade reports suggested US Deputy AG Rosenstein told US President Trump that he is not going to be a target of a probe. Further, Trump said he will not remove special counsel Mueller which gave a lift to Emini futures testing the 2700 level. Pre-market trade on Thursday saw a heavy dose of M&amp;A news; focus was on Shire (SHPG) / (SHP LN) as Takeda (4502 JT) made a new offer of &pound;46.50/shr but it was rejected by the pharmaceutical company; further source reports suggested it was to have two others bidding for the company, in which Allergan (AGN) came out noting they were in early acquisition talks, but the final source reports told CNBC that AGN would not be making a bid, which was then later on confirmed, but Allergan did note they&rsquo;re continuing to evaluate strategic options. Further, Comcast (CMCSA) sent a bid for Fox&rsquo;s Assets, higher than Disney&rsquo;s (DIS) offer, however CNCB notes the conditions were not favourable and were said to raise regulatory concerns. Elsewhere, reports In NY Post stated that the US DoJ is said to be close to clearing the $6.6bln Sinclair (SBGI) &amp; Tribune Media (TRCO) merger. Semiconductor names were in focus today following poor outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) which expects Q2 revenue to be between $7.8bln and $7.9bln, roughly $1bln lower than wall street estimates. This had a knock-on effect to other chipmakers with the SOX spending the session in the red and chip names all at the bottom of the NDX. Also, reports just before the close yesterday that Facebook (FB) is said to create a team to create semiconductors also hampered some names like Intel (INTC). Elsewhere in stock specifics earnings dominated yet again, with Snap-On (SNA), American Express (AXP) Bank of New York Mellon among top performers in the SPX following strong earnings report. On the flipside Phillip Morris (PM) getting smoked following a miss on revenues and a larger decline than expected in cigarette and heated tobacco shipments, this rolled on to Altria (MO) also closing among the worst SPX performers. &nbsp;SPX -0.59% at 2693, NDX -0.86% at 6774, DJI -0.34% at 24664.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yield curve bear-flattened on Thursday with most of the action seen in the long-end, where 30yr yields were higher by c.6bps. The 2s30s spread widened by c.5bos at settlement, and the 5s30s wider by 2bps &ndash; the steepening leaves 2s30s and 5s30s more or less flat for the week. US Treasury announced that it will next week sell $32bln in 2yr notes, $35bln in 5yr notes, $29bln in 7yr and $17bln in a 2yr FRN. The US Treasury sold $16bln of 5-year TIPS, stopping through slightly. While it is difficult to compare internals given the large time frame between the previous 5-year TIPS auction, the internals were good, with dealer takedown the beneath recent averages, while cover was slightly firmer. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 10 ticks lower at 119-26+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: </strong>Stocks down, USD up, treasuries down, oil down<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW:</strong> Soft UK retail sales, BOE&rsquo;s Carney dovish, mixed Philly Fed, weekly claims in line.<br /><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>Japan CPI (overnight), FOMC voter Mester (after market), Canada CPI and retail sales (Fri), OPEC+ (Fri), FOMC voter Williams and Fed&rsquo;s Evans (Fri), BOE&rsquo;s Saunders (Fri)., Eurozone consumer confidence (Fri).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*TRADE WARS: </strong>in late trade, a US official said US Treasury weighing emergency powers on China. Much of the trade talk came from Canada today: PM Trudeau noted the Mexican and US elections are putting pressure on NAFTA talks, and Foreign Minister Freeland said NAFTA negotiators are currently in intensified engagement. Elsewhere, German FinMin Scholz said that Germany and France are not seeking a special trade deal with the US, though are seeking permanent exemptions on US steel tariffs. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CENTRAL BANK SPEAK: BOE Governor Carney</strong> said we should prepare for a number of interest rate hikes over the next few years, though was unspecific on timing. Traders seemed focused on the line that the MPC is conscious that there are other meetings over the course of this year (a hint that the May hike is not a dead-cert), and Carney noted wage growth and productivity require improvements, also acknowledging mixed data this week, which was likely the reason for the dovish price reaction. <strong>BoE&rsquo;s Cunliffe</strong> (Dove) expressed warning on trade and noted tensions could spill over into other areas. <strong>Fed&rsquo;s Brainard </strong>(voter, dove) said inflation is well anchored bet there are some signs of imbalances. <strong>Fed&rsquo;s Quarles</strong> (Voter, Neutral) sees no reason to intervene in the debate between banks and the gun industry. In Europe, <strong>ECB &ldquo;sources&rdquo;</strong> reported that the central bank was not likely to raise rates before the end of 2019, and QE will end in 2018; the view saw little price action given there was little fresh insight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA: US Philly Fed </strong>data for April saw the headline rise slightly, against a consensus expectation of a decline, but sub-indices were mixed. The Easter effect may have weighed on new orders, analysts said, though the employment component rose. Weekly <strong>jobless claims</strong> data was more or less in line with expectations, falling 1k in the week to 232k. Pantheon Macroeconomics notes that claims have been above trend in recent weeks, but this is likely due to the timing of Easter, and that impact will fade soon. In the UK, this week&rsquo;s soft inflation data was followed-up by a weak <strong>retail sales</strong> report, which was likely hit on weather effects. Analysts still expect a May hike from the BOE (though probability has fallen to above 80% from around 90% at the beginning of the week), but there seems to be a growing view that a second BOE hike in 2018 may be under threat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.59% at 2693, NDX -0.86% at 6774, DJI -0.34% at 24664&nbsp; SECTORS: CONS CYC (XLY):&nbsp; -0.36%, CONS NON-CYC (XLP): -3.14%, ENERGY (XLE): +0.14%, FINANCIALS (XLF): +1.53%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): -0.81%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): -0.29%, MATERIALS (XLB): -1.07%, TECH (XLK): -1.13%, TELECOMS (XTL): -0.78%, UTLITIES (XLU): -0.09%. </strong>US Equity futures trended lower through Thursday trade printing lows beneath 2685, however in late trade reports suggested US Deputy AG Rosenstein told US President Trump that he is not going to be a target of a probe. Further, Trump said he will not remove special counsel Mueller which gave a lift to Emini futures testing the 2700 level. Pre-market trade on Thursday saw a heavy dose of M&amp;A news; focus was on Shire (SHPG) / (SHP LN) as Takeda (4502 JT) made a new offer of &pound;46.50/shr but it was rejected by the pharmaceutical company; further source reports suggested it was to have two others bidding for the company, in which Allergan (AGN) came out noting they were in early acquisition talks, but the final source reports told CNBC that AGN would not be making a bid, which was then later on confirmed, but Allergan did note they&rsquo;re continuing to evaluate strategic options. Further, Comcast (CMCSA) sent a bid for Fox&rsquo;s Assets, higher than Disney&rsquo;s (DIS) offer, however CNCB notes the conditions were not favourable and were said to raise regulatory concerns. Elsewhere, reports In NY Post stated that the US DoJ is said to be close to clearing the $6.6bln Sinclair (SBGI) &amp; Tribune Media (TRCO) merger. Semiconductor names were in focus today following poor outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) which expects Q2 revenue to be between $7.8bln and $7.9bln, roughly $1bln lower than wall street estimates. This had a knock-on effect to other chipmakers with the SOX spending the session in the red and chip names all at the bottom of the NDX. Also, reports just before the close yesterday that Facebook (FB) is said to create a team to create semiconductors also hampered some names like Intel (INTC). Elsewhere in stock specifics earnings dominated yet again, with Snap-On (SNA), American Express (AXP) Bank of New York Mellon among top performers in the SPX following strong earnings report. On the flipside Phillip Morris (PM) getting smoked following a miss on revenues and a larger decline than expected in cigarette and heated tobacco shipments, this rolled on to Altria (MO) also closing among the worst SPX performers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI futures settle down 18 cents at USD 68.29/bbl, Brent futures settle up 30 cents at USD 73.78/bbl.</strong> Oil bulls continue to push crude to multi-year highs, and as UBS points out, bulls now have the ball in their court after the recent EIA, IEA and OPEC reports hint that demand growth has begun to outpace supply growth; additionally, geopolitical inject a further upside bias &ndash; and traders are alert to the Trump administration potentially re-applying sanctions on Iran (US has until 12/May to make a decision). In crude specific news, ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting between OPEC+ policymakers, sources reported that OPEC+ panel has found that the oil glut has been virtually eliminated, largely due to the supply cut deal. However, the monitoring committee noted that developed nations&rsquo; inventories stood at 12mln bbls above the five-year average, some 340mln bbls above the average in January 2017, highlighting the work that the cartel still needs to do. Elsewhere, Norway reported prelim oil production in March declined to 1.519mln BPD (Prev. 1.564mln). Other OPEC sources reported that in meetings there was no talk from Saudi Arabia to target a $100/bbl price, and that such a target would be a &ldquo;danger&rdquo; to the market. Another OPEC source report that Iraq was still cheating on its quota. Elsewhere, Genscape was said to have reported Cushing stocks are forecast to build by 700k in the week (change vs 13/April).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES:</strong> <strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 10 ticks lower at 119-26+. </strong>The yield curve bear-flattened on Thursday with most of the action seen in the long-end, where 30yr yields were higher by c.6bps.<strong> </strong>The 2s30s spread widened<strong> </strong>by c.5bos at settlement, and the 5s30s wider by 2bps &ndash; the steepening leaves 2s30s and 5s30s more or less flat for the week. US Treasury announced that it will next week sell $32bln in 2yr notes, $35bln in 5yr notes, $29bln in 7yr and $17bln in a 2yr FRN. The US Treasury sold $16bln of 5-year TIPS, stopping through slightly. While it is difficult to compare internals given the large time frame between the previous 5-year TIPS auction, the internals were good, with dealer takedown the beneath recent averages, while cover was slightly firmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> An all too familiar story for the Greenback with several attempts to rally and the DXY up to 89.700+ at one stage, but the broad Dollar unable to extend or sustain gains and ultimately fading. <strong>GBP </strong>Not quite zero to hero, but a sterling effort by the Pound given triple dose of disappointing data this week. Cable initially extended its reversal from new post-Brexit vote high (around 1.4375) to circa 1.4160 on a bad retail sales miss, but is back above 1.4200 and looking to close over the 200 HMA at 1.4225 to resume its April rally. However, after the gilt market close, comments from BoE&rsquo;s Governor Carney put a downward bias into sterling, with some interpreting his comments as a suggestion that the May hike was not a dead-cert. <strong>NZDAUD </strong>The Kiwi is losing grip of the 0.7300 handle vs the Usd after Q1 CPI slowed markedly in y/y terms to 1.1% and further below the RBNZ&rsquo;s 2% target, while its antipodean peer is holding up better, but recoiling from another advance above 0.7800 in wake of downbeat Aussie employment data, both in headline and full time placement terms. <strong>JPY/EUR/CAD </strong>All locked in tight confines, with USDJPY absorbing some exporter offers around 107.50, but not all and finding plenty of support ahead of 107.00, while EURUSD pivoted 1.2375 between a 1.2400-1.2350 band and USDCAD saw similar price action either side of 1.2600 even though Canada&rsquo;s ADP was strong and there was more good news on NAFTA negotiations (telecoms chapter reportedly settled to take the tally to 11). <strong>USDCHF</strong> popped above 0.9700, and arguably around the time that EURCHF touched 1.2000 (depending on what price feed or platform is referenced), before relative sharp retracements in both pairs. Note, however, one of the prominent Swiss banks is looking for further Franc depreciation. <strong>USDRUB, USDTRY and USDMXN </strong>saw more lively price action, with the Rouble underpinned within 60.5000-61.2000 trading parameters amidst the ongoing crude oil rally and the Lira extending its recovery to almost 4.0000 before losing some impetus, but the Peso handing back more gains from sub-18.0000 levels on a wave of Mexican political jitters.</p>\r\n",

Cable initially extended its reversal from new post-Brexit vote high (around 1.4375) to circa 1.4160 on a bad retail sales miss, but is back above 1.4200 and looking to close over the 200 HMA at 1.4225 to resume its April rally. Note also, M&amp;A flows could support the Gbp as a US name is said to have entered the frame to buy Shire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD/AUD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is losing grip of the 0.7300 handle vs the Usd after Q1 CPI slowed markedly in y/y terms to 1.1% and further below the RBNZ&rsquo;s 2% target, while its antipodean peer is holding up better, but recoiling from another advance above 0.7800 in wake of downbeat Aussie employment data, both in headline and full time placement terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/EUR/CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All locked in tight confines, with Usd/Jpy absorbing some exporter offers around 107.50, but not all and finding plenty of support ahead of 107.00, while Eur/Usd pivoted 1.2375 between a 1.2400-1.2350 band and Usd/Cad saw similar price action either side of 1.2600 even though Canada&rsquo;s ADP was strong and there was more good news on NAFTA negotiations (telecoms chapter reportedly settled to take the tally to 11).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Chf popped above 0.9700, and arguably around the time that Eur/Chf touched 1.2000 (depending on what price feed or platform is referenced), before relative sharp retracements in both pairs. Note, however, one of the prominent Swiss banks is looking for further Franc depreciation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EM </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Rub, Usd/Try and Usd/Mxn saw more lively price action, with the Rouble underpinned within 60.5000-61.2000 trading parameters amidst the ongoing crude oil rally and the Lira extending its recovery to almost 4.0000 before losing some impetus, but the Peso handing back more gains from sub-18.0000 levels on a wave of Mexican political jitters.</p>\r\n",

However, bond bulls and jobbers looking more a counter-trend move in debt could turn a profit given a bounce in Bunds from 158.45 to 158.55 or so amidst hourly tech studies suggesting oversold conditions and short covering.

ASX 200 (+0.3%) was lifted by commodity names as miners outperformed amid strength in metals prices, which also boosted BHP shares despite a disappointing quarterly iron ore production update. Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) was also led higher by metal stocks and in tandem with a weaker currency, while Hang Seng (+1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) conformed to the commodity-led gains with the blue-chip energy stocks in Hong Kong cheering the higher oil prices and with sentiment also helped by another firm liquidity operation by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued as upside in riskier assets sapped safe-haven demand, and with price action also kept tame by mixed 20yr auction results which showed reduced demand but higher accepted prices.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PBoC injected CNY 190bln via 7-day reverse repos.

Large cap stocks news are as follows, with ABB beating EBITDA expectations (+4.9%) pushing industrials to be the sector outperformer whilst Novartis (-1.9%) have dragged down healthcare. Nestle (+0.3%) falling in line with expectations, Unilever (-1.9%) who were disappointing and Pernod Ricard (-0.9%) announcing an earnings beat. In the M&amp;A scope, Merck (+0.5%) confirmed their decision to offload their consumer unit to P&amp;G for around EUR 3.4bln</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index remains contained in a relatively tight range around 89.500, and mostly firmer for choice, but narrowly mixed vs G10 counterparts. The commodity currencies are gleaning support from underlying price gains, while comments from China&rsquo;s SAFE contending that the Dollar may decline further as other global economies catch up has also aided EMs to recoup more recent losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling&rsquo;s April winning streak has hit another potential obstacle in the shape of much weaker than expected UK retail sales data, and Cable has fallen back below the 1.4200 handle as a result to re-test and marginally breach lows seen in wake of Wednesday&rsquo;s CPI miss. Market contacts report sell-stops through 1.4170, but there has been limited follow-through so far with Gbp/Usd finding buyers around 1.4160 and Eur/Gbp capped just ahead of 0.8740.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A marginal outperformer as broad risk appetite and extended rallies in oil/metals more than offset a disappointing Aussie jobs report overnight, but Aud/Usd is still finding the atmosphere above 0.7800 tough to reside in, with some key chart resistance levels also keeping the pair in check (200 DMA at 0.7817 and a 0.7831 Fib.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both sticking rigidly to recent ranges, with key chart levels restraining price action alongside hefty and some mega option expiries. Eur/Usd looks bid below 1.2350 and offered on treks above 1.2400, while Usd/Jpy has been supported just under 107.00 and mostly resistant around 107.50-55.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD/CAD/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All still on a weaker footing, the Kiwi hovering just above 0.7300 vs the Usd after mixed NZ inflation data, the Loonie still reflecting on cautious/dovish BoC policy guidance with Usd/Cad above 1.2600 and Franc feeling the effects of Russian asset repatriation with Usd/Chf edging back towards 0.9700 and Eur/Chf just pips away from 1.2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts only partially pared losses on the 3rd UK data miss in a row, with the DMO auction probably capping the rebound (though in the event the tap was well received) , and the 10 year bond actually posting a fresh low for the day in recent trade at 121.67 (-57 ticks) before finding some traction again. Meanwhile, Bunds have been as low as 158.45 (-60 ticks) and supply issues seem to have pushed French OATs and Spanish Bonos deeper into negative territory amidst mixed auction results. USTs also erring towards the path of least resistance again as fixed income in general remains in bear (steepening) clutches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at the commodities complex, WTI (+0.8%) and Brent (+1%) remain close to highs that were last seen in 2014 amid reports yesterday Saudi Arabia would favour crude prices to rise US 80/bbl, or even USD 100/bbl. The upside is also followed the DoE inventory report which mirrored the API release and showed drawdowns across all product components. In the metals bloc, gold is trading softer amid pressure from a slightly firmer dollar, whilst Dalian iron ore rose almost 7% overnight, and Nickel soared 9% to a three-year high amid Russian sanction by the US on major Russian aluminium producer Rusal. Nickel has now risen over 16% in the last two sessions, whilst the Shanghai Futures Exchange cut intra-day transaction fees for nickel futures contracts for May to CNY 6 from current CNY 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC and Non-OPEC committee are said to have seen stockpiles nearly cleared.

        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equities have seen the narrative subside from macro effects and move toward individual stock news as the Eurostoxx remains roughly flat (-0.05%), with FTSE as the outperforming index (+0.2% due to FX effects) and SMI (-0.07%) the underperformer amid domestic earnings. Large cap stocks news are as follows, with ABB beating EBITDA expectations (+4.9%) pushing industrials to be the sector outperformer whilst Novartis (-1.9%) have dragged down healthcare. Nestle (+0.3%) falling in line with expectations, Unilever (-1.9%) who were disappointing and Pernod Ricard (-0.9%) announcing an earnings beat. In the M&amp;A scope, Merck (+0.5%) confirmed their decision to offload their consumer unit to P&amp;G for around EUR 3.4bln</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index remains contained in a relatively tight range around 89.500, and mostly firmer for choice, but narrowly mixed vs G10 counterparts. The commodity currencies are gleaning support from underlying price gains, while comments from China&rsquo;s SAFE contending that the Dollar may decline further as other global economies catch up has also aided EMs to recoup more recent losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling&rsquo;s April winning streak has hit another potential obstacle in the shape of much weaker than expected UK retail sales data, and Cable has fallen back below the 1.4200 handle as a result to re-test and marginally breach lows seen in wake of Wednesday&rsquo;s CPI miss. Market contacts report sell-stops through 1.4170, but there has been limited follow-through so far with Gbp/Usd finding buyers around 1.4160 and Eur/Gbp capped just ahead of 0.8740.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A marginal outperformer as broad risk appetite and extended rallies in oil/metals more than offset a disappointing Aussie jobs report overnight, but Aud/Usd is still finding the atmosphere above 0.7800 tough to reside in, with some key chart resistance levels also keeping the pair in check (200 DMA at 0.7817 and a 0.7831 Fib.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both sticking rigidly to recent ranges, with key chart levels restraining price action alongside hefty and some mega option expiries. Eur/Usd looks bid below 1.2350 and offered on treks above 1.2400, while Usd/Jpy has been supported just under 107.00 and mostly resistant around 107.50-55.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD/CAD/CHF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All still on a weaker footing, the Kiwi hovering just above 0.7300 vs the Usd after mixed NZ inflation data, the Loonie still reflecting on cautious/dovish BoC policy guidance with Usd/Cad above 1.2600 and Franc feeling the effects of Russian asset repatriation with Usd/Chf edging back towards 0.9700 and Eur/Chf just pips away from 1.2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts only partially pared losses on the 3rd UK data miss in a row, with the DMO auction probably capping the rebound (though in the event the tap was well received) , and the 10 year bond actually posting a fresh low for the day in recent trade at 121.67 (-57 ticks) before finding some traction again. Meanwhile, Bunds have been as low as 158.48 (-57 ticks) and supply issues seem to have pushed French OATs and Spanish Bonos deeper into negative territory amidst mixed auction results. USTs also erring towards the path of least resistance again as fixed income in general remains in bear (steepening) clutches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at the commodities complex, WTI (+0.8%) and Brent (+1%) remain close to highs that were last seen in 2014 amid reports yesterday Saudi Arabia would favour crude prices to rise US 80/bbl, or even USD 100/bbl. The upside is also followed the DoE inventory report which mirrored the API release and showed drawdowns across all product components. In the metals bloc, gold is trading softer amid pressure from a slightly firmer dollar, whilst Dalian iron ore rose almost 7% overnight, and Nickel soared 9% to a three-year high amid Russian sanction by the US on major Russian aluminium producer Rusal. Nickel has now risen over 16% in the last two sessions, whilst the Shanghai Futures Exchange cut intra-day transaction fees for nickel futures contracts for May to CNY 6 from current CNY 30.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) was lifted by commodity names with miners outperforming amid strength in metals prices, which has also boosted BHP shares despite a disappointing quarterly iron production update. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) is also led higher by metal stocks and in tandem with a weaker currency, while Hang Seng (+1.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) conform to the commodity-led gains with the blue-chip energy stocks in Hong Kong cheering the higher oil prices and with sentiment also helped by another firm liquidity operation by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY was marginally higher which hampered its major counterparts and pulled GBP/USD back below the 1.4200 handle following yesterday&rsquo;s softer than expected CPI data, while CAD also found little redemption from the post-BoC policy meeting pressure after Governor Poloz said interest rates may need to remain below the neutral range. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was underpinned as the sentiment spurred JPY outflows, while antipodeans were dictated by releases with AUD pressured by abysmal Employment numbers and with NZD subdued after CPI data beat expectations Q/Q but also showed a substantial Y/Y slowdown from the prior quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand lacking amid the upside in riskier assets, while participants also await a 20yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
