Berkshire Hathaway (BRKb) surged after reporting its quarterly profit doubling as well as a share repurchase programme. Under Armour (UAA) was a top mover following an upgrade at Piper Jaffray. Big tech names took a hit today with Apple (AAPL) sliding lower after a report of slowing demand and production for its iPhone XR. Wider pessimism in FAANG stocks brought down Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which were also pressured by comments from US President Trump over the weekend who said he was looking into whether the companies have violated antitrust laws. Sysco (SYY) was also in the red on the back of reporting EPS and revenue below estimates. Video game heavyweight Activision Blizzard (ATVI) also traded lower on the day; this comes after a poorly received announcement of a mobile game this weekend amidst the broad tech weakness and ahead of their earnings report on Thursday.

Whitehall sources appeared sceptical about a breakthrough in negotiations at the end of this week and therefore pushed the prospective date for a deal to November 27th-28th. There were also reports that the UK is aiming for a late November Brexit summit with BBC Laura Kuenssberg citing November 26th /27th as potential dates. With regards to negotiations, Irish PM Varadkar and PM May held a phone call where both leaders emphasized their commitment to avoid a hard border and the need for a legally operable backstop; Varadkar also said PM May raised the possibility of a review mechanism for backstop over which he would be open to consider proposals. Nonetheless, UK PM May&rsquo;s spokesman noted there are outstanding and significant issues relating to the Irish backstop and work is ongoing to resolve them and, similarly, an EU Commission spokesman stated technical works continue in order to reach a Brexit deal, but that they are not there yet. Looking ahead, May will host a cabinet meeting on Tuesday and will reportedly tell ministers that failure to support her plans with make dissenters responsible for a no-deal Brexit. In later comments, UK PM May told Austria&#39;s PM Kurz 95% of the withdrawal deal is complete and she is confident a solution can be found on the NI backstop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Italy&rsquo;s approach to its budget plan continued to face EU criticism; reports in Politico suggested the EU Commission is to propose disciplining Italy on November 21st unless the region amends its budget plan, an assertion later dismissed by European Commissioner Moscovici who stated sanctions on Italy are &ldquo;fake news&rdquo;. Moscovici went on to say that he has not yet made up his mind on whether to start disciplinary steps. In related comments, Eurogroup Head Centeno said the Eurogroup will not take any decisions on the country but hopes Italy bring the budget in-line with rules, whilst EU&#39;s Dombrovskis reiterated once again that the fiscal plan needs substantial adjustments and that the country is openly not acting in line with EU rules. Later in the day, EU sources reported that Eurozone finance ministers have urged Italy&#39;s Economy Minister Tria to change the budget plan in a closed-door meeting and have agreed with the European Commission that the Italian budget breaks EU rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> EU&#39;s Dombrovskis said that EU trade talks continue with the US but there is no deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Smets (Dove) said low rates are necessary to help the European area recovery adding that he expects further expansion in the Euro area. Elsewhere, five sources reported that ECB policymakers are keen to avoid market disruption with the switch to the new capital key; one source sees the new capital key applying only to new asset purchases, and another sees it gradually applied to stock of bonds. The ECB&#39;s &quot;operation twist&quot; runs into constraints in some countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ISM NON-MANUFACTURING INDEX </strong>came in at 60.3 for October, beating the expected figure of 59.3 and slightly lower than September&rsquo;s 61.6. Wells Fargo notes that this figure, coming off a 21-year high from September, still signals a &ldquo;robust&rdquo; pace of activity, and that a tight supply chain from increasing backlogs of orders and supplier delivery times suggests continued inflationary pressures. Looking into the sub-components: business activity fell by 2.7 points to 62.5, cooler than the expected 64.5; new orders recorded 61.5, essentially flat from September&rsquo;s 61.5; employment index read 59.7, down 2.7 points from September but still strong and in line with the solid payrolls number on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.56% at 2738, NDX -0.40% at 6937, DJI +0.76% at 25461. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +1.61%, Materials +0.38%, Industrials +0.53%, Cons Discretionary -0.18%, Cons Staples +1.21%, Healthcare +0.84%, Financials +1.40%, Tech -0.18%, Telecoms -0.31%, Utilities +1.39%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Energy names made gains today following the rally in oil with stocks such as Chevron (CVX), Apache (APA) and Halliburton (HAL) all trading higher. Berkshire Hathaway (BRKb) surged after reporting its quarterly profit doubling as well as a share repurchase programme. Under Armour (UAA) was a top mover following an upgrade at Piper Jaffray. Big tech names took a hit today with Apple (AAPL) sliding lower after a report of slowing demand and production for its iPhone XR. Wider pessimism in FAANG stocks brought down Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which were also pressured by comments from US President Trump over the weekend who said he was looking into whether the companies have violated antitrust laws. Sysco (SYY) was also in the red on the back of reporting EPS and revenue below estimates. Video game heavyweight Activision Blizzard (ATVI) also traded lower on the day; this comes after a poorly received announcement of a mobile game this weekend amidst the broad tech weakness and ahead of their earnings report on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.04 LOWER AT USD 63.10/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 0.34 HIGHER AT USD 73.17/BBL.</strong> Oil prices closed in the red on Monday as markets digested the new Iranian sanctions imposed by the US. US Secretary of State Pompeo said more than 20 countries have already cut oil imports from Iran, reducing purchases by more than 1mln bpd. Although gains were restricted, partly due to the US confirming the eight countries it would temporarily waver the sanctions on: China, India, Greece, Italy, Taiwan, Japan, Turkey and South Korea; some of these are Iran&rsquo;s top importers. Trump later added that he wants to go slow on the tariffs and does not want to drive up world oil prices which contributed to a reversal in previous gains. Iran also threw wood on the fire by saying it would break away from the sanctions and continue exporting oil; it later announced it had other channels planned for trade with partners. This week&rsquo;s API are seeing headline crude +2.1mln, distillates -2.8mln, gasoline -2.6mln and cushing +36k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES TICKS HIGHER AT 118-05+. </strong>Treasuries were only marginally higher on Monday as investors were cautious ahead of the mid-term elections tomorrow and ahead of the FOMC rate decision due on Thursday. The yield curve saw some modest bull-flattening with yields on the short-end of the curve pivoting around the unchanged mark whilst longer dated yields were lower by c.2bps at settlement. 2s30s narrowed by c.3bps and 2s10s by c.2bps.The US treasury sold USD 37bln in 3yr notes tailing by 0.3bps at a high yield of 2.983%. Demand was soft as the bid-to-cover came in at 2.54x, well below recent averages and &nbsp;the lowest since July. Directs took the smallest portion since December 2009, indirects were awarded the biggest share since June whilst dealers were left with the largest share since July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Cable and the Pound in general has been relatively (remarkably?) resilient in the face of reports that the UK Government has imposed a 1 week deadline to resolve the remaining and key issues on Brexit with the EU before resorting to default no deal mode, ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting that could be crucial for PM May. Moreover, reports suggest that Brexit Minister Raab may resign if she agrees to an indefinite back-stop on the Irish border and all UK customs union, while the macro backdrop turns decidedly downbeat vs last Thursday&rsquo;s improved BoE assessment as the services PMI weakened more than expected and IHS Markit projected tepid 0.2% q/q growth for the 3 months ending October vs forecast for 0.6% Q3 GDP. However, Cable rebounded from sub-1.3000 again and Eur/Gbp held around 0.8750 as the single currency suffered more Italian fiscal jitters &ndash; more to on this come later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, CAD, AUD: </strong>The Kiwi maintained its recovery momentum from overnight lows and a disappointing NZ Treasury survey to nudge up towards 0.6670 whilst the Loonie &nbsp;extended its comeback from circa 1.3110 to 1.3070 on the back of hawkish-sounding comments from BoC&rsquo;s Poloz (current pace of policy normalisation just right, but pace of hikes rise or fall depending on data) before USD weakness pushed the pair back towards 1.3100. &nbsp;Meanwhile, the Aud lagged, though did just reclaim 0.7200+ status amidst ongoing US-China trade uncertainty and eyeing the RBA overnight for some independent impetus &ndash; check out the Research Suite for a full preview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, JPY, CHF:</strong> Narrowly mixed vs the Greenback even though the DXY slipped a bit further from post-NFP peaks to trade back below 96.400, with the single currency back on 1.1400+ levels on more Italy vs EU budget angst and USD weakness, while the Jpy bounced above 113.00, albeit also supported ahead of 113.50 having absorbed option-related supply at 113.25 before the NY cut and the Franc rebounded from moderately deeper lows close to 1.0070 to revisit resistance near 1.0020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>A solid start to the week for most if not all regional currencies, benefiting from the aforementioned Dollar downturn (pre-midterm elections and FOMC) and for the Lira also welcoming the US exemption from Iranian sanctions &ndash; Usd/Try through 5.4000 and at fresh multi-month lows. Usd/Zar also trending lower again and now under 14.2000, while Usd/Mxn retested bids under 20.0000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: RBA rate decision due on Tuesday 6th November at 0330GMT/2130CST/1130HKT. </strong>The RBA are to announce its latest policy decision on Tuesday in which the central bank is unanimously expected to keep rates on hold at the record low 1.5% where they have been for more than 2 years, while the board is highly anticipated to retain its view of no strong case for a near-term rate move and that the next move is likely to be upwards. These expectations have been reflected through ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures which price in 100% expectations of no change in the Cash Rate Target, while its implied yield curve suggests February 2020 as the earliest date for when the curve is leaning more towards a hike. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20473/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: US midterm elections (6 November 2018). </strong>Voting to take place Tuesday on 6 November, with polls closing at 8pm local time(s). The base case is for Republicans to retain the Senate, while Democrats are seen winning the House. Democrats taking the House could be a &#39;market-unfriendly&#39; scenario. Key issues for markets are Tax Reform 2.0 and Trade policy. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20464/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n",

US Secretary of State Pompeo said more than 20 countries have already cut oil imports from Iran, reducing purchases by more than 1mln bpd. Although gains were restricted, partly due to the US confirming the eight countries it would temporarily waver the sanctions on: China, India, Greece, Italy, Taiwan, Japan, Turkey and South Korea; some of these are Iran&rsquo;s top importers. Trump later added that he wants to go slow on the tariffs and does not want to drive up world oil prices which contributed to a reversal in previous gains. Iran also threw wood on the fire by saying it would break away from the sanctions and continue exporting oil; it later announced it had other channels planned for trade with partners.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable and the Pound in general has been relatively (remarkably?) resilient in the face of reports that the UK Government has imposed a 1 week deadline to resolve the remaining and key issues on Brexit with the EU before resorting to default no deal mode, ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting that could be crucial for PM May. Moreover, reports suggest that Brexit Minister Raab may resign if she agrees to an indefinite back-stop on the Irish border and all UK customs union, while the macro backdrop turns decidedly downbeat vs last Thursday&rsquo;s improved BoE assessment as the services PMI weakened more than expected and IHS Markit projected tepid 0.2% q/q growth for the 3 months ending October vs forecast for 0.6% Q3 GDP. However, Cable rebounded from sub-1.3000 again and Eur/Gbp held around 0.8750 as the single currency suffered more Italian fiscal jitters &ndash; more to on this come later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CAD/AUD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All firmer vs their US counterpart, as the Kiwi maintained its recovery momentum from overnight lows and a disappointing NZ Treasury survey to nudge up towards 0.6670 and the Loonie extended its comeback from circa 1.3110 to 1.3070 on the back of hawkish-sounding comments from BoC&rsquo;s Poloz (current pace of policy normalisation just right, but pace of hikes rise or fall depending on data), plus a rebound in crude prices as the US re-imposed Iranian sanctions with only selective waivers. Meanwhile, the Aud lagged, though did just reclaim 0.7200+ status amidst ongoing US-China trade uncertainty and eyeing the RBA overnight for some independent impetus &ndash; check out the Research Suite for a full preview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrowly mixed vs the Greenback even though the DXY slipped a bit further from post-NFP peaks to trade back below 96.400, with the single currency unable to sustain 1.1400+ levels on more Italy vs EU budget angst, while the Jpy failed to bounce above 113.00, albeit also supported ahead of 113.50 having absorbed option-related supply at 113.25 before the NY cut and the Franc rebounded from moderately deeper lows close to 1.0070 to revisit resistance near 1.0020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A solid start to the week for most if not all regional currencies, benefiting from the aforementioned Dollar downturn (pre-midterm elections and FOMC) and for the Lira also welcoming the US exemption from Iranian sanctions &ndash; Usd/Try through 5.4000 and at fresh multi-month lows. Usd/Zar also trending lower again and now under 14.2000, while Usd/Mxn retested bids under 20.0000.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) were negative after US administration officials downplayed prospects of an imminent resolution to the US-China trade dispute and with Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI at the weakest since September 2017 and June 2016 respectively, while the PBoC Medium-term Lending Facility announcement and President Xi&rsquo;s pledge to further open up China&rsquo;s economy only helped plug losses momentarily. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher as the risk averse tone spurred demand for safety. This helped prices recover from Friday&rsquo;s declines which coincided with a sell-off in T-notes and a surge in US yields by the most in the month following the NFP-beat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations but conducted CNY 403.5bln 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility vs. Prev. CNY 265bln with rates unchanged at 3.30%. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8976 (Prev. 6.9371)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Services PMI (Oct) 50.8 vs. Exp. 52.9 (Prev. 53.1); lowest since September 2017<br />Chinese Caixin Composite PMI (Oct) 50.5 (Prev. 52.1); lowest since June 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese President Xi said China pledges to open market to the world, while he added that countries must pursue open policy and oppose protectionism. Furthermore, President Xi stated that China will stimulate potential for increased imports and are to further reduce import tariffs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ minutes from September meeting stated that most members shared the view that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI was likely to increase gradually toward 2% and that it is appropriate to continue easing persistently. Furthermore, the minutes noted that financial conditions are highly accommodative and that most members agreed momentum to target was intact. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda said BoJ is aware continued loose policy impacts financial system stability and financial intermediation, while he added the BoJ must carefully watch demerits of easing and that large deflation policy is no longer the most appropriate. Kuroda also commented that when BoJ seeks to exit easy policy, the yield curve will steepen although that alone will not lift financial institutions out of structural problems, while he later reiterated there is no change in stance of reaching 2% target and that BoJ needs to continue easing persistently to the CPI target. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May secured private concessions from Brussels that will keep Britain in a customs union and avoid a hard border, while reports also noted Britain is on course for a future economic partnership deal with the EU. (Sunday Times) However, some sources noted that Downing Street had dismissed this as speculation. (Twitter) May will host a cabinet meeting on Tuesday and will reportedly tell ministers that failure to support her plans with make dissenters responsible for a no-deal Brexit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary Raab pressed UK PM May to take a hard line regarding Irish border and urged her to back plan to pull UK out of backstop plan at only 3-months&rsquo; notice. (Telegraph/FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior EU officials stated that UK PM May&#39;s chances of reaching an Irish border deal are &#39;50-50&#39; and that competing red lines between UK and EU continue to be incompatible in important areas. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irish Foreign Minister Coveney tweeted &quot;The Irish position remains consistent and v clear that a &ldquo;time-limited backstop&rdquo; or a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to by IRE&quot;; adding that &ldquo;these ideas are not backstops at all, they don&rsquo;t deliver on previous UK commitments&rdquo;. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Commission spokesman says technical works continues in order to reach a Brexit deal; but we are not there yet. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May spokesman says Brexit talks are making good progress but there is still work to do; adding they do not want a backstop to be in place and are looking for a mechanism to deal with it. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBC&#39;s Chief Political Editor Kuenssberg tweeted that talks still stuck on backstop mechanism, if there is to be a November summit there must be decisive process and Tusk won&#39;t press the button unless both sides are sure the makings of a deal are there (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ITV&#39;s Political Editor Peston tweeted &quot;The UK government has decided that unless there is a Brexit deal within a week, the default option of a no-deal Brexit becomes the probable outcome, which is why officials are working through the night&quot;, adding &ldquo;The important dates are tomorrow, when the prime minister briefs her cabinet on the likely shape of a deal, and (probably) next Monday - which is the probable cut-off day for organising an emergency Brexit council of EU leaders.&rdquo; The article also states that eyes re on UK Brexit Secretary Raab as &ldquo;a few members of the Cabinet may prefer to resign than endorse what they would see as backstop&rdquo;. (Twitter/Facebook)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RTE&#39;s Political Editor Connelly, after having spoken to various officials, tweeted &quot;Dublin and the EU Task Force are still insisting on a Northern Ireland-specific backstop as a final safety net if the UK-wide customs arrangement doesn&#39;t work&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Markit/CIPS Services PMI (Oct) 52.2 vs. Exp. 53.3 (Prev. 53.9)<br />UK Composite PMI (Oct) M/M 52.1 vs. exp. 53.4 (Prev. 54.1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian government are to call for a confidence vote in the upper house senate regarding the security bill, according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European Commission&rsquo;s Vice President Dombrovskis reiterated that the Italian budget plan needs substantial adjustments. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Press reports speculate that any agreement reached between President Trump and Chinese President Xi is likely to be a temporary truce instead of a significant step forward. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European Commission&rsquo;s Vice President Dombrovskis says that EU trade talks continue with the US but there is no deadline. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are mixed, with Spain&rsquo;s IBEX 35 (+0.5%) leading the gains, and Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB (-0.4%) lagging as the index is weighed on by local banking names such as Banco BPM (-2.5%) and Intesa Sanpaolo (-2.0%) as finance minister discuss Italy and amid the release of stress test results, which showed the former as the worst performing Italian lender following a slump in the nation&rsquo;s bonds amid political turmoil. Furthermore, Barclays (-0.1%) and Lloyds Banking Group (-0.8%) were amongst the worst performers due to weak growth, credit losses and Brexit uncertainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, major sectors are mixed with utilities (+0.6%) and consumer staples (+0.6%) outperforming, while industrials are lagging (-0.5%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of individual equities, GAM (+2%) shares are in the green after being approached by Schroders (-1.6%) regarding a potential acquisition; which sources say GAM rejected. On the flip side, Hiscox (-7.3%) are lagging in the Stoxx 600, after their earnings showed a substantial increase in written premiums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The broad Dollar has lost some of Friday&rsquo;s post-NFP recovery momentum ahead of the US mid-term elections and FOMC, but the index is holding relatively firm around 96.500 as major pairings trade somewhat mixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD - Vying for top spot amongst G10 rivals, and perhaps surprisingly or unexpectedly as the Pound recovers from another UK PMI miss, and from the major services sector. However, Cable is back above 1.3000 from a knee-jerk dip to circa 1.2970 and still benefiting from latest press reports suggesting the EU has made concessions on the Irish border and customs front, albeit someway off high just over 1.3060 at one stage. Similarly, the Kiwi has rebounded firmly from overnight lows on the back of a pretty downbeat NZ Treasury business survey revealing a further deterioration in sentiment over Q3 and risks to the growth outlook for 2018 and next year due to global trade spats. Nzd/Usd back up around 0.6665 vs 0.6635 at worst, with cross-winds also helping as AUD/Nzd remains anchored near 1.0800 and Aud/Usd struggles to climb through 0.7200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/JPY/CHF - All underperforming vs the Greenback, with the single currency capped around 1.1400 and still wary about another Italy vs EU face-off on the budget, while the Loonie straddles 1.3100 after last Friday&rsquo;s NA jobs data (Canadian not as upbeat as US, largely on soft wages) and ahead of a speech by BoC Governor Poloz. Usd/Jpy has nudged further beyond 113.00 and soaked up offers/hedges vs a modest 113.25 option expiry and the Franc is back under parity within a 1.0020-55 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Regional currencies are broadly weaker vs the Usd with the Yuans undermined by less encouraging US-China trade vibes and weak Chinese PMIs, while the Try is pivoting 5.4500 in wake of Turkish inflation data showing a further rise in CPI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.3%) and Brent (-0.1%) are just off session lows with choppy trade experienced in the complex following the implementation of oil-related sanctions on Iran by the US. Iranian President emerged stating that Iran will sell oil and break sanctions, while he added that Iran is open to talks with the US once President Trump respects commitments. Temporary exemptions are being granted to eight countries making the sanctions less severe than anticipated, additionally removing the risk of a supply shortage according some analysts. Furthermore, Iranian press noted that the terms of the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) with the EU will be announced soon. The SPV is the European effort to process Iran&rsquo;s import and export payments. Diplomats said the details are being discussed by finance ministers, with EU Finance Ministers due to meet in Brussels on Tuesday, although the SPV was not on the agenda as of Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.1%) is flat and off of session highs as the yellow metal mirrors USD moves. Elsewhere, copper prices pulled back on profit taking and amid the averse risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a fleeting uptick in Gilts on the UK services PMI miss before a retest of pre-release Liffe lows and subsequent minor loss of Fib support to 121.60 (-24 ticks vs +8 ticks at best), as the FTSE regroups alongside other EU indices, and only partly on currency effect. In truth, trade is all very choppy with Bunds also back down near worst levels traded on Eurex having climbed to 159.91 (+28 ticks) when Italian bonds lost grip of the 122.00 handle, and the 10 year Eurozone benchmarks now somewhat decoupled. However, US Treasuries remain on a modestly firmer footing and rather oblivious ahead of a big week, with mid-term election, Fed and supply risk all impending.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, Barclays (-0.1%) and Lloyds Banking Group (-0.8%) were amongst the worst performers due to weak growth, credit losses and Brexit uncertainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, major sectors are mixed with utilities (+0.6%) and consumer staples (+0.6%) outperforming, while industrials are lag (-0.5%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of individual equities, GAM (+2%) shares are in the green after being approached by Schroders (-1.6%) regarding a potential acquisition; which sources say GAM rejected. On the flip side, Hiscox (-7.3%) are lagging in the Stoxx 600, after their earnings showed a substantial increase in written premiums.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The broad Dollar has lost some of Friday&rsquo;s post-NFP recovery momentum ahead of the US mid-term elections and FOMC, but the index is holding relatively firm around 96.500 as major pairings trade somewhat mixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD - Vying for top spot amongst G10 rivals, and perhaps surprisingly or unexpectedly as the Pound recovers from another UK PMI miss, and from the major services sector. However, Cable is back above 1.3000 from a knee-jerk dip to circa 1.2970 and still benefiting from latest press reports suggesting the EU has made concessions on the Irish border and customs front, albeit someway off high just over 1.3060 at one stage. Similarly, the Kiwi has rebounded firmly from overnight lows on the back of a pretty downbeat NZ Treasury business survey revealing a further deterioration in sentiment over Q3 and risks to the growth outlook for 2018 and next year due to global trade spats. Nzd/Usd back up around 0.6665 vs 0.6635 at worst, with cross-winds also helping as AUD/Nzd remains anchored near 1.0800 and Aud/Usd struggles to climb through 0.7200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/JPY/CHF - All underperforming vs the Greenback, with the single currency capped around 1.1400 and still wary about another Italy vs EU face-off on the budget, while the Loonie straddles 1.3100 after last Friday&rsquo;s NA jobs data (Canadian not as upbeat as US, largely on soft wages) and ahead of a speech by BoC Governor Poloz. Usd/Jpy has nudged further beyond 113.00 and soaked up offers/hedges vs a modest 113.25 option expiry and the Franc is back under parity within a 1.0020-55 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Regional currencies are broadly weaker vs the Usd with the Yuans undermined by less encouraging US-China trade vibes and weak Chinese PMIs, while the Try is pivoting 5.4500 in wake of Turkish inflation data showing a further rise in CPI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a fleeting uptick in Gilts on the UK services PMI miss before a retest of pre-release Liffe lows and subsequent minor loss of Fib support to 121.60 (-24 ticks vs +8 ticks at best), as the FTSE regroups alongside other EU indices, and only partly on currency effect. In truth, trade is all very choppy with Bunds also back down near worst levels traded on Eurex having climbed to 159.91 (+28 ticks) when Italian bonds lost grip of the 122.00 handle, and the 10 year Eurozone benchmarks now somewhat decoupled. However, US Treasuries remain on a modestly firmer footing and rather oblivious ahead of a big week, with mid-term election, Fed and supply risk all impending. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.3%) and Brent (-0.1%) are just off session lows with choppy trade experienced in the complex following the implementation of oil-related sanctions on Iran by the US. Iranian President emerged stating that Iran will sell oil and break sanctions, while he added that Iran is open to talks with the US once President Trump respects commitments. Temporary exemptions are being granted to eight countries making the sanctions less severe than anticipated, additionally removing the risk of a supply shortage according to FXTM strategist Hussein Sayed. Furthermore, Iranian press noted that the terms of the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) with the EU will be announced soon. The SPV is the European effort to process Iran&rsquo;s import and export payments. Diplomates said the details are being discussed by finance ministers, with EU Finance Ministers due to meet in Brussels on Tuesday, although the SPV was not on the agenda as of Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.1%) is flat and off of session highs as the yellow metal mirrors USD moves. Elsewhere, copper prices pulled back on profit taking and amid the averse risk tone.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets began the week with a negative tone after last Friday&rsquo;s losses on Wall St where the Nasdaq underperformed after tech giant Apple dropped nearly 7% on product sales and outlook disappointment, while sentiment was also dampened by soft Chinese Caixin PMI data and after US-China trade hopes were tempered by pessimism from NEC&rsquo;s Kudlow. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.5%) were both pressured from the open although stocks in Australia briefly recovered in tandem with the price swings in its largest weighted financial sector as participants mulled over Westpac&rsquo;s flat FY profits, while focus in Japan remained on corporate updates including index heavyweight Fast Retailing which slumped following a 10% decline in same-store sales. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) were negative after US administration officials downplayed prospects of an imminent resolution to the US-China trade dispute and with Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI at the weakest since September 2017 and June 2016 respectively, while the PBoC Medium-term Lending Facility announcement and President Xi&rsquo;s pledge to further open up China&rsquo;s economy only helped plug losses momentarily. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher as the risk averse tone spurred demand for safety. This helped prices recover from Friday&rsquo;s declines which coincided with a sell-off in T-notes and a surge in US yields by the most in the month following the NFP-beat.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week with a negative tone after last Friday&rsquo;s losses on Wall St where the Nasdaq underperformed after tech giant Apple dropped nearly 7% on product sales and outlook disappointment, while sentiment is also dampened by soft Chinese Caixin PMI data and after US-China trade hopes were tempered by pessimism from NEC Director Kudlow. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 both opened lower although stocks in Australia briefly recovered in tandem with the price swings in its largest weighted financial sector as participants mulled over Westpac&rsquo;s flat FY profits, while focus in Japan remained on corporate updates including index heavyweight Fast Retailing which slumped following a 10% decline in same-store sales. Elsewhere, Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp. are negative after US administration officials downplayed prospects of an imminent resolution to the US-China trade dispute and after Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI printed the weakest since September 2017 and June 2016 respectively, while the PBoC Medium-term Lending Facility announcement and President Xi&rsquo;s pledge to further open up China&rsquo;s economy only provided minimal support to the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is relatively flat and holds on to most of Friday&rsquo;s NFP-inspired rebound in which the stronger than forecast US jobs data bolstered expectations for further rate hikes from the Fed, which has contained EUR/USD below the 1.1400 handle. GBP/USD gapped higher on news UK PM May secured private concessions from Brussels that will keep Britain in a customs union and avoid a hard border, although the pair is off its highs and back below the 1.3000 handle as other reports suggested this was speculation. Elsewhere, USD/JPY trades flat despite the negative risk tone, while antipodeans are lacklustre following the disappointing Chinese trade data and with NZD also subdued by some downbeat comments regarding business confidence and potential risk to the growth outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat although prices have recovered from some of Friday&rsquo;s pressure which was in tandem with the sell-off in T-notes post NFP-beat, which saw yields surge by the most in the month and pushed the US 30yr yield to its highest since mid-2014.</p>\r\n",
