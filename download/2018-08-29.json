Throughout the session gains gradually progressed reaching record highs at 2916. However, some of the gains were pared back as the US cash equity close approached. In terms of earnings, Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) was higher after an earnings beat, as well as providing guidance higher than expectations. Dick&rsquo;s Sporting Goods (DKS) was hit after revenues and SSS came in lower than expected, however EPS was a beat; the co. also noted that it&rsquo;s Under Armour (UAA) sales saw a significant decline which weighed on UAA, as well as Foot Locker (FL). Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley raised Alphabet&rsquo;s (GOOGL) price target to $1,515 from $1,325, citing a strong core business as well as earnings potential from its Waymo autonomous driving division. The investment bank also raised its price target for Amazon (AMZN) by 35% to $2,500 implying a market value of $1.2trln and keeping its &lsquo;overweight&rsquo; rating. Roku (ROKU) were hit after reports Amazon is planning to introduce a free video service for the 48mln users who use its Fire TV streaming video devices. SPX +0.57% at 2914, NDX +1.2% at 7660, DJI +0.2% at 26125.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The complex was pretty much unchanged at settlement with yields higher by less than 1bps across the curve. Volume picked up as European traders got to their desks following reports that Italy would ask the ECB to extend the QE programme though action remained muted for the rest of the session as the 2nd GDP reading as well as weaker pending home sales had minimal impact. 2s30s and 5s30s were wider by c.2bps at settlement. US 10-year T-notes settled unchanged at 120-03.</p>\r\n",

Thurs: US PCE Price Index; US Initial Jobless Claims; German State and National CPIs; Canadian GDP; ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann to speak.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland appeared optimistic and said the latest conversation with US Trade Representative was very productive. She added details will not be discussed publicly and she highlighted there is a huge amount of work to do on specifics this week. She is expected to meet again with the Trade Representative at 5pm ET. White House CEA Chair Hassett, after he urged Canada on Tuesday to get a deal signed with the US and Mexico by Friday claiming the region may lose an opportunity, said there has &nbsp;been a lot of progress in trade talks with Canada. PM Trudeau reiterated Canada will defend its dairy supply management despite reports overnight which stated the region was reportedly going to make concessions on dairy products (dairy is one of the sticking points amid the renewed NAFTA negotiations). However, President Trump said he is optimistic that Canada will join the US &amp; Mexico trade deal and he believes the talks are on track for a Friday deadline, a view backed by his Mexican and Canadian counterparts. On the Mexican front, Economy Minister Guajardo said they have negotiated a side letter to the revamped NAFTA on autos &amp; section 232 with the US, which guarantees Mexico Duty free access under 232 tariffs until certain limits. It also grants duty free access to current production as well as new plants being constructed and room for growth. On China, WIWO reported the EU is planning a counter-initiative to China&#39;s belt and road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> A Senior Iranian Military Official stated that if foreign forces in the Strait of Hormuz do not follow international law, they will face &quot;controlling measures&quot; from Iran. This followed yesterday&rsquo;s comments from Saudi Energy Adviser who noted Iran is unable to completely, or partially, close the strait; similarly Secretary of State Pompeo claimed Iran does not control the channel. Separately, Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Khameni said Tehran should give up hope on Europe to save the nuclear deal following the withdrawal from the US, adding that Tehran will not negotiate with &quot;indecent&quot; officials in the US at any level. He then went on to note the deal is &quot;a means, not the goal&quot; and it can be abandoned if it does not serve national interests; there had been some hope that the Europeans would be able to save the JCPOA, however these latest batch of statements put question to this. Finally, US Secretary of State Pompeo reportedly asked for a meeting with Russia&#39;s Lavrov to ease tensions ahead of US sanctions which come into effect in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US GDP: </strong>The 2nd Estimate came in stronger than expected at 4.2%, consensus was for 4.0% and prior was revised higher to 4.1%. Higher fixed investment spending and net exports offset the weakness in personal consumption spending. Barclays notes that overall the latest reading does not provide much new to the Q2 growth narrative which sees spending continued to be supported by the fiscal stimulus. However they anticipate a wider trade deficit in the coming quarters on the back of trade tensions, though they see personal and government consumption supporting growth for the remainder of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PENDING HOME SALES </strong>fell in July by 0.7%, expectations were for a rise of 0.3%, reversing most of the gains seen in June. Sales saw a steep fall in the South and the West which dragged down the overall headline; the Northeast and Midwest saw activity picking up. Barclays argues &lsquo;the weak inventory situation of existing homes continues to constrain sales activity&rsquo; and add that since 80% of pending home sales will become existing home sales within two months, existing homes sales are likely to follow this trend and move sideways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU&#39;s Brexit Negotiator Barnier claimed that the UK&rsquo;s red lines are being &lsquo;scrupulously&rsquo; respected and the bloc is prepared to offer a partnership with the UK, such as has never been with any other 3rd party; the German Foreign Ministry responded to his assertions stating there will be no special rules for a post-Brexit UK. In a Brexit negotiations conference, Brexit Minister Raab appeared confident that a Brexit deal is within sight noting the aim is to reach a deal at the October council but emphasizing there is room for leeway and said he cannot be cavalier about risks of a no deal Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding a no-deal Brexit, German Finance Minister Scholz stressed it does not represent a solution as the two economies are too closely linked, echoing previous comments from French Finance Minister Le Maire who noted avoiding a hard Brexit in the UK is in the is in EU&rsquo;s interest as well as Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Coveney who does not see anyone benefitting from such an outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.57% at 2914, NDX +1.2% at 7660, DJI +024% at 26125. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +0.63%, Materials +0.74%, Industrials +0.08%, Cons Discretionary +1.12%, Cons Staples +0.10%, Healthcare +0.66%, Financials -0.02%, Tech +1.00%, Telecoms -0.75%, Utilities +0.60%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>The E mini500 flirted around the 2900 level in early trade but was boosted at the open extending above 2900. Throughout the session gains gradually progressed reaching record highs at 2916. However, some of the gains were pared back as the US cash equity close approached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) was higher after an earnings beat, as well as providing guidance higher than expectations. Dick&rsquo;s Sporting Goods (DKS) was hit after revenues and SSS came in lower than expected, however EPS was a beat; the co. also noted that it&rsquo;s Under Armour (UAA) sales saw a significant decline which weighed on UAA, as well as Foot Locker (FL).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Morgan Stanley raised Alphabet&rsquo;s (GOOGL) price target to $1,515 from $1,325, citing a strong core business as well as earnings potential from its Waymo autonomous driving division. The investment bank also raised its price target for Amazon (AMZN) by 35% to $2,500 implying a market value of $1.2trln and keeping its &lsquo;overweight&rsquo; rating. Roku (ROKU) were hit after reports Amazon is planning to introduce a free video service for the 48mln users who use its Fire TV streaming video devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI CRUDE FUTURES (V8) SETTLE 98C HIGHER AT USD 69.51/BBL; BRENT CRUDE FUTURES (V8) SETTLE USD 1.19 HIGHER AT USD 77.14/BBL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices moved higher on Wednesday supported by a larger than expected draw in DoE&rsquo;s inventories of 2.6mln (Exp. drawdown of 690k), driven by stronger demand and falling supply. The breakdown showed Distillates drawing by 0.8mln and Gasoline drawing by 1.6mln, overall contributing to a bullish reading. In news flow, SOMA reported Iraq&#39;s August crude exports will be close to 3.595mln BPD (Prev. 3.543 BDP), later confirmed by an official, SOMA also claimed Iraq can raise its oil exports, as it sees the need of more supply on the market. Prices also benefited from reports yesterday that Iran&rsquo;s oil exports are expected to drop from 2.7mln BPD in June to 1.5mln BPD in September ahead of the US sanctions. A senior Iraqi oil official has also noted OPEC should discuss how to make up for a drop in Iranian oil supply as he sees the oil market facing a big supply shortage post-Iran sanctions. Note OPEC will discuss in December if producers can compensate the supply shortage from Iran. Finally, also placing upside support for the energy complex, Executive Director Birol said to see the oil markets tightening towards end-year citing strong demand and Venezuela&#39;s falling output and unstable production including in the Middle East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10-YEAR T-NOTES SETTLED &nbsp;UNCHANGED AT 120-03:</strong> The complex was pretty much unchanged at settlement with yields higher by less than 1bps across the curve. Volume picked up as European traders got to their desks following reports that Italy would ask the ECB to extend the QE programme though action remained muted for the rest of the session as the 2nd GDP reading as well as weaker pending home sales had minimal impact. 2s30s and 5s30s were wider by c.2bps at settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 7YR NOTES AUCTION:</strong> The US sold $31bln in 7yr notes at a high yield of 2.844%, stopping through by 0.6bps. Demand was strong as the bid-to-cover came in a 2.65x, well above recent averages. Overall a solid auction with directs taking the largest share since December 2016, and dealers were left with the smallest portion since January however indirects took the smallest proportion since March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* &nbsp;DXY: </strong>An unexpected, albeit marginal upgrade to US Q2 GDP and mostly better than forecast components, have countered a couple of negative month end portfolio rebalancing models (for now at least) to prop up the index and Dollar overall, while compounding gains vs EM currencies that have fallen further in their own right. DXY holding above 94.500, just, within a 94.937-580 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>After last week&rsquo;s political turmoil and underperformance, the AUD has come under renewed pressure, but this time due to the knock-on effects for domestic consumption and RBA policy from a rise in mortgage rates at West Pac and potential for other lenders feeling the effects of a funding squeeze following suit. AUDUSD has retreated through 0.7300 and back towards recent lows, with AUDNZD under 1.0900 as the Kiwi holds up better near the 0.6700 vs its US counterpart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> A Brexit boost for the Pound with Cable back around 1.3000 and EURGBP reversing further from near 0.9100 highs on the back of EU chief negotiator Barnier claiming that the UK&rsquo;s red lines are being &lsquo;scrupulously&rsquo; respected and the bloc is ready to offer Britain a partnership arrangement no other 3rd party has. Cable now testing offers/resistance at 1.3000 having cleared 1.2950, as well as 1.3000 slightly in late trade and the cross is looking at bids/support circa 0.9000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF:</strong> Another G10 outperformer and seemingly on more short position paring rather than anything Swiss of Franc specific, with USDCHF breaking through 0.9700 and EURCHF back under 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Revisiting 1.1700 vs the USD after the headline pair recoiled towards 1.1650 and through decent option expiry interest at 1.1675 (1.4 bn) in advance of the NY cut, but largely on the coat-tails of Sterling/others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CAD: </strong>USDJPY has extended to the upside though chart resistance (111.12) and option expiry related flow (1 bn at 111.20) to test supply at 111.50, while the Loonie just slipped through 1.2950 vs its US rival on NAFTA deal prospects as latest reports suggest a lot of progress in talks between Canadian and US officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM:</strong> Little respite for the Lira and Rand, with USDTRY up towards 6.5000 after only fleeting respite via the CBRT doubling the overnight lending limit for banks, and hardly helped by downbeat date, while USDZAR has rebounded further to 14.4000 following the partial withdrawal or suspension for more consideration of the ANC land appropriation bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

In news flow, SOMA reported Iraq&#39;s August crude exports will be close to 3.595mln BPD (Prev. 3.543 BDP), later confirmed by an official, SOMA also claimed Iraq can raise its oil exports, as it sees the need of more supply on the market. Prices also benefited from reports yesterday that Iran&rsquo;s oil exports are expected to drop from 2.7mln BPD in June to 1.5mln BPD in September ahead of the US sanctions. A senior Iraqi oil official has also noted OPEC should discuss how to make up for a drop in Iranian oil supply as he sees the oil market facing a big supply shortage post-Iran sanctions. Note OPEC will discuss in December if producers can compensate the supply shortage from Iran. Finally, also placing upside support for the energy complex, Executive Director Birol said to see the oil markets tightening towards end-year citing strong demand and Venezuela&#39;s falling output and unstable production including in the Middle East.</p>\r\n",

DXY holding above 94.500, just, within a 94.937-580 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After last week&rsquo;s political turmoil and underperformance, the Aud has come under renewed pressure, but this time due to the knock-on effects for domestic consumption and RBA policy from a rise in mortgage rates at West Pac and potential for other lenders feeling the effects of a funding squeeze following suit. Aud/Usd has retreated through 0.7300 and back towards recent lows, with Aud/NZD under 1.0900 as the Kiwi holds up better near the 0.6700 vs its US counterpart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Brexit boost for the Pound with Cable back on the 1.2900 handle and Eur/Gbp reversing further from near 0.9100 highs on the back of EU chief negotiator Barnier claiming that the UK&rsquo;s red lines are being &lsquo;scrupulously&rsquo; respected and the bloc is ready to offer Britain a partnership arrangement no other 3rd party has. Cable now testing offers/resistance ahead of 1.3000 having cleared 1.2950 and the cross is looking at bids/support circa 0.9000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another G10 outperformer and seemingly on more short position paring rather than anything Swiss of Franc specific, with Usd/Chf eyeing 0.9700 and Eur/Chf back under 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revisiting 1.1700 vs the Usd after the headline pair recoiled towards 1.1650 and through decent option expiry interest at 1.1675 (1.4 bn) in advance of the NY cut, but largely on the coat-tails of Sterling/others (while Eur/Gbp remains above 0.9000 that is!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Jpy has extended to the upside though chart resistance (111.12) and option expiry related flow (1 bn at 111.20) to test supply at 111.50, while the Loonie is just maintaining keeping its head above 1.2950 vs its US rival on NAFTA deal prospects as latest reports suggest a lot of progress in talks between Canadian and US officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Little respite for the Lira and Rand, with Usd/Try up towards 6.4000 after only fleeting respite via the CBRT&nbsp;doubling the overnight lending limit for banks, and hardly helped by downbeat date, while Usd/Zar has rebounded further to 14.4000 following the partial withdrawal or suspension for more consideration of the ANC land appropriation bill.</p>\r\n",

In the 7-year secto, demand has been edging down, as measured by bid-to-cover ratios, with the last auction covered 2.49x versus the 2018 monthly average of 2.55x. &ldquo;Despite slightly weaker demand, auction performance has held up pretty well in the past few months,&rdquo; Barclays says, &ldquo;the last two auctions (July and June) have stopped at the 1pm WI levels, while the two auctions prior to that stopped through.&rdquo; Domestic investors are the largest participants at the 7-year auctions taking around 60% over the last few auctions, Barclays notes, with foreign bidders taking between 10-15% (from levels near 20% at the beginning of the year). &ldquo;The new 7y is unlikely to be the cheapest-to-deliver in 10-year (Dec&rsquo;18) future, assuming a 2.75% coupon and current yield levels,&rdquo; Barclays says, &ldquo;However, if yields rise heading into the auction, the issue could price at a 2.875% coupon and become the new cheapest-to-deliver.</p>\r\n",

However, a wider than forecast advance trade balance for July could adversely impact, while at least one month end rebalancing model indicates a strong Usd sell signal.

Meanwhile, the Loonie has lost some of its initial NAFTA momentum to slip back below 1.2900 against its US peer, even though reports suggest that Canada may we willing to offer dairy concessions.

DXY currently nearer the upper end of a 94.890-685 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency remains capped below 1.1700 vs the Greenback having relinquished big figure-plus status yesterday amidst offers between 1.1725-30 and with decent option expiry interest at the 1.1675 strike (1.4 bn) weighing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another G10 underperformer and on follow-through selling in wake of Tuesday&rsquo;s dire Swedish retail sales data that could be acknowledged by the Riksbank next week in some shape or form, ie policy guidance and/or through the rate path.

Meanwhile, the Loonie has lost some of its initial NAFTA momentum to slip back below 1.2900 against its US peer, even though reports suggest that Canada may we willing to offer dairy concessions. Usd/Jpy remains just over the 111.00 level and also close to option expiry interest (1 bn at 111.20), with the 55 DMA at 111.05 being eyed as pivotal from a technical perspective. The Kiwi is keeping tabs on 0.6700 and Franc holds the bulk of its recent gains within 0.9775-60 parameters, largely ignoring a sharp deterioration in Swiss ZEW investor sentiment, or rather heeding the bleak news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira and Rand continue to bear the brunt of the currency run and capital flight for all the well know reasons, with Usd/Try up towards 6.4000 after only fleeting respite via the CBRT doubling the overnight lending limit for banks, while Usd/Zar has rebounded further to 14.4000 following the partial withdrawal or suspension for more consideration of the ANC land appropriation bill.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remain-supporting Conservatives have reported an noticeable increase in applications to join their local parties, leading to fears that they are being targeted by Ukip supporters in a plot to unseat them and elect a Brexit-supporting PM to replace May. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Coveney said chances of a no deal Brexit are very slim as no one would benefit and that it is possible to get a deal on Brexit well before the year-end, while Coveney added that talks of surviving a no deal Brexit is more of a negotiation tactic than a reality.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were higher on safe-haven outflows amid strength in Tokyo stock markets, while CAD was underpinned by trade hopes on reports that Canada was said to be prepared to make concessions on dairy for NAFTA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were lacklustre overnight in which WTI crude futures consolidated after the prior day&rsquo;s decline which was triggered by a rebound in the greenback and surprise miniscule build in API inventories.

Furthermore, the minutes noted that Kansas City (George) and Cleveland (Mester) urged raising discount rate by 0.25% due to the continued solid economic growth outlook, tight labour markets and inflation remaining near 2%, but the remaining 10 wanted to maintain as they felt it was appropriate during the current economic conditions.

(Globe and Mail/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said the US is asking Canada to consider joining the US-Mexico trade deal but also noted that Canada has made troubles in drugs and biologics for US firms, while he also stated that the US is not accusing Mexico of currency manipulation as the MXN has been falling which impacts US trade deficit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian PM Trudeau said his position on supply hasn&#39;t changed but looks forward to a NAFTA deal if it is good for Canada, while he added there has been progress on autos and Canada is studying the US-Mexico terms of the deal. Elsewhere, Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said we are encouraged by progress between US and Mexico in which progress on autos and labor were particularly helpful, while Freeland later stated they had a very constructive meeting with US Trade Representative Lighthizer and will return on Wednesday to resume discussions.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed following the unconvincing performance on Wall St where the majors somewhat flatlined in which the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Comp. just about eked fresh record highs. ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) are positive with Australia led higher by resilience in financials and as earnings dominates news flow, while the Japanese benchmark is supported by mild JPY weakness to reclaim the 22900 level. Conversely, Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) is negative and Hang Seng (+0.2%) trades indecisive following continued PBoC liquidity inaction and amid a slew of earnings including 3 of China&rsquo;s big 4 banks which all posted growth in profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets have mostly been muted amid a lack of data points although the greenback marginally extended on its rebound which recently dragged EUR/USD below the 1.1700 handle, while GBP/USD languishes at the prior day&rsquo;s lows. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are higher on safe-haven outflows amid outperformance of Tokyo stock markets, while CAD was underpinned by trade hopes on reports that Canada was said to be prepared to make concessions on dairy for NAFTA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid the heightened risk appetite in Japan and following a relatively paltry Rinban announcement by the BoJ.</p>\r\n",
