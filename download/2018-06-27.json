The 30-year yield dropped beneath 3% again, and 10-year yields are a couple of basis points above 2.80%. The result was 2s10s flattening to the lowest level since 2007. Some suggested that Treasury were moving in sympathy with Bunds in the pre-market, with German debt in demand after the row between the German government coalition over immigration.

        "content": "<p>The RBNZ are to decide on rates in which the central bank is expected to keep policy unchanged with all economists surveyed unanimously forecasting the OCR to be maintained at 1.75% where it has been since November 2016. Furthermore, the central bank is also seen to hold off from any policy tweaks in the near term as most banks are not anticipating a 25bps increase until next year at the earliest and with several also recently pushing back forecasts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The widespread consensus for the RBNZ to remain on hold for the time being was solidified at the last meeting which was the first under RBNZ Governor Orr&#39;s stewardship, as the central bank stated it expects to maintain the OCR at this expansionary level for a considerable time and that the current level is best to maximize sustainable employment and stable inflation. The central bank also kept all future options on the table as it stated the next direction in rates is equally a hike or cut, while it noted low food and import price inflation, as well as subdued wages for why inflation was soft.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the prior meeting, several financial institutions adjusted their forecasts for a rate hike in response to the RBNZ&#39;s rhetoric including BNZ which now call for a rate hike in May 2019 from Prev. forecast of February 2019 and Kiwibank which pushed back their hike expectations to August 2019 from May 2019. In addition, ANZ Bank also adjusted its RBNZ rate hike forecast to November 2019 from August 2019 and TD Securities now sees higher rates in February 2019 vs. Prev. forecast of November 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent growth data has also been somewhat inconclusive and therefore favours a wait and see approach with New Zealand GDP for Q1 inline with estimates in terms of both Q/Q at 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.6%) and Y/Y at 2.7% vs. Exp. 2.7% (Prev. 2.9%). Conversely, Annual Average GDP (Q1) 2.7% vs. Exp. 2.8% (Prev. 2.9%, Rev. 2.8%) slightly missed but this isn&rsquo;t likely to be a concern nor impact the outlook by the government which had previously raised GDP guidance to 3.8% from 3.4% for 2018/19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate decision is due&nbsp;Wednesday&nbsp;at 2200BST/1600CDT and as maintaining rates at current levels is widely seen as a forgone conclusion, focus will be on the tone of the statement such as on growth and inflation, as well as whether the central bank continues to suggest that both a future cut or hike are equally feasible.</p>\r\n",

The move came ahead of the 6 July date where the US will impose USD 34bln on Chinese imports (Trump has also threatened a further USD 400bln of tariffs on Chinese goods). US NEC Chair Kudlow rejected claims that it was a softer approach, and US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin reiterated that it does not solely target China. However, the implication is that the new measures will allow the US to target joint-ventures between China and US firms, that China may use as a proxy to invest in US companies to attempt to gain access to sensitive technologies (previously, acquisitions were subject to CFIUS oversight, but the US had less powers in targeting joint ventures). Ahead of the EU Summit, beginning on Thursday, EU leaders will discuss a reaction to US auto tariffs after US President Trump last week threated to apply a 20% tariff on all European cars entering the US if the EU did not &lsquo;break down and remove&rsquo; its tariffs on US autos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED SPEAK:</strong> FOMC&rsquo;s Quarles largely stayed away from monetary policy, since his speech was on financial stability. Quarles did say, however, that the economic outlook had not yet been impacted by trade. Fed&rsquo;s Rosengren (non-voter) warned against running US economy above capacity, and repeated calls to use an inflation range metric, rather than just a specific number. Rosengren argued that a gradual path of interest rate rises lowers the risk of a serious policy mistake, on wages says they have not yet risen rapidly. Meanwhile, the Fed&rsquo;s arch-dove Bullard (non-voter) once again expressed caution in raising rates too quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US DURABLE GOODS:</strong> Although durable goods slipped in May, the headline was slightly better than analysts had forecast (-0.6% versus exp -0.9%). Capital Economics notes that business equipment investment growth rates in Q2 are running at around 5%, slower than the pace of growth in H2 2017. While the headline was hit by the volatile transport component, core orders also declined, and non-defence capital goods shipments were at a 17-month low. &ldquo;Even if equipment investment growth does remain subdued, a resurgence in consumption growth means that overall second-quarter GDP growth is still on course to have risen by at least 4% annualised,&rdquo; Capital Economics said, &ldquo;and with capacity constraints starting to bite and most surveys of new orders still at a fairly healthy level, there is a good chance that firms will step up their capital spending again over the months ahead.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US ADVANCED GOODS TRADE BALANCE:</strong> The advanced goods trade deficit narrowed in May to -64.8bln from -67.3bln. Capital goods and consumer goods exports showed notable strength, and exports of foods, feeds and beverages were also firm. Barclays boosted its Q2 GDP tracker by 1.2ppts to 4.7% following the data; Goldman Sachs raised its Q2 GDP estimate to 4.1% from 3.9% following the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC SPEAK:</strong> Governor Poloz said the impact of tariffs will feature in the July meeting, and the BOC is working to incorporate the impact of steel and aluminium tariffs in its projections. Poloz argued that the BOC cannot follow mechanical models on rates too strictly given there is uncertainty, and reiterated a data-dependent stance. He said that the impact of business investment uncertainty is due to trade, and that he is also uncertain about the exact degree of sensitivity the economy has to rate hikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.9% at 2699, NASDAQ COMP -1.4% at 6970, DJI -0.7% at 24116. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -0.26%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -1.28%, Energy: +1.34%, Financials: -1.26%, Health Care: -0.92%, Industrials: -0.78%, Materials: -0.36%, Telecoms: +0.05%, Tech: -1.45%, Utilities: +0.59%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITY FUTURES: </strong>US equity futures were boosted as US president Trump is going to take a softer approach to the restrictions on Chinese investments. Resistance was seen at 2750 on the Emini S&amp;P; in late trade there was technical selling after the ES breached its 50dma at 2721, and then through the 100dma at 2708, to end the cash day at the LOD just above 2700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> WWE (WWE) secured a multiyear media rights with Comcast&rsquo;s (CMCSA) USA Network and Fox Sports (FOXA) for the distribution of Raw and SmackDown programmes. Furthermore, Activist Investor Nelson Peltz announced he was supportive of the reshuffle in General Electric (GE) where the stock carried on its gains from yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Conagra (CAG) beat on both the top and bottom line, and forecast sales growth between 2% and 2.5%, and forecasts its Q1 net adjusted EPS between the range of $0.46 and $0.49. General Mills (GIS), who were previously a touted potential bidder for Pinnacle Foods (PF), beat on revenues but sales fell slightly short. Paychex (PAYX) beat slightly on both EPS &amp; revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A:</strong> Conagra Brands (CAG) confirmed yesterday&rsquo;s source reports that they are to acquire Pinnacle Foods (PF) in a deal worth USD 10.9bln including debt. Elsewhere, Comcast (CMCSA) is reportedly considering a tie up with some PE firms or strategic partners in the pursuit for Fox&rsquo;s (FOXA) assets. It was then reported that Comcast (CMCSA) will still make an offer for the assets, even though the deal with Disney (DIS) received anti-trust approval, but only if Disney divests 22 regional sports networks. CVS (CVS) reportedly announced that they expect to receive unconditional anti-trust approval from the US DoJ for the deal with Aetna (AET).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) 12+ TICKS HIGHER AT 120-12+.</strong> Despite the Trump Administration announcing trade measures that are not extreme as some had feared, Treasury yields were lower across the curve, with &lsquo;growth concerns&rsquo; being cited. The 30-year yield dropped beneath 3% again, and 10-year yields are a couple of basis points above 2.80%. The result was 2s10s flattening to the lowest level since 2007. Some suggested that Treasury were moving in sympathy with Bunds in the pre-market, with German debt in demand after the row between the German government coalition over immigration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 5-YEAR AUCTION REVIEW:</strong> An average sale of 5-year paper tailed by 0.4bps, in line with recent averages, though cover was above the six-auction average. Dealer takedown was slightly below the six-auction average (at 28.5% versus 29.4%), direct participation at 9.5% was just under a percentage point beneath the six-auction average, leading dealers to take 62% versus the six-auction average of 60.2%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 7-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>The US Treasury will this week auction USD 116bln in supply this week (USD 34bln of new 2s on Tuesday, USD 36bln of new 5s on Wednesday, USD 30bln in new 7s on Thursday, as well as USD 16bln of 2-year FRN on Wednesday). TD Securities notes that with USD 64.3bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is implied at USD 51.7bln. The bank also expected the Treasury to announce a further increase in auction sizes in the coming months, continuing to cheapen front-end Treasuries vs OIS. Analysts at Societe Generale say the 7-year sector will need concession heading into the auction, since it does not seem to be set up on a relative value basis, with the current 7 trading rich versus 5s and 10s. SocGen also notes that benchmark 7s current trade beneath the previous two stop-out rates. However, the bank does note that demand at 7s auctions has been strong; the auction may also benefit from quarter-end flows, as well as any risk-off as a result of trade wars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Q8) SETTLES $2.23 HIGHER AT $72.76/BBL; BRENT (Q8) SETTLES $1.31 HIGHER AT $77.62/BBL</strong>. A combination of concerns regarding production outages (Syncrude in Canada, the fall in Kazakh output, as well as feared declines in Iranian exports) followed by a bullish inventory report (see below) pushed crude higher on Wednesday. Clearly, concerns about Russian output climbing above 11mln BPD, and the ramping up of Saudi output to record levels is being offset by the concerns of outages, and Trump urging Iranian crude customers to stop dealing with the country. The exact extent of how much Iranian crude will be impacted remains to be seen. However, Iran exported 2.2mln BPD in 2017, and UBS estimates that 1.2mln of that went to &ldquo;US allies&rdquo;. If the Saudis raise production from around 10mln towards 10.8-11mln BPD (depending on which report you read), that still does not completely offset the potential gap in Iranian supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* INVENTORIES: </strong>In line with the API data released on Tuesday, the DOE reported that US crude stocks had drawn by -9.891mln barrels (expected -2.572mln), with crude production unchanged for a second week at 10.90mln BPD. Crude exports rose by 326k BPD to a record 3mln BPD. Stocks at Cushing drew down by 2.713mln (expected -2.25mln), distillates saw a small build of 0.015mln (expected +0.774mln), and gasoline stocks built by slightly less than expected at +1.156mln (expected +1.313mln).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The Dollar Index retakes the 95.00 handle amid broad-based USD strength (HOD 95.381). Softer restrictions on Chinese investment in US companies was cited as the main reason the buck strengthened on Wednesday, largely seeing an unwind of the haven bid, helping to stem demand for JPY and CHF, as well as XAU, that latter touching the 1251 area. The EMFX complex was also pummelled on the USD strength, with MXN rising to 20.21, ZAR rising as high as 13.93</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD:</strong> USDCAD was hovering above 1.33 prior to comments from the BOC governor Poloz, and the Loonie hit HOD around 1.3385 in wake of Poloz&rsquo; cautious comments, where he took time to note the uncertainties facing the Canadian economy ahead of the July MPR meeting. Pricing for a rate hike declined to beneath 50% implied probability of a hike in the aftermath of his comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> Ahead of this evening&rsquo;s RBNZ rate announcement, the antipodeans were moving in sync with the dollar moves, and subsequently, the AUD fell to as low as 0.7325 amid the buck strength, and the NZD was slammed, heading into the RBNZ sub-0.68. (RBNZ not expected to budge, preview below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> The Dollar&rsquo;s rebound weighed on Sterling, which is on course for its largest drop in more than a fortnight, though the 1.31 handle seems to have held. No notable progress is expected from the EU Summit starting Thursday, and the UK will release its highly anticipated white paper on its desired relationship with the EU in July, after the Summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP</strong> - RBNZ: The RBNZ will publish its rate decision on rates on Wednesday (Thursday morning in NZ) at 2200 BST/1700 EDT, and is expected to keep rates unchanged at 1.75%, according to all economists surveyed by Reuters. The central bank is also likely to hold-off from any policy tweaks in the near-term, and most analysts do not anticipate any hikes until next year, at the earliest, with some recently pushing further back their estimates. The main focus will be on the tone of the statement &ndash; particularly regarding growth and inflation &ndash; as well as the Bank&rsquo;s guidance on rates, specifically, whether it continues to see both a future rate cut or rate hike as equally feasible. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19487/download\">Click here to read full preview.</a></p>\r\n",

The exact extent of how much Iranian crude will be impacted remains to be seen. However, Iran exported 2.2mln BPD in 2017, and UBS estimates that 1.2mln of that went to &ldquo;US allies&rdquo;. If the Saudis raise production from around 10mln towards 10.8-11mln BPD (depending on which report you read), that still does not completely offset the potential gap in Iranian supply.</li>\r\n  <li>In line with the API data released on Tuesday, the DOE reported that US crude stocks had drawn by -9.891mln barrels (expected -2.572mln), with crude production unchanged for a second week at 10.90mln BPD. Crude exports rose by 326k BPD to a record 3mln BPD. Stocks at Cushing drew down by 2.713mln (expected -2.25mln), distillates saw a small build of 0.015mln (expected +0.774mln), and gasoline stocks built by slightly less than expected at +1.156mln (expected +1.313mln).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>FX markets kicked the session off on a relatively cautious footing with most majors initially confined to a relatively tight trading range as markets paused for breath after US President Trump took a slightly more conciliatory tone yesterday by suggesting he would ease off on demands for new tight restrictions regarding Chinese investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the European session progressed the USD continued to garner further support from upbeat comments from US Defense Secretary Mattis who claimed President Xi talks have been &quot;very, very&quot; good. Thereafter, the USD extended gains (even against the initially firm JPY) with USD/JPY reclaiming 110.00 to the upside after the US Treasury Dept. recommended a modernized CFIUS as the best approach to protect US tech from &quot;strategically motivated acquisitions&quot;, as according to a senior administration official. This was seen as a &quot;watered down&quot; version of the approaches suggested earlier in the week by Trump to address the protection of this sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD move then reverberated across the market and weighted on some of the Greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts, notably the EUR with EUR/USD taking out weekly lows and psychological support at 1.1600 (briefly) ahead of the NY cut which saw a slew of large option expiries (1.6bln in at 1.1650, 3.3bln at 1.1625 and 2.4bln at 1.1600).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP also fell victim to the firmer USD with GBP/USD extending losses below 1.3200 in what was a largely USD driven move (GBP stable against EUR for a bulk of the session). Focus for the GBP going forward will likely shift towards Brexit-related rhetoric ahead of the EU leaders summit; expectations for any meaningful progress in talks is modest given the relatively small amount of time dedicated to Brexit negotiations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the data front, US durables painted a mixed picture with a less-bad-than-expected headline (-0.6% vs. Exp. -0.9%) offset by some softer components. Elsewhere, US Advanced Goods Trade Balance printed a smaller deficit than Exp. (-64.85bln vs. Exp. -68.9bln) and marked a 3.7% decline in the deficit from May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNY remains a focus for the market after the PBoC set the CNY mid-point fix at its softest level since 25th December last year with USD/CNY back below 6.6000 as the recent move to the downside continues to gather momentum. From a policy perspective, Chinese think tank CASS researcher Zhang says the PBoC want an overall weaker CNY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD started the European session on the back-foot after NZD/JPY tripped through stops overnight through 75.00 to the downside with sentiment also soured by disappointing New Zealand Business indicators. Focus now turns to the RBNZ rate decision tonight with the central bank is expected to maintain the OCR at 1.75% with most banks not anticipating a 25bps increase until next year at the earliest.</p>\r\n",

The move came ahead of the 6 July date where the US will impose USD 34bln on Chinese imports (Trump has also threatened a further USD 400bln of tariffs on Chinese goods). US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin rejected claims that it was a softer approach, and said it does not solely target China. However, the implication is that the new measures will allow the US to target joint-ventures between China and US firms, that China may use as a proxy to invest in US companies to gain access to sensitive technologies (previously, acquisitions were subject to CFIUS oversight, but the US had less powers in targeting joint ventures).</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (flat) was choppy as the initial gains led by the energy sector were briefly eclipsed by weakness in telecoms and financials, while Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) exporter names were dampened by currency strength. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%) were also subdued amid the current backdrop of trade concerns and after a net liquidity drain by the PBoC which saw the mainland index extend on its descent through bear market territory. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat with only minimal support seen from the risk-averse tone in Japan and the BoJ&rsquo;s presence for JPY 810bln of JGBs across the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese President Xi is said to have warned leaders to be prepared in the event of a full-scale trade war with US during a 2-day meeting, according to a note from SGH Macro Advisors that also suggested the PBoC will refrain from buying US Treasuries and seek to lower them.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German SPD Leader Nahles doesn&#39;t know if they are preparing for fresh German elections and have to wait, adding it is unsatisfactory that there is a standstill coalition on migrant policy this week. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond said he hopes the UK can seize the unlimited opportunities from China&#39;s Belt &amp; Road initiative, while he added that as the UK and EU build new relationships, the UK will deepen its ties with the rest of the world. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said retaliatory tariffs demonstrate trading hypocrisy and that there is no credible basis for EU legal theory regarding tariffs, while he added the US will take all necessary actions to protect its interests. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House voted 400 vs. 2 in favour of passing bill to tighten oversight of US foreign investment due to concern over China. In related news, US President Trump suggested he would back down from his demand for new tight restrictions on Chinese investments into technology and instead rely on other channels already in place such as CFIUS.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAFTA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada Finance Minister Morneau said Canada will support tariff-affected industries and will provide details on NAFTA tariff support shortly. In other news, Canada is said to be preparing steel quotas and tariffs on China and other nations to stop producers there from dumping goods which cannot be sold to the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexican presidential front-runner Lopez Obrador&rsquo;s NAFTA negotiator hopes for a NAFTA deal in the coming months and agrees with current approach. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equity bourses were initially negative across the board as trade concerns hit European markets following US congressional approval of increased US-Chinese investment scrutinization. There was a turnaround, however, into positive territory with the DAX currently the outperforming bourse, after hitting 2 month lows, on the back of US Defence Secretary Mattis striking a positive tone after talks with Chinese President Xi. Most bourses are still below their 100DMA, however, and have not been able to eliminate the losses seen throughout the week, with the DAX at 12,210 vs. its 50DMA of 12,761, the FTSE 100 at 7,534 vs its 50DMA of 7,616 and the CAC at 5,268 vs. its 50DMA of 5,473.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial sector (-0.4%) is currently underperforming as falling treasury yields are weighing on the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a cagey start to European trade in FX markets with most majors sticking to their recent ranges. Subsequently, the USD trades relatively unchanged thus far with the DXY sitting just above 94.50 as markets pause for breath after US President Trump took a slightly more conciliatory tone yesterday by suggesting he would ease off on demands for new tight restrictions regarding Chinese investments. That said, despite these comments from Trump, they are unlikely to signal a U-turn in US trade policy and the threat of an escalation in trade tensions remains at the forefront of investor sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a Chinese perspective, preparations are said to be made by leaders of the communist regime to help protect the nation&rsquo;s economy in the event of a trade war with the US. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the PBoC set the CNY mid-point fix at its softest level since 25th December last year with USD/CNY back below 6.6000 as the recent move to the downside continues to gather momentum; scepticism remains as to whether this is actually a targeted policy measure by China and how fair they would be willing to tolerate the move given the risk of capital outflows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, not too much to report for EUR as focus on the most recent ECB policy announcements and communications somewhat abates Subsequently, in the absence of any major USD traction at this stage of the session, option activity could dictate performance for the pair with 1.6bln in expiries at 1.1650, 3.3bln at 1.1625 and 2.4bln at 1.1600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP is also relatively contained with GBP/USD hovering around 1.3200 after yesterday&rsquo;s selling which was partially brought about by comments from prospective MPC member Haskel who failed to strike an overtly hawkish tone and thus didn&rsquo;t provide markets with much evidence that he could replace the vote of his predecessor, McCafferty. Attention throughout the week will likely begin to shift away from the BoE towards Brexit as the EU leaders summit nears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, USD/JPY maintains overnight losses seen in the wake of the Tokyo fix on the cautious risk tone to break below the 110.00 handle, while AUD/JPY and NZD/JPY tripped through stops at the prior session&rsquo;s lows and the 81.00 and 75.00 levels respectively. JPY has given back some ground against major peers alongside the recent move in equity markets. Pressure on antipodeans was also due to China exposure for AUD after the PBoC set its weakest reference rate since December 25th and following disappointing New Zealand Business indicators; next up the RBNZ for NZD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad risk aversion in the market initially lent a helping hand to the fixed income complex with Bunds reclaiming 162.50 after running out of steam around Monday&rsquo;s highs of 162.57 with volumes relatively light. In-fitting with the recent market moves, fixed income products also fell victim to the turnaround in sentiment with paper relatively unchanged for the session. Gilts are also kept pace with the general trend of the market with this morning&rsquo;s FPC release unable to provide any further direction the UK 10yr with the statement judging that, apart from those related to Brexit, domestic risks remain standard overall. Brexit-related rhetoric will likely now ramp up with an ongoing lack of cabinet unanimity ahead of the EU summit. On the data front, both M/M and Y/Y metrics for the Nationwide House Price Index exceeded expectations for the month of June. Elsewhere, BTPs reluctantly joined the party albeit after a relatively indecisive start with traders mindful of tomorrow&rsquo;s BTP auction and whether recent political developments have soured investor sentiment. N.b. month-end flows are likely to come into vogue over the coming days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is up ~0.8% on the day and around the month-long high levels seen post Tuesday afternoon&rsquo;s rally after reports the US was pressing its allies to halt all oil imports from the nation by November. Further, API inventory report showed the largest drawdown to crude stockpiles since September 2016, although the impact was relatively contained on slight fatigue considering WTI had already rallied over 3% prior to the release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is uneventful at its lowest levels since December 2017 as the overnight weakening has abated slightly. Copper has hit 12 week lows as trade concerns have hit the building material at USD 6,679/tonne, alongside ongoing supply concerns from Chile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude stocks (22 Jun): -9.22 mln (Exp. -2.6 mln, Prev. -3.016 mln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>API Cushing stocks (22 June): -1.74 mln (Exp. -2.2 mln Prev. -1.594 mln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>API Distillates (22 June): +1.785 mln (Exp. +0.8 mln, Prev. +0.75 mln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>API Gasoline (22 June): +1.152 mln (Exp. +1.3 mln, Prev. +2.113 mln)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/19488/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equity bourses are negative across the board (Stoxx 600 -0.6%) as trade concerns hit European markets following US congressional approval of increased US-Chinese investment scrutinization. FTSE 100 is currently the outperforming bourse, supported by outperforming energy names lifted by higher oil prices, but is still negative on the day and languishing around month long lows of 7515. The DAX and CAC are also both hovering around 2 month lows and well below their 50DMA&rsquo;s of 12,759 and 4473 respectively as trade concerns pressure the indices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial sector (-1.1%) is currently underperforming as falling treasury yields are weighing on the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elior (-8.00%) is extending the fall seen on Tuesday and is leading the losses in the Stoxx 600</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sainsbury&rsquo;s (+1.9%) is up on the back of a broker upgrade at Barclays to overweight from equal weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been a cagey start to European trade in FX markets with most majors sticking to their recent ranges. Subsequently, the USD trades relatively unchanged thus far with the DXY sitting just above 94.50 as markets pause for breath after US President Trump took a slightly more conciliatory tone yesterday by suggesting he would ease off on demands for new tight restrictions regarding Chinese investments. That said, despite these comments from Trump, they are unlikely to signal a U-turn in US trade policy and the threat of an escalation in trade tensions remains at the forefront of investor sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a Chinese perspective, preparations are said to be made by leaders of the communist regime to help protect the nation&rsquo;s economy in the event of a trade war with the US. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the PBoC set the CNY mid-point fix at its softest level since 25th December last year with USD/CNY back below 6.6000 as the recent move to the downside continues to gather momentum; scepticism remains as to whether this is actually a targeted policy measure by China and how fair they would be willing to tolerate the move given the risk of capital outflows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, not too much to report for EUR as focus on the most recent ECB policy announcements and communications somewhat abates Subsequently, in the absence of any major USD traction at this stage of the session, option activity could dictate performance for the pair with 1.6bln in expiries at 1.1650, 3.3bln at 1.1625 and 2.4bln at 1.1600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP is also relatively contained with GBP/USD hovering around 1.3200 after yesterday&rsquo;s selling which was partially brought about by comments from prospective MPC member Haskel who failed to strike an overtly hawkish tone and thus didn&rsquo;t provide markets with much evidence that he could replace the vote of his predecessor, McCafferty. Attention throughout the week will likely begin to shift away from the BoE towards Brexit as the EU leaders summit nears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, USD/JPY maintains overnight losses seen in the wake of the Tokyo fix on the cautious risk tone to break below the 110.00 handle, while AUD/JPY and NZD/JPY tripped through stops at the prior session&rsquo;s lows and the 81.00 and 75.00 levels respectively. The pressure on antipodeans was also due to China exposure for AUD after the PBoC set its weakest reference rate since December 25th and following disappointing New Zealand Business indicators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad risk aversion in the market has lent a helping hand to the fixed income complex with Bunds back briefly back above 162.50 after running out of steam around Monday&rsquo;s highs of 162.57 with volumes relatively light at this stage of the session. Gilts are also keeping pace with the general trend of the market with the BoE due to remain in vogue ahead of the latest FPC release before Brexit-related rhetoric is due to ramp up with an ongoing lack of cabinet unanimity ahead of the EU summit. On the data front, both M/M and Y/Y metrics for the Nationwide House Price Index exceeded expectations for the month of June. Elsewhere, BTPs have reluctantly joined the party albeit after a relatively indecisive start with traders mindful of tomorrow&rsquo;s BTP auction and whether recent political developments have soured investor sentiment. N.b. month-end flows are likely to come into vogue over the coming days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is up ~0.8% on the day and around the month-long high levelss seen post Tuesday afternoon&rsquo;s rally after reports the US was pressing its allies to halt all oil imports from the nation by November. Further, API inventory report showed the largest drawdown to crude stockpiles since September 2016, although the impact was relatively contained on slight fatigue considering WTI had already rallied over 3% prior to the release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is uneventful at its lowest levels since December 2017 as the overnight weakening has abated slightly. Copper has hit 12 week lows as trade concerns have hit the building material at USD 6,679/tonne, alongside ongoing supply concerns from Chile.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>It&rsquo;s been a cagey start to European trade in FX markets with most majors sticking to their recent ranges. Subsequently, the USD trades relatively unchanged thus far with the DXY sitting just above 94.50 as markets pause for breath after US President Trump took a slightly more conciliatory tone yesterday by suggesting he would ease off on demands for new tight restrictions regarding Chinese investments. That said, despite these comments from Trump, they are unlikely to signal a U-turn in US trade policy and the threat of an escalation in trade tensions remains at the forefront of investor sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a Chinese perspective, preparations are said to be made by leaders of the communist regime to help protect the nation&rsquo;s economy in the event of a trade war with the US. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the PBoC set the CNY mid-point fix at its softest level since 25th December last year with USD/CNY back below 6.6000 as the recent move to the downside continues to gather momentum; scepticism remains as to whether this is actually a targeted policy measure by China and how fair they would be willing to tolerate the move given the risk of capital outflows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, not too much to report for EUR as focus on the most recent ECB policy announcements and communications somewhat abates Subsequently, in the absence of any major USD traction at this stage of the session, option activity could dictate performance for the pair with 1.6bln in expiries at 1.1650, 3.3bln at 1.1625 and 2.4bln at 1.1600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP is also relatively contained with GBP/USD hovering around 1.3200 after yesterday&rsquo;s selling which was partially brought about by comments from prospective MPC member Haskel who failed to strike an overtly hawkish tone and thus didn&rsquo;t provide markets with much evidence that he could replace the vote of his predecessor, McCafferty. Attention throughout the week will likely begin to shift away from the BoE towards Brexit as the EU leaders summit nears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, USD/JPY maintains overnight losses seen in the wake of the Tokyo fix on the cautious risk tone to break below the 110.00 handle, while AUD/JPY and NZD/JPY tripped through stops at the prior session&rsquo;s lows and the 81.00 and 75.00 levels respectively. The pressure on antipodeans was also due to China exposure for AUD after the PBoC set its weakest reference rate since December 25th and following disappointing New Zealand Business indicators.</p>\r\n",
