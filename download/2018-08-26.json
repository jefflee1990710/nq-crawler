Elsewhere, reports noted that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was detained in Moscow. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell (neutral) stated that further interest rate hikes are likely appropriate if strong income and job growth continue, while he also stated that gradual rate hikes navigate risks of going too slowly vs. too fast and noted no clear signs of inflation accelerating above 2%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Mester (voter, hawk) said Q3 has come in strong so far and that gradual hikes seems appropriate, while she also stated the case for raising interest rates is &quot;pretty compelling&quot;.

On the flip side, Foot Locker Inc (FL) edged lower; although earnings beat expectations, SSS missed coming in at +0.5% vs Exp. +0.7%; other retailers also lagged behind with names like Gap (GPS), Macy&rsquo;s (M) and Kroger (KR) all down on the day. Netflix (NFLX) surged more than 4% after an upgrade at Suntrust and similarly Mylan (MYL) posted gains following an upgrade Evercore. Philip Morris (PM) however dipped lower on a downgrade at Jefferies. Papa John&rsquo;s (PZZA) spiked higher following reports it had attained Bank of America (BAC) and Lazard (LAZ) as financial advisors. In M&amp;A Enbridge (ENB) announced it is to acquire all of Spectra Energy Partners&rsquo; (SEP) public equity for USD 3.3bln transaction. Elsewhere, China Biologic (CBPO) dropped significantly when CITIC Capital MB Investment Limited withdrew its preliminary acquisition proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was decent volume in the Treasury complex, as Jackson Hole got underway. Powell&rsquo;s comments were judged to be on the dovish side, which helped 10s catch a bid; Informa reported that traders priced in a pause after two more hikes, and then the real money bid came back forcing poorly placed shorts to cover. Unsurprisingly, curves continued to flatten with 2s10s and 2s30s finding their customary cyclical narrows. US 10-year T-notes settled 2+ tick lower at 120-16+.</p>\r\n",
