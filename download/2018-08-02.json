Furthermore, the previously released Summary of Opinions from the June meeting stated it is appropriate to pursue powerful monetary easing with persistence under the current guideline as inflation a long way to price target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s release is not expected to impact markets given that the decision itself and Summary of Opinions was met with a muted reaction, while there has also been a more recent earlier this week, in which the BoJ kept the bank rate at -0.1% and the long-term yield target at around 0.0% but announced more flexibility and adopted forward guidance on rates which it says will be maintained at very low levels for extended period.</p>\r\n",

Mofcom also commented China has fully prepared for US threats on escalating trade war and are to &#39;properly handle&#39; trade disputes with the US, as well as take every effort to stabilize trade.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE August Meeting Summary: BoE voted 9-0 to lift rates by 25bps from 0.50% to 0.75%. (Newswires)<br />Vote split on corporate bonds: 9-0 in favour of maintaining the current stock of corporate bonds<br />Vote split on APF: 9-0 in favour of maintaining the current stock of UK government bond purchases<br />BoE stated that since the May QIR, the near-term outlook has evolved broadly in-line with the MPC&rsquo;s expectations and recent data appears to confirm that the dip in output in Q1 was temporary with momentum recovering Q2.<br />BoE also commented that were the economy to develop broadly inline with the August QIR projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be warranted but added any future rate rises are likely to be gradual and to a limited extent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE QIR Forecasts:<br />GDP Growth: 2018 Q3: 1.5% (Prev.1.4%), 2019 Q3: 1.8% (Prev. 1.7%), 2020 Q3: 1.7% (Prev. 1.7%), 2021 Q3: 1.7%<br />CPI Inflation: 2018 Q3: 2.5% (Prev. 2.4%), 2019 Q3: 2.2% (Prev. 2.1%), 2020 Q3: 2.1% (Prev. 2.0%), 2021 Q3: 2.0%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Governor Carney said that one rate hike a year for the next few years will more or less get inflation back to the 2% target over the horizon. Carney also stated there is a wide range of outcomes for Brexit, in many of them, rates will be at least as high as now, but later added the BoE is prepared to cut interest rates back again depending upon how Brexit negotiations go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP initially rose on the decision and the unanimous vote to hike rates, although sellers then emerged during the press conference with Governor Carney. There have been a number of narratives offered for the selling, with the Bank stressing that any future rate rises are likely to be gradual and limited (as it has suggested previously), and the current market rate path is flatter than it was in May, implying a rate of 0.9% in one-year (ie. another hike by then), 1.0% in two-years and 1.1% in three-years. Perhaps it was due to Carney once again flagging up Brexit risks suggesting that there is a wide range of outcomes for Brexit, if there is a major shift due to Brexit talks that is deflationary, or creates an extreme trade-off, that could have consequences for monetary policy. The net result was GBP conceding the 1.31 handle and just managed to keep to the 1.30 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier tweeted Brexit negotiations can reach a good outcome, while there were also reports that Barnier was willing to &ldquo;improve the text&rdquo; of his proposal for an Irish backstop solution.

The Board said it will maintain prudent policy stance going forward, and it will follow closely the potential pass through from the peso, relative monetary stance with the US, as well as domestic slack. It also repeated its language that the balance of risks to inflation had an upward bias and balance of risks to growth has a downward bias.

McDonald&rsquo;s (MCD) were hit after reports in Business Insider that 350 French Branches have cases of Listeria. In terms, Tesla (TSLA) lost more than was expected, however, its revenues beat expectations. Tesla&rsquo;s cash outflow fell from $390mln in Q1 to $130mln in Q2 and also stated most of the cost restructuring took place in Q2, and it announced in the following quarter it expects to produce 50-55k Model 3s, but said the deliveries should exceed that; it also announced it will be sustainably profitable from Q3 onwards. After the report, CEO Elon Musk apologised to analysts for his &lsquo;bad behaviour&rsquo; in the last conference call where he stated the questions were &lsquo;boring and bonehead&rsquo;. The apology did benefit the stock as in aftermarket trade share price surged further to highs of ~11%. T-Mobile (TMUS) also reported an EPS beneath the consensus view, but revenues were stronger. SPX +0.5% at 2827, NDX +1.36% at 7372, DJI -0.03% at 25328.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were higher and the curve modestly bull-steepened on Thursday. There was some selling action after a weak JGB auction overnight, and after the BOE&rsquo;s rate decision, the complex also found sellers in the first instance. Analysts at IGM suggested that there was some short-covering ahead of Friday&rsquo;s payrolls data, while the belly of the curve was bolstered by a block trade in the five-year space. US 10YR T-notes settled higher by 5 ticks at 119-10+.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP - 2 Aug 2018: Apple hits $1trln valuation; BOE hikes but GBP falls; Banxico on hold",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities higher, Treasuries modestly bull-steepen, crude higher, dollar higher.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Apple hits $1trln valuation; BOE lifts rates, but pound falls. &nbsp;<br />* COMING-UP: Australian retail sails overnight and US nonfarm payrolls expected to show 195k added in July</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US Commerce Secretary Ross said that possible tariffs on Chinese imports would not be cataclysmic, says Trump feels it is potentially time to put more pressure on China with possible new tariffs. With regards to Europe, Ross said that the US intends to complete research on auto tariffs, but will only implement them if negotiations with the EU fail. Earlier, China&rsquo;s MOFCOM said they are to &#39;properly handle&#39; trade disputes with the US, and will take every effort to stabilize trade. And ahead of bilateral NAFTA talks between the US and Mexico, the Mexican economy minister Guajardo said NAFTA talks at with the USTR will cover all outstanding issues in trade talks, but again reiterated that there will not be a deal on autos until all NAFTA issues are resolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>The BOE hiked its Bank Rate by 25bps, as expected; the initial hawkish surprise was that the decision was unanimous (8-1 or 7-2 were the consensus). Inflation forecasts were little changed from the May projections, and growth was nudged up slightly. Analysts at Lloyds noted, however, that the updated inflation projections are premised on an additional 35bps of tightening over the next three years (over and above the 25bp increase delivered today), suggesting that the BOE would need to raise rates by more than the markets are currently expecting, especially if it intends to bring inflation back to target over a more conventional timeframe. (After the meeting, Governor Carney said that one rate hike a year for the next few years will, more or less, get inflation back to the 2% target over the horizon). Overall, the MPC&rsquo;s take on the outlook for the UK remains relatively unchanged, Lloyds says: &ldquo;The economy is expected to remain relatively resilient, while disappointing productivity growth will continue to see the limited amount of spare capacity that exists in the economy, to be used up relatively quickly, necessitating further increases in interest rates over the forecast horizon.&rdquo; Of course, the Bank&rsquo;s policy path is contingent upon Brexit, and BOE&#39;s Carney said that the Bank is ready for any potential outcome, working with Finance Ministry and ECB to manage Brexit risks that it cannot solve itself; Carney also said there is a wide range of outcomes for Brexit, if there is a major shift due to Brexit talks that is deflationary, or creates an extreme trade-off, that could have consequences for monetary policy &ndash; in later comments, Carney said BoE is prepared to cut interest rates back again, depending upon how Brexit negotiations go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU Brexit negotiator Barnier tweeted that Brexit negotiation can reach good outcome. &ldquo;We must solve withdrawal issues including Ireland/Northern Ireland,&rdquo; adding that the EU wants new partnership with the UK on security and with an ambitious free trade agreement at its heart.&rdquo; Barneir believes this can be achieved based on the EU&rsquo;s precious four principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BANXICO: </strong>Mexico Central Bank maintains rates at 7.75%, as expected, in an unanimous decision. The Board says it will maintain prudent policy stance going forward, and it will follow closely the potential pass through from the peso, relative monetary stance with the US, as well as domestic slack. It also repeated its language that the balance of risks to inflation had an upward bias, balance of risks to growth has a downward bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.5% at 2827, NDX +1.36% at 7372, DJI -0.03% at 25328. </strong>SECTORS: Tech +1.2%, consumer non cyclicals +1.0%, utilities +0.7%, consumer non-cyclicals +0.6%, healthcare +0.4%, telecoms +0.2%, industrials +0.0%, financials -0.1%, energy -0.5%, materials -0.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) became the first USD 1tln company as shares briefly breached 207.04, however, sellers emerged as the valuation was realised. McDonald&rsquo;s (MCD) were hit after reports in Business Insider that 350 French Branches have cases of Listeria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) lost more than was expected, however, its revenues beat expectations. Tesla&rsquo;s cash outflow fell from $390mln in Q1 to $130mln in Q2 and also stated most of the cost restructuring took place in Q2, and it announced in the following quarter it expects to produce 50-55k Model 3s, but said the deliveries should exceed that; it also announced it will be sustainably profitable from Q3 onwards. After the report,&nbsp; CEO Elon Musk apologised to analysts for his &lsquo;bad behaviour&rsquo; in the last conference call where he stated the questions were &lsquo;boring and bonehead&rsquo;. The apology did benefit the stock as in aftermarket trade share price surged further to highs of ~11%. T-Mobile (TMUS) also reported an EPS beneath the consensus view, but revenues were stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>Kraft Heinz (KHC) is said to have not made a bid for Pinnacle Foods (PF) in 2017; earlier in the week there was speculation Kraft Heinz could be a potential suitor for Campbell Soup (CPB), after it may be pushed for a sale by Dan Loeb&rsquo;s Third Point. After Wednesdays speculation that Carl Icahn may aim to block Cigna&rsquo;s (CI) $67bln takeover of Express Scripts (ESRX), Cigna&rsquo;s CEO announced they are confident shareholders will approve the deal and it was also reported that Icahn only holds a 1.2% stake in the name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (U8) SETTLES $1.30 HIGHER AT $68.96; BRENT (V8) SETTLES $1.06 HIGHER AT $73.45. </strong>Oil trades higher, despite data this week showing that supply continues to rise, and inventories are building. Russia crude production rose by 150k BPD in July, taking it 11.21mln BPD. Saudis cut official selling price to Asia by 70 cents, according to sources, which one analyst said reflects a need to trim prices if they hope to sell more barrels, which Citi says is also consistent with the ongoing contango spread in Brent. Traders were also citing a Bloomberg survey, which was said to show analysts forecasting OPEC production will rise by 300k BPD to 32.6mln BPD in July. And against that news flow, this week&rsquo;s inventory data showed surprise builds, and now has analysts focussing on tomorrow&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count data &ndash; one analyst noted that even a small addition of rigs could be enough to shake the crude market, given its sensitivity, at the moment. However, there were some bullish catalysts, and while they do not individually explain why oil is firm on Thursday, collectively, they may have provided bulls with the needed ammo: Singapore fuel stocks slipped to a nine-year low. Additionally, Genscape&rsquo;s latest forecast for Cushing stocks was said to show a draw of 1.1mln bbls vs last Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE HIGHER BY 5 TICKS AT 119-10+: </strong>Treasuries were higher and the curve modestly bull-steepened on Thursday. There was some selling action after a weak JGB auction overnight, and after the BOE&rsquo;s rate decision, the complex also found sellers in the first instance. Analysts at IGM suggested that there was some short-covering ahead of Friday&rsquo;s payrolls data, while the belly of the curve was bolstered by a block trade in the five-year space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Continued trade tensions kept the USD in positive territory, after the USTR was instructed to study raising tariffs on Chinese goods, and accordingly, the DXY once again above 95.0. JPY was also finding buyers, and while USDJPY is flat heading into Asia, EURJPY, AUDJPY and GBPJPY are all off by between 0.6% and 0.8%. One bank observes that US trade rhetoric has once again intensified as the US economy continues to show strength &ndash; as noted by the FOMC on Wednesday. Traders will be eyeing Friday&rsquo;s payrolls data, particular the AHE metrics, for signs that this continues, which ING says may keep the USD strong and EM on the back foot, and commodity FX getting hit despite higher oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Although the BOE lifted rates by 25bps, the pound has stumbled lower against both the USD and the EUR. Initially the pound rose on the decision, and the unanimous vote to hike rates, but during the press conference with Governor Carney, sellers emerged. There have been a number of narratives offered for the selling, with the Bank stressing that any future rate rises are likely to be gradual and limited (as it has suggested previously), and the current market rate path is flatter than it was in May, implying a rate of 0.9% in one-year (ie. another hike by then), and 1.0% in two-years, and 1.1% in three-years. Perhaps it was due to Carney once again flagging up Brexit risks suggesting that there is a wide range of outcomes for Brexit, if there is a major shift due to Brexit talks that is deflationary, or creates an extreme trade-off, that could have consequences for monetary policy. The net result was GBP conceding the 1.31 handle, though just manages to keep the 1.30 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: US NONFARM PAYROLLS: </strong>The BLS will release July&rsquo;s Employment Situation Report at 1330BST/0830EDT on 3rd August 2018. Headline payrolls expected to slow modestly to 190k after printing north of 200k in the past two months.

ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) were lower with the mining sector the worst performer in Australia amid losses in Rio Tinto following a miss on earnings, while a firmer currency, various corporate updates and weak US sales among automakers dampened Tokyo trade. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.0%) took the brunt of the increased US tariff threats as well as further inaction by the PBoC which refrained from conducting reverse repos for a 10th consecutive occasion. 10yr JGBs were choppy and initially continued on from yesterday&rsquo;s slump at the open as the 10yr yield rose to its highest since February last year of 0.145%. However, yields then pulled back to provide much needed reprieve for JGBs which were also supported amid safe-haven flows. In addition, the latest securities flows data showed foreign investors upped their purchases of Japanese bonds by around 9-fold from the prior week, while Daiwa also suggested there should be good demand for 10yr JGBs at yields between 0.15%-0.20% at least until next BoJ policy meeting. Today&rsquo;s 10yr year auction was another catalyst for price action with all metrics pointing to a weaker result which saw 10yr JGBs decline nearly 30 ticks, before bouncing back towards 150.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump asked USTR to consider 25% tariffs on USD 200bln of Chinese goods, while officials also commented that stronger actions are needed on China but added that President Trump is open to negotiating with the Chinese President. China Commerce Ministry said China will have to fight back against the US to defend its dignity and people&#39;s interests; adding China upholds using dialogue to resolve disputes.

China&rsquo;s MOFCOM replied that China will fight back to defend its people&rsquo;s interests and dignity. Germany&rsquo;s DAX 30 is heavily underperforming, dragged down by heavyweight Siemens (-4.8%) following earnings, while Commerzbank (-4.5%), Deutsche Bank (-3.3%) and the German auto names also pressure the index. Material names continue to underperform, on the back of softer base metal prices. As such, we see UK miners resting at the bottom of the FTSE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable post-earning movers include: LSE (+2.6%), Altice (-14.5%), Hugo Boss (-6.0%) and Inmarsat (-4.9%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have both retreated further from best levels, but the latter is now markedly underperforming having dipped below 122.00 to 121.99 (-13 ticks vs +7 ticks at best) on the back of a significant UK construction PMI beat that should have put any residual doubts about a BoE hike later to rest, before rebounding to 122.21. Meanwhile, the 10 year German benchmark is probing fresh Eurozone peaks at 161.42 (+51 ticks vs +14 ticks at the 161.05 low), with some underlying/renewed support coming via another downturn in Italian BTPs. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are closer to overnight highs and the curve fractionally flatter amidst more Chinese verbal warnings about retaliation against latest more penal US tariffs, and ahead of a busy post-Fed agenda before NFP on Friday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Greenback is broadly firmer in wake of the latest FOMC statement that saw growth, inflation and labour market assessments all upgraded to underpin September rate hike expectations and keep the Fed on track to deliver another &frac14; point tightening by year end. Heightened trade and other global tensions have also boosted the Buck as the DXY nudges back up to 95.000 having hit lows very close to the big figure below just 2 days ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - In stark contrast, the Pound has been on the back foot even though the BoE is almost unanimously expected to raise rates by 25 bp at midday, and barely derived any support or traction from a much stronger than forecast UK construction PMI. Cable remains sub-1.3100 having hit a circa 1.3070 low after support around 1.3095 also gave way and stops were reportedly tripped from 1.3090. Back to &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday, many believe that guidance and the general tone from the MPC minutes will be cautious, if not dovish, with risks to growth and inflation from ongoing Brexit uncertainty and global trade wars likely to be flagged and highlighted in latest QIR projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - The other G10 laggards and both back under big figure levels (0.7400 and 0.6800 respectively) vs their US counterpart on the aforementioned ramp up in US-China import tariff threats and counter measures or verbal retaliation. The Aud got a temporary lift overnight from a significantly wider than anticipated Aussie trade surplus, but faded above the round number yet again and could also be wary about a hefty option expiry (1 bn) at the 0.7350 strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has lost more traction vs the Usd on the downturn in risk sentiment, and retreated further from 1.1700 towards 1.1600 having breached Fib support near 1.1616 and a daily cloud base at 1.1648 on the way down. However, more layered expiry interest in decent size between 1.1600-10 and 1.1625-35 (both in 1.1 bn) could exert some directional influence ahead of and into the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF - Somewhat mixed after Wednesday&rsquo;s Swiss national day break with declines vs the Dollar towards 0.9950, but outperformance against the Eur in wake of stronger than expected retail sales data and manufacturing PMI &ndash; cross hovering just below 1.1550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - Back below 1.3000 vs its US rival, but not really due to anything Loonie-specific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM -Broad losses vs the generally bid Usd, but the Lira&rsquo;s almost inevitable further depreciation on latest US sanction proposals down through 5.0000 is eye-catching as the Try tumbles to fresh all time lows (circa 5.0900 at one stage).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;WTI and Brent slip lower with the complex pressured by USD strength following the latest tariff news. Energy news flow remains light, however, sources reported that&nbsp; Russia, the largest oil producer,&nbsp; is forecasting&nbsp; an output around 11.2mln bpd to the year-end. Of note: Russia&rsquo;s July oil production stood at 11.2mln bpd (vs. June output of 10.93mln bpd). Meanwhile, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange are looking into the possibility of setting up a market maker scheme for crude oil futures after the exchange asked brokers to help boost trading volumes and liquidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spot gold is flat as USD strength outweighs safe-haven flows. Copper continues its decline amid demand concerns fuelled by the rise in trade tensions.</p>\r\n",

China&rsquo;s MOFCOM replied that China will fight back to defend its people&rsquo;s interests and dignity. Germany&rsquo;s DAX 30 is heavily underperforming, dragged down by heavyweight Siemens (-4.8%) following earnings, while Commerzbank (-4.5%), Deutsche Bank (-3.3%) and the German auto names also pressure the index. Material names continue to underperform, on the back of softer base metal prices. As such, we see UK miners resting at the bottom of the FTSE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable post-earning movers include: LSE (+2.6%), Altice (-14.5%), Hugo Boss (-6.0%) and Inmarsat (-4.9%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Greenback is broadly firmer in wake of the latest FOMC statement that saw growth, inflation and labour market assessments all upgraded to underpin September rate hike expectations and keep the Fed on track to deliver another &frac14; point tightening by year end. Heightened trade and other global tensions have also boosted the Buck as the DXY nudges back up to 95.000 having hit lows very close to the big figure below just 2 days ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - In stark contrast, the Pound has been on the back foot even though the BoE is almost unanimously expected to raise rates by 25 bp at midday, and barely derived any support or traction from a much stronger than forecast UK construction PMI. Cable remains sub-1.3100 having hit a circa 1.3070 low after support around 1.3095 also gave way and stops were reportedly tripped from 1.3090. Back to &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday, many believe that guidance and the general tone from the MPC minutes will be cautious, if not dovish, with risks to growth and inflation from ongoing Brexit uncertainty and global trade wars likely to be flagged and highlighted in latest QIR projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - The other G10 laggards and both back under big figure levels (0.7400 and 0.6800 respectively) vs their US counterpart on the aforementioned ramp up in US-China import tariff threats and counter measures or verbal retaliation. The Aud got a temporary lift overnight from a significantly wider than anticipated Aussie trade surplus, but faded above the round number yet again and could also be wary about a hefty option expiry (1 bn) at the 0.7350 strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has lost more traction vs the Usd on the downturn in risk sentiment, and retreated further from 1.1700 towards 1.1600 having breached Fib support near 1.1616 and a daily cloud base at 1.1648 on the way down. However, more layered expiry interest in decent size between 1.1600-10 and 1.1625-35 (both in 1.1 bn) could exert some directional influence ahead of and into the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF - Somewhat mixed after Wednesday&rsquo;s Swiss national day break with declines vs the Dollar towards 0.9950, but outperformance against the Eur in wake of stronger than expected retail sales data and manufacturing PMI &ndash; cross hovering just below 1.1550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - Back below 1.3000 vs its US rival, but not really due to anything Loonie-specific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM -Broad losses vs the generally bid Usd, but the Lira&rsquo;s almost inevitable further depreciation on latest US sanction proposals down through 5.0000 is eye-catching as the Try tumbles to fresh all time lows (circa 5.0900 at one stage).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED</strong> <strong>INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have both retreated further from best levels, but the latter is now markedly underperforming having dipped below 122.00 to 121.99 (-13 ticks vs +7 ticks at best) on the back of a significant UK construction PMI beat that should have put any residual doubts about a BoE hike later to rest, before rebounding to 122.21. Meanwhile, the 10 year German benchmark is probing fresh Eurozone peaks at 161.42 (+51 ticks vs +14 ticks at the 161.05 low), with some underlying/renewed support coming via another downturn in Italian BTPs. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are closer to overnight highs and the curve fractionally flatter amidst more Chinese verbal warnings about retaliation against latest more penal US tariffs, and ahead of a busy post-Fed agenda before NFP on Friday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent slip lower with the complex pressured by USD strength following the latest tariff news. Energy news flow remains light, however, sources reported that&nbsp; Russia, the largest oil producer,&nbsp; is forecasting&nbsp; an output around 11.2mln bpd to the year-end. Of note: Russia&rsquo;s July oil production stood at 11.2mln bpd (vs. June output of 10.93mln bpd). Meanwhile, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange are looking into the possibility of setting up a market maker scheme for crude oil futures after the exchange asked brokers to help boost trading volumes and liquidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spot gold is flat as USD strength outweighs safe-haven flows. Copper continues its decline amid demand concerns fuelled by the rise in trade tensions.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback is broadly firmer in wake of the latest FOMC statement that saw growth, inflation and labour market assessments all upgraded to underpin September rate hike expectations and keep the Fed on track to deliver another &frac14; point tightening by year end. Heightened trade and other global tensions have also boosted the Buck as the DXY nudges back up towards 95.000 having hit lows very close to the big figure below just 2 days ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stark contrast, the Pound has been on the back foot even though the BoE is almost unanimously expected to raise rates by 25 bp at midday, and barely derived any support or traction from a much stronger than forecast UK construction PMI. Cable remains sub-1.3100 having hit a circa 1.3070 low after support around 1.3095 also gave way and stops were reportedly tripped from 1.3090. Back to &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday, many believe that guidance and the general tone from the MPC minutes will be cautious, if not dovish, with risks to growth and inflation from ongoing Brexit uncertainty and global trade wars likely to be flagged and highlighted in latest QIR projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other G10 laggards and both back under big figure levels (0.7400 and 0.6800 respectively) vs their US counterpart on the aforementioned ramp up in US-China import tariff threats and counter measures or verbal retaliation. The Aud got a temporary lift overnight from a significantly wider than anticipated Aussie trade surplus, but faded above the round number yet again and could also be wary about a hefty option expiry (1 bn) at the 0.7350 strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has lost more traction vs the Usd on the downturn in risk sentiment, and retreated further from 1.1700 to test Fib support near 1.1616 having breached a daily cloud base at 1.1648. However, more layered expiry interest in decent size between 1.1600-10 and 1.1625-35 (both in 1.1 bn) could exert some directional influence ahead of and into the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhat mixed after Wednesday&rsquo;s Swiss national day break with declines vs the Dollar towards 0.9950, but outperformance against the Eur in wake of stronger than expected retail sales data and manufacturing PMI &ndash; cross hovering just above 1.1550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back below 1.3000 vs its US rival, but not really due to anything Loonie-specific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broad losses vs the generally bid Usd, but the Lira&rsquo;s almost inevitable further depreciation on latest US sanction proposals down through 5.0000 is eye-catching as the Try tumbles to fresh all time lows (circa 5.0900 at one stage).</p>\r\n",

A 25 bp hike is largely priced in, but the MPC vote split, minutes and aforementioned inflation report will be key in terms of determining whether the BoE is planning to tighten policy further this year or shifts to a neutral/2-way stance in case Brexit blows up and/or trade tensions escalate to all out war proportions. Hence, it is far from over until the Old Lady has had her say, and the construction PMI will likely be just a starter before the main course.</p>\r\n",

However, the rebound appears fragile again amidst the overall bear re-steepening trend that has only marginally paused in wake of the FOMC last night as the Fed fuelled expectations of 2 more hikes this year. Ahead, Thursday&rsquo;s Eurozone agenda is sparse in terms of data with just PPI due, but supply could be an issue given hefty multi-tranche auctions from Spain and France. Back to Eurex, Bunds are currently mid-range between 161.11-23 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 160.91 close.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, gold prices only saw marginal gains as support from safe-haven flows was counterbalanced by the greenback, while copper continued on its downward path amid trade concerns and weakness in Chinese metal prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is said to plan restricting steel output in more cities during winter.

(Newswires/CNN)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House said the US is sanctioning Turkish officials over the detention of American Pastor Brunson and had reportedly prepared a list of Turkish entities as well as individuals that it will target, while the Turkish Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the US sanctions and that it will retaliate against the hostile stance by the US.

US 10YR T-notes settled 8 ticks lower at 119-05+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior Mexican official said Mexico and US are getting close to a deal on autos and rules of origin of NAFTA, while the official added the US is still pressing for a sunset clause and that Mexico are suggesting this could be reviewed every 5 years.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets were weaker across the board with sentiment weighed by increased global trade tensions after officials confirmed US President Trump instructed Trade Representative Lighthizer to consider a higher tariff of 25% on USD 200bln of goods from China which had earlier warned of retaliation. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) were lower with the mining sector the worst performer in Australia amid losses in Rio Tinto following a miss on earnings, while a firmer currency, various corporate updates and weak US sales among automakers dampened Tokyo trade. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-2.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.5%) took the brunt of the increased US tariff threats as well as further inaction by the PBoC which refrained from conducting reverse repos for a 10th consecutive occasion. 10yr JGBs were choppy and initially continued on from yesterday&rsquo;s slump at the open as the 10yr yield rose to its highest since February last year of 0.145%. However, yields then pulled back to provide much needed reprieve for JGBs which were also supported amid safe-haven flows. In addition, the latest securities flows data showed foreign investors upped their purchases of Japanese bonds by around 9-fold from the prior week, while Daiwa also suggested there should be good demand for 10yr JGBs at yields between 0.15%-0.20% at least until next BoJ policy meeting. Today&rsquo;s 10yr year auction was another catalyst for price action with all metrics pointing to a weaker result which saw 10yr JGBs decline nearly 30 ticks, before bouncing back towards 150.00.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are lower with the mining sector underperforming in Australia amid losses in Rio Tinto following a miss on earnings, while a firmer currency, various corporate updates and weak US sales among automakers has dampened Tokyo trade. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.7%) are the worst performers on the increased tariff threats as well as further inaction by the PBoC which refrained from conducting reverse repos for a 10th consecutive occasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most currencies trade uneventful with the DXY flat in a continuation of the prior day&rsquo;s indecision. This was after the FOMC failed to trigger any significant reaction in which the Fed maintained rates as expected and didn&rsquo;t provide any new information. EUR/USD is also lacklustre after having recently failed to reclaim the 1.1700 handle and GBP/USD bides its time ahead of the BoE&rsquo;s Super Thursday where the central bank is expected to hike rates by 25bps. Elsewhere, AUD/USD retreated below 0.7400 as a larger than expected Trade Surplus only provided brief support against the gloomy backdrop of recent commodity declines and trade-related concerns, while USD/JPY is also dampened amid the risk averse tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10yr JGBs initially continued on from yesterday&rsquo;s slump at the open as the 10yr yield rose to its highest since February last year of 0.145%. However, yields then pulled back to provide much needed reprieve for JGBs which were also supported amid safe-haven flows. In addition, the latest securities flows data showed foreign investors upped their purchases of Japanese bonds by around 9-fold from the prior week, while Daiwa also suggested there should be good demand for 10yr JGBs at yields between 0.15%-0.20% at least until next BoJ policy meeting.</p>\r\n",
