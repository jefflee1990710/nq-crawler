Salesforce (CRM) outperformed after beating EPS/revenue estimates, and raising guidance. Humana (HUM) traded higher following the announcement of a $750mln share repurchase programme, and an increase in its membership growth outlook. Under Armour (UAA) drifted higher, helped by positive comments made by Dick&rsquo;s (DKS) on its outlook. Alaska Air (ALK) made gains after raising its RASM forecast and receiving an upgrade at Goldman. AMD (AMD) and NVIDIA (NVDA) were top performers on the open after analyst comments that the stocks are set to gain from rising GPU prices; other semiconductor co. Micron (MU) had a late session bounce too after its CEO gave a positive outlook at a conference. Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) buoyed industrials on pro-China/US trade sentiment. Tiffany (TIF) nosedived on the back of missing same store sales estimates. J.M. Smucker (SJM) suffered after it reported EPS and revenue below estimates, whilst lowering its FY growth margin.

With that said, analysts are increasingly pointing out that the range in Treasury futures is extremely narrow. Even after Powell&rsquo;s comments, the probability of a December rate hike was still around 80%, while the pricing through 2019 was only modestly narrowed (fed funds for Jan 2020 are implying an end-2019 FFR rate of 2.71% vs 2.75% pre-Powell). After the Powell speech, the US Treasury sold USD 32bln of 7-year notes at a high yield of 2.974%, stopping through the screens by 0.6bps. Demand for the auction was decent with the bid-to-cover 2.55x, slightly above the 6-auction average. Direct bidders took a significant portion compared to recent trend (as has been seen in the 2s and 5s auctions this week), pushing indirects and dealer participation below recent averages. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 4+ ticks higher at 119-12+.</p>\r\n",

Powell reiterated the Fed&#39;s data dependent policy stance and that there was no pre-set policy path; however, he talked-up the US economy once again, saying that he expects US growth, low unemployment and close-to-target inflation, and did not see any excesses in the stock markets. The release of his comments saw a dovish reaction in markets, with the USD plunging, stocks bouncing, while the Treasury complex also caught a bid. In the Q&amp;A, Powell reiterated views he made in October that the R-star rate was uncertain, adding that it was too soon to say that the recent financial market volatility changes his estimate of neutral policy or maximum employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> The Fed Stability report cited trade tensions, Brexit and other developments among shocks that could cause particularly large declines in asset values; &quot;elevated&quot; asset values and possible decay in corporate credit standards were also flagged among chief risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Chinese President Xi announced on Wednesday that he will step up protection of Intellectual Property rights while adding that China will sharply widen market access for foreign investors; they are set to import USD 10tln of goods in the next 5 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> The European Commission is set to begin disciplinary actions on Italy regarding debt before Christmas since it was unimpressed by the proposal of a 2.2%-2.3% budget deficit target; in related comments EU Commissioner Dombrovskis stated that a cut of 0.2% of the 2019 budget target is not enough. In response to the EU decision, Italian PM Conte pledged to do anything to find an agreement with the EU on the budget and noted there will be room for manoeuvre on final budget numbers after a cost review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>All seven banks and building society have passed their 2018 stress tests with no bank in need to strengthen its capital position as a result of the stress test. The BoE sated that the contingent capital used at Lloyds, Barclays is to pass under full implementation of new IFRS 9 accounting rule; it noted that banks have trillion GDP in liquidity to withstand 3-months freeze in funding market. The counter-cyclical capital buffer was also left unchanged at 1% though the central bank stands ready to cut if &ldquo;economic stress were materialise&rdquo;. With regards to Brexit, the tests showed that the sector can withstand a no-deal, no transition Brexit and continue lending while EU should spell out its conditions for cross-border clearing of derivatives under a no-deal outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB sources stated on Wednesday that policymakers are leaning towards only nuanced tweaks in reinvestment policy, including open-ended time horizon while they are comfortable with markets expectations that re-investments will go on for 2-3 years. The sources also suggested the ECB&#39;s reinvestment policy tweaks, including shift to new capital key, aim to be broadly market-neutral while the shift to capital key with regard to flow of re-investments could be done over the course of several years. Elsewhere, ECB officials were said to expect to confirm end of bond buying and was said to see no need for new long-term loans. In comments, ECB&#39;s Lane said that at some point interest rates will have to go up, although there is no current plan to do so, and will be dependent on what data will be in the second half of 2019. He went on to say that wage data remains in line while he believes it is important to not be overly dramatic about the EZ growth slowdown. ECB&#39;s De Guindos stated that the Eurozone economy continues to grow. ECB&#39;s Mersch (Hawkish) said the ECB bond buying must stay market neutral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The UK Government published its assessment of the Brexit impact on the UK economy aimed at informing MPs of the possible effects of each withdrawal scenarios ahead of the meaningful vote scheduled on December 11th. The report showed that PM May&#39;s plan would lower GDP by 2.1%, and a no-deal Brexit by 7.7% in 15 years&rsquo; time when compared to remaining in the EU. Most analysts agree that a more radical &nbsp;exit from the EU also means a more severe economic impact; Oxford Economics shares this view but predicts a smaller negative impact on the UK under the two outlined circumstances arguing that if the WA was implemented as of now, &ldquo;the most likely outcome would be that the UK remained in a customs union with the EU for a prolonged period&rdquo;. OxEco also noted that the government has modelled its analysis upon July&rsquo;s White Paper of which large parts are now unachievable. Elsewhere, a summary of the legal position regarding the Brexit deal will be published by the government on December 3rd; UK PM May urged the release to remain confidential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US GDP </strong>came in unchanged showing that the US economy continued to grow at a healthy 3.5% pace in October. Looking at the breakdown, a lower revision to consumer spending was entirely offset by an upward revision to investment spending and similarly a larger stockpile in inventories was offset by a fall in net exports. Given the current pace, &ldquo;solid GDP growth underpinned strong growth in corporate profits&rdquo;, Wells Fargo states, highlighting that particularly encouraging domestic profits reveal the strength of the US economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ADVANCED GOODS TRADE BALANCE</strong> showed a deficit widening to 77.25bln in October from 76.25bln in September. Analysts at Pantheon note that this reading could have been much worse since the large leap in imports was kept lower by a drop in capital goods imports, while exports disappointed once again. Looking ahead, the overall trend is deteriorating and tariffs &ldquo;can&rsquo;t fix the fundamental problem that the US doesn&rsquo;t save, net, so it has to run a deficit&rdquo;; Pantheon therefore states &ldquo;net foreign trade is set to be a drag on Q4 GDP growth, though the hit will be much smaller than the 1.9 percentage point drag in the third quarter&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NEW HOME SALES </strong>dropped by 8.9% in October, significantly below expectations and hitting the lowest level since March 2016. Nonetheless, the data was subject to positive revisions which added 53k to the last 3 months. The breakdown showed sales falling in all four regions with the largest decline seen in the South partially reflecting the impact of Hurricane Michael, Goldman Sachs says. Going forward, analysts at Pantheon forecast &ldquo;a hefty rebound in new home sales over the next few months&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +2.30% at 2744, NDX +3.17% at 6913, DJI +2.50% at 25366. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +1.74%, Materials +1.48%, Industrials +2.40%, Cons Discretionary +3.23%, Cons Staples +0.98%, Healthcare +2.46%, Financials +1.82%, Tech +3.44%, Telecoms +2.12%, Utilities -0.13%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> FAANG (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOGL) led gains higher amid an improved risk environment, though Facebook was underperforming as it tackles its data handling scandal. Salesforce (CRM) outperformed after beating EPS/revenue estimates, and raising guidance. Humana (HUM) traded higher following the announcement of a $750mln share repurchase programme, and an increase in its membership growth outlook. Under Armour (UAA) drifted higher, helped by positive comments made by Dick&rsquo;s (DKS) on its outlook. Alaska Air (ALK) made gains after raising its RASM forecast and receiving an upgrade at Goldman. AMD (AMD) and NVIDIA (NVDA) were top performers on the open after analyst comments that the stocks are set to gain from rising GPU prices; other semiconductor co. Micron (MU) had a late session bounce too after its CEO gave a positive outlook at a conference. Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) buoyed industrials on pro-China/US trade sentiment. Tiffany (TIF) nosedived on the back of missing same store sales estimates. J.M. Smucker (SJM) suffered after it reported EPS and revenue below estimates, whilst lowering its FY growth margin. Western Digital (WDC) drifted lower today as news broke of the departure of its CFO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD AT USD /BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLE USD AT USD /BBL.</strong> Crude was trading defensively on Wednesday, with weekly inventory data confirming the bearish API report released Tuesday; headline crude stocks built by 3.6mln (exp. 0.8mln), Cushing stocks built 1.2mln; the products, distillates built 2.6mln (exp draw 0.86mln), and gasoline stocks drew by 0.76mln (exp. build 0.64mln). Crude production was unchanged for a third straight week at 11.7mln BPD, while refinery runs rose 2.9% in the week. Attention will be on the G20, where the Saudis and Russians will hold meetings (Putin/MBS, as well as the respective oil ministers) and the crude market will be discussed. There wasn&rsquo;t anything particularly new in today&rsquo;s round of policymaker jawboning, with the Saudis making familiar noises about oil market stability, echoed by the Nigerians, while Russia&rsquo;s energy minister has been consulting with oil companies, according to sources. Putin himself suggested Russia was comfortable with crude prices at USD 60/bbl. Looking to this week&rsquo;s G20, UBS said &ldquo;any progress made [between Trump and Xi] will help reduce concern about slowing global growth, which would be positive for oil demand,&rdquo; while noting that the consensus expectations are for a 1mln BPD cut to be announced, &ldquo;though not necessarily implemented immediately, and any headlines emerging from the Russia-Saudi meeting that support this view will also be positive for oil.&rdquo; However, UBS argues that whether the supply glut argument that the Saudis have used to justify a cut is valid or not, &ldquo;sentiment is likely to turn negative again unless OPEC send a signal that they are willing to support the oil price.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 4+ TICKS HIGHER AT 119-12+. </strong>Yields were lower across the curve, with the exception of the 30-year, where yields rose slightly; today&rsquo;s action was sponsored by apparently dovish remarks from Fed chair Powell. With that said, analysts are increasingly pointing out that the range in Treasury futures is extremely narrow. Even after Powell&rsquo;s comments, the probability of a December rate hike was still around 80%, while the pricing through 2019 was only modestly narrowed (fed funds for Jan 2020 are implying an end-2019 FFR rate of 2.71% vs 2.75% pre-Powell). After the Powell speech, the US Treasury sold USD 32bln of 7-year notes at a high yield of 2.974%, stopping through the screens by 0.6bps. Demand for the auction was decent with the bid-to-cover 2.55x, slightly above the 6-auction average. Direct bidders took a significant portion compared to recent trend (as has been seen in the 2s and 5s auctions this week), pushing indirects and dealer participation below recent averages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> The Greenback sunk after comments by Fed Chair Powell, who said that interest rates are just below the broad range of estimates of the neutral rate (which is estimated at between 2.50% and 3.50%), and that the Fed was not on a pre-set policy course. The DXY slid from 97.45 to 97.05 in an immediate reaction, seeing a small bounce before resuming the fall to 96.68. Powell&#39;s comments helped EUR jump above 10-day and 21-day moving averages, with technicians highlighting the bullish landscape (RSI divergence, bull engulfing candle); GBP also benefited from the buck&#39;s weakness, though EURGBP moves were modest. The dollars also gained, also supported by a constructive risk environment where stocks traded higher, led by the FAANGs; technicians say the AUD strength has set up a re-test of the 200-day moving average around 0.7480-0.75, though the leg up will probably need fresh catalysts ahead of the G20. Positive noises from the G20 with regards to the Trump/Xi meeting could be that catalyst, given the market would likely interpret it as positive for global growth, and hence FX like the AUD.</p>\r\n",

Crude production was unchanged for a third straight week at 11.7mln BPD, while refinery runs rose 2.9% in the week. Attention will be on the G20, where the Saudis and Russians will hold meetings (Putin/MBS, as well as the respective oil ministers) and the crude market will be discussed. There wasn&rsquo;t anything particularly new in today&rsquo;s round of policymaker jawboning, with the Saudis making familiar noises about oil market stability, echoed by the Nigerians, while Russia&rsquo;s energy minister has been consulting with oil companies, according to sources. Putin himself suggested Russia was comfortable with crude prices at USD 60/bbl. Looking to this week&rsquo;s G20, UBS said &ldquo;any progress made [between Trump and Xi] will help reduce concern about slowing global growth, which would be positive for oil demand,&rdquo; while noting that the consensus expectations are for a 1mln BPD cut to be announced, &ldquo;though not necessarily implemented immediately, and any headlines emerging from the Russia-Saudi meeting that support this view will also be positive for oil.&rdquo; However, UBS argues that whether the supply glut argument that the Saudis have used to justify a cut is valid or not, &ldquo;sentiment is likely to turn negative again unless OPEC send a signal that they are willing to support the oil price.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 111bln in new 2-year (Mon, USD 39bln), 5-year (Tue, USD 40bln) and 7-year (Wed, USD 32bln); the Treasury will also tap the 2-year October 2020 FRN for USD 18bln. UBS notes that this week will bring approximately USD 90bln of cash flows, including around USD 8bln of coupons and around USD 82bln of redemptions (ex-reinvested portion of SOMA holdings). The week beginning 10 December will see ~USD25bn of cash flows (incl. USD1.2bn of coupon payments).</li>\r\n  <li><strong>2-YEAR/5-YEAR REVIEW: </strong>Monday&#39;s auction of 2s was decent; while cover came in below recent averages, the auction stopped through the screens by 0.1bps. Analysts were encouraged by the internals, which saw the return of direct bidders (19.5% participation vs 5.5% previous), which resulted in dealer and indirect participation falling beneath recent averages. The return of the direct bid was also evident at the 5-year auction, which came in on the screws, while cover was slightly firmer than the prior auction; UBS said month-end and index extensions could help explain the bid, but it was still a strong auction when you consider the lack of concession.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>7-YEAR AUCTION: </strong>The auction will follow comments from Fed Chair Powell, who will speak at the economic club of NY an hour before the auction results are to be published. &quot; I wouldn&#39;t expect anything new,&quot; UBS fixed income traders said, &quot;the market would probably welcome a small sell off after his speech to allow some concession heading into US 7y supply tonight. After that, attention will turn to month end.&quot; While the Street will be looking to see if the return of direct bids is evident in the 7-year sector, it is also worth keeping an eye on the indirect bid, which tends to be seen in 7s auctions; indirect participation will be of particular note following the comments of the Chinese ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai, who said he does not think China would seriously considering using its large holdings of US Treasuries as a weapon in any trade war, citing concerns that such a move would destabilize financial markets, Reuters reported. Cui said China wanted to avoid any financial instability in markets. &ldquo;His most important point was that China&#39;s holdings of UST showed the economic interdependence between the two countries which would be almost impossible and dangerous to untangle,&rdquo; UBS noted.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes in the run up to a keynote speech from Fed Chair Powell, as the Pound derived some support from pro-Brexit deal remarks made by UK Environment Minister Gove (said the proposed EU withdrawal terms are the best on offer). Cable also took encouragement from the fact that it survived another relatively severe test of recent lows around 1.2725 to retest 1.2800, but could not quite muster enough momentum to breach the 10 DMA circa 1.2805. Conversely, the Loonie lost any impetus it may have been receiving from a recovery in crude prices as that stalled and partially reversed, while the prospect of signing the USMCA pact at the G20 Summit was undermined by ongoing issues between Canada and the US over dairy products. Usd/Cad climbed to a fresh multi-month high just above 1.3350 and looks primed for further gains towards the 2018 high next (1.3386).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/CHF/EUR/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback and only marginally extending ranges, if at all as the countdown to the G20 summit continues and other well known, persistent factors remain prevalent &ndash; namely, global trade, Italy&rsquo;s budget and geopolitics. Aud/Usd is holding above 0.7200 and the Kiwi is hovering just shy of 0.6800 as the cross pivots 1.0650, while the Franc sits a few pips below parity, but has rallied through another big figure vs the Eur towards 1.1250 on the aforementioned ongoing Italian vs EU fiscal impasse. On that note, PM Conte has pledged to do whatever it takes to resolve the situation, but reveals that no final decision to revise the 2.4% deficit has been taken, so recent reports of 2.2% look premature, and even the latter failed to appease Brussels as officials want bigger adjustments to prevent deficit measures being imposed before Xmas. Hence, the single currency has probed further below 1.1300 after triggering stops at 1.1275 and finding a base, for now at least. Elsewhere, Usd/Jpy has inched a bit closer towards 114.00 having breached another Fib resistance level (113.76) on a closing basis yesterday, but stopped just 5 pips short of hefty option expiry interest at the strike (1.9 bn) and large offer said to be sitting between 114.00 and 114.20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some consolidation pre-Powell,&nbsp; but the broad Dollar still looks braced for further upside pending the tone of the FOMC head, with the DXY just off a 97.536 high for the midweek session (so far) and not too far away from its ytd best (97.693). Tax repatriation demand should in theory end today (spot month end), but the next SOMA day coincides with month end and November 30 may see residual buying for rebalancing needs.</p>\r\n",

However, Bunds extended their Eurex session low and underperformance vs Gilts, to 160.89 (-13 ticks) at one stage, as BTPs hold relatively firm ahead of more budget meetings in Rome and Italian PM Conte&rsquo;s date with EU&rsquo;s Barnier later. Back to Liffe, Gilts remain comfortably above 123.00 and US Treasuries are still on the defensive ahead of Powell and the final slug of issuance this week. Meanwhile, the Dollar is also idling, albeit with an underlying bid into month end (and for spot purposes that is today of course) with the DXY just shy of 97.500.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.3%) and Shanghai Comp.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what&rsquo;s been a slightly choppy session thus far, European equities (Eurostoxx 50 +0.3%) have held on to opening gains seen in the wake of the upbeat US and Asia-Pac sessions, despite lingering trade concerns. The most recent interjection came from White House Economic Adviser Kudlow who commented that Trump is open to a deal with China and that the raising of tariffs to 25% is not a &quot;certainty&quot; but&nbsp; will be implemented if no constructive talks occur at the G20. In terms of sector specifics, IT names are the clear outperformers at this stage of the session with Wirecard (+1.3%) and Dialog Semiconductor (+3.1%) notable gainers in the tech-space after trying to recoup recent losses with not much else in the way of key newsflow. Noteworthy individual movers include EDF (+3.1%) with shares buoyed by reports that that a potential increase in the French government&rsquo;s stake in the Co. would take place next year. To the downside, Tenaris (-8.2%), sit at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the Co.&rsquo;s chairman was indicted in a graft case, whilst Continental shares (-5.4%) have been weighed on by negative comments from Redburn who have warned over the group&rsquo;s EBIT prospects in 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Off best levels but retaining an underlying bid with supportive month end flows alongside HIA and SOMA redemption (24.9bln comes due on Friday) all impacting, while market participants keep a close eye on Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s speech scheduled for later today where he may stop the USD in its tracks or exacerbate the rally. The index has gained more ground above 97.000 to just over 97.500 before losing some momentum but still on the course to challenge the YTD high at 97.693, technically if not fundamentally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, AUD, NZD &ndash; All consolidating after recent losses vs. the buck with cable trying to revisit 1.2800 after UK Environment Minister Gove noted that UK PM May&rsquo;s deal is the best on the table and offset some of the earlier Brexit negativity that was prompted by the latest piece via The Sun which stated that meaningful vote could results in a 200 vote defeat in parliament and with some cabinet ministers seeing zero chance of the draft passing. Separately, a cable forecast which took the average of 18 banks&rsquo; views of cable post-parliament vote show a 55% chance of a rejection and the pair reaching 1.25, while an approval could boost cable up to 1.34. Meanwhile, UK Chancellor Hammond said the government are to publish a summary of the legal advice on Brexit, which will ruffle some feathers amongst hardcore Brexiteers as MPs passed a motion two weeks ago that ordered ministers to provide legal advice in full on PM May&rsquo;s deal. Elsewhere, antipodeans are faring better vs. the greenback again with AUD/NZD trading flat within a tight range and as NZD tests 0.6800 to the upside amid the RBNZ FSR release overnight in which they eased loan-to-value ratio restriction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; More choppy trade for the single currency with EUR/USD trading around the middle of a 1.1267-1.1304 range having taken out stops at 1.1275. Italian politics keep weighing on the currency with the European Commission unimpressed as it will begin disciplinary actions on Italy regarding debt before Christmas. EU Commissioner Dombrovskis also added that a cut of 0.2% of the 2019 budget target is not enough. EUR/USD is being drawn towards a large amount of option expiries between 1.1275 &ndash; 1.1300 (1.5bln). Looking ahead, markets will be keeping a close eye on the budget discussion between the Italian PM, two Deputy PM and Finance Minister for any hints of a budge towards EC&rsquo;s direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &ndash; Another victim of the USD strength and global trade jitters as Trump&rsquo;s economic advisor Kudlow said the USMCA agreement is to be signed on Friday at the G20 summit, but sticking points remain in regards to dairy. Note, choppy oil prices have hardly helped the Loonie slide to fresh multi-month lows around 1.3330.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK &ndash; Significantly weaker than expected Swedish retail sales were overshadowed by NIER&rsquo;s upgraded outlook on inflation. Furthermore, Swedbank played down the data and suspect retail sales will bounce back in November amid support by shopping due to Black Friday sales. However, EUR/SEK failed to rally above 10.3000 and trades within a range of 10.2870-10.2590, while technical warn fresh weakness if the pair were to breach 10.2584, adding that a move above 10.3470 is need to ease pressure. Looking ahead, Dec 12th&rsquo;s inflation data will be a key point for the central bank in regards to hiking in either Dec or Feb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &shy; - Edging closer to 114.00 vs. the buck with heavy option expiries around 113.50-55 (1.47bln) and 114.00 (1.9bln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &ndash; Mostly weaker as the greenback hold firm with RUB as the standout underperformer amid the ongoing escalation between Russia and Ukraine, though Germany and France stated they are against stricter Russian sanctions for now, while there were witness reports of a Russian minesweeper ship heading towards the Sea of Azov share by Russia and Ukraine. On the flip side, the Russian Central Bank governor emerged earlier with a hawkish tilt whilst keeping options open for the next meeting. Note, USD/RUB is at 67.4000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.4%) and WTI (-0.1%) are lower heading into the US open after initially trading positive. A larger than expected build in API crude stockpiles of +3.453mln compared to the expected build of +0.8mln had little impact on the price rebound at the time. Additionally, three North Sea forties crude cargoes which were scheduled to load in December have been cancelled due to the temporary closure of the 150,000 BPD capacity Buzzard oilfield. Saudi Energy minister Al Falih stated this morning that Saudi will not and cannot reduce output on their own, and is hopeful that upcoming meetings will result in agreement to stabilise the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is slightly lower as the dollar continues to firm, although the yellow metal has rebounded from lows of USD 1211.3/oz in the previous session. Separately, copper is higher following a 3-session decline although, gains for the metal have been restricted by ongoing US-China tensions, with the most recent comments coming from White House Economic Advisor Kudlow saying that US President Trump is prepared to raise tariffs if G20 talks are not constructive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump reportedly floated the possibility of removing troops from Middle-East and said oil prices are low now. US President Trump also said he called the Saudis when oil was at USD 82/bbl and &#39;let him have it&#39; about oil. (Washington Post)<br /><br />Goldman Sachs said iron ore price correction is mostly complete. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih states that oil market volatility has been amplified by geopolitics. Hopeful that upcoming meetings will reach a consensus to stabilise the market. Saudi will not and cannot reduce output on their own. Declines to comment on whether an output reduction would exceed 1.4mln bpd. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nigerian Oil Minister Kachikwu says that OPEC+ will take the necessary action in order to stabilise prices; adding that Nigeria has raised output since last exemption and the country is very committed to working with OPEC.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core bonds have drifted down from best levels with the 10 year UK benchmark perhaps taking heed of a rare endorsement of PM May&rsquo;s Brexit blueprint from Cabinet colleague, but also losing some technical momentum having inched closer to, but not quite testing major chart resistance at 123.40 (123.36 peak, +29 ticks).&nbsp; However, Gilts are still marginally outpacing Bunds that appear to be conscious of the renewed bid in BTPs to just over 124.00 in wake of latest comments from Italian Finance Minister Tria acknowledging that the Government needs take into account jittery financial markets and EU concerns when it comes to its fiscal policy. Hence, the core Eurozone bond has not really benefited from what was a well received auction by all the traditional measures, and it seems as though US Treasuries are also wary about upcoming 7 year issuance along with some top tier data and Fed&rsquo;s Powell of course.</p>\r\n",

The most recent interjection came from White House Economic Adviser Kudlow who commented that Trump is open to a deal with China and that the raising of tariffs to 25% is not a &quot;certainty&quot; but&nbsp; will be implemented if no constructive talks occur at the G20. In terms of sector specifics, IT names are the clear outperformers at this stage of the session with Wirecard (+1.3%) and Dialog Semiconductor (+3.1%) notable gainers in the tech-space after trying to recoup recent losses with not much else in the way of key newsflow. Noteworthy individual movers include EDF (+3.1%) with shares buoyed by reports that that a potential increase in the French government&rsquo;s stake in the Co. would take place next year. To the downside, Tenaris (-8.2%), sit at the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the Co.&rsquo;s chairman was indicted in a graft case, whilst Continental shares (-5.4%) have been weighed on by negative comments from Redburn who have warned over the group&rsquo;s EBIT prospects in 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Off bet levels but retaining an underlying bid with supportive month end flows alongside HIA and SOMA redemption (24.9bln comes due on Friday) all impacting, while market participants keep a close eye on Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s speech scheduled for later today where he may stop the USD in its tracks or exacerbate the rally. The index has gained more ground above 97.000 to just over 97.500 before losing some momentum but still on the course to challenge the YTD high at 97.693, technically if not fundamentally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP, AUD, NZD &ndash; All consolidating after recent losses vs. the buck with cable trying to revisit 1.2800 after UK Environment Minister Gove noted that UK PM May&rsquo;s deal is the best on the table and offset some of the earlier Brexit negativity that was prompted by the latest piece via The Sun which stated that meaningful vote could results in a 200 vote defeat in parliament and with some cabinet ministers seeing zero chance of the draft passing. Separately, a cable forecast which took the average of 18 banks&rsquo; views of cable post-parliament vote show a 55% chance of a rejection and the pair reaching 1.25, while an approval could boost cable up to 1.34. Meanwhile, UK Chancellor Hammond said the government are to publish a summary of the legal advice on Brexit, which will ruffle some feathers amongst hardcore Brexiteers as MPs passed a motion two weeks ago that ordered ministers to provide legal advice in full on PM May&rsquo;s deal. Elsewhere, antipodeans are faring better vs. the greenback again with AUD/NZD trading flat within a tight range and as NZD tests 0.6800 to the upside amid the RBNZ FSR release overnight in which they eased loan-to-value ratio restriction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &ndash; More choppy trade for the single currency with EUR/USD trading around the middle of a 1.1267-1.1304 range having taken out stops at 1.1275. Italian politics keep weighing on the currency with the European Commission unimpressed as it will begin disciplinary actions on Italy regarding debt before Christmas. EU Commissioner Dombrovskis also added that a cut of 0.2% of the 2019 budget target is not enough. EUR/USD is being drawn towards a large amount of option expiries between 1.1275 &ndash; 1.1300 (1.5bln). Looking ahead, markets will be keeping a close eye on the budget discussion between the Italian PM, two Deputy PM and Finance Minister for any hints of a budge towards EC&rsquo;s direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &ndash; Another victim of the USD strength and global trade jitters as Trump&rsquo;s economic advisor Kudlow said the USMCA agreement is to be signed on Friday at the G20 summit, but sticking points remain in regards to dairy. Note, choppy oil prices have hardly helped the Loonie slide to fresh multi-month lows around 1.3330.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK &ndash; Significantly weaker than expected Swedish retail sales were overshadowed by NIER&rsquo;s upgraded outlook on inflation. Furthermore, Swedbank played down the data and suspect retail sales will bounce back in November amid support by shopping due to Black Friday sales. However, EUR/SEK failed to rally above 10.3000 and trades within a range of 10.2870-10.2590, while technical warn fresh weakness if the pair were to breach 10.2584, adding that a move above 10.3470 is need to ease pressure. Looking ahead, Dec 12th&rsquo;s inflation data will be a key point for the central bank in regards to hiking in either Dec or Feb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &shy; - Edging closer to 114.00 vs. the buck with heavy option expiries around 113.50-55 (1.47bln) and 114.00 (1.9bln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &ndash; Mostly weaker as the greenback hold firm with RUB as the standout underperformer amid the ongoing escalation between Russia and Ukraine, though Germany and France stated they are against stricter Russian sanctions for now, while there were witness reports of a Russian minesweeper ship heading towards the Sea of Azov share by Russia and Ukraine. On the flip side, the Russian Central Bank governor emerged earlier with a hawkish tilt whilst keeping options open for the next meeting. Note, USD/RUB is at 67.4000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED</strong> <strong>INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core bonds have drifted down from best levels with the 10 year UK benchmark perhaps taking heed of a rare endorsement of PM May&rsquo;s Brexit blueprint from Cabinet colleague, but also losing some technical momentum having inched closer to, but not quite testing major chart resistance at 123.40 (123.36 peak, +29 ticks).&nbsp; However, Gilts are still marginally outpacing Bunds that appear to be conscious of the renewed bid in BTPs to just over 124.00 in wake of latest comments from Italian Finance Minister Tria acknowledging that the Government needs take into account jittery financial markets and EU concerns when it comes to its fiscal policy.

A larger than expected build in API crude stockpiles of +3.453mln compared to the expected build of +0.8mln had little impact on the price rebound at the time. Additionally, three North Sea forties crude cargoes which were scheduled to load in December have been cancelled due to the temporary closure of the 150,000 BPD capacity Buzzard oilfield. Saudi Energy minister Al Falih stated this morning that Saudi will not and cannot reduce output on their own, and is hopeful that upcoming meetings will result in agreement to stabilise the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is slightly lower as the dollar continues to firm, although the yellow metal has rebounded from lows of USD 1211.3/oz in the previous session. Separately, copper is higher following a 3-session decline although, gains for the metal have been restricted by ongoing US-China tensions, with the most recent comments coming from White House Economic Advisor Kudlow saying that US President Trump is prepared to raise tariffs if G20 talks are not constructive.</p>\r\n",

Hence, the core Eurozone bond has not really benefited from what was a well received auction by all the traditional measures, and it seems as though US Treasuries are also wary about upcoming 7 year issuance along with some top tier data and Fed&rsquo;s Powell of course.</p>\r\n",

Gilts and Short Sterling may have derived some support/traction from a firmer rebound in Bunds, now up to 161.18 (+16 ticks vs -8 ticks at the early Eurex low), but the renewed bid looks more Brexit-related as the odds on getting a thumbs up from Parliament for the draft withdrawal agreement seemingly get longer by the day (200 vote defeat now predicted by some in the media). From a technical perspective, 123.40 remains the nearest chart resistance level, and for the 10 year German benchmark bulls will now be looking towards yesterday&rsquo;s Eurex intraday high at 161.21 ahead of 161.33 having filled a gap to 161.02.</p>\r\n",

The marginally softer tone on balance is in line with US Treasuries and reflects some signs of mediation on the US-China trade front, but Bunds are also monitoring Italian BTPs that are waning after a fairly limp attempt to trade higher following reports that the EU is not satisfied with a 0.2% point cut in the 2019 deficit and will press ahead with excessive deficit measures before year end unless the budget is revised further. Note, Italy&rsquo;s PM Conte is due to meet EU&rsquo;s Barnier later. Prior to that, the Eurozone data focus falls on M3, but supply is likely to be more pivotal in terms of price action as Eur2 bn Bunds are on offer ahead of the 7 year note US auction, and only an hour after potentially key comments from Fed chair Powell.</p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) outperformed as the index coat-tailed on the recent advances in USD/JPY, while ASX 200 (-0.1%) was subdued by weakness in miners after the metals complex felt the brunt of the recent USD strength and with financials subdued by AMP Capital amid risk of further mischarging cases and provisions. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) were higher but with price action choppy in early trade amid tentativeness heading into the Trump-Xi showdown at this week&rsquo;s G20 and as participants mulled over various comments from officials including White House Economic Adviser Kudlow who affirmed that Trump could hike tariffs if no constructive talks occur at G20 and that the White House is disappointed in China&#39;s response to the trade issue.

Furthermore, there were reports that China&rsquo;s Ambassador to the US warned of dire consequences if the trade war leads to economic separation and that China prefers a negotiated solution, while the Ambassador warned that China will retaliate in proportion to any US sanctions regarding Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is said to have backed down regarding attempts to stop lawmakers from making changes to her Brexit plan which would mean that MPs will be able to vote on potential changes to her plans, while there were separate reports that UK PM May is to block publication of full Brexit legal advice.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French Finance Minister Le Maire is reportedly calling for deeper tax cuts than originally planned. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback remained firm and above the 97.00 level following the recent strength against its major counterparts in which EUR/USD slipped below 1.1300 and GBP/USD collapsed through support at the 1.2800 level. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies were range-bound after having recovered from the prior day&rsquo;s lows with the rebound mirroring similar price action in oil, while USD/JPY was steady and in closer proximity to the 114.00 handle after having benefitted from the USD strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S&amp;P affirmed Canada at AAA/A-1+; outlook stable.

(Washington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Economic Advisor Kudlow said President Trump means what he says in which he could hike tariffs if no constructive talks occur at G20 and that the White House is disappointed in China&#39;s response to trade issues.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mostly positive following a similar lead from Wall St. but with the session initially mired by lingering uncertainty regarding US-China trade relations. Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) outperformed as the index coat-tailed on the recent advances in USD/JPY, while ASX 200 (-0.1%) was subdued by weakness in miners after the metals complex felt the brunt of the recent USD strength and with financials subdued by AMP Capital amid risk of further mischarging cases and after it confirmed a AUD 425mln pretax additional advice remediation provision. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) were higher but with price action choppy in early trade amid tentativeness heading into the Trump-Xi showdown at this week&rsquo;s G20 and as participants mulled over various comments from officials including White House Economic Adviser Kudlow who affirmed that Trump could hike tariffs if no constructive talks occur at G20 and that the White House is disappointed in China&#39;s response to the trade issue. However, Kudlow also noted that Trump is open to a deal with China and there were recent comments from China&rsquo;s Vice Premier Liu that China wants a negotiated solution on trade based on mutual respect. Finally, 10yr JGBs weakened amid a lacklustre tone in T-note futures and with the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the bond market overshadowed by the outperformance of Japanese stocks.</p>\r\n",

Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) is higher with the index coat-tailing on the recent advances in USD/JPY, while ASX 200 (-0.1%) is subdued by weakness in miners after the metals complex felt the brunt of the recent USD strength and with financials led lower by AMP Capital amid risk of further mischarging cases and after it confirmed a AUD 425mln pretax additional advice remediation provision. Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) trade indecisive with participants tentative heading into the Trump-Xi showdown at this week&rsquo;s G20. There were various comments from officials including White House Economic Adviser Kudlow who affirmed that Trump could hike tariffs if no constructive talks occur at G20 and that the White House is disappointed in China&#39;s response to the trade issue, although Kudlow further noted that Trump is open to a deal with China and there were also comments from China&rsquo;s Vice Premier Liu that China wants a negotiated solution on trade which is based on mutual respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback remains firmer and above the 97.00 level following the recent strength against its major counterparts in which EUR/USD slipped below 1.1300 and GBP/USD collapsed through support at the 1.2800 level. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies are range-bound after having recovered from the prior day&rsquo;s lows with the rebound mirroring similar price action in oil, while USD/JPY is steady and in closer proximity to the 114.00 handle after having benefitted from the USD strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat as the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the bond market is counterbalanced by the outperformance in Japanese stocks and amid quiet trade also observed in T-note futures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
