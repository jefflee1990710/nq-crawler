Negativity was later piled on my DUP Lawmaker Donaldson who said it looked like the UK was &ldquo;heading for a no deal&rdquo;. Some GBP solace was found in later trade, however, after Brexit Minister Raab said &ldquo;thumbs up&rdquo; post-cabinet meeting (cooling speculation over his resignation) and Welsh Secretary Cairns said, &ldquo;everyone is united behind the PM&rdquo;. In later trade, BBC sources state that senior UK Minsters have agreed they want to reach a Brexit deal with the EU by the end of November. Traders are now looking to the next cabinet meeting, where multiple source reports have specified conflicting times on the next scheduled meeting, with these raging from the end of the week, to nothing being scheduled as of yet</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> EU&#39;s Moscovici said to expect a strong and precise answer from Italy on November 13th whilst warning that the next steps on the Italian budget will depend on their response; he also didn&rsquo;t exclude the possibility of sanctions making clear they can still be imposed on the country if there is no compromise on the budget. EU&#39;s Dombrovskis also echoed Moscovici&rsquo;s comments adding the EU commission is open to a dialogue with Italy whilst urging for substantial changes on the budget. On Italy&rsquo;s side, Italian Economy Minister Tria stated that there are some disagreements, but we are still open to dialogue with the European Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.62% at 2755, NDX +0.75% at 6989, DJI +0.69% at 25637. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.34%, Materials +1.53%, Industrials +1.11%, Cons Discretionary +0.54%, Cons Staples +0.56%, Healthcare +0.51%, Financials +0.52%, Tech +0.61%, Telecoms +0.60%, Utilities +0.76%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Mylan (MYL) and CVS Health (CVS) were top movers today, pulling up the healthcare sector, after both reported EPS above street estimates. We saw strong earnings also from Mosaic (MOS), TransDigm (TDG) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) which all traded higher. Not all earnings were upbeat though, Eli Lilly (LLY) pared back previous gains from its strong earnings to become a bottom mover on the day. Ralph Lauren (RL) tumbled after reporting gross margin pressures despite beating EPS and revenue estimates. Marriott International (MAR) traded lower following a miss on revenue estimates and slowing demand, helping bring down other names in the sector such as Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Host Hotels (HST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.89 LOWER AT USD 62.21/BBL, BRENT (F8) SETTLES USD 1.04 LOWER AT USD 72.13/BBL.</strong> Oil prices fell today, following on from yesterday&rsquo;s drop on the back of US-Iran sanction waivers. The waivers were revealed to be 180-day exemptions for the eight countries which contribute a combined 75% of Iran&rsquo;s oil exports, leaving much more supply in the market than originally thought. Turkish President Erdogan announced that Turkey would not abide by the sanctions, citing that they were aimed at &ldquo;unbalancing the world&rdquo; and the Spanish Finance Minister also announced that Spain refuses to accept a US &ldquo;ultimatum&rdquo; on Iran. US EIA cut 2019 world oil demand forecast by 50,000bpd to 1.44mln bpd YY and left the 2018 figure unchanged at 1.52mln bpd YY, whilst it forecasted 2018 US oil demand to rise by 510,000 bpd (up from 450,000 bpd previously) and 2019&rsquo;s demand to rise by 220,000 bpd (cut from 230,000 bpd previously). This week inventories are seen Crude +2.4mln, Cushing +36k, distillates -2.6mln, gasoline -2.3mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 4+ TICKS LOWER AT 118-00.</strong> Treasuries finished Tuesday&rsquo;s session lower ahead of mid-term election results due overnight; Informa notes &lsquo;if Republican gain more than a slim majority, we could see higher yields even under a divided Congress&rsquo;.&nbsp; Most of the actions was in the front end and belly of the curve were yields were higher by c.2bps whilst longer dated yield were higher by c.1bps at settlement. &nbsp;2s30s and 10s30s narrowed by c.2bps.The US Treasury sold USD 27bln in 10yr notes stopping through by 1.2bps at a high yield of 3.209%. Demand was average for the auction as indicated by the bid-to-cover which posted at 2.54x. Direct bidders took the smallest share since February 2011, while indirects were awarded a record share of 10yr notes; finally dealers took a portion slightly below recent averages. The US Treasury will sell USD 19bln in 30yr bonds on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Greenback is mixed vs almost all major peers ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s US mid-term election results and potential for change in the House that would see President Trump&rsquo;s Republicans lose full control of congress. The DXY had gradually drifted down from circa 96.450 as some G10 counterparts outperformed but it clawed these losses back to trade essentially unchanged on the day</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, GBP, NZD:&nbsp;</strong> All off best levels, but still clearly ahead of their main rivals as the Aud consolidates near the top of a 0.7240-05 range in wake of an upbeat economic assessment from the RBA overnight. Meanwhile, unity and solidarity within the UK Cabinet rather than disharmony and more resignations are underpinning the Pound, with Cable inching closer towards 1.3100 at one stage and Eur/Gbp getting nearer to 0.8720 stops. However, Brexit deal hopes were dealt another blow as the EU&rsquo;s latest back-stop offer and &lsquo;Independent Mechanism&rsquo; vs indefinite customs arrangement to resolve the NI border issue did not receive a warm welcome mand the prospects of a summit later this month to finalise and accord remain remote, or in the balance. Back down under, the Kiwi continues to face headwinds ahead of 0.6700, and cross-winds as Aud/Nzd holds above 1.0800, with yet another fall in GDT auction prices before NZ Q3 jobs and labour cost data later tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, EUR: </strong>Both firmer vs the Usd, albeit modestly, with the Franc still restrained between 1.0020-55 parameters and single currency unable to push much further above 1.1400, although it did absorb supply at 1.1425 on its way to almost 1.1440 at best, and not that far from the next key upside chart targets from 1.1456-60 despite ongoing Italian-EU budget discrepancies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CAD: </strong>Bucking the overall trend, but relatively rangebound between 113.10-45 and 1.3100-40 respectively, with the Loonie not deriving any support/benefit from in line with forecast Canadian building permits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>The Try recoiled further to sharply underperform other regional currencies having failed to breach 5.3000 vs the Usd with the aid of hawkish CBRT commentary to retest 5.4000+ levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: </strong>US midterm elections (6 November 2018). Voting to take place Tuesday on 6 November, with polls closing at 8pm local time(s). The base case is for Republicans to retain the Senate, while Democrats are seen winning the House. Democrats taking the House could be a &#39;market-unfriendly&#39; scenario. Key issues for markets are Tax Reform 2.0 and Trade policy. Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</p>\r\n",

Turkish President Erdogan announced that Turkey would not abide by the sanctions, citing that they were aimed at &ldquo;unbalancing the world&rdquo; and the Spanish Finance Minister also announced that Spain refuses to accept a US &ldquo;ultimatum&rdquo; on Iran.

        "subject": "AUCTION PREVIEW: US to sell USD 27bln 10yr Note Auction",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 83bln in 3-year (USD 37bln, Monday), 10-year (USD 27bln, Tuesday), and 30-year (USD 19bln, Wednesday). With USD 54.3bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, the auctions are set to raise USD 28.7bln of new supply. TD Securities also notes that there will be USD 34.3bln of SOMA holdings maturing at the mid-month, and the Fed set to add-on USD 7.6bln to 3s, USD 5.5bln to 10s, and USD 3.9bln to the 30s; TD also notes that the Fed balance sheet run-off hit full pace last month, with the central bank now allowing USD 30bln to roll-off per month. Looking at this week&#39;s auctions as a whole, TD Securities says &quot;higher yields and equity market volatility present an interesting opportunity for investors to dip their toes in longend rates,&quot; and &quot;the steepening of the curve also represents an opportunity for investors to re-engage in flatteners, particularly as growth momentum remains strong (as evidenced by Friday&#39;s payroll data).&quot; But TD does note that the previous cycle of auctions a fortnight ago suggested some softness in direct bidder participation, and as of late, dealer inventories have also risen in recent weeks, and the bank believes that could suggest the potential for upward pressure on rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 30yr:</strong> Recent history shows weaker demand on the back of a sudden rise in yields with the last bid-to-cover falling to 2.39x, close to levels seen back in February when volatility was elevated, Barclays notes. In general, auctions have been well received with averaging tails of 0.1bps vs. 0.4bps in 2017. Looking at participation, 10yr auctions have attracted large interest from domestic investors which is above 50% this year vs. 40% in 2015 whilst foreign demand has been declining, somehow providing an offset. TD Securities suggests &ldquo;the backup in rates this month should help support demand&rsquo; this week; they further notes &rdquo;&lsquo;averages point to a stop on the screws and 73% buy side takedown (62% to indirects and 11% to directs)&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent Auction History:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Tail size: (Prev. tail by 0.3bps, six-auction average: stops-through by 0.1bps)</li>\r\n  <li>High-yield (Prev. 3.225%, six-auction average: 2.993%)</li>\r\n  <li>Dealers (Prev. 30.1%, six-auction average: 26.7%)</li>\r\n  <li>Directs % (Prev. 5.4%, six-auction average: 10.9%)</li>\r\n  <li>Indirects (Prev. 64.5%, six-auction average: 62.3%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Meanwhile the SMI (Unch) outperforms with the index lifted by Adecco (+3.0%) post-earnings. In terms of sectors, industrials are benefitting from the lower base metal prices, while telecom names lag.&nbsp; Moving onto individual equities, Zalando (-9.0%) is the worst performing stock following their earnings, with Morrisons (-6.0%) also lower on the back of their number.

Cable continues ride high on a wave of Brexit deal optimism amidst more reports of an EU offer on the Irish border, and the latest proposal under the guise of an &lsquo;Independent Mechanism&rsquo; that would allow the UK options to terminate the temporary customs arrangement. Cable has extended gains to test and briefly eclipse resistance around 1.3080, while Eur/Gbp has slipped further below 0.8750 to just a handful of pips from reported stops at 0.8720 and Gbp/Jpy breached its 200 DMA and 148.00 before losing some momentum. Meanwhile, the Aud has been boosted by relatively upbeat RBA commentary overnight following its monetary policy meeting with 2018 and 2019 growth seen stronger than previously and a tighter labour market expected to lift wages. Hence, Aud/Usd appears firmer above the 0.7200 handle that has been tough to overcome, and eyeing 0.7250 next, while Aud/Nzd has bounced from near 1.0800 to touch 1.0850, as Nzd/Usd remains capped ahead of 0.6700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/JPY/CAD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, which is trading cautiously ahead of today&rsquo;s US mid-term elections, with the DXY hovering just above 96.200, as the single currency runs into offers around 1.1425 and ongoing Italian-EU budget issues that are preventing a more concerted attempt on technical resistance around 1.1456-60. Meanwhile, the traditional currency safe-havens, Chf and Jpy remain rangebound between 1.0055-35 and 113.20-45 with the latter looking at a key Fib (circa 113.34) on a closing basis for technical direction. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost some of its BoC impetus as oil prices sag again, but could derive more independent pointers from Canadian building permits later.

So far, China is allowed to buy around 360K BPD of Iranian oil for 180 days, with source reports noting that conditions require the disclosures of counter-parties and settlement methods. Elsewhere, India is allowed to purchase of up 300k BPD of oil, while South Korea was granted a 200k BPD oil waiver. Additionally, comments from US President Trump that he wants to impose the sanctions gradually to prevent shocks to the market, may have contributed to the price decrease.

The last leg-up appears to have been prompted by, or at least coincided with Brexit no deal talk from the DUP, and indeed even Gilts recovered more lost ground to trade at 121.85, +7 ticks vs -22 ticks) before fading into the DMO&rsquo;s 2028 auction, which was reasonable in the current uncertain circumstances. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are a fraction firmer in outright terms and the curve essentially flat pre-10 year supply, which prefaces the mid-term results and Thursday&rsquo;s FOMC.</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile the SMI (Unch) outperforms with the index lifted by Adecco (+3.7%) post-earnings.&nbsp;In terms of sectors, industrials are benefitting from the lower base metal prices, while telecom names lag.&nbsp; Moving onto individual equities, Zalando (-6.0%) is the worst performing stock following their earnings, with Morrisons (-5.0%) also lower on the back of their number. IWG (+7.0%) are out in front following optimistic earnings and conformation of their guidance, while FTSE heavyweight Associated British Food (+2.5%) in the green after the company said they expect an increase in retail profit after reporting their earnings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/AUD/NZD - Different day, but familiar feel or trend in G10 land, as Sterling rivals the Antipodean Dollars for major honours. Cable continues ride high on a wave of Brexit deal optimism amidst more reports of an EU offer on the Irish border, and the latest proposal under the guise of an &lsquo;Independent Mechanism&rsquo; that would allow the UK options to terminate the temporary customs arrangement. Cable has extended gains to test and briefly eclipse resistance around 1.3080, while Eur/Gbp has slipped further below 0.8750 to just a handful of pips from reported stops at 0.8720 and Gbp/Jpy breached its 200 DMA and 148.00 before losing some momentum. Meanwhile, the Aud has been boosted by relatively upbeat RBA commentary overnight following its monetary policy meeting with 2018 and 2019 growth seen stronger than previously and a tighter labour market expected to lift wages. Hence, Aud/Usd appears firmer above the 0.7200 handle that has been tough to overcome, and eyeing 0.7250 next, while Aud/Nzd has bounced from near 1.0800 to touch 1.0850, as Nzd/Usd remains capped ahead of 0.6700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/JPY/CAD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, which is trading cautiously ahead of today&rsquo;s US mid-term elections, with the DXY hovering just above 96.200, as the single currency runs into offers around 1.1425 and ongoing Italian-EU budget issues that are preventing a more concerted attempt on technical resistance around 1.1456-60. Meanwhile, the traditional currency safe-havens, Chf and Jpy remain rangebound between 1.0055-35 and 113.20-45 with the latter looking at a key Fib (circa 113.34) on a closing basis for technical direction. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost some of its BoC impetus as oil prices sag again, but could derive more independent pointers from Canadian building permits later. Usd/Cad now back above 1.3100 and climbing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Some loss of momentum after Monday&rsquo;s broad outperformance vs the Usd, but the Try did derive more support earlier to trade within a whisker of 5.3000 on hawkish rhetoric from the CBRT that sounded confident about hitting its inflation target via tight monetary policy, even though Turkish CPI accelerated further above in October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds were already reversing more of their early Eurex losses, partly, if not mainly on the back of inverse-correlations to BTPs (back down below 122.00), but some technical buying seems to have contributed to the rebound as chart gaps were filled before a stop-chase and short-squeeze pushed the 10 year German bond through 160.00, albeit just at 160.04 (+30 ticks vs -13 ticks at one stage). The last leg-up appears to have been prompted by, or at least coincided with Brexit no deal talk from the DUP, and indeed even Gilts recovered more lost ground to trade at 121.85, +7 ticks vs -22 ticks) before fading into the DMO&rsquo;s 2028 auction, which was reasonable in the current uncertain circumstances. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are a fraction firmer in outright terms and the curve essentially flat pre-10 year supply, which prefaces the mid-term results and Thursday&rsquo;s FOMC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.4%) and Brent (-0.5%) are both lower as details of the US waivers on Iranian oil emerge. So far, China is allowed to buy around 360K BPD of Iranian oil for 180 days, with source reports noting that conditions require the disclosures of counter-parties and settlement methods. Elsewhere, India is allowed to purchase of up 300k BPD of oil, while South Korea was granted a 200k BPD oil waiver. Additionally, comments from US President Trump that he wants to impose the sanctions gradually to prevent shocks to the market, may have contributed to the price decrease. Traders will be eyeing the weekly API crude inventories released later today as a fresh catalyst for prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.2%) has been gradually rising throughout the session as the yellow metal detaches itself from USD influence to act as a safe haven, meanwhile copper is lower and moving in tandem to the risk tone. Separately, aluminium associations from the US, Canada and Mexico have urged their governments to agree a deal which eliminates US aluminium tariffs from Canada and Mexico without the imposition of import quotas.</p>\r\n",

Cable continues ride high on a wave of Brexit deal optimism amidst more reports of an EU offer on the Irish border, and the latest proposal under the guise of an &lsquo;Independent Mechanism&rsquo; that would allow the UK options to terminate the temporary customs arrangement. Cable has extended gains to test and briefly eclipse resistance around 1.3080, while Eur/Gbp has slipped further below 0.8750 to just a handful of pips from reported stops at 0.8720 and Gbp/Jpy breached its 200 DMA and 148.00 before losing some momentum. Meanwhile, the Aud has been boosted by relatively upbeat RBA commentary overnight following its monetary policy meeting with 2018 and 2019 growth seen stronger than previously and a tighter labour market expected to lift wages. Hence, Aud/Usd appears firmer above the 0.7200 handle that has been tough to overcome, and eyeing 0.7250 next, while Aud/Nzd has bounced from near 1.0800 to touch 1.0850, as Nzd/Usd remains capped ahead of 0.6700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/JPY/CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, which is trading cautiously ahead of today&rsquo;s US mid-term elections, with the DXY hovering just above 96.200, as the single currency runs into offers around 1.1425 and ongoing Italian-EU budget issues that are preventing a more concerted attempt on technical resistance around 1.1456-60. Meanwhile, the traditional currency safe-havens, Chf and Jpy remain rangebound between 1.0055-35 and 113.20-45 with the latter looking at a key Fib (circa 113.34) on a closing basis for technical direction. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost some of its BoC impetus as oil prices sag again, but could derive more independent pointers from Canadian building permits later. Usd/Cad now back above 1.3100 and climbing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some loss of momentum after Monday&rsquo;s broad outperformance vs the Usd, but the Try did derive more support earlier to trade within a whisker of 5.3000 on hawkish rhetoric from the CBRT that sounded confident about hitting its inflation target via tight monetary policy, even though Turkish CPI accelerated further above in October.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy Finance Minister Tria signalled to euro zone ministers he was working for compromise on the budget with the EU, while Tria stated the Italian 2019 draft budget won&#39;t change but debt will fall. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were quiet overnight amid a tentative tone heading into the upcoming key events including today&rsquo;s US mid-term elections and the FOMC later this week. As such, the greenback was relatively flat but attempted to gently nurse some of the recent losses, while its counterparts held on to most the prior day&rsquo;s gains with EUR/USD around 1.1400 and GBP/USD unfazed by the conflicting Brexit-related news at the 1.3000 handle. Elsewhere, antipodeans were steady with AUD only marginally supported following the RBA rate decision where it maintained the Cash Rate Target as expected but revised growth forecasts slightly higher, while USD/JPY and JPY crosses were higher on safe-haven outflows as stocks in Tokyo outperformed the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA kept the Cash Rate Target unchanged at 1.50%, as expected. RBA reiterated low rates are supporting the economy and that progress on inflation and unemployment is expected to be gradual. RBA also commented that GDP growth forecast was revised higher slightly for 2018 and 2019, while it added that business conditions and outlook for labour market remains positive. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were rangebound overnight amid a stable greenback and mixed risk tone in which WTI crude futures languished below the USD 63.00/bbl after having failed on Monday to sustain the initial upside in the wake of the re-imposed sanctions on Iran, amid exemptions and Trump jawboning. Gold were also flat with price action contained amid tentativeness heading into today&rsquo;s mid-term elections, while copper also traded sideways amid the indecisiveness in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he wants to go slower on Iranian sanctions and does not want to raise oil prices. (Newswires)<br /><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Treasuries were only marginally higher on Monday as investors were cautious ahead of the mid-term elections tomorrow and ahead of the FOMC rate decision due on Thursday. The yield curve saw some modest bull-flattening with yields on the short-end of the curve pivoting around the unchanged mark whilst longer dated yields were lower by c.2bps at settlement. 2s30s narrowed by c.3bps and 2s10s by c.2bps.The US treasury sold USD 37bln in 3yr notes tailing by 0.3bps at a high yield of 2.983%. Demand was soft as the bid-to-cover came in at 2.54x, well below recent averages and the lowest since July. Directs took the smallest portion since December 2009, indirects were awarded the biggest share since June whilst dealers were left with the largest share since July. US T-note futures (Z8) settled at 118-05+.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.0%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) traded higher with Australia led also by the energy sector leading as it mirrored the outperformance seen stateside, while the Japanese benchmark benefitted from recent currency weakness and rose back above the 22000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) were subdued amid ongoing trade uncertainty and after the PBoC skipped open market operations again, while notable weakness was seen in casino stocks which pulled back from recent gains.

ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) trade higher with the energy sector leading the upside in Australia as it mirrors the outperformance seen stateside, while the Japanese benchmark benefitted from recent currency weakness to reclaim the 22000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) are subdued amid ongoing trade uncertainty and after the PBoC skipped open market operations again, while notable weakness was seen in casino stocks which pulled back from recent gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are quiet overnight amid a tentative tone heading into this week&rsquo;s key events including the US mid-term elections and FOMC. As such, the greenback is relatively flat and attempts to gently nurse some of the recent losses, while its counterparts hold on to most the prior day&rsquo;s gains with EUR/USD and GBP/USD at the 1.1400 and 1.3000 handles respectively. Elsewhere, antipodeans are steady with focus for AUD shifting to the upcoming RBA rate decision later where no major fireworks are expected, while USD/JPY and JPY crosses are higher on safe-haven outflows as stocks in Tokyo outperform the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lacklustre after weakness seen in T-notes and with demand subdued by the strength in Japanese stocks.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The RBA are to announce its latest policy decision later in which the central bank is unanimously expected to keep rates on hold at the record low 1.5% where they have been for more than 2 years, while the board is highly anticipated to retain its view of no strong case for a near-term rate move and that the next move is likely to be upwards. These expectations have been reflected through ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures which price in 100% expectations of no change in the Cash Rate Target, while its implied yield curve suggests February 2020 as the earliest date for when the curve is leaning more towards a hike.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments from the RBA have been few and far between since the last meeting, although Deputy Governor Debelle had suggested an optimistic view on the labour market and anticipated employment to increase at above trend for the next 6 months but was less so regarding pick up in wages. In addition, RBA&#39;s&nbsp;Harper stated a near-term rate increase would spook consumers, while Governor&nbsp;Lowe previously commented that they have been hoping for higher US rates for a while. This would suggest the RBA is no rush to tighten policy and are more than willing to reap the benefits to the economy from a weaker currency against the greenback as the Fed continues its hiking cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent data releases have been mixed&nbsp;as CPI figures in Q3 either printed inline or softer than expected at 1.9% which were all below the RBA&#39;s 2-3% inflation target. The latest Employment Change data also disappointed in which 5.6k vs. Exp. 15.0k jobs were added, although this coincided with a surprise decline in the Unemployment Rate to&nbsp;5.0% vs. Exp. 5.3% (Prev. 5.3%) due to a similar percentage point decline in the Participation Rate to 65.4%. Furthermore, Retail Sales data fell short of estimates for September and Q3, while Trade Surplus topped forecasts and PPI printed at multi-year highs. As such, these varied releases would&nbsp;support the case for a wait and see approach, while external factors such as uncertainty regarding US-China trade also adds to likelihood of the RBA remaining on the sidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&#39;s decision is due out&nbsp;at 0330GMT/2130CST/1130HKT following the recent clock changes, although no major fireworks are expected unless the central bank significantly deviates from its all-too familiar rehashed statements.</p>\r\n",
