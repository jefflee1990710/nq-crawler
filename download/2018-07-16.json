        "content": "<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Commerce Ministry said that China filed a complaint to WTO regarding the US proposed tariff list on USD 200bln worth of Chinese goods. In related news, the US challenged China, EU, Canada, Mexico and Turkey for &ldquo;illegal tariffs&rdquo;, while there were also reports that Mexico said it will take defensive actions and respond to US trade measures.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK government spokesperson earlier confirmed the acceptance of Brexiteer/ERG amendments that were consistent with policy, in which the amendments included no NI customs border, no fast track capacity to form customs union, leaving EU VAT regime and limiting capacity to collect tariff revenue for EU without reciprocity. However, some Conservative MPs were said to vote against the government because of anger that ministers have given into Brexiteers, while UK Defence Procurement Minister Guto Bebb has resigned due to ERG amendments. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notable Cross Border Tax Bill Amendment Votes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- UK House of Commons voted (316 to 289) against New Clause 11 of the Cross Border Tax Bill which would have made establishing tariff free access to the EU as a negotiating objective for the UK Government.<br />- UK House of Commons voted (316 to 36) against New Clause 16 which would have required approval from Scottish Parliament to implement some of the powers in the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- UK House of Commons voted (305 to 302) to approve New Clause 36 which prevents the UK collecting taxes on behalf of another territory or country, unless this were done on a reciprocal basis.<br />- UK House of Commons voted (303 to 300) to approve Amendment 73 which commits the Government to having a separate VAT system to the EU.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Pompeo said they could grant Iran waivers for some &lsquo;small&rsquo; transactions, while US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said US will consider exemptions in specific cases if countries are not able to reduce Iranian oil purchases to zero to meet the sanction deadlines. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is said to have raised meddling in the US elections with Russian President Putin, in which the latter reiterated Russia did not meddle in US politics, while Putin also commented that Russia and the US could work together to regulate international energy markets. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (non-voter, dove) said policymakers are focused on the flattening of the yield curve and that he is unsure whether the flattening yield curve signals a recession ahead. Furthermore, Kashkari stated that Fed is risking inverting the yield curve by continuing to hike and that there is little reason to raise rates further since doing so could trigger a recession.

Bank of America (BAC) also beat on both EPS and revenue, supported by loan growth, lower expenses, smaller tax rates. Trading revenues were up by nearly 7% to USD 3.596bln. J.B. Hunt (JBHT) also beat on both top- and bottom-lines. After the market close, numbers from Netflix (NFLX) will be published. Biotech names have been hit, mainly gene editing companies, following a new study which found the DNA damage from CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSPR) was seriously underestimated, which hit: CRSP, Editas Medicine (EDIT) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA); Crispr did pare back some of the losses, before resuming its slide, after they denied they used the methods described in the study since they were not relevant to their plans. Tesla (TSLA) closed red following a controversial tweet from CEO Elon Musk about the diver who rescued the Thai children stuck in a cave, who is now considering filing action against Musk. Boeing (BA) was higher amid various reports of orders from the Farnborough Air Show. Goldman Sachs (GS) is reportedly close to announcing David Solomon as the new CEO, which could come as soon as Tuesday. Hasbro (HAS) was hit by a downgrade at BMO, UPS (UPS) was higher after an upgrade at UBS. Amazon (AMZN) was up as its Prime Day gets underway, though did see some negative ticks in late trade on reports of a tech glitch. VF Corporation (VFC) was boosted after an upgrade at JPMorgan. The energy sector fared the worst, tracking the slide in crude prices. Financial names were up after strong earnings from Bank of America (BAC), however, Blackrock (BLK) was weak despite top- and bottom-line beats. SPX -0.12% at 2797.96, NDX -0.24% at 7357.90, DJI +0.17% at 25061.89.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields were higher across the curve in thin volume, with the curve modestly bear-steepening at settlement, which was 2s10s rise by just shy of 1bps, but still within the 25bps handle. Short-dated yields rose to highs not seen in almost a decade ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s testimony by Fed chair Powell (See below for preview). There was little by way of major moves in Treasuries after retail sales data, however, losses appeared to be scaling back in afternoon trade as equities, and more noticeably, oil found selling action. US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 6 ticks lower at 120-05+.</p>\r\n",

To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: </strong>Equities mixed, Treasuries down, oil down, dollar down.<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW: </strong>Oil crushed as supply returns; Trump criticised after Putin meeting; US retaliates after China WTO complaint; Kashkari warns Fed hikes could trigger recession.<br /><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Fed chair Powell testimony to Senate; Tuesday&rsquo;s BMO earnings UNH, JNJ, GS, PGR, PLD, SCHW; Tuesday AMC earnings KMI, TMUS; RBA minutes; UK jobs data; BOE&rsquo;s Carney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRUMP-PUTIN MEETING:</strong> While there was little new information out of the Trump/Putin meeting, aside from the platitudes about closer cooperation and efforts towards global peace, two items have captured the media narrative. 1) Trump was asked to condemn alleged Russian meddling in the US Presidential election, which he did not do, instead taking aim at Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s missing email servers. 2) Putin was asked whether he wanted US President Trump to win the election, to which he did, though denied Russia meddled. The lack of criticism by Trump against Putin is reinforcing his opponents&rsquo; view that the US President is somehow in the pocket of Russia, and in wake of the joint press conference, Trump was accused by talking heads of putting politics over national needs. Even influential GOP lawmakers (speaker Ryan, Sen Cornyn, Sen Flake, Sen Lindsey, Sen Burr) also added to the criticism, though ultimately, the market reaction was muted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>China&rsquo;s MOFCOM filed a complaint at the WTO over US President Trump&rsquo;s proposed tariffs on $200bln of Chinese goods, following up on last week&rsquo;s promise that it would immediately complain to the WTO over US unilateralism. Shortly after, the US responded, challenging five WTO members individually (China, EU, Canada, Mexico, Turkey) over what it said was &ldquo;illegal [retaliatory] tariffs&rdquo;. Trade Representative Lighthizer said that the US&rsquo; steel and aluminium tariffs were justified under international agreements, but the retaliatory measures from other countries in response were not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US RETAIL SALES: </strong>June&rsquo;s retail sales data was in line with expectations, though there were some upward revisions to May&rsquo;s data. The headline came in 0.5% MM, in line with the consensus; while the control group &ndash; which the BEA uses in its consumption spending calculation &ndash; was unchanged at 0.4%; also in line with expectations. &ldquo;The 12-month change in control group (and total) sales remains near its post-recession high-water mark. None of the rises or falls in the underlying series seem to reflect a pull forward from possible trade war effects,&rdquo; UBS said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Kashkari (non-voter, dove) said Fed policymakers are focused on the flattening yield curve, and although he was unsure about whether the narrowing signals a recession ahead, he warned that the Fed risks triggering a recession by potentially inverting the yield curve, adding that there is little reason to raise rates further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Q8) SETTLES -$2.95 AT $68.06; BRENT (U8) SETTLES -$3.49 AT $71.85. </strong>Crude was hammered, with concerns that a supply glut could return, as US considers exemptions from Iran sanctions, while refineries and ports around the globe begin coming back online. Additionally, renewed chatter in recent days of a possible release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the US ahead of the midterm elections was adding to worries of greater supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RETURNING SUPPLY:</strong> Libya&rsquo;s Sharara field (capacity 290k BPD) was said to be pumping 130k BPD (it was under 100k BPD at the end of last week, after the abduction of workers), its Waha oil field has restarted production at a 20k BPD rate, and the El-Feel field has risen to 70k BPD, according to reports. In Iraq, the Umm Qasr port was expected to be fully operational on Monday or Tuesday, according to officials, after the port was hit by civil unrest in the Sourthern oil-producing regions of the country. In Europe, Equinor is not expecting escalation of strike action to meaningfully hit output in the short-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* IRAN SANCTIONS: </strong>Iran Oil Minister says OPEC decision does not give members the right to raise their production level above targets. US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said there will be no blanket waivers on Iran sanctions, but the US will consider exemptions in certain cases if countries cannot reduce on Iran oil purchases to zero. Mnuchin emphasised that the US wants to be careful in the wind-down around energy markets as it reimposes sanctions on Iran. Mnuchin will discuss Iran sanctions with counterparts at G20 this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE INVENTORY POLL: </strong>This week, analysts are forecasting US crude stocks will draw down by 4.5mln barrels, distillates +1.2mln, gasoline -0.8mln. Stocks at the Cushing hub are seen lower by 368k (from 10/Jul) and lower by 1.3mln (from 6/Jul). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.12% at 2797.96, NDX -0.24% at 7357.90, DJI +0.17% at 25061.89. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals: +0.10%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.51%, Energy: -1.25%, Financials: +1.40, Health Care: -0.65%, Industrials: -0.46%, Materials: -0.68%, Telecoms: +0.45%, Tech: -0.31%, Utilities: -0.11%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>BlackRock (BLK) report beats on revenue and EPS, and said it saw $20bln of net inflows in Q2; CEO also said he aims to return $26bln to shareholders in the next year. Bank of America (BAC) also beat on both EPS and revenue, supported by loan growth, lower expenses, smaller tax rates. Trading revenues were up by nearly 7% to USD 3.596bln. J.B. Hunt (JBHT) also beat on both top- and bottom-lines. After the market close, numbers from Netflix (NFLX) will be published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Biotech names have been hit, mainly gene editing companies, following a new study which found the DNA damage from CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSPR) was seriously underestimated, which hit: CRSP, Editas Medicine (EDIT) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA); Crispr did pare back some of the losses, before resuming its slide, after they denied they used the methods described in the study since they were not relevant to their plans. Tesla (TSLA) closed red following a controversial tweet from CEO Elon Musk about the diver who rescued the Thai children stuck in a cave, who is now considering filing action against Musk. Boeing (BA) was higher amid various reports of orders from the Farnborough Air Show. Goldman Sachs (GS) is reportedly close to announcing David Solomon as the new CEO, which could come as soon as Tuesday. Hasbro (HAS) was hit by a downgrade at BMO, UPS (UPS) was higher after an upgrade at UBS. Amazon (AMZN) was up as its Prime Day gets underway, though did see some negative ticks in late trade on reports of a tech glitch. VF Corporation (VFC) was boosted after an upgrade at JPMorgan. The energy sector fared the worst, tracking the slide in crude prices. Financial names were up after strong earnings from Bank of America (BAC), however, Blackrock (BLK) was weak despite top- and bottom-line beats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>CNBC sources said Comcast (CMCSA) is highly unlikely to make another bid for Fox&rsquo;s (FOXA) assets and will instead focus on a bid for Sky (SKY LN). Disney (DIS) then said Fox may not choose to increase its offer for Sky. The $3.9bln acquisition of Tribune Media (TRCO) by Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) came under fire after FCC chairman said he has serious concerns about the deal and that he would put the transaction through a lengthy administrative process, which is often seen as a &lsquo;deal killer&rsquo;. Apollo (APO) and other private equity firms expressed interest in acquiring engineering company Arconic (ARNC) in a deal that could be worth more than $10bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 6 TICKS LOWER AT 120-05+. </strong>Yields were higher across the curve in thin volume, with the curve modestly bear-steepening at settlement, which was 2s10s rise by just shy of 1bps, but still within the 25bps handle. Short-dated yields rose to highs not seen in almost a decade ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s testimony by Fed chair Powell (See below for preview). There was little by way of major moves in Treasuries after retail sales data, however, losses appeared to be scaling back in afternoon trade as equities, and more noticeably, oil found selling action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The greenback is softer ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s testimony by Fed chair Powell, with profit taking cited after the buck posted its best week in a month last week. There was some mild buying after retail sales data. The EUR was stronger against the USD, JPY and GBP, and pops its head above the 1.17 handle</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Cable started the week on the front-foot, but still couldn&rsquo;t manage to break above the 1.33 handle; in afternoon trade, Brexit headlines once again slapped the pound around, after reports that the government was to accept all of the Brexiteers amendments to the Cross-Border Trade Bill, leaving scope for a harder Brexit; The news sent GBP back down to the key support at 1.3220, while EURGBP jumped to over 0.8850. There are concerns that the government will face defeat in Monday&rsquo;s vote with the pro-EU lawmakers in the Conservative Party unhappy that UK PM May conceded to the Brexiteers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>Trading in yen has been somewhat subdued on account of the Japanese being away for Marine Day, leaving CHF to receive attention as the haven-FX; the Swissy strengthened on Monday, reminding traders that the march-up in EURCHF will face challenges, with recent snap-backs on trade news flow reiterating the importance of the Franc as a hedge against trade wars. 1.1650 is the immediate support beneath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Ahead of the RBA meeting minutes overnight (and labour market data due Thursday), the Aussie is trading flat against the buck, with higher US yields and weakness in copper and crude giving the pair a slight downside bias. The consensus seems to expect the RBA to retain a cautious tone in its minutes (brief preview below). Traders will also be looking to the central bank&rsquo;s comments on AUD funding after noting in its minutes that overall global financial conditions remain expansionary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP &ndash; POWELL TESTIMONY: </strong>Fed Chair Powell Dual-Testimony to the US Senate (Tues, July 17) and the US House (Weds, July 18) Fed&rsquo;s Jerome Powell &ndash; who since his appointment as chair, has generally tended to avoid rocking the boat in his public addresses &ndash; will be testifying in his capacity as Fed chair, so will likely repeat the themes from the June FOMC meeting minutes; Powell will likely give a nod to the Fed&rsquo;s current economic and rate projections, which look for two more rate rises in 2018, as the Fed normalises policy gradually. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/headlines/primer-fed-chair-powell-dual-testimony-to-the-us-senate-tues-july-17-and-the-us-house-weds-july-18-16-07-2018\"><strong>Click here for full briefing.</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP &ndash; RBA MINUTES: </strong>RBA&rsquo;s meeting minutes from its July meeting will be released on Tuesday, and the minutes aren&rsquo;t expected to contain any significant new information. At the meeting, the Reserve Bank kept policy on hold, with the bank concerned about the state of international trade, subdued domestic wage growth, as well as tightening credit conditions within Australia. After the RBA remove the phrase that the next move is &ldquo;likely up&rdquo; in its June meeting minutes, some are now questioning the notion whether the next rate move is up. &ldquo;For now, RBA comments suggest the hurdle to ease is still high, but if our &#39;credit tightening&#39; deteriorates into a &#39; credit crunch&#39; scenario then we think the RBA would likely cut,&rdquo; UBS opines.</p>\r\n",

Additionally, renewed chatter in recent days of a possible release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the US ahead of the midterm elections was adding to worries of greater supply.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>RETURNING SUPPLY: </strong>Libya&rsquo;s Sharara field (capacity 290k BPD) was said to be pumping 130k BPD (it was under 100k BPD at the end of last week, after the abduction of workers), its Waha oil field has restarted production at a 20k BPD rate, and the El-Feel field has risen to 70k BPD, according to reports. In Iraq, the Umm Qasr port was expected to be fully operational on Monday or Tuesday, according to officials, after the port was hit by civil unrest in the Sourthern oil-producing regions of the country. In Europe, Equinor is not expecting escalation of strike action to meaningfully hit output in the short-term.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>IRAN SANCTIONS: </strong>Iran Oil Minister says OPEC decision does not give members the right to raise their production level above targets. US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said there will be no blanket waivers on Iran sanctions, but the US will consider exemptions in certain cases if countries cannot reduce on Iran oil purchases to zero. Mnuchin emphasised that the US wants to be careful in the wind-down around energy markets as it reimposes sanctions on Iran. Mnuchin will discuss Iran sanctions with counterparts at G20 this week.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>CRUDE INVENTORY POLL: </strong>This week, analysts are forecasting US crude stocks will draw down by 4.5mln barrels, distillates +1.2mln, gasoline -0.8mln. Stocks at the Cushing hub are seen lower by 368k (from 10/Jul) and lower by 1.3mln (from 6/Jul). &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The DXY has rebounded from sub-94.500 lows and just below a series of downside tech levels, including 94.770 (50% Fib), 94.458 and 94.431 (10 and 30 DMAs respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vying for top G10 spot, as the Franc rebounds further from recent lows vs the Usd and Eur, to circa 0.9970 and 1.1680 vs 1.0068 (new ytd base set last Friday) and 1.1700+ on a combination of profit taking/short covering and technical retracement. The Kiwi has nudged closer to 0.6900 ahead of Q2 CPI data later that is forecast to show headline inflation picking up in Q2 on a y/y basis (1.60% from 1.1% previously).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best majors heading in to the close of Monday&rsquo;s EU session, but off earlier highs vs the Greenback on the aforementioned data-related buck bounce. The single currency has slipped back from 1.1725 towards the big figure where the top of layered option expiry interest rolled off (3.2 bn from 1.1650-1.1700), along with just over 1 bn in the Gbp cross at the 0.8800 strike. Cable also slipped back after topping out just ahead of 1.3300 and with attention now switching to the UK parliament debate/vote on the Customs Bill amidst more reports that the Government may concede on all ERG amendments. Chart-wise, the pair is right near resistance around 1.3260-63 (30 DMA and 61.8% Fib), while 1.3236 (10 DMA) may provide some support if the 1.3225 is retested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choppy trade for the Loonie as crude prices slumped again, but Usd/Cad has drifted down towards 1.3100 vs circa 1.3160 at one stage with the aid of strong Canadian existing home sales (up 4.1% m/m vs -0.1% previously).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative underperformers as Aud/Usd remains capped below 0.7450 and the Nzd cross tests 1.0950 vs 1.0975 at one stage overnight, and with the Aud focus now turning to RBA minutes to the July policy meeting tomorrow, with guidance tweaked towards a more neutral stance and the outlook for growth, inflation and wages still skewed towards downside risks. Usd/Jpy is still rangy between 112.20-55 as the headline pair eyes a key 76.4% Fib around 112.33 and the return of Japanese markets on Tuesday after the long holiday weekend.</p>\r\n",

In truth, its still somewhat aimless in debt markets vs FX where the Dollar lose a bit more momentum across the board as Eur/Usd firms up to 1.1725, Cable creeps back up towards 1.3300 and Usd/Jpy retreats from 112.55. Consequently, the DXY has lost 94.500 and slipped just below a few support levels, like a 50% Fib (94.770), its 10 DMA (94.458) and 30 DMA (94.431) to sit just above 94.400, awaiting some fundamental direction via early US data &ndash; Empire State manufacturing and retail sales.</p>\r\n",

Moreover, the Eur may be drawn to a 1.2 bn expiry vs the Gbp at 0.8800 even though the Pound faces further Brexit risk via the Commons debate and vote on the Customs Bill later. Eur/Gbp currently around 0.8825 and Cable circa 1.3250 with key resistance capping the upside (30 DMA at 1.3260 and 61.8% Fib at 1.3263), while near term support for the latter comes in at 1.3236 (10 DMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie is pretty level vs its US peer and pivoting 1.3150 ahead of some Canadian data that could impact and/or offset any Usd-led moves in the form of existing home sales.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks begin the week subdued with the region lacklustre amid the absence of Japanese participants and following a quiet weekend in terms of newsflow, while the region also digests a slew of mixed Chinese data including Q2 GDP. ASX 200 (-0.4%) was on the backfoot from early trade amid cautiousness prior to the key Chinese releases and with the index dragged by losses in miners and financials. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) and Hang Seng (-0.7%) are downbeat after the mixed releases in which GDP topped estimates on a Q/Q basis at 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.6%, but GDP Y/Y slowed inline with forecasts to 6.7% vs. Prev. 6.8%. In addition, Retail Sales was better than expected and Industrial Production disappointed, while the lending and money data late last week was also varied and added to the uninspired tone. In terms of today&rsquo;s notable movers, ZTE shares surged after the US confirmed to lift the ban on US sales to the Co. while Xiaomi were on the other side of the spectrum after the Shanghai Stock Exchange banned investors from trading in a dozen of foreign companies and firms with weighted-voting rights via the stock-connect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are quiet overnight with most majors remaining near Friday&rsquo;s close and the DXY consolidating after failing to hold on to the 95.00 level last week. This has kept EUR/USD and GBP/USD sideways at the 1.1600 and 1.3200 handles respectively to provide some early respite from last week&rsquo;s tumultuous price swings. Elsewhere, JPY-crosses are choppy amid the absence of Japanese participants, while commodity linked currencies have seen a minimal pullback overnight after the somewhat inconclusive Chinese data.</p>\r\n",
