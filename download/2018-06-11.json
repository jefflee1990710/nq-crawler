Goldman Sachs tech analysts said 2823-24 is the next level to watch on the upside, and monitor for signs of exhaustion &ndash; if 2824 holds, further upside could be seen, otherwise we may come back to visit 2742. In stock specifics, Sempra Energy (SRE) was a top performer on Monday, following activist Elliott Management&rsquo;s urging the company to reshuffle its board and to establish a review committee. On the other end of the scale, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG) pressuring the SPX today following a report from state officials claiming the fires last year which killed 46 people were sparked by its power lines. Attention tomorrow will be on AT&amp;T&rsquo;s (T) merger with Time Warner (TWX), with a judge expect to deliver his ruling at the cash close; both companies are trading higher today, and the telecom sector was also boosted today ahead of the decision. CNBC notes the spin off effect from this decision may flow into other companies with M&amp;A hopes as, such as Disney&rsquo;s (DIS) offer to buy Fox (FOXA), CVS (CVS) offer for Aetna (AET) and T-Mobile&rsquo;s (TMUS) proposed merger with Sprint (S). Later, it was reported that Comcast (CMCSA) will formalize its all-cash bid for Twenty-First Century Fox&rsquo;s (FOXA) assets on Wednesday if AT&amp;T&#39;s (T) bid for Time Warner (TWX) is approved tomorrow, sources tell CNBC. SPX +0.11%, NDX +0.22%, DJI +0.03%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields were higher on Monday ahead of the FOMC&rsquo;s policy meeting on Wednesday, where a 25bps is priced with virtual certainty. The complex was helped by continuing deflating of the political risk premium in Europe, analysts said, where over the weekend, the Italian finance minister said that the country has no intention of leaving the Euro area, helping the Bund/BTP spread to narrow. The US Treasury auctioned $32bln in 3yr notes, tailing by 0.1, and saw the same high yield as May&rsquo;s auctions. Indirect participation was strong, taking down the largest share since January. Directs participation was below recent averages, while dealer take down was slightly above recent averages. The 10yr note auction stopped-through the screens by 0.3bps with cover the highest since January. Indirect participation was, however, well below the six month average, seeing direct participation almost double versus the previous month, though dealer participation was in line with recent averages. US 10YR T-notes futures (Sep 2018) at 5 ticks lower at 119-14.</p>\r\n",

On the other end of the scale, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG) pressuring the SPX today following a report from state officials claiming the fires last year which killed 46 people were sparked by its power lines. Attention tomorrow will be on AT&amp;T&rsquo;s (T) merger with Time Warner (TWX), with a judge expect to deliver his ruling at the cash close; both companies are trading higher today, and the telecom sector was also boosted today ahead of the decision. CNBC notes the spin off effect from this decision may flow into other companies with M&amp;A hopes as, such as Disney&rsquo;s (DIS) offer to buy Fox (FOXA), CVS (CVS) offer for Aetna (AET) and T-Mobile&rsquo;s (TMUS) proposed merger with Sprint (S). Later, it was reported that Comcast (CMCSA) will formalize its all-cash bid for Twenty-First Century Fox&rsquo;s (FOXA) assets on Wednesday if AT&amp;T&#39;s (T) bid for Time Warner (TWX) is approved tomorrow, sources tell CNBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>Envision Healthcare (EVHC) confirmed it is to be acquired by KKR (KKR) for USD 46/shr, for a deal totalling USD 9.9bln including debt. USG (USG) is to be purchased by Knauf for USD 44/shr worth roughly USD 7bln, and La Salle Hotel (LHO) received a higher offer from Pebblebrook for USD 37.80/shr. Elsewhere, a group of shareholders in Takeda Pharmaceuticals are trying to gain support to block the USD 62bln acquisition of Shire (SHPG), at an extraordinary general meeting. Reports also stated that Boston Scientific (BSX) received a takeover approach from Stryker (SYK) which would create a medical device giant worth more than USD 110bln, according to people familiar with the matter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (N8) SETTLE UP 36 CENTS AT $66.10/BBL; BRENT (Q8) SETTLES UNCHANGED AT $76.46/BBL. </strong>Oil ticked up on Monday, shrugging-off rising US drilling activity (Baker Hughes on Friday reported active oil rigs were up by one last week), as well as reported increasing output in Russia and Saudi Arabia; Interfax reported that Russian output jumped to 11.1mln BPD (versus just under 11mln last month). Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, raised daily output to above 10mln BPD to the highest levels since last October; analysts at PVM said this bears the hallmarks of an OPEC+ shift in output policy. Later, Iraq&rsquo;s oil minister said that the country will decide on an output increase if OPEC takes such a course at its meeting on the 22 June meeting in Vienna (OPEC is to consider short-term and long-term market stability at the meeting in Vienna, according to the Qatari oil minister). Elsewhere, the UAE energy minister denied that the US had made a request to OPEC to lift output by 1mln bbls; journalists noted that their sources pieces in fact used language to suggest that the requests were made to individual countries, not the cartel officially. Elsewhere, Argus reported OPEC oil production remained close to a three-year low in May at 31.76mln BPD. There was a bounce in oil prices after Genscape released its Cushing stocks forecast to subscribers at 1000 EDT, which led to some speculating that it was projecting a sharp draw in this week&rsquo;s data; the latest Reuters poll finds analysts expect headline crude stocks to draw by 2.9mln this week, distillates are seen drawing by 0.1mln, and gasoline is expected to post a small build of 0.1mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) AT 5 ticks lower at 119-14. </strong>Treasury yields were higher on Monday ahead of the FOMC&rsquo;s policy meeting on Wednesday, where a 25bps is priced with virtual certainty. The complex was helped by continuing deflating of the political risk premium in Europe, analysts said, where over the weekend, the Italian finance minister said that the country has no intention of leaving the Euro area, helping the Bund/BTP spread to narrow. The US Treasury auctioned $32bln in 3yr notes, tailing by 0.1, and saw the same high yield as May&rsquo;s auctions. Indirect participation was strong, taking down the largest share since January. Directs participation was below recent averages, while dealer take down was slightly above recent averages. The 10yr note auction stopped-through the screens by 0.3bps with cover the highest since January. Indirect participation was, however, well below the six month average, seeing direct participation almost double versus the previous month, though dealer participation was in line with recent averages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The broad Dollar was pretty mixed in the aftermath of the weekend G-7 gathering that ended in discord and President Trump disassociating the US from the official communique. The DXY is flat, however, basing above 93.50 ahead of CPI data and the FOMC this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Political tension continues to ease in the bloc ahead of what market participants believe will be a hawkish update from the ECB this week (following comments from the normally dovish Praet last week, in addition to other hawkish commentary from other policymakers) when it discusses the exit from its QE programme. After gapping up on the Sunday reopen, action has been horizontal, with support above 1.1750, and some desks are talking about finding entries targeting upside this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Hopes of a constructive outcome between at the summit with North Korea, as well as easing political tensions in Europe have weakened demand for the yen, with traders shrugging off the post-G7 meeting contentious rhetoric between the US and the rest of the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>USDCAD gapped up on the Sunday reopen as the wa of words between Trump and Trudeau took its toll. However, risk sentiment was constructive on Monday, and commodities were bid, helping USDCAD fall back beneath 1.30 consolidating around 1.2980. Note, a prominent US bank is eyeing 1.3125 after establishing a long at 1.2965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Another major underperformer ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s key Brexit withdrawal bill debate and vote, as a string of UK data releases missed consensus by a hefty margin to keep already lowly BoE rate hike expectations depressed. Cable reversed sharply from around 1.3440 and a few pips off its 30 DMA (1.3444) to take out short term technical support at the 200 HMA (1.3363) and briefly dip below 1.3350, while EURGBP cleared 0.8800, but held just below the 200 DMA (0.8836). Ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s key vote in the Commons, PM May told Conservative MPs to back her or risk undermining EU talks; the general flow of news suggests that May has been successful in persuading the influential 1922 Committee to vote with her, although the situation naturally remains fluid. In Brexit news: Irish PM Varadkar says there is a small chance of no Brexit deal by October, and that Article 50 could be extended for more Brexit talks. Meanwhile, there was further newsflow suggesting that the EU was not on board with May&rsquo;s time-limited backstop proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Registered gains vs its US counterpart on wider global risk appetite (again outside of the quarrel in Quebec). Some desks suggest risk sentiment around central banks will be the swaying factor for the Aussie this week, given that it remains relatively shielded from Trade Wars. 0.7590-0.7600 is seen as support, targeting congestion between 0.7620-30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>Relatively rangebound vs the USD around 0.9850 and EUR above 1.1600 in wake of the Swiss verdict to keep the status quo for banks and vote against the Vollgeld proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP: Trump/Kim Summit: </strong>US President Trump is set to meet North Korean Supreme Leader Kim in Singapore on Tuesday. Progress has been more rapid than expected, according to the White House, and Trump will meet with Kim for a one-to-one meeting at 9am local time in Singapore (9pm EDT), with a press conference scheduled for 8pm local time (8am EDT). The ultimate aim of the discussions for Trump is for North Korea to denuclearise but the likelihood of a firm agreement and treaty signed on Tuesday is slim to none. Barclays say the best-case scenario for the talks is that negotiators outline a multi-year process for the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of the North Korean nuclear program; halt testing of ballistic missiles; and lay out potential enforcement mechanisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING UP:&nbsp;EU Withdrawal Bill vote: </strong>On Tuesday, the UK Parliament is holding a mammoth session of debate and votes on the Lords amendments to the Brexit Withdrawal Bill. The session is expected to last 12 hours after the government was defeated 15 times in the House of Lords on issues ranging from environmental protection standards to the Customs Union, Irish Border and the end date for Brexit. After losing seats in the 2017 General Election, UK PM May&rsquo;s working majority in parliament stands at just 13 seats, including the support of the 10 DUP MPs that have agreed to back the government on key issues.</p>\r\n",

Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, raised daily output to above 10mln BPD to the highest levels since last October; analysts at PVM said this bears the hallmarks of an OPEC+ shift in output policy. Later, Iraq&rsquo;s oil minister said that the country will decide on an output increase if OPEC takes such a course at its meeting on the 22 June meeting in Vienna (OPEC is to consider short-term and long-term market stability at the meeting in Vienna, according to the Qatari oil minister). Elsewhere, the UAE energy minister denied that the US had made a request to OPEC to lift output by 1mln bbls; journalists noted that their sources pieces in fact used language to suggest that the requests were made to individual countries, not the cartel officially. Elsewhere, Argus reported OPEC oil production remained close to a three-year low in May at 31.76mln BPD. There was a bounce in oil prices after Genscape released its Cushing stocks forecast to subscribers at 1000 EDT, which led to some speculating that it was projecting a sharp draw in this week&rsquo;s data; the latest Reuters poll finds analysts expect headline crude stocks to draw by 2.9mln this week, distillates are seen drawing by 0.1mln, and gasoline is expected to post a small build of 0.1mln.</p>\r\n",

Recent three-year auctions have been encouraging; although the last auction saw a 0.1bps tail, the average over the last three and six auctions has been on the screws. Also at the last auction, the high yield came in at 2.664%, the highest since May 2007; dealers were left with the largest proportion of the issuance at 42.2%, well above the 6-auction average. Directs were awarded 12.3% and indirect 14.6%, the smallest portion since July 2016. Traders will, however, be cautious of the FOMC monetary policy decision on Wednesday, where it is expected to hike the FFR target by 25bps. The bidding deadline for the auction is 1630BST/1130EDT with results expected shortly after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10y notes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Auctions in the 10-year sector have been mixed, as of late; averages over the last three auctions and six auctions has seen a tail of 0.2bps &ndash; the last 10-year auction to stop through was in January (stopped through by 0.5bps). Analysts at TD Securities expect the 10-year auction to go well if yields are hovering at 3% before the auction. The bidding deadline for the auction is 1800BST/1300EDT with results expected shortly after.</p>\r\n",

The DXY is on a modestly softer footing as a result, but rangebound and off m-t-d lows around 93.200 within 93.360-540 parameters ahead of CPI data and the FOMC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marked underperformers, with the Jpy seeing stops vs the Usd tripped and another test of resistance around 110.00, but the pair pulling back before the 200 DMA (110.18) amidst reports of supply in Jpy crosses at big figure levels (ie 130.00 vs the Eur) via market contacts. Meanwhile, the Loonie re-tested 1.3000 lows vs its US counterpart in wake of the aforementioned G7 spat as Trudeau called US tariff proposals insulting and Trump retorted by refusing to back the joint statement and claimed his Canadian host had stabbed the US in the back. The pair has retreated since towards 1.2955, but is still 0.4% or so higher alongside Usd/Mxn around 20.3500 even though Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo still has high hopes of a NAFTA deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dire UK data in the form of ip, manufacturing/construction output and trade has dragged Cable back down below 1.3400 after the pair stopped just a few ticks shy of its 30 DMA at 1.3444, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded towards 0.8825.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top G10 performer and back around 1.1800 vs the Greenback ahead of respective Fed and ECB policy meetings this week, with another FOMC hike virtually priced in and expectations turning more hawkish for the latter after recent sourced reports and official comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aud has managed to reclaim 0.7600+ status vs the Usd on hopes of something positive from the US-NK summit, but with trading volumes thinned by the Australian public holiday overnight, while the Kiwi is also holding relative gains vs the Dollar above 0.7000 as the Aud/Nzd cross hovers just over 1.0800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much net reaction to the weekend rejection of radical changes to Swiss banking rules regarding credit, which was widely anticipated, as the Franc trades relatively flat vs the Usd circa 0.9860 and weaker vs the perky Eur with the cross over 1.1600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/TRY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both weaker after data, but not for the same reasons as Eur/Nok crossed 9.5000 to the upside on weaker than forecast Norwegian inflation ahead of next week&rsquo;s Norges Bank policy meeting, while the Lira fell in wake of the latest daily Usd swap auction that drew significantly more bids than on Friday &ndash; Usd/Try back up over 4.5000.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump refused to endorse the G7 communique which he stated was due to false statements made by Canadian PM Trudeau who he criticized as being dishonest and weak, while he also suggested the US is looking at tariffs on autos flooding the market. This was in response to comments from Canadian PM Trudeau that Canada would impose retaliatory tariffs against US and warned that Canada would not be pushed around. (Twitter/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted overnight about Canada and Trudeau in which he suggested Canada was bragging about making USD 100bln in trade from US and that PM Trudeau acts hurt when called out regarding this. US President also commented that Germany pays 1% of GDP to NATO while US pays 4% of a much larger GDP to NATO which he suggested doesn&#39;t make sense, while he added that US protects Europe but gets clobbered on trade and that change is coming. Furthermore, Trump also tweeted he will not let friends and enemies take advantage anymore regarding trade and that the American worker must be put first. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Chancellor Merkel said have agreed with the US to review trade ties and tariffs, while she added that the aim is to avoid US tariffs on autos. Merkel further stated that EU will reassess if US imposes auto tariffs and that they must seek own path if negotiations fail, while she also commented that EU has prepared counter measures against US tariffs on steel and aluminium. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian equity markets began the week somewhat cautious ahead of the upcoming key risk events including the summit between US and North Korea tomorrow, as well as the FOMC and ECB policy meetings later this week. Furthermore, a market closure in Australia and the G7 fall out in which Trump refused to endorse the communique and criticized Canadian PM Trudeau as being dishonest and weak, also added to the tentative tone and saw US equity futures briefly pressured at the open. However, US equity futures have since recovered, while both Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) and KOSPI (+0.6%) were marginally positive as focus turned towards the upcoming historical Trump-Kim summit. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) were mixed with underperformance in mainland China after inaction by the PBoC led to a liquidity drain and as participants digested mixed inflation data. Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid the tentative tone in the region and a lack of Rinban announcement by the BoJ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese CPI (May) M/M -0.2% vs. Exp. -0.1% (Prev. -0.2%).

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY was slightly softer after Trump alienated the US from its closest allies by refusing to endorse a joint G7 statement and warned of auto tariffs, while he also took to Twitter in his reproach against PM Trudeau and to a lesser extent the EU. This benefitted the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts in which EUR/USD attempted to reclaim the 1.1800 handle and with GBP/USD above 1.3400, while antipodeans were also higher but with price action across the majors mostly contained ahead of the looming risk events. Elsewhere, there were initial safe-haven flows seen into JPY which was later fully reversed, while USD/CAD was short-squeezed at the open as CAD took the brunt of the G7 disarray and Trump&rsquo;s overzealous tweeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed overnight with WTI crude futures slightly lower and stuck within a narrow trading range amid a lack of fresh drivers for energy. Elsewhere, copper was subdued amid a somewhat cautious tone and gold was uneventful around the USD 1300/oz level with participants tentative ahead of this week&rsquo;s policy decisions from both the Fed and ECB, while silver outperformed as prices retested last week&rsquo;s highs to print its best levels in 7 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count (8 Jun) 1062 (Prev. 1060).

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week somewhat cautious ahead of the upcoming key risk events including the summit between US and North Korea tomorrow, as well as the FOMC and ECB policy meetings later this week. Furthermore, a market closure in Australia and the G7 fall out in which Trump refused to endorse the communique and criticized Canadian PM Trudeau as being dishonest and weak, also adds to the tentative tone and saw US equity futures briefly pressured at the open. However, US equity futures have since recovered, while both Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) and KOSPI (+0.6%) are marginally positive as focus turns towards the upcoming historical Trump-Kim summit. Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) are mixed with mainland China underperforming after inaction by the PBoC led to a liquidity drain and with participants digesting mixed inflation data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is slightly softer after Trump alienated the US from its closest allies by refusing to endorse a joint G7 statement and warned of auto tariffs, while he also took to Twitter in his reproach against PM Trudeau and to a lesser extent the EU. This benefitted the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts with EUR/USD attempting to reclaim the 1.1800 handle and with GBP/USD holding above 1.3400, while antipodeans are also higher but with price action across the majors mostly contained ahead of the looming risk events. Elsewhere, there were initial safe-haven flows seen into JPY which gradually petered out, while USD/CAD was short-squeezed at the open as CAD took the brunt of the G7 disarray and Trump&rsquo;s overzealous tweeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid the tentative tone in the region and a lack of Rinban announcement by the BoJ.</p>\r\n",
