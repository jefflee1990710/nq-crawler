However, there were constructive comments from some other Democrat Senators (Brown, for instance).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rules Committee Chairman was quoted as saying that there could be another vote in the House tonight if Senate reach a deal that is different from the House&rsquo;s version of the funding bill passed on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +0.44% at 2810, DJI +0.21% at 26071, NDX +35% at 6834</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top performers: &nbsp;Consumer Staples +1.11%, Consumer Discretionary 0.87%, Financials 0.68%</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bottom performers: Utilities -0.29%, Energy -0.10%, &nbsp;IT +0.16% </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 printed another fresh intraday record highs, looking through the threat of a government shutdown. Consumer sectors lead the gains on expectations of lower tax bills, as well as a solid global economic backdrop. On the other end of the scale, the defensive utilities sector was lagging, with energy also lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: 10-Year T-Note futures settle 5+ ticks lower at 122-09</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The curve steepened on Friday, with yields on 2s c.2bps higher on the day, while the longer end was higher by c.3bps. However, major spreads narrowed again, with 2s10s marginally flatter, while 2s30s and 5s30s flattened by 0.5bps and 0.8bps at settlement, respectively. 2s5s, however, widened slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10-year yield rose to just shy of 2.65%, and was getting some attention given that it is now within the &ldquo;Gundlach zone&rdquo;, which he said would put pressure on stocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some had suggested that yields have been rising this week &ndash; in spite of little progress in passing a bill to keep the government open &ndash; on the back of rising commodity prices generating some upside inflation pressures. However, analysts have noted that such a driver has historically delivered little in terms of a sustainable, long-term impact on inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY red for the fifth straight week </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar Index was flat on Friday, despite the looming threat of a government shutdown; the DXY finishes red for the fifth consecutive week, the longest loosing run since May 2015. And despite widening rate differentials between USTs and JGBs, the JPY continues to strengthened against the greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR was also flat on Friday, with the single currency eyeing Sunday&rsquo;s vote in Germany to see if the SPD will enter into a government coalition. Analysts generally see EUR downside in the event that it votes against it, since it would raise the prospect of either another election in Germany, or a minority government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling was negative on the day after the strong gains made this week, finishing US trade shy of the 1.39 handle. With Brexit developments quiet, and a generally reasonable run of economic data, the pound found demand this week against the currencies weighed down by political uncertainty (USD, EUR).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES: WTI futures settle 58 cents lower $63.37 per barrel; Brent futures settle 70 cents lower at $68.61 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices slipped by the most this week since October, despite hitting a three-year high in the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IEA reported on Friday that US crude output is expected to rise above 10mln BPD &ndash; in line with what OPEC reported on Thursday. It also said that global stockpiles were tightening substantially on the back of the OPEC/non-OPEC deal to curb output. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, weekly rig count data showed US driller cutting active rigs for the second straight week.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>As we are aware, Germany does not currently have a government. Nearly four months after the election, Chancellor Angela Merkel&rsquo;s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and sister Social Union (CSU) are desperately trying to form a stable government via a grand-coalition. This uncertainty is corroding Merkel&rsquo;s public standing after 12 years as a dominant leader in the Eurozone where she now must count on the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and their leader Martin Schulz to once again agree to tie-up for the sake of a German government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six hundred SPD delegates are due to vote this Sunday regarding whether to embark on head-on coalition talks with CDU/CSU. Michael Groschek, the leader of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) which accounts for around a quarter of SPD delegates, joined Martin Schulz on a positive forecast for Sunday&rsquo;s vote. SPD parliament leader Andrea Nahles stated about a third of delegates were still undecided however she was optimistic a majority of the party would vote to endorse the talks. On the other hand, she also conceded that SPD has not been fulfilled all its demands in the negotiations which include universal health care insurance, but added that other important projects are within reach. Building on this, SPD&rsquo;s youth and left wings are opposing coalition talks stating that the blueprints do not contain enough SPD hallmarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, expectations are mixed ahead of Sunday&rsquo;s vote. A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote would spur detailed coalition negotiations between the two parties. Further delays in talks would seriously impact the EU as discussions regarding reforming its structures and financial priorities have been forced to be put on hold until a new government is in place in Berlin. Refusal by SPD delegates to hold further coalition talks could result in a new election that would likely be followed by even more painful coalition talks or the formation of the first post-war German minority government. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Still no evidence that higher US bond yields are providing the Greenback with any support, but the growing likelihood of a Government shutdown has not added to the Dollar&rsquo;s woes either. Usd/G10 pairs are pretty mixed after some whippy trade, with Cable retreating from new post-Brexit vote highs (circa 1.3945) on much worse than expected UK retail sales data to test 1.3850 support, while Eur/Gbp took out stops around the 200DMA (0.8835) on the way to almost 0.8850. Eur/Usd rangy within 1.2230-95 parameters amidst more ECB sourced reports playing down Eur strength concerns and underlining new guidance prospects for March rather than next week&rsquo;s January policy meeting. Revived NAFTA hopes on an extension to the latest discussions underpinned the Cad and Mxn, with the former back down towards 1.2400 vs the Usd having weakened earlier in the week on the &lsquo;dovish&rsquo; BoC hike, while the Peso probed 2 month highs around 18.5400 (close to 200DMA support just below 18.5000). Usd/Jpy tested support at 110.50, but not a bigger downside chart level at 110.15 and the antipodeans retreated from best levels vs their US counterpart (Aud/Usd from 0.8040 towards 0.8000 and Nzd/Usd from 0.7325 back under 0.7300). Usd/Chf hovering around 0.9600 vs sub-0.9550 at one stage and now awaiting a White House statement on the possible (probable?) shutdown.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>19th January 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>Stop gap bill to fund government through to mid-Feb was passed by the House, however faces dim chances of passing a Senate vote.</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>GBP back towards 1.39 following soft retail sales which had been distort by Black Friday sales in Novembers reading.</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Looking ahead, highlights include US U. of Michigan Sentiment data and comments from Fed&rsquo;s Quarles, Bostic and Williams.</strong><br />&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asia equity markets mostly traded with cautious gains after a subdued performance on Wall St and with focus on whether Congress can avert a government shutdown. ASX 200 (-0.2%) was weighed by continued weakness in commodity-related stocks as well as a lacklustre financial sector, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) saw initial upside pared as participants awaited developments in Washington where the stop gap bill to fund government through to February 16th was passed by the House, but faces less certainty at the Senate. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) somewhat took a breather from its recent ascent to all-time highs and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) was positive after yesterday&rsquo;s GDP numbers and firm liquidity efforts by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally lower as Japanese yields increased in tandem with global peers including the US 10yr yield which rose above 2.63% and its highest since 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 130bln via 7-day reverse repos, CNY 90bln via 14-day reverse repos and CNY 10bln via 63-day reverse repos for a weekly net injection of CNY 590bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 40bln net injection. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.4169 (Prev. 6.4401)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese Government upgrades overall economic assessment in January which marks the first upgrade in 7-months. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ is said to be optimistic in achieving their 2% inflation target withing two years but are cautious on the next move. People close to the BoJ say the market overreacted to the change in Rinban operations, which they say wasn&rsquo;t meant to signal any broader policy shift.<em> As a guide, this is relatively the same as recent source reports from the BoJ. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Mester (Voter, Hawk) reiterated further US rate hikes are appropriate in 2018 and 2019, while she added that the pace of hikes should be similar to 2017. Furthermore, Mester also stated that she favours 3 to 4 rate hikes this year and next. (Newswires)<br /><br />White House is said to consider Fed&#39;s Williams for Fed Vice Chair role, according to press reports. (Newswires)<br /><br />US House voted 230-197 in favour of the government spending bill to fund government through to February 16th, which then sent the bill to the Senate which passed the procedural motion to begin debate on stopgap bill but delayed the actual vote on the bill till Friday. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed is said to be working on plans to relax bank leverage ratio which could free up billions in bank capital. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity markets are higher across the board, appearing to shrug off concerns over the potential government shutdown. The Dax is outperforming, led by ThyssenKrupp after they confirmed their targets and BASF who continue to rally after their positive trading update late yesterday. The FTSE underperforms slightly with a number of smaller companies issuing profit warnings, including: Carpetright, Dignity and Bonmarche whose shares all plummeted between 20% and 50%. Although none of these companies are in the FTSE 100, the knock on effect is clear to see with Kingfisher, a competitor to Carpetright, propping up the index. US equity futures pushed higher after reports that the Fed is said to be working on plans to relax bank leverage ratio which could free up billions in bank capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USD remained on the back foot in European trade as the threat of a government shutdown in the US becomes a reality ahead of the Senate vote. 60 votes in the Senate are needed to fund the government but it appears that the Republicans don&rsquo;t even have the full support of everyone in their own party so getting an additional 10-15 from the Democrats seems unlikely. The JPY remained strong as sources in the WSJ said that the BoJ is optimistic of reaching its 2% inflation target within two years. UK retail sales disappointed, falling 1.5% M/M vs. expectations of a smaller 0.6% decline. Nevertheless, despite a brief dip in GBP on the back of the figures, GBP/USD reversed course as the ONS stated that shoppers are just moving their shopping earlier (NB: November data was much better than expected).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK bonds and STIR futures were already on the rebound ahead of the UK data, but built on their recovery gains on the big miss, albeit briefly. Gilts topped out at 123.78 (+16 ticks vs -21 ticks at the low), while the 3 month Short Sterling strip traded 1-2 ticks higher before slipping back to stand flat to 1 tick above par. So, pretty much the knee-jerk anticipated as the already erratic retail sales series was further clouded by seasonal factors and promotions. Elsewhere, Bunds are underperforming despite a decent bounce off the 160.31 low to 160.56 (-2 ticks vs -27 ticks at worst), with chart support respected again, while Eurozone peripherals are firmer, led by Spanish Bonos on upgrade speculation. US Treasuries have pared some losses with the 10 year future near the top of its 112.09-13+ overnight range and yield easing back to 2.63% after probing just above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent and crude futures trade lower with markets keeping a close eye on US production after the DoE inventory data on Thursday and following monthly oil market reports from OPEC and the IEA. The DoE data showed US production rebounded over 2% in the latest week to 9.75mln bpd, while the IEA today said that US production could soon top 10mln bpd, and overtake Saudi Arabia and Russia. Precious metals are benefitting from the weak USD and as markets fear a potential US federal government shut down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IEA says global oil supply in December fell by 405k bpd to 97.7mln bpd due to lower North Sea and Venezuelan output.<br />- Maintains 2018 global oil demand forecast at 1.3mln bpd, down from 2017 growth of 1.6mln bpd.<br />- US crude supply is set to push past 10mln bpd, overtaking Saudi Arabia and rivalling Russia</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback is a broad loser again with the DXY languishing below 90.500 and only just above recent 3 year lows as its poor start to 2018 continues. Little or no sign of any positive impetus from rising US Treasury yields, as the prospect of another Government shutdown or last minute Senate reprieve looms. The PBoC has fixed the Usd/Cny mid-point lower again, while Usd/Jpy has seen bids filled at 110.60 support to test buying interest just ahead of 110.50 on the back of latest reports that the BoJ is more confident about achieving its inflation target within 2 years. 110.15 is the next downside target before more buy orders between 110.00-15. Aud/Usd has extended gains above 0.8000 and Nzd/Usd has recaptured 0.7300 despite a marked slowdown in NZ manufacturing PMI overnight. Eur/Usd has bounced firmly off 1.2200-50 and looking to re-test 1.2300, Cable is almost back up to post-Brexit vote peaks around 1.3940 and Usd/Chf is heading towards 0.9500 having breached Wednesday&rsquo;s 0.9573 base. Usd/Cad is bang on the 1.2400 handle and 1.2350-55 forms the next downside objective.</p>\r\n",

Key support at 160.30 held in yesterday, but remains a near term target for bears ahead of January&rsquo;s 160.11 base as the 10 year yield continues to nudge up against the 0.6% level. Comments from ECB&rsquo;s Coeure on Thursday underlined a more upbeat assessment of the economy, which is now deemed to be out of recovery and into growth mode, but still unlikely to materially alter the tone of forward policy guidance at next week&rsquo;s meeting, despite hawks calling for a fixed QE end date. However, as US 10 year cash rates look to edge higher from 2.63% amidst 3-4 rate hike leanings this year and in 2019 from Fed&rsquo;s Mester, bonds are likely to remain on the back foot.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>Asia equity markets mostly traded with cautious gains after a subdued performance on Wall St and with focus on whether Congress can avert a government shutdown. ASX 200 (-0.2%) was weighed by continued weakness in commodity-related stocks as well as a lacklustre financial sector, while Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) saw initial upside pared as participants awaited developments in Washington where the stop gap bill to fund government through to February 16th was passed by the House, but faces less certainty at the Senate. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) somewhat took a breather from its recent ascent to all-time highs and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) was positive after yesterday&rsquo;s GDP numbers and firm liquidity efforts by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally lower as Japanese yields increased in tandem with global peers including the US 10yr yield which rose above 2.6% and its highest since 2016. </strong></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade with cautious gains after a subdued performance on Wall St and with focus on whether Congress can avert a government shutdown. ASX 200 (-0.1%) is subdued by continued weakness in commodity-related stocks as well as a lacklustre financial sector, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) is mildly positive with upside contained as participants await developments in Washington where the stopgap bill to fund government through to February 16<sup>th</sup> was passed by the House, but has less certainty at the Senate. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) takes a breather from its recent ascent to all-time highs and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) is positive after yesterday&rsquo;s GDP numbers and firm liquidity efforts by the PBoC which resulted to a weekly net injection of CNY 590bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action is relatively quiet amid a lack of economic releases or key overnight speakers. Nonetheless, USD was range-bound in anticipation whether a shutdown will be averted, which has also resulted to indecision in USD/JPY as the pair is stuck near the 111.00 level for lack of a better catalyst. Elsewhere, antipodeans are mixed with AUD underpinned alongside CNY strength and after a firmer reference rate by the PBoC, while a 5yr low New Zealand Business PMI keeps NZD subdued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower as Japanese yields increase in tandem with global peers including the US 10yr yield which rose above 2.6% and its highest since 2016.</p>\r\n",
