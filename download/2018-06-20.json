Additionally, the PBOC pledged a comprehensive plan to ease policy &ndash; including potential RRR cuts &ndash; if the Chinese economy slows due to trade wars. On the US front, Commerce Secretary Ross has granted 42 steel product exemptions and denied 56 requests under section 232; Ross also said that steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada and Mexico could be lifted in NAFTA talks progress well, and expressed optimism that NAFTA talks will pick up following the Mexican election. On the EU front, European Commission gave final approval for tit-for-tat duties, wish as of Friday, is to hit EUR 2.8bln of imports from the US on products including motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. Elsewhere, EU&#39;s Juncker noted no press conference is planned after the EU summit to take place on Sunday, at which trade retaliation plan against the US will be discussed as previously reported. Canada&#39;s Freeland says planned counter-tariffs against the US are strong, and they need to be, she said; once again, she reiterated that the issue of tariffs and NAFTA negotiations were separate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED SPEAK: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Chair Powell stuck to the script, repeated his case for gradual rate hikes, noting moderate wage growth suggests that the jobs market is not excessively tight. Powell sees the job market as likely to strengthen further and the fiscal stimulus to boost demand over the next few years. Overall, he states the US Economy is performing very well. On fiscal policy, Powell said there is still space for fiscal policy to counter any future downturns, adding that rates may return to zero in future downturns. He argued estimates of natural rate of unemployment may be even more uncertain today as inflation is less responsive to low joblessness, adding that a flatter Phillips curve suggests it is possible the impact on inflation of unemployment below natural rate for extended period &lsquo;might not be large&rsquo;. Finally changes in trade policy could cause the Fed to question their outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB SPEAK: </strong>ECB&rsquo;s Draghi also stuck to the script, saying the central bank is seeing encouraging signs in pricing power, inflation is moving towards target, and unit labour costs are on an upward path. On trade, he noted it is not time to assess the consequences of tariffs on monetary policy warning that any changes in trade policy could cause the ECB to question its outlook. ECB&#39;s Villeroy (Dovish) said the first rate hike could come in Summer 2019 (Note, the ECB&rsquo;s guidance suggests the first hike will not come until after summer 2019). Villeroy added that QE should end in December and monetary policy should remain accommodative. He noted there has been no change to the rate policy since the June 14th meeting. ECB&#39;s Nowotny (Hawkish) warned the risks for financial stability are political and sees the EUR depreciating against the USD. ECB&rsquo;s Knot (Hawk) said he is optimistic on wage growth going forward. Finally, ECB sources have stated that &quot;unwinding ECB accommodation is a risk&quot; and that &quot;protectionism will have a larger effect&quot; than anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The UK Government defeated the Upper House&rsquo;s &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo; amendment in the Commons, as expected following the earlier compromises which were made. Later on, the government proposal was accepted by the UK Upper House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOJ:</strong> Governor Kuroda said wages and prices have continued to show weak developments, and the deflationary mindset has been tenacious, and will take time to get rid of. Kuroda is not expecting a spike in inflation expectations. On the economy, he acknowledged the recent &lsquo;significant&rsquo; improvement. He said that while measures to improve productivity will reduce upward pressure on prices in the short-term, it will have a positive impact in the long term. On trade, Kuroda said indirect impact of US-China tariffs on Japan&#39;s economy could be quite significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RBA: </strong>Governor Lowe notes Australian inflation below the RBA&rsquo;s mid-point is likely to continue for some time, and is being constrained by global factors. Lowe added that he will need to accept that global inflation is lower than they might like for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.17%, NASDAQ COMP &nbsp;+0.73%, DJI -0.17%. SECTORS: </strong>Cons Cyclicals +0.61%<strong>, </strong>Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.08%, Energy: +0.57%, Financials: -0.04%, Health Care: +0.16%, Industrials: +0.03%, Materials: -0.41%, Telecoms: -1.05%, Tech: +0.43%, Utilities: -0.06%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US equity futures</strong> nearly pared Tuesday&rsquo;s Trade War inspired sell-off. At the US cash equity open, slight selling was seen, but ES resumed its march upwards gradually, though struggled with the 2775 level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>The spotlight was on Fox (FOXA); Disney (DIS) revised up it&rsquo;s offer for the outstanding assets of Fox to $38/shr ($71.3bln) higher than Comcast&rsquo;s (CMSCA) offer of $35/shr ($65bln). FBN citing sources suggested Comcast (CMCSA) is now preparing another counter bid worth $41/shr in a cash and stock. In terms of the regulatory response, the DoJ is said to be near to clearing the deal between Disney and Fox, and it could be cleared within a fortnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Stock Specifics: </strong>General Electric (GE) is to be removed from the Dow Jones at the open on June 26th and is to be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA). Another story of note today, Starbucks (SBUX) lowered its guidance for Q3 comparable store sales, lowered its FY19 profit forecast and announced it is looking to close 150 underperforming stores in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Earnings: </strong>FedEx (FDX) on Tuesday reported numbers which beat on both the top and bottom line, however, its FY guidance was weaker than expected which hampered the name on Wednesday trade. Oracle (ORCL) also reported AMC on Tuesday, beating on the top and bottom lines, though it expects its Q1 profit to be lower than expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) &nbsp;7+ TICKS LOWER AT 119-19+.</strong> The Treasury complex edged lower and gave up some of the gains seen in the two previous sessions, as it took a breath from escalating trade conflict between the US and China. The yield curve bear-steepened on Wednesday, with short-dated yields higher by c.2bps and longer dated yields higher by c.3bps. There were negative ticks in afternoon trade after Walmart launched a bumper $16bln multi-tranche M&amp;A bond. But generally, major curve spreads were little changed/slightly steeper, with 2s10s and 2s20s wider by c.1bps at settlement, while 2s30s and 5s30s were wider by less than 1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q8) SETTLE &nbsp;81 CENTS LOWER AT $65.71/BBL; BRENT (Q8) FUTURES SETTLE 34 CENTS LOWER AT $74.74/BBL.</strong> Oil traded mixed, WTI outperformed Brent, as it found some support from the API and DoE inventories data which showed larger than expected crude and Cushing draws (DOE reported crude -5.914mln vs exp. -1.898mln, Cushing -1.296mln vs exp +500k, gasoline 3.277mln vs exp +188k, distillates +2.715mln vs exp. -0.164mln; crude production was unchanged). WTI reclaimed the USD 65/bbl overnight, and though wobbled slightly, has held above the level. Brent traded lower to just above USD 74/bbl amid a slew of energy speakers emerging ahead of the key OPEC+ meeting series this week (JMMC on Thursday, OPEC on Friday, OPEC+ on Saturday), where a boost in oil supply is expected (the +600k figure has been thrown around again on ), with key policymakers suggesting that Iran is demonstrating flexibility (it was oppose to any relaxation of supply curbs). However, the Saudi Energy Minister said the market demands more oil in the second half of 2018, adding every energy minister he has spoken to has agreed it is time to change course, and expressed confidence that a deal can be reached this week, contrary to the suggestions of Iran on Tuesday; On Wednesday, an Iranian official said it will only accept production increases to push compliance to 100% on the condition that producers stick to their quotas. Elsewhere, Libya reported oil output down to 700k BPD after conflicts, though it is looking to export from Brega and Zueitin terminals. Reports suggested that Iran exported 2.5mln BPD of oil in May (in April, it exported 2.6mln BPD). In Venezuela, PDVSA exports also fell, by 32% to 765k BPD in the first half of June (vs May) with exports YTD slips to 1.24mln BPD (from 1.68mln BPD in 2017).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DXY: </strong>Keeping close tabs on the 95.000 handle and a keen eye for any further developments on the US-China trade front amidst a glut of OPEC commentary, better than expected, albeit wider Q1 current account deficit and comments from Fed chair Powell reiterating that the rationale for further measured policy normalisation is solid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR: </strong>By no means the biggest net mover on the day, but one of the most volatile within circa 1.1540-1.1600 trading parameters amidst a raft of ECB rhetoric that appeared to be a bit more precise and earlier in terms of rate guidance, but was quickly tweaked to the official &lsquo;though Summer 2019&rsquo; scripted version. Reference was also made to the single currency weakening vs the USD on divergent policy outlooks, but again this is already very apparent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY: </strong>Marginally softer on more dovish/downbeat inflation assessments from BoJ&rsquo;s Kuroda, but still not clearly through 110.00 vs the USD and back towards recent lows as heavy option expiry interest helped to cap the headline pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP:</strong> Cable rebounded a bit further from circa 1.3150 lows and briefly eclipsed 1.3200 on latest Brexit headlines indicating that a major Tory has had a change of heart and will now back the Government&rsquo;s meaningful vote amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD: </strong>A G10 laggard all day, with the Kiwi sub-0.6900 vs the USD and 1.0700 vs the less rattled by global trade war fears than it has been AUD, with some pressure/hedging for bad news evident ahead of NZ GDP data perhaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, CAD, CHF:</strong> All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with the former showing some signs of stability after recent heavy losses as noted above, but still hampered by a benign inflation outlook per latest remarks from RBA Governor Lowe &ndash; AUDUSD capped around 0.7400. NAFTA remains among the big Loonie weights and USDCAD looks poised to continue rallying through 1.3300 and towards last June&rsquo;s peak just shy of 1.3350. The Franc is braced for the SNB tomorrow around 0.9950 vs the Dollar and just off recent highs vs the Eur (1.1500+ from the high 1.1400 area), but the NOK is firmer pre-Norges Bank &ndash; see our research suite for full previews of both policy meets/decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bank of England </strong>Monetary Policy Decision and Minutes Thursday 21st June at 12:00BST. EXPECTATIONS. The Bank of England (BoE) are widely expected to keep the bank rate unchanged at 0.50% with all 63 analysts surveyed by Reuters forecasting the central bank to remain on hold. Money markets are pricing in just a 5% chance of a 25bps hike at Thursday&rsquo;s meeting. With the rate expected to be kept on hold, focus will be on comments in the statement to pave the way for a potential move in August, as well as the vote split to see whether any policymakers favoured a rate hike this time round. At the last meeting, 2 of the 9 members on the Monetary Policy Committee voted for a 25bps with McCafferty and Saunders dissenting. It is likely that the two hawkish members will again favour a 25bps this hike but data since the last meeting should see the rest of the committee prefer to keep policy instruments unchanged. As Morgan Stanley puts it, the BoE is very much in &ldquo;wait-and-see&rdquo; mode and happy to follow the data.

BCB is widely expected to keep rates on hold at 6.50%. EXPECTATIONS: The BCB is widely expected to keep the Selic rate on hold at 6.50%, with only one analyst surveyed by Reuters expecting a hike (HSBC expects a 50bp rate increase). The survey also found that 27 of the 31 surveyed do not see a hike in 2018. At its previous meeting, the central bank said there is no need for additional easing to ensure inflation will head back to target, and said recent economic indicators showed weakness. In terms of rates, the BCB said economic outlook warrants an interest rate at the below neutral level and stated it would be adequate to keep rates at the current level in the coming meetings.

EXPECTATIONS: The Norges Bank is expected to keep the Deposit Rate steady at 0.50% on Thursday, according to 17 out of the 18 economists surveyed by Reuters; the central bank is expected to reiterate that rates will most likely be lifted &ldquo;after summer,&rdquo; which market participants have interpreted as September. For the full preview click here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SNB </strong>Monetary Policy Decision due at 08:30BST (03:30EDT). EXPECTATIONS: The Swiss National Bank is expected to keep rates unchanged, maintaining the Sight deposit rate at -0.75%, and the 3-month LIBOR target range between -1.25% and -0.25%. In recent comments, the central bank&rsquo;s chief Thomas Jordan said it was still &ldquo;too early&rdquo; to consider lifting rates.

EXPECTATIONS: Sixteen of 22 surveyed by Reuters expect Banxico to raise rates by 25bps on Thursday on the back of recent FX developments, which have seen the MXN significantly under pressure amid geopolitical risks, NAFTA uncertainty and possible monetary policy divergence between Banxico and the Fed. Overall the market is pricing in a 25bps hike and depending on the degree and durability of a weaker peso, policymakers may be inclined towards further hikes in the future.

Reference was also made to the single currency weakening vs the Usd on divergent policy outlooks, but again this is already very apparent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marginally softer on more dovish/downbeat inflation assessments from BoJ&rsquo;s Kuroda, but still not clearly through 110.00 vs the Usd and back towards recent lows as heavy option expiry interest helped to cap the headline pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable rebounded a bit further from circa 1.3150 lows and briefly eclipsed 1.3200 on latest Brexit headlines indicating that a major Tory has had a change of heart and will now back the Government&rsquo;s meaningful vote amendment. However, the Pound remains prone to further uncertainty as the compromise is due back in front of the Lords later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A G10 laggard all day, with the Kiwi sub-0.6900 vs the Usd and 1.0700 vs the less rattled by global trade war fears than it has been Aud, with some pressure/hedging for bad news evident ahead of NZ GDP data perhaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback, with the former showing some signs of stability after recent heavy losses as noted above, but still hampered by a benign inflation outlook per latest remarks from RBA Governor Lowe &ndash; Aud/Usd capped around 0.7400. NAFTA remains among the big Loonie weights and Usd/Cad looks poised to continue rallying through 1.3300 and towards last June&rsquo;s peak just shy of 1.3350. The Franc is braced for the SNB tomorrow around 0.9950 vs the Dollar and just off recent highs vs the Eur (1.1500+ from the high 1.1400 area), but the NOK is firmer pre-Norges Bank &ndash; see our research suite for full previews of both policy meets/decisions.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.2%) was the biggest gainer and reached its highest intraday level in a decade with upside led by its largest weighted financials sector, while Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) traded indecisive and at the whim of a choppy currency. Hang Seng (+0.8%) swung between gains and losses, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) was initially downbeat on the tariff-threat overhang.

(Huffington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are recovering some of the loses seen yesterday as trade war news flow slows. The FTSE 100 is the outperforming bourse, coming off of month lows hit in Tuesday&rsquo;s trade, as the GBPUSD extends losses at 6 month lows. The DAX is currently underperforming, with automotive names hit (Continental (-0.5%), Daimler (-0.6%)).Volkswagen (+2.1%) is bucking the trend, however, following an announcement of a possible alliance with Ford to develop and make transporter vans as according to sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imperial Brand&rsquo;s (+2.8%) naming as a top pick at Liberum has pushed the co. to the top of the FTSE 100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - In contrast to broadly still waters elsewhere, some choppy price action on early ECB commentary from the Sintra symposium as the single currency rebounded further from Tuesday&rsquo;s lows and towards 1.1600 vs the Usd on an apparent less dovish nuance from Villeroy vis-&agrave;-vis rate guidance (subsequently corrected to conform with consensus), but then retreated to sub-1.1540 when Nowotny noted Eur depreciation vs the Dollar on divergent interest rate policy. Technically, 1.1510 is still nearest support vs circa 1.1600 resistance and the 20DMA at 1.1686.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY - Both on the back foot vs a firm Greenback, as the DXY holds above 95.000 and risk sentiment overall stabilises, but with the Franc also increasingly wary about SNB intervention via Thursday&rsquo;s policy meeting in the shape of NIRP and direct FX action should the Chf strengthen too much. Usd/Chf hovering above 0.9950 and Eur/Chf over 1.1500. Meanwhile, after largely irrelevant and rather dated BoJ minutes Usd/Jpy has bounced off yesterday&rsquo;s base into a firmer range around 110.00, but perhaps capped by decent option expiry interest at and north of the big figure (around 2 bn from 110.00-05 and then between 110-40-50).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD - Still hampered by Brexit and NAFTA uncertainty, with Cable struggling around a chart pivot at 1.3165, while the Loonie has extended losses vs its US counterpart to 1.3300+ and appears vulnerable or primed for a test of 12 month lows at 1.3348.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - Mixed fortunes again for the antipodean dollars as the former attempts to draw a line in the sand above multi-month lows vs the Usd and recover towards 0.7400, but the latter remains depressed under 0.6900 and via the Aud/Nzd cross that has climbed back over 1.0700. Key for the Kiwi ahead, NZ GDP data after another fall in GDT auction prices on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZAR - Some respite for the Rand on hawkish SARB comments, but a loss to recovery momentum in wake of softer than expected SA inflation data and a fatal attack that claimed the life of an ANC lawmaker. Usd/Zar now around 13.7000 vs 13.6500 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing much in the way of an obvious fundamental catalyst, but core bonds have gathered a bit more recovery momentum to register fresh peaks at 161.69 for Bunds and 123.06 for Gilts (+16 ticks vs -21 ticks at worst and +8 ticks vs -16 ticks respectively).

The FTSE 100 is the outperforming bourse, coming off of month lows hit in Tuesday&rsquo;s trade, as the GBPUSD extends losses at 6 month lows. The DAX is currently underperforming, with automotive names hit (Continental (-0.6%), Daimler (-0.5%)).Volkswagen (+0.8%) is bucking the trend, however, following an announcement of a possible alliance with Ford to develop and make transporter vans as according to sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imperial Brand&rsquo;s (+3.0%) naming as a top pick at Liberum has pushed the co. to the top of the FTSE 100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dialog Semiconductor (+2.2%) confirmed it is in discussions on a potential acquisition of Synaptics and is to proceed with due diligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - In contrast to broadly still waters elsewhere, some choppy price action on early ECB commentary from the Sintra symposium as the single currency rebounded further from Tuesday&rsquo;s lows and towards 1.1600 vs the Usd on an apparent less dovish nuance from Villeroy vis-&agrave;-vis rate guidance (subsequently corrected to conform with consensus), but then retreated to sub-1.1540 when Nowotny noted Eur depreciation vs the Dollar on divergent interest rate policy. Technically, 1.1510 is still nearest support vs circa 1.1600 resistance and the 20DMA at 1.1686.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY - Both on the back foot vs a firm Greenback, as the DXY holds above 95.000 and risk sentiment overall stabilises, but with the Franc also increasingly wary about SNB intervention via Thursday&rsquo;s policy meeting in the shape of NIRP and direct FX action should the Chf strengthen too much. Usd/Chf hovering above 0.9950 and Eur/Chf over 1.1500. Meanwhile, after largely irrelevant and rather dated BoJ minutes Usd/Jpy has bounced off yesterday&rsquo;s base into a firmer range around 110.00, but perhaps capped by decent option expiry interest at and north of the big figure (around 2 bn from 110.00-05 and then between 110-40-50).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD - Still hampered by Brexit and NAFTA uncertainty, with Cable struggling around a chart pivot at 1.3165, while the Loonie has extended losses vs its US counterpart to 1.3300+ and appears vulnerable or primed for a test of 12 month lows at 1.3348.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - Mixed fortunes again for the antipodean dollars as the former attempts to draw a line in the sand above multi-month lows vs the Usd and recover towards 0.7400, but the latter remains depressed under 0.6900 and via the Aud/Nzd cross that has climbed back over 1.0700. Key for the Kiwi ahead, NZ GDP data after another fall in GDT auction prices on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZAR - Some respite for the Rand on hawkish SARB comments, but a loss to recovery momentum in wake of softer than expected SA inflation data and a fatal attack that claimed the life of an ANC lawmaker. Usd/Zar now around 13.7000 vs 13.6500 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds are back on an even keel and nearer the top of a slightly extended Eurex range after the Villeroy dip to a fresh 161.31 low on what seemed to be slightly more hawkish hike guidance before clarification that his view is in line with ECB consensus and the official wording. However, Gilts have succumbed to a bit more selling pressure and just slipped to a new Liffe intraday base at 122.82 (-16 ticks vs +2 ticks at the other extreme) amidst some pre-DMO auction positioning. In the event, the 2028 linker was more than twice oversubscribed and drew considerably stronger demand than long-dated fixed German supply. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are a tad softer and fractionally steeper after recent bull-flattening, and looking for any further Fed insight from Chair Powell later today rather than data as existing home sales are the sole release on offer today, unless of course there is more from either side on trade wars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are trading mixed with oil extending gains as energy ministers emerge ahead of the key OPEC+ meeting later this week. WTI reclaimed the USD 65/bbl overnight, and is now eyeing USD 65.50/bbl while Brent trades north of USD 75.50/bbl. Yesterday&rsquo;s API inventories printed a larger than expected draw, in which energy prices gradually edged higher in the aftermath.&nbsp; In terms of comments, the Russian Deputy Energy Minister expressed the country is ready to talk about all OPEC+ proposals and they expect to reach an agreement in terms of an ease in output cuts by June 23rd, while the Nigerian Energy Minister stated all options are on the table, however it is too early to tell if they will support a hike in production. An Iranian official said Iran will only accept production increases to push compliance to 100% on the condition that producers stick to their quotas. Elsewhere, oil output in Libya dropped to 700k BPD from just over 1mln BPD amid conflict in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving onto the metals complex, gold (-0.3%) trades lower on the day, subdued by a firmer dollar. London copper futures bounced off 3-week lows following a near-2% loss during Tuesday&rsquo;s session although escalating trade tensions cap any recovery in risk appetite. Elsewhere, iron ore futures trimmed losses amid a 5% drop in Chinese iron ore outputs for May while Shanghai steel rebounds after slumping nearly 3% in yesterday&rsquo;s session.</p>\r\n",

However, Gilts have succumbed to a bit more selling pressure and just slipped to a new Liffe intraday base at 122.82 (-16 ticks vs +2 ticks at the other extreme) amidst some pre-DMO auction positioning. In the event, the 2028 linker was more than twice oversubscribed and drew considerably stronger demand than long-dated fixed German supply. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are a tad softer and fractionally steeper after recent bull-flattening, and looking for any further Fed insight from Chair Powell later today rather than data as existing home sales are the sole release on offer today, unless of course there is more from either side on trade wars.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to broadly still waters elsewhere, some choppy price action on early ECB commentary from the Sintra symposium as the single currency rebounded further from Tuesday&rsquo;s lows and towards 1.1600 vs the Usd on an apparent less dovish nuance from Villeroy vis-&agrave;-vis rate guidance (subsequently corrected to conform with consensus) , but then retreated to sub-1.1540 when Nowotny noted Eur depreciation vs the Dollar on divergent interest rate policy. Technically, 1.1510 is still nearest support vs circa 1.1600 resistance and the 20DMA at 1.1686.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both on the back foot vs a firm Greenback, as the DXY holds above 95.000 and risk sentiment overall stabilises, but with the Franc also increasingly wary about SNB intervention via Thursday&rsquo;s policy meeting in the shape of NIRP and direct FX action should the Chf strengthen too much. Usd/Chf hovering above 0.9950 and Eur/Chf over 1.1500. Meanwhile, after largely irrelevant and rather dated BoJ minutes Usd/Jpy has bounced off yesterday&rsquo;s base into a firmer range around 110.00, but perhaps capped by decent option expiry interest at and north of the big figure (around 2 bn from 110.00-05 and then between 110-40-50).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still hampered by Brexit and NAFTA uncertainty, with Cable struggling around a chart pivot at 1.3165, while the Loonie has extended losses vs its US counterpart to 1.3300+ and appears vulnerable or primed for a test of 12 month lows at 1.3348.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed fortunes again for the antipodean dollars as the former attempts to draw a line in the sand above multi-month lows vs the Usd and recover towards 0.7400, but the latter remains depressed under 0.6900 and via the Aud/Nzd cross that has climbed back over 1.0700. Key for the Kiwi ahead, NZ GDP data after another fall in GDT auction prices on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZAR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some respite for the Rand on hawkish SARB comments, but a loss ot recovery momentum in wake of softer than expected SA inflation data and a fatal attack that claimed the life of an ANC lawmaker. Usd/Zar now around 13.7000 vs 13.6500 at one stage.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.0%) was the biggest gainer and reached its highest intraday level in a decade with upside led by its largest weighted financials sector, while Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) traded indecisive and at the whim of a choppy currency. Hang Seng (+0.3%) swung between gains and losses, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) remained downbeat on the tariff-threat overhang.

This kept most its major counterparts subdued with EUR/USD below 1.1600 while GBP/USD was rangebound at a 1.3100 handle ahead of today&rsquo;s key &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo; showdown in the Commons, in which Conservative Party rebels threaten to go against UK PM May and vote for the amendment that would give parliament the authority to direct negotiations with the EU if a final Brexit deal is not accepted. Elsewhere, AUD/USD was firmer as it attempted to reclaim the 0.7400 level to the upside and USD/JPY was choppy amid a lack of drivers as well as an uneventful BoJ minutes from the April meeting, which saw a muted reaction considering there was a more recent meeting last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkey&rsquo;s President Erdogan said he will bring down interest rates and that there is no other way.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade mixed as the region takes a breather from the prior day&rsquo;s sell-off and after some late reprieve on Wall St. where the majors still finished negative but well off worst levels, aside from the DJIA which underperformed as industrials and materials suffered the brunt of the heightened trade tensions. ASX 200 (+0.8%) is the biggest gainer with the index printing its highest intraday level in a decade and with upside led by its largest weighted financials sector, while Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) trades indecisive and at the whim of a choppy currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) swings between gains and losses, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) remains downbeat on the tariff-threat overhang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price action across FX markets has been relatively uneventful with USD holding on to the majority of the prior day&rsquo;s safe-haven flows with the DXY just about remaining above the 95.00 level. This has kept most its major counterparts subdued with EUR/USD below 1.1600 while GBP/USD is restrained at a 1.3100 handle ahead of today&rsquo;s key &lsquo;meaningful vote&rsquo; showdown in the Commons, in which Conservative Party rebels threaten to go against UK PM May and vote for the amendment that would give parliament the authority to direct negotiations with the EU if a final Brexit deal is not accepted. Elsewhere, AUD/USD is firmer as it attempts to reclaim the 0.7400 handle and USD/JPY is choppy amid a lack of drivers as well as an uneventful BoJ minutes from the April meeting which saw a muted reaction considering there was a more recent meeting last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally lower with demand sapped by the somewhat improved picture in the region, although downside is also limited amid the flimsy sentiment in Japan and with the BoJ present in the market for JPY 690bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end.</p>\r\n",
