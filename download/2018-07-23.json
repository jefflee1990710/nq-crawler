In terms of earnings, Hasbro&rsquo;s (HAS) EPS came in 18c higher than the expected 30c, and revenue was also a beat coming in at $904mln, higher than the expected $838mln, the big beat on both ends led to Hasbro having the best day in 1.5 years.

Haliburton (HAL) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW) were at the bottom of the SPX today following poor earnings reports. Tesla (TSLA) was the laggard of the NDX today on Monday after the WSJ reported the electric vehicle maker has asked some of its suppliers to refund a portion of what they have spent previously, which is an appeal that reflects the auto maker&rsquo;s urgency to sustain operations during a critical production period. Amazon (AMZN) was hit following negative tweets from President Trump, saying the &ldquo;Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against [Trump] since they lost the internet tax case.&rdquo; Elsewhere, a crusty day for Papa Johns (PZZA) after the board is to reportedly discuss and hold a potential vote on the adoption of a &#39;poison pill&rsquo; to prevent the founder to gain control over the co.; according to people familiar with the matter. SPX +0.18% at 2806, NDX +0.29% at 7372, DJI -0.05% at 25045.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yield curve bear-steepened with yields rising to their highest levels in over 5 weeks; at settlement, longer-dated yields were higher by c.7bps whilst 2yr yields were higher by c.3bps. The move was helped by developments over in Japan as the BoJ announced its first fixed-rate buying operation since February to purchase an unlimited amount of 10yr JGBs at 0.11% (though didn&rsquo;t have to actually use the operation). The announcement followed a sharp fall in JGBs after sources on Friday reported that the central bank may scale back stimulus, and tweak its targets. US Treasury 2s10s and 2s30s widened by more than 3bps, 5s10s and 5s30s by c.2ps. Ahead of the US GDP release on Friday, US President Trump said to expect GDP growth to come in at 4.8%. US 10yr T-notes futures (U8) settled 16 ticks lower at 119-15+.</p>\r\n",

Iran&rsquo;s foreign minister responded, saying Iran was unimpressed by the comments made by the Trump administration, saying he had heard harsher bluster a few month&rsquo;s ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> The Office of US Trade Representative will hold a public hearing on a list of proposed tariffs on $16bln worth of Chinese goods on July 24th-25th. On NAFTA, sources reported Mexico was said to pushing for a deal with US President Trump by the end of August, and Mexico expects progress in talks this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BoE&rsquo;s Broadbent said if inflation pressures weaken after it starts to reverse QE, the BoE&rsquo;s first response will be to cut interest rates. He also noted that unwinding QE may create disinflationary pressures and that the impact estimates of QE on the economy are less precise than for interest rates themselves. There was little of significance for next week&rsquo;s MPC meeting, where the Bank is expected to lift rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EXISTING HOME SALES </strong>fell in June to 5.38mln from 5.42mln in May, missing expectations for 5.44mln. The fall was attributed to the core single-family component which hit a four-month low, whilst sales condos and co-ops moved up marginally. Analysts at Pantheon believe home sales have peaked for the cycle, though &lsquo;a serious downtrend is still some way off&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX&nbsp; +0.18% at 2806, NDX +0.29% at 7372, DJI -0.05% at 25045.</strong> SECTORS: Energy: -0.25%, Materials: -0.44%, Industrials: -0.50%, Cons Discretionary: -0.37%, Cons Staples: -0.15%, Health Care: +0.22%, Financials: +1.11%, Tech: +0.61%, Telecoms: +0.07%, Utilities: -0.53%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SECTORS:</strong> Financials outperformed today with JP Morgan (JPM) leading the DJI following higher yields, and utilities underperformed as markets took a risk on tone on Monday, hampering the defensive sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS:</strong> Hasbro&rsquo;s (HAS) EPS came in 18c higher than the expected 30c, and revenue was also a beat coming in at $904mln, higher than the expected $838mln, the big beat on both ends led to Hasbro having the best day in 1.5 years. The strong results also benefited competitor Mattel (MAT) which resulted in the two names leading the NDX. Haliburton (HAL) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW) were at the bottom of the SPX today following poor earnings reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) was the laggard of the NDX today on Monday after the WSJ reported the electric vehicle maker has asked some of its suppliers to refund a portion of what they have spent previously, which is an appeal that reflects the auto maker&rsquo;s urgency to sustain operations during a critical production period. Amazon (AMZN) was hit following negative tweets from President Trump, saying the &ldquo;Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against [Trump] since they lost the internet tax case.&rdquo; Elsewhere, a crusty day for Papa Johns (PZZA) after the board is to reportedly discuss and hold a potential vote on the adoption of a &#39;poison pill&rsquo; to prevent the founder to gain control over the co.; according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A:</strong> LifePoint Holdings (LPNT) is to be acquired by a subsidiary of Apollo (APO) for USD 5.6bln, where shareholders of LPNT will receive USD 65/shr in cash. Also, Esterline Tech (ESL) is reportedly exploring a potential sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (U8) SETTLES 37 CENTS LOWER AT $67.89/BBL; BRENT SETTLES&nbsp; 1 CENTS LOWER AT $73.06/BBL.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent outperformed WTI, underpinned by geopolitics, after US President Trump threatened Iran, warning the nation to &quot;NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE &amp; DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!&quot;. The news helped lift Brent to highs around $74.50 and WTI above $69.30; however, in afternoon trade, traders faded the move, with some desks noting that term structures were moving in a bearish direction, with the Brent contango widening, hinting that markets are not concerned about tight markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE INVENTORY POLL: </strong>This week, analysts are forecasting US crude stocks will draw down by 3.5mln barrels, distillates build 0.2mln, gasoline draw down by 0.8mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 16 TICKS LOWER AT 119-15+. </strong>The yield curve bear-steepened with yields rising to their highest levels in over 5 weeks; at settlement, longer-dated yields were higher by c.7bps whilst 2yr yields were higher by c.3bps. The move was helped by developments over in Japan as the BoJ announced its first fixed-rate buying operation since February to purchase an unlimited amount of 10yr JGBs at 0.11% (though didn&rsquo;t have to actually use the operation). The announcement followed a sharp fall in JGBs after sources on Friday reported that the central bank may scale back stimulus, and tweak its targets. US Treasury 2s10s and 2s30s widened by more than 3bps, 5s10s and 5s30s by c.2ps. Ahead of the US GDP release on Friday, US President Trump said to expect GDP growth to come in at 4.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 2-YEAR PREVIEW: </strong>The US Treasury will this week auction USD 119bln this week (USD 35bln 2-year on Tuesday, USD 36bln of 5-year on Wednesday, USD 18bln of new 2-year FRN on Wednesday, and USD 30bln of 7-year on Thursday); With USD 105.2bln maturing at the month-end settlement, there will be a net USD 13.8bln in new supply, according to TD Securities. &ldquo;The recent stabilization in yields could help draw buyers at this auction series, particularly as Fed pricing has remained relatively stable at 1.5 additional hikes in 2018 and another 1.5 hikes next year,&rdquo; TD writes, &ldquo;With the market pencilling in a terminal rate of approximately 2.65% and now even starting to price in small odds of cuts in 2020, we believe current front-end pricing is fair, and this could help draw additional end-user demand.&rdquo; TD notes, however, that the risk that the US Treasury will raise auction sizes in the 5-year refunding more quickly, which could weigh on the sector. The risk, however, is that the US Treasury will increase auction sizes in the 5-year sector at the August refunding (on 1 August), which could weigh on the sector. Looking specifically at the 2-year sector, recent auctions have been taken down without too much drama, with last month&rsquo;s auction coming in on the screws; in terms of participation, the uptrend in dealer participation combined with higher dealer inventory hints at some pressure on front-end rates, which may drive the 2-year and 3-year sectors continuing to cheapen versus OIS, TD says. Auction results will be published shortly after 1800 BST/1300 EST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The broad Dollar and index have recovered some lost ground in choppy trade at the start of the new week, with fundamental/macro impetus coming from rebounding US Treasury yields and further weakness in both the on-shore and off-shore Yuan, while technically the DXY held above chart support in the 94.200 area to retest offers around 94.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> Ending Monday&rsquo;s session as the weakest G10 links, and especially the AUD that retreated through 0.7400 again alongside the CNY/CNH downturns, though not quite far enough to seriously ruffle expiry option feathers and 1 bn rolling off between 0.7370-65 at the NY cut. The Kiwi also lost grip of a big figure at 0.6800, but continues to hold up better with the AUDNZD cross actually slipping a bit further below 1.0900 amidst repositioning and short covering given latest CFTC data showing an oversold NZD market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, CAD, GBP: </strong>All a tad softer vs the Greenback with the single currency losing momentum above 1.1700 and gravitating towards hefty (1.4 bn) option expiries at the strike, while the Loonie failed to derive any independent support from firmer than expected Canadian wholesale trade data that was somewhat overshadowed by a mixed US National Activity Index (June print firm, but nullified by a back month downgrade) and slipped towards the base of a 1.3160-15 range. Cable never strayed too far above 1.3100 amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and yet more pressure on UK PM May as another poll showed the public against her White Paper plan and ready to shift allegiance to UK and/or other far right parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>Both ending Monday mostly flat vs the USD, with the former temporarily losing ground on hawkish BoJ sources momentum, but now back above 111.00. Note, over 111.25 (Fib) by the close could herald further upside and a retest of recent highs beyond 113.00, with the overnight low around 110.75 forming a base. Meanwhile, the Franc remains constrained within 0.9900-30 parameters as a US house targets 0.9600 and places its stop at parity. On that note, a UK bank is short USDJPY, looking for 108.10 with a 113.40 stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The Kiwi also lost grip of a big figure at 0.6800, but continues to hold up better with the Aud/Nzd cross actually slipping a bit further below 1.0900 amidst repositioning and short covering given latest CFTC data showing an oversold Nzd market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All a tad softer vs the Greenback with the single currency losing momentum above 1.1700 and gravitating towards hefty (1.4 bn) option expiries at the strike, while the Loonie failed to derive any independent support from firmer than expected Canadian wholesale trade data that was somewhat overshadowed by a mixed US National Activity Index (June print firm, but nullified by a back month downgrade) and slipped towards the base of a 1.3160-15 range. Cable never strayed too far above 1.3100 amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and yet more pressure on UK PM May as another poll showed the public against her White Paper plan and ready to shift allegiance to UK and/or other far right parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bucking the broad losing trend vs the Usd, but both well off best levels with the former losing hawkish BoJ sources momentum and back below 111.00. Note, over 111.25 (Fib) by the close could herald further upside and a retest of recent highs beyond 113.00, with the overnight low around 110.75 forming a base. Meanwhile, the Franc remains constrained within 0.9900-30 parameters as a US house targets 0.9600 and places its stop at parity. On that note, a UK bank is short Usd/Jpy, looking for 108.10 with a 113.40 stop. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, the Usd has lost some momentum following a rebound above 94.500, with the Eur edging a bit further above 1.1700, but perhaps unable to revisit overnight peaks circa 1.1750 given decent option expiry interest at the big figure (1.4 bn). Elsewhere, the Cad remains relatively rangebound vs its US peer between 1.3115-55 and also not really responsive to better than expected Canadian wholesale trade data.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) were lower with Japan the underperformer amid a firmer JPY and slump in bonds after source reports suggested the BoJ may discuss potential policy changes at its meeting including the yield curve target to allow for a long-term natural increase. This was despite a denial by Governor Kuroda of having any knowledge of the basis for the reports and who stated that remarks would be inappropriate given the proximity of the bank&rsquo;s monetary policy meeting. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.1%) also began subdued amid ongoing trade concerns, although later found some support from PBoC efforts in which the central bank injected CNY 502bln through its 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower by around 50 ticks shortly after the open on policy tightening fears which saw 10yr yields higher by around 6 bps. This later prompted the BoJ to announce its first fixed-rate buying operation since February to purchase an unlimited amount of 10yr JGBs at 0.110%, which effectively placed a floor on JGBs and helped them nurse part of day&rsquo;s losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped reverse repos but later announced to inject CNY 502bln through its Medium-term Lending Facility.

Elsewhere, Fiat Chrysler (-2.5%) shares are lower amid the news that their CEO Marchionne has had to stand down from the Co. due to ill-health with Jeep boss Manley named as his successor; Ferrari (-4.2%) and CNH Industrial (-2.4%). Finally, markets await any developments from reports suggesting that Shell could consider a huge USD 25bln buyback alongside their earnings on Thursday and speculation that GSK could consider spinning-off their consumer division.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds retested early Eurex peaks on a lack of follow-through selling at the new (marginal) 162.23 session base (-30 ticks vs -3 ticks at the other end of the spectrum) before topping out again, but Gilts are holding up better having carved out a fresh Liffe best at 123.59 (+6 ticks vs -21 ticks at one stage) in wake of last week&rsquo;s UK data that broadly missed consensus and took the edge off lofty tightening expectations for August&rsquo;s BoE policy meeting. Meanwhile, US Treasuries are treading a very tight line with the curve fractionally steeper ahead of the June National Activity Index and existing home sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The clear G10 outperformer on sourced reports suggesting that the BoJ will look at various policy tweaks at its end of July meeting, including potential changes to the way it manages the JGB yield curve to allow for a long-term natural increase. Even though Governor Kuroda denied any knowledge of the claims, Usd/Jpy retreated further from recent 113.00+ peaks to a low circa 110.75 before retesting offers around 111.00, while Jpy crosses also dropped sharply to 1+ week lows. Technically, the landscape will remain bearish if the headline pair closes below 111.25 (Fib), and more so sub-110.96 (30 DMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CHF/GBP - The next best majors and beneficiaries of US President Trump&rsquo;s efforts to curb Usd strength via tweets and tirades about China, the EU et al manipulating their currencies for unfair advantage vs the Usd (and the Fed not immune as he also expressed opposition against rate hikes). The Kiwi has rebounded above 0.6800, Franc extended gains towards 0.9900 and Cable firmly recovered 1.3100+ status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/AUD - All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback with the single currency maintaining around 1.1700, the Loonie holding above 1.3150 and Aud reclaiming 0.7400+ as China&rsquo;s Yuans hold off recent lows (Usd/Cny and Usd/Cnh both just below 6.8000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index is relatively rangebound between 94.200-450 after the G20 meeting and aforementioned Trump verbal intervention, with support seen circa the bottom end of the band and not a lot in terms of resistance until 95.000 and the ytd high of 95.652 set last Thursday. All in all, a quiet start to Monday&rsquo;s session, but US data later may provide some impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures sit comfortably in positive territory (WTI +1.0%, Brent +1.3%) with traders eyeing mounting geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran, while the benchmarks breached USD 69/bbl and USD 74/bbl respectively. Tensions between the two rose over the weekend after Iranian President Rouhani reiterated the US cannot stop its oil exports and warned Trump not to play with the lion&rsquo;s tail or he will regret it, while Trump responded aggressively in which he warned Rouhani to never threaten the US again or they will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. Earlier today, reports stated Total&rsquo;s North Sea oil platforms are hit by a 24-hour strike (as warned of at the end of last week) Price action for oil markets could also be swayed by any trade developments as European Commission Juncker heads to Washington on Thursday in an attempt to defuse tensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In metals markets, spot gold sits in minor negative territory alongside the modestly firmer USD.

Even though Governor Kuroda denied any knowledge of the claims, Usd/Jpy retreated further from recent 113.00+ peaks to a low circa 110.75 before retesting offers around 111.00, while Jpy crosses also dropped sharply to 1+ week lows. Technically, the landscape will remain bearish if the headline pair closes below 111.25 (Fib), and more so sub-110.96 (30 DMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CHF/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best majors and beneficiaries of US President Trump&rsquo;s efforts to curb Usd strength via tweets and tirades about China, the EU et al manipulating their currencies for unfair advantage vs the Usd (and the Fed not immune as he also expressed opposition against rate hikes). The Kiwi has rebounded above 0.6800, Franc extended gains towards 0.9900 and Cable firmly recovered 1.3100+ status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback with the single currency maintaining recovery gains above 1.1700, the Loonie holding above 1.3150 and Aud reclaiming 0.7400+ as China&rsquo;s Yuans hold off recent lows (Usd/Cny and Usd/Cnh both just below 6.8000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index is relatively rangebound between 94.200-450 after the G20 meeting and aforementioned Trump verbal intervention, with support seen circa the bottom end of the band and not a lot in terms of resistance until 95.000 and the ytd high of 95.652 set last Thursday.

The softness in the greenback helped its counterparts across the pond marginally extend on Friday&rsquo;s gains with EUR/USD at a firmer footing above 1.1700 and with GBP/USD near the 1.3150 level. Elsewhere, speculation of a BoJ policy tweak and current risk averse tone in Tokyo saw safe-haven JPY outperform its G10 currency peers with USD/JPY falling below the 111.00 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were range-bound overnight with WTI crude futures subdued but with the USD 68.00/bbl acting as a floor on prices. There was a lack moving newsflow for oil during the session, although geopolitical tensions between US and Iran turned up a notch after Iranian President Rouhani reiterated US cannot stop its oil exports and warned Trump not to play with the lion&rsquo;s tail or he will regret it, while Trump responded aggressively in which he warned Rouhani to never threaten the US again or they will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. Elsewhere, gold was flat after meeting resistance at USD 1235/oz and with prices taking a breather from last Friday&rsquo;s advances which were on the back of the Trump-induced USD weakness, while copper was also little changed amid the uneventful tone across commodities and mixed risk tone in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Rig Count (20/Jul) total rigs fell by 8 to 1046.

Trump added that US will no longer stand for Iran&rsquo;s demented words of violence &amp; death, while he warned the Iranian President to be cautious. This was after comments from Rouhani that the US cannot prevent Iran from exporting oil and who warned a confrontation would be the &#39;mother of all wars&#39;.

Volume was decent across the complex. Yield spreads were wider 2s30s by c.7bps, 2s10s by c.5bps and 5s30s by c.4bps.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks traded mixed with the regional bourses initially dampened across the board amid speculation the BoJ could discuss tweaking policy and after last week&rsquo;s renewed tariff threats from US President Trump who stated that the US is ready to impose tariffs on all USD 505bln of imported goods from China. ASX 200 (-0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.5%) were lower with Japan the underperformer amid a firmer JPY and slump in bonds after source reports suggested the BoJ may discuss potential policy changes at its meeting including the yield curve target to allow for a long-term natural increase. This was despite a denial by Governor Kuroda of having any knowledge of the basis for the reports and who stated that remarks would be inappropriate given the proximity of the bank&rsquo;s monetary policy meeting. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) also began subdued amid ongoing trade concerns, although later found some support from PBoC efforts in which the central bank injected CNY 502bln through its 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower by around 50 ticks shortly after the open on policy tightening fears which saw 10yr yields higher by around 6 bps. This later prompted the BoJ to announce its first fixed-rate buying operation since February to purchase an unlimited amount of 10yr JGBs at 0.110%, which effectively placed a floor on JGBs and helped them nurse part of day&rsquo;s losses.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade mostly subdued with sentiment dampened due to speculation the BoJ could discuss tweaking policy and after last week&rsquo;s renewed tariff threats from US President Trump who stated that the US is ready to impose tariffs on all USD 505bln of imported goods from China. ASX 200 (-0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.3%) are lower with Japan underperforming amid a firmer JPY and slump in bonds after source reports suggested the BoJ may discuss potential policy changes at its meeting including the yield curve target to allow for a long-term natural increase; this was despite a denial by Governor Kuroda of having any knowledge of the basis for the reports and who stated that remarks would be inappropriate given the proximity of the bank&rsquo;s monetary policy meeting. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch) were also subdued amid ongoing trade concerns, although later found some support from PBoC efforts after the central bank injected CNY 502bln through its 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remains softer after last week&rsquo;s Trump tirade against USD strength and higher rates, while President Trump also noted that China, EU and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower. The softness in the greenback helped its counterparts across the pond marginally extend on Friday&rsquo;s gains with EUR/USD edging a firmer footing above 1.1700 and with GBP/USD near the 1.3150 level. Elsewhere, speculation of a BoJ policy tweak and current risk averse tone in Tokyo saw safe-haven JPY outperform its G10 currency peers with USD/JPY falling below the 111.00 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower by around 50 ticks from the open on policy tightening fears which saw 10yr yields higher by around 6 bps. This later prompted the BoJ to announce its first fixed-rate buying operation since February in which it was willing to purchase an unlimited amount of 10yr JGBs at 0.110% which effectively placed a floor on JGBs and helped them nurse part of day&rsquo;s losses. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
