Further pressured by softer University of Michigan and JOLTS data was seen, with the EMINI returning to the 2650 area, a level that was revisited plenty of times this week. Despite earnings for three major financial names today (JPM, Citi, Wells &ndash; all beating the top and bottom line), the sector closed red on Friday, with the financial sector underperforming. Energy was the outperformer, supporting the SPX for the session on the back of higher oil prices. Apart from the financial earnings, the main story stock specific stories today surrounded chip names, Qualcomm (QCOM) &amp; Broadcom (AVGO), with the latter announcing a $12bln share repurchase programme after market on Thursday, and the former reportedly looking to become private in the next few months according to sources. M&amp;A news was relatively light compared to recent sessions, where the focus was on Mylan (MYL) reportedly in advanced negotiations for German Merck&rsquo;s KGaA (MRK GY) consumer health unit, sources suggest the bidding value is around $3.5bln. SPX -0.29% at 2656, NDX -0.42% at 6628, DJI -0.50% at 24360.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields were little changed on Friday with most action in the short end of the curve where 2yr yields rose to fresh (almost) decade highs. The rise in 2yr yields resulted in further flattening of the 2s10s and 2s30s curves (by around 3pbs). Treasuries were generally fulfilling their haven role, inversely moving to the direction of equities &ndash; particularly so after weak US data. Elsewhere, ahead of next week&rsquo;s auction of 5yr TIPS, the US Treasury has asked primary dealers opinion on increasing 5yr TIPS issuance in the second half of the year. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle half-a-tick higher at 120-15+.</p>\r\n",
