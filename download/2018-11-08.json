The statement was little changed, though the central bank amended its categorization of household spending and business investment, saying that &ldquo;Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year&rdquo; (previously, it said that &ldquo;household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly&rdquo;). There was not a lot to suggest that the Fed will back away from a fourth 2018 rate hike, at the December meeting; however, the implied chance of a December hike was volatile after the decision, but essentially was still knocking around 80%. There was initially a muted market reaction to the release, although in the aftermath, USD continued to push higher, while 2-year yields rising to 2.97%; in the equities complex, the ES saw choppy trade, but ultimately was little changed after the release, but around half-an-hour after the decision, equities moved lower, and the USD had gradually strengthened against some of the majors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU Commission sources reported on Thursday that a Brexit deal could be reached in the next few days, with some suggesting that a deal could be presented on Monday. A UK government source also stated it is unlikely that a British cabinet meeting will take place ahead of next week. With regards to negotiations, UK PM May has reportedly asked Brussels for more time to cut a Brexit deal to get an agreement with her Cabinet whilst EU Commission President Juncker noted a deal on Brexit negotiations is difficult. There were also comments from Former Brexit Secretary David Davis who said there is a high probability the parliament will reject PM May&rsquo;s plan and he believes this will in turn lead to Brussels conceding a better arrangement over a no deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>A Senior Chinese diplomat stated that US-China trade disputes should, and can, be appropriately resolved via talks. Separately, the European Commissioner for Jobs Katainen noted the EU is trying to avoid a trade war with the US but the prognosis is &quot;quite bad&quot; in regard to trade talks. In later trade, a source reported Canada is at odds with US changes to text of trade deal, although Ottawa does not feel the text problem would wreck the USMCA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>There were reports suggesting that the EU Commission believes the Italian budget measures will lead to a deficit/GDP ratio of 2.9% vs. the Italian government&#39;s view of 2.4%; the EU further noted the Italian deficit will keep widening through 2020 and does not forecast a 2019 reduction in Italian debt. The European Commission also downgraded Italy&rsquo;s 2018 GDP and inflation forecasts. Furthermore, the EU said to see mounting Italy risks and expected the 2020 deficit to breach 3%. In other news, Italian League lawmaker stated that the ruling coalition parties have struck an agreement over the statute of limitations, with Deputy PM Salvini confirming this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Draghi said that the risks to the Euro area growth are broadly balanced and reiterated he anticipates net asset purchases will end at the end of the year. He added the EU will stand behind Ireland on Brexit stressing that the ECB can change forward guidance if the outlook worsens; he sees wages gradually going up increasingly due to permanent effects. ECB&#39;s Nowotny (Hawk) said the ECB can&rsquo;t buy junk bonds as this would be dramatic. Elsewhere, the ECB bulletin stated that risks to global growth are tilted to the downside amid trade restrictions, echoing the ECB statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.25% at 2807, NDX -0.62% at 7156, DJI +0.04% at 26191. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -2.18%, Materials -0.56%, Industrials -0.25%, Cons Discretionary +0.01%, Cons Staples +0.02%, Healthcare +0.01%, Financials +0.32%, Tech -0.20%, Telecoms -0.93%, Utilities -0.26%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>TripAdvisor (TRIP) and Flowserve (FLS) surged today after both reporting strong EPS above street estimates. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) was a top mover following impressive same store sales growth. Discovery (DISCA) traded higher after raising its full year OIBDA growth. L Brands (LB) also made gains on the back of raising its Q3 EPS forecast. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) nosedived after missing EPS estimates and warning of a slowdown in the Macau region. Qualcomm (QCOM) was a bottom mover after lowering revenue forecasts. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) tumbled after warning of rising home prices and mortgage rates affecting demand, spreading into the wider industry with other stocks such as PulteGroup (PHM) also down on the day. Perrigo (PRGO) also a bottom mover on the back of lowering EPS and revenue estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 1.00 LOWER AT USD 60.67/BBL, BRENT (F8) SETTLES USD 1.42 LOWER AT USD 70.65/BBL. </strong>Oil started the day on a rise following record oil import data from China, although prices soon reversed and pared back gains turning negative. Mizuho bank said there was a &ldquo;trifecta of trouble created by US stockpile builds, OPEC overproduction and the watering down of Iran sanctions.&rdquo; In newsflow, a collision between a military frigate and an oil tanker in Norway was said to result in around 365k BPD of oil production shutting for 5-7 days. Also, Tanker tracker oil movements predict OPEC oil shipments will rise by 670k BPD in the November period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 6+ TICKS LOWER AT 117-26. </strong>Treasuries were lower once again for the session as mid-term election risk faded and as the FOMC kept rates unchanged as expected; the yield curve flattened after the central bank highlighted strong economic activity and with no mention on the recent market volatility. In pre-Fed trade the 10yr yield hit 3.223%, the highest level since May 2011. Most of the action was in the belly of the curve were yields were higher by c.3bps at settlement. 2s6730s and 5s30s were narrower by c.3bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The DXY extended gain above the 96.500 marker after an upbeat FOMC meeting, but the Greenback in general remains on a mixed footing overall vs major rivals, albeit ahead against most EMs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, SEK:</strong> Both ending Thursday&rsquo;s EU session where they kicked off, and outperforming as the Aud extended overnight gains to just over 0.7300 at one stage on the positive elements of latest Chinese trade data, while the Swedish Krona probed a bit further beyond key chart resistance vs the Eur through 10.2500 on more Riksbank policy guidance flagging a December or February 2019 hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie lost the prop of former crude prices, and extended above 1.3150 vs its US counterpart post-FOMC on the back of USD strength and despite strong Canadian housing starts (and a back month upgrade).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>More volatile price action for the single currency and Pound on the back of latest budget exchanges between Italy and the EU, contrasting Brexit headlines, media conjecture about the next UK Cabinet meeting and prospects of a deal with the EU. However, Eur/Usd remained within a 1.1405-45 range until falling victim of USD strength and slipping below the 1.1400 handle. Cable lost grip of the 1.3100 handle on several occasions and the Eur/Gbp cross ultimately floating around 0.8700 levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, CHF, JPY: </strong>All softer vs the Usd for the most part, as the Kiwi drifted down from nearly 0.6800 where a hefty option expiry (1 bn) and big figure offers sat in wake of the RBNZ that kept an ease on the table if needed, while only slightly tweaking the likely timing of a tightening from H2 2020 to Q2. Meanwhile, the Franc continued to meander between 1.0010-35 and the Jpy was equally restrained in a 113.50-99 band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>As noted above, regional currencies underperformed as the Dollar maintained recovery momentum after its US mid-term slide on Wednesday, with Usd/Try rebounding further from recent circa 5.3000 lows to 5.4500+ despite supportive/bullish commentary from the Turkish Finance and Economy Ministry.</p>\r\n",

However, Eur/Usd remained within a 1.1405-45 range as Cable lost grip of the 1.3100 handle on several occasions and the Eur/Gbp cross ultimately bounced from sub-0.8700 levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All softer vs the Usd for the most part, as the Kiwi drifted down from nearly 0.6800 where a hefty option expiry (1 bn) and big figure offers sat in wake of the RBNZ that kept an ease on the table if needed, while only slightly tweaking the likely timing of a tightening from H2 2020 to Q2. Meanwhile, the Franc continued to meander between 1.0010-35 and the Jpy was equally restrained in a 113.50-75 band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted above, regional currencies underperformed as the Dollar maintained recovery momentum after its US mid-term slide on Wednesday, with Usd/Try rebounding further from recent circa 5.3000 lows to 5.4500+ despite supportive/bullish commentary from the Turkish Finance and Economy Ministry.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) were both firmer from the get-go with tech the outperformer in Australia after a similar strong showing of the sector in US, while the Japanese benchmark ignored the largest drop on record for Machine Orders and was boosted by a weaker currency. Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.3%) initially benefitted from the heightened global risk appetite with the latter underpinned by a decline in money market rates after the PBoC&rsquo;s bill sale in Hong Kong the prior day, while participants also digested the latest trade data from China in which Trade Balance slightly missed but Exports and Imports both topped estimates.

(Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May has asked Brussels for more time to cut a Brexit deal. (The Sun). There were further reports in Austrian press, citing European Commission sources, reported that a Brexit deal could be reached within the next few days and presented on Monday. (Der Standard)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK government source stated that it is unlikely that a British cabinet meeting on Brexit will take place ahead of next week.

Similarly, after starting the session in the green major sectors are now somewhat mixed. underperformance is being seen in the consumer discretionary sector while financial names are outperforming as the sector is buoyed by SocGen (+3.0%) and Commerzbank (+3.5%) post-earnings. In terms of individual movers, Prosiebensat (-12.0%) are at the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after a miss on their earnings, while UniCredit (-4.0%) are also lower following pessimistic earnings due to write-downs for Turkey not being factored into estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index is holding relatively firm above the 96.000 handle within a fairly confined range awaiting the Fed and confirmation that it remains on course to deliver a 4th and final 25 bp hike in December. However, the Dollar is not ahead across the board vs G10 counterparts as it continues to struggle in wake of the mid-term/midweek wobble, and certain currency rivals glean support from independent factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK/AUD/CAD - All outperforming, albeit to varying degrees and not necessarily for obvious or intuitive reasons. The Scandi crowns have hawkish Central Bank vibes and mainly strong economic/fiscal fundamentals, as Eur/Sek tests 10.2600 bids/support having breached a key tech level above 10.3000 and Eur/Nok revisits 9.5000 with added fuel from a rebound in oil prices, albeit from fairly deep lows.

Hence, Bunds have not been able to muster much of a bounce from their 159.24 early Eurex low having been marked down 21 ticks initially at 159.28 and paring losses to 15 ticks at best. Ahead, aside from the impending EU cash bourse opens, heavy supply comes via Spain and France, while President Draghi is among a raft of ECB speakers and the latest monthly bulletin is also slated before attention turns to the FOMC.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) were both firmer from the get-go with tech the outperformer in Australia after a similar strong showing of the sector in US, while the Japanese benchmark ignored the largest drop on record for Machine Orders and was boosted by a weaker currency. Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (+0.9%) initially benefitted from the heightened global risk appetite with the latter underpinned by a decline in money market rates after the PBoC&rsquo;s bill sale in Hong Kong the prior day, while participants also digested the latest trade data from China in which Trade Balance slightly missed but Exports and Imports both topped estimates. Finally, 10yr JGBs initially tracked the downside in USTs as the rampant tone in equities weighed on safe-havens but with losses stemmed following firmer demand at today&rsquo;s enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr-20yr JGBs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses marginally extended on recent gains as the rally in stocks dampened demand for safe-haven JPY, while antipodeans were rangebound with AUD only mildly supported by the latest Chinese trade data and with NZD lacking direction following an unsurprising RBNZ policy announcement in which it maintained rates as expected at 1.75% and kept the option of a future rate cut on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBNZ maintained the Official Cash Rate at 1.75% as expected and kept guidance unchanged until 2020, while it sees OCR at 2.41% in December 2021 (Prev. 1.8%).

Gold was subdued by the firm USD and copper extended on recent losses despite the positive risk tone, with the latest trade data showing China copper imports in October fell to 423k tons vs. Prev. 520k tons M/M.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia is looking to raise crude output next year by 300k BPD unless a deal is struck with Saudi Arabia according to sources. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries drifted lower in post-elections trade as the Republicans kept the majority in Senate and Democrats retained control of the House, as expected, with the complex unreactive to US Attorney General Sessions resignation. The curve saw some modest bear-flattening as short-dated yields were higher by c.2bps while the long end showed yields below 1bps at settlement. 2s30s and 2s30s narrowed by c.3bps. The US Treasury sold 19bln in 30yr bonds, at a high yield of 3.344% tailing by 2.3bps. Demand was significantly weak with the bid-to-cover at the lowest level since February 2009. Looking at the breakdown, directs were awarded the smallest portion since September 2009, indirects took the smallest share since March and dealers were left with the largest slice since August 2015. US T-note futures (Z8) settled half-a-tick lower at 117-31+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he hopes to work with the Democrats on infrastructure and drug prices, as well as trade and economy, while he said he is not ruling out a government shutdown over border wall funding.

Whitaker - previously Sessions&#39; Chief of Staff - will become acting Attorney General with a permanent replacement to be nominated at a later date.

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.9%) were both firmer from the get-go with tech the outperformer in Australia after a similar strong showing of the sector in US, while the Japanese benchmark ignored the largest drop on record for Machine Orders and was boosted by a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.9%) benefitted from the heightened global risk appetite with the latter underpinned by a decline in money market rates after the PBoC&rsquo;s bill sale in Hong Kong the prior day, while participants also digested the latest trade data from China in which Trade Balance slightly missed but Exports and Imports both topped estimates. Finally, 10yr JGBs initially tracked the downside in USTs as the rampant tone in equities weighed on safe-havens but with losses stemmed following firmer demand at today&rsquo;s enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr-20yr JGBs.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.0%) gained from the open with tech outperforming in Australia after a similar strong performance of the sector in US, while Japanese sentiment and exporters are boosted by a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) also benefit from the heightened global risk appetite but with continued PBoC liquidity inaction and looming Chinese trade data capping upside in the mainland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets have calmed overnight with the greenback holding above the 96.00 level after the prior day&rsquo;s post-election rebound, while its major counterparts EUR/USD and GBP/USD have drifted sideways at the 1.1400 and 1.3100 handles respectively. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses marginally extend on recent gains as the rally in stocks dampen demand for safe-haven JPY, while antipodeans are rangebound with AUD tentative ahead of the latest China trade data and with NZD lacking direction following an unsurprising RBNZ policy announcement in which it maintained rates as expected at 1.75% and kept the option of a future rate cut on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs track the losses in USTs as the rampant tone in equities weigh on safe-havens and with participants also sidelined ahead of an enhanced liquidity auction for 2yr-20yr JGBs.</p>\r\n",
