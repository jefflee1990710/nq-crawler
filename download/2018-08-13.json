Later, WSJ reported The Saudi fund is said to consider increasing its 5% stake in Tesla (TSLA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Citron research were positive on Twitter (TWTR) giving them a yearly target of USD 52, and Diebold Nixdorf (DBD) is said to have hired advisors to look at a sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> WTI CRUDE FUTURES (U8) SETTLE&nbsp; 43C LOWER AT USD 67.20/BBL; BRENT CRUDE FUTURES (V8) SETTLE 20C LOWER AT USD 72.61/BBL.</strong> WTI &amp; Brent crude futures were relatively unreactive this morning with the OPEC Monthly report resulting in little to no reaction, however prices then took a hit in late morning trade which coincided with the weekly Genscape release, with newswires suggesting the inventory data showed a build from the previous week. Nonetheless oil pared back most of those losses heading into settlements, but still ended the session in negative territory. &nbsp;Tomorrow&rsquo;s API is expected to show a draw in Crude by 3.27mln, Distillates to build by 0.9mln and Gasoline to draw by 0.8mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>OPEC MONTHLY REPORT.</strong> Monday saw the release of the monthly OPEC report where secondary sources stated OPEC crude production fell 41k BPD in June to an average of 32.32.mln BPD. The report showed that output increased mostly in Kuwait, Nigeria, UAE and Iraq, whilst production showed declines in Libya, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Oil demand growth for 2018 is anticipated to increase by 1.64mln BPD, 20k BPD lower than last month&rsquo;s projections, mainly due to weaker-than-expected oil demand data from Latin America and the Middle East in Q218. 2019 world oil demand is expected to grow 1.43mln BPD, also 20k BPD lower than the previous report. Non-OPEC oil supply in 2018 was revised higher by 73k BPD from the previous report to an average of 59.62mln BPD, a 2.08mln BPD increase y/y. Non-OPEC oil supply in 2019 is expected to average 61.75mln BPD, showing an upward revision of 106k BPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE 4 TICKS LOWER AT &nbsp;120-08.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields rebounded from the 4-week lows seen in recent. The complex edged lower after the Turkish Central Bank announced liquidity release on Monday contributing to easing some global tensions. The yield curve saw some modest bear-steepening as most of the action was concentrated in the long end of the curve where 30yr yields were higher by c.3bps at settlement. 5s30s and 10s30s widened by c.1.5bps, 2s5s narrowed by c.1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>TRY:</strong> The Lira&rsquo;s fortunes continue to dominate, and a recurring theme appears to be panning out as verbal intervention, especially from President Erdogan largely ineffectual or even compounding Try weakness vs physical measures to turn try and the tide. Indeed, if there was any doubt about some of the sources of investor angst, the fact that various moves implemented by the CBRT to stem the tide actually seem to have helped (via deep RRR cuts and FX swap limits) highlights the importance of its independence, while reports that US Pastor Brunson may be released also underpinned the Lira even though rejected by the US Embassy in Ankara. USDTRY has settled back under 7.0000 vs 7.2000+ at one stage, albeit still well off sub-6.5000 lows before the Executive President&rsquo;s latest battle cries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>ZAR, MXN, RUB and CNH</strong> also weakened further, but recovered some losses alongside the TRY, along with the BRL after Brazil&rsquo;s Government stated it is prepared to intervene in FX and bond markets vs the SARB that is not yet ready to act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> USD</strong>: In contrast, the Dollar and index retreated from best levels with the DXY down below 96.200 at one stage vs 96.530 at the new YTD peak, but still bid by virtue of net gains vs some G10 counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> NZD, GBP, EUR, CAD:</strong> All ending Monday&rsquo;s EU session firmer vs the Greenback, following whippy moves earlier, with the Kiwi back towards the top of a 0.6595-50 range and AUDNZD testing bids around 1.1050, while Cable is inching closer to 1.2800 vs 1.2730 lows and the single currency is trading on either sides of 1.1400, but not troubling offers said to be waiting at 1.1440-50, yet. The Loonie has rebounded from 1.3175 lows to test near term chart support reported in the 1.3150-20 area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> AUD, JPY, CHF:</strong> The AUD has been lagging throughout with most to lose from an all-out US-China trade fall out and still tracking YUAN moves more closely than other G10s as a result. AUDUSD has bounced off worst levels, but remains capped ahead of 0.7300, while USDJPY has extended the upside of its range to 110.90+ and the Franc held within relatively tight 0.9920-55 trading parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> COMING-UP:</strong> UK Labour Market Report. On Tuesday the UK will release its most recent labour market data, with market participants looking for justification of the BoE&rsquo;s hike on August 8th. Wage growth remains the focus, with Average Earnings (Ex-Bonus) expected at 2.7%. This would mean that wages marginally exceeded headline CPI and developed real income growth for the 5th consecutive month. Coupling this with an unemployment rate forecast to stay at 4.2% in spite of fewer jobs added to the economy than previously (98k vs. 137k Prev.) would support the BoE&rsquo;s rhetoric of a tightening labour market and may offer a floor to a GBP that has been sliding ever since the BoE&rsquo;s meeting on August 8th, Brussels permitting, of course.</p>\r\n",

Indeed, if there was any doubt about some of the sources of investor angst, the fact that various moves implemented by the CBRT to stem the tide actually seem to have helped (via deep RRR cuts and FX swap limits) highlights the importance of its independence, while reports that US Pastor Brunson may be released also underpinned the Lira even though rejected by the US Embassy in Ankara. Usd/Try has settled back under 7.0000 vs 7.2000+ at one stage, albeit still well off sub-6.5000 lows before the Executive President&rsquo;s latest battle cries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zar, Mxn, Rub and Cnh also weakened further, but recovered some losses alongside the Try, along with the Brl after Brazil&rsquo;s Government stated it is prepared to intervene in FX and bond markets vs the SARB that is not yet ready to act..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, the Dollar and index retreated from best levels with the DXY down below 96.200 at one stage vs 96.530 at the new ytd peak, but still bid by virtue of net gains vs some G10 counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/GBP/EUR/CAD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All ending Monday&rsquo;s EU session firmer vs the Greenback, following whippy moves earlier, with the Kiwi back towards the top of a 0.6595-50 range and Aud/Nzd testing bids around 1.1050, while Cable is inching closer to 1.2800 vs 1.2730 lows and the single currency is staging a firmer rebound through 1.1400, but not troubling offers said to be waiting at 1.1440-50, yet. The Loonie has rebounded from 1.3175 lows to test near term chart support reported in the 1.3150-20 area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY/CHF &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aud has been lagging throughout with most to lose from an all out US-China trade fall out and still tracking YUAN moves more closely than other G10s as a result. Aud/Usd has bounced off worst levels, but remains capped ahead of 0.7300, while Usd/Jpy has extended the upside of its range to 110.90+ and seems on course to close above its 55 DMA (110.75) and the Franc held within relatively tight 0.9920-55 trading parameters.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Germany&rsquo;s DAX 30 is dragged lower by its third largest constituent, Bayer (-11.2%), after recently acquired Monsanto was ordered to pay USD 289mln in fines as a court ruled the company&rsquo;s weedkiller caused cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10 year EU benchmarks probed a bit further either side of parity in recent trade, but have reverted to sit flat or very close to previous settlement levels amidst the ongoing EM malaise and other areas of risk, ie from global trade/tariff rifts, the Brexit stalemate and Italy&rsquo;s new Government challenging the EU&rsquo;s fiscal rules. Bunds and Gilts climbed to fresh intraday highs of 163.53 and 123.74 respectively before retreating to revisit or set new session lows on Eurex and Liffe at 163.22 and 123.50, but are now back to within a handful of ticks from unchanged, while US Treasuries are nearer overnight troughs, but rangy and the curve a little steeper against the backdrop of marginally lower Fed hike expectations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY - The Lira remains front and centre of attention after more rousing attempts by Turkish President Erdogan to shore up the currency and coral support from the international investor community largely fell on deaf ears, with Usd/Try soaring through 7.0000 to a new record peak around 7.2150, and prompting the CBRT into action. However, still unable to intervene via conventional means (ie rate hikes) the Bank resorted to cutting Reserve Requirement Ratios for non-core FX liabilities by 400 bp alongside the Lira Required Reserve by 250 bp for all maturities, and the relief has been relatively limited as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Lira contagion has spread further across the region, with the Rand hit especially hard (Usd/Zar 15.4700+ at one stage , but the Idr, Twn and other Asian units also weakening to intervention tolerance levels, while the Mxn has unwound more NAFTA-related gains to trade back below 19.0000 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Riding high amidst all the turmoil in high-beta/risk/yield currency counterparts, with the index just off fresh 2018 highs at 96.530, and now looking at chart targets ahead of 97.000 with fair resistance seen around 96.841.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Still bucking overall trends and outperforming due to its ultra safe-haven allure, with Usd/Jpy pulling back further from 111.00 and through 110.50 to test the water ahead of 110.00 where decent expiry option interest resides (1.3 bn up to 110.05 to be precise).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/EUR - The biggest G10 losers and most adversely impacted by broad risk aversion again, with Aud/Usd sitting mid-range between 0.7250-0.7300 and the single currency down through 1.1400 to test the 200 WMA at 1.1360 before regaining a degree of composure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP/CHF/NZD - The Loonie is holding within a 1.3140-75 range vs its US rival and well off recent highs as Canada&rsquo;s diplomatic row with Saudi Arabia rumbles on, while Cable has pared some losses from a circa 1.2730 low, but remains capped well ahead of 1.2800 amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty. The Franc veers from 0.9920-55 vs the Greenback and Kiwi hovers in a 0.6550-95 band, displaying more resilience than is antipodean peer on less exposure to Chine-US trade wars (and another rise in the PBoC&rsquo;s Usd/Cny midpoint fix).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (Unch) is flat on the day, while Brent (+0.3%) is modestly supported as US sanctions against Iran point towards tighter supply. WTI and Brent are in close proximity their 50 HMA to the downside at USD 67.14/bbl and USD 72.43/bbl respectively. Also of note: the OPEC Monthly Report is due to be released at 11:55BST. Elsewhere, spot gold fell to the lowest since March 15th 2017, weighed by the greenback as the yellow metal detaches itself from safe-haven properties. London copper is subdued on USD action and the risk-off sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&#39;s Oil Corporation says Iran is giving insurance cover for oil shipments, having enough term oil shipments to cushion any Iranian shortfall. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Workers at three of Total&rsquo;s North Sea oil platforms are to start a 12-hour strike at 12:00BST. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

However, still unable to intervene via conventional means (ie rate hikes) the Bank resorted to cutting Reserve Requirement Ratios for non-core FX liabilities by 400 bp alongside the Lira Required Reserve by 250 bp for all maturities, and the relief has been relatively limited as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lira contagion has spread further across the region, with the Rand hit especially hard (Usd/Zar 15.4700+ at one stage , but the Idr, Twn and other Asian units also weakening to intervention tolerance levels, while the Mxn has unwound more NAFTA-related gains to trade back below 19.0000 vs the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riding high amidst all the turmoil in high-beta/risk/yield currency counterparts, with the index just off fresh 2018 highs at 96.530, and now looking at chart targets ahead of 97.000 with fair resistance seen around 96.841.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still bucking overall trends and outperforming due to its ultra safe-haven allure, with Usd/Jpy pulling back further from 111.00 and through 110.50 to test the water ahead of 110.00 where decent expiry option interest resides (1.3 bn up to 110.05 to be precise).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest G10 losers and most adversely impacted by broad risk aversion again, with Aud/Usd sitting mid-range between 0.7250-0.7300 and the single currency down through 1.1400 to test the 200 WMA at 1.1360 before regaining a degree of composure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP/CHF/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie is holding within a 1.3140-75 range vs its US rival and well off recent highs as Canada&rsquo;s diplomatic row with Saudi Arabia rumbles on, while Cable has pared some losses from a circa 1.2730 low, but remains capped well ahead of 1.2800 amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty. The Franc veers from 0.9920-55 vs the Greenback and Kiwi hovers in a 0.6550-95 band, displaying more resilience than is antipodean peer on less exposure to Chine-US trade wars (and another rise in the PBoC&rsquo;s Usd/Cny midpoint fix).</p>\r\n",

This pressured the major indices from the get-go with ASX 200 (-0.6%) dragged by mining names, while Nikkei 225 (-1.9%) underperformed on safe-haven flows into JPY and with Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting down 15% post-earnings. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-1.7%) and Hang Seng (-1.9%) were also heavily weighed alongside the broad EM-triggered mayhem and continued liquidity inaction by the PBoC.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD/TRY initially surged over 10% against the greenback to above the 7.0000 handle in continuation of the TRY sell-off and after a defiant tone from President Erdogan. This was then brought back down after measures from Turkey in which the banking regulator placed a limit on FX swaps, although the support was brief and USD/TRY resumed its surge and homed in on the earlier record highs. This triggered EM currency contagion fears in which ZAR slumped as much as 10% to its lowest in over 2 years, while TWD fell to its weakest since March 2017 and IDR declined to a near 3-year low which prompted Bank Indonesia intervention. The turmoil underpinned safe-haven currencies across the board with JPY the notable benefactor, while USD also strengthened against most its major counterparts which saw EUR/USD slip below 1.1400 and AUD/USD relinquish the 0.7300 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkish President Erdogan stated the economy is not in a crisis and that weakness in TRY is a currency plot, while he added that Turkey will win this economic war and are undergoing preparations to use national currencies for trade with nations such as China and Russia. There were also comments from Turkish Finance Minister Albayrak that the government has an action plan regarding the currency and will take necessary measures on Monday to ease market concerns, while he stated they will not convert nor seize FX deposits and that the currency is being directly targeted by the US President. In related news, Turkish Presidency Communication Chief Altun stated Erdogan&rsquo;s comments were a warning against FX flight, while the banking regulator also announced to limit swap transactions in which banks&rsquo; total swap transactions has been capped at 50% of banks&rsquo; equity.

As such, WTI crude futures were relatively flat as the rebound from Friday stalled ahead of the USD 68.00/bbl level, while metals were also uneventful in which gold was subdued by a firmer green back and copper languished amid the risk averse tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Baker Hughes Total Rig Count (10 Aug) 1057 (Prev. 1044).

Amid decent volume, the short end of the curve was hit more than the long end; 5yr yields were lower by c.7bps and 30yr yields were lower by c.6bps.The 10yr yield posted the biggest one-day fall since late May, hitting a low of 2.85%. 2s5s narrowed by c2.5bps, 2s10 by c.2bps, whilst 5s30 widened by c.1.5bps.

Indeed, Bunds have only traded lower off the 163.46 open vs last Friday&rsquo;s 163.34 close to a 163.22 low before finding some underlying bids/support as the 10 year Italian benchmark lost grip of the 124.00 handle.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week lower across the board with sentiment in the region spooked on spill-over concerns as the Turkish lira extends on last week&rsquo;s slump after a defiant tone from Turkish President Erdogan, which triggered capital control concerns and who labelled the weakness in TRY as a &lsquo;currency plot&rsquo;. This pressured the major indices from the get-go with ASX 200 (-0.5%) dragged by mining names, while Nikkei 225 (-1.6%) underperforms amid safe-haven flows into JPY and with Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting dropping 16% post-earnings. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) and Hang Seng (-1.5%) are also heavily weighed alongside the broad EM-triggered mayhem and continued liquidity inaction by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD/TRY surged over 10% against the greenback to above the 7.0000 handle in continuation of the TRY sell-off and after a defiant tone from President Erdogan. This was then brought back down after measures from Turkey in which the banking regulator placed a limit on FX swaps, although the support was brief and USD/TRY resumed its surge and homed in on the earlier record highs. This triggered EM currency contagion fears which saw ZAR slump as much as 10% to its lowest in over 2 years, while TWD fell to its weakest since March 2017 and IDR declined to a near 3-year low which prompted Bank Indonesia intervention. The turmoil underpinned safe-haven currencies across the board with JPY the notable benefactor, while USD also strengthened against most its major counterparts with EUR/USD slipping below 1.1400 and AUD/USD relinquishing the 0.7300 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices underpinned by safe-haven demand, although upside is also capped amid a lack of Rinban announcement with the BoJ only in the market for Treasury discount bills.</p>\r\n",
