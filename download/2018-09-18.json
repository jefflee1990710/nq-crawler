        "subject": "PREVIEW: Bank of Japan expected to keep policy unchanged today following the more flexible approach announced at the prior meeting",
        "content": "<p>The Bank of Japan will conclude its 2-day policy meeting on Wednesday in which expectations are one-sided for the central bank keep its policy settings unchanged with the bank rate to be maintained at -0.1% and long-term yield target held at around 0.0%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The consensus for the BoJ to remain on hold comes after the July meeting where the BoJ maintained its interest rate and yield target but announced more flexibility and adopted forward guidance on rates which it said will be maintained at very low levels for an extended period. The BoJ also announced it would permit upward and downward moves in 10yr yields but will buy JGBs promptly and appropriately in the event of a rapid increase in yields, while it lowered the balance of reserves for which NIRP is applied and adjusted its ETF purchases for greater Topix and reduced Nikkei/JPX inclusions. Therefore, considering that the BoJ just recently conducted the tweaks at its last meeting, which was aimed at ensuring the sustainability of its ultra-loose policy, it is highly unlikely for the central bank announce further adjustments so soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent key data releases have been mixed which favours a wait-and-see approach with headline National CPI (0.9% vs. Exp. 1.0%, Prev. 0.7%) and Core CPI (0.8% vs. Exp. 0.9%, Prev. 0.8%) both softer than expected and below the halfway point to the BoJ&rsquo;s target which suggests BoJ are nowhere near to exiting loose policy. In addition, a firm upward revision in Q2 Annualised GDP to 3.0% vs. Exp. 2.6% (Prev. 1.9%) also points to a lack of urgency for further stimulus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the BoJ rhetoric, BoJ Governor Kuroda commented shortly after the last meeting that he sees no need for additional easing for now and that forward guidance means to keep rates extremely low for an extended period of time. Kuroda further added that he expects factors that delayed an increase in inflation to dissipate in the future and that momentum towards 2% inflation is firmly in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, not all are impressed as board member and notorious dovish dissenter Kataoka stated he anticipates little chances for Japan&#39;s economy momentum to reach the price target being heightened under the current framework and that the BoJ didn&#39;t need to allow more flexibility in long-term yields when it was reducing price forecasts. Furthermore, Kataoka commented that BoJ&#39;s new forward guidance only states the obvious and that permitting long-term yields to rise could delay reaching price target, while he proposed that the BoJ should expand stimulus to achieve price target quicker instead of taking measures to prolong the period of easy policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, there is no exact scheduled time for the policy announcement which tends to be any time after the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0330BST/2130CDT/1030HKT, while focus will also be on the statement and the composition of votes which was previously 7-2 for YCC.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Unum Group (UNM) surged after announcing it would resume buybacks. L Brands (LB) was higher after BAML upgraded the name.

Additionally, policymakers added in their statements the desire to continue constructive talks. Into the North America sessions, sellers were out in force, with rate locks on corporate new issuance and hedge fund positioning ahead of next week&#39;s FOMC no longer offset by the pension community now that the deadline for tax relief has passed, Informa reported. There was also some attention on a four-week bill sale out of the US, which sold at 2.02%. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 10+ ticks lower at 118-25+.</p>\r\n",

Trump also threatened China with additional tariffs on $267bln worth of goods if China were to retaliate (this would then cover almost all US imports of Chinese goods). After the tariffs were announced, an official from China&#39;s MOFCOM said cooperation between US and China is the only correct option on trade, lending some relief to risk assets. However, in an official statement, China said it had no choice but to retaliate. Following the warning, and after filing a complaint at the WTO, China announced it is to impose levies ranging from 5% to 10% on USD 60bln worth of US goods (10% rates will be imposed on goods previously listed for 20% and 25% and 5% rates will be imposed on goods previously listed for 10%), effective on September 24th, responding reciprocally to the US as the additional China tariffs are also set to go into effect at the same time. Note that parts of the statement released by China reiterated some of the MOFCOM comments overnight which stated the country wants to maintain relationship and trade dialogue with the US although earlier a report in Chinese press also said Beijing is likely to cancel plans for trade talks after the US&#39; latest moves; China&#39;s Vice Premier Liu was said to be preparing to visit Washington for talks next week, and there has been some suggestion that the deputy leader of the MOFOM may instead go next week to Washington for low level talks. In later trade, US President Trump said the US is having a tremendous impact on China, adding he cannot let it take advantage of the US and noting he may make a deal at some point. He added he is always open to talks with China, but he warned of more tariffs if China retaliates on agricultural industry. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />* <strong>FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Rosengren (Non-Voter) stated that it is becoming more difficult for the Fed give forward guidance on rates, adding that he can &quot;imagine getting at a point after a few more tightenings where there is going to be less certainty about what the next move would be.&rdquo; Rosengren also said that &ldquo;we do need to be concerned about financial excesses&rdquo; and that &ldquo;at a time when tariffs are going up there may be an opportunity in a tight labour market for firms to more easily pass on price increases&rdquo;.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Ahead of the Salzburg summit, which gets underway on Wednesday, the Evening Standard reported comments from a top EU official, who stated it is ready to make minor changes for the sake of a deal, such as moving customs checks away from the border. But the EU was sticking to its original &#39;backstop&#39; proposal. On the Irish side, PM Varadkar stated there must be a backstop agreement to reach an agreement on Brexit, noting he is willing to show some flexibility on the language of the agreement but not the outcome. Moreover, Irish Foreign Minister Coveney noted the EU solidarity with Ireland is getting stronger on Brexit, urging the UK to engage intensively and in detail on a backstop.&nbsp;<br />Elsewhere, UK PM May Spokesman said that Weber, Leader of the European People&rsquo;s Party in the European Parliament, recognized that the Chequers proposals were a step forward and once again stressed the priority is to find a resolution on the Irish border. On the EU front, EU&#39;s Barnier said an orderly Brexit is needed to protect rights of EU citizens and EU investment in regional projects; in later comments he suggested the October EU leaders meeting will be the &quot;moment of truth&quot; as it will be possible to see whether EU agreement is within reach.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* SPX +0.5% at 2904, NDX +0.8% at 7494, DJI +0.7% at 26247. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +0.7%, Materials +0.1%, Industrials +0.9%, Cons Discretionary 1.3%, Cons Staples 0.4%, Healthcare +0.5%, Financials +0.4%, Tech +0.6%, Telecoms -0.0%, Utilities -0.2%.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Micron (MU) traded higher on Tuesday, ahead of earnings on Thursday, as other chipmakers rebounded after losses incurred on Monday. Unum Group (UNM) surged after announcing it would resume buybacks. L Brands (LB) was higher after BAML upgraded the name. Union Pacific (UNP) announced an operations overhaul plan, sending shares north. FedEx (FDX) earnings AMC on Monday failed to excite, and brokers BAML and Credit Suisse downgraded the logistics firm. Autozone (AZO) was also lower after EPS. In M&amp;A, Marsh &amp; Mclennan was lower after it agreed to purchase Jardine Lloyd Thompson for USD 5.7bln. Symantec (SYMC) was among the top performers following new board appointments, which has been welcomed by some brokers as a step in the right direction. In other boardroom news, Netflix (NFLX) traded up after appointing Axel Springer&#39;s Mathias Dopfner to its board. And Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM) were also higher on reports that are in talks to add two new directors. NVIDIA (NVDA) was upgraded at Mizuho. Kraft (KHC) was lower after General Mills (GID) poor earnings report, which also weighed on Campbell Soup (CPB) and JM Smucker (SJM).&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES 94C HIGHER AT $69.85/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLES &nbsp;98C HIGHER AT $79.03/BBL. </strong>Saudi Arabia said it was comfortable with oil prices over $80 per barrel, sources reported, leading to oil prices to rise on Tuesday. Earlier in September, it was understood that Saudi Arabia was (some say under the pressure of the US ahead of midterms) comfortable with prices between $70-$80/bbl, so if true, the view report represents a firming of its views. JODI data signalled that Saudi exports were 7.12mn BPD in July, falling from 7.28mlnl output was down by 201k BPD in the month to 10.288mln BPD. Meanwhile, in Iran, reports suggest that Iranian crude exports have dropped by 900k BPD since April, taking it around 1.6mln BPD. &quot;The decline so far has already resulted in tighter markets and oil once again approaching&nbsp;$80/bbl, and with additional declines likely into the November 4 sanctions deadline, I would not be surprised to see the oil price move higher still,&quot; UBS said. OPEC&#39;s JMMC meeting on 23 September is also capturing attention; the Cartel&#39;s Secretary General Barkindo said OPEC will decide by December on a way of formalising permanent cooperation between OPEC and partners. However, expectations are low for anything material to be decided at the JMMC, which will likely be a forum for new ideas from members; UBS says that long-term cooperation between OPEC and its partners will contribute to crude market stability, but production declines in Venezuela and Iran are testing near-term spare capacity, and UBS expects therefore that oil risks are still skewed to the upside. After the bell, API inventories are expected to show crude stocks declined by 2.7mln barrels in the week, stocks at Cushing are seen slipping by 2.2mln barrels, distillates are expected to build by 700, while gasoline is seen drawing by 100k.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 10+ TICKS LOWER AT 118-25+. </strong>The US Treasury curved bear-steepened on Tuesday, with 2s10s widening by 4bps, 5s30s around 2bps wider, and 2s30s wider by around 5bps (reports of hedge funds initiating steepeners ahead of next week&#39;s FOMC). Yields on 2s and 3s saw fresh decade+ highs. Traders were happy to be sellers on Tuesday after the tariffs that the US announced on Chinese imports, and the Chinese retaliation, was at rates more benign than had been feared. Additionally, policymakers added in their statements the desire to continue constructive talks. Into the North America sessions, sellers were out in force, with rate locks on corporate new issuance and hedge fund positioning ahead of next week&#39;s FOMC no longer offset by the pension community now that the deadline for tax relief has passed, Informa reported. There was also some attention on a four-week bill sale out of the US, which sold at 2.02%.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>* USD: </strong>The bid following the announcement of new tariffs on Chinese imports was short-lived, with DXY falling to lows around 94.30; traders suggested that the latest wave of tariffs was benign compared with what could have been announced. However, DXY went positive in afternoon trade after EURUSD stumbled on technicals, helping the DXY to rise to 94.70. * CAD: The Loonie was trading on the domestic data theme, (for once, given that officials have been making the same noises on NAFTA for some time, offering little by way of new info). USDCAD dropped as oil prices rose, and Canadian manufacturing sales beat expectations, keeping alive the narrative that the BOC will lift rates in October, and lingering sub-1.30 heading into APAC trade. Scotiabank&#39;s analysts say the break through 1.30 sets up a retest of key support at 1.2890 (late Aug low) and 1.2863 (200-day MA), from a technical perspective. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CNH, AsiaFX: </strong>Some have been surprised that the latest escalation in global trade wars hasn&#39;t put an aggressive bid into the yen. One theory is that the yuan has remained steady (PBOC using its counter cyclical factor in its fixings, which has helped anchor Asia FX, as SocGen points out, noting that for AsiaFX, &quot;the drip, drip of tariff news and the metronomic Fed tightening cycle are water-torture for&nbsp;<br />emerging market investors and discouraging dip-buyers&quot;). Another factor may be that the VIX hasn&#39;t spiked aggressively higher either. More domestically focussed, he BOJ is set to conclude its policy meeting overnight and while no fireworks are expected, the tone of its forward guidance will be monitored. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Ahead of the Brexit summit in Austria, sterling is firm, taking advantage of USD weakness in the early part of the day. Analysts have cited the positive tone of EU officials (though Ireland continues to sound warnings). Morgan Stanley expects the pound to perform well going into the summit, though says that &quot;while we are GBP-bullish ahead of the Salzburg EU summit, we hold back from selling EURGBP. Instead, we trade our bullish GBP call against the USD and the China-focused AUD.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Once again, the RBA said that the next move in rates is likely to be up, its minutes overnight stated, although it did not see the case for a near-term adjustment in policy. The bank remained upbeat about growth, seeing it above trend over its forecast horizon, and welcomed the modest decline in the Aussie, which it says has been good for growth. On the flip side, the RBA noted that trade risks are becoming a risk to global growth. In European/US trade, the Aussie held up well, with the USD on the back foot, and with traders comfortable that the latest wave of tariffs was more benign than expected. The risk-on feeling that followed helped the Aussie rise through 0.7200 once again as stocks rallied, though action was capped above 0.7220, with some citing yield differentials, others citing positioning, which could make it tricky for the Aussie to see meaningful upside rallies towards 0.7350-0.74, IFR said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP &ndash; BOJ Monetary Policy Meeting (Sep 2018) </strong>due after Tokyo lunch break at 0330 BST (2130 CDT, 1030 HKT) on 19th September 2018. BoJ unlikely to announce further adjustments after making tweaks at their July meeting. The recent key data releases have been mixed which favours a wait-and-see approach. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20108/download\"><em><strong>Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview. &nbsp;</strong></em></a></p>\r\n",

Earlier in September, it was understood that Saudi Arabia was (some say under the pressure of the US ahead of midterms) comfortable with prices between $70-$80/bbl, so if true, the view report represent a firming of its views. JODI data signalled that Saudi exports were 7.12mn BPD in July, falling from 7.28mlnl output was down by 201k BPD in the month to 10.288mln BPD. Meanwhile, in Iran, reports suggest that Iranian crude exports have dropped by 900k BPD since April, taking it around 1.6mln BPD. &quot;The decline so far has already resulted in tighter markets and oil once again approaching $80/bbl, and with additional declines likely into the November 4 sanctions deadline, I would not be surprised to see the oil price move higher still,&quot; UBS said. OPEC&#39;s JMMC meeting on 23 September is also capturing attention; the Cartel&#39;s Secretary General Barkindo said OPEC will decide by December on a way of formalising permanent cooperation between OPEC and partners. However, expectations are low for anything material to be decided at the JMMC, which will likely be a forum for new ideas from members; UBS says that long-term cooperation between OPEC and its partners will contribute to crude market stability, but production declines in Venezuela and Iran are testing near-term spare capacity, and UBS expects therefore that oil risks are still skewed to the upside. After the bell, API inventories are expected to show crude stocks declined by 2.7mln barrels in the week, stocks at Cushing are seen slipping by 2.2mln barrels, distillates are expected to build by 700, while gasoline is seen drawing by 100k.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index and Usd overall is trading lower again after the DXY topped out above 94.500 for the umpteenth time, and only the JPY is performing worst as broad risk sentiment remains resilient through all the unfolding trade war manoeuvres. In fact, there is a distinct and somewhat perverse sense of relief following the anticipated &lsquo;retaliation&rsquo; from Beijing that will see $60 bn US goods targeted vs $200 bn Chinese imports, and also at lower rates of 5-10% vs the previously postured 10-25%. Hence, Usd/majors bar Usd/Jpy (which has now absorbed 112.25 supply and eyeing 112.50 barriers) are lower and the inverse pairs higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clear G10 outperformers, with Aud/Usd firming above 0.7200 again as one of the main proxies for the state (or perception) of US-China/global relations, while the Loonie is retesting resistance through 1.3000 vs its US counterpart with the added bonus of stronger than forecast Canadian manufacturing sales data and an upgrade to the previous month, awaiting the next stage of NAFTA talks due on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/NZD/CHF &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All pretty even in terms of percentage gains vs the Greenback with the single currency having another look at 1.1700 and beyond, but falling shy of August&rsquo;s high (1.1734), while the Kiwi remains capped ahead of 0.6600 and looking towards the GDT auction results. The Franc has inched closer to 0.9600, but holding just below ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s SNB policy assessment amidst some market talk that the Chf wording could be tweaked given recent strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable is still pivoting 1.3150 and Eur/Gbp is keeping tabs on 0.8900 in the face of less upbeat Brexit talk on balance for a change, as EU officials are said to be sticking to their stance on the Irish border rather than prepared to relax conditions regarding custom checks for less friction. However, the Pound should get some independent impetus from a macro angle with the latest UK CPI and PPI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from more attention on the Try and weakness overall within 6.3070-6.4640 parameters vs the Usd despite a rise in the RRR from 7% to 13%, the Huf was volatile around the NBH policy meeting and headlines indicating a delayed news conference that aroused bulls to a potential surprise (vs consensus for unchanged benchmark rates). In the event, the moves were technical, with the 3 month depo to be replaced by reserves as the main instrument from the end of 2018 and the central message was policy normalisation coming, but not yet. Eur/Huf duly pared losses, albeit net up on the day.</p>\r\n",

This pressured ASX 200 (-0.4%) with the index dragged by commodity-related sectors as well as tech stocks following similar underperformance in their US counterparts, while Nikkei 225 (+1.5%) showed resilience on return from its extended weekend amid reports that Japan is to offer measures to lower the trade surplus with US in an effort to avert auto tariffs. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp.

Furthermore, the official stated the US move on trade has poisoned atmosphere for negotiations, although both sides can sit down to talk about reducing trade deficit and that China will push ahead with financial market opening.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equites are currently in the green, as US-China tariff action has been digested as less severe than was first anticipated with ABN Amro saying that &ldquo;Given regular FX fluctuations, input prices and flexibility for both importers and exporters to adjust margins somewhat, a 10% import tariff might not have a strong impact on bilateral trade flows&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DAX is outperforming, whilst the FTSE is the underperformer in Europe with a lack of upside catalysts and softness seen in index heavyweights such as British American Tobacco, ITV and Marks and Spencer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The consumer discretionary sector is lagging its peers, dragged on by Zalando as the co. has issued its second negative guidance revision in as many months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G10 - An almost clear divide between winners and losers vs a still generally soft Usd (DXY struggling to sustain rebounds off sub-94.500 lows), with the AUD and NZD leading their major counterparts even though China has now hit back, or at least vowed to fight fire with fire in the latest exchange of import tariffs with the US. Aud/Usd is back on the 0.7200 handle and the Kiwi is hovering just under 0.6600 after little reaction to overnight RBA minutes, and ahead of the latest GDT auction that is expected to extend the run of price declines. The CHF and CAD are next best, with the Franc testing resistance around 0.9600 and Loonie recovering from another dip below 1.3050 following mixed NAFTA comments from Canadian PM Trudeau noting progress towards a deal with the US, but a determination to stand firm by its demands from a renegotiated accord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR, JPY and GBP have all been choppy vs the Greenback, with the single currency attempting to build on recovery gains beyond 1.1700, but retreating relatively sharply on the Beijing verbal retaliation, while Usd/Jpy was absorbing offers at 112.25 before reversing to sub-112.00 levels again on the same wire headlines. Note also, hefty option expiries may exert influence for both pairs into the NY cut, with 1.1 bn in Eur/Usd at the 1.1680 strike and 1.3 bn at 112.00 in Usd/Jpy. Elsewhere, Cable was climbing steadily above 1.3150 before stalling on the aforementioned strike back by China, but also more Brexit banter from all sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Amidst a raft of rhetoric from Asia and South East Asia about trade wars, sanctions and local currency depreciation, the Lira has emerged weaker yet again, with Usd/Try up to circa 6.3800 at one stage and hardly reacting to more intervention via the CBRT jacking up its RRR to 13% from 7%. Conversely, the Zar and Rub are benefiting from the broadly softer Dollar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core bonds remain firm, but off intraday peaks in wake of a relatively comfortable if not solid German Schatz auction. Bunds are still relatively well bid ahead of 159.00 vs 159.26 (+24 ticks) at best, and Gilts are just 9 ticks shy of their 121.55 Liffe high (+14 ticks) in keeping with a pull-back in US Treasuries and marginal steepening, which may well be fuelled by firmer oil prices after Saudi Arabia implied tolerance, or an acceptance of Brent climbing to around $80/brl. Note also, the recovery in Italian debt futures may also be taking some of the shine away from Bunds and mainstream peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is benefitting from source reports suggesting that Saudi Arabia is said to be comfortable with oil above USD 80/bbl, with the fossil fuel extending on gains seen in yesterdays trade, additionally WTI broke through its 100DMA to the upside.

Aud/Usd is back on the 0.7200 handle and the Kiwi is hovering just under 0.6600 after little reaction to overnight RBA minutes, and ahead of the latest GDT auction that is expected to extend the run of price declines. The CHF and CAD are next best, with the Franc testing resistance around 0.9600 and Loonie recovering from another dip below 1.3050 following mixed NAFTA comments from Canadian PM Trudeau noting progress towards a deal with the US, but a determination to stand firm by its demands from a renegotiated accord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR, JPY and GBP have all been choppy vs the Greenback, with the single currency attempting to build on recovery gains beyond 1.1700, but retreating relatively sharply on the Beijing verbal retaliation, while Usd/Jpy was absorbing offers at 112.25 before reversing to sub-112.00 levels again on the same wire headlines. Note also, hefty option expiries may exert influence for both pairs into the NY cut, with 1.1 bn in Eur/Usd at the 1.1680 strike and 1.3 bn at 112.00 in Usd/Jpy. Elsewhere, Cable was climbing steadily above 1.3150 before stalling on the aforementioned strike back by China, but also more Brexit banter from all sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Amidst a raft of rhetoric from Asia and South East Asia about trade wars, sanctions and local currency depreciation, the Lira has emerged weaker yet again, with Usd/Try up to circa 6.3800 at one stage and hardly reacting to more intervention via the CBRT jacking up its RRR to 13% from 7%. Conversely, the Zar and Rub are benefiting from the broadly softer Dollar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core bonds remain firm, but off intraday peaks in wake of a relatively comfortable if not solid German Schatz auction. Bunds are still relatively well bid ahead of 159.00 vs 159.26 (+24 ticks) at best, and Gilts are just 9 ticks shy of their 121.55 Liffe high (+14 ticks) in keeping with a pull-back in US Treasuries and marginal steepening, which may well be fuelled by firmer oil prices after Saudi Arabia implied tolerance, or an acceptance of Brent climbing to around $80/brl. Note also, the recovery in Italian debt futures may also be taking some of the shine away from Bunds and mainstream peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is benefitting from source reports suggesting that Saudi Arabia is said to be comfortable with oil above USD 80/bbl, with the fossil fuel extending on gains seen in yesterdays trade, additionally WTI broke through its 100DMA to the upside. Russia&#39;s Novak also said the rise in oil to USD 70-80/bbl is temporary and sanction driven, and sees the long term price in the area of USD 50/bbl</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In metals markets, gold is seeing an unwinding of safe-haven premiums driven by trade concerns, with the precious metal down on the day. Industrial metals are also largely negative, with all of copper, tin, aluminium and zinc down by over 0.5% on the day, and copper in the red for the third straight session.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, reports noted that USTR Lighthizer removed about 300 product categories and reduced some subsets, but the total value is still approximately USD 200bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Vice Premier Liu He was said to convene a tariff response meeting, while there were separate reports which cited an unnamed Beijing source that China will likely not send a delegation to Washington for trade discussions following the US announcement of fresh tariffs. (South China Morning Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Commerce Minister said China has confidence and ability to reach this year&#39;s targets and will increase opening up to a higher level, while the minister added there is no winner in a trade war and that cooperation between US and China is the only correct option on trade. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China CSRC official said Trump&#39;s tactics to pressure China will not work and that China has ample fiscal and monetary policy tools to cope with trade frictions with US. The official added that trade actions by US could negatively impact itself but added that China still looks forward to good trade relations with US in the long term and hopes both sides could sit to negotiate on trade. Furthermore, the official stated the US move on trade has poisoned atmosphere for negotiations, although both sides can sit down to talk about reducing trade deficit and that China will push ahead with financial market opening. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian equity markets were mixed with focus centred on the escalation of trade tensions after the US confirmed tariffs on USD 200bln of Chinese imports effective September 24th which will begin at 10% and increase to 25% at year end, while US President Trump also warned that if China retaliates he will immediately pursue tariffs on another USD 267bln of Chinese goods. This pressured ASX 200 (-0.5%) with the index dragged by commodity-related sectors as well as tech stocks following similar underperformance in their US counterparts, while Nikkei 225 (+1.5%) showed resilience on return from its extended weekend amid reports that Japan is to offer measures to lower the trade surplus with US in an effort to avert auto tariffs. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.8%) declined and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) traded choppy as participants digested the tariff announcement and a substantial CNY 200bln liquidity effort by the PBoC, with participants also cautious as they await China&rsquo;s response as Vice Premier Liu He was said to convene a tariff response meeting. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued amid gains in Japanese stocks and after the BoJ Rinban announcement for JPY 690bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end also failed to spur demand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 150bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 50bln via 14-day reverse repos. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8554 (Prev. 6.8509)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior EU diplomats are said to predict the UK government will have to go through its darkest hour and stare into the abyss of a no-deal Brexit before it will give in to EU demands. (The Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU officials are reportedly insisting on guarantees that the UK cannot renegotiate any agreement on Brexit and is preparing to demand assurances any agreement cannot be unpicked by a future successor. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some EU members could put pressure on Ireland to drop its resistance to EU corporate tax reform in return for support on Brexit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May has suggested that EU migrants will not get preferential treatment, post-Brexit. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May said that there would be disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit but the UK must make a success of a no deal outcome. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary Raab expects the EU to make concessions, according to German press reports. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spain is seeking firmer legal guarantees on Gibraltar as part of the Brexit settlement, a decision which could pose further hurdles for the UK as they aim to leave the bloc. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy Deputy PM Di Maio has reportedly once again threatened to seek the removal of Finance Minister Tria. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were choppy as the early safe-haven flows into the greenback from the US tariff announcement gradually dissipated. The announcement initially spurred a flight into JPY and pressured CNH which in turn weighed on antipodeans due to their heavy China exposure and high beta characteristics, while CAD was also lacklustre following unwavering comments by Canadian PM Trudeau that Canada will stand up for its system of dairy protections in NAFTA talks and that it is the nation&rsquo;s job to stay strong on NAFTA positions. However, most the price moves in FX later reversed driven by a mild improvement in risk tone which was attributed to the tariffs being telegraphed well in advance and with no immediate tariff retaliation from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA minutes from September 4th meeting reiterated that board agreed no strong case for near-term rate move and that next move is likely to be upwards if economy proceeds as anticipated. The minutes added that the RBA is to be source of stability and confidence amid gradual progress to targets, while it also stated the recent mild decline in the currency has supported the economy but noted significant global trade frictions are a material risk to the outlook. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were lacklustre with demand sapped by the US trade offensive in which it confirmed fresh tariffs on China effective from next week. This kept WTI near the prior day&rsquo;s lows while there were also recent comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak regarding discussing an output increase with OPEC at the next meeting. Elsewhere, gold slipped back below USD 1200/oz on early safe-haven flows into the greenback, while copper was pressured on the tariff announcement but then recovered most of its losses as risk sentiment slightly improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia&#39;s Energy Minister Novak said he may discuss the possibility of increasing output by more than 1mln BPD at the upcoming OPEC meeting. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korean Leader Kim greeted South Korean President Moon at Pyongyang airport for the summit this week. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was much fanfare as 10-year yields once again crossed 3.00% to the upside as the Treasury complex was being sold pre-market (sympathy with bunds was also cited). However, as tech sold-off at the open, and a general fear of trade war escalation lingering in trader&rsquo;s minds, there was buying action pushing yields back beneath the psychological 3.00% handle. The story remains the same in the short-end with 2-year yields printing fresh decade+ highs. At settlement, however, yields were relatively unchanged on the day, and the curve had very, very modestly steepened. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 1+ ticks lower at 119-04.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Economic Adviser Kudlow said the US is ready to negotiate with China anytime if they are ready for serious and substantive talks. Kudlow also said US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is in touch and is negotiating with Chinese officials, while he forecasts more progress on trade with Canada, EU and Japan. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed with focus centred on the escalation of trade tensions after the US confirmed tariffs on USD 200bln of Chinese imports effective September 24th which will begin at 10% and increase to 25% at year end, while US President Trump also warned that if China retaliates he will immediately pursue tariffs on another USD 267bln of Chinese goods. This pressured ASX 200 (-0.4%) with the index dragged by commodity-related sectors as well as tech stocks following similar underperformance in their US counterparts, while Nikkei 225 (+01.1%) showed resilience on return from its extended weekend amid reports that Japan is to offer measures to lower the trade surplus with US in an effort to avert auto tariffs. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are mixed as participants digest the tariff announcement and a substantial CNY 200bln liquidity effort by the PBoC, with the region now awaiting China&rsquo;s response as Vice Premier Liu He was said to convene a tariff response meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are choppy with the DXY only nursing a small fraction of the prior day&rsquo;s declines as the early safe-haven flows into the greenback from the US tariff announcement gradually dissipated. The announcement also spurred a flight into JPY and pressured CNH which in turn weighed on antipodeans due to their heavy China exposure and high beta characteristics, while CAD was also lacklustre following unwavering comments by Canadian PM Trudeau that Canada will stand up for its system of dairy protections in NAFTA talks and that it is the nation&rsquo;s job to stay strong on NAFTA positions. However, most the price moves in FX were then pared driven by an improvement in risk tone which was attributed to the tariffs being telegraphed well in advance and with no immediate retaliation yet from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued amid gains in Japanese stocks and with focus on riskier assets, while the BoJ Rinban announcement for JPY 690bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end also failed to spur demand. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, RBA added that a pick up in wages is expected to be gradual and that the labour outlook remains positive, while it also commented that the economy seems to have grown above trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a guide, AUD/USD saw mild support following the policy announcement and statement despite the comments not providing anything particularly surprising as the tone of the statement was slightly upbeat and less dovish than some had expected, while participants will also be eyeing any potential clues on if the recent mortgage rate hikes from 3 of Australia&rsquo;s big 4 banks has impacted the central bank&rsquo;s view.</p>\r\n",
