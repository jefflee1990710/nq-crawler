(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US BUDGET: The White House sent Congress a request for a $4.4trln budget, which seemingly does away with the Republican principle of aiming to achieve a balanced budget within a 10-year horizon. The budget called for $1.7trln cuts in mandatory spending over 10-years, $200bln in infrastructure investment, as well as a budget for the Wall. The economic assumptions in the budget also received attention, which is more optimistic on growth in the short-term (than the FOMC&rsquo;s recent forecasts, as well as analyst consensus), is slightly lower than consensus, unemployment in line with the market and the FOMC. However, the assumptions assume a 10-year yield of 2.60% this year &ndash; benchmark 10s are currently yielding around 25bps more than the assumption. Congress will need to vote on the budget before it is adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES: SPX +1.4% at 2656, DJI +1.7% at 24600, NDX +1.7% at 6524.<br />Top sectors: Materials +2.1%, IT +1.7%, Energy +1.6%.<br />Bottom sectors: Telecoms +0.5%Utilities +0.7%, Healthcare +0.9%.<br /><br />After last week&rsquo;s slide, major stock indices continued the &lsquo;recovery&rsquo;, posting a second day of gains, in a further sign that last week&rsquo;s selloff was technical/sentiment/position adjustment-related. Gains were broad-based, led by Apple and Boeing, while Cisco and American Express were higher on broker upgrades. Sector wise, materials and industrials were higher after Trump announced the much-awaited infrastructure plan, which will see the Federal government invest $200bln (which it is hoped will be boosted to $1.5trln after public-private partnerships), and the defence spending boost. Energy was tracking the crude complex higher, while financials benefited from higher yields. The analyst community continued to talk up the buy-the-dip potential of the market, after bears failed to force a close beneath the 200d MA on Friday. The VIX, meanwhile, slipped to the 25-handle, having surged above 40 last week.

The Tplex took its cue from continued &lsquo;recovery&rsquo; in risk sentiment after last week, with 10s moving back to test 2.9% unsuccessfully, settling around 2.85%. Analysts were also citing concerns about the level of US deficits, and are mindful of inflation data, due Wednesday, for signs whether inflationary pressures are widespread, or fleeting/contained in certain areas. The US Treasury will also auction a new 30-year TIPS for $7bln, ahead of next week&rsquo;s new 2s, 5s and 7s. (RANsquawk)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irish PM Varadkar said the country would like a comprehensive free trade agreement with the UK following Brexit and notes talks are moving in the right direction. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&rsquo;s Vlieghe stated if there is less credit headwinds, it may signal the UK is ready for higher rates and that there is increased evidence that a tight labour market is having an upward effect on wages. Later on he stated the central bank is doing macro prudential tightening but it is also appropriate to raise rates. Vlieghe stressed that there is huge uncertainty over the rate path and said rates could go up faster or more slowly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&rsquo;s McCafferty said the UK economy is holding up relatively well and it is likely rates will have to rise earlier than we thought late last year and noted it is too early to say whether the BoE will hike in May.

Most of those losses for the DXY came as a result of EUR rising 0.4%, though the range was thin (1.2236 to 12296), as was newsflow; comments from ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny made over the weekend continued to get traction (another warning about US political influence in the USD, which he suggested may be discussed at the March G20 meeting). Even the havens traded higher against the Buck; the yen was strengthening on reports that BOJ governor Kuroda was set to be reappointed. XAU was up by $7 to reclaim the $1320 level. Sterling was more-or-less flat against the USD, and around 0.25% weaker against the EUR; BOE&rsquo;s Haldane suggested over the weekend that the BOE was in no rush to hike rates, while BOE&rsquo;s Vlighe noted uncertainty about the rate path and rates could go up faster or more slowly, and BOE&rsquo;s McCafferty said it was too early to say if the Bank would hike in May. Attention will be on the &ldquo;Road to Brexit&rdquo; speeches over the next three weeks, where senior UK officials (including PM May and Foreign Minister Johnson) will detail what the UK wants The ZAR was outperforming its EMFX copunterparts, trading around 1% higher against the dollar on anticipation that the ANC&rsquo;s NEC meeting would finally come to a resolve to oust President Zuma. There was mixed newsflow &ndash; at one point, local press reported that Zuma was on the cusp of resigning, which was subsequently denied by Presidential sources. Nevertheless, ZAR maintained most of the gains. (RANsquawk)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South African President Zuma is reported to want a 3-month &lsquo;notice period&rsquo; before resigning, although South Africa media cited sources in which it stated that President Zuma has been given 48 hours to resign.

Once again, crude was tracking overall risk sentiment for most of the session &ndash; specifically taking its cue from stock markets and the US dollar. Crude bulls were happy to ignore Friday&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count data, which showed oil drillers adding oil rigs for the third straight week; bulls also looked-through the OPEC monthly oil market report &ndash; where 2018 supply was raised by 250k BPD to 1.4m BPD, demand growth bumped up by 60k to 1.59m BPD, and the implied call on OPEC&rsquo;s crude trimmed by 240k BPD to 32.86m BPD. However, heading into settlement, the EIA reported that US shale regions production in March was expected to rise by 111k BPD taking it to 6.757mln BPD (Feb. saw a 109k BPD increase). In pre-settlement trade, both WTI and Brent gave back the bulk of gains.

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: Stocks continue ‘recovery’, DXY lower, rates mostly higher, oil slides after EIA forecasts",
        "content": "<p><strong>RECAP - US BUDET: </strong>The White House sent Congress a request for a $4.4trln budget, which seemingly does away with the Republican principle of aiming to achieve a balanced budget within a 10-year horizon. The budget called for $1.7trln cuts in mandatory spending over 10-years, $200bln in infrastructure investment, as well as a budget for the Wall. The economic assumptions in the budget also received attention, which is more optimistic on growth in the short-term (than the FOMC&rsquo;s recent forecasts, as well as analyst consensus), is slightly lower than consensus, unemployment in line with the market and the FOMC. However, the assumptions assume a 10-year yield of 2.60% this year &ndash; benchmark 10s are currently yielding around 25bps more than the assumption. Congress will need to vote on the budget before it is adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +1.4% at 2656, DJI +1.7% at 24600, NDX +1.7% at 6524</strong><br />Top sectors: Materials +2.1%, IT +1.7%, Energy +1.6%<br />Bottom sectors: Telecoms +0.5%Utilities +0.7%, Healthcare +0.9%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After last week&rsquo;s slide, major stock indices continued the &lsquo;recovery&rsquo;, posting a second day of gains, in a further sign that last week&rsquo;s selloff was technical/sentiment/position adjustment-related. Gains were broad-based, led by Apple and Boeing, while Cisco and American Express were higher on broker upgrades. Sector wise, materials and industrials were higher after Trump announced the much-awaited infrastructure plan, which will see the Federal government invest $200bln (which it is hoped will be boosted to $1.5trln after public-private partnerships), and the defence spending boost. Energy was tracking the crude complex higher, while financials benefited from higher yields. The analyst community continued to talk up the buy-the-dip potential of the market, after bears failed to force a close beneath the 200d MA on Friday. The VIX, meanwhile, slipped to the 25-handle, having surged above 40 last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Notes settle 9 ticks lower at 120-25+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields were slightly higher across the curve on Monday, with most of the action concentrated in the belly of the curve. The Tplex took its cue from continued &lsquo;recovery&rsquo; in risk sentiment after last week, with 10s moving back to test 2.9% unsuccessfully, settling around 2.85%. Analysts were also citing concerns about the level of US deficits, and are mindful of inflation data, due Wednesday, for signs whether inflationary pressures are widespread, or fleeting/contained in certain areas. The US Treasury will also auction a new 30-year TIPS for $7bln, ahead of next week&rsquo;s new&nbsp; 2s, 5s and 7s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY down 0.25% heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some analysts have noted that DXY trades like a funding currency these days, inversing moving with market sentiment. Most of those losses for the DXY came as a result of EUR rising 0.4%, though the range was thin (1.2236 to 12296), as was newsflow; comments from ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny made over the weekend continued to get traction (another warning about US political influence in the USD, which he suggested may be discussed at the March G20 meeting).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the havens traded higher against the Buck; the yen was strengthening on reports that BOJ governor Kuroda was set to be reappointed. XAU was up by $7 to reclaim the $1320 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling was more-or-less flat against the USD, and around 0.25% weaker against the EUR; BOE&rsquo;s Haldane suggested over the weekend that the BOE was in no rush to hike rates, while BOE&rsquo;s Vlighe noted uncertainty about the rate path and rates could go up faster or more slowly, and BOE&rsquo;s McCafferty said it was too early to say if the Bank would hike in May. Attention will be on the &ldquo;Road to Brexit&rdquo; speeches over the next three weeks, where senior UK officials (including PM May and Foreign Minister Johnson) will detail what the UK wants</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ZAR was outperforming its EMFX copunterparts, trading around 1% higher against the dollar on anticipation that the ANC&rsquo;s NEC meeting would finally come to a resolve to oust President Zuma. There was mixed newsflow &ndash; at one point, local press reported that Zuma was on the cusp of resigning, which was subsequently denied by Presidential sources. Nevertheless, ZAR maintained most of the gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settled 9 cents higher at $59.29 per barrel; Brent futures settled 20 cents lower at $62.59 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, crude was tracking overall risk sentiment for most of the session &ndash; specifically taking its cue from stock markets and the US dollar. Crude bulls were happy to ignore Friday&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count data, which showed oil drillers adding oil rigs for the third straight week; bulls also looked-through the OPEC monthly oil market report &ndash; where 2018 supply was raised by 250k BPD to 1.4m BPD, demand growth bumped up by 60k to 1.59m BPD, and the implied call on OPEC&rsquo;s crude trimmed by 240k BPD to 32.86m BPD. However, heading into settlement, the EIA reported that US shale regions production in March was expected to rise by 111k BPD taking it to 6.757mln BPD (Feb. saw a 109k BPD increase). In pre-settlement trade, both WTI and Brent gave back the bulk of gains.</p>\r\n",

Usd/Jpy and Usd/Chf remained relatively rangebound between 108.50-95 and 0.9400-0.9365 despite broadly risk back on sentiment, which helped the Aud more than its Nzd peer as the cross recovered the 1.0800 handle (former rebounding towards 0.7850 vs the Usd, latter stalling around the middle of its 0.7230-75 band). Much more excitement and action in the EM area where Usd/Zar initially dropped to around 11.8825 on reports that Zuma had finally agreed to step down, but the Rand essentially reversing course when a Presidential spokesman refuted the resignation talk.

        "content": "<p>US President Trump will make his 2019 budget request to Congress on Monday. Attention will be on details around infrastructure spending, as well as the trajectory of the US budget deficit. There is no set time for the release of the budget details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DEFICITS:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- It has been widely suggested that the Republican budget will abandon a long-established principle to maintain a balanced budget over a 10-year horizon (WaPo) &ndash; a notion given credence after last week&rsquo;s bipartisan spending plan. The US Congressional Budget Office estimated that the spending plan would add more than USD 1 trillion to federal budget deficits over 10-years, even after they factor in the assumed economic growth that would be stimulated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- However, OMB Director Mulvaney over the weekend intimated that the 2019 budget would propose a USD 3trln cut to deficits over 10-years, but provided few details. Mulvaney also suggested that all of the funding requested in the budget would not necessarily have to be spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Traders will, therefore, keep an eye out for details, as well as independent scoring of the budget that will follow in the days ahead. Some have suggested that part of the fixed-income sell-off last week was attributed to the anticipated widening deficits, as well as increased supply out of the US Treasury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>INFRASTRUCTURE:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- As has been widely suggested since Trump&rsquo;s State of The Union address, the US govt is expected to inject USD 200bln in spending in order to spur a total of USD 1.5trln in investments from state, local and private partners (Reuters).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Analysts have suggested keeping an eye on the following equity names: Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Aecom (ACM), Jacobs Engineering Group (JEC), Granite Construction (GVA), Eagle Materials (EXP), U.S. Concrete (USCR), Caterpillar (CAT).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- In more politically-focussed factors, reports suggest that the budget will request USD 23bln for enhanced border security (read: the wall), helping Trump to fulfil a key campaign pledge.</p>\r\n",

However, upside was contained with Japan away in observance of National Founding Day, while the <strong>ASX 200 (-0.3%)</strong> was the laggard as energy names reeled from last week&rsquo;s drop in crude prices and with financials subdued as the Royal Banking Commission started its inquiry into the industry. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.2%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) </strong>were positive ahead of this week&rsquo;s Lunar New Year celebrations, while most of the Asia peripheries traded with cautious gains amid a lack of drivers and with various holiday closures scheduled through to next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations.

(ChronicleLive)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Vlieghe states that if there are less credit headwinds, this may signal that the UK is ready for higher rates, there is increased evidence that a tight labour market is having upward effects on wages, also stating that rise in UK debt burden not sustainable if continues for many years. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny said that the ECB is concerned regarding US attempts to politically influence FX rates. Nowotny also added that said that EU inflation still has room to increase so the ECB is still on the careful side, although that certainly won&rsquo;t last forever and that there will be a need for higher interest rates in the foreseeable future. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Visco said ECB will be patient on pursuit of its inflation goal and that it has been challenging to push up inflation expectations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of Management and Budget Director Mulvaney said the is budget is to seek USD 3.0tln deficit reduction over 10 years and that interest rates may spike as a result of the increasing deficit, while he added that he would probably not have voted for the Trump budget deal. Furthermore, there were also source reports that Trump&rsquo;s budget is said to not balance in 10 years. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US White House stated that 2019 budget plan will project 3% growth. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond has been sidelined from a series of major &quot;road to Brexit&quot; interventions by Cabinet ministers over the next fortnight as Theresa May seeks to agree a cross-Cabinet vision for Brexit. Theresa May and Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox - the three leading Cabinet Brexiteers - will all give key note speeches on the UK&#39;s EU withdrawal stance over the next three weeks, but the Chancellor will not take part.

Gilts continue to display relative resilience, but also extended the Liffe intraday low at 120.79 (-33 ticks) before finding a base, although may succumb to more selling pressure amidst comments from BoE&rsquo;s Vlieghe underlining conditions that have changed to warrant higher rates. Meanwhile, USTs are hovering just above overnight session lows in futures and just under peaks on the cash yield front, awaiting the return of US traders for potentially the next legs down and higher respectively.</p>\r\n",

Usd/Jpy even more contained within a 108.50-108.95 band, as are Usd/Chf and Usd/Cad in 0.9370-0.9400 and 1.2600-1.2555 ranges awaiting more direction &ndash; via stock market developments and US CPI data for example. The Dollar index is keeping its head above the 90.000 level with the latest weekly CFTC reports on spec positioning showing a slightly less short Greenback base, along with the Jpy, while Eur and Gbp longs lighten up a bit and Loonie longs increase their Cad holdings.

In early trade, sour sentiment and concerns about the valuation of equities extended, lining stocks up for another grim end to the week. However, in afternoon trade, the DJIA and SPX fell to test their 200d MA, which neither could meaningfully break beneath. The result was an immediate improvement in sentiment and buyers emerged, pushing stocks up to erase losses for the day. The run-in to the close was choppy, however, and gains appeared fragile. The weekly stats, however, still look grim, with the SPX off by over 5% in the week, straddling the 2600 handle as we close out trade. However, Friday&rsquo;s gains have taken at least some of the sting out of the gains, and technical analysts were encouraged by the fact that the 200d MA held its ground when tested. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

However, gains are reserved with Japan away in observance of National Founding Day, while the ASX 200 (-0.3%) is the laggard as energy names reel from last week&rsquo;s USD 5 drop in crude prices and with financials subdued as the Royal Banking Commission begins its probe in the industry. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) are positive ahead of this week&rsquo;s Lunar New Year celebrations, while most of the Asia peripheries trade with cautious gains amid a lack of drivers and with various holiday closures scheduled through to next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets saw a quiet start to the week with most majors uneventful amid a sparse overnight calendar and light weekend newsflow, while the absence of Japanese participants and upcoming slew of market closures also ensured range-bound trade. Nonetheless, the USD is weaker with EUR/USD the main beneficiary as it tries to recover from last week&rsquo;s losses, while USD/CNH briefly wobbled and tested 6.3000 to the downside after the PBoC set a firmer reference rate.</p>\r\n",
