(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts said that the minutes were consistent with an upcoming hike in December, though by talking-up data-dependence as well as no pre-set policy course, the central bank might be giving itself optionality to narrow the rate trajectory in 2019 (the Fed will update economic projections at the December meeting) The market reaction was muted, with the implied probability of a December rate hike moderating ever so slightly (79% vs 83% before the release of the minutes); Fed funds futures continued to price just under two hikes by the end of 2019 (implied rate 2.70% - little changed from the aftermath of Powell&rsquo;s Tuesday comments), short of the FOMC&rsquo;s September projections which expect rates to be between 3.00-3.25% at the end of next year.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump states that he is close to doing something on trade with China but is unsure if he wants to, while he added that he will bring up the issue of Americans held in China with Chinese President Xi.

Qualcomm (QCOM) opened higher on the back of comments it is still considering going private. Nielsen (NLSN) traded higher following bidding interest from buyout firm Madison Dearborn. Boeing (BA) led the Dow, assisted by a Best Idea for 2019 rating at Cowen and pro-China trade sentiment. Altria Group (MO) drifted higher after news of it acquiring a stake in Juul Labs. McDonald&rsquo;s (MCD) benefitted from an upgrade at Morgan Stanley. Quest Diagnostics (DGX) nosedived after it cut its FY revenue guidance. Twitter (TWTR) tanked in the wake of a boycott by Fox News (FOXA) and negative comments from Baird. As yields dropped, we saw drops in several bank stocks including Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C). China exposed stocks also underperformed - ahead of the G20 summit - including Ctrip.com (CTRP), Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD). SPX -0.22% at 2728, NDX -0.30% at 6892, DJI -0.11% at 25339.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The treasury complex traded within a thin range and ended Thursday&rsquo;s session mostly flat. The release of the FOMC minutes did little to the complex with yields back around levels seen pre-Powell dovish comments on Wednesday. Most MPC members agreed that rate hikes are likely warranted &ldquo;fairly soon&rdquo; subject to inflation and US jobs. Most of the action was in the belly of the curve where yields were lower by c.1bps at settlement; mixed data also contributed to depressed yields.&nbsp; 2s10s narrowed by c.3bps while 2s30s and 2s5s were narrower by c.2bps. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 1 tick higher at 119-13+.</p>\r\n",

Many expressed it may be appropriate for the FOMC to emphasise a more data-dependent approach in upcoming meetings, while the language around &lsquo;further gradual hikes&rsquo; may need to be examined. On the neutral rate, a couple of members argued that rates could be near neutral, and further rate hikes risk unduly slowing the economy. Finally, the FOMC signalled that it was not on a pre-set policy course. Analysts said that the minutes were consistent with an upcoming hike in December, though by talking-up data-dependence as well as no pre-set policy course, the central bank might be giving itself optionality to narrow the rate trajectory in 2019 (the Fed will update economic projections at the December meeting) The market reaction was muted, with the implied probability of a December rate hike moderating ever so slightly (79% vs 83% before the release of the minutes); Fed funds futures continued to price just under two hikes by the end of 2019 (implied rate 2.70% - little changed from the aftermath of Powell&rsquo;s Tuesday comments), short of the FOMC&rsquo;s September projections which expect rates to be between 3.00-3.25% at the end of next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Reports in the WSJ suggested that the US and China are exploring a trade deal aimed at de-escalating trade tensions; under the agreement the US would suspend further tariffs through the spring in exchange for new talks and big changes in China&rsquo;s economic policy. This came after Trump announced he is close to doing something with trade and China but is unsure if he wants to, adding that he will bring up the issue of Americans held in China with Chinese President Xi. Separately, Trump warned companies that if they don&#39;t want to pay tariffs, they must build in the US. Elsewhere, WiWo reported that EU Commissioner Oettinger expects US auto tariffs before Christmas although the EC later denied the comments stating that they are concerned US tariffs could come and that could be soon. With regards to the USMCA, Canada&#39;s Foreign Minister Freeland said that parties are ready to sign the trilateral agreement on Friday though noting that some details are yet to be finalised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* G20:</strong> US Trade Advisor and known &lsquo;China hawk&rsquo; Navarro is back on the guest list for the dinner between US President Trump and Chinese President Xi after being reportedly excluded from the event last week. Additionally, Trump announced he is cancelling his meeting with Russia&#39;s Putin over the Ukraine crisis while Canada&rsquo;s Freeland said it is not clear if Canada&#39;s PM Trudeau will meet Saudi Crown Prince at the summit as they are still finalising agenda for the bilateral meeting. Also, a German official said that the are no plans to forge alliances on trade against China or any other country at the G20 while noting that Chancellor Merkel expects to hold bilateral meetings Trump, Russia&#39;s Putin, Chinese President Xi and India&#39;s PM Modi among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Following yesterday&rsquo;s announcement that the EC are to begin disciplinary action on Italy regarding its debt before Christmas, reports in La Repubblica suggested the EU could give Italy more time before triggering the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) while an EU source announced that the EU governments endorse the next step in the EDP. Italy remains optimistic that a deal can be struck with the EC; Italian PM Conte sees a cut to deficit target to 2.2% while Deputy PM Salvini denied that the deficit will be cut to this figure. In comments, ECB&#39;s De Guindos noted that Italian growth is underperforming the EZ, while he is confident the EC will come to an agreement with Italy. The Italian government could seek a parliamentary vote on the budget on either Dec 3rd or 4th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Villeroy (Dovish) said that the global economic crisis risks have become very dangerous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US PCE:</strong> Personal income rose to 0.5% from 0.2% in October, a tad above the 0.4% consensus. Consumer spending also beat expectations and posted at 0.6%, though this figure was subject to downward revisions. Wells Fargo argues that the gains in personal income indicate that a &ldquo;tight labour market is finally translating into meaningful income gains&rdquo;. Overall the report suggests that confidence among consumers remains strong heading into this year&rsquo;s holiday shopping season. Wells Fargo therefore forecasts consumer spending growth of around 3.0% in the Q4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.22% at 2728, NDX -0.30% at 6892, DJI -0.11% at 25339. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.59%, Materials +0.55%, Industrials -0.02%, Cons Discretionary -0.43%, Cons Staples +0.05%, Healthcare +0.31%, Financials -0.82%, Tech -0.95%, Telecoms +0.36%, Utilities -0.14%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Dollar Tree (DLTR), despite a softer sales outlook, outperformed after it said it had mitigated costs for any incoming tariffs. Qualcomm (QCOM) opened higher on the back of comments it is still considering going private. Nielsen (NLSN) traded higher following bidding interest from buyout firm Madison Dearborn. Boeing (BA) led the Dow, assisted by a Best Idea for 2019 rating at Cowen and pro-China trade sentiment. Altria Group (MO) drifted higher after news of it acquiring a stake in Juul Labs. McDonald&rsquo;s (MCD) benefitted from an upgrade at Morgan Stanley. Quest Diagnostics (DGX) nosedived after it cut its FY revenue guidance. Twitter (TWTR) tanked in the wake of a boycott by Fox News (FOXA) and negative comments from Baird. As yields dropped, we saw drops in several bank stocks including Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C). China exposed stocks also underperformed - ahead of the G20 summit - including Ctrip.com (CTRP), Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 1.16 HIGHER AT USD 51.45/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 0.75 HIGHER AT USD 59.51/BBL.</strong> Crude bounced back from early losses (where WTI slipped beneath the USD 50 mark), rising on reports that Russia may be prepared to trim oil output in cooperation with OPEC. Russian oil companies reportedly said that they would gradually reduce production levels, but not immediately from January. &ldquo;The market will likely remain quietly sensitive to headlines on this topic, as Russian and Saudi officials join other G20 leaders in Buenos Aires, with sidebar discussions likely to include a framework for reducing output,&quot; Citi said. &quot;With many market participants already anticipating a 1mln BPD cut, Citi thinks it may take an even larger reduction to shock the market into a short-covering rally, otherwise, prices may be at risk for a further decline on a determination that the reduction might be helpful, but still not enough to draw down surplus stocks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 1 TICKS HIGHER AT 119-13+. </strong>The treasury complex traded within a thin range and ended Thursday&rsquo;s session mostly flat. The release of the FOMC minutes did little to the complex with yields back around levels seen pre-Powell dovish comments on Wednesday. Most MPC members agreed that rate hikes are likely warranted &ldquo;fairly soon&rdquo; subject to inflation and US jobs. Most of the action was in the belly of the curve where yields were lower by c.1bps at settlement; mixed data also contributed to depressed yields. &nbsp;2s10s narrowed by c.3bps while 2s30s and 2s5s were narrower by c.2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Greenback appears to have found its feet, or regained a foothold after its relatively sharp fall from grace in wake of latest comments from the Fed chair about policy rates being near neutral vs a long way below in October and a balance FOMC Minutes meeting on Thursday which left the probability of a December rate hike ever so slightly lower. In fact, the Dollar is now ahead vs certain G10 counterparts even though Treasury yields remain depressed after mixed data, and perhaps of note benign core PCE prices (y/y), weaker than forecast weekly claims ahead of next Friday&rsquo;s NFP release and pending home sales. Hence, the index has pared some losses within a 96.622-97.010 range and a key downside technical level around 96.612.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, AUD: </strong>The Jpy extended gains vs the Usd, but more on the relative UST-JGB angle than safe-haven grounds, with the headline pair down to 113.20 and almost triggering stops just below, while the Aud also rebounded further vs its US peer to just shy of 0.7350, even though Aussie Private Capex defied expectations for a decent rebound in Q3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Also firmer against the Buck, but unable to retain the 1.1400 mark due to heavy offers at the big figure, persistent Italian fiscal concerns and more soft Eurozone data that weighed heavier on market perceptions for ECB rates (2019 hike probability now down to 70%). Note also, mega expiry options from 1.1365-60 to 1.1350-40 in 1.35 bn and 3.2 bn respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, CHF, SEK: </strong>All ending Thursday&rsquo;s session on the back foot, with Cable back below 1.2800, and Sterling also underperforming vs the Eur on ongoing Brexit uncertainty ahead of December&rsquo;s UK Parliament vote and month end factors in the case of the cross (usual RHS interest nudging Eur/Gbp up through 0.8900). Meanwhile, the Franc and Swedish crown were both rattled by unexpected negative GDP outturns in Q3, albeit the latter belatedly weakening vs the Usd and Eur vs the Sek&rsquo;s rapid decline. Note, Usd/Chf has reached 0.9975, Eur/Usd is back over 1.1400 and Eur/Sek has rebounded to 10.3000+ and close to 10.3300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie has derived some support from a smaller than forecast Canadian Q3 current account shortfall and a rebound in oil but could not quite clear the 1.3250 level as the country adopted sanctions vs Saudi Arabia over the Kashoggi murder and may face more reciprocal action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Amidst a near blanket sea of green, the Lira racked up more impressive gains vs the Dollar on the wave of recent steep declines in crude, increasingly positive chart dynamics and an encouraging rise in Turkish economic sentiment. Usd/Try having another look at major tech support circa 5.1550.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback appears to have found its feet, or regained a foothold after its relatively sharp fall from grace in wake of latest comments from the Fed chair about policy rates being near neutral vs a long way below in October. In fact, the Dollar is now ahead vs certain G10 counterparts even though Treasury yields remain depressed after mixed data, and perhaps of note benign core PCE prices (y/y), weaker than forecast weekly claims ahead of next Friday&rsquo;s NFP release and pending home sales. Hence, the index has pared some losses within a 96.622-97.010 range and a key downside technical level around 96.612, with the focus returning to the FOMC for minutes from the November meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jpy extended gains vs the Usd, but more on the relative UST-JGB angle than safe-haven grounds, with the headline pair down to 113.20 and almost triggering stops just below, while the Aud also rebounded further vs its US peer to just shy of 0.7350, even though Aussie Private Capex defied expectations for a decent rebound in Q3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also firmer against the Buck, but unable to retain the 1.1400 mark due to heavy offers at the big figure, persistent Italian fiscal concerns and more soft Eurozone data that weighed heavier on market perceptions for ECB rates (2019 hike probability now down to 70%). Note also, mega expiry options from 1.1365-60 to 1.1350-40 in 1.35 bn and 3.2 bn respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All ending Thursday&rsquo;s session on the back foot, with Cable back below 1.2800, and Sterling also underperforming vs the Eur on ongoing Brexit uncertainty ahead of December&rsquo;s UK Parliament vote and month end factors in the case of the cross (usual RHS interest nudging Eur/Gbp up through 0.8900). Meanwhile, the Franc and Swedish crown were both rattled by unexpected negative GDP outturns in Q3, albeit the latter belatedly weakening vs the Usd and Eur vs the Sek&rsquo;s rapid decline. Note, Usd/Chf has reached 0.9975, Eur/Usd is back over 1.1400 and Eur/Sek has rebounded to 10.3000+ and close to 10.3300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has derived some support from a smaller than forecast Canadian Q3 current account shortfall and a rebound in oil, but could not quite clear the 1.3250 level as the country adopted sanctions vs Saudi Arabia over the Kashoggi murder and may face more reciprocal action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amidst a near blanket sea of green, the Lira racked up more impressive gains vs the Dollar on the wave of recent steep declines in crude, increasingly positive chart dynamics and an encouraging rise in Turkish economic sentiment. Usd/Try having another look at major tech support circa 5.1550.</p>\r\n",

This pushed EUR/USD to fresh session lows of 1.1350 and bringing into play options around 1.1340-50 (3.2bln) and 1.1360-65 (1.35bln). Note, the EUR did not really react to mixed German state CPIs but did respect a key fib just ahead of 1.1400 (1.1394). Looking ahead German national CPIs are due at 13.00GMT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK,CHF &ndash; Carbon copy for the Swedish Crown and Swiss Franc with both currencies undermined in the wake of surprise contractions in Q3 GDP of the same magnitude QQ. EUR/SEK flirts around the key technical level 10.3000 having briefly breached it to the upside. Nordea notes that domestic demand is weakening due to the set-back in the housing market while foreign demand is remains sluggish, but Nordea and SEB maintain their forecast for a Riksbank December hike, though the former stated that weak growth underlines that this is not set in stone. Meanwhile CHF rose to highs of 0.9962 vs. the buck (vs. a pre-GDP print of 0.9925).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD &ndash; In contrast the AUD has showed some resilience despite lower than expected capital expenditures with the antipodean staying afloat above 0.7300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; The major beneficiary of the post-Powell Dollar weakness as USD/JPY fell through 114.00, 113.50 and currently rests around 113.40. In terms of technicals, the next level to the downside is at 113.17 (tenkan line), looking ahead, Tokyo CPIs are due to be released later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY &ndash; The clear EM outperformer with the currency breaching 5.1500 (and temporarily rallying through a key fib at 5.1562) vs. the buck as the move was exacerbated by the drop below 5.2000 in the wake of a significan improvement in Turkish economic confidence index and falling oil prices (as Turkey is a large net importer).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.3%) and WTI (-1.0%) have moved lower recently, which may have been exacerbated by reports that 7k WTI contracts were dropped at the same time. Overnight oil prices had moved higher, despite a greater than expected build shown in EIA weekly crude stocks of 3.577mln vs. Exp. 0.769mln, with prices boosted by a stronger dollar in addition markets are looking optimistically to this weeks G20 meeting to improve global demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has rebounded from two-week lows, as the dollar fell following comments from Fed Chairman Powell saying that the policy rate is just below the estimated neutral range. China&rsquo;s steel prices have dropped following a two day gain largely due to ample supply and lean demand in markets, with iron ore now rising following Monday&rsquo;s sell off. Additionally, spot Palladium has hit a record high of USD 1186.30/oz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Core bonds are still trading in the green after dovish comments from Chairman Powell in yesterday&rsquo;s New York address. Bunds have pushed just in to a key technical chart area of 161.33-37 ahead of German national CPI figures post-mixed state figures, which if broken may have the German 10-year hit 161.50 and see yields to fall to 0.3%. Gilts are currently hanging around the 122.80 area (+41 ticks on the March 19 contact, which is now&nbsp;the front-month) vs. 122.92 at best on the open, with the UK benchmark deriving little direction from mixed UK data, where mortgage data was inspiring, but inflation expectations fell short of the previous. Market participants are pointing out the contract high of 123.22 as the next key level should the 123.00 level be broken. BTP&rsquo;s are currently at session highs above 123.20 after a decent BTP and CCTEU auction Italian despite Deputy PM Salvini refuting a potential 2.2% deficit/GDP target for 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasuries are trading with gains of 2/3rd of a point as a dovish Powell has pushed the US benchmark towards a 3.0% yield, with participants looking forward to further comments from the Fed Chair later in the day alongside some key data points and FOMC minutes.</p>\r\n",

Sectors are mixed with IT names the outperformer following gains seen yesterday during US hours which has prompted upside in chip-makers such as Wirecard (+2.5%), STMicrolectronics (+1.9%) and Infineon (+1.6%). Material names are also seeing support this morning, in-fitting with price action in the metals scope with gains seen in Antofagasta (+4.4%), Glencore (+2.0%), Rio Tinto (+1.1%); upside in mining names and a softer GBP has pushed the FTSE 100 (+0.8%) towards the top of the leaderboard. To the downside, energy names lag their peers with WTI and Brent crude unable to halt recent declines. In terms of stock specifics, once again, Deutsche Bank (-3.3%) have found themselves in the centre of further controversy with their offices raided earlier this morning in a money laundering probe involving two members of staff. Elsewhere, Intu Properties&rsquo; (-35%) shares have slumped to a record low this morning after reports that a consortium led by their Deputy Chairman has abandoned their plans to buy the Co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; In the wake of Powell&rsquo;s &ldquo;dovish&rdquo; comments that Fed Funds are&nbsp; &ldquo;just below&rdquo; estimates of the neutral rate (vs. &ldquo;a long way&rdquo; in October), hinting at a potential slowdown in the hiking cycle, the DXY gave up the 97.000 level and witnessed its steepest one-day percentage decline this month so far, to 96.622 at one stage. However, the USD has pared some losses with month-end&nbsp; and SOMA demand still in play, while some rival currencies also suffer further weakness. Looking ahead, FOMC Minutes are due to be published later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP,EUR &ndash; Major G10 underperformer with ongoing Brexit bickering and meaningful vote concerns driving Cable below 1.2800 with a low print of 1.2759 (vs. highs of 1.2850, with offers seen between 1.2855-65) , while Sterling also fell victim to cross positioning for month end as EUR/GBP climbed above the key psychological 0.8900 level, before the single currency came under renewed pressure on latest auto tariff headlines as&nbsp; press reported that EU Commissioner Oettinger expects US auto tariffs before Christmas. This pushed EUR/USD to fresh session lows of 1.1350 and bringing into play options around 1.1340-50 (3.2bln) and 1.1360-65 (1.35bln). Note, the EUR did not really react to mixed German state CPIs but did respect a key fib just ahead of 1.1400 (1.1394). Looking ahead German national CPIs are due at 13.00GMT.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK,CHF &ndash; Carbon copy for the Swedish Crown and Swiss Franc with both currencies undermined in the wake of surprise contractions in Q3 GDP of the same magnitude QQ. EUR/SEK flirts around the key technical level 10.3000 having briefly breached it to the upside. Nordea notes that domestic demand is weakening due to the set-back in the housing market while foreign demand is remains sluggish, but Nordea and SEB maintain their forecast for a Riksbank December hike, though the former stated that weak growth underlines that this is not set in stone. Meanwhile CHF rose to highs of 0.9962 vs. the buck (vs. a pre-GDP print of 0.9925).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD &ndash; In contrast the AUD has showed some resilience despite lower than expected capital expenditures with the antipodean staying afloat above 0.7300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; The major beneficiary of the post-Powell Dollar weakness as USD/JPY fell through 114.00, 113.50 and currently rests around 113.40. In terms of technicals, the next level to the downside is at 113.17 (tenkan line), looking ahead, Tokyo CPIs are due to be released later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY &ndash; The clear EM outperformer with the currency breaching 5.1500 (and temporarily rallying through a key fib at 5.1562) vs. the buck as the move was exacerbated by the drop below 5.2000 in the wake of a significan improvement in Turkish economic confidence index and falling oil prices (as Turkey is a large net importer).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED</strong> <strong>INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Core bonds are still trading in the green after dovish comments from Chairman Powell in yesterday&rsquo;s New York address. Bunds have pushed just in to a key technical chart area of 161.33-37 ahead of German national CPI figures post-mixed state figures, which if broken may have the German 10-year hit 161.50 and see yields to fall to 0.3%. Gilts are currently hanging around the 122.80 area (+41 ticks on the March 19 contact, which is not the front-month) vs. 122.92 at best on the open, with the UK benchmark deriving little direction from mixed UK data, where mortgage data was inspiring, but inflation expectations fell short of the previous. Market participants are pointing out the contract high of 123.22 as the next key level should the 123.00 level be broken. BTP&rsquo;s are currently at session highs above 123.20 after a decent BTP and CCTEU auction Italian despite Deputy PM Salvini refuting a potential 2.2% deficit/GDP target for 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasuries are trading with gains of 2/3rd of a point as a dovish Powell has pushed the US benchmark towards a 3.0% yield, with participants looking forward to further comments from the Fed Chair later in the day alongside some key data points and FOMC minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-1.3%) and WTI (-1.0%) have moved lower recently, which may have been exacerbated by reports that 7k WTI contracts were dropped at the same time. Overnight oil prices had moved higher, despite a greater than expected build shown in EIA weekly crude stocks of 3.577mln vs. Exp. 0.769mln, with prices boosted by a stronger dollar in addition markets are looking optimistically to this weeks G20 meeting to improve global demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has rebounded from two-week lows, as the dollar fell following comments from Fed Chairman Powell saying that the policy rate is just below the estimated neutral range. China&rsquo;s steel prices have dropped following a two day gain largely due to ample supply and lean demand in markets, with iron ore now rising following Monday&rsquo;s sell off. Additionally, spot Palladium has hit a record high of USD 1186.30/oz.</p>\r\n",

Bunds have pushed just in to a key technical chart area of 161.33-37 ahead of German national CPI figures post-mixed state figures, which if broken may have the German 10-year hit 161.50 and see yields to fall to 0.3%. Gilts are currently hanging around the 122.80 area (+41 ticks on the March 19 contact, which is now&nbsp;the front-month) vs. 122.92 at best on the open, with the UK benchmark deriving little direction from mixed UK data, where mortgage data was inspiring, but inflation expectations fell short of the previous. Market participants are pointing out the contract high of 123.22 as the next key level should the 123.00 level be broken. BTP&rsquo;s are currently at session highs above 123.20 after a decent BTP and CCTEU auction Italian despite Deputy PM Salvini refuting a potential 2.2% deficit/GDP target for 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasuries are trading with gains of 2/3rd of a point as a dovish Powell has pushed the US benchmark towards a 3.0% yield, with participants looking forward to further comments from the Fed Chair later in the day alongside some key data points and FOMC minutes.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Close, but not quite in terms of early momentum and the 10 year German debt future building on initial Eurex gains and rallying further to a 161.20 high (+1/4 point) vs Wednesday&rsquo;s 161.18 intraday peak and Tuesday&rsquo;s 161.21 session best that continues to protect strong chart resistance up at 161.33 (contract pinnacle and close to a major Fib level). The rationale for the rebound in core bonds is largely Fed based as chair Powell scaled back rate hike guidance with his latest assessment that rates are now close to neutral. Moreover, early Eurozone inflation data for October indicates a marked slowdown that will register with the ECB alongside the recent downturn in economic growth. On that note, President Draghi is among a host of GC members slated to speak today.</p>\r\n",

This benefitted the USD&rsquo;s major counterparts across the board in which EUR/USD and GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.1300 and 1.2800 handles respectively, while EM currencies were lifted in tandem and the PBoC strengthened their fix accordingly. Elsewhere, antipodeans also gained at the expense of the greenback and due to their high-beta status, although AUD/USD and NZD/USD have since pulled back from their highs with AUD indecisive following mixed Capex data and after further discouraging Business Confidence from New Zealand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Private Capital Expenditure (Q3) Q/Q -0.5% vs. Exp. 1.1% (Prev. -2.5%).

Elsewhere, gold is firmer with prices underpinned by a softer greenback following Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s dovish-perceived rhetoric, which also lifted copper although the red metal has pared back gains overnight as the risk tone in China deteriorated on tariff concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Pompeo said he is very hopeful for a new meeting with North Korean officials to discuss denuclearization, while there were separate reports that US requested that North Korea change its chief negotiator.

(Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Yields were lower across the curve, with the exception of the 30-year, where yields rose slightly; today&rsquo;s action was sponsored by apparently dovish remarks from Fed chair Powell. With that said, analysts are increasingly pointing out that the range in Treasury futures is extremely narrow. Even after Powell&rsquo;s comments, the probability of a December rate hike was still around 80%, while the pricing through 2019 was only modestly narrowed (fed funds for Jan 2020 are implying an end-2019 FFR rate of 2.71% vs 2.75% pre-Powell). After the Powell speech, the US Treasury sold USD 32bln of 7-year notes at a high yield of 2.974%, stopping through the screens by 0.6bps. Demand for the auction was decent with the bid-to-cover 2.55x, slightly above the 6-auction average. Direct bidders took a significant portion compared to recent trend (as has been seen in the 2s and 5s auctions this week), pushing indirects and dealer participation below recent averages. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 4+ ticks higher at 119-12+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks traded mostly positive after risk appetite was ignited by Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s dovish comments which spurred hopes the Fed may begin to slow down on its hiking cycle and helped US stocks notch their biggest daily gain since March. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) were underpinned from the open but with gains capped amid lingering trade uncertainty and inconclusive capex data for Australia, as well as mixed Japanese retail sales and a decline in USD/JPY. Hang Seng (-0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) both initially conformed to the positive tone but then stalled amid tariff threats with Chinese President Xi&rsquo;s offer of an olive branch to the US somewhat falling on deaf ears, as USTR Lighthizer said China has yet to offer meaningful proposals and suggested that the US are seeking to match China&rsquo;s tariffs on autos. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher as they nursed the prior day&rsquo;s losses after having found support around the 151.00 level and although today&rsquo;s mixed 2yr auction results failed to spur a reaction, prices continued to gain as the strength in the regional stock markets moderated.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade mostly positive as the regional bourses take impetus from their counterparts on Wall St. where stocks notched their biggest daily gain since March after Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s comments spurred hopes the Fed may begin to slow down on its hiking cycle. This underpinned ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) from the open but with gains capped amid lingering trade uncertainty and inconclusive capex data for Australia, as well as mixed Japanese retail sales and a decline in USD/JPY. Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) initially conformed to the positive tone but then stalled amid tariff threats as Chinese President Xi&rsquo;s offer of an olive branch to the US in which he stated China will sharply widen market access for foreign investors and step up protection of Intellectual Property rights, somewhat fell on deaf ears as USTR Lighthizer said China has yet to offer meaningful proposals and the US will examine all tools to match US tariffs on Chinese vehicles to the tariff levels imposed by China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD was pressured with the DXY back below 97.00 following comments by Fed Chair Powell that the policy rate is &quot;just below&quot; estimates of neutral which participants interpreted as a possible sign the Fed could begin to slow down on its hiking cycle and which was in contrast to Powell&rsquo;s prior view of rates being &ldquo;a long way&rdquo; from neutral. This benefitted the USD&rsquo;s major counterparts across the board in which EUR/USD and GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.1300 and 1.2800 handles respectively, while EM currencies were lifted in tandem and the PBoC strengthened their fix accordingly. Elsewhere, antipodeans also gained at the expense of the greenback and due to their high-beta status, although AUD/USD and NZD/USD have since pulled back from their highs following mixed Capex data from Australia in which the headline reading for Q3 unexpectedly declined and after further discouraging Business Confidence from New Zealand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher as they nurse the prior day&rsquo;s losses and after having found support around the 151.00 level, although price action is relatively tame with participants looking ahead to a 2yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
