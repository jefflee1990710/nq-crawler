Wires have tried to spin the equity price action by pointing to oil price gains, trade fears being on the bac-burner, and expectations of a decent earnings season; but in truth, action was subdued, and volumes were thin. However, US equity futures, were then pressured after-market following source reports that the US is planning to release a new USD 200bln China tariff as soon as today.

US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 3+ ticks lower at 120-00+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities up, Treasuries down, crude up, dollar up.<br />* REAR-VIEW: JOLTS slip, but quit rate at cycle high; more Brexit resignations; EIA cuts 2018 world demand growth view; earnings season underway, PEP beats on top and bottom-lines; very soft 3s auction.<br />* COMING-UP: BOC rate decision; ECB&rsquo;s Draghi, Praet, Mersch, Villeroy; BOE&rsquo;s Carney; Fed&rsquo;s Williams; NATO summit.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JOLTS: </strong>Job openings slipped by 200k in May to 6.6 million, which analysts at Wells Fargo said is still consistent with an extremely tight labour market. Analysts also noted that the quits rate rose to a new cyclical high at 2.4%, which may augur well for future wage growth. Meanwhile, the ratio between unemployed workers to job openings remained at the record low 0.9, lending to evidence of labour market tightness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED DISCOUNT RATE MINUTES: </strong>Fed directors reported solid economic activity; some regional Fed directors were concerned by trade risks. Eleven regional banks sought a hike to the discount rate (all but the NY Fed voted for a hike).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* * SPX +0.34% at 2794, NDX +0.04% at 7760, DJI +0.57% at 24917. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +1.26%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.22%, Energy: +0.73%, Financials: -0.37%, Health Care: +0.41%, Industrials: +0.34%, Materials: +0.84%, Telecoms: +1.13%, Tech: +0.23%, Utilities: +0.97%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>ES futures ultimately traversed horizontally, with most of the gains coming in overnight trade, where the Emini ticked up around 5 points to 2790, a level which it continued to straddle through European/North American trade (we did get into spitting distance of 2800 but stopped a couple of points short). Wires have tried to spin the equity price action by pointing to oil price gains, trade fears being on the bac-burner, and expectations of a decent earnings season; but in truth, action was subdued, and volumes were thin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>PepsiCo (PEP) kicked off earnings season with a top- and bottom-line beat; numbers were helped by its foods business, but it noted a loss of share in the cola marker, weighing on the beverage unit. Tesla (TSLA) was buoyed on news it plans to open a factory in China which will manufacture 500k vehicles annually. Microsoft (MSFT) was slightly higher after it slashed prices for Surface tablets, and introduced a new model with a $399 price point in order to compete with Apple (APPL). Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet&#39;s (GOOG, GOOGL) Google facing a multi-billion euro fine by EU antitrust regulators. In broker moves, Micron (MU) was positively mentioned in a JPMorgan note. Wynn (WYNN) resorts was upgraded at Stifel. On the other side, Chipotle (CMG) was hit after a downgrade at Mizuho, eBay (EBAY) was downgraded at SunTrust, Nordstrom (JWN) downgraded at Keybanc, and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) was downgraded at Evercore ISI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLES 3+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-00+. </strong>Despite thin volumes, the familiar theme of flattening was again seen on Tuesday; 2s30s and 5s30s printed fresh narrows not seen in a decade, while 2s10s narrowed further, and was beneath 28bps at settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 3-YEAR AUCTION REVIEW: </strong>The week&rsquo;s US supply got off to a very soft start, with the US selling $33bln at a high yield of 2.685% (highest stop-out rate since May 2007), tailing by 0.6bps (biggest tail since September 2017); cover, meanwhile was the weakest at a 3s auctions since April 2009. The internals were grim: direct bidders took the smallest share since December 2017, indirect bidders took the smallest since November 2014, leaving primary dealers with a huge 51.3%, the most since June 2014. The weak auction saw yields tick-up slightly in its wake. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 10-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>The Treasury will this week auction USD 69bln in new supply (USD 33bln of 3-year notes on Tuesday, USD 22bln 10-year reopening on Wednesday, USD 14bln of reopened 30-year bonds on Thursday). USD 28.7bln in new cash will be raised, given the USD 40.3bln maturing mid-month, according to TD Securities. Last month&rsquo;s 10s auction saw the highest cover since January, though the stop-out rate was the lowest since April. Dealer positioning suggests that dealers are net long to the tune of USD 3.82bln in the 7-11 year sector, also the lowest since April. Analysts at Societe Generale say the current 10s appear slightly cheap on the curve versus old 10s relative to the previous two auction cycles, and continues to trade near the cheapest level in years versus the 5s and 30s, though it has richened from May. SocGen notes, however, that 2s10s continues to flatten, and at 29bps, the spread is close to decade lows. Nevertheless, SocGen says the cheapness of the sector from a relative value perspective is a positive, but believes some concession may be required given benchmark 10-year yields are below the last two stop-out rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Q8) SETTLES 26C HIGHER AT $74.11/BBL; BRENT (U8) SETTLES 79C HIGHER AT $78.86/BBL. </strong>Crude extended gains ahead of weekly inventory US data, which is expected to show headline crude draw of 4.2mln, distillates are expected to build by 1.3mln, and gasoline stocks are seen drawing down by 900k. Brent was gaining support by the oil workers strike in Norway. There was also another round of belligerent talk from Iran, with the vice president saying Iran will sell as much oil as it can despite the US sanctions, adding that Iran will do everything so that America realises that they will not be able to stop Iranian oil exports. Meanwhile, US officials have reportedly held discussions in Saudi Arabia to help partners find alternatives to Iranian oil, and officials also discussed maintaining a well-stocked oil market to guard against volatility. In other geopolitics, the Houthis continue to attempt to fire missiles at the Saudi Jazan facility, though the Saudis intercepted the latest efforts. There were some negative ticks in the afternoon, after the EIA released its latest STEO, where it cut its forecast for 2018 world oil demand growth by 80k BPD, now sees 1.72mln BPD Y/Y rise; cuts forecast for 2019 world oil demand growth by 10k BPD, now sees a 1.71mln BPD Y/Y rise, and it left its estimate for US output unchanged at 10.79mln BPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX: </strong>It is hard to read too much into FX moves given that news flow has been quiet, and there has also been a quiet feel to markets on Tuesday. The general theme seems to be mild risk-on, with safe havens slipping (JPY down 0.35% versus the EUR and USD; CHF down by 0.1% vs the USD and the EUR; XAU is slightly negative, though did slip below $1250 briefly, before recovering). The EUR was being hampered by a weak German ZEW survey, which missed expectations. But the overall risk backdrop was constructive, which helped carry (AUDJPY up 0.45% despite trading flat against the buck, NZDUSD +0.45%, again despite the NZD being flat against the USD), and EMFX (BRL gains nearly 2% against the buck, ZAR around 1%, and even the TRY managed to carve out 0.6% gains against the dollar &ndash; the new Turkish finance chief said budget and fiscal discipline will be sustained more actively). Commodity FX was flat against the dollar, despite crude trading higher; the CAD is treading water ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s BOC rates decision, where it is expected to lift rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling, meanwhile, has stabilised after Monday&rsquo;s choppy session, with cable holding around 1.3260, while EURGBP slipped to as low as 0.8820 at one point, before making its way back towards 0.8850. There was some positive ticks on news that the two Tory Party vice chairs are the latest to quit their roles due to the government&rsquo;s handling of Brexit, and according to the Sun, more resignations are expected. Attention is on Thursday&rsquo;s release of the long-awaited white paper, which is expected to show a notable softening in the UK&rsquo;s negotiating position;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: BOC RATE DECISION. </strong>The Bank of Canada is likely to resume tightening policy and is seen hiking interest rates by 25bps to 1.50% on Wednesday. Of the 25 analysts surveyed by Reuters, 20 expect the BoC to hike with just 5 expecting no change at the meeting. Markets are currently pricing in over 95% chance for a rate hike at this meeting. The Monetary Policy Report is also due to be released at this meeting and there will be press conference from Governor Poloz and Deputy Governor Wilkins following the meeting at 1615BST/1115EDT. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19584/download\">Read the full RANsquawk preview here</a>.</p>\r\n",

Brent was gaining support by the oil workers strike in Norway. There was also another round of belligerent talk from Iran, with the vice president saying Iran will sell as much oil as it can despite the US sanctions, adding that Iran will do everything so that America realises that they will not be able to stop Iranian oil exports. Meanwhile, US officials have reportedly held discussions in Saudi Arabia to help partners find alternatives to Iranian oil, and officials also discussed maintaining a well-stocked oil market to guard against volatility. In other geopolitics, the Houthis continue to attempt to fire missiles at the Saudi Jazan facility, though the Saudis intercepted the latest efforts. There were some negative ticks in the afternoon, after the EIA released its latest STEO, where it cut its forecast for 2018 world oil demand growth by 80k BPD, now sees 1.72mln BPD Y/Y rise; cuts forecast for 2019 world oil demand growth by 10k BPD, now sees a 1.71mln BPD Y/Y rise, and it left its estimate for US output unchanged at 10.79mln BPD.</p>\r\n",

The last three 3-year note auctions have all seen tails of 0.1bps. TD Securities observes that &ldquo;the gradual increase in dealer takedowns alongside the increase in dealer inventories hints at growing pressure on front-end rates,&rdquo; and accordingly, it expects 2-year and 3-year Treasuries to continue cheapening against OIS.</p>\r\n",

Relatively firm growth estimates from the NIESR for Q2 and Q3 may have given Sterling a boost, while PM May surviving to fight another day after the post-Chequers fall-out certainly provided some respite ahead of the aforementioned data-fest. Cable is currently around 1.3270 within 1.3300-1.3225 parameters and Eur/Gbp under 0.8825 vs 0.8875 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biggest losers vs the Greenback, with the single currency ruffled by disappointing ZEW expectations and current conditions, and then buffeted amidst more Italian Euro exit headlines (Savona saying Rome must prepare for all eventualities and it could hinge on other members whether it stays or goes). Eur/Usd has recovered 1.1700+ status with decent bids said to be layered below the big figure and several MAs. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy has broken out of recent ranges and cleared multi-top resistance above 111.00 to reach 111.35 and the base of a 111.22-59 technical area that includes a major trend-line and decent offers between 111.40-50, according to market observers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next weakest major links, with the Franc losing out amidst broadly upbeat risk sentiment, like its Jpy safe-haven peer and down towards 0.9950 vs the Usd, while the Loonie failed to derive any real benefit from strong Canadian housing data in the form of starts and permits amidst some squaring and consolidation ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s BoC policy meeting. Usd/Cad held within a 1.3100-45 range as a 25 bp hike is almost unanimously anticipated and priced &ndash; full preview to be posted shortly via our headline feed and available on the research suite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty even-steven down under as the antipodean dollars both fell from recent peaks vs their US peer to around 0.7450 and 0.6825 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volatile trade for the Lira that slumped on President Erdogan&rsquo;s appointment of a new Treasury and Finance Minister to replace investor favourites previously holding each role, but the Try paring losses when the former (who is also a family member by marriage) pledged to follow strict budget and economic policies &ndash; Usd/Try now just below 4.7000 vs 4.7500+ at one stage. Conversely, then Nok tested bids vs the Eur under 9.3900 after firm headline Norwegian CPI before losing momentum on the benign core indices.</p>\r\n",

The bearish tone is more in keeping with moves elsewhere, ie Bunds down to 162.36 (-1/4 point on the day), and also in advance of a packed domestic agenda with multiple releases at 9.30BST, including the new ONS monthly GDP series.

Ahead, the latest ZEW survey may provide some additional impetus , especially as economic sentiment and current conditions are both forecast to moderate vs other surveys and data coming in above consensus or more stable. Turning to the near term technical outlook, market contacts note that a chart gap has been filled at 162.54 after the initial mark down to 162.49 and dip to 162.47, but intraday resistance resides up at 162.61 and yesterday&rsquo;s session low was 162.35.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) initially took impetus from US and both opened higher although the Australia index later pared gains amid losses in its largest weighted financials sector, while Tokyo stocks remained firm on a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) conformed to the overall positive tone but the Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) was choppy after continued inaction by the PBoC resulted to a CNY 30bln liquidity drain, while participants also digested CPI and PPI figures which either printed inline or firmer than expected. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued with demand weighed by the overall positive risk appetite and after the 5yr auction failed to support prices despite showing stronger interest with both b/c and accepted prices firmer than prior.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 30bln.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>There were some initial rumours that suggested pro-Brexit lawmakers have the necessary 48 &#39;letters&#39; to force a confidence vote on UK PM May. However, the head of the Conservative 1922 Committee indicated that he did not receive the 48 letters required for a leadership challenge, while there were comments from UK Conservative Party chairman Lewis and Eurosceptic lawmaker Rees-Mogg that they didn&rsquo;t expect a confidence vote against PM May. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>UK PM May spokesperson stated that there is no question of revisiting the Brexit position agreed by the Cabinet on Friday, while the UK named Jeremy Hunt as the new Foreign Secretary to replace Boris Johnson following his resignation.

The slightly firmer greenback and increased risk appetite helped USD/JPY just reclaim the 111.00 handle, while antipodeans were also mildly supported following the Chinese inflation figures and as CNH extended its gains with USD/CNH briefly testing 6.6000 to the downside. Elsewhere, TRY weakened after President Erdogan announced his new cabinet in which he appointed his son-in-law Berat Albayrak for the newly created Treasury and Finance Minister role which will replace the roles held by Deputy PM Simsek and Finance Minister Agbal who were both viewed as market friendly and were also seen as key advocates for higher rates.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Commodities saw mild upside overnight in which WTI gained a firmer footing on the USD 74.00/bbl level where it consolidated for most the session and with focus turning to today&rsquo;s API inventory report and on any potential impact from oil drillers striking in Norway. Elsewhere, gold was rangebound with price action relatively calm in comparison to the prior day&rsquo;s USD-driven swings, while copper is also marginally higher alongside the overall tone in the complex but has pared some of its gains as risk appetite in mainland gradually waned.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>UAE Energy Minister and OPEC President Al-Mazrouei said he doesn&#39;t foresee a need for an extraordinary meeting before December and that OPEC focus is on supply and demand balance, not targeting price. Furthermore, Al- Mazrouei had earlier commented that time is needed for extra supply to come into the market, that OPEC has enough capacity to offset output shortfalls and that OPEC doesn&#39;t want to overdo efforts to boost supply. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Norway oil drillers are said to strike following failure of wage mediation discussions.

The long-end led the sell-off, with 10yr yields rising by c.3bps (seeing 2s10s rise a touch, taking it to just under 30bps), resulting in a modestly steeper curve. US 10YR T-notes futures (u8) settled 7 ticks lower at 120-04.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>San Francisco Fed economic letter noted economic upside from tax cuts may not meet analysts&#39; overly optimistic expectations.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly higher on the momentum from Wall St where the DJIA notched its best performance in a month, and financials outperformed on optimism heading into earnings season. ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) initially took impetus from US and both opened higher although the Australia index later pared gains amid losses in its largest weighted financials sector, while Tokyo stocks remained firm on a weaker currency with Yahoo Japan shares surging on reports of a share repurchase and with Softbank adding to its stake in the Co. for USD 2bln. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.3%) conforms to the overall positive tone and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) is choppy after continued inaction by the PBoC which resulted to a CNY 30bln liquidity drain. However, there were reports that a PBoC adviser sees room for a further liquidity injection, while participants also get to digest CPI and PPI figures which either printed inline or firmer than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively uneventful with the DXY flat and holding above the 94.00 level which also kept trade in its major counterparts quiet, with EUR/USD oscillating around the 1.1750 level and GBP/USD taking a breather from the prior tumultuous day triggered by cabinet resignations and threat of a no-confidence vote against UK PM May. The slightly firmer greenback and increased risk appetite helped USD/JPY just about reclaim the 111.00 handle, while antipodeans are also mildly supported following the Chinese inflation figures and as CNH extends its gains with USD/CNH briefly testing 6.6000 to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued with demand weighed by the overall positive risk appetite and ahead of a 5yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
