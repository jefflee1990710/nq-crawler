Threats by US President Trump that he would potentially veto the government funding bill also kept equities on the back foot, though rallied after he signed the bill, that will keep the government open until September, though the rally proved fragile, and selling action returned as traders settled up for the week, pushing shares to session lows. During the choppy trade, the VIX rose to above 25 again, the highest since 2 March. Also, in late trade SPX broke the psychological level 2600 and headed towards the 200d ma, 2590, which it bounced off on the close. Looking to stock-specifics, S&amp;P was being led by Foot Locker (FL) following positive earnings from Nike (NKE) after market on Thursday; Cintas was positive on earnings; and defence names (LMT, NOC, RTN) up following an increased budget for the US military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX: DXY closes the week -0.8%&nbsp;</strong>Havens (JPY, EUR, CHF) all higher on the day, as the DXY ends Friday 0.5% lower (down around 0.8% for the week, snapping two weeks of gains). Despite the roller-coaster rides seen this week, the DXY range between 89.40 and 90.50 has held. Gold is up, buoyed by a weak dollar and lower yields. CAD is one of the top performers on Friday, following solid CPI data (which offset mediocre retail data) which saw the average of the three BOC measures (trimmed mean, median, and common) jumped to 2.03% (versus 1.83% in the January data) above the BOC&#39;s 2% midpoint of its 1-3% target range. The data did little to push a&nbsp;repricing for the April BOC meeting, though the July and October meetings are now fully priced. GBP is higher against the USD, helped by hawkish comments from BOE&#39;s Vlieghe (data has moved in a direction that warrants removal of stimulus), though couldn&#39;t carve out gains vs the EUR. EMFX is up against the USD, with the exception of TRY. Other commodity FX (AUD, NZD) trades higher, following Trade War speculation that China may sway towards Australian imports rather than US imports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: US T-Note futures (Jun&#39;18) settle 3 ticks higher at 120-19+.&nbsp;</strong>The Tsy curve bulls-steepened, catching a bid amid soft risk-appetite on the back of Trade Wars fears. Yields on 2s lower by around 3bps, as were 5s, while 10s yields were 1bps lower, and 30s were unchanged in thin volume. Some analysts have expressed astonishment that 10-year yields haven&#39;t managed to meaningfully breach the 2.80% level to the downside (while the 3.00% level seems to be solidly reinforced), in spite of soft risk sentiment. One desk noted that it may be a function of shorts sitting on tidy profits this year, giving them a thicker buffer to absorb losses due to rallies. Other desks have suggested that levels near/sub 2.80% have represented good areas to add shorts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI futures settle $1.53 at $65.71 (Jun&#39;18); Brent settles $1.42 higher at $68.38 (Jun&#39;18).</strong> Front month backwardation (M8/N8 spread) widened by 7 cents to 42 cents on the day. The geopolitical risk premium in crude has driven sharp gains in WTI this week, and WTI finishes green for the third straight week. Markets have taken the nominations of Mike Pompeo (as Sec of State) and John Bolton (as Nat Sec advisor) as a hawkish sign that the US is tilting towards backing out of the Iran nuclear deal in May, and reapplying sanctions on the country &ndash; which would likely hinder Iran in raising capital to finance a boost to refinery output. Along with a healthy dose of optimistic jawboning from OPEC Sec Gen Barkindo earlier in the week,&nbsp;(the worst is over for the oil market) and Saudi energy minister Al Falih yesterday, (who sees cooperation between OPEC+ in 2019) helping to support crude prices amid distinctly risk-off tone this week, where equities slid.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>USD, JPY</strong> : This week saw trade wars escalate after President Trump announced tariffs OF USD 50bln against China over intellectual property theft. In retaliation to this, China announced tariffs on USD 3bln of US imports. Subsequently, risk sentiment had been dented, notably benefiting the JPY across the board, which saw USD/JPY reached the lowest level since Nov&rsquo;16 after tripping through YTDs low of 105.23. Aside from protectionist policies, Wednesday saw the FOMC hike rates, the greenback ultimately softened after members maintained 2018 rate path view of 3 rate hikes (1 member away from median projection at 4). Additionally, the central bank steepened the path of rate hikes for 2019-2020, however the council did soften language around activity. DXY back down to mid-89 while March lows of 89.40 continue to act as support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong>: Brexit breakthrough after the UK and EU agree transition with an Irish border back-stop, providing good news for the GBP bulls, which saw the currency among the top G10 currencies for the week. Elsewhere, the Bank of England&rsquo;s hawkish vote split took the spot rate past 1.42, however, the central bank refrained from confirming a rate hike is a done deal for May (current pricing at 60%), with much of the report largely in line with the February QIR. Interestingly, members did sight concerns over dampening effects of global protectionism. UK data points (employment, inflation and retail sales) largely in line with the banks forecasts. Focus will turn to BoE member comments as we head towards the May meeting with hawkish talk likely to see GBP revisit the Jan&rsquo;18 highs of 1.4344.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong>: Bullish NAFTA noise and strong Canadian data at the back end of the week provided tailwind for the CAD with bets increasing that the slightly rosier outlook for the Canadian economy could point to another rate hike from the BoC. Friday&rsquo;s inflation data printed at 2.2%, above the central banks price target, while hurdles in regards to the NAFTA looked to have eased with all three parties seemingly keen to reach an agreement. USD/CAD eying near term support targets of 1.28 with a firm break, suggesting a potential pullback to 1.26.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, there were also comments from Mofcom that China doesn&#39;t want a trade war but is not afraid of one, while the ministry added it hopes US will be prudent in its decisions and pulls back from the &#39;brink&#39;.

The intensified trade tensions triggered a bloodbath across stock markets with <strong>ASX 200 (-2.0%)</strong> led lower by miners as Chinese metals prices slumped on steel demand and tariff concerns, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (-4.5%)</strong> was the worst performer and briefly fell over 1000 points as selling pressure was magnified by a firmer JPY. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (-2.5%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-3.4%) </strong>conformed to the sell-off as Chinese stocks felt the pinch from the US trade offensive, while the PBoC refrained from open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 320bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded higher to track the gains in T-notes amid a safe-haven bid and with the BoJ present in the market under its massive bond buying program. This helped 10yr JGB prices back above 151.00 and saw the 10yr yield slip to below 0.025% which was its lowest since November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 320bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 240bln net injection.

Taking a closer look at sectors<strong>, materials (-1.8%) and industrials ( -1.6%)</strong> are lagging behind due to their vast exposure to the Chinese market and are immediately followed by <strong>IT (-1.9%), financials (-1.6%) and consumer discretionary (-1.3%). </strong>On the flip side, <strong>Next (+7.5%)</strong> is leading the FTSE100 after maintaining its profit guidance this morning and against the recent backdrop of the retail sector whilst <strong>GSK (+3.6%)</strong> is the outperformer in the index after it officially announced its withdrawal for its takeover of Pfizer&rsquo;s health unit, following its rival Reckitt Benckiser who ended talks over the acquisition of the unit yesterday. Elsewhere, Indivior sank more than 20% at the open after the US court turned against the co. and is said to favour its competitor Alvogen. In the DAX, <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> is down 12.7% for the week, extending losses over the widening LIBOR &ndash; OIS spread which is believed to provide a headwind for the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets continue to be swayed by the prospect of ongoing &lsquo;trade wars&rsquo; which have adopted more of a bilateral dynamic over the past 24 hours with exemptions for Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea and EU. In terms of the follow through for FX markets, the DXY is softer and back below 90.00 but largely a by-product of the safe-haven bid into JPY which knocked USD/JPY (temporarily) below 105.00 after the pair breached the YTD low at 105.23 during yesterday&rsquo;s trade. From a technical perspective, some analysts are pointing towards 103.64 as a key level which marks the 76.4% Fib from the 99.00-118.66 recovery seen in 2016; a view held by IFR. Elsewhere, the USD softness has provided a modest lift to <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> holding onto 1.2300, however <strong>GBP</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> gave up the 1.4100 handle. For <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong>, barring any major macro developments and amid a light data docket for the EZ, 2.3bln in expiries between 1.2250 and 1.2300 could act as a guiding force for prices. Back to <strong>GBP</strong> and amid the fallout of yesterday&rsquo;s BoE release, focus for the UK will likely be on developments in Brussels at the EU council meeting (albeit seen as somewhat of a rubber stamp process). N.b. BoE Vlieghe to speak at 1230GMT. Elsewhere, <strong>AUD</strong> has also benefited from the softer <strong>USD</strong> despite the risk environment, albeit the pair may struggle to make any meaningful progress above 0.7730-40. Interestingly, despite concerns over potential faltering demand from China (Australia&rsquo;s major trading partner), some suggest AUD could benefit if China opts to use Australian goods as a substitute for US ones. Moving forward, <strong>CAD</strong> will likely come into focus later today amid domestic CPI and retail sales releases. Traders will be looking to see if today&rsquo;s releases conform to the recent slew of soft data whilst NAFTA concerns linger in the background. If this materialises, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>CAD</strong> could make a firmer reclaiming of the 1.3000 level to the upside but would still have some way to go to hit the 2018 high around 1.3125.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EGB&rsquo;s</strong> have pulled off better levels despite the selloff observed in equity markets, however they do remain at elevated levels amid the trade war concerns. Bund&rsquo;s trading in a relatively tight 20 tick range, earlier high just shy off the 159 level, further escalation of trade wars could see a breaching of this level. Elsewhere, peripheral markets are slightly wider vs core EGB&rsquo;s with <strong>BTPs</strong> notably losing ground, down 30 ticks last. Italy&rsquo;s parliament reconvenes today in order to find a solution to the current stalemate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bono&rsquo;s</strong> set to come into focus later today as S&amp;P reviews Spanish debt, many are indicating that this may be upgraded to A- from BBB+, which could provide tailwinds from being eligible for purchases by sovereign funds and central banks. Quite morning in the <strong>Gilt</strong> markets with EU confirming the UK&rsquo;s transition period deal, as expected after the breakthrough earlier in the week. As such, <strong>Gilts</strong> are relatively flat to hover above 122, as a reminder, month-end extensions is seen at +0.22y for the GBP aggregate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at the commodities complex, <strong>WTI</strong> (+0.1%) and <strong>Brent</strong> Crude (+0.3%) are underpinned by the latest comment from Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih stating that there is still time to go before OPEC+ supply cut oil inventories to &quot;normal levels&quot; adding that OPEC/Non-OPEC will still require coordination in 2019. Additionally, the latest White House replacement of National Security Adviser HR McMaster with hardliner John Bolton, ahead of a key decision on May 12th regarding whether to maintain the Iran nuclear deal, raises the prospect of sanctions against Iran&rsquo;s oil sales. Something to be aware of, with driving season edging closer, refineries are stocking up on crude oil to meet the seasonal demand for the summer driving season commencing in a few weeks. Moving onto metals, <strong>Gold</strong> (+1.0%) prices hit highs last seen in early February, boosted as investors flock into the traditional safe haven following the eruption of a trade war between US and China. Furthermore, a softer dollar this week has been supporting the yellow metal. Base metals on the other hand have fallen amid escalating trade concerns. Chinese <strong>steel</strong> futures fell more than 6%, hitting their lowest level in more than eight months while <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> also shed over 6% hitting lows last seen in June 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lukoil VP says if US oil output continues to increase OPEC and Russia could extend oil cuts into 2019.

Furthermore, a softer dollar this week has been supporting the yellow metal. Base metals on the other hand have fallen amid escalating trade concerns. Chinese steel futures fell more than 6%, hitting their lowest level in more than eight months while Dalian iron ore also shed over 6% hitting lows last seen in June 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>FX markets continue to be swayed by the prospect of ongoing &lsquo;trade wars&rsquo; which have adopted more of a bilateral dynamic over the past 24 hours with exemptions for Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea and EU. In terms of the follow through for FX markets, the DXY is softer and back below 90.00 but largely a by-product of the safe-haven bid into JPY which knocked USD/JPY (temporarily) below 105.00 after the pair breached the YTD low at 105.23 during yesterday&rsquo;s trade. From a technical perspective, some analysts are pointing towards 103.64 as a key level which marks the 76.4% Fib from the 99.00-118.66 recovery seen in 2016; a view held by IFR. Elsewhere, the USD softness has provided a modest lift to EUR/USD and GBP/USD with both pairs holding onto 1.2300 and 1.4100 respectively. For EUR/USD, barring any major macro developments and amid a light data docket for the EZ, 2.3bln in expiries between 1.2250 and 1.2300 could act as a guiding force for prices. Back to GBP and amid the fallout of yesterday&rsquo;s BoE release, focus for the UK will likely be on developments in Brussels at the EU council meeting (albeit seen as somewhat of a rubber stamp process). N.b. BoE Vleighe to speak at 1230GMT. Elsewhere, AUD has also benefited from the softer USD despite the risk environment, albeit the pair may struggle to make any meaningful progress above 0.7730-40. Interestingly, despite concerns over potential faltering demand from China (Australia&rsquo;s major trading partner), some suggest AUD could benefit if China opts to use Australian goods as a substitute for US ones. Moving forward, CAD will likely come into focus later today amid domestic CPI and retail sales releases. Traders will be looking to see if today&rsquo;s releases conforms to the recent slew of soft data whilst NAFTA concerns linger in the background. If this materialises, USD/CAD could make a firmer reclaiming of the 1.3000 level to the upside but would still have some way to go to hit the 2018 high around 1.3125.</p>\r\n",

However, as China threatened to hit back at the US with retaliations, basic materials took a hit with steel and aluminium names (X, NUE, STLD) all took a leg lower.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks saw hefty losses on trade war fears after the US announced USD 50bln of tariffs on China and with the latter planning tariffs of USD 3bln in retaliation, while it was also reported that National Security Advisor McMasters was replaced by policy hawk John Bolton. The intensified trade tensions triggered a bloodbath across stock markets with ASX 200 (-2.0%) led lower by miners as Chinese metals prices slumped on steel demand and tariff concerns, while Nikkei 225 (-4.6%) was the worst performer and fell around&nbsp;1000 points as selling pressure was magnified by a firmer JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-3.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-3.4%) conformed to the sell-off as Chinese stocks felt the pinch from the US trade offensive, while the PBoC refrained from open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 320bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs traded higher to track the gains in T-notes amid a safe-haven bid and with the BoJ present in the market under its massive bond buying program. This helped 10yr JGB prices back above 151.00 and saw the 10yr yield slip to below 0.025% which was its lowest since November.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade with hefty losses on trade war fears after the US announced USD 50bln of tariffs on China and with the latter planning tariffs on USD 3bln of US imports in retaliation, while it was also reported that National Security Advisor McMasters was replaced by policy hawk John Bolton. The intensified trade tensions triggered a bloodbath across stock markets with ASX 200 (-2.1%) led lower by miners as Chinese metals prices slump on steel demand and tariff concerns, while Nikkei 225 (-3.7%) is the worst performer as selling pressure is magnified by a firmer JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-3.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.9%) conform to the sell-off as Chinese stocks feel the pinch from the US trade offensive and with the PBoC refraining from open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 320bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action remained dictated by the risk sentiment with safe-haven JPY outperforming amid the trade tension turmoil, which saw USD/JPY slip below the 105.00 handle for the first time since late 2016. Elsewhere, USD remains subdued and languishes below the 90.00 level as its major counterparts nurse losses, after EUR/USD found support at 1.2300 and with GBP/USD attempting to gain a firmer footing on the 1.4100 handle. Commodity-linked currencies have also found mild relief overnight as gold gains on safe-haven flows and with oil underpinned following comments from Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih that OPEC/Non-OPEC will still require coordination in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs traded higher to track the gains in T-notes amid a safe-haven bid and with the BoJ present in the market under its massive bond buying program. This helped 10yr JGB prices back above 151.00 and saw the 10yr yield slip to below 0.025% which was its lowest since November.</p>\r\n",
