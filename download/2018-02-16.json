        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +0.1% at 2739, DJI +0.1% at 25281, NDX -0.1% at 6785</strong><br />Top sectors: Healthcare +0.9%, Telecoms +0.9%, Utilities +0.9%<br />Bottom sectors: Cons Disc -0.3%, Materials -0.1% Energy -0.1%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SPX prints its sixth straight day of gains, as traders question whether the recent VIX-inspired sell-off can actually be considered anything close to &ldquo;market turmoil,&rdquo; though some traders still note that the ES is yet to fully pare back those losses, and reclaim the 2785 level. The risk tone was once again firm on Friday, until headlines hit stating that Special Counsel Mueller had indicted 13 Russians and three entities with regards to interference in the 2016 Presidential Election. At the time, stock indices were losing steam, with ES March&rsquo;18 contract struggling to negotiate the 2750 handle, and the news brought out the sellers. The indictments contained no allegations that an American citizen was knowingly involved in US election meddling, and after stocks skidded lower into negative territory, buyers emerged around the key 2725 level, and stocks once again found themselves in positive territory, though the social media names weighed on the Nasdaq, which finished red.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES:&nbsp; US T-Note futures (March 2018) settle 4 ticks higher at 120-18+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury complex was immune to headlines that Special Counsel Mueller had indicted 13 Russians and three entities for meddling in the 2016 US Presidential Election. The curve was slightly higher pre-market, though buyers emerged for a second day, with no specific news catalyst. Some had rationalised the moves by suggesting that US Treasuries were oversold in many places, from a technical perspective. Either way, the net impact was narrowing in major curve spreads (2s10s -c4bps, 2s30s -c3bps, hough 5s30s was up slightly)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY ends the week 1.5% lower</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of the long weekend, the USD snapped its run of four straight days of losses, ending the week with a positive day, but still looks set to close the week with a c1.5% loss. After this week&rsquo;s CPI and retail sales data, there hasn&rsquo;t been anything specific for FX traders to latch on to, and data and politics have generally played second fiddle to position adjusting. Many now are resuming the narrative of a weaker dollar based on expected twin deficits, trade protectionism, and other central banks playing catch-up to the US tightening cycle &ndash; helping their currencies appreciate &ndash; all amid a background of decent global growth. EUR gave up the 1.25 handle, GBP gave up 1.41, and JPY climbed back above 106 after falling to 105.50 overnight.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 34 cents higher at $61.68 per barrel; Brent futures settle 51 cents higher at $64.84 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crude complex was shaken in the early part of the week by bearish updates from the EIA, IEA as well as OPEC, whose forecasts all showed that global supply growth was set to outpace demand growth. However, at the end of the week &ndash; and looking with a wider lens &ndash; crude has generally looked-through the news, in part supported by comments from Saudi Arabia and Russia (Saudis set to trim production next month), but mainly taking its cue from &lsquo;recovering&rsquo; global risk sentiment and optimism about global growth prospects, as well as the USD weakness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>It&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint a catalyst, but technicals and positioning certainly played a role in the Usd revival at the end of a bleak week. The DXY found some traction around a key chart Fib at 88.250 and gradually gained recovery momentum to reclaim 89.000 and a bit more before fading again. It remains to be seen how specs are positioned, but a still heavily oversold Dollar may have seen shorts pare back. Regardless, Usd/Jpy did not claim another big figure scalp on the downside having tested 105.50 vs 109.00 approximately on Monday, but key will be a close above or below 106.50 from circa 106.25 currently. Eur/Usd is roughly 100 pips off its 1.2555 peak, but stops touted on a break of 1.2450 have not pushed the pair convincingly back below the 200 MMA (1.2453). Cable has pulled back further, but not below 1.4000 and Usd/Cad has topped out around 1.2550 despite weak Canadian data in the form of manufacturing sales. Usd/Chf has bounced relatively firmly above 0.9250 as Wall Street reclaimed early losses, while Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd retreat from near 0.8000 and 0.7400+ highs with the latter not just capped by 0.8000 resistance, but also a key tech level just below (0.7992). In short, the buck may have found some traction ahead of the long US holiday weekend, but it is far too premature to call an end to the latest losing streak or any turnaround in fortunes.</p>\r\n",

Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher as Japanese yields retreated across the curve and which also followed the gains in USTs during the prior session, while the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds failed to impact prices with the results broadly inline with the prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk506540479\">Japan submitted nomination for BoJ Governor Kuroda to stay on for another term, while it also nominated reflationist academic Wakatabe and BoJ&rsquo;s Amamiya as Deputy Governors. </a>(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House urged the House to advance the Goodlatte immigration proposal after 4 bills were defeated in the Senate.

All ten sectors trade in positive territory with outperformance in utility names following stellar earnings from <strong>EDF (+6.2%),</strong> subsequently dragging other names in the space higher. Elsewhere, energy names are performing well as prices remain supported by the softer USD. This morning&rsquo;s equity newsflow has been largely dominated by a busy slate of earnings from the likes of <strong>Renault (+3.1%), Eni (+1.5%), Allianz (-0.7%) </strong>and<strong> Vivendi (-5.8%) </strong>which have provided a bulk of the focus for traders thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Jpy&rsquo;s</strong> flight continues to compound the Dollar&rsquo;s plight amongst G10 majors, but the Greenback remains a broader loser as EM currencies and commodities also prosper amidst the latest <strong>Usd</strong> sell-off. The <strong>DXY</strong> only just held above major Fib support at 88.250 overnight as <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong> selling eased up ahead of 105.50. However, only mild verbal acknowledgment of the largely one-way tide from Japanese officials, and no mention of intervention inspired a tame or token rebound to around 106.00 before the slide resumed. The <strong>Aud</strong> and <strong>Nzd</strong> are now looking at 0.8000 and 0.7450 vs their US counterpart, while the <strong>Eur</strong> has eclipsed its previous 2018 peak to trade just above 1.2550 and a few pips over the 1.2551 100 MMA having surpassed the 200 version (1.2453) on the way. Stops are said to waiting on a break of 1.2570, ahead of the next upside tech target at 1.2598, but a decent 1.2550 option expiry (1 bn) may keep the pair in check. <strong>Cable</strong> has now advanced through 1.4100 and almost hit 1.4144, with price action relatively contained following this morning&rsquo;s below-expectation UK retail sales release. <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Chf</strong> is seriously testing the 0.9200 handle, with 0.9175 in sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japan&#39;s Chief Govt. spokesman said the FX market has shown one-sided moves recently. He added no need to change government stance on FX however no comments were added on whether appropriate measures include FX intervention. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gilts</strong> and <strong>Bunds</strong> squeezing higher again as more short positions are pared or liquidated ahead of the long US holiday weekend, and with buyers getting extra incentive from sub-forecast UK retail sales. The core 10 year bonds have now been up to 121.01 and 158.20 respectively, +42 and +32 ticks on the day, with some also pointing to bullish chart impulses amidst several gaps being filled in the process. On that note, the Eurex benchmark will now be eyeing Wednesday&rsquo;s session best at 158.38, while its UK peer needs to make a clean break above 121.00 before challenging the next tech resistance levels. Turning to <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong>, the curve flattening theme is still prevalent as the short end continues to underperform on the hawkish Fed rate hike vibe following latest data showing an acceleration in wages, factory gate and consumer prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, <strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> crude futures continue to benefit from the softer USD with prices eyeing USD 62.00bbl and USD 65.00bbl to the upside respectively despite forecasts for a continuation of surging US production and a slew of markets currently shut in Asia; Baker Hughes set to take focus in the latter stages of the session. In metals markets, <strong>gold</strong> is on course for its largest percentage rise in two years as the softer USD and buying ahead of the Chinese Lunar New year dictated a bulk of the price action. Elsewhere, <strong>copper</strong> has also benefited from the aforementioned currency swings and global manufacturing picture with prices on track for their largest gain in over a year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Eur/Usd is having a look at 1.2500 again, and Usd/Jpy is picking off more offers said to be layered just above 106.00. The looming long US holiday weekend does offer the Greenback some further respite on short covering grounds, but it remains to be seen whether it can stop the rot and regain its early February recovery momentum or if the end-2017 into January bear trend has returned with a vengeance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>European equities (Eurostoxx 50 +0.9%) trade higher across the board after what was another firm close on Wall Street (S&amp;P 500 +1.2%). All ten sectors trade in positive territory with outperformance in utility names following stellar earnings from EDF (+6.2%), subsequently dragging other names in the space higher. Elsewhere, energy names are performing well as prices remain supported by the softer USD. This morning&rsquo;s equity newsflow has been largely dominated by a busy slate of earnings from the likes of Renault (+3.1%), Eni (+1.5%), Allianz (-0.7%) and Vivendi (-5.8%) which have provided a bulk of the focus for traders thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jpy&rsquo;s flight continues to compound the Dollar&rsquo;s plight amongst G10 majors, but the Greenback remains a broader loser as EM currencies and commodities also prosper amidst the latest Usd sell-off. The DXY only just held above major Fib support at 88.250 overnight as Usd/Jpy selling eased up ahead of 105.50. However, only mild verbal acknowledgment of the largely one-way tide from Japanese officials, and no mention of intervention inspired a tame or token rebound to around 106.00 before the slide resumed. The Aud and Nzd are now looking at 0.8000 and 0.7450 vs their US counterpart, while the Eur has eclipsed its previous 2018 peak to trade just above 1.2550 and a few pips over the 1.2551 100 MMA having surpassed the 200 version (1.2453) on the way. Stops are said to waiting on a break of 1.2570, ahead of the next upside tech target at 1.2598, but a decent 1.2550 option expiry (1 bn) may keep the pair in check. Cable has now advanced through 1.4100 and almost hit 1.4144, with price action relatively contained following this morning&rsquo;s below-expectation UK retail sales release. Usd/Chf is seriously testing the 0.9200 handle, with 0.9175 in sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts and Bunds squeezing higher again as more short positions are pared or liquidated ahead of the long US holiday weekend, and with buyers getting extra incentive from sub-forecast UK retail sales. The core 10 year bonds have now been up to 120.99 and 158.18 respectively, +40 and +30 ticks on the day, with some also pointing to bullish chart impulses amidst several gaps being filled in the process. On that note, the Eurex benchmark will now be eyeing Wednesday&rsquo;s session best at 158.38, while its UK peer clearly has 121.00 to overcome before challenging levels above the round number. Turning to US Treasuries, the curve flattening theme is still prevalent as the short end continues to underperform on the hawkish Fed rate hike vibe following latest data showing an acceleration in wages, factory gate and consumer prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures continue to benefit from the softer USD with prices eyeing USD 62.00bbl and USD 65.00bbl to the upside respectively despite forecasts for a continuation of surging US production and a slew of markets currently shut in Asia; Baker Hughes set to take focus in the latter stages of the session. In metals markets, gold is on course for its largest percentage rise in two years as the softer USD and buying ahead of the Chinese Lunar New year dictated a bulk of the price action. Elsewhere, copper has also benefited from the aforementioned currency swings and global manufacturing picture with prices on track for their largest gain in over a year. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Thursday&rsquo;s short covering rebound amidst further yield curve flattening has stalled, again, with the 10 year German debt future unable to recapture the 158.00 level or maintain a rebound above tech resistance levels around the big figure before ending the Eurex session at 157.88. Hence, the overall bear trend remains intact and Bunds have retreated to 157.66 so far awaiting more direction and opportunities to sell. As usual German wholesale prices did not really impact despite a significant beat vs expectations in m/m terms and the data slate is blank ahead, but ECB&rsquo;s Coeure may provide some impetus ahead of several US releases in the pm session. However, core EU debt continues to take its main cues from US Treasury counterparts that have paused just before the next key levels in futures, and perhaps more importantly in yields, ie 10 year just shy of 2.95% on course for 3%?</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) continues to defy the recent JPY strength and outperforms as participants widely anticipated the Japanese government nominations for Kuroda to serve a 2<sup>nd</sup> term, as well as BoJ&rsquo;s Amamiya and reflationist academic Wakatabe for the Deputy Governor positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are uneventful amid the holiday-quietened conditions, although the greenback gave further ground to its major counterparts with EUR/USD and GBP/USD trading at the 1.2500 and 1.4100 handles respectively. Elsewhere, AUD/USD is flat after it largely ignored comments from RBA Governor Lowe who reiterated that the most likely next move in rates is up but he doesn&#39;t see a strong case for a near-term policy adjustment, while the Japanese government nominations for the BoJ including a 2<sup>nd</sup> term for Governor Kuroda failed to spur a reaction as this was widely expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as Japanese yields retreat across the curve and which also follows the gains in USTs during the prior session, while focus now shifts to the enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated Japanese bonds later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
