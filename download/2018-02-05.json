        "subject": "PREVIEW: Reserve Bank Of Australia Monetary Policy Decision Preview, Due On Tuesday 6th February 2018 At 03:30 GMT",
        "content": "<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will issue its first monetary policy decision of 2018 on Tuesday following a 2-month hiatus. Consensus looks for the central bank to keep its Cash Rate target unchanged at the record low of 1.50%, where it has stood since mid-2016, with only one of those surveyed by Reuters looking for a hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is reflected in ASX 30-Day interbank cash rate futures which have fully priced in no change this time out, while the OIS curve indicates little chance of any rate adjustments until November at the earliest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some analysts have also begun pushing back expectations for when the RBA will start lifting rates, following a bout of softer than expected data. This includes Q4 CPI in which the headline printed at 1.9% Y/Y vs. Exp. 2.0% (Prev. 1.8%), while the RBA&#39;s preferred trimmed mean reading stood at 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.9% (Prev. 1.8%), both below the central bank&#39;s 2%-3% target range, therefore restricting scope for tighter policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the latest building approvals data showed a significant contraction in December and although the employment change surpassed estimates in the labour market report from the same month, which was accompanied by an unexpected rise in the unemployment rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of rhetoric, there hasn&#39;t been much from the central bank since the most recent meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his final address of 2017 RBA Governor Philip Lowe noted that &ldquo;the continuing spare capacity in the economy and the subdued outlook for inflation mean that there is not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Board member Harper stated that there was a chance that the unemployment rate needs to fall below 5% before wages and inflation can respond accordingly, while he added that the current economic situation merits rates remaining supportive of the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, notorious RBA watcher McCrann has stated that the RBA will keep rates unchanged this week and indicated that it has no intention of changing rates, while he also pointed to stable inflation adding to the case for steady rates.<br /><br />With expectations for no change focus will turn to the accompanying statement for clues of future policy as any bias in its tone could impact AUD accordingly. Participants will also be eyeing any significant jawboning of the currency given its strength against the greenback which saw AUD/USD trade above 0.8100 in late January vs. the present 0.7600 at the last rate decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus will then move to Governor Lowe&rsquo;s speech on Thursday (09:00 GMT), and then onto the Bank&rsquo;s quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy on Friday (00:30 GMT).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the bank desks are saying: -</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ANZ:</strong> The coming week is very much about the RBA. Not only do we have the monthly Board meeting on Tuesday, but we also get the RBA&rsquo;s quarterly forecast update and policy statement on Friday, and the Governor is giving a speech on Thursday evening. All of which provides the RBA with plenty of opportunity to update its view. While the cash rate will remain on hold, we think the tone of the RBA commentary will be more upbeat after a positive run of data both domestically and globally. The higher AUD provides a bit of an offset and may see some refinement to the RBA&rsquo;s commentary around the currency, but its move in trade weighted terms since November is minimal and commodity prices are stronger so we don&rsquo;t think there will be that much concern about the impact of the higher AUD/USD. In terms of the RBA&rsquo;s forecasts the one substantive change we are looking for is a lower unemployment forecast. We think it is likely that the Bank will reduce the 2018 year-end forecast from 51&frasl;2% to 51&frasl;4% and predict 5% by the end of the forecast period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CBA:</strong> Australian central bankers return from holidays this week with the first Board meeting of the year on Tuesday and the next Statement on Monetary Policy (SMP) on Friday. There is also a speech by RBA Governor Lowe, at the A50 Australian Economic Forum in Sydney on Thursday. A lengthy period of masterly inactivity has characterised interest rate settings. The last rate change was in August 2016. And newish RBA Governor Lowe is the only incumbent not to have changed rates in his first year in office. This track record should remain intact after the first Board meeting for 2018. The cash rate should remain firmly fixed at the record low of 1&frac12;%. The Board discussion will no doubt include: the recent upward revision to global growth forecasts by organisations such as the IMF and the World Bank; the stimulus from the Trump tax package; the ongoing resilience of key commodity prices; the surprising strength in the AUD (or should it be surprising weakness in the USD?); the turn towards rate rises in some major central banks (which the RBA was quick to emphasise has no automatic implications for monetary settings in Australia); the tendency for recent Australian data to surprise on the upside; a labour market that has now delivered an equal-record run of continuous job&rsquo;s growth (15 months); an unemployment rate not far off the 5% level that the RBA has nominated as full employment; improvements in business and consumer sentiment; the cooling housing market; upward revisions by the ABS to the level of household debt; and the absence of any real inflation pressures. Any Board member running their eye down this checklist would probably agree that the next move in interest rates is up. But they would also agree that there was no urgency to act. The Q4 CPI readings reinforced the point. The range of underlying or core measures printed below the bottom end of the RBA&rsquo;s 2-3% target band (again). The average of the various measures shows that the inflation rate has undershot the target for eight quarters. An analysis of the CPI basket shows prices of some 70% of items were growing at below 2%pa. Until fairly recently, such an outcome would have the debate on rate cuts hotting up and financial markets pricing for those cuts. But the residual case for another rate cut was pretty much gone by the start of 2017. It was apparent that growth prospects were OK, deflation risks were receding and the housing market was not cooling to the extent expected. By the end of 2017 the RBA&rsquo;s focus had clearly shifted towards a normalising economy. In fact, the RBA spent a fair amount of time in 2017 defining what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; meant for a selection of key economic indicators. Benchmarking the current economy against these normal parameters shows activity-type indicators closing in on normal. But inflation indicators still some way off. We expect the gap to close further during 2018 and as the economy normalises the case for normalising policy settings strengthens as well. One indicator to watch will be underemployment. Trends in this measure of labour market slack are important for the direction of wages and, ultimately, prices. The importance of underemployment is evident as well in its correlation with the RBA&rsquo;s cash rate. The currency also matters. The RBA has been relatively vocal on AUD trends and implications in recent years. Two things stand out about the RBA rhetoric on the AUD: concerns are most prominent when the AUD has diverged from the underlying fundamentals; and concerns are typically dialled down when the AUD moves into a USD0.70-0.75 band. We suspect the RBA is &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; with the Aussie in a USD0.70-0.75 range. Our forecasts have the AUD above the RBA&rsquo;s comfort zone in 2018. From a policy perspective this should mean that the RBA will prefer to lag any global tightening cycle. The hope would be to take the benefit in a currency that was lower than otherwise would be the case. We expect to see the start of a modest rate rise cycle on Melbourne Cup day. The increased sensitivity of households to changing interest rates will also influence the policy process. It should mean a drawn out rate rise cycle that peaks short of the 3&frac12;% neutral rate nominated by the RBA. We put the cash rate peak for this cycle at 2&frac12;% and don&rsquo;t expect to get there until early 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NAB:</strong> While markets were not expecting the RBA to change its cash rate at Tuesday&rsquo;s board meeting, Wednesday&rsquo;s unsurprising CPI print, and the unemployment rate remaining elevated in December, has cemented that belief. What will be keenly watched is whether any other developments will change the RBA&rsquo;s view on the economy and policy going forward. As such, markets will be pouring over changes in the decision statement, Governor Phil Lowe&rsquo;s speech on Thursday, and the Statement of Monetary Policy (SoMP) on Friday, which include updated forecasts. The Governor&rsquo;s speech will probably not be market moving given the audience and the SoMP the next day. In its last SoMP, the RBA indicated ongoing uncertainty about the degree of slack in the labour market, inflation and consumption. While recent labour market data confirms strong employment growth over 2017 (+400 jobs!), unemployment has remained stubbornly elevated, at 5.5%. This rate is above the RBA&rsquo;s estimate of the NAIRIU, and is indicative of ongoing slack in the market. However, should participation rate stabilise, the unemployment rate would begin to fall, something we are looking for to occur in the coming months. The recent core inflation print of 0.4% q/q for the December quarter, brought trimmed mean inflation to 1.8%. While this number remains below the lower edge of the RBA&rsquo;s target of 2-3%, the RBA&rsquo;s forecasts show that the print was broadly expected by the Bank, and unlikely to significantly change the RBA&rsquo;s outlook. Inflation has stabilised and is gradually trending towards the RBA&rsquo;s target. As further strengthening in the labour market occurs, we expect inflation to rise to be comfortably back within the band over the medium term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Westpac:</strong> The RBA left interest rates unchanged throughout calendar 2017, Governor Lowe noting in his final speech of the year that: &quot;the continuing spare capacity in the economy and the subdued outlook for inflation mean that there is not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy&quot;. We expect the RBA to leave rates unchanged at its Feb meeting. Developments over the summer hiatus have been mixed with the Q3 national accounts disappointing but more positive news around global conditions, labour markets and confidence. Inflation remains subdued, with latest figures showing core inflation running at a 1.6% annual pace over the second half of 2017. There is also no new information around the Bank&#39;s key areas of uncertainty &ndash; the impact of lacklustre consumer demand; the extent to which weak labour income growth continues; and the risks around household debt. We expect consumer weakness to persist in 2018, leading the RBA to again leave rates on hold all year. We expect a 0.4% rise in the private sector Labour Cost Index for the December quarter. Wage growth has been running at the same quarterly pace for the last couple of years, aside from the 0.7% rise last quarter, which included the equal pay settlement for aged and disability care workers. We have no evidence to suggest there was a stirring of wage pressures in the December quarter. Indeed, the latest Westpac&ndash;McDermott Miller employment confidence survey found fewer workers reporting a rise in earnings over the last year. The Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) suggests a stronger rate of growth in hourly earnings. However, this measure is affected by changes in the composition of jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Barclays</strong>: For the RBA cash rate, after a brief hiatus in January, we expect the central bank to take its cues from the inflation print and ongoing strength in the labour market, amid improving signs of consumption, to emphasise that the economic recovery remains on track</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HSBC:</strong> The RBA has, so far, been patient about waiting to see clear signs that wages growth is lifting before it considers raising its cash rate. We expect this to continue for the time being. We see the RBA as unlikely to change its domestic forecasts when they are published next week. The tone of the RBA&rsquo;s approach is likely to be similar to that conveyed by the Governor in a speech in November 2017 when he stated that &lsquo;if the economy continues to improve as expected, it is more likely that the next move in interest rates will be up, rather than down ... [but] ... the subdued outlook for inflation means that there is not a strong case for a near-term policy adjustment&rsquo;. On the positive side, the RBA is expected to point to the ongoing improvement in global economic conditions, which is supporting commodity prices, Australian exports and may filter through to local business investment. On the downside, the RBA is expected to point out that the recent lift in the AUD may be somewhat unhelpful for the growth and inflation outlook, although we do not think it will tangibly affect the RBA&rsquo;s central forecasts. Importantly, another factor that is likely to support the RBA&rsquo;s patient approach to lift-off is that the housing market has continued show signs of cooling over recent months On the margin, this may allow the RBA to be even more patient about lifting its cash rate from its current historically low level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBC:</strong> This is the first board meeting for 2018 following the usual January hiatus. There are three key developments since the board last met in early December. Firstly, global activity data continue to highlight momentum, with G7 central banks continuing to shift toward the removal of policy accommodation. Secondly, domestic employment data and key business surveys have been strong although inflation remains modest. Thirdly, AUD/USD has appreciated by ~6.5% and ~3.5% on a TWI basis. On balance, these developments point to upbeat and positive communication from the RBA next week, in line with the global central bank rhetoric, although there may be some caution around the currency. We expect no substantial changes to the key macro forecasts, which should continue to assume an eventual return to above-trend growth and within target inflation. In itself, however, this is noteworthy given the constant downward revisions to overly optimistic growth forecasts. No change to GDP forecasts would be a positive development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SocGen:</strong> Contained inflation and a relatively strong exchange rate suggest that there is little reason for the RBA to adjust the exceptionally accommodative policy stance in the near future. However, with prospects of solid growth at home and abroad &ndash; and an exceptionally strong labour market &ndash; the case for maintaining a policy rate that is negative in real terms is becoming progressively weaker. We therefore maintain the view that by the second half of next year the RBA too will begin to normalise its policy stance.</p>\r\n",

He also noted that he is of the view that the Fed doesn&rsquo;t have far to go until it reaches neutral policy, as it isn&rsquo;t providing that much accommodation at present (cites 50-75bps). He also suggested that stock valuations are on the high end, but it is too far early to say a bubble has formed &amp; noted that the USD could create inflationary pressures.

These gains proved to be fleeting, as stocks moved sharply lower, registering fresh intra-day lows as we moved through the US afternoon, with the S&amp;P500 and Dow crossing below some psychological levels. The Dow briefly moved into correction territory as US indices experienced choppy trading conditions with sell programmes pushing the space lower, but we now closed well off of session lows as we recovered on low volume. Financials underperformed following the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s sanctions on Wells Fargo (WFC), and the lower yield environment on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is worth noting that Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s quantitative analysts suggested that a close below 2700 for the S&amp;P 500 will trigger an additional USD 70bn more in sell-side flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s volatility saw the heavily-watched VIX (fear index) spike above 30, printing highs around 36 after we traded below 20 in the early part of the session on a day that the White House noted that it is monitoring the stock market sell off, but did express confidence in US economic fundamentals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREASURIES: US T-Note Futures settled up 17 ticks at 121.08+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries moved higher through the US session as the risk off tone filtered through, with the space pushing on to fresh session highs in late US dealing on the back of block buyers entering the 2-year note futures and sell side flow in equities, although we pulled back from best levels as equities moved away from session lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, the US Treasury will sell $68bln of new 3s ($28bln, Tuesday), new 10s ($24bln, Wednesday), and new 30s ($16bln, Thursday). With $46.6bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is seen at $21.4bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month&rsquo;s series of auctions comes at a key inflection point, with bonds selling-off aggressively at the beginning of the year. The 10-year note, for instance, has added c.40bps in 2018, a trend exacerbated by strong US data and hints that the Fed may lift rates more aggressively than anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week&rsquo;s auctions will likely give some indication whether the bond rout has further to run, or whether we will find some short-term stabilisation, analysts have said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s President Draghi said that the ECB remains fully committed to its price stability objective; monetary policy will continue to be guided by our assessment of the progress made towards our objective. He also stressed monetary policy will evolve in a fully data-dependent and time-consistent manner. He also noted that the ECB can be more confident about the path of inflation, although patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy is still warranted for underlying inflation pressures to build up and inflation to converge durably towards objective. He also made fresh comments on the currency stating that new headwinds have arisen from the recent volatility in the exchange rate, with implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability require close monitoring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports suggested that the CDU, CSU and SPD parties will not complete talks for a coalition government until Tuesday at the earliest, and the negotiators debated over healthcare and labour issues.

The DXY is inching towards 89.500 after a wobble and test of big figure support around 89.000, with some upward momentum noted after newly sworn in Fed chair Powell pledged to maintain policies that will promote growth and price stability, while ensuring that financial stability is monitored closely. The Greenback has only lost out to 2 of its G10 rivals and even then pared declines vs the Jpy and Aud to 110.00+ and 0.7925 respectively from circa 109.65 and 0.7950 at one stage. The former pair remains capped by offers ahead of the 110.37 Fib and more supply at 110.50, and with the Jpy also benefiting from safe-haven demand amidst ongoing stock market weakness, while attention down under now switches to the RBA overnight (unchanged rates forecast, but guidance and SOMP key for further direction). Cable lost grip of the 1.4000 handle at one stage amidst more speculation about plots to oust PM May, with 1.3980 support next on the radar for Gbp bears, while Eur/Usd breached its 10 DMA at 1.2418 to expose 1.2400 ahead of ECB President Draghi. Usd/Cad continued to bounce from mid-1.2200 lows and stopped just shy of 1.2500, with the Loonie not helped by negative NAFTA vibes. Usd/Chf also rebounded further from its 2018 base, and above 0.9350 as the Dollar go an extra boost from a stronger than expected US services ISM survey.

        "content": "<p>PREVIEW: Reserve Bank Of Australia Monetary Policy Decision Preview, Due On Tuesday 6<sup>th</sup> February 2018 At 03:30 GMT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will issue its first monetary policy decision of 2018 on Tuesday following a 2-month hiatus. Consensus looks for the central bank to keep its Cash Rate target unchanged at the record low of 1.50%, where it has stood since mid-2016, with only one of those surveyed by Reuters looking for a hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is reflected in ASX 30-Day interbank cash rate futures which have fully priced in no change this time out, while the OIS curve indicates little chance of any rate adjustments until November at the earliest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some analysts have also begun pushing back expectations for when the RBA will start lifting rates, following a bout of softer than expected data. This includes Q4 CPI in which the headline printed at 1.9% Y/Y vs. Exp. 2.0% (Prev. 1.8%), while the RBA&#39;s preferred trimmed mean reading stood at 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.9% (Prev. 1.8%), both below the central bank&#39;s 2%-3% target range, therefore restricting scope for tighter policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the latest building approvals data showed a significant contraction in December and although the employment change surpassed estimates in the labour market report from the same month, which was accompanied by an unexpected rise in the unemployment rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of rhetoric, there hasn&#39;t been much from the central bank since the most recent meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his final address of 2017 RBA Governor Philip Lowe noted that &ldquo;the continuing spare capacity in the economy and the subdued outlook for inflation mean that there is not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Board member Harper stated that there was a chance that the unemployment rate needs to fall below 5% before wages and inflation can respond accordingly, while he added that the current economic situation merits rates remaining supportive of the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, notorious RBA watcher McCrann has stated that the RBA will keep rates unchanged this week and indicated that it has no intention of changing rates, while he also pointed to stable inflation adding to the case for steady rates.<br /><br />With expectations for no change focus will turn to the accompanying statement for clues of future policy as any bias in its tone could impact AUD accordingly. Participants will also be eyeing any significant jawboning of the currency given its strength against the greenback which saw AUD/USD trade above 0.8100 in late January vs. the present 0.7600 at the last rate decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus will then move to Governor Lowe&rsquo;s speech on Thursday (09:00 GMT), and then onto the Bank&rsquo;s quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy on Friday (00:30 GMT).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the bank desks are saying: -</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ANZ:</strong> The coming week is very much about the RBA. Not only do we have the monthly Board meeting on Tuesday, but we also get the RBA&rsquo;s quarterly forecast update and policy statement on Friday, and the Governor is giving a speech on Thursday evening. All of which provides the RBA with plenty of opportunity to update its view. While the cash rate will remain on hold, we think the tone of the RBA commentary will be more upbeat after a positive run of data both domestically and globally. The higher AUD provides a bit of an offset and may see some refinement to the RBA&rsquo;s commentary around the currency, but its move in trade weighted terms since November is minimal and commodity prices are stronger so we don&rsquo;t think there will be that much concern about the impact of the higher AUD/USD. In terms of the RBA&rsquo;s forecasts the one substantive change we are looking for is a lower unemployment forecast. We think it is likely that the Bank will reduce the 2018 year-end forecast from 51&frasl;2% to 51&frasl;4% and predict 5% by the end of the forecast period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CBA:</strong> Australian central bankers return from holidays this week with the first Board meeting of the year on Tuesday and the next Statement on Monetary Policy (SMP) on Friday. There is also a speech by RBA Governor Lowe, at the A50 Australian Economic Forum in Sydney on Thursday. A lengthy period of masterly inactivity has characterised interest rate settings. The last rate change was in August 2016. And newish RBA Governor Lowe is the only incumbent not to have changed rates in his first year in office. This track record should remain intact after the first Board meeting for 2018. The cash rate should remain firmly fixed at the record low of 1&frac12;%. The Board discussion will no doubt include: the recent upward revision to global growth forecasts by organisations such as the IMF and the World Bank; the stimulus from the Trump tax package; the ongoing resilience of key commodity prices; the surprising strength in the AUD (or should it be surprising weakness in the USD?); the turn towards rate rises in some major central banks (which the RBA was quick to emphasise has no automatic implications for monetary settings in Australia); the tendency for recent Australian data to surprise on the upside; a labour market that has now delivered an equal-record run of continuous job&rsquo;s growth (15 months); an unemployment rate not far off the 5% level that the RBA has nominated as full employment; improvements in business and consumer sentiment; the cooling housing market; upward revisions by the ABS to the level of household debt; and the absence of any real inflation pressures. Any Board member running their eye down this checklist would probably agree that the next move in interest rates is up. But they would also agree that there was no urgency to act. The Q4 CPI readings reinforced the point. The range of underlying or core measures printed below the bottom end of the RBA&rsquo;s 2-3% target band (again). The average of the various measures shows that the inflation rate has undershot the target for eight quarters. An analysis of the CPI basket shows prices of some 70% of items were growing at below 2%pa. Until fairly recently, such an outcome would have the debate on rate cuts hotting up and financial markets pricing for those cuts. But the residual case for another rate cut was pretty much gone by the start of 2017. It was apparent that growth prospects were OK, deflation risks were receding and the housing market was not cooling to the extent expected. By the end of 2017 the RBA&rsquo;s focus had clearly shifted towards a normalising economy. In fact, the RBA spent a fair amount of time in 2017 defining what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; meant for a selection of key economic indicators. Benchmarking the current economy against these normal parameters shows activity-type indicators closing in on normal. But inflation indicators still some way off. We expect the gap to close further during 2018 and as the economy normalises the case for normalising policy settings strengthens as well. One indicator to watch will be underemployment. Trends in this measure of labour market slack are important for the direction of wages and, ultimately, prices. The importance of underemployment is evident as well in its correlation with the RBA&rsquo;s cash rate. The currency also matters. The RBA has been relatively vocal on AUD trends and implications in recent years. Two things stand out about the RBA rhetoric on the AUD: concerns are most prominent when the AUD has diverged from the underlying fundamentals; and concerns are typically dialled down when the AUD moves into a USD0.70-0.75 band. We suspect the RBA is &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; with the Aussie in a USD0.70-0.75 range. Our forecasts have the AUD above the RBA&rsquo;s comfort zone in 2018. From a policy perspective this should mean that the RBA will prefer to lag any global tightening cycle. The hope would be to take the benefit in a currency that was lower than otherwise would be the case. We expect to see the start of a modest rate rise cycle on Melbourne Cup day. The increased sensitivity of households to changing interest rates will also influence the policy process. It should mean a drawn out rate rise cycle that peaks short of the 3&frac12;% neutral rate nominated by the RBA. We put the cash rate peak for this cycle at 2&frac12;% and don&rsquo;t expect to get there until early 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NAB:</strong> While markets were not expecting the RBA to change its cash rate at Tuesday&rsquo;s board meeting, Wednesday&rsquo;s unsurprising CPI print, and the unemployment rate remaining elevated in December, has cemented that belief. What will be keenly watched is whether any other developments will change the RBA&rsquo;s view on the economy and policy going forward. As such, markets will be pouring over changes in the decision statement, Governor Phil Lowe&rsquo;s speech on Thursday, and the Statement of Monetary Policy (SoMP) on Friday, which include updated forecasts. The Governor&rsquo;s speech will probably not be market moving given the audience and the SoMP the next day. In its last SoMP, the RBA indicated ongoing uncertainty about the degree of slack in the labour market, inflation and consumption. While recent labour market data confirms strong employment growth over 2017 (+400 jobs!), unemployment has remained stubbornly elevated, at 5.5%. This rate is above the RBA&rsquo;s estimate of the NAIRIU, and is indicative of ongoing slack in the market. However, should participation rate stabilise, the unemployment rate would begin to fall, something we are looking for to occur in the coming months. The recent core inflation print of 0.4% q/q for the December quarter, brought trimmed mean inflation to 1.8%. While this number remains below the lower edge of the RBA&rsquo;s target of 2-3%, the RBA&rsquo;s forecasts show that the print was broadly expected by the Bank, and unlikely to significantly change the RBA&rsquo;s outlook. Inflation has stabilised and is gradually trending towards the RBA&rsquo;s target. As further strengthening in the labour market occurs, we expect inflation to rise to be comfortably back within the band over the medium term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Westpac:</strong> The RBA left interest rates unchanged throughout calendar 2017, Governor Lowe noting in his final speech of the year that: &quot;the continuing spare capacity in the economy and the subdued outlook for inflation mean that there is not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy&quot;. We expect the RBA to leave rates unchanged at its Feb meeting. Developments over the summer hiatus have been mixed with the Q3 national accounts disappointing but more positive news around global conditions, labour markets and confidence. Inflation remains subdued, with latest figures showing core inflation running at a 1.6% annual pace over the second half of 2017. There is also no new information around the Bank&#39;s key areas of uncertainty &ndash; the impact of lacklustre consumer demand; the extent to which weak labour income growth continues; and the risks around household debt. We expect consumer weakness to persist in 2018, leading the RBA to again leave rates on hold all year. We expect a 0.4% rise in the private sector Labour Cost Index for the December quarter. Wage growth has been running at the same quarterly pace for the last couple of years, aside from the 0.7% rise last quarter, which included the equal pay settlement for aged and disability care workers. We have no evidence to suggest there was a stirring of wage pressures in the December quarter. Indeed, the latest Westpac&ndash;McDermott Miller employment confidence survey found fewer workers reporting a rise in earnings over the last year. The Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) suggests a stronger rate of growth in hourly earnings. However, this measure is affected by changes in the composition of jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Barclays</strong>: For the RBA cash rate, after a brief hiatus in January, we expect the central bank to take its cues from the inflation print and ongoing strength in the labour market, amid improving signs of consumption, to emphasise that the economic recovery remains on track</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HSBC:</strong> The RBA has, so far, been patient about waiting to see clear signs that wages growth is lifting before it considers raising its cash rate. We expect this to continue for the time being. We see the RBA as unlikely to change its domestic forecasts when they are published next week. The tone of the RBA&rsquo;s approach is likely to be similar to that conveyed by the Governor in a speech in November 2017 when he stated that &lsquo;if the economy continues to improve as expected, it is more likely that the next move in interest rates will be up, rather than down ... [but] ... the subdued outlook for inflation means that there is not a strong case for a near-term policy adjustment&rsquo;. On the positive side, the RBA is expected to point to the ongoing improvement in global economic conditions, which is supporting commodity prices, Australian exports and may filter through to local business investment. On the downside, the RBA is expected to point out that the recent lift in the AUD may be somewhat unhelpful for the growth and inflation outlook, although we do not think it will tangibly affect the RBA&rsquo;s central forecasts. Importantly, another factor that is likely to support the RBA&rsquo;s patient approach to lift-off is that the housing market has continued show signs of cooling over recent months On the margin, this may allow the RBA to be even more patient about lifting its cash rate from its current historically low level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBC:</strong> This is the first board meeting for 2018 following the usual January hiatus. There are three key developments since the board last met in early December. Firstly, global activity data continue to highlight momentum, with G7 central banks continuing to shift toward the removal of policy accommodation. Secondly, domestic employment data and key business surveys have been strong although inflation remains modest. Thirdly, AUD/USD has appreciated by ~6.5% and ~3.5% on a TWI basis. On balance, these developments point to upbeat and positive communication from the RBA next week, in line with the global central bank rhetoric, although there may be some caution around the currency. We expect no substantial changes to the key macro forecasts, which should continue to assume an eventual return to above-trend growth and within target inflation. In itself, however, this is noteworthy given the constant downward revisions to overly optimistic growth forecasts. No change to GDP forecasts would be a positive development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SocGen:</strong> Contained inflation and a relatively strong exchange rate suggest that there is little reason for the RBA to adjust the exceptionally accommodative policy stance in the near future. However, with prospects of solid growth at home and abroad &ndash; and an exceptionally strong labour market &ndash; the case for maintaining a policy rate that is negative in real terms is becoming progressively weaker. We therefore maintain the view that by the second half of next year the RBA too will begin to normalise its policy stance.</p>\r\n",

With USD 46.6bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, net supply is seen at USD 21.4bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month&rsquo;s series of auctions comes at a key inflection point, with bonds selling-off aggressively at the beginning of the year. The 10-year note, for instance, has added c.40bps in 2018, a trend exacerbated by strong US data and hints that the Fed may lift rates more aggressively than anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This week&#39;s UST auctions should show whether there&#39;s any appetite to buy the dip,&rdquo; analysts at UBS write, &ldquo;but most fixed income rallies this year have been dead cat bounces, any uptick being seen as another selling opportunity.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UBS believes that if the auctions are digested well, it could signal that the worst is over for the fixed income complex, and looks to upcoming Fed commentary this week for any indications of whether voting officials see the sell-off as justified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(NOTE: This week&rsquo;s Fedspeak includes Bullard (non-voter) on Tuesday; Kaplan (non-voter), Evans (non-voter), Williams (voter) and Dudley (voter) on Wednesday; Harker (non-voter), Kashkari (non-voter) on Thursday; George (non-voter) on Friday.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the last auction series, the 3-year sector has cheapened on an outright basis and on the curve on the back of a hawkish repricing of the Fed&rsquo;s hike trajectory, as well as the US Treasury announcing increased auction sizes last week at its Quarterly Refunding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TD Securities notes that last month&rsquo;s 3-year auction saw solid demand, and cover above recent averages. Dealer take down was in line with recent averages, while directs took a slightly higher allocation, and indirects took a slightly lower allocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest positioning data (w/e 24 January) shows dealers have trimmed their long position sin the <2yrs sector to the lowest since early December, to USD 26bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The 3-year note appears to be trading slightly cheap on Treasury spline versus the off-the-run 3s compared with the previous two auction cycles,&rdquo; Societe Generale writes, &ldquo;the 3-year note is cheap on the fly with 2s3s5s, hitting -8.9bp last week, the highest level since December 2015, and it is currently trading at around the same value.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SocGen holds a positive bias going into the auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3-YEAR AUCTION HISTORY (JANUARY AUCTION VS SIX-AUCTION AVERAGE):</strong><br />- High-yield: 2.08% (vs six-auction average of 1.729%)<br />- Tail: Stopped through 0.7bps (vs six-auction average stop-through of 0.1bps)<br />- Bid-to-cover: 3.13x (vs six-auction average of 2.95x)<br />- Dealers: 33.6% (vs six-auction average of 34.9%)<br />- Directs: 11.5% (vs six-auction average of 9.3%)</p>\r\n",

Nothing specific to drive bonds in different directions, although the UK benchmark did miss out on some of the post-NFP selling due to the earlier close and BoE policy is more aligned to the Fed than the ECB. On that note, Governor Carney has been a bit more hawkish on the inflation outlook ahead of this week&rsquo;s meeting that culminates on super Thursday with the latest QIR and some economists are now predicting 2 hikes this year, though the Short Sterling strip is 1-2 ticks firmer from Sep18 out.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-2.6%) opened with firm losses amid a continued rout in US equity futures, while mining and oil-related sectors were the worst performers following weakness in the commodities complex. Hang Seng (-1.1%) conformed to the downbeat tone with notable pressure in the energy giants, while Macau gambling stocks also racked up losses on competition concerns after reports that China is drafting a proposal to permit gambling on Hainan Island. Conversely, Shanghai Comp (+0.7%) pared opening losses and outperformed the region after encouraging Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI data releases, in which the former posted its highest since May 2012. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat and held on to Friday&rsquo;s BoJ-induced gains, with only brief support seen amid a wide-spread risk-averse tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Services PMI (Jan) 54.7 vs. Exp. 53.5 (Prev. 53.9); highest since May 2012. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Composite PMI (Jan) 53.7 (Prev. 53.0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations again today. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3019 (Prev. 6.2885).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May will face a coup that would install Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Michael Gove if she persists with plans to keep Britain in a customs union with the European Union, Tory MPs warned. (Sunday Times) Downing Street has since ruled out joining a customs union with the EU. (The Guardian) &nbsp;EU and UK said to seek quick Brexit agreement on defence and security. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates twice this year after a surprisingly strong showing from the economy at the end of last year and a brightening outlook in 2018, leading economists say. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany&#39;s CDU, CSU, and SPD want to present a coalition agreement by Tuesday. (Rheinische Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports stated that Italian election polls could be downplaying possibility that centre-right coalition backed by Berlusconi could be closer to a majority victory at election next month.

In terms of sector specifics, losses have been relatively broad-based thus far with all ten sectors in the red. Airline names have been suffering this morning with RyanAir (-3%) softer in the wake of a disappointing earnings update, subsequently dragging easyJet (-2.3%) lower. Deutsche Lufthansa (-1.6%) were seen lower at the open amid reports that German coalition negotiators could drop proposal to abolish air transport tax. Elsewhere, markets will be looking out for any follow up to Friday&rsquo;s reports that US regulators are seeking major fines for Fiat Chrysler as part of its motor settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wells Fargo (WFC) &ndash; The Federal Reserve has sanctioned the bank after the fake accounts scandal. Wells Fargo said it could reduce profits by as much as USD 400mln this year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broadcom (AVGO)/Qualcomm (QCOM) &ndash; Broadcom is set to raise its bid for Qualcomm to about USD 145bln or USD 80/share, according to sources. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar index has consolidated post-NFP recovery gains above the 89.000 level, despite losing some ground against the traditional safe-haven currencies amidst the ongoing pull-back in global equities (in part triggered by higher bond yields and Fed tightening perceptions in wake of Friday&rsquo;s US jobs report). Eur/Usd is back down around 1.2450 vs last week&rsquo;s 1.2500+ peaks, as specs increased long positions yet again (to fresh record highs), while Cable is pivoting around 1.4100 amidst more UK/Brexit-related claims and denials (latest concerning a plot against PM May on EU customs union issues). Usd/Cad has rebounded above 1.2400 with the Loonie undermined by reports that Canada could walk away from NAFTA, while Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are both sitting just above recent lows and round numbers (0.7900 and 0.7300) awaiting this week&rsquo;s RBA and RBNZ policy meetings). Conversely, Usd/Jpy has retreated from Friday&rsquo;s US labour data inspired highs and back below 110.00, with resistance seen ahead of the 110.37 Fib (38.2%) and 110.50 offers, but 109.79 and 109.83 MAs (ascending 55 hourly and descending 100 weekly respectively) providing support. Usd/Chf is hovering just under 0.9300 within a tight range up to around 0.9325.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10 year German debt future has rebounded further from earlier Eurex lows to reclaim the 158.00 level and a bit more (158.23 high, +36 ticks vs -1/4 point at one stage), shrugging off mostly better than anticipated Eurozone services PMIs and instead drawing momentum from the sell-off in stock markets. Some bond analysts/observers are also pointing to a certain amount of chart gap filling after the collapse in wake of Friday&rsquo;s NFP release and on that note there is another void in the 158.33-36 area before a 50% retracement target from last week at 158.48. Still lagging behind, but also striving to tag along, Gilts just climbed to 121.46 (+12 ticks vs -10 ticks at the Liffe base) with a modest additional shove from the UK services PMI miss. US Treasuries are narrowly mixed either side of par and with the curve still steeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures have pared earlier losses after hitting a one-month low in early European trade. Friday&rsquo;s rig count saw oil drillers add rigs for the second consecutive week, a sign that US oil production could soon exceed 10mln bpd. The Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh stated that OPEC&rsquo;s step to push up oil prices is short-lived and that any country that builds oil output capacity will ultimately win, while he also suggested to wait until the June meeting for a decision regarding an extension of cuts. In metals markets, spot gold trades higher, benefiting from its safe-haven status, albeit gains are relatively modest thus far with reports suggesting that Indian gold imports fell to a 17-month low in Jan. Elsewhere, Chinese steel futures were seen lower in quiet trading conditions while nickel prices in London have recovered from recent losses.</p>\r\n",

Conversely, USD/JPY has retreated from Friday&rsquo;s US labour data inspired highs and back below 110.00, with resistance seen ahead of the 110.37 Fib (38.2%) and 110.50 offers, but 109.79 and 109.83 MAs (ascending 55 hourly and descending 100 weekly respectively) providing support. USD/CHF is hovering just under 0.9300 within a tight range up to around 0.9325.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10 year German debt future has rebounded further from earlier Eurex lows to reclaim the 158.00 level and a bit more (158.23 high, +36 ticks vs -1/4 point at one stage), shrugging off mostly better than anticipated Eurozone services PMIs and instead drawing momentum from the sell-off in stock markets. Some bond analysts/observers are also pointing to a certain amount of chart gap filling after the collapse in wake of Friday&rsquo;s NFP release and on that note there is another void in the 158.33-36 area before a 50% retracement target from last week at 158.48. Still lagging behind, but also striving to tag along, Gilts just climbed to 121.46 (+12 ticks vs -10 ticks at the Liffe base) with a modest additional shove from the UK services PMI miss. US Treasuries are narrowly mixed either side of par and with the curve still steeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, WTI and Brent crude futures trade lower and around the USD 65/bbl and USD 68/bbl levels respectively as global risk sentiment keeps a cap on prices and Friday&rsquo;s Baker Hughes rig count saw a climb in oil rigs from 759 to 765. Elsewhere in energy newsflow, the Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh stated that OPEC&rsquo;s step to push up oil prices is short-lived and that any country that builds oil output capacity will ultimately win, while he also suggested to wait until the June meeting for a decision regarding an extension of cuts. In metals markets, spot gold trades higher, benefiting from its safe-haven status, albeit gains are relatively modest thus far with reports suggesting that Indian gold imports fell to a 17-month low in Jan. Elsewhere, Chinese steel futures were seen lower in quiet trading conditions while nickel prices in London have recovered from recent losses.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>A bloodbath is seen across equity markets in Asia trade with most major bourses suffering deep losses after Friday&rsquo;s slump on Wall St, where stocks failed to benefit from the better than expected NFP jobs data and sold-off on the bond market weakness. ASX 200 (-1.7%) and Nikkei 225 (-2.8%) opened with firm losses as US equity futures continued to tumble in early trade, while mining and oil-related sectors are the worst performers following weakness in the commodities complex. Hang Seng (-2.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) conform to the downbeat tone with notable pressure in the energy giants, while Macau gambling stocks are also racking up losses on competition concerns after reports that China is drafting a proposal to permit gambling on Hainan Island. However, the losses in Shanghai are somewhat contained by encouraging Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI data releases, in which the former posted its highest since May 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, price action has been relatively muted with most major currencies languishing after Friday&rsquo;s post-NFP losses against the greenback. As such, GBP/USD is flat but briefly tested a breakdown of the 1.4100 handle amid further reports of Brexit-bickering as Conservative MPs were said to warn that UK PM May will face a coup that would install a &ldquo;dream team&rdquo; of &ldquo;three Brexiteers&rdquo; if she persists with plans to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU, which in turn prompted Downing Street to rule out a customs union. Elsewhere, the risk-averse tone has spurred further flows into safe-haven JPY, while AUD/USD attempts to nurse some losses after having found support at the 0.7900 level and as participants digest the strong Chinese PMI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher with prices extending on Friday&rsquo;s BoJ-induced support, and amid a wide-spread risk-averse tone.</p>\r\n",
