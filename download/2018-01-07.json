Equities fell, though were more resilient, paring back the knee-jerk losses post the data release. While the headline was a miss, the average hourly earnings data were in line with expectations, and do little to shift the Fed hike narrative. Indeed, many analysts expect that, as the US makes further ground in full-employment territory, headline payroll growth will slow, and many think that as that happens, wage pressures will be stoked.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fedspeak:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Mester (Voter, Hawk) said she would be happy with three/four hikes in 2018 (the FOMC&rsquo;s &lsquo;dots&rsquo; look for three hikes). She was encouraged by the &ldquo;strong&rdquo; US Employment Situation Report for December, and argued that the economic expansion was firmly in place. Mester sees inflation rising to target in 2019. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Williams (Voter, Neutral) said Fed should raise interest rates three times this year as the already strong economy will be further boosted from tax cuts. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Harker (Non-Voter, Soft Hawk) said that two rate hikes would be appropriate in 2018 and cited the lack of wages pressure as a reason for his caution. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Bullard (Non-Voter, Dove) repeated his recent view that the Fed should &#39;wait and see&#39; regarding further rate hikes and argued that the central bank has made no progress towards inflation since 2015. (Newswires)<br /><br />White House Chief Economist Hassett stated that the Fed would not need to tighten policy at a quicker pace in response to the recent tax reductions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX +0.7% at 2,742; DJIA +0.8% at 25,284; NDX +1.0% at 6,550</strong><br />- Top performing sectors: IT +1.1%, Healthcare +0.9%, Materials +0.8%<br />- Bottom performing sectors: Energy -0.1%, Utilities 0.0%, Telecoms 0.0%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity traders were happy to look through the headline weakness in the Employment Situation Report, with S&amp;P 500 eminis finishing positive every day this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tech lead the advance. Energy lagged, however, tracking crude prices, after traders took profits on the black stuff following the recent rally in prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is expected that trade may pick up next week as earnings season gets underway, and the big banks begin reporting their numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>TREASURIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US 10-Year T-Note Futures settled 5 ticks lower at 123-16+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury yields were on Friday, with the curve mildly bear-steepening. Despite headline payrolls disappointing, the wages data continue to point to growth, albeit at a subdued rate when compared to previous recoveries. The data did little to suggest the Fed will alter course, and in combination with optimism about the impact of tax reform, traders were content to end the week selling Treasuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Friday, the probability of a January hike remained beneath 1%: the chance of March hike were at 80%, the chance of seeing two <a name=\"_Hlk503123964\">hikes by June is around 50/50, and there is around 30% chance of three hikes by the end of the year, according to the CME&rsquo;s Fedwatch tool. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><br /><strong>ASIA-PAC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese FX Reserves (USD)(Dec ) 3.140tln vs. Exp. 3.130tln (Prev. 3.119tln). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Auckland house prices saw the softest increase in 5 years, according to Barfoot &amp; Thompson. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>EU/UK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is expected to conduct a cabinet reshuffle which would affect a quarter of her cabinet on Monday, according to press reports. Furthermore, it was also reported that PM May is to appoint a cabinet minister for no deal Brexit in the reshuffle. (Guardian/Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Chancellor Merkel stated that she thinks they can manage to form a coalition. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann said that the ECB should set a date to end its asset purchase program. (El Mundo)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the DXY was modestly up on the Friday, the dollar index was more-or-less unchanged in the week. The buck saw heavy losses against the CAD following an NFP miss in combination with a stellar Canadian employment report, sending USDCAD crashing through 1.25 to lows near 1.2360 before recovering to 1.24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Eurozone CPI reported for December was in line with expectations, falling 0.1ppts to 1.4%, as expected; the core rate was unchanged at 0.9%. There was little market reaction. The single currency jumped towards 1.2085 following the US payrolls miss, though the gains were pared back as traders digested the data. Either way, the key 1.20 handle remains the focus, with the EUR consolidating above the level in the first week of 2018 trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Safe havens were red on Friday, with the yen and Swissy down against most of the majors, while gold was slightly negative, settling around the $1320 mark. Firm equities, negative Treasuries, and a resilient risk tone helped to buoy the EMFX complex slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pound was uneventful on Friday; in thin news, the 1.36 handle is in focus to the top side, though sterling seems to have been more driven by USD factors this week. Against the EUR, the pound did carve out gains. The next catalysts may come via next week&rsquo;s industrial and manufacturing production data, though traders will be on the look-out for Brexit-related newsflow over the weekend following comments from the EU&rsquo;s Juncker, who was quoted as saying that Brexit talks will be &lsquo;exceptionally difficult&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 57 cents lower at $61.44 per barrel; Brent future settle 45 cents lower at USD 67.62 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI closed red for the first time in six sessions, with profit-taking being cited after the rally that began in mid-December. On the week, however, crude is positive, adding around $1.50 in the first trading week of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traders were banking some of their recent gains after US President Donald Trump on Thursday proposed repealing the ban on offshore drilling, though even some Republican Senators have expressed opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, a study by Rystad Energy has found that global oil discoveries declined to an all-time low in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi prosecutors confirmed 11 princes were arrested for disturbing public order after they held a sit in at a royal palace.
