The ES found some support around the 50dma at 2722 before climbing higher at the open and settling around the 2740 level. In late trade a large market imbalance was seen which led to some selling in the ES erasing some of the earlier gains. SPX +0.08% at 2719, NASDAQ COMP +0.13% at 7041, DJI +0.24% at 24275.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury trading was particularly quiet, despite it being month-end, quarter-end, and half-end. Heading into the afternoon, volumes declined as it appeared most market players tried to get away early ahead of the Independence Day holiday next week. Despite equities trending higher, the risk-on sentiment failed to send bonds lower with IFR noting slightly month-end demand keeping bonds elevated. US 10YR T-Notes futures (Sep 2018) settled unchanged at 120-06.</p>\r\n",
