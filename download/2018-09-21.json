She however noted that neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other, stressing the UK cannot accept anything that does not respect the referendum result and dismissing the two options offered by the EU stating they are not appropriate for the UK. On the Irish issue, she reiterated once again that the UK will not accept an internal boundary border. Also, UK Raab, commenting on the Salzburg summit, urged the EU to meet the UK halfway and appeared sceptic that the EU is serious about the substance of the negotiations. In response to PM May&rsquo;s statement, EU&#39;s Tusk said the UK knew the EU&#39;s position on the Chequers plan for weeks, noting the EU fully respects UK&#39;s Brexit decision. He however did not exclude the possibility of a compromise as the focus is on getting a deal that would minimise damage resulting from Brexit. He finally said he will treat the Chequers plan as a step in the right direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> A US official announced on Friday the US is open to a meeting with China, adding that the country believes that China trade action is in its long-term interest. A schedule for the meeting has not been set yet. On NAFTA, he noted the US is sticking to its guns on dairy, and reiterated the US is willing to advance only with Mexico but it is up to Canada. Similarly, White House advisor Hassett said they are getting &#39;very, very close&#39; to having to move forward on a trade deal with Mexico, and not Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> The budget plan was in focus after PM Conte held a meeting on Friday with Finance Minister Tria where the latter acknowledged that the political will of the League and the 5-Star is to adopt important steps for a change, as he would look for solutions to perfect both League and 5-Star proposals. Italy League&#39;s Salvini, commenting on the meeting, stated it was very positive. Elsewhere, Italian Deputy PM Di Maio reiterated that new pension rules, flat tax and universal income will be part of the 2019 plan. With regards to the deficit&rsquo;s outlook, Istat announced Italy&#39;s 2017 deficit-GDP ratio has been revised to 2.4% from 2.3%, debt-GDP revised to 131.2% from 131.8%, GDP revised to 1.6% from 1.5% whereas the Italy&#39;s Economy Ministry Undersecretary sees the 2019 deficit 2.0% and 2.2% of GDP. As a side note, Italy&rsquo;s Economic and Financial Document, which will shed some light on the government&rsquo;s plans for their fiscal deficit, is set to be released on September 27th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADIAN CPI &amp; RETAIL SALES:</strong> Inflation in August fell by 0.1%, as expected, and pushed down headline yy to 2.8% from 3.0%. Core CPI posted at 0.1% below the consensus of 0.2%. Whilst gasoline prices contributed to the downside, clothing and footwear contributed to upward inflation pressure. Retail sales rose by 0.9% in July, more than the expected 0.6%, though note this was not a significant beat since volumes were soft and declined by 0.1% that month. Nonetheless, analysts at Scotiabank note the data is on track for a Q3 GDP growth of 3% and believe that CPI and retail sales together &lsquo;continue to support our argument that the BoC is behind the curve and will tighten monetary policy at a somewhat quicker pace than markets anticipate over the coming year including a hike at the October meeting&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.06% at2929, NDX -0.5% at 7531, DJI +0.29% at 26731. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +0.75%, Materials -0.19%, Industrials +0.32%, Cons Discretionary -0.35%, Cons Staples +0.24%, Healthcare +0.18%, Financials -0.39%, Tech -0.36%, Telecoms +0.98%, Utilities +0.39%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>American Airlines (AAL) hiked fees for luggage handling, sending it to the top performers list; Delta Airlines (DAL) rose in sympathy. JPMorgan (JPM) raised its price target for Under Armour (UA, UAA) helping it to make the top performers list again on Friday. McDonald&#39;s (MCD) hiked its dividend, buoying consumer discretionary shares. Micron (MU) was lower, weighing on other chipmakers, after it said tariffs would weigh on its results for three/four quarters ahead. Quad witching and sector rebalancing were said to be impacting the tech sector, though Apple (AAPL) will remain in the tech sector and Amazon (AMZN) will remain in the consumer discretionary sector. Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Twitter (TWTR) will be reclassified as communication companies rather than tech stocks. Copart (CPRT) was downgraded at JPMorgan. General Motors (GM) was lower on reported option activity. Darden (DRI) saw profit-taking after hitting record highs on Thursday, and after a number of broker PT hikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES $0.46 HIGHER AT $70.78/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLES $0.10 HIGHER AT $78.80/BBL.</strong> Crude goes into the weekend mixed, following reports that a supply hike may be considered at the weekend&rsquo;s meeting of the monitoring committee, according to sources. The news came against expectations shaped by policymakers that no production decisions will be made over the weekend, and as such, crude slipped in the European afternoon, as expectations become muddled. &ldquo;Perceptions will vary of course, but we do note that OPEC+ production has already been on the rise and the International Energy Agency has noted that OECD inventories have been little changed since March, and so in our view the real supply worry is what might change as US sanctions on Iranian exports take effect in November rather than current physical supply,&rdquo; Citi said, &ldquo;and with OPEC scheduled to fully review production policy at a December 3 summit, we think any needed adjustments for 2019 can be agreed then.&rdquo; Finally, Saudi Arabia was said to be concerned about oil prices being above USD 80, with sources further noting Saudis are running low of Arab Light for October allocations. On Friday, Baker Hughes reported US oil rigs were down by 1 (second cut in three weeks), natgas rigs unchanged at 186, and the total rig count down 2 at 1053.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 2+ TICKS HIGHER AT 118-21. </strong>News flow generally had little impact on the complex; volumes and ranges were thinner ahead of next week&rsquo;s FOMC meeting, leaving the bias for yields to dip slightly, though not more than 1bps across the curve. There is USD 233bln on the supply slate for next week, including 2s, 5s, and 7s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FX WEEKLY WRAP - DXY: </strong>The index and Dollar in general looks set to end a tough week in the ascendency, but largely due to sharp turnarounds in rival currencies, though decent US data/surveys have also helped intermittently. The DXY has reclaimed 94.000+ status having just held above some decent technical supports not far below Friday&rsquo;s and the wtd base at 93.808, but as mentioned the Greenback&rsquo;s destiny was mainly decided elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> The major loser and underperformer after a roller-coaster ride, as significant UK CPI and retail sales data beats supplemented positive Brexit reports going in to the Salzburg summit to send Cable up to nearly 1.3300, but ultimately no further progress towards a deal with the EU undermining the Pound and prompting the pair to unwind gains all the way back towards 1.3050 and very close to where it started the week. In fact, relations between UK PM May and Brexit Minister Raab on the one side and most EU leaders on the other (EC President Tusk especially) appear to have been extremely cold and the bottom line is that no compromise leaves the Irish border and trade as the insurmountable issues as the clock ticks down to October&rsquo;s summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD:</strong> In contrast to Sterling, the antipodean Dollars have managed to hold the bulk of their gains vs the Usd, just off 0.7300 and almost 0.6700 peaks, with the US and China both dialling down the scale of import tariffs ahead of proposed implementation on September 24, and with mediation still possible to prevent any further tit-for-tat action altogether. However, independent factors also propped up the Aud and Kiwi, including favourable ratings reviews and firmer than forecast NZ GDP data to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Very volatile trade for the Loonie between 1.3065-1.2885 parameters vs its US counterpart as NAFTA reports swung from constructive to negative almost like Brexit sentiment, but appear to be swinging back towards the US ready to leave Canada out and pursue a bilateral agreement with Mexico. Usd/Cad currently around 1.2920 having retested sub-1.2900 levels on the back of better than expected inflation and retail sales reports on balance, also coincidentally like the Gbp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Conversely, it&rsquo;s been almost one-way traffic, or sailing through calmer US-Japanese (and China) trade war waters, with the Jpy also wary that the BoJ remains in powerful easing mode, as the headline pair climbed from a 111.65 low and just below 112.00 at the beginning of the week to 112.90.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CH, NOK, SEK: </strong>The Franc looks set to be the sole G10 gainer vs the Dollar and Eur on the final trading session of the week, with some safe-haven demand potentially stemming from the UK-EU Brexit impasse and/or ongoing Italian political/budget uncertainty, while the SNB may have indirectly underpinned the Chf by sticking to a highly valued assessment at September&rsquo;s quarterly policy review as opposed to anything stronger. Usd/Chf nearer the bottom of a 0.9540-0.9700 range and Eur/Chf circa 1.1250 vs 1.1325 and 1.1220 at either extreme. However, the Scandi crowns have now both been ruffled by Central Bank guidance, as the Nok only got a fleeting lift from confirmation of a 25 bp Norges Bank hike before retreating on guidance flagging the next tightening move in Q1 next year and only assigning a small chance of anything in December. Eur/Nok off highs of 9.6100+ but further above pre-policy meeting levels close to 9.5000, with Eur/Sek following a similar albeit narrower path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Another big week for several regional currencies, with the Rand, Lira and Rouble all eyeing potentially market-moving or even game-changing events in the shape of an SARB rate convene, SA stimulus plan, Turkey&rsquo;s MTEP and data. The Zar has lost some recovery momentum and is back below 14.3000 vs the Usd vs 14.1900+ at one stage in wake of President Ramaphosa announcing fiscal policies to boost growth funded by reprioritising expenditure to the tune of Zar50 bn, but a Zar100 bn infrastructure fund and the exact financing details to be revealed in the October budget. However, a hawkish hold by the SARB helped the Rand retain its recovery momentum, alongside the Rub and both outperforming vs the Try that failed to derive much from the Turkish Finance Minister&rsquo;s medium term economic plan that underwhelmed. Note, Lira now awaiting CBRT minutes from the blockbuster meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong> Monday - German Ifo Survey and ECB&#39;s Draghi to speak Tuesday - US Consumer Confidence, BoE&#39;s Vlieghe and ECB&#39;s Praet, Makuch &amp; Coeure to speak Wednesday - FOMC, RBNZ and CNB Interest Rate Decisions, US New Home Sales, ECB&#39;s Draghi and Mersch to speak Thursday - EZ Economic Sentiment, German CPI, US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Durable Goods &amp; GDP Final reading, Italian Budget Economic and Financial Document release, ECB&#39;s Praet and BoE&#39;s Carney and Haldane to speak Friday - Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI, French CPI, UK &amp; Canadian GDP, German Unemployment, EZ CPI, ECB&#39;s Lane &amp; Praet, Fed&#39;s Barkin &amp; Williams and BoE&#39;s Ramsden to speak.

The news came against expectations shaped by policymakers that no production decisions will be made over the weekend, and as such, crude slipped in the European afternoon, as expectations become muddled. &ldquo;Perceptions will vary of course, but we do note that OPEC+ production has already been on the rise and the International Energy Agency has noted that OECD inventories have been little changed since March, and so in our view the real supply worry is what might change as US sanctions on Iranian exports take effect in November rather than current physical supply,&rdquo; Citi said, &ldquo;and with OPEC scheduled to fully review production policy at a December 3 summit, we think any needed adjustments for 2019 can be agreed then.&rdquo; On Friday, Baker Hughes reported US oil rigs were down by 1 (second cut in three weeks), natgas rigs unchanged at 186, and the total rig count down 2 at 1053.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: Brexit, data, NAFTA and Central Banks ‘brush’ US-China trade issues aside",
        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index and Dollar in general looks set to end a tough week in the ascendency, but largely due to sharp turnarounds in rival currencies, though decent US data/surveys have also helped intermittently. The DXY has reclaimed 94.000+ status having just held above some decent technical supports not far below Friday&rsquo;s and the wtd base at 93.808, but as mentioned the Greenback&rsquo;s destiny was mainly decided elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major loser and underperformer after a roller-coaster ride, as significant UK CPI and retail sales data beats supplemented positive Brexit reports going in to the Salzburg summit to send Cable up to nearly 1.3300, but ultimately no further progress towards a deal with the EU undermining the Pound and prompting the pair to unwind gains all the way back towards 1.3050 and very close to where it started the week. In fact, relations between UK PM May and Brexit Minister Raab on the one side and most EU leaders on the other (EC President Tusk especially) appear to have been extremely cold and the bottom line is that no compromise leaves the Irish border and trade as the insurmountable issues as the clock ticks down to October&rsquo;s summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to Sterling, the antipodean Dollars have managed to hold the bulk of their gains vs the Usd, just off 0.7300 and almost 0.6700 peaks, with the US and China both dialling down the scale of import tariffs ahead of proposed implementation on September 24, and with mediation still possible to prevent any further tit-for-tat action altogether. However, independent factors also propped up the Aud and Kiwi, including favourable ratings reviews and firmer than forecast NZ GDP data to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very volatile trade for the Loonie between 1.3065-1.2885 parameters vs its US counterpart as NAFTA reports swung from constructive to negative almost like Brexit sentiment, but appear to be swinging back towards the US ready to leave Canada out and pursue a bilateral agreement with Mexico. Usd/Cad currently around 1.2920 having retested sub-1.2900 levels on the back of better than expected inflation and retail sales reports on balance, also coincidentally like the Gbp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, it&rsquo;s been almost one-way traffic, or sailing through calmer US-Japanese (and China) trade war waters, with the Jpy also wary that the BoJ remains in powerful easing mode, as the headline pair climbed from a 111.65 low and just below 112.00 at the beginning of the week to 112.90.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc looks set to be the sole G10 gainer vs the Dollar and Eur on the final trading session of the week, with some safe-haven demand potentially stemming from the UK-EU Brexit impasse and/or ongoing Italian political/budget uncertainty, while the SNB may have indirectly underpinned the Chf by sticking to a highly valued assessment at September&rsquo;s quarterly policy review as opposed to anything stronger. Usd/Chf nearer the bottom of a 0.9540-0.9700 range and Eur/Chf circa 1.1250 vs 1.1325 and 1.1220 at either extreme. However, the Scandi crowns have now both been ruffled by Central Bank guidance, as the Nok only got a fleeting lift from confirmation of a 25 bp Norges Bank hike before retreating on guidance flagging the next tightening move in Q1 next year and only assigning a small chance of anything in December. Eur/Nok off highs of 9.6100+ but further above pre-policy meeting levels close to 9.5000, with Eur/Sek following a similar albeit narrower path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another big week for several regional currencies, with the Rand, Lira and Rouble all eyeing potentially market-moving or even game-changing events in the shape of an SARB rate convene, SA stimulus plan, Turkey&rsquo;s MTEP and data. The Zar has lost some recovery momentum and is back below 14.3000 vs the Usd vs 14.1900+ at one stage in wake of President Ramaphosa announcing fiscal policies to boost growth funded by reprioritising expenditure to the tune of Zar50 bn, but a Zar100 bn infrastructure fund and the exact financing details to be revealed in the October budget. However, a hawkish hold by the SARB helped the Rand retain its recovery momentum, alongside the Rub and both outperforming vs the Try that failed to derive much from the Turkish Finance Minister&rsquo;s medium term economic plan that underwhelmed. Note, Lira now awaiting CBRT minutes from the blockbuster meeting.</p>\r\n",

The FTSE MIB is todays outperformer, driven by Atlantia, who have reportedly not had the Hochteif-Abertis acquisition next week quashed, despite suggestions it may be delayed by the Italian bridge disaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mining names are leading gains in the FTSE 100, with Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American benefitting from higher metals prices. Just Eat are at the foot of the index on competition concerns after source reports suggested Uber is looking to take over Deliveroo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - Extended and widespread gains for the single currency with early tests of 1.1800 vs the Greenback and 0.8925 vs the Pound before weaker than expected Eurozone preliminary PMIs (German manufacturing in particular) stymied the Eur&rsquo;s advance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/NZD/AUD - All firmer vs the Usd, as the DXY attempts to keep its head above key chart support (93.713 and 93.640) and in touch with the 94.000 handle, with the Franc now eyeing 0.9550, Kiwi hovering just below 0.6700 and Aud re-testing 0.7300 in wake of Moody&rsquo;s reaffirming NZ&rsquo;s AAA rating and maintaining a stable outlook after S&amp;P&rsquo;s upgraded its outlook for Australia overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY/GBP - The Loonie remains unable to break resistance vs its US counterpart circa 1.2900 amidst ongoing NAFTA stalemate, but may glean some fundamental impetus from upcoming Canadian data in the form of CPI and/or retail sales. Conversely, the Jpy has extended losses vs the Dollar towards 113.00 having breached support at 112.50, while Cable has retreated further from near 1.3300 peaks on Thursday amidst more bad press reviews of the Salzburg Brexit summit, and with downside stops below 1.3210 tripped to a low just under 1.3200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Rand continues to outperform or carry the recovery baton across the region after yesterday&rsquo;s hawkish hold from the SARB, and the Zar is now eyeing the 14.2000 level flagged by the Central Bank vs the Usd with extra momentum derived from SA President Ramaphosa&rsquo;s economic stimulus plan based on reallocating budget expenditure rather than ramping up spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core EU debt futures have eased off best levels to sit back under big figure levels, albeit still firm and within range, but Italian bonds have extended to the topside and stopped just short of 127.00 for the 10 year benchmark as latest budget talks are said to have been constructive and cordial, according to Salvini. Note also, Gilts may have lost some impetus following the latest UK data release that broke a run of better than consensus macro reports from Wednesday, as PSNB balances were adversely impacted by several factors, and perhaps most topical EU budget contributions. Elsewhere, marginally more flattening along the Short Sterling strip as post-Salzburg recriminations rumble on (and no doubt to continue over the weekend), and a similar profile for US Treasuries after this week&rsquo;s pronounced bear curve steepening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is in the green heading into the weekend, with Brent and WTI set to end the week positive by over 1% ahead of the OPEC meeting in Algeria this weekend. In energy newsflow JP Morgan raised their Q4 Brent forecast by USD 22/bbl to USD 63/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metals are generally higher, with the market benefitting from a marginally softer dollar and further dissipation of trade tensions. Gold is set for a 1.5% weekly rise in prices, its first weekly rise in four, and is up on the day. This comes despite Goldman Sachs revising down their gold price forecast to USD 1325/oz from USD 1450/oz. Copper is the largest benefactor of reduced trade tensions, with the industrial material up 2% on the day, and hitting a 6 week high, despite Barclays expecting copper prices to fall from USD 6,603/T in 2018 to USD 6,263/T in 2019</p>\r\n",

The core German bond has now rallied through 159.00 to 159.06 (+32 ticks vs -6 ticks at worst) with additional impetus coming from a retreat in Italian BTPs as retreat on latest comments the Deputy PM that sound less adherent to EU fiscal rules. Back to Liffe, Gilts are hovering close to the top of 121.01-120.77 parameters vs their 120.83 previous close ahead of public finance data, while the STIR strip is firmer for choice, albeit just a tick ahead vs +2 ticks at best. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8357 (Prev. 6.8530)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese Economy Minister Motegi said they will hold a 2nd round of bilateral trade discussions with US in New York on Monday, while he added he wants a win-win outcome and doesn&#39;t expect it to lead to FTA negotiations. Furthermore, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga said PM Abe and US President Trump will meet for dinner on September 23rd and will hold a summit on September 26th.

(Independent) As a heads up, Davis is due to publish his alternate Brexit plan before the Tory Party conference (30th September). (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Cabinet minister Chris Grayling has warned there will be no deal with the EU on Brexit if it does not soften its position on the Irish border. (BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An EEF survey has revealed that over 80 per cent of UK manufacturers say they are not prepared for a no-deal Brexit scenario. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Praet (dove) said markets have interpreted the ECB&#39;s reinvestment timeframe between 2-3 years, while he added he is confident Euro area inflation will converge to target and sees ample degree of monetary accommodation as necessary. Praet also commented the Euro area continues to expand at a rate that is above potential and that money market rates imply a very moderate pace of rate hikes beyond the expected date of lift off. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&#39;s Deputy PM and Five Star Leader Di Maio said he never wanted to bring down the government and reiterated being committed to keep election promises, while Italy&#39;s League said it will govern with Five Star Movement for five years and will respect all the points in the government programme. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD was subdued with the DXY below the 94.00 level following the prior day&rsquo;s slump against its major counterparts which had pushed EUR/USD firmly above 1.1700, while GBP/USD briefly eyed the 1.3300 handle as Retail Sales added to the recent GBP-supportive data releases. Elsewhere, JPY weakened further on safe-haven outflows and AUD/USD kept in close proximity to test 0.7300 to the upside with the currency mildly supported following a sovereign outlook upgrade by S&amp;P. Chinese currencies also took a swipe at the greenback with CNY supported by a firmer fix and with USD/HKD shedding as much 2 points to trade at a 7-month low despite no news catalysts. However, some have attributed it to a breakdown of a 5-month support line and the 7.8400 handle, as well as increases in HIBOR rates in which 7-day, 3-month and 12-month rates rose to the highest since December 2008 in anticipation of a Fed hike next week and subsequent lock step move by the HKMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S&amp;P maintained Australia sovereign rating at AAA; Outlook raised to Stable from Neutral. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed with oil prices subdued following the recent Trump-triggered retreat towards the USD 70.00/bbl in which the US President renewed his calls for lower oil prices as he stated that OPEC monopoly must get prices down now and that the Middle East would not be safe for very long without the US and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices. Elsewhere, gold marginally extended on this week&rsquo;s gains amid a subdued greenback, while copper outperformed on heightened risk appetite and amid the Shanghai Futures Exchange launch of copper options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldman Sachs revised its 12-month gold price forecast to USD 1325/oz from USD 1450/oz and said that USD is unlikely to derail its bullish outlook for commodities, while Goldman Sachs also commented that oil has the strongest fundamental outlook moving forward due to strong US demand, sanctioned declines and other disruptions to supply, as well as constrained US shale output. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields were modestly higher across the Treasury curve, and major curve spreads also narrowed slightly. Talk of the day was short-covering led by the long end as yields eyed 3.25% for the long-bond. A 10yr TIPS auctioned tailed by 1.5bps. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 1 tick higher at 118-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said China will open up its markets to US Farmers. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada Foreign Minister Freeland said she will return to Canada tomorrow, while she added she will be in close contact with the ambassador next week by phone and email but no immediate plans for face to face talks. Elsewhere, Canada Unifor union leader Dias said parties are not close to a deal on NAFTA but added he has guarded optimism, while there were also separate reports that Canada wants guarantees it will not be hit with auto tariffs.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly positive as the region takes impetus from the rally in US where the Nasdaq outperformed on a rebound in tech, while the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA notched all-time highs. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) are positive with Australia led higher by strength in miners following the recent upside in the metals complex, while the Japanese benchmark remains underpinned by a weaker currency and approaches closer towards this year&rsquo;s highs. Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) both initially conformed to the global risk appetite, although sentiment in mainland China proved to be flimsy after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations and dramatically slowed its net liquidity efforts for the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD is subdued with the DXY below the 94.00 level following the prior day&rsquo;s slump against its major counterparts which had pushed EUR/USD firmly above 1.1700, while GBP/USD briefly eyed the 1.3300 handle as Retail Sales added to the recent GBP-supportive data releases. Elsewhere, JPY is weaker on safe-haven outflows and AUD/USD is in close proximity to test 0.7300 to the upside with the currency mildly supported following a sovereign outlook upgrade by S&amp;P. Chinese currencies also took a swipe at the greenback with CNY supported by a firmer fix and with USD/HKD shedding over 2 points to trade at a 7-month low despite no news catalysts, which some have attributed to a breakdown of a 5-month support line and the 7.8400 handle, as well as recent increases in HIBOR rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid gains in stocks and after a reduction of the BoJ&rsquo;s purchases of super-long-end bonds, which pushed the 20yr yield and 30yr yield to their highest since July 2017 and October 2017 respectively.</p>\r\n",
