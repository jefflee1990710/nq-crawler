Sector specifics were led by materials and energy as the commodity complex was higher across the board on Wednesday. On the flipside, consumer staples underperformed, being a defence sector as macro tensions continue to ease. In a day of low volume, Intuitive Surgical &amp; CSX Corp. (CSX) were among the top gainers on Wednesdays session both from a strong earnings report, both beating on the top and bottom line. However, hampering the SPX, IBM (IBM) and Lam Research (LRCX). IBM did beat on both EPS &amp; revenue (reported after market on Tuesday), but its operating gross profit margin was lower than its previous quarter. Lam Research saw a strong earnings report, beating both top &amp; bottom line but traders seemed to be more concerned about the outlook on chip shipments which hampered fellow chip name, Applied Materials (AMAT), closing among the underperformers in the SPX &amp; NDX. In M&amp;A News today focus returned to AT&amp;T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) as pre-market reports stated lawyers thought the companies had gained an edge in the merger trial as they managed to expose some weakness in the Trump administration&#39;s lawsuit. Further, reports in hours from FBN&#39;s Gasparino stated that the judge appears to be siding with AT&amp;T to approve the merger as TWX CEO gave his testimony. SPX +0.1% at 2709, NDX +0.25% at 6833, DJI -0.16% at 24748.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yield curve bear-flattened during the session, with most of the action concentrated in the belly of the curve, where yields on 5s and 7s yield rose by c.5bps, pushing 5s30s under 30bps. There were fresh cyclical highs for the 2yr yield which sent the US/German 2yr spread above 300bps, the widest since 1989. The flattening of the curve has not gone unnoticed by policy makers, Fed&rsquo;s Bullard again warned the risks of a yield curve inversion could be seen within 6 months and said the Fed should have discussions on the subject. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 13+ lower at 120-04+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: </strong>Stocks up, USD up, treasuries down, oil up<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW:</strong> US working towards NAFTA deal in three weeks; BOC holds but tone was balanced; Turkey announces elections.<br /><strong>* AHEAD:</strong> NZ inflation (AMC), Aussie labour market data (overnight), Thursday Fedspeak (Quarles after market, Mester), Thursday BOE speak (Carney, Cunliffe, Broadbent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS:</strong> &nbsp;Russian President Putin is said to be seeking a deal with US President Trump, and is reportedly &ldquo;ready for deep concessions,&rdquo; which followed news from Russia&rsquo;s TASS news, which reported that the White House informed Russia that no new sanctions will be imposed &#39;for now&#39;. US President Trump has also stated his aim to shrink the US trade deficit with Japan and to hopefully reach a balance. Elsewhere, reports suggested that the EU will not enter in trade talks with the US before receiving tariffs exemption. Earlier on Wednesday, the US Commerce Department launched probe on imports of some types of steel wheels from China, while it was also said to have made a preliminary finding that aluminium sheet imports from China benefit from unfair subsidies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>&nbsp;The US is looking to de-nuclearise North Korea by 2020, Nikkei said. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC:</strong> Rates were left unchanged at 1.25%, as expected, with the Bank reiterating its cautious approach and data-dependency; it trimmed growth forecasts for Q1, but there were some upward revisions to its growth and CPI projections for the for the rest of 2018. In the post-meeting press conference, Governor Poloz warned that rates may need to remain below the neutral range, which lent further weakness to CAD.&nbsp; There seems to be a debate over how the meeting should be interpreted, with Scotiabank suggesting there was, in fact, a moderately hawkish bias, despite the dovish market response: the BoC clearly signalled that it has more confidence in a firmer wage and inflation outlook; two the opening statement to the press conference was balanced in many respects but netted out to say &ldquo;It is the view of Governing Council that the need for a negative real policy rate continues to diminish steadily, albeit gradually&rdquo;; third, the neutral nominal policy rate was left unchanged at 3% as the mid-point of a 2.5&ndash;3.5% target range. That keeps it essentially on top of the FOMC&rsquo;s median estimate of the US nominal neutral policy rate; fourth, markets are forgetting a basic lesson about interpreting BoC communications especially given this central bank doesn&rsquo;t provide formal rate guidance. Those forecasts embed the BoC&rsquo;s assumed rate trajectory; fifth, the forecast details support a policy path that points to further rate hikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FEDSPEAK: </strong>The Fed&rsquo;s latest Beige Book noted that the US economy continues to expand at modest-to-moderate pace; manufacturers, agriculture businesses and the transportation sectors expressed concerns about newly imposed tariffs; price pressures were moderate, with steel prices rising due to new tariffs; employment growth continues, labour markets tight, shortages of skills reported, and wage growth was modest. Fed&rsquo;s Dudley (voter, outgoing) made the case for gradual hikes, arguing that the FOMC must bring rates to neutral levels, which he estimated around 3.00%. Dudley sees inflation rising towards target slowly, and sees US monetary policy becoming more restrictive in the years ahead. NOTE, previously Dudley has endorsed between 3-4 hikes in 2018. Non-voter <strong>Kaplan</strong> &ndash; who has been on the wires quite regularly post the Fed&rsquo;s March meeting &ndash; reiterated his view for a total of three rate rises in 2018 (implying two further hikes this year). Uber-dove <strong>Bullard</strong> (non-voter) repeated his cautious views to business television on Wednesday, taking time to again warn of possible yield curve inversion (it could happen within six months, Bullard said), and suggested the Fed would need to feature the subject into its policy debate<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX +0.1% at 2709, NDX +0.25% at 6833, DJI -0.16% at 24748 SECTORS: CONS CYC (XLY):&nbsp; +0.69%, CONS NON-CYC (XLP): -0.72%, ENERGY (XLE): +2.07%, FINANCIALS (XLF): -0.22%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +0.09%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): +1.12%, MATERIALS (XLB): +0.83%, TECH (XLK): -0.09%, TELECOMS (XTL): -0.50%, UTLITIES (XLU): -0.10%.</strong> Trade in the S&amp;P 500 Emini was subdued, and contained near levels seen at the tail-end of trade on Tuesday (2700-2710), though we did top yesterday&rsquo;s high. Sector specifics were led by materials and energy as the commodity complex was higher across the board on Wednesday. On the flipside, consumer staples underperformed, being a defence sector as macro tensions continue to ease. In a day of low volume, Intuitive Surgical &amp; CSX Corp. (CSX) were among the top gainers on Wednesdays session both from a strong earnings report, both beating on the top and bottom line. However, hampering the SPX, IBM (IBM) and Lam Research (LRCX). IBM did beat on both EPS &amp; revenue (reported after market on Tuesday), but its operating gross profit margin was lower than its previous quarter. Lam Research saw a strong earnings report, beating both top &amp; bottom line but traders seemed to be more concerned about the outlook on chip shipments which hampered fellow chip name, Applied Materials (AMAT), closing among the underperformers in the SPX &amp; NDX. In M&amp;A News today focus returned to AT&amp;T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) as pre-market reports stated lawyers thought the companies had gained an edge in the merger trial as they managed to expose some weakness in the Trump administration&#39;s lawsuit. Further, reports in hours from FBN&#39;s Gasparino stated that the judge appears to be siding with AT&amp;T to approve the merger as TWX CEO gave his testimony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI futures settle up by USD 1.95 at USD 68.47/bbl, Brent futures settle up by USD 1.90 at USD 73.48/bbl.</strong> Oil prices climbed on Wednesday after the DoE reported a smaller than expected decline in US crude inventories as well as draws in every other components. Prices also were supported after JODI reported Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s oil production at 9.935mln BPD (Prev. 9.983mln BPD) and exports at 7.251mln BPD (Prev. 7.17mln BPD) as well as after three sources stated the country had stretched its last week&rsquo;s view on oil prices from USD 80/bbl to USD 80-100/bbl range. Finally, the UAE &nbsp;hopes to involve more producers in the supply cuts deal were also bullish for crude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES:</strong> <strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 13+ lower at 120-04+. </strong>The yield curve bear-flattened during the session, with most of the action concentrated in the belly of the curve, where yields on 5s and 7s yield rose by c.5bps, pushing 5s30s under 30bps. There were fresh cyclical highs for the 2yr yield which sent the US/German 2yr spread above 300bps, the widest since 1989. The flattening of the curve has not gone unnoticed by policy makers, Fed&rsquo;s Bullard again warned the risks of a yield curve inversion could be seen within 6 months and said the Fed should have discussions on the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> <strong>GBP</strong> was off worst levels, but still among the worst G10 performers as considerably weaker than expected UK CPI slightly undermines May BoE hike prospects and threatens Sterling&rsquo;s seasonal bull run (to recap, Cable has rallied every April for the past 13 years). GBPUSD currently trading on both sides 1.4200 vs a circa 1.4175 post-data base and the new post-Brexit vote peak around 1.4375 posted only yesterday. <strong>CAD</strong> was another net loser on the day after some choppy trade ahead of the BoC, with the Loonie ultimately weakening from sub-1.2550 vs the Greenback to 1.2630+ and very close to mega option expiries between 1.2585-1.2600 (circa 3 bn) at the NY cut. Rates were left unchanged as widely expected, but the near term growth outlook was radically downgraded amidst NAFTA and global trade dispute uncertainty. In sum, policy will remain data dependent and the stance is still cautious. <strong>EUR</strong> was more resistant than the Pound after a downward tweak to headline Eurozone inflation in the final release, as other price metrics were relatively firm and the ECB is not expected to alter policy or guidance materially next week. EURUSD briefly dipped below 1.2350, but has recovered since towards 1.2400 again, while EURGBP remains above 0.8700 on the unsupportive Sterling factors mentioned above. Mixed performances for <strong>AUDNZD</strong> as the cross climbs over 1.0600 and AUDUSD bounces off technical support around 0.7750, but NZDUSD treads cautiously ahead of NZ Q1 CPI tonight in a 0.7300-50 range. <strong>USDJPY</strong> locked in a very tight band just above 107.00, but USDCHF seeing a bit more price action within 0.9650-0.9700 trading parameters as the Franc gains some traction &ndash; <strong>EURCHF</strong> slipping back after the old 1.2000 floor capped its advances. Political developments and an early date for Turkish elections (June 24) boosted the Lira against the Dollar resulting as the outperformer in the EM currency bloc, with <strong>USDTRY</strong> testing chart support around 4.0300 ahead of obvious psychological interest at 4.0000 having been at 4.1900+ recently. &nbsp;Peso weakened against the Dollar after BoC deputy govern suggested NAFTA risks still remains putting the peso against the key EM underperformers, but then reversed losses after sources reported a NAFTA deal could be reached in 3 weeks. Also eyeing a key/big figure level vs the Dollar (18.0000) amidst pro-NAFTA comments from Mexico&rsquo;s Presidential candidate front-runner, and ahead of a meeting in the US on Thursday.</p>\r\n",

Gbp/Usd currently just above 1.4200 vs a circa 1.4175 post-data base and the new post-Brexit vote peak around 1.4375 posted only yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another net loser on the day after some choppy trade ahead of the BoC, with the Loonie ultimately weakening from sub-1.2550 vs the Greenback to 1.2630+ and very close to mega option expiries between 1.2585-1.2600 (circa 3 bn) at the NY cut. Rates were left unchanged as widely expected, but the near term growth outlook was radically downgraded amidst NAFTA and global trade dispute uncertainty. In sum, policy will remain data dependent and the stance is still cautious. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More resistant than the Pound after a downward tweak to headline Eurozone inflation in the final release, as other price metrics were relatively firm and the ECB is not expected to alter policy or guidance materially next week. Eur/Usd briefly dipped below 1.2350, but has recovered since towards 1.2400 again, while Eur/Gbp remains above 0.8700 on the unsupportive Sterling factors mentioned above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD/NZD </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed performances as the cross climbs over 1.0600 and Aud/Usd bounces off technical support around 0.7750, but Nzd/Usd treads cautiously ahead of NZ Q1 CPI tonight in a 0.7300-50 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/CHF </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Jpy locked in a very tight band just above 107.00, but Usd/Chf seeing a bit more price action within 0.9650-0.9700 trading parameters as the Franc gains some traction &ndash; Eur/Chf slipping back after the old 1.2000 floor capped its advances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political developments and an early date for Turkish elections (June 24) helped the Lira recoup more of its heavy losses, with Usd/Try testing chart support around 4.0300 ahead of obvious psychological interest at 4.0000 having been at 4.1900+ recently. Peso also eyeing a key/big figure level vs the Dollar (18.0000) amidst pro-NAFTA comments from Mexico&rsquo;s Presidential candidate front-runner, and ahead of a meeting in the US on Thursday.</p>\r\n",

Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat as safe-haven outflows from the increased risk appetite in Japan was counterbalanced by the BoJ presence in the market for over JPY 1tln in 1-10yr JGBs, while USTs were lower overnight with yields in the short-end higher in which 2yr yields rose to 2.400% for the first time since 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Department launched probe on imports of some types of steel wheels from China, while it was also said to have made a preliminary finding that aluminium sheet imports from China benefit from unfair subsidies.

However, the Franc has lost more traction through its 200 DMA between 0.9550-60 vs the Usd and appears on track, if not intent to hit 1.2000 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a couple of outlying hawkish calls for the upcoming BoC policy meeting vs the large consensus expecting no change, as the Loonie unwinds some of its recent gains vs the Usd and perhaps is drawn to big option expiries from 1.2585-1.2600 in some 3 bn.

However, the index is still looking rangy between 89.700-400 and 90.000-89.000 outside of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable had already retraced further from fresh post-Brexit vote peaks (circa 1.4375) in the run up to UK inflation data, but has now lost another big figure level (1.4200) in wake of considerably weaker than forecast CPI data that could prevent the BoE from hiking rates in May. Eur/Gbp has rebounded sharply as a consequence, through 0.8650 and just over 0.8700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another G10 currency on the defensive ahead of inflation data, and now reversing further 0.7400 approximate peaks vs the Usd, and now only just holding above the big figure below ahead of the NZ CPI report for Q1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/CHF </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional safe-havens are back in sync against the backdrop of improving risk sentiment, but with Usd/Jpy still capped ahead of recent peaks and a pivotal chart area around 107.50-55 having bounced off a major tech support level on Tuesday (106.89-90). However, the Franc has lost more traction through its 200 DMA between 0.9550-60 vs the Usd and appears on track, if not intent to hit 1.2000 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a couple of outlying hawkish calls for the upcoming BoC policy meeting vs the large consensus expecting no change, as the Loonie unwinds some of its recent gains vs the Usd and perhaps is drawn to big option expiries from 1.2585-1.2600 in some 3 bn. Currently near the bottom end of the band vs a circa 1.2525 low yesterday with the level break via options suggesting a 90 pip move on the BoC and MPR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eur/Usd just holding above key chart support around 1.2330 having retreated from 1.2400+ on Tuesday following an unexpected downgrade to final Eurozone CPI.</p>\r\n",

The range so far has been 159.26-34 vs Tuesday&rsquo;s 159.34 close, and on relatively light turnover of sub-15k lots. Data-wise, Italian industrial orders may warrant a bit more attention than usual given the ongoing outperformance of BTPs and coalition Government negotiations, but Eurozone inflation will have a bigger impact of course if outside consensus.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) was positive but with upside capped by weakness in the largest weighted financials sector amid an ongoing Banking Royal Commission grilling and after CYBG flagged a GBP 202mln pre-tax charge, while Nikkei 225 (+1.4%) outperformance was fuelled by a weaker JPY. Elsewhere, both Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) were underpinned at the open in reaction to the PBoC&rsquo;s surprise 100bps RRR cut for most banks and a CNY 150bln Reverse Repo operation. However, Chinese bourses then failed to hold on to gains with some sceptical as the PBoC also required most of the additional funds from the RRR cut to be used to pay back Medium-term Lending Facility loans, while there were also reports of US Commerce Department probes on imports of some types of Chinese steel wheels and aluminium sheet imports. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat as safe-haven outflows from the increased risk appetite in Japan was counterbalanced by the BoJ presence in the market for over JPY 1tln in 1-10yr JGBs, while USTs were lower overnight with yields in the short-end higher in which 2yr yields rose to 2.400% for the first time since 2008.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mostly higher as the region gets a tailwind from Wall St where sentiment was lifted by encouraging earnings and with gains led by the Nasdaq after Netflix shares surged on strong subscriber numbers. ASX 200 (+0.3%) is positive but with weakness in the largest weighted financials sector capping upside amid an ongoing Banking Royal Commission grilling and after CYBG flagged a GBP 202mln pre-tax charge, while Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) outperformance is fuelled by a weaker JPY. Elsewhere, both Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) were underpinned at the open in reaction to the PBoC&rsquo;s surprise 100bps RRR cut for most banks and a CNY 150bln Reverse Repo operation. However, Chinese bourses then failed to hold on to gains as the PBoC also required most of the additional funds from the RRR cut to be used to pay back Medium-term Lending Facility loans, while there were also reports of US Commerce Department probes on imports of some types of Chinese steel wheels and that it determined aluminium sheet imports from China benefit from unfair subsidies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD/JPY and JPY crosses are the most active overnight and are higher on safe-haven outflows from JPY amid the positive risk tone across stocks. Elsewhere, the remainder of currencies are relatively quiet with the DXY stuck around 89.50, while EUR/USD and GBP/USD are range-bound but with the latter back at the 1.4300 handle as it nurses losses following yesterday&rsquo;s pull-back from post-referendum highs. Elsewhere, antipodeans are quiet due to a lack of data and catalysts to spur price action, while HKD remains near the lower end of the band despite further attempts by the HKMA to defend the peg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat as safe-haven outflows from the increased risk appetite in Japan, is counterbalanced by the BoJ presence in the market for over JPY 1tln in 1-10yr JGBs, while USTs were lower overnight with yields in the short-end rising to push 2yr yields to 2.400% for the first time since 2008.</p>\r\n",
