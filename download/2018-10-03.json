Deputy PM Di Maio also said EUR 10bln is the minimum figure for citizens income and confirmed this will be included in the budget alongside a rise in the lowest pensions and tax cuts for companies; he added there is no plan to cut the deficit more if GDP growth disappoints. As a side note, this worried investors in the European session as reports had suggested if Finance Minister Tria&#39;s forecasts were mistaken, the debt/GDP ratio could rise well above 2.4% and possibly above 3%, breaching the EU rule. Italian Economy Minister Tria later said that the government will ensure that debt falls by more in 2019 than recent years adding that the deficit will fall gradually in the years after 2019. Italy&#39;s Deputy PM Salvini also added Italy&#39;s GDP will rise at least 1.5% in 2019 and that the only certain figure is the 2019 2.4% deficit/GDP target. The EU Commission said it will assess Italy&#39;s budget once it is submitted and that they will be taking into account the Commission&#39;s economic forecasts. Later in the session, Italy&#39;s EU Affairs Minister Savona said he presented a document to the EU parliament to reassess EU monetary and fiscal policy; he told EU lawmakers there is absolutely no chance Italy will default on its debt, and Italy is nothing like Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May at the Conservative Party conference stuck to her Chequers plan despite not giving any explicit reference to the name; she defined her proposal a free trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods which would give control on money and taxes. She also said Britain is not afraid to leave the EU without a deal, adding that a no-deal would be a bad outcome for both the UK and the EU as tariffs and costly checks at borders would be introduced, noting it would be tough at first. Therefore, she urged to come together even if we do not all agree on every part of Brexit. On the UK economy, she emphasized that reducing the deficit has been painful, though she expects the debt as a share of the economy to go down. She highlighted the next challenge is to help working people with the cost of living noting the conservative answer is helping with ending austerity. On the housing market, she said the only way to fix broken market is by building more homes. Elsewhere, Irish PM Varadkar stated that UK PM May is hoping for bilateral talks but that will not happen whilst UK Brexit Minister Raab said it is not fair to say that Northern Ireland&#39;s DUP has whip in Brexit negotiations and that he will de-dramatise the Northern Ireland issue and work on technical and technological solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Evans (Non-Voter, Dove) is comfortable with the expected path for the expectations of rate hikes and expects rates to be raised in December. He however noted inflation expectations in the market have not gone as much as he would like and sees negative interest rates as &lsquo;very painful&rsquo;. He was upbeat on the current state of the economy describing this momentum as a &#39;very mature&#39; expansion. He noted the US fiscal policy is &#39;extremely pro-cyclical&#39;. On trade, he believes the situation is &#39;a lot more complicated&#39; stressing it is positive that the US has struck deal with both Canada and Mexico as this removes uncertainty for businesses. On Brexit, he noted successful negotiations would be beneficial for the US. Fed&#39;s Harker (Non-Voter, Dovish) favoured 3 rate hikes this year but could favour one more hike in December; he does not want to rush normalisation. He stated employment numbers keep surprising the Fed and thins they will eventually slow down. Fed&#39;s Barkin (Voter) did not discuss monetary policy but warned a &#39;hard Brexit&#39; or a &#39;political crisis&#39; are scenarios for potential shocks to the US economy. Fed&#39;s Mester (Hawk, Voter) does not see a risk inflation will pick up &quot;precipitously&quot; and believes gradual pace rate increases are still appropriate. She notes reaching a phase in policy where the Fed is very dependent on data. She warned US divergence from other economies could see feed back through the dollar and other markets which would have to be factored into policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ADP</strong> surprised investors reporting a 230k jump in private payrolls last month which seems to have shrugged off any impact from Hurricane Florence; this was the best reading since February. Analysts at Pantheon note this is in line with the recent strength of other surveys including g the ISMs and JOLTS, though they note that &lsquo;in months hit by both severe winter storms or hurricanes, ADP consistently is stronger than the official number&rsquo; since ADP includes names on the payroll list even if people did not receive an income in that period. As a result, they anticipate Friday&rsquo;s estimate to show a temporary drop this week and thus expect 150k payrolls to be added to the economy, consensus is for 185k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ISM NON-MFG</strong> leaped last month indicating economic activity has strengthened in the US. The Non-Mfg Index hit a 21-year high posting at 61.6 (Prev. 60.4). Current activity, new orders and supplier delivers were also all lifted. Analysts at Wells Fargo note input prices in non-mfg are showing a few signs of easing. The Employment Index also jumped to an all-time high of 62.4 which raises Well Fargo&rsquo;s NFP expectations for this week to 210k; they also note GDP growth will remain robust heading into Q4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.07% at 2926, NDX +0.12% at 7637, DJI +0.21% at 26831 SECTORS: </strong>Energy +0.83%, Materials -0.76%, Industrials +0.45%, Cons Discretionary -0.43%, Cons Staples -1.06%, Healthcare -0.23%, Financials +0.81%, Tech +0.34%, Telecoms +0.27%, Utilities -1.23%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Wynn Resorts (WYNN) was the biggest gainer -ATOW- in the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on the back of the casino industry as whole gaining. SVB Financial (SIVB) another big gainer, benefitting from a Barclays price target rise and financial sector gains as whole. Xilinx (XLNX) pushed up the Nasdaq after price target raises at BMO and Credit Suisse. Energy names such as HollyFrontier (HFC) and Valero Energy (VLO) traded higher as did the wider energy sector, despite the bigger than expected build in EIA data. AMD (AMD) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) continued their tumble from yesterday making them the biggest losers on the day. (TSLA) pushed down on the day, also Hudson Bay Capital announced they were short on the stock. Other losers included the REIT, Weyerhaeuser (WY) and oil co. Baker Hughes (BHGE).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 1.18 HIGHER AT USD 76.41/BBL, BRENT (Z8) SETTLES USD 1.89 HIGHER AT USD 86.29/BBL. </strong>Crude was under pressure on Wednesday after Russia/Saudi Arabia suggested that OPEC and its partners has a buffer of spare capacity to offset declines in Iranian/Venezuelan output/exports, as well as a bearish inventory report out of the DOE. Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s energy minister Al Falih said the nation&rsquo;s current rate of production was running at a record 10.7mln BPD, and said that level will tick higher in November. Russia&rsquo;s Putin, meanwhile, said that Russia has the capacity to boost output by 200k-300k BPD, adding that he would be happy to see crude prices between $65-75/bbl. Libya&rsquo;s NOC also suggested it may be able to raise output from current levels around 1.25mln BPD. &ldquo;It looks as though Saudi Arabia and Russia are both pumping more freely, which works both as a response to the likely impact of US sanctions on Iranian supply and as a more practical business-oriented response to higher prices,&rdquo; Citi said, &ldquo;if the market can accept the increased volumes at the higher price level, both the Saudis and Russians are ready to ring the cash register.&rdquo; There was further downside in crude after weekly inventory data showed a larger than expected build (7.975mln vs an expected 1.132mln), Cushing stocks rose 1.699mln, gasoline stocks drew down by 459k against an expected build of 1.316mln, while distillate stocks slipped by 1.75mln in line with the expected draw of 1.672mln. However, in the aftermath of the release, crude pared back its losses amid reports of Yemen missiles fired at Saudi soldiers; with WTI returning back to consolidate above $75/bbl, while Brent made its way back to the $85/bbl region it has been consolidating at this week. In later comments, Russian Energy Minister Novak said there is always a risk of oil prices rising too quickly, noting oil is &lsquo;a bit too high&rsquo; already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 4+ TICKS HIGHER AT 118.26. </strong>Treasury yields ticked higher on Wednesday, and the curve bear-steepened, underpinned by solid ADP employment data ahead of this week&rsquo;s official payrolls, as well as an encouraging non-manufacturing ISM report. Amid this news, traders continued to cite evidence of wage pressures in the US, after Amazon (AMZN) announced it would raise minimum wages for its employees. The probability of an FOMC rate hike in December also edged higher as Treasuries were sold. Front-end yields found fresh decade+ highs, while 10-year yields rose to the highest since July 2011, and 30-year yields rose to the highest since October 2014. Major curve spreads were wider, with 2s10s rising to 30bps (+5bps), 2s30s above 45bps (+5.6bps), 5s30s to 29bps (+25.7bps) , though 10s30s was only modestly steeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Back on a firmer footing, with the index rebounding from sub-95.300 levels extending to over 95.750 at best in wake of upbeat ADP and non-manufacturing ISM surveys. Note, the former beat on the headline front and was supplemented by a back-month upgrade (albeit relatively small), while the latter also surprised on the upside with a strong jobs component that all bodes well for the official monthly BLS employment report on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD: </strong>Extending recent losses and underperformance on increasingly bearish chart impulses, ongoing global trade concerns and in the case of the Aud in particular data as well (building permits plunged much more than expected in August). Aud/Usd slipped just below 0.7150 to test tech support around 0.7142, as big option expiries at 0.7190 (1.2 bn) kept upside attempts capped ahead of 0.7200. Ahead, a speech from RBA assistant Governor Ellis may provide some fresh/independent direction, while the Aud/Nzd cross straddles 1.0900 and Kiwi hovers near 0.6550 vs its US peer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>Another G10 laggard vs the Greenback and other counterparts, with the Franc around 0.9900 and around 1.1400 vs the Eur even though the single currency suffered more Italian budget related angst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> Relatively rangebound vs the Usd between113.50-114.30 on the wide, and lacking any real specific drivers on the Jpy side, as a combination of strong chart levels and hefty supply/offers kept the headline pair largely in check (although rebounding US Treasury yields and a slowdown in Japan&rsquo;s services PMI to near 50.0 may well have had some underlying influence).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, CAD: </strong>The single currency fluctuated from circa 1.1525 to 1.1595 on a stream of Italian budget headlines (vs a restrained 1.2805-45 Loonie range) and then retreated below 1.1515 heading to the US close. The Eur was elevated or simply relieved after reports suggesting that Italy&rsquo;s coalition could set sights lower on 2020 and 2021 deficits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> As noted above, the exception to the rule as the Pound shrugged off a slightly sub-forecast UK services PMI to trade just below 1.3000 vs the Dollar and just below 0.8900 vs the Eur in wake of reports that a more detailed blueprint for the Irish border back-stop may be published soon. Note, PM May raised some eyebrows with her &lsquo;choreographed&rsquo; conference arrivals and for not mentioning the Chequers White Paper during the closing speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back on a firmer footing, with the index rebounding from sub-95.300 levels to just over 95.600 at best in wake of upbeat ADP and non-manufacturing ISM surveys. Note, the former beat on the headline front and was supplemented by a back month upgrade (albeit relatively small), while the latter also surprised on the upside with a strong jobs component that all bodes well for the official monthly BLS employment report on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending recent losses and underperformance on increasingly bearish chart impulses, ongoing global trade concerns and in the case of the Aud in particular data as well (building permits plunged much more than expected in August). Aud/Usd slipped just below 0.7150 to test tech support around 0.7142, as big option expiries at 0.7190 (1.2 bn) kept upside attempts capped ahead of 0.7200. Ahead, a speech from RBA assistant Governor Ellis may provide some fresh/independent direction, while the Aud/Nzd cross straddles 1.0900 and Kiwi hovers near 0.6550 vs its US peer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another G10 laggard vs the Greenback and other counterparts, with the Franc only just holding above 0.9900 and back down under 1.1400 vs the Eur even though the single currency suffered more Italian budget related angst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatively rangebound vs the Usd between113.50-114.05 on the wide, and lacking any real specific drivers on the Jpy side, as a combination of strong chart levels and hefty supply/offers kept the headline pair largely in check (although rebounding US Treasury yields and a slowdown in Japan&rsquo;s services PMI to near 50.0 may well have had some underlying influence).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both looking to end Wednesday&rsquo;s EU session pretty flat vs the Usd, but this hardly tells the full story for the single currency that fluctuated from circa 1.1525 to 1.1595 on a stream of Italian budget headlines (vs a restrained 1.2805-45 Loonie range). The Eur was elevated or simply relieved after early reports suggesting that Italy&rsquo;s coalition could set sights lower on 2020 and 2021 deficits (2.2% and 2% respectively, or even a tad less per 5-Star sources), but subsequently deflated by comments implying no figures have been agreed apart from 2.4% for next year. Moreover, Di Maio is holding out for at least Eur10 bn for the citizens income and will not commit to other measures beyond growth for debt reduction. All will apparently be revealed shortly (parliament submission said to be after 4 pm London time), or not as other Government sources revert to nothing out today!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted above, the exception to the rule as the Pound shrugged off a slightly sub-forecast UK services PMI to trade back above 1.3000 vs the Dollar and well over 0.8900 vs the Eur in wake of reports that a more detailed blueprint for the Irish border back-stop may be published soon. Note, PM May raised some eyebrows with her &lsquo;choreographed&rsquo; conference arrivals and for not mentioning the Chequers White Paper during the closing speech.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, the Usd is only a tad firmer on balance as the DXY rebounds to just over 95.600, with the Eur just holding above Monday&rsquo;s lows v s a more perky Gbp back up near 1.3000. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This, however, reversed course after the details from their budget proposal said a &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; of EUR 10bln is to be set aside for citizens income and that there are no plans to alter the deficit if GDP growth disappoints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has led to investors repeating concerns over fiscal irresponsibility and the possibility of debt/GDP rising over 3% should GDP growth forecasts not come in line. This hit market sentiment, with equities now flat after having been in positive territory in the early morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note, that the DAX is closed for trading on this session for German Unity day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norsk Hydro and Tesco are leading the losses in Wednesday&rsquo;s session.

Tesco is struggling after reporting earnings wherein profit missed expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - Clear G10 outperformers, or at least bucking the overall trend of losses vs the USD, with the single currency bouncing firmly from near 1.1500 lows towards the big figure above following reports that the Italian Government is aiming to cut 2020 and 2021 deficits from an initial 2.4%, which still stands for next year, and perhaps even below 2.2% and 2% respectively. However, Eur/Usd has eased back awaiting confirmation of the more compliant budget plan, as Deputy PM Di Maio undermines some of the good will/relief by stating that the minimum amount for citizens income should be set at Eur10 bn. Attention now turns to another coalition party convene in Rome, and from a technical standpoint the headline pair faces resistance just above 1.1600, if that level is breached, such as the 50 DMA (1.1607) and a 38.2% Fib (1.1624). Meanwhile, Cable is retesting the 1.3000 handle awaiting UK PM May&rsquo;s keynote address to close the Tory Party conference amidst reports from the DUP that a more detailed Irish back-stop proposal will be unveiled soon, and not that deterred by a marginal services PMI miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - The major losers and retreating further from Tuesday&rsquo;s recovery highs, with the Aud hit by significantly weaker than expected Aussie building approvals overnight and only just holding above 0.7150 ahead of a speech from RBA&rsquo;s Ellis and with heavy option expiry interest at the 0.7190 strike (1.2 bn) also in the mix. The Kiwi has fallen in sympathy, but also in wake of yet another sharp decline in GDT auction prices to circa 0.6560.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY/CHF - All down against the Greenback, but within recent ranges as the Loonie keeps its head above 1.2850 and Jpy over 114.00 and large offers said to be sitting between 114.20-60 and Franc continues to meander within a 0.9835-70 band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Inflation vibes have impacted the Lira and Rand, with Turkish CPI far exceeding forecasts and catapulting to 24%+ y/y and Usd/Try rallying to almost 6.1000 in response from just under 6.0000 pre-data, while Usd/Zar has rebounded from sub-14.2900 to 14.3500+ in wake of an SARB warning about inflation overshooting the 6% target. However, the Lira may yet regain traction if measures to combat inflation are deemed credible/successful and the courts decide to release US Pastor Brunson after the latest appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source report story suggesting Russia and Saudi Arabia are to boost oil output in December hit the oil market, which started in the green off the back of yesterday&rsquo;s smaller than expected build in API crude stocks. The crude complex is now flat as suggestions of increased supply halted Brent&rsquo;s advance over the USD 85/BBL with the benchmark now hovering just below the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Iraqi Energy Minister said that they will assess increased OPEC output in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is unchanged after having risen by over 1% in the previous session. The biggest mover in the commodities scope can be found in aluminium, which has rallied to over 5 week highs after Norsk Hydro announced the cessation of operations at their Alunorte site in Brazil, stoking the flames of supply concerns for the industrial metal.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/20224/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities started the day on the front foot after the early morning risk tone benefited from Italy confirming the debt/GDP target from 2020 at 2.2% vs. the originally quoted 2.4%. This, however, reversed course after the details from their budget proposal said a &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; of EUR 10bln is to be set aside for citizens income and that there are no plans to alter the deficit if GDP growth disappoints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has led to investors repeating concerns over fiscal irresponsibility and the possibility of debt/GDP rising over 3% should GDP growth forecasts not come in line. This hit market sentiment, with equities now flat after having been in positive territory in the early morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note, that the DAX is closed for trading on this session for German Unity day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norsk Hydro and Tesco are leading the losses in Wednesday&rsquo;s session. The Scandinavian company is being hit by the ceasing of operations at their Alunorte site in Brazil. Tesco is struggling after reporting earnings wherein profit missed expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - Clear G10 outperformers, or at least bucking the overall trend of losses vs the USD, with the single currency bouncing firmly from near 1.1500 lows towards the big figure above following reports that the Italian Government is aiming to cut 2020 and 2021 deficits from an initial 2.4%, which still stands for next year, and perhaps even below 2.2% and 2% respectively. However, Eur/Usd has eased back awaiting confirmation of the more compliant budget plan, as Deputy PM Di Maio undermines some of the good will/relief by stating that the minimum amount for citizens income should be set at Eur10 bn. Attention now turns to another coalition party convene in Rome, and from a technical standpoint the headline pair faces resistance just above 1.1600, if that level is breached, such as the 50 DMA (1.1607) and a 38.2% Fib (1.1624). Meanwhile, Cable is retesting the 1.3000 handle awaiting UK PM May&rsquo;s keynote address to close the Tory Party conference amidst reports from the DUP that a more detailed Irish back-stop proposal will be unveiled soon, and not that deterred by a marginal services PMI miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - The major losers and retreating further from Tuesday&rsquo;s recovery highs, with the Aud hit by significantly weaker than expected Aussie building approvals overnight and only just holding above 0.7150 ahead of a speech from RBA&rsquo;s Ellis and with heavy option expiry interest at the 0.7190 strike (1.2 bn) also in the mix. The Kiwi has fallen in sympathy, but also in wake of yet another sharp decline in GDT auction prices to circa 0.6560.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY/CHF - All down against the Greenback, but within recent ranges as the Loonie keeps its head above 1.2850 and Jpy over 114.00 and large offers said to be sitting between 114.20-60 and Franc continues to meander within a 0.9835-70 band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Inflation vibes have impacted the Lira and Rand, with Turkish CPI far exceeding forecasts and catapulting to 24%+ y/y and Usd/Try rallying to almost 6.1000 in response from just under 6.0000 pre-data, while Usd/Zar has rebounded from sub-14.2900 to 14.3500+ in wake of an SARB warning about inflation overshooting the 6% target. However, the Lira may yet regain traction if measures to combat inflation are deemed credible/successful and the courts decide to release US Pastor Brunson after the latest appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet more conflicting reports from Italy on the budget front, with 5-Star sources suggesting even more deficit containment after 2019 and Economy Minister Tria still trying to tow the EU fiscal line, but Di Maio pushing for a minimum spend of Eur10 bn on citizens income, while implying no automatic measures to cut the debt load if growth is not strong enough to ensure a reduction. In sum, a lot riding on, and still uncertain ahead of the upcoming&nbsp; meeting in Rome, but a sharp reversal in BTPs from best levels to 120.81 at one stage (-21 ticks vs +141 ticks earlier), while Bunds pared more of their arrears to only -6 ticks at 159.46 vs -53 ticks at 158.99, which was also a tech support level. Elsewhere, a more marked rebound in Gilts from -23 ticks to +6 ticks at a new 121.38 Liffe intraday high, with perhaps additional impetus from the UK services PMI and now awaiting PM May around 11.45BST. Turning to US Treasuries, futures remain hemmed near the base of overnight ranges and the curve is steeper in advance of a packed agenda including data and a lot more Fed speak after repeated his satisfaction with market rate expectations and a final one this year in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source report story suggesting Russia and Saudi Arabia are to boost oil output in December hit the oil market, which started in the green off the back of yesterday&rsquo;s smaller than expected build in API crude stocks. The crude complex is now flat as suggestions of increased supply halted Brent&rsquo;s advance over the USD 85/BBL with the benchmark now hovering just below the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Iraqi Energy Minister said that they will assess increased OPEC output in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is unchanged after having risen by over 1% in the previous session. The biggest mover in the commodities scope can be found in aluminium, which has rallied to over 5 week highs after Norsk Hydro announced the cessation of operations at their Alunorte site in Brazil, stoking the flames of supply concerns for the industrial metal.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clear G10 outperformers, or at least bucking the overall trend of losses vs the USD, with the single currency bouncing firmly from near 1.1500 lows towards the big figure above following reports that the Italian Government is aiming to cut 2020 and 2021 deficits from an initial 2.4%, which still stands for next year, and perhaps even below 2.2% and 2% respectively. However, Eur/Usd has eased back awaiting confirmation of the more compliant budget plan, as Deputy PM Di Maio undermines some of the good will/relief by stating that the minimum amount for citizens income should be set at Eur10 bn. Attention now turns to another coalition party convene in Rome, and from a technical standpoint the headline pair faces resistance just above 1.1600, if that level is breached, such as the 50 DMA (1.1607) and a 38.2% Fib (1.1624). Meanwhile, Cable is retesting the 1.3000 handle awaiting UK PM May&rsquo;s keynote address to close the Tory Party conference amidst reports from the DUP that a more detailed Irish back-stop proposal will be unveiled soon, and not that deterred by a marginal services PMI miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major losers and retreating further from Tuesday&rsquo;s recovery highs, with the Aud hit by significantly weaker than expected Aussie building approvals overnight and only just holding above 0.7150 ahead of a speech from RBA&rsquo;s Ellis and with heavy option expiry interest at the 0.7190 strike (1.2 bn) also in the mix. The Kiwi has fallen in sympathy, but also in wake of yet another sharp decline in GDT auction prices to circa 0.6560.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All down against the Greenback, but within recent ranges as the Loonie keeps its head above 1.2850 and Jpy over 114.00 and large offers said to be sitting between 114.20-60 and Franc continues to meander within a 0.9835-70 band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inflation vibes have impacted the Lira and Rand, with Turkish CPI far exceeding forecasts and catapulting to 24%+ y/y and Usd/Try rallying to almost 6.1000 in response from just under 6.0000 pre-data, while Usd/Zar has rebounded from sub-14.2900 to 14.3500+ in wake of an SARB warning about inflation overshooting the 6% target. However, the Lira may yet regain traction if measures to combat inflation are deemed credible/successful and the courts decide to release US Pastor Brunson after the latest appeal.</p>\r\n",

In terms of Wednesday&rsquo;s domestic agenda, September&rsquo;s services PMI is due and like manufacturing and construction surveys forecast to reveal slower activity, but recall that the latter 2 were mixed.

Ranges so far for the respective 10 year benchmarks are 121.58-122.43 and 158.99-159.20 vs Tuesday&rsquo;s 121.02 and 159.52 closes, with the corresponding yield spread converging through 300 bp accordingly. Ahead, services and composite PMIs ahead of retail sales, but it&rsquo;s still almost if not quite all about Italy in the run up to another meeting before formal presentation to parliament, and then the ensuing EU verdict after October 15.</p>\r\n",
