However, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) released data on its cancer immunotherapy which saw mixed results, resulting in NKTR hitting intraday lows of ~40%, and BMY lower by 5%. Retailers performed well today with Walmart (WMT) acquiring a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, subject to regulatory approval, where it forecasts a slight benefit to EPS next fiscal year, WMT led the DJI today with gains of roughly 2.5%. Over in the SPX Under Armour (UA) and target (TGT) outperformed also. Apple (AAPL) rose to fresh intraday record highs before its worldwide Developers Conference, and traders booked profits. At the WWDC CEO Tim Cook said Apple has paid out USD 30bln to iPhone app developers in the last year; total developer earnings from the tech giant are expected to hit USD 100bln this week. He also noted the new iOS 12 operating system will focus on performance, including battery life and quicker apps access.

Yields were higher but off their multi-year peaks as trade fear remains in investors&rsquo; minds. Volume in the complex was average in a quiet session; the yield curve saw some modest bear flattening with 2yr and 5yr yields higher by c.4bps and 30yr higher by c.3bps, but major spreads across the curve were pretty much unchanged at settlement. US 10yr T-notes futures (Sep 2018) settled 11 ticks lower at 119-26+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li><strong>RBA rate decision to be published on 5 June at 0530 BST/0030 EDT</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>RBA expected to hold its Cash Rate at 1.50%; market reaction expected to be limited</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EXPECTATIONS: </strong>The RBA rate decision is due on Tuesday morning, and expectations are one-sided for the central bank to keep policy on hold. This has been reflected in the ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures, &nbsp;which price in 100% expectations for the central bank to keep the Cash Rate Target unchanged at the record low 1.50%, while the associated implied yield curve suggests June 2019 as the earliest date for when the central bank would be leaning more towards a 25bps rate hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RECENT RHETORIC: </strong>The rhetoric from the central bank continues to point to no near-term policy adjustments; the latest central bank Statement on Monetary Policy and minutes from the prior meeting reiterated that the board sees no strong case for a near-term change in rates, and that the next move would likely be a hike rather than a cut. The RBA also expects inflation to remain subdued for some time due to retail competition and slow growth in wages. This view on rates has been continuously repeated by the top echelon at the bank, including Governor Lowe and Deputy Governor Debelle, while board member Harper also suggested that the Bank has a &lsquo;steady as she goes&rsquo; stance on policy, and that a recovery in wage growth will be a long haul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RECENT ECONOMIC DATA: </strong>Q1 Wage Price was softer than expected at 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.6%) which limits scope for the RBA to begin hiking rates considering the central bank has cited slow wages as a factor for the subdued inflation. In addition, Capital Expenditure for Q1 (0.4% vs. Exp. 1.0%) and Building Approvals for April (1.9% vs. Exp. 4.1%) have also fallen short of estimates. Conversely, jobs data was more encouraging with better than expected Employment Change (Apr) 22.6k vs. Exp. 20.0k (Prev. 4.9k, Rev. -0.7k) and although the unemployment rate unexpectedly increased, this coincided with a higher Participation Rate and there was an overall better quality of jobs growth as it was solely fuelled by Full-Time work. There was also more recent data released at the start of the week in which Retail Sales, Company Profits and Business Inventories topped estimates which could provide some encouragement ahead of the GDP number this Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MARKET REACTION: </strong>The announcement is scheduled for 0530BST and is not expected to have a major impact on markets with the RBA unanimously expected to keep policy on hold as they have been doing since 2016. However, participants will still be eyeing the policy statement for any deviation from the central banks regular statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RECENT BANK CALLS: </strong>CBA pushed back forecasts for RBA rate hike to February 2019 from Prev. forecast of November 2018. NAB pushed back RBA rate hike forecast to mid-2019 from Prev. forecast of November 2018.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities up, Treasuries down, DXY soft, Crude down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Trump doubles-down on tough trade talk; US Factory Orders miss; UK Construction PMI surprise beat.<br />* AHEAD: RBA Rate Decision, Chinese, Japanese Services PMI overnight // EZ &amp; UK Services PMI, US ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI, BoE&#39;s Cunliffe, ECB&rsquo;s Weidmann to speak, API inventories on Tuesday.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS: </strong>Early in the session, US President Trump tweeting that it is &ldquo;Not acceptable!&rdquo; that China levies a 16% tax on soybeans and Canada imposes limits on agricultural products. He then accused Mexico, China, Canada and others of treating US farmers &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; adding that things will change by the time trade talks come to an end. Trump also stated that the US can only win after so many years of bad trade deals. EU Trade Chief Malmstrom said the EU is examining safeguards of steel and aluminium and said the first measures could take place in July; she added US car tariffs would be very unfortunate, with potentially even bigger EU counter measures than in steel and aluminium. Malmstrom also claimed that if the US wants to stop the WTO dispute system, they are on the right path, adding that the US has not been willing to work with the EU on this matter. Malmstrom also floated that there could be a possible &lsquo;Plan B&rsquo; to unblock WTO dispute settlement, but stated they are not there yet. UK PM May spokesperson said PM May told US President Trump they are seeking an EU wide exemption on tariffs whilst UK Trade Minister Liam Fox said the response to US tariffs must be examined, adding the UK is to take safeguard measures to prevent steel dumping in the country, which could be in place by the middle of July. Elsewhere, Mexico announced it will start a dispute settlement process at the WTO over tariffs. Finally, ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny, at the EU conference in Vienna, did not touch on monetary policy but urged the EU to be united on trade issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE SPEAK: </strong>BoE&rsquo;s Tenreyo (Neutral) said a few rate rises are needed, though the timing is an open question; she expects gradual tightening of monetary policy will be need over the next three years. Only a slight tweak in language from her previous comments, but not leaning back on the notion of tigher policy ahead, she added that weakness in UK economy in Q1 likely to be erratic but does raise the possibility of some underlying weakness in demand. Likely FX pass through effect on inflation will fade slightly faster than expected, Tenreyro believes, arguing that a tightening of UK labour market is likely to lead to an increase in domestic cost pressures. Future policy changes can act as substitutes for immediate change, she said, and on recent political events, Tenreyro suggested that the uncertainties in Europe mean that the BoE must remain watchful. She said it is too early to say, when asked about signals coming from UK economic data since the MPC meeting in May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May is said to have told business leaders a decision on the preferred customs option post-Brexit was &#39;imminent&#39;, sources reported; some business leaders said a frictionless border was more important than tariffs, after the UK leaves the EU, adding they need to be able to add foreign labour following the exit. The In early trade, it was announced the EU withdrawal bill is expected to come back to the Commons on June 12th at 12.30BST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.4%&nbsp;, NDX +0.9%, DJI +0.7%.&nbsp;</strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +1.1%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: 0.8%, Energy: -0.9%, Financials: +0.3%, Health Care: +0.4%, Industrials: -0.1%, Materials: +0.6%, Telecoms: -0.1%, Tech: +0.8%, Utilities: -0.9%</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>At the ASCO conference over the weekend, where many healthcare names provided updates/results on their studies, Merck (MRK) announced significant improvements for its Keytruda cancer drug, and accordingly outperformed the healthcare sector on Monday. However, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) released data on its cancer immunotherapy which saw mixed results, resulting in NKTR hitting intraday lows of ~40%, and BMY lower by 5%. Retailers performed well today with Walmart (WMT) acquiring a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, subject to regulatory approval, where it forecasts a slight benefit to EPS next fiscal year, WMT led the DJI today with gains of roughly 2.5%. Over in the SPX Under Armour (UA) and target (TGT) outperformed also. Apple (AAPL) rose to fresh intraday record highs before its worldwide Developers Conference, and traders booked profits. At the WWDC CEO Tim Cook said Apple has paid out USD 30bln to iPhone app developers in the last year; total developer earnings from the tech giant are expected to hit USD 100bln this week. He also noted the new iOS 12 operating system will focus on performance, including battery life and quicker apps access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A NEWS: </strong>Relatively light today but we did get an update regarding Monsanto (MON) and Bayer (BAYN GY) where the latter announced a USD 7bln cash call in order to finance its USD 62.5bln takeover of Monsanto, and it is said to close the deal on Thursday this week.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (JUL 2018) SETTLE USD 1.06 LOWER AT USD 64.75/BBL, BRENT FUTURES (AUG 2018) SETTLE USD 1.50 LOWER AT USD 75.29/BBL. </strong>Oil price prices started the week on the back foot amid continued rising crude production rates in the US and after the unofficial OPEC+ meeting over the weekend in Kuwait continued to signal an unwillingness to ease restrictions, with members and non-members agreeing on the need to balance global oil supply (NOTE: Russia &ndash; who has called for supply curbs to be eased &ndash; was not present). On Monday, Russia&rsquo;s economy minister said he sees crude averaging between $65-$70 this year; meanwhile, Russian oil production was unchanged in May at around 10.97mln BPD; recent reports have also suggested that Rosneft has been testing lifting its crude supply by 70k BPD, in the event that supply restrictions are lifted. Elsewhere, Iran oil exports have hit a post-sanctions era high of 2.7mln BPD in May, according to reports; Iran has added over 1mln BPD barrels of supply when sanctions were lifted in 2015. In analyst chatter, volatility is likely to remain in place in the next three weeks ahead of the official OPEC+ meeting in Vienna on June 22nd where output cuts will be in focus, analysts at PVM said. Goldman Sachs said strong oil demand continued in March at 2.6% YY, above its forecast for 1% YY.&nbsp; Goldman continues to forecast 1.8mln BPD growth in 2018, above IEA forecast of 1.4mln BPD. Analysts forecast crude stocks will draw by 2.5mln in the week; Cushing stocks are seen building by 210k (from 29/May) and a draw of around 70k (from 25/May); products are seen building in the week, by 800k and 400k for distillate and gasoline, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) SETTLED 11 TICKS LOWER AT 119-26+. </strong>Treasuries were lower on Monday as political turmoil settled in Europe following last week&rsquo;s events in Italy and Spain. Yields were higher but off their multi-year peaks as trade fear remains in investors&rsquo; minds. Volume in the complex was average in a quiet session; the yield curve saw some modest bear flattening with 2yr and 5yr yields higher by c.4bps and 30yr higher by c.3bps, but major spreads across the curve were pretty much unchanged at settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>Some suggested it was trade concerns weighing on the buck, others suggested that the generally better risk tone was the driver, while there was also talk of booking some of the post-payroll profits. Next week&rsquo;s FOMC is now coming into focus, where the central bank is expected to hike the FFR corridor by 25bps; however, attention will be on the terminal rate, which is likely to be a bigger driver of the USD.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>now that the mini Eurozone crisis seems to have abated, the theme is &lsquo;stabilisation&rsquo;, with many desks now suggesting that lows seen last week above 1.15 may be a short-term bottom. The single currency was happy to range between around 1.1650-1.1750 in Monday trade, though the bias was to the downside when US traders for to their desks; stops have been cited above the range. In terms of Monday&rsquo;s drivers, there was little after a dismal Sentix report, with the analyst community more focussed on Angela Merkel&rsquo;s vision for European reforms going forward, which do not seem as aggressive as those outlined by French President Macron last year; Commerzbank has suggested now that the euphoria that followed EUR after Macron won last year looks unjustified, and it is time for FX markets to begin pricing this out of the currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Brexit headlines are now back in fashion, with the UK set to unveil its white paper on its desired relationship with the EU &ldquo;imminently&rdquo; according to reports on Monday. It was also announced that the EU Withdrawal Bill will come back to the lower House next week (12/Jun), a session where some 15 amendments will be discussed. On Monday, the slide in GBP stabilised around 1.33; some are beginning to note that sterling has fallen a long way over the last couple of months without any notable retracement, and some have suggested the &lsquo;buy-the-dip&rsquo; region may sit around 1.33. Comments from BOE&rsquo;s Tenreyro in late European trade did little to help sterling bounce, as she more-or-less maintained her stance that policy is contingent on incoming data, and there is still scope for patience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The yen was sold overnight after decent Aussie data, helping risk sentiment following a solid payrolls report last week. The 109.75-80 region has been touted as key resistance, and for the most part, it behaved so on Monday. A break opens the way to the 200dMA around 110.20, and then to 111.00, technicians say. Action in <strong>EURCHF </strong>has been more dogged, with the pair consolidating around the 1.15 region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>The antipodeans put in a solid shift on Monday, with the Aussie breaking through resistance at around 0.7650 after solid retail sales overnight. Overnight, the RBA policy meeting is likely to be a snooze fest, with money markets seeing no action for the central bank until the second half of next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* MXN: </strong>The EMFX was performing well amid a firmer risk tone, with the exception of the Mexican peso, which was the notable underperformer in the complex. The weakness came as a result of a double-whammy of unfavourable NAFTA developments (Trump&rsquo;s comments about doing a deal with Mexico and Canada separately &ndash; comments made last week &ndash; continue to add uncertainty as the viable window to reaching a deal gets narrower) as well as election polls (AMLO&rsquo;s poll lead has extended and he is now polling at 50%, according to one poll, up from 46%; support for the more market friendly Anaya, meanwhile, slipped).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: RBA RATE DECISION TO BE PUBLISHED ON 5 JUNE AT 0530 BST/0030 EDT. </strong>RBA is expected to hold its cash rate at 1.50%; market reaction expected to be limited. Expectations are one-sided for the central bank to keep policy on hold. This has been reflected in the ASX 30-Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures, which price in 100% expectations for the central bank to keep the Cash Rate Target unchanged at the record low 1.50%, while the associated implied yield curve suggests June 2019 as the earliest date for when the central bank would be leaning more towards a 25bps rate hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CENTRAL BANK OF TURKEY RATE DECISION TO BE PUBLISHED ON 7 JUNE AT 1200 BST. </strong>The consensus view expects the CBT to hold its one-week repo rate at 16.50%, after its recent tweaks to its policy framework, where it has made the benchmark rate its one-week repo rate (previously it was the late liquidity window), hiking the rate by 300bps to 16.50%, and keeping a symmetric overnight corridor around the repo-rate of 150bps for the overnight borrowing and lending rates. Even after an emergency rate hike and a &lsquo;simplification&rsquo; of its policy framework, some analysts continue to expect rates to be lifted further, as the central bank attempts to regain its inflation targeting credibility, and bring inflation of nearly 13% YY to its 5% target.</p>\r\n",

Aud/Usd currently around 0.7650 vs a circa 0.7665 peak and 0.7555 pre-Aussie data low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi has gradually unwound some of its underperformance vs the Aud as the cross drifts down from the high 1.0800 area and Nzd/Usd nudged up towards 0.7050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best G10 currency and advancing further above 1.1700 to pick off some spec offers at 1.1740, but holding below 1.1750 amidst more supply said to be layered and with 1.1752 representing a key Fib, while 1.1751 also forms resistance on a daily chart. Note, stops above 1.1760 remained untouched as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie and Franc are also ending firmer vs the Usd, and the former tested 1.2900 despite more critique from the US over Canada&rsquo;s policies and behaviour over lumber and dairy exports. Usd/Chf has slipped back towards the base of a 0.9830-95 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrowly mixed vs the Dollar, with Cable unable to breach 1.3400 in wake of a 2nd UK PMI beat as the construction headline masked weak new orders, while Usd/Jpy remained relatively rangebound between 109.35-75 and flanked by hefty option expiries either side (108.90-109.05/110.00).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY/SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All relatively strong, with the Lira inflated by rising Turkish price data (headline and core CPI, plus PPI) that could see the CBRT hike rates this week against the consensus for the new official 1 week repo to remain unchanged (see headline feed for more on Thursday&rsquo;s policy meeting). Usd/Try around 4.6000. Meanwhile, the Scandi crowns both appreciated vs the Eur again on relative Riksbank/Norges Bank hawkishness vs the ECB, with Eur/Sek down around 10.2500 and Eur/Nok near 9.5000, but with the latter potentially carrying upside seasonal risks due to tight bank liquidity during June.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.4%) were both positive from the get-go with CYBG shares leading the advances in Australia after the Co. sweetened its merger bid for Virgin Money, while the Japanese benchmark was among the outperformers as it coat-tails on a weaker currency. Hang Seng (+1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) also conformed to the broad upbeat sentiment following a net liquidity injection by the PBoC and amid reports that China widened the collateral for its Medium-term Lending Facility which will include qualified credit bonds. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lacklustre amid a similar performance in T-notes and with demand subdued by risk appetite, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement also failed to support as the central bank maintained its purchase amounts across the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 20bln via 7-day and CNY 20bln via 28-day reverse repos for a net daily injection of CNY 20bln.

Coupled with broadly risk-on sentiment on the back of Friday&rsquo;s upbeat US jobs report and geopolitical news (June 12 summit between US and NK back on track), which offset another US-China summit ending without anything tangible in terms of import tariff trade-offs, Aud/Usd has finally established a firmer foothold above 0.7600 and breached chart resistance through 0.7605-13 incorporating the 50 DMA (0.7610). Aud buyers are now testing 0.7643-60 that encompasses a key Fib and a chart channel, but the bout of strength may not be greeted with enthusiasm by the RBA on Tuesday given recent policy statements highlighting the adverse impact of a strong currency on the growth, wage and inflation outlook. Note, the latest GDP update follows hot on the heels of the RBA policy meeting on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is just holding off the Eur and Cad as 2nd best major vs the Usd, and largely on the coat-tails of its antipodean counterpart as Nzd/Usd regains 0.7000+ status, but Aud/Nzd bounces firmly towards 1.0900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted above, both firmer vs the Greenback with the single currency re-testing recent highs above 1.1700 in wake of some clarity on the Italian and Spanish political fronts, while the Loonie continues to benefit from last week&rsquo;s more upbeat BoC economic assessments and less cautious policy guidance that has overshadowed much weaker than forecast Q1 GDP annualised growth. Usd/Cad hovering just above 1.2900 vs last week&rsquo;s circa 1.3000 peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also gaining at the expense of the Dollar with Cable around 1.3380, and the Franc at the lower end of a 0.9835-95 range. Note, &nbsp;no immediate reaction in the Pound to another UK PMI beat as the construction headline was tainted by a contraction in new orders, but Cable did subsequently test 1.3400 before easing back again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Jpy nearer the base of a 109.45-75 band, with offers seen above 109.90 according to market observers and big option expiries also keeping the headline pair in check (1.7 bn at the 110.00 strike vs 1.4 bn between 108.90-109.05).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index is pivoting 94.000 having failed to derive any lasting benefit from Friday&rsquo;s strong NFP release, as the key wage component continues to lag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both outpacing the Eur on recent firm Scandi data that supports more hawkish Riksbank and Norges Bank rate outlooks vs the ECB, but the Nok may be hampered somewhat by bearish seasonals and tight liquidity constraints per Nordea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Off worst levels prompted by Moody&rsquo;s ratings downgrade alert for Turkey as a pick up in inflations underpins CBRT rate hike prospects for this Thursday.

Turning to fundamentals, the further advance in BTPs through 130.00 and a fair resistance point at 130.20 to 130.28 has weighed heavier on Bunds while position-rolling from June to September continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.7%) and Brent (-1.4%) prices have thus far failed to significantly rebound from the losses seen at the back end of last week after shedding more than 9.9% from the multi-year high levels, while the unofficial OPEC+ meeting during the weekend also continued to signal an unwillingness to ease restrictions. Prices were also subdued by the weekly Baker Hughes rig count showing an increase of 2 oil rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (+0.1%) is uneventful while shanghai copper hits highs of more than six weeks, underpinned by a marginally softer dollar and labour negotiations at the world&rsquo;s largest copper mine. Dalian iron ore however fell almost 2% as it moved in tandem with steel prices amid the iron ore stockpiles at China&rsquo;s port surging to record levels.</p>\r\n",

Note, the latest GDP update follows hot on the heels of the RBA policy meeting on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is just holding off the Eur and Cad as 2nd best major vs the Usd, and largely on the coat-tails of its antipodean counterpart as Nzd/Usd regains 0.7000+ status, but Aud/Nzd bounces firmly towards 1.0900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted above, both firmer vs the Greenback with the single currency re-testing recent highs above 1.1700 in wake of some clarity on the Italian and Spanish political fronts, while the Loonie continues to benefit from last week&rsquo;s more upbeat BoC economic assessments and less cautious policy guidance that has overshadowed much weaker than forecast Q1 GDP annualised growth. Usd/Cad hovering just above 1.2900 vs last week&rsquo;s circa 1.3000 peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/JPY&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All pretty flat vs the Dollar with Cable around 1.3360, the Franc in the middle of a 0.9855-95 range and Usd/Jpy nearer the base of a 109.45-75 band, with offers seen above 109.90 according to market observers and big option expiries also keeping the headline pair in check (1.7 bn at the 110.00 strike vs 1.4 bn between 108.90-109.05). Back to the Pound, no reaction to another UK PMI beat as the construction headline was tainted by a contraction in new orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index is pivoting 94.000 having failed to derive any lasting benefit from Friday&rsquo;s strong NFP release, as the key wage component continues to lag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both outpacing the Eur on recent firm Scandi data that supports more hawkish Riksbank and Norges Bank rate outlooks vs the ECB, but the Nok may be hampered somewhat by bearish seasonals and tight liquidity constraints per Nordea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Off worst levels prompted by Moody&rsquo;s ratings downgrade alert for Turkey as a pick up in inflations underpins CBRT rate hike prospects for this Thursday.

Meanwhile, Gilts stretched their Liffe best to 122.95, but could not seriously challenge 123.00 and then reversed on another UK PMI beat, albeit with new orders contracting again and nullifying the firm headline to an extent. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are hugging overnight session lows and steepening somewhat after Friday&rsquo;s post-NFP bear curve flattening, as the focus shifts to factory orders.</p>\r\n",
