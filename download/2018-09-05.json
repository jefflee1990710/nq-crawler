However, a German government spokesperson later stated the position on Brexit is unchanged and that they have full faith in Barnier, while UK PM May&#39;s spokesman stated that parliament will need to be able to make an informed decision when asked whether the UK was willing to accept a more vague statement on future relation with EU. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Chancellor Merkel&#39;s CSU allies stated in a draft document that the ECB should end its QE programme ASAP and that they want to end ECB&#39;s low interest rate policy, while Merkel&rsquo;s CSU allies also stated they want a close partnership with the UK post-Brexit and that they reject a hard Brexit.

(Newswires)<br />BoC stated that recent data reinforces its assessment that higher rates will be warranted to achieve inflation target and that they will continue to take a gradual approach guided by incoming data.

Energy stocks also dragged on equity indices, tracking crude prices lower on Wednesday after Haliburton (HAL) CEO warned on profit, which also weighed on Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHGE). US President Trump took aim at Nike (NKE) after its new ad campaign, which features controversial football player Colin Kaepernick, and said Nike is getting &ldquo;killed with boycotts&rdquo;. US DOJ nearing anti-trust approval of health mergers between CVS (CVS) and Aetna (AET), and the USD 54bln deal between Cigna (CIG) and Express Scripts (ESRX), WSJ reported citing sources; the Cigna/Express Scripts deal could come without the government requiring companies to sell off any assets, WSJ said.

Trade talks between Canada and the USA resumed on Wednesday, with Canada&#39;s foreign minister looking anticipating constructive talks, stating that she believes that a trilateral deal is possible. Politico reported that the US and Canada are aiming to have talks wrapped up by the end of the month. Elsewhere, USTR Lighthizer is set to meet with his EU counterpart Malmstrom on 10 September to discuss cutting trade tariffs between the EU and the US, the first high-level meeting between the two nations since EU President Juncker visited Washington in July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US INTERNATIONAL TRADE: </strong>The deficit widened to $50.1bln in June &ndash; a five-month high &ndash; from a revised $45.7bln previously. &quot;The underlying picture is not as bad as the headline,&quot; Pantheon Macroeconomics said. &quot;The civilian aircraft surplus fell by a hefty $1.6B, accounting for more than a third of the increase in the headline deficit, but it is very erratic and will likely rebound in August.&quot; The consultancy noted other drags on the July figures, with soybean exports falling (the unwind of the surge triggered after China&#39;s advance notice that it would impose tariffs on US beans from 6 July). &quot;Behind all the noise, the core story here is that strong domestic demand is sucking in imports, offsetting the gains in exports,&quot; Pantheon said, &quot;the trade deficit likely will be flat-to-higher over the next couple of months, reversing most or all of the second quarter&#39;s drop, which the President has cited as evidence of the success of his trade policies. It wasn&#39;t.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>The Bank of Canada held rates at 1.50%, as was expected, and left the door open to a 25bps rate hike at its October meeting, where it will also update its economic forecasts. The Bank stuck to its data-dependent policy, and again said that higher rates will be warranted ahead, though any moves will be gradual. Once again, NAFTA risks were identified, and the economy is progressing in line with its July MPR forecasts. &quot;We see the statement as consistent with a third hike for the year in October,&quot; RBC&#39;s analysts said. &quot;While there is not an explicit &#39;nod&#39; to it in the statement, the BoC under Poloz is not keen on forward guidance as a regular policy tool.&quot; RBC also points out that the final paragraph of its statement stated&nbsp; that &#39;recent data reinforce Governing Council&rsquo;s assessment that higher interest rate will be warranted&#39;, and combined with its &#39;gradual approach&#39; phrase, RBC says is consistent with another move in October. Traders will receive more colour tomorrow, when BoC&#39;s Wilkins releases the economic progress report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (dove, non-voter) Tuesday once again warned against aggressive rate rises, suggesting that it could play a role in EM turmoil, like in Turkey. Kashkari also warned aggressive rate hikes risks pushing the US into recession. Fed&#39;s Bullard (dove, non-voter) repeated his familiar warnings about raising rates too aggressively, arguing that there are elevated risks of a policy error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Germany and the UK were said to have dropped key demands on Brexit, and are said to seek less detail on future ties. There was a notable spike in GBP on the headlines. Later, a German government spokesperson said that the official position of the German government remains unchanged on Brexit, and Germany has full faith in the EU&#39;s rexit negotiator Barnier. Nevertheless, the tone out of Germany over the last couple of days has been positive, even though it has warned that there is still a chance of a no-deal Brexit; UK PM May also told lawmakers that it is &#39;right and proper&#39; to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, though UK is continuing to work for a good deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>After governor Carney on Tuesday hinted that he may be willing to stay on at the Bank of England till 2020, the FT reports that PM May has endorsed such a move. GBP reacted positively to Carney&#39;s hints on Tuesday, and the rationale is that extending his stay at the helm of the BOE will allow future candidates for the role of governor to have more clarity about Brexit before taking the role on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.3% AT 2889, DJIA +0.1% AT 25976, NDX -1.3% AT 7523. SECTORS: ENERGY -0.1%, MATERIALS +0.6%, INDUSTRIALS +0.6%, CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY -1.1%, CONSUMER STAPLES +1.2%, HEALTHCARE +0.3%, FINANCIALS +0.1%, IT -1.5%, TELECOMS +0.8%, UTILITIES +1.3%. </strong>As Facebook COO and Twitter CEO testified to lawmakers in Congress, social media shares were hit, and led the tech sector lower, which also coincided with broader selling of equities in the late US morning; some had suggested that this was further evidence of a defensive rotation out of tech, and into more safer sectors. Energy stocks also dragged on equity indices, tracking crude prices lower on Wednesday after Haliburton (HAL) CEO warned on profit, which also weighed on Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHGE). US President Trump took aim at Nike (NKE) after its new ad campaign, which features controversial football player Colin Kaepernick, and said Nike is getting &ldquo;killed with boycotts&rdquo;. US DOJ nearing anti-trust approval of health mergers between CVS (CVS) and Aetna (AET), and the USD 54bln deal between Cigna (CIG) and Express Scripts (ESRX), WSJ reported citing sources; the Cigna/Express Scripts deal could come without the government requiring companies to sell off any assets, WSJ said. JD.com was slammed for a second day after its CEO is accused of rape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLED $1.15 LOWER AT $68.72/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLED $0.90 LOWER AT $77.27/BBL. </strong>After knocking around YTD highs, crude has given back some of the gains on Wednesday. Concerns over Tropical Storm Gordon saw prices firm on Tuesday, but as the storm hit landfall with little drama, crude eased, leaving the market to focus on the broader theme of tightening OPEC supplies in the latter part of the year as Iranian sanctions come into effect, which some suggest could remove more than the 1mln BPD seen during the previous rounds of sanctions. Analysts at PVM, however, said that &quot;in spite of this bullish backdrop, doubts over the staying power of the current rally have started to emerge. Specifically, questions are being asked as to how much more headway oil can make into positive territory given the already-heightened price environment.&rdquo; PVM also noted that the stronger dollar was also likely to provide a headwind to crude prices. On that theme of prices, Saudi Arabia is reportedly seeking oil prices between $70-80/bbl as it wants to strike a balance between maximizing revenue and keeping a lid on prices until US congressional elections, Reuters reported citing sources; the story suggests that the Saudis are content with the current crude price action, given it has been trading within that range over the last few months. &quot;We don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s really anything new here, but find it interesting that the story is recirculating after Brent traded as high as $79.72 on Tuesday,&rdquo; Citi said, &ldquo;is this an attempt to reassure consumers or dampen bullish sentiment after the sharp really of the past two weeks or is there a willingness to increase actual supply behind it?&quot; The bank believes that &quot;the market may be entitled to a technical correction after a strong run higher, and in any case, the recovering oil production from the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of Tropical Storm Gordon also provides and excuse. It also says that the market may be seeing profit-taking ahead this week&#39;s inventories: the API reports data after the bell Wednesday, ahead of the DOE report due for release on Thursday, and analysts expect headline crude stocks to draw by 1.3mln barrels, gasoline is expected to draw by 0.8mln, and distillates are seen building by 0.7mln.&nbsp;Finally, OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said the global crude consumption will rise to 100mln BPD later this year, adding that this is much sooner than projected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 1 TICK HIGHER AT 119-30+. </strong>Treasuries were mixed, though ultimately rangebound despite volumes being relatively healthy. The complex was taking its cues from external factors on Wednesday, finding sellers after positive news on the Brexit front pressured FI; although the report was denied, T-Notes remained beneath the levels it was at before the news. Major curve spreads were modestly higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The buck is negative, though has managed to hold on to the 95.00 handle. The buck is seeing some strength vs EMs, however. Analysts at ING are beginning to differentiate the USD&rsquo;s performance against majors and EMs now; against the latter, ING feels it is too early to call a top given the risks associated with trade and foreign policy, but against major FX, the bank believes cyclical forces will start driving the buck lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD:&nbsp;</strong>The Canadian dollar is flat. There was some upside for USDCAD after the BOC stood pat on rates, but the gains were fleeting, and analysts are generally of the view that the door to an October hike is open. It seems as though the BOC, however, is playing second fiddle to headline regarding NAFTA negotiations; while there is no meaningful update yet, negotiators continue to sound positive, with some reports suggesting that policymakers are working to wrap up a deal by the end of the month; 1.32 was breached, though the Loonie has returned back to 1.3180, where it seems comfortable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:&nbsp;</strong>The pound was a top performer on Wednesday, on seemingly positive Brexit-related newsflow, which saw GBP flirt with the 1.30 handle, though was unable to mount any meaningful test. However, after German officials lent back on the story, sterling gave some of the gains back. In the European morning, the pound shrugged-off decent PMI data, reiterating that traders&rsquo; primary focus remains on Brexit headlines.&nbsp; Sterling&rsquo;s moves seemed to also help EUR crosses rise, with the EUR reclaiming 1.16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Overnight, the GDP report for Q2 exceeded analyst expectations, with consumption (one of the RBA&#39;s concerns) held up well, although nominal compensation slowed. Nevertheless, the data was well-received, seeing AUD rally to 0.7220 region, before stalling after Asian equities slid, and China PMIs were soft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMFX:&nbsp;</strong>Fortunes were mixed for the EMFX complex on Wednesday. &nbsp;The ZAR continues to be sold after Tuesday data showed the country entered recession for the first time since 2009, and the rand found fresh two-year lows, as investor sentiment dims with fiscal challenges looming. The Indian rupee was under pressure after finmin said the country is not in the trade war businesses, but when countries devalue FX it has an impact on the rupee, and attributed the INR&rsquo;s slide to global factors. On the other side of the coin, the ARS was higher against the dollar, with bargain hunting being cited, rather than fresh macroeconomic drivers. BRL shrugged-off a weaker PMI data; on Wednesday, it was reported that former Sao Paulo mayor Haddad will replace Lula da Silva as the official presidential candidate for the workers party, with an announcement expected Tuesday.</p>\r\n",

        "analysis_details": "<p>After knocking around YTD highs this week, crude has given back some of the gains on Wednesday. Concerns over Tropical Storm Gordon saw prices firm on Tuesday, but as the storm hit landfall with little drama, crude eased, leaving the market to focus on the broader theme of tightening OPEC supplies in the latter part of the year as Iranian sanctions come into effect, which some suggest could remove more than the 1mln BPD seen during the previous rounds of sanctions. Analysts at PVM, however, said that &quot;in spite of this bullish backdrop, doubts over the staying power of the current rally have started to emerge. Specifically, questions are being asked as to how much more headway oil can make into positive territory given the already-heightened price environment.&rdquo; PVM also noted that the stronger dollar was also likely to provide a headwind to crude prices. On that theme of prices, Saudi Arabia is reportedly seeking oil prices between $70-80/bbl as it wants to strike a balance between maximizing revenue and keeping a lid on prices until US congressional elections, Reuters reported citing sources; the story suggests that the Saudis are content with the current crude price action, given it has been trading within that range over the last few months. &quot;We don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s really anything new here, but find it interesting that the story is recirculating after Brent traded as high as $79.72 on Tuesday,&rdquo; Citi said, &ldquo;is this an attempt to reassure consumers or dampen bullish sentiment after the sharp really of the past two weeks or is there a willingness to increase actual supply behind it?&quot; The bank believes that &quot;the market may be entitled to a technical correction after a strong run higher, and in any case, the recovering oil production from the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of Tropical Storm Gordon also provides and excuse. It also says that the market may be seeing profit-taking ahead this week&#39;s inventory data. The API will report energy inventory data after the bell Wednesday, ahead of the DOE report due for release on Thursday; this week, analysts expect headline crude stocks to draw down by 1.3mln barrels, gasoline is expected to draw by 0.8mln, and distillates are seen building by 0.7mln barrels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Although news of the apparent more flexible stance on both sides came via anonymous sources, the absence of a denial and cordial comments from German Chancellor Merkel etc of late suggest that there may be some substance or gravitas to the social media tweets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A major beneficiary of the Sterling revival, as the single currency reclaimed 1.1600+ status vs the Greenback and eventually found its footing on the cross, with the headline pair back to within striking distance of big option expiry interest (2.2 bn from 1.1610-25) around the time of the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi continued to outflank its antipodean peer on the usual premise that the Aud has more to lose from a more intense US vs China trade spat, as the clock ticks down to potentially $200 bn more import tariffs on Chinese goods. Nzd/Usd extended its comeback from 2018/multi-year lows to just over 0.6575, while Aud/Usd remained capped ahead of 0.7200 and Aud/Nzd retreated further below overnight highs over 1.1000 (after stronger than forecast Aussie GDP data) towards 1.0900 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie only derived modest and brief support from better than expected Canadian trade data and BoC policy guidance maintaining gradual and data-dependent tightening before Usd/Cad rebounded towards 1.3200 ahead of the next round of NAFTA talks (mentioned among threats to the economic outlook in the post-meeting accompanying statement).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amidst more widespread depreciation across the region (and not just contained to currencies), the Zar continues to underperform and extend losses in wake of the &lsquo;unexpected&rsquo; Q2 GDP contraction that consigned SA to a first half 2018 recession. Moreover, August&rsquo;s PMI sank further below the 50.0 threshold to flag ongoing negative economic activity, and the Rand still has next month&rsquo;s budget update to contend with. Usd/Zar has been just over 15.6900, but currently off worst levels sub-15.5000, while the Rub, Mxn and Try also remain on the back foot, with the Cnh retreating as well after recent relative stability and no doubt eyeing the looming threat of additional US import tariffs.</p>\r\n",

Moreover, August&rsquo;s PMI sank further below the 50.0 threshold to flag ongoing negative economic activity, and the Rand still has next month&rsquo;s budget update to contend with. Usd/Zar has been just over 15.6900, but currently off worst levels around 15.6000, while the Rub, Mxn and Try also remain on the back foot, with the Cnh retreating as well after recent relative stability and no doubt eyeing the looming threat of additional US import tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The Pound is lagging G10 counterparts even though the UK services PMI broke the run of disappointing surveys with an unexpected beat vs consensus, with Cable down through 1.2800 again and Eur/Gbp firmly over 0.9000 to retest key chart resistance. The rationale, more reports that chief EU Brexit negotiator Barnier flatly rejects the Chequers White Paper that UK PM May and Raab are resolutely sticking to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAJORS - Sterling aside, the Dollar&rsquo;s main currency rivals are holding up relatively well, and especially the Kiwi around 0.6550 having slipped to a fresh low overnight. The Aud has gleaned some support from better than expected GDP data, but remains unable to retain a firm or lasting grasp of 0.7200, while the Jpy is back near 111.50 having weakened a tad further to circa 111.70 and eyeing a daily cloud base (111.52) on a closing basis for near term direction. Eur/Usd has been choppy between 1.1540-1.1610 amidst broadly in line Eurozone services PMIs and also pivotal around a key tech level (30 DMA at 1.1568), while the Loonie awaits the restart of US-Canada NAFTA talks, trade data and the BoC policy meeting with Usd/Cad just below 1.3200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY -The index remains firmly above recent near 95.000 lows and mainly towards the top of a 95.275-675 range, with broad gains vs almost all rivals, as noted above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED</strong> <strong>INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have retreated to a fresh Eurex intraday base of 160.12 (-23 ticks), and seemingly unable to resist the ongoing revival in Italian debt, while relatively firm Eurozone services PMIs, with the odd exception are also weighing. Moreover, market participants and a long-standing client notes decent clips in the soon to expire Sep18 contracts where 10k lots were sold in the 10 year future vs a purchase in Bobls at 162.88 and 132.10 respectively, with the inference from price action that a steepener was implemented. Meanwhile, Gilts and Short Sterling have eased back from best levels on an above forecast UK services PMI, which is perhaps even more surprising given sub-consensus manufacturing and construction headlines yesterday and on Monday.

Hurricane Florance is a little stronger and moving over the open Atlantic, while Hurricane Olivia has weakened slightly, ableit remains a category 3 hurricane. OPEC Secretary General Barkindo emerged this morning, noting the world will attain 100mln BPD of consumption later this year; adding this is &ldquo;much sooner&rdquo; than expected. Furthermore, Lukoil VP Fundun stated Russian oil production has nearly peaked. Traders will be keeping a close eye on any development at the Gulf of Mexico, also of note: the API crude inventories numbers are to be released later today. In the metals complex, gold has found mild reprieve after losing the USD 1200/oz level yesterday while copper is relatively uneventful.

Moreover, market participants and a long-standing client notes decent clips in the soon to expire Sep18 contracts where 10k lots were sold in the 10 year future vs a purchase in Bobls at 162.88 and 132.10 respectively, with the inference from price action that a steepener was implemented.

ASX 200 (-0.8%) declined from the open with broad weakness across its sectors and with firm Q2 GDP data failing to underpin sentiment as the damage had already been done, while Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) was subdued following a destructive and deadly Typhoon which was the strongest to hit Japan in 25 years. Hang Seng (-1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) were also negative on trade-related jitters as the deadline regarding potential US tariffs on USD 200bln of Chinese goods approaches and following disappointing Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI data in which the former posted a 10-month low. Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains amid the backdrop of the widespread risk-averse tone, although price action was relatively muted and stuck within a tight range despite stronger results at this month&rsquo;s 10yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Services PMI (Aug) 51.5 vs. Exp. 52.6 (Prev. 52.8); 10-month low.

Instead the EU has urged PM May to adopt a Canada-style deal favoured by former Foreign Minister Johnson. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Brexit Secretary Raab has stated that he will not &lsquo;roll over&rsquo; and abandon the government&rsquo;s plans to secure a future relationship between the UK and EU despite firm objections from Eurosceptic MPs. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former-Brexit Secretary David Davis is set to throw his weight behind a fully-fledged alternative to the government&rsquo;s Brexit strategy as part of a major intervention ahead of the Conservative party conference. (CityAM)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany Chancellor Merkel said the aim is to reach an agreement with the UK on Brexit but added that the UK cannot enjoy the same rights as EU members post-Brexit. In addition, Merkel stated she will use all of her force and creativity to make sure a deal happens and that she does not want discussions with the UK to break down, while she also commented we cannot fully rule out a breakdown of Brexit talks as we still have no result. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU could adjust Irish border backstop to win UK&#39;s approval in Brexit negotiations according to a press report citing a leading EU lawmaker. However, there were also reports from the same news agency that the German government is preparing for all possible Brexit outcomes, regulated or unregulated and urged EU and member states to prepare for a failure in Brexit negotiations. (Stuttgarter Zeitung)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Carney is expected to extend his term until 2020 after support from PM May regarding plans to keep BoE stable amid Brexit. (FT)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback was relatively flat with price action subdued as its major counterparts attempted to nurse losses, which saw EUR/USD test 1.1600 to the upside and GBP/USD marginally extended on its rebound from the prior day&rsquo;s lows amid the ongoing Brexit-related to and fro. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses saw early upside which gained traction as the pair broke through resistance at the 111.50 level and with Gotobi demand observed heading into the Tokyo fix, while AUD/USD initially outperformed and briefly reclaimed the 0.7200 handle following the better than expected GDP data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Real GDP (Q2) Q/Q 0.9% vs. Exp. 0.7% (Prev. 1.0%).

Elsewhere, gold found mild reprieve overnight amid a lacklustre greenback although the precious metal remained below the USD 1200/oz level, while copper remained weak alongside the broad risk averse tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Industry sources stated that Saudi Arabia is seeking to keep oil prices between USD 70/bbl-80/bbl and that Trump intervention forced Saudi to moderate its price target, while non-Gulf OPEC members were also said to target oil at USD 60/bbl-80/bbl. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is likely to tell US that it will not be able to reduce oil imports from Iran. (ET)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NHC said the centre of Tropical Storm Gordon made landfall just west of the Alabama-Mississippi border, while it had earlier commented that the storm strengthened a little as it approached the north-central Gulf Coast. NHC had also previously commented that Gordon was expected to be a hurricane once it made landfall but that rapid weakening is forecast after Gordon moves inland. In related news, reports had noted that 9% of daily crude production was shut in Gulf of Mexico due to Gordon. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Tuesday, as traders returned from the holiday weekend, with 2s30s up by around 2bps at settlement, while other curve spreads were slightly wider. The complex took its cue from BTPs in early European trade, with the Italian deputy PM Salvini again making soothing comments that Italy would stick to the EU&rsquo;s budget rules. Informa reported that there was heavy corporate issuance and the associated rate locking weighed on the long-end of the curve, while central bank buying in the front and medium end contributed to the steepening. Yields were nudged further upwards after a decent ISM print. US T-note futures (z8) settled 3+ ticks higher at 120-08+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (non-voter, dove) stated the Fed are hiking rates too aggressively. In other news, a Fed study noted there was little evidence that major US firms were using benefits from the tax reduction on capex and instead many were increasing their share repurchases.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade lower across the board after the Labor Day hangover on Wall St amid ongoing trade uncertainty and ahead of the looming risk events, although the US majors finished off worst levels and Amazon briefly entered the USD 1tln club. ASX 200 (-0.8%) declined from the open with broad weakness across its sectors and with firm Q2 GDP data failing to underpin sentiment as the damage had already been done, while Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) is subdued following a destructive and deadly Typhoon which was the strongest to hit Japan in 25 years. Hang Seng (-1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.4%) were also negative on trade-related jitters as the deadline regarding potential US tariffs on USD 200bln of Chinese goods approaches and following disappointing Chinese Caixin Services and Composite PMI data in which the former posted a 10-month low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is relatively flat with price action subdued as its major counterparts attempt to nurse losses, with EUR/USD eyeing 1.1600 to the upside and with GBP/USD marginally extending on its rebound from the prior day&rsquo;s lows amid the ongoing Brexit-related to and fro. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are higher with upside gaining traction as the pair broke through resistance at the 111.50 level and with Gotobi demand observed heading into the Tokyo fix, while AUD/USD outperforms and reclaimed the 0.7200 handle following the better than expected GDP data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs saw mild gains amid the backdrop of the widespread risk-averse tone, although price action has been relatively muted and stuck within the prior days&rsquo; tight range ahead of a 10yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
