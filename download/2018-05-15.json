Selling was accelerated before the cash equity day got underway, after a retail sales report painted an upbeat picture of the consumer sector; traders subsequently raised bets on four hikes this year, sending US Treasury yields above 3%, helping the dollar bounce, but piling pressure on the US equities complex (though financials held up slightly better than other sectors as yields ticked higher). ES slipped before eventually finding support at/above 2700 in afternoon trade, In stock specifics: Home Depot (HD) reported earnings that beat on the bottom line but missed on the top, and its same store sales were below estimates, with the company citing weather conditions. Agilent Technologies (A) reported numbers in line with expectations, however, the company lowered its current-quarter and full year forecasts, resulting in the stock underperforming the index.<br />In M&amp;A news, Microchip (MCHP) announced it received antitrust clearance from China, Japan, Austria, Germany and the Philippines for the acquisition of Microsemi (MSCC), but the deal still requires approval from Taiwan Fair Trade Commission. Elsewhere, sources report Qualcomm&rsquo;s (QCOM) proposed USD 44bln takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is still yet to see a solid breakthrough, which is breaking up hopes that the deal would likely see approval at a faster rate. Finally, AT&amp;T&rsquo;s (T) CEO Stephenson is reported to be &lsquo;ready to close&rsquo; the transaction deal with Time Warner (TWX), announcing a final say will be announced on 12 June. SPX -0.71% at 2710, NDX -1.08% at 6888, DJI -0.80% at 24700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were sold in heavy volume on Tuesday amid upbeat retail sales and a slightly more aggressive tone from Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan and Fed&rsquo;s Williams, with heavy corporate supply also adding further downward pressure to the complex. The curve bear-steepened with 2yr yields higher by c.3bps and 30yr yields higher by c.7bps. The10yr yield hit the highest level since May 2011 and took out the April 25th high at 3.033%, 2s30s and 2s10s both widened by c.4bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settled down 20+ ticks lower at 118-19+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li>&nbsp;SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities down, Treasuries down, DXY up, Crude up</li>\r\n  <li>* REAR-VIEW: US-China trade tensions, US retail sales upbeat, lots of Fedspeak</li>\r\n  <li>* AHEAD: Japanese GDP and Australian wages (overnight); on Wednesday, US Industrial Production, EU CPI, ECB&#39;s Draghi, Fed&#39;s Bullard and Bostic, CSCO earnings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* TRADE: NEC Director Kudlow said both the US and China should aim at taking down trade barriers, urging the latter to stop forcing intellectual property and technology transfers. He also noted NAFTA and EU are secondary to China trade disputes. On the China front, Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan said the two should rely on negotiation to solve the existing differences and to increase communication. China on Tuesday told a WTO dispute panel that EU&rsquo;s accusations of unfair trading by China could equally be applied to EU&rsquo;s Common Agricultural Policy, or even US corn subsidies. A European Commissioner stated the EU is open for improving the trade relationship with the US, but it is not willing to offer concessions for tariff exemption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* GEOPOLITICS: Iran Nuclear chief told state TV that the EU should make up for the US withdrawal from the deal, or else Tehran will enrich uranium &ldquo;stronger than before.&rdquo; Separately, the Iranian Foreign Minister warned Iran will remain in the nuclear deal if it obtains benefits from it, though wanted to see progress quickly. Elsewhere, the US issued fresh Iran-related sanctions targeted at the Iranian Central chief Sief, and the US Treasury said it is ready to implement further penalties on Russia. On the Korean Peninsula, North Korea suspended high-level talks with South Korea that had been planned for Wednesday in a protest over joint US-South Korean military drills, which it called a &#39;provocation&#39; amid improved North-South ties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* NAFTA: Mexico&#39;s chief negotiator Smith said there is a 70% chance of landing a NAFTA deal before May 30th; On the flip side, Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo does not see a NAFTA deal before Thursday May 17th, the soft deadline set by US House Speaker Ryan. Note, different accounts have reported different versions of the comments from Guajardo, but the official comments appeared to be translated as stated above. Meanwhile, Canada&rsquo;s PM was confident on the progress of NAFTA, but provided little fresh detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*FED SPEAK: Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan (Non-Voter, Neutral) is not set on two or three more hikes this year, and is watching the yield curve. Kaplan said the US could achieve 3% economic growth but it hinges on labour participation and productivity; Kaplan forecasts US growth to be between 2.50% and 2.75% in 2018, but sees it slowing to 1.75% to 2.0% by 2020 . He sees the neutral rate between 2.5%-3.0%, and again said it is the right thing for Fed to &quot;move towards neutral.&rdquo; He noted inflation is approaching 2% and is &quot;not running away from us&quot;. Finally, he will support Fed&#39;s balanced approach to employment and inflation aims. Fed&rsquo;s Williams (Voter, Hawkish) said `gradual rate rises are in the right direction for policy, but he remains conscious that rates will remain lower versus historical levels. Three or four hikes is in the right ballpark, he said, as he expects the US economy to grow around 2.5% per annum with tailwinds from fiscal stimulus and global growth. He is not ready to declare &#39;mission accomplished&#39; on inflation, as he wants to see it sustained around the 2% target, but he is not worried if it overshoots its target by a few tenths. He added the economy continues to strengthen, but warned that if the economy underperforms the Fed will go slower. Finally he claimed guidance on &lsquo;accommodative&rsquo; policy may need to be tweaked at some point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*DATA: &nbsp;US Retail Sales rose by 0.3% in April as expected and were revised higher to 0.8%. Retail sales ex-autos also ticked up and saw an upward revision to the prior data. Overall, because of the revisions, the numbers appear better than expected with analysts at Pantheon seeing these figures adding +0.2% to Q1 GDP. Food and energy sales were partially higher due to sustained prices. Analysts at ING noted that the latest sales data is much clearer as it begins to filter out distortions caused by hurricanes which largely encouraged more spending by forcing consumers to replace their lost items. Nonetheless, ING expects consumer spending to remain sustained amid the economy&rsquo;s current situation. With higher employment, wages and impetus from the fiscal stimulus, it sees GDP growth at 3%. Business Inventories were left unchanged in March after four consecutive increases following a remarkable rise in sales. The breakdown showed a 0.5% fall in retail stocks offset by a 0.3% increase in manufacturer and wholesaler stocks. Analysts at Oxford Economics expect firms to keep slim inventories throughout 2018 whilst Wells Fargo anticipates inventories to grow again in Q2 and continued investment growth which should encourage firms to fill up inventories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.71% at 2710, NDX -1.08% at 6888, DJI -0.80% at 24700.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTORS:&nbsp;Cons Cyclicals: -0.74%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.67%, Energy: -0.16%, Financials: -0.63%, Health Care: -1.47%, Industrials: -0.56%, Materials: -0.53%, Technology: -1.31%, Telecoms: -0.99%, Utilities: -1.16%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Overnight, there was a slight downward bias in US equity futures, following a weak close on Wall Street on Monday, and equity weakness in Asia. Selling was accelerated before the cash equity day got underway, after a retail sales report painted an upbeat picture of the consumer sector; traders subsequently raised bets on four hikes this year, sending US Treasury yields above 3%, helping the dollar bounce, but piling pressure on the US equities complex (though financials held up slightly better than other sectors as yields ticked higher). ES slipped before eventually finding support at/above 2700 in afternoon trade,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* In stock specifics: Home Depot (HD) reported earnings that beat on the bottom line but missed on the top, and its same store sales were below estimates, with the company citing weather conditions. Agilent Technologies (A) reported numbers in line with expectations, however, the company lowered its current-quarter and full year forecasts, resulting in the stock underperforming the index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* In M&amp;A news, Microchip (MCHP) announced it received antitrust clearance from China, Japan, Austria, Germany and the Philippines for the acquisition of Microsemi (MSCC), but the deal still requires approval from Taiwan Fair Trade Commission. Elsewhere, sources report Qualcomm&rsquo;s (QCOM) proposed USD 44bln takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is still yet to see a solid breakthrough, which is breaking up hopes that the deal would likely see approval at a faster rate. Finally, AT&amp;T&rsquo;s (T) CEO Stephenson is reported to be &lsquo;ready to close&rsquo; the transaction deal with Time Warner (TWX), announcing a final say will be announced on 12 June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* CRUDE: WTI futures settle 35 cents higher at USD 71.31/bbl, Brent futures settle 20 cents higher at USD 78.43/bbl. Crude was sold off heavily from near multi-year highs on the back of USD strength (begotten by sharply rising yields), with WTI dropping from just beneath $72 before stabilising beneath $70.40. Brent enjoyed another session of out-performance vs its US counterpart, albeit very slight, underpinned by lingering geopolitical tensions in the Middle East (Iran has again threatened to begin enriching uranium if the JCPOA deal is fully scrapped). Firmer demand conditions are also being cited for some of the gains, after OPEC upgraded its view of global demand growth in its MOMR released on Monday (to +140k BPD) amid a continued decline in OECD commercial stocks. Elsewhere, China refinery throughputs were up by just shy of 12% YY in April to 12.06mln BPD, the second highest on record. Norway raised its 2018 oil price projections by 18% to $64.70 per barrel. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan output between Jan-Apr rose 5.9% YY. After the bell, API reports weekly inventory data, which analysts expect to show a headline draw of 1.5mln barrels, though cushing could see a small build (+65k according to Genscape&rsquo;s forecast released on Monday), distillates are seen drawing 1.8mln, gasoline is seen drawing by 1.1mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* TREASURIES:&nbsp;US 10yr T-Notes futures settled down 20+ ticks lower at 118-19+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were sold in heavy volume on Tuesday amid upbeat retail sales and a slightly more aggressive tone from Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan and Fed&rsquo;s Williams, with heavy corporate supply also adding further downward pressure to the complex. The curve bear-steepened with 2yr yields higher by c.3bps and 30yr yields higher by c.7bps. The10yr yield hit the highest level since May 2011 and took out the April 25th high at 3.033%, 2s30s and 2s10s both widened by c.4bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* FOREX: USD: The buck reigned supreme on Tuesday, with the dollar hitting fresh YTD highs, largely taking their cue from Treasury yields, which pushed ahead to fresh multi-year highs. The impact of the buck&rsquo;s strength was particularly evident against EMFX, where the currencies with high external funding requirements were again routed (TRY was whipped again after President Erdogan suggested he would play a more active role in monetary policy should he win re-election); the Argentine ARS was the exception, rising c.3% vs the USD after the central bank sold dollars in spot markets for another day, as well as a NDF operation. The dollar also weighed on gold pushing the precious price below 1300 for the first time since December. &nbsp;&nbsp;The DXY almost got to 93.500 and the next strong chart resistance around 93.522, which appears almost a formality as the 10 year US yield extends its gains above 3% to fresh multi-year peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR, JPY, CHF: the bias was to the downside for the single currency after German GDP and industrial production miss, and an in-line prelim estimate of EZ GDP did nothing to shake the notion that economic momentum in the Eurozone is waning. Couple that with rising US yields helping to widen the differential between US/Germany, and a US retail sales report which saw significant revisions to past data, and EUR sank through support around 1.119, printing lows near 1.1820, before creeping up slightly (but remaining beneath 1.19). The USD strength, underpinned by a steeper Treasury curve helped drive USDJPY above its 200 dma (110.17); though the Swissy couldn&rsquo;t push on fresh YTD highs, and was relatively unchanged.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP: Sterling couldn&rsquo;t make any ground against King Dollar after a solid labour market report, which saw the number of jobs added blitz expectations, and earnings ex-bonuses rising. Sterling did manage to make gains against the EUR, however, as traders reasoned that the data may offer the BOE reasons to hike in the coming months (pricing for June remains for unchanged, while August pricing implies an approximately 40% chance of a hike).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD, AUD: Doubts that a NAFTA deal could be achieved by Paul Ryan&rsquo;s soft deadline on 17 May, coupled with a mighty dollar pushed USDCAD to over 1.29, though the air was thin, and the Loonie returned back towards the 1.2850 area. AUD was soft following the RBA&rsquo;s meeting minutes after the central bank largely reiterated its current guidance. However, there was a slightly dovish twist that seems to be going unreported: the Reserve Bank inserted commentary that &ldquo;it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the Reserve Bank to be a source of stability and confidence,&rdquo; which some suggest that the RBA is not willing to lift rates until well after the conclusion of the Royal Commission&rsquo;s look into bank practices &ndash; and the new emphasis on lending conditions could suggest that the RBA will potentially be on hold for longer than the market assumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* COMING UP: JAPANESE GDP: Growth is expected to have stalled in Q1 after increasing 0.4% in Q4 2017. Capital Economics are even more pessimistic, forecasting growth to actually contract 0.1%, citing a fall in private consumption. &ldquo;The Bank of Japan&rsquo;s consumption activity index recorded a 0.4% q/q drop,&rdquo; the consultancy writes,&rdquo; a decline in capital goods shipments suggests that nonresidential investment may also have fallen marginally.&rdquo; However, this data is backward looking and data so far in Q2 has been relatively upbeat, suggesting a return to growth in the quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* COMING UP: EZ CPI: Wednesday sees the final release of the region&rsquo;s April inflation statistics with Y/Y expected to be revised lower to 1.2% from 1.4% and M/M expected to print at 0.3% vs. March&rsquo;s 1.0% reading. Although the figures could cause some concern in markets for the ECB&rsquo;s normalisation efforts, Nordea highlight comments from ECB officials such as ECB&rsquo;s Praet who &ldquo;downplayed both the growth and the recent inflation slowdown, stating April&rsquo;s surprising drop in core inflation reflected the timing of Easter&rdquo;. As such, the flash print for May at the end of the month will be pivotal in validating or negating the claims made by Praet.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An array of bullish factors for the Greenback, ranging from latest White House protectionist declarations to rising US Treasury yields, another run on EM currencies/assets, data and more technical moves/positioning. It&rsquo;s tough to pinpoint the catalyst with any degree of accuracy or certainty, and in truth probably immaterial as momentum built behind the widespread if not universal Buck buying in what increasingly became a self-sustained rally. In short, the index took a while to regain 93.000, but after that the upside progress was relatively rapid to and just over the previous ytd high. The DXY almost got to 93.500 and the next strong chart resistance around 93.522, which appears almost a formality as the 10 year US yield extends its gains above 3% to fresh multi-year peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAJORS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Losses stretch from circa 0.35% to around 1% for the Dollar&rsquo;s G10 rivals and a serious of previous 2018 highs/lows and/or significant markers were made in the process. Usd/Chf is back eyeing recent 1.0050+ levels, Usd/Jpy finally took out triple or more tops around 110.00, and the 200 DMA to nudge up towards 110.50, Cable lost 1.3500 (after mixed UK labour/earnings data) and briefly breached its 1.3460 ytd base along with Eur/Usd through 1.1900, 1.1850 and only 20 pips shy of 1.1800 before finding some underlying bids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CAD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No refuge for the Usd&rsquo;s namesakes in the commodity bloc even though crude prices resisted bearish clutches for a while, as Gold folded (sub-$1300/oz) and risk sentiment soured across the board. The Kiwi lost 0.6900, Loonie weakened through 1.2900 (amidst very mixed messages and views on NAFTA agreement prospects for Thursday, plus weak Canadian existing home prices), and last but by no means least the Aud gave up 0.7500 long before the next big option expiry interest at the strike. Note, some solace for the Nzd may be gleaned from a bounce in GDT auction prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New all time lows for many regional currencies and only partial relief with the aid of more direct intervention. Usd/Try climbed above 4.4600 before fading after seemingly outright dovish comments from Turkish PM Erdogan were put into context, while Usd/Rub saw more upside above 62.5000 as a US Treasury official indicated a willingness to impose more sanctions against Russia. Usd/Zar followed the overall trend, but Usd/Ars was capped at 25.0000 again as the authorities offered another Usd5 bn to defend the Peso.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are relatively range-bound following the modest performance in US where the major indices finished in the green but well off best levels and the DJIA met resistance just shy of the 25k level but still edged its longest run of gains since September. ASX 200 (-0.4%) is lacklustre with the telecoms sector dragged by weakness in Telstra shares on expectations of prolonged challenging conditions, while tech outperforms as Link Administration shares rally on reports the Co. is exploring options with Pexa in which it is the 2nd largest shareholder of. Nikkei 225 (Unch.) is kept afloat on a slightly weaker currency and with focus for individual stocks on corporate earnings, while Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) and Hang Seng (-0.8%) have conformed to the mixed picture with mainland China positive after a firm liquidity operation by the PBoC which conducted a net injection of CNY 180bln and with profit taking observed in Hong Kong following the recent streak. Furthermore, varied tier-1 data from China added to the inconclusive tone as Industrial Production topped estimates and Retail Sales disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets have consolidated following yesterday&rsquo;s swings with the USD-index holding near the prior session&rsquo;s highs. The quiet overnight trade in currencies has provided some respite from the pressure in EUR/USD and GBP/USD, although both remain firmly below the 1.2000 and 1.3600 handles respectively. Elsewhere, JPY is slightly weaker with USD/JPY underpinned by importer demand and on the firmer greenback, while commodity-linked currencies are subdued amid recent weakness in the metals complex and with AUD kept lacklustre following an unsurprising RBA minutes release in which the central bank reiterated there wasn&rsquo;t a strong case for a near-term policy move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued following similar trade in T-notes and amid an indecisive tone in riskier assets, while a 30-yr auction also kept participants side-lined.</p>\r\n",
