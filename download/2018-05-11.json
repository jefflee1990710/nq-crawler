        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index is ending a busy/volatile week on the defensive having set a new 2018 peak on Wednesday at 93.420, but easing back towards 93.000 by the close that day as strong technical resistance at 93.522 was respected and US PPI data was soft in places. The Dollar was subsequently dealt a further fundamental blow via soft elements within April&rsquo;s CPI report and is now back below 92.500 (and lower than where it was on Monday).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/EUR/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All vying for Friday&rsquo;s top G10 performer vs the Usd award, and remarkably the respective pairs are pretty close to where they started the week after roller-coaster rides on the back of Greenback swings and/or independent factors. Cable kicked off around 1.3535 and squeezed up to just over 1.3600 shortly before midday on BoE &lsquo;super&rsquo; Thursday, but then hit a low near 1.3450 as the MPC held rates by a 7-2 majority and signalled no urgency (beyond the hawkish dissenters) to continue policy normalisation until it can be determined whether the sharp Q1 growth slowdown is temporary and weather related or not. Governor Carney added to the less hawkish guidance with&nbsp; the view that it is likely rates will rise this year, but if the economy weakens policy can be adjusted accordingly. Usd/Chf is back below parity vs 1.0050+ at one stage after softer than forecast Swiss CPI data, while Eur/Usd has rebounded sharply from a new ytd low circa 1.1820 to 1.1950+ largely on a technical rebound with 1.1935-6 pivotal on the charts (key Fib and 200 HMA). Aud/Usd has also benefited from a short squeeze and broadly better risk sentiment overall, with option and hedge fund buying ahead of 0.7400, while cross-related flows also aided the recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/NZD/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrowly mixed vs the Usd on the day, and the Jpy among those little changed over the week as upside tests of 110.00 were rejected and a base around 109.00 holds. The Kiwi has stabilised off 0.6900 lows vs its US counterpart, but remains weak on balance having lost the 0.7000 handle and sliding to 1.0800+ levels vs the Aud mainly on RBNZ impulses as the Bank maintained rate but said the OCR could be raised or lowered as risks are balanced. Moreover, new Governor Orr welcomed Nzd weakness in wake of the revised policy outlook/guidance. In stark contrast, the Loonie has ridden on the crest of&nbsp;rallying crude prices and more positive NAFTA vibes ahead of a meeting later today, and following reports that a deal could be reached by next week, with no real or sustained reaction to mixed Canadian jobs data (headline disappointing, but breakdown more encouraging). NAFTA impulses have&nbsp;also boosted the MXN, while the TRY has been very choppy between fresh record lows vs the Usd and recovery highs against the backdrop of Government-CBRT meetings to discuss the Lira&rsquo;s plight and economy overall that promised a lot, but produced little concrete.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) were positive with earnings also a key driver of price action and the top performing stocks in Japan spurred by corporate updates including KDDI, Panasonic and Suzuki. Hang Seng (+1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) were mixed as Hong Kong sustained its outperformance streak, while the mainland lagged after the PBoC refrained from open market operations and widened the amount of liquidity it drained for the week. Finally, 10yr JGBs were quiet amid similar flat trade witnessed in T-notes and heightened appetite for riskier assets, while the BoJ&rsquo;s rinban announcement also failed to spur demand with the amounts kept unchanged and at paltry JPY 285bln total for the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 140bln vs. last week&#39;s net drain of CNY 110bln.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are mostly lower (Eurostoxx 50 -0.2%) with the exception of Spain&rsquo;s IBEX (+0.2%). Looking at the sectors, health care is a noticeable underperformer amid negative drug updates from AstraZeneca (-0.3%) and Roche (-1.7%), subsequently dragging other health names across Europe (Novartis -0.7%, GSK -0.8%, Merck -0.9%) in sympathy. On the flip side, material names outperform following strong earnings from the world&rsquo;s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal (+1.7%) as it lifts the likes of Thyssenkrupp (+1.2%) with it. Elsewhere, Sika (+10%) rose to the top of the Stoxx 600 after striking a deal with France&rsquo;s Saint Gobain (+2.4%) who are also seen higher on the news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback is virtually flat vs G10 rivals and the index rangebound between 92.630-840 after its retracement from new ytd highs just shy of 93.500 to around 92.500 in wake of some softer than expected components in the latest CPI release and ahead of more price indicators via import/export data and inflation expectations in the Michigan survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A marginal outperformer, with Aud/Usd back up near 0.7550 and Aud/Nzd seemingly forming a more solid base above 1.0800.

Bunds have ventured either side of the 159.00 level, albeit within a narrow band and almost exclusively below Thursday&rsquo;s 159.07 close to a 158.92 low before finding some underlying bids. Ahead, no major data after another soft Eurozone inflation release from Spain, but multi-tranche Italian auctions could be interesting along with a speech from ECB President Draghi in the pm.</p>\r\n",

(Times)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD languished around the 92.50 level after a pullback from the YTD highs seen mid-week and in the wake of the softer than expected CPI data. This kept its major counterparts firm, while GBP/USD was also off the post-BoE lows seen after the central bank kept policy unchanged and lowered Q2 2018 GDP forecasts as well as CPI forecasts through to Q2 2020. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies held on to the recent energy-triggered upside, while the greenback&rsquo;s NAFTA-counterparts have also stayed near the prior day&rsquo;s best levels after the broad USD-weakness and some optimism regarding a near-term deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities traded sideways overnight as the complex took a breather from the recent upside in prices. As such, WTI crude future are marginally weaker but remain above the USD 71/bbl level with gains of over 2% for the week after the US withdrawal from the JCOPA. Elsewhere, gold prices were slightly softer overnight but remained near its best levels in nearly 2-weeks after recent USD weakness due to soft inflation data, while copper traded flat and failed to benefit from the overall positive risk appetite in the region. Conversely, Chinese metal prices were more eventful with early gains in iron ore and steel prices on expectations of increased demand amid declining rebar stockpiles.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran Foreign Minister Zarif is to meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang on Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov on Monday and EU officials on Tuesday to discuss preserving nuclear agreement. In related news, US President Trump commented that he hopes to strike a better deal with Iran, while the US Treasury issued fresh sanctions on Iran in which it blacklisted several individuals and entities. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries finished slightly higher for the day, following the miss on CPI which alleviated fear of inflation gearing up in the economy. Yields on the long-end of the curve were lower by c.3bps at settlement. The 5s30s spread was the lowest since 2007 and narrower by c.4bps following the solid 27bln 30yr bond auction, which stopped-through by 0.8bps. The stop-through was the largest for a new bond at auction since November 2015. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 4 ticks higher at 119-15+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is to give speech on reducing drug prices at 1400EDT today, while President Trump had also commented that he has great health plans to be announced over the upcoming 4 weeks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said he thinks China &#39;agreed to the concept&#39; of reducing the trade deficit, while he also commented that there is a reasonable chance the US will reach a tariff deal with the EU. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is said to set May 17th or May 18th for a NAFTA deadline, while House Speaker Ryan commented that Congress must receive the final NAFTA text by May 17th to be able to vote on it this year prior to the expiry of the fast-track Trade Promotion Authority in July and US mid-term elections in November. In related news, Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said they will work as long as necessary for NAFTA and that she remains optimistic about reaching a deal, while she added they are definitely approaching the final objective.
