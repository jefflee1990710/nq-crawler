Intel stated it forecasts Q2 EPS and revenue to be higher than expected, and 2018 will be another record year; this saw INTC spike in the pre-market by over 2%, but those gains were pared as trade progressed. The underperforming names today mainly consisted of energy names with the sector down 2%&nbsp; due to lower oil prices. Also of note, the US Supreme Court ruled that states can require an internet tax collection, which would tax internet sales. This initially hurt names such as Wayfair (W), eBay (EBAY) and Amazon (AMZN). However, as the session progressed eBay seemed to take the grunt of the hit as losses extended, whereas Amazon and Wayfair pared back some of the initial losses.

China&rsquo;s President Xi commented on China, urging the country to stay vigilant as the world economic growth still lacks momentum. He noted protectionism, isolationism and populism have increased and said China has not yet fully recovered from the global financial crisis. Elsewhere, EU&rsquo;s Juncker said EU will do what needs to be done regarding the trade dispute. On the US front, Commerce Secretary Ross reported US President Trump ultimately wants to lower trade barriers and added if the ZTE commits any more violations, the US will shut them down. Also, late session it was reported the US is considering resuming talks with China as there is a split among the Trump trade team. On the NAFTA front, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the US is committed to modernising NAFTA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US President Trump says North Korea is blowing up its test sites, and South Korea&rsquo;s Moon said North Korea are implementing efforts at aiming for full denuclearisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BANK OF ENGLAND: </strong>It was a hawkish hold for the BOE, with the MPC voting 6-3 to maintain rates (Prev. 7-2), with Andy Haldane joining Saunders and McCafferty in favouring a 25bps rate rise - Haldane&#39;s vote takes on slightly more significance, given he is the Bank&#39;s chief economist. The MPC said that its best collective judgement remains that if the economy develops broadly in line with May&#39;s projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate. Future increases in the Bank Rate are likely to be gradual and to a limited extent, it added. There was some attention on what the MPC makes of the recent tone of data, which has shown some weakness. But it seems to be looking through the weakness, saying that judgements in growth made in the May QIR were &#39;broadly on track. Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to pick up slightly more than projected in the near-term on the back of oil prices and GBP weakness, the Bank believes, adding that most indicators of wages have picked up, and the labour market remains tight, suggesting that domestic cost pressures are set to firm gradually. On the labour market, all members were in agreement that there is widespread evidence that slack in the economy has largely been used up. Next week&#39;s docket is packed with BOE speakers, with attention likely to be on the new dissenter Haldane, who is due to speak a few times; hawk McCafferty will also deliver comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED SPEAK:</strong> Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Non-voter, Dove) said he sees no signs of an overheating economy and does not want to prematurely end economic expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB SPEAK: </strong>ECB&#39;s Villeroy (Dovish) reiterated the ECB&rsquo;s view stating they are more confident that they are heading in the right direction on inflation. ECB&#39;s Weidmann (Hawk) noted ending net asset purchases is most likely the first step on a multi-year path of normalisation and that it is important to get the ball rolling. He added that the policy stance will remain accommodative after normalisation begins. He said reaching the inflation target has been challenging, but he is convinced &#39;we are finally getting there&#39; adding it will take some time until the deposit rate exceeds 0%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SWISS NATIONAL BANK: </strong>The meeting and press conference was largely a non-event, as expected. The statement was little changed, and the central bank still sees the CHF as &#39;highly valued&#39;, noting that the situation in FX markets remains fragile (specifically noting the political uncertainty in Italy). SNB did, however, revise its inflation forecasts upwards, now pencilling in 0.9% in 2017 (Prev. 0.6%). The growth forecasts were little changed, though the central bank noted that downside risks remain, with Chairman Jordan suggesting that expanding the balance sheet is still a tool in the SNB&rsquo;s arsenal, should the situation require. Analysts at UBS said that in aggregate, arguments for SNB normalisation have weakened; UBS says there are three conditions that need to be satisfied in order to see a December 2018 rate hike 1) the ECB would need to end QE in September and thus firmly suggesting a first ECB deposit rate hike in July 2019, 2) the risks surrounding the Italian elections abate, 3) the CHF would depreciate to 1.25. &quot;Under these circumstances we thought the SNB would be willing to risk moving ahead of the ECB, not least since its own inflation forecast was suggesting a medium-term inflation target overshoot if Swiss policy rates were to remain unchanged,&quot; UBS says, though adds &quot;all conditions now face headwinds.&quot; The ECB&#39;s trajectory has been pushed back, recently, Italian risks continue to linger, as seen this week, and the CHF has actually strengthened recently. Accordingly, UBS now sees the first SNB hike coming in September 2019 (previously, it expected December 2018).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BANXICO: </strong>The Mexican Central Bank hiked rates by 25bps in line with consensus, as certain inflation risks that could affect convergence to the inflation target have started to materialise. The central bank noted balance of risks to inflation has deteriorated, but with upwards bias in an environment of high uncertainty; tariffs, the dollar, NAFTA developments and Presidential elections next week were cited as potential upside CPI risks. The central bank however expects the impact of US and Mexican &#39;tit for tat&#39; tariffs on prices is to be limited. Finally, it warned further depreciation in the exchange rate and pressures on fuel and gas prices, would affect downward inflation in trend. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.64%, NASDAQ COMP &nbsp;-0.87%, DJI &nbsp;-0.80%.</strong> SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals -0.69%, Cons Non-Cyclicals:&nbsp;-0.10%, Energy: -2.11%, Financials: -0.21%, Health Care:&nbsp;-0.70%, Industrials: -1.25%, Materials: -1.18%, Telecoms: -0.30%, Tech: -1.01%, Utilities: +0.16%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*Stock Specifics: </strong>Just before the US cash equity open, Intel (INTC) announced its CEO is retiring and that Bob Swan, CFO, is to be Interim CEO until another is found where they mentioned active searches are underway. Intel stated it forecasts Q2 EPS and revenue to be higher than expected, and 2018 will be another record year; this saw INTC spike in the pre-market by over 2%, but those gains were pared as trade progressed. The underperforming names today mainly consisted of energy names with the sector down 2%&nbsp; due to lower oil prices. Also of note, the US Supreme Court ruled that states can require an internet tax collection, which would tax internet sales. This initially hurt names such as Wayfair (W), eBay (EBAY) and Amazon (AMZN). However as the session progressed eBay seemed to take the grunt of the hit as losses extended, whereas Amazon and Wayfair pared back some of the initial losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*Earnings: </strong>Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Kroger (KR) both outperformed the SPX today with gains greater than 10%. DRI beat on the EPS and revenues were in line, but it boosted its share repurchase programme by USD 500mln and increased its dividend by 19%. Kroger beat on both top and bottom line and raised the low end of its 2018 guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US Philly Fed</strong> disappointed and came in at 19.9, short of expectations at 34.4. The components also disappointed, particularly New Orders which posted at 17.90, consensus was at 40.60. The drop in June is likely to be a correction from the previous read in May which showed a jumped to a 45-year high. The fall does not seem to be based on any fundamental factor related to ongoing trade disputes, given the Philly Fed only includes minor ports and thus it is much responsive than other regional surveys such as Richmond Fed; analysts at Pantheon say. Analysts expect the index to remain anchored around 20 and see little upside potential.&nbsp;Elsewhere, <strong>Jobless Claims </strong>continue to fall gradually and are expected to continue in this direction; they ticked a tad lower in June posting at 218k, consensus was at 220k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) 8 &nbsp;TICKS HIGHER AT 119-27+.</strong>&nbsp;Treasuries were higher on Thursday, following the move lower in equities, as risk sentiment deteriorated throughout the session ahead of OPEC+ meeting tomorrow and as trade war fear returns in the market and amid disappointing Philly Fed data. Yields were lower by c.3bps across the curve, 2s5s and 2s20 narrowed by c.2bps. 2s30s narrowed by c.1bps. The US Treasury sold $5bln in 30yr TIPS stopping through by 0.6bps at a high yield of 0.934%. The bid-to-cover came in at 2.62x. Dealers were awarded the smallest portion of the latest 30yr TIPS supply at 14.6% while indirects/directs took a share well above &nbsp;average, at 80.8% and 4.6% respectively. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI FUTURES (Q8) SETTLE &nbsp;17 CENTS LOWER AT $64.54/BBL; BRENT (Q8) FUTURES SETTLE USD 1.69 LOWER AT $73.05/BBL.</strong> Ahead of OPEC&rsquo;s meeting on Friday (and OPEC+ meeting on Saturday), the range of expectations of how much supply will be re-added to the market remains wide. On Thursday, Ecuador suggested 600k was being discussed, and that was a more realistic level than the 1mln barrels that unnamed sources said was being discussed; Oman, meanwhile, said that up to 1.5mln is being discussed. However, the sticking point seems to be Iran, and to a lesser extent, the likes of Iraq and Venezuela. Iran itself said it needs more convincing that further barrels of supply will be demanded in H2 2018 (after the Saudis &ndash; and most analysts &ndash; argued it is needed to prevent a tightening of OPEC supply in the latter part of the year). Iran is also said to want a clause in any communique to support them against US sanctions; and as was reported, Iran is said to be showing more flexibility to get a deal done, with its oil minister initially expressing confidence that this will be an outcome. However, as he left the meeting he did not think an agreement can be reached, but an OPEC delegate stated OPEC+ discussions are still ongoing which include a possible 1mln, 1.5mln, 1.8mln BPD increase. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Saudis themselves today said that oil market fundamentals call for a return to 1.8mln BPD cut, arguing that the market has now been rebalanced, and raising supply was needed to maintain that balance. On the demand side, Saudi energy minister stated that oil demand in H2 of 2018 will likely be 2mln BPD higher than it was in H1. In geopolitics, the situation in Libya remains fluid; it was reported that the Government has retaken control of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf oil ports, before later headlines suggested that fighting was still taking place, before a later batch of headlines suggested that the Government has, once again, retaken control.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>DXY </strong>back below 95.000 after a raft of US data misses, bar headline initial claims combined with broad recoveries in rival currencies which revered gains made by the Greenback to a new 2018 high just over 95.500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>GBP </strong>has been propelled to the top of the G10 pile by the BoE as the gap between hawks and doves/neutrals closed to 3 from 5 previously with new dissenter chief economist Haldane. Minutes were also less dovish than last month as the MPC saw inflation/wages picking up Cable duly rebounded from the low 1.3100 area to absorb at least some offers at 1.3250, while EURGBP backed away from 0.8800 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The<strong> CHF</strong> was left somewhat wanting as the SNB largely stuck to a familiar script, albeit with a downside bias to its central outlook for unchanged 2018 growth around 2%, but higher inflation at 0.9%. USDCHF and EURCHF just above 0.9900 and around 1.1500 respectively, and with the Franc firmer on balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUD, JPY, EUR, NZD: </strong>All ending Thursday&rsquo;s session firmer vs the USD as the tide turns, with the former rebounding towards 0.7400, USDJPY re-testing 110.00 and single currency recovering strongly after matching its 1.1510 low with the aid of option/barrier-related bids, but capped just above 1.1600 amidst supply and a band of large expiries. Meanwhile, the Kiwi held in around 0.6925 and unwound some losses vs its antipodean peer with the cross back under 1.0750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD </strong>was unable to really capitalise on the USD reversal as the Loonie struggles to bounce off 1.3300 amidst ongoing NAFTA limbo, another pre-OPEC downturn in crude prices and disappointing Canadian data (wholesale trade and ADP).</p>\r\n",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Ahead of OPEC&rsquo;s meeting on Friday (and OPEC+ meeting on Saturday), the range of expectations of how much supply will be re-added to the market remains wide. On Thursday, Ecuador suggested 600k was being discussed, and that was a more realistic level than the 1mln barrels that unnamed sources said was being discussed; Oman, meanwhile, said that up to 1.5mln is being discussed. However, the sticking point seems to be Iran, and to a lesser extent, the likes of Iraq and Venezuela. Iran itself said it needs more convincing that further barrels of supply will be demanded in H2 2018 (after the Saudis &ndash; and most analysts &ndash; argued it is needed to prevent a tightening of OPEC supply in the latter part of the year). Iran is also said to want a clause in any communique to support them against US sanctions; and as was reported, Iran is said to be showing more flexibility to get a deal done, with its oil minister initially expressing confidence that this will be an outcome. However, as he left the meeting he did not think an agreement can be reached, but an OPEC delegate stated OPEC+ discussions are still ongoing which include a possible 1mln, 1.5mln, 1.8mln BPD increase. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Saudis themselves today said that oil market fundamentals call for a return to 1.8mln BPD cut, arguing that the market has now been rebalanced, and raising supply was needed to maintain that balance. On the demand side, Saudi energy minister stated that oil demand in H2 of 2018 will likely be 2mln BPD higher than it was in H1. In geopolitics, the situation in Libya remains fluid; it was reported that the Government has retaken control of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf oil ports, before later headlines suggested that fighting was still taking place, before a later batch of headlines suggested that the Government has, once again, retaken control.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Moreover, minutes from the June policy meeting were less dovish than last month as the MPC saw inflation/wages picking up and lowered the rate at which maturing APF funds will stop being reinvested to 1.5% from 2% previously. Cable duly rebounded from the low 1.3100 area to absorb at least some offers at 1.3250, while Eur/Gbp backed away from 0.8800 again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A real game of two halves for the Dollar and index, as a raft of US data misses, bar headline initial claims combined with broad recoveries in rival currencies to erase and/or partially reverse gains made by the Greenback as the DXY climbed to a new 2018 high just over 93.500 (now back below 95.000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another currency eyeing Central Bank policy for some independent impetus, but left somewhat wanting as the SNB largely stuck to a familiar script, albeit with a downside bias to its central outlook (for unchanged 2018 growth around 2%, but higher inflation at 0.9% vs 0.6% at the March Quarterly review). For the record, expansive monetary policy and direct FX intervention remain appropriate and warranted as the Franc is still highly valued, prone to safe-haven demand, and the Bank is also prepared to use its balance sheet if necessary. Usd/Chf and Eur/Chf just above 0.9900 and around 1.1500 respectively, and with the Franc firmer on balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extended gains vs the Eur through 9.4000 at one stage in wake of a hawkish Norges Bank that nailed down September as the month to hike rates given ongoing strength in the domestic and less slack that suggests gradual increases in wages and overall inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY/EUR/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All ending Thursday&rsquo;s session firmer vs the Usd as the tide turns, with the former rebounding towards 0.7400, Usd/Jpy re-testing 110.00 and single currency recovering strongly after matching its 1.1510 low with the aid of option/barrier-related bids, but capped just above 1.1600 amidst supply and a band of large expiries. Meanwhile, the Kiwi held in around 0.6925 and unwound some losses vs its antipodean peer with the cross back under 1.0750.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unable to really capitalise on the Usd reversal as the Loonie struggles to bounce off 1.3300 amidst ongoing NAFTA limbo, another pre-OPEC downturn in crude prices and disappointing Canadian data (wholesale trade and ADP).</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.9%) was led higher by tech which mirrored the outperformance of the sector stateside and with sentiment also underpinned after the Australian parliament passed the income tax cut package. Furthermore, the biggest gaining stocks APN Outdoor and Gateway Lifestyle were boosted by takeover approaches which lifted the former by over 10%. Elsewhere, the weak-JPY-increased-risk dynamic spurred Nikkei 225 (+0.6%), while Hang Seng (-1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) initially conformed to the improved global risk sentiment amid injections by the PBoC which also expects further increases in liquidity, although the tone in China later soured following comments from China&rsquo;s Mofcom which renewed its tough talk on trade against the US. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with demand sapped amid gains in riskier Japanese assets and weaker demand in the 5yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 60bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 40bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily injection of CNY 30bln, while the PBoC was also reported to expect banking system liquidity to increase further. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.4706 (Prev. 6.4586)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Mofcom said US is being unpredictable and challenging, while it added that China has to respond strongly. Mofcom also stated China will act to defend its interests and that it has no choice but to implement new tariffs on certain US products in areas where broader tariff cuts were announced. (Newswires) Elsewhere, there were separate reports that China could take action against Dow-listed US firms. (Global Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is said to be mulling plans to curb Chinese investment in over 1000 US firms and is expected to announce fresh restrictions at the end of the week. (Politico)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japan is to sign free trade agreement with EU on July 11th. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SNB kept Interest rates unchanged, as expected, with the target 3M LIBOR rate at -0.75%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SNB said Franc remains highly valued. Will remain active in FX markets as necessary. Risks to the baseline scenario are more to the downside. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norges Bank kept interest rates unchanged, as expected, at 0.50%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norges Bank Governor Olsen said: &quot;As we look at the outlook and the risk picture, the key policy rate will most likely be raised in September 2018&quot;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Weidmann (Hawk) said ending net asset purchases is most likely the first step on a multi-year path of normalisation, important to get the ball rolling, adding it will take some time until the deposit rate exceeds 0%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Euroskeptic Alberto Bagnai named as head of the Italian Senate Finance Committee. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European stocks are mostly lower (EuroStoxx 50 -0.5%) as Europe is hit by Italian political developments alongside trade war woes. The FTSE MIB underperforms while Italian banks plumb the depths (Italian Banking Index -1.4%) following the appointing of a Eurosceptic as the head of the Italian Senate Finance Committee. In stock specifics, the most notable story of the day, DAX heavyweight Daimler (-4.0%) has issued a profit warning, blaming the US-Sino trade tensions as the main factor to hit earnings. BMW (-2.7%) is subsequently hit by the news as both German auto names have major US plants that export more cars from the country (by value) than other brands. Volkswagen (-2.5%), Peugeot (-2.2%) and Fiat Chrysler (-3.3%) move in sympathy. On the flip side, Novo Nordisk (+5.0%) is showing a strong performance following successful new trials of an oral diabetes drug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index has eked out more upside amidst widespread Dollar gains and no further physical action on the US vs China and other trade partner tariff front. A fresh ytd peak has been posted around 95.510 and technically eclipsing strong resistance along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/NOK/GBP - All on Central Bank watch, with the Franc relatively mixed after the latest SNB quarterly policy review that maintained the need for NIRP and currency market vigilance given recent moves underlining fragility. The Chf is still deemed to be highly valued so intervention to curb excessive strength remains appropriate and the Franc is softer vs the Usd, but firmer vs the Eur circa 0.9975 and 1.1500 following the unchanged policy decision/statement. However, Eur/Nok is down to new 2018 lows under 9.4000 as the Norges Bank firmly pinned September as the month for a first hike and thereby confirmed divergence from the ECB that intends to hold rates through Summer 2019. Conversely, Cable is losing more ground towards 1.3100 into the BoE at high noon with little or no expectation of any change from the MPC, but the vote split and tone of the minutes less certain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency is also on the backfoot vs the Greenback and now testing this year&rsquo;s 1.1510 base on the relative interest rate/yield dynamic and hyped up global protectionism/trade war risk. Market observers note option related bids around this level and barriers at 1.1500. Note also expiry interest at 1.1525 of 1.2bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - Both prone to further downside as well, with the former only just holding above 0.7350 and Kiwi underperforming just over 0.6925, as the cross climbs above 1.0750 after overnight data showing a loss of momentum in NZ GDP, while the Aud may be gleaning some support from the Government&rsquo;s income tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Rangy around 110.50 vs the Dollar and largely moving in tandem with overall risk sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie is just keeping its head afloat and off recent lows vs its US counterpart (in a circa 1.3300-30 range), but vulnerable again as oil prices retreat sharply amidst latest OPEC related headlines suggesting a bigger than previously anticipated output increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple factors behind the rebound in safe-haven debt as autos continue to drive EU bourses down, while Bunds are also benefiting from another BTP slide on political jitters following the appointments of Eurosceptics to the roles of chief Senate Finance and Lower Budget Committees. The 10-year German bond recent hit 161.98, while its Italian peer plunged to 126.53 for a near &frac12; point gain and 175 tick loss respectively. Elsewhere, Gilts almost reached 123.00 vs 122.66 at the low in wake of better than forecast UK PSNB data and ahead of the BoE, while US Treasuries have also caught a bid ahead of a busy Thursday agenda. So, risk-off trade overall, or at least several reasons to position cautiously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil is negative on the day as news reports from multiple energy ministers suggest a deal is nearing for an output increase, with Iran&rsquo;s oil minister expressing confidence a deal will be done, and the OPEC secretariat suggesting this could be under a deal where higher output quotas would be set. The Iraqi oil minister has suggested, however, that they do not intend to increase output this year. Saudi&rsquo;s energy minister has stated a 1mln BPD increase as a &ldquo;reasonable goal&rdquo; (higher than the previously stated figure of 600-800k BPD), but negotiations are still ongoing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sources suggested Iran is said to be unlikely to reject an idea of 1mln BPD output increase. This is dependent on it being part of the overall OPEC view and if needed by the market. Oil Ministers are to discuss this increase in output at the OPEC meeting, but Iran are yet to agree (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

The FTSE MIB underperforms while Italian banks plumb the depths (Italian Banking Index -1.7%) following the appointing of a Eurosceptic as the head of the Italian Senate Finance Committee. In stock specifics, the most notable story of the day, DAX heavyweight Daimler (-4.3%) has issued a profit warning, blaming the US-Sino trade tensions as the main factor to hit earnings. BMW (-3.1%) is subsequently hit by the news as both German auto names have major US plants that export more cars from the country (by value) than other brands. Volkswagen (-2.7%), Peugeot (-1.6%) and Fiat Chrysler (-2.2%) move in sympathy. On the flip side, Novo Nordisk (+5.0%) is showing a strong performance following successful new trials of an oral diabetes drug.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong>&nbsp;<br />DXY - The index has eked out more upside amidst widespread Dollar gains and no further physical action on the US vs China and other trade partner tariff front. A fresh ytd peak has been posted around 95.510 and technically eclipsing strong resistance along the way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/NOK/GBP - All on Central Bank watch, with the Franc relatively mixed after the latest SNB quarterly policy review that maintained the need for NIRP and currency market vigilance given recent moves underlining fragility. The Chf is still deemed to be highly valued so intervention to curb excessive strength remains appropriate and the Franc is softer vs the Usd, but firmer vs the Eur circa 0.9975 and 1.1500 following the unchanged policy decision/statement. However, Eur/Nok is down to new 2018 lows under 9.4000 as the Norges Bank firmly pinned September as the month for a first hike and thereby confirmed divergence from the ECB that intends to hold rates through Summer 2019. Conversely, Cable is losing more ground towards 1.3100 into the BoE at high noon with little or no expectation of any change from the MPC, but the vote split and tone of the minutes less certain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency is also on the backfoot vs the Greenback and within a few pips of this year&rsquo;s 1.1510 base on the relative interest rate/yield dynamic and hyped up global protectionism/trade war risk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - Both prone to further downside as well, with the former only just holding above 0.7350 and Kiwi underperforming just over 0.6925, as the cross climbs above 1.0750 after overnight data showing a loss of momentum in NZ GDP, while the Aud may be gleaning some support from the Government&rsquo;s income tax cuts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Rangy around 110.50 vs the Dollar and largely moving in tandem with overall risk sentiment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie is just keeping its head afloat and off recent lows vs its US counterpart (in a circa 1.3300-30 range), but vulnerable again as oil prices retreat sharply amidst latest OPEC related headlines suggesting a bigger than previously anticipated output increase.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME&nbsp;</strong><br />Multiple factors behind the rebound in safe-haven debt as autos continue to drive EU bourses down, while Bunds are also benefiting from another BTP slide on political jitters following the appointments of Eurosceptics to the roles of chief Senate Finance and Lower Budget Committees. The 10 year German bond recent hit 161.98, while its Italian peer plunged to 126.53 for a near &frac12; point gain and 175 tick loss respectively. Elsewhere, Gilts almost reached 123.00 vs 122.66 at the low in wake of better than forecast UK PSNB data and ahead of the BoE, while US Treasuries have also caught a bid ahead of a busy Thursday agenda. So, risk-off trade overall, or at least several reasons to position cautiously.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong>&nbsp;<br />Oil is negative on the day as news reports from multiple energy ministers suggest a deal is nearing for an output increase, with Iran&rsquo;s oil minister expressing confidence a deal will be done, and the OPEC secretariat suggesting this could be under a deal where higher output quotas would be set. The Iraqi oil minister has suggested, however, that they do not intend to increase output this year. Saudi&rsquo;s energy minister has stated a 1mln BPD increase as a &ldquo;reasonable goal&rdquo; (higher than the previously stated figure of 600-800k BPD), but negotiations are still ongoing&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The 10 year debt future is nudging the bottom of a 122.71-85 range vs yesterday&rsquo;s 122.88 Liffe close, while Short Sterling contracts are 1-2 ticks adrift, and perhaps also acknowledging another parliament hurdle overcome by the Government on the meaningful Brexit bill vote. Back to today&rsquo;s UK agenda, PSNB balances are seen a bit narrower, but the MPC minutes and vote split are much more likely to prompt a market reaction. Note, some upside positioning in options via the Sep 99.25/99.375 call spread bought vs 99.125 puts in 1:2 ratio for 1 tick in 10k lots.</p>\r\n",

Mofcom also stated China will act to defend its interests and that it has no choice but to implement new tariffs on certain US products in areas where broader tariff cuts were announced. (Newswires) Elsewhere, there were separate reports that China could take action against Dow-listed US firms. (Global Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is said to be mulling plans to curb Chinese investment in over 1000 US firms and is expected to announce fresh restrictions at the end of the week.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets traded relatively quiet overnight, although the greenback remained firm and above the 95.00 level which restricted its major counterparts across the pond with EUR/USD and GBP/USD little changed. Elsewhere, JPY once again took most the focus with USD/JPY and JPY-crosses supported by outflows from the safe-haven currency, while antipodeans were subdued with underperformance in NZD following GDP data and amid cross-related flows in which AUD/NZD broke through the prior day&rsquo;s resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand GDP (Q1) Q/Q 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.6%).

As such, WTI crude futures pared some of the prior day&rsquo;s divergence from Brent seen in the aftermath of a larger than expected build in DoE inventories. Elsewhere, gold prices extended on losses as the greenback remained firm, while underperformance in China due to further fighting talk by Mofcom clouded over copper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia is said to be seeking a collective increase of between 600k-800k bpd, although target is not yet final and is a basis for talks with other producers, according to a senior OPEC official. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said the market demands more oil in the second half of 2018 and that he is encouraged to be converging to a good decision over an agreement which will be based on fundamentals, while he also stated that every energy minister he has spoken to has agreed it is time to change course. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh said Iran may agree to output increase through producers who have overdelivered on cuts, while he added that OPEC members are discussing reverting back to 100% compliance and can agree to increase supply without the need of a fresh agreement. In related news, a senior OPEC source suggested that reducing compliance down to 100% would involve adding 1mln bpd. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex edged lower on Wednesday and gave up some of the gains seen in the two previous sessions, as it took a breath from escalating trade conflict between the US and China. The yield curve bear-steepened, with short-dated yields higher by c.2bps and longer dated yields higher by c.3bps. There were negative ticks in afternoon trade after Walmart launched a bumper USD 16bln multi-tranche M&amp;A bond. But generally, major curve spreads were little changed/slightly steeper, with 2s10s and 2s20s wider by c.1bps at settlement, while 2s30s and 5s30s were wider by less than 1bps. US 10YR T-note futures (Sep 2018) settled 7+ ticks lower at 119-19+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he expects quarterly GDP to move much higher and that he will announce a new form of healthcare in 2 weeks. Furthermore, Trump also commented that the immigration issue will be part of the requirements for Mexico in NAFTA, while he earlier stated that new deals on trade are to be announced soon. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said planned counter-tariffs against the US are strong and that they need to be, while she reiterated Canada sees no link between tariffs and NAFTA talks.

        "content": "<p>Asia traded mixed although were initially mostly higher following a similar showing on Wall St where most major indices finished positive in which the Nasdaq Comp. and Russell 2000 rose to fresh record highs, while the DJIA lagged and posted a 7th consecutive loss. ASX 200 (+1.2%) was led higher by tech which mirrored the outperformance of the sector stateside and with sentiment also underpinned after the Australian parliament passed the income tax cut package. Furthermore, the biggest gaining stocks APN Outdoor and Gateway Lifestyle were boosted by takeover approaches which lifted the former by over 10%. Elsewhere, the weak-JPY-increased-risk dynamic spurred Nikkei 225 (+0.7%), while Hang Seng (-0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) initially conformed to the improved global risk sentiment amid injections by the PBoC which also expects further increases in liquidity, although the tone in China later soured following comments from China&rsquo;s Mofcom which renewed its tough talk on trade against the US. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with demand sapped amid gains in riskier Japanese assets and weaker demand in the 5yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.2%) is led higher by the tech sector which mirrors the outperformance stateside and with sentiment also underpinned after the Australian parliament passed the income tax cut package. Furthermore, the biggest gaining stocks APN Outdoor and Gateway Lifestyle are boosted by takeover approaches which lifted the former by over 10%. Elsewhere, the weak-JPY-increased-risk dynamic spurs upside in Nikkei 225 (+0.8%), while Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. &nbsp;also conform to the gains alongside the improved global sentiment and amid injections by the PBoC which also expects further increases in liquidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively quiet overnight although the greenback has remained firm and above the 95.00 level, which has restricted its major counterparts across the pond with EUR/USD and GBP/USD little changed. Elsewhere, JPY once again took most the focus with USD/JPY and JPY-crosses supported by outflows from the safe-haven currency, while antipodeans are subdued with underperformance in NZD following somewhat inconclusive GDP data and on cross-related flows in which AUD/NZD broke through the prior day&rsquo;s resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with demand sapped amid gains in riskier assets and ahead of a 5yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
