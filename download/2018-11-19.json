Reports in later trade suggested that DUP&rsquo;s 10 MPs will be abstaining on pretty much every finance bill vote tonight to put the government on warning that the party is close to ripping up the &ldquo;confidence and supply&rdquo; agreement&quot;.There were also talks over a potential extension of the transition period after UK Business Minister Clark welcomed EU&rsquo;s Brexit Negotiator Barnier proposal to extend it to 2022 as it could benefit UK businesses by allowing extra time to negotiate a relationship with the EU. In related comments, Barnier noted that procedures on how to extend the transition period are yet to be agreed&nbsp; on, though emphasising that the transition extension must have a fixed end date and focus on finding a global accord on trade to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Elsewhere, there were reports suggesting that a future trade relationship does not apply to Gibraltar unless UK negotiates it first bilaterally with Spain whilst a UK Government spokesperson clarified they will not exclude Gibraltar from future trade negotiations. According to reports in the FT, France is pushing for extra conditions on a trade deal; EU&#39;s Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier held reservations on issues such as fishing rights as well as other trade conditions, which could badly hamper efforts to win approval for the Brexit deal in the House of Commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>EU Parliament President Tajani said that it would be a miracle if the current Italian government remains intact through to May. On the budget, Italian Government Official Buffagni stressed once again that the key points of the 2019 draft budget will not change, adding there are &quot;one thousand&quot; ways to improve it and that the government is working to lower the spread over Italian government bonds. Italian Deputy PM Di Maio stated that he has no worries regarding the potential EU process. In related comments, Italy&#39;s Economy Minister Tria noted that the European economy is slowing also in France and Germany whilst Italy&#39;s growth gap with the others is narrowing; he added that the EU Commission may look at budget in a different way but he was not sure if it will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Williams (Voter, Neutral) said he expects the FOMC to continue gradual tightening towards more normal rates in December adding that the Fed is not on pre-set policy course; he wants to keep it the strong and stable and noted the US economy is currently doing very well. On the labour market, he stated employment is low and US employers are hiring less skilled workers since there is broad labour scarcity. Finally, he highlighted that the exodus of Puerto Ricans has led to undercuts in economic growth forecasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Villeroy stated that Europe is prepared in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>EU Foreign Minister considered setting up an Iran trade mechanism under EU rules, rather than national laws; still no decision on location according to diplomats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -1.68% at 2690, NDX -3.26% at 6642, DJI -1.55% at 25018. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.14%, Materials -1.20%, Industrials -1.46%, Cons Discretionary -0.19%, Cons Staples -1.09%, Healthcare -1.25%, Financials -0.03%, Tech -3.70%, Telecoms +0.37%, Utilities +0.36%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) was a top mover today after Chinese regulators gave the go-ahead for Disney&rsquo;s (DIS) acquisition of it. General Electric (GE) made gains on the announcement that retired company veteran John Rice is returning to help spur growth. Arconic (ARNC) traded higher after receiving buyout interest. Ford (F) and Tesla (TSLA) were other top movers. PGE (PCG) continued its selloff today following it announcing another incident at a separate power line, regulators also threated they may have to make board changes for the co. Apple (AAPL) helped pull down tech after reports it had cut production on all three of its new iPhones. Micron (MU) was a bottom mover after antitrust violation allegations in China, with other semiconductors NVIDIA (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also down on the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.30 HIGHER AT USD 56.76/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLE USD 0.03 HIGHER AT USD 66.79/BBL. </strong>Crude prices ended Monday&rsquo;s session mixed amid choppy trade. Comments from Iran&rsquo;s Rouhani, who stated that the US has failed to reduce Iran&#39;s oil exports to zero, dragged the complex lower in European trade. Prices pared back some losses just after the US cash open; the complex continued to hedge gradually higher as WTI turned positive. In news flow, contributing to a bearish narrative for oil, IEA Chief Birol said exemptions by the US for Iran were above expectations and hence sees prices heading downwards, Saudi Arabia showed production rising in October while US total shale regions oil supply is expected to increase in December. Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak said Russia is planning to sign an output agreement with OPEC at the December 6th meeting while it was announced that Saudi Energy Minister is set to take part in G20 summit in Argentina. Inventories this week are seeing headline crude +2.1mln,distillates -2.6mln and gasoline +0.1mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 4+ TICKS HIGHER AT 119-09+.</strong> The treasury complex climbed higher as falling equities boosted demand for safe-haven fixed income. The yield curve saw some modest bull-steepening with short dated yields lower by c.3bps and long end yields lower by less than 1bps at settlement. The 10yr yield hit 3.054% the lowest since October. 2s30s were wider by c.2bps, 5s30s and 2s10s were also wider by c.1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The index has lost more momentum amidst a more bearish spin for the Buck in general on several counts, including growth jitters, fiscal concerns and expectations of global economic cycle rebalancing, with the DXY looking susceptible to a deeper reversal through 96.000 having failed to close above a key Fib last Friday (96.590) and now slipping below another (96.247).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Once again, Sterling has not been the biggest mover, but experienced a lot more volatility than most amidst breaking Brexit headlines that veered from defiance via UK PM May to divergence over the length of any extension to the transition period, and whether there is further room for manoeuvre on other terms of the draft deal. Meanwhile, the ERG remains short of the 48 letters needed to trigger a no confidence vote and the 5 senior Ministers only agreeing to stay in office on the proviso they can get amendments to the proposed withdrawal agreement are apparently unable to reach a consensus about what needs to be changed. Hence, another stay of execution for May who gave a rousing address at the CBI, stressing the positives of the accord, and a reprieve for the Pound as Cable survived a sub-1.2800 test and Eur/Gbp drifted back from circa 0.8930 even though there was some big interest to buy the cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF: </strong>Ending Monday&rsquo;s session as the clear G10 outperformer, and with decent gains vs the Dollar and Euro as broad risk sentiment soured on several fronts (renewed US-China trade jitters, ongoing Italian-EU budget angst, Brexit, some bearish company specific factors and another downturn in oil prices). The Franc extended recovery gains vs the Usd to just shy of 0.9930 and around 1.1375 against the single currency,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, EUR:</strong> Both moderately firmer vs the Greenback, but the former relatively rangebound between 112.45-85 and perhaps capped by decent option expiry interest (1 bn at 112.50), while the Eur nudged past technical resistance circa 1.1421 and a Fib at 1.1445, but could not quite sustain gains to seriously test 1.1500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD, CAD, NOK: </strong>The non-US Dollars remain on the backfoot with the Kiwi extending losses to almost 0.6815 and the Aud losing grip of 0.7300, but the cross holding near the upper end of 1.0640-95 trading parameters. Meanwhile, the Loonie and Norwegian Krona were both undermined by a sharp pull-back in oil prices alongside the overall loss of risk appetite, with Usd/Cad up to 1.3200 at one stage and Eur/Nok over 9.7100.</p>\r\n",

Comments from Iran&rsquo;s Rouhani, who stated that the US has failed to reduce Iran&#39;s oil exports to zero, dragged the complex lower in European trade. Prices pared back some losses just after the US cash open; the complex continued to hedge gradually higher as WTI turned positive. In news flow, contributing to a bearish narrative for oil, IEA Chief Birol said exemptions by the US for Iran were above expectations and hence sees prices heading downwards, Saudi Arabia showed production rising in October while US total shale regions oil supply is expected to increase in December. Elsewhere, Russian Energy Minister Novak said Russia is planning to sign an output agreement with OPEC at the December 6th meeting while it was announced that Saudi Energy Minister is set to take part in G20 summit in Argentina.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, Sterling has not been the biggest mover, but experienced a lot more volatility than most amidst breaking Brexit headlines that veered from defiance via UK PM May to divergence over the length of any extension to the transition period, and whether there is further room for manoeuvre on other terms of the draft deal. Meanwhile, the ERG remains short of the 48 letters needed to trigger a no confidence vote and the 5 senior Ministers only agreeing to stay in office on the proviso they can get amendments to the proposed withdrawal agreement are apparently unable to reach a consensus about what needs to be changed. Hence, another stay of execution for May who gave a rousing address at the CBI, stressing the positives of the accord, and a reprieve for the Pound as Cable survived a sub-1.2800 test and Eur/Gbp drifted back from circa 0.8930 even though there was some big interest to buy the cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Monday&rsquo;s EU session as the clear G10 outperformer, and with decent gains vs the Dollar and Euro as broad risk sentiment soured on several fronts (renewed US-China trade jitters, ongoing Italian-EU budget angst, Brexit, some bearish company specific factors and another downturn in oil prices). The Franc extended recovery gains vs the Usd to just shy of 0.9930 and around 1.1375 against the single currency,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both moderately firmer vs the Greenback, but the former relatively rangebound between 112.45-85 and perhaps capped by decent option expiry interest (1 bn at 112.50), while the Eur nudged past technical resistance circa 1.1421 and a Fib at 1.1445, but could not quite sustain gains to seriously test 1.1500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD/NOK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The non-US Dollars remain on the backfoot with the Kiwi extending losses to almost 0.6815 and the Aud losing grip of 0.7300, but the cross holding near the upper end of 1.0640-95 trading parameters. Meanwhile, the Loonie and Norwegian Krona were both undermined by a sharp pull-back in oil prices alongside the overall loss of risk appetite, with Usd/Cad up to 1.3200 at one stage and Eur/Nok over 9.7100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index has lost more momentum amidst a more bearish spin for the Buck in general on several counts, including growth jitters, fiscal concerns and expectations of global economic cycle rebalancing, with the DXY looking susceptible to a deeper reversal through 96.000 having failed to close above a key Fib last Friday (96.590) and now slipping below another (96.247).</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp (+0.9%) were choppy amid trade-related uncertainty following the verbal jabs between US and China in which Chinese President Xi warned that countries which embraced protectionism were doomed to fail and US Vice President Pence later commented the US could more than double the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods.

In separate reports, 42 Tory MPs have given assurances in letters to not support PM May which is still 6 below the 48 needed for a no-confidence vote, while ERG sources are said to be confident of reaching the 48 letters required on Monday to trigger a no-confidence vote against UK PM May.

Procedures on how to extend the transition period still need to be agreed, and that the focus must stay on the UK leaving in an orderly fashion. A possible transition extension would involve talks on the UK financial contribution; cannot say how much the UK should pay during an extended transition period, transition extension must have a fixed end date, with no date agreed as of yet. Finally, EU governments all agree on the principle of extending the transition period. Aim is to use the transition period to find a global accord on trade to avoid a hard border in Ireland.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major European indices are in the green, with the Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB (+0.4%) bolstered by news that Luigi Gubitosi has been appointed as the new CEO of Telecom Italia (+3.8%). The SMI (-0.3%) gave up initial gains and is lagging its peers, weighed on Swatch (-3.7%) and Richemont (-1.6%) following unfavourable price outlook for both by Bank of America Merill Lynch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sectors are mostly all in the green, with outperformance in telecom names, while energy names are lower given pullback in oil prices in recent trade and consumer discretionary names are weighed on by Renault (-10.6%), with the company shares extending losses following reports that Nissan&rsquo;s boss has been arrested in Japan regarding allegations of financial violations. Renault shares are hit given the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. Elsewhere, BPost (-7.1%) shares are hit following a downgrade at HSBC, while Tele2 (+1.6%), are near the top of the Stoxx 600 after being upgraded at Berenberg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, tech-giant Apple shares are lower by 1.9% pre-market after WSJ reported the company cut production orders for three new iPhone models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Greenback has regained some composure following its downturn at the end of last week amidst soft US data and cautious if not concerned or outright dovish Fed rhetoric (Clarida conscious about contagion from slower global growth, Kaplan envisaging headwinds from rising debt and Harker opposed to a December rate hike), but the DXY remains capped below a key Fib level (96.590) and the Dollar overall is mixed vs major counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD - All on the back foot against their US peer and underperforming other G10 currencies, with the Kiwi retreating below 0.6850 and undermined by cross flows as Aud/Nzd rebounds further from recent lows towards 1.0700 and Aud/Usd holds above 0.7300 in wake of last week&rsquo;s strong Aussie jobs data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The Pound has derived some comfort, or is simply just relieved that the Tory uprising and challenge to UK PM May has not reached the minimum level required to trigger a no confidence vote and adding another potential spanner in the Brexit works. However, the situation remains far from stable and certain given that Parliament still has to vote on the Withdrawal Agreement and the room for further renegotiation with the EU looks limited at best ahead of Sunday&rsquo;s Summit and more meetings planned in the run up to try and sound out whether there is scope to tweak elements of the draft. Cable has tested and marginally breached last Friday&rsquo;s peak at 1.2877, but far from convincingly amidst supply ahead of 1.2900, and with the 21 DMA also representing formidable tech resistance just above the big figure (1.2918-20). Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp has not pulled back too far below 0.8900, as the single currency holds firm in its own right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY/EUR - The Franc and Jpy have both regained a safe-haven bid, as US-China trade, Italian-EU budget and Brexit uncertainty persists, with the former back up above parity vs the Buck and over 1.1400 against the Euro, while Usd/Jpy is probing further below 113.00 and inching closer to decent option expiry interest at the 112.50 strike (1 bn). However, Eur/Usd has reclaimed 1.1400+ status, largely due to the weaker Greenback, and eyeing a key chart level circa 1.1421 (bear channel resistance) for further upside towards a major Fib (1.1445).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Rand has made an encouraging start to the week, with a break through 14.0000 vs the Usd exposing recent peaks and momentum to re-test 13.8700 ahead of 13.6000 (50% Fib).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.2) and WTI (+0.1%) are in positive territory, albeit off highs following market expectations that Saudi Arabia will steer OPEC and Russia to cut oil supply. Overnight gains in the complex were driven by reports that Saudi is said to want oil prices around USD 80.00/bbl. Gains later eroded after Iranian President Rouhani emerged on state TV and stated that the US has failed to reduce Iran&rsquo;s oil exports to zero and Iran will continue to sell their crude. Meanwhile, Russian Energy Minister Novak said the country is planning to sign an output agreement with OPEC at their December 6th&nbsp;meeting in Vienna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, Gold (-0.2%) prices fell this morning, with traders citing profit taking from last week&rsquo;s gains, while Palladium is nearing parity with gold as an all-time high of USD 1185.4/oz was hit on Friday. Separately, copper is lower following tension between the US and China at the APEC summit which ended without an agreement on a joint communique for the first time in its history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been gradual, but no less apparent given the outright change in direction and ensuing divergence vs Bunds, with Gilts rebounding firmly from 122.53 lows to trade at 122.90 (+18 ticks). Nothing really new to prompt the recovery, or at least not that we do not already know in terms of ongoing Brexit risk and perhaps some chart impulses turning as deeper downside technical support held. Back to Eurex, and the core German or Eurozone bond has pared some lost ground to 160.48 (-17 ticks) vs 160.24, with BTPs easing back just ahead of 122.00. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are essentially straddling parity after some choppy moves during overnight trade, with the curve slightly steeper ahead of a relatively light Monday agenda (only NAHB and Fed&rsquo;s Williams on the docket).</p>\r\n",

The SMI (-0.2%) gave up initial gains and is lagging its peers, weighed on Swatch (-4.0%) and Richemont (-1.4%) following unfavourable price outlook for both by Bank of America Merill Lynch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sectors are mostly all in the green, with outperformance in telecom names, while energy names are lower given pullback in oil prices in recent trade and consumer discretionary names are weighed on by Renault (-7.0%), with the company shares extending losses following reports that Nissan&rsquo;s boss has been arrested in Japan regarding allegations of financial violations. Renault shares are hit given the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, BPost (-5.7%) shares are hit following a downgrade at HSBC, while Tele2 (+1.8%), are near the top of the Stoxx 600 after being upgraded at Berenberg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Greenback has regained some composure following its downturn at the end of last week amidst soft US data and cautious if not concerned or outright dovish Fed rhetoric (Clarida conscious about contagion from slower global growth, Kaplan envisaging headwinds from rising debt and Harker opposed to a December rate hike), but the DXY remains capped below a key Fib level (96.590) and the Dollar overall is mixed vs major counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CAD - All on the back foot against their US peer and underperforming other G10 currencies, with the Kiwi retreating below 0.6850 and undermined by cross flows as Aud/Nzd rebounds further from recent lows towards 1.0700 and Aud/Usd holds above 0.7300 in wake of last week&rsquo;s strong Aussie jobs data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The Pound has derived some comfort, or is simply just relieved that the Tory uprising and challenge to UK PM May has not reached the minimum level required to trigger a no confidence vote and adding another potential spanner in the Brexit works. However, the situation remains far from stable and certain given that Parliament still has to vote on the Withdrawal Agreement and the room for further renegotiation with the EU looks limited at best ahead of Sunday&rsquo;s Summit and more meetings planned in the run up to try and sound out whether there is scope to tweak elements of the draft. Cable has tested and marginally breached last Friday&rsquo;s peak at 1.2877, but far from convincingly amidst supply ahead of 1.2900, and with the 21 DMA also representing formidable tech resistance just above the big figure (1.2918-20). Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp has not pulled back too far below 0.8900, as the single currency holds firm in its own right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY/EUR - The Franc and Jpy have both regained a safe-haven bid, as US-China trade, Italian-EU budget and Brexit uncertainty persists, with the former back up above parity vs the Buck and over 1.1400 against the Euro, while Usd/Jpy is probing further below 113.00 and inching closer to decent option expiry interest at the 112.50 strike (1 bn). However, Eur/Usd has reclaimed 1.1400+ status, largely due to the weaker Greenback, and eyeing a key chart level circa 1.1421 (bear channel resistance) for further upside towards a major Fib (1.1445).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Rand has made an encouraging start to the week, with a break through 14.0000 vs the Usd exposing recent peaks and momentum to re-test 13.8700 ahead of 13.6000 (50% Fib).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been gradual, but no less apparent given the outright change in direction and ensuing divergence vs Bunds, with Gilts rebounding firmly from 122.53 lows to trade at 122.90 (+18 ticks). Nothing really new to prompt the recovery, or at least not that we do not already know in terms of ongoing Brexit risk and perhaps some chart impulses turning as deeper downside technical support held. Back to Eurex, and the core German or Eurozone bond has pared some lost ground to 160.48 (-17 ticks) vs 160.24, with BTPs easing back just ahead of 122.00. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are essentially straddling parity after some choppy moves during overnight trade, with the curve slightly steeper ahead of a relatively light Monday agenda (only NAHB and Fed&rsquo;s Williams on the docket).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (+0.5%) and WTI (+0.1%) are in positive territory, albeit off highs, following market expectations that Saudi Arabia will steer OPEC and Russia to cut oil supply. Meanwhile, Russian Energy Minister Novak said the country is planning to sign an output agreement with OPEC at their December 6th&nbsp;meeting in Vienna. Overnight gains in the complex were driven by reports that Saudi is said to want oil prices around USD 80.00/bbl. Elsewhere, Iranian President Rouhani emerged on state TV and stated that the US has failed to reduce Iran&rsquo;s oil exports to zero and Iran will continue to sell their crude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, Gold (-0.2%) prices fell this morning, with traders citing profit taking from last week&rsquo;s gains, while Palladium is nearing parity with gold as an all-time high of USD 1185.4/oz was hit on Friday. Separately, copper is lower following tension between the US and China at the APEC summit which ended without an agreement on a joint communique for the first time in its history.</p>\r\n",

Back to Eurex, and the core German or Eurozone bond has pared some lost ground to 160.48 (-17 ticks) vs 160.24, with BTPs easing back just ahead of 122.00.

Meanwhile, the Loonie is straddling 1.3150 as the recovery in oil prices stalls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound has derived some comfort, or is simply just relieved that the Tory uprising and challenge to UK PM May has not reached the minimum level required to trigger a no confidence vote and adding another potential spanner in the Brexit works. However, the situation remains far from stable and certain given that Parliament still has to vote on the Withdrawal Agreement and the room for further renegotiation with the EU looks limited at best ahead of Sunday&rsquo;s Summit and more meetings planned in the run up to try and sound out whether there is scope to tweak elements of the draft. Cable has tested and marginally breached last Friday&rsquo;s peak at 1.2877, but far from convincingly amidst supply ahead of 1.2900, and with the 21 DMA also representing formidable tech resistance just above the big figure (1.2918-20). Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp has not pulled back too far below 0.8900, as the single currency holds firm in its own right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY/EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc and Jpy have both regained a safe-haven bid, as US-China trade, Italian-EU budget and Brexit uncertainty persists, with the former back up above parity vs the Buck and over 1.1400 against the Euro, while Usd/Jpy is probing further below 113.00 and inching closer to decent option expiry interest at the 112.50 strike (1 bn). However, Eur/Usd has reclaimed 1.1400+ status, largely due to the weaker Greenback, and eyeing a key chart level circa 1.1421 (bear channel resistance) for further upside towards a major Fib (1.1445).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rand has made an encouraging start to the week, with a break through 14.0000 vs the Usd exposing recent peaks and momentum to re-test 13.8700 ahead of 13.6000 (50% Fib).</p>\r\n",

The 10 year debt future opened at 122.66 vs last Friday&rsquo;s 122.72 close and briefly attempted to close the gap at 122.71, before retreating to 122.53 (-19 ticks), while the 3 month strip has been 3 ticks adrift at worst, in line with the bearish tone in core counterparts and acknowledging the fact that the rebellion against PM May is still half a dozen letters shy of the tally needed to mount an official leadership challenge. Note also, firmer EU equities have sapped some strength from the benchmark bonds along with a grinding BTP bid, to 121.75 (+40 ticks), with Bunds now testing chart support ahead of 160.00 around 160.26 (160.24 low, -41 ticks). &nbsp;Back to the UK, the PM is due to speak at the CBI from 11.10BST.</p>\r\n",

Although the latest words from Rome indicate little or no inclination to alter the main elements of the draft proposal, there has been talk about cutting superfluous spending and many ways in which it can be improved, offering some scope for compromise to avert procedures. Back to Eurex, Bunds are now just off a low od 160.46, -19 ticks on the day awaiting the EU cash bourse opens.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week somewhat cautious on lingering trade concerns and after disunity at the APEC summit over the weekend which failed to agree on a joint communique for the first time in its history due to US-China tensions.&nbsp; ASX 200 (-0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) are mixed with broad weakness seen and nearly all Australia&rsquo;s sectors in the red aside from miners, while Nikkei 225 is positive as participants digest mixed trade data which showed a jump in imports. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp (-0.1%) are choppy amid trade uncertainty following the verbal jabs between US and China in which Chinese President Xi warned that countries which embraced protectionism were &quot;doomed to failure&quot; and US Vice President Pence later commented the US could more than double the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are little changed amid a relatively quiet calendar and with the greenback flat heading into the holiday-shortened week. As such, EUR/USD holds near the prior week&rsquo;s highs at the 1.1400 handle, while GBP/USD consolidates as it awaits the next developments of the Brexit-related saga with PM May standing defiant in the face of a rising mutiny and although the Tory rebels are lacking 6 letters out of the 48 needed to trigger a no-confidence vote, ERG sources are said to be confident of reaching the threshold later today. Elsewhere, antipodeans have slightly pulled back following recent gains and USD/JPY is softer on trade-related uncertainty, with some also suggesting the GPIF&rsquo;s recent announcement that it is now able to hedge against currency risks as another factor driving flows into the JPY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as prices track the recent upside in T-notes and with the BoJ also in the market for JPY 800bln of JGBs in the belly to the short-end of the curve.</p>\r\n",
