However, he did repeat his view that the Fed should lift rates two times in 2018 (the Fed&rsquo;s dots look for three hikes). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Kashkari (non-voter) spoke once again on Friday, focusing on inflation data; the Minneapolis Fed President is gopeful that inflation is moving to target, but wants to see more evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US CPI: Core inflation rises more than expected</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US CPI YY, NSA (Dec) 2.1% vs. Exp. 2.1% (Prev. 2.2%)<br />US CPI MM, SA (Dec) 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.2% (Prev. 0.4%)<br />US Core CPI YY, NSA (Dec) 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.7% (Prev. 1.7%)<br />US Core CPI MM, SA (Dec) 0.3% vs. Exp. 0.2% (Prev. 0.1%)<br />US Real Weekly Earnings MM (Dec) 0.2% vs. Exp. 0.1% (Prev. 0.1%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traders focused on the core CPI measure, which rose to 1.8% in December, the latest monthly increase in almost a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +0.66% at 2786, DJI +0.88% at 25800, NDX +0.75% at 6758</strong><br />Top performers: Consumer cyclicals +1.0%, Energy +0.8%, Industrials +0.7%<br />Bottom sectors: Utilities -0.4%, Consumer non-cyclicals +0.1%, Materials +0.1%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The equities rally continues, with major US bourses printing fresh record highs at the end of the week, as Q4 earnings season gets underway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banks began reporting their numbers, with JPMorgan reporting a top and bottom-line beat; Wells Fargo, however, could only beat on the Adj EPS front, with revenues falling slightly short of expectations. The former&rsquo;s trading revenues were glum, as expected, with fixed income trading off by over 30%, while equities trading revenues were flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumer discretionary led the gains after retail sales increased. Energy was also higher, tracking crude prices. On the other end of the scale, utilities were the laggard, once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US 10-Year T-Note Futures settle 6 ticks lower at 122-30</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Treasury yields were slightly higher on the day (with the exception of 30s, which were unchanged), major curves flattened; most notably, the 2s30s curve, by c.3.6bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2s yields rose by around 3bps on the day following a decent core CPI data print, which has nudged the probability of three Fed hikes in 2018 slightly higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corporate supply has been healthy this week, with high-grade raising $32bln, according to Reuters. Next week, high grade issuers are forecast to raise between $25 and $30bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: USD lower despite healthy core CPI</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback found strength after core CPI data rose more than analysts had expected. However, the buck found is difficult to cling onto gains, and continued to ease gradually in wake of the release, and as yields gave back some of their gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR was supported by positive news from Germany, where parties have reached an &lsquo;accord&rsquo; to form a government, possibly by the end of February, driving the currency to the highest levels since 2014, now flirting with 1.22.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the day, the weaker dollar was helping the single EUR saw some small downticks in late European trade, after ECB member Jens Weidmann suggested that the prospects of an imminent rate hike from the ECB were small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yen was pushed to beneath 111.0 in wake of the US CPI data, though is consolidating around the figure as we head into the weekend. The Swissy also gained, breaching the 0.97 figure against the USD; as did gold, rising towards the $1340 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling took advantage of USD weakness, pushing above 1.37. There were reports in the afternoon suggesting that Spain and the Netherlands were amenable to a soft-Brexit, providing some impetus for Sterling bulls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD continues to be subject to NAFTA headline risk, though worries have eased slightly on a US-led deadline extension, remaining beneath 1.25 heading into the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 50 cents higher at USD 64.30 per barrel; Brent futures settle 61 cents higher at USD 69.87 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude prices rose on Friday, though Brent couldn&rsquo;t settle above $70 per barrel. Comments from the Russian energy minister supported the crude complex, after he said that markets were not balanced yet. The comments were said to undermined the argument that OPEC/Non-OPEC were edging towards unwinding their deal to curb output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baker Hughes reported that active oil rigs rose by 10 in the week to 752, the largest weekly increase since June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, oil specs raised net longs by around 46k to 501k in the week.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar Index is ending a turbulent week under pressure again and below 91.500 with only brief and mild relief coming from US CPI (core inflation firmer than expected) and Retail Sales data (broadly in line, but back month revised up). The DXY hit a circa 91.2500 low and the 2017 low at 91.011 is the next/nearest downside level unless the Greenback can stage a more meaningful and sustained recovery, which looks unlikely given ongoing strength elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only eclipsed by the Gbp as Friday&rsquo;s G10 top performer, but still the clear winner on the week as hawkish ECB minutes combined with a breakthrough in Germany&rsquo;s grand coalition Government talks propelled the single currency through several key upside markers. Last year&rsquo;s 1.2092 peak vs the Usd was surpassed with ease along with 1.2100 as buying interest at and just above the figure pushed the headline pair up to a high around 1.2150. 1.2167-69 next on the radar for bulls. Eur/Jpy took out offers and resistance from 134.85-135.00 on the way to a 135.35 peak, but Eur/Gbp was unable to build on gains above 0.8900 and retreated below on some positive Brexit developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sterling also improved on its 2017 best vs the Usd (1.3657) as Cable almost rallied to 1.3700 on reports that Spain and the Netherlands favour a soft Brexit. The Pound gained across the board on this positive news, reclaiming 152.00+ status vs the Jpy from lows not far from 150.50 earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both firmer vs the Greenback, with Usd/Chf close to 0.9700 and key tech support at 0.9699, while the Loonie tested 1.2500 again on hopes that an extension to NAFTA negotiations may help resolve differences, but could not get close to levels seen this time last week (1.2355) on the bumper jump in Canadian jobs (other data since less upbeat, like building permits on Wednesday).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volatile vs the Usd all week, but a net gainer having cleared bids around 111.00 and on track to close below 111.84 (30 WMA), if not 111.53 (Fib), which would keep the pair in a downtrend and eyeing major chart support around 110.84.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The antipopdeans have both lost momentum vs the US counterpart towards the end of the week, with Aud/Usd slipping back from just over 0.7900 on weaker than forecast Chinese imports and the Kiwi retreating from 0.7275 towards 0.7220 having failed to challenge the next round number. However, Aud remains underpinned ahead of the 0.7855 200DMA.</p>\r\n",

On Monday he added that inflation targeting is resulting in average inflation coming in lower than target, and suggested that price level targeting could solve that particular issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Bostic (voter) struck a dovish tone, stating that he sees no need for 3 hikes in 2018 given the current weak inflation situation, although he did stress that 3 hikes could occur if the data improves, but he was wary of issues that could be created by yield curve inversion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week Harker (non-voter) surprised the markets as he stated that he deems two hikes in 2018 as appropriate. He also noted that if soft inflation continues it may make the 2% inflation target harder to reach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosengren (non-voter) suggested that the FOMC could introduce an inflation target range of 1.5%-3.0%, while Kashkari (non-voter) stuck to his dovish playbook, reiterating that at present, too low inflation was more of an issue than too high inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the whole the recent rhetoric ratifies December&rsquo;s FOMC meeting minutes, where a few policymakers noted that December&rsquo;s economic projections would result in too many rate hikes in 2018, while a few others believed more hikes would be required (relative to a median of 3 hikes).</p>\r\n",

In terms of sector specifics, energy names are seen lower, in-fitting with the moves seen in WTI and Brent while consumer discretionary names are outperforming with Fiat (+2.7%) top of the FSTE MIB after unveiling plans to invest further in their Michigan plant and provide bonuses to US workers following US tax legislation. Other individual movers include Vivendi (-1.3%) seen lower after warning on guidance, whilst GKN (+24.7%) after rejecting Melrose&rsquo;s latest takeover offer; nonetheless, sources suggest that Melrose will continue their pursuit of the Co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, <strong>EUR</strong> has been extending gains in wake of hawkish December ECB minutes, with added impetus coming from news of a breakthrough in Germany to form a grand coalition Government. <strong>EUR</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> showed little resistance this time at last year&rsquo;s 1.2092 peak or the psychological 1.2100 level with layered macro bids propelling the pair to a circa 1.2135 high (best since December 2014). Tech studies show a bullish target 1.2169, but ultimately the charts signal 1.2350 and 1.2430 (200 MMA) as the next major objectives. On the flip-side, big 2.5bln option expiries at 1.2100 may exert a gravitational pull, but with the <strong>USD</strong> on the back foot perhaps not (<strong>DXY</strong> down near 91.30). Indeed, the Dollar is weaker across the board, with Cable tripping stops above 1.3600, USD/JPY eyeing bids at 111.00 and stops below, <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>CAD</strong> and <strong>USD</strong>/<strong>CHF</strong> both close to big figures or round numbers at 1.2500 and 0.9700 respectively. Antipodeans lagging a bit, but still bid vs the Greenback and only just off overnight peaks (<strong>AUD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong>/<strong>USD</strong> just below 0.7900 and 0.7275 respectively, with weaker Chinese imports within the latest trade balance perhaps dampening sentiment somewhat).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The relative calm did not last long, for core EU debt at least</strong>, as Gilts succumbed to selling pressure and reversed to a fresh Liffe low at 123.69 (-16 ticks vs +9 ticks at best), while Bunds extended to the upside to register a new Eurex peak at 160.62 (+31 ticks vs -14 ticks at worst). FX markets and even faster/frantic trade were the catalyst or driver for moves in bonds with the 10 year German benchmark and even moreso periphery paper the beneficiaries of EUR strength and upbeat tone/fiscal pledges from the new German coalition Government. Off peaks and troughs now as price action abates somewhat, while <strong>USTs remain largely side-lined awaiting today&rsquo;s key data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the energy complex, <strong>both WTI and Brent crude futures are seen lower</strong> despite the softer USD as Brent makes a pullback from the USD 70.00 level, leading some to question how much further scope there is for the ongoing rally in prices. Energy specific newsflow remains light, however, markets will be on the watch for any announcements today from the White House regarding sanction on Iran. <strong>In metals markets, both spot gold and silver have benefitted from the softer USD</strong>. Elsewhere, steel futures saw their largest daily decline in a month after three consecutive days of gains as demand faltered overnight. Finally, the latest Chinese trade data saw a 4.3% decline in copper imports for the month of December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross says results of investigation into national security impact from steel imports have been submitted to President Trump who has 90 days to decide on any potential action.

        "content": "<p>In FX markets, EUR has been extending gains in wake of hawkish December ECB minutes, with added impetus coming from news of a breakthrough in Germany to form a grand coalition Government. EUR/USD showed little resistance this time at last year&rsquo;s 1.2092 peak or the psychological 1.2100 level with layered macro bids propelling the pair to a circa 1.2135 high (best since December 2014). Tech studies show a bullish target 1.2169, but ultimately the charts signal 1.2350 and 1.2430 (200 MMA) as the next major objectives. On the flip-side, big 2.5bln option expiries at 1.2100 may exert a gravitational pull, but with the USD on the back foot perhaps not (DXY down near 91.30). Indeed, the Dollar is weaker across the board, with Cable tripping stops above 1.3600, USD/JPY eyeing bids at 111.00 and stops below, USD/CAD and USD/CHF both close to big figures or round numbers at 1.2500 and 0.9700 respectively. Antipodeans lagging a bit, but still bid vs the Greenback and only just off overnight peaks (AUD/USD and NZD/USD just below 0.7900 and 0.7275 respectively, with weaker Chinese imports within the latest trade balance perhaps dampening sentiment somewhat).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities (Eurostoxx 50 flat, DAX +0.1%) have been trading with little in the way of firm direction with any potential gains in the DAX (following German coalition talks) capped by the aforementioned EUR strength. In terms of sector specifics, energy names are seen lower, in-fitting with the moves seen in WTI and Brent while consumer discretionary names are outperforming with Fiat (+2.7%) top of the FSTE MIB after unveiling plans to invest further in their Michigan plant and provide bonuses to US workers following US tax legislation. Other individual movers include Vivendi (-1.3%) seen lower after warning on guidance, whilst GKN (+24.7%) after rejecting Melrose&rsquo;s latest takeover offer; nonetheless, sources suggest that Melrose will continue their pursuit of the Co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The relative calm did not last long, for core EU debt at least, as Gilts succumbed to selling pressure and reversed to a fresh Liffe low at 123.69 (-16 ticks vs +9 ticks at best), while Bunds extended to the upside to register a new Eurex peak at 160.62 (+31 ticks vs -14 ticks at worst). FX markets and even faster/frantic trade were the catalyst or driver for moves in bonds with the 10 year German benchmark and even moreso periphery paper the beneficiaries of EUR strength and upbeat tone/fiscal pledges from the new German coalition Government. Off peaks and troughs now as price action abates somewhat, while USTs remain largely side-lined awaiting today&rsquo;s key data</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the energy complex, both WTI and Brent crude futures are seen lower despite the softer USD as Brent makes a pullback from the USD 70.00 level, leading some to question how much further scope there is for the ongoing rally in prices. Energy specific newsflow remains light, however, markets will be on the watch for any announcements today from the White House regarding sanction on Iran. In metals markets, both spot gold and silver have benefitted from the softer USD. Elsewhere, steel futures saw their largest daily decline in a month after three consecutive days of gains as demand faltered overnight. Finally, the latest Chinese trade data saw a 4.3% decline in copper imports for the month of December.</p>\r\n",

However, the rebound from yesterday&rsquo;s lows looks fragile with US Treasuries still below par and in bear-steepening mode despite a strong long bond auction to end this week&rsquo;s refunding. Short Sterling futures are flat to a tick ahead, but again lacking clear direction given no domestic data on Friday&rsquo;s schedule and no fresh Brexit news. Hence, external impulses will continue to dictate and key releases in the pm may be the main drivers (CPI and retail sales) along with any further ECB minutes fall-out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Thursday&rsquo;s ECB minutes are still reverberating and steepening the curve, as markets recalibrate near term policy expectations in anticipation of revised more hawkish guidance sooner rather than later this year. News that Germany&rsquo;s main parties have made a breakthrough in coalition talks just sparked another knee-jerk sell-off to 160.17, while the benchmark yield is consolidating gains above 0.50%. Some short covering in futures in wake of in line French inflation data, but a sell into upticks strategy favoured unless the fundamental and technical outlook changes.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.2%) is led higher by strength in commodity-related stocks, although gains in the index are restricted by losses in the largest weighted financials sector. In Japan, index-heavyweight Fast Retailing outperforms the Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) after strong quarterly results, although the broader Japanese market is negative on JPY strength. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.5%) is positive after better than expected Chinese trade data and a more convincing liquidity effort by the PBoC, while the Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) is indecisive as operations still resulted to a net weekly drain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD remains subdued overnight after yesterday&rsquo;s weaker than expected PPI data and fallout from the EUR strength post-ECB minutes&nbsp;which were viewed as hawkish,&nbsp;as it stated that forward guidance and language surrounding the policy stance could be revisited early this year. As such, most major currencies have stayed close to the prior day&rsquo;s highs against the greenback with EUR/USD and GBP/USD firmly above the 1.2000 and 1.3500 levels respectively, while USD/JPY languishes and briefly approached 111.00 to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher with support seen amid the dampened risk tone in Japan, while focus shifts to the upcoming 40yr JGB auction later.</p>\r\n",
