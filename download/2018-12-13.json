Alongside the policy statement, the Bank enhanced their forward guidance by noting that &ldquo;the Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates&rdquo;. During his press conference, ECB President Draghi noted that incoming information has been weaker than expected, whilst the latest data and surveys were weaker than expected, thus suggesting slower growth momentum ahead. This sentiment was reflected in the staff economic projections which saw 2018 growth lowered to 1.9% from 2.0% and 2019 cut to 1.7% from 1.8%. On the inflation front, forecasters upgraded, 2018 HICP to 1.8% from 1.7%, whilst 2019 was lowered to 1.7% from 1.8%. Arguably the main source of market reaction from the press conference emanated from the Bank&rsquo;s assessment of risks surrounding he Euro Area economy with policymakers sticking to their current &lsquo;broadly balanced&rsquo; view, whilst acknowledging that risks were now moving to the downside. Later, ECB sources reported that ECB policy-makers debated changing the balance of the risk assessment to highlight downside risk;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump stated that if China&#39;s economy is in trouble, it is because of his policies adding he has a great respect for Chinese President Xi. There were reports suggesting US and China trade teams are to reconvene sometime after &nbsp;January 1st while the Chinese Commerce Ministry announced that they welcome a US trade delegation to visit China. In related comments, US Commerce Secretary Ross noted that the US and China are having frequent conversations and that Trump has not committed to intervening in the Huawei case. US Trade Advisor Navarro noted that China is buying soybeans and stated that investors should now focus on March when a China offer is due; he also appeared confident that the USMCA will reach the Congressional floor. Elsewhere, US President Trump is to hold a hearing on Friday on the proposed US-EU trade deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Thursday saw a number of responses to yesterday&rsquo;s confidence vote which was a victory for PM May. Focus shifted on the EU Summit where many European leaders vowed support for the British PM. Particular attention fell on comments from Irish PM Varadkar who claimed that the EU could provide a greater assurance to the UK that a future trade agreement could be negotiated quickly in order to avoid the backstop coming into effect. Also, Dutch PM Rutte urged the EU to do everything to help May though warning that room for manoeuvre is limited while Austrian Chancellor Kurz stands ready to accommodate requests if the solutions are approved by a majority in both EU and UK parliaments. There were also rumours over a special Brexit-EU summit in January. With regards to internal political developments, a UK PM May spokesman confirmed that the meaningful vote on Brexit will not happen before Christmas but will happen as soon as possible in January, before the 21st. In later news, the EU said to consider a backstop declaration with legal forces well as an aspirational end-date for the backstop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>EU&#39;s Moscovici was upbeat on progress made in budget negotiations with the country; he noted that Italy a &quot;significant effort&quot; and added that the meeting with Italy&#39;s Economy Minister Tria on Thursday was &quot;very constructive&quot;. He announced that work is continuing to quickly reach a compromise and stressed he does not want to open disciplinary action against the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 1.43 HIGHER AT USD 52.58/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 1.30 HIGHER AT USD 61.45/BBL. </strong>Oil traded higher on Thursday, with traders debating whether moves undertaken by OPEC last week can support a recovery in prices. Analysts at UBS have continued to talk up the potential for crude to rise in the near-term, noting that the extreme sell-off in the last two months leaves oil poised for a recovery as underlying positive fundamentals come back into focus. Specifically looking at Thursday&#39;s price action, Citi said &quot;The International Energy Agency monthly report provided another viewpoint, with its 415k bpd downward revision to non-OPEC supply for 2019 raising its projected call on OPEC crude oil to 31.7mln bpd. The IEA also highlighted the possibility of unplanned outages resulting in a deeper drop in OPEC supply, with Iran and Venezuela topping the list of members at risk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;SPX -0.03% at 2650, NDX +0.06% at 6768, DJI +0.28% at 24597. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +0.33%, Materials -1.15%, Industrials -0.26%, Cons Discretionary -0.44%, Cons Staples +0.68%, Healthcare +0.07%, Financials -0.61%, Tech +0.19%, Telecoms -0.19%, Utilities +0.88%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>General Electric (GE) surged today after long time bear JPMorgan upgraded the stock. Aflac (AFL) outperformed following reports it was in talks with a Japanese co. looking to take a stake in the insurance provider. Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG) traded higher on the back of an upgrade at BOAML. Macerich (MAC) was uplifted in earlier trade by reports of Simon Property (SPG) interested in bidding for the co. but pared back some of the gains later on after Simon Property denied the claims. Caterpillar (CAT) made gains on the open after reporting strong global sales in November. Apple (AAPL) gave upward pressure to indices today where it announced the development of a new campus in Austin, Texas. CVS (CVS) weighed down the healthcare sector as a US District judge is expected to block its merger with Aetna (AET). Under Armour (UAA) underperformed after it provided 2019 revenue growth forecasts below estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE UNCHANGHED AT 129-09. </strong>Treasuries traded choppy on Thursday and ended&nbsp; the session mixed with the only major catalyst being the ECB decision leaving interest rates unchanged; yields fell by 1-2bps after ECB&rsquo;s Draghi press conference initially moving in tandem with bunds;&nbsp; longer dated yields then edged higher following upticks equities. Most of the action was concentrated at the extremes of the curve with shorter dated yields lower by c.1bps and longer dated yields higher by c.1bps a settlement. The US Treasury sold USD 16bln in 30yr bonds stopping through by 0.2bps at a high yield of 3.165%, the lowest since September. The bid-to-cover came in at 2.31 and indicated an overall strong demand for the auction. Looking at the breakdown, directs secured a portion above recent averages, indirects were awarded the largest share since January and dealers were left with the smallest portion since January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Last but not least in terms Thursday&rsquo;s super Central Bank line up, as the ECB announced enhanced QE reinvestment guidance alongside unchanged key rates and confirmation that the APP will end after this month.&nbsp; However, the devil was in the final 2018 presser where President Draghi revealed ongoing confidence about hitting the inflation target, but increasing caution surrounding the outlook, which translates to risks remaining balanced even though they are shifting towards the downside. The upshot, session lows for the single currency vs the Dollar and Pound, circa 1.1330 vs just above 1.1390 earlier in the news conference and almost 0.8950 vs 0.9015 respectively. Note, however, Eur/Usd did recover some lost ground into the NY cut when decent 1.5 bn option expiry interest between 1.1340-50 rolled off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Eur weakness prompted a broader Buck bounce and marginal new peaks for index just under 97.300 vs 96.871 at the other extreme, with perhaps some additional impetus from upbeat US weekly claims over significantly softer than expected import and export prices, and tech impulses as Fib support at 96.812 held, albeit just.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>The aforementioned Usd recovery sapped some strength from the Aud, but it still retained a firm grasp of the 0.7200 handle on improved US-China trade relations following the latter&rsquo;s bulky soybean order and Beijing welcoming a Washington delegation. However, the Kiwi continued to lag and encircle the 0.6850 level after NZ&rsquo;s semi-annual economic outlook overnight revised down projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK, CHF, SEK: </strong>The Norwegian Krona and Swiss Franc were also eyeing end of year policy meeting and guidance for independent direction and the Nok initially rallied when the Norges Bank reaffirmed a likely next hike in March 2019, but gradually lost momentum on the longer term depo path profile that was trimmed to pencil a total of 2 rises next year, only 1 in 2020 vs 2 previously and another 2 the year after that. Eur/Nok back towards the middle of a 9.7080-9.7590 range. Conversely, the Chf remained relatively static as the SNB maintained a highly valued assessment of the currency and reiterated &lsquo;fragile&rsquo; FX markets that warrant ongoing monitoring with intermittent action when needed, and no change in the NIRP. Back to Scandinavia, the Swedish Crown is actually ending the EU session ahead of the major pack with Eur/Sek back under 10.3000 as bearish/dovish vibes emanating from yesterday&rsquo;s sub-consensus inflation data reversed on more upbeat Prospera price and Riksbank repo rate expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, CAD, JPY: </strong>Mixed fortunes as the Pound retained an underlying bid on less unstable UK political grounds after PM May&rsquo;s confidence vote victory, but pared best gains ahead of her pre-Summit with EU officials that appear willing to provide some assurances as long as the Brexit withdrawal draft is not altered materially. Cable is holding above 1.2650 s 1.2685 at best, while the Loonie has retreated from peaks vs its US peer to circa 1.3375 after a 2nd Canadian was arrested in China under suspicion of breaching national security. Similarly, the Jpy is testing a 113.61 fib after clearing big Japanese offers at 113.50 on the 2nd time of asking and pulled even further away from recent highs of 112.25.</p>\r\n",

Specifically looking at Thursday&#39;s price action, Citi said &quot;The International Energy Agency monthly report provided another viewpoint, with its 415k bpd downward revision to non-OPEC supply for 2019 raising its projected call on OPEC crude oil to 31.7mln bpd.

        "content": "<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least in terms Thursday&rsquo;s super Central Bank line up, as the ECB announced enhanced QE reinvestment guidance alongside unchanged key rates and confirmation that the APP will end after this month. &nbsp;However, the devil was in the final 2018 presser where President Draghi revealed ongoing confidence about hitting the inflation target, but increasing caution surrounding the outlook, which translates to risks remaining balanced even though they are shifting towards the downside. The upshot, session lows for the single currency vs the Dollar and Pound, circa 1.1330 vs just above 1.1390 earlier in the news conference and almost 0.8950 vs 0.9015 respectively. Note, however, Eur/Usd did recover some lost ground into the NY cut when decent 1.5 bn option expiry interest between 1.1340-50 rolled off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eur weakness prompted a broader Buck bounce and marginal new peaks for index just under 97.300 vs 96.871 at the other extreme, with perhaps some additional impetus from upbeat US weekly claims over significantly softer than expected import and export prices, and tech impulses as Fib support at 96.812 held, albeit just.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aforementioned Usd recovery sapped some strength from the Aud, but it still retained a firm grasp of the 0.7200 handle on improved US-China trade relations following the latter&rsquo;s bulky soybean order and Beijing welcoming a Washington delegation. However, the Kiwi continued to lag and encircle the 0.6850 level after NZ&rsquo;s semi-annual economic outlook overnight revised down projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/CHF/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Norwegian Krona and Swiss Franc were also eyeing end of year policy meeting and guidance for independent direction and the Nok initially rallied when the Norges Bank reaffirmed a likely next hike in March 2019, but gradually lost momentum on the longer term depo path profile that was trimmed to pencil a total of 2 rises next year, only 1 in 2020 vs 2 previously and another 2 the year after that. Eur/Nok back towards the middle of a 9.7080-9.7590 range. Conversely, the Chf remained relatively static as the SNB maintained a highly valued assessment of the currency and reiterated &lsquo;fragile&rsquo; FX markets that warrant ongoing monitoring with intermittent action when needed, and no change in the NIRP. Back to Scandinavia, the Swedish Crown is actually ending the EU session ahead of the major pack with Eur/Sek back under 10.3000 as bearish/dovish vibes emanating from yesterday&rsquo;s sub-consensus inflation data reversed on more upbeat Prospera price and Riksbank repo rate expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD/JPY &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed fortunes as the Pound retained an underlying bid on less unstable UK political grounds after PM May&rsquo;s confidence vote victory, but pared best gains ahead of her pre-Summit with EU officials that appear willing to provide some assurances as long as the Brexit withdrawal draft is not altered materially. Cable is holding above 1.2600 vs 1.2685 at best, while the Loonie has retreated from peaks vs its US peer to circa 1.3375 after a 2nd Canadian was arrested in China under suspicion of breaching national security. Similarly, the Jpy is testing a 113.61 fib after clearing big Japanese offers at 113.50 on the 2nd time of asking and pulled even further away from recent highs of 112.25.</p>\r\n",

This comes as the IFO downwardly revised their German growth forecasts, alongside ECB sources stating inflation and growth forecasts are set to be revised at the upcoming meeting today. This is seeing extended rotation into the periphery, with BTPs outperforming their counterparts (trading around highs above 126.00 vs. 126.14 at best) as Italy&rsquo;s 2.04% deficit/GDP target is being received positively by the EU. OATs are also benefitting from the EU&rsquo;s reassertion that France&rsquo;s budget is not set to be analysed until the new year. Further, upside in both France and Italy is being aided by Citi&rsquo;s European Government Bond Index year-end re-weighting, that has also seen an extension of 0.03 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US 10-year futures are following suit with the benchmark trading around the 120-10 handle and awaiting direction ahead of US jobless claims and USD 16bln 30yr issuance later in the day.</p>\r\n",

As such cable remains firmly above 1.2600, albeit off highs of 1.2685 with large options around 1.2650-60 (1.2bln) perhaps hampering further attempts towards 1.2700. Meanwhile, the EUR also feels some benefit from the softer dollar, but is lagging vs. the Pound as EUR/GBP slips below 0.9000 ahead of the ECB policy decision. Note: please refer to the research suite for a full preview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK, CHF &ndash; Staying with the Central Bank theme, two out of the four end of year meetings have already passed and the Norwegian Crown strengthened in light of the Norges Bank&rsquo;s current assessment reaffirming that rates will &ldquo;most likely&rdquo; be raised in March 2019. This, alongside upgrades to core CPI pulled EUR/NOK to lows of 9.7071 (vs. high of 9.7531).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, the CHF was largely docile in wake of the SNB keeping its key rate and corridor unchanged, as expected. The Swiss Central Bank also maintained that the Franc is &ldquo;highly valued&rdquo; alongside reiterating its preparedness to intervene if required and utilise the balance sheet to react in the event of shocks. Note, SNB Head Jordan stressed the risk of major and sudden exchange rate movements which would significantly alter monetary conditions. As such EUR/CHF remains within a the bottom of a 1.1301-1.1281 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD, NZD &ndash; The high-beta currencies continue to prosper in the more positive US-China trade environment, with the with AUD/USD building on gains above 0.7200 to just shy of 0.7250 at one stage, but also wary of big option interest at 0.7200 (1.3bln). Meanwhile NZD/USD remains sub-0.6900, albeit near the top of a 0.6880-42 range despite the downward revisions in the New Zealand HY economic and fiscal updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &ndash; Rangebound trade for the Yen ahead of tonight&rsquo;s Tankan Survey release with USD/JPY hovering sub-113.50 (with resistance around the figure).

Meanwhile, 3 month contracts have also found an early base after declining up to 3 ticks, awaiting the next Brexit developments and efforts by PM May to obtain the assurances from the EU required for UK parliament ratification. On that note, her leadership ballot win could be deemed hollow or merely a stay of execution as she still faces significant opposition within the Conservative Party and Whitehall, let alone a resolute stance from Brussels on the issues of a back-stop time limit and option to exit the arrangement if it is enacted.</p>\r\n",

As such, ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) were higher but with gains in Australia capped by losses in the telecoms sector after the competition regulator expressed preliminary concerns regarding proposed TPG Telecom - Vodafone Hutchison Australia merger which resulted to a near-17% drop in TPG shares, while property-related weakness also restricted upside. Hang Seng (+1.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.4%) were lifted amid the encouraging trade-related developments with China preparing to increase access for overseas companies and is working to replace its Made in China 2025 plan with one that tones down its bid to dominate manufacturing, while Chinese importers have also resumed purchases of US soybeans and are said to purchase as much as 2mln tons of US soybeans vs. earlier reports of 500k tons.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Draft EU document prepared for PM May is said to include possibility the EU are to look into giving more backstop assurances according to EU diplomatic sources. However, there were also reports that EU is poised to reject UK PM May&#39;s demands for legally binding assurances that the backstop will only be temporary and that EU leaders are to only give PM May 10 minutes of their time.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets quietened overnight in which the DXY traded sideways and just about stayed above the 97.00 level following the prior day&rsquo;s broad softness, which has helped its major counterparts hold on to most their recent gains with EUR/USD biding its time ahead of today&rsquo;s ECB policy meeting and with GBP/USD kept afloat after PM May&rsquo;s confidence vote survival. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was underpinned by the risk appetite and antipodeans were mixed as AUD benefitted from the risk tone as well as its heavy exposure to China, while NZD remained subdued after downward revisions in New Zealand&rsquo;s Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities traded mixed in which WTI crude futures languished following the prior day&rsquo;s late pressure as prices took out support at USD 52.00/bbl amid broad weakness in the energy complex, which followed on from the DoE report. Elsewhere, gold was flat as support from a subdued greenback was counterbalanced by lack of demand for safe-havens, while copper gains extended on gains amid the risk appetite and outperformance in its largest consumer China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Positive risk sentiment pressured the complex on Wednesday which remained in negative territory; in early US trade, selling action extended after WSJ reports suggested that China are looking to boost access to oversee countries. The complex pared back some losses after the 10-year auction which was soft overall. Most of the action was concentrated in the front end and belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps at settlement. Spreads were mixed but mostly steeper heading into the close. The US treasury sold USD 24bln of 10-year tailing by 0.5bps at a high yield 2.915%. Demand for the auction was below recent averages as indicated by the bid-to-cover which was the lowest since February. Indirects were awarded the smallest share since August, directs took the largest portion since September and dealers were left with a share close to recent averages. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 5+ tick lower at 120-09.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Cohen lawyer said US President Trump and White House knew Cohen would give false testimony in Congress and did not tell him not to.

As such, ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) are both positive but with gains in Australia capped by losses in the telecoms sector after the competition regulator expressed preliminary concerns regarding proposed TPG Telecom - Vodafone Hutchison Australia merger which has resulted to a near-17% drop in TPG shares, while property-related weakness has also restricted upside. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%) are positive amid the encouraging trade-related developments with China preparing to increase access for overseas companies and is working to replace its Made in China 2025 plan with one that tones down its bid to dominate manufacturing, while Chinese importers have also resumed purchases of US soybeans and are said to purchase as much as 2mln tons of US soybeans vs. earlier reports of 500k tons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets have quietened overnight with the DXY trading sideways and just about remaining above the 97.00 level following the prior day&rsquo;s broad softness, which has helped its major counterparts hold on to recent gains with EUR/USD biding its time ahead of today&rsquo;s ECB policy meeting and with GBP/USD kept afloat after PM May&rsquo;s confidence vote survival. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is underpinned by the risk appetite and antipodeans are mixed as AUD also benefits from the risk tone as well as its heavy exposure to China, while NZD remains subdued after downward revisions in New Zealand&rsquo;s Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lacklustre amid gains in stocks and similar price action in T-notes, with participants also side-lined ahead of a 5yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
