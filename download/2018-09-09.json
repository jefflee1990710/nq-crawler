(BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Chief Negotiator Barnier was said to be open to discussing other backstops and are ready to simplify checks if needed, according to a transcript on Friday which added they should be able to &quot;de-dramatise&quot; the Brexit backstop. Barnier also commented that Ireland remains a crucial issue and that there will be no agreement if there is no operational backstop, while he added if there is no Brexit deal, there is no more discussion and no mini-deals in the case of a no deal. However, there were later reports that EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier said ahead of the Salzburg informal summit of EU leaders, we are determined to work for an orderly withdrawal including Ireland&#39;s backstop and ambitious future relationship with UK, while he was also said to have told Austria&#39;s Chancellor Kurz that 90% of the Brexit treaty is now complete.

Traders have been on alert to the possibility of the US announcing $200bln of tariffs on China imports after the public consultation period expired on Thursday; Trump has suggested that a further round could be on the cards. In stock specifics, the defensive sectors (utilities and telecoms) were hit as Treasury yields rose after solid NFP data. Broadcom (AVGO) was higher by almost 7% after reporting decent earnings on Thursday AMC. Tesla (TSLA) was the worst performer on the NDX after further senior management quit the company, and as investors were concerned about the behaviour of founder Elon Musk after he was interviewed while smoking marijuana and drinking whisky on a internet talk show. SPX -0.2% AT 2872, DJIA -0.3% AT 25921, NDX -0.3 AT 7431.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The T-Note future was sold after a solid NFP print, where AHE rose more than expected, which pushed the future down from 120-04 down to 119-20; newswires reported that there was large put buying interest into the data in the TYZ8 contract. After the data, there was some stabilisation, with the Z8 contract trading between 119-20 to 119-23, though there was a bid after Trump threatened China with further tariffs, but even then, the move was faded as we approached the close. Despite yields higher across the curve, there was some narrowing between major curve spreads (5s30s -3bps, 2s30s -2bps, 2s10s -0.2bps). T-note futures (Z8) settled 17 ticks lower at 119-20+.</p>\r\n",
